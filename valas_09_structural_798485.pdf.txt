Abstract
Background: The root of the tree of life has been a holy grail ever since Darwin first used the
tree as a metaphor for evolution. New methods seek to narrow down the location of the root by
excluding it from branches of the tree of life. This is done by finding traits that must be derived,
and excluding the root from the taxa those traits cover. However the two most comprehensive
attempts at this strategy, performed by Cavalier-Smith and Lake et al., have excluded each other's
rootings.
Results: The indel polarizations of Lake et al. rely on high quality alignments between paralogs that
diverged before the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Therefore, sequence alignment
artifacts may skew their conclusions. We have reviewed their data using protein structure
information where available. Several of the conclusions are quite different when viewed in the light
of structure which is conserved over longer evolutionary time scales than sequence. We argue
there is no polarization that excludes the root from all Gram-negatives, and that polarizations
robustly exclude the root from the Archaea.
Conclusion: We conclude that there is no contradiction between the polarization datasets. The
combination of these datasets excludes the root from every possible position except near the
Chloroflexi.

Background
There are two basic strategies for rooting the tree of life
and defining the nature of the last universal common
ancestor (LUCA), inclusive and exclusive. The recent argument for an Archaeal rooting [1] is inclusive and relies on
arguments of primacy to establish the root. We feel such
arguments often lead to circular reasoning based on one's
expectation of what primitive cellular life should look

like. For instance if one assumes that cellular life began in
hydrothermal vents systems (reviewed in [2]) then one
could argue that any organisms living in or near hydrothermal vents could be LUCA-like. But this does not prove
that cellular life started in that condition. And even if it
did, it is possible that later organisms invaded that niche,
so the extant organisms there today are nothing like
LUCA. Paralog rooting, where one uses paralogous

sequences as an outgroup in a sequence tree [3,4], is technically an inclusive method since it attempts to determine
which groups of sequences are the most primitive. However, this method is not self consistent [5,6] and technical
objections have been raised [7].

tation of sequence drift, since structure is more conserved
than sequence over long evolutionary time scales, and
hence provides strong evidence when aligning proteins
that diverged before LUCA. We introduce structural information into Lake et al.'s analysis where possible.

Exclusive rooting defines branches as derived and thus
they are omitted until only the root is left, thereby establishing LUCA. Ideally these two strategies would converge,
but at this point there is no consensus even within one
particular strategy as there are multiple ideas on the nature
of the most primitive cellular systems [8,9] as well as how
to properly exclude the root from a particular branch
[7,10].

Cavalier-Smith has presented 13 polarizing transitions
using a variety of data to reach an exclusive solution [7].
These transitions include information from indels, quaternary structures, as well as cellular organization. It is difficult to do his analysis justice in a short summary but
here are the main points of his argument. He excludes the
root from the Archaea and Eukaryotes based on proteasome evolution. He argues the transition from a Gram-positive membrane structure to a Gram-negative membrane
would be much more difficult than the other direction, so
this excludes the root from the single membrane prokaryotes. The Chloroflexi have the simplest known outer
membrane, lacking outer membrane protein 85
(OMP85). OMP85 is present across all other gram-negative taxa so Cavalier-Smith places the root within or next
to the Chloroflexi. He present other arguments as well
that resolve the structure of the rest of the tree of life.

One method for arriving at an exclusive solution is topdown rooting using indels [10-13]. Usually an indel is
ambiguous: it could be an insertion or a deletion. But if
one knows the ancestral state the indel is polarized. That
is, one can say which forms of the indel are the ancestral
and derived states. One can then exclude the root from
any branches where all the organisms have a derived form
of the gene. One can infer the ancestral state of an indel by
comparing a pair of paralogous genes that were duplicated before LUCA. Traditionally this technique would
require a paralog set to be ubiquitous. Otherwise one
could not be sure the paralogs diverged before LUCA. The
advantage of top down rooting over traditional indel
polarization is the ability to handle non-ubiquitous genes
by considering gene loss and invention as well as insertion
and deletion when analyzing the most parsimonious scenario for the history of a paralog set.
Lake et al. have presented 8 indel polarizations (summarized in [14,15]). They conclude the root of the tree of life
lies between two clades. The first is the Actinobacteria
(single membrane bacteria) and Gram-negatives (which
Lake et al. refer to as double membrane bacteria). The second is the Firmicutes and Archaea (both of which contain
single membranes). The authors have presented indels
that apparently exclude the root from each of these clades
so they conclude the root must lie between them. We
present evidence using the addition of protein structure
data that implies this conclusion is not supported.
There are several prerequisites for an indel argument to be
correct in polarizing the tree of life. First, one needs a set
of nearly universal paralogs (at least universal to the taxa
being rooted). Second, one needs a quality alignment
between those paralogs. This is often difficult as paralogs
duplicated before LUCA have billions of years to drift and
are under different selective pressures. The conclusions
reached rely heavily on the alignment and this is the
Achilles' heel of indel polarization. Where protein structures exist they offer the opportunity to get past the limi-

Despite reaching different conclusions about the root,
both Lake et al. and Cavalier-Smith agree the root must lie
within the Bacteria by excluding the root from the Archaea
and Eukaryotes. Both agree that the Archaea must be
derived from a Gram-positive bacterium, but CavalierSmith argues it was an Actinobacteria and Lake et al. argue
it was a Firmicute. The arguments for each seem sound;
both groups probably contributed genes to the Archaeal
ancestor. The difference between which are the result of
vertical versus horizontal transfer is not yet resolved in our
opinion. The two methods also agree that the root is not
within the Actinobacteria or the Firmicutes. It is important to realize that despite claims that all rootings of the
tree are contradictory [16], the newest exclusive methods
are converging on a Bacterial rooting. The most important
thing these two bodies of work agree on is that there is a
single backbone to the tree of life that can be resolved
using rare events in evolution despite recent claims by the
sequence tree community that no such tree exists or can be
built [17,18]. However, the apparent disagreement
between these datasets weakens the position that a single
tree of life exists. We believe this work supports the idea
that a backbone to the tree of life can be resolved and
rooted by showing their analyses converge on the same
result.
This work will focus on the fundamentally different conclusions about where the root of the Bacteria lies. Cavalier-Smith argues for a Gram-negative root based on his
ideas about cells having an inside out origin, obcells [19].
He argues it would be easier for a Gram-positive cell to

evolve by simply losing the outer membrane than it
would be for a Gram-positive cell to gain an outer membrane and the cellular machinery needed to make it functional. The idea of a Gram-positive root is compatible
with several scenarios for the origins of cells as well
[20,21]. This argument will probably not be resolved on
the basis of which theory of the origin of cells is more elegant since most of the ideas of early cellular evolution are
highly speculative. Instead continued polarization of the
transition between Gram-negatives and Gram-positives
will lead to an understanding of which of these scenarios
is even plausible.

Unfortunately the crystal structure of EF-2 (the Archaeal
and Eukaryal orthologs of EF-G) from the Eukaryotes have
a large disordered (unresolved) region near the indel of
interest, hence these proteins are less suited for a structural alignment than the ones discussed below. The multiple structure alignments of these 3 regions is of poor
quality due to the disordered region, which can be seen in
the differing positions of the highly conserved residues on
each end of this region (glycine colored green and aspartic
acid colored magenta in Figure 1). However, the middle of
the alignment seems reasonable and supports an insertion
in EF-2 at the root of the Archaea.

We believe the indel in GyrA robustly excludes the root
from the Actinobacteria using sequence alone [11] and
there is no need to invoke structural alignments. However, we will subsequently present structural alignments,
as well as other data, that support the exclusion of the root
from Archaea based on insertions in elongation factors
[12] since objections to these conclusions have been
raised [1,22]. Lake et al. present 3 polarized indels that
they claim exclude the root from the Gram-negatives:
HisA (P-ribosylformimino-AICAR-P-isomerase), Hsp70
(heat shock protein 70 aka DnaK), and PyrD (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase). We will present evidence to suggest
that none of these arguments truly excludes CavalierSmith's rooting. The Eobacteria (Cavalier-Smith's term for
Deinococcus-Thermus and Chloroflexi) have the ancestral
form of HisA despite being Gram-negatives. The conclusions about Hsp70 are based on a sequence alignment
artifact, which is evident when a structural alignment is
used instead. The arguments made by Lake et al. using
PyrD are not self consistent, so we polarize this indel
using quaternary structure. This excludes the root from the
Archaea and Firmicutes, and probably from their last
common ancestor as well. We also discuss the insert in
Ribosomal Protein S12, which would have the potential
to exclude Cavalier-Smith's rooting, but does not.

We counted the distance between the well conserved
RG(IV)T and PGH motifs in all elongation factors to reach
a stronger conclusion (Table 1). Some sequences lack
these motifs, but it is strongly implied they were present
in the ancestral elongation factors since they are conserved across paralogs. The motifs are 20 residues apart in
every EF-Tu and EF-1 sequence that have the motifs. The
majority (55.95%) of EF-G sequences have the motifs 20
residues apart. This may actually be an underestimate
because the next most populated length of 27 resides
(32.16%) are mostly from β and γ-proteobacterial
sequences. According to the Genomes Online Database
[23], of the 1000 completed genomes published as of May
2009, 64 are β-proteobacterial and 215 are γ-proteobacterial genomes. These groups are over sampled relative to
many others which would deflate the true proportion of
the EF-G sequences that lack an insertion relative to EF-Tu.
Even so, the most parsimonious ancestral elongation factor would have 20 residues between these motifs. Every
Archaeal sequence that has the motifs in EF-2 has them 24
residues apart. Therefore, regardless of the actual alignment there must be a 4 residue insertion somewhere in
EF-2 of the Eukaryotes and Archaea. Therefore the conclusion that the root can be excluded from the Archaea [12]
is correct even though there is a sequence alignment artifact.

Results
Indels in elongation factors place the root within Bacteria
Several objections have been raised against the exclusion
of the root from Archaea based on indels in the paralogs
of initiation factors (IF) and elongation factors (EF)
[1,22]. They claim the conclusions reached in [12] are
based on alignment artifacts. These indels would be ideal
to analyze using structure since they narrow the root to a
single superkingdom. Di Giulio criticizes the alignment
between EF-G and EF-Tu because there is a 4 residue
stretch between the insertions that is more similar
between some paralogs than between some orthologs
[22]. Di Gulio is correct in raising a red flag here; there is
probably an artifact in the sequence alignment. However,
we argue the exclusion of the root from the Archaea is still
valid in spite of that artifact.

The region of the indel in IF-2 using EF-G/Ef-2 as an outgroup examined in [1] is also in a region that does not
align well structurally. Its sequence anchors are also much
less conserved than in the indel discussed above, so the
critique of this indel may be correct. However, the
strength of this indel polarization appears to be a moot
point. To the best of our knowledge no one has argued
against Cavalier-Smith's exclusion of the root from
Archaea based on proteasome structure [7,24], which is
strongly supported by our own conclusions on proteasome evolution [25]. That taken with the derived insertion
in EF-G and the quaternary structure of PyrD (discussed
below) there are 3 strongly polarized arguments that each
place the Archaea as derived from the Bacteria. To the best
of our knowledge there is not a single argument that

excludes the root from all the Bacteria in the same way
these 3 polarizations exclude the root from the Archaea.
Therefore the goal of the rest of the analysis of the indel
polarizations is to narrow the root within the Bacteria.
HisA and HisF exclude the root from all Gram-negatives
except the Eobacteria
HisA and HisF are an ideal paralog set because they are
nearly ubiquitous and have a relatively high degree of
sequence similarity among paralogs. A structural alignment of the 3 forms of this indel reveals that the conclusions based on sequence alignments are valid (data not
shown). Lake et al. conclude this excludes the root from
the Actinobacteria and Gram-negatives [14]. However,
their own summary of the indel shows the insertion that
is present in most Gram-negatives is apparently absent in
a Deinococcus genome. A realignment of just a few species
that have the insert with the Eobacteria shows that all 11
fully sequenced Eobacterial genomes have a deletion relative to the other Gram-negatives (Figure 2). This means
that the indel in HisA actually excludes the root from the

Actinobacteria and all Gram-negatives except the Eobacteria. Cavalier-Smith claims the Eobacteria are some of the
most ancient bacteria because they lack lipopolysaccahride in their membranes. The fact that HisA does not
exclude Cavalier-Smith's root would not matter on its
own, because two other indels apparently exclude the root
from the Eobacteria. But we will argue neither of these
arguments holds water, and that the results of Lake et al.
and Cavalier-Smith converge on a rooting within the
Eobacteria.
Protein structure alignment renders the Hsp70/MreB indel
inconclusive
Lake et al. claim that the Hsp70/MreB indel excludes
LUCA from the Gram-negative bacteria [10]. This is not a
new idea, and was first proposed by Gupta 10 years ago
[26]. Hsp70 contains a large indel between the Gram-positives and Gram-negatives. Since Hsp70 is nearly universally distributed, if one can deduce the ancestral state of
Hsp70 it would reveal which group is ancestral and which
is derived. There is no indel between MreB and Hsp70

from the Gram-positives in Gupta's alignment. He argues
the Gram-negatives are derived since they have an apparently derived insertion in Hsp70. However, Philippe has
made the argument that Mreb and Hsp70 are very distant
paralogs, so it is difficult to align them [27]. In his alignment it is not clear whether or not the Gram-positive form
of Hsp70 has an insertion relative to Mreb. He raises the
possibility that there are actually two independent insertion-deletion events. The newer work on this indel has
dealt with the issue of the gene being missing in some species, but has not significantly improved the quality of the
alignment [10].

The recently solved crystal structure of a Gram-positive
Hsp70 from Geobacillus Kaustophilus provides an opportunity to review the Hsp70/MreB situation using a structural
alignment [28]. Structures of Hsp70 from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were aligned with MreB
using the CE-MC webserver [29]. These structures align
well, which is expected since they are all in the same SCOP
superfamily [30]. It is implied that Hsp70 from Grampositives aligns perfectly to Mreb in this region
[10,26,31]. A review of the structural alignment reveals
this is not the case. Rather Hsp70 from Gram-positive bacteria have an insertion relative to Mreb (Figure 3). There

has to be 2 independent insertion-deletions events here to
account for the 3 different structures seen in this region.
Therefore, it is impossible to determine the ancestral state
of Hsp70. Every scenario requires two insertion-deletion
events regardless of the root, and therefore this indel cannot be used to polarize the transition between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
Quaternary structure of PyrD excludes the root from the
Archaea and Firmicutes
Lake et al. have polarized an indel in PyrD using HemE
(uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase) to exclude the root
from the Archaea and Firmicutes [13]. Later they polarized the same indel in PyrD using HisA and HisF as outgroups to exclude the root from the Gram-negatives and
the Actinobacteria [14]. With these conclusions one could
root the universal tree of life by polarizing the PyrD indel
alone. This appears to be supported by the indels in HisA
and Ribosomal Protein S12, but as discussed above and
below, respectively, the conclusions Lake et al. reach on
these 2 indels are also in question. We argue there is a contradiction in the analysis of PyrD, and propose an argument based on quaternary structure to resolve this
contradiction.

All of the most parsimonious rootings with a HisA (or
HisF) outgroup have the ancestral state of PyrD being a
deletion relative to the derived state [14]. The authors consider this result independently of their results with HemE
outgroups. However, the ancestral state of PyrD should be
the same regardless of the outgroup. All of the trees that
are the most parsimonious with the HemE outgroup
imply the ancestral state of PyrD was an insertion relative
to the derived state [10]. It is impossible for any one rooting to be the most parsimonious with both HemE and
HisA as outgroups.
There are two possible sources of the contradiction. The
first is an alignment artifact. Our structural alignment of
PyrD, HisA, and HisF is in agreement with Lake et al.'s
sequence alignment (data not shown). HemE appears to
be more distant in structure and sequence to these other 3
proteins than they are between themselves. The structure
alignments between PyrD and HemE are not consistent.
They vary greatly depending on which structures are used.
The alignment in [13] is between the 3rd beta sheet in
HemE and the 7th beta sheet in PyrD. These regions are
technically homologous because this fold arose through a
series of internal duplications [32], but the fact these are
different regions within paralogous structures indicates
this alignment should not be used for polarizing the
indels. The duplication between the paralogs is more
recent than the duplication between the subbarrels, so
one should be aligning the same region of the structures
between paralogs. If we assume their sequence alignments

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/30

to be correct then the other possible source for the contradictory conclusions is convergent evolution. There are several variants of PyrD and HemE at this site which include
an additional 1 residue indel. This implies this region of
PyrD is tolerant to small indels, so convergent evolution
at this site is not out of the question. Top-down rooting
excludes all trees that are not the most parsimonious,
which assumes there was no convergent evolution. In this
case there is evidence for convergent evolution so topdown rooting should not be applied to this indel set.
Since the indel arguments contradict themselves, it is
worth considering another line of reasoning. Lake et al. do
not consider the quaternary structure of PyrD. There are 3
families of PyrD, each with a different solved quaternary
structure [33]. The distribution of each family was examined using the NCBI Protein Clusters Database [34]. PyrD
2 (PRK07565) is a membrane bound monomer and is
found across the Gram-negatives and Actinobacteria.
PyrD 1A (PRK02506) is a homodimer that is mainly
found within the Lactobacillales. PyrD 1B (PRK07259) is
a heterotetramer found across the Archaea and Firmicutes
(except in Staphylococcus that have PyrD 2). It has an extra
subunit, PyrK. The core of this enzyme is a homodimer
that is similar to PyrD 1A [35] (Figure 4). PyrD 1B has a
deletion relative to the 2 other subfamilies. This deletion
is polarized as the ancestral state when HisA or HisF are
used as an outgroup, but is derived when HemE is used as
an outgroup.
We argue the most parsimonious route for quaternary
structure evolution would be monomer -> homodimer ->
heterotetramer. A new protein-protein interface evolves at
each step in this scenario. One can imagine a scenario
where protein-protein interfaces are lost at each step but
this requires a heterotetrameric ancestor. None of the
other known structures in PyrD's or PyrK's superfamilies
bind each other, which means there is no outgroup that
makes a heterotetrameric ancestral state seem plausible.
HemE is a homodimer and HisA is a monomer, so if
either of these are the true ancestor of PyrD it does not
make sense for the homotetramer to be the ancestral state.
HisF is a heterodimer, but the other subunit appears to be
unrelated to PyrK. Without a heterotetrameric outgroup
the only way PyrD 1B could be ancestral is to have gained
PyrK at the root of the PyrD tree. However, this subunit
would have to be lost in PyrD 1A, so this is obviously not
the most parsimonious scenario. The most parsimonious
scenario for quaternary structure evolution is the one
described above, and that excludes the root from Firmicutes and Archaea as well as their last common ancestor.
Even if evolution was not completely parsimonious in
this case it does not negate our polarization that places
PyrD 1B as the derived state. We argue that independent
insertion events in this region are more probable than the

homotetramer being the ancestral structure. At the very
least, PyrD should be considered inconclusive for excluding the root since the sequence and structure arguments
disagree. PyrD is another structural argument that the
Archaea must be derived from the Gram-positives in line
with previous arguments on proteasome evolution
[7,24,25].
A maximum likelihood tree for PyrD 1B has good separation between the Firmicutes and Archaea (Figure 5). This
implies this distribution is not the result of horizontal
transfer, but rather each of these groups ancestrally had a
derived form of the protein. The Crenarchaea and Euryarchaea each cluster separately too. The Archaeal ancestor
probably had PyrD 1B, but it was lost in several Crenar-

chaea. It must be noted that PyrD 1B is present in the
Dehalococcoides (a subgroup of Chloroflexi). Based on
their position in the tree this could be a horizontal transfer from the Firmicutes. However, even if the Dehalococcoides invented PyrD 1B its presence across a single genus
does not exclude the root from the Chloroflexi.
Ribosomal protein S12 and RpoC are probably not
paralogs
Indel polarization requires special attention to the choice
of paralogs. It has been argued that the indel in ribosomal
protein S12 can be polarized using RpoC (DNA-directed
RNA polymerase subunit beta') [13]. The authors claim
this excludes the root from the Firmicutes and Archaea.
This apparently derived insertion is present in all the

nitude). It is possible for there to be homology between
proteins at a subdomain level as discussed in our recent
review [36], but we see no evidence of that in this case. A
pairwise alignment between ribosomal protein S12
(1J5E:L) and RpoC (2A69:D), both from Thermus thermophilus, was performed using FATCAT [37]. The regions
in the sequence alignment do not align in the structure
alignment at all. FATCAT concludes these structures are
not similar (P-value of 9.96e-01). None of this is evidence
these regions can be considered paralogous. It is possible
these two regions do share a common ancestor, but since
their structural context has changed it does not make
sense to align their sequences. This raises the question of
whether a sequence alignment can ever be considered
meaningful without structural conservation. We conclude
the indel in ribosomal protein S12 cannot be polarized
using this out group. A structure search of the Molecular
Modeling Database [38] revealed that no solved structures
are homologous to ribosomal protein S12 in the region of
interest despite their being many structures in the same
family in SCOP. This indel probably cannot be polarized
properly, and is not evidence against a root within the
Chloroflexi.

Chloroflexi, which is not discussed by the authors. Ribosomal protein S12 belongs to the "OB-fold" in SCOP.
RpoC belongs to the fold "beta and beta-prime subunits
of DNA dependent RNA-polymerase". The overall structure of these proteins is different enough they are considered to be different folds. This alone is enough evidence
that a sequence alignment between these proteins is probably meaningless. However the authors only claim the
regions around the indel are homologous. They calculate
an e-value of .002 that these 30 residues are paralogous in
both proteins. This e-value is much worse than that of
their other paralogs pairs (by up to several orders of mag-

There are four conclusions of Lake et al. that would disprove the rooting of the tree of life proposed by CavalierSmith if they are correct. We show that all four of these
arguments have flaws and that is evidence that CavalierSmith's rooting is probably correct. The fact that the HisA
indel excludes all the Gram-negatives except the Eobacteria is certainly a novel piece of evidence that supports the
rooting within the Eobacteria. There are only a limited
number of paralogs sets that are ubiquitous enough to be
useful for rooting the tree. These sets will probably be
exhausted without truly contradicting the Eobacterial
root. Indel analysis reliably excludes the root from the
Archaea, Actinobacteria and all Gram-negatives except the
Eobacteria (summarized in Figure 6). Our polarization of
PyrD's quaternary structure excludes the root from the
Archaea and the Firmicutes, and their last common ancestor. If we combine these new interpretations of the indel
data with Cavalier-Smith's 13 polarizing arguments there
are no contradictions. All of this data supports the notion
that LUCA must be near the Chloroflexi.
One of the major unresolved questions about LUCA is
whether it had a DNA or RNA genome [39]. We argue that
if LUCA was Chloroflexi-like, then it might have had a uDNA genome. Thymidylate synthase is an essential
enzyme that catalyzes formation of dTMP. There are two
unrelated enzymes that perform this function, ThyA and
ThyX [40]. The other 4 DNA nucleotides are converted
from their RNA counterparts by ribonucleotide reductase.
This implies there was a stage in evolution where DNA
used uracil instead of thymine [41].

Figure 5
Maximum likelihood tree of PyrD 1B
Maximum likelihood tree of PyrD 1B. Each of the major groups is separated by significant bootstrap values which indicates the distribution of PyrD 1B cannot be due to recent horizontal transfer.

Thymidylate synthase follows 2 distinct patterns of evolution in the fully sequenced Chloroflexi genomes. All the
Dehalococcoides have both ThyA and ThyX. This must be a
derived state since one of the enzymes must have arisen
before the other. It is possible that LUCA contained both
of these enzymes, but very few species retain both of
them. In many cases horizontal transfer displaces one
with the other instead of retaining both as can be seen by
looking at the distribution of these enzymes on a species
tree (data not shown). It is far more likely that at least one
of these enzymes is the result of a later horizontal transfer
to the Dehalococcoides. The rest of the Chloroflexi contain
only ThyX. However, this ThyX contains a domain duplication. This duplicated version of the protein has not been
characterized, but is present in a few other species. It is
possible that LUCA had a duplicated ThyX and the rest of
the species have lost a domain, but this is clearly less parsimonious than this form of ThyX being derived.

We postulate that LUCA was Chloroflexi-like with a uDNA genome. One of the first major branching points in
the modern tree of life would be the origin of thymidylate
synthase. All u-DNA genomes would eventually be out
competed by t-DNA genomes in similar niches. Any uDNA genome that received thymidylate synthase from a
horizontal transfer should be all right since they already
had all the machinery necessary for dealing with u-DNA.
They would out compete similar u-DNA species. The distribution of thymidylate synthase in the Chloroflexi can
only be explained by multiple horizontal transfers. It is
possible one of the thymidylate synthases in Dehalococcoides represents the ancestral form and there were two
later displacements (or a displacement and duplication
event). Distinguishing between these scenarios is very difficult as an ancient horizontal transfer so close to the root
of the tree would mimic vertical descent. Unfortunately all
the sequence trees constructed have low bootstrap values

superkingdom. Serious objections have been raised to the
possibility that Archaea are derived from Bacteria based
on differences in DNA replication machinery [42], but our
own analysis suggests this divide is not as vast as some
have suggested (in preparation). But that is beyond the
scope of this work.

Summary of data
Summary of data. Each circle corresponds to an argument
presented above that excludes the root of the tree of life
from a particular branch. The Archaea are placed with the
Gram-positives, but drawn with a dashed line because we do
not wish to argue which Gram-positive group was their
ancestor at this time.
for the critical edges, so we cannot conclude that each of
the 3 different thymidylate synthases in the Chloroflexi
are the result of horizontal transfer (data not shown).
Therefore this might not be a falsifiable hypothesis, but it
certainly is an interesting idea.
One could argue we have excluded the root from the
ancestor of the Archaea and Firmicutes based on the presence of a derived PyrD, but have come up with an odd scenario to justify a rooting we like that has a derived
thymidylate synthase. The major difference is that PyrD
1B appears to be present in almost every Archaeal and Firmicute genome, including the apparently deep branching
Thaumarchaeota and Korarchaea, which makes horizontal transfers after their last ancestor unlikely. It is very
unlikely that the history of thymidylate synthase in the
Chloroflexi involved no horizontals transfers. There is
also ample evidence that ThyX and ThyA frequently
replace each other through horizontal transfers. It is reasonable for the Chloroflexi to have some derived traits
even if they represent the most ancestral branch of the tree
of life, as long as these traits appear to be the result of later
transfers as in this case. Even with the correct rooting, it
might not be possible to reconstruct LUCA because of
later horizontal transfers, but this is a good example of
how one can tell when a derived trait has been transferred
to an ancient group.
There is growing evidence that the Archaea are derived
from the Gram-positive Bacteria [7,12,13,24,31]. However there is still disagreement on whether that Gram-positive ancestor was a member of the Firmicutes or
Actinobacteria (which is why the Archaea are placed
ambiguously in Figure 6), as well as the source of selective
pressure that was great enough to give rise to a novel

One of the corollaries of a rooting near the Chloroflexi is
that the first true cells had two membranes. This may
seem counterintuitive, but is actually well explained by
Cavalier-Smith's obcell theory [19]. The idea is that the
first organisms were cells that had nucleozymes anchored
by short hydrophobic peptides to the outside of the membrane. In other words life started on the outside of cells,
not inside them. This gets around the difficulty of forming
transmembrane pores, a major difficulty in the RNA
world. Heredity would still be based on the division of
membranes, just as it is now. If two obcells were to fuse,
the result would be a double membrane protocell. Very
little follow-up has been done to test the plausibility of
the obcell theory. We hope the additional evidence for a
Gram-negative root provided in this work motivates other
to investigate this idea further. There are currently about a
dozen sequenced Eobacterial genomes compared to the
hundreds of proteobacterial genomes discussed above.
More research into the genomics of these possibly early
branching bacteria could bring many obscured details
about LUCA into the light.

Methods
The multiple structural alignment in Figure 1A was performed using the MUSTANG webserver[43]http://
www.cs.mu.oz.au/~arun/mustang/ and the one in Figure
3 was performed using the CE-MC webserver [29]http://
pathway.rit.albany.edu/~cemc/. We used different alignment algorithms for these 2 data sets because in each case
one program gave a higher quality alignment than the
other. Pairwise structural alignments were performed
using FATCAT [37]. Molecular graphics images were produced using the UCSF Chimera package [44].
The phylogenetic tree in Figure 5 was constructed using
Phyml [45], packaged as part of Geneious http://
www.geneious.com/. The tree was built from the multiple
alignment of PRK07259 in the NCBI Protein Clusters
Database [34]. The tree was drawn and colored using
FigTree http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/.
The data used to generate Table 1 was taken by looking at
the most populated clusters for each elongation factor in
the NCBI Protein Clusters Database [34]. EF-Tu statistics
were calculated using the sequences in PRK00049,
PRK12735, and PRK12736. EF-1 sequences are from
PRK12317. EF-G sequences are from PRK13351,
PRK12740, PRK12739, and PRK00007. EF-2 sequences

are from PRK07560. Only sequences that had both the
RG(IV)T and PGH motifs were used to calculate insertion
lengths, as these are then only cases that can be unambiguously compared without actually aligning the paralogs.

In this article, Valas and Bourne attempt to resolve two
disparate indel-based rootings of the tree of life proposed
by Cavailer-Smith [7] and Lake [14], respectively. In each
case, the presence of indels is used as a polarizing character for pairs of paralogous genes that duplicated before the
LUCA, allowing for the exclusion of the root from particular branches of the tree. Using different sets of genes containing indels, Cavalier-Smith argues for a root within the
Actinobacteria, while Lake argues for a root within the Firmicutes. The authors determine that the work presented
by Lake et al. [14] does not necessarily exclude the rooting
reported by Cavalier-Smith, thus supporting a root within
the Actinobacteria, near the Chloroflexi.
Author's response
This is incorrect. Cavalier-Smith is not arguing that the
root is anywhere near the Actinobacteria. He is arguing for
a Gram-negative root and the Actinobacteria are Grampositive. Lake et al. are also not arguing for a root within
the Firmicutes either. We realize this is a confusing subject
since each group is referring to non-standard higher level
taxa. We have tried to be more explicit about the traditional vs non-traditional names as well be clear as to the
number of membranes each of these groups has. It is vital
to understand that Cavalier-Smith's root is based on multiple types of polarized evidence including but certainly
not limited to indels.

Various methods exist for rooting the tree of life, primarily
either using polarizing characters, or reciprocal rooting of
paralogs. While the authors mention paralog rooting as
an alternative method, their claim that it is not "self consistent" is an overstatement, as the supermajority of paralogs used in these analyses support a rooting within the
bacterial stem, with a few others showing weaker support

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/30

for a root at an undertermined position within the bacterial domain. None support a rooting within either the
archaea or eukarya. That being said, the authors' stated
objective is to root the tree relying only on indel-based
evidence, and it is only fair to evaluate their conclusions
solely within that context.
Author's response
We actually disagree with the statement that this work
should be judged on indels alone. Our goal is to root the
tree using any data possible. This work is just an evaluation of Lake et al.'s works on indels, but its important to
remember the context of the argument rests on other data
sources. We do not think we have overstated the inconsistencies created from paralog rooting. In the most comprehensive search for informative paralog rootings the true
supermajority (137 out of 154) were inconclusive because
they made both the Archaea and Bacteria polyphyletic due
to horizontal transfer [5]. Of the 17 remaining paralogs
sets 9 supported the rooting between the stem Archaea
and Bacteria, 7 supported rootings within Bacteria, and 1
supported a rooting within the Archaea. The authors
advised to use caution when accepting the rooting
between the superkingdoms, because it is consistent with
the tree long branch attraction would cause. In reviewing
their own work the authors say "Large-scale search of
anciently duplicated genes did not bring any consensus"[46]. The reason paralogs rooting is not self consistent
is because there are many reasons why a sequence based
tree will not reflect the evolution of cells. We hope the
moral of this work is that structure is an untapped
resource in rooting the tree.

The authors correctly mention that the quality of alignment is the major limitation to indel-based rooting
approaches, and that the addition of structural information greatly improves the reliability of the method. However, even with the additional confidence that observed
indels are real (and not alignment artifacts), their utility as
polarizing characters still varies greatly based on the
length and context of the indel. For example, the support
for excluding the root from the archaeal/eukaryal grouping [11] shown in Figure 1 consists of a large region of
protein sequence (14 AA) within EF-2 corresponding to a
discrete helical surface structure within the protein. Compared to the homologous regions of EF-G and EF-Tu, it is
clear that this is a derived, polarizing character. Indel evidence used for excluding the root from within bacterial
groups seems to be far weaker in both hypotheses being
compared, as small indels are more likely to be the result
of convergence.
Author's response
We completely agree that larger indels make better phylogenetic markers and that our evidence excluding the root
from Archaea and Eukaryotes is stronger than its placePage 11 of 16

Biology Direct 2009, 4:30

ment within Bacteria. However, some still claim the root
is within either of these groups [1,47] or between them
(see Eugene Koonin's review below). In our opinion
reaching a consensus on a root within the Bacteria would
be a big step forward.
While the authors clearly show that the evidence provided
by Lake et al. is insufficient to exclude the root from near
the Chloroflexi based on their improved analyses, there is
a logical fallacy at work in their conclusions. "We show
that all four of these arguments have flaws and that is evidence that Cavalier-Smith's rooting is probably correct" is
clearly a false dichotomy, as lack of evidence for the
former does not correspond to any increase of evidence
for the latter. The authors should have seriously considered (or at least discussed) the third possibility that there
is simply not enough indel-based information for a reliable rooting of the tree of life (except for its exclusion from
the archaeal/eukaryal branch).
Author's response
We disagree. The very nature of exclusive rooting is to
prove a branch of the tree has a derived trait. Therefore, it
is impossible to ever truly prove a rooting using this
method. If one cannot exclude a root using more and
more data our confidence in that rooting should increase.
Every argument that could (or has been claimed) to
exclude the root form the Chloroflexi but does not can be
taken as evidence that rooting is correct. To us this is the
first real independent test of Cavalier-Smith's hypothesis.
We never claim that indel-based data are enough to root
the tree. In fact we claim the opposite, since our PyrD quaternary structure argument goes against what some of the
indel data implies. Polarized indel arguments will be limited in nature since they require universal paralogs, but
their might be many polarizible transition in quaternary
structure. The position that there is not enough polarizing
data to root the tree was certainly defendable before this
work because there were numerous disagreements in the
data. We have resolved all of these, so for now it seems
there is enough polarizing data to reliably root the tree.
The 4 polarized arguments presented here are not enough
to root the tree reliably on their own. Our point is that
independent lines of reasoning are beginning to converge
on a single rooting. Its time to test (attack) CavalierSmith's rooting using every piece of reliable data out there
until it breaks. Then we think it would be worth discussing the possibility that there is not enough polarizable
data to root the tree of life.

An interesting and novel rooting approach is also presented, based on the quarternary structure of the PyrD
enzyme. Mapping the phylogenetic distribution of each
type of enzyme (monomer, homodimer, heterotetramer)
using the NCBI Protein Clusters Database, the authors
show that the most parsimonious path for the evolution

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/30

of these types (i.e., one of increasing subunit complexity)
effectively excludes the root from being within the
archaea, the firmicutes, or their most recent common
ancestor, and thus requires it to be within a bacterial nonfirmicute group (which contain the monomeric type,
PyrD2). However, a preliminary phylogenetic investigation shows that PyrD homologs which are present as a
homodimer (PyrD1A) are clearly a derived group within
the heteratetramer (Pyr1B) set most closely related to the
bacillus group within the firmicutes. Therefore, the presented parsimonious model of subunit evolution cannot
be made to agree with any possible rooting of the tree. A
more extensive phylogenetic analysis involving all PyrD
homologs is clearly needed before this character can be
used to exclude the root from any part of the tree.
Author's response
It is hard for us rebut a tree that we have not seen but here
goes. Our hypothesis on quaternary structure evolution is
not contradicted by our own analysis of the PyrD tree,
using HisA as outgroup (data not shown). We do not see
evidence that PyrD 1A is clearly derived from PyrD 1B.
Even if we did, we would still argue that result could be an
artifact. All 3 PyrD families are going to be under very different selective pressures since they each have different
protein-protein interaction sites. This is a case where it
would be completely possible for PyrD 1B to evolve rapidly out of PyrD 1A but look exactly as you described in
the sequence tree. It is possible that PyrD 1A is derived
from PyrD 1B, but until one provides an outgroup that
explains the origin of the heterotetramer we are not going
to find a sequence argument very convincing here.

This work is a reanalysis of several conserved paralogous
genes used by Lake et al. to place the root of the tree of life
based on indel sharing that were in apparent disagreement with a rooting proposed by Cavalier-Smith between
the Chloroflexi (Eobacteria) and the rest of bacterial +
archaeal groups. A key factor to attempt such analyses is
the quality of the alignment. Structural alignment data
shows that the analysis those paralogous genes based on
indels yields results that would be compatible with the
rooting proposed by Cavalier-Smith.
This work is interesting as it shows some of the drawbacks
that can be linked to this kind of indel analysis, particularly in what concerns ambiguous alignment and convergence. Yet, rooting the tree of life is a difficult task and
there is possibly too little information left in ancient
duplicated genes that allows answering that question with
meaningful statistical support. From the four sets of genes
Page 12 of 16

Biology Direct 2009, 4:30

studied here on a structural basis, two of them are discarded as unable to provide polarizing indel information:
S12/RpoC because they may not be homologous, and
Hsp70/MreB, which are inconclusive. The alignment of
EF-G/EF-Tu proteins is ambiguous at the indel region used
for polarization of character states, although quaternary
structure-based alignment was not possible. Only two
couples of paralogs yield what might be useful information according to Valas and Bourne, the HisA/HisF and
PyrD/HemE.
Author's response
We do not consider the PyrD/HemE indel argument to be
robust, but we reach the same conclusion using our polarization of quaternary structure. We also think the insert in
GyrA robustly excludes the root from within the Actinobacteria, but there was no need to reanalyze that result
here as with the other indels. We also accept the conclusion the EF-G/EF-Tu indel despite the problems with
aligning these sequences.

Though of interest, one can wonder whether this information is enough to confidently exclude the root of the tree
of life from everything outside the Chloroflexi. In addition of the alignment quality, there are other factors that
can be of crucial importance here. One is convergence, as
rightly pointed out by the authors, and the other is horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT is but very briefly mentioned here to exclude the possibility that PyrD has been
transferred between archaea and bacteria recently. However, other protein genes, notably gyrase and Hsp70 genes
are very likely cases of HGT from bacteria to archaea.
Despite so, they are included in this kind of indel work.
Careful phylogenetic analyses should be done for all the
genes that are included in these attempts so that only vertically inherited genes are used. The possibility of important HGT levels between Firmicutes and/or Actinobacteria
and archaea is not discarded. Finally, other problems such
as hidden paralogies or even selective paralog loss cannot
be excluded.
Author's response
It is true that everyone of these factors can mislead an
indel analysis. We are mainly trying to improve the alignment step for indel sets that appear to meet these criteria
to a reasonable level. Horizontal transfer of Hsp70 is irrelevant since this indel is not polarizable using an outgroup
regardless of its distribution within species. Gyrase has
probably been horizontally transferred, but it is clear from
looking at sequence alignments that the Actinobacterial
insert has not been transferred in a way that could confound the results. Horizontal transfers do not necessarily
destroy an indel argument, we just need to be careful
about whether they actually affect the conclusion or not.
If a derived trait is horizontally transferred to ancient

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/30

group the early branching members of that group will be
unaffected. Unless there is a selective sweep or poor sampling we should be able to identify these cases. One also
needs to keep in mind that horizontal transfers are
defined by our assumption of what the correct tree is. This
paper challenges the traditional rooting between the
Archaea and Bacteria so many horizontal transfers presented in the literature may actually be better explained by
vertical inheritance in this model. Loss is trickier since
inferring where a loss as opposed to a gain occurs requires
independent lines of polarization. We feel we are being
very conservative in only really accepting 3 indel polarizations that seem robust to these sources of noise.
Another comment is that the fact that these results are
compatible with a rooting between Chloroflexi/Eobacteria and anything else does not necessarily imply that the
root is actually close to these organisms. First, more than
50% of the bacterial phylum-level groups correspond to
candidate divisions without cultivated members. A similar trend occurs in archaea. Therefore, there is a considerable ignorance about the indel distribution in at least half
of the bacterial diversity. Also, though the most parsimonious scenarios appear more likely to us, this is not proof
that evolution proceeds that way. A cautionary vision
should be held in this regard.
Author's response
We agree that this work is certainly not the last word on
the rooting of the tree of life. As discussed above we feel
this work is a good test of independent lines of reasoning
to Cavalier-Smith's Eobacterial rooting. For now his
hypothesis seems to be the one to beat. We are open to
new data may change the picture, but the point of this
paper is that the present data does not contradict itself in
the manner it appears to in the current literature. There is
an important difference between parsimony and polarization. To us parsimony can be used to analyze events where
gain and loss have nearly equal probabilities, while polarizations imply that one direction would evolve more easily than the other. Consider the example of the
proteasome discussed in detail in [7]. A parsimony argument would be that the 20s proteasome is the result of a
duplication so a non duplicated structure must precede it.
The polarization argument involves considering the structure and function of proteasomes as well as the fitness of
the intermediates to argue that evolution towards the 20s
proteasome is much more plausible than the reverse
direction. There are probably many cases where evolution
has not been parsimonious, and we do not think parsimony is a safe or productive assumption. However, there
appears to be many polarizable transitions and hopefully
there are many more waiting to be discovered. If the new
data continues to support the Eobacterial rooting then our
confidence in it will increase.

Reviewer's report 3
Eugene V. Koonin, National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, USA

This manuscript addresses very important issues of the
position of the primary divide among eukaryotes and, by
implication, the relationships between archaea and bacteria, and the nature of the LUCA. The discussion is presented in somewhat obsolete terms of the "root of the tree
of life". As there is no such thing as a single "tree of life",
speaking of a single root is somewhat misleading but the
central question is nonetheless meaningful and crucial.
Author's response
We do not believe that the issue of the nature of the tree
of life has been settled. It is certainly true that recent work
has shown that there is too little signal to resolve the tree
of life using sequence alone [17,18], and that many genes
have histories distinct from the species in which they
reside. However, it is limiting to assume that the only data
useful for building the tree of life is sequence data, and
that additional data will be unworthy in this pursuit. We
are aware that tree representations have many shortcomings, but we still believe it is the single best metaphor to
describe the major events in evolution. We are working
with a novel data source to argue the tree of life is realer
than studies in genomics have led us to believe (in preparation). The phrase "root of the tree of life" may not be as
accurate as "the first polarizable transition between extant
groups", but it certainly rolls off the tongue better.

Without going into the minute details of the analysis of
indels in specific protein families, I will state my firm view
of this issue. The nature of the primary divide in prokaryotes – and actually among all cellular life forms is clear,
and it is between archaea and bacteria. This view is supported by the fundamental differences between archaeal
and bacterial systems of DNA replication, core transcription, translation, and membrane biogenesis – essentially,
all central cellular systems (not just the replication system
as noted in the present paper). I believe these differences
are sufficient to close the "root debate" (regardless of the
appropriateness or lack thereof of the very notion of a root
in this context) and to base analyses and discussions
aimed at the elucidation of the nature of LUCA on that
foundation.
Author's response
One cannot disagree with the fact there are vast differences between the Archaea and Bacteria, and we are well
aware of the details of that argument. We believe that
none of these differences are as great they appear at first
glance, and we are working on a scenario to detail the
transition between the Bacterial and Archaeal DNA repli-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/30

cation system. It certainly makes sense the greatest splits
in the tree would be the most ancient. However, we are
proposing that the alternative hypothesis that a unique
event in evolution occurred between the Bacteria and
Archaea must be taken seriously. A rooting between the
Archaea and Bacteria would imply the first Bacteria were
Gram-positive. As Cavalier-Smith pointed has pointed
out no one has adequately described how the transition
from a Gram-positive to a Gram-negative bacterium could
occur [7]. So the rooting you assume to be true has its own
problems too. Cavalier-Smith has already proposed a
detailed scenario that covers many of these transitions
you mention [24] and Lake et al. have recently discussed
the issue of membrane biogenesis [12]. That said there are
aspects of both of these hypotheses on the origin of the
Archaea that we feel are incomplete. At this point it seems
reasonable to keep an open mind about the root, but this
work argues against all evidence that has ever been used to
support a Gram-positive Bacterial rooting. Until there is a
scenario that describes all the major transitions starting
from the root that has been robustly tested by multiple
lines of evidence we suggest this debate is not over. We
think the data presented here offers a compelling reason
to continue to look at the details of the Gram-negative
rooting.
Indel analysis is a legitimate method of phylogenetic
inference but is seriously hampered not only by horizontal gene transfer but, more importantly, by the possibility
of homoplasy, that is, independent insertions in the same
region of homologous proteins. The contradicting macrophylogenetic inferences made by Lake, Cavalier-Smith,
Gupta and others using this approach serve to illustrate
the point. The use of structures to corroborate indels is, of
course, a good idea in principle but changes very little substantially. Somewhat parenthetically, I find it strange that
the alignments of this paper, aimed primarily at clarification of the relationship between archaea and bacteria,
include only bacterial and in some cases eukaryotic proteins.
Author's response
We disagree that this changes nothing substantial. Every
single disagreement between these different groups is, in
our view, caused by bad alignments. It appears to us the
only substantial difference between Gupta and CavalierSmith's phylogenies were based off of Gupta's polarization of the Mreb/Hsp70 indel, which we have demonstrated is inconclusive. This work has significantly
improved the quality of the alignments and resolved all
contradictions within these data sets. We hope this begins
to forge a consensus between them, and stimulates brain
storming on how the systems you mention above could
undergo such dramatic changes. In our opinion, one must
deal with the differences between the macro-phylogenies

one detail at a time instead of assuming they are a quixotic
pursuit. If these macro-phylogenies are truly incompatible
it should not be possible to get them to converge on a single tree as we believe we have done here. Again, it is true
that transfers and convergent evolution complicate indel
analysis, but they do not invalidate it a priori. Multiple
transitions are necessary to make a tree robust to these
problems. We have been very stringent in accepting an
indel as informative, so we are confident our conclusions
are not a result of these factors. Our analysis of PyrD demonstrates that our conclusion is not the result of horizontal transfer, and the clustering of PyrD 1B shows it is not
the result of convergent evolution. The distribution of this
derived structure across a Gram-positive group and the
Archaea must be considered seriously as evidence that the
root might not be between the Archaea and Bacteria. We
agree that it would be ideal to use more Archaeal structures in our alignments. However, we are limited by currently available crystal structures. At the present time it
appears very few people besides us are really considering
structure to be a useful tool in studying the major events
in evolution. Therefore there is no directed effort aimed at
widely sampling the same structure across the tree of life.
We believe this paper shows that structure has a role to
play in every aspect of studying the events that separate
the major taxa. The landscape of the continent of genomics is being filled in rapidly, but the continent of protein
structure, especially quaternary structure, lags far behind.
We are optimistic that structure may still contain enough
signal to resolve a single backbone to the tree of life where
sequence has failed.
