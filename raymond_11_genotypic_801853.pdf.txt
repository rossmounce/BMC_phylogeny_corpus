Abstract
Background: HIV-1 subtype D infections have been associated with rapid disease progression and phenotypic
assays have shown that CXCR4-using viruses are very prevalent. Recent studies indicate that the genotypic
algorithms used routinely to assess HIV-1 tropism may lack accuracy for non-B subtypes. Little is known about the
genotypic determinants of HIV-1 subtype D tropism.
Results: We determined the HIV-1 coreceptor usage for 32 patients infected with subtype D by both a
recombinant virus phenotypic entry assay and V3-loop sequencing to determine the correlation between them.
The sensitivity of the Geno2pheno10 genotypic algorithm was 75% and that of the combined 11/25 and net
charge rule was 100% for predicting subtype D CXCR4 usage, but their specificities were poor (54% and 68%). We
have identified subtype D determinants in the V3 region associated with CXCR4 use and built a new simple
genotypic rule for optimizing the genotypic prediction of HIV-1 subtype D tropism. We validated this algorithm
using an independent GenBank data set of 67 subtype D V3 sequences of viruses of known phenotype. The
subtype D genotypic algorithm was 68% sensitive and 95% specific for predicting X4 viruses in this data set,
approaching the performance of genotypic prediction of HIV-1 subtype B tropism.
Conclusion: The genotypic determinants of HIV-1 subtype D coreceptor usage are slightly different from those for
subtype B viruses. Genotypic predictions based on a subtype D-specific algorithm appear to be preferable for
characterizing coreceptor usage in epidemiological and pathophysiological studies.

Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enters
CD4-expressing cells using one or both of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 [1]. The receptor(s)
used by HIV-1 must be identified before a patient is
treated with CCR5 antagonists, as these drugs can only
be used against R5 viruses alone [2]. Recombinant virus
phenotypic entry assays have been widely used to determine HIV-1 tropism [3-5] but genotypic methods based
on the V3 sequence could be easier. Several studies indicate that the V3 genotype, combined with bioinformatic
algorithms, accurately predicts the phenotype of HIV-1
coreceptor usage for subtype B viruses [6-10]. But the
V3-based genotypic algorithms may be unsuitable for
predicting the tropism of non-B viruses because they
were built using genotype-phenotype correlation data
for subtype B viruses [9]. These algorithms can perform
differently, as was reported for HIV-1 subtype B [6,10].

The geno2pheno bioinformatic tool accurately predicts
subtype C HIV-1 tropism, but is relatively insensitive for
predicting CRF02 CXCR4 usage [11,12]. In contrast, the
simple rule combining 11/25 and net charge rules accurately predicts HIV-1 tropism for these particular non-B
subtypes. The predominant viruses in Uganda and
Sudan are subtype D [13]. These subtype D infections
are associated with a rapid loss of CD4 cells and disease
progression [14-18]. Various phenotypic assays have
been used to show that CXCR4-using viruses are very
prevalent among subtype D HIV-1 [19-21]. However, little is known about the genotypic determinants of the
virus’s subtype D tropism [20-23].
This study evaluates the performance of the genotypic
algorithms built for subtype B viruses for predicting
HIV-1 subtype D tropism. We determined subtype D
coreceptor usage with both genotypic and phenotypic
assays. The poor concordance between them led us to
look for genotypic criteria that could be used to predict
the coreceptor usage of subtype D viruses and to define
a new genotypic tool for this particular subtype. Lastly,

we checked the subtype D genotypic tool against a GenBank data set of subtype D viruses for which both the
V3 sequence and the entry phenotype were known.

relative light units; RLU). Minor X4 variants were
detected when they accounted for 0.5% or more of the
total population.

Methods

Genotypic prediction of HIV-1 coreceptor usage

Study subjects and samples

The V3 region was directly sequenced from bulk env
PCR products in both directions by the dideoxy chaintermination method (BigDye Terminator v3.1; Applied
Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) on an ABI 3130 DNA
sequencer. The two primer pairs used for sequencing
have been described [10]. Results were analyzed with
Sequencher (Genecodes, Ann Arbor, MI) by an operator
blinded to the phenotype. Minority species were
detected when the automated sequencer electropherogram showed a second base peak. Multiple alignments
were performed with CLUSTALW 1.83, and sequence
alignments were manually edited with BioEdit software.
Phylogenetic analyses excluded any possibility of sample
contamination (data not shown).
We used a combination of criteria from the 11/25 and
net charge rules to predict HIV-1 tropism from the V3
genotype [10]. One of the following criteria is required
for predicting CXCR4 coreceptor usage: (i) 11 R/K and/
or 25 K in V3; (ii) 25 R in V3 and a net charge of ≥ + 5;
(iii) a net charge of ≥ +6. The V3 net charge was calculated by subtracting the number of negatively charged
amino acids [D and E] from the number of positively
charged ones [K and R]. All possible permutations were
assessed when amino acid mixtures were found at some
codons of V3. The combination resulting in the highest
net charge was used to predict the tropism. We also
used the geno2pheno tool (with a false positive rate of
10%) to predict HIV-1 coreceptor usage. Geno2pheno is
available at http://coreceptor.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de/cgibin/coreceptor.pl (September 2010).

We studied 32 individuals infected with HIV-1 subtype
D recruited at the Department of Infectious Diseases of
Toulouse University Hospital, France and at the Department of Virology of Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital,
Paris, France. The median age of the patients was 42
years and 46% were men. The median HIV-1 virus load
was 4.91 log10 copies/ml (IQR [4.1-5.16]). The median
CD4 cell count was 355 cells/mm3 (IQR [208.7-634])
and the percentage of CD4 cells was 17% (IQR [1019.5]). All viruses were identified as HIV-1 subtype D by
analysis of the env sequence using the NCBI genotyping
tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genotyping/
formpage.cgi). We confirmed that these viruses belonged
to the subtype D by neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of the sequences studied here, together with HIV-1
subtype reference sequences from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/
index).
GenBank data set of HIV-1 subtype D viruses

The V3 sequences of HIV-1 subtype D viruses whose
entry phenotype was known were selected from the GenBank database. We selected sequences resulting from
bulk sequencing or one sequence per patient in the case
of clonal analysis. The entry phenotype of the 67 subtype
D viruses had been determined with the MT2 assay or
with the Trofile® assay (Monogram, Biosciences).
Phenotypic characterization of HIV-1 coreceptor usage

We determined the HIV-1 tropism with the TTT phenotypic assay [3]. Briefly, a fragment encompassing the
gp120 and the ectodomain of gp41 was amplified by
RT-PCR using HIV-1 RNA isolated from the plasma or
by PCR from HIV-1 DNA taken from PBMCs. The PCR
products then underwent nested PCR. Two amplifications were performed in parallel on aliquots of each
sample; the amplified products were then pooled to prevent sampling bias of the virus population.
The phenotype of HIV-1 coreceptor usage was determined using a recombinant virus entry assay with the
pNL43-Δenv-Luc2 vector. 293T cells were co-transfected with NheI-linearized pNL43-Δenv-Luc2 vector
DNA and the product of the nested PCR obtained from
the challenged HIV-1-containing sample. The chimeric
recombinant virus particles released into the supernatant were used to infect U87 indicator cells bearing CD4
and either CCR5 or CXCR4. Virus entry was assessed
by measuring the luciferase activity in lysed cells (as

Cloning of env PCR products

The env PCR products from three patients were subjected to clonal analysis using a TOPO-TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen). Plasmids DNA containing env inserts were
sequenced in the V3 region using the primers previously
described [10].
Statistical methods

The kappa coefficient was measured using STATA SE
9.2 to assess agreement between the genotypic algorithms for HIV-1 tropism prediction and the phenotypic
assay. The correlation between two tests is usually considered good when the kappa coefficient is superior to
0.60 with p < 0.05.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The sequences reported here have been given GenBank
accession numbers HQ906854-HQ906879.

26 patients. The combined 11/25 and net charge rule
predicted 15 R5 viruses and 11 X4 viruses, but 7 of
them were mis-predicted as X4. Geno2pheno10 predicted 13 R5 viruses and 13 X4 viruses (10 were mispredicted as X4). As summarized in Table 1 geno2pheno10 was 75% sensitive and 54% specific and the
combined rule was 100% sensitive and 68% specific for
predicting CXCR4-usage by HIV-1 subtype D. The
concordance between the genotypic and phenotypic
approaches was 58% with geno2pheno10 and 73% with
the combined rule (Table 1).

Results
Phenotypic characterization of HIV-1 subtype D viruses

The env products from the plasma sample of 27 of the
32 subtype D-infected patients were successfully amplified by PCR. The phenotype of receptor-mediated entry
was then successfully determined for each of these 27
patients. We found 23 virus populations with an R5
phenotype, 2 virus populations with a dual/mixed R5X4
phenotype, and 2 virus populations with a pure X4
phenotype.

Figure 1 V3 amino acid sequence alignments and matched phenotypes of the 26 subtype D viruses (1a) and of 13 reference subtype
B viruses (1b). V3 amino acid sequence alignments were obtained by bulk sequencing env PCR products from the 26 subtype D-infected
patients, 10 subtype B-infected patients and 3 reference subtype B viruses. These sequences are shown with the following abbreviations with
reference to the consensus sequences: dot, identity with amino acid baseline sequence; dash, gap inserted to maintain alignment; slash, amino
acid position related to dual virus population. Replacements are indicated by the appropriate code letters. Residues at positions 11 and 25 and
mutated N-linked glycosylation sites are boxed to highlight the substitutions noted. The V3 net charge (calculated by subtracting the number of
negatively charged amino acids [D and E] from the number of positively charged ones [K and R]); the number of amino acids in V3; the
genotype predicted by the combined 11/25 and net charge rules built for subtype B viruses and the Geno2pheno are shown, together with the
observed phenotype. Discordances between the genotypic predictions and the phenotype are boxed.

shown in Figure 1b[24,25]. One virus had an arginine
(R) at position 25 with a net charge at +6 and had an
R5X4 phenotype (Figure 1a and Table 2). Eleven viruses
had no “R” or “K” at positions 11 or 25, net charges <
+5, and R5 phenotypes. Five viruses each had a lysine
(K) at position 25 with a net charge < +5, four of which
had an R5 phenotype and only one of which had an
R5X4 phenotype. Two viruses each had a K at position
25 with a net charge of +5 and were phenotyped as R5.
We studied different clones from the HIV-1 quasispecies
of three patients harboring R5 virus populations on bulk
phenotypic analysis but predicted to be X4 by the bulk
genotypic analysis when using the algorithms built for
subtype B viruses. All the clones successfully phenotyped were R5 and had a lysine (K) at position 25 with
net charges comprised between +1 and +4 (Figure 2).
Thus, HIV-1 subtype D viruses frequently have a lysine
at position 25 and viruses use exclusively CCR5 for
entry when this amino acid is associated with a V3 net
charge ≤ +5.

*The two viruses harboring an arginine at position 11 have also an arginine at
position 25.

We, therefore, designed a genotypic rule based on the
11/25 and net charge rules for determining the tropism
of HIV-1 subtype D. One of the following criteria was
required for predicting subtype D CXCR4 coreceptor
usage: (i) R or K at position 11 of V3; (ii) R at position
25 of V3 and a net charge of ≥ +5; (iii) a net charge of
≥ +6. The genotypic and phenotypic approaches using
this rule were 92% concordant (Table 3). This subtype
D genotypic algorithm was 75% sensitive and 95% specific with our data set.
Validation of the subtype D genotypic algorithm on an
independent data set

The GenBank dataset of subtype D viruses included 25
R5X4/X4 viruses and 42 R5 viruses based on phenotypic
assays. We analyzed phylogenetically the GenBank V3
sequences and the 26 V3 sequences from patients (Figure 3). We predicted the tropism of these viruses with
the initially validated combined rule [10], with the geno2pheno tool and with the subtype D genotypic algorithm based on the simple 11/25 and net charge rules
(Table 4). The concordance between genotypic and phenotypic determinations was 69% with the combined rule
and 67% with geno2pheno10. The concordance
increased to 85% using the subtype D genotypic algorithm. The subtype D tool was 68% sensitive and 95%
specific for detecting CXCR4-using viruses. Geno2pheno10 was the most sensitive tool (96%) but its specificity was poor (50%).

Discussion
HIV-1 subtype D infections have been associated with
rapid disease progression [14-16,18] and a high prevalence of CXCR4-using viruses according to phenotypic
assays [19-21]. A genotypic assay for determining subtype D tropism would be useful for investigating the
pathogenesis of this subtype and for facilitating the clinical use of CCR5 antagonists. But recent studies indicate
that the genotypic algorithms currently used are relatively insensitive for non-B subtypes, although their performance for particular subtypes was not specifically

Figure 2 Clonal analysis of the virus populations of three patients whose genotypic prediction and phenotype were discordant. Clonal
composition of the HIV-1 quasispecies of three patients harboring R5 phenotyped viruses mispredicted X4 by the genotypic algorithms built for
subtype B viruses. V3 amino acid sequence alignments were obtained by sequencing molecular clones of env PCR products. Theses sequences
are shown with the following abbreviations with reference to the direct sequence: dot, identity with amino acid baseline sequence; dash, gap
inserted to maintain alignment; slash, amino acid position related to dual virus population. Replacements are indicated by the appropriate code
letters. Residues at positions 11 and 25 are boxed to highlight the substitutions noted. The V3 net charge (calculated by subtracting the number
of negatively charged amino acids [D and E] from the number of positively charged ones [K and R]); the number of amino acids in V3; the

specific (54% to 68%, respectively) for predicting CXCR4
use by subtype D viruses. One previous study of the performance of two genotypic algorithms for determining
subtype D tropism reported poor specificity, 74% for the
11 RK/25 K rule and 53% for the PSSM algorithm [20].
We therefore analyzed the V3-loop sequences and the
corresponding phenotype of these subtype D viruses.
We found that the lysine at position 25 is a polymorphic
amino acid in HIV-1 subtype D and should not be considered as a determinant of CXCR4 usage for this particular subtype, in the contrary with subtype B viruses.
We confirmed this polymorphism at a clonal level on
three virus populations phenotyped R5. The V1-V2 env
region may also influence the virus tropism [27-29]. A
recent study found that analysis of the V2-V3 region

determined [9]. We have now analyzed the correlations
between phenotypic and genotypic approaches for determining HIV-1 subtype D tropism.
The prevalence of X4 viruses estimated in 26 patients
with the TTT phenotypic assay was 15%. The TTT
assay has previously been validated on B and non-B subtypes and correlated well with the enhanced sensitive
Trofile assay [3,26]. The scarcity of CXCR4-using
viruses in these patients could be because they were at a
different stage of the disease compared to the patients
recruited in Uganda and Sudan in previous studies
[19-21]. The genotypic determination of HIV-1 tropism
with algorithms built for the subtype B were adequately
sensitive (75% with geno2pheno10 and 100% with the
combined 11/25 and net charge rules), but were poorly

slightly improved the sensitivity for predicting CXCR4
usage compared to analysis of V3 alone [30]. However,
we previously analyzed the V1 and V2 regions of subtype B viruses and found no criteria that improved the
genotypic prediction [8]. For subtype D viruses, no genotypic determinant has been identified in the V1-V2
region that improves the performance of the genotypic
approaches (data not shown). The determinants identified for predicting CXCR4 usage by subtype D viruses
were combined in a simple genotypic rule that differed
slightly from the combined rule validated for subtype B,
C and CRF02-AG [10-12]. The concordance between
the subtype D genotypic rule and the TTT (kappa coefficient: 0.70) was better than that for the subtype B tools
(kappa coefficients: 0.15-0.40). The sensitivity of the
subtype D genotypic rule (75%) was similar to that of
the subtype B genotypic algorithms, applied to subtype
B viruses to determine tropism (69 to 88%) [10].
One limit of the study was the small number of X4
viruses in our patients (4/26). However, R5 viruses with
an X4 genotype using current algorithms were very
informative and analysis of our dataset enabled us to
propose a new interpretation rule for HIV-1 subtype D
tropism. This new rule was subsequently validated by
examination of a GenBank set of 67 subtype D V3
sequences belonging to viruses whose phenotype was
known. The best concordance with the phenotype was
obtained with the subtype D combined rule (sensitivity
68%, specificity 95%), giving a good agreement with the
phenotypic assay (kappa coefficient of 0.63). This specific genotypic algorithm predicted HIV-1 tropism better
than did the MT2 or Trofile phenotypic assays (data not
shown). The specificity of the V3 genotype is important
for not excluding patients eligible for antiretroviral
treatment based on a CCR5 antagonist and for epidemiological and pathophysiological studies. The specificity of the V3 genotype is also crucial for accurate
characterization of HIV-1 quasispecies by ultra-deep

detecting CXCR4-using viruses.

Conclusion
The combined rule with criteria from the 11/25 and net
charge rules modified for subtype D HIV-1 performed
well for predicting the tropism of this particular subtype.
Simple genotypic methods could make it easier to determine the impact of virus tropism on disease progression
and to facilitate the clinical use of CCR5 antagonists.
Further studies are now needed to optimize the various
genotypic algorithms for predicting the tropism of other
HIV-1 non-B subtypes.
