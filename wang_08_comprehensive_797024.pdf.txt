Abstract
Background: Single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors are critical components of the lateral
inhibition machinery that mediates epidermal cell patterning in plants. Sequence analysis of the
Arabidopsis genome using the BLAST program reveals that there are a total of six genes, including
TRIPTYCHON (TRY), CAPRICE (CPC), TRICHOMELESS1 (TCL1), and ENHANCER of TRY and CPC 1, 2,
and 3 (ETC1, ETC2 and ETC3) encoding single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors that are
approximately 50% identical to one another at the amino acid level. Previous studies indicate that
these single-repeat R3 MYBs regulate epidermal cell patterning. However, each of the previous
studies of these single-repeat R3 MYBs has been limited to an analysis of only a subset of these six
genes, and furthermore, they have limited their attention to epidermal development in only one or
two of the organs. In addition, the transcriptional regulation of these single-repeat R3 MYB genes
remains largely unknown.
Results: By analyzing multiple mutant lines, we report here that TCL1 functions redundantly with
other single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors to control both leaf trichome and root hair
formation. On the other hand, ETC1 and ETC3 participate in controlling trichome formation on
inflorescence stems and pedicles. Further, we discovered that single-repeat R3 MYBs suppress
trichome formation on cotyledons and siliques, organs that normally do not bear any trichomes.
By using Arabidopsis protoplast transfection assays, we found that all single-repeat R3 MYBs
examined interact with GL3, and that GL1 or WER and GL3 or EGL3 are required and sufficient
to activate the transcription of TRY, CPC, ETC1 and ETC3, but not TCL1 and ETC2. Furthermore,
only ETC1's transcription was greatly reduced in the gl3 egl3 double mutants.
Conclusion: Our comprehensive analysis enables us to draw broader conclusions about the role
of single-repeat R3 MYB gene family than were possible in the earlier studies, and reveals the
genetic basis of organ-specific control of trichome formation. Our findings imply the presence of
multiple mechanisms regulating the transcription of single-repeat R3 MYB genes, and provide new
insight into the lateral inhibition mechanism that mediates epidermal cell patterning.

Background
There are a total of six genes in the Arabidopsis genome
that encode a unique subfamily of MYB transcription factors, namely single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors.
These transcription factors, including TRIPTYCHON
(TRY) [1,2], CAPRICE (CPC) [3], TRICHOMELESS1
(TCL1) [4], ENHANCER of TRY and CPC 1, 2, and 3
(ETC1, ETC2 and ETC3 (CPL3)) [5-9], are characterized
by their short sequence (75–112 amino acids) and consist
largely of the single MYB domain (e.g. without other predicted motifs). It is generally believed that these singlerepeat R3 MYB transcription factors mediate lateral inhibition during epidermal patterning. In general, these single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors act as negative
regulators for trichome formation in shoots, but as positive regulators for root hair formation in roots.
T-DNA insertion mutants are available for each of these
six single-repeat R3 MYB genes. Among them, only single
loss-of-function mutants for TRY, CPC and TCL1 display
major defects in trichome and/or root hair cell specification [1-4], whereas loss-of-function alleles of ETC1, ETC2
or ETC3 cause little or no phenotypic effect [5-9]. The
analysis of double and triple mutants indicated that ETC1
and ETC3 can function redundantly with TRY and CPC to
control leaf trichome and root hair formation [5,6,9], and
that ETC2 functions redundantly with TRY and CPC to
control trichome formation on petioles [7]. Further, CPC
functions redundantly with TCL1 to control trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels [4]. However, a role of TCL1 in leaf trichome and root hair
formation has not been established.
Available evidence suggests that single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors, a WD40-repeat protein, TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) [10,11], an R2R3 MYB-type
transcription factor, GLABRA1 (GL1) [12] or WEREWOLF
(WER) [13-15], a bHLH transcription factor, GLABRA3
(GL3) or ENHANCER OF GLABRA3 (EGL3) [16,17], and
a homeodomain protein, GLABRA2 (GL2) [18,19], regulate trichome and/or root hair formation (reviewed in
[20-22]). Based on the results of yeast-two-hybrid interaction assays, it has been proposed that TTG1, GL1 or WER,
and GL3 or EGL3 form an activator complex to induce
GL2 expression [16]. The single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors are proposed to move from a trichome precursor cell to its neighboring cell (in the shoot epidermis) or
from an N cell to an H cell (in the root epidermis) to compete with GL1 or WER for binding GL3 or EGL3, thus limiting the activity of the activator complex [2,3,20-24].
Recently, we showed that one of the single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors, TCL1, can directly suppress the transcription of GL1 [4], providing an additional loop of regulation of the activity of the proposed activator complex
by single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/81

It has been proposed that the same activator complex that
activates GL2 can also activate the expression of singlerepeat R3 MYB genes (reviewed in [20-22]), but so far
only CPC has been identified as a direct target gene for
WER [25,26], and GL3 has been shown to be recruited to
the promoter region of CPC and ETC1 [27].
To gain new insight into the role of single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors in controlling epidermal development, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the singlerepeat R3 MYB gene family. By generating and analyzing
higher order mutants among six single-repeat R3 MYB
genes, we identified previously unrecognized roles of single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors in the regulation
of trichome and root hair formation. We demonstrate that
TCL1 participates in the control of leaf trichome and root
hair formation, and that ETC1 and ETC3 have a role in
regulating trichome formation on the inflorescence stems
and pedicles. We also discover that single-repeat R3 MYBs
normally suppress trichome formation on siliques and
cotyledons. By using an Arabidopsis protoplast transfection system, we show that cotransfection of GL1 or WER,
with GL3 or EGL3, is sufficient to activate the transcription of TRY, CPC, ETC1 and ETC3, but not ETC2 and
TCL1. Our results suggest that although the six singlerepeat R3 MYB genes have largely overlapping functions
in controlling epidermal development, the transcriptional
regulation of these single-repeat R3 MYB genes involves
distinct mechanisms.

Results
Single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors in Arabidopsis
Sequence analysis of the Arabidopsis genome using the
BLAST program http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ with the
entire amino acid sequence of TCL1 reveals that there are
a total of six genes, including TRY, CPC, TCL1, ETC1,
ETC2 and ETC3, encoding single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors that are approximately 50% identical to one
another at the amino acid level. These six genes are unevenly distributed in four of the five chromosomes of Arabidopsis (Figure 1A). Among them, ETC2 (At2g30420)
and TCL1 (At2g30432) are tandem genes located in chromosome II (Figure 1A). The amino acid signature [D/E]L
× 2 [R/K] × 3L × 6L × 3R [28] that has been shown to be
required for interacting with R/B-like bHLH transcription
factors is completely conserved in all single-repeat R3
MYB transcription factors (Figure 1B). The amino acids
within the MYB domain that have been shown to be crucial for the cell-to-cell movement of CPC [29] are also
entirely conserved in all single-repeat R3 MYBs (Figure
1B). Phylogenetic analysis using the entire amino acid
sequence suggested that these six single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors can be divided into two groups, with
TCL1, ETC1, ECT3 and CPC in group I, and TRY and ETC2
in group II (Figure 1C).

TCL1 affects both leaf trichome and root hair formation
Among the six single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors,
TRY and CPC have been shown to be involved in both leaf
trichome and root hair formation [1-3,30], while ETC1
can function redundantly with TRY and CPC to control
leaf trichome and root hair formation [5,6] and ETC2
functions redundantly with TRY and CPC to control trichome formation on petioles [7]. Recently, it has been
shown that ETC3 functions redundantly with singlerepeat R3 MYBs to regulate both trichome and root hair
formation [9]. However, a role of TCL1 in leaf trichome
and root hair formation has not been established,
although previously, we showed that TCL1 controls trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicles

[4]. To test if TCL1 participates in the control of leaf trichome and root hair formation, we generated double, triple and quadruple mutants among all single-repeat R3
MYB genes in group I including TCL1, ETC1, ETC3 and
CPC (Figure 1C). Consistent with previous report [2], the
cpc single mutant has significantly increased trichome
number on leaves (Figure 2A, Table 1). All other single
mutants of group I genes examined are indistinguishable
from wild-type plants (Table 1). We found that although
double and triple mutants including cpc (e.g. cpc etc1 etc3)
are similar to the cpc single mutant, and double and triple
mutants between etc1, etc3, and tcl1 are similar to wild
type (Table 1), the cpc etc1 etc3 tcl1 quadruple mutant has
dramatically increased trichome number on leaves than

cpc single mutant and cpc etc1 etc3 triple mutant (Figure
2A, Table 1), indicating that TCL1 is involved in the regulation of leaf trichome formation.
Subsequently, we examined root hair formation in these
mutants. As shown in Figure 2B and Table 2, cpc single
mutant had reduced root hair formation, consistent with
previous reports [3,30]. Compared with the cpc single
mutant, the cpc etc1 etc3 triple mutant produced fewer
root hairs (Figure 2B, Table 2). Moreover, cpc etc1 etc3 tcl1
quadruple mutant produced significantly fewer root hairs
than cpc etc1 etc3 triple mutant (Figure 2B, Table 2), indicating that TCL1 also participates in the regulation of root
hair formation.
ETC1 and ETC3 participate in the control of trichome
formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicles
Previously, we reported that TCL1 is a major regulator of
trichome formation on the inflorescence stem and pedicels because tcl1 single mutants displayed ectopic trichome formation on pedicels, and trichome formation on
inflorescence stems was no longer restricted to the internodes before the first flower [4]. No other single mutant

of the single-repeat R3 MYB gene family displayed ectopic
trichome formation on the inflorescence stems or pedicels. We have previously shown that CPC acts synergistically with TCL1 to control trichome formation on these
organs [4]. In this study, we wanted to further investigate
if any other single-repeat R3 MYBs can also regulate trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels.
We examined trichome formation on the inflorescence
stems and pedicles in the double, triple and quadruple
mutants of all single-repeat R3 MYB genes in group I
including TCL1, ETC1, ETC3 and CPC. Compared with
the tcl1 single mutant or the cpc tcl1 double mutant, cpc
etc1 etc3 tcl1 quadruple mutants have more internodes
bearing trichomes (Figure 3A) and more pedicels forming
ectopic trichomes (Figure 3B). In addition, ectopic trichome formation was also found on the pedicels of the
cpc etc1 etc3 triple mutants (Figure 3B, Figure 4A). Unlike
the tcl1 mutant, whose trichomes are evenly distributed
along pedicels, trichomes tend to form at both ends of the
pedicels of the cpc etc1 etc3 mutant (Figure 4A). These
results supported the notion that TCL1 is the major regulator of the single-repeat R3 MYB family controlling tri-

formed on the siliques (Figure 4B). Second, ectopic trichomes were formed on the cotyledons of try cpc etc1 etc3
tcl1 quintuple mutant (Figure 4C). Because these organs
in wild-type plants do not bear any trichomes, these
results indicated that single-repeat R3 MYB transcription
factors normally suppress trichome formation on these
organs and acts in a highly redundant manner.

chome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels,
and that CPC, ETC1 and ETC3 participate in the control of
trichome formation on those organs.
Single-repeat R3 MYBs function redundantly to control
trichome formation on siliques and cotyledons
Having generated quadruple mutants with combination
of loss-of-function mutations in all group I members of
single-repeat R3 MYB genes, including CPC, ETC1, TCL1
and ETC3, we sought to generate higher order mutants.
The group II small MYBs contains two members, TRY and
ETC2 (Figure 1C). As discussed above, ETC2 (At2g30420)
and TCL1 (At2g30432) are tandem genes located in the
chromosome II (Figure 1A), which inhibits the generation
of sextuple mutants that contain loss-of-function mutations in all six single-repeat R3 MYB genes through classical crosses. Therefore, in this study, the highest order
mutant we generated was a quintuple mutant contains
loss-of-function mutations in all four members of group I
and TRY of group II of the single-repeat R3 MYB gene family.

By analyzing the try cpc etc1 etc3 tcl1 quintuple mutant and
other mutants, we made two discoveries. First, in try cpc
etc1 tcl1 quadruple mutants, ectopic trichomes were

Single-repeat R3 MYBs function redundantly to control
trichome cluster formation on leaves and inflorescence
stems
Among all single mutants of the single-repeat R3 MYB
genes, only the try mutant displays significant trichome
clusters on leaves and shoots [1,2]. We wanted to examine
whether other single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors
function redundantly with TRY to control trichome spacing. Consistent with that reported previously [6], the size
of the trichome clusters on leaves increased significantly
from the try cpc double mutant to the try cpc etc1 triple
mutant (Figure 5A). We found that the size of trichome
clusters on leaves was further increased in the try cpc etcl
tcl1 quadruple mutant (Figure 5A), suggesting that TCL1
also contributes to the control of trichome spacing on
leaves.

We also found that etc3-1 mutation can increase trichome
cluster frequency in cpc mutant background. As shown in
Table 1, the cpc, etc1, tcl1, and etc3 single mutants are similar to wild type in term of trichome cluster formation.
However, in the cpc etc3 double mutant, about 1.2% of its
trichomes are in clusters, and the number of trichome
clusters was increased to about 7% in cpc etc1 etc3, and
about 16% in cpc etc1 etc3 tcl1 (Table 1). These results supported the notion that TRY is the major regulator for controlling trichome cluster formation, and suggested that
other single-repeat R3 MYBs contribute to trichome cluster formation by functioning in a redundant manner.
Subsequently, we examined trichome cluster formation
on the inflorescence stems. As discussed earlier, TCL1 is a
major regulator of trichome formation on the inflorescence stems whereas TRY controls the formation of trichome cluster. As expected, extensive trichome clusters
were found on the inflorescence stems of try cpc etc1 tcl1
quadruple mutants (Figure 5B).
Single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors interact with
GL3 in plant cells
Our genetic analyses indicated that single-repeat R3 MYBs
regulate trichome and root hair formation in a highly
redundant manner. We next wished to study their mechanism of action in trichome and root hair formation. It has
been shown that some of these single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors, including TRY, CPC, ETC1, ETC2 and
ETC3, interact with GL3 in yeast cells [7,9,17,24,28]. This

MYB transcription factors to compete with GL1 for binding GL3, thus limiting the activity of TTG1-GL3/EGL3GL1/WER activator complex and inhibiting trichome formation and promoting root hair formation [20-23].
Although TCL1 is likely to behave similarly as TRY, CPC,
ETC1, ETC2 and ETC3, a direct test of the interactions
between TCL1 and GL3 has not been performed. Further,
the interactions in yeast cells (e.g. interaction between
GL3 and TRY, CPC, ETC1, ETC2 or ETC3) have not been
confirmed in plant cells. Therefore, in this study, we tested
the interactions between GL3 and each of these six singlerepeat R3 MYB transcription factors using a plant twohybrid protein-protein interaction system [31].
A Gal4-GUS reporter, together with the effectors GL3 and
a Gal4 DNA binding domain (GD) fused single-repeat R3
MYB transcription factor (Figure 6A), were co-transfected
into Arabidopsis protoplasts. Although single-repeat R3
MYB transcription factors can be recruited to the promoter
region of the reporter gene by GD, they alone cannot activate the expression of the reporter gene due to the lack of
a transcription-activating domain. Activation of reporter

expression can occur if the small MYB protein interacts
with GL3, because GL3 can function as a transcriptional
activator (data not shown). Indeed, TRY, CPC, ETC1,
ETC2 and ETC3 interacted with GL3 in plant cells (Figure
6B), consistent with the results reported in yeast cells
[7,9,17,24,28]. Using this system, we also showed that
TCL1 is able to interact with GL3 (Figure 6B). Thus, all six
single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors can interact
with GL3 in plant cells, implying that GL3 binding may
represent a general mechanism of single-repeat R3 MYB
action in inhibiting the activity of the TTG1-GL3/EGL3GL1 activator complex.
Transcriptional regulation of single-repeat R3 MYB genes
It has been proposed that the TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1 activator complex in shoots not only promotes the transcription of GL2, but also promotes the transcription of singlerepeat R3 MYB genes, and a similar mechanism has been
proposed to operate in roots with WER replacing GL1
(reviewed in [20-22]). In support of this view, GL3 has
been shown to be recruited to the promoter region of CPC
and ETC1 [27], and CPC has been identified as a direct target gene for WER [26].

To investigate whether activation of single-repeat R3 MYB
genes by the TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1/WER complex represents a general regulatory mechanism, we used an Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast transfection system [32,33].
This system has been successfully used to elucidate the
regulatory roles of many other transcription factors [34–
38). First, we examined the expression of each component
of the activator complex in Arabidopsis rosette leaf mesophyll protoplasts. We found that TTG1, WER, GL1, GL3

and EGL3 transcripts were undetectable by RT-PCR in
wild-type protoplasts, whereas all of them were expressed
in the whole seedlings (Figure 7A). These results indicated
that Arabidopsis rosette leaf mesophyll protoplasts are
suitable for the study of transcriptional activity of these
activator complexes by transfection assays because the
potential interferences by the endogenous TTG1, WER,
GL1, GL3 and EGL3 are minimized. We also found that
the basal transcript level of TRY was highest among all single-repeat R3 MYB genes in untransfected protoplasts (Figure 7B). In a preliminary test using Arabidopsis
protoplasts from wild-type, we found that GL1 and GL3

are required and sufficient to induce the expression of
CPC (data not shown). Therefore, in order to simplify our
cotransfection assays, we decided to use protoplasts prepared from ttg1 mutant rosette leaves to test the activation
of single-repeat R3 MYB genes by the GL3/EGL3-GL1 or
GL3/EGL3-WER activator complex. To further ensure that
the elimination of TTG1 would not impair the transcriptional activity of the activator complex, we compared the
transcriptional activation of single-repeat R3 MYB genes
by GL1+GL3 or TTG1+GL1+GL3. We found that the
GL1+GL3
combination
was
as
effective
as
TTG1+GL1+GL3 to activate the transcription of the singlerepeat R3 MYB genes (Figure 7B). By using this system, we
found that none of the components in the proposed activator complexes alone could activate the transcription of
any single-repeat R3 MYB genes (Figure 7B). However,
GL1 or WER together with GL3 or EGL3 were sufficient to
activate the transcription of TRY, CPC, ETC1 and ETC3,
but not TCL1 and ETC2 (Figure 7B). These results indi-

cated that some, but not all, single-repeat R3 MYB genes
are induced by the proposed activator complexes.
To further investigate if those four single-repeat R3 MYB
genes activated by the GL1-GL3/EGL3 or WER-GL3/EGL3
complex, including TRY, CPC, ETC1 and ETC3, are tightly
regulated by the activator complexes, we examined the
expression of these genes in the gl3 egl3 double mutant
background. We reasoned that if these single-repeat R3
MYB genes are solely regulated by these activator complexes, their expression would be dramatically reduced in
gl3 egl3 double mutant due to the disruption of the activator complexes. Surprisingly, we found that among these
four single-repeat R3 MYB genes, ETC1 was the only gene

whose transcript was dramatically reduced in the gl3 egl3
double mutant (Figure 7C). In order to more accurately
compare the transcript level of TRY, CPC and ETC3
between wild-type and gl3 egl3 mutant, we used quantitative real-time PCR to quantify the transcript level of these
genes. The results from quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that there is no difference in the transcript level of
TRY and ETC3 between wild-type and gl3 egl3 mutant
whereas the transcript level of CPC was only weakly
reduced (about 20% reduction) in gl3 egl3 mutant.

Overlapping functions of single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors in regulating trichome and root hair
formation
The six single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors in Arabidopsis are highly similar to each other at the amino acid
level (Figure 1B). However, among these six single-repeat
R3 MYB genes, only single mutants of TRY, CPC and TCL1
displayed major phenotypes in epidermal cell development [1-4], whereas single mutants of ETC1, ETC2 and
ETC3 are largely indistinguishable from wild-type plants
[5-8]. Further, the phenotypes of try, cpc and tcl1 single
mutants are distinct. try mutant displays characteristic trichome clusters in leaves [1,2], cpc mutant has increased
trichome formation on leaves and had decreased root hair
formation [2,3], whereas tcl1 mutant produces ectopic trichomes on inflorescence stems and pedicels [4]. These
findings suggested that TRY is a major regulator regulating
trichome cluster formation, CPC is a major regulator regulating root hair and trichome formation, whereas TCL1
is a major regulator regulating trichome formation on
inflorescence stems and pedicels. Available evidence suggested that single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors can
also function redundantly to regulate trichome and root
hair formation [2,4-9]. Each of those previous studies of
these single-repeat R3 MYBs has been limited to an analysis of only a subset of these six genes, and furthermore,
they have limited their attentions to epidermal development in only one or two of these organs. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the roles of singlerepeat R3 MYB transcription factors in trichome and root
hair formation. Our comprehensive analysis enables us to
draw broader conclusions about the role of this gene family than were possible in the earlier studies.

Mutants generated including the cpc etc1 etc3 tcl1 quadruple mutant containing loss-of-function mutations in all
members of group I single-repeat R3 MYB genes, and the
try cpc etc1 etc3 tcl1 quintuple mutant. By analyzing these
single, double, triple, quadruple and quintuple mutants,
we made several new discoveries. First, we established a
role for TCL1 in controlling leaf trichome formation and
root hair formation (Figure 2, Table 1, Table 2). TCL1 has
been shown to be a major regulator of the single-repeat R3
MYB family controlling trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels [4], but a role of TCL in controlling trichome formation on leaves and root hair
formation had not been previously established. Second,
we established a role for ETC1 and ETC3 in controlling trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicles
(Figure 3). We note that a recent study showed that a different allele of etc3, called cpl3-1, was shown to produce
about 80% more trichomes and 20% fewer root hairs than
wild-type [9], which may be due to an allele-specific difference in etc3 effect. Third, we found that mutations in

Page 9 of 13

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:81

TCL1, ETC1 and ETC3 can increase leaf trichome cluster
frequency in cpc mutant background (Table 1). About
16% of the trichomes formed in clusters in the cpc tcl1 etc1
etc3 quadruple mutant (Table 1). Working together with
TRY, they also control trichome cluster formation on the
inflorescence stems (Figure 5). Finally, we demonstrated
that in addition to regulating trichome formation on
leaves and inflorescence stems, single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors also regulate trichome formation on cotyledons and siliques (Figure 4). Because these organs
normally do not bear any trichomes, these results suggested that single-repeat R3 MYBs normally suppress trichome formation on these organs in a highly redundant
manner.
Mechanism of the action of single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors in the regulation of trichome and root
hair formation
The six single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors are
approximately 50% identical to each other at the amino
acid level (Figure 1B). More importantly, these six singlerepeat R3 MYB transcription factors contain the amino
acid signature [D/E]L × 2 [R/K] × 3L × 6L × 3R that has
been shown to be required for interacting with R/B-like
bHLH transcription factors [28] (Figure 1B). Further, the
amino acids within the MYB domain that have been
shown to be crucial for cell-to-cell movement of CPC protein [29] are also entirely conserved in all six single-repeat
R3 MYB transcription factors (Figure 1B). These results
implied that all single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors
have the potential to act in a similar manner by moving
from cell to cell to compete with GL1 for binding GL3,
thereby limiting the activity of the TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1/
WER activator complex to regulate trichome and/or root
hair formation. Five of these six single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors, including TRY, CPC, ETC1, ETC2
and ETC3, have been previously shown to interact with
GL3 in yeast cells [7,9,17,24,28]. Here we showed that all
of these six single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors
interact with GL3 in plant cells (Figure 6), supporting that
competition mechanism between single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors and GL1 for binding GL3 [20-23].
These results suggested that single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors may mediate lateral inhibition in epidermal cell patterning by a general mechanism: competing
with GL1 for binding GL3 to reduce the activity of the
TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1 activator complexes. It remains to
be tested if all single-repeat R3 MYB transcription factors
can also directly suppress the expression of GL1 thus
inhibiting the formation of the TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1 activate complex, as has been demonstrated for TCL1 [4].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/81

Regulation of the transcription of single-repeat R3 MYB
genes
Previous studies suggested that the expression of singlerepeat R3 MYB genes is regulated by the TTG1-GL3/EGL3GL1 activator complex in shoots, and by the TTG1-GL3/
EGL3-WER activator complex in roots. These single-repeat
R3 MYB transcription factors move from a trichome precursor cell to its neighboring cell in shoots, or move from
an N cell to an H cell in roots, to compete with GL1 or
WER for binding GL3, thus limiting the activity of activator complexes [20-23]. Using an Arabidopsis protoplast
transfection system, we found that GL1-GL3/EGL3 or
WER-GL3/EGL3 complexes are required and sufficient to
activate the expression of TRY, CPC, ETC1 and ETC3 (Figure 7B). However, we did not detect the activation of
TCL1 and ETC2 by these complexes (Figure 7B). Moreover, among the single-repeat R3 MYB genes that can be
activate by the GL1-GL3/EGL3 or WER-GL3/EGL3 complex, only the transcript of ETC1 is dramatically reduced
in the gl3 egl3 double mutant (Figure 7C). These results
implied that: (i) only the transcription of ETC1 of the
small MYB gene family is tightly controlled by the GL1GL3/EGL3 and WER-GL3/EGL3 activator complexes; (ii)
in addition to being controlled by the GL1-GL3/EGL3 and
WER-GL3/EGL3 activator complexes, there are additional
mechanisms controlling the transcription of TRY, CPC
and ETC3; and (iii) the transcription of TCL1 and ETC2
are controlled by unidentified mechanisms. Therefore,
our results suggested that there may be multiple, distinct
mechanisms controlling the transcription of single-repeat
R3 MYB genes. The differential regulation of single-repeat
R3 MYB genes may contribute to the differences in their
developmental functions, which might explain why so
many genes with very similar function are maintained in
the genome.

Conclusion
We have established that each of the single-repeat R3 MYB
transcription factors has a role in regulating trichome and
root hair formation, and that these MYBs largely function
in a redundant manner. We demonstrate that a normal
function of these MYBs is to suppress trichome formation
on leaves and inflorescence stems, and to suppress trichome formation on cotyledons, pedicels and siliques,
organs that normally do not bear any trichomes. We confirm that GL3 binding may represent a general mechanism of action of single-repeat R3 MYBs in inhibiting the
activity of the TTG1-GL3/EGL3-GL1 activator complex.
We show that the transcription of small MYB genes is
likely regulated by multiple mechanisms. These results
reveal genetic basis of organ-specific control of trichome
formation and provide new insight into the lateral inhibition mechanism that mediates epidermal patterning.

Methods
Plant materials and growth conditions
The single mutants, try_29760 [24], etc1-1 [6], tcl1-1 [4],
etc2-2 and etc3-1 [8] are in the Columbia-0 (Col-0) ecotypic background. The cpc-1 mutant is in the Wassilewskija (WS) ecotypic background [3]. The ttg1 and gl3 egl3
mutants are in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotypic background [17]. Double mutants were generated by crossing
single mutants. Triple, quadruple and quintuple mutants
were generated by crossing related lower order mutants
(e.g. single, double and triple mutants). Mutants were
examined in the F2 progeny for putative mutant phenotype, and their mutant statuses were confirmed by genotyping in F2 and subsequent generations. In this study, try,
etc1, tcl1, etc2, etc3 and cpc refer to the specific alleles
try_29760 [24], etc1-1 [6], tcl1-1 [4], etc2-2 [8], etc3-1 [8]
and cpc-1 [3], respectively.

Seedlings used for RT-PCR analysis were obtained by
growing surface-sterilized seeds on 0.6% (w/v) phytoagar
(plantmedia, Dublin, Ohio) solidified 1/2 Murashige &
Skoog (MS) medium with vitamins (plantmedia) and 1%
(w/v) sucrose. Seedling used for phenotypic analysis were
obtained either by plating seeds on 1/2 MS medium or by
directly sowing seeds into soil. Plants were grown at 23°C
with 14/10 h photoperiod at approximately 120 μmol m2 s-1.
Plasmid construction
Constructs used for protoplasts transfection were generated by first amplifying the full-length open-reading
frame (ORF) of the corresponding genes by RT-PCR using
RNA isolated from 10-d old, light-grown Arabidopsis
seedlings, then cloning the PCR fragment in frame with an
amino terminal HA or GD tag into the pUC19 vector
under the control of the double 35S enhancer promoter of
CaMV [36,39]. For plant transformation, corresponding
constructs in pUC19 vector was digested with EcoRI, then
sub-cloned into binary vector pPZP211 or pPZP221 [40].
Plant transformation and selection of transgenic plants
Five-week-old soil grown plants with several mature flowers on the main inflorescence stem were used to transform
with related constructs in Agrobacterium tumefaciens
GV3101 by the floral dip method [41]. Phenotypes of
transgenic plants were examined in the T1 generation, and
confirmed in T2 up to T4 generations. For all transgenic
plants, at least five transgenic lines with similar phenotypes were obtained.
Protoplasts isolation, transfection and GUS activity assay
Protoplast isolation, transfection and GUS activity assays
were performed as described previously [4,36].
