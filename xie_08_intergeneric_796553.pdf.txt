Abstract
Background: Horizontal gene transfer, also called lateral gene transfer, frequently occurs among
prokaryotic organisms, and is considered an important force in their evolution. However, there are
relatively few reports of transfer to or from fungi, with some notable exceptions in the acquisition
of prokaryotic genes. Some fungal species have been found to contain sequences resembling those
of bacterial genes, and with such sequences absent in other fungal species, this has been interpreted
as horizontal gene transfer. Similarly, a few fungi have been found to contain genes absent in close
relatives but present in more distantly related taxa, and horizontal gene transfer has been invoked
as a parsimonious explanation. There is a paucity of direct experimental evidence demonstrating
the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer in fungi.
Results: We found a fungal field isolate from rice (Oryzae sativa) that contains ribosomal DNA
sequences from two species of fungal rice pathogens (Thanatephorus cucumeris and Ceratobasidium
oryzae-sativae). This field isolate has four types of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS),
namely pure ITS of C. oryzae-sativae, which was dominant in this field isolate, pure ITS of T.
cucumeris, and two chimeric ITS, with ITS1 derived from C. oryzae-sativae and ITS2 from T.
cucumeris, or ITS1 from T. cucumeris and ITS2 from C. oryzae-sativae. The presence of chimeric
forms indicates that the intergeneric hybrid was not merely composed of nuclei from the parental
species, but that nuclear fusion and crossing over had taken place.
Conclusion: Hyphae of T. cucumeris and C. oryzae-sativae are vegetatively incompatible, and do not
successfully anastomose. However, they parasitize the same host, and perhaps under the influence
of host enzymes targeted to weaken pathogen cells or in dying host plant tissue, the fungal hyphae
lost their integrity, and normal vegetative incompatibility mechanisms were overcome, allowing the
hyphae to fuse. Based on the presence of other similarly anomalous isolates from the field, we
speculate that these types of intergeneric hybridization events and occurrences of horizontal gene
transfer may not be so rare in the field.

Background
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), also called lateral gene
transfer, is known to occur among prokaryotic organisms,
and is considered an important force in their evolution
[1], but HGT is less well known among eukaryotes [2].
Based on a study of known protein domain families and
publicly available sequences, there is evidence for HGT
among more than 50% of archaea, between 30% to 50%
of bacteria, and less than 10% of eukaryotes [3].
The role of HGT in the evolution of fungi was recently
reviewed [4], and the authors speculated that the mode of
feeding and large surface area in association with other
organisms allow fungi a greater opportunity for HGT than
other eukaryotes. Among fungi, some species have been
found to contain sequences resembling those of bacterial
genes, but such sequences were absent in other fungal species, and this was interpreted as HGT [5-10]. Transfer of a
supernumerary chromosome between vegetatively
incompatible biotypes of the phytopathogenic fungus,
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, was obtained under laboratory conditions [11]. Gene clusters encoding for epipolythiodioxopiperazines, which are a class of secondary
metabolite toxins, have been found in various ascomycete
fungi, but the phylogeny of these gene clusters was not
concordant with that of the organisms in which they were
found. [12]. A nitrate assimilation gene cluster was
thought to have been transferred first from Oomycota to
Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), and then more
recently from a basdiomycete to the ascomycete Trichoderma reesei, which allowed this fungus to better exploit its
new niche [13].
In a review of the evolution of virulence genes in fungi
[14], the authors speculate that HGT is important in their
origin in different pathogenic species, and may facilitate
the emergence of new pathogens. They also noted the
phenomenon where virulence genes are present in clusters. For example, a cluster of genes similar to those in pea
was found on a supernumerary chromosome of three different fungi pathogenic to pea [15]. The authors of the
review also speculate that the high density of transposable
and repetitive elements frequently observed near putative
virulence genes somehow allows or even facilitates the
clustering of virulence genes, and that regions characterised by particular sequences may be more susceptible to
HGT.
One group of genes that has not been demonstrated to be
subjected to HGT encodes for ribosomal RNA [3]. These
genes are found in the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) region,
and form what has been called the ribosomal cassette. The
rRNA combine with protein molecules to form ribosomes
that function in protein synthesis. Because of the high
demand for protein synthesis, there are multiple copies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/87

repeated tens to thousands of times in a genome [16].
Eukaryotes have rDNA cassettes formed by the small subunit (18S), the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) 1, the
5.8S gene, the ITS2, the large subunit (28S) and the intergenic spacer region. The differences between rDNA
sequences allow for studies of phylogenetic relationships
over a wide range of taxonomic levels [17].
In the current study, we found that DNA of a field fungal
strain from rice (Oryzae sativa), was amplified with two
sets of specific, normally diagnostic rDNA primers: one set
for the sheath blight fungus, and the other for the sheath
blot fungus. Sheath blight, caused by Thanatephorus
cucumeris, is a notorious disease of rice with serious losses
every year [18]. Ceratobasidium oryzae-sativae is another
pathogen of rice, which causes sheath blot. These two
pathogens both have their anamorphs (asexual stage) in
the fungal form-genus Rhizoctonia, but are considered distantly related. Further testing with the fungal strain from
the field using species-specific primers, Southern hybridization, DNA cloning, and DNA sequencing yielded results
implying that gene transfer had occurred between rDNA
genes of these two species of pathogenic fungi, and that
genetic recombination had occurred at the 5.8S gene.

Results and Discussion
In November 2004, a fungal strain, named RCOL-1, was
isolated from a typical rice sheath blight lesion in a field
at Huazhong Agricultural University in Central China.
The growth rate of RCOL-1 was slower than the average
for either of the two major fungal rice pathogens Thanatephorus cucumeris or Ceratobasidium oryzae-sativae. This isolate also showed abnormal colony formation on PDA
(potato dextrose agar), with sclerotia irregularly distributed compared to the two rice pathogens (Fig 1). RCOL-1
was also found to be avirulent when inoculated onto
plant host tissue. DAPI staining (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stain, [19]) showed that the distribution of
nuclei in individual cells of RCOL-1 was not uniform (Fig
2), with some cells containing only one nucleus (1.3%
out of 1210 cells counted), some with two nuclei
(95.9%), and some multinucleate (2.8%) with up to 5
nuclei observed per cell. In contrast, cells of T. cucumeris
consistently contain multiple nuclei, and C. oryzae-sativae
has two nuclei in each cell [20].
DNA of RCOL-1 was tested using primers specific for
either T. cucumeris or C. oryzae-sativae [18] based on the
internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the multi-copy nuclear
ribosomal DNA genes (rDNA). RCOL-1 was found to
have target bands of both fungal species (Fig 3). Furthermore, Southern blot of genomic DNA showed that the
DNA of RCOL-1 could hybridize with either of the two
probes, but the DNA of isolate WH-1 (T. cucumeris) or
WH-87 (C. oryzae-sativae) would only hybridize with their

RCOL-1 contained rDNA sequence from both C. oryzaesativae and T. cucumeris.
In addition to primer GMRS-3 which was based on the
ITS2 sequence of T. cucumeris [18], three other primers
were used which were designed from the ITS1 sequence of

ITS2 (P-COITS2-R) of C. oryzae-sativae. The two forward
and two reverse primers were used in all combinations.
The amplification products (Fig 5) were sequenced, and
these showed that RCOL-1 contained four types of ITS
sequences, ones fully matching either C. oryzae-sativae
(GenBank Accession DQ307249) or T. cucumeris
(DQ307250), and two types of chimeric sequences: ITS1
DNA from C. oryzae-sativae with ITS2 DNA from T.
cucumeris (DQ307251) or ITS1 DNA from T. cucumeris
with ITS2 DNA from C. oryzae-sativae (DQ307252). The
747 bp alignment of the ITS of C. oryzae-sativae (712 bp)
with T. cucumeris (718 bp) showed 79.5% identity, further
demonstrating that these are distinct species, although
they both have their anamorphs in the form-genus Rhizoctonia.
Clones were generated from polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) products derived using universal fungal primers,
ITS1 and ITS4 [17], and these clones were tested with the
four pairs of primers mentioned above. Among the 500
clones, 499 were found to contain a complete ITS cassette
of C. oryzae-sativae, but one of the clones was chimeric,
with ITS1 of C. oryzae-sativae and ITS2 of T. cucumeris,
based on primer amplification and DNA sequencing. To
specifically detect the presence of T. cucumeris DNA,
genomic DNA of RCOL-1 was amplified with the primer
pair ITS1 (non-specific) and GMRS-3 (specific for the ITS2
region of T. cucumeris). The PCR product was used to generate 66 clones which were tested with the primer pairs
COITS-F and GMRS-3 (for chimeric C. oryzae-sativae ITS1
and T. cucumeris ITS2), and P-RSITS1-F and GMRS-3 (for
pure T. cucumeris ITS), giving 49 and 17 clones, respectively. Similarly, DNA of RCOL-1 was amplified with the

cucumeris ITS), giving 46 and 13 clones, respectively. The
ratio of chimeric clones to pure T. cucumeris clones in each
test was between 3 to 3.5 implying that there are more
copies of the chimeras than complete T. cucumeris ITS
sequences. The greater abundance of chimeric sequences
than pure T. cucumeris ITS sequences may be a result of
crossing over events at the conserved 5.8S gene, which sits
between ITS1 and ITS2.
Hyphae of T. cucumeris and C. oryzae-sativae are vegetatively incompatible, and do not successfully anastomose.
However, they parasitize the same host, and perhaps

under the influence of host enzymes targeted to weaken
pathogen cells or in dying host plant tissue, the fungal
hyphae lost their integrity, and normal vegetative incompatibility mechanisms were overcome, allowing the
hyphae to fuse. This direct intimate contact within the
host could theoretically have lead to a transfer of genomic
DNA between the fungi. Unlike plants and animals, vegetative cells of fungi are less differentiated, and each cell
has the ability to develop into a new mycelium. This
means that if any fungal cell were to obtain foreign DNA
that was compatible with the DNA replication system, the
cell could theoretically propagate the foreign DNA to
daughter mycelia.
HGT was thought to be limited to the early stages of
diverging lineages [21], although a review of more recent

Rhizoctonia are known to be multinucleate, but the presence of chimeric forms of the ITS in RCOL-1 indicates that
DNA of the two parental species had been mixed, rather
than existing solely in separate nuclei. Furthermore, the
growth debilitation and avirulence found with RCOL-1
are not likely to have resulted just from the altered ribosomal gene cassettes, since there are mostly pure copies of
C. oryzae-sativae in RCOL-1, which should be sufficient for
full function. There are probably other genes in RCOL-1
that have been affected by the intergeneric hybridization,
giving the debilitated phenotype. Further research
remains to reveal which other genes may have been
affected, but the results of the current study indicate that
horizontal gene transfer can occur between different genera of fungi, and based on the presence of other similarly
debilitated field isolates, we speculate that such occurrences may not be so rare.

literature [2] has found frequent HGT in some phagotrophic algae and HGT between plant lineages, with few
examples for animals or fungi. The HGT event between C.
oryzae-sativa and T. cucumeris which generated RCOL-1
was probably a relatively recent one, since such an abnormal isolate may be less fit and not have a high survival rate
in nature. In July 2005, eight months after the initial isolation of RCOL-1, more intensive sampling was conducted in the field where RCOL-1 was originally collected,
and three other strains with morphology similar to RCOL1 were found, although not at the original site of collection. This suggests that isolates such as RCOL-1 might be
able to persist, even though macroscopically avirulent in
pathogenicity tests, and with less aggressive growth than
either parental type. Another explanation is that the intergeneric hybridization events occurred more than once in
this field, and are more frequent than currently thought.

Conclusion
We hypothesize that a presumably rare anastomosis event
between hyphae of T. cucumeris and C. oryzae-sativae
allowed the transfer of nuclei into a C. oryzae-sativae mycelium, followed by nuclear fusion and crossing over
events. The relative scarcity of T. cucumeris ITS sequences
compared to C. oryzae-sativae, could be a result of the
transfer of just a few nuclei from T. cucumeris into an
extensive C. oryzae-sativae mycelium, or the subsequent
process of concerted evolution (Elder and Turner 1995) to
homogenize the ribosomal gene sequences. Species of

Methods
Strains and medium
RCOL-1, WH-1 and WH-87 were isolated from typical
sheath blight lesions in a rice field at Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. These isolates were subcultured numerous times from hyphal tips to ensure
purity of each isolate. RCOL-1 grew slowly on PDA with
abnormal colony morphology, while WH-1 and WH-67
were identified as normal strains of Thanatephorus
cucumeris and Ceratobasidium oryzae-sativae respectively.
DAPI staining of nuclei
Strains were grown in PDA plates, and autoclaved glass
slides were placed onto the agar. After hyphae grew onto
the slides, a droplet of 0.004 % DAPI was placed on each
slide, followed by incubation in the dark for 20 min. The
nuclear type of each strain was observed with a Nikon fluorescence microscope fitted with an ultraviolet light filter.
Primers and PCR amplification
Fungal mycelia were collected and subjected to DNA
extraction using the CTAB method [22]. Amplification of
Internal transcribed spacers (ITS) was performed using
primers P-ITS1 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and
P-ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') according to
[17]. Specific primers for distinguishing T. cucumeris and
C. oryzae-sativae were designed and used based on Johanson et al [18]: GMRS-3 (5'-AGTGGAACCAAGCATAACACT-3') and P-ITS1 were used to specifically amplify
DNA from T. cucumeris; and GMROS (5'-GAAAGAGAGAGAGGTCGCCTC-3') and R635 (5'-GGTCCGTGTTTCAAGACGG-3') were used to specific amply the DNA from C.
oryzae-sativae.

To further analyze the PCR products of ITS DNA of RCOL1, in addition to primer GMRS-3 (as a reverse primer for
the ITS2 region of T. cucumeris), three more primers were

designed based on the ITS sequence of C. oryzae-sativae
and T. cucumeris: P-COITS1-F (5'-CCTTTCCTCCCAGG3'), P-COITS2-R (5'-GGAACCAAGTTCATAGA-3') and PRSITS1-F (5'-TCTACCTTAATTTGGC-3'). The two forward
primers were paired with the two reverse primers giving
four possible pairings. The genomic DNA of RCOL-1 was
amplified with P-ITS1 and P-ITS4, and the PCR product
was purified and diluted 100 fold (about 1.0 ng/µl) for
second round amplification with the four pairs of primers. Amplification (25 µl) were performed using 1.0 µl
purified PCR product, 2.5 µl of 10 × PCR buffer, 2.5 µl of
2.5 mM dNTPS, 1.0 µl of 1.5 µM forward primer and 1.0
µl of 1.5 µM reverse primer, 0.25 µl of 5.0 U/µl Taq
(TAKARA, Dalian, P R China). A PCR amplification system (PTC-100: MJ, USA) was used with the following programme: initial denaturation for 4 min at 94°C, 30 s at
94°C, 30 s at 56°C, 30 s at 72°C, 20 cycles; 7 min at 72°C.
PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1.2 %
(w/v) agarose gel, and stained in ethidium bromide.
Southern hybridization
To confirm the result obtained by PCR amplification,
genomic DNA of strain RCOL-1, T. cucumeris strain WH-1
and C. oryzae-sativae WH-87 was extracted in CTAB following [22], and 15 µg of DNA of each strain was digested
completely with BamH1, which does not have any recognition sites on the ITS or 5.8 S rDNA of these two fungi.
The digested products were size-fractionated through a 0.8
% agarose gel and mounted onto positively charged nylon
membranes. Two oligonucleotides, namely TC-Probe (5'CAATAGTTGGTGGATTTAATTCCATCATCCATTTGCTGT3') and CO-Probe (5'-TTTAACTAGGGAAAGAGAGAGAGGTCGCCTCCGTCTA-3') which were derived from the
ITS1 sequence of T. cucumeris or C. oryzae-sativae, respectively, were synthesised and 5'-labelled with γ-32P ATP by
T4 polynucleotide kinase as probes to hybridize with
DNA of RCOL-1. Hybridization was conducted in a
hybridization incubator (Biorad, USA). Briefly, the membranes were pre-hybridized in 3×SSC containing 0.1 %
SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) at 65°C for 7 h in a hybridization tube, and then probes were added into the hybridization buffer. Hybridization was carried out at 65°C
overnight. To remove non-hybridized probes, membranes
were washed in 100 ml of 6×SSC containing 0.1 % SDS
three times for 15 min, then in 100 ml of 2×SSC containing 0.1 % SDS for 10 min, and finally in 100 ml of 1×SSC
containing 0.1 % SDS for 5 min. The temperature for
washing was controlled at 60°C. The membranes were
exposed to an imaging plate and the locations of the
labelled compounds were visualized by using a Molecular
Dynamics (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) Strom-820 imaging-system analyzer.

DNA sequencing
PCR products at various stages of this study were fractionated by electrophoresis in agarose gels and purified using
a Gel Extraction Kit (Sangon, Shanghai, P R China). The
recovered DNA was ligated onto T-Vector (pMD-18,
TAKARA, Dalian, P R China), and then transformed into
competent cells of E. coli JM109. Sequencing was done by
the dideoxy-nucleotide termination method using the Big
Dye terminator Sequencing Kit (BigDye terminator v2.0)
and an ABI PRISM 377-96 automated sequencer (Sangon,
Shanghai, P.R. China). The M13 universal primer was
used for sequencing.
