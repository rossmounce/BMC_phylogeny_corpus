Abstract
Background: Protein sequence alignment is one of the basic tools in bioinformatics. Correct
alignments are required for a range of tasks including the derivation of phylogenetic trees and
protein structure prediction. Numerous studies have shown that the incorporation of predicted
secondary structure information into alignment algorithms improves their performance. Secondary
structure predictors have to be trained on a set of somewhat arbitrarily defined states (e.g. helix,
strand, coil), and it has been shown that the choice of these states has some effect on alignment
quality. However, it is not unlikely that prediction of other structural features also could provide
an improvement. In this study we use an unsupervised clustering method, the self-organizing map,
to assign sequence profile windows to "structural states" and assess their use in sequence
alignment.
Results: The addition of self-organizing map locations as inputs to a profile-profile scoring function
improves the alignment quality of distantly related proteins slightly. The improvement is slightly
smaller than that gained from the inclusion of predicted secondary structure. However, the
information seems to be complementary as the two prediction schemes can be combined to
improve the alignment quality by a further small but significant amount.
Conclusion: It has been observed in many studies that predicted secondary structure significantly
improves the alignments. Here we have shown that the addition of self-organizing map locations
can further improve the alignments as the self-organizing map locations seem to contain some
information that is not captured by the predicted secondary structure.

Background
The ability to create good alignments is important when
inferring knowledge from one sequence to another. Align-

ments can be used in phylogeny to examine the evolution
of sequences, and in protein structure prediction. In protein structure prediction, alignments are used to detect

related sequences in a procedure called fold recognition,
and to align the query sequence to related sequences.
In order to obtain good alignments, evolutionary information (multiple sequence alignments) should be used. It
has also been shown that methods that use evolutionary
information for both the query and target sequences are
superior to methods that only use evolutionary information for either the query or the target sequence [1,2].
Methods that use evolutionary information for both the
query and target sequences are known as profile-profile
methods. Profile-profile methods have been observed to
result in improved alignment quality compared to profilesequence methods [3-8]. Even though profile-profile
methods improve the alignments it has been observed
that they do not necessarily provide optimal alignments
[7].
To improve further both alignments and the detection of
distantly related proteins, structural features of proteins
are routinely used in the alignment procedure. Structural
features that have been used include secondary structure
[9-11,4,12] and solvent accessibility [13,14]. The secondary structure information has been incorporated into the
score in different ways in different methods. In ORFeus
[9] and prof_ss [11] a score based on the predicted secondary structure is added to the profile-profile score of
FFAS [15] and prof_sim [16], respectively. Wang & Dunbrack constructed a secondary structure substitution table
from predicted and observed secondary structures. The
total score was calculated by adding the weighted SS_score
to the weighted profile-profile score, where the sum of the
two weights was set to one. However, this relationship
between the profile-profile and the secondary structure
score might not be optimal since only a modest improvement was seen in alignment quality. In contrast the addition of predicted secondary structure has been shown to
improve the sensitivity of the detection of distantly related
proteins significantly [9,11,4]. Finally Tang et al.'s hybrid
sequence profile [12], using secondary structure and structural information, seems to be a good example where in
particular secondary structure information improves both
the homology detection as well as the alignment quality.
Although not completely uniform, a trend in studies to
date suggest that predicted secondary structure improves
alignments. It has also been shown that combining secondary structure predictions with other structural features
can further improve the alignments [12,17]. This indicates
that, if implemented correctly, different types of structural
features can be included to improve alignment quality.
We have recently developed a profile-profile scoring function, ProfNet [18]. In ProfNet the scoring function used in
the subsequent alignment algorithm is trained to identify
structurally superimposable residue pairs. ProfNet is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/357

based on an artificial neural network, which makes it easy
to include additional information. Therefore, we wanted
to investigate how an alternative way of representing
structural information would affect the alignment quality.
The structural information used in this study is captured
by a self-organizing map (SOM). We found that the alignment quality can be improved for distantly related proteins by combining a profile-profile score with a SOM
based score. The effect is not as great as when predicted
secondary structure is included, but by combining these
with the SOM score we were able to improve the alignments further.

Results and discussion
Incorporating local structural information into alignment
scores
It is well known that secondary structure information has
the power of improving fold recognition and alignments,
but it is still not known how best to include it into an
alignment score. In this study we used predicted secondary structure from PSI-PRED [19] for both the query and
target sequences. First we constructed a normal profileprofile method using predicted secondary structures,
which we refer to as Prob_score_SS. Here we use the same
secondary structure scoring system as in ORFeus. This secondary structure score, SS_score, is weighted and added to
Prob_score, which is our implementation of PICASSO3
[3], one of the best methods in our benchmark study of
profile-profile methods [7]. Full details are provided in
the Methods section.

Secondly, a new ProfNet version, ProfNet_SS, was constructed using the Prob_score score, and predicted secondary structure as input. Here, the SS_score was not
calculated (as in Prob_score_SS), instead the six PSI-PRED
propensity values (three from the query and three from
the template) were used directly as input to the artificial
neural network. Note that while the original ProfNet
method takes two 20-dimensional profile vectors as
input, we use the single Prob_score value as input for the
new versions developed here.
An alternative method to utilize local structural features is
to cluster local similarities. Such a clustering can be done
using a self-organizing map which maps high dimensional data into a 2D or 3D grid. In this study, the similarities in profile vectors of a large set of proteins are
clustered in such a way as corresponding to local structure
states (although note that only sequence information is
used) [20]. An advantage of this approach is that it is not
necessary to use predefined secondary structure states,
instead the SOM clustering defines the states. In Figure 1a
such a SOM mapping of a 15-residue sequence profile
windows is shown. Interestingly, multiple distinct regions
of helix, strand and, to some extent, coil can clearly be

having a particular secondary structure state is mapped to that position. The most populated helix and strand locations are
almost non overlapping, while coil is found in most parts of the SOM and are somewhat avoiding the most popular helix locations. The total number of points in the three plots is 360 000 (130 000 in helix, 70 000 in strand and 160 000 in coil).

seen. In Figure 1b it can be seen that the SOMs also are
able to capture some information about the solvent accessibility of the sequence windows, although this is less
clear-cut (note the more overlapping regions of density).
Although they capture aspects of secondary structure, it
should be noted that SOMs are not able to predict threestate secondary structure as well as ANN based prediction
methods, e.g. PSI-PRED (data not shown). In our subsequent studies, windows of profile vectors were mapped
onto 3D SOM grids.
Preliminary studies suggested that the simultaneous use
of SOM mappings based on different sequence window
sizes produced slightly better results (data not shown). In
this study we have used three SOMs trained with sequence
profile windows of 7, 17 and 21 residues. Any given position in a sequence therefore maps to a 3D location in each
of the three SOMs, making a total of 9 coordinates ("SOM
locations").
Using this clustering technique we constructed two ProfNet versions, ProfNet_SOM, which uses Prob_score's
score and SOM locations, and ProfNet_SS_SOM which
uses Prob_score's score, predicted secondary structure and
SOM locations as input, as depicted in Figure 2. For a
summary of the inputs used in the different ProfNet methods, see Table 1.
For
completeness,
Prob_score_SOM
and
Prob_score_SS_SOM methods have also been implemented (see Methods for full details).
Secondary structure information improves the alignments
The alignment quality performance was compared for
protein pairs related at SCOP superfamily and fold level.
The alignment quality of the Prob_score_SS method, as
measured by the average MaxSub score, increased by 10%
on superfamily level and by 40% on fold level (p-value
1Â·10-5) compared to Prob_score, see Table 2. This is in
line with earlier results on the combination of predicted
secondary structure with profile-profile scoring. It should
also be remembered that Prob_score performs better than
methods not using profile-profile scoring [18], i.e. the
baseline for improvement is quite high.

ProfNet_SS was shown to produce alignments of similar
quality as Prob_score_SS, with an improvement of 10 and
26% on superfamily and fold level (p-value 6Â·10-4) compared to ProfNet. Hence, a significant improvement in
alignment quality could be seen on fold level by adding
predicted secondary structure to Prob_score as well as to
ProfNet, although the use of neural networks in this case
is not particularly advantageous. These results show that
predicted secondary structure is useful when aligning dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/357

tantly related proteins, as observed in earlier studies [912].
Combined secondary structure information and SOM
locations further improve the alignments
By combining plain SOM locations with Prob_score score
in ProfNet (ProfNet_SOM) the alignments show a slight
improvement by 5 and 8% on superfamily and fold level
respectively compared to ProfNet. This improvement is
not very impressive, however by combining predicted secondary structure information and SOM locations the
improvement on fold level is 49% compared to ProfNet
and 18% compared to ProfNet_SS (p-value 3Â·10-2). (A
similar pattern is seen with Prob_score, Prob_score_SOM
and Prob_score_SS_SOM.) This indicates that the SOM
based classification and the PSI-PRED secondary structure
predictions contain complementary information.
Although the improvement of 18% might seem large it
should be noted that this improvement is only seen at the
fold level and the real increase in MaxSub score is small
(0.02). Although we have optimized the parameters individually for each of the methods it was noted that the
results were not extremely sensitive to this optimisation.
Using 40 of the best parameter sets ProfNet_SS obtained
an average MaxSub score of 0.073 Â± 0.02 and
ProfNet_SS_SOM 0.085 Â± 0.02 (Â± standard deviation).
This indicates that although the optimal parameter tuning
improves the alignment quality by 10â20% the improvement from using the SOMs is consistent over a large set of
parameters. Figure 3 shows an example where the addition of SOM information improves the protein model by
aligning the helices more correctly.
Why does the SOM information improve the alignments?
From the results in Table 2 we see that the alignments are
improved most when a combination of profile-profile
score, predicted secondary structure and SOM locations is
used (ProfNet_SS_SOM), while ProfNet_SOM actually
performs slightly worse than ProfNet_SS. To gain a deeper
understanding into what the SOM locations capture we
have analysed pairs of structurally aligned residues in
terms of the "SOM distance" (explained below), structural
distance (RMSD), Prob_score and secondary structure
identity. The SOM distance is calculated as the Euclidean
distance between the two points in the SOM cube to
which a residue pair maps. More precisely it is the mean
intra-SOM distance over the three SOMs which use different sequence profile window sizes. In Figure 4 it can be
seen that residues pairs having similar SOM values (small
SOM distance) are, on average, closer to each other in the
structural superposition, that a higher fraction of these
share the same secondary structure and that their
sequence profiles are more similar. However, the average
difference in solvent accessibility does not show a strong
correlation to this measure. This indicates that the SOMs

capture some information that might correspond to
sequence/structure information that is not captured by
secondary structure prediction or the profile-profile score.
It might be speculated that the SOM clusters correspond

to more fine grained features than the three-state model
(helix, strand, coil) used in secondary structure predictions or to the existence of larger fragment with significant
sequence structure correlation as used in a recent study to

In ProfNet the "plain profile", i.e. the amino acid frequencies are used as the only input. In ProfNet_SS the sequence similarity is instead measured
using the Prob_score measure and in addition six values from PSI-PRED predicted secondary structure probabilities are added. ProfNet_SOM is
identical but the PSI-PRED values are replaced with the output from the SOM classification and in ProfNet_SS_SOM both outputs are combined.

improve alignment qualities [21]. Alternatively subtle
sequence signals that are not seen when adding the profile-profile scores might be captured as well.

Conclusion
Here, we show that two different methods to combine
predicted three-state secondary structure and profile-profile scores improve alignments for distantly related pro-

teins. The two approaches are; addition of SS_score to
Prob_score and by using the predictions directly from PSIPRED in ProfNet_SS. Interestingly these two different
approaches improve the alignments by a similar amount.
It was also found that predicted secondary structure combined with self-organizing maps (SOM) of sequence profile windows can be used to improve alignments of
distantly related proteins (and perhaps unrelated analogous folds) by a further small amount. The SOMs appear
to be capturing information that is not directly related to
solvent accessibility and is partially orthogonal to predicted secondary structure. The clusters on the SOM may
correspond to fine-grained secondary and supersecondary
structures which appear to be conserved at the fold level.

Methods
Self-organizing maps

protein domains from a subset of SCOP 1.57, where no
two domains have more than 75% sequence identity.

Average RMSD [Ã], Prob_score, difference in solvent accessible surface area [Ã2] and secondary structure identity is plotted
against SOM distance (binned from 0â4 in steps of 0.1). The SOM distance is defined as the average of the distances between
locations in the three SOMs used in ProfNet_SS_SOM, for structurally aligned residue pairs (i.e. those used as positive examples in the neural network training). It can be seen that among the pairs that are close in the SOM space the average distance
in the structural superposition is closer and that a higher fraction of these pairs have the same secondary structure. The
Prob_score is also (inversely) correlated with SOM distance. In contrast no such clear trend can be found for the difference in
surface accessibility.

performed marginally better than the others in the alignment quality test and was therefore used in the rest of the
study. Similarly it was found that 10 training epochs were
sufficient (50 and 100 epochs were also tested). Sequence
profile windows of sizes of one to 21 centered around the
residue in question were used as input to the SOMs.

winÂ·20-dimensional vectors, v, with random starting
values
â¢ Training: for each of 10 epochs:

The self-organizing map (SOM) of Kohonen and Makisara
(1989) was used in this study, using the algorithm outlined below (as in MacCallum, 2004) [20], assuming
winÂ·20-dimensional "input" vectors, where win is the
window size of profile vectors used, i.e. 1â21.

2. update vwinner towards x by a small amount Î±,
vwinner â vwinner + Î±(x - vwinner)
3. update neighbours of vwinner within a certain
radius r in the same way, but by a smaller
amount
- reduce radius r and training rate Î±
â¢ Application: any data point x can be assigned to a "winning" grid vector, vwinner.
After training a SOM, any winÂ·20-dimensional vector can
be mapped to a position (a, b, c) on the grid. The result of
the clustering is that data points which are close in the
input space are mapped to the same or neighbouring grid
nodes wherever possible. The SOM locations were normalized to (a/5, b/6, c/7) so the values are in the range
zero to one before used as input to ProfNet_SOM and
ProfNet_SS_SOM. Multiple SOM locations, using different SOM mappings corresponding to different profile
window sizes were used as input to the neural network
(see below).
Artificial neural network training
ProfNet is based on a novel scoring function obtained by
training an artificial neural network to recognise related
residues. For the positive training examples, protein pairs
from the same superfamily, but different families, were
structurally aligned using STRUCTAL [22] and all pairs of
residues within 3 Ã separation were used. The negative
training examples were created from randomly selected
residue pairs of proteins from different folds. For the positive and negative data sets no more than 15 aligned positions from the same protein pair were used. The ANNs
were trained to score the training examples according to

the S-score [23] (S-score =

1
1 + rmsd2 / 5

). The rmsd is cal-

culated between the CÎ± atoms of the aligned residues. The
artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained on 80% of
the dataset and the remaining 20% used as test set, where
proteins from the same superfamily are only present in
either the training or the test set, not both. The neural network package Netlab in MatLab was used for the ANN
training [24,25]. A linear activation function was chosen,
and the training was carried out using the scaled gradient
algorithm. The training of the ANNs was done using a grid
search over the number of hidden nodes and number of
training cycles. After the initial grid search, the search procedure was tuned to the area that produced the highest
MCC value on the test set. At least 49 sets of parameters

were tested for each ANN. The ANN-based scoring function was chosen by selecting the ANN with the highest
MCC-value and the minimum number of training cycles
and hidden nodes. In the next step the ANN was used in
the alignment quality test. The ANN scoring functions
were implemented into the Palign [26] package, and
called ProfNet.
Alignment quality
The dataset used in the alignment quality test was also
constructed from the same subset of SCOP version 1.57,
class a to e, where no two protein domains have more
than 75 % sequence identity. From this dataset we
included no more than 5 proteins from the same superfamily and no more than one NMR model per domain target. In total 672 superfamily and 602 fold related protein
pairs were included. In the superfamily related dataset, no
proteins from the same family were included, and among
the fold related protein pairs no proteins from the same
superfamily were included. Throughout this study, only
local alignments were used. For each alignment we created a model of the query protein and compared the structure of this model with the correct structure. The same
dataset has been used in two earlier studies [7,18] where
it was shown that ProfNet and Prob_score performed better than other profile methods. We used MaxSub [27]
which finds the largest subset of CÎ± atoms of a model that
superimpose well over the experimental model. The
results obtained using another method, LGscore [23], to
measure the alignment quality were similar to using MaxSub and are not reported here.
Statistical calculations
The p-values given in the text are calculated between the
alignment quality scores generated from two methods
(resulting in 602 different MaxSub scores when comparing the fold-related pairs), and gives an estimate of the
probability that the two methods' results differ only by
chance. Since we do not know what kind of distribution
the alignment quality scores have we used the non-parametric Wilcoxon (sign rank) test using the program R [28].
We used the 0.05 p-value level as a threshold for statistical
significance.
Profiles
We used the log-odds profiles obtained after ten iterations
of PSI-BLAST [29] version 2.2.2, using an E-value cutoff of
10-3 and all other parameters at default settings. The
search was performed against nrdb90 from EBI [30]. The
frequency profiles, used in Prob_score, were back-calculated from the log-odds profiles obtained from PSI-BLAST
as in [7]. The profiles used in the SOM clustering were created using the .mtx files from the 'makemat' program

Secondary structure predictions

the SS_score was determined by linear combination of the

Gap parameters
To obtain good alignment quality, the gap-opening, gapextension and shift parameters have to be optimized individually for each method. The gap-parameters indicate
how likely is it that a gap will be introduced (and
extended) in the alignment, modeled using the affine gappenalty. For all methods, the gap-parameters and shift values were calibrated using a grid of gap-opening (GO) and
shift values. The gap-extension was set to be either 5 or
10% of the gap-opening penalty. We searched a grid of
GO = (0.1,0.2...,0.5) and shift = (-0.5,-0.4,...,0.1) for the
ProfNet methods, and GO = (0.2,0.3...,3.5) and shift = (0.5,-0.45,...,1.5) for Prob_score_SS. The parameters were
tuned toward the direction that produced the best results.
