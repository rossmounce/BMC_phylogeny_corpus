Abstract
Background: Dolphins of the genus Lagenorhynchus are anti-tropically distributed in temperate to
cool waters. Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome b sequences have suggested that the genus is
polyphyletic; however, many relationships were poorly resolved. In this study, we present a
combined-analysis phylogenetic hypothesis for Lagenorhynchus and members of the subfamily
Lissodelphininae, which is derived from two nuclear and two mitochondrial data sets and the
addition of 34 individuals representing 9 species. In addition, we characterize with parsimony and
Bayesian analyses the phylogenetic utility and interaction of characters with statistical measures,
including the utility of highly consistent (non-homoplasious) characters as a conservative measure
of phylogenetic robustness. We also explore the effects of removing sources of character conflict
on phylogenetic resolution.
Results: Overall, our study provides strong support for the monophyly of the subfamily
Lissodelphininae and the polyphyly of the genus Lagenorhynchus. In addition, the simultaneous
parsimony analysis resolved and/or improved resolution for 12 nodes including: (1) L. albirostris, L.
acutus; (2) L. obscurus and L. obliquidens; and (3) L. cruciger and L. australis. In addition, the Bayesian
analysis supported the monophyly of the Cephalorhynchus, and resolved ambiguities regarding the
relationship of L. australis/L. cruciger to other members of the genus Lagenorhynchus. The frequency
of highly consistent characters varied among data partitions, but the rate of evolution was
consistent within data partitions. Although the control region was the greatest source of character
conflict, removal of this data partition impeded phylogenetic resolution.
Conclusion: The simultaneous analysis approach produced a more robust phylogenetic
hypothesis for Lagenorhynchus than previous studies, thus supporting a phylogenetic approach
employing multiple data partitions that vary in overall rate of evolution. Even in cases where there
was apparent conflict among characters, our data suggest a synergistic interaction in the
simultaneous analysis, and speak against a priori exclusion of data because of potential conflicts,
primarily because phylogenetic results can be less robust. For example, the removal of the control
region, the putative source of character conflict, produced spurious results with inconsistencies
among and within topologies from parsimony and Bayesian analyses.

Background
Dolphins of the genus Lagenorhynchus are distributed in
temperate to cool waters in the North Pacific, North
Atlantic, and Southern oceans [1-4] (Figure 1). A short
rostrum, relatively small, stout bodies, and flanks with
horizontal flares of various contrasting patterns characterize all members of the genus. Within this group there is
considerable variation in social structure and habitat,
from coastal, shallow water Peale's dolphin (L. australis)
that occurs in small groups within the Strait of Magellan
and nearby fijords, to the meso-pelagic dusky dolphin (L.
obscurus) that aggregates in groups of thousands along the
continental shelves of New Zealand, South Africa, and
South America.
Historically, color patterns, number of teeth, and the ratio
of rostrum to brain case length were used as diagnostic
characters to define dolphin genera, including the genus
Lagenorhynchus [5-7]. However, these characters are now
known to vary with sex and age within species [5]. It is not
surprising, therefore, that the classification of dolphin
groups based on these characters proved particularly
problematic for early taxonomists. For Lagenorhynchus, the
ubiquitous use of these morphological characters resulted
at one time or another in specimens being assigned (and
re-assigned) to at least 8 different genera (e.g., Delphinus,
[7]; Electra, [8]; Phocoena, [9]; Tursio, [10]; Leucopleurus,
[8]; Clymenia, [10]; Sagmatius, [11]). Recently, molecular
systematic studies of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b)
and control region (dloop) sequences were employed to
address the taxonomic ambiguities within the family Delphinidae. The results of these studies, based on a single
representative from each species, suggested a polyphyletic
Lagenorhynchus, leaving many other relationships weakly
supported and the overall taxonomic status of the group
unresolved [12,13]. For example, the cyt b cladogram of
LeDuc et al. [13] indicated strong support for a monophyletic subfamily Lissodelphininae that contained L.
obliquidens, L. obscurus, L. australis, L. cruciger, and the genera Cephalorhynchus and Lissodelphis but excluded the
North Atlantic L. albirostris and L. acutus. A more recent
Bayesian analysis of cyt b sequences by May-Collado and
Agnarsson [14] supported the paraphyly of the genus
Lagenorhynchus as suggested by LeDuc et al. [13], but
increased taxonomic sampling (particularly of outgroups)
provided increased phylogenetic resolution within the
Lissodelphininae. Nevertheless, as with LeDuc et al. [13],
some of the relationships among species of Lagenorhynchus and Cephalorhynchus within the Lissodelphininae
remained unresolved.
Because of its rapid rate of coalescence and lack of recombination, mitochondrial DNA has been the molecule of
choice for detailed studies of intra- and inter-specific evolution. However, the mitochondrial genome is a single,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/87

maternally inherited locus, and thus provides a perspective based on a single gene tree of female lineages. It is
possible that the lack of phylogenetic resolution in LeDuc
et al.'s [13] study was caused by limitations of a single,
mitochondrial locus and/or the result of rapid divergence
among taxa. However, distinguishing between alternative
phylogenetic hypotheses requires the addition of more
data from multiple loci and a detailed evaluation of the
utility of various data partitions to resolve relationships
within this group. To date, no further molecular systematic studies have attempted to address these issues.
In this paper we use four molecular markers (two nuclear
and two mitochondrial) that vary in overall rates of evolution to diagnose relationships among species of dolphin in the genus Lagenorhynchus and among genera
within the subfamily Lissodelphininae [13]. To increase
taxonomic representation, we include 34 individuals representing 9 species of the Lissodelphininae and North
Atlantic Lagenorhynchus. In addition, we utilize a posteriori
measures to quantify the interaction among data partitions in a simultaneous analysis, and to characterize the
effects of removing sources of conflict on phylogenetic
resolution under the optimality criterion of parsimony
and with the Bayesian method. Several studies have presented methods to quantify the interaction of characters
in simultaneous analyses [15-17]. These measures are
either: (1) topological indices that measure the change in
either tree length or structure ("topological congruence")
[18,19], and (2) measures of change in the amount of
support at a particular node [15,17,20]. The reliability of
these measures and their philosophical foundation has
been questioned. In a recent review, Grant and Kluge
([21], pg. 409) advocated that a posteriori analyses of character partitions are heuristic only when "based on the
results of the total-evidence analysis," and that there is "a
great potential for the development of heuristic methods
of a posteriori analysis of sets of characters." In this study,
we attempt to heuristically examine with statistical analyses the contributions and interactions of data partitions in
the resolution of relationships within the family Delphinidae. Our study is the first to use both nuclear and mitochondrial loci for the diagnosis of relationships within the
family Delphinidae, and thus provides a unique opportunity to explore the utility of multiple process partitions in
addressing the evolutionary history of this group.

Results
Simultaneous analysis and relationships within the
Delphinidae
The simultaneous analysis of two nuclear and two mitochondrial genes (a total of 3,053 characters) produced
four equally parsimonious trees that differed only in their
level of intra-specific resolution (Figure 2). Fourteen of
the 15 species-level clades had bootstrap values >99% and

high decay indices (5 to 44) (Figure 2). Our results provide unambiguous support for the monophyly of the subfamily Lissodelphininae (node iii, Figure 2) and the
polyphyly of the genus Lagenorhynchus (nodes x, ix, and vi,
Figure 2), first suggested by LeDuc et al. [13] and May-Callado and Agnarsson [14]. Several relationships previously
ambiguous in LeDuc et al. [13] were well-resolved in the
simultaneous analysis (Figure 2) and included: (1) monophyly of L. albirostris, L. acutus and Stenella/Tursiops/Delphinus clades (nodes xv, xiv, and xiii, Figure 2); (2)
increased support for the sister taxon relationship of L.
obscurus and L. obliquidens (node vi); and (3) the monophyly L. cruciger and L. australis (node ix). Overall, the
simultaneous parsimony analysis either resolved or
improved resolution for 12 nodes (Figure 2). The Bayesian analysis produced a topology very similar to that of
the parsimony analysis but with increased support at
nodes that had low bootstrap values in the simultaneous
parsimony analysis (e.g., nodes iv, v, xviii, Figure 2). Most
notably, Bayesian analysis supported the monophyly of
the Cephalorhynchus (node xviii, Figure 2), and resolved
ambiguities in previous studies [13,14] regarding the relationship of L. australis/L. cruciger to other members of the
genus Lagenorhynchus. There were some topological differences between the parsimony and Bayesian trees, but
these were restricted to clades outside the Lissodelphininae where taxonomic sampling was relatively poor (Figure 2).
Separate analysis of data partitions produced topologies
with variation in the degree of resolution (results not
shown). For example, the cyt b partition produced a topology most similar to those of the simultaneous analysis,
with 100% consensus among all inter-specific clades.
Overall, the mitochondrial partitions had a greater
number of phylogenetically informative characters and
produced fewer most parsimonious trees than nuclear
DNA data. Nevertheless, in all cases the simultaneous
analysis cladogram provided considerably greater resolution than any of the independent analyses. In several
cases, clades supported by the simultaneous analysis were
also recovered in one or more of the independent analyses, with the exception of the control region â many of the
relationships in this tree were not recovered in other analyses.
Character dynamics: phylogenetic utility
Each of the four process partitions contributed in some
degree to the resolution of the simultaneous analysis tree
(Table 2, Figure 3). On a node-by-node basis, the amount
of localized topological support varied by dataset and
among regions of the simultaneous analysis tree. For
example, partitioned Bremer support values for cyt b were
consistently positive at all nodes, while values for the control region were positive at the tips of the tree but negative

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/87

at the base (Table 2, Figure 3). Longer branches had statistically more CI = 1 characters than shorter branches in the
tree (H = 7.63, df = 2, P = 0.02), and in all data partitions
there was a significant, positive relationship between the
frequency of CI = 1 characters and branch length (cyt b, F
= 29.5, df = 1, 21, P < 0.01; dloop F = 7.2, df = 1, 21, P <
0.05; Actin, F = 16.1, df = 1, 21, P < 0.01) (Figure 4). The
strength of this relationship varied among data partitions,
with cyt b having the steepest positive relationship
between branch length and CI = 1 characters (Figure 4).
Interestingly the dloop, although generally considered to
evolve at a faster rate than cyt b, had fewer CI = 1 characters overall, and a slope more similar to that of Actin (Figure 4). Cyt b consistently provided the largest proportion
of CI = 1 characters at each node (Table 2, Figure 4).
Despite the greater frequency and wider distribution of
highly consistent characters in cyt b, the relative proportion of support contributed by each data partition did not
differ statistically among categories of branch length (Ï2 =
10.42, df = 6, P = 0.12), although Actin tended to contribute more to resolution along longer branches (Table 2).
Put another way, each data partition consistently contributed the same relative proportion of the total number of
CI = 1 characters among branch length categories, but the
absolute number of these characters differed among partitions. Our results further suggest that 3rd position transitions occurred more frequently and provided more
topological support than other classes of substitution (Ï2
= 12.4, df = 4, P = 0.02).
Character dynamics: data interaction
Spearman's correlation analysis revealed a significantly
positive relationship between RAG2 and the other data
partitions (Ï2 = 0.432, P = 0.003) but failed to find evidence for interaction between cyt b, Actin, and control
region partitions. However, the distribution of positive
and negative partitioned Bremer support values within
the simultaneous analysis topology suggested localized
character conflict among data partitions (Figure 3). The
greatest amount of dispersion in partitioned Bremer support was between the control region and other data partitions at the shortest nodes in the simultaneous analysis
tree (Table 2), where the partitioned Bremer support for
the control region were consistently negative (Figure 3).
In addition, the hidden synapomorphy values for the control region were significantly negative (sign test, P =
0.007), with a frequent displacement of synapomorphies
with the addition of data in the simultaneous analysis
(Table 2). The implications of these findings are two-fold:
(1) the control region was responsible for the majority of
data conflict, and (2) the relatively weak support for some
nodes was a result of this conflict. In contrast, cyt b did not
demonstrate a significant pattern of gain or loss of
synapomorphies (P = 0.13) due to simultaneous analysis.
In fact, cyt b contributed an additional synapomorphy to

nuclear DNA data partitions did not change between
independent and simultaneous analyses (data not

Character conflict exploration
We explored further the effects of character conflict on the
topology by excluding the control region and performing

a parsimony and Bayesian analysis with the same parameters as the simultaneous analysis. The topologies from
the truncated parsimony and Bayesian analyses were
markedly different from each other and from the simultaneous analysis cladogram, and failed in both cases to
recover the monophyly of key genera of the Lissodelphininae (Figure 5). In particular, neither analysis produced a
monophyletic Cephalorhynchus, which has been well supported in other phylogenetic studies [22]. These results
indicated that the control region data contributed to the

overall resolution of the simultaneous analysis tree, particularly within the Lissodelphininae, despite evidence for
character conflict, and that this was true whether or not
the data were analyzed with parsimony or Bayeisan methods. In addition, the removal of the control region data
did not produce a monophyletic Lagenorhynchus, which
indicated character conflict alone was not responsible for
the polyphyly of this genus.

Discussion and conclusion
Lissodelphininae and Lagenorhynchus systematics
Overall, our study demonstrates that the simultaneous
analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial process partitions,
coupled with better taxonomic sampling, provided greater
phylogenetic resolution than cyt b alone [13,14]. The
simultaneous parsimony and Bayesian analyses increased
measures of support for 7 nodes, and resolved relationships among 5 clades that were previously ambiguous in
the analysis of LeDuc et al. [13] (Figure 2). Furthermore,
our study recovered a monophyletic Cephalorhynchus, and
increased posterior probabilities for 4 nodes (i.e., iv, vi,
viii, xvii, and xviii Figure 2) compared to the Bayesian tree
of May-Callado and Agnarsson [14]. These results are consistent with other studies that suggest phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial data alone can be misleading,
and that single gene trees are not always accurate represen-

tations of species trees. Even in cases where there was
apparent conflict among characters, our data suggest synergistic interaction in the simultaneous analysis, and that
a priori exclusion of data because of potential conflict may
inhibit the recovery of robust phylogenetic hypotheses.
For example, the removal of the control region, the putative source of character conflict, produced spurious results
with inconsistencies among and within topologies from
parsimony and Bayesian analyses (Figures 2 and 5), and
these inconsistencies were not trivial. In both the parsimony and Bayesian analysis without the control region,
well-supported monophyletic groups were rendered polyor para-phyletic (e.g., Cephalorhynchus), and deeper-level
relationships were extensively altered (Figures 2 and 5).
The reliability of Bayesian posterior probabilities as a
measure of node support has been recently called into
question. [23-26]. Therefore the increased nodal support
derived from Bayesian analyses should be interpreted in
light of this controversy, and although bootstrap values
and posterior probabilities are not directly comparable, a
conservative approach might be to consider them as lower
and upper bounds of node reliability [23]. Nevertheless,
our results support previous studies that suggest data sets
interact when analyzed simultaneously [16,17,20,27,28],
and that properties of data emerge that are not detectable
when partitions are analyzed separately [15,16,20,27,28].

Character dynamics
Several methods have been proposed to quantify congruence
and
conflict
in
simultaneous
analyses
[15,17,20,29,30]. Although these measures are useful
descriptors of inconsistency among analyses, many do not
provide a quantitative measure with which to compare
trees derived from independent data partitions. It has
been argued (see recent review by Grant and Kluge [21]
and references therein) that an a posteriori analysis of various character partitions against a simultaneous analysis
tree is part of a heuristic approach for evaluating the utility
of different partitions to resolve relationships among lineages that potentially differ in evolutionary rates and/or
overall level of divergence. In this study, we have
attempted through a suite of statistical tests (Table 3) to
quantitate a posteriori the degree of interaction and phylo-

genetic utility of data partitions in combined analyses. In
many of these tests we chose to use a subset of parsimony
informative characters that lacked homoplasy (CI = 1)
(Table 3). The logic behind this approach is that in any
given topology those characters with a CI of 1 are less
likely to be displaced from a node with the addition of
future data (i.e., have phylogenetic "inertia") than less
consistent characters, and thus represent a conservative
class of characters by which to evaluate the utility of data
partitions. We acknowledge that even grossly erroneous
trees can contain some characters with a CI of 1, and all
tree topologies are subject to change with the addition of
data â this is true of any working hypothesis. However, we
argue that the a posteriori evaluation of the behavior of CI
= 1 characters provides one means to quantitatively eval-

uate the nature of data interaction and utility, and thus
identify potential sources of character incompatibility.
For example, our results indicate there is a significant, positive relationship between CI = 1 characters and branch
length for cyt b, dloop, and Actin (Figure 4), which is not
unexpected given that longer branches are generally
expected to have greater numbers of character changes
than shorter branches. We also expected that the dloop,
all things being equal, would have greater number of CI =
1 characters than cyt b or Actin since the dloop evolves
more rapidly than other mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
regions in cetaceans (and mammals in general). In contrast, we observe that both the frequency of CI = 1 characters and the strength of the CI = 1 frequency/branch length
relationship is greater in cyt b than the dloop and Actin
partitions (Table 2, Figure 4). One interpretation of these
results is that the evolution of the dloop is so rapid that
the phylogenetic information is reduced by multiple substitutions. However, if this were the case, we would expect
deterioration of phylogenetic signal with increased
branch length â we did not observe this pattern. Instead,
we suggest an alternative interpretation â that these results
indicate something about the phylogenetic utility and/or
the degree of conflict of the dloop with other characters in
combined analysis. For example, we have evidence that
the dloop is a source of character conflict, and the deviation of the expected results from the linear regression
analysis may be an additional indicator of this conflict.
Yet, despite this conflict, the significantly positive relationships between branch lengths and CI = 1 characters
suggest that all data partitions (to varying degrees) contribute to tree resolution, even in the presence of character
conflict. Therefore, this method is a general indicator of
the relative ability of each data partition to resolve relationships among OTU's with varying degrees of evolutionary divergence, and provides an example of the
emergent properties of characters in combined analysis.
Our statistical tests suggest that the frequency and distribution of CI = 1 characters was not uniform for any data
partition, suggesting that the rate of evolution was not
constant among lineages (Figure 4). This is not surprising
given that heterotachy and covariation are common phenomena in molecular data. However, we were interested
to find that, although the frequency of CI = 1 characters
varied along lineages, the relative proportion of CI = 1
characters contributed by each data partition was not statistically different (Figure 4). Our interpretation of this
finding is that the short branches at the base of the Lissodelphininae were the result of an actual acceleration in
rate of evolution along these lineages and not an artefact
of the pattern of evolution of any given data partition. In
this regard, we suggest this, or similar, statistical tests
might be useful in identifying regions in a tree that repre-

sent rapid divergence, which are often difficult to resolve
with phylogenetic analysis due to the relatively fewer
number of informative characters along very short
branches. The implications of these results are two-fold.
First, the consistent lack of uniformity among data partitions in the number of highly consistent characters provides strong evidence for shifts in the rate of evolution of
delphinid lineages since they shared a common ancestor
with the Phocoenidae approximately 10 million years
ago. Second, the rapid reduction in the number of highly
consistent characters in the middle of the simultaneous
analysis tree, and the corresponding short branch lengths
and large number of lineages indicates that a shift in
diversification rate occurred most recently at the base of
the subfamily Lissodelphininae (Figure 4). Given that 8 of
the 10 species in this monophyletic subfamily are found
only in the Southern Hemisphere, this may represent a
rapid anti-tropical divergence of lineages south of the
equator following equatorial transgression from the
north.
Taxonomic implications
Our results support the monophyly of the Lissodelphininae (node iii, Figure 2), and therefore concur with Le Duc
et al. [13] and May-Callado and Agnarsson [14] that the
genus Lagenorhynchus is polyphyletic. Le Duc et al. [13]
proposed that the generic name Lagenorhynchus remain
with L. albirostris, the type specimen of the genus [7], and
that the genus Leucopleurus [10] should be resurrected for
L. acutus according to taxonomic precedence. In contrast
to Le Duc et al. [13], the parsimony and Bayesian analyses
in this study recovered the monophyly of L. acutus and L.
albirostris (Figure 2, node x), and supports a close relationship of these species with the Delphinus/Stenella/Tursiops
clade, although the Bayesian and parsimony analysis did
not agree on the relationships among these clades (Figure
2). We therefore propose that both L. acutus and L. albirostris retain their current generic designation until further
analyses are performed with better taxonomic sampling
outside of the Lissodelphininae.

Second, the addition of nuclear and mitochondrial process partitions provided strong support for the paraphyly of
Lagenorhynchus within the subfamily Lissodelphininae
(Figure 2). In addition, both parsimony and Bayesian
analyses support the sister-group relationship of L. obliquidens and L. obscurus and the monophyly of the Cepharlorhynchus, which has been proposed by other molecular
phylogenetic studies [12,13,22,32]. This study provides
improved phylogenetic resolution for other groups
including the monophyly L. cruciger and L. australis, and
the placement of this clade within the Lissodelphininae
(Figure 2). Our evidence concurs with the results of Le
Duc et al. [13] that L. cruciger/L. australis are monophyletic
and should be placed into a separate genus, Sagmatius,

some relationships problematic. The next step in this
study would be to combine morphology and DNA
sequence characters in a simultaneous analysis. For example, Fraser and Purves [34] found distinct differences
among genera of dolphins based on a suite of characters
in the sinuses related to the structure and function hearing. A re-evaluation of these characters and additional
molecular loci for all members of the Delphinidae might
provide resolution of evolutionary relationships for problematic taxa.

Methods
Specimens
Tissues were obtained from biopsy punches and skin
swabs from living animals and post-mortem samples
from beach-cast or net-caught individuals (Table 1). Skin
swabs were collected following the non-invasive procedure of Harlin et al. [35], preserved in either 90% ETOH
or a solution of 20% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) saturated with salt, and stored at -20Â°C. When possible, DNA
from the same individuals was used to amplify and
sequence all genes. In some cases, pre-existing sequences
from GenBank were used to complete the data matrix
(Table 1).

Fifty-two individuals from eight genera and 18 species in
the family Delphinidae were examined, with emphasis on
representation of the genus Lagenorhynchus and other
members of the subfamily Lissodelphininae (Table 1). All
12 species of the putative subfamily and members of the
genus Lagenorhynchus (i.e., Lagenorhynchus sp., Cephalorhynchus sp., and Lissodelphis sp.) are represented (Table
1). In addition, members of the Tursiops/Delphinus/
Stenella clade identified by LeDuc et al. [13], and the killer
whale (Orcinus orca), a taxon thought to be the basal delphinid lineage [36], were included. Australophocoena dioptrica and Phocoena phocoena from the family Phocoenidae
were selected as outgroup taxa because of their sistertaxon relationship to the Delphinidae [37,38].
DNA isolation and amplification
Total genomic DNA was isolated using either a standard
phenol-chloroform protocol [39] or a Qiagen DNeasy kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, California). The polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was used to amplify fragments of four
genes including: (1) the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene (1040 nucleotides), (2) 474 base
pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial control region, (3) 995 bp
of nuclear DNA (nDNA) intron I of the muscle Actin gene,
and (4) 474 bp of the coding region of the nDNA recombination activating gene 2 (RAG2). External primer sets
included: (1) cyt b â 766F (5'-gaaaaaccaycgttgtwattcaact3') and 766R (5'-gtttaattagaatytyagctttggg-3'); (2) control
region â tRNA-Pro and Dlp5 of Baker et al. [40]; (3) Actin
â Lagenorhynchus-specific LagAct1 (5'-gatttggtccctctat-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/87

gtctct-3' and LagAct2 â 5'-tacttttgaacttgccacctac-3'). Actin
primers were designed from published cetacean
sequences [41] and used to amplify the majority of
ingroup taxa. Act1 [41] and Act1385H (5'-cttgtgaactgattacagtcc-3') (Palumbi, unpublished) were used to amplify
fragments for outgroup taxa and others that failed to
amplify with the Lagenorhynchus-specific primers. RAG2
primers were the same as those reported by Murphy et al.
[42]. PCR conditions were generally consistent across loci
with adjustments made to annealing temperatures.
Approximately 1â2 Î¼l of DNA template were included in
50 Î¼l PCR reactions containing the following: 5 Î¼l each of
10Ã Amplitaq PCR buffer (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts), MgCl (25 mM), and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTP's,10 mM), and 1 Î¼l each of bovine serum
albumin (BSA, 10 mg/ml), each primer (10 Î¼M), and 1 Î¼l
Amplitaq (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts) DNA
polymerase (5 U/Î¼l). Thermocycler conditions were 94Â°C
for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at 92Â°C for 30 s, annealing 30 s, and extension at 72Â°C for 30 s. Published
annealing temperatures were used with the following
exceptions: 765F/766R, 50Â°C; LagActin1/2, 58Â°C; Act1/
1385H, 56Â°C. Amplicons were electrophoresed in 1.5%
agarose-TBE (tris, boric acid, EDTA) and visualized under
UV light, and prior to sequencing, excess oligonucleotides
and dNTP's were removed with either Qiagen (Qiagen,
Valencia, California) spin-columns or an Exonuclease IShrimp Alkaline Phosphotase (Exo-Sap) enzymatic procedure. Approximately 2 ng of cleaned PCR product per 100
bp of amplicon length was sequenced using ABI BigDye
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) cycle
sequencing chemistry and an ABI 377 automated
sequencer. All amplicons were sequenced in both directions. Internal primer pairs for cyt b (560, 5'-gcaaccctaacacgattcttcg-3'; 610, 5'-ccagtttcgtgtaggaataatagg-3')
and Actin (Act5-L, 5'-ccactactttaggcag-3'; M13Act5R-H, 5'tgtaaaacgacggccagtctgcctaaactagtgg-3' (S. Palumbi, unpublished) were used in sequencing reactions to obtain complete overlap in both directions. Sequences generated in
this study are accessioned in the NCBI GenBank database:
(1) Dloop: EF092925âEF092969; (2) Cytb: EF093009â
EF093055; (3) Actin: EF092970âEF093008; (4) RAG2:
EF093056âEF093105.
Sequence alignment and heterozygosity
Sequenced fragments were edited and compiled with the
program Sequencher v. 4.1 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann
Arbor, Michigan). A consensus of sense and anti-sense
strands for each individual and data partition were compiled and exported to MacClade vs. 4.05 [43]. Sequences
of the four data partitions were concatenated into a single
string of nucleotide characters for the same individual
when possible, or a combination of fragments from members of the same species. Cyt b and RAG2 contained no
length variable regions, thus alignment of these fragments

Page 12 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:87

was trivial. Amino acid translations of the open reading
frames of RAG2 and cyt b were examined for stop codons
to verify sequence orthology. Actin fragments contained
minor genus-specific insertions and deletions that were
revealed by alignment in Clustal X [44] with default
parameters. The control region had one (CT)n length variable region of approximately 21 bp that was eliminated
from analyses as primary homology could not be reliably
assessed. There were an additional 29 sites with indels in
the control region, 20 of which were present only in outgroup taxa (A. dioptrica, P. phocoena). Actin had 24 indel
sites in three blocks (4, 8, and 12 sites) that were apomorphic (taxon-specific). All species were represented by fragments from the four data partitions with the exceptions:
(1) C. eutropia, which lacked Actin and RAG2 fragments
because we were not able to obtain tissue samples for this
species, and (2) L. cruciger and L. peronii which lacked
Actin fragments (Table 1).
All nucleotide ambiguities in Actin and RAG2 that
resulted from two different, but equally strong, peaks on
electropherograms were considered as evidence for potential heterozygous sites. All such positions were assigned
IUPAC ambiguity codes, and considered as ambiguous
characters in subsequent phylogenetic analyses. All potential heterozygous sites were species-specific and occurred
in only a single individual of each species. PCR reactions
consistently produced only one Actin or RAG2 amplicon,
which were subjected to a BLAST search to verify sequence
identity. In all BLAST searches, amplicons retrieved
sequences from either delphinid or mammalian taxa as
the closest match, providing further evidence for successful amplification of target loci.
Phylogenetic analyses
Cladograms were generated with the program PAUP*
v.4.0b10 [55] under the optimality criterion of parsimony, with all characters equally weighted. Previous studies suggest that gaps can be phylogenetically informative
in both coding and non-coding regions [45,46], thus all
gaps were considered as 5th states in parsimony analyses.
The number of taxa and characters precluded the use of
exhaustive search options. Therefore, we performed a heuristic search with 1000 random additions of taxa, 100
trees held at each replicate, and tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping. In addition, phylogenetic
analyses were performed separately for mitochondrial (cyt
b and control region) and nuclear (Actin and RAG2) data
sets with the same heuristic search parameters. Clade support for the simultaneous analysis tree was evaluated with
bootstrap [56] and decay indices [57]. The bootstrap procedure was replicated 10,000 times, each as full heuristic
search with random addition of sequences and TBR
branch swapping with 100 trees held at each step. Decay
indices for the simultaneous analysis tree were derived

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/87

from a heuristic search of constraint trees created with the
program TreeRot v.2b [58]. Heuristic search parameters
were the same for the original simultaneous analysis.
There is well-documented variation in the rate of evolution within and among mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes; therefore, a Bayesian analysis was performed
with the program Mr. Bayes v. 3.0 [59] in order to compare phylogenetic hypotheses derived from parsimony
and Bayesian methods. Each data partition was assigned
an independent (unlinked) general-time-reversal (GTR)
model of substitution with a proportion of invariant sites
and variation in substitution rates among sites. Two independent runs of 2 million iterations were performed, each
with four chains, three hot, one cold, sampling one tree in
10. Adequate mixing and convergence of chains was
examined visually with the program Tracer v.1.1.1 [60];
posterior probabilities for each clade were derived from
trees sampled after the burn in period.
The Bayesian method does not have an option for gaps to
be coded as 5th character states, and thus they are treated
as missing data in our Bayesian analysis. Some studies
have used a separate gap matrix to incorporate indels into
Bayesian analyses (e.g., [47]), and recently there have
been advances that allow the explicit treatment of gaps in
the simultaneous derivation of sequence alignment and
tree topology within parsimony, Bayesian, and likelihood
analytical frameworks [48-54]. Such methods are effective
particularly in dealing with regions difficult to align (e.g.,
length variable regions). Since our data set contains relatively few indels, the majority of which are not phylogenetically informative (see above), we opted not to further
explore our data with these methods. Such topics deserve
thorough treatment beyond the scope of this study.
Character dynamics: phylogenetic utility
The behavior of combining characters from different process partitions was evaluated by examining the relative
contribution, or utility, of data partitions to resolving relationships within the simultaneous analysis tree. Branch
support indices were partitioned (i.e., "partitioned Bremer
support") with the method of Baker and DeSalle [16] to
measure the relative contribution of each data set to node
support. The larger the partitioned Bremer support is for a
given partition at a particular node, the greater the relative
contribution of that partition to the support of that node
[16]. We were also interested in the relative phylogenetic
utility of nuclear and mitochondrial data per sequenced
nucleotide. Therefore, we subsequently standardized the
partitioned Bremer values for each node by the number of
nucleotides sequenced.

A number of methods have been proposed to quantify a
posteriori the contribution of a particular data partition to

Page 13 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:87

topological support in a simultaneous analysis [15]. These
methods generally include a measure of the relative
number of unambiguous character changes attributable to
a given data partition [15, 30, 61, 62]. In this study, we
chose to quantify at each node in the simultaneous analysis tree a subset of unambiguous character changes that
have a consistency index (CI) of 1, that is, they change to
one of the four possible states (A, G, C, or T) once only in
the tree at a single node. Because these characters lack
homoplasy in a given tree, we suggest that these characters
are less likely to be affected by data interaction than characters that display homoplasy, and thus are a phylogenetically conservative, and potentially useful, set of characters
for a posteriori evaluation of characters.
We use CI = 1 characters to examine two aspects of data
partition utility (Table 3). First, we wished to determine if
the amount of phylogenetic signal in each data partition
decreases over time (i.e., with level of divergence). The
idea is that if the number of highly consistent CI = 1 characters that a data partition contributes to a node is constant over time (i.e., there is no decay in phylogenetic
signal with increased divergence), we would expect a positive, linear relationship between the number of CI = 1
characters and branch length. This would indicate that a
data partition is well suited to address hypotheses of evolutionary relationships at the levels of divergence present
in this study. Second, we were interested in whether or not
the relative contribution of each data partition to node
resolution was consistent among branches of variable
lengths (Table 3). Consistent patterns of evolution over
time (i.e., the relative frequency and rate of substitutions
at particular nodes) among multiple loci can provide evidence that variation in branch lengths among regions of a
topology represent the actual evolutionary history of a lineage. In this manner it would be possible to determine if
short branches represent periods of rapid or simultaneous
taxonomic divergence (i.e., are "hard" polytomies), or are
a consequence of some aspect of the data, e.g., incompatibility, or a rate of evolution ill suited to resolve short
branches.
To test these hypotheses, we first estimated the number of
CI = 1 characters per branch by labelling all unambiguous
character changes on the simultaneous analysis and independent analysis trees with their consistency index in
MacClade v. 4.01 [43]. Branch lengths (all inter-node distances) were estimated in PAUP* v.4.0b10 [55] by holding the simultaneous analysis tree topology constant and
optimizing character state evolution along branches via
maximum likelihood with empirical base frequencies, a
general-time-reversible (GTR) model, and a gamma shape
parameter estimated from the data (n = 8 categories).
These estimates of branch lengths and the number of CI =
1 characters per branch were used in subsequent testing of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/87

hypotheses regarding phylogenetic utility. To address the
question of phylogenetic signal over time, a linear regression was used to examine the relationship between
branch length and number of CI = 1 characters along each
branch (Table 3). To address the second question of node
resolution, we performed two tests (Table 3). First, a chisquare test for homogeneity of proportions was used to
determine if CI = 1 characters were evenly distributed
within the simultaneous analysis tree with respect to
branch length. Second, a Kruskal-Walis non-parametric
statistic for multiple samples was used to test if the proportion of CI = 1 characters contributed by each data partition was uniform across branches of different lengths.
We pooled data into 4 branch length categories (0â
0.0019; 0.0020â0.0049; 0.0050â0.019; 0.0200â0.0500)
to increase sample sizes for these tests
Additionally, the relative contribution of each partition to
a node was examined by calculating the consistency index
of unambiguous character changes at first, second, and
third codon positions in the simultaneous analysis tree. A
chi-square was used test the null hypothesis of homogeneity of highly consistent characters among codon positions.
All statistical tests were performed with SPSS v. 11 statistical package. Null hypotheses were rejected if P â¤ 0.05.
Character dynamics: data interaction
A Spearman's rank correlation of partitioned Bremer support values was used to determine the nature and significance of interaction among data partitions in the
simultaneous analysis topology. Partitioned Bremer values for data partitions at a particular node can be used as
indicators of conflict among data partitions â positive values indicate support and negative values suggest conflict.
A Spearman's rank correlation of partitioned Bremer support values from the simultaneous analysis tree [63] was
performed to measure the level and magnitude of character interaction on a node-by-node basis. A significantly
positive correlation coefficient is evidence that partitions
support different nodes in similar proportions; a negative
correlation indicates significant conflict among data partitions. A non-significant correlation suggests that topological support is not associated with any combined pairs of
data partitions [17]. We also calculated the "hidden
synapomorphy" [15] index, defined as the difference in
the number of unambiguous character changes at nodes
in simultaneous and separate analyses. The number of
unambiguous changes for each node was determined with
MacClade v.4.01 [43]. A negative hidden synapomorphy
index indicated the displacement, or loss, of unambiguous synapomorphies from a node as a result of combining
data, whereas positive values suggested synergistic data
interaction. The greater the magnitude of the hidden
synapomorphy value, the greater the interaction among
characters at that node. A sign test, a non-parametric ana-

log of the t-test, was used to determine if the simultaneous
analysis had a significant effect on the frequency of
synapomorphy displacement.
