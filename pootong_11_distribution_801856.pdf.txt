Abstract
Background: Campylobacter jejuni, a gram-negative bacterium, is a frequent cause of gastrointestinal food-borne
illness in humans throughout the world. There are several reports that the virulence of C. jejuni might be
modulated by non-flagellar proteins that are secreted through the filament. Recently, FspA (Flagella secreted
proteins) have been described. Two alleles of fspA (fspA1 and fspA2) based on sequence analysis were previously
reported and only the fspA2 allele was found in Thai isolates. The aim of this study is to analyze the deduced
amino acid sequences fspA and the adjacent putative integral membrane protein from 103 Thai C. jejuni isolates.
Results: A total of 103 representative C. jejuni isolates were amplified by PCR for the fspA gene and the adjacent
integral membrane protein gene. Two PCR product sizes were amplified using the same primers, an approximately
1600-bp PCR product from 19 strains that contained fspA and integral membrane protein genes and an
approximately 800-bp PCR product from 84 strains that contained only the fspA gene. DNA sequencing was
performed on the amplified products. The deduced amino acid sequences of both genes were analyzed separately
using CLC Free Workbench 4 software. The analysis revealed three groups of FspA. Only FspA group 1 sequences
(19/103) (corresponding to fspA1) consisting of 5 subgroups were associated with the adjacent gene encoding the
integral membrane protein. FspA group 2 was the largest group (67/103) consisting of 9 subgroups. FspA group 2p
(17/103) consisting of 7 subgroups was found to contain stop codons at a position before the terminal 142 position.
Conclusions: This study reveals greater heterogeneity of FspA (group 1, 2 and 2p) among Thai C. jejuni isolates
than previously reported. Furthermore, the subgroups of FspA groups 1 were associated with groups of integral
membrane protein. The significance of these different FspA variants to virulence requires further study.

Background
Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of gastroenteritis
worldwide especially in children, travelers, military personnel deployed to developing countries. Although these
pathogens are generally considered invasive, the level of
invasion of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro varies among
strains [1]. Despite the high incidence of human disease
and multiple genome sequences [2-5], understanding
about the pathogenesis of diarrheal disease at the molecular level is limited. Genomic studies have indicated
that C. jejuni strains lack specialized type III secretion

systems that are essential to virulence of many other
enteric pathogens [6,7]. There are several reports that flagella can function to secrete non-flagellar proteins that
might modulate virulence.
The Cia (Campylobacter invasion antigen) proteins
[8-10] and FlaC (Flagellin C protein) [11] are non-flagellar
proteins that are secreted through the filament. Recently, a
third secreted protein, FspA (Flagella secreted protein) has
been described [12] and additional candidates have also
been reported recently [13]. Similar to FlaC, FspA is a
small acidic protein is secreted into the supernatant of
broth-grown bacteria. Two alleles of fspA (fspA1 and
fspA2) based on sequence analysis were found in previous
reports that examined strains from diverse geographical
areas. The entirety of the Thai isolates tested in this

previous study contained fspA2 alleles. Recombinant proteins encoded by an fspA1 allele from strain 81-176 and by
an fspA2 allele from strain CG8486, a clinical isolate from
Thailand [5] were studied previously. These studies
revealed that recombinant FspA2 bound to intestinal
epithelial cells in vitro and also induced apoptosis, whereas
recombinant FspA1 did not [12]. Thus, only one form of
the FspA protein appeared toxic to eukaryotic cells, but
the mechanism and significance to virulence remains to be
determined. Moreover, the study of immunogenicity and
protective efficacy of FspA1 and FspA2 were compared in
a mouse intranasal model. Immunization with FspA1
resulted in higher protection against homologous challenge with 81-176, which expresses the homologous
FspA1, and CG8486, which expresses FspA2; immune
protection with FspA2 was less robust against both strains
[14]. Genomes presenting fspA2 allele (encoded from
Cj0859c gene in reference strain NCTC11168) have been
reported to systematically lack the adjacent gene Cj0860, a
putative integral membrane protein. In contrast, the fspA1
allele was adjacent to the integral membrane protein gene
[12]. However, no functional relation has been reported
between these two proteins. Additionally, another report
[15] showed FspA variants and MLST associations among
human, poultry and bovine Campylobacter jejuni strains.
A significant high isolation rate of C. jejuni in Thailand and potential role of the FspA protein as one of
vaccine candidate lead us to further characterize the
deduced amino acid sequences fspA and the adjacent
putative integral membrane protein from additional
Thai C. jejuni isolates.

Results and Discussion
The 103 C. jejuni isolates representing clusters from a
previous PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis) cluster
analysis of C. jejuni isolates from the diarrhea studies on
adults in Thailand were selected for this study [16]. We
investigated the variation of FspA and integral membrane
protein by DNA sequencing of PCR products and analyzed their deduced amino acid sequences.
PCR and sequencing

Cj0859c and Cj0860, if present, were amplified from
DNA samples of the strains. Approximate 1600-bp PCR
products containing both genes were obtained from 19
strains and approximate 800-bp PCR products containing
only Cj0859c were obtained from 84 strains. Both PCR
product sizes were amplified using the same pg06.14 and
pg06.15 primers. The deduced amino acid sequences of
both genes were analyzed separately.
Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of FspA

The phylogenetic tree of predicted FspA sequences is
shown in Figure 1. Twenty one amino acid patterns were

found that clustered to 3 groups of FspA. FspA group 1
[GenBank:HQ909220 to: HQ909238] was similar to
FspA1 as previously reported [12] and comprised 18.4%
(19/103) of the total strains and consisted of 5 subgroups.
All 5 subgroups were derived from only the 1600-bp PCR
product that also contains an adjacent integral membrane
protein gene as well. All subgroups in group 2 and 2p
were derived from only the 800-bp PCR product. FspA
group 2 [GenBank:HQ909136 to: HQ909202] was similar
to FspA2 in the previous report [12]. FspA group 2 consisted of 9 subgroups and was the largest group in this
study (65%, 67/103). In contrast, fspA1 (69.5%) was significantly more common than fspA2 (30%) among Finnish human strains [15]. FspA group 2p [GenBank:
HQ909203 to: HQ909219] comprised 16.5% (17/103) of
the total strains and consisted of 7 subgroups. Each subgroup of group 2p consists of 1-4 strains. FspA group 2p
sequences were similar to FspA group 2 sequences
(Figure 2), however FspA group 2p sequences were found
to contain a stop codon at a position that before the
terminal 142 position. Consequently, the predicted FspA
group 2p amino acid sequences were shorter than the
FspA group 2 sequences. As a result, FspA group 2p was
treated as a novel group. Further studies are needed to
determine if these sequences are expressed as malfunctioning end product of FspA. In conclusion, our study
reveals greater heterogeneity of FspA (group 1, 2 and 2p)
among Thai C. jejuni isolates than a previous report that
found only FspA2 in Thailand [12].
Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of FspA

Each subgroup in FspA group 1 was aligned and compared with reference sequence, C. jejuni 81-176 (Table 1).
Percent identities of the alignment with reference
sequence ranged from 82% (117/142) to 100% (142/142).
The most common amino acid sequence pattern (100%
identity), classified as subgroup 1A was observed from 13
C. jejuni isolates of this group of 19 isolates. There were
amino acid changes in subgroup 1B, 1D and 1E sequences,
whereas internal deletions were found in subgroup 1C.
For FspA group 2, each subgroup was aligned and compared with reference sequence, C. jejuni CG8486. Percent
identities of the alignment with the reference sequence
ranged from 95% (135/142) to 100% (142/142). The most
common amino acid sequence pattern (100% identity),
classified as subgroup 2A was observed from 42 C. jejuni
isolates of this group (67 isolates). There were amino acid
changes in sequences of subgroup 2B to 2I. Each subgroup
of FspA group 2p was aligned and compared with reference sequence, C. jejuni CG8486. The percent identities of
the alignment with reference sequence ranged from 25%
(35/142) to 95% (135/142). Amino acid changes and deletion points were found within all subgroups in FspA
group 2p.

performed with 1,000 resamplings and scale bar represent 0.600 substitution per amino acid position.

For FspA group 1, percent identity within the group
without reference sequence was 97.18%, except for
strain BHC-01-360. The BHC-01-360 strain was
aligned with C. jejuni 81-176 and showed 25 deleted
amino acids. The percent identity within FspA group 2

without reference sequence was 88.73%. The results
imply that FspA group 1 is more conserved than FspA
group 2. This is in contrast to the results in preceding
report that FspA1alleles were less conserved than
FspA2 [12].

The FspA group 1 consensus sequence encoded a predicted soluble cytoplasmic protein of 15.5 kDa, pI 4.84,
and the FspA group 2 consensus sequence encoded a
predicted soluble cytoplasmic protein of 16.0 kDa, pI
5.96. Additionally, the two variants were only 40.14%
identical at the protein level (Figure 2). Therefore, FspA
group 1 is obviously distinguishable from FspA group 2,
as reported previously.
Analysis of the deduced Cj0860 protein sequences

Predicted protein sequences encoded by the Cj0860
alleles were derived from the 1600-bp PCR products
that contain fspA group 1 gene as well. The integral
membrane protein [GenBank:HQ909239 to: HQ909257]
was found in only 18.4% (19/103) and clustered to 4
groups. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced integral membrane protein sequences was carried out as shown as
Figure 3.
Alignment of the deduced Cj0860 protein sequences

Each group was aligned and compared with reference
sequence, C. jejuni 81-176. Percent identities of the
alignment with reference sequence ranged from 98%
(286/290) to 99% (289/290). The most common amino
acid sequence pattern (99% identity) was observed from
14 C. jejuni isolates of total 19 isolates. Amino acid
changes were present in all groups. The analysis of
alignment is summarized in Table 2. Percent identity
within the group without reference sequence was
97.59%.

Association between subgroups of fspA group 1 and
Cj0860 alleles

As reported previously, only fspA group 1 alleles were
associated with Cj0860 alleles. Furthermore, each subgroup of FspA group 1 was associated with each group
of integral membrane protein. Subgroup 1A of FspA
group 1 included 1E that has only one amino acid different from 1A, were associated with group A of integral
membrane protein. Subgroup 1B, 1C and 1D of FspA
group1 were associated with group B, C and D of integral membrane protein, respectively. The associations
are shown in Figure 1 and 3.
It has been known that only FspA group 1 encoding
gene was adjacent to integral membrane protein gene.
Moreover, each subgroup of FspA group 1 is linked
with a specific allele of the integral membrane protein.
This may imply that integral membrane proteins relate
to virulence of FspA or that the two proteins co-evolved
from a common precursor. However, this remains to be
determined and more information about the functional
association of the two proteins remains lacking.

Conclusions
This study reveals greater heterogeneity of FspA (group
1, 2 and 2p) among Thai C. jejuni isolates than previously
reported [12]. This may be because the selected C. jejuni
isolates for this study were representative isolates from of
PFGE clusters of isolates from multiple diarrhea studies
in Thailand [16]. Moreover, these isolates were obtained
from various regions of Thailand over time suggesting

spatial and temporal distribution among C. jejuni isolates
in Thailand, whereas all previously examined Thai isolates were from the 1999 Cobra Gold exercises [12].
Interestingly, the association of only the FspA group 1
gene with the Cj0860 alleles that was reported previously
continued to be found in these additional strains. Moreover, subgroups of FspA group 1 were associated with
specific groups of Cj0860. However, the significance of
the observed differences and the roles of these genes in
virulence need further study.

Methods
Bacterial strains

Of three hundred and thirty four C. jejuni isolates, 274 isolates were from US soldiers with diarrhea who participated
in the Cobra Gold exercises during 1998-2003 and 60 isolates were from foreigners and Thai adults with diarrhea
seen at Bumrungrad Hospital in 2001-2002. The 334 isolates had been previously clustered by PFGE analysis. A
dendrogram of PFGE patterns was generated and grouped
into 103 clusters. A total of 103 C. jejuni isolates representative of each cluster from the PFGE analysis were selected
for this study [16]. Among 103 C. jejuni isolates, 76 isolates were isolated from the US soldiers in the Cobra Gold
exercises and 27 isolates were isolated from the foreigners
and Thai adults at Bumrungrad Hospital in Bangkok. All
C. jejuni isolates were kept at -70 °C in glycerol medium
and later were subsequently grown on blood agar plate
(BD Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA.) and incubated
at 37 °C for 48 h under microaerobic condition. All isolates were from stool samples collected with informed
consent under human use protocols approved by the
appropriate ethical review committees.
PCR of alleles of Cj0859c (fspA) and Cj0860

DNA templates were extracted from fresh, subcultured C.
jejuni isolates after 48 h incubation using DNeasy tissue
kits (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The samples of
DNA were estimated for purity and quantity by gel electrophoresis compared to the known molecular weight
marker and these DNA were kept at -20 °C for further use
as DNA template for PCR. The fspA gene (Cj0859c) and
the adjacent integral membrane protein gene (Cj0860), if
present, were amplified using 0.4 μM of primer pg06.14 (5’

-CCTATTTATGGATTGCAATTTCACCCCG -3’) that
bound to pabA gene (Cj0861) and 0.4 μM of primer
pg06.15 (5’ -CTTGAAACGATCAAGGGTAGGGCAGC
-3’) that bound to murA (Cj0858c) [12] in 50-μl reactions
containing 1-10 ng DNA template, 1 × PCR buffer II,
3.0 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM each dNTP and 2.5 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems). DNA
amplification was performed using an initial denaturation
step at 94 °C for 5 min; followed by 35 cycles of amplification (denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C
for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min) and ending
with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplification
products were purified for sequencing by Wizard SV gel
and PCR clean-up system (Promega, WI, USA).
Sequencing of PCR products and analysis of sequences

All amplified products were submitted for sequencing
commercially (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea). An
approximately 800-bp PCR products were sequenced
using the two PCR primers (pg06.14 and pg06.15) as previously described, whereas 1600-bp PCR products were
sequenced using the two PCR primers (pg06.14 and
pg06.15) and primer pg0553re (5’- GCTATTTAAGGAATTGTTAATTTGCAT-3’). The DNA sequences
were edited and assembled by Sequencher software version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, MI, USA). The
deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed for their
heterogeneity such as alignment, clustering and sequence
information using CLC Free Workbench 4 software [17].
C. jejuni 81-176 [GenBank:CP000538] and CG8486 [GenBank:EF058232] were used as reference sequences.
