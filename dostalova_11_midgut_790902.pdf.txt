Abstract
Background: Parasite-vector interactions are fundamental in the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as
leishmaniasis. Leishmania development in the vector sand fly is confined to the digestive tract, where sand fly
midgut molecules interact with the parasites. In this work we sequenced and analyzed two midgut-specific cDNA
libraries from sugar fed and blood fed female Phlebotomus perniciosus and compared the transcript expression
profiles.
Results: A total of 4111 high quality sequences were obtained from the two libraries and assembled into 370
contigs and 1085 singletons. Molecules with putative roles in blood meal digestion, peritrophic matrix formation,
immunity and response to oxidative stress were identified, including proteins that were not previously reported in
sand flies. These molecules were evaluated relative to other published sand fly transcripts. Comparative analysis of
the two libraries revealed transcripts differentially expressed in response to blood feeding. Molecules up regulated
by blood feeding include a putative peritrophin (PperPer1), two chymotrypsin-like proteins (PperChym1 and
PperChym2), a putative trypsin (PperTryp3) and four putative microvillar proteins (PperMVP1, 2, 4 and 5). Additionally,
several transcripts were more abundant in the sugar fed midgut, such as two putative trypsins (PperTryp1 and
PperTryp2), a chymotrypsin (PperChym3) and a microvillar protein (PperMVP3). We performed a detailed temporal
expression profile analysis of the putative trypsin transcripts using qPCR and confirmed the expression of bloodinduced and blood-repressed trypsins. Trypsin expression was measured in Leishmania infantum-infected and
uninfected sand flies, which identified the L. infantum-induced down regulation of PperTryp3 at 24 hours postblood meal.
Conclusion: This midgut tissue-specific transcriptome provides insight into the molecules expressed in the midgut
of P. perniciosus, an important vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Old World. Through the comparative analysis
of the libraries we identified molecules differentially expressed during blood meal digestion. Additionally, this study
provides a detailed comparison to transcripts of other sand flies. Moreover, our analysis of putative trypsins
demonstrated that L. infantum infection can reduce the transcript abundance of trypsin PperTryp3 in the midgut of
P. perniciosus.

Background
Leishmaniases are a group of vector-borne diseases
caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania.
Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi) is the main etiological agent of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis, the most
deadly form of the disease. The lack of a human vaccine,
increasing resistance to the currently used drugs and
their serious side effects urge the need for research of
visceral leishmaniasis. In the western and central part of
the Mediterranean basin, the major vector of L. infantum is Phlebotomus perniciosus [1].
Leishmania amastigotes are ingested with the blood
meal upon female sand fly feeding on the mammalian
host. After a series of morphological changes, propagation and migration of the parasites to the anterior part
of the midgut, the infection is transmitted to another
host during the next blood feeding. In hematophagous
arthropods, blood feeding induces a number of processes including digestion, metabolism, diuresis and egg
development. Unlike many other arthropod-borne infections, e.g., Plasmodium in mosquitoes, Leishmania complete their whole developmental cycle within the midgut
of the sand fly. Several natural barriers to Leishmania
development in the midgut have been described including the secreted proteolytic enzymes, the peritrophic
matrix surrounding the ingested blood meal and the
necessity to bind to the midgut epithelium (reviewed by
[2]). Thus, the midgut is the primary organ where interactions between the vector sand fly and the parasite
occur and it represents a key target for interruption of
Leishmania transmission.
While the genome sequences of several Leishmania
species, including L. infantum, have been published [3]
and molecular studies abound, molecular data on sand
flies are limited. An analysis of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) from the whole Lutzomyia longipalpis sand fly
and salivary gland transcriptomes of several sand fly species have been published (reviewed by [4]). With regard
to Leishmania development in the midgut, particularly
midgut-specific transcriptomic analyses, studies of L.
longipalpis and Phlebotomus papatasi [5-7] have brought
important insights into the repertoire of molecules
expressed in the midgut. Several midgut proteins from
these two species were functionally characterized [8] and
shown to impact Leishmania development [9,10].
In this study, we have generated and sequenced two
cDNA libraries from the midgut tissue of P. perniciosus
and analysed sequences present both before and after
blood feeding. Furthermore, we provide phylogenetic
analysis and comparison with the midgut molecules
described in L. longipalpis and P. papatasi. Comparison
of these three species is especially valuable with regard
to Leishmania transmission. P. papatasi is the principal
vector of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania

major in the Old World [1]. It is refractory to the development of other species of Leishmania [11]. Lutzomyia
longipalpis is the vector of L. infantum (chagasi) in
Latin America and is considered a permissive vector due
to full development of various Leishmania species in
laboratory infections [1,12]. While being phylogenetically
closer to P. papatasi, in some aspects P. perniciosus
resembles L. longipalpis. First, it is a natural vector of
L. infantum. Second, it is also permissive to the development of other Leishmania species [13]. Therefore, the
present study provides a valuable database for identification of vector molecules that affect the vectorial competence of sand flies.

Results and Discussion
In order to gain insight into the spectrum of molecules
present in the P. perniciosus midgut, two cDNA libraries
from this organ were constructed, sequenced and analysed. The first library was constructed from a pool of
midguts from sand flies allowed to feed on sucrose solution (sugar fed). For the construction of the second
library (blood fed), midguts from sand flies 4-6 h, 24 h,
2, 3 and 4 days after blood feeding were pooled. These
time points cover the course of blood digestion, allowing
us to identify molecules transcribed in response to blood
feeding. In total, 4511 clones were sequenced and 91%
of the sequences were of high quality and included in
subsequent analyses. Analysis was performed on 2049
and 2062 sequences for the sugar fed and blood fed
libraries, respectively. These sequences were deposited
in the NCBI dbEST database under accession numbers
[GenBank:GW815603-GW820028]. The comparable
number of high quality sequences in each library allows
for a better comparison of sequence abundance of specific molecules of interest in the libraries. The bioinformatic analyses of the sequences were performed using
the dCAS cDNA annotation software [14]. Sequences
were clustered together based on sequence homology
and produced 207 and 163 contigs and 712 and 553 singletons (cluster with only one sequence) for the sugar
fed and blood fed libraries, respectively. The average
sequence per contig ratio was higher in the blood fed
library (9.26) than in the sugar fed one (6.46), attributed
to the strong induction of certain sequences after blood
feeding (such as sequences coding for putative microvillar proteins, proteolytic enzymes and peritrophins, as
discussed later). Combining the two libraries produced
370 contigs, 1085 singletons and an average ratio of 8.18
sequences per contig. Most of the clusters (890) had a
significant (E<10E-5) BLASTX match to the NCBI nonredundant protein database. However, 565 clusters,
mostly singletons, produced no match or low homology
and these clusters likely represent transcript coding for
novel proteins or potential non-coding regions. Clusters

were assigned to general functional classes using the
best match BLAST results of the KOG database as a
guideline. The overall distribution of clusters in these
functional classes in the two libraries is shown in
Figure 1. The distribution illustrates the abundance of
microvillar proteins and proteins involved in amino acid
transport and metabolism (a category including proteolytic enzymes) after blood feeding.
The following paragraphs give a detailed description of
the most abundant sequences identified in the libraries
and sequences that are of interest with respect to the midgut physiology and Leishmania life cycle. The sequences,
their putative functions and distribution in the two
libraries are listed in Table 1. Table 2 shows the best
matches the sequences produced when compared to the
NCBI non-redundant protein database using BLASTp.
Trypsins

Proteolytic enzymes were among the most abundant
sequences detected in the libraries. Three putative trypsins were identified. PperTryp1 [GenBank:EZ933288],
cluster 46, was one of the most abundant transcripts
overall, strongly overrepresented in the sugar fed library
(513 of 533 sequences). The putative protein has a predicted molecular weight of 27.6 kDa after cleavage of
the signal peptide and a pI of 5.41. PperTryp2 [GenBank:EZ933289], cluster 16, is a less abundant (10
sequences) putative trypsin that was only detected in
the sugar fed library. The putative mature protein has a
predicted molecular weight of 26.9 kDa and a high pI of
8.83 (similar to a putative P. papatasi trypsin, PpTryp3
[GenBank:AAM96942]. Sequences coding for a third
putative trypsin named PperTryp3 [GenBank:EZ933290]

the KOG database (E<10E-5) was used as a guideline for grouping
the sequences into the functional classes.

(cluster 63, 5’ truncated) originated from the blood fed
midgut library. In blood fed midguts we also identified a
few partial transcripts, coding for a putative variant of
this protein (5 sequences represented by clone
PPRGFL_P8_H08, [GenBank:GW817404], Cluster 61).
This Cluster 61 variant shows 82% identity to PperTryp3 at the amino acid level. Multiple sequence alignment of the putative P. perniciosus trypsin molecules
(Figure 2) shows that structural cysteines, the H/D/S
catalytic triad and putative substrate specifying residues
are well conserved. Both PperTryp1 and PperTryp2, for
which we obtained the full-length sequence of the transcripts, are pre-pro-peptides; having a predicted signal
peptide and a putative pro-peptide cleavage site for activation of the mature protein.
In order to describe the expression dynamics of the
identified putative trypsin molecules, we performed a
qPCR analysis of the three transcripts before, and at several time points after, blood feeding. The results (Figure 3)
correlate with the sequence abundance in the two libraries,
proving the validity of the library comparison approach. In
addition, the qPCR analysis provides a more detailed view
of the trypsin expression after blood feeding. PperTryp1,
the most abundant trypsin identified, was down regulated
as soon as 6 h after blood feeding and further suppressed
24 h post-blood meal (about 1/50 th of pre-blood meal
levels). Its expression returned to the pre-blood meal levels
in the sand flies that had passed the remnants of blood
meal. PperTryp2 was detected in lower amounts (about 1/
70th of PperTryp1) and represents another trypsin down
regulated by blood feeding, with a time course similar to
that observed for PperTryp1. In contrast, the qPCR analysis confirmed PperTryp3 as the main blood feedinginduced trypsin molecule. PperTryp3 expression was
already elevated after 6 h and the highest quantity of the
transcripts was observed 24 h post-blood meal. PperTryp3
returned to negligible amounts in sand flies that had finished blood digestion.
This study brings the first expression analysis of sand
fly trypsins using precise quantification by the means of
qPCR. The observed P. perniciosus trypsin expression
profile is in accordance with the results of earlier studies
of P. papatasi and L. longipalpis midgut trypsin abundance from data acquired by semi-quantitative endpoint PCR [15,16] and comparison of transcript abundance in cDNA libraries before and after blood feeding
[5,6]. In all the three species, one or several trypsin transcripts (see Figure 4 for sequence accession numbers)
are present in high abundance in sugar fed females
while their quantities decrease after the intake of blood
(PperTryp1, PperTryp2, LlTryp2, PpTryp1, PpTryp2). At
the same time, the expression of other putative trypsins
(PperTryp3, LlTryp1 and PpTryp4) is induced upon
blood feeding.

Phylogenetic analysis of the putative trypsins (Figure
4) shows that the sequences abundant before blood
feeding share similarity and, together with LuloTryp4
(reported in similar numbers both from blood fed and
sugar fed L. longipalpis sand flies), form a clade apart
from the other sand fly trypsins that include PperTryp3.
The predicted pre-pro-peptide structure and high abundance of transcripts in sugar fed sand flies together with

the virtual absence of trypsin-like enzymatic activity in
sugar fed sand fly midguts [17] suggests that PperTryp1,
PperTryp2 and their respective homologs are associated
with initial blood meal digestion as they can be quickly
translated and processed following blood feeding.
The onslaught of proteolytic activity after the intake of
blood is one of the barriers for Leishmania development
in the midgut [2]. Sant’Anna et al. [10] have shown that

suppression of the major blood meal-induced trypsin
(LlTryp1) in L. longipalpis by the means of RNAi
enhances the survival of L. mexicana in the midgut.
Some studies have demonstrated the ability of L. major
and L. infantum to suppress or delay the peak of trypsin
activity in the midgut [18-20]. Transcriptomic studies
[5,6] have also shown modulation of trypsin-like

transcript abundance in P. papatasi and L. longipalpis
midgut in the presence of Leishmania parasites. qPCR
was used to measure trypsin expression in infected sand
flies to evaluate modulation of the P. perniciosus midgut
trypsins by L. infantum. Our analysis showed that the
amount of PperTryp3, the major blood meal-induced
trypsin, is decreased in the presence of L. infantum

(Figure 3). This difference was observed in sand flies 24
hours post-blood meal, which correlated with the peak
of PperTryp3 expression in uninfected blood fed sand
flies. Our findings suggest the ability of L. infantum to
suppress or delay the expression of the major bloodinduced trypsin in P. perniciosus and identify this molecule as an interesting candidate for future studies.
Chymotrypsins

Chymotrypsin-like enzymes are another group of proteases found in abundance in the midgut of sand flies

and mosquitoes. Five clusters coding for putative chymotrypsins were identified in the libraries and each cluster was 5’ truncated. PperChym1 [GenBank:EZ933296],
cluster 81, was the most abundant and was only
detected in the blood fed midgut library (82 sequences).
Similarly, the second most abundant chymotrypsin-like
sequence, PperChym2 [GenBank:EZ933297], cluster 102,
probably codes for a digestive enzyme up-regulated by
blood feeding as 11 of the 13 sequences were found in
the blood fed library. In contrast, PperChym3 [GenBank:
EZ933298], cluster 1033, and PperChym4 [GenBank:

10 days). Each column represents the mean of ten females. S, sugar

EZ933299], cluster 816, sequences were only found in
the sugar fed sand fly library. The expression pattern of
these chymotrypsins is similar to the aforementioned trypsin molecules indicating that there may be early and late
classes of serine proteases in sand flies, similar to what has
been observed in mosquitoes[21] The least abundant putative chymotrypsin sequence PperChym5 [GenBank:
EZ933300], cluster 710, was represented by one sequence
in each of the libraries. The phylogenetic analysis of amino
acid sequences (Figure 5) shows conservation in sequence
homology of PperChym1-4 with putative P. papatasi and
L. longipalpis midgut chymotrypsins. PperChym2 formed

a subclade along with LuloChym2 and Ppchym3.
PperChym5 is more distantly related to putative chymotrypsins described in other sand flies. The most similar
sequence in the NCBI non-redundant protein database is
a putative serine protease of Culex quinquefasciatus [GenBank:XP_001845462.1] (E = 1 e-59) and the best match in
the Swissprot database is the white shrimp, Litopenaeus
vannamei, Chymotrypsin BI [Swiss-Prot: Q00871, E = 3 e36] with a proven chymotrypsin catalytic activity. Also, a
conserved serine residue at the substrate specifying site
suggests a chymotrypsin-like specificity of PperChym5
enzyme (Figure 6). The H/D/S catalytic triad and cysteine
residues are well conserved among all the putative P. perniciosus chymotrypsin sequences. Putative chymotrypsin
transcript abundance has previously been shown to be
altered by Leishmania infection in the midgut. LuloChym1A in L. longipalpis and PpChym2 in P. papatasi
were reported as underrepresented in the midgut in the
presence of L. infantum and L. major, respectively [5,6].
Carboxypeptidases

A number of clusters coding for putative proteins with
homology to carboxypeptidases were identified. Two
putative metallo-carboxypeptidases of the M14 A/B subfamily were named PperCpepA and PperCpepB. PperCpepA [GenBank:EZ966131] (cluster 539, 5’ truncated)
shows similarity to carboxypeptidases A described from
mosquitoes. Phylogenetically, PperCpepA clusters more
distantly from the carboxypeptidases A described in the
midgut of other phlebotomine species (Figure 7). Carboxypeptidase A, a zinc-metalloprotease, can hydrolyze

named PperApeptN [GenBank:EZ966135], is similar to
mosquito membrane aminopeptidases of the M1 family
(aminopeptidase N). It was abundant in both libraries
(13 and 7 sequences in blood fed and sugar fed midgut
libraries, respectively). Membrane alanyl aminopeptidases were described in the midgut of many Dipteran
species including mosquitoes, where they were identified
as receptors for Plasmodium ookinetes and also Bacillus
thuringiensis Cry toxin binding [24,25]. In the sand fly
midgut, aminopeptidase activity was detected after blood
feeding, mainly associated with the midgut wall (using
leucine-p-nitroanilide LpNA as a substrate) [17]. This
activity was reduced in P. papatasi and P. langeroni following infection with L. major [19].

aromatic and aliphatic side chains from the C-terminus.
PperCpepB [GenBank:EZ966132] (cluster 217, 5’ truncated) is similar to mosquito and sand fly midgut carboxypeptidase B. Carboxypeptidase B specifically
hydrolyzes C-terminal arginine and lysine. PperCpepB
possesses the conserved aspartate residue at the position
responsible for this specific substrate recognition [22]
(Figure 8). Due to the low number of sequences in this
cluster a comparative analysis between the sugar fed
and blood fed libraries was not possible; however, it is
notable that five of the six sequences of PperCpepB
were contributed by the blood fed library. Anopheles
gambiae midgut carboxypeptidase B has been shown to
be up-regulated by Plasmodium infection and antibodies
against one of these enzymes, CPBAg1 [GenBank:
CAF28572] blocked parasite development in the mosquito midgut [23]. In L. longipalpis, one of the carboxypeptidases transcripts, LuloCpepA1, [GenBank:
ABV60310] was underrepresented in a cDNA library
from L. infantum-infected midgut as compared to uninfected sand flies [6].
Aminopeptidases

A partial transcript coding for a putative alanyl aminopeptidase was identified (cluster 126). The molecule,

Astacins

Two clusters coding for putative astacin-like zinc metalloproteases were identified in the libraries. The more
abundant cluster, PperAstacin1 [GenBank:EZ966133],
cluster 84, is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular weight of 27.0 kDa once secreted and pI of 5.05. It
was present both in the sugar fed and blood fed
libraries. The transcript of cluster 967 was named PperAstacin2 [GenBank:EZ966134] and the predicted translated product has a molecular weight of 26.5 and pI
6.00 after cleavage of the signal peptide. It was only
detected in the sugar fed library. Phylogenetic analysis
of other putative astacin sequences shows that PperAstacin1 is similar to astacin-like molecules previously
described in L. longipalpis, LuloAstacin, [GenBank:
ABV60299] P. papatasi and other Diptera. PperAstacin2
is most similar to a putative astacin from A. gambiae
using BLASTp similarity search of the NCBI non-redundant protein database. However, in a phylogenetic analysis it branches away from all other Dipteran sequences
(Figure 9A). Multiple sequence alignment (Figure 9B)
shows the differences in amino acid sequences and illustrates the conservation of all residues likely responsible
for zinc-binding and catalytic activity in the putative P.
perniciosus astacins.
Microvillar proteins

The most abundant transcripts identified in the library
were sequences coding for proteins with similarity to
major insect allergen proteins. These insect-specific proteins containing insect-allergen domains [InterPro:
IPR010629] were first described as the major human
allergens in the faeces of the cockroaches Blatella germanica and Periplaneta americana [26]. In butterflies of
the Pieridae family, a novel family of proteins with multiple insect-allergen domains has evolved (nitrile-specifier protein family) to serve a role in detoxification of
plant metabolites in the butterfly larvae food [27,28]. In
mosquitoes, proteins with a single insect-allergen

domain have been identified and termed G12 microvillar
proteins. These molecules have been shown to be
induced in the mosquito midgut after blood-feeding
[29,30]. In Aedes aegypti, the G12 protein, AEG12,
[GenBank:AAL05408.1] has been shown to be expressed
only in the midgut after blood feeding and located on
the microvillar membranes of the midgut epithelial cells
[30]. The role of insect allergen proteins, other than
nitrile-specifier protein family in Pieridae, has not yet
been characterized.
We identified five putative homologs of the insectallergen proteins in the P. perniciosus libraries. These
putative microvillar proteins (MVPs) possess a predicted
signal peptide (where full-length sequences were
obtained) and a single insect-allergen domain.
PperMVP1 [GenBank:EZ933291] encodes a putative protein with a mature molecular weight of 21.4 kDa and pI
of 5.16. Derived from 681 sequences (cluster 45 and variants) PperMVP1 was the most abundant transcript
overall. Transcripts of PperMVP1, and three other P.
perniciosus MVPs, were only found in the blood fed
cDNA library. These other blood feeding induced MVPs
include PperMVP2 [GenBank:EZ933292] (cluster 40 and

variants, sequence 5’ truncated), PperMVP4 [GenBank:
EZ933294] (cluster 139, 5’ truncated) and PperMVP5
(EZ933295, cluster 52 and variants; 22 kDa, pI 4.77).
PperMVP4 amino acid sequence, although truncated,
contains predicted glycosylation sites (3 N-glycosylations). The only MVP transcript overrepresented in the
sugar fed library is PperMVP3 [GenBank:EZ933293]
(cluster 52 and variants, 5’ truncated). As demonstrated
in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 10A), the identified
sequences show high similarity to the respective five
MVPs previously identified in the midgut of L. longipalpis. Homologs of four of these proteins are also known
in P. papatasi (PpMVP1-4; Figure 10A). Interestingly,
no sequence with high similarity to PperMVP5 was
found in the midgut of P. papatasi. The phylogenetic
tree also shows that PperMVP3 and its putative orthologues LuloMVP3 and PpMVP3 clade away from all the
other sand fly and mosquito MVPs. This is in accordance with the fact that all the three seem to be downregulated be blood feeding unlike other MVPs. Multiple
sequence alignment (Figure 10B) shows that the five
putative P. perniciosus MVPs share little sequence
homology suggesting that these molecules may have different functions altogether.
Antimicrobial molecules

Several transcripts encode proteins putatively involved
in the immune response of the sand fly midgut. Two
clusters coding for putative peptidoglycan recognition
proteins (PGRPs) were identified. PGRPs play central
and diverse roles in activating insect immune reactions
including the melanization cascade, phagocytosis, and
signal transduction pathways for production of antibacterial peptides. PperPGRPLB [GenBank:EZ617708], cluster 274, is similar to a PGRP previously reported from
L. longipalpis (LuloPGRP) [GenBank:ABV60332], and P.
papatasi (PpPGRP) [GenBank:60369] midgut. Although
the transcript appears to be 5’ truncated, based on
homology to other full length sand fly transcripts we
predict it to be a protein of about 22 kDa. A homologous (but secreted) protein PGRPLB in Drosophila melanogaster [GenBank:AAN13505], mainly expressed in
the midgut, was shown to regulate the Imd signalling
pathway controlling the immune response against
Gram-negative bacteria [31]. An A. gambiae PGRPLB
homolog [GenBank:EAA01800] is induced by both bacterial and Plasmodium infections [32]. PperPGRPLC
[GenBank:EZ617707], cluster 168, transcript 5’ truncated
encodes a putative protein with similarity to insect
PGRPLC proteins that act as membrane-localized peptidoglycan receptors activating the Imd pathway.
PGRPLC-like molecules have not been previously
reported in sand flies. In searching the midgut transcriptomes of sand flies, partial transcripts with homology to

Page 12 of 21

PperPGRPLC were found in P. papatasi [GenBank:
ES347179] and L. longipalpis [GenBank:AM098991]. In
A. gambiae, PGRPLC [GenBank:AGAP005203] signalling controls the size of symbiotic bacteria populations,
intestinal bacterial infections and Plasmodium infections
[33].
In addition to PGRPs, a transcript encoding a putative
gram-negative bacteria binding protein was identified
and named PperGNBP [GenBank:EZ617706], cluster
301, transcript 5’ truncated. Gram-negative bacteriabinding proteins serve as pattern recognition receptors
binding to pathogen-associated beta-1,3-glucans in
insects and they have been shown to play a role in mosquito defence against bacteria and Plasmodium infection
[34].
It is likely that the identified sand fly pattern recognition proteins are involved in protection against bacteria
in the midgut; however, similar to the mosquito homologs, they might also have an impact on Leishmania
infection. Interestingly, Kumar et al. [35] have recently
described a novel secreted peroxidase/dual oxidase system in A. gambiae midgut that catalyses cross-linking of
a dityrosine network on the luminal surface of the
epithelial cells. This network decreases the permeability
of the mucus layer to immune elicitors and thus prevents induction of PGRPs, nitric oxide synthase and
other immune responsive genes. Silencing of the peroxidase/dual oxidase system causes a drastic reduction in
Plasmodium infection in the midgut [35]. We have not
identified any homologs of the components of the peroxidase/dual oxidase system in P. perniciosus midgut in
this analysis. Further studies are needed to see whether
a dityrosine barrier is formed in the sand fly midgut. In
our analysis, we did not detect any antimicrobial peptide
transcripts in the midgut of P. perniciosus, although a
defensin was previously characterized in Phlebotomus
duboscqi midgut [36] and defensin transcripts were also
reported from the midgut of L. longipalpis [6,7].
Oxidative stress molecules

A number of transcripts were identified coding for putative antioxidant enzymes. In hematophagous insects,
blood meal-derived free heme is a strong pro-oxidant
and can tax the midgut antioxidant system. In addition
to their protective role, redox-related molecules were
shown to regulate midgut epithelial immunity and
impact the outcome of bacterial and parasitic infections
in mosquitoes [35,37]
Glutathione S-tranferases (GSTs) and peroxiredoxin

Putative components of the glutathione-thioredoxin system, the central redox homeostasis maintaining pathway
in insects, were found [38,39]. Several transcripts coding
for putative glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), enzymes

catalyzing substrate detoxification by a thiol tripeptide
glutathione, were identified in both libraries. PperGST1
[GenBank:EZ617709], cluster 163, encodes a putative
intracellular GST of the Sigma subfamily. The putative
protein is predicted to be 23.2 kDa and have a pI of
5.00. It is nearly identical to putative Sigma GSTs
described from the midgut of P. papatasi [GenBank:
ABV44736] (98% identity) and L. longipalpis LuloGST1
[GenBank:ABV60329] (97% identity). PperGST2 [GenBank:EZ617710] (cluster 463, 5’ truncated) encodes a
putative transmembrane protein that has homology to
microsomal GSTs of the MAPEG super family. Homologs of PperGST2 were found in the EST databases of P.
papatasi [GenBank:FK811479] and L. longipalpis [GenBank:EW990920]. PperGST3 [GenBank:EZ617711] (cluster 1322, 5’ truncated) shares similarity with other
Dipteran GSTs of the Theta class, a class not previously
reported in sand flies. A homolog of PperGST3 was
identified by searching the L. longipalpis whole fly
cDNA library [GenBank:AM099640] [40]. Unlike the
midgut transcriptomes of P. papatasi and L. longipalpis,
we have not found any GSTs of the Delta/Epsilon class,
which may be due to the overall low abundance of the
GST transcripts in sand fly midguts. Mosquito GSTs
play an important role in as antioxidants and knockdown of GSTs of the Theta family has been reported to
impact Plasmodium infections in A. gambiae and A. stephensi, although the effect varies with different parasitevector combinations [41].
A putative peroxiredoxin (or thioredoxin-dependent
peroxidase), product of cluster 729, was identified and
named PperPRX [GenBank:HM119220]. PperPRX
encodes a putative intracellular protein of 16.7 kDa and
a pI of 7.1 containing a peroxiredoxin PRX5-like subfamily domain. Salp25D [GenBank:AF209911], a peroxiredoxin in the tick Ixodes scapularis, has been shown
to facilitate the acquisition of Borrelia from an infected
host by detoxifying reactive oxygen species at the vector-pathogen-host interface [42]. Midgut-specific
Salp25D, while not significantly aiding the establishment
of Borrelia, does have a slight protective effect. It is possible that sand fly peroxiredoxins, by detoxifying OH
radicals, could have a similar protective effect on Leishmania parasites.
Catalase and superoxide dismutases (SODs)

Transcripts coding for putative enzymes of the superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase system were also identified. PperCat [GenBank:EZ617712], cluster 852, encodes
a putative intracellular protein (molecular weight 57.7
kDa and pI 9.17) containing a catalase domain. It shares
high similarity with a putative catalase molecule
described in L. longipalpis midgut, LuloCat, [GenBank:
ABV60342] and a similar sequence was also found in

Page 14 of 21

the P. papatasi midgut cDNA library [GenBank:
ES351062]. Catalases are hydrogen peroxide detoxifying
enzymes and for an A. gambiae homolog [GenBank:
AGAP004904], expression is induced in the midgut after
blood feeding in response to oxidative stress [43]. In the
P. perniciosus midgut, the transcript was only found in
the sugar fed library (9 sequences) and thus appears to
be down regulated by blood feeding. A similar phenomenon could not be observed in L. longipalpis due to the
low number of catalase sequences found (where one
LuloCat transcript was found in the blood fed and one
in the post-blood fed library infected with L. chagasi).
The significance of PperCat down regulation by blood
feeding remains unclear and post-transcriptional regulation cannot be excluded.
Two clusters with products containing copper-zinc
superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) domains were identified. PperSOD1 [GenBank:EZ617713], cluster 892,
encodes a protein similar to a putative secreted Cu-Zn
SOD from the midgut of L. longipalpis, LuloSOD, [GenBank:ABV60343]. Despite the transcript being 5’ truncated, based on homology to the Lutzomyia and
mosquito molecules we predict the protein possesses a
signal peptide and performs a similar function to LuloSOD. The molecule may be secreted or, given that the
sequence contains a putative GPI-anchor site, GPIanchored to the plasma membrane of the midgut cells.
PperSOD2 [GenBank:EZ617714], cluster 1166, encodes a
putative intracellular protein (15.3 kDa, pI 6.3) similar
to putative mosquito SODs. Intracellular SODs have not
been previously described in the sand fly midgut, but
when searched for homologous sequences, we found
sequences coding for highly similar proteins in both L.
longipalpis and P. papatasi midgut cDNA libraries
[GenBank:EW987718 and GenBank:ES348811, respectively]. Phylogenetic analysis of mosquito and sand fly
sequences (Figure 11) shows that extracellular and intracellular Cu-Zn SODs form two distinct clades suggesting the two forms of the enzymes evolved prior to
speciation of the two groups of organisms.
Xanthine dehydrogenase

Cluster 373 [GenBank:EZ617715], PperXDH, is a partial
transcript coding for a product with high similarity to
the C-terminal portion of L. longipalpis xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) [GenBank:CAP08999.1]. XDHs catalyze the oxidation of xanthine to urate, the main
product of nitrogen metabolism, which has antioxidant
properties in insects. The XDH molecule has been
shown to be up regulated after blood feeding in L. longipalpis. Silencing of L. longipalpis XDH resulted in a
reduction in urate production and a reduced life span of
both sugar fed and blood fed sand flies [44]. These
results suggest that xanthine dehydrogenases are indeed

involved in preventing oxidative damage by producing
the antioxidant urate in sand flies.
Ferritin

Two molecules were identified with homology to ferritins described from other insect species including the
sand flies P. papatasi and L. longipalpis. Similar to most
insect ferritins, and unlike most vertebrate and plant ferritins, these molecules are likely secreted. PperFLC
[GenBank:EZ617716], cluster 88, encodes a putative protein with homology to ferritin light-chain subunit and a
molecular weight of 24.3 kDa and pI 6.68, once secreted.
PperFHC [GenBank:EZ617717], cluster 332, encodes a
putative ferritin heavy-chain molecule. Although 5’ truncated, PperFHC has high homology to P. papatasi and
other species ferritin molecules with signal peptides and
is likely similarly secreted. The transcripts originated in
similar numbers from the blood fed and sugar fed
libraries. Apart from their role in iron metabolism, these
sand fly midgut ferritins may also play a role in preventing oxidative damage by sequestering large quantities of
free iron from the digested blood meal as was suggested
for other blood-feeding insects [45].

the blood fed library. These proteins share homology
with molecules previously identified in other sand fly
species and contain chitin binding domains (CBDs).
PperPer1 [GenBank:EZ933302], cluster 97, encodes a
protein similar to putative peritrophins with four CBDs
previously described from the midgut of L. longipalpis
(LuloPer1) [GenBank:ABV60306] and P. papatasi
(PpPer1) [GenBank:ABV44705]. PperPer1 is represented
by 94 sequences found only in the blood fed library.
Although PperPer1 ESTs appears to be incomplete at
the 5’ end and missing the first 13 N-terminal amino
acids, based on homology, we predict it to be a secreted
molecule of mature molecular weight of 28.2 kDa and
pI 4.68. PperPer2 [GenBank:HM119221], cluster 330,
encodes a putative peritrophin with similarity to a L.
longipalpis protein LuloPer2 [GenBank:ABV60320]containing one CBD. A third putative peritrophin, PperPer3
[GenBank:HM119222], cluster 156, shows similarity to a
P. papatasi peritrophin PpPer3 [GenBank:ABV44751]
and contains two putative CBDs (one partial CBD
sequenced due to a 5’ truncation). Phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 12) of the CBDs from P. perniciosus, P. papatasi
and L. longipalpis illustrates a high degree of conservation of the Peritrophin1 arrangement. The four peritrophin domains share respective homology in all the three
sand fly species.
A cluster coding for a putative chitinase was identified

[GenBank:EZ933285] (cluster 124) encodes a putative
protein containing a CBD and a mucin-like domain and
shares high similarity to P. papatasi PpChit1 [GenBank:
AAV49322] and L. longipalpis LlChit1 [GenBank:
AAN71763] chitinases. These midgut-specific, blood
meal-induced enzymes have been shown to account for
chytinolytic activity in the sand fly midgut and have
been implicated in the release of Leishmania parasites
from the endoperitrophic space [8,46,47].
Along with peritrophins and chitinases, non-chitin
binding peritrophic matrix proteins have also been
described from bloodsucking insects. Dinglasan et al.
[48] performed a proteomic analysis of A. gambiae peritrophic matrix and identified a number of non-chitinbinding proteins including proteolytic enzymes and
novel classes of PM proteins with unknown function.
We identified clusters with homology to these proteins
in the P. perniciosus libraries. The product of cluster
379 [GenBank:EZ933287] is highly similar to A. gambiae
PM protein [GenBank:AGAP006398]. The transcript
contains a potential N-glycosylation site and 3 DM9
repeats (repeats of unknown function found in a number of arthropod proteins). A homolog was found in the
P. papatasi midgut library (31.5 kDa midgut protein),
[GenBank:ABV44721]. The product of cluster 358 [GenBank:EZ933286] (5’ truncated) showed a significant
similarity (BLASTp match E = 4e-18) to an A. gambiae
PM protein [GenBank:AGAP000570]. The sequences
originated from both blood fed (3 sequences) and sugar
fed (10 sequences) libraries. Homologous proteins were
also found in the midgut of P. papatasi [GenBank:
ABV44744] and L. longipalpis [GenBank:ABV60298]
and also the salivary glands of P. duboscqi [GenBank:
ABI20163]. These proteins contain no described conserved domains. Based on homology to the A. gambiae
protein found in the PM, we speculate that the product
of cluster 358 may also be involved in the PM formation
in sand flies. On the other hand, its expression in the
sugar fed midgut as well as the presence of homologs in
the salivary glands may suggest a different function for
this protein, such as regulating the haemostatic
response.
The structure of the mosquito and sand fly peritrophic
matrix is complex and rearranges during the course of
blood digestion [49]. The two putative peritrophins with
multiple CBDs (PperPer1 and PperPer3) are likely to
have a role in cross-linking the chitin fibrils of the peritrophic matrix. In addition to chitin binding, mosquito
proteins with CBDs have also been described to bind
heme and have a role in its sequestration during blood
digestion [50]. Also, the glycosylation of the PM proteins can be of great importance for the PM structure
and function. Two of the putative peritrophins, PperPer2 and PperPer3, and the putative chitinase, PperChit,

Page 16 of 21

contain mucin-like (Pro-Ser/Thr rich) domains. Glycosylation of these domains can influence the selectiveness
of the PM pores, account for water retention within the
PM and also protect the molecules from degradation by
proteolytic enzymes. Furthermore, the degradation of
putatively aglycosylated PM proteins (like PperPer1 and
the product of cluster 358) by temporally secreted digestive proteases may play a role in the changes in the PM
thickness and structure.
Transcripts differentially expressed after blood feeding

In order to identify changes in expression of midgut
proteins induced by blood feeding, we compared the
abundance of transcripts in the sugar fed and the blood
fed libraries using chi-square statistical analysis. We
found several transcripts that were significantly more
abundant after blood feeding and several that were
underrepresented in the blood fed library (see tables 3
and 4). As expected, we observed some transcripts putatively involved in blood digestion and peritrophic matrix
formation more abundant after blood feeding. These
included the putative peritrophin with four chitin-binding domains, PperPer1. Similar to the putative orthologues in P. papatasi and L. longipalpis, PpPer1
[GenBank:EU031912] and LuloPer1 [GenBank:
EU124588], PperPer1 was only detected in the blood fed
midgut library. With regard to peritrophin sequence
abundance, it is interesting to note that we did not
detect any peritrophin sequence highly represented
before blood feeding. This is in contrast with the situation described in P. papatasi, where high numbers of a
putative peritrophin with one chitin binding domain,
PpPer2 [GenBank:EU047543], were detected in sugar fed
midguts. In this respect, the observed profile is more
similar to peritrophins in the midgut of a more distantly
related species L. longipalpis.
Transcripts coding for proteolytic enzymes, namely
the chymotrypsins PperChym1 and PperChym2 and the
trypsin PperTryp3, were also found more abundant in
the blood fed library and thus likely represent digestive

enzymes induced by the intake of blood. On the other
hand, three other putative proteases, PperTryp1, PperTryp2 and PperChym3 were significantly less abundant
in the blood fed library. We speculate that these molecules may be post-transcriptionally regulated digestive
enzymes that are stored in the midgut prior to blood
feeding.
The most striking differences in sequence abundance
before and after blood feeding were observed for the
microvillar proteins. Four of the five identified putative
microvillar proteins (PperMVP1, 2, 4 and 5) were only
detected in the blood fed library and in high abundance.
This indicates a strong up-regulation of these proteins
after the intake of blood. In contrast, PperMVP3 was
overrepresented in the sugar fed library, suggesting a
different role for this protein. The observed microvillar
proteins EST distributions are in accordance with what
was described in both P. papatasi and L. longipalpis,
where the PperMVP3 orthologues, LuloMVP3 and
PpMVP3 were highly represented before blood feeding
unlike all other microvillar proteins. The conservation of
these proteins and their pattern of expression in the
midgut of the three sand fly species indicate their
important, yet uncharacterized, roles in the midgut
physiology.
The list of sequences overabundant in the blood fed
library also includes a putative protein, cluster 79 [GenBank:HQ015441], similar to a putative cockroach allergen MPA2 and several uncharacterized mosquito
proteins. The presence of a lipid-binding ML domain in
the translated sequence of cluster 79 [Interpro:
IPR003172] may suggest a role of lipid recognition. In
accordance with their putative function in carbohydrate
digestion, putative glycoside hydrolases, cluster 174
[GenBank:HQ015444] and cluster 183 [GenBank:
HQ015443], were found overrepresented in the sugar
fed library. Interestingly, we also found a putative catalase sequence (PperCat) overabundant in the sugar fed
midgut. Similarly, the significance of the higher abundance of a putative 40S ribosomal protein SA (cluster

Conclusion
P. perniciosus is a medically important vector of canine
and human visceral leishmaniasis in the Old World. To
date, the only molecular data available for this species
have been the salivary gland transcripts [51]. This study
is the first report on molecules present in the midgut of
P. perniciosus. As development of Leishmania in the
vector sand fly is restricted to the digestive tract, the
midgut is the primary organ where interactions with
Leishmania take place. By sequencing and analyzing
transcripts present before and after blood feeding, we
have provided a catalogue of putative proteins potentially involved in feeding and blood digestion. All the
generated ESTs were deposited in the NCBI dbEST
database, making them available to scientific communities for further research. Selected molecules of interest
were manually annotated and the nucleotide and putative protein sequences submitted to GenBank.
We have identified a variety of molecules, including
putative proteins that have not been previously
described in the sand fly midgut. Among the putative
proteases, these include a putative astacin (PperAstacin2) and a putative chymotrypsin (PperChym5). We
also found molecules potentially involved in pathogen
recognition such as the gram-negative bacteria binding
protein (PperGNBP) and the putative peptidoglycan
receptor (PperPGRPLC). Novel putative antioxidant
enzymes were also identified including an intracellular
superoxide dismutase (PperSOD2) and putative microsomal and Theta class glutathione S-transferases
(PperGST2 and PperGST3). In addition, we describe
homologs of mosquito peritrophic matrix proteins.
Constructing libraries from sand fly females before
and after the intake of blood allowed for the identification of molecules differentially expressed in response to
blood feeding. By comparing our findings with the midgut transcriptome analyses of two other sand fly species,
L. longipalpis and P. papatasi, we identified several features shared by the two permissive vectors, P. perniciosus and L. longipalpis. These include the absence of a
significant number of peritrophin sequences before
blood feeding, while in P. papatasi, a peritrophin with
one chitin binding domain was abundant in sugar fed
midguts.
Altogether, this study contributes to our knowledge of
the molecular background of events that occur in the
sand fly midgut. It provides a valuable platform for
functional studies of selected molecules relevant in the
transmission of Leishmania. These may represent

targets for use as novel vector-based transmission-blocking vaccines to control this neglected disease.

Methods
Sand fly maintenance and dissection

The colony of Phlebotomus perniciosus (originally from
Spain) was maintained in the insectary of Charles University in Prague as described previously [52]. Adults
were kept at 26°C and fed on 50% sucrose ad libitum.
Ten midguts from 3-5 days old sugar fed only females
were dissected for the sugar fed library construction.
Females were fed on an anaesthetised Balb/C mouse
and two midguts containing blood were dissected at
each of the following time points: 4-6 h, 24 h, 2 days, 3
days and 4 days post-blood meal. These samples were
pooled for the construction of the blood fed library. For
the qPCR experiment, females were fed through a chick
skin on heat-inactivated rabbit blood containing L.
infantum infected macrophages (or uninfected macrophages in the control group). Midguts from ten infected
and ten uninfected (control) females were dissected 6 h,
24 h, 72 h and 10 days after blood feeding and stored
individually in 10 μl of RNAlater (Ambion) as well as 10
individual midguts from sand flies before blood feeding
(sugar fed). Presence of promastigotes in midguts was
confirmed 72 h after blood feeding. On day 10 after
blood feeding only sand flies with late-stage infections
(with parasites on the stomodeal valve) were used.
cDNA library construction and sequencing

Messenger RNA was purified from midguts stored in
RNAlater (Ambion) using the MicroFastTrack mRNA
isolation kit (Invitrogen). PCR-based cDNA libraries
were prepared following the instructions for the
SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech). Each
cDNA library was then fractionated into three sets containing small, medium and large fragments using columns provided by the manufacturer. Concentrated
cDNA was ligated into a lambda TriplEx2 vector (Clontech). The resulting ligation reaction was packed using
the Gigapack III Gold (Stratagene). The libraries thus
obtained were plated by infecting log-phase XL1-blue
cells (Clontech). Phage plaques lacking b-galactosidase
activity were picked using sterile wooden sticks and
placed into 75 μl of water. Amplification of the cDNA
was performed using Faststart Mix (Roche), 3 μl template and primers PT2F1 (5’-AAG TAC TCT AGC
AAT TGT GAG C-3’) and PT2R1 (5’-CTC TTC GCT
ATT ACG CCA GCT G-3’). The PCR conditions were
1 hold of 75°C for 3 min, 1 hold of 94°C for 4 min, 33
cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 49°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 7
min, 1 hold of 75°C for 7 min. The amplification product was cleaned with three washes with ultra pure
water using ExcelaPure plates (EdgeBio) resuspended in

Page 18 of 21

30 μl of water. Sequencing was performed at the Rocky
Mountain Laboratories Genomics Unit as described previously [53]. The template was combined with primer
PT2F3 (5’- TCT CGG GAA GCG CGC CAT TGT-3’)
in an ABI 96-well Optical Reaction Plate (P/N 4306737)
following the manufacturers recommendations. Sequencing reactions were setup as recommended by Applied
Biosystems BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing
Kit by adding 1 μL ABI BigDye Terminator Ready
Reaction Mix v3.1 (P/N 4336921), 1.5 μL 5× ABI
Sequencing Buffer (P/N 4336699), and 3.5 μL of water
for a final volume of 10 μL. Cycle sequencing was performed at 96°C for 10 s, 50°C for 5 s, 60°C for 4 min for
27 cycles on either a Bio-Rad Tetrad 2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) or ABI 9700 (Applied Biosystems,
Inc., Foster City, CA) thermal cycler. Fluorescently
labelled extension products were purified following
Applied Biosystems BigDye XTerminator Purification
protocol and then processed on an ABI 3730xL DNA
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA).
Bioinformatic analysis

The bioinformatic analyses of the sequences were performed using the dCAS 1.4 cDNA annotation software
[14]. Briefly, primer, vector and low quality sequences
were removed at the 5’ and 3’ ends of each sequence
using Cap3 and Phred software [54-56]. Sequences from
both libraries were grouped together and aligned to generate clusters based on 95% identity over 100 nucleotides. Three frame translated consensus sequences were
supplied to the appropriate BLAST algorithm [57] for
comparison to the contents of the NCBI non-redundant
protein database, the Gene Ontology database [58], the
KOG conserved domain database [59], Simple Modular
Architecture Tool (SMART) [60], Protein Family Database (Pfam) [61], rRNA subset database and Mitochondrial and Plasmid Sequences database (MIT-PLA)
available from NCBI. The predicted presence of a signal
secretion peptide or transmembrane domains was determined using the SignalP and TMHMM programs
respectively [62,63]. N- and O-glycosylation site prediction was performed for selected sequences using NetNGlyc 1.0 and NetOGlyc 3.1 software http://www.cbs.dtu.
dk/services/NetNGlyc/[64]. Numbers of sequences in
the sugar fed and the blood fed library were compared
using c2 statistical analysis. Clusters with significantly
unequal distribution of the clone sequences (P < 0.05
and expected frequency in each of the libraries > 4)
were identified as over- or underrepresented after blood
feeding. Selected sequences were aligned using Clustal ×
2.0 [65] and manually refined in BioEdit 7.0 sequenceediting software. For phylogenetic analyses of amino
acid sequences, best substitution matrix was determined
for each alignment by ProtTest software, version 2.0

[66]. This matrix was then used by TREE-PUZZLE 5.2
[67] to reconstruct maximum likelihood phylogenetic
trees from the protein alignments using quartet puzzling
with 1000 puzzling steps. Resulting trees were visualized
in MEGA 4 [68].
Macrophage infection

Leishmania infantum (MCAN/PT/05/IMT 373) parasites were cultured at 23°C in RPMI medium (Sigma)
containing 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS,
Gibco), 50 ug/ml gentamicin, 1× BME vitamins (Sigma)
and 1% human urine. Mouse macrophage line J774 was
cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in RPMI medium containing
10% FCS, 2 mM alanyl-glutamine and penicillin (200
IU/ml). Macrophages were infected with stationaryphase L. infantum parasites at 1:10 macrophage:parasite
ratio. After 24 h of co-cultivation at 37°C, 5% CO2, noninternalized parasites were removed by washing 3× in
the culture media and infected macrophages cultivated
overnight. Macrophages were confirmed to contain
amastigotes by light microscopy of Giemsa-stained
slides. The infected macrophage culture was scraped
from the culture plates, centrifuged at 380 g for 10 minutes and resuspended in heat-inactivated rabbit blood
for sand fly infections at the concentration of 3 × 106
macrophages/ml.
Quantitative PCR

RNA was purified from individual midguts stored in
-20°C using a High Pure RNA Tissue Kit (Roche) and
cDNA synthesized using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers
(Promega) following manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification of putative trypsin transcripts was performed
by real-time PCR with primers designed for PperTryp1
(5’-CCC AAT GGA CTA TGA CTA CGC-3’ and 5’CGA ACA TCG TCG AAT ACG ATA G-3’), PperTryp2 (5’-GGT GTT CTC GTT GGA GTG GT-3’ and
5’-TGG CGT AAA CTC CAG GGT AG-3’), PperTryp3
(5’-TGA GGA TGT TGA GGA TGG AA-3’ and 5’CTC TTG GTT ATT CAG AGT GTT ACC C-3’) and
PperS7 ribosomal protein as a reference transcript (5’ATC CCT ATG CCG AAG CAG A-3’ and 5’-TCA
AGC TCA CGT ACC AGA CG-3’). The amplification
reaction was carried out using the iQ5 real-time PCR
detection system (Bio-Rad) by using the SYBR Green
detection method (iQ SYBR Green Supermix, Bio-Rad)
in 15 μl reaction volume containing 1 μl cDNA template
and 0.5 μl primer set (5 uM each). The running conditions were as follows: 3 min at 95°C followed by 40
repetitive cycles: 10 s at 95°C, 10 s at 55°C, and 10 s at
72°C. Reactions were run in duplicates and data were
analysed using the 2-ΔΔCT (Livak) method. In a preliminary experiment we have established that the target genes

(trypsins) and the reference gene (PperS7 ribosomal protein) have similar (about 5% variance) amplification efficiencies which are nearly 100%. Data are presented as
relative transcript levels using the S7 ribosomal protein
gene as an internal control. Statistical analysis was done
by Mann-Whitney U Test using (Statistica 6.1 StatSoft
software).
