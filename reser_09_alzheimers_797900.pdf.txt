Abstract
The present article examines several lines of converging evidence suggesting that the slow and
insidious brain changes that accumulate over the lifespan, resulting in both natural cognitive aging
and Alzheimer's disease (AD), represent a metabolism reduction program. A number of such
adaptive programs are known to accompany aging and are thought to have decreased energy
requirements for ancestral hunter-gatherers in their 30s, 40s and 50s. Foraging ability in modern
hunter-gatherers declines rapidly, more than a decade before the average terminal age of 55 years.
Given this, the human brain would have been a tremendous metabolic liability that must have been
advantageously tempered by the early cellular and molecular changes of AD which begin to
accumulate in all humans during early adulthood. Before the recent lengthening of life span,
individuals in the ancestral environment died well before this metabolism reduction program
resulted in clinical AD, thus there was never any selective pressure to keep adaptive changes from
progressing to a maladaptive extent.
Aging foragers may not have needed the same cognitive capacities as their younger counterparts
because of the benefits of accumulated learning and life experience. It is known that during both
childhood and adulthood metabolic rate in the brain decreases linearly with age. This trend is
thought to reflect the fact that children have more to learn. AD "pathology" may be a natural
continuation of this trend. It is characterized by decreasing cerebral metabolism, selective
elimination of synapses and reliance on accumulating knowledge (especially implicit and procedural)
over raw brain power (working memory). Over decades of subsistence, the behaviors of aging
foragers became routinized, their motor movements automated and their expertise ingrained to a
point where they no longer necessitated the first-rate working memory they possessed when
younger and learning actively. Alzheimer changes selectively and precisely mediate an adaptation to
this major life-history transition.
AD symptomatology shares close similarities with deprivation syndromes in other animals including
the starvation response. Both molecular and anatomical features of AD imitate brain changes that
have been conceptualized as adaptive responses to low food availability in mammals and birds.
Alzheimer's patients are known to express low overall metabolic rates and are genetically inclined
to exhibit physiologically thrifty traits widely thought to allow mammals to subsist under conditions
of nutritional scarcity. Additionally, AD is examined here in the contexts of anthropology,
comparative neuroscience, evolutionary medicine, expertise, gerontology, neural Darwinism,
neuroecology and the thrifty genotype.

Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system disorder that gradually increases in severity with age resulting
in memory loss, behavioral changes and a decline in
thinking abilities. Connections between individual neurons are destroyed in the AD brain due to the formation
of neurofibrillary tangles (i.e., tangled strands of neural
fibers within the bodies of neurons) and senile plaques
(i.e., masses of dying neural material containing toxic protein called beta-amyloid) which obstruct, damage and
lead to the eventual death of many neural cells [1]. The
most pronounced features of the AD state are thought to
be decreased cerebral blood flow and decreased cerebral
metabolism [2,3] due to the fact that dead neurons do not
require oxygen or glucose [4]. The tangles and plaques
responsible for this accumulate in all adults advancing in
age, but do so at an accelerated rate in those that will
develop AD [4]. All humans begin to develop the neurological markers of AD during their early 20s and continue
to do so throughout life, most towards clinically irrelevant
degrees [5]. But why would these markers present in everyone? How could natural selection have allowed them to
become so invasive and ubiquitous if they did not hold
some sort of evolutionary significance?
Humans are not the only species that develop plaques and
tangles and are also not the only species whose behavior
can be affected by them [6]. AD-like neuropathology is
known to occur in the species of several mammalian
orders, including many species of primates, but has the
potential to become more severe in neuropathological
presentation and in the degree of functional impairment
in humans [7]. The wide phylogenetic spread suggests that
it responds to some selective pressure. Furthermore, the
fact that a wide variety of mammals exhibit AD-like neuropathology suggests that the first mutations responsible
for it may have arisen tens of millions of years ago. It will
not be easy to determine exactly when or how the genes
responsible for AD evolved; however, the present article
will focus on exploring why. Framing AD as part of a strategy to save calories during the later stages of life may
explain many facets of the disease, such as (1) why it
shares many similarities with known responses to starvation, (2) why it resembles a neuroecological change, (3)
why it selectively affects specific neuroanatomical areas
and not others, (4) why it presents comorbidly with the
metabolic syndrome, (5) why it has been tied genographically with the thrifty genotype, and (6) why such a psychiatrically conspicuous syndrome was not eradicated by
natural selection.

Presentation of the hypothesis
It is thought that analyzing disease states from an evolutionary perspective can ultimately do much to inform and
influence medical intervention strategies [8]. The present

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/5/1/13

article will employ this approach with Alzheimer's disease
(AD) emphasizing that, because susceptibility genes for
AD are so prevalent in human populations, the traits that
characterize preclinical (or presymptomatic) AD must
have been naturally selected. Because the average life span
of contemporary human hunter-gatherers is around 55
[9,10], it is thought that prehistoric man would have lived
nearly as long. Given that clinical AD is only rarely diagnosed before age 55 [11], it is clear that individuals would
rarely have lived long enough to develop AD in our evolutionary past. Natural selection then, could only have acted
on the preclinical or prodromal AD phenotype and, as in
other disorders of aging [7], would not have had the
opportunity to curtail the detrimental effects, which of
course appear late in life.
Some theorists assume tacitly that AD presents too late in
reproductive life to have been exposed to negative selection [12]. They realize that diseases that arise after individuals become infertile cannot limit the total number of
offspring produced, and that evolution has little way of
excising such diseases. However, many facts about preclinical AD indicate that the genes responsible for it must
have been exposed to blatant selective pressure, well
before their bearers reached reproductive senescence. Particularly, neuropathological changes begin in the early 20s
and usually constitute a "heavy load" 10–20 years before
the first behavioral symptoms of marked cognitive decline
surface [13]. Several forms of neurophysiological and
intellectual decline have been shown to begin in the first
few decades in individuals that will develop AD [14]. In
fact, well controlled studies have shown that individuals
that carry susceptibility genes for AD exhibit lower levels
of intellectual functioning throughout life and are more
likely to drop out of high school by age 15 when compared to their matched peers [15]. In other words, because
the genes that cause AD create conspicuous neurological
and behavioral characteristics that present during reproductive age, they could not have been invisible to evolutionary forces.
Additionally, some evolutionary theorists find it hard to
imagine that AD could have been adaptive because of low
ability for autonomy and self-sufficiency seen in AD
patients. Despite some impairment, individuals with preclinical AD are regularly capable of both domestic autonomy and professional achievement [5]. Importantly, AD
usually only creates conspicuously maladaptive behavior
in people that live far past the average terminal age, which
is around 55, in foraging societies [16]. Moreover, medical
advances in the last few centuries have artificially
extended life by several decades, and most experts believe
that this has given AD neuropathology the time necessary
to develop to an injurious extent that would have been
impossible in prehistoric times [17]. In other words, AD

in its advanced, debilitating form may simply be the
unnatural progression of natural brain aging changes,
which would have rarely occurred in shorter-lived, ancestral populations.
It is important to emphasize that, on a cellular level, all of
the changes seen in Alzheimer's disease are also found in
normal aging adults [18]. The neurofibrillary tangles [19],
senile plaques [16] and neurotransmitter changes [20] are
each present in aged-matched normals, with the same
regional preferences, but simply to a lesser extent [11]. It
has been estimated that even those elderly individuals
that show the least cognitive impairment in old age would
eventually be diagnosed with AD if they were able to live
to around 130 [21]. The genes responsible for this "inevitable transformation" exist in every one. This frames ADlike neuropathology as a continuous, polymorphic cognitive strategy, where clinical AD represents the extreme side
of a continuum. Other researchers have also concluded
that AD is not a qualitatively distinct, abnormal entity, but
is instead at one extreme end of a spectrum of capability
in old age within which a great deal of natural variation
exists [22]. Like many other polygenic, continuous traits
the mutations responsible for pronounced AD were likely
maintained by balancing selection (specifically, environmental heterogeneity). In other words, they were kept in
our gene pool because, as environmental resource conditions fluctuated, different genetic polymorphisms, or
"multiple alternate alleles" were favored.
Today, the costs of AD are well-documented [23], but the
defensive manifestations may be hidden because of discrepancies between our modern and ancestral environments. Many traits that are clearly maladaptive in the
present are now thought to have been adaptive in the
ancestral environment [24] and this situation is known as
an "environmental mismatch." The science of evolutionary medicine attempts to identify, analyze and explicate
these traits [25]. Researchers have identified many "pathological" conditions such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, and obesity,
and have helped to show that despite the stigma today,
genetic susceptibility to these diseases would have conferred adaptive benefits in prehistoric times [8]. Williams
and Nesse [26] suggest that certain criteria must be met to
conclude that a "disease" may have been adaptive in the
past: it should be relatively prevalent, heritable, and susceptibility should vary within the population. AD certainly meets the first three criteria [18], but now it is
important to show that the fourth criterion can be satisfied – that the benefits associated with the condition must
have outweighed the costs.
A handful of articles have attempted to explain the existence of AD in terms of antagonistic pleiotropy [12,17],

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/5/1/13

however, AD and the underlying neuropathology have
not been analyzed in terms of evolutionary medicine and
have not been firmly reconciled with evolutionary theory.
Perhaps it can be argued that AD is utterly pathological,
has no advantageous qualities and no natural history. This
article will espouse an opposite view and explore the
assertion that AD has been naturally selected and represents a preservative ecological strategy. Many articles in
the last few decades have analyzed various forms of psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression,
obsessive compulsive disorder) in terms of evolutionary
theory and evolutionary medicine [27,28]. This burgeoning area of research is often referred to as "evolutionary
psychopathology." The present author has written articles
analyzing various forms of neuropathology using this
approach and has called this area "evolutionary neuropathology [29-31]". Using this framework, the present article is prepared to explore many congregating sources of
evidence that strongly suggest that AD is highly explicable
under evolutionary theory.
Neural Darwinism, skill and specialization
Clearly, prehistoric foragers with preclinical AD would
not have the same cognitive capacity to learn from their
environment that they had when they were younger. It is
probable; however, that they would no longer need this
capacity. For reasons to be explored in this section, the
cognitive symptoms of preclinical AD may have complemented the aging process on the ancestral, African savannah.

A conspicuous trend has been documented for decades in
the study of neuron number: many animals overproduce
neurons in their youth and then, later in life, lose the
unused, inefficient ones [32]. This kind of neuron loss is
known to be controlled by programmed cell death, or
apoptosis, which is also a major contributing factor to the
neuropathology in AD [33]. One function of neuron
death in aging animals is to remove neurons that have not
made useful or sufficiently numerous connections [3437]. For example, in mammalian populations, neural
degeneration in segments that control necessary functions
such as limb movement is very rare [38]. It is more common, however, in less behaviorally critical neural tracts. A
young mammal's cortex is full of neural tracts that may
never be critical, but it is not clear which will be needed
and which will not until the animal has acquired life experience [39]. Several researchers have associated this process of "economization by elimination" with strong
positive increases in reproductive fitness [39-42]. A good
deal of ethological evidence supports the idea that as animals of many different phyla mature and age, intensive
learning may become less important with time [43]. In
fact, one major neurodevelopmental trend seen throughout the human lifespan is a compelling example of this.

The metabolic rate found in the brains of children is far
higher than in those of young adults, which are, in turn,
far higher than in those of middle-aged adults [44].
In the first decade of human life, the cerebral cortex
undergoes dramatic fluctuations in energy consumption.
The metabolic rate of the brain increases rapidly from
birth and begins to reach adult levels by age two. From
four years of age until nine, the amount of energy spent in
a child's brain far exceeds that of an adult [45]. During this
period, the brain's neural architecture is characterized by
"hyperconnectivity," where neurons of the cortex have
formed many more connections (synapses) than will be
kept. Many of these will be selectively eliminated [46]. At
ten years of age, the brain's metabolic rate begins to
decline until the late teens, at which point the levels of
glucose utilization have reached adult values. This pattern
of metabolic decline persists naturally, in everyone, until
death [45]. Throughout the lifespan, neurons and synapses that are not used are "pruned," limiting behavioral
plasticity and constraining what can be learned in the
future [47]. Only the connections that are utilized are
maintained, and this inevitable process is responsible for
the dramatic windows for learning (e.g., second languages
and musical instruments) that close soon after adolescence [46].
The sharp diminishment in cerebral metabolism in young
adulthood is currently conceptualized in the literature as
an evolutionarily mediated response to changes in lifehistory dynamics [46], but modern AD researchers appear
surprised that further reductions occur with advancing
age. These reductions, even in late life, should be seen as
part of a natural process of continuing development.
Young children are small and their metabolic demands
are met by their parents, yet they need to learn rapidly in
order to become ecologically competent [48]. They can
afford a high cerebral metabolism because they benefit so
greatly from the incessant thinking and learning that
accompanies it. Once the individual becomes an adult
though, they need not expend quite so much energy
actively learning and analyzing. The adaptive value of
extracting large amounts of information from their environment and carrying it with them through time has
decreased. This is because, in adulthood, individuals
should have already internalized much of the cultural and
ecological information that they will need.
As aging progresses, it is still necessary to be able to learn
new mental maps, new language skills and new techniques. However, because so much of what is learnable is
already known, the usefulness of this capacity must continue to diminish with increasing age. If an animal is able
to survive to reach full adulthood, then the functional
conceptualizations that it made during development have

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/5/1/13

been working and the animal must have internalized
information in a way that is conducive to survival. In this
case it should not be necessary to radically change a mental set that has proven to be effective. The profound neuron loss with age to the nucleus basalis [49], the gateway
module for new learning in the brain, may help to ensure
that a mature organism cannot reprogram its tried and
true behaviors with new, untested learning. It is accepted
that elaborate, new memories have a tendency to interfere
with old ones in both laboratory and ecological contexts
[50].
"Academic learning is often explicit: professors point out the
things to be learned, and students try their best to memorize
them. But most ordinary human learning is probably implicit.
A hunter may teach young people how to track an animal, or
how to kill and skin it. Most of the time such practical activities
can be taught more easily by modeling than by explicit labeling.
Many of the subtleties of hunting and gathering may not even
have names"
-Moscovitch et al., 2007 [51]
As the quote above explains, in ancient times, a huntergatherer's cognitive resources were probably used (much
more than they are in modern times) to analyze, refine
and coordinate muscle activity. It is an interesting observation that most AD patients can walk, gesticulate, inflect,
intonate, gesture, and move perfectly fine. This is due to
the fact that their procedural memory, the ability to learn
and implement behavioral skills at an automatic, unconscious level, remains very much intact [52]. Interestingly,
the structures responsible for procedural memory, the
striatum, putamen and caudate nucleus largely escape
neuropathological load in old age [53]. As such, patients
with AD can exhibit severe episodic, semantic and working memory deficits, but because of preserved procedural
memory, are usually able-bodied and retain many of the
habits, skills and implicit memories that they have honed
during their lifetime [5]. In fact, most individuals with AD
who were athletes can continue to perform admirably,
usually only impaired by physical aging (e.g. muscle tone
and cardiovascular endurance) but not mental aging [54].
If reflexes, motor praxes and coordination of movement
are generally proficient in individuals with pronounced
AD in their 90s, then surely they would have been adequate in our ancient, preclinical ancestors in their 30s, 40s
and 50s.
The changes during cognitive aging tend to preserve crystallized intelligence (i.e., the ability to use known information to instruct behavior), over fluid intelligence (i.e.,
the ability to use new information to instruct behavior)
[55]. Moreover, it has been shown that even though general IQ score remains somewhat stable, crystallized intel-

Behavioral and Brain Functions 2009, 5:13

ligence grows rapidly and fluid intelligence declines
rapidly between 15 and 60 years of age [56]. The increases
in crystallized intelligence are thought to correspond with
increased number of life experiences, and the decreases in
fluid intelligence are thought to correspond with decreasing metabolic output of the brain with age. For these reasons an aging individual may be less likely to benefit from
constant learning and concerted analysis and more likely
to benefit from being vigilant for those stimuli that elicit
known behavior patterns. It seems clear that the accretion
of crystallized intelligence (knowledge) makes it so that
fluid intelligence (deliberation) is less necessary. After all,
it is far less costly to inform behavior using neural connections that have already been made than to go through the
trouble of creating new connections. As Matt Ridley [57]
states,
"Experience causes the unnecessary connections to wither away
and thereby turns the brain from a general to a specific device.
Like a sculptor chipping away at a block of marble to find the
human form within, so the environment strips away the surplus
neurons to sharpen the skills of the brain."
Brain development happens throughout life and is characterized from even a very early stage by two complementary
processes, selection and instruction [58]. Both processes
underlie learning and memory and are fundamental to
cognition as we know it [59]. In selection, the synapses
and neurons that are utilized most frequently are
"selected" to be preserved, and those that are not used
degenerate [60]. This process of neural selection, also
called "neural Darwinism," is thought to be nearly as
important as "instruction," which stands for the family of
cellular and molecular processes that accomplish longterm potentiation [57]. The main difference between
selection and instruction is that the latter necessitates biological resources. Preclinical AD can be viewed as a strategy that relies heavily on selection rather than on
instruction – emphasizing a cheap and metabolically
thrifty way to program behavior. The importance of metabolic thrift during human aging is what we turn to in the
next section.
Advancing age and the threat of starvation
Data from physical anthropology have shown that, in all
foraging groups studied, elderly hunter-gatherers implement low-yield foraging strategies and procure food
(measured in calories) at a rate that is far below that of
younger foragers [61]. These aging individuals have more
difficulty procuring foodstuffs than their younger counterparts do because, due to natural senescence, they can no
longer meet the associated physical and athletic demands
[62]. Unlike any other species, however, human foragers
engage in food sharing, which allows the elderly individuals to live longer than they would be able to if they were

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/5/1/13

forced to meet 100 percent of their own metabolic
demands [62]. Traditionally, the older individuals in foraging groups seek out food on their own, but also rely
heavily on younger individuals to supplement their diet
[61]. This is an imprudent strategy because, during times
of hardship when food was scarce, they would most certainly be threatened by starvation. We know that the Pleistocene era (roughly 2 million to 12 thousand years ago)
was marked by frequent, prolonged, dry spells [63] and
consequent widespread nutritional scarcity that continually threatened our ancestors [64]. It is clear that the
demographic most susceptible to starvation during tough
times, the aged, would have benefited the most from metabolic penny-pinching.
Food production, in total calories attained, in male
hunter-gatherers increases dramatically every year
between the ages of 16 and 25; this reflects the long learning curve for hunting ability [65]. The ratio of production
to consumption (i.e., catching versus eating) hits the maximum at 25. At this point the individual is able to procure
more food than it eats, and it shares the leftovers. This
state of self-sufficiency plateaus and remains stable as late
as age 45, after which time it drops precipitously for many
years until death [61]. Food production ability eventually
drops below food consumption resulting in insufficiency.
This race for calories against the clock- a very foreign concept today even in developing nations- explains why aging
humans desperately needed to conserve energy resources.
In contrast, chimpanzee subsistence during aging is very
different. Indeed, chimpanzees live their entire lives without food production ever dropping below consumption
[61]. Because young chimpanzees don't share food with
the older ones, old chimps, like most other wild animals
in general, starve to death relatively soon after their food
production ability begins to decline [66]. Human huntergatherers on the other hand exhibit a pronounced drop in
food consumption – allowed of course by a diminishment of metabolic rate – that helps them to survive the
drop in production [62].
Because elderly foragers cannot gather enough calories to
meet the energy requirements of a younger forager, we can
infer that they would have benefited from particular metabolic alterations that helped them cut down on energy
expenditure. Fittingly, decades worth of gerontological
research shows that elderly humans exhibit lower resting
metabolic rates and that they accomplish this by downregulating a number of physiological systems resulting in
lower muscle mass, lower thyroid levels, lower growth
hormone levels, lower testosterone levels and insulin
resistance [67,68]. These physiological changes that occur
with age suggest that natural selection is responsible for
selecting our species for "advanced-age thrift," allowing
elderly individuals to survive on smaller amounts of food

Behavioral and Brain Functions 2009, 5:13

[67]. Again, each of these thrifty metabolic changes that
occur with age can be interpreted as pathological in the
present yet adaptive in the past, and clearly represent a
type of "senile plasticity" that permitted metabolic frugality [69]. This plasticity towards energy conservation
presents so dependably in various tissues and organs that
we might expect it to generalize to the brain as well.

Testing the hypothesis
Neuroecology and Alzheimer's
A growing body of literature has shown that neural tissue
is highly metabolically expensive and that species with
large brains have been forced to negotiate tradeoffs leading to compensatory adaptations in various organ systems
[70]. Considering that humans spend 20–25 percent of
their total resting energy budget in their brains alone –
most primates spend between 8–9 percent [71] – it is clear
that, as highly encephalized primates, humans must have
been forced to make many inventive compromises [72].
This line of reasoning makes it seem sensible that any
excusable opportunity to attenuate the number of calories
consumed by the brain would increase an individual's
chances of surviving periods of prolonged scarcity.

The emerging discipline of neuroecology has amassed a
great deal of data (on an assortment of species, avian and
mammalian) that demonstrate that, because the brain is
very costly to maintain, specific brain regions can respond
plastically to the environment, lowering energy consumption in response to deprivation and adversity [73]. It has
been shown that many species have this adaptive ability
to attenuate energy metabolism in the neocortex and hippocampus [74]. The animals have been naturally selected
to accomplish this despite the fact that, due to the associated cognitive disadvantage, they are forced to employ less
cognitively rigorous and lower yielding foraging strategies
[75,76]. In fact, studies have shown that the hippocampus
can adaptively vary both metabolic rate and volume with
ecological rigor [73,76]. Birds and mammals have been
shown to decrease energy expenditure in the hippocampus in response to environmental deprivation [77], season of low food availability, and decreased need to forage
[76]. These findings have been interpreted widely and
emphatically as examples of protective changes that can
significantly increase the animal's ability to survive periods of nutritional scarcity [73]. Fascinatingly, the hippocampus is known to show, by far, the most severe
decrement in metabolism when compared with other
brain regions in AD [78-80].
Hippocampal atrophy and glucose hypometabolism in
the neocortex are the two most well documented findings
in AD [81], even in the early stages [82]. In fact, the postmortem diagnosis of AD concentrates primarily on the
extent of neurodegeneration in the fronal cortex and hip-

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/5/1/13

pocampus [83]. The fact that the hippocampus and the
neocortex are the most affected areas in both the naturally
aging brain and the AD brain [84] further suggests that the
"neuropathology" represents an adaptive neuroecological
change. This seems especially likely given that old age is
strongly associated with a diminished foraging capacity in
human hunter-gatherers [62]. The dentate gyrus is a subregion of the hippocampus that is highly ecologically significant in that it is the main area in the brain that
generates new neurons throughout life. It is also the area
of the hippocampus that is most damaged in normal
aging and AD [5]. Perhaps there are unexplored ecological
implications here! Furthermore, the hippocampus and
the neocortex are known to have exhibited highly accelerated growth during human evolution [49] and thus the
age-associated atrophy they exhibit in AD may signify that
aging individuals can benefit from shifting towards more
rudimentary, less cognitively rigorous, food extraction
methods reminiscent of those used by our evolutionary
predecessors.
The neuroecological literature informs us that hippocampal hypometabolism in animals invariably results in an
alternate, less rigorous, ecological strategy and, like AD, is
often accompanied by other physiological modes of
energy conservation [74]. Overall cerebral metabolism in
AD patients is much lower than in age-matched normal
subjects [3], and the degree of severity of AD has been
shown to be positively correlated with decreases in cerebral metabolism [2]. All of these facts are consistent with
our characterization of AD "neuropathology" as a subtle
but progressive neuroecological program that has been
engineered by natural selection.
The selectivity of neuropathological changes in
Alzheimer's
It is known that neurodegeneration in AD is not at all uniformly distributed in the brain. Specific neuroanatomical
structures are targeted by the disease relative to others
[85], and if AD pathology represents a form of plasticity
that was adaptive in our evolutionary past, we should
expect to find evolutionary significance in the distinctively
patterned distribution. The findings reported here are
consistent with the idea that AD selectively diminishes the
metabolic costs of neural areas that might prove extraneous to a deprived forager while sparing the essential areas.

AD pathology is most damaging to areas responsible for
higher-order learning and explicit memory but spares
areas essential for sensing and moving. For example,
plaques and tangles are known to be much more prevalent within the anterior (learning) but not the posterior
(sensory) cortex [85]. Scanning studies demonstrate
reduced glucose utilization in the frontal, parietal and
temporal association cortices of patients with Alzheimer's

Behavioral and Brain Functions 2009, 5:13

disease, when compared with age matched controls,
whereas the primary sensory, motor and visual regions are
preserved [49]. In fact, the sensorimotor and visual cortex
have been shown to suffer the least damage of any cortical
structures [86] and their selective preservation has been
described as "perplexing." The sensorimotor and visual
regions are areas that, if damaged, would certainly disrupt
the abilities to see and move. In other words, within the
cortex, Alzheimer's follows a genetic program which selectively spares the areas associated with the senses and muscle movement – regions that any foraging animal would
find indispensable. It primarily affects the higher areas
that are associated with lofty but expendable, abstract
thought.
Within each of the major cortical structures, the higherorder "association cortices" are the most vulnerable to
plaque and tangle formation whereas the adjacent primary sensory areas are the least vulnerable [87]. The association areas are responsible for functions that one can
imagine might be superfluous to a weathered forager that
has already "seen it all" such as mental comparison, conceptual integration and analytical thought [58]. The primary sensory areas though, which are highly conserved,
allow basic perception and stereotyped response to stimuli [87]- functions indispensable for any animal. Genes
that promote damage to such vital areas would be so damaging to reproductive fitness that we can see why they
would not be maintained and why they would not exist
today. Genes that promote damage to less vital, "metacognitive" areas would be more likely to persist, especially
given that these areas are responsible for abstract learning
[58]- which is, of course, very important to a youngster,
but less important to the experienced aged. It is also interesting to mention that, phylogenetically, association cortices expand at a faster rate than primary sensory cortices
[88], indicating that, in cortical function, the AD brain
operates like an evolved throwback rather than in some
arbitrary fashion.
The cortex, which is proportionally very large in humans
and tiny in the simplest vertebrates, is the area of the brain
that is damaged the most by AD [86]. The noncortical
areas responsible for respiratory and cardiac function,
waking state, emotionality, sensory perception and motor
capacity are relatively spared by AD; the damage that does
occur only begins to compromise these functions in very
late, advanced AD. All noncortical areas display proportionately far less damage than the frontal cortex and hippocampus [81]. These two, phylogenetically new, areas
are thought to have allowed humans the patience and
analytical ability to learn cognitively demanding food
extraction techniques and social conventions [89,90].
Interestingly, the noncortical brain regions that do exhibit
neuropathology are primarily regions that have under-

gone very recent "integrated phylogeny" (i.e., extensive
elaboration with association neocortices since our divergence with the other apes) [49]. These areas include the
posterior hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, the basocortical amygdaloid complex and the nucleus basalis of
Meynert. The fact that these findings reveal reverse-integrated phylogeny has influenced authors to posit that
Alzheimer's is, neurologically, a phylogenetic disease
[49]. This characterization fits neatly with the present
hypotheses and further frames AD not as arbitrarily localized pathology, but as an atavistic cerebrotype that recapitulates a fundamental, ancestral configuration.
The relative deficiencies of the preclinical AD brain may
be seen as mimicking the mental faculties of a lower primate. The facets of cognition that are struck the hardest by
AD include: sustained attention, prolonged concentration, inhibition of impulse and higher order capacities for
deliberation, prudence and forethought. Apes are generally seen as being less deliberate, prudent and inhibited,
and as having less capable working memory [91]. These
"relative deficits" do not detract from the fact that apes are
exquisitely crafted, able-bodied animals whose minds are
maximized for their ecological niche. The main way that
the ape brain is different from our own is in size of the cortex, and thus their limbic (emotional) system is proportionately large [88]. Consistent with all of this, it has been
found that the cortical areas that are the least vulnerable
to AD are the ones with the smallest connectional "distance" (measured in synapses removed) from the limbic
areas [87]. Interestingly, this same pattern is also true of
normal brain aging, indicating that all of us are designed
to make very precise, very deliberate neurological changes
with age. Relative selectivity in the AD brain should be
taken as a record of our behavioral past, where distribution of neuropathology evinces relative adaptive value of
individual processing modules and, thus, also of individual cognitive processes.
Several experiments using a variety of complex tasks have
shown that the level of metabolic activity in the cortex
drops with practice, familiarity and increasing automaticity [58]. Many different tasks that require concentration,
executive activity and recruitment of various brain areas
when the task is new can be automated with experience to
a point where the task can be completed efficiently with
only a minimal expenditure of metabolic activity [92].
Many tasks, even ones that seem relatively complex and
unpredictable, such as playing the videogame Tetris, show
this effect [93]. One might imagine that the tasks associated with foraging could easily become automated in the
same way and that the drop in cortical metabolic activity
with age represents a cunning move on the part of natural
selection. Because the metabolic requirements for the
completion of familiar tasks decreases with age and expe-

rience, aging individuals can afford to lower overall cerebral metabolic output and still maintain their
fundamental behaviors and their ability to interact
adeptly within their environment.
Comparative physiology and Alzheimer's
Definitive proof of the adaptive value of a physiological
phenomenon can be very hard to attain, but the comparative approach is thought to provide strong evidence [94].
This approach commonly compares the same physiological process in (1) closely related species that live in strikingly different environments, or (2) distantly related
species that live in identical environments. If the process
is associated with adaptation to environment, it is
expected that group 1 will show large variation in the trait
and group 2 will show little. First we will employ
approach number one and examine the large natural variation in susceptibility to AD within our species.

Two human groups that differ tremendously in way of life
and natural environment from other humans are the Khoi
San hunter-gatherers and the pygmy foragers of sub-Saharan Africa. The APOE 4 allele (currently the gene most
strongly associated with AD susceptibility) has been
shown to be more than twice as common in Khoi San
(.37) [95] and pygmies (.40) [96] as it is in other populations, where it is usually less than 20 percent and often
less than 12 percent. Why might this be so? These individuals represent human groups that, because they never utilized agriculture, have been exposed to nutritional
shortages up until recent times [97]. They live and forage
in much the same way that their ancestors must have for
tens of thousands of years. The fact that the APOE 4 gene
is so frequent among these groups suggests that there is a
strong relationship between way of life, nutritional scarcity and selective pressure on AD.
Modern molecular studies have shown that the Khoi San
are more distantly related to the rest of humanity than any
other group, meaning that they may have changed the
least since we all diverged from a single, ancestral "stem"
group around 180,000 years ago [98]. This suggests that
the ancient foraging ancestors to us all may have manifested preclinical AD to a larger degree than the modern
human population at large. Today, the incidence of APOE
4 remains highest among all populations where an economy of foraging still exists (e.g., Pygmies, Khoi San, aborigines of Malaysia and Australia, Papuans, European
Lapps, and some Native Americans), or the food supply is
known to have been frequently scarce, or nutritionally
poor [97]. This data shows that AD does in fact show high
variation between closely related but ecologically disparate groups. In the next section of this article we will consider the observation that known "thrifty" genes,
associated with adaptive energy conservation, show this

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/5/1/13

same geographical pattern, strengthening the association
between AD and metabolic thriftiness.
Now we will consider the second comparative approach;
a commonality in two distantly related species, rats and
humans. Animals that have been subjected to starvation
or nutritional deprivation exhibit multiple physiological
methods of energy conservation [99]. These changes
involve lowering the energy demands of the most expensive organs. Interestingly, some of these changes are
known to occur in the brain, and some appear highly
analogous to the changes seen in AD. One of the neurohistological hallmarks of AD, hyperphosphorylated tau
proteins, form reversibly in the brains of starving or
stressed rats. After a number of hours of food restriction,
hyperphosphorylated tau begins to accumulate within
neurons of the rat hippocampus [100]. This abnormal
tau, a transport protein, is one of the primary pathohistologicall hallmarks of AD, and is the cause of neurofibrillary tangles in humans [101]. Kurt Heininger [102] has
concluded that these molecular similarities shared
between AD and starving mammals suggests that AD constitutes a "rescue program" that "actively adapts to progressive fuel deprivation."
In rats, the accumulation of these proteins causes pronounced decrements in brain metabolism allowing the rat
more time to seek out food before it collapses from starvation. This phenomenon, which has been replicated reliably, has been explicitly attributed adaptive significance
[103]. Interestingly, after the rat is fed again, the tau
dephosphorylates and the hippocampus regains normal
function [100]. This reversible, phenotypic change in rats
is analogous to the permanent change seen in AD because
both may protect against starvation. Before these changes
were observed in starving lab animals, they were thought
to be specific and exclusive to AD. Ironically, the literature
today views these changes as adaptive alterations to starvation in lab rodents [103,104] but as pathological in AD.
Mammals are well-known to demonstrate a suite of plastic responses to extreme hunger and starvation that help
to minimize energy expenditure. The most dramatic of
these includes suppression of metabolic rate, reduction of
thyroid hormone levels and growth hormone levels, suppression of gonadal function, and an increased activation
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [99,105]. As
discussed in the next section, aging individuals and especially individuals with AD exhibit increased incidence of
each of these physiological alterations [68,106]. Ostensibly aging humans in the environment of evolutionary
adaptedness would have benefited from the same physiological alterations as starving animals. This further characterizes AD neuropathology as a response to nutritional
scarcity.

Many species of mammals, most notably primates, have
been shown to develop the neuropathological hallmarks
(both senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) of AD
[7,107] It has been hard for specialists to link changes in
these animals' behavior to the underlying pathology
because they are wild. However, our domesticated cats
and dogs, whose lives have also been artificially extended
in the last few centuries, also exhibit Alzheimer's like neuropathology. Cats, dogs and some other mammalian pets
diagnosed with cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS),
which is thought to be highly comparable behaviorally to
Alzheimer's in humans [108], have been shown to have
specific molecular and cellular changes that mimic the
pathophysiology of AD [109]. In fact, the behavioral
abnormalities of CDS in cats and dogs are accompanied
by the same hallmarks of AD in humans: high levels of
diffuse amyloid beta accumulation as well as hyperphosphorylated tau, predominantly in cortical and hippocampal areas [110]. These findings suggest that AD-like
neuropathology may have played an adaptive role in the
life histories of our pet's non-domesticated ancestors. Perhaps most long-lived mammals can benefit from diminishing the expenditure of resources on cognition during
the aging process. Very short-lived mammals, reptiles,
amphibians and fish generally do not show clear signs of
AD pathology [7], and this may be because their brains are
far smaller, their learning arcs are much abbreviated, their
life spans are typically much shorter and their life histories
are much different. Perhaps the degree of expression and
the severity of the symptoms increased in humans (relative to other mammals) because of life history parameters
characteristic of our species, such as large intergenerational resource flows, large brains and long lifespan.
Alzheimer's and the thrifty genotype
The human brain is an extravagantly expensive organ
[70]. In fact, the mass specific metabolic rate of brain tissue is over 22 times that of skeletal muscle [111]. Such a
ravenous organ can be viewed as an unfavorable encumbrance because it is known that the Plio-Pleistocene was
marked by recurring ice ages where large, polar glaciations
would frequently cause the African savannah to become
arid, hot and nutritionally scarce [64,112]. Such unpredictability of food resources in our environment of evolutionary adaptedness is widely thought to have seriously
impacted the human genome [113]. In fact, the blossoming science of "evolutionary medicine" has pointed out
that many human diseases are simply vestiges of our
hunter-gatherer existence and some of the best characterized among these are thought to have provided protection
against starvation [8]. Genetic tendencies toward adiposity and insulin resistance would have helped our metabolisms deal with low food availability in the ancestral
environment, but in modern times are responsible for the
high incidence of obesity and diabetes [114]. Many meta-

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/5/1/13

bolic disorders have been shown to represent mismatches
– in the way our bodies are regulated – between the austerity of the ancestral environment the cheap abundance
of calories and fats seen in modern times.
The thrifty genotype hypothesis [115] posits that certain
human genes that are associated with increased risk for
metabolic disease today were naturally selected in the past
because they helped their bearers to be more 'thrifty' with
energy stores. According to this hypothesis, phenotypes
that express low metabolic rates enjoy a survival advantage under deprived circumstances. However, they face
increased risk of negative health consequences when sugars and fats are artificially abundant [116]. Thrifty genes,
associated with a number of different metabolic traits, are
thought to allow an organism to conserve calories,
increase fat deposition and adopt a sedentary nature
[117]. Interestingly, AD patients are well-known to
exhibit many of these well-established thrifty traits, suggesting that genes that predispose to AD neuropathology
may be part of a complement of thrifty genes that have a
tendency to present comorbidly.
The metabolic syndrome, a suite of thrifty traits that tend
to present together including obesity, diabetes and heart
disease, has been strongly tied to AD [106]. Studies even
show that AD patients have lower levels of physical activity and energy expenditure than age-matched elderly individuals that do not have AD [118,119]. Both old age and,
especially, AD have been associated with lower testosterone levels, lower muscle mass, lower thyroid levels, lower
growth hormone levels, insulin resistance, increased adiposity, upregulated hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis
and a significantly lower resting metabolic rate [67,68].
Because modern day individuals that develop AD show a
highly increased propensity for developing these traits, we
can expect that this was also the case in ancestral times,
and that such individuals would have enjoyed increased
survival under deprived circumstances.
The thrifty phenotype hypothesis has been used widely to
interpret distinct patterns of the geographic distribution
of genes that are associated with the metabolic syndrome.
This widely accepted interpretation emphasizes that, populations of foraging individuals that live in areas where,
until recently, food has been relatively unpredictable or
frequently scarce have much higher prevalence of thrifty
genes [120]. The traits that these genes code for helped
these individuals survive during prolonged periods of
scarcity by allowing them to maintain low basal metabolic rates [115]. Recent research has shown that the geographic distribution of the gene most strongly related to
AD susceptibility – the APOE 4 allele – matches the geographic distribution for all the other major thrifty genes,
such as insulin resistance and increased adiposity. This

Behavioral and Brain Functions 2009, 5:13

has influenced some researchers to hypothesize that
APOE 4 may also be a thrifty gene [97]. These findings further indicate that AD may represent a type of thrifty phenotype that would have been well-suited for nutritional
scarcity.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been characterized
as a disorder that is a prototypic example of Darwinian
medicine and the thrifty phenotype. It has been thought
for decades now that, on a cellular and organ system level,
the disorder represents a thrifty condition – insulin resistance – that would have only rarely manifested as disease
in the ancestral environment because at that time individuals had no access to pure sugar or processed foods [115].
The current literature holds that insulin resistance,
brought about by genes for T2DM, represents a finely
tuned physiological state and that its cellular and molecular pathways have been refined by natural selection over
millions of years to help the organism conserve blood
sugar [117]. Not surprisingly, AD and T2DM share many
common biochemical and physiological pathways. The
uncanny resemblances include widespread changes in
insulin signaling, changes in transforming growth factor
systems, similarly high counts of hyperphosphorylated
proteins, and dense aggregations of amyloid peptides
[121]. Fascinatingly, there is a 90 percent structural similarity between the amyloid peptide in AD and the islet
amyloid polypeptide in T2DM; this close correspondence
in amino acid sequence is thought to suggest similar physiological roles [122]. In addition, other peptides such as
APOE, heparin sulfate proteoglycans and serum amyloid
P play "crucial" roles in both T2DM and AD [123,124].
The literature on the adaptive functions of diabetes has
never been reconciled with the literature on the similarities between AD and T2DM. A comprehensive comparison of pathology between the two should be informed by
the hypothesis that AD is also a thrifty condition.
Each of the thrifty conditions discussed here have inherent drawbacks. The organism is calibrated to expend less
energy, supply lines are narrowed and functionality is
constrained. Every adaptation in evolutionary science represents a tradeoff where an interest in one concern is
emphasized at the expense of another. The foremost,
omnipresent concern for all life forms is "the struggle for
sustenance" and the brain changes that accompany aging
are clearly a response to this concern. Paradoxically
though, these changes are being made at the expense of
the human mind. The present hypothesis, though simple
and straightforward, may remain hostile or inconceivable
to many because of humanity's anthropocentric perspective on the mind. That the metabolic output of internal
organs can decrease in response to starvation does not
constitute a hostile idea. That the metabolic output in the
"organ of thought" might also decrease, however, is
unfriendly for many philosophical (Cartesian dualist)

http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/5/1/13

reasons. Perhaps the main reason that this is unfriendly is
that many people have never considered that their
thoughts arise from, and in every sense are made possible
by, ingested food. We have come to revere our own minds
so much that it is hard for us to see that advanced intelligence, like every biological adaptation, can be maladaptive under the right circumstances.
"Paradoxically, sometimes losing neurons can improve brain
function, as happens when synaptic connections and neurons
that have not been extensively used die off, in perhaps the most
dramatic case of use it or lose it. Keeping unused neurons supplied with blood, oxygen and energy is wasteful, and getting rid
of them keeps the brain more focused and efficient."
-Norman Doidge, 2007 [47]
It has been concluded that millions of years of drastic fluctuations in food availability would have exposed our close
ancestors to periods of unavoidable hunger and starvation
[64,112]. After sufficient time passes without a meal, the
body's cells exhaust the supply of blood sugars and
hypoglycemia ensues. When the nutrients from the last
meal are depleted, the body begins to catabolize stored
energy. Glycogen from the liver and muscles can sustain a
moderately active human for several hours, but when
these fuel stores run out the body must begin to burn supplies of fat. The process of ketosis liberates body fat for use
in the muscles and brain; however, the brain has priority
over these fuel reserves. Many tissues in the body can
down-regulate their metabolic rate in the absence of
energy, but the brain cannot [125]. Once the brain can no
longer extract the fuel it requires from the blood, unconsciousness, coma and death ensue [126]. This shows that
the disproportionately gluttonous human brain can
potentially be an extravagant liability. Inability to temper
this organ with age would have created a burden that our
aging forebears could often not afford.

Implications of the hypothesis
As longevity around the world continues to climb, the
incidence of AD has been increasing steadily. Today, it is
estimated that about four million people in the United
States suffer from AD and that number is expected to triple before 2050 [127]. It has even been called the pandemic of the 21st century [128]. In the environment of
evolutionary adaptedness, our lives were far shorter and
true cases of AD would have been extremely rare throughout prehistory. It is commonly pointed out that evolution
has no foresight or predictive capacity and, unfortunately,
it seems that an adaptation that was meant to help our
ancestors now makes us susceptible today to senile
dementia since we have artificially extended our lifespan.
It may not possible at this point to determine irrefutably
if AD is a protective adaptation that served a purpose durPage 10 of 14

ing human evolution. Further analysis and experimentation should allow more definite conclusions. For instance:
(1) the formation of plaques and tangles should prove to
be the most energy and resource efficient way for neurons
to lose connections; (2) the neuropathology should
present only in brain areas that are consistent with neuroecological rationale; (3) patterns of heritability and etiology should reflect evolutionary trends; (4) onset of
pathology should coincide with ages of reduced foraging
ability; and (5) molecular patterns and evolutionary signatures (such as relative intron-exon selection) should
reveal that the genes involved in AD were positively
selected relative to alternative alleles. The present hypotheses may also have major implications for medical
research and ultimately for treatment: (1) the pathways
that allow the reversal of hyperphosphorylated tau in
starving rats will hold key clues to reversing or preventing
AD (2) the close evolutionary association with diabetes
mellitus and other thrifty disorders should influence
researchers to focus on pathocomparative analyses (3)
theorists now have a reason to reconcile the vast literature
on thrifty genes, deprivation syndromes and phenotypic
plasticity with the literature on the pathophysiology of
AD.

a mobile to a sedentary strategy, and it actually spends the
rest of its life passively filter feeding – grabbing nutrients
as they float by [130]. After attaching to the rock, the little
creatures digest their brains and large regions of their own
nervous systems specifically in order to minimize energy
use [131]. They never grow them back.

The present evolutionary analysis of AD can be extended
in far reaching ways. It is known that the most conspicuous of the various changes that accompanied human evolution was the significant increase in relative brain size,
especially the size of the cerebral cortex. How human
encephalization was accomplished and why hominids
were selected for bigger brains despite the energetic costs
has been a subject of much debate [129]. Many of the concepts invoked in this debate might help to elucidate the
evolutionary basis for AD. Weighing the ecological costs
of AD with the benefits might prove to be very informative, and future work should include discussion of concepts like carnivory vs. herbivory, dietary quality,
encephalization index, the expensive tissue hypothesis,
food extraction techniques, life history theory, optimal
foraging theory, resting vs. maximal metabolic rate, total
energy budget, the Kleiber relationship, evolutionary theories of aging and others.

A thoughtful Talmudic commentary states that "scholars
become wiser as they age, but the noneducated become
foolish." Specialists in technical fields acquire large
amounts of knowledge over the years that, during old age,
allow them to converse fluently and intelligently on their
subject despite the cognitive morbidity that they may suffer. In a general sense, these sentiments reflect the idea
that whatever you spend much time doing, you become
an expert at. Much unlike today, every individual in prehistoric groups foraged throughout the day from a very
early age until death. The expertise gained from this would
have made them very "wise" at hunting and gathering. It
is the view espoused here that this physical and mental
wisdom, earned from decades of foraging, allowed foragers to reduce their investment in the 'fixed cost' of energy
consumption within the brain. Moreover, it is clear that
preclinical AD would not have been disruptive to the
implicit techniques, procedural knowledge or motor
praxes necessary for foraging, even though clinical AD is
disruptive to the explicit techniques, semantic knowledge
and declarative cognition necessary for both occupational
employment and autonomous living today.

Many species of marine animals called urochordates, also
known as tunicates and sea squirts, do an amazing job of
illustrating how intelligence and excessive nervous tissue
can be an encumbrance that natural selection will go to
lengths to protect against. This small invertebrate is born
with sense organs and a brain (a cerebral ganglion) and
resembles a tadpole. It needs its simple nervous system in
order to coordinate its behavior while searching for a
home early in life. The sea squirt has a second stage where
it locates a suitable surface on a rock and attaches itself
permanently. From then on, its life history changes from

Similarly, individuals in ancestral hunter-gatherer tribes
in their 30s, 40s and 50s must have experienced diminishing usefulness for higher order intelligence. They were no
longer fastidiously busy creating novel motor praxes,
learning foreign spatial maps or developing original
motor activities. The pressure on them to internalize unfamiliar information and to see unprecedented relationships between important variables dwindled every year of
their life as their experience increased. They were not
actively developing untried social skills to create new alliances or find new partners for copulation, and also were
not directly responsible for caring for infants or inculcating children. Further, they could no longer employ many
of the high yield foraging techniques that they utilized in
their youth, so they must have been quite receptive to the
benefits of adopting an alternate "thrifty cognitive" strategy.
