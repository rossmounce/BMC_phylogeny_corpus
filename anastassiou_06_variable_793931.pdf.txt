Abstract

Background

anisms could lead to valuable therapeutic strategies to suppress these defects.
An extreme case of mutually exclusive alternative splicing
occurs in the Drosophila Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene [5], which encodes an axon guidance
receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily with numerous
possible isoforms, which probably play key roles in the nervous system of the fly [6-8]. Recent results indicate that Dscam
also functions in the immune system [9,10]. In insect species,

information

Alternative splicing and its regulation are topics of increased
interest because of the evidence that most genes of advanced
organisms adopt this mechanism in response to developmental and cellular contexts to express molecularly distinct transcripts [1,2]. In some cases, splicing is mutually exclusive,
such that only one exon is chosen out of a cluster of alternative exons arranged in a tandem array [3]. Given that alternative splicing malfunction can lead to serious human genetic
diseases [4], efforts to unravel the underlying biologic mech-

interactions

Conclusion: On the basis of comparative sequence analysis, we propose efficient biologic
mechanisms of alternative splicing of the Drosophila Dscam gene that rely on the inherent structure
of the pre-mRNA. Related mechanisms employing 'locus control regions' could be involved on
other occasions of mutually exclusive choices of exons or genes.

refereed research

Results: We describe 'variable window binding' - a mechanism used for mutually exclusive
alternative splicing by which a segment ('window') of a conserved nucleotide 'anchor' sequence
upstream of the exon 6 cluster in the pre-mRNA of the fruitfly Dscam gene binds to one of the
introns, thereby activating selection of the exon directly downstream from the binding site. This
mechanism is supported by the fact that the anchor sequence can be inferred solely from a
comparison of the intron sequences using a genetic algorithm. Because the window location varies
for each exon choice, regulation can be achieved by obstructing part of that sequence. We also
describe a related mechanism based on competing pre-mRNA stem-loop structures that could
explain the mutually exclusive choice of exon 17 of the Dscam gene.

deposited research

Background: Genes of advanced organisms undergo alternative splicing, which can be mutually
exclusive, in the sense that only one exon is included in the mature mRNA out of a cluster of
alternative choices, often arranged in a tandem array. In many cases, however, the details of the
underlying biologic mechanisms are unknown.

The structure of the Dscam gene in six Drosophila spp
Figure 1
The structure of the Dscam gene in six Drosophila spp. The mature mRNA of each gene contains 22 exons, four of which (exon 4, exon 6, exon 9 and exon
17, shown in green, blue, yellow and red, respectively) are chosen from a cluster of alternative exons. The remaining 18 exons, shown in metallic gray, are
always selected. Introns are not shown. Red lines indicate an example choice of exons.

the organization of the Dscam gene is very similar but not
identical [11]. Here, we have selected six fully sequenced Drosophila spp. (Figure 1): D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D.
ananassae, D. pseudoobscura, D. mojavensis, and D. virilis.
In each of these six species, the Dscam gene contains four
clusters of alternative ('variable') exons. These are the clusters containing exon 4, exon 6, exon 9 and exon 17, selected
out of 12, 48, 33, and 2 alternative exons, respectively, in D.
melanogaster.
We use the following notation. Starting, for example, from the
variable exon 6 that is closest to the constant exon 5, we refer

to these exons as exon 6.1, exon 6.2, exon 6.3, and so on. Similarly, we refer to the partial introns between two consecutive
exons using the numbers of these exons. For example, the
partial intron between exons 6.32 and 6.33 is referred to as
intron 6.32-33. Similarly, we refer to the partial intron
between constant exon 5 and variable exon 6.1 as intron 5-6.1.
Using comparative sequence analysis, we discovered the basis
of a novel biologic mechanism, to which we refer as 'variable
window binding' (VWB), that could account for the mutually
exclusive selection of one exon from among the members of
cluster 6, as well as a related mechanism to explain the

The rows contain sets of orthologous exons, and each column refers to the species (Drosophila melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D.
pseudoobscura, D. mojavensis and D. virilis). Alignment was achieved by clustering together exons connected by neighboring branches in the
phylogenetic tree shown in Additional data file 1. Exons labeled by an asterisk (such as exon 6.11 of D. melanogaster, which has neither a dot plot line
in Figure 4 and no observed expression level in [12]) appear as isolated leaves in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that they are probably
nonfunctional and their sequences have randomly drifted by evolution.

mutually exclusive selection of one exon out of the two members of cluster 17.

Results
Discovery of anchor sequence
Because the Dscam gene of four out of the six Drosophila spp.
had not previously been annotated [11], we first generated the
missing annotations for all exons of cluster 6 using the existing annotations as benchmarks and ensuring that exons are
located in open reading frames. The resulting annotated
sequences for D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. mojavensis and
D. pseudoobscura have been deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers DQ317106, DQ317107, DQ317108 and
DQ317109, respectively. These can be accessed in addition to
the previously available annotated sequences for D. melanogaster (accession number AF260530) and D. virilis (accession number AY686597).
We then identified the homologous relationship of all cluster
6 variable exons in all six species, resulting in a 'multiple exon
alignment' (Table 1). This relationship is orthologous among
similar exons of different species, and paralogous for exons in
the same species [11], because exons are assumed to have
been created by reiterative duplication events [3]. We derived
the multiple exon alignment after first generating a phylogenetic tree (the generated tree is provided in Additional data
file 1) with leaves corresponding to conceptually translated
amino acid sequences for all exons [11]. Because the six species are closely related, almost all of the clusters of neighbor-

ing leaves of the tree correspond to orthologous exons of
different species, which can thus be conveniently aligned.
Based on the multiple exon alignment, we then created a
'multiple intron alignment' by aligning a set of introns if each
of them is located directly upstream of a member of a particular set of orthologous exons. We then searched for potential
cis-regulatory motifs by identifying the largest subsequences
that were conserved in all six species in each set of orthologous introns. We found that intron 5-6.1 contains a large subsequence of length 42, henceforth referred to as the 'anchor
sequence', which is precisely conserved among all six Drosophila spp.:

Reverse complementary motif detection
Remarkably, we observed that many of the conserved motifs
that we found in the sets of orthologous introns were the
reverse complement of part of the anchor sequence. This
observation led us to the hypothesis, which we confirmed
computationally, that a binding site for a subsegment, or
'window', of the anchor sequence is located upstream of
nearly all exons of cluster 6. There were very few exceptions
to this rule, such as the intron upstream of exon 6.11 of D.
melanogaster, which is probably non-functional because its
expression has not been detected [12,13].
Because the window of the anchor sequence binding on the
intronic elements is different for each exon choice, it has been

information

These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that
the existence of a complementary binding site is a requirement for exon selection (except for exon 6.1), and therefore

interactions

Exon 6.11 of D. melanogaster appears to be nonfunctional,
because its expression has never been observed [5,8,10,12,13]
and because it is isolated in the phylogenetic tree (Additional
data file 1). Such exons are labeled by an asterisk in Table 1,
and they also include exons 6.10, 6.36 and 6.42 of D. yakuba.
(Interestingly, exons 6.11 of D. melanogaster and 6.10 of D.
yakuba appear closely connected to each other if the phylogenetic tree - not shown - is made directly from DNA and not
from conceptually translated sequences, suggesting an evolutionary scenario leading to both of them becoming non-functional.) For all three such exons of D. yakuba, we observed
that their upstream introns did not contain binding sites for
the anchor sequence, and their size had been significantly
reduced (35, 27 and 47 for 6.10, 6.36 and 6.42, respectively).

refereed research

We found that the alignment scores for exons 6.1 in all six species were consistently low (10, 6, 8, 9, 9 and 9 for D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. ananassae, D. psedoobscura, D.
mojavensis and D. virilis, respectively). Therefore, the choice
of the first exon may exceptionally not require interaction
with the anchor sequence.

deposited research

Binding sites correspond to different but usually overlapping
'windows' from the anchor sequence. This mechanism is compatible with the fact that the choice of the exon is 'stochastic
yet biased', in accordance with observed expression data [12]
in single cells. The exon choice may be influenced by the existence of various splicing factors in a given cell type. For example, splicing inhibitors could bind at a location close to, and
obstructing, a given binding site region of the anchor
sequence. The exon choice may also depend on the precise
location of the window in the anchor sequence that binds on
the intron. For example, if the 'first half' of the anchor
sequence is obstructed from binding by a macromolecule or
macromolecular assembly (or knocked out in a genetic experiment), then (Figure 2a) exons 6.25 and 6.48 of D. melanogaster cannot be chosen, but exon 6.3, as well as some
other exons, can be selected. We refer to this model as 'VWB
regulation' of alternative splicing. There are indications that
VWB provides at least part of the regulatory mechanisms in
exon cluster 6, particularly because the location of the windows across some orthologous introns is conserved to different
degrees.
For
example,
the
sequence
5'GGCAGUUUUCAA-3' upstream of exon 6.25 (Figure 2b) is
perfectly conserved in all six species (Figure 3a), whereas in
some other orthologous introns we observe 'drifting' of the
window location. For example, the sequence 5'-CCAACAUUCAGGCAG-3' upstream of exon 6.48 of D. melanogaster (Figure 2c) drifts into 5'-AUUCAGGCAGUUUU-3' in the
orthologous exon 6.51 of D. virilis, and further into 5'UUCAGGCAGUUUUCA-3' in the orthologous exon 6.49 of D.
mojavensis, thus relocating into a different window of the
anchor sequence (Figure 3b). This fact suggests that the exons
corresponding to the former introns (of conserved window
location) are at least partly regulated by VWB, because the

The existence of binding sites in nearly all exons is illustrated
in dot plots (Figure 4). The precise predicted interactions of
the anchor sequence with the sequences extending up to 120
nucleotides upstream of each exon is shown in Additional
data file 2, created by performing Smith-Waterman alignment with the reverse complement of the anchor sequence.
For easier interpretation of the figure, matches were highlighted in red color, and consecutive matches of length
greater than five were highlighted in bold red color. The
resulting alignment scores are shown in each case and can be
seen as approximate indicators of binding strength. We found
that the score of the alignment between the reverse complement of the anchor sequence and a random sequence of
length 120 has mean 7.0 and standard deviation 1.3, implying
that, with high confidence, the 41 out of 48 predicted binding
sites with scores higher than 10 are not due to chance. Binding sites have an average distance of 60-70 nucleotides from
the selected exon, and a few appear to extend in the exon
upstream of the exon to be selected (indicated by gray shading). Among the seven exons with relatively low alignment
score, we believe that binding sites are missing from at least
two of them, namely 6.1 and 6.11, for the following reasons.

reports

The occurrence of regions within exon 6 cluster introns with
striking complementarity to the anchor sequence downstream from exon 5 naturally suggests a biologic mechanism
(Figure 2) that explains the mutual exclusivity of alternative
splicing of exon 6. We refer to this mechanism as 'variable
window binding' (VWB). A loop is created by base pairing
between a short segment or 'window' of the anchor sequence
with a complementary motif within an exon 6 intron, thereby
allowing the spliceosome to connect constant exon 5 with the
variable exon 6 now in proximity to the anchor sequence.

location of their window is vital, indicating that only the corresponding segment of the anchor sequence is available for
binding, while the remaining part is probably obstructed by a
regulatory molecule. On the other hand, the exons corresponding to the latter introns (of drifting window location)
are regulated by other types of splicing factors, or are not regulated at all.

difficult for these intronic binding sites to be detected as conserved motifs. Any isolated observations that part of the
intron 5-6.1 is complementary to a particular seemingly nonconserved region of another intron can be dismissed as being
due to chance, but not if this phenomenon happens for nearly
all introns of all Drosophila spp. By using the systematic
methodology described above, we isolated the individual sets
of orthologous introns, many of which conserve the location
of the anchor sequence window, and so these intronic elements were readily detected as conserved motifs.

partial obstruction of the anchor sequence will influence exon
selection. Interestingly, a few of the introns appear to have
two binding sites (Figure 4), which may be a mechanism overcoming VWB regulatory inhibition of the selection of those
exons.

A computational strategy to reconstruct the anchor
sequence from intron sequences
Given the sequences of the introns of cluster 6, can we reconstruct the anchor sequence, assuming no previous knowledge

about it? For example, if we had not revealed the anchor
sequence, could someone derive it using only knowledge of,
say, introns 6.1-2, 6.2-3 ... 6.47-48 of D. melanogaster? The
answer is 'yes'. Using a 'genetic algorithm' (software implemented in MATLAB is provided in Additional data file 3), one
can reconstruct the anchor sequence by maximizing a score
('fitness function') assigned to nucleotide sequences of a particular length. The score is defined as the sum of the scores of
a local (Smith-Waterman) alignment between the complementary sequence and the known introns. If an initial

We have performed extensive comparative sequence analysis
looking for conserved motifs throughout the Dscam premRNA among six Drosophila spp. This search revealed several perfectly conserved motifs, some of which appear as complementary pairs, which may lead to stem structures. The
functionality of several of the conserved motifs and potential
stem structures is not obvious, but in the case of exons 6 and
17 they suggested elegant biologic mechanisms of competing
secondary structures that could help to explain the mutually
exclusive choice of these exons. The roles of some stem structures in regulating alternative splicing were also recently
shown [15] to be that they bring in proximity the two flanking
sequences.

information

We have identified two pairs of complementary conserved
motifs on intron 16-17.1 (AAATGCAATTTGTTT with
AAACAAATTGCATT, and ACAACAACCAAAG with CTTTGGTTGTTGT). As shown in Figure 6, the choice of a particular binding pair could be part of the mechanism determining
whether exon 17.1 or exon 17.2 is selected. If the latter stem
(via binding of the blue sequences in Figure 6) is implemented, then it potentially obstructs the splicing branch
point of intron 16-17.1, thereby inhibiting the selection of

Discussion

interactions

The fact that pre-mRNA alternative secondary structures, the
choice of which can be stochastic and influenced by splicing
factors, can determine alternative splicing selections is
increasingly appreciated [14], and VWB-based alternative
splicing is such a case. A similar mechanism involving internal base pairing interactions between distal segments of the
pre-mRNA could also account for the binary choice between
exon 17.1 and 17.2 of the Drosophila Dscam gene (Figure 1).

exon 17.1 and resulting in the selection of exon 17.2. On the
other hand, if the stem is implemented via binding of the red
sequences, then exon 16 could be spliced directly to exon 17.1.
The presence of these two competing stem structures could
constitute a novel mechanism involved in the mutually exclusive choice of only two exons. However, this is not as clear as
with the exon 6 cluster, in which there was a unique anchor
sequence, because it is possible for both of them to occur
simultaneously through the formation of a pseudoknot. If this
is indeed the underlying mechanism, then splicing regulation
of exon 17 could be achieved by splicing factors, such as
microRNAs or proteins, that bind on one of these sites (for
instance, red or blue), resulting in the selection of the secondary structure involving the unobstructed stem.

deposited research

random 'seed' sequence undergoes random 'mutations' (substitutions, insertions, and deletions) and 'survives' only if
these mutations improve the score (Figure 5a), then it
becomes gradually 'mutated' into the reverse complement of
the anchor sequence (Figure 5b). The sequence converges to
the reverse complement of the same anchor sequence in each
of the six cases where the intron inputs are only taken from
one species. This technique can be used to reconstruct the
anchor sequences from other potential cases of VWB-based
mutually exclusive selection of exons, providing the most
convincing argument next to genetic experimentation that
these binding sites are real.

A paper with similar conclusions [21] was published while
this manuscript was under review.

refereed research

As in exon 6, many of the corresponding sets of orthologous
introns within clusters 4 and 9 contain conserved motifs;

As another example, in intron 17.2-18 there are two pairs of
complementary conserved motifs (AAAATATACCAAC with
GTTGGTATATTTT, and AAGATGCTTTT with AAAAGCATCTT), which, as was the case with intron 16-17.1, are
arranged in a manner suggesting either two mutually exclusive stems or a pseudoknot.

deposited research

As for exon clusters 4 and 9, they appear to be more regulated
compared with exon 6 [12,16], in the sense that most of their
exons appear at varying degrees of expression at various tissues and developmental stages. We found that intron 4.12-5
contains several perfectly conserved large motifs, such as
CCCTTCATGTAGTTGAA and CAAAAATGCTAATAA, with
the latter one offering a potential binding site for another,
smaller, conserved, complementary motif, GCATTTTTG, also
in intron 4.12-5.

The arrangement of a tandem array of mutually exclusive
exons in the middle of a pre-mRNA molecule is strikingly
similar to the arrangement of a tandem array of genes
expressed in a mutually exclusive manner, suggesting the
possibility that mutual exclusivity is implemented using similar mechanisms. Specifically, we propose that an 'activating
complex', itself activated by binding to an anchor sequence,
activates the expression of a gene after looping of doublestranded DNA; this may help to explain the mutually exclusive expression [17,18] of tandem arrays of genes. This mechanism has already been proposed [19] in the case of olfactory
receptors, following the discovery of a highly conserved
sequence, referred to as the 'H region', upstream of a tandem
array of olfactory receptor genes. The suggestion in that case
was that an activating complex is formed in the H region that
interacts with one of the promoter sites activating the corresponding gene, such that the resulting DNA looping explains
mutual exclusivity for the particular array of genes. When the
H region was deleted, the genes in the cluster were not
expressed. Similarly, we expect that when the anchor
sequence of the Dscam gene is deleted, none of the exon 6
alternatives can be chosen. There are also other similar
known cases in which such a 'locus control region' may lead to
mutual exclusivity [20].

reports

The vertical line indicates the border between the end of exon
18 and the beginning of intron 18-19. Because both exons 18
and 19 are constant, we speculate that this, previously not
noted, conserved area could be involved in the formation of
the general initial secondary structure of the pre-mRNA. We
note that two smaller conserved motifs (TAAATGTTG and
ATTGGAAATT), also on intron 18-19, are both complementary to segments of this large motif.

reviews

however, these do not appear to be complementary to any
anchor sequence. We propose that some of these motifs serve
as binding sites of an intervening activating protein or complex, which is itself activated by first binding to an 'anchor
sequence'. Under this hypothesis, as in the VWB-controlled
case of exon 6, mutual exclusivity can be partly explained by
the pre-mRNA loop uniquely connecting an anchor sequence
with these binding sites.

of the anchor sequence with the region upstream of each of

interactions

We have described novel mechanisms that are potentially
involved in the mutually exclusive exon selection in the Drosophila Dscam gene. Using computational methods and comparative sequence analysis, we have identified conserved
intronic sequence motifs within exon cluster 6. We propose
that mutual exclusive base pairing of each of these motifs with
a complementary axon sequence downstream from exon 5
lead naturally to the selection of specific cluster 6 exons
brought into proximity of exon 5 by the resultant 'looping' of
the Dscam pre-mRNA. Our comparative sequence analysis
also revealed a related mechanism whereby competing stemloop structures are proposed to control a binary choice of one
or the other of the pair of cluster 17 exons. These findings are
important because they suggest specific experimental strategies to define the mechanisms that regulate these processes,
and because the computational approach that revealed these
sequence motifs can now be widely utilized to test the generality of these models for the vast majority of genes from

be spliced directly into exon 17.1.

Genetic program for reconstructing anchor sequence
from intron sequences

6.

We used the score of a local (Smith-Waterman) alignment of
one sequence with the reverse complement of another
sequence to estimate the "strength" of a potential binding site
between the two, and defined the optimization problem as
finding a sequence that maximizes the sum of the scores of all
such alignments. The algorithm uses as input all 47 introns of
D. melanogaster, starting from 6.1-2 up to and including
6.47-48. It does not make any use whatsoever of the anchor
sequence, which is located in a different intron, namely 5-6.1.
It attempts to guess what that anchor sequence is by maximizing a score (the sum of the local alignment scores of a 'mutating' sequence with the reverse complements of all of these 47
introns). It starts from a totally random 'seed' sequence of
length 30, which gradually 'mutates' in various ways, and the
mutation 'survives' only if the score becomes larger. The
mutation operations can be 'insertion', 'deletion', or 'substitution'. A random nucleotide is chosen as the mutation site and
one of the mutation operations is chosen, each with
probability 1/3. The insertion operation inserts a nucleotide
and either pushes the original sequence to the right or to the
left with equal probability, in which case the final nucleotide
in the pushing direction is discarded so that the mutating
sequence is kept at a constant length. The deletion operation
deletes the nucleotide and moves the sequence either to the
left or to the right with equal probability. The substitution
operation changes the nucleotide to one of the others with
equal probability for all nucleotides.
