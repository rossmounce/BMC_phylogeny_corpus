Abstract
Background: Halibuts are commercially important flatfish species confined to the North Pacific
and North Atlantic Oceans. We have determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequences
of four specimens each of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus
stenolepis) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and assessed the nucleotide
variability within and between species.
Results: About 100 variable positions were identified within the four specimens in each halibut
species, with the control regions as the most variable parts of the genomes (10 times that of the
mitochondrial ribosomal DNA). Due to tandem repeat arrays, the control regions have unusually
large sizes compared to most vertebrate mtDNAs. The arrays are highly heteroplasmic in size and
consist mainly of different variants of a 61-bp motif. Halibut mitochondrial genomes lacking arrays
were also detected.
Conclusion: The complexity, distribution, and biological role of the heteroplasmic tandem repeat
arrays in halibut mitochondrial control regions are discussed. We conclude that the most plausible
explanation for array maintenance includes both the slipped-strand mispairing and DNA
recombination mechanisms.

Background
Halibuts (family Pleuronectidae) represent the largest of
the flatfish species. Whereas Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus
hippoglossus) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis)
are endemic species confined to the North Atlantic and
North Pacific Oceans, respectively, the Greenland halibut
(Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) has an Arctic-boreal distribution in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. All three species are commercially important flatfishes with extensive

annual catch volumes, and the Atlantic halibut has further
become increasingly popular in North European aquaculture [1]. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences supports a sister taxa
affiliation of the Hippoglossus and Reinhardtius halibuts
among the Pleuronectidae [2].
Genetic markers have been developed to investigate and
assess genetic issues within e.g. taxonomy, systematics,

conservation biology, population structuring, or breeding
programs. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has become one
of the most popular genetic markers [3,4] due to its small
size and stable organization, its simple inheritance pattern (maternal without apparent DNA recombination),
high copy number, and elevated mutation rate compared
to single-copy nuclear DNA. Vertebrate mtDNA is usually
less than 17 kb in size with a plasmid-like organization,
encoding only 37 gene products (13 protein-coding
genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and 2 ribosomal RNA
genes) as well as a main control region (CR) containing
transcriptional promoters, at least one of the replication
origins as well as the displacement loop (D-loop) [5].
Mitogenomics has been developed to increase the resolution of mtDNA markers by including the complete mitochondrial genome sequence in the analyses. Recently,
several genetic issues in bony fishes have been successfully
investigated and resolved by mitogenomic analyses, e.g.
higher-order taxonomy [6,7], within-family taxonomy
[8,9], within-genus taxonomy [10,11], and intraspecific
variability among geographically separated populations
[11,12]. However, vertebrate mtDNA has some limitations and possible shortcomings as a molecular marker
that are important to be aware of, and to further investigate [13,14]. Occasional biparental inheritance has been
reported, which challenges the clonal maternal nature of
vertebrate mtDNA, and some of the best-known examples
are found in human and mice [15,16]. Mitochondrial
DNA recombination, sometimes recognizable as a consequence of biparental inheritance, appears more frequently
than originally assumed but is still a rare event in vertebrates [17]. Here, heteroplasmic tandem repeat (HTR)
arrays in the CR may change due to DNA recombination,
with some notable examples reported from bony fishes
[18-20]. Finally, mtDNA is not always a strictly neutral
marker, and both direct and indirect selection has been
noted [13]. ATPase6 gene variation in humans [21] and
the inherited bacterial symbionts in arthropods [22] represent fascinating examples of mtDNA selection.
In the present study we have assessed the nucleotide variability in halibut mitochondrial genomes within and
between species. The complete mitochondrial genome
sequences from four individuals each of the Atlantic-,
Pacific-, and Greenland halibuts were determined and
analysed. A complex organized HTR array in the mitochondrial CR was discovered and investigated in further
detail. These composite arrays provide new evidence of
DNA recombination in vertebrate mitochondria.

Results
Gene content and organization of halibut mitochondrial
genomes
The complete mitochondrial genome sequences were
determined for four individuals each of Atlantic halibut
(H. hippoglossus), Pacific halibut (H. stenolepsis), and
Greenland halibut (R. hippoglossoides) (Table 1). The circular mtDNAs were identical in gene content (13 protein
coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer
RNA genes) and organization compared to most vertebrates, but varied in size between 17.546 kb and 18.139
kb (Figure 1; Table 1), which are about 1 kb larger than
most bony fish mitochondrial genomes [23]. However,
these sizes are not absolute since HTRs are observed
within the mitochondrial CR (see below). The GC contents of the mitochondrial genomes were 46.1%, 45.7%,

and 45.1% for Atlantic-, Pacific, and Greenland halibuts,
respectively. These values are similar to most sequenced
bony fish mitochondrial genomes. Furthermore, the
codon usage was found to be very similar among the three
halibut species investigated and with general discrimination against G at the third nucleotide position.
The mitochondrial control regions contain heteroplasmic
tandem repeat arrays
Intergenic regions are practically lacking in halibut mtDNAs, except for the short spacer between the tRNA-Asn
and tRNA-Cys genes that contains the origin of lightstrand (oriL) replication, and the major CR (contains the
D-loop) located between the tRNA-Pro and tRNA-Phe
genes (Figure 1). Whereas the former region is completely
conserved in sequence between the 12 analysed halibut
specimens, the latter is more variable and contains control
elements like the origin of heavy-strand (oriH) replication
and the transcriptional promoters.

A schematic presentation of the CR organization is shown
in Figure 2A. All specimens contain extensive direct repeat
arrays located between the conserved sequence box (CSB)
3 and the tRNA-Phe gene. These arrays were similar
among the halibut species investigated, and consist of a
free-standing 11-bp motif flanking each side of the array
as well as variable numbers of a 61-bp motif in between.
In Atlantic halibut the investigated specimens Hh-1, Hh2, Hh-3, and Hh-4 contain 12, 13, 19, and 15 copies,
respectively, of the 61-bp motif in a plasmid cloned representative of the CRs (Figure 2B). Interestingly, eight different variants of the 61-bp motifs were identified (HTR
motifs I to VIII) with a distinct, but scattered distribution
pattern within and between specimens (Figure 2B). Similar patterns and distributions were observed both for the
Pacific halibut (17–19 HTR copies; Figure 2C) and Green-

land halibut (17–21 HTR copies; Figure 2D), but with less
complexity compared to the Atlantic halibut.
A PCR-amplification and DNA sequencing approach was
included to assess the heteroplasmic patterns of the HTRmotif arrays. The HTR region and some flanking
sequences were amplified from DNA isolated from all 12
specimens (Figure 3A) and subsequently separated by agarose electrophoresis (Figure 3B). Extensive heteroplasmic
features were observed for all 12 specimens, with the most
common copy numbers of the 61-bp repeat of about
15–20. The four smallest amplified fragments (named a-d
in Figure 3B) from one specimen of Atlantic halibut (Hh2) were eluted from the gel, cloned into a plasmid vector,
and subsequently DNA sequenced. The results are summarized in Figure 3C and confirm that the fragments
present in the agarose gel as ladder patterns differs in size
by one 61-bp motif. Surprisingly, the smallest fragment
(fragment d) lacks a complete 61-bp motif and only contains a few copies of the free-standing 11-bp motif.
Distribution of sequence variation within the halibut
mitochondrial genomes
Nucleotide substitutions and deletions were assessed by
comparing the complete mtDNA sequence of the 4 specimens of each halibut species. The total numbers of variable sites identified were 105, 103, and 119 in Atlantic-,
Pacific-, and Greenland halibuts, respectively. The variable sites include all protein coding and ribosomal RNA
genes, the CR, and nine of the 22 transfer RNA genes (Figure 4). Transition substitutions at third codon positions of
protein coding genes were the most common changes,
and nucleotide deletions were only observed at one site in
the Atlantic halibut CR.

In order to further evaluate the distribution of sequence
variation among the halibut mitochondrial genes, both

Organization of tandem repeat arrays located within the control region of halibut mtDNAs
Organization of tandem repeat arrays located within the control region of halibut mtDNAs. (A) Schematic organization of the control region
(CR) representing all analysed halibut species and specimens. CR is located between the tRNA genes Pro (P) and Phe (F), and contains the highly conserved termination association sequence (TAS: TACATGTATAA), conserved sequence box D (CSB-D: CCTGGCATTTGGTTCC), pyrimidine sequence
run (Py-run: TTCTCTTTTTTTTTTTCCTTTC), and the two conserved sequence boxes associated with oriH (CSB-2: AAACCCCCCTACCCCCC, and
CSB-2: TGAAAACCCCCCGGAAACA). The heteroplasmic tandem repeat (HTR) array is located between CSB-3 and tRNA-F gene. (B) Detailed view of
the HTR array in cloned and sequenced CR from the Atlantic halibut (H. hippoglossus) specimens. The 61-bp HTR motif was found in 12, 13, 19, and 15
copies in Hh-1, Hh-2, Hh-3, and Hh-4, respectively. The HTR motif starts with an 11-bp submotif (boxed), also found freestanding flanking the 61-bp array
motif. Eight different variants of the HTR motif (I-VIII) were noted in Atlantic halibut. Hh-2 has one additional freestanding 11-bp motifs compared to the
other specimens. (C) HTR array in Pacific halibut (H. stenolepsis) specimens Hs-1 to Hs-4. Two different variants of the motif were found. (D) HTR array
in Greenland halibut (R. hippoglossoides) specimens Rh-1 to Rh-4. Five different variants of the motif were found.

Heteoplasmic features of HTR arrays in halibut mtDNA. (A) Schematic map of the analysed HTR and flanking regions. The HTR arrays were
amplified using a forward primer (FP) and a reverse primer (RP). Here, primer sets L16293/H17347 and L16376/H17369 were used on Atlantic/Pacific halibuts and Greenland halibut, respectively. (B) Separation of amplified products in a 2.5% agarose gel. M, the size marker 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder from Invitrogen (right). Number of repeat motifs is indicated (left). The four smallest amplified fragments from Hh-2 (marked a, b, c, and d) were eluted from the
gel and further sequence analysed. (C) Summary of sequence analyses of fragment a-d from Hh-2. Note that fragment a contains three repeats of the 61bp motif (I*, II, II), fragment b contains two repeat motifs (II, II), fragment c contains a single motif (II), and fragment d lacks a complete motif. Motif I* is not
present in the plasmid cloned array of Hh-2 (Figure 2) and may represent site heteroplasmy at array motif position 33.

within and between species, substitution versus nucleotide position was estimated for the different gene
regions. This ratio was then divided by the ratio obtained
for the mitochondrial ribosomal DNA (mt-rDNA; mtSSU
+ mtLSU; 2665 bp) in order to estimate a relative number
of the mitochondrial gene region variation that could be
compared between different species and datasets. Despite
the fact that numbers of specimens are too low to perform
statistics, some general trends were seen (Table 2). First,
protein coding genes were about 3–4 times more variable
than mt-rDNA both within and between species. The cytochrome c oxydase (CO) subunits were slightly more conserved than the other mitochondrial encoded subunits.

Second, the tRNA gene pool (ca 1550 bp) has a similar
sequence variation rate as the mt-rDNA. Finally, whereas
the CR possesses a between-species sequence variation
similar to that of most of the protein genes, it was clearly
elevated within the halibut species. In fact, the CRs in
Atlantic-, Pacific, and Greenland halibuts were about 10
times more variable per site than the corresponding mtrDNAs.
Based on the knowledge about gene specific variability
within halibut mtDNA we selected three regions with
moderate to high sequence variation (parts of ND1, COI,
and CR) for an extended study of Atlantic halibut. Thirty

Notes: 1 Protein genes – all gene positions except stop codons. The variable sites are mainly transition substitutions at third codon positions. CR –
control region nucleotides including the first and last three motifs of tandem repeates. tRNA genes – pool of all 22 tRNA genes, ca 1550 bp; SSU +
LSU – combined mitochondrial small and large ribosomal subunit RNA genes, ca 2665 bp.
2 Estimated avarage values within the three halibut species (Atlantic-, Pacific-, and Greenland halibuts) based on four specimens of each. The
observed variation value is number of variable sites divided on total number of nucleotides of that particular mitochondrial region. The relative
variation value is the observed variation divided on the combined SSU/LSU variation.
3 Estimated nucleotide variation between halibut species and includes the Atlantic halibut (Hh-1 specimen), Pacific halibut (Hs-1 specimen),
Greenland halibut (Rh-1 specimen), Spotted halibut, and Barfin flounder. Key features of species are given in Table 1.
4 Estimated nucleotide variation within pollocks (Theragra; Gadidae) and is based on 12 specimens representing one single species [11, 12].
5 The elevated substitution level in CR within halibut species is boxed.

additional specimens (15 wild caught and 15 farmed
progenies) from a halibut hatchery were subjected to
mtDNA PCR analysis (Figure 5A) and subsequently DNA
sequencing. Here, a 1770 bp region was analysed and
compared, and the results are summarized in Figure 5B.
When including the 4 completely sequenced specimens
(Hh-1 to Hh-4), 24 variable sites were detected resulting
in 13 distinct haplotypes (Haplotypes a-m). Interestingly,
15 specimens possess an identical haplotype (Haplotype
g; Figure 5B), all corresponding to the farmed progenies
that probably reflect siblings, or half siblings. This result
supports the potential of mtDNA as molecular marker in
breeding programs, stock assessments, or population
studies.

Discussion
We have sequenced and compared the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 4 individuals each of the
flatfish species Atlantic halibut, Pacific halibut, and
Greenland halibut, all related members of the family
Pleuronectidae. The mitochondrial genomes were similar
to most other bony fish species, except for an unusual
large and complex CR located between the tRNA-Pro and
tRNA-Phe genes. Halibut CR contains a HTR array of a 61-

bp motif, most frequently present in 15–20 copies of each
individual.
The within-species variation in mtDNA includes only
about 20–100 sequence positions between the individuals. These numbers correlates well with those observed
among 12 individuals of Theragra pollocks [11,12]. The
variable sites are not equally distributed along the mitochondrial genome sequence, with the structural RNA
genes as the most conserved sequence regions (Table 2).
The latter observation is best explained by the complex
structural constrains of their corresponding tRNA and
rRNAs due to secondary and tertiary RNA:RNA interactions, as well as RNA:protein interactions. Interestingly,
the structure determination of the vertebrate mitochondrial ribosome explains some of the dramatic reduction in
size of the mitochondrial rRNAs, which leaves almost
exclusively the highly conserved regions involved in ribosome function and ribosomal protein binding [24].
The elevated within-species sequence variation in CR
observed in all three halibut species (Table 2) appears
unique compared to other investigated fish mtDNA
genomes. The only fish species were complete mtDNA
sequences have been recovered from multiple specimens

Mitochondrial haplotype in Atlantic halibut

(12 individuals) is the Theragra pollocks [11,12]. Intraspecific sequence variability estimates were similar to that of
the halibut species, but with a notable exception of the
CR. The Theragra CR showed variability similar to that of
the protein coding genes, an observation significantly different from that of halibuts (Table 2). The variable sites in
halibuts are almost exclusively located in the extended termination associated sequence (ETAS) and CSB regions
located at the 5' end and 3' end of the CR, respectively.
What molecular processes that causes this elevated
sequence variability is currently not known, but DNA
recombination events at HTR arrays (see below) are likely
to be involved.
HTRs in mitochondrial CR are widespread, but scattered
among vertebrates [18]. Five different locations within the
mitochondrial CR have been noted to harbour HTRs [25].
Whereas the RS1 and RS2 sites are located at the CR 5' end

in proximity to the termination association sequence, RS3
to RS5 are located close to the oriH replication at the 3'
end of the CR. Thus, the presence of HTR in CR is probably associated with the DNA replication processes in vertebrate mtDNA [13]. The complexity of HTR motifs vary
greatly among different vertebrates, from simple di- and
tetra-nucleotide microsatellites to motifs more than 150
bp in length and at high copy numbers [26-28].
The halibut 61-bp motif HTR array is located at site RS5
between CSB-3 and the 3' end of CR (Figure 2A), and differs from the RS1 HTR arrays seen in e.g. Atlantic cod and
Asian arowana that consist of only 2–6 copies of approximately 40-bp motifs [28-30]. The RS5 HTR is a conserved
feature among the Pleuronectidae where a ca 60-bp motif
array is present in e.g. Spotted halibut (Verasper variegatus;
DQ403797), Barfin flounder (V. moseri; EF025506), Winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), Yellowtail

flounder (Limanda ferruginea), and American plaice (Hippologlossoides platessoides) [31], in addition to the three halibut species investigated in this study. Interestingly, RS5
direct repeats are also noted in Soleidae, but these appear
unrelated in sequence to the Pleuronectidae HTRs and do
not create heteroplasmy in mtDNA [32]. Partial sequencing of the mitochondrial CR in European flounder (Platichthys flesus) identified a different repeat motif at RS1
[19,33]. This 19-bp motif was involved in extensive heteroplasmy identified in a study including 168 individuals
[19]. Interestingly, two different types of repeat motifs
were noted among the 18 individuals studied in more
detail, and one of these contains a compound array consisting of both motif types. Our finding of multiple types
of HTR motifs in Atlantic-, Pacific-, and Greenland halibuts represents an extended support of the observation in
European flounder. Errors during mtDNA replication (e.g.
slipped strand mispairing) [34] cannot fully explain the
halibut length heteroplasmy since repeat motifs in arrays
of most individuals are not identical (Figure 2). Furthermore, technically generated mutations in the sequences,
as well as the possibility that an ancestral sequence variant
that contained all motif variants, are both highly unlikely
explanations since the same type of motifs appear in more
than one species and that eight different types were
present among the four individuals of Atlantic halibut.
Thus, we strongly favour DNA recombination as the most
plausible mechanism, a conclusion supporting the findings of Hoarau and co-workers in European flounder
mtDNA [19].
Is there a biological role of the mitochondrial HTR arrays
in halibuts? The facts that repeat motifs are highly conserved in sequence both between individuals and between
Pleuronectidae species (Figure 2) indicate a functional
role in the mitochondria. However, mitochondrial
genomes lacking the motif, or with only a single copy
present (Figure 3), favour no essential role of the array or
the motif sequences. The deletion variant (fragment d in
Figure 3C) may represent a dead-end of array heteroplasmy unless the HTR motif is reintroduced by DNA
recombination. Interestingly, the deleted region is flanked
by identical copies of the 11-bp motif and thus probably
is generated by a slipped strand mispairing-like process
[34], similar to that reported in mitochondria associated
with some human diseases [35]. The HTR arrays in halibuts are located between the putative promoter region (3'
end of CR) and oriH, and HTRs in RS5 have been functionally linked to the initiation of mtDNA replication
[27]. A role of stable secondary structures of nucleotide
repeats nucleotides has been suggested. Such putative
structures might act at the RNA or DNA levels [36], but at
present no experimental biochemical evidence has been
provided to support this notion in mitochondria. To further elucidate the molecular evolution and biological

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/10

roles of HTR arrays in halibut mitochondrial genomes,
investigations of the distribution and variation of arrays
among different tissues and at different developmental
stages should be performed. Studying array variability of
mother and progeny would be of particular interest in
order to identify possible DNA recombination events. The
well studied example of similar RS5 arrays in mitochondria of European rabbits provides an interesting model
system for such analyses [27,37-39].

Conclusion
Unusual molecular features of halibut mitochondrial
genomes are located in the control region. Extensive size
heteroplasmy was detected in Atlantic-, Pacific-, and
Greenland halibut mitochondrial control regions. Heteroplasmic tandem repeat arrays contain different variants
of a 61-bp motif in compound organization. We conclude
that the most plausible explanation for array maintenance
includes both slipped-strand mispairing and DNA recombination mechanisms.

Methods
Fish samples and DNA extraction
Key-features of fish samples and mitochondrial DNA
sequences used in this study are listed in Table 1. Of the
30 additional Atlantic halibut specimens obtained from a
halibut hatchery at Bodø University College, 15 were wild
caught (Northern Norway) and 15 were farmed progenies
from the hatchery. DNA was extracted from muscle tissue
and fin clip by using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche).
PCR amplification, cloning, DNA sequencing, and data
analysis
Specific primer sets consisting of one heavy (H) and one
light (L) strand primer (Additional file 1) were used to
amplify the complete halibut mitochondrial genomes in
five overlapping fragments (L466/H3978, L3851/H7461,
L7109/H10004, L9620/H13706, and L12991/H530). In
general, the PCR reactions were performed with the following cycling parameters: 94°C initial denaturation for 3
min, 15 cycles with 94°C denaturation for 60 sec, 48°C
annealing for 60 sec, 72°C elongation for 4 min. Then, 15
cycles with 94°C denaturation for 60 sec, 53°C annealing
for 60 sec, 72°C elongation for 4 min and finally 72°C for
10 min. Products were run on agarose gels containing
ethidium bromide, and bands were excised and purified
essentially as previously described [11]. When appropriate, PCR products were inserted into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed in E. coli competent
cells. PCR products were sequenced on both strands by
using the BigDye version 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems)
with the same primers as in the PCR and internal primers
(Additional file 1). The sequencing products were analysed on an ABI genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems). In
