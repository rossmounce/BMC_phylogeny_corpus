Abstract
Background: The mollicute Mycoplasma conjunctivae is the etiological agent leading to infectious
keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) in domestic sheep and wild caprinae. Although this pathogen is relatively
benign for domestic animals treated by antibiotics, it can lead wild animals to blindness and death.
This is a major cause of death in the protected species in the Alps (e.g., Capra ibex, Rupicapra
rupicapra).
Methods: The genome was sequenced using a combined technique of GS-FLX (454) and Sanger
sequencing, and annotated by an automatic pipeline that we designed using several tools
interconnected via PERL scripts. The resulting annotations are stored in a MySQL database.
Results: The annotated sequence is deposited in the EMBL database (FM864216) and uploaded
into the mollicutes database MolliGen http://cbi.labri.fr/outils/molligen/ allowing for comparative
genomics.
Conclusion: We show that our automatic pipeline allows for annotating a complete mycoplasma
genome and present several examples of analysis in search for biological targets (e.g., pathogenic
proteins).

Background
Mycoplasmas (class Mollicutes) are among the smallest
microorganisms capable of self-replication and autonomous life [1]. The genus Mycoplasma includes a large

number of highly genomically-reduced species which in
nature are associated with hosts either commensally or
pathogenically [2]. General features of the class Mollicutes
are small genome, lack of cell wall and low GC content.

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 6):S7

Indeed, the Mycoplasma species have genomes of 0.6 to
1.3 Mbp. Weisburg et al. (1989) [3] and Woese et al.
(1980) [4] revealed that Mycoplasma have evolved from
more classical bacteria of the firmicutes taxon by a socalled regressive evolution that resulted in massive
genome reduction [5] and minimal metabolic activities.
Consequently, they adopted a strict parasitic life style,
mainly occurring as extracellular parasites often restricted
to a living host, with some species having the ability to
invade host cells as described by Sirand-Pugnet et al.
(2007) [5], Rosengarten et al. (2000) [6] and Citti et al.
(2005) [7]. They have a predilection for the mucosal surfaces, where they successfully compete for nutrients with
many other organisms, establishing chronic infections
[5]. They do not show specific virulence factor as known
in other bacteria, instead they seem to use toxic metabolic
intermediates that they secrete and translocate to the host
cells as virulence factors [8]. Additionally, due to the lack
of cell wall, they are not affected by some antibiotics
which target synthesis of cell wall such penicillin or other
beta-lactam antibiotics making these organisms particularly interesting in medicine.
Infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC)
Mycoplasma conjunctivae is considered as the major etiological agent of Infectious KeratoConjunctivitis (IKC) for
both domestic and wild caprinae species. In the European
Alps it affects several species such as alpine ibex (Capra
ibex ibex), alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra),
and mouflon (Ovis orientalis musimon), as well as in
domestic sheep and goat [9]. In Switzerland, M. conjunctivae is known to be the primary cause of this disease [10].

The implied role of M. conjunctivae is based on the frequent isolation of this organism from inflamed eyes and
on limited attempts to induce ocular disease experimentally showing that M. conjunctivae is one agent responsible
for epidemic keratoconjunctivitis [11]. Nonetheless, even
if the molecular epidemiology has been well described by
Belloy et al. (2003) [9], the molecular infection mechanism is still not established and remains a mystery.

Methods
Bacterial strain
M. conjunctivae type strain HRC/581T (NCTC10147) [12]
was grown on standard mycoplasma broth medium
enriched with 20% horse serum, 2.5% yeast extract and
1% glucose (Axcell Biotechnologies). The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min, washed
three times in TES buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
0.8% NaCl, pH 7.5), and then re-suspended in TES buffer
to a concentration of approximately 109 bacteria/ml.
DNA was extracted by the guanidium thiocyanate method
[13], extracted 3 times with PCIA (Phenol: CHCl3: Isoamylalcohol = 49.5: 49.5: 1) and 3 times with CIA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S6/S7

(CHCl3: Isoamylalcohol = 99: 1), precipitated with 50%
isoproanol, washed 2 times with 70% ethanol to remove
salt, dried in the air for 15 min and re-suspended in double distilled H2O at a concentration of 500 μg/ml.
Sequencing
Sequencing and assembly of the genome was carried out
by Microsynth AG. The quality of the isolated genomic
DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis and displayed a
pure high molecular weight DNA. The DNA was sheared
by passing it several times through a needle, in order to
construct two different libraries: a plasmid library and a
fosmid library. For the plasmid library (2–12 Kbp inserts),
the genomic DNA was passed 30 times through a 30Gauge needle and sonicated for 10 seconds (sonication
strength 3 on a Digital Sonifier 450 from Branson Ultrasonics corp, Danbury, CT, USA). For the fosmid library
(32 Kbp inserts), the genomic DNA was passed 10 times
through a 23-Gauge needle without sonication.

Small fragments were ligated with a linker, fractionated
twice through 0.8% agarose gels. Fractions of 6 different
sizes (from 2 to 12 Kbp) were cut out from the gel and
cloned into vector pOTW12 (Sanger Institute). Moreover,
the large fragments were fractionated using a CHEF-DR II
System (BIORAD). Fragments of 32 Kbp were cut out
from the gel and ligated into pCC1Fos (Epicentre Biotechnology Inc.).
From the plasmid library 11'300 clones and from the fosmid library 384 clones were end-sequenced on an ABI
3730 capillary sequencer. A second part of the small fragments were sequenced using 454 Life Science FLX technology leading to 263'163 reads that were reduced to 78'498
reads covering 20'569'079 bp after applying a quality cutoff filter (approx. 22× coverage).
Assembly
The assembly was carried out using the SeqMan module
of the DNASTAR Lasergene version 7 combining both
classical Sanger sequences (ABI3730) and 454 FLX reads.
A check was conducted with "amosvalidator" of the
AMOS package [14], allowing identifying suspicious
regions in the assembly. To help in the assembly process
the 384 fosmids paired-end reads were aligned to the final
sequence. The reads display a nice spreading at regular
intervals except for 2 clones that were absent from the
results. The 2 regions were analyzed for the presence of
potentially lethal genes for E. coli. The first region contains
a homologue of the gene lepA that is known to be lethal
when overexpressed in E. coli [15]. This region also contains a restriction enzyme that might cut E. coli genome.
The second region contains a transposase and some phage
genes. This might explain the toxicity of these two fosmids
in E. coli.

Automatic annotation
The automatic annotation pipeline was entirely built
locally using available software and linking them with
Perl scripts.

Gene prediction was carried out using Glimmer 3.02 [16]
and the genetic code specific for Mycoplasma (e.g., UGA
encodes a tryptophane). The interpolated context models
(ICM) were calculated by self-training on the long ORFs of
the contigs. The RNAs were predicted using Infernal with
models obtained from RFAM [17], tRNAscan-SE [18], and
blastn for 16S and 23S [19].
Predicted coding sequences (CDS) were translated using
the EMBOSS package (extractseq, transeq, revseq) [20]
and a similarity search was run by blastp against the UniProt/Swiss-Prot knowledgebase (Release 56.2 of 23-Sep2008: 398181 entries) [21]. The CDS were also scanned
against the HAMAP families [22] to identify orthologous
protein families. In addition the CDS were searched for
potential known domains using InterProScan [23], and
for biased compositional regions with SEG [24] and Marcoil [25].
The biological interest of an annotation project is to identify the gene products by designating a descriptive common name for the protein and its function with as much
specificity as the evidence supports. We use homologybased annotation transfer to assign the name and associated information of gene product: Gene symbol, EC
number if protein is identified as an enzyme and other
features.
Homology search is performed by blastp that allows finding the best matches with the highest significant sequence
similarity appearing between the putative proteins
sequences compared first to a database of known mycoplasma proteins and secondly to proteins from the UniProt/Swiss-Prot knowledgebase. Additionally, matches
with HAMAP protein family permits to support homology
annotation and raise the confidence level of annotation

transfer. Other characterization features like functional
domains constitute an additional support evidence of
function assignment (Table 1). The results obtained from
the various programs are parsed and stored in GFF3 format in a local MySQL database. The EMBL format is produced from the data stored in this database and deposited
at the EBI EMBL database, the accession number is
FM864216.
In order to assess the confidence of the results provided by
our annotation pipeline, we used the known genome of
Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (strain 232) already annotated
(NCBI entry AE017332) for comparing pipeline results
with those provided at NCBI. The annotation pipeline
identifies 741 CDS and 32 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)
whereas only 691 CDS and 36 ncRNAS are known. The
91.1% of total genes were correctly predicted leaving only
23 genes not found by the predictor programs. Regarding
the functional annotation, our pipeline provides 83.7% of
correct gene annotations and even in some cases complements the existing one. 7.4% of CDS are wrongly annotated or in a different way. The 69 genes predicted in
addition to known genes could be considered as false positives even if they also could represent new potential genes
of M. hyopneumoniae genome (Table 2). Using results of
M. hyopneumoniae 232 annotation, we evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of the pipeline and obtained a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 90% (Table 3).

Results
General genome features
Composition and functional gene assignment, origin of replication
The genome consists of a single chromosome with a size
estimated of about 0.9 Mbp. Currently, more than 95% of
the genome is available as a single contig, but due to the
presence of repeated sequences, we experienced difficulties in assembling the sequences to close the gap. The contig has a size of 846'214 bp with a G+C content of 29%
(Figure 1).

* CDS were predicted using Glimmer3 and ncRNAs were predicted using Blastn for 23S and 16S rRNAs, tRNAScan-SE for tRNAs and Infernal for
other ncRNAs

A total of 734 genes have been computationally predicted.
We found both 23S and 16S ribosomal RNAs in unique
copies located next to each other. The 5S ribosomal RNA
is located remotely of 23S and 16S genes. We identified 28
transfer RNAs covering all 20 amino acids. Other noncoding RNAs were found: bacterial RNase P class B, TPP
riboswitch (THI element), tmRNA (proteolysis signal)
and the bacterial signal recognition particle RNA.
Additionally, 699 genes were predicted as coding
sequences for proteins. 49% of those genes have a clear
homologue with a known function. 5.6% of those genes
were annotated as "putative proteins" because the closest
known protein was aligned with a marginal e-value. While
the remaining 45% have unknown function, and were
named as "hypothetical" proteins. From those hypothetical proteins, 75% matched non-significatively to other
proteins and 25% are considered unique for M. conjunctivae because no match was obtained by blastp against both
databases. A summary is shown in Table 4 and Table 5.
It is important to note that our method (homology based
annotation) does not allow to distinguish between close
homologues having different functions.
The origin of replication (oriC) was searched by comparing the sequences of 3 strains of M. hyopneumoniae with
the sequence of M. conjunctivae in the region of dnaA gene
(Figure 2). We attempted to identify several features that
have been associated with replication origins in other bacterial species, including mollicutes. Bacterial origins of
replication are typically located in the vicinity of the dnaA
and dnaN genes. Usually several dnaA-box motifs are
found within the intergenic regions around dnaA gene
[26]. We searched unsuccessfully for the presence of con-

sensus dnaA-box motifs with the pattern TTATC [CA]A
[CA] using fuzznuc of the EMBOSS package [27]. When
we used a slightly different, more relaxed dnaA-box consensus motifs TT [AT] [AC] [ACT]A [AC]A, two sequences
matching each of these patterns were found between the
dnaA and rpmH genes (Figure 2). However, well over
3,000 hits located throughout the rest of the genome were
also seen. Therefore, the specificity of the pattern used to
try to detect dnaA-box motifs was very low, decreasing our
confidence in the significance of the sequences identified.
These findings are in contrast to the multiple dnaA-boxes
found in the intergenic regions surrounding dnaA in other
mollicutes [26]. In addition to the presence of dnaA-box
motifs, replication origins can also frequently be identified by looking for biases in strand composition through
measures such as the cumulative GC skew [28-30]. For M.
conjunctivae, we found no significant asymmetries that can
be readily detected with GC skew. The lack of a clear bias
in M. conjunctivae is similar to that observed for the M.
hyopneumoniae [31]. Therefore, the only significant feature
of the M. conjunctivae genome that provides any possible
indication of the location of the origin of replication is the
presence of the dnaA gene. Otherwise, there are no features that allow definitive mapping of the origin to the
intergenic region upstream of the dnaA gene, as seen in
other bacteria.
Potential pathogenic features
Bacteria have many ways to produce virulence that reside
in the ability to adhere, invade and cause damage to host
cells. Various strategies of pathogenicity such as
cytolysins, toxins and invasins enable other bacteria to
produce infection. In Mycoplasma species no such typical
primary virulence genes have been found. Mycoplasmas

seem rather to use intrinsic metabolic and catabolic functions to cause disease in the affected host and to ensure
the microbe's survival. Our efforts to identify genes
involved in the pathogenicity of Mycoplasma conjunctivae
were concentrated on the one hand, try to find those primary virulence genes, toxins principally, rare in other
mycoplasmas. On the other hand, on metabolic pathways
that has been proposed by studies carried out in other
mycoplasmas [8].
Glycerol pathway
We found using manual blastp queries by an expert, the
genes for a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpO), a
glycerol kinase (glpK), a glycerol uptake facilitator protein
(glpF) and an ABC transporter system (Sn-glycerol-3phosphate transport system permease) that are implicated
in the glycerol metabolism producing cell damage,
inflammation and disease in Mycoplasma mycoides subsp.
mycoides Small Colony (SC) [8].

The pathway starts with the assimilation of glycerol by the
ABC glycerol transporter (gtsA, gtsB and gtsC). Afterwards,
the glycerol is phosphorylated into glycerol-3-phosphate,
then oxidized by GlpO in presence of O2 into dihydroxyactone-phosphate (DHAP) producing one molecule of
H2O2. H2O2 is released directly inside the host cells by the
transmembrane GlpO protein leading to cell death [8].
The absence of any gene having a catalase or dismutase
activity favors this hypothesis.
The identification of those genes in Mycoplasma conjunctivae constitutes an important discovery given that a relationship between the glycerol metabolism and
cytotoxicity is established in the laboratory[8]. Further
work to validate this hypothesis in M. conjunctivae is
required and has been started in collaboration with a laboratory of the Institute for Veterinary Bacteriology (University of Bern).
Toxins
Toxins constitute an important type of virulence factors in
several bacteria. Thereby, we searched for toxins in M. conjunctivae and we found 3 proteins highly similar with toxins
of
Treponema
hyodysenteriae
(Brachyspira
hyodysenteriae). Those proteins are Hemolysin A (hlyA),
Hemolysin B (hlyB) and Hemolysin C (hlyC). The 3 genes
are scattered on the genome.

Those proteins are present in other mycoplasmas, particularly M. hyopneumoniae and M. capricolum, and even if in
those species, these toxins are not essential for pathogenicity mechanisms, it can not be excluded that these
toxins contribute to the pathogenicity of M. conjunctivae.

IS elements
Insertion sequences (IS) are short DNA elements that
function as simple transposable elements by coding for
proteins implicated in the transposition activity. Transposase and other regulatory protein are the proteins generally coded by IS elements: The transposase catalyses the
enzymatic reaction allowing the IS to move. Regulatory
proteins act by enhancing or inhibiting the transposition
activity. The coding region in an insertion sequence is usually flanked by inverted repeats [32].

We found several genes coding for complete or partial
transposases (Table 6). An IS1138 insertion element has
particularly brought our attention. IS1138 elements
belong to IS3 family are prevalent in other mycoplasmas
and are the only (with IS1138b) that have been demonstrated directly to undergo autonomous transposition
[32,33]. Interestingly a transposase for one IS1138 insertion elements is followed by homologues of a methylase
HpaI and a type II restriction enzyme HpaI from Haemophilus parainfluenzae forming a restriction-methylation
cassette. The hypothesis of a horizontal transfer from H.
parainfluenza to M. conjunctivae was formulated. We evaluated the G+C content of this cassette, but we did not
observe a higher G+C content inside the cassette compared to the surrounding area. If the G+C content inside
the cassette would be different from that of M. conjunctivae
(29%) and similar to that of H. parainfluenzae (~41%) it
could constitute an evidence of the transfer.

Comparative genomics
The list of proteins was classified and compared to 4 other
mycoplasma genomes as shown in Table 7. The main difference with other mycoplasma is an apparently low carbohydrate and transport metabolism that could explain
the need for a strong glycerol pathway, as well as the large
number of hypothetical proteins probably due to the fully
automatic annotation process.

Discussion
Mycoplasma conjunctivae is the fourteenth genome of a
mycoplasma species that has been fully sequenced. Phylogenetically, the closest relative among the sequenced
mycoplasmas is M. hyopneumoniae reflected by the high
similarity of most of the proteins identified in M. conjunctivae.
The analysis of M. conjunctivae genome features,
describes this organism as a typical mycoplasma, with a
genome size and a G+C content within the range of other
mycoplasma genomes. The comparison of mycoplasma
genome sizes demonstrates that the sequence length is
variable not only within the same genus but even among
strains of the same species as shown in Table 8. Even if we
do not know the final size of the genome, we expect a
chromosome length of about 900'000 bp, size almost
similar with the genome size of M. hyopneumoniae.
Globally the mycoplasma genomes have a characteristically low G+C content within the range of 23.8 to 40
mol% (Table 8). The highest G+C content found in M.

pneumoniae and the lowest in M. capricolum. Regarding
Mycoplasma conjunctivae, G+C content has a typical value
of about 29%. The codon usage is similar to that of M.
hyopneumoniae and opposite to that of M. capricolum and
M. mycoides [31,34,35].
The presence of repeats across the genome was the principal difficulty for finishing the genome assembly. Insertion
sequence (IS) elements are reported in the majority of
mycoplasmas and in M. conjunctivae we found transposases for IS-elements in the genome. Some of those
transposases genes are complete sequences and some
other are fragmented showing a predicted length of less

than 1000 bp. Since those insertion elements are nearly
identical they created difficulties for assembling the
genome.
The findings highlighted by this project, principally the
glycerol pathway, require further experimental confirmation. In particular, the hypothesis for damaging the host
cells by the glycerol metabolism need to be confirmed by
demonstrating the localization of GlpO in the membrane
and the release of H2O2 outside the cell. If this hypothesis
can be verified, the possibility to block at any stage the
glycerol pathway could constitute a candidate target for
controlling the disease.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we created an automatic pipeline to annotate a prokaryotic genome sequence using various tools
for the prediction and the identification of the genes. This
pipeline is customized for handling sequences of mycoplasma species.

We deposited the Mycoplasma conjunctivae genome fully
annotated in the EMBL database (FM864216). Data
stored into our local database can be searched and
genome can be visualized through our website http://
myconj.vital-it.ch. Analysis of annotated genes gives new
insights about potential mechanisms of pathogenicity as
well as the possibility to go deeper into the knowledge of
Mycoplasma conjunctivae and the IKC disease and opens
the way to finding methods to prevent M. conjunctivae
infections of domestic animals as reservoir for this pathogen and hence prevent IKC in wild animals.
