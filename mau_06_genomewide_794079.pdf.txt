Results: Here we report a genome-wide assessment of homologous recombination among a
collection of six complete Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri genome sequences. We construct a
whole-genome multiple alignment and identify clusters of polymorphic sites that exhibit atypical
patterns of nucleotide substitution using a random walk-based method. The analysis reveals one
large segment (approximately 100 kb) and 186 smaller clusters of single base pair differences that
suggest lateral exchange between lineages. These clusters include portions of 10% of the 3,100
genes conserved in six genomes. Statistical analysis of the functional roles of these genes reveals
that several classes of genes are over-represented, including those involved in recombination,
transport and motility.

Background: Comparisons of complete bacterial genomes reveal evidence of lateral transfer of
DNA across otherwise clonally diverging lineages. Some lateral transfer events result in acquisition
of novel genomic segments and are easily detected through genome comparison. Other more
subtle lateral transfers involve homologous recombination events that result in substitution of
alleles within conserved genomic regions. This type of event is observed infrequently among
distantly related organisms. It is reported to be more common within species, but the frequency
has been difficult to quantify since the sequences under comparison tend to have relatively few
polymorphic sites.

The role of lateral gene transfer (LGT) in shaping prokaryotic
genomes has been the subject of intense investigation and
debate in recent years [1-10]. In the pre-genomic era, the

handful of examples of LGT were detected primarily as discordance between phylogenetic reconstructions with different housekeeping genes [11-14]. The explosion of publicly
available bacterial genome sequences, coupled with the

development of whole-genome comparison tools [15-17], initially focused LGT discovery on genome-wide scans for
islands of sequences specific to particular lineages of bacteria
(for example, [18-21]). Most recently, phylogenetic
approaches are applied to detect LGT among genome-wide
sets of putative orthologs [2,9,10]. Together, these studies
point to low, but detectable, levels of LGT among distantly
related species with occasionally higher rates found among
organisms that occupy similar environments. Closely related
organisms show higher levels of LGT, with intraspecific comparisons showing the highest levels. Two limitations of these
analyses are the lack of phylogenetic resolution, particularly
among intraspecific comparisons, and the reliance on annotated boundaries of genes in delineating candidate regions.
Statistical and phylogenetic methods have been developed for
detecting recombination in aligned sequences of single genes
or relatively short genomic segments. One general approach,
referred to as nucleotide substitution distribution methods in
[22], assesses atypical clusters of nucleotide differences.
Clusters come in two flavors: groups of polymorphisms
exhibiting the same topologically discordant pattern [23,24],
or an elevated rate of mutation in a single lineage across a segment of the alignment [25-28]. The former indicates recombination between compared strains, while the latter implies a
recombination with some unknown, more divergent, strain.
Phylogenetic methods are most often applied in the context of
detecting recombination break points in sequence alignments
[29-32]. These methods require longer alignments, are computationally intensive, and have reportedly been outperformed by substitution distribution methods on simulated
test data [33].
Genome-scale analyses of lateral transfer events have typically relied on identification of incongruent tree topologies
from phylogenetic analyses of sets of putative orthologous
genes identified by reciprocal BLAST analyses [7,9,34]. This
approach can be confounded by errors associated with
BLAST, such as false-positive orthologs, is limited to identifying recombination events that occur within gene boundaries,
and is unlikely to identify short recombined regions within
genes.
Recently, a Markov clustering algorithm was used to partition
orthologous pairs of genes, determined by an all versus all
BLAST comparison of 144 fully sequenced prokaryotic
genomes, into maximally representative clusters [10,35].
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (for example, [36,37]) was
applied to each cluster of four or more taxa to infer lateral
gene transfer against the background of a consensus 'supertree' of sequenced bacteria. This approach is most successful
in determining global pathways of gene transfer between
phyla and divisions of prokaryotes, where homologous
recombination is unlikely to have played a significant role.
Rather, these likely arise as illegitimate recombination
events.

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/5/R44

Here, we develop a method to detect segments of closely
related genomes that have been replaced with a homologous
copy from another conspecific lineage, that is, an allelic substitution. The method is not designed to detect non-homologous sequences that may have accompanied a homologous
recombination event or homologous recombination events
involving identical alleles.
The method compiles a list of polymorphism sites from a
whole-genome multiple alignment, then applies score functions to locate clusters discordant with the predominant phylogenetic signal. Identified clusters can cross gene boundaries
and non-coding sequence. Our use of extreme value theory
furnishes us with a statistically defensible criterion to assess
significance of these clusters in much the same manner as the
Karlin-Altschul statistics help interpret BLAST results
[38,39].
We apply the recombination detection method to the published genome sequences of several E. coli [18,40-44]. Construction of a multiple whole genome alignment facilitates a
global survey of recombination among these E. coli isolates.
Genome sequences must first be partitioned into locally collinear blocks (LCBs) - regions without rearrangement. Most
LCBs contain lineage-specific sequence acquired through lateral gene transfer or differential gene loss. To further complicate matters, non-homologous sequences from different
organisms can integrate into different lineages at a common
locus [18]. In a previous work, we developed a software package called Mauve [17] that can construct global multiple
genome alignments in the presence of rearrangement and lineage-specific content. The Mauve alignments provide a convenient starting point for locating polymorphic patterns
indicative of intraspecific recombination, which we call allelic
substitution.

Results

As seen in Figure 1, the Mauve genome aligner takes the four
E. coli and two Shigella flexneri genome sequences and
returns 34 local alignments spanning 3.4 Mb of homologous
sequence common to all strains. The majority of rearrangements occur in Shigella genomes where inversions between
copies of repetitive elements are relatively frequent [40].
Computer assisted screening of the Mauve output finds 733
problematic intervals inside LCBs in which base pairs do not
properly align because of gaps created by lineage specific
sequence and/or attempts to align non-homologous
sequence. Deleting these intervals from the alignment yields
130,008 high quality base pair differences. Common bipartitions, constituting 96.4% of all such differences, are listed in
Table 1.

We use the term 'single nucleotide difference' (SND) to
describe the partition structure at a variable site in the
alignment. A representative 100 base-pair (bp) segment of

the 3.4 Mb alignment is presented in Figure 2 for illustrative

information

Common single nucleotide differences have two alleles. Each such nucleotide difference separates the six genomes into two classes. Pattern codes
are represented as 6-tuples of ones and twos (for allele 1 and allele 2) in the following order: (K) E. coli K-12 MG1655, (O) E. coli O157:H7 EDL933,
(O) E. coli O157:H7 Sakai strain RIMD0509952, (C) E. coli CFT073, (S) Shigella flexneri 2A 301, and (S) Shigella flexneri 2A 2457T. By convention, K-12
is always allele one. For brevity, key groupings are denoted as KS, KO, or KC. The remaining 3.6% SNDs come in over 50 different patterns,
including one quadripartition. See appendix 1 in Additional data file 1 for additional frequencies.

Three excursions (KS, KO, and KC) spanning the alignment with K-12
MG1655 as reference genome. The KS random walk plot, representing the
dominant clonal topology, decreases more gradually than do the two
other plots. Excursions for the discordant topologies (patterns KO and
KC) run parallel to one another, except in a 100 kb region at 2 Mb where
KO abruptly increases. Parallel flat gaps common to all three plots reflect
K-12 lineage specific sequence.

All but 2% of variable sites are bi-allelic, meaning each site
splits six strains into two groups, called a bipartition. Nearly
80% of the bi-allelic SNDs have a minor allele unique to the
CFT, K-12, O157:H7, or S. flexneri lineage. The remaining biallelic SNDs divide the lineages into three alternative pairings
of sister taxa, giving rise to three alternative unrooted tree
topologies denoted as: ψKS (K-12 with S. flexneri, CFT with
O157:H7); ψKO (K-12 with O157:H7, CFT with S. flexneri); and
ψKC (K-12 with CFT, O157:H7 with S. flexneri).

We define three complementary score functions that discriminate between KS, KO, and KC patterns. Each of these score
functions assigns an integer value to each SND pattern. Moving across the chromosome of reference strain MG1655, we
keep a cumulative sum of the scores assigned by each function
to consecutive SNDs in the alignment. Graphical representations of cumulative scores, called random walk plots or excursions, can reveal large-scale variations in feature
composition. Excursions for each of the three topologies are
plotted concurrently in Figure 3.
A large phylogenetic anomaly appears midway through the
alignment. Magnification of a 100 kb segment between 1.95
and 2.1 Mb reveals a core 40 kb region in which KO SNDs are
the dominant pattern of substitution, flanked by transitional
regions for which ψKO serves as the 'gene tree' as well.
Global random walk plots highlight grossly deviant regions.
In this alignment, a solitary segment stands out. All other
regions appear indistinguishable from one another in Figure
3. Unless stated to the contrary, DNA sequence and genes
from the large atypical region (from sdiA to gnd) are excluded
from further computations (a separate analysis of this region
is included in Appendix 2 of Additional data file 1).

Local variation in phylogenetic signal
The four lineages serve as operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) in our study of allelic substitution in E. coli. When
nucleotides at a polymorphic site exhibit a partition structure
explainable by a single point mutation, the induced bipartition is said to be compatible with the enabling topology.
Bipartitions labeled KS, KO, and KC in Table 1 are compatible
with the topologies ψKS, ψKO, and ψKC, respectively. Note that
frequency of the KS pattern exceeds that of each of its competitors by 3,000 SNDs, thus certifying ψKS as the 'species' topology. The elevated frequency of SNDs unique to CFT roots
topology ψKS as (((KS)O)C). The 102,000 topologically unin-

In Figure 3, clusters of like patterns labeled KS, KC, or KO
generate tiny, imperceptible bumps in the corresponding random walk plots. Examined at higher resolution (data not
shown), they can be seen to punctuate each excursion. However, manual scanning of high-resolution random walk plots
is tedious, time consuming, and error-prone. In Materials
and methods, we describe an alternative strategy that automatically scans for clusters at the local level.
The score functions generating Figure 3 are designed to elicit
large positive local scores (differences in cumulative scores

age are not severe. We demonstrate in appendix 5 of Additional data file 1 that this is indeed the case for these six
genomes. Random SNDs can and do form clusters of identical
patterns simply by chance. Given the number of SNDs and
their relative frequencies within the alignment, we wish to
distinguish 'bumps' that are too large to have occurred by
chance.

refereed research

Our method relies on the relative intensity of particular SND
patterns (the one of interest versus all others) to measure
cluster formation, rather than the absolute number of SNDs
in any given fixed length segment of the alignment. As a
result, local mutational intensity is factored out of the analysis. We assert this is legitimate provided the overall rate of
mutation is not too great, and local deviations from that aver-

deposited research

We deviate from BLAST protocols in one important respect: a
high scoring segment maximizes the local score, which is the
primary goal of sequence alignment. Here, we want to isolate
sub-regions within an HSS that individually exceed the significance threshold. Our rationale is that sequence between subregions may not have participated in the recombination, and
we want to identify only those genomic intervals that possess
prima facie evidence of recombination.

reports

In the Materials and methods section, we apply the relevant
theory to derive thresholds. Using the appropriate extreme
value distribution as an arbiter, we chose a significance
threshold of 170 for clusters of KS SNDs and the same value
of 100 for both KO and KC, as their frequencies are nearly
identical outside the large atypical region (4.85% versus
4.57%). These thresholds define 186 high scoring segments
that span 7.5% of the sequence alignment. A breakdown by
pattern and range of scores is arrayed in Tables 2 and 3.

reviews

Here again, BLAST statistics [39] serve as the model for
assessing significance. Random walk theory provides the
tools for assessing high scoring segments, and the corresponding extreme value distributions (EVDs) guide selection
of appropriate thresholds. Random walks (as opposed to random walk plots) are stochastic processes operating under a
fixed set of probabilities at each stage.

When two lineages share a nucleotide that is not the result of
a single mutation in a common ancestor, a homoplasy is said
to have occurred. Homoplasies arise either through multiple
mutations at a common site (convergent evolution) or recombination. The former tend to be distributed randomly about
an alignment, whereas a recombination event typically produces a cluster of nucleotide differences at nearby sites exhibiting the same SND pattern. Our approach identifies such
clusters of nucleotide differences with a common phylogenetic partitioning pattern. Variability in mutation rates and
patterns in different chromosomal regions and bacterial lineages might also lead to physical clustering of similar substitutions. Although the clustering of sites with similar patterns
strongly suggests homologous recombination between lineages, we cannot rule out the possibility that some clusters
arise by independent mutation-driven processes. Simple
score functions alone cannot distinguish between these two
possibilities, though the latter is believed to be relatively rare.

evaluated at nearby positions) whenever clusters of like, topologically informative, patterns are encountered. When that
local score exceeds a predetermined threshold, the interval
between the delimiting SNDs is declared a high scoring segment (HSS). The strategy behind this scheme is exactly analogous to BLAST [38], in which high scoring segments denote
probable homology between the query and one or more reference sequences.

Figure local random walk plot showing homologous recombination in the tryptophan (trp) operon
The KS 4
The KS local random walk plot showing homologous recombination in the tryptophan (trp) operon. Genes are rectangular boxes positioned above or
below the axis based on transcribed strand. KS SNDs form two non-overlapping MSCs with significant local scores exceeding 170. Both MSCs, with a
combined length under 2 kb, are contained in a single 6.5 kb HSS covering most the trp operon. The positions of each KO, KC, and KS SND in E. coli K-12
are shown above the KS excursion. Random walk values below 50 are not plotted, resulting in the absence of visible KC or KO excursions.

A minimal significant cluster (MSC) is a smallest subset of
contiguous SNDs generating a local score above the threshold. To avoid ambiguity, overlapping MSCs supporting the
same topology are merged into a single representative MSC.
Most high scoring segments consist of a single such cluster,
but HSSs with more than 150 SNDs often contain two or more
disjoint MSCs.
HSSs and MSCs are represented graphically by modifying
global random walk plots. By subtracting off the underlying
negative trend, only positive local scores are displayed. Figure
4 shows a local random walk plot for the HSS covering the
seven genes of the tryptophan operon. The trp operon was the
first reported example of homologous recombination in E.
coli [45].
Although the entire trp operon may have been exchanged in a
single event, only trpA and trpE contain clusters of KS SNDs
that individually give rise to statistically significant local
scores. Moreover, the first MSC clearly includes in excess of
200 bp downstream of the trp operon - evidence that downstream transcription termination signals have also been subject to homologous recombination. In this manner, MSCs
facilitate more precise targeting of chromosomal regions
implicated in recombination. This criterion modestly
increases the number of recombined segments to 216 (75, 62,
79 for KO, KC, KS, respectively) while reducing the amount of
participating sequence from 251 kb to 129 kb. We outline a
procedure for finding non-overlapping minimal significant
clusters inside high scoring segments in Materials and
methods.

Gene content of regions that underwent recent allelic
substitution
Although our method identifies recombination events independently of gene boundaries, it is interesting to look at the
types of genes and gene products involved in these events. To
this end, we extracted a list of genes encoded in regions
deemed atypical by our random walks. Among the 4,353

genes in K-12, 3,107 align across all six genomes. Of these, 271
genes intersect a minimal cluster segment. When augmented
with 40 genes from the atypical region, 10% of shared genes
exhibit evidence of recombination. A table of the 186 high
scoring segments, subdivided into MSCs and identifying
affected genes, is provided as Additional data file 2.
We examined this list of 311 genes in light of gene function
assignments made using a controlled vocabulary called MultiFun [46] that supports multiple functional classifications
for a given gene. The 3,107 genes aligned by Mauve in all six
genomes have been classified with 5,550 gene functions.
Nearly 2,000 genes have a single classification (many are
'Unknown function'). By contrast, six genes have seven 'Level
2' functions. This analysis revealed an over-representation of
four categories and under-representation in seven others
(Table 4).
Highly conserved genes that encode components of the ribosome and genes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis show
little evidence of detectable recombination. Conversely, many
genes involved in motility and chemotaxis undergo allelic
substitution. Chemotaxis may also be related to elevated
recombination detected among genes encoding components
of phosphotransferase transport systems (PTSs) since these
genes can double as sensors for substrates such as glucose
and mannose [47].
Genes involved in basic processing of cellular information,
such as replication, transcription and translation, reveal an
unexpected dichotomy: genes dedicated to RNA and protein
metabolism are refractory to recombination, but genes
involved with DNA replication, repair and recombination
appear prone to allelic substitution. Equally surprising is a
bias favoring evident recombination among genes involved in
small molecule biosynthesis. Examples of biosynthetic genes
that support the pairings in topology ψKC include members of
the aromatic amino acid pathway (aroP, aroD, and aroG) as
well as the pyrimidine producing carB (also known as pyrA).

Mosaic operons and genes. Three of six rha genes (rhaB, rhaA, and rhaD) belong to an operon on the reverse strand. This operon is unusual because welldefined recombination events clearly fall within gene boundaries; rhaD contains two dense KC clusters, whereas rhaA and rhaB contain predominantly KS
and KO SNDs, respectively. In a nearby operon consisting of fdoG, fdoH, fdoI, and fdhE, there has been a KC intragenic recombination event with fdoG a
mosaic, resulting from two recombination events, one of which is shared with fdoH.

SND clusters supporting topology ψKO are present in pyrI,
pyrB, and several genes in the histidine operon. Finally,
purD, purF, leuDC, modABC, and two genes in the trp operon
(Figure 4) contain clusters compatible with the clonal topology, but at much higher intensity than elsewhere in the
genome.

Discussion

Natural transformation, transduction, and conjugation are
three mechanisms for transporting foreign DNA into the cell.
The relative contribution of each mechanism varies from
species to species. For example, transformation is the dominant mode of transfer in bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis and Helicobacter pylori that are naturally competent,
that is, able to absorb small pieces of naked DNA. As E. coli is
competent only under extreme conditions, typically in the
laboratory, it is expected that this form of transformation may
play a minor role in nature. Exogenous DNA can also enter via
phage transduction or conjugation, which are expected to be

information

Besides fdoG (shown in Figure 5), six other genes - polB,
mutS, speF, recG, actP, and yfaL - show evidence of mosaicism. Three of these genes - polB, mutS, and recG - are informational genes involved in DNA replication and repair. Each
mosaic gene contains two minimum significant clusters generated by different partition patterns. A closer inspection of

Other mosaic genes undoubtedly exist within these strains,
but their phylogenetic signal is too short or too weak to
register in a genome-wide scan. Full genome scans come at a
cost; one must sacrifice sensitivity to maintain specificity. At
present, we are content to underestimate the true amount of
recombination in order to eliminate false positives.

interactions

With over 216 recombined segments intersecting 271 genes,
this group of E. coli genomes is truly a patchwork of its constituent members. Although genes within the trp and his
operons contain multiple clusters of the same pattern (KS for
trp, KO for his), such uniformity across operons is atypical
[48]. Figure 5 shows a short stretch of aligned sequence containing two mosaic operons.

one of these genes, speF, suggests that all three phylogenetic
signals may be present, as shown in Figure 6.

the primary source of exogenous DNA for E. coli. Transducing
phages can deliver large fragments of genomic DNA from
their previous bacterial host into a recipient strain. DNA
transferred via conjugative mechanisms can be even larger.
The lengths of recombined segments reported in the previous
section are typically short. Half the intervals are shorter than
1 kb, and 80% are less than 2 kb. DNA fragments delivered by
transducing phages might be expected to be considerably
larger (30 to 60 kb). The size differential between entrance
and incorporation molecules has been partially reconciled by
experiments in which site-specific DNA was packaged into
phages and transduced into K-12 cells [49]. Screening for
recombinants in the proximity of the trp operon, the authors
found average replacement sizes to be in the 8 to 14 kb range.
Moreover, multiple replacements were detected in some
instances. In a follow-up paper [1], the level of sequence dissimilarity (from 1% to 3%) between recipient and donor
strains was shown to correlate with the degree of abridgement
by restriction endonucleases. The length of a typical recombinant in our study is still an order of magnitude less than that
reported by McKane and Milkman [49], but they based their
conclusions on restriction site analysis, which has a limited

ability to detect short fragments. Actual incorporations in
their experiments could conceivably have been more frequent
and shorter. Overlapping recombination events at particular
sites are also likely to contribute to the net reductions in
observed incorporation sizes.
Our approach detects significant clusters of phylogenetically
informative SNDs, but does not tell us which lineages
participated in the recombination. When presented with four
OTUs, recombination is possible between six undirected
donor-recipient pairs: KO, CS, KS, OC, KC, and OS. These
alternative histories can be jointly represented as a phylogenetic network (Figure 7).
For example, a high scoring KC segment indicates that the
donor and recipient lineages are either K-12 and CFT, or
O157:H7 and S. flexneri. Exactly which pair of lineages is
involved in the transfer can sometimes be determined by
examining the joint distribution of all seven SND patterns.
Recombinant activity in glyS and the four genes to its right is
illustrated in Figure 8.
The colored intervals in Figure 7 share a common feature: the
presence of topologically informative SNDs is accompanied
by the absence of SNDs from two paired sister taxa. For example, no 'O157 only' or 'Shigella only' SNDs are present in the
KC/OS interval inside glyS, strongly suggesting that the
O157:H7 and S. flexneri lineages were involved in the
transfer. The other two intervals coincide with gene boundaries. When viewed in isolation, the genes yiaA and yiaH
appear to be reasonable candidates for recombination. Yet
only the KC recombinant inside the glyS gene is detectable by
our whole genome significance thresholds.
Sequence divergence can reduce the likelihood that homologous recombination occurs between orthologous genes, but
does not address the underlying mechanisms that lead to
divergence in the presence of rampant recombination. The
restriction of different lineages of bacteria to distinct niches

The Mauve alignment tool produces an output file containing
separate alignments for each locally collinear block. Concatenation of LCBs results in a G × M matrix of nucleotides and
gap symbols, where G is the number of genomes and M is the
length of gapped alignments across all blocks. Each matrix
column represents one site in the consolidated alignment.
Restricting attention to columns containing at least one
nucleotide difference but no gaps results in a G × M' submatrix ∆ composed solely of single nucleotide differences.
Automated screening of the Mauve alignment (Figure 1) filtered out SNDs in regions of poor alignment quality, resulting
in a ∆ with dimension 6 by 130,008 (see Appendix 4 in Additional data file 1 for protocol employed).
Numerous scoring schemes have been devised to identify and
assess the statistical significance of molecular sequence features on a genomic scale [53,54]. One general approach calculates average scores within a sliding window (for example,
[55,56]). We use an equally versatile method that computes
cumulative scores based on a score function, evaluated at
each column of ∆ (see [39] for other applications).
Let Ξ = {KS, KC, KO} represent the three discordant SND patterns in Table 1, and let ψξ be the unrooted topology compatible with pattern ξ ∈ Ξ. We define three complementary score
functions on SNDs to filter conflicting phylogenetic signals:

Earlier comparisons of different E. coli strains [1,11,14,50]
found recombination among several distinct sets of genes.
The affected genes in these studies were not randomly
selected and may not have been representative of the shared
gene complement. Although our method surveys all genes,
the genomes we compared are heavily skewed towards
human pathogens. As additional E. coli strains are
sequenced, the role of homologous recombination in bacterial
genome evolution will become clearer, and may force
reassessment of traditional methods for describing relationships among bacterial taxa [8,51].

We demonstrate that the rate of intraspecies recombination
in E. coli is much higher than previously appreciated and may
show a bias for certain types of genes. The described method
provides high-specificity, conservative inference of past
recombination events.

could act to prevent gene flow, but in the case of E. coli and
Salmonella, the niches overlap. The barriers to exchange
might also reflect more active exclusion of foreign DNA by
mechanisms such as restriction enzyme expression. Perhaps
the most appealing explanation for the phenomenon would
invoke the activity of bacteriophages, transposons and conjugation-promoting elements as the key determinants of
recombinational potential between taxa. Given the propensity of these mobile elements to participate in genetic
exchange within species and their often narrow host ranges,
we might expect that they promote recombination within a
species but cannot transfer to more diverse organisms. The
lack of extensive recombination of orthologous sequences
between species may result from a competition between bacteria and phage that can activate rapid evolution of barriers to
phage infection. Our estimate for a higher rate of homologous
recombination among E. coli underscores the discrepancy
between rates of intraspecies recombination, which appear to
be quite common, and rates of recombination of orthologous
genes between species such as E. coli and Salmonella, which
appear to be much less frequent [2].

identify regions of interest. In the case of alignments, a high
score segment represents a likely sequence homology. A significant difference between our analysis and sequence alignment is that substitution matrices are empirically derived
from a test set (for example, PAM or BLOSUM). Here, D is not
a parameter in an underlying stochastic model of evolution,
but rather a tuning parameter in a diagnostic specifically
designed to detect recombination. The value D = 13 was
inspired by the observation that the most frequent topologically informative pattern, KS, has an observed frequency of
7.6%, approximately the reciprocal of 13. Alternative integer
values were tried and rejected.
Score functions generate high scoring segments whenever
they encounter a cluster of SND patterns supporting one
topology but are discordant with other choices. For a given
topology ψξ, we define Scoreξ(η) to take on positive values
when pattern η is ξ and negative values otherwise (η ≠ ξ,). As
discordant patterns are antithetical to one another, their
weights should be equal to but opposite from the one being
scanned. Neutral SND patterns are not individually disruptive to the underlying signal, but in aggregate they degrade
the signal. These non-informative patterns are downweighted and made integer-valued as in substitution
matrices.
Hence, a large local score - the equivalent of a high scoring
segment - is evidence for recombination between two of the
lineages paired by ξ (for example, ξ = KS associates K-12 with
S. flexneri and O157:H7 with CFT).
Random walk plots connect the dots' between partial sums
that are computed from SNDs as they occur in ∆. By contrast,
random walks are translation invariant stochastic processes
governed by the relative frequencies in ∆, irrespective of
order. We augment the random walk transition probabilities
with an additional 'terminator' state. Terminators break a
global alignment into several smaller sub-alignments, and are
used to represent alignment fragmentation caused by 'large'
gaps (>15 bp in one lineage), spurious alignments, or LCB
boundaries (Figure 1). Accordingly, for each ξ ∈ Ξ, random
walk increments are distributed according to the following
probabilities:

Since the expected value E(Xξ) < 0,∀ξ, sums of these identically distributed variables generate transient random walks.

form a strictly decreasing set of ladder points. Though Sk
depends on ξ, we suppress it for ease of exposition. The horizontal distances between consecutive ladder points: τk+1 - τk,
are called ladder epochs. The local record height (LRH) of the
kth epoch is defined by:
LRHk =

max {St − Sτ(k −1)} ≥ 0.

τk −1 ≤ t < τk

Ladder epochs measure the size of a high scoring segment in
SND units rather than base pairs (chain length M' versus M).
The number of ladder epochs in a random walk of size N is
denoted by Λ(N). The distribution of the maximum value in a
sequence of local record heights is an extreme value distribution (EVD) with parameterization:
Pr( max LRH j > x) = exp(− NKe −µx ) (equation 1)
j ≤ Λ( N )

Here µ is the positive solution of an equation involving the
moment generating function:
mgfξ ( … = ∑ j π j eµX

The value of µ is solved for numerically. For ψKC, the
equation:
mgfKC(µ) = 0.045e13µ + .124e-13µ + .826e-µ + .005e-100,000µ = 1
has a positive solution at µ = 0.1354 (µ = 0 is a trivial solution). The value of K can be computed as a rapidly converging
infinite sum (see appendix of [39]). We chose instead to simulate 2,000 random walks of size N = 10,000 using the

Ladder points, ladder epochs, and local record heights are
easily computed with a few simple R commands. Finding
minimal significant clusters - a smallest possible cluster of
SNDs with a significant score - is more challenging. A naïve
approach takes each SND within a high scoring segment as
the start of some local score, then iteratively adds successive
terms to local scores in parallel until one of the sums exceeds
the threshold. The SNDs producing that sum constitute the
first MSC. The process continues on the remaining sums to
seek out additional, non-overlapping MSCs. The algorithm is
O(n2) in the number of SNDs. Such a brute force approach
works here because alignment gaps split the problem into 186
small pieces, the largest of which contains fewer than 700
SNDs.

alignment size (M' = 129,000 after excluding the atypical
region) in each EVD. The densities of the three EVDs are plotted in Figure 9.
