Abstract
Background: Symbiotic relationships between intracellular bacteria and eukaryotes are
widespread in nature. Genome sequencing of the bacterial partner has provided a number of key
insights into the basis of these symbioses. A challenging aspect of sequencing symbiont genomes is
separating the bacteria from the host tissues. In the present study, we describe a simple method of
endosymbiont purification from complex environment, using Blattabacterium cuenoti inhabiting in
cockroaches as a model system.
Findings: B. cuenoti cells were successfully purified from the fat bodies of the cockroach Panesthia
angustipennis by a combination of slow- and fast-speed centrifugal fractionations, nylon-membrane
filtration, and centrifugation with Percoll solutions. We performed pulse-field electrophoresis,
diagnostic PCR and random sequencing of the shoutgun library. These experiments confirmed
minimal contamination of host and mitochondrial DNA. The genome size and the G+C content of
B. cuenoti were inferred to be 650 kb and 32.1 ± 7.6%, respectively.
Conclusion: The present study showed successful purification and characterization of the genome
of B. cuenoti. Our methodology should be applicable for future symbiont genome sequencing
projects. An advantage of the present purification method is that each step is easily performed with
ordinary microtubes and a microcentrifuge, and without DNase treatment.

Background
Many eukaryotes have developed symbiotic relationships
with bacterial endocytosymbionts [1,2]. These symbioses
typically involve provision of nutrients by the bacterial
partner to its host, and/or manipulation by the bacterial
partner of the hosts' reproductive system [3]. Prior to the

recent genomic revolution, details of their metabolism
and physiology of many of these bacteria remained
unknown, in part due to the difficulty of culturing these
bacteria. Genome analyses have provided a wealth of
information that will be crucial for elucidating the biology
of these endosymbionts. The focus has been on symbionts

in the phylum proteobacteria [4-13], although a few representatives of the other phyla have recently been
sequenced [14,15].
A challenging step in sequencing symbiont genomes is
purification of the bacterial cells. In some cases, bacterial
DNA that was directly extracted from accumulated bacteriocytes was pure enough for sequencing analyses [5,9].
However, in other cases, it was necessary to remove contaminated DNA derived from host nuclei and/or mitochondria. For example, purification of Blochmannia and
Wolbachia required the precise adjustment of treatment
conditions of DNase I in order to remove DNA of contaminated organelles [6,16]; failure of this treatment caused
complete digestion of the bacterial genome [16]. This
problem was avoided during purification of Buchnera
from aphids by use of Percoll-gradient centrifugation to
separate the bacterial cells from other organelles or cellular debris [17]. An elegant method was applied to purify
TG-1 bacteria from termite flagellates, where a single protozoan cell was manipulated and the posterior part of the
protist cell was manually ruptured to collect the specific
bacteria [15]. Additional examples of successful endosymbiont isolation from complex environments may facilitate
the study of other bacterial symbioses.
Almost all cockroaches harbour the bacterial endocytosymbiont Blattabacterium cuenoti (phylum Bacteriodetes,
class Flavobacteria) in mycetocytes of their fat bodies.
Molecular phylogenetic studies show this bacterium is
closely related to other Flavobacterial endosymbionts of
insects, in particular Sulcia muelleri from auchenorrhynchan insects and male-kiling symbionts from ladybird
beetles [18]. The Blattabacterium/cockroach symbiosis was
first discovered in the late 19th century [19]. These bacteria
have been co-evolving with cockroaches for at least 130
million years [20,21]. It has been proposed that the symbiosis is mediated by juvenile hormone secreted from corpora allata [22]. On the basis of extensive biochemical,
radiochemical, and antibiotic studies using normal and
aposymbiotic cockroaches, the relationship has been
shown to be one of obligate mutualism. The bacteria contribute to the nitrogen metabolism of their hosts by mobilizing the uric acid stored in the fat bodies when
cockroaches feed on nitrogen-poor diets [23,24]. The uricolysis is thought to be mediated by xanthine dehydrogenase rather than uricase [23], although further details for
this process have yet to be provided. In addition, the bacteria have been proposed to provide some essential amino
acids to cockroaches [25] and to be involved in sulphate
assimilation into sulphur amino acids [26]. These studies
were conducted based on comparisons between normal
and aposymbiotic insects, however, effects of the antimicrobial treatments on the intestinal bacterial diversity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/118

were not well assessed. Overall, the details of the interaction between the two partners have not yet been clarified.
Genomic or proteomic analyses are likely to greatly
enhance our understanding of B. cuenoti biology. Purification of B. cuenoti cells is the first step in this process. Purification of B. cuenoti is challenging for the following
reasons. First, the bacterial endosymbionts co-exist with
organelles and nuclei that have to be eliminated. Second,
in the fat body tissues, the mycetocyte is always surrounded by urocytes and trophocytes [27], which contain
a large amount of urates, lipids, and other intracellular
extra substances as well as usual organelles and nuclei. In
the present paper, we describe the first successful purification of the genomic DNA of the flavobacterial endosymbiont in cockroaches.

Methods
Host insects
Panesthia angustipennis were collected at Mt. Tsukuba in
Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. The cockroaches were reared
with wood chips and sliced pieces of fresh carrot at room
temperature.
Purification of B. cuenoti from cockroaches
All procedures were performed at 4°C unless otherwise
indicated. Two adult female individuals (6.5 g in total)
were dissected to remove the fat bodies. The collected fat
bodies were homogenized in 6 ml of a solution with the
following components: 41.2 mM sodium chloride, 10.2
mM sodium hydrogen carbonate, 5.7 mM trisodium citrate and 14.5 mM potassium dihydrogenphosphate, and
fixed in 2.5% formaldehyde for 2 h. The sample was centrifuged at 1700 × g for 40 min and the pellet was suspended in 2 ml of the same solution. The suspension was
centrifuged at 300 × g for 2 min to remove the precipitates.
The supernatant was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min
and the pellet was suspended in 1.5 ml of the same solution. This centrifugal step was repeated three times. The
final suspension was filtered through nylon membranes
of pore sizes 90 μm and 25 μm to remove the remaining
large debris. The filtrate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20
min and the pellet was suspended in 500 μl of the initial
solution. To separate the bacterial cells from mitochondria and the host nuclei, the suspension was overlaid on 5
ml of 30% Percoll solution (containing 5.5% PEG6000,
1.1% Ficoll, and 278 mM sucrose), which had been overlaid on 5 ml of 70% Percoll solution (containing 5%
PEG6000, 1% Ficoll, and 250 mM sucrose) in advance.
The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and
bacterial cells present between the 30% and 70% Percoll
phases were collected. Alternatively, 50 μl of the suspension was overlaid on 500 μl of the 30% Percoll solution
and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Pellet was sus-

pended in 50 μl of 0.2 μm filter-sterilized distilled water
and overlaid on 500 μl of the 70% Percoll solution. After
centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min, bacterial cells
remained on the 70% Percoll solution were collected. The
collected bacterial cells were washed with five volumes of
the initial solution or filter-sterilized distilled water and
centrifuged to form a bacterial pellet. An aliquot of the
bacterial cells was stained with DAPI (4',6'-diamidino-2phenylindole) and observed with an epifluorescence
microscope.
Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
Agarose embedded DNA (plug) was prepared using a
CHEF bacterial genomic DNA plug kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). The plug was extensively washed with TE and
treated with 200 U of the homing enzyme I-Ceu I (New
England Biolabs, Bevely, MA, USA) in 500 μl of 1 × digestion buffer (50 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM Tris-acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.9) to
linearize the genomic DNA by cutting the prokaryotic 23S
rRNA gene. The plug was briefly rinsed with 0.5% SDS in
0.5 × TBE (1 × TBE consists of 0.89 M Tris-HCl, 0.89 M
boric acid, and 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) and applied to
PFGE.

The plug was embedded in a contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) gel (1%) and the bacterial
DNA was run using a CHEF-DRII system (Bio-Rad) at 10–
15°C. The electrophoresis was carried out with a pulse
switching time of every 60 s over 15 h, then every 90 s over
9 h in 0.5 × TBE (as running buffer) at 200 V (6 V/cm). To
check the presence or absence of DNA fragments less than
250 kb in length, electrophoresis was performed with
gradual increase of the pulse switching time from 30 s to
90 s over 24 h at 150 V. The presence or absence of DNA
fragments less than 10 kb was checked by conventional
electrophoresis with a 1% agarose gel. The gels were
stained with ethidium bromide and observed on a UV
trans-illuminator.
To confirm the genome size, the plug was treated with 200
U of the restriction enzyme Ksp I (= Sac II or Sst II) (Roche,
Penzberg, Germany) in 500 μl of 1 × digestion buffer (10
mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM magnesium chloride, and 1 mM
dithioerythritol, pH 7.5). Pulse-Field electrophoresis was
performed at 6 V/cm using ramped pulse times from 5 to
20 s for 18 h, followed by a pulse switching time of every
60 s over 15 h, then every 90 s over 6 h in 0.5 × TBE.
DNA purification and diagnostic PCR
To check if the DNA band actually originated from the
purified B. cuenoti, the band was excised from the gel and
washed with 1 × β-Agarase I Reaction Buffer (10 mM Bis
Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 6.5) (New England Biolabs).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/1/118

The agarose block containing the DNA band was completely melted at 90°C and was cooled to 50°C. Then, βAgarase I (New England Biolabs) was added to be 20 U/
ml and the sample was incubated at 45°C for 1 h. The bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using a conventional
phenol/chloroform method [28]. The genomic DNA collected with ethanol precipitation was dissolved in 50 μl of
sterilized distilled water, which was used as PCR template.
Diagnostic PCR was performed using forward (5'-GAT
GGC GAC CGG CGT ACG GGT GCG-3', positions corresponding to 45-68 of Genbank AB231604) and reverse
(5'-TAC ACC ACA CAT TCC AGC TAC TCC-3', positions
corresponding to 641-618 of AB231604) primers specific
for 16S rDNA of B. cuenoti, A-tLEU and B-tLYS [29] specific for mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II, and newly
designed forward (5'-AAA TTA CCC ACT CCC GGC AC-3',
positions corresponding to 3-22 of Genbank AB036190)
and reverse (5'-TGG TGC CCT TCC GTC AAT TC-3', positions corresponding to 829-810 of AB036190) primers
specific for 18S rDNA of P. angustipennis, respectively. The
temperature regimen for 30 cycles was 94°C for 30 s,
52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. The amplified fragment size was confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Amplification of the whole genome and construction of
shotgun library
To obtain the sufficient amount of DNA, the total
genomic DNA extracted from the CHEF gel was amplified
with a proofreading phi29 DNA polymerase using a
GenomiPhi DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The shotgun library (~2 kb) was constructed with a modification of the previous method [5].
Briefly, the amplified DNA was hydrodynamically cut (~2
kb) with the hydroshear DNA shearer (Digilab Genomic
Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). The fragmented DNA was
treated with DNA polymerase I and blunt-ended with T4
DNA polymerase. After conventional agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA fragments were excised from the gel at the
area of 2 kb in size and purified. The obtained DNA fragments were ligated at the Hinc II site of phospholylated
pUC118 plasmid vector and transformed into Escherichia
coli DH10B. 96 clones were randomly selected and onepass sequences were determined using an ABI 3700
sequencer.

Results and discussion
Development of the purification method of B. cuenoti
cells
A challenge in genomic analyses of bacterial endosymbionts is purification of bacterial cells. Thus, we aimed to
develop a simple purification method for endocytosymbionts from a complex environment. Unlike the case for
some insects, it is not possible to manually isolate bacte-

riocytes from the fat bodies of cockroaches. Thus, we
employed four purification steps to obtain the pure B. cuenoti. The first step was to collect only fat bodies from the
cockroaches by dissection. The structure of B. cuenoti cells
throughout the purification steps was aided by immediate
fixation of the fat body homogenate with paraformaldehyde. The second step was a combination of fast- and
slow-speed centrifugal fractionations to separate B. cuenoti
from larger and smaller cellular or cytosolic debris and
lipids. The third step was filtration of the centrifuged
homogenate with nylon membranes to eliminate remaining larger debris from the sample. However, these steps
did not separate the bacterial cells from mitochondria and
host nuclei. Therefore, to purify the bacterial cells without
DNase treatment, we initially tried Percoll gradient centrifugation based on the purification method of Buchnera
[17] as well as an autogradient formation with Percoll
using an ultracentrifuge. However, the bacterial band was
not formed in the gradient solutions. Instead of the gradient centrifugation, we employed a two-layered Percoll
centrifugation, where the concentrations of the ingredients in the Percoll solutions were precisely adjusted during preliminary experiments. This method eventually
resulted in a white band between the upper (30%) and
bottom (70%) Percoll layers (Fig. 1). Light microscopic
observation revealed that the purified sample consisted of
short bacterial rods with a slight contamination of small
particles (Fig. 2A). However, DAPI signals were only
detected from the short rods, thus contaminations of neither mitochondria nor nuclei were observed (Fig. 2B). The
short rods ranged in length from approximately 2 to 5 μm
and often formed binary fission pairs (Fig. 2B). These
morphologies are consistent with those of the previously
reported Blattabactterium [30,31], suggesting the successful purification of the endosymbiont. We also found that
the two-layered Percoll centrifugation was not mandatory.
Centrifugation with 30% Percoll solution in a microtube
followed by centrifugation with the 70% solution produced the same result as Fig. 2. Stepwise changes in the
concentration of the Percoll solutions with microtubes
may enable to this method to be applied to other endosymbionts living in similarly complex host environments.
Genome size estimation and purity confirmation
To achieve complete purification of the bacterial DNA, we
performed pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using
plugs prepared from the purified bacterial cells. If the
genome is circular, the DNA does not migrate smoothly in
CHEF gels during PFGE [16]. In the present study, linearization of the bacterial chromosome with an enzymatic
cleavage was necessary prior to electrophoresis. Although
we initially tried to digest the DNA with the restriction
enzyme Not I (that recognizes an 8-bp motif rich in G and
C), no bands were observed. Thus, we treated the bacterial
DNA with the homing endonuclease I-Ceu I, that cleaves

many prokaryotic 23S rRNA genes at only one specific site
[32]. Fig. 3 shows the electrophoretogram of the genomic
DNA from B. cuenoti. The electrophoresis resulted in only
one band; the absence of other bands was confirmed
under other PFGE conditions and conventional submarine electrophoresis. The results suggest that B. cuenoti
possesses only one copy of the ribosomal RNA gene complement (i.e. 5S, 16S, and 23S rDNAs) on a circular
genome, as is the case of the majority of other bacterial
endosymbionts (i.e. Buchnera spp., Blochmannia spp., and
Carsonella ruddii). The size of the bacterial genomic DNA
was estimated to be 650 kb by comparing its mobility
with chromosomal fragments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
on PFGE (Fig. 3). This result was further confirmed with
the other restriction enzymes, Ksp I, which produced two
fragments (see Additional file 1). No evidence for extrachromosomal plasmids was found.
To check the origin of the DNA band, PCR was performed
using primers specific for the B. cuenoti 16S rDNA, cock-

roach 18S rDNA, and mitochondrial COII. Contamination of mitochondrial or host nuclear DNA was
significantly removed from the sample collected after the
Percoll centrifugation and eventually not detected after
PFGE (Fig. 4). Since only a trace of amplification of contaminated DNA was detected without the Percoll centrifugation (Fig. 4B), PFGE separation of genomic DNA may
be only necessary when very pure DNA is required for further experiments.
So far, intracellular endosymbiont genome sequencing
projects have primarily focused on members of the proteobacteria phylum (Table 1). The genomes of these
endosymbionts range from 450 kb to 1.7 Mb (Table 1),
with the exception of the psyllids bacterial symbiont (160
kb) [9], the secondary flavobacterial endosymbiont of
sharpshooters (245 kb) [14], and the secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies (4.2 Mb) [33]. From comparisons with
their free-living relatives, it is widely accepted that the
intracellular symbionts have lost significant amounts of
genomic information since adopting the intracellular lifestyle [3]. Indeed, the secondary endosymbiont of tsetse
flies, Sodalis glossinidius, which was recently diverged from
a free-living ancestor, shows a large genome size (4.2 Mb)
and massive slow erosion at individual loci [33]. Free-living and parasitic relatives in Flavobacteria have genome
sizes ranging from 2.7 to 6 Mb (Table 1), compared with
650 kb for B. cuenoti. Thus B. cuenoti is likely to have lost
a significant number of genes since its ancestors first
entered into a symbiotic relationship with insects. The
present study is the second demonstration of a Bacteroidetes symbiont with a reduced genome, the first being
Sulcia muelleri (245 kb) [14]. While B. cuenoti is a primary
symbiont, S. muelleri co-inhabits sharpshooter cells with
the primary endosymbiont Baumannia cicadellinicola [14].
Very recently, the small genome (1.1 Mb) of a bacterial
endosymbiont (phylum TG-1) of termite flagellates has
been determined [15]. In addition, similar genome reduction has also been reported from commensal and parasitic
microbes such as those belonging to chlamydiae, rickettsiae, and mollicutes [34,35]. These findings strongly suggest evolutionary plasticity of bacterial genomes in
response to their lifestyles and endosymbiotic genome
reduction as a phenomenon that occurs across different
bacterial phyla.

In order to confirm that the genomic DNA was pure
enough for further applications, we constructed the shotgun library and randomly selected 96 clones were onepass sequenced (see Additional file 2). Except for 6 clones
that possessed vector-derived contaminants, only one
clone showed apparent contamination of the host
genomic DNA, while no mitochondrial DNA was
detected. The average G+C content of the DNA fragments

The present method will facilitate genome sequence analysis of B. cuenoti, thereby providing important information on which genes have been retained by the symbiont
to contribute to the host's metabolism. The ability to
break down uric acid, one of the most intriguing functions
predicted in B. cuenoti, is rare among members of Flavobacterium genus, which represent the closest free-living relatives. It will thus be interesting to see the phylogenetic
affinity of uricolytic genes in B. cuenoti, if they are present
in the genome.
