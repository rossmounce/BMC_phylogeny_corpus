iASPP is over-expressed in human non-small cell
lung cancer and regulates the proliferation of
lung cancer cells through a p53 associated
pathway

Abstract
Background: iASPP is a key inhibitor of tumour suppressor p53 and is found to be up-regulated in certain
malignant conditions. The present study investigated the expression of iASPP in clinical lung cancer, a leading
cancer type in the world, and the biological impact of this molecule on lung cancer cells.
Methods: iASPP protein levels in lung cancer tissues were evaluated using an immunohistochemical method.
In vitro, iASPP gene expression was suppressed with a lentvirus-mediated shRNA method and the biological impact
after knocking down iASSP on lung cancer cell lines was investigated in connection with the p53 expression status.
Results: We showed here that the expression of iASPP was significantly higher in lung cancer tissues compared
with the adjacent normal tissues. iASPP shRNA treatment resulted in a down-regulation of iASPP in lung cancer
cells. There was a subsequent reduction of cell proliferation of the two lung tumour cell lines A459 and 95D both
of which had wild-type p53 expression. In contrast, reduction of iASPP in H1229 cells, a cell with little p53
expression, had no impact on its growth rate.
Conclusions: iASPP regulates the proliferation and motility of lung cancer cells. This effect is intimately associated
with the p53 pathway. Together with the pattern of the over-expression in clinical lung cancers, it is concluded
that iASPP plays an pivotal role in the progression of lung cancer and is a potential target for lung cancer therapy.

Background
The tumour suppressor protein p53 is a transcription
factor that responds to oncogenic stress such as DNA
damage, oncogene activtaion, g-irradiation and certain
chemotherapeutic drugs that may result in apoptosis
and cell-cycle arrest [1,2]. In over half of all of human
cancers, p53 has been shown to be either lost or
mutated. In those tumours in which the p53gene is
intact, the regulation of the p53 pathway may be defect
[3,4]. The type of response following p53 activation

depends upon a number of factors. Importantly, oncogenic transformation can cause a switch in the cell’s
response to p53 activation from growth arrest to programmed cell death. As a result, tumour cells are more
likely to undergo apoptosis following p53 activation
than the corresponding normal cells, making the p53
pathway an excellent target for therapeutic intervention
[5-8].
iSAPP, Inhibitory Member of the ASPP (Apoptosisstimulating protein of p53) family is also known as the
Rela-associated inhibitor, RAI and NF-kappa-B-interacting protein-1, NKIP1. It is one of the conserved inhibitors of p53. The discovery of the ASPP family of
proteins as specific regulators of p53 identifies a new
mechanism by which the apoptotic function of p53 is
regulated [9,10]. The name of the family is based on the
domain organization of the proteins (ankyrin repeat,

SH3, and proline-rich domain containing protein) as
well as their functions (apoptosis-stimulating protein of
p53) [11]. There are three family members in humans:
ASPP1, ASPP2, and iASPP. ASPP1 and ASPP2 enhance
the apoptotic function of p53, whereas iASPP inhibits
p53-dependent apoptosis [9-13]. Regulatory function of
p53 by iASPP is conserved from worm to human [14].
The expression levels of ASPP proteins in human malignancies have been sparsely reported. While ASPP1 and
ASPP2 are down-regulated in a large percentage of
tumours, iASPP has been found to be significantly
higher in patients with acute leukaemia when compared
with healthy donors or patients with leukaemia but with
complete remission. iASPP has also been found to be
over-expressed in breast carcinomas [14-19]. There has
been no reports on the expression of the ASPP family
and their possible functions in lung cancer.
In the present study, we first investigated the protein
expression of iASPP in human lung cancer tissues and
further evaluated the impact of knocking down iASPP,
by way of lentivirus shRNA to iASPP, on the function of
a panel of lung cancer cell lines which exhibited different p53 expression pattern.

Methods
Cell lines, reagents and antibodies

Human lung cancer cell lines A549, 95D and H1229
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured either
in in F-12K medium (A549 cells) or RPMI-1640
medium (95D cells and H1229 cells) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, at 37°C with 5% v/v CO 2 . MTT
assay reagents were purchased from DingGuo Biotech
(Beijing, China). 5-Bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assay
reagents were purchased from Chemicon International
(Temecula, CA, USA). Anti-iASPP mAb used for Western blot assay was purchased from Abcam (Boston,
MA, USA). Anti-iASPP rAb using for Immunohistochemical assay was purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., (Gilbertsville, PA, USA). Anti-GAPDH
monoclonal was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery

Sequences of iASPP shRNA were inserted into the
pGCL-GFP lentivirus RNAi expression system. The
shRNA containing vectors were transfected together
into 293T cells with pHelper1.0 and the lentiviral helper
plasmid pHelper2.0 to generate the respective lentiviruses. Viral stocks were collected from the transduced
293T cells and were used to infect A549 cells, 95D cells
and H1229 cells. The sequence of iASPP nonsense

Page 2 of 6

shRNA was: AATGTACTGCGCGTGGAGA; the
sequence of iASPP shRNA was AACACATGGATCTGAAGCAGA. The mRNA and protein levels were measured 72 hrs after cells being infected.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of iASPP expression

Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into
cDNA using M-MLV-RTase (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). The resulting cDNA was used for PCR using the
SYBR-Green Master PCR Mix (Applied Biosystem, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in triplicates. Primers for qRT-PCR were
as follows: iASPP forward primer: GGCGGTGAAGGAGATGAAC; iASPP reverse primer: TGATGAGGAAA
TCCACGATAGAGA; p53 forward primer: CCTCCT
CAGCATCTTATCC; p53 reverse primer: ACAAACACGCACCTCAAA; p21 forward primer: GGGACAGCAGAGGAAGACC; p21 reverse primer: GACTAAG
GCAGAAGATGTAGAGC; PUMA forward primer:
GACGACCTCAACGCACAG; PUMA reverse primer:
CACCTAATTGGGCTCCATCTC. PCR and data collection were performed on the TP800 qPCR System
(Takara, Japan). All quantitations were normalized to an
endogenous b-actin control. b-actin forward primer:
GGCGGCACCACCATGTACCCT; b-actin reverse primer: AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT. The relative
quantitation value for each target gene compared to the
calibrator for that target is expressed as 2-(Ct-Cc) (Ct and
Cc are the mean threshold cycle differences after normalizing to b-actin).
Western blot

Protein samples prepared from the cells were subjected
to SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Kankakee, IL, USA) and detected with appropriate
primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat, anti-mouse or rabbit IgG. The protein
signals were detected using SuperSignal West Dura
Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
MTT assay

All the cells, including those transfected, were grown in
exponential phase and detached by trypsin/EDTA treatment. Viable cells (2,000 cells/ml) were plated into 96well tissue culture plates (100 μl complete medium/well)
and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . At different time
points, MTT reagent was added (10 μl per well) and
incubated at 37°C for 4 hr. The reaction was stopped
with addition of 100 μl DMSO and the optical density
was determined at OD570 nm on a multi-well plate
reader. Data from three independent experiments were
analyzed by student t test and p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

BrdU assay

Results

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (1,500 cells/well)
and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . At different time
points, BrdU reagent was added (20 μl/well) and incubated at 37°C for 4 hr. Cells were then fixed in a fixation solution for 30 min. After washing three times with
a washing buffer, anti-BrdU antibody was added (50 μl/
well) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. Following washing,
an enzyme conjugated secondary antibody was added
(50 μl/well) and incubated at 37°C for a further 30 min.
Colour was then developed by incubation with 50 μl
TMB substrate for 30 min in dark and the optical density was determined at OD490 nm on a multi-well plate
reader. Data from three independent experiments were
analyzed by student t test and p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Over-expression of the iASSP protein in human lung
cancer tissues

Colony formation assay

Cells were seeded into six-well plates (200 cells/well) (in
three duplicate wells) and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2.
After two weeks, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then stained with GIEMSA for 10
min. ddH2O was used to wash the cells three times to
obtain a clean background. The number of colonies and
the cell number in each colony were counted and statistically analyzed.
Immunohistochemical Staining

Tissues sections (5-μm thick) were dewaxed, followed by
quenching the endogenous peroxidase with 3% H2O2 in
methanol for 30 min. Prior to staining, non-specific binding was blocked by incubation with 10% BSA in PBS at
37°C for 1 hr. Tissue sections were incubated with preimmune IgG or specific antibodies in PBS containing 1%
BSA at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with a
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit
antibody. Colour was then developed by incubation with
an ImmunoPure Metal Enhanced Diaminobenzidine
(DAB) Substrate kit (Pierce). After each incubation, tissue
sections were washed three times in PBS for 10 min. Tissue sections were finally counterstained with hematoxylin. For determination of iASPP immunoreactivity,
cytosolic staining of yellowish or brownish granules was
graded as follows: 0 for background staining, 1 for faint
staining, 2 for moderate staining and 3 for strong staining. In addition, positive staining areas in entire tissue
section were graded as follows: 0 for <5%, 1 for 5-25%,
2 for 26-50%, 3 for 51-75%, and 4 for 76%-100%. When
combining these two parameters, 0-2 and ≥3 were considered negative and positive staining, respectively.
Statistical analysis was carried using SPSS (version 16).
Fisher’s Exact test was used for analyzing the immunohistochemical data and Student t test for other quantitative data.

To determine the expression pattern of iASPP protein
in human lung cancer, immunohistochemical analysis
was performed on 49 pairs of tumour and normal tissues from patients pathologically verified for having
lung carcinoma. Immunoreactivity for iASSP antigens
was seen in 40.82% (20/49) of lung cancer tissues and
4.35% (2/46) of adjacent non-cancerous tissues (Figure
1), p < 0.001 by Fisher’s Exact test. The number of samples that were assigned each score is shown in Table 1.
Others previously reported that SNPs in iASPP are
related to the response of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) patients
[20]. Thus, the increase in iASPP expression may play
an important role in the pathogenesis of human lung
cancer.
Reduction of iASPP mRNA and protein expression by
shRNA in vitro

To further investigate the biological role of iASPP in
lung cancer cells, we knocked down iASPP transcript
in human lung cancer cell lines A549 cells, 95D cells
and H1229 cells. This was carried out by employing
shRNA technology. shRNA to iASPP was constructed
into PGCL-GFP vector using lentivirus transfection
system, as shown in Figure 2A. The lentivirus transfection system successfully down-regulated iASPP
expression at both mRNA level and protein level in
A549 cells, 95D cells and H1229 cells, in comparison
with blank controls or nonsense shRNA controls
(Figure 2B, C).

48 hours with the BrdU assay (Figure 2D), whereas with
the MTT assay (Figure 2F), the difference was seen after
4 days.

* Samples were defined as “iASPP positive” when the proportion of tumor
cells positive for iASPP (staining rate) was more than 50%.

iASPP down-regulation inhibited the proliferation of A549
cells and 95D cells

Using the iASPP knockdown cells, we first tested the
change of cell growth, using the MTT assay. The results
showed a significant decrease of cell growth and indicated that cell proliferation was inhibited after transfection with iASPP shRNA both in A549 cells and 95D
cells (Figure 2D, E). To further conform this result, we
carried out an alternative proliferation assay, the BrdU
assay. Consistent with the observations made with the
MTT assay, both A549 cells and 95D cells showed
lower BrdU positive staining after the cells were treated
with iASPP shRNA than the blank controls or cells treated with nonsense shRNA for 48 hours (Figure 2F, G).
Our results thus suggested that shRNA mediated downregulation of iASPP inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells. It is interesting to observe that BrdU assay
appeared to be a more sensitive method than the MTT
assay. A significant difference was seen as early as

iASPP down-regulation inhibited the colony formation of
A549 cells

Transfection of A549 cells with iASPP shRNA resulted
in a significant decrease in cell numbers in each colony,
when compared with A549 cells treated with blank control or nonsense shRNA (Figure 3A, B). The number of
colonies with more than 50 cells was also decreased in
iASPP shRNA transfected cells (Figure 3C, D). 95D cells
were unable to form colonies and were unable to be
assessed for this cellular function (data not shown).
iASPP regulated lung cancer cell proliferation, a
connection with the p53 pathway

Although iASPP down-regulation inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells and 95D cells, there was no changes
in the proliferation of H1229 cells when treated with
iASPP shRNA, as evident from both MTT and BrdU
assays (Figure 4A, and data not shown). Since iASPP
has been reported as a regulator of p53, we thus suspected that the difference between A549/95D cells and
H1229 cells in their response to iASPP shRNA may be
due to different p53 expression. Consistent with our
hypothesis, it was found that the H1229 cells expressed little iASSP mRNA, whereas A549 cells and 95D cells
showed high levels of the wild-type iASPP mRNA (Figure
4B). As a downstream effector of p53 activation, p21 and
PUMA [21,22] were also found to be significantly
increased in A549 cells after treatment with iASPP
shRNA, when compared with blank control or nonsense

affect the proliferation of H1229 cells. (B) A549 cells and 95D cells
had high p53 mRNA level, whereas H1299 cells had very low p53
mRNA levels. (C-D) The mRNA level of p21 and PUMA, which was

shRNA (Figure 4C, D). This provides further support that
iASPP regulates lung cancer cell proliferation in a manner
that is associated with the p53 pathway.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the
first report of up-regulation of iASPP in human lung
cancers. Our study has shown that there was an overexpression of the iASPP protein in lung tumour tissues
in comparison with normal tissues and that knocking
down iASPP resulted in an inhibition of cell proliferation. Given the prevalent of lung cancer and the death
rate associated with the tumour type [23], our finding
has important bearing.
In accordance with our results, others have reported
that SNPs in iASPP are associated with response to chemotherapy or combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy
in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) patients [20].
Together, it suggests that iASPP plays important roles
in lung cancer. In the present study, we also demonstrated that iASPP down-regulation inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of lung cancer cell lines
A549 and 95D in vitro. A few recent reports have indicated that iASPP is over-expressed in breast cancers and
certain types of leukaemia, and that down-regulation of
iASPP could inhibit the proliferation of these cancer
cells [14-19]. Together with our results in lung cancer,
it is plausible to suggest that iASPP acts as a common
factor of regulating the proliferation in difference cancer

cells. Over-expression of iASPP may be involved in both
the establishment and the progression of tumours,
whereas down-regulation of iASPP may inhibit tumour
development. In this regard, drugs specifically directed
against iASPP could be beneficial in the treatment of
cancers, including lung cancer [24].
p53 is perhaps one of the best known tumour suppressor genes and plays a critical role in regulating cell
proliferation through induction of growth arrest or
apoptosis. iASPP is the most phylogenetically conserved
inhibitor of p53 identified thus far. Our results suggesting that iASPP down-regulation in H1229 cells did not
affect the proliferation and colony formation is very
interesting. H1229 cells have little p53 expression as
shown in the literature and in the present study. This
thus confirms that the effect of iASPP is largely dependent upon p53 in order to regulate the apoptotic pathway, as seen with other cancer cell types. Besides p53,
the p53-related protein p73 also has the similar functions. Previously, iASPP has been shown to form a protein complex with p73 to regulate cell death [8,24].
Whether iASPP forms the same complex with p73 in
lung cancer cells deserve further exploration.
The ASPP family consists of three members, ASPP1,
ASPP2 and iASPP. All three proteins share sequence
similarity at their C-terminus which contains their signature sequences of ankyrin repeats, SH3 domain and
Proline-rich region. The C-terminus is the preferred
binding site for p53 [25]. In contrast to iASPP, ASPP1
and ASPP2 activate p53 to stimulate specifically the
expression of pro-apoptotic target genes. This implies
that ASPP1 and ASPP2 can compete with iASPP for
binding to p53, thereby inhibiting the ability of iASPP
and stimulating the apoptotic function of p53. However,
the detailed mechanism requires further exploration.

Conclusions
We report that that iASPP is over-expressed in human
non-small cell lung cancer tissues when compared with
normal tissues. shRNA mediated down-regulation of
iASPP results in inhibition of proliferation and colony
formation of two lung tumour cell lines A459 and 95D
which have high wild-type p53 expression [26,27] and
has no impact on the H1229 cells which has little p53
expression in vitro. This further suggests that iASPP is a
target for lung cancer therapy associated with p53
pathway.
