Abstract
Background: The genus Arsenophonus is a group of symbiotic, mainly insect-associated bacteria
with rapidly increasing number of records. It is known from a broad spectrum of hosts and
symbiotic relationships varying from parasitic son-killers to coevolving mutualists.
The present study extends the currently known diversity with 34 samples retrieved mainly from
hippoboscid (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) and nycteribiid (Diptera: Nycteribiidae) hosts, and
investigates phylogenetic relationships within the genus.
Results: The analysis of 110 Arsenophonus sequences (incl. Riesia and Phlomobacter), provides a
robust monophyletic clade, characterized by unique molecular synapomorphies. On the other
hand, unstable inner topology indicates that complete understanding of Arsenophonus evolution
cannot be achieved with 16S rDNA. Moreover, taxonomically restricted Sampling matrices prove
sensitivity of the phylogenetic signal to sampling; in some cases, Arsenophonus monophyly is
disrupted by other symbiotic bacteria. Two contrasting coevolutionary patterns occur throughout
the tree: parallel host-symbiont evolution and the haphazard association of the symbionts with
distant hosts. A further conspicuous feature of the topology is the occurrence of monophyletic
symbiont lineages associated with monophyletic groups of hosts without a co-speciation pattern.
We suggest that part of this incongruence could be caused by methodological artifacts, such as
intragenomic variability.
Conclusion: The sample of currently available molecular data presents the genus Arsenophonus as
one of the richest and most widespread clusters of insect symbiotic bacteria. The analysis of its
phylogenetic lineages indicates a complex evolution and apparent ecological versatility with
switches between entirely different life styles. Due to these properties, the genus should play an
important role in the studies of evolutionary trends in insect intracellular symbionts. However,
under the current practice, relying exclusively on 16S rRNA sequences, the phylogenetic analyses
are sensitive to various methodological artifacts that may even lead to description of new
Arsenophonus lineages as independent genera (e.g. Riesia and Phlomobacter). The resolution of the
evolutionary questions encountered within the Arsenophonus clade will thus require identification
of new molecular markers suitable for the low-level phylogenetics.

Background
The bacterial genus Arsenophonus corresponds to a group
of insect intracellular symbionts with a long history of
investigation. Although many new Arsenophonus
sequences have been published in the last several years,
along with documentation of diverse evolutionary patterns in this group (Figure 1), the first records of these bacteria date to the pre-molecular era. Based on
ultrastructural features, several authors described a transovarially transmitted infection associated with son-killing
in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis [1-3]. Later, they
were formally assigned to a new genus within the family
Enterobacteriaceae with a single species, Arsenophonus
nasoniae [4]. The same authors proposed a close relationship of Arsenophonus to free-living bacteria of the genus
Proteus. Independently, other microscopic studies
revealed morphologically similar symbionts from various
tissues of blood-sucking triatomine bugs [5,6]; a decade
later these bacteria were determined on molecular
grounds to belong to the same clade and were named
Arsenophonus triatominarum [7]. Interestingly, the next
record on symbiotic bacteria closely related to A. nasoniae
was from a phytopathological study investigating marginal chlorosis of strawberry [8]. Since available sequence
data were insufficient for reliable phylogenetic placement,
the phloem-inhabiting pathogen was described as a new
genus, Phlomobacter, with a single species P. fragariae [8].
Since these descriptions, the number of Arsenophonus
records has steadily been increasing, resulting in two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/143

important changes in knowledge of Arsenophonus evolution and roles in hosts. First, the known host spectrum has
been considerably extended with diverse insect groups
and even non-insect taxa. So far, Arsenophonus has been
identified from parasitic wasps, triatomine bugs, psyllids,
whiteflies, aphids, ticks, ant lions, hippoboscids, streblids, bees, lice, and two plant species [4,7-23]. Second,
these recent studies have revealed an unsuspected diversity of symbiotic types within the genus. This dramatically
changes the original perception of Arsenophonus as a bionomically homogeneous group of typical secondary ("S") symbionts undergoing frequent horizontal transfers
among phylogenetically distant hosts. For example, recent
findings indicate that some insect groups harbor monophyletic clusters of Arsenophonus, possibly playing a role of
typical primary ("P-") symbionts. These groups were
reported from the dipteran families Hippoboscidae and
Streblidae [20] and most recently from several lice species
[18,24,25]. Such a close phylogenetic relationship of different types of symbiotic bacteria is not entirely unique
among insect symbionts. With the increasing amount of
knowledge on the heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics of symbiotic associations, it is becoming clear that no
distinct boundaries separate the P- and S-symbionts.
Thus, in their strict meaning, the terms have recently
become insufficient, especially for more complex situations, such as studies exploring bacterial diversity within a
single host species [14,17]. Furthermore, these terms have
been shown not to reflect phylogenetic position; remarkable versatility of symbiotic associations can be observed

in the Gammaproteobacteria overall, as well as within the
individual clusters, such as Arsenophonus or Sodalis
[16,26].
The genus Arsenophonus is striking in the diversity of symbiont types represented. Apart from many lineages with
typical S-symbiont features, this genus has given rise to
several clusters of P-symbionts [18,20,24]. Unfortunately,
this heterogeneity introduced an annoying degree of phylogenetic instability and nomenclatory confusion.
Because P-symbionts show accelerated evolutionary rates,
they form long branches in phylogenies, leading to unstable patterns of clustering as observed for P-symbionts
within Enterobacteriaceae [27]. The same behavior can be
seen in the louse-specific clade of Arsenophonus, which are
consequently originally described as a new bacterial genus
Riesia [25]. In addition, the Arsenophonus cluster is the
only monophyletic group of symbiotic bacteria currently
known to possess at least four highly different phenotypes, including son-killing [4], phytopathogenicity [8],
obligate association with bacteriocytes in the host
[18,20,24], and apparently non-specific horizontally
transmitted bacteria that are possibly mutualistic [15].
These characteristics indicate that the genus Arsenophonus
represents an important and widespread lineage of symbiotic bacteria that serves as a valuable model for examining
molecular evolution of bacteria-arthropod associations.
In this study, we add 34 new records on symbionts to the
known spectrum of Arsenophonus lineages. We explore and
summarize the current picture of Arsenophonus evolution
by analyzing all sequences available for this clade. To
investigate the phylogenetic position, stability and evolutionary trends of the Arsenophonus cluster, we complete
the sample with related symbionts and free-living bacteria. Finally, we explore molecular characteristics and
informative value of the 16S rRNA gene as the most frequently used phylogenetic marker.

Results
Sequences and alignments
From 15 insect taxa, we obtained 34 sequences of 16S
rDNA that exhibited a high degree of similarity to
sequences from the bacterial genus Arsenophonus when
identified by BLAST. The length of the PCR-amplified fragments varied from 632 to 1198 bp, with the guanine-cytosine (GC) content ranging from 46.22 to 54.84% (Figure
2, bars). For three specimens of the hippoboscid Ornithomya avicularia, two different sequences were obtained
from each single individual. After combining with all Arsenophonus 16S rDNA sequences currently available in the
GenBank, and several additional free-living and symbiotic
bacteria, the dataset produced a 1222 bp long Basic matrix.
The alignment has a mosaic structure, discussed below.
Within the set, a large group of sequences show a high

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/143

degree of similarity (0.1–7.3% divergence) and exhibit
GC content and sequence length similar to those found in
free-living enterobacteria. The set also includes several
sequences with modifications typical for many proteobacterial symbionts, particularly the presence of long insertions within the variable regions and decreased GC
content. Sequence distances among these taxa range up to
17.8%.
Phylogeny
All phylogenetic analyses of the Basic matrix yielded a
monophyletic Arsenophonus clade (Figure 2). The new 34
sequences (Figure 2, arrows), identified by BLAST as putative members or relatives of the genus Arsenophonus,
always clustered within the Arsenophonus clade. Their precise position was only partially correlated with host taxon.
Some of the Arsenophonus sequences from hippoboscoid
hosts clustered within monophyletic host-specific groups
(Figure 2, printed in red) while others were scattered
across the tree as isolated lineages (Figure 2, printed in
dark orange). Two distinct sequences were determined
from each individual specimen of O. avicularia; these clustered at distant positions within the tree (Figure 2, numbers with asterisks).

The most typical lineages display short-branches with low
divergence and unstable positions within the Arsenophonus clade (Figure 2, printed in dark orange). At the
opposite extreme are well supported host-specific clusters
exhibiting long branches, such as the louse symbiont
Riesia or the symbionts described from several streblid
species. An intermediate situation is found in putatively
host-specific but less robust clusters, such as the Arsenophonus lineages from triatomine bugs, some hippoboscoids or homopterans (Figure 2). In an analogy to
previously analyzed symbiotic bacteria [e.g. [28,29]], the
phylogenetic properties of the sequences were also
reflected in their GC contents. In the short-branched taxa,
the GC content of the 16S rRNA sequence varies from
51.72 to 54.84%, the values typical for S-symbionts and
free-living bacteria [30]. In contrast, the 16S rRNA
sequences with low GC content, varying between 46.22
and 51.93%, were found in the long-branched taxa clustering within the host-specific monophyletic lineages (e.g.
the symbionts from Ornithomyia, Lipoptena, Trichobius,
and the Riesia clade).
Considerable loss of phylogenetic information was
observed in the Conservative matrix. In this case, the relationships among individual Arsenophonus lineages were
highly unstable, resulting in large polytomies of many
short-branched taxa within the consensus trees (see Additional file 1). Also the relationships among the longbranched lineages, although resolved, differ sharply from
those derived from the Basic matrix data, and the genus

Phylogenetic tree derived from the Basic matrix (1222 positions) under ML criterion. Names of the taxa clustering
within the Arsenophonus clade are printed in colour: red for the long-branched taxa, dark orange for the short-branched taxa.
The arrows point to the new sequences obtained in our study. Different types of sequences determined from the specimens of
O. avicularia are designated by the numbers with asterisks. The type species A. nasoniae is designated by the orange asterisk.
Solid circles on branches label the clusters strictly concordant with the host phylogenies. Open circles designate host-specific
lineages without coevolutionary signal. Solid vertical lines indicate reciprocally monophyletic groups of symbionts and hosts.
Dashed lines show paraphyletic symbiont clades restricted to monophyletic host groups. Names in the brackets indicate host
taxa. "Symb-" in the taxon designation stands for "Symbiotic bacteria of". Bars represent GC content of each taxa. Complete
information on the sequences is provided in the Additional file 5.

Proteus was not positioned as the closest relative of Arsenophonus. Thus, the information contained in the Conservative matrix (restricted to one fourth of Basic dataset, i.e.,
284 bp) is insufficient for reliable phylogenetic placement
of closely related taxa.
The analyses of taxonomically restricted Sampling matrices
confirmed the expected dependence of the phylogenetic
conclusions on the taxon sampling (examples of topologies obtained are provided in Figures 3, 4 and Additional
file 2). The highest degree of susceptibility was observed
with MP, particularly under Tv:Ts ratio set to 1. The most
fundamental distortion occurred with the matrix
Sampling3, where one lineage (composed of Buchnera,
Wigglesworthia, Blochmannia, and S-symbiont from Trioza
magnoliae) clustered either as a sister group of Riesia clade
or together with Sodalis. Thus, the consensus tree did not
preserve the monophyly of an Arsenophonus clade
(Figure 3).
The calculation of divergence times yielded substantially
different results depending on the choice of calibration
points. Use of the Riesia diversification as a reference
point suggested a recent origin of the triatomine-associated Arsenophonus branch; the median value of the estimate distribution was 2.6 mya. In contrast, the calibration
by Escherichia-Salmonella returned considerably higher
dates with the median at 24.5 mya.

Discussion
Phylogenetic patterns and the stability of the information
Phylogenetic relationships of the Arsenophonus symbionts
display a remarkably complex arrangement of various
types of symbiosis and evolutionary patterns. Moreover, a
comparison of the branch ordering within each of these
subclusters to the host phylogeny indicates a cospeciation
process within several lineages (discussed below). From
the phylogenetic perspective, no clearcut boundary
divides the set of Arsenophonus sequences into the ecologically distinct types. The position of the long-branched
subclusters within the topology is not stable. Under the
MP criterion with transition rate 1:3 and under the ML criterion they form a unique monophyletic cluster (Figure
5A), while in other analyses the individual host-specific
subclusters were scattered among the short-branched lineages (Figure 5B, Figure 6).

The low resolution and instability of the trees inferred
from the Conservative matrix suggest that a substantial part
of the phylogenetic information is located within the
"ambiguously" aligned regions that were removed by the
GBlocks procedure. This fact is particularly important
when considering the frequent occurrence of insertions/
deletions within the sequences (see Additional file 3).
This may lead to deletion of these critical fragments in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/143

many phylogenetic analyses. Interestingly, the monophyletic nature of Arsenophonus was preserved even in this
highly Conservative matrix. This indicates that within the
complete data set, the phylogenetic information underlying the Arsenophonus monophyly is sufficiently strong and
is contained in the conservative regions of the sequences.
In accordance with this presumption, several molecular
synapomorphies can be identified in the Basic and Conservative matrices. The most pronounced is the motif GTC/
GTT located in positions 481–483 and 159–161 of Basic
matrix and Conservative matrix, respectively.
Relevance of the sampling
To test an effect of sampling on the phylogenetic inference
within Arsenophonus, we examined five Sampling matrices
with different taxa compositions (see the section Methods). In addition to the MP, ML, and Bayesian analyses, we
performed an ML calculation under the nonhomogeneous model of the substitutions, designated as T92 [31,32].
This model was previously used to test the monophyly/
polyphyly of the P-symbiotic lineages and brought the
first serious evidence for a possible independent origin of
major P-symbiotic taxa [27]. We were not able to apply
the same approach to the Basic and Conservative matrices
since the program Phylowin failed to process these large
datasets under the ML criterion. The analyses of several
taxonomically restricted Sampling matrices proved the
sensitivity of phylogenetic signal to the sampling. In the
most extreme case, shown in Figure 3A, even the monophyly of the Arsenophonus clade was disrupted by other
lineages of symbiotic bacteria. Considering the results of
the extensive analysis of the Basic matrix, this arrangement
is clearly a methodological artifact. Since both Riesia and
the P-symbiont lineage are long-branched taxa with rapid
evolution of 16S rDNA, their affinity is very likely caused
by Long Branch Attraction (LBA; for review see [33])
within the taxonomically compromised matrix. It is
symptomatic that this topology was inferred by MP, the
method known to be particularly prone to the LBA. To further test this distortion, one of the long-branched taxa was
removed from the data set (matrix Sampling4). This
approach restored the Arsenophonus monophyly and confirmed the effect of LBA phenomenon (see Additional
file 2).

The aim of these taxonomically restricted analyses was to
"simulate" phylogenetic placement of newly determined
symbionts. In such casual studies, the symbiotic lineages
are rarely represented by all available sequences in the way
we composed the Basic matrix. Rather, each symbiotic lineage is represented by few randomly selected sequences.
Under such circumstances, incorrect topologies (e.g. the
Sampling5-derived topology on the Figure 4) can be
obtained due to various methodological artifacts. This situation can be illustrated by empirical data: at least in two

studies, the louse-associated lineage of Arsenophonus was
not recognized as a member of the Arsenophonus clade
[25,34]. Consequently, when more recent studies, based
on better sampling, proved the position of Riesia within
the Arsenophonus cluster [18,24] the genus Arsenophonus
became paraphyletic (see the section Conclusion for more
details).
Interestingly, topologies inferred by likelihood analyses
using the T92 evolution model [31] were influenced neither by the compromised sampling nor by the removal of
unreliably aligned regions.
Cophylogeny vs. horizontal transfers: possible sources of
phylogenetic incongruence
The phylogenetic tree of all Arsenophonus sequences exhibits both patterns, the parallel evolution of symbionts and
their hosts and the haphazard association of symbionts
from different host taxa. Coincidentally, both arrangements can be demonstrated on the newly sequenced symbionts from various hippoboscoid species. Some of
hippoboscoid-associated Arsenophonus show possible
host specificity; in a few analyses they cluster within several monophyletic short-branched groups. Since relationships among the short-branched taxa are generally not
well resolved, these lineages are scattered throughout the
whole topology (Figure 2). In contrast, relationships

within the long-branched clusters of hippoboscoid-associated taxa are in agreement with the host phylogeny (the
Arsenophonus clusters strictly reflecting the host phylogeny
are designated by solid circle in the Figure 2). Interestingly, a coevolutionary pattern was also identified for streblids of the genus Trichobius and their symbionts. In the
original study published by Trowbridge et al. [20], the distribution of Trichobius symbionts was apparently not consistent with the host phylogeny. Our analysis in a broad
context indicates that this discrepancy might have been
caused by different bacterial sampling and particularly by
aberrant behavior of the sequence from Trichobius yunkeri
[GenBank: DQ314776]. This sequence is likely to be an
artificial chimerical product of at least two distant lineages; according to our BLAST tests it shares 100% identity
with S-symbiont of Psylla pyricola [GenBank: AF286125]
along a 1119 bp long region. Removal of this sequence
from the dataset restored a complete phylogenetic congruence between Trichobius, based on the phylogeny of this
genus published by Dittmar et al. [35], and its symbionts.
This finding exemplifies the danger of chimeric sequences
in studies of symbiotic bacteria, obtained by the PCR on
the sample containing DNA mixture from several bacteria.
The presence of several symbiotic lineages within a single
host is well known [e.g. [14,36-38]]. In this study, we
demonstrate a possible such case in O. avicularia. From
three individuals of this species we obtained pairs of different sequences branching at two distant positions
(labelled by the numbers 1* to 3* in Figure 2). The identical clustering seen in all three pairs within the tree shows
that they are not chimeric products but represent two different sequences.
While the identity between symbiont relationships and
the host phylogeny is apparently a consequence of hostsymbiont cophylogeny, the interpretation of the randomly scattered symbionts is less obvious. Usually, such
an arrangement is explained as result of transient infections and frequent horizontal transfers among distant
host taxa. This is typical, for example, of the Wolbachia
symbionts in wide range of insect species [39]. Generally,
the capability to undergo inter-host transfers is assumed
for several symbiotic lineages and has even been demonstrated under experimental conditions [40,41]. Since the
Arsenophonus cluster contains bacteria from phylogenetically distant insect taxa and also bacteria isolated from
plants, it is clear that horizontal transfers and/or multiple
establishments of the symbiosis have occurred. However,
part of the incongruence could be caused by methodological artifacts. A conspicuous feature of the Arsenophonus
topology is the occurrence of monophyletic symbiont lineages associated with monophyletic groups of insect host
but without a co-speciation pattern. Although our study
cannot present an exhaustive explanation of such a picture, we want to point out two factors that might in theory

take part in shaping the relationships among Arsenophonus
sequences, lateral gene transfer (LGT) and intragenomic
heterogeneity. Both have previously been determined as
causes of phylogenetic distortions and should be considered in coevolutionary studies at a low phylogenetic level.
Incongruence due to LGT and intragenomic heterogeneity
An apparently "mosaic" structure of the Arsenophonus
alignment (for example see Additional file 4) raises the
question of whether various regions of this sequence
could have undergone different evolutionary histories.
Recombination of 16S rDNA genes were previously identified in some other bacteria [42-44]. In actinomycetes,
the occurrence of short rDNA segments with high number
of non-random variations was attributed to the lateral
transfer as the most parsimonious explanation [45]. Later,
Gogarten et al. [46] suggested that, analogously to an
entire bacterial genome, 16S rDNA possesses a mosaic
character originated by LGT, respectively by transfer of
gene subunits.

As bacterial genomes often carry more than one rRNA
operon, intragenomic heterogeneity of the rDNA copies is
occasionally found to blur the phylogenetic picture [4750]. Although there is no direct information on the
number of rRNA gene copies in Arsenophonus genomes,
Stewart and Cavanaugh [51] showed bacterial genomes to
encode in average five rRNA operons. The most closely
related bacterium of which the complete genome has
recently been sequenced, Proteus mirabilis, carries seven
copies [GenBank: AM942759]. Arsenophonus-focused
studies indicate that two different forms of the rRNA
operon are present in its genome, as is typical for Enterobacteraceae [23,52]. Furthermore, Šorfová et al. [23] suggest that the variability among individual copies may
cause the incongruence observed between triatomines
and their Arsenophonus lineages. They point out that this
process could, in principle, explain an otherwise problematic observation: in some hosts, such as triatomines or
some homopterans, the hosts and the Arsenophonus bacteria create reciprocally monophyletic clusters but do not
show any cospeciation pattern. In the symbionts of grain
weevils, divergence between rRNA sequences within a
genome was shown sometimes to exceed divergence of
orthologous copies from symbionts from different hosts;
this unusual situation was hypothesized to reflect loss of
recombinational repair mechanisms from these symbiont
genomes [53].
Estimates of the divergence time
With the present incomplete knowledge of the Arsenophonus genome, it is difficult to assess whether and how
deeply rRNA heterogeneity affects phylogenetic reconstruction. Trying to find alternative solution, Šorfová et al.
[23] attempted to use the estimation of divergence times

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/143

as a guide for deciding between different coevolutionary
scenarios. They used the Escherichia-Salmonella divergence
[54,55] as a calibration point for calculating the divergence time among various Arsenophonus lineages from triatomine bugs. Applying the Multdiv method [56], they
placed the ancestor of triatomine-associated symbionts
into a broad range of approx. 15 – 40 mya and concluded
that this estimate is compatible or even exceeds the age
estimates available for the tribe triatomine (according to
Gaunt and Miles [57]). Here, we took advantage of a new
age-estimate for closely related bacteria, namely the louseassociated symbionts of the genus Riesia [18]. Comparing
the estimates based on the two calibration methods
(Escherichia-Salmonella and Riesia), we found that due to
the variability of evolutionary rates among the lineages,
the results may differ by an order of magnitude. Such
marked variance among different bacterial lineages
(including different symbiotic bacteria from the same
host species) was previously reported for many bacterial
groups [29,30,37,39,58-63]. Most recently, Allen et al.
[64] reported an extremely high evolutionary rate for the
young symbiotic lineage Riesia, and suggested that the
evolutionary tempo changes with the age of the symbiotic
lineage. We therefore conclude that this method cannot
be directly used to assess the effect of intragenomic heterogeneity on our reconstruction of Arsenophonus relationships.

Conclusion
With more than one hundred records, the genus Arsenophonus represents one of the richest and most widespread
clusters of insect symbiotic bacteria. Considering its broad
host spectrum and apparent ecological versatility, Arsenophonus should play an important role in studies of evolutionary trends in insect intracellular symbionts. Due to
this fact, Arsenophonus is likely to attract a growing attention, and the number of the records may rapidly be
increasing during the next years. For example, 7 new
sequences were deposited into the GenBank since the
completion of this study [[65], and unpublished record
FJ388523]. However, since these new Arsenophonus
records originated in screening rather than phylogenetic
study, they are only represented by short DNA fragments
(approx. 500 bp). Preliminary analyses of these fragments
together with our complete datasets confirmed a limited
informative value of such short sequences and they were
not included into the more exhaustive phylogenetic procedures.
The analysis of 110 available sequences of Arsenophonus
16S rDNA from 54 host taxa revealed several interesting
evolutionary patterns. In particular, this clade includes at
least two transitions from S-symbiont, with ability to
invade new host lineages, to P-symbiont, showing obligate relationship to hosts and a strict pattern of maternal

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:143

transmission. Thus, it is a promising system for exploring
the genomic and biological changes that accompany the
shift from facultative to obligate symbiont. Arsenophonus
is also one of the few groups of insect symbionts for which
strains have been grown in pure culture [4,7,16], a feature
that further enhances its potential as a model for symbiont research.
Our results also indicate that a complete understanding of
the Arsenophonus phylogeny cannot be achieved with 16S
rDNA genes alone. A similar situation is, for example,
found in another large symbiotic group, the genus Wolbachia, where other genes are often used as alternative
sources of phylogenetic information [66,67]. Identification of suitable low-level-phylogeny marker(s) is thus one
of the most crucial steps in the further research on Arsenophonus evolution. The sequencing of the complete Arsenophonus genome, which is currently under the process
http://genomesonline.org/gold.cgi?want=Bacte
rial+Ongoing+Genomes&pubsort=Domain, will provide
a valuable background for such enterprise.
Based on the presented analyses, we also want to point
out that the genus Arsenophonus is currently paraphyletic
due to the two lineages described as separate genera Riesia
and Phlomobacter but clustering within the Arsenophonus
group (e.g. Figure 2). Two procedures can, in principle,
solve this undesirable situation, splitting of the Arsenophonus cluster into several separate genera or classification
of all its members within the genus Arsenophonus. Taking
into account the phylogenetic arrangement of the individual lineages, the first approach would inevitably lead to
establishment of many genera with low sequence divergences and very similar biology. The second option has
been previously mentioned in respect to the genus Phlomobacter [68], and we consider this approach (i.e. reclassification of all members of the Arsenophonus clade within a
single genus) a more appropriate solution of the current
situation within the Arsenophonus clade.

Methods
Samples
The host species used in this study were acquired from
several sources. All of the nycteribiid samples were
obtained from Radek Lučan. Most of the hippoboscids
were provided by Jan Votýpka. Ant species were collected
by Milan Janda in Papua New Guinea. All other samples
are from the authors' collection. List of the sequences
included in the Basic matrix is provided in the Additional
file 5.
DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing
The total genomic DNA was extracted from individual
samples using DNEasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN; Hilden, Germany). Primers F40 and R1060 designed to amplify

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/143

approx. 1020 bp of 16S rDNA, particularly within Enterobacteriaceae [34], were used for all samples. PCR was performed under standard conditions using HotStart Taq
polymerase (HotStarTaqi DNA Polymerase, Qiagen). The
PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and
cloned into pGEM-T Easy System 1 vector (Promega).
Inserts from selected colonies were amplified using T7
and SP6 primers and sequenced in both directions, with
the exception of 3 fragments sequenced in one direction
only (sequences from Aenictus huonicus and Myzocalis sp.).
DNA sequencing was performed on automated sequencer
model 310 ABI PRISM (PE-Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) using the BigDye DNA sequencing kit (PEBiosystems). For each sample, five to ten colonies were
screened on average. The contig construction and
sequence editing was done in the SeqMan program from
the DNASTAR platform (Dnastar, Inc. 1999). Identification of the sequences was done using BLAST, NCBI http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi.
Alignments
To analyze thoroughly the behavior of Arsenophonus 16S
rDNA and assess its usefulness as a phylogenetic marker,
we prepared several matrices and performed an array of
phylogenetic analyses on each of them.

The Basic matrix was composed of the 34 new sequences,
all Arsenophonus sequences available in the GenBank and
additional 45 sequences of various P-symbionts, S-symbiont and 5 free living bacteria (see Additional file 5). To
show the impact of random or restricted sampling on the
resulting topology, five different matrices labelled Samplingi (i.e. Sampling1, Sampling2, etc.) were prepared from
Basic matrix by removing various taxa and including additional/alternative outgroups. The matrices Sampling1 to
Sampling4 were composed of various numbers of nonArsenophonus symbiotic taxa (ranging from 3 to 35), three
sequences of free-living bacteria, and an arbitrarily
selected set of all Arsenophonus lineages. Matrix designated
as Sampling5 was restricted to a lower number of taxa,
including 5 ingroup sequences and alternative lineages of
symbiotic and free-living bacteria.
All matrices were aligned in the server-based program
MAFFT
http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/online/
server/, using the E-INS-i algorithm with default parameters. The program BioEdit [69] was used to manually correct the resulting matrices and to calculate the GC content
of the sequences.
To test an effect of unreliably aligned regions on the phylogenetic analysis, we further prepared the Conservative
matrix, by removing variable regions from the Basic matrix.
For this procedure, we used the program Gblocks [70]
available as server-based application on the web page

Finally, the Clock matrix, composed of 12 bacterial
sequence (see Additional file 5), was designed to calculate
time of divergence for several nodes within the Arsenophonus topology.

Phylogenetic analyses
The matrices were analyzed using maximum parsimony
(MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian probability. For analyses, we used the following programs and procedures. The GTR+Γ+inv model of molecular evolution
was determined as best fitting by the program Modeltest
[71] and was used in all ML-based analyses. MP analysis
was carried out in TNT program [72] using the Traditional
search option, with 100 replicates of heuristic search,
under the assumptions of Ts/Tv ratio 1 and 3. ML analysis
was done in the Phyml program [73] with model parameters estimated from the data. Bayesian analysis was performed in Mr. Bayes ver. 3.1.2. with following parameter
settings: nst = 6, rates = invgamma, ngen = 3000000, samplefreq = 100, and printfreq = 100. The program Phylowin
[74] was employed for the ML analysis under the nonhomogeneous model of substitution [31].

A calculation of divergence time was performed in the
program Beast [75] which implements MCMC procedure
to sample target distribution of the posterior probabilities. The gamma distribution coupled with the GTR+invgamma model was approximated by 6 categories of
substitution rates. Relaxed molecular clock (uncorrelated
lognormal option) was applied to model the rates along
the lineages. To obtain a time-framework for the tree, we
used the estimate on louse divergence (approximately 5.6
mya [18]). Since the resulting estimate was considerably
lower that that reported previously with Escherichia-Salmonella calibration [23], we prepared an additional matrix
and used the Escherichia-Salmonella split [54,55] as an
alternative calibration; taxa included according to Šorfová
et al. [23]. All analyses were performed in three independent runs, each taking 5 million generations.
