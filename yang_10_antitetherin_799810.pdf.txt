Anti-tetherin activities in Vpu-expressing primate
lentiviruses

Abstract
Background: The anti-viral activity of the cellular restriction factor, BST-2/tetherin, was first observed as an ability to
block the release of Vpu-minus HIV-1 from the surface of infected cells. However, tetherin restriction is also
counteracted by primate lentiviruses that do not express a Vpu protein, where anti-tetherin functions are provided
by either the Env protein (HIV-2, SIVtan) or the Nef protein (SIVsm/mac and SIVagm). Within the primate
lentiviruses, Vpu is also present in the genomes of SIVcpz and certain SIVsyk viruses. We asked whether, in these
viruses, anti-tetherin activity was always a property of Vpu, or if it had selectively evolved in HIV-1 to perform this
function.
Results: We found that despite the close relatedness of HIV-1 and SIVcpz, the chimpanzee viruses use Nef instead
of Vpu to counteract tetherin. Furthermore, SIVcpz Nef proteins had activity against chimpanzee but not human
tetherin. This specificity mapped to a short sequence that is present in the cytoplasmic tail of primate but not
human tetherins, and this also accounts for the specificity of SIVsm/mac Nef for primate but not human tetherins.
In contrast, Vpu proteins from four diverse members of the SIVsyk lineage all displayed an anti-tetherin activity that
was active against macaque tetherin. Interestingly, Vpu from a SIVgsn isolate was also found to have activity
against human tetherin.
Conclusions: Primate lentiviruses show a high degree of flexibility in their use of anti-tetherin factors, indicating a
strong selective pressure to counteract tetherin restriction. The identification of an activity against human tetherin
in SIVgsn Vpu suggests that the presence of Vpu in the ancestral SIVmus/mon/gsn virus believed to have
contributed the 3’ half of the HIV-1 genome may have played a role in the evolution of viruses that could
counteract human tetherin and infect humans.

Background
The release of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses from
the surface of infected cells is reduced by the activity of
the interferon-inducible cell surface protein BST-2/
CD317/HM1.24/"tetherin” [1-6]. The importance of
overcoming this restriction for virus replication is
reflected in the growing list of viral proteins that have
been shown to possess anti-tetherin activities, with the
primate lentiviruses in particular having evolved diverse
approaches that include the HIV-1 Vpu, HIV-2 Env and
certain SIV Nef and Env proteins [2,3,7-12].
Analyses of the interactions between tetherins from
different primate species and the anti-tetherin proteins

used by viruses that infect those hosts have revealed a
high degree of specificity. For example, although all
tetherins analyzed to date can block HIV-1 particle
release as efficiently as human tetherin, non-human
tetherins are usually insensitive to antagonism by the
HIV-1 Vpu protein [9,10,12-14]. The determinants of
the Vpu-tetherin interaction have been mapped to the
transmembrane (TM) domain of tetherin [9,13,15,16].
Within Vpu, the TM domain has long been known to
be required for efficient virus release [17,18] and is now
known to play an important role in the Vpu-tetherin
interaction [2,3], while the cytoplasmic tail of Vpu contains a b-TrCP binding domain comprising residues serine 52 and 56 and a positively charged hinge region at
the start of the cytoplasmic domain which both contribute to its anti-tetherin activity [14,19,20]. In addition,
specificity has been observed in the interaction between

tetherins and SIV Nef proteins that depends on a short
stretch of amino acids that is present in the cytoplasmic
tail of primate tetherins such as chimpanzee, macaque,
or African green monkey, but not in human tetherin
[9,10].
The primate lentiviruses have been classified into six
major lineages on the basis of phylogenetic analyses
(Table 1) [21,22]. Interestingly, only two lineages contain
Vpu in their genome, the SIVcpz/HIV-1 lineage and certain members of the SIVsyk lineage that include the
SIVgsn sublineage (SIVmus, SIVmon, and SIVgsn), as
well as the SIVden isolate [23-28]. Vpu is a type I integral membrane protein that plays multiple roles in the
HIV-1 life-cycle in addition to counteracting tetherin
[29]. The close similarity between HIV-1 and SIVcpz led
us to examine whether SIVcpz Vpu proteins could also
counteract human tetherin, and if this could have been
important in allowing HIV-1 to cross the species barrier
and infect humans. Surprisingly none of the SIVcpz Vpu
proteins that we tested had anti-tetherin activity, even
against the species-matched chimpanzee tetherin.
Instead, we found that an anti-tetherin activity in these
viruses resides in the Nef protein. In contrast, the more
distantly related SIVsyk viruses possessed an antitetherin activity in Vpu although, with a single exception, this was not active against human tetherin. Taken
together, these findings suggest a high degree of flexibility in the evolution of anti-tetherin factors within the
primate lentiviruses, with the diverse anti-tetherin strategies observed suggesting either convergent evolution
or the re-acquisition of anti-tetherin activities in viral
proteins as viruses adapted to new host species. It also
leads us to speculate that having an anti-tetherin activity
in Vpu in the SIVgsn ancestor that gave rise to the 3’
half of the SIVcpz/HIV-1 genome may have been especially important for the evolution of the subgroup of
viruses that could counteract human tetherin and infect
humans.

Results
Vpu from SIVcpz does not counteract human or
chimpanzee tetherin

SIVcpz viruses are closely related to HIV-1 and contain
a Vpu open-reading frame (Figure 1A, Table 1). We
tested whether SIVcpz Vpu proteins have anti-tetherin
activity by examining their ability to increase the release
of HIV-1 virus like particles (VLPs) from HeLa cells,
which naturally express human tetherin [2,3]. We initially tested the Vpu protein from the GAB1 strain of
SIVcpz, which is representative of viruses isolated from
Pan troglodytes troglodytes that are more closely related
to HIV-1, and also the Vpu protein from SIVcpz ANT,
which is representative of the more distantly related
viruses isolated from Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii

(Figure 1A) [24,30]. Both Vpu proteins were obtained as
EGFP fusion proteins, whose functionality in CD4
down-regulation assays had previously been demonstrated [31]. Confocal microscopy revealed that the cellular distribution of GAB1 and ANT Vpu-EGFP (Figure
1B) resembled that which has been reported for HIV-1
Vpu [31,32]. In addition, both GFP and YFP fusion proteins of HIV-1 Vpu have previously been shown to
retain anti-tetherin activity [2,19,33], and we confirmed
the lack of effect of a C-terminal EGFP tag for HIV-1
Vpu by comparing the ability of Vpu and Vpu-EGFP to
increase HIV-1 VLP release when expressed in HeLa
cells (Figure 1C). Both proteins increased VLP release,
and although the untagged Vpu construct had greater
overall activity, this is likely a consequence of the higher
levels of expression from this human codon-optimized
construct. In contrast, neither of the two SIVcpz Vpu
proteins had any effect on VLP release.
Since species specificities have been noted in the
interaction between tetherin and viral anti-tetherin factors [9-11,13-15], we next examined whether the SIVcpz
Vpu proteins had activity against chimpanzee tetherin.
We expressed chimpanzee tetherin in human 293A cells
which, similar to other derivatives of 293 cells, do not
constitutively express human tetherin [2,3]. We found
that chimpanzee tetherin was able to suppress HIV-1
VLP release just as efficiently as human tetherin.
Furthermore, chimpanzee tetherin restriction was antagonized to a similar extent as human tetherin by both
the HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env proteins (Figure 2A).
However, neither of the SIVcpz Vpu proteins was able
to increase HIV-1 VLP release in the presence of chimpanzee tetherin (Figure 2B). To rule out any requirements for other chimpanzee cellular factors, we also
repeated these analyses by expressing chimpanzee
tetherin in a chimpanzee B cell line. Although the HIV1 Vpu protein remained active against chimpanzee
tetherin in this cell line, neither of the SIVcpz Vpus had
any activity (Figure 2C). Taken together, these results
indicate that the Vpu protein from SIVcpz is not an
antagonist of either human or chimpanzee tetherin.
SIVcpz Env does not have anti-tetherin activity

Other viral proteins in the primate lentiviruses that have
been reported to have anti-tetherin activity include the
Env proteins from HIV-2 and SIVtan [7,8,12] and the
Nef proteins from certain SIVs [9-11]. We examined the
possibility that SIVcpz Env had anti-tetherin activity by
generating HIV-1 VLPs in the presence of fragments of
SIVcpz genomes comprising the Env, Vpu, and Rev proteins, in a configuration that we have previously shown
can lead to expression of all three HIV-1 and HIV-2
proteins [7]. We performed these analyses on four additional SIVcpz isolates, spread throughout the lineage,

Vpu present only in SIVmus/mon/gsn sub-lineage and SIVden
Activity reported for calculated ancestral sequence derived from four SIVmus Vpu sequences

including MB897 and EK505 that are closely related to
HIV-1 subtypes M and N respectively, as well as MT145
and TAN3 which are more distantly related (Figure 1A)
[34,35]. Due to the lack of specific antisera against these
Env and Vpu proteins, we were only able to confirm the
expression of three out of four Env proteins from these
constructs (Figure 3A). None of the genomic fragments
we tested exhibited anti-tetherin activity, either against
endogenous human tetherin present in HeLa cells (Figure 3B), or in 293A cells transfected with chimpanzee
tetherin (Figure 3C). These data further confirm the
lack of activity of the SIVcpz Vpu proteins and, additionally, reveal that SIVcpz Env proteins are not antitetherin factors.
SIVcpz Nef counteracts chimpanzee but not human
tetherin

The absence of anti-tetherin activity in both SIVcpz Env
and Vpu proteins led us to examine the Nef protein,
since certain SIVs have previously been shown to have
activity against tetherins from their host species that is a
function of Nef (Table 1). We constructed Nef-EGFP
proteins from SIVcpz MB897 and EK505, as well as
from SIVmac239, since this has previously been
reported to be active against macaque, but not human

tetherin [9,10]. All three Nef-EGFP fusion proteins were
expressed, although we noted that the SIVmac239 protein was present at lower steady-state levels (Figure 4A).
We found that all three proteins were able to counteract
chimpanzee tetherin when expressed in human 293A
cells, with the least well expressed SIVmac239 protein
having the greatest activity. This indicates that for the
SIVcpz viruses, Nef fulfills the role of anti-tetherin factor (Figure 4B). In contrast, none of the Nef proteins
had activity against human tetherin expressed in the
same cells (Figure 4C). This finding agrees with observations recently reported by Sauter et al., who demonstrated that other SIVcpz isolates, including
SIVcpzGAB1 and ANT, also contain a functional antitetherin activity in their Nef proteins [36].
The specificity of SIVmac Nef for macaque, but not
human tetherin, has previously been reported to be conferred by the presence of 5 additional residues in the
cytoplasmic tail of macaque tetherin, G/D-DIWK [9,10].
We asked whether this same sequence was responsible
for the specificity observed in the SIVcpz Nef proteins
by creating a chimeric human tetherin containing an
insert of the equivalent chimpanzee residues, H(+5)tetherin (Figure 5A). We confirmed that H(+5) was
expressed (Figure 5B) and fully functional in suppressing

VLP release in presence of Vpu is shown relative to baseline (control) levels in absence of Vpu for three independent experiments, except for the
HIV-1 Vpu-EGFP sample (n = 1).

virus release when transfected into 293A cells (Figure
5C). The presence of these 5 additional residues was
sufficient to make human tetherin a target for both SIVmac239 Nef and the SIVcpz Nef proteins (Figure 5C),
indicating that the observed species specificity of the
interaction between the SIVcpz Nef proteins and
tetherin involves the same target sequence as SIVmac
Nef.

Anti-tetherin activity of SIVsyk Vpu

Certain members of the SIVsyk lineage express Vpu,
specifically those from the SIVmus/mon/gsn sub-lineage
[25-27], and also the SIVden isolate [28] (Figure 6A).
We analyzed the anti-tetherin activity of Vpu proteins
from representatives of each of these four groups within
the SIVsyk lineage. Each SIV Vpu was constructed as an
EGFP fusion protein, and the expression of each protein

was analyzed by Western blotting, where we observed
some differences in steady-state levels (Figure 6B). We
analyzed their activity against both human and macaque
tetherin, since macaques are more closely related to the
Old World primate hosts of these viruses. Macaque
tetherin has previously been shown to be resistant to
HIV-1 Vpu, but counteracted by SIVmac239 Nef [9,10]
and HIV-2 Env [9], and we confirmed these specificities
(data not shown). Anti-tetherin activity was assessed in
both HeLa cells, (Figure 6C), and in macaque LLCMK2
cells transiently transfected with macaque tetherin (Figure 6D). We found that all four SIV Vpu proteins were
able to counteract the inhibition of VLP release caused
by macaque tetherin, which is in agreement with a
recent report [36]. We cannot rule out that the greater

activity of the SIVmus and SIVgsn Vpu-EGFP proteins
could arise from their higher expression levels. In contrast, only the Vpu from SIVgsn (strain 99CM71)
showed activity against human tetherin. Our finding of
activity against human tetherin in this SIVgsn isolate is
the first report of such an activity in a naturally occurring SIV Vpu protein.
To address whether the lack of activity of the Vpu
proteins from SIVmus/mon/den in HeLa cells was
caused by incompatibility between their Vpu proteins
and human tetherin or, instead, reflected some other
differences between human and macaque cells, we
repeated these analyses expressing human tetherin in
LLCMK2 cells. Similar to our findings in HeLa cells we
observed that only SIVgsn Vpu had activity against

human tetherin in this cell background (Figure 6E).
SIVgsn 99CM71 Vpu is therefore an example of a naturally existing protein from a non-human primate lentivirus that has activity against human tetherin.
Specificity of interaction between SIVsyk Vpu proteins
and tetherin

Since the SIVsyk Vpu proteins displayed species specificities in their interactions with tetherin, we asked whether
this mapped to the same region of tetherin responsible
for the specificity of interaction with SIVmac and SIVcpz
Nef proteins, by examining their activity against the chimeric protein H(+5)-tetherin (Figure 5A). In contrast to

the situation with the SIVcpz Nef proteins, where the
addition of these amino acids to the cytoplasmic tail of
human tetherin conferred sensitivity (Figure 5C), we
found that the H(+5)-tetherin remained resistant to all of
the SIVsyk Vpu proteins except SIVgsn (Figure 7A),
which was unsurprising, given its activity against both
human and macaque proteins (Figure 6).
The species-specificity of the interaction between the
HIV1 Vpu protein and tetherin has been mapped to the
TM domain of both proteins [2,3,9,13,15,16]. We therefore replaced both the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail and
TM regions of human tetherin with the corresponding
macaque sequences to create MH tetherin (Figure 7B)

and confirmed protein expression (Figure 7C). We
observed that all of the SIVsyk Vpu proteins, but not
HIV-1 Vpu, had activity against this chimeric protein
(Figure 7D). This suggests that, similar to the situation
with HIV-1 Vpu, the specificity of the interaction
between SIVsyk Vpu proteins and tetherin also maps to
the TM domain.
SIVgsn Vpu removes human tetherin from the surface of
HeLa cells

We next asked whether the SIVgsn Vpu was able to
remove tetherin from the cell surface, as we and others

have previously observed for HIV-1 Vpu and human
tetherin [3,14,16,20,33,37]. As controls we also
included Vpu proteins from the SIVmus and SIVmon
strains that were not active against human tetherin.
Confocal analysis of cell surface tetherin on HeLa cells
transfected with Vpu-EGFP fusion proteins demonstrated the removal of tetherin by only the HIV-1 and
SIVgsn Vpu proteins (Figure 8A), and FACS analysis
confirmed these observations (Figure 8B). Therefore,
the ability to counteract human tetherin correlates
with its removal from the cell surface for both HIV-1
and SIVgsn Vpu.

Discussion
The primate lentiviruses exhibit a high degree of flexibility in their ability to counteract the BST-2/tetherin
restriction of virus release. To date, three different proteins (Vpu, Env and Nef) have been shown to act as
anti-tetherin factors in different primate lentiviruses,
which highlights the importance of an anti-tetherin
activity for their life-cycle. The HIV-1 Vpu protein is
the prototypical anti-tetherin factor, and the observation
that mature virions remain attached at the cell surface if
tetherin is not counteracted was first observed for Vpu-

minus HIV-1 [38]. The paradox of such an activity
being associated with a protein that is not present in the
genome of the other lineage of lentiviruses that infect
humans, HIV-2, was resolved when a virus releaseenhancing activity was mapped to the HIV-2 Env protein [8,39]. More recently, several different strains of
SIV have been shown to carry anti-tetherin activities in
either Nef or Env proteins [9-12,36].
The Vpu open-reading frame is not unique to HIV-1
but is also present in all other members of the SIVcpz/
HIV-1 lineage. In addition, certain members of the

Yang et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:13
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/13

SIVsyk viruses (the SIVgsn sublineage and SIVden)
code for Vpu. We therefore asked the question, if Vpu
is present, does it always exhibit anti-tetherin activity?
Interestingly, despite the close relationship between
HIV-1 and the SIVcpz viruses, we found that the Vpu
proteins from SIVcpz do not have activity against
either chimpanzee, macaque or human tetherin.
Instead, we determined that these viruses have evolved
to target chimpanzee tetherin using their Nef protein,
a finding that has also recently been reported [36]. In
this way, these viruses are more similar to other SIV
strains, specifically SIVsm/mac and SIVagm, that also
possess anti-tetherin activities in Nef [9-11]. Primate
tetherins, including chimpanzee, macaque and African
green monkey, differ from the human protein by having an additional sequence of 5 amino acids (G/DDIWK) in their cytoplasmic tail, which has previously
been shown to be necessary for SIVmac Nef to counteract primate tetherins [9,10]. Similarly, we have now
confirmed that this motif is also essential for the
recognition of primate tetherins by SIVcpz Nef proteins. It therefore seems likely that the use of Vpu by
HIV-1 and Env by HIV-2 was necessitated, in part,
because Nef cannot easily target human tetherin in the
absence of this motif.
The fact that SIVcpz strains maintain the Vpu ORF,
despite its lack of activity against chimpanzee tetherin,
probably reflects the fact that Vpu is a multi-functional
protein [29]. Indeed, down-regulation of CD4 by SIVcpz
Vpu proteins has been confirmed by others [31,36,40].
Thus, Vpu’s ability to target CD4 is well conserved in
the SIVcpz/HIV-1 lineage, while the anti-tetherin activity may be a more recently acquired, or re-acquired,
activity in the viruses that infect humans.
In contrast to the situation with SIVcpz, we found
that Vpu proteins from the SIVsyk viruses are capable
of antagonizing tetherin restriction. Within the SIVsyk
lineage, there is a close phylogenetic relationship
between the SIVmus/mon/gsn viruses, which form a
separate sublineage termed SIVgsn [24,26,28]. A less
closely related virus, SIVden, also expresses Vpu,
although the protein is 10 amino acids shorter than Vpu
from the SIVmus/mon/gsn viruses [28]. Representative
Vpu proteins from all four groups of viruses were tested
and found to be capable of overcoming the restriction
mediated by macaque tetherin. Consistent with our
observations, Lim et al. have also found that SIVmus
Vpu antagonizes African green monkey and mustached
monkey tetherins [11]. In addition, while this manuscript was in preparation, Sauter et al. also reported that
SIVmus/mon/gsn Vpu proteins have anti-tetherin activities against host species-matched tetherins, with the
specificity determined by the TM domain of tetherin
[36].

Page 10 of 15

An interesting finding from our studies of the SIVsyk
lineage was that the Vpu protein from SIVgsn 99CM71
was also capable of antagonizing human tetherin. This
activity was confirmed by both confocal studies and
FACS analyses, where we observed that similar to the
HIV-1 Vpu, SIVgsn Vpu removed tetherin from the surface of human cells. The presence of an anti-tetherin
activity that is active against the human form of the protein in this SIVgsn virus supports the hypothesis that
the SIVcpz/HIV-1 lineage arose by recombination, with
the 5’-half of the genome originating from SIVrcm and
the 3’-half, that includes Vpu, deriving from the SIVgsn
sublineage [30,41]. Consequently, a recombinant ancestor of HIV-1 could have contained a Vpu protein with
some capability of targeting human tetherin. At the
same time, the lack of the G/D-DIWK motif in the cytoplasmic tail of human tetherin would have restricted the
adoption of Nef for this activity, as occurred in the
SIVcpz viruses. Since the interactions between Vpu and
tetherin are highly specific, [9,10,13-15], it is likely that
the acquisition of the ability to target human tetherin in
HIV-1 Vpu would have resulted in the loss of any ability
to target Old World primate tetherins, leading to the
present day restriction of HIV-1 Vpu’s activity for
human tetherin.

Conclusions
The ability to counteract tetherin restriction appears to
be an essential activity of primate lentiviruses. At least
three different proteins have evolved in different virus
backbones and host environments to target this host
cell restriction. Although several diverse SIVs use Nef to
target tetherin, including the SIVcpz viruses that are
closely related to HIV-1, the lack of a 5 residue
sequence in the cytoplasmic tail of human tetherin
makes it a difficult target for Nef. Possibly, this led to
the adoption of alternate anti-tetherin approaches in the
human immunodeficiency viruses based on Vpu (HIV-1)
and Env (HIV-2). For HIV-1, we speculate that the presence of anti-tetherin activity in the Vpu protein from
the SIVgsn ancestor that contributed the 3’-half of the
SIVcpz/HIV-1 genome allowed HIV-1 to evolve such an
activity in Vpu, and contributed to the ability of this
virus to successfully infect humans.

Figure 8 Ability of Vpu proteins to remove human tetherin from surface of cells. (A) HeLa cells were transfected with a control EGFP
expression plasmid, HIV-1 Vpu or Vpu-EGFP fusion proteins from SIVmus/mon/gsn isolates. Non-permeabilized cells were incubated with antiBST-2 antibody to reveal cell surface tetherin, followed by fixation and permeablization to visualize intracellular proteins. HIV-1 Vpu (untagged)
was used as a positive control for tetherin removal from surface and visualized with an anti-Vpu antiserum, while the SIV Vpu-EGFP proteins and
EGFP control were visualized using anti-GFP antibody. Both HIV-1 and SIVgsn Vpu proteins removed human tetherin from the cell surface, but
SIVmus and SIVmon did not. Vpu-expressing cells are arrowed. (B) HeLa cells were transfected with a control EGFP expression plasmid alone or
together with HIV-1 Vpu, or with each of the SIVmus/mon/gsn Vpu-EGFP expression plasmids. Cells were stained with anti-BST-2 antibody and
analyzed by FACS. The histograms show cells gated for EGFP expression, with the control EGFP expression vector cells in black, and Vpu samples

RPMI media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 10% FBS
and 2 mM glutamine.
Plasmids

Plasmid pHIV-1-pack expresses HIV-1 Gag-Pol and
Rev [7]. Plasmid pcDNA-Vphu (HIV-1 Vpu) encodes a
human codon-optimized form of Vpu from HIV-1 isolate NL4-3, kindly provided by Klaus Strebel (NIH)
[42]. Expression plasmids for the Env proteins from
HIV-2 (isolate ROD10, HIV-2 Env) and HIV-1 isolate
BH10 (HIV-1 Env) have been previously described [7].
Expression plasmids containing Vpu-EGFP fusion proteins from SIVcpz isolates GAB1 and ANT were kindly
provided by Edward Stephens (University of Kansas)
[31]. Vpu-EGFP fusion proteins from SIVmus
01CM2500
(GenBank:
ABO61057),
SIVmon
99CMCML1 (GenBank: AAR02384), SIVgsn 99CM71
(GenBank: AAM90227) and SIVden (GenBank:
CAE46404) were synthesized as human codon-optimized open-reading frames (Bio Basic Inc. Ontario,
Canada) and fused to EGFP by cloning into vector
pAcEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View CA). Fragments of SIVcpz genomes spanning the Vpu-Env-Rev
open reading frames (SIVcpz Env/Vpu) were PCR
amplified and cloned into the immediate-early CMV
promoter expression vector, pSA91. The SIVcpz isolates used were MT145 (GenBank: DQ373066; co-ordinates 5495 to 8436), MB897 (GenBank: EF535994; coordinates 5519 to 8369), EK505 (GenBank: DQ373065;
co-ordinates 5522 to 8346), and TAN3 (GenBank:
EF394358; co-ordinates 5603 to 8608), generously provided by Beatrice Hahn (University of Alabama). The
Nef proteins from SIVmac239 (GenBank: AAU14056),
SIVcpz MB897 (GenBank: ABU53024), and SIVcpz
EK505 (GenBank: ABD19500) were cloned as NefEGFP fusion proteins in vector pAcEGFP-N1. A
human BST-2/tetherin (Hum-tetherin) expression plasmid (pCMV6-XL5-Bst2) was obtained from Origene
(Rockville, MD), and the corresponding tetherin from
Pan troglodytes (Cpz-tetherin, GenBank: XP_512491),
was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the
human protein. Macaca mulatta tetherin (Mactetherin, GenBank: ACV96781) starting at methionine11, which corresponds to rBST2Δ10, and retains full
tetherin activity and sensitivity to SIVmac239 Nef [9],
was cloned by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from
LLCMK2 cells and inserted into vector pCMV6-XL5
(Origene). The chimeric tetherin H(+5)-tetherin is
human tetherin with the sequence DDIWKK replacing
amino acid E-14, while MH-tetherin comprises amino
acids 11-38 of M. mulatta tetherin spliced to amino
acid isoleucine-46 of human tetherin.

Production and analysis of HIV-1 VLPs

HIV-1 VLPs were generated from HeLa, 293A, or
LLCMK2 cells by transient transfection of 80-90% confluent cells in 10 cm plates with 8 μg of pHIV-1-pack,
together with any additional specified plasmids, using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The following amounts of plasmid DNA were used: 2 μg of
HIV-1 Vpu, HIV-1 BH10 Env, HIV-2 ROD10 Env,
SIVcpz Env/Vpu, SIVmus/mon/gsn/den Vpu-EGFP; 5
μg of HIV-1, SIVcpzGAB1, or SIVcpzANT Vpu-EGFP;
0.5 μg of SIVmac239 and SIVcpz Nef-EGFP. Cpz_B
chimpanzee cells were nucleofected using an Amaxa
Nucleofector series X (Amaxa, South San Francisco,
CA) using the pre-set program U-08. Cell lysates and
viral particles were collected 24 or 48 hours post-transfection and analyzed by Western blotting, as previously
described [43]. HIV-1 p24-reacting proteins were
detected using rabbit HIV-1SF2 p24 Antiserum (AIDS
Research and Reference Reagent Program, ARRRP) at a
1:3,000 dilution, followed by horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Specific proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham International,
Arlington Heights, IL). Exposed and developed films
were scanned and quantified using the public domain
NIH ImageJ software. The intensity of the CA-reacting
bands on the Western blots was measured and the ratio
of the signal in virions:lysates obtained. The foldenhancement of virus budding was calculated by normalizing all values to the pHIV-1-pack only control.
Western blotting

Expression of all Vpu-EGFP and Nef-EGFP fusion proteins was detected by Western blotting of cell lysates
using rabbit anti-GFP at a 1:1000 dilution (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc.). Env expression from the SIVcpz
subgenomic constructs was detected using rabbit antiHIV-2 Env antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution (ARRRP).
Expression of the various tetherin constructs was
detected using rabbit anti-BST-2 at a 1:30,000 dilution
(ARRRP, from Klaus Strebel). Actin was included as a
loading control, and detected using a mouse anti-actin
antibody (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at a dilution of
1:15,000. Secondary antibodies used were HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at a 1:10,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc) or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a 1:
10,000 (Sigma Aldrich).
Confocal microscopy

HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of Vpu-EGFP
expression plasmids in 10 cm plates, then 18-24 hours
later, seeded on coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine
(Sigma Aldrich). The cells were incubated for an

Yang et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:13

additional 24 hours at 37°C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature, washed three
times in PBS and subsequently permeabilized for 10
minutes in 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature, followed by washing three times in PBS. Processed cells
were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent with
DAPI (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). For analysis of
tetherin surface expression, HeLa cells were transfected
with 2 μg of HIV-1 Vpu or SIVmus/mon/gsn VpuEGFP expression plasmids in 10 cm plates, then 18-24
hrs later, seeded on coverslips as described above, and
incubated at 4°C for 20 minutes. Cells were processed
for surface tetherin staining by incubation with fresh
media plus a polyclonal mouse anti-BST-2 antibody
(Abnova, Walnut, CA) at a 1:150 dilution, at 4°C for 30
minutes, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature, and washed
three times in PBS. To visualize intracellular Vpu proteins, cells were subsequently permeabilized for 10 minutes in 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature, washed
three times in PBS and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution
of rabbit anti-Vpu antiserum (ARRRP, from Frank Maldarelli and Klaus Strebel) or a 1:500 dilution of rabbit
anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen). Processed cells were
mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI.
Images were acquired using the PerkinElmer Ultraview
ERS laser spinning disk confocal imaging system at
100× magnification (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and
processed using Volocity software (Improvision) and
Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2.
Flow cytometry

HeLa cells were transfected with an EGFP expression
plasmid alone (500 ng), or with 2 μg of HIV-1 Vpu or
SIVmus/mon/gsn Vpu-EGFP plasmids. Twenty-four
hours later, cells were blocked by incubation in 1%
BSA/PBS for 20 minutes at 4°C and stained with rabbit
anti-BST-2 antiserum (ARRRP, from Klaus Strebel) at a
1:5,000 dilution for 30 minutes at room temperature,
followed by washing in PBS and incubation with goat
anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alexa fluor 647 (Invitrogen) at a 1:200 dilution for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were analyzed with a FACS CantoII (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and 30,000 events were collected. Data analyses were performed using FlowJo 6.2
software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
