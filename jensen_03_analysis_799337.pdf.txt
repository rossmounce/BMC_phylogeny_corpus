Abstract
Background: For most sequenced prokaryotic genomes, about a third of the protein coding genes
annotated are "orphan proteins", that is, they lack homology to known proteins. These hypothetical
genes are typically short and randomly scattered throughout the genome. This trend is seen for
most of the bacterial and archaeal genomes published to date.
Results: In contrast we have found that a large fraction of the genes coding for such orphan
proteins in the Methanopyrus kandleri AV19 genome occur within two large regions. These genes
have no known homologs except from other M. kandleri genes. However, analysis of their lengths,
codon usage, and Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS) sequences shows that they are most likely true
protein coding genes and not random open reading frames.
Conclusions: Although these regions can be considered as candidates for massive lateral gene
transfer, our bioinformatics analysis suggests that this is not the case. We predict many of the
organism specific proteins to be transmembrane and belong to protein families that are nonrandomly distributed between the regions. Consistent with this, we suggest that the two regions
are most likely unrelated, and that they may be integrated plasmids.

Background
Typically, for a newly sequenced genome the number of
unique genes is mentioned. This is usually claimed to be
about one third of the annotated genes. However, this
number is highly questionable as random open reading
frames (ORFs) are often assigned as protein coding genes.
Based on an analysis of protein length distributions, we
have estimated the true number of genes in each of the
completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes [1]. Out of

the estimated number genes in microbial genomes, M.
kandleri contains the largest fraction of genes for which
function cannot automatically be assigned based on sequence similarity (see supporting information at end of
manuscript).
We have discovered that a significant fraction of these
genes are located within two large regions of the chromosome (see Figure 1). This is in constrast to what is

observed in other prokaryotes where genes of unknown
function are scattered throughout the genome. This organization of genes into large clusters would suggest that
the proteins encoded by these genes are likely to represent
novel protein complexes or biochemical pathways [2].
Pre-genome analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA had suggested
M. kandleri to be placed close to the root of the Euryarchaeal tree. However, phylogenetic trees based on gene
content, gene order, and ribosomal proteins places it
toghether with the other archaeal methanogens [3,4]. It
thus comes as a surprise that its genome appears to contain large numbers of genes not present in the genomes of
any of the other sequenced archaeal methanogens. Furthermore, the M. kandleri genome has been claimed to
contain very few genes acquired through lateral gene
transfer [3]. It should however be noted that this claim
was entirely based on an analysis of proteins with BLAST
matches to sequences from other organisms. It is thus not
possible to exclude that the two regions of unknown func-

tion could been transferred from other species that have
not been characterized so far.

Results and discussion
To get an overview of the M. kandleri genome, we created
circular visualizations known as genome atlases [5–7].
Figure 1 shows a customized atlas which summarizes the
most interesting positional features of the M. kandleri genome: AT-content, predicted protein properties, and protein sequence similarity.
BLASTP searches of all predicted protein sequences in the
M. kandleri genome were performed against a number of
different databases. Comparison with SWISS-PROT was
used for identifying proteins homologous with possible
known function while a database of predicted archeal proteins was used for detecting conserved archeal proteins
possibly missing in SWISS-PROT. The results of these two
searches, as well as a search within the M. kandleri proteome, are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2
Comparison of protein length and codon usage for the unknown and known regions. (a) The length distributions of
annotated proteins is visualized as Gaussian kernel density estimates. Based on the distributions we see no reason to suspect
that the protein sequences from the two unknown regions are the result of random ORFs. (b) No differences in the relative
usage of alternative codons for amino acids are observed between annotated CDSs from either of the two unknown regions
and CDSs annotated in the known regions. This strongly indicates that the majority of the annotated novel genes in the
unknown regions are true protein coding genes.

Figure 1 reveals two large chromosomal regions containing mostly protein coding genes without significant sequence similarity to genes from other organisms. The
smaller of the two regions, region I, is located at 1,063 kbp
(kilobase pairs) to 1,182 kbp and the slightly larger region
(1,231 kbp–1,390 k) will be referred to as region II. To rule
out that the genes within these regions are simply missing
from the databases mentioned above, a TBLASTN search
was performed against all sequences in GenBank. This resulted in no significant matches to DNA from other organisms than M. handleri itself.

tated are in fact not genes but merely random ORFs. As the
majority of such sequences are characterized by being very
short, this can be examined by studying the length distributions of annotated genes [1]. Figure 2(a) shows that the
210 genes annotated in the two regions follow distributions which are very similar to that of genes elsewhere in
the M. kandleri genome. The only possible difference is
that genes from region II tend to be slightly longer than
other genes. The length distributions thus give us no reason to suspect that the annotated genes should be
artifacts.

From the atlas visualization it is clear that region II (but
not region I) has a much lower AT-content than the genome average. The average AT-content is only 35.1% compared to the already low genomic average of 38.8%. An
atypical local base composition is often used as supporting evidence for lateral gene transfer, although it should
never be used alone [8].

However, region II has an extremely low AT-content which
can give rise to long random ORFs. It is therefore not possible, based on the length distributions alone, to completely rule out that the genes annotated in this region
could be random ORFs. To further investigate this, the codon usage of genes in the unknown regions was compared
to that of genes from known parts of the genome (Figure
2(b)). From the plot it is concluded that the codon preferences are identical in the unknown regions and other
parts of the genome, despite large differences in amino
acid composition (see below). Given this, we find it high-

Orphan proteins – not just ORFs
A very simple explanation for absence of homologous
proteins in the two regions would be that the genes anno-

ly unlikely that the annotated protein coding genes could
be random ORFs. Furthermore, the similarity in codon usage also speak against the two regions having been acquired through lateral transfer of DNA. A more plausible
explanation is that the two regions represent M. kandleri
plasmids which have been integrated into the main
chromosome.
Prediction of translation start
Discrimination between true protein coding genes and
random ORFs is not the only problem in prokaryotic gene
finding. Predicting the correct start codon is even more
challenging as the ATG corresponding to the longest possible ORF is not necessarily the actual start codon used [9].
In addition to analysis of codon usage, modelling of the
ribosomal binding site can also help determine the correct
translation start site. This has already been taken into account by the gene finder used for annotating the M. kandleri genome [10].

The consensus sequence for the ribosome binding site
(RBS) in an organism can generally be deduced from the
3' sequence of the 16S ribosomal RNA. In the M. kandleri
AV19 genome only one 16S rRNA sequence is annotated,
ending with the sequence CACCTC-3'. However, a sequence comparison with 16S sequences from the Ribosomal Database Project [11] revealed that the most closely
related sequences all end on CACCTCC-3'. As the first nucleotide after the annotated 16S rRNA in M. kandleri genome is indeed a cytosine, we suggest that the annotated
16S rRNA is missing one nucleotide. The corresponding
RBS consensus sequence would thus be GGAGGTG, the
reverse complement of the rRNA 3' end.
To further examine the RBS sequence, regions of 30 bp immediately upstream of each annotated coding region were
examined for overrepresented sequence patterns. Surprisingly, stretches of four to six guanines rather than the anticipated RBS consensus sequences turned out to be the
most significantly overrepresented patterns. The anticipated RBS sequence, GGAGG, was found to be significantly
overrepresented in the positive set at P < 10-6 while the
patterns GGGG, GGGGG, and GGGGGG were all significant at P < 10-10 or better. Figure 3 shows the positioning
of the patterns GGGGG and GGAGG relative to the annotated translation starts. While both patterns exhibit a clear
preference for occuring at a distance of 10 to 15 bp from
the start codon, this preference is strongest for the pattern
GGGGG. No difference in the RBS preference is observed
between the unknown and known regions, which is consistent with evidence against lateral gene transfer provided
by codon usage analysis.
That GGGGG is the most overrepresented pattern just upstream of translation start would suggest that it is the pre-

ferred RBS sequence despite it not having perfect
complementarity to the 16S rRNA 3' end. The mismatch
between the 3'-end of the 16S rRNA and the most common RBS can easily be accommodated as it corresponds to
the wobble base pairing between guanine and uracil,
which is very common in RNA [12].
Protein families in M. kandleri
Although the vast majority of proteins from the two regions described earlier have no significant similarity to
proteins from other organisms, similarities exist among
M. kandleri proteins. Based on this, 45 M. kandleri specific
protein families were defined by Slesarev et al [3]. Several
of these protein families are non-randomly distributed between the two unknown regions and known regions: all
five members of the MK-10 protein family are encoded by
genes in region II while region I contains all five genes
encoding MK-9 proteins. Other protein families with
skewed occurences can be found in Table 1.

The pairwise similarities between members of the same
M. kandleri specific protein family gives rise to extensive
homology to other M. kandleri proteins as seen in Figures
1 and 4. Many of the protein families show a tendency to
be encoded by clusters of genes occurring on the same
strand, e.g. the MK-5, MK-9, MK-10, and MK-28 families
labelled in Figure 4. This, combined with the fact that the
homology between proteins from the M. kandleri families
is strong enough to also be detectable at the DNA level,
suggest that the families are likely to represent recent gene
duplication events.
Properties of proteins from the unknown regions
The localization of different M. kandleri specific protein
families in the two unknown regions (Table 1) together
with the difference in AT-content (Figure 1) suggests that
the two regions should be studied separately. To do so,
linear zooms of the two regions were constructed (Figure
4).

Several striking subregions can be found within both of
the unknown regions. Region I is dominated by proteins
predicted to have N-terminal signal peptides, which
strongly suggests them to be secreted (see Figure 4). However, this is largely due to two very large proteins from the
MK-5 family located at 1,126 kbp to 1,136 kbp. In addition to this region, several other clusters of proteins predicted to have signal peptides are observed within both
region I and region II.
In addition to clusters of secreted proteins, several groups
of predicted transmembrane proteins are observed in
both regions – in particular region I. Some degree of
overlap is observed between proteins predicted to be
transmembrane and those predicted to have signal pep-

tides. The MK-9 protein family occurring exclusively within region I constitute one cluster of transmembrane
proteins (1,138 k–1,149 k). Similarly, the five members of
the MK-10 family in region II form a cluster of proteins
predicted to be transmembrane (1,375 k–1,382 k). Considering the special membrane of M. kandleri which con-

sists of a terpenoid lipid [13] and the extreme conditions
under which it lives, the presence of special membrane
proteins is hardly surprising.
Three of the MK-10 family proteins also contain low-complexity regions. In addition to these proteins, region II con-

tains an abundance of other low-complexity proteins that
are, however, not predicted to be transmembrane. Lowcomplexity regions often form unstructured non-globular
domains [14,15]. DNA binding proteins have previously
been shown to contain more low-complexity regions than
other proteins [16]. It is thus tempting to speculate that
some of the low-complexity proteins found in M. kandleri
could be involved in stabilizing DNA at extreme
temperatures.
Amino acid biases
Low-complexity regions are defined as regions with strong
bias towards one or more amino acid residues. It thus possible to further characterize regions of low-complexity by
studying which residues are overrepresented. Such biased
regions will often lead to an unusual amino acid composition of the protein as such.

We have compared the amino acid composition of proteins from each of the two unknown regions to that of
proteins from other parts of the chromosome. The amino
acid biases for the two regions are shown in Figure 5. The
residue with the strongest positive bias is tryptophan,
which is about 80% more frequent within the two regions
compared to elsewhere. Other residues found to be overrepresented are serine, proline, and leucine. Additionally,
arginine is more frequent in region II while threonine is
overrepresented in region I. Atlas visualizations of amino

acid composition revealed that these positive biases are
mainly due to single highly biased proteins, rather than a
general trend for the regions (data not shown).
Also, Figure 5 shows an underrepresentation of methionine in proteins from both regions, as well as a strong bias
against isoleucine and lysine in region II. In contrast to the
positive biases, the negative ones appear to be due to a relatively weak bias in the majority of the proteins. The residues found to be underrepresented in region II have in
common that they are encoded by AT-rich codons. This is
consistent with the lower AT-content of region II compared to the rest of the genome.
This leads to an interesting "hen and egg" problem: is it
the low AT-content of region II that is the cause of the biases in amino acid composition or vice versa? The lack of
a positive bias for amino acid residues encoded by GCrich codons would suggest the latter. This hypothesis is
further supported by an analysis of AT-content of intergenic regions within region II to that of intergenic regions
from other parts of the chromosome, which revealed no
significant difference according to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test [17].
A link between the amino acid compositions of proteins
and their thermostability has previously been suggested
by several groups [18–20]. There is little agreement

relate with thermostability. We therefore see no reason to
suspect proteins from either of the two unknown regions
to have different thermostability than other M. kandleri
proteins.

Conclusions
While claims of newly sequenced genomes containing
large numbers of unique proteins are often encountered,
the existence of these proteins is rarely backed up by anything but a gene finding method. While such spurious
gene predictions are typically scattered throughout the genome, we have discovered two distinct, large regions in
the genome of M. kandleri where only a small fraction of
the annotated genes share significant similarity with
known proteins from other organisms. Analysis of length
distributions and codon usage strongly suggests the presence of a large number of unique protein coding genes
within these regions and rejects the hypothesis that the
regions could have been aquired through lateral gene
transfer. Instead, we believe the most likely origin to be integration of plasmids. Extensive bioinformatics analysis
of the proteins encoded by these regions suggests many of
them to be transmembrane, but little else can be predicted
about their functions. Additional experimental data is
needed in order to learn more about these proteins.

Methods
The genome sequence and annotation of the M. kandleri
AV19 genome was downloaded from GenBank [21] along
with 13 other sequenced archaeal genomes (A. pernix, P.
aerophilum, S. solfataricus, S. tokodaii, T. acidophilum, T.
volcanium, A. fulgidus, M. thermoautotrophicum, M. jannaschii, M. acetivorans, M. mazei, P. abyssi, and P. horikoshii).

Amino acid compositional biases in the unknown
regions. The bias of each amino acid is represented by a bar
with length proportional to the log-ratio between its amino
acid frequency within one of the unknown regions and its frequency within known regions. Regions I and II are represented by gray and black bars respectively. The amino acids
have been sorted by their codon AT-content, which is both
listed and visualized as bars.

Sequence similarity searches
All sequence similarity searches were performed using
gapped BLAST with low complexity filter enabled [22].
The conceptual translations of all annotated protein coding genes in the M. kandleri genome were searched against
four different sequence databases: the M. kandleri proteome itself, SWISS-PROT [23], GenBank [21], and a set of
all annotated protein coding genes from the 13 other
sequenced archaeal genomes. In the BLAST results from
the search against the M. kandleri proteome, the self match
of each protein was discarded.

glutamine are generally found to be underrepresented
while arginine is overrepresented. Although this is consistent with the amino acid biases observed in region II, the
correlation is very weak as the strongest biases do not cor-

Prediction of protein properties
Protein properties were predicted from sequence using a
wide array of prediction methods. Low-complexity regions in the sequences were identified using SEG, which is
the program used by BLAST to mask such regions [24].
SignalP was used to predict signal peptides using the
model trained on eukaryotic proteins [25]. Transmembrane helices were predicted using the TMHMM method
[26]. These three protein features were the only that were

The other features tested for correlations were: grand average hydropathity [27], instability index [28], predicted

were performed. For every protein the negative logarithm
of E-value of the most significant match was calculated
(imposing a maximum score of 15 for highly significant
matches). These values were mapped to the chromosomal
location of the corresponding genes color coded so that
regions with many significant matches are colored whereas regions with few matches are gray.
The predicted protein properties were plotted by making
similar mappings of the predicted fractions of transmembrane and low-complexity residues in each protein. Signal
peptide predictions were represented by their mean Sscore [25]. All three sets of values were color coded using
a scheme so that only regions containing unusually many
secreted, transmembrane, and/or low-complexity proteins will be visible.

Finally, we include a circle showing the AT-content
(which is closely correlated to many DNA structural properties [6]). A double sided color scheme was used which
highlights regions of unusually high or low AT-content
compared to the average for the genome.
Length distribution plots
Protein length distributions for proteins from different regions of the M. kandleri were plottes as density estimates.
Rather than using simple histograms, Gaussian kernel
density estimates were calculated for log-transformed protein lengths. The widths of the Gaussian kernels were estimated based on the number of data points and their
spread [33]. The log-length density estimates were subsequently transformed back to yield ordinary length
distributions.
Calculation of codon usage and AT-content
For genes residing in the each of the unknown regions and
for genes from known regions, the codon usage was calculated by first counting the frequency of each of the 61
coding triplets. The triplets encoding each amino acid
were then normalized to a sum of one to cancel effects due
to the amino acid composition. We refer to these normalized frequencies as the codon usage. Applying the codon
usage estimated from all annotated protein coding regions as weighting factors, the average codon AT-content
for each amino acid was calculated as a weighted average
of the AT-content of all codons encoding the amino acid
in question.

RBS pattern search
The sequences located at positions -30 to -1 relative to
translation start were extracted for all annotated protein
coding genes. These sequence were used as positive
examples in the subsequent search. The sequences for positions -60 to -31, again relative to translation start, were
extracted for use as negative examples. All DNA words up
to a length of 10 bp were tested for significant overrepresentation in the positive examples relative to the negative
examples using a hypergeometric test as described by
Jensen and Knudsen [34].

Supporting information
To examine the fraction of genes with known function in
each of the sequenced prokaryotic genomes, the EUCLID
method was used for automatically assigning cellular role
categories to annotated proteins based on BLASTP matches to SWISS-PROT [22,23,35,36]. The number of proteins
in each genome for which a category could be assigned
was compared to our estimate of the number of protein
coding genes in the genome [1]. Table 2 shows the results
of this analysis, which reveals that M. kandleri is the genome for which function can be assigned to the smallest
fraction of the estimated number of protein coding genes.
This is largely due to the two regions of unknown
function.
