Family structure and phylogenetic analysis of
odorant receptor genes in the large yellow
croaker (Larimichthys crocea)

Abstract
Background: Chemosensory receptors, which are all G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), come in four types:
odorant receptors (ORs), vomeronasal receptors, trace-amine associated receptors and formyl peptide receptor-like
proteins. The ORs are the most important receptors for detecting a wide range of environmental chemicals in daily
life. Most fish OR genes have been identified from genome databases following the completion of the genome
sequencing projects of many fishes. However, it remains unclear whether these OR genes from the genome
databases are actually expressed in the fish olfactory epithelium. Thus, it is necessary to clone the OR mRNAs
directly from the olfactory epithelium and to examine their expression status.
Results: Eighty-nine full-length and 22 partial OR cDNA sequences were isolated from the olfactory epithelium of
the large yellow croaker, Larimichthys crocea. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis classified the vertebrate OR genes into
two types, with several clades within each type, and showed that the L. crocea OR genes of each type are more
closely related to those of fugu, pufferfish and stickleback than they are to those of medaka, zebrafish and frog.
The reconciled tree showed 178 duplications and 129 losses. The evolutionary relationships among OR genes in
these fishes accords with their evolutionary history. The fish OR genes have experienced functional divergence, and
the different clades of OR genes have evolved different functions. The result of real-time PCR shows that different
clades of ORs have distinct expression levels.
Conclusion: We have shown about 100 OR genes to be expressed in the olfactory epithelial tissues of L. crocea.
The OR genes of modern fishes duplicated from their common ancestor, and were expanded over evolutionary
time. The OR genes of L. crocea are closely related to those of fugu, pufferfish and stickleback, which is consistent
with its evolutionary position. The different expression levels of OR genes of large yellow croaker may suggest
varying roles of ORs in olfactory function.

Background
Vertebrates can distinguish numerous odorants in the
environment using chemosensory receptors that are
expressed in the olfactory epithelium [1-3]. Four types
of chemosensory receptors have been found in the vertebrate olfactory epithelium, including the main odorant
receptors (ORs) [4], vomeronasal receptors (VRs) [5-7],
trace-amine associated receptors (TAARs) [8] and formyl peptide receptor-like proteins [9]. The OR genes
were initially identified in mouse olfactory organ by

Linda Buck and Richard Axel [4], who found that each
olfactory sensory neuron expressed a single OR allele
[4,10,11]. The ORs, located on the surface of dendrites
of sensory neurons on the olfactory epithelia, are the
most important chemosensory receptors in the detection
and perception of common odorants in the environment. Two types of VRs (V1R and V2R) that are located
in the vomeronasal organ in mammals are mainly
responsible for detection of pheromones. In fishes, ORs
and VRs are both distributed in the one olfactory organ
(there is no vomeronasal organ) [12,13]. The TAARs,
expressed in the olfactory epithelium, are responsible for
recognition of trace amines and related compounds
[8,14]. The formyl peptide receptor-like proteins that

are found in the vomeronasal organs in mammals have
an olfactory function associated with the identification
of pathogenic states.
The ORs are the most important chemosensory receptors in detecting environmental chemicals in daily life,
and they detect a wide range of compounds. A large
number of OR genes have now been isolated from various species. Approximately 1,068 putative functional
OR genes and ~334 pseudogenes in mouse [15,16],
~340 putative functional OR genes and ~388 pseudogenes in human [17-19] and ~100 OR genes in fishes
[20-22] have been identified from genome databases.
The vertebrate OR genes have recently been divided
into two major types, type 1 and type 2. The type 1
genes were subdivided into five groups, a, b, g, δ, ε and
ζ, and the type 2 genes into four groups, h, θ,  and l,
but the groups θ,  and l are considered to likely be
non-OR genes because they were identified from genome databases and found not to be expressed in the
olfactory epithelium [20,21]. Mammalian OR genes are
clearly classified into class I and class II [23]; here,
groups a and b correspond to class I and the group g to
class II [20,21].
Currently, the most fish OR genes have been identified
from genome databases. However, we do not know
whether these genes are really expressed in the fish
olfactory epithelia. So far, few experiments have been
carried out to validate the expression status of OR genes
in the fish olfactory epithelium. In addition, it is necessary to expand the knowledge of fish ORs, especially for
marine fishes, as the teleost fishes from which OR genes
have been reported so far are mostly not strict marine
fishes but freshwater, brackish or amphidromous.
The large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), an
economically important fish in China, belongs to the
family Sciaenidae of the order Perciformes and dwells
on the coast of the temperate zone in China. To clarify
the evolution of the L. crocea OR genes and to discover
whether they are expressed in the olfactory epithelium,
we cloned OR cDNAs from large yellow croaker by RTPCR on the olfactory organ and isolated full-length
cDNA using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE).
We then conducted phylogenetic analysis using these
OR genes and others from 11 vertebrate species and
determined the expression levels of the different subfamilies in wild-type fishes using quantitative real-time
PCR.

found in two sequences in comparison with the complete
cDNA sequence obtained at the same time from L. crocea
olfactory epithelium. One sequence had lost a start codon
and another had lost a few nucleotides in the region of
the 5’ primer, but the open reading frame of the both
sequences was not shifted (see additional file 1).
In teleost fishes, the numbers of OR genes are highly
variable. Table 1 shows the numbers of functional OR
genes from six fishes [20]. The zebrafish has the largest
number of functional OR genes (~154), and the pufferfish has the least (only 11). However, an accurate number of OR genes in different fishes remains unknown,
because some of the sequences in the genome database
of distinct species may be either intact or not completely included because of the limitation of sequencing
technology. L. crocea contains about 111 OR genes that
are expressed in the olfactory epithelium.

A functional gene is a sequence that does not contain nonsense or frame
shift mutation or long deletions and has initiation and stop codons at the
proper positions. All the large yellow croaker OR genes are inferred from
cDNA amplified from mRNA in the olfactory epithelium. Therefore, they are
considered as functional genes whether full-length or partial cDNA.

Phylogenetic analysis

A species tree was built using mitochondrial genomes to
elucidate the evolutionary relationships among 12 species, including 11 fishes and 1 amphibian (Figure 2).
The species tree was in an excellent agreement with a
previous study [24]. Amphioxus [25], which diverged
from the vertebrates perhaps 550 million years ago
(MYA), was used to root the tree. Figure 2 clearly shows
the evolutionary processes among the 12 species. The
large yellow croaker is more closely related to fugu, pufferfish and stickleback than it is to medaka, salmon,
trout, zebrafish and goldfish.
An OR gene tree was constructed using the relevant
OR genes from large yellow croaker and 11 other species (frog, zebrafish, goldfish, Atlantic salmon, cutthroat
trout, sea trout, rainbow trout, medaka, stickleback, pufferfish and fugu; Figure 3). Two representative OR genes
from amphioxus that are highly divergent from vertebrate OR genes were used to root the tree [20,26]. The
phylogeny shows the relationships between the species,
with branch lengths proportional to the number of
expected substitutions per amino acid site. From this
analysis and the criteria set forth by previous studies
[20,21], the OR genes from these species could be classified into two major groups, the type 1 and type 2 genes
(Figure 3). The type 1 genes are subdivided into four
groups, b, δ, ε and ζ, and the group δ is further split
into two subgroups (δ1 and δ2). Groups a and g of type
1, which are present in amphibians, reptiles, birds and
mammals and absent in fish except for one intact gene
in zebrafish and a few pseudogenes in medaka and stickleback, were not included in the phylogenetic analysis.

Type 2 only contains group h in this study. Thus, five
groups (b, δ, ε, ζ and h) were included in the phylogenetic tree. Five clades (A, C, D, F and G) of L. crocea
OR genes were assigned to group δ (δ1 and δ2 ), three
clades (I, J, K) were assigned to group h, and clade E
was assigned in the group b.
To further analyze the evolutionary processes and
infer the OR gene duplications and losses among these
different fishes, a reconciled tree was constructed using
Notung 2.6 [27,28] based on the above gene and species
trees (Figure 4). The tree shows 178 duplications and
129 losses. Some lost OR genes from unknown species
were inferred, and these species were not included in
this study owing to the limitations of the current OR
gene database.
From the above phylogenetic analysis, we can see that
the L. crocea OR genes are more closely related to those
of fugu, pufferfish and stickleback than they are to
medaka, zebrafish and frog (Figures 3, 4). The evolutionary pattern of the OR genes thus corresponds to the
phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genome
sequences. Each subfamily of OR genes evolved from
common ancestral genes and was expanded in extant
species. Many genes have duplicated, and many have
been lost.
Functional divergence among fish OR genes

Gu [29-31] has developed a statistical method to test the
significance of Type I and Type II functional divergence
between duplicate genes. Type I divergence results in sitespecific rate shifts after gene duplication, and Type II
divergence results in site-specific property (hydrophobicity

and hydrophilicity) shifts. We used the software DIVERGE
2.0, which uses this method [32-34], to analyze the
inferred OR protein sequences, and to infer the functional
divergence of OR proteins and to predict the amino acid
site changes involved in functional divergence among
sequences. The results indicate that the functional divergence among subgroups of odorant receptors is of Type I
(Table 2). The coefficient of Type I functional divergence
between duplicate genes, denoted θML, is defined as the

probability of functional divergence. A large value of θML
indicates a high level of Type I functional divergence, and
vice versa. Figure 5 shows posterior probabilities of functional variation of amino acid residues. The variation sites
with posterior probability larger than 0.7 are highlighted
in the three-dimensional structure of an odorant receptor
shown.
The analysis of group δ1 ORs suggests that the level of
functional divergence between clades C and D (θML =

0.54) is higher than that between clades C and A (θML =
0.48), and the functional divergence between clades A
and D is the lowest in the pairwise comparisons (θML =
0.31). The value of θML between clades F and G in δ2 is

0.49, which means that these two groups of genes have
evolved different functions. Only one clade of OR genes
was found in the group b, and it was clustered with the
group ζ and ε in the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3).

The statistical results represent functional divergence among different clades
in each group. θML represents the coefficient of Type I functional divergence;
SE θML is the standard deviation of θML.

The level of functional divergence between groups b and
ζ (θML= 0.27) is higher than that between groups b and
ε (θ ML = 0.17), but the functional divergence between
groups ζ and ε is the highest (θML= 0.31) among these
three groups.
The type 2 genes are more diverse than type 1. Three
clades of OR genes in group h were included in this
study. These clades were analyzed in pairwise comparison to predict the functional divergence. The results
showed that the θML values generated by pairwise comparison among the three clades were 0.37 (I/K), 0.51 (I/
J) and 0.40 (K/J) (Table 2). This suggests that all three
clades have experienced functional divergence and have
evolved different functions from their ancestors.
However, the sequences in the same clade were found
to be highly conserved. The OR genes from different
species in the same clade may perform similar functions,
for example, detecting similar chemicals.
Expression levels of OR genes in the L. crocea olfactory
epithelium

Sixteen pairs of primers were designed according to the
sequences in each clade (A-K) to detect the expression
levels of OR genes using quantitative real-time PCR. To
evaluate whether each pair of primers conform to the
efficiencies within the range 0.9-1.1, their efficiencies
were examined by establishing standard curves based on
regression analyses of the Ct (Cycle threshold) value
versus the log value of 10-times dilution of each target
gene (Copies) for each pair of primers (see additional
file 2). The primers that had efficiencies within the
range 0.9-1.1 were used in quantitative real-time PCR.
The average Ct values of each gene expression
obtained by real-time PCR are shown in additional file
3. The mRNA copies were calculated according to the
Ct values and the standard curves. Expression of each
target gene was normalized to the housekeeping control
gene b-actin. The results showed that the different
clades of OR genes have distinct expression levels (Figure 6). Comparisons between groups were tested by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The OR genes
in clade K (k1 and k2) in group h were expressed at the
highest levels of all groups (P < 0.001), followed by the
clade c1, c2 and g2 within group δ, and then clade i1 and

i2 within group h in decreasing order, but no significant
differences were found between each other. The expression levels of genes in clades a2, c3, d, f, g1 and g3 were
similar (P > 0.05), but they were significantly lower than
those of the above clades (P < 0.05). The expression
levels of OR genes in clade a1 is twice as high as that in
clade a 2 (P < 0.01). The OR genes in clade e within
group b were expressed at the lowest level among all
groups (P < 0.001). These results suggest that the OR
genes in the clade K are expressed at the highest level
in the olfactory epithelium, and OR genes in clade e
were expressed at the lowest level.

Discussion
Variable numbers of fish OR genes

The numbers of OR genes in teleost fishes are highly
variable: zebrafish has the largest number of functional
OR genes of all the fishes, the large yellow croaker and
stickleback have ~100 OR genes, fugu has ~50 and the
pufferfish has ~11. From these data, we can see the
numbers of OR genes vary 2- to 10-fold among these
teleost fishes. The numbers of tetrapod OR genes are
much higher; for example, ~1000 functional OR genes
were identified from the genome in mouse, ~800 in frog
and ~340 in human. Most mammalian OR genes in
group a and group g are thought to be airborne substance receptors [20,21]. The conservation of OR genes
in mammals is higher than that in fishes [22], and it
may be that the mammals evolved more OR genes to
adapt to the environment on the land [20].
The evolutionary pattern of fish OR genes

OR genes originated at a very early time in chordate
evolution, before appearance of amphioxus, which
diverged from its most recent common ancestor with
vertebrates 550 MYA [25,26]. The vertebrate OR genes
have evolved into different families and subfamilies from
their ancestor. The type 1 and type 2 genes diverged
before the divergence of jawless and jawed vertebrates.
The seven groups (a, b, g, δ, ε, ζ and h) diverged at
around the separation of the jawless and jawed fishes.
The tetrapods evolved groups a and g, which were
absent in fishes, but they lost most of fish-like groups
(b, δ, ε, ζ and h) except in amphibians [20]. We have
clarified the evolutionary relationship of OR genes
among modern teleost fishes using phylogenetic analysis.
The results are consistent with previous reports
[14,20-22,32]. The OR genes of extant teleost fish
evolved from the common ancestor of Actinopterygii
(ray finned fish) [22]. The OR gene relationships among
extant teleost fishes fit with their evolutionary history of
the fishes. The large yellow croaker, fugu, pufferfish and
stickleback are close evolutionary relatives, and thus
their OR genes are more closely related to each other

than to those of other fishes in this study. Modern teleosts have inherited the OR genes and gradually
expanded genes from their common ancestors in the
process of speciation and duplication. However, in the
process of gene duplication, some genes were lost, as
shown in the reconciled tree (Figure 4). Some OR genes

have developed species-specific functions [33], but
others have been lost and pseudogenized. For example,
about 10-55% of OR genes in zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, fugu and pufferfish have become pseudogenes
[20]. Half the human OR genes have become pseudogenes and lost their function [17-19,34].

involved in functional divergence between each pair of
clades.
OR gene expression and functions

Figure 6 OR genes expression levels in the L. crocea olfactory
epithelium. The expression levels of OR genes from different clades
were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression levels
relative to the control gene b-actin were calculated using the
standard curve method and are reported on a log10 scale. The
letters a-k indicate clades.

In summary, extant teleost fishes inherited OR genes
from their common ancestors during speciation and
duplication. Some OR genes have been lost or pseudogenized during evolution. The fishes with close evolutionary relationships show a closer relationship between
their OR genes.
Functional divergence among OR families

Functional divergence is the process by which genes,
after gene duplication, shift in function from an ancestral function. It is thought that this process of gene
duplication and functional divergence is a major originator of molecular novelty and has produced many large
protein families that exist today [29,35,36]. Because of
this, it is desirable, from sequence analysis, to identify
amino acid sites that are responsible for functional
diversity. It is important to know the level of functional
divergence after gene (or genome) duplication, as well
as how many amino acid substitutions are involved in
functional innovations [29]. The OR genes have been
greatly expanded from their ancestral genes, and have
developed into one of the largest multi-gene families in
the vertebrates. The results of evolutionary divergence
analysis indicate that all subfamilies of OR genes have
functionally diverged from their most recent common
ancestors, and they have evolved new functions, because
the coefficient of functional divergence (θML) between
each pair of clades is significantly larger than 0. However, whether or not the different clades of OR genes
have different functions needs to be verified by future
experiments. Site-specific divergence can occur at some
amino acid residues (Figure 5). We suggest that the
amino acid sites (highlighted in the three-dimensional
structure in Figure 5) that show a posterior probability
of a functional shift of over 0.7 were the key sites

We have shown that ~100 OR genes are expressed in
the L. crocea olfactory epithelium. A previous study
found that only a small proportion of the mouse OR
genes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, and the
remaining OR genes are transcriptionally inactive [37].
Therefore, we inferred that many L. crocea OR genes
were not transcriptionally active, and that this is why
they were not isolated from the epithelium using RTPCR and RACE. For example, we do not find the groups
ε and ζ in L. crocea, even though they are present in the
other fish OR gene families. However, we plan to confirm this inference when genomic sequence information
is available. The different clades of OR genes are
expressed at different levels. The expression levels of
OR genes in the olfactory epithelium appears to control
the likelihood that a cDNA will be cloned [37]. The
higher the expression level of an OR gene, the easier it
will be to isolate it from the epithelium. We found that
two sequences, each with one disruption, are still transcribed in the L. crocea olfactory epithelium and inferred
that these two sequences may have lost their functions.
In a previous study, Zhang and Firestein [15] found,
from the available expression data for mouse OR genes
[38] and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) mouse expressed sequence tag (EST)
database, that some of the mouse OR sequences identified from genome databases with one or two disruptions
were still expressed in the olfactory organ. Other
researchers [37] found that a few pseudogenes were also
expressed in the mouse olfactory epithelium.
In previous studies, many researchers have shown
expression of teleost OR genes in the olfactory organ
using in situ hybridization [32,39]. More than 419 OR
genes were found to be expressed in the mouse olfactory epithelium, and some OR genes were expressed at
significantly higher levels than others [37]. Similarly, we
found in the large yellow croaker that different OR
genes have different expression levels; for example,
clades K (k 1 and k 2 ), c 1 , c 2 and g 2 were shown to be
expressed at high levels. However, whether these genes
have essential olfactory functions in L. crocea life needs
to be further verified. The previous report showed that
the monoallelic OR expression was achieved through a
mechanism in which OR protein functions in olfactory
neurons to abrogate expression of other OR genes [40].
Data from a number of previous studies also showed
that different OR genes, or even copies of the same OR
transgene in different genomic locations, are expressed
in different numbers of cells [41-43], but these studies
did not address the issue of transcript levels per cell.

Zhou et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:237
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/237

The fact that some OR genes are frequently chosen to
be expressed, and when chosen are expressed at high
levels per cell, is intriguing given each olfactory neuron’s
single-allele expression regime [37]. The transcription
level of OR genes is associated with control regions in
the genome locus. McIntyre et al. [44] found that
homeobox transcript factors such as Emx2 stimulated
the expression levels of OR genes in mouse, but it was
not certain whether the rule would also apply to fishes.
The regulation of OR gene expression is intriguing, and
it will be important to clarify the mechanism of gene
expression regulation. Whether OR gene expression is
correlated with the location of the genes in the genome
and what the regulatory mechanism of OR gene expression is in the fish olfactory system are questions awaiting further study. However, it is most important that
the expression of OR genes in fish must maintain the
basic abilities to survive in the environment.
The olfactory system uses a combinatorial receptor
coding scheme to encode odor identities [11]. Each
family of OR genes is mainly responsible for detecting
one class of similar chemicals. Many studies of OR
genes in human and mouse have revealed that one OR
can be activated by various chemicals, and OR genes in
the same subfamily might distinguish a similar class of
substance or a structural feature in substances [4,11,17].
Fish live in the water and frequently encounter watersoluble substances, and most ORs detect water-soluble
substances [39,45,46]. However, the specificity between
receptors and ligands has not been extensively reported
in fish. The question of whether or not each subfamily
of receptors is mainly responsible for detecting a specific
array of chemicals in fish awaits an answer.

Total RNA extraction and first-strand cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted and purified from approximately 100 mg olfactory epithelium tissue using Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen, California, USA), and was then treated with DNase I (0.1 unit per μg RNA) (Takara, Otsu,
Japan) to remove the residual DNA. The RNA quality
and quantity were determined using a NanoDrop ND1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc.,
Wilmington, DE, USA). First-strand cDNA synthesis
was performed using a PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara,
Otsu, Japan) following the user manual.
Amplification of OR genes

Nine pairs of primers for RT-PCR were designed
according to the conserved domain of fugu, pufferfish
and zebrafish OR genes (Table 3) to amplify cDNA that
had been reversely transcribed from mRNA isolated
from the olfactory epithelium. Amplifications were optimized in 50 μl reaction volumes containing about 50 ng
cDNA using a PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara, Otsu,
Japan). The annealing temperature is different for each
pair of primers. The PCR reaction condition were as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, then 30
cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 37-50°C for 35 s and 72°C for
47s, finally followed by an extension step at 72°C for 10
min.

We have shown that about 100 OR genes are expressed in
olfactory epithelium of large yellow croaker. The evolutionary relationships among teleost fish ORs accords with
the evolutionary history of the fishes themselves. The OR
genes of modern fishes duplicated from their common
ancestor and have been expanded during evolution. The L.
crocea OR genes are more closely related to those of stickleback, fugu and pufferfish than they are to those of
medaka, zebrafish and western clawed frog. The different
expression levels of the OR genes of the large yellow croaker suggest different roles in olfactory function.

Methods
Sample collection

One-year-old large yellow croakers (Larimichthys crocea) were collected from Xiangshan Bay in Zhejiang
province of China. The fish olfactory organs were dissected and preserved in RNAlater reagent (Ambion,
Texas, USA), and stored at -20°C until use.

Nine pairs of primers that could amplify OR genes are shown. The primers
were designed according to the conserved domain of fugu, pufferfish and
zebrafish OR genes. The primers were named according to the subgroup that
they amplify.

Obtaining full-length cDNA

Full-length cDNA of odorant receptor genes was obtained
through 3’ and 5’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE). Nested PCR was used in RACE, and the appropriate annealing temperature was chosen for each pair of
primers. The outer and inner primers for RACE were
designed by sequences obtained by RT-PCR. When
obtaining the sequences from results of the previous
RACE, the primers that were located closer to the 5’ or 3’
end of cDNA were designed to obtain longer sequences
and increase the sequencing accuracy. RACE was carried
out using a smarter RACE cDNA amplification kit (Takara
Bio, USA) and a 3’ full RACE core kit (Takara, Otsu,
Japan) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Cloning and sequencing of PCR products

PCR products were excised from agarose gels and purified using agarose gel DNA purification kit (Takara,
Otsu, Japan) before ligation to the PMD-18T vector
(Takara, Otsu, Japan) and transformation into Escherichia coli strain DH-5a (GIBCO/BRL, USA). More than
30 inserted clones identified by blue/white selection in
each plate were sequenced. DNA sequencing was supplied by Invitrogen. Each of the sequences obtained from
RT-PCR and RACE was translated into protein sequence,
and then used to search with BLASTP [47] against the
NCBI non-redundant database. When the best hit of a
given query was an OR gene from another species, we
considered the query sequence as an OR gene.
Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial proteins from 12
species

The mitochondrial complete genome sequences were
retrieved from GenBank. The accession numbers are
given in additional file 4. Twelve proteins expressed in
the mitochondrion from each species, concatenated into
one long sequence as a data set (3,639 amino acids),
were aligned using ClustalW [48] (see additional file 5).
The NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 gene was not used
in the analysis because of their heterogeneous base composition and consistently poor phylogenetic performance
[49]. The resulting alignments were analyzed using
Mrbayes 3.1.2 under the Mtmam model [50] with
gamma (G) distribution. The Markov chain reached a
stationary distribution after 1,000,000 generations with a
tree sampled every 100 generations in two runs. The
first 2,500 trees (25%) were discarded as ‘burn-in’ in
each run. The consensus tree was then built and the
posterior probabilities of the tree and its branches were
calculated based on 15,000 pooled trees.
Phylogenetic analysis of OR gene families

The amino acid sequences of functional OR genes,
including 109 from L. crocea and 121 related OR genes

Page 10 of 12

from one amphibian and 11 ray-finned fish (accession
numbers in additional file 4) were aligned using ClustalW [48]. The N- and C-termini of aligned sequences
was removed by hand (see additional files 6 and 7). Two
OR sequences of L. crocea were removed from the
adjusted alignment because they were found to be the
same as two other sequences after removal of the Nand C-termini. The resulting alignments were analyzed
using Mrbayes 3.1.2 [51] under the Poisson model of
sequence evolution for 10,000,000 cycles with a tree
sampled every 1,000 generations in two runs. The parameters set for the consensus tree and the posterior
probabilities of the phylogeny and its branches were as
same as in the construction of the mitochondrial tree
based on the 15,000 pooled trees from the two runs for
the two datasets.
Functional divergence analysis among specific groups

The functional divergence between specific clades was
analyzed using DIVERGE 2.0 [36], which can predict the
functional divergence of a protein family based on maximum likelihood and posterior probabilities. The closely
related subfamilies of OR genes based on phylogenetic
analysis were clustered together, and the full-length protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW. The results
were used to analyze the functional divergence between
each pair of clades and to infer the functional variation
of amino acid sites among the distinct OR subfamilies
using the method of Gu [29].
Quantification of OR gene expression

The quantification of L. crocea OR genes expression was
assayed using a real-time PCR instrument Mastercycler®
ep realplex (Eppendorf, Germany) with a SYBR Premix
Ex Taq™ II kit (Takara, Japan). The mRNA extracted
from the olfactory epithelia of large yellow croakers (n =
8) was assayed for OR gene expression. Sixteen pairs of
primers representing the different subgroups of OR
genes in the phylogenetic tree and one pair of b-actin
primers as a reference were designed as shown in additional file 2. To assess the efficiency of amplification,
standard curves were constructed using regression analyses of the Ct value versus the log value of 10-times
dilution of each target gene for each pair of primers.
The initial quantities of each OR gene for building the
standard curve were determined using a NanoDrop ND1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.,
Wilmington, DE, USA). Three steps of real-time PCR
were adopted. Briefly, denaturation at 95°C for 20 s,
then 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 59°C for 18 s, 72°C for
20 s. The number of copies of each OR gene were calculated according to the standard curve (see additional
file 2). The relative expression levels of OR genes were
normalized by the ratio of the copies of OR genes

Zhou et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:237
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/237

divided by the copies of b-actin, then the ratios were
log10 transformed. The relative expression levels (log10
transformed) of OR genes were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA.
GenBank accession numbers

All the L. crocea OR genes described in this study have
been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers: HQ424579-HQ424651 and HQ424653-HQ424690.
