Abstract
Background: Otopetrin 1 (Otop1) encodes a multi-transmembrane domain protein with no
homology to known transporters, channels, exchangers, or receptors. Otop1 is necessary for the
formation of otoconia and otoliths, calcium carbonate biominerals within the inner ear of mammals
and teleost fish that are required for the detection of linear acceleration and gravity. Vertebrate
Otop1 and its paralogues Otop2 and Otop3 define a new gene family with homology to the
invertebrate Domain of Unknown Function 270 genes (DUF270; pfam03189).
Results: Multi-species comparison of the predicted primary sequences and predicted secondary
structures of 62 vertebrate otopetrin, and arthropod and nematode DUF270 proteins, has
established that the genes encoding these proteins constitute a single family that we renamed the
Otopetrin Domain Protein (ODP) gene family. Signature features of ODP proteins are three
"Otopetrin Domains" that are highly conserved between vertebrates, arthropods and nematodes,
and a highly constrained predicted loop structure.
Conclusion: Our studies suggest a refined topologic model for ODP insertion into the lipid bilayer
of 12 transmembrane domains, and highlight conserved amino-acid residues that will aid in the
biochemical examination of ODP family function. The high degree of sequence and structural
similarity of the ODP proteins may suggest a conserved role in the intracellular trafficking of
calcium and the formation of biominerals.

Background
Otopetrin1 (Otop1) is the first described member of the otopetrin family, a novel gene family that encodes multi-

transmembrane domain proteins. The family was named
for the conserved role of Otop1 in the formation of otoconia and otoliths – "oto" (ear) and "petros" (stone). Oto-

conia are complex calcium carbonate biominerals in the
utricle and saccule of the vertebrate inner ear that are
required for the normal sensation of linear acceleration
and gravity. Degeneration or displacement of otoconia
can lead to vertigo and loss of balance [1-5]. Three mutant
mice and one zebrafish model with mutations in Otop1
have been described: tilted (tlt) [6]; mergulhador (mlh) [7];
inner ear defect (ied) [8]; and backstroke (bks) [9], respectively. All of these mutants lack otoconia or otoliths, but
have normal inner ear development. In zebrafish, the
morpholino knockdown of Otop1 phenocopies the tlt
mutation, showing otolith agenesis with no disruption of
the patterning of the developing inner ear [9,10].
The otopetrin family in most vertebrates studied consists of
three genes clustered in two chromosomal locations:
Otop1 (i.e., human Chr 4p16, mouse Ch5B2) and the paralogous tandem genes Otop2 and Otop3 (i.e., human
Ch17q24-25, mouse Ch11E2). Vertebrate otopetrins
share a conserved gene and protein structure, with no
homology to other transporters, channels, exchangers, or
receptors. A preliminary secondary structure prediction
based on the human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, and fugu protein sequences suggested a topology of ten transmembrane domains (TM) with cytosolic amino and carboxy
termini. Additionally, tBlastn searches in the EST and
genomic databases identified regions of homology with
the DUF270 domain in a number of arthropod and nematode proteins. DUF270 (pfam03189) is a 404 aminoacid consensus sequence of unknown function that
defines the DUF270 family, with members in C. elegans
and D. melanogaster. The two regions of maximum homology with DUF270 found in vertebrate otopetrins correspond to putative TM domains 3–5 and 9–10,
respectively, and were initially designated DUF270-I and
DUF270-II [7].
Here, we report a comparison of evolutionary constraint
and hydropathy profile analysis of 62 vertebrate otopetrins and arthropod and nematode DUF270 proteins,
demonstrating that the genes that encode these proteins
constitute a single family that we have renamed the Otopetrin Domain Protein (ODP) gene family. The refined
topologic model of the ODP proteins includes 12 putative
TM domains clustered into three "Otopetrin Domains"
(OD-I, -II, and -III, respectively), with a strong degree of
sequence conservation across widely divergent groups of
metazoa. These regions of highest homology and evolutionary constraint, including the FYR box in the cytoplasmic tail, may represent important functional subdomains. Biochemical studies in transfected cells show
that Otop1 modulates the manner in which cells handle
intracellular calcium in response to purinergic stimuli
[11]. The lack of known functional domains, such as ATPbinding domains, selectivity pores, or G-protein-binding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/41

consensus sequences, suggests that either the ODP family
has a novel function that significantly differs from the
activities of known channels, transporters, or receptors, or
that the ODP genes encode novel functional motifs. We
hypothesize that these motifs would likely occur within
the evolutionarily constrained regions, as has been shown
for other well-conserved gene families [12]. The challenge
remains to define the functional domains of the ODP
family, with sequence and analyses reported here providing a step in that direction.

Results and Discussion
Comparative sequence data set
The annotation of the Otop1, Otop2, and Otop3 genes in
the human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, and fugu genomes is
described elsewhere [7]. Orthologous otopetrin
sequences were generated using a targeted sequencing
approach (from dog, cow, armadillo and western clawed
frog) (see methods in [13,14]) or identified through
tBlastn searches of available whole-genome sequences.
The phylogenetic relationships of vertebrate otopetrin and
arthropod and nematode DUF270 genes were deduced
from a total of 62 complete or nearly complete open reading frames in 25 species (see Table 1 for a listing of the
specific species and accession numbers). Fragmentary, but
clearly otopetrin-related, sequences were also identified in
urochordates (ciona), echinoderms (urchin), and cnidarians (nematostella), however were not complete enough
to include in this analysis.
Phylogenetic relationships and revised nomenclature of
vertebrate otopetrins and arthropod and nematode
DUF270 genes
A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was created
from the multi-sequence alignment of each encoded protein (Figure 1). The vertebrate, arthropod, and nematode
sequences form distinct monophyletic groups, each containing three or more paralogous groups. This arrangement suggests that the ancestral metazoan genome may
have contained a single otopetrin-like gene, with subsequent duplications giving rise to the paralogs in the different phyla after the three lineages diverged. Based on the
positions in the tree of the named mouse and human
sequences, the three vertebrate paralogous groups correspond to Otop1, Otop2, and Otop3. Otop2 and Otop3
are more closely related to each other than either is to
Otop1, a clustering that parallels the genomic organization of the Otop genes in the vertebrate genomes. The
arthropod and nematode DUF270 sequences, in which
encoded proteins cluster independently in the tree from
the vertebrate otopetrin sequences, have been renamed as
otopetrin-like proteins (OTOPL), and the paralogous
groups have been assigned arbitrary letters. This is in
agreement with the HUGO gene nomenclature committee
guidelines for gene families and grouping [15]. Like verte-

brates, arthropods also have three paralogous groups of
OTOPLs. The grouping in nematodes is more complex:
there appears to be three major groups of OTOPLs, as in
vertebrates and arthropods, but each group itself contains
two or more paralogous groups as a result of species-specific gene duplications. In summary, vertebrate otopetrins
and arthropod and nematode OTOPL genes have been
grouped as a single family that we named collectively the
Otopetrin Domain Protein (ODP, see below) gene family.
Refined topological model for ODP insertion into the lipid
bi-layer
Conserved primary sequence is indicative of an underlying conserved tertiary structure, and the evolutionary
information contained in an alignment of related
sequences can be leveraged to improve predictions of
shared structures [16]. We took advantage of the deep
multi-sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree of the
ODP family to reexamine the predicted topology of the
ODPs (Figure 2A). A hydropathy profile was generated
that employs phylogenetic averaging [17] on hydropathy
scale values for amino acids [18] to improve the detection
of conserved hydrophobic regions, which might correspond to TM domains. The hydropathy profile revealed
12 strong hydrophobic regions, ten of which overlap with
the originally predicted TM domains [7]. Likewise, the
MEMSAT3 [19] and TMAP [20] algorithms, which take
into account leveraged evolutionary information, also
predicted 12 TM helices for ODP family members that
overlap well with the constrained regions and hydrophobic regions in our profile (Figure 2A).

The refined topological model for the ODP family thus
consists of 12 TM domains, with both the N- and C-termini in the cytosol, and in which the two newly identified
TM domains are TM4 and TM10, respectively. As shown in
Figure 2B, there are three discrete regions with maximum
evolutionary constraint among vertebrates, arthropods
and nematodes, which we have designated Otopetrin
Domain (OD) -I, -II, and -III, respectively. Among the TM
domains, TM2 and TM8 show the poorest conservation
and evolutionary constraint across species. On the other
hand, the loops connecting the TM domains show little
sequence conservation or evolutionary constraint,
strongly suggesting that the TM domains are the primary
functional regions of the ODP family (Figure 2A and
Additional file 1). Despite the poor loop sequence conservation, the number of amino acids in 8 of the 11 loops
separating TM domains is highly conserved (Table 2), suggesting that the spacing of most of the TM domains relative to one another may be important for the tertiary
structure and function of ODP family members. Of note,
the length of loop 5, within OD-I, is highly variable across
all phyla, but conserved in vertebrates (48 ± 4 amino acid
residues), as are all other loops except for loop 10.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/41

Homology between Otop and OTOPL sequences extends
beyond the canonical DUF270 domain
DUF270 (pfam03189) is a 404 amino-acid consensus
sequence of unknown function. Early tBlastn-based database searches identified regions of homology with the
DUF270 domain in both vertebrate Otop and arthropod
and nematode OTOPL proteins [7], now grouped
together as the ODP family. Inspection of the multi-species ODP sequence alignment suggests that the homology
among ODP proteins extends beyond the canonical
DUF270 domain (see Additional file 1). Specifically, the
N-terminal end of the DUF270 consensus sequence can
be extended to include three amino acids (HAG, amino
acids 125–127 in mouse Otop1) that are conserved in
most vertebrate (HAG) and nematode (GAG) ODPs
examined. At the C-terminal end, the amino-acid conservation continues well beyond the DUF270 motif to
include the entire C-terminal tail of vertebrate Otop
(amino acids 584–600 in mouse Otop1). A 14-aminoacid consensus sequence for this highly conserved C-terminal tail, which we named the FYR box, is shown in Figure 3. The FYR box is a signature unique to the ODP
family, and is present in all ODP proteins but not in any
non-ODP sequences in the databases of ESTs and nonredundant sequences.

Conclusion
Comparative analyses of vertebrate otopetrins and arthropod and nematode OTOPL proteins revealed that they all
share a TM domain structure and significant conservation
of amino-acid sequence, suggesting that they constitute a
single protein family, here renamed the ODP family. We
have expanded the domains of homology to more accurately reflect the extent of sequence conservation between
vertebrates, arthropods and nematodes, and have identified three evolutionarily constrained TM domain-rich
areas that we have designated as Otopetrin Domains.
OD-I and OD-III are the most highly conserved regions of
the ODP family. Tlt mice carry a missense mutation
(Ala151→Glu), which alters the hydrophobicity of the predicted TM3 domain within OD-I, and leads to a presumed
alteration in the membrane insertion or activity of Otop1
and otoconial agenesis [7]. The OD-II evolutionarily constrained region was not identified in the initial modeling,
but mutations in Otop1 within this conserved segment of
the protein have been shown to cause otolith/otoconial
agenesis in bks mutant fish (Glu429→Val) [9] and in mlh
mutant mice (Leu408→Gln) [7] (Figure 2B), suggesting
that this region is functionally important.
Initial modeling of the OTOP proteins suggested a 10 TM
domain model with cytosolic N- and C-termini [7]. This
model had several problems, including that sites consistent with the consensus sequence for N-glycosylation were

predicted to be cytosolic. The 12 TM domain model predicted by hydrophobicity and evolutionary constraint
analysis places the proposed glycosylation sites in the
extracellular space (Figure 2B), and suggests that it may
reflect a more accurate version of OTOP insertion into the
lipid bilayer. Interestingly, the missense mutations in the
tlt, mlh, and bks animal models, which lead to functional
loss of OTOP1 activity, each occur within highly conserved transmembrane domains; such mutations often
alter the hydrophobicity of the conserved TM domain,
which may lead to alterations in the ability of the protein
to insert and orient in membranes.
Otop1 is required for the formation of vertebrate otoconia,
a process that involves calcium carbonate biomineralization and requires the regulation of intracellular calcium.
Biochemical studies in transfected cells show that OTOP1
modulates the manner in which cells handle intracellular
calcium in response to purinergic stimuli [11]. The mechanisms of calcium carbonate biomineralization are highly
conserved in the development of otoconia and otoliths in
the vertebrate inner ear, the formation of the avian egg-

shell, the mineralization of the arthropod exoskeleton,
and the development of other mineralized structures such
as the mollusk shell [21-23]. There is evidence that some
ODP family members are expressed in tissues associated
with calcium secretion and calcium carbonate-based mineralization. In particular, ESTs from Callinectes sapidus
(Blue crab) reveal strong expression of the D. melanogaster
OTOPLb ortholog in hypodermal tissues that are required
for calcium mobilization during the mineralization of the
chitinous exoskeleton [24]. ODP mRNAs are also
expressed in the hemocytes of various invertebrate species, which have been associated with the development of
mineralized structures in mollusks [25]. In mammals,
Otop1 is expressed in the lactating mammary gland [7],
perhaps functioning in the secretion of calcium into milk.
Taken together, the sequence homology, structural constraint, and expression pattern suggest a conserved role for
members of the ODP family in the formation of mineralized structures. Further examination of ODPs and continued characterization of natural and induced mutations in
these proteins through both physiologic and topologic
studies may assist in better understanding the mechanisms of establishing and maintaining mineralized structures throughout the animal kingdom.

Methods
Sequence collection
Orthologous Otopetrin sequences were generated by a targeted sequencing approach, or identified through tBlastn
searches of available whole-genome sequences. For the
targeted sequencing, BAC clones were isolated from the
following libraries maintained by the BACPAC Resources
Center [14,26,27]: dog (Canis familiaris; RPCI-81), cow
(Bos Taurus; CHORI-240), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus; VMRC-5), and western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis;
CHORI-216). Specifically, each library was screened using
pooled sets of oligonucleotide-based probes designed
from the established sequence of the mouse Otop1 or
Otop2/Otop3 subloci (on mouse Ch5B2 and Ch11E2,
respectively). After isolation and mapping, a total of four
BACs (accession numbers AC148430, AC149469,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:41

AC147459, and AC166187) were shotgun sequenced and
subjected to sequence finishing, as described [28]. The
complete gene structures were determined based on alignments to mouse RefSeq mRNAs or species-specific mRNA,
when available. For the tBlastn searches, we used mouse
Otop1, -2, and -3 to query vertebrate genome sequences,
and Drosophila OTPLa, -b, and -c and C. elegans OTOPLd1,
-e, -f, -g, -h, and -i to query arthropod and nematode
genome sequences (see Table 1 for sequence accession
numbers).
Alignment, phylogenic tree generation, and evolutionary
constraint versus hydropathy analysis
The initial protein sequence alignment was performed
with ProbCons [29], and a preliminary phylogenetic tree
was built with SEMPHY [30] using only the most confidently aligned regions of the multi-sequence alignment.
The sequences were then divided into smaller groups
based upon their relatedness according to the tree. Each
group was re-aligned with Probcons, and each of these
sub-alignments was manually adjusted. ClustalW [31,32]
was then used to profile-align these sub-alignments, producing the final, full alignment. The final phylogenetic
tree was constructed using SEMPHY, constraining the
topology to conform to SEMPHY trees built from the subalignments. 1000 bootstrap replicates were generated for
each subtree as well as the final tree. The bootstrap values
shown in Figure 1 are from the lowest-level tree in which
the given branch occurs.

Evolutionarily constrained regions were detected essentially as described previously [12]. The final alignment
and tree were used to calculate single-site evolutionary
rates with the empirical Bayesian version of the program
Rate4Site [33]. These single-site rate values were
smoothed using sliding-windows of weighted averaging.
In each 17-position-wide window, the value at the center
position of the window was given the highest relative
weight, and the relative weight decreased linearly for the
values on either side to the edge of the window. The
resulting weighted average was assigned to the position in
the protein corresponding to the center of the window. To
produce the evolutionary constraint profile, the rates were
then converted to relative constraint by normalizing to a
range between 0 and 1, inverted by subtracting from 1
(because a region of low evolutionary rate is under high
evolutionary constraint), and plotted against the position
in the protein.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/41

The hydropathy score at each position is the sum of these
values. These single-position values were smoothed using
the same sliding-windows weighted averaging scheme
applied to the rate values above, normalized to vary
between 0 and 1, and plotted against the position in the
protein.

To produce the hydropathy profile, the hydropathy-scale
value [18] for each amino acid in a column of the multisequence alignment (corresponding to a single position
on the profile) was multiplied by a weighting factor that
reflects the fractional contribution of the corresponding
sequence to the total sequence diversity represented [17].
