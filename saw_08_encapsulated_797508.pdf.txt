<p>Sequencing of the complete genome of Anoxybacillus flavithermus reveals enzymes that are required for silica adaptation and biofilm
Anoxybacillus flavithermus genome

Abstract
Background: Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Anoxybacillus have been found in diverse thermophilic habitats, such
as geothermal hot springs and manure, and in processed foods such as gelatin and milk powder. Anoxybacillus flavithermus
is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium found in super-saturated silica solutions and in opaline silica sinter. The ability of A.
flavithermus to grow in super-saturated silica solutions makes it an ideal subject to study the processes of sinter
formation, which might be similar to the biomineralization processes that occurred at the dawn of life.
Results: We report here the complete genome sequence of A. flavithermus strain WK1, isolated from the waste water
drain at the Wairakei geothermal power station in New Zealand. It consists of a single chromosome of 2,846,746 base
pairs and is predicted to encode 2,863 proteins. In silico genome analysis identified several enzymes that could be involved
in silica adaptation and biofilm formation, and their predicted functions were experimentally validated in vitro. Proteomic
analysis confirmed the regulation of biofilm-related proteins and crucial enzymes for the synthesis of long-chain
polyamines as constituents of silica nanospheres.
Conclusions: Microbial fossils preserved in silica and silica sinters are excellent objects for studying ancient life, a new
paleobiological frontier. An integrated analysis of the A. flavithermus genome and proteome provides the first glimpse of
metabolic adaptation during silicification and sinter formation. Comparative genome analysis suggests an extensive gene
loss in the Anoxybacillus/Geobacillus branch after its divergence from other bacilli.

Background

Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Anoxybacillus were originally described as obligately anaerobic spore-forming bacilli.
They are members of the family Bacillaceae, whose representatives were long believed to be obligate or facultative aerobes.
However, it has been shown that Bacillus subtilis and several
other bacilli are capable of anaerobic growth [1-3], whereas
Anoxybacillus spp. turned out to be facultative anaerobes
[4,5]. They are found in diverse moderate- to high-temperature habitats such as geothermal hot springs, manure, and
processed foods such as gelatin [4,6,7]. Anoxybacillus flavithermus is a major contaminant of milk powder [8].
We report here the complete genome sequence of the thermophilic bacterium A. flavithermus strain WK1 [GenBank:CP000922], which was isolated from the waste water
drain at the Wairakei geothermal power station in New Zealand [9]. This isolate has been deposited in Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany) as strain DSM 21510. The 16S rRNA
sequence of strain WK1 is 99.8% identical to that of the A. flavithermus type strain DSM 2641 [10], originally isolated from
a hot spring in New Zealand [6]. The name 'flavithermus'
reflects the dark yellow color of its colonies, caused by accumulation of a carotenoid pigment in the cell membrane.
Anoxybacillus flavithermus, formerly referred to as 'Bacillus
flavothermus', grows in an unusually wide range of temperatures, 30-72°C, and pH values, from 5.5 to 10.0 [6]. Temperature adaptation mechanisms in A. flavithermus proteins
have attracted some attention to this organism [11]. However,
a property of greater potential importance to the fields of
paleobiology and astrobiology is its ability to grow in waters
that are super-saturated with amorphous silica, and where
opaline silica sinter is actively forming [9,12]. Flushed waste
geothermal fluids from the Wairakei power station drain into

Volume 9, Issue 11, Article R161

a concrete channel at about 95°C. These fluids cool as they
travel down the 2-km-long drainage channel, dropping to
55°C before entering Wairakei Stream. As the water cools
down, silica sinter deposits subaqueously in the channels,
forming precipitates composed of amorphous silica (opal-A)
[9]. The ability of A. flavithermus to grow in super-saturated
silica solutions makes it an ideal subject to study the processes of sinter formation, which might be similar to the biomineralization processes that occurred at the dawn of life [13].
Although bacteria are believed to play only a passive role in
silicification, they definitely affect the absolute rate of silica
precipitation by providing increased surface area. In addition, bacteria largely control the textural features of the
resulting siliceous sinters [14]. We have obtained the complete genome sequence of A. flavithermus WK1 and employed
it to analyze bacterial physiology and its changes in response
to silica-rich conditions. This study sheds light on the biogeochemical processes that occur during the interaction between
microbial cells and dissolved silica and result in sinter deposition.

Results
Genome organization
The genome of A. flavithermus strain WK1 consists of a single, circular chromosome of 2,846,746 bp (Figure 1) with an
average G+C content of 41.78% (Table 1). The genome
encompasses 2,863 predicted protein-coding genes, 8 rRNA
(16S-23S-5S) operons, 77 tRNA genes, and 19 predicted
riboswitches. Of the 2,863 predicted proteins, 1,929 have
been assigned probable biological functions, 418 were conserved proteins with only general function predicted, and for
516 putative proteins no function was predicted (of these, 110
proteins had no detectable homologs in the NCBI protein
database). The genome contains one prophage region with 44

genes (Aflv_0639-0682) and encodes 105 transposases. In its
gene order and the phylogenetic affinities of the encoded proteins, A. flavithermus WK1 is a typical member of the family
Bacillaceae, with Geobacillus kaustophilus and Geobacillus
thermodenitrificans as its closest neighbors (see below).
Pair-wise genome alignments show high conservation of gene
order between A. flavithermus, G. kaustophilus and B. subtilis (Figure 2). Anoxybacillus flavithermus WK1 has a typical
firmicute proteome, with 89% of the predicted open reading
frames (ORFs) having closest homologs in Bacillus spp. (Figure S1 in Additional data file 1). However, the A. flavithermus
WK1 genome is the smallest among the sequenced members
of Bacillaceae and generally encodes fewer paralogous proteins than other bacilli (Table S1 in Additional data file 1).

Metabolism
Despite its much smaller genome size, A. flavithermus
appears to retain most of the key metabolic pathways present
in B. subtilis and other bacilli. It has a complete set of
enzymes for biosynthesis of all amino acids, nucleotides and
cofactors, with the sole exception of the molybdenum cofactor
(Table S2 in Additional data file 1). Cells of A. flavithermus
had been originally reported to reduce nitrate [4,6]; however,
in subsequent work, nitrate reductase activity has not been
observed in this organism [15]. In accord with the latter
report, the A. flavithermus WK1 genome encodes neither the
assimilatory nitrate/nitrite reductase complex (NasBCDE)
nor the respiratory nitrate reductase complex (NarGHJI),
both of which are present and functional in B. subtilis [16,17],
nor the third (proteobacterial) type of nitrate reductase
(NapAB) [18]. Nitrate/nitrite transporters NasA and NarK

are missing in A. flavithermus as well. The loss of nitrate
reductases in A. flavithermus WK1 appears to be a recent
event, given that G. kaustophilus encodes the assimilatory
nitrate reductase, whereas G. thermodenitrificans encodes
the respiratory nitrate reductase complex. In accordance with
the loss of nitrate reductases, A. flavithermus WK1 has lost
the entire set of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the
molybdenum cofactor of nitrate reductase, as well as the
molybdate-specific ABC (ATP-binding cassette)-type transporter, all of which are encoded in G. kaustophilus and G.
thermodenitrificans. Molybdenum-dependent xanthine
dehydrogenase and its homologs YoaE (putative formate
dehydrogenase) and YyaE have been lost as well. As suggested in [19], the loss of molybdate metabolism could be part
of a strategy to avoid generation of reactive oxygen species.
As the name suggests, members of the genus Anoxybacillus
were initially described as obligate or facultative anaerobes
[4,5]. However, the initial description of (Anoxy)bacillus flavithermus already mentioned its capability to grow in aerobic
conditions [6]. Examination of the A. flavithermus WK1
genome revealed that it encodes an electron transfer chain
that is as complex as that of B. subtilis and appears to be wellsuited for using oxygen as terminal electron acceptor. The
electron transfer chain of A. flavithermus includes NADH

dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, quinol oxidases of
bd type and aa3 type, menaquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase and cytochrome c oxidase, as well as two operons encoding the electron transfer flavoprotein (Table 2).
Anoxybacillus flavithermus also encodes a variety of
enzymes that are important for the defense against oxygen
reactive species, such as catalase (peroxidase I), Mn-containing catalase, Mn-, Fe-, and Cu,Zn-dependent superoxide dismutases (the latter, in contrast to B. subtilis YojM, has both
Cu-binding histidine residues), thiol peroxidase, and glutathione peroxidase (Table 2). The presence of these genes in the
genome suggests that A. flavithermus WK1 should be able to
thrive in aerobic conditions. Indeed, isolation of this strain,
similarly to the type strain A. flavithermus DSM 2641, has
been carried out in open air, without the use of anaerobic
techniques [6,9,20].
Anoxybacillus flavithermus WK1 grows well anaerobically in
rich media, such as tryptic soy broth (TSB). Owing to the
absence of nitrate and nitrite reductases (see above), its
anaerobic growth cannot rely on nitrate or nitrite respiration
and apparently proceeds by fermentation. Fermentative
growth of B. subtilis requires phosphotransacetylase, acetate
kinase and L-lactate dehydrogenase genes [1,3]. All these
genes are conserved in A. flavithermus (pta, Aflv_2760; ack,

Aflv_0480; lctE, Aflv_0889), suggesting that, like B. subtilis,
this bacterium can ferment glucose and pyruvate into acetate
[1]. However, catabolic acetolactate synthase AlsSD and acetolactate dehydrogenase, which are responsible for acetoin
production by fermenting B. subtilis [1], are missing in A. flavithermus, indicating that it cannot produce acetoin.
In agreement with the experimental data [6], genome analysis indicates that A. flavithermus is able to utilize a variety of
carbohydrates as sole carbon sources. It has at least four
sugar phosphotransferase systems with predicted specificity
for glucose, fructose, sucrose, and mannitol. Additionally, it
encodes ABC-type transporters for ribose, glycerol-3-phosphate, and maltose, and several ABC-type sugar transporters
of unknown specificity. A complete set of enzymes was identified for general carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis, the
TCA cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway, but not the
Entner-Doudoroff pathway). The A. flavithermus genome
also contains a gene cluster (Aflv_2610-2618) that is very
similar to the gene cluster associated with antibiotic production and secretion in many other Gram-positive bacteria [21],
suggesting that A. flavithermus might be able to produce bactericidal peptides. It is not obvious which of these systems are
relevant to the survival of A. flavithermus in silica solutions,
but they might facilitate its growth in powdered milk and similar habitats.

Evolution of the Anoxybacillus branch of bacilli
In a phylogenetic tree constructed using a concatenated
alignment of the RNA polymerase subunits RpoA, RpoB, and
RpoC, A. flavithermus, G. kaustophilus, and G. thermodenitrificans grouped together and formed a deep branch within
the Bacillus cluster (Figure 3). A distinct Anoxybacillus/Geobacillus branch is also seen in a gene content tree that was
constructed on the basis of the presence or absence of particular protein families in the genomes of 26 species of firmicutes and 2 actinobacteria (used as an outgroup; Figure S2 in
Additional data file 1).
Anoxybacillus flavithermus WK1 has a relatively small
genome compared to other Bacillus species. To determine
which genes were likely to have been lost and gained in this
lineage, we reconstructed the most parsimonious scenario of
evolution [22] from the last common ancestor of the firmicutes. The reconstruction was performed on the basis of the
assignment of A. flavithermus to the Clusters of Orthologous
Groups of proteins (COGs), followed by the comparison of
COG-based phyletic patterns of 20 other bacilli, 5 clostridia,
and 6 mollicutes. This approach assigned 2,015 genes (COGs)
to the common ancestor of A. flavithermus and G. kaustophilus (Figure 4). The reconstruction results suggest that a
massive gene loss (-437 genes) occurred during evolution
from the common ancestor of Bacillaceae to the common
ancestor of Anoxybacillus and Geobacillus. The majority of
the genes shared between A. flavithermus and G. kaustophilus are also shared with other Bacillus species. Gene

losses in the Geobacillus/Anoxybacillus branch include,
among others, genes encoding the nitrogen regulatory protein PII, ABC-type proline/glycine betaine transport system,
methionine synthase II (cobalamin-independent), sorbitolspecific phosphotransferase system, β-xylosidase, and some
dTDP-sugar metabolism genes (Table S3 in Additional data
file 1). However, 62 gene gains were inferred as well, including several genes coding for cobalamin biosynthesis enzymes,
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, genes involved in assembly of
type IV pili (Aflv_0630-0632), an uncharacterized ABC-type
transport system, and 16 genes encoding uncharacterized
conserved proteins (Table S3 in Additional data file 1). After
the split of the Anoxybacillus and Geobacillus lineages, A. flavithermus continued to show strong genome reduction (-292
genes) compared to G. kaustophilus (-124 genes), losing, in
particular, some genes of nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, A. flavithermus has apparently experienced
less gene gain (+88) than G. kaustophilus (+158). The few
genes likely acquired in the Anoxybacillus lineage include the
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat
(CRISPR)-associated genes (Aflv_0764-0771) that form an
antisense RNA-based system of phage resistance, which is
often associated with thermophily [23,24].

Signal transduction
Being a free-living environmental microorganism, A. flavithermus encodes numerous proteins involved in signal
transduction. These include 23 sensor histidine kinases and
24 response regulators (16 pairs of which are clustered in
operons), 20 methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, 5 predicted eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr protein kinases, and 21 proteins involved in metabolism of cyclic diguanylate (cyclic
(3',5')-dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP)), a
recently recognized secondary messenger that regulates transition from motility to sessility and biofilm formation in a
variety of bacteria [25]. Compared to other bacilli, this set is
significantly enriched in chemotaxis transducers and c-diGMP-related proteins [26]. Anoxybacillus flavithermus
encodes 12 proteins with the diguanylate cyclase (GGDEF)
domain, 6 of which also contain the c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (EAL) domain, and one combines GGDEF with an alternative c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (HD-GYP) domain.
Anoxybacillus flavithermus WK1 also encodes two proteins
with the EAL domain and seven proteins with the HD-GYP
domain that do not contain the GGDEF domain. In addition,
it encodes two proteins with the PilZ domain [27], which
serves as a c-di-GMP-binding adaptor protein [28,29]. The
total number of proteins implicated in c-di-GMP turnover in
A. flavithermus is third highest among all Gram-positive bacteria sequenced to date, after Clostridium difficile and Desulfitobacterium hafniense, which have much larger genomes
[26,30].

Silicification of A. flavithermus cells and biofilm
formation
The abundance of c-di-GMP-related proteins suggests that
regulation of biofilm formation plays an important role in the
physiology of A. flavithermus. Indeed, scanning electron
microphotographs of A. flavithermus cells cultured in the
presence of high amounts of silica showed that the presence
of biofilm had a major effect on the form of silica precipitation. In the absence of bacteria, the prevailing mode of silica
precipitation was the formation of a layer of amorphous silica
nanospherules (Figure 5a). In the presence of bacteria, silica
precipitates were often associated with individual cells of A.
flavithermus (Figure 5b), suggesting that these cells might

serve as nucleation sites for sinter formation. However, in the
culture of A. flavithermus cells attached as a biofilm to a glass
slide, silica precipitates were mostly bound to the exopolysaccharide material of the biofilm (Figure 5c,d). Biofilm-associated silica was often seen forming extensive granular silica
precipitates (Figure 5e). Further incubation led to the development of a complex, multi-layered biofilm that was impregnated with silica particles (Figure 5f). Obviously, A.
flavithermus biofilm formation played a key role in determining the structural nature of the silica sinter. Indeed, A. flavithermus WK1 retains some of the genes (Table 3) that are
required for biofilm formation in B. subtilis [31,32]. Proteins
encoded by these genes include: the master regulators of bio-

film formation AbrB (Aflv_0031) and SinR (Aflv_2245); αphosphoglucomutase YhxB (Aflv_2333), which is probably
involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis; EcsB (Aflv_2284),
the membrane subunit of an ABC-type transporter that could
promote secretion of protein components of the extracellular
matrix; an HD-superfamily hydrolase YqeK (Aflv_0816) that
is required for the formation of thick pellicles; YlbF
(Aflv_1855), a positive regulator of competence factor ComK;
and YmcA (Afla1522), a protein of unknown function. Other
biofilm-forming proteins of B subtilis, namely, the AbrB- and
SinR-regulated genes tasA (yqhF) or yqfM [33,34], are
absent in the smaller genome of A. flavithermus.

Cell adaptation to silica
The existence of c-di-GMP-mediated signal transduction
pathways also suggested that biofilm formation in A. flavithermus could be regulated in response to environmental
conditions. To investigate possible mechanisms of silica
adaptation, we compared protein expression profiles of A. flavithermus in the presence and absence of silica using twodimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analyses (Figure S3 in Additional data file 1).
Although samples from three independent experiments
showed significant variance and the expression changes could
not be statistically proven (Table S4 in Additional data file 1),
the trends that they revealed provided certain clues to the A.
flavithermus adaptation to silica. After exposure of batch cultures to 10.7 mM (300 ppm) silica (a mixture of monomeric
H4SiO4 and polymerized silicic acid [35]) for 8 hours, expression of 19 proteins was increased at least 1.5-fold in each of
three independent experiments, whereas expression of 18
proteins was found to be decreased (Table S4 in Additional
data file 1). Most of these proteins were products of housekeeping genes whose up- or down-regulation could be related
to the general stress in the presence of silica, as suggested by
the increased expression of the alkaline shock protein Asp23
(Aflv_1780) and the carboxylesterase YvaK (Aflv_2499),
which are stress-induced in B. subtilis [36]. The increased
expression of AbrB (Aflv_0031), a key transcriptional regulator of biofilm-related genes in B. subtilis, suggested that exposure to silica could, indeed, trigger biofilm formation by A.
flavithermus. Of particular interest was the differential effect
of silica on the expression of two close paralogs, putrescine
aminopropyltransferase (spermidine synthase) SpeE
(Aflv_2750) and SpeE-like protein Aflv_1437. Expression of
SpeE, which is part of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway of
B. subtilis [37], was suppressed by exposure to silica. In contrast, SpeE-like protein Aflv_1437, which could participate in
the synthesis of some other polyamine(s) (see, for example,
[38]), was up-regulated (Table S4 in Additional data file 1). A
predicted arginase (Aflv_0146), which catalyzes the first step
in the synthesis of putrescine (the substrate of SpeE), namely,
conversion of arginine to ornithine (Figure 6), was also upregulated, whereas the expression of predicted arginine
decarboxylase (Aflv_1886) and agmatinase (Aflv_2749),

Volume 9, Issue 11, Article R161

Saw et al. R161.10

which comprise an alternative route for the synthesis of
putrescine, was very low and, apparently, remained
unchanged (data not shown), suggesting that putrescine was
primarily produced via the arginase route. Given that longchain polyamines (LCPAs) are crucial in the formation of silica nanostructures in diatoms [39-43], these data suggested a
link between polyamine biosynthesis and biofilm formation
in A. flavithermus. As a first step towards characterizing this
link, proteins encoded by genes Aflv_0024, Aflv_0146,
Aflv_1437, Aflv_1886, Aflv_2749, and Aflv_2750 were individually expressed, purified, and confirmed to function as,
respectively, ornithine decarboxylase, arginase, spermine
synthase, arginine decarboxylase, agmatinase, and spermidine synthase (Figures S4-S6 in Additional data file 1). In the
general route, spermine synthase converts spermidine into
spermine by transferring an aminopropyl group. The spermine synthase (Aflv_1437) identified here converts
putrescine directly into spermine by adding two aminopropyl
groups, raising the possibility of the formation of longer chain
polyamines by sequentially adding multiple aminopropyl
groups. The proposed roles of these enzymes in LCPA biosynthesis in A. flavithermus are shown in Figure 2.
We also examined protein expression profiles in the cells
grown in the presence or absence of silica for 7 days. Sinters
started forming in the silica-containing sample 5 days after
inoculation, so by the end of the incubation the cells became
silicified. Owing to the problems with collecting and analyzing silicified A. flavithermus cells, no attempt has been made
to replicate this experiment, so these results were only considered in comparison to the samples from 8-hour exposure
to silica. Spermine synthase Aflv_1437 was not detected in
either silicified or control cells (last column of Table S4 in
Additional data file 1), and arginase (Aflv_0146; Figure S7 in
Additional data file 1) was only detected in the silicified cells
at very low abundance. In contrast, spermidine synthase
Aflv_2750 was detected at similar levels in both types of cells,
indicating general cellular functions for spermidine. Remarkably, the transcriptional regulator AbrB (Aflv_0031)
remained moderately up-regulated in the silicified cells, suggesting that it might play a general role in silica adaptation of
A. flavithermus. Also up-regulated in both silica conditions
were chemotaxis response regulator CheY (Aflv_1727), thiol
peroxidase Aflv_0478, which is apparently involved in antioxidant defense, and methionine aminopeptidase Aflv_0127.
Those proteins could also play a role in silica niche adaptation
of A. flavithermus.

Discussion

Silica precipitation and formation of sinter is an important
geochemical process in hot spring systems, and understanding how these structures form might be important for deciphering some of the earliest biological processes on Earth
[13,14].

Microbial fossils are well preserved in silica compared to
CaCO3 or iron precipitates [13], and silica sinters are excellent
structures for studying ancient microbial life. Microorganisms were previously believed to play no active role in the formation of silica precipitates. Rather, microbial cell surfaces
have been assumed to provide nucleation sites to allow precipitation of minerals [14]. However, several recent studies
have shed light on the biotic components that might play an
active role in silicification. The best studied in this respect are
diatoms, which build silica nanostructures in a controlled
manner and under ambient conditions [44,45]. Formation of
silica nanostructures in diatoms is influenced by polycationic
peptides, named silaffins [39,46], and LCPAs [47]. In diatom
cells, silica is deposited as nanospheres before being transformed into complex structures [48,49]. Polyamines have
been shown to catalyze siloxane-bond formation and can also

act as flocculating agents, leading to silica polymerization
[50,51]. In the bacterial world, polyamines have been shown
to be essential for biofilm formation in Yersinia pestis [52]
and to activate biofilm formation in Vibrio cholerae,
although, in the latter case, the effect appeared to be due primarily to intracellular signaling [53]. Studies of silicate binding by B. subtilis cell walls by Terry Beveridge and colleagues
showed that it was electrostatic in nature and depended on
the surface charge [54,55]. The observations of silica nanospheres formed around the bacterial cells in hot springs [9]
and in simulated experimental conditions with A. flavithermus (Figure 5e) suggest that silica formation in hot springs
also might be biologically influenced.
LCPAs participate in silica formation in diatoms [40-42] and
enzymes similar to spermidine and spermine synthases are

thought to be required for their synthesis [56]. On the other
hand, polyamines, including putrescine, spermidine, and
spermine, are ubiquitous in all cells, and play essential roles
in cell proliferation and differentiation [57,58]. Of the two
speE paralogs in A. flavithermus WK1, SpeE (Aflv_2750) catalyzes the formation of spermidine from putrescine, most
likely for general cellular functions, whereas the SpeE-like
Aflv_1437 catalyzes the conversion of putrescine into spermine and could be an important part of LCPA production. In
B. subtilis, polyamines are synthesized via a single route, the
agmatine pathway encoded by speA and the speEB operon
[34]. Enzymes for this route are also encoded in A. flavithermus and most likely serve normal cellular functions as the
expression level of arginine decarboxylase (Aflv_1886), the
key enzyme of the pathway, was not stimulated by silica.
Therefore, up-regulation of putrescine production for SpeElike production was through the other route catalyzed by arginase and ornithine decarboxylase. The presence of two
putrescine synthesis routes and two putrescine aminopropyltransferase homologs (SpeE and SpeE-like) indicates that
polyamine synthesis is crucial for the specific niche adaptation of A. flavithermus.
Based on the proposed LCPA synthesis pathway (Figure 6),
conversion of putrescine into spermine by the SpeE-like protein Aflv_1437 could be followed by further transfer of aminopropyl groups leading to the formation of LCPAs. Previous
studies using computer simulations have shown that
polyamine chains may self-assemble into structures serving
as scaffolding or nucleation sites for the precipitation of silica-polyamine complexes [41]. Our results suggest that the
SpeE-like enzyme may be responsible for the production of
LCPAs that form the basis or scaffolding needed for the silicapolyamine complexes to aggregate.
Biofilm formation and production of exopolysaccharides are
important processes that could facilitate silica sinter formation in hot springs. The abundance of c-di-GMP-related proteins in the A. flavithermus genome, as well as the upregulation of the global regulator AbrB (Aflv_0031) in the
presence of silica, suggests that biofilm formation by this
organism is part of its global response to silica. In studies of
the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp., silicification had no significant effect on cell viability [59]; there is little doubt that A.
flavithermus cells remain viable during silicification as well.
Our current working model implies that polymerization of
monomeric and polymeric silica into silica nanospheres is
facilitated by biotic factors such as LCPAs, as indicated by our
proteomics results. Attachment of these silica nanospheres to
the exopolysaccharide coating surrounding the A. flavithermus cells (Figure 5e) is a key step in silica sinter formation. In
summary, this integrated genomics and proteomics study
provides the first experimental evidence of the biochemical
reactions between dissolved silica and the bacterial cell. Such
reactions are likely to be crucial in the preservation of ancient

microbial life and the growth of modern hot spring sinter
deposits.

Conclusion

The complete genome sequence of A. flavithermus shows
clear signs of genome compaction in the Anoxybacilus/Geobacillus branch, compared to other members of the family
Bacillaceae. In A. flavithermus strain WK1, adaptations to
growth at high temperatures in supersaturated silica solutions include general streamlining of the genome, coupled
with preservation of the major metabolic pathways and the
capability to form biofilms. The presence of bacteria appears
to affect silicification in several different ways. Passive effects
of bacteria include providing nucleation sites for sinter formation and an increased surface area for silica precipitation.
In addition, synthesis of LCPAs and biofilm formation by A.
flavithermus could regulate sinter formation and control the
textural features of the resulting siliceous sinters. The presence of an array of c-di-GMP-related signal transduction proteins suggests that A. flavithermus could regulate biofilm
formation in response to the environmental conditions.

Materials and methods
Sequencing, assembly, and annotation
The genome of A. flavithermus was sequenced using the
whole-genome-shotgun approach as previously described
[60], using genomic DNA that was randomly sheared to generate 3 kb and 6 kb fragments. These fragments were sizeselected on agarose gels, purified, end-repaired, ligated to
pUC118 vectors, and transformed into DH10B competent
cells by electroporation. Plasmids from positive clones were
sequenced using Beckman CEQ 8000 (Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA, USA) and ABI 3730xl (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) sequencers. A total of 55,975 valid
sequences were used for assembly with PHRED/PHRAP/
CONSED [61], CAP3 [62], and SEQMAN II (DNAStar) programs. Further 3,863 sequences were used to close gaps
between contigs and to improve overall sequence quality of
contigs. Long PCR reactions were performed to verify
sequence assembly. Protein-coding genes were predicted
using GLIMMER [63] followed by BLASTX [64] searches of
intergenic regions between predicted ORFs. Transfer RNAs
were predicted by tRNAscan-SE [65]. Genome annotation
was performed by running BLAST and PSI-BLAST against
the NCBI protein database and the COG database with manual verification as described previously [60]. Metabolic pathways were analyzed by comparing COG assignments of A.
flavithermus proteins with the standard sets of COGs
involved in each pathway [66]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed as described [67].

Biofilm formation and silica precipitation
Biofilm formation by A. flavithermus cells grown in the presence of silica was studied by incubating the cells in a chemo-

stat-like system, consisting of a 500 ml serum vial, capped
with a rubber seal with two input and one output lines. This
was filled halfway with 300 ml of TSB. The two input lines
were fed through the rubber seal and connected via peristaltic
pumps to sterile reservoirs. One reservoir contained 2 × TSB
and the other water. They were each fed at 0.15 ml per minute
giving 1 × TSB in the vial. An output line connected to another
peristaltic pump maintained the medium level at 300 ml. A
final output line was fit with a luer valve and syringe to allow
samples to be removed from the reservoir. A glass slide stood
upright in the vial as a substrate for silica sinters, to be
observed by scanning electron microscopy at the conclusion
of the experiment. The cultivation vessel was contained in a
60°C oven and shaken gently at 100 rpm to simulate wave
motion. After running the system for two days to ensure it was
sterile, the medium was inoculated with A. flavithermus WK1
through the luer-fitted line. The system ran for two days to
build up cell mass, then samples of 200 ml were taken for
three successive days. Samples were centrifuged, the pellet
washed 3 times in buffer (68 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
KH2PO4, 9 mM NaH2PO4, 50 mM TRIS, pH 8.0), stored at 20°C and later freeze-dried. The system was running at pH
5.8 and OD600 0.15 during this time. After three days, the
water was replaced with 1,000 mg/kg silica solution adjusted
to pH 7. This flowed through a 200°C oven before reaching
the cultivation vessel in order to monomerize the silica and
sterilize the water. Samples were taken after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days
and prepared as above. As time progressed, there was
increasingly more solid, amorphous silica in the vessel, as this
was not removed by the outflow. The system remained at pH
5.8 but there was no longer any way to reliably measure
OD600 because of the silica precipitate. At the end of incubation, some of the amorphous silica and the slide were
removed to be fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde. Samples for scanning electron microscopy were removed from storage and
allowed to air-dry before coating with gold/palladium. Scanning electron microscopy examination was done on a Hitachi
S-800 Field Emission scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV.

Proteomic analysis
Anoxybacillus flavithermus cells were grown in TSB at 60°C
with shaking at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker (Thermo Electron Co., Waltham, MA, USA) to OD600 of 0.6, followed by the
addition of silica to a final concentration of 10.7 mM and
growth for another 8 hours. The same batch of the culture
without added silica served as the control. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4°C for 10 minutes,
extracellular proteins from the supernatant were collected
and cellular proteins from the pellet were solubilized [68].
Immunoelectrophoresis (the first dimension) was carried out
on IPG strips (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) in a Multiphor II electrophoresis unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with running conditions as described by
Büttner et al. [69]. For the second dimension, vertical slab
SDS-PAGE (12%) was run in a Bio-Rad Protean II Xi unit

Saw et al. R161.13

(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Gels were
stained with colloidal CBB G-250 [70], and scanned with a
PowerLook 1000 (UMAX Technologies Inc., Fremont, CA,
USA). PDQuest version 7.3.0 (Bio-Rad) was used for image
analysis. Proteins were classified as being differentially
expressed under the two conditions when spot intensity
showed at least 1.5-fold change.
For protein identification, spots were excised from the gels,
washed with 25 mM NH4HCO3 in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile for 3
× 15 minutes at room temperature, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and incubated in 50 μl digestion solution consisted of 25
mM NH4HCO3 in 0.1% acetic acid and 12.5 ng/mL of trypsin
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37°C overnight. The
digested protein (0.3 μl) was spotted on a MALDI sample
plate with the same volume of matrix (10 mg/ml α-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Peptide mass spectra were obtained on a MALDITOF/TOF mass spectrometer (4700 Proteomics Analyzer,
Applied Biosystems) in the positive ion reflector mode. The
mass spectrometry spectra were internally calibrated with a
mass standard kit for the 4700 Proteomics Analyzer. Proteins
were identified by automated peptide mass fingerprinting
using the Global Proteome Server Explorer™ software (Version 3.5, Applied Biosystems) against an in-house sequence
database of A. flavithermus proteins. Peak lists (S/N > 10)
were extracted from raw data for the data processing, and
positive identifications were accepted up to 95% of confidence level. The following criteria were used for the database
searches: maximum one missed cleavage per peptide; mass
tolerance of 0.1 Da, and the acceptation of carbamidomethylation for cysteine and oxidation for methionine.

Characterization of enzymes involved in LCPA
synthesis
The genes Aflv_0024, Aflv_1886, Aflv_2749, and Aflv_1437
were cloned into the pET-14b vector, Aflv_0146 into pET-3a,
and Aflv_2750 into pET-28a. Escherichia coli strain BL21
carrying each of the recombinant plasmids was grown overnight with shaking at 37°C in Luria broth containing 100 mg/
ml ampicillin. The overnight culture (4 ml) was inoculated
into 400 ml of fresh Luria broth and grown to mid-log phase
(A600 = 0.6). Expression of Aflv_0146, Aflv_1437, Aflv_1886,
Aflv_2749, and Aflv_2750 products was induced with 0.1
mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37°C
for 4 hours, and expression of the Aflv_0024 product was
induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 12°C for 8 hours. After IPTG
induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000
× g at 4°C for 5 minutes, washed with binding buffer (10 mM
imidazole, 300 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0),
resuspended in 5 ml of binding buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml of lysozyme, and sonicated for 10 1-minute cycles with 1-second pulse on
alternating 1-second pulse off at 95% of the maximum power
(200 W) using an UP200S Ultraschallprozessor with a
tapered microtip. The lysate of Aflv_1886 was further incu-

bated for 10 minutes at 60°C. After centrifugation at 12,000 ×
g at 4°C for 30 minutes, the crude extract containing 6× Histagged fusion proteins was purified by nickel ion affinity
chromatography with a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed successively with 100 ml of wash buffer (25 mM imidazole, 300 mM
NaCl, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and the fusion proteins
were eluted with the elution buffer (250 mM imidazole, 300
mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and dialyzed in 0.1
M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. For SDS-PAGE, proteins
were denatured at 100°C for 5 minutes in the presence of 0.1%
SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, loaded in a 5% (w/v) stacking gel and separated in a 10% (w/v) separation gel. The gel
was stained with Coomassie Bright Blue R250. The molecular
weight markers were from the LMW-SDS Marker Kit (GE
Healthcare).
Reactions catalyzed by arginase, arginine decarboxylase,
ornithine decarboxylase, agmatinase, spermidine synthase
and spermine synthase were carried out as previously
described [71-74]. The activities of arginase and arginine
decarboxylase were determined by thin-layer chromatography [75]. The activities of the other enzymes were assayed by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) after
Schotten-Baumann benzoylation as previously described
[74,76,77]. HPLC analysis was performed with a Venusil XBP
C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) in conjunction with a LC-20AT
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) HPLC apparatus. Benzoyl
putrescine, spermidine and spermine were eluted by a gradient started with 60% methanol in water and proceeded linearly to 100% methanol, with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/minute over
20 minutes, and detected at a wavelength of 229 nm.
