Abstract
Background: The dimorphic fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum causes respiratory and
systemic disease in humans and other mammals. Progress in understanding the mechanisms
underlying the biology and the pathogenesis of Histoplasma has been hindered by a shortage of
methodologies for mutating a gene of interest.
Results: We describe a reverse genetics process that combines the random mutagenesis of
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with screening techniques to identify targeted gene
disruptions in a collection of insertion mutants. Isolation of the desired mutant is accomplished by
arraying individual clones from a pool and employing a PCR-addressing method. Application of this
procedure facilitated the isolation of a cbp1 mutant in a North American type 2 strain, a Histoplasma
strain recalcitrant to gene knock-outs through homologous recombination. Optimization of
cryopreservation conditions allows pools of mutants to be banked for later analysis and recovery
of targeted mutants.
Conclusion: This methodology improves our ability to isolate mutants in targeted genes, thereby
facilitating the molecular genetic analysis of Histoplasma biology. The procedures described are
widely applicable to many fungal systems and will be of particular interest to those for which
homologous recombination techniques are inefficient or do not currently exist.

Background
The dimorphic fungal pathogen, Histoplasma capsulatum,
parasitizes phagocytic cells of the mammalian immune
system and causes one of the most common respiratory
fungal infections world wide [1-3]. The mycelia-produced
Histoplasma conidia are acquired by inhalation into the
respiratory tract where exposure to mammalian body temperatures triggers their differentiation into pathogenic
yeast cells [3,4]. Histoplasma virulence requires this transition to the yeast phase and expression of the correspond-

ing yeast-phase regulon [5-7]. This transcriptional profile
includes genes encoding specific factors that promote Histoplasma virulence [7-9]. While mammalian alveolar macrophages efficiently phagocytose Histoplasma cells, they
are unable to kill the yeast [10-12]. Within the macrophage, Histoplasma modifies the intracellular compartment to promote its survival and replication. The ability
to subvert immune defenses and to survive within phagocytes enables Histoplasma to cause disease in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals.

This high potential for infection is reflected in the fact that
histoplasmosis is one of the most common pulmonary
fungal infections among healthy individuals [13].
The mechanistic details that underlie Histoplasma pathogenesis are still largely unknown owing to limited or inefficient genetic methodologies. The genome sequences of
three phylogenetically distinct strains of Histoplasma have
been completed (North American type 1, NAm 1; North
American type 2, NAm 2, and a lineage from Panama,
Pan) [14] which has accelerated the ability to identify,
define, and analyze Histoplasma genes. However, demonstration that a gene product contributes to a particular
facet of biology requires specific depletion of the candidate factor and comparison to a factor-replete strain in
functional tests. Targeted deletion of candidate factors is
most often accomplished through genetic means,
employing homologous recombination to replace the
wild-type gene with an engineered deletion or disruption
allele. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologous recombination is so efficient that gene deletion libraries have been
compiled with mutants representing entire sets of genes or
even the majority of the genes in the genome [15,16]. In
contrast, non-homologous or illegitimate recombination
dominates in the dimorphic fungal pathogens [17], frustrating gene deletion attempts and impeding advancement of our molecular understanding of these fungi.
Furthermore, Histoplasma can maintain introduced DNA
(e.g. a deletion allele) as an extrachromosomal element
which impedes efforts to incorporate alleles into the
genome [18,19].
Despite these obstacles, genes have been deleted in Histoplasma following development of a two-step procedure
[20]. Realization of the rare homologous recombination
event necessitates a very large population as the frequency
of allelic replacement is on the order of 1 in 1000 transformants [21]. As typical transformation frequencies are
insufficient, individual transformants harboring recombination substrates are instead cultured and repeatedly passaged to generate a large number of potential
recombination events. In the second step, a dual positive
and negative selection scheme enriches the population for
the desired recombinant. In practice, only a portion of the
isolated clones harbor the deletion requiring screening of
many potential isolates. In Histoplasma, this process of
reverse genetics (the generation of a mutant in a targeted
gene) has been successfully accomplished for only six
genes to date, the vast majority in the Panama phylogenetic group (URA5, CBP1, AGS1, AMY1, SID1) [20-24].
For reasons not well understood, this procedure has not
been very successful in the Histoplasma NAm 2 lineage
despite numerous attempts. Recently, a deletion of the
gene encoding DPPIVA has been reported in the NAm 2
lineage [25].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/236

The inefficient and laborious process of deleting genes in
Histoplasma prompted development of RNA interference
(RNAi) as an alternative method to determine the role of
gene products in Histoplasma biology [22]. To date, eight
genes have been functionally defined by RNAi (AGS1,
UGP1, DRK1, YPS3, RYP1, GGT1 DPPIVA, DPPIVB)
[7,8,22,23,25-27]. However, RNAi can not generate a
complete loss of function, and this potential for residual
function imposes difficulties in interpreting negative
results with RNAi (i.e. the absence of a phenotype).
Unlike chromosomal mutations which are more permanent, plasmid-based RNAi effects must be constantly
maintained with selection. For studies of Histoplasma virulence, this in vivo selection of plasmids requires use of
the URA5 selection marker and ura5 auxotrophic Histoplasma strains.
To overcome these obstacles and limitations in our current techniques for genetic analysis of Histoplasma, we
have developed a procedure for isolating chromosomallylocated gene mutants without reliance on homologous
recombination. We employed random mutagenesis to
create collections of mutants. One approach to identify
the desired gene disruption would be to characterize the
mutation of each isolate in the collection of random
mutants. However, this requires many resources, substantial time and effort, and thus is not well suited for studies
targeting a particular gene. In forward genetics, random
mutagenesis is successful because the desired mutant can
be typically isolated or identified out of the much larger
collection of mutants by growth phenotype or morphological changes. In reverse genetics, the mutant phenotype
is the very aspect under investigation and thus mutants
can not be identified by predicted changes. To enable
reverse genetics following random mutagenesis in Histoplasma, we adapted PCR-based procedures employed for
large scale screening in Arabidopsis and C. elegans [28-30].
We optimized a mutant pooling strategy and utilized PCR
to efficiently identify mutant pools which contain the
strain with the disrupted gene. To extract the strain with
the targeted mutation, the pool is subsequently subdivided and individual clones addressed and screened by
PCR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by
employing it to isolate a cbp1 mutant in the NAm 2 Histoplasma strain background.

Results and Discussion
Insertion mutant screening
To generate insertion mutations in the Histoplasma
genome, we used Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated
transformation. This mutagen was selected because Agrobacterium-mediated transfer of T-DNA is efficient in producing random insertional mutations in Histoplasma yeast
cells [23,31]. The majority of T-DNA insertions are single
integration events [31] and thus the chance of secondary

Optimization of pool size for reliable detection of targeted
mutations
As the successful isolation of a mutant in a targeted gene
depends critically on the ability to identify a positive individual among a much larger population, we determined
the PCR detection limit for different pool sizes. Histoplasma strain OSU4 harbors a T-DNA insertion in the
AGS1 gene in which the T-DNA right border is oriented
towards the 3' end of the AGS1 gene. Performance of PCR
using a right border T-DNA primer and an AGS1 gene-specific primer produces a PCR amplicon of 1242 bp. To estimate the detection limit afforded by PCR in which a single
strain could be found among a population of 200, 800, or
3200 mutants, 50 ng of nucleic acid purified from OSU 4
were diluted 1:200, 1:800, and 1:3200 with TE buffer and
PCR performed on these templates with RB3 and AGS150 primers. With 30 cycles, PCR could consistently detect
the OSU4 template when diluted as much as 1:800 (Figure 1B). To better approximate the condition where the
desired mutant would be present among a much larger
population of other T-DNA insertions, we mixed OSU4
with a pool of random T-DNA insertion mutants at a
OSU4 yeast-to-mutant pool ratio of 1:200, 1:800, and
1:3200. Nucleic acids were purified from each pool and
PCR was performed as before with 50 ng of total nucleic
acid as templates. The positive 1242 bp amplicon was
detected when OSU4 was present in as little as 1/800th of
the total population of yeast (Figure 1B). A faint band representing the ags1::T-DNA PCR product was observed
when OSU4 constituted 1/3200th of the template. No
ags1::T-DNA PCR product was detected in templates prepared from the mutant pool alone or wild-type Histoplasma. A smaller PCR amplicon which is not specific to
the ags1::T-DNA template was detected in all reactions
derived from the random insertion mutant pool.

background mutations is minimized. Other mutagens
such as UV or chemical agents result in multiple changes
to the genome, and while these background mutations
can be removed by repeated backcrossing of mutants to
wild type, no reliable techniques for crossing laboratory
strains have been developed for Histoplasma [32-34].
Additionally, insertional mutagens provide a molecular
tag with known sequence (e.g. the T-DNA element) which
we can exploit in PCR-based screening for mutations in
particular chromosomal loci using a T-DNA specific
primer in conjunction with a primer specific for the targeted gene (Figure 1A). The molecular weight of the PCR
amplicon provides an estimate of the distance from the
gene specific primer to the T-DNA insertion, and this distance can be used to determine whether the T-DNA element disrupts the targeted gene.

Establishment of a bank of insertion mutants
Optimization of freezing conditions
As the generation of T-DNA insertion mutants in Histoplasma is not trivial, establishment of a frozen bank of
insertion mutants would facilitate future screens without
having to produce new mutant pools as additional target
genes are identified. Maintaining the mutant representation in the pool after freezing necessitates efficient recovery of viable cells following thawing. To maximize the
recovery of cells after freezing we examined two parameters: the cryoprotectant used and the method of freezing.
Glycerol- or DMSO-containing solutions are used for
freezing eukaryotic cells as these chemicals reduce membrane-damaging ice crystal formation. We also tested
whether slowing the freezing rate using an insulated container also improved recovery from frozen stocks. Histoplasma WU15 yeast cells were frozen and stored at -80°C
for 7 days or 9 weeks to determine the short and long term
storage recovery rates, respectively. Recovered cfu counts
were compared to those before freezing. With glycerol as
the cryoprotectant, slowing the freezing rate dramatically
improved recovery of viable yeast (Figure 2A), probably
resulting from the increased time to allow for penetration
of glycerol into cells during cooling. DMSO was a superior
cryoprotectant than glycerol for Histoplasma yeast when
present at concentrations from 4% to 10% (Figure 2B).
Freezing with DMSO was less sensitive to the rate of freezing but as with glycerol, slower rates of cooling resulted in
greater recovery of viable yeast cells (Figure 2B). Nearly
40% of the starting suspension of yeast cells were recovered when cells were slowly frozen in an 8% DMSO-containing solution and this procedure was selected for long
term storage of mutant pools. Although specialized cool-

Nested PCR to reduce false-positives
To discriminate between true- and false-positive PCR
products, we employed a secondary PCR reaction using a
set of nested primers. Nested primers that do not overlap
with the primary PCR primers were designed for both the
T-DNA anchor and the AGS1 gene. Primary PCR reactions
in which OSU4 represented 1/200th or 1/800th of the population were used as templates after 1:1000, 1:10,000, and
1:100,000 dilution in H2O. As shown in Figure 1C, this
process eliminated the false-positive band observed in the
primary PCR reactions. The ags1::T-DNA specific amplicon could be detected after either 1:1000 or 1:10,000 dilution of the primary PCR reaction. No ags1::T-DNA
amplicon was produced when OSU4 was absent in the
primary reaction template DNA. These data demonstrate
that PCR can be an efficient screening technique to probe
mutant pools for a clone in which a T-DNA element has
inserted into a target gene. We selected a target pool size
of approximately 200 insertion mutants as a balance
between increased throughput afforded by larger pools
but easier subdivision of smaller pools into individual
clones to recover the detected mutant strain (see below).

as those used for shipments of molecular biology

With an estimated 9000-10,000 genes encoded by the Histoplasma genome, this collection does not represent the
number of insertion mutants required for saturation of
the genome. We used two probability functions to estimate the size of the library required for a 95% chance of
isolating an insertion in a particular locus in the 40 megabase NAm 2 genome. Both calculations assume no bias
in insertion sites. Based on the number of predicted genes,
the Poisson approach estimates a library of approximately
30,000 insertions would be required. The single study in
which multiple alleles of a single locus were isolated in
Histoplasma (five AGS1 alleles isolated in a screen of
50,000 insertions; [23]) supports the Poisson calculation;
five alleles would be the most probable number of alleles
based on a 9000 or 10,000 target estimate. However, the
AGS1 gene is an unusually large target and thus this
number is probably an underestimate. An alternative calculation based solely on average gene size is provided by:
P = 1-(1-x/G)n where P is the probability of the T-DNA
inserting in a given target of size x in a genome of size G
with n the total number of T-DNA insertion mutants [35].
Assuming an average gene size of 2000 nucleotides, this
calculation estimates a library of nearly 60,000 mutants
would be required for a 95% probability of obtaining at
least one insertion mutant in any given gene. Such a
mutant bank would require 300 pools with an average
pool size of 200 and PCR screening could be easily performed using three 96-well plates. Although our current
collection of 4000 mutants is inadequate for complete
genome coverage, it was sufficient to demonstrate proofof-concept through identification and recovery of a
mutant at the CBP1 locus.

tumefaciens and Histoplasma yeast cells. Co-cultures were
plated onto filters and Histoplasma transformants selected
by transferring filters to medium containing hygromycin
to which resistance is provided by sequences within the TDNA element [23]. Transformant yeast cells were collected and suspensions from individual plates combined
to create pools derived from 100 to 200 independent
mutant colonies. Yeast cell suspensions were diluted into
fresh medium and allowed to grow for 24-48 hours.
Twenty-four pools were prepared representing roughly
4000 insertion mutants. A portion of each culture was
reserved for nucleic acid isolation and the remainder frozen in aliquots and stored at -80°C. Nucleic acids were
purified from each pool, diluted to 50 ng/ul, and stored at
-20°C until analysis by PCR.

Recovery of the cbp1 insertion mutant
To isolate the strain containing the cbp1::T-DNA mutation, we recovered yeast cells from pool #12 and segregated the pool into individual clones. The insertion was
tracked using PCR with the primers described earlier. Pool
#12 was thawed and dilutions plated to recover individual
cfu's. As each pool represents 100-200 clones, we screened
286 clones to increase the likelihood of recovering at least
one strain with the detected CBP1 insertion mutation. To
drastically reduce the number of nucleic acid preparations
and PCR tests required to screen nearly 300 individuals,
we employed an addressing scheme (schematically shown
in Figure 4A). Each clone was picked into individual wells
of three 96-well plates containing liquid medium. For
each 96-well plate, wells from each row and from each
column were pooled to produce 20 yeast suspensions. An
aliquot of these row and column sub-pools from each
plate were combined to create a yeast suspension repre-

deletion of the encoding gene in a Panama class strain of
Histoplasma [20]. Two CBP1 gene-specific primers were
designed at the 3' end of the CBP1 coding region and were
oriented towards the 5' end of the gene. As the T-DNA element could insert with either the T-DNA left border or the
right border oriented towards the 3' end of the CBP1 gene,
we screened each mutant pool by PCR with RB3 or with
LB6 primers in combination with the CBP1-21 gene-specific primer. While PCR reactions with the LB6 + CBP1-21
primer set did not produce any positive PCR products
with any of the templates (data not shown), reactions
with RB3 and CBP1-21 primers produced amplicons in
two different pools (Figure 3A, lanes 2 and 12). Low
abundance bands less than 100 bp are likely primer dimers or residual RNA from the template nucleic acids and
were thus not considered. A nested PCR reaction was performed on the RB3-set of reactions (Figure 3B). The PCR
product from pool 2 did not re-amplify in the nested PCR
reaction suggesting that this product was a non-specific
amplicon. Alternatively, the pool may indeed harbor an
insertion of T-DNA sequence in the CBP1 locus but the TDNA element could be truncated and the nested RB
primer-binding site lost resulting in failure to amplify in
the nested PCR. The nested PCR reaction from pool 12
produced a very prominent, approximately 800 bp amplicon consistent with an insertion in the DNA upstream of
the CBP1 coding region (Figure 3B, lane 12). Sequencing
of this amplicon confirmed insertion of the T-DNA in the
CBP1 promoter and localized the insertion 234 base pairs
upstream of the CBP1 start codon (Figure 3C). Although a
faint band was observed in the secondary PCR from pool
#4, no product was detected in the primary reaction and
it's abundance was much lower than that of the validated
amplicon from pool #12. Thus, it was discarded as a candidate.

harbor multiple integrations of the T-DNA element.

To further characterize the T-DNA insertion in OSU8, we
amplified and sequenced the DNA flanking the T-DNA
element. PCR amplicons were produced for both the left
and right border flanking regions using T-DNA specific
primers and CBP1 specific primers (data not shown).
Alignment of the flanking regions with the Histoplasma
G217B genome and T-DNA sequences showed truncation
of the T-DNA imperfect direct repeats by 5 bp from the left
border and 24 bp from the right border. Additionally, the
T-DNA insertion event deleted 175 base pairs of the CBP1
promoter surrounding the site of insertion (Figure 3C).
Due to T-DNA-induced genetic rearrangements that can
occur, PCR-product sizes should be used only as an initial
estimate of the location of T-DNA integration and the precise location of the insertion confirmed by sequencing the
DNA flanking the T-DNA element. As our PCR screening
method would not detect multiple T-DNA integrations,
we performed a Southern blot using a T-DNA-specific
probe to determine how many T-DNA elements were
present in the OSU8 mutagenized genome. As shown in
Figure 3D, only one band is detected indicating the OSU8
strain harbors a single T-DNA insertion. This 3.8 kb TDNA probe-hybridizing fragment is the size predicted for
the described insertion in the CBP1 promoter. No T-DNA
sequences were detected in the parental WU15 strain.
Validation of the cbp1 mutant
Since the T-DNA insertion in OSU8 did not lie within the
CBP1 gene but was instead located in the sequence
upstream of the CBP1 coding sequence, we tested whether
the recovered mutant had lost the ability to produce the
Cbp1 protein. The T-DNA insertion site lies within the
region defined as the CBP1 promoter [36]; transcriptional
fusion constructs with less than 689 base pairs of
sequence upstream of CBP1 do not support transcription.
Thus, insertion of 5 kb of foreign sequence (i.e. the T-DNA
element) into this region should disrupt promoter activity. OSU8 and the parent WU15 strain were grown to early
stationary phase and cell-free supernatants were prepared.
To determine whether Cbp1 production was impaired in

senting the clones from the entire 96-well plate. Nucleic
acids were isolated from the three 96-well plate suspensions and subjected to PCR. The cbp1::T-DNA insertion
amplicon was detected in two of the three collections of
96 (data not shown). For one of these pools of 96 individual clones, nucleic acids were isolated from the corresponding row and column sub-pools and PCR was used
to screen for the T-DNA insertion. Positive amplicons
were detected in sub-pools representing the clone located
at B4 (Figure 4B). The suspension of yeast was recovered
from well B4 and plated on solid medium to recover individual colonies. PCR performed on nucleic acids prepared
from one of these colonies confirmed the identity and
recovery of the desired insertion at the CBP1 locus. The
strain with this insertion was designated OSU8.

The T-DNA insertion in CBP1 prevents production of
the Cbp1 protein. Culture supernatants from the cbp1::TDNA insertion (OSU8) lack the Cbp1 protein whereas culture supernatants from CBP1(+) yeast cells (WU15) show
abundant production of Cbp1. Cell-free culture supernatants
were prepared from late log/early stationary phase cultures
of Histoplasma yeast and the major secreted proteins separated by electrophoresis. The Cbp1 protein runs as a 9-11
kD band. Positive identification of this band as Cbp1 was
determined by loss of the 9-11 kD protein band from supernatants derived from a CBP1-RNAi strain (OSU38). A strain
harboring a gfp-RNAi plasmid (OSU37) was used to show
specific depletion of Cbp1 by CBP1-RNAi in OSU38. The
secreted 20 kD protein produced by all strains was used to
normalize supernatant loadings.
OSU8, we separated supernatant proteins by poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized the proteins by
silver staining. Supernatants from the CBP1(+) WU15
strain had a prominent 9-11 kD protein which was not
detected in supernatants harvested from the OSU8 culture
(Figure 5) indicating the cbp1::T-DNA insertion disrupts
production of Cbp1 protein. The identity of this protein
was confirmed as Cbp1 since supernatant from a strain in
which Cbp1 was independently depleted by RNAi also
specifically lacked this protein band. Thus, while the TDNA insertion does not interrupt the coding region, insertion into the CBP1 promoter effectively prevents production of Cbp1 in OSU8.

Conclusion
We have developed a reverse genetics procedure employing random mutagenesis and PCR-based screening techniques to identify insertion mutants in a targeted gene in

Histoplasma capsulatum without regard to a mutant phenotype. Since the mutagen creates a large insertion, the
majority of mutations should reflect the knock-out
mutant phenotype. However, insertions within the promoter of a gene may allow some residual transcription
resulting in hypomorphic but not null phenotypes. In
such cases, as demonstrated by our cbp1:T-DNA mutant,
delineation of the minimal promoter of a targeted gene
could resolve what type of phenotype the insertion mutation would likely produce. Thus, the regions most likely to
produce mutant phenotypes are the proximal promoter
and the coding region of the targeted gene. Consequently,
we routinely design our PCR screening primers at the 3'
end of the gene to amplify these regions in particular and
maximize the targeted site for insertions. This process, as
with any mutational approach, will not successfully isolate insertion mutations in genes essential for viability,
and if the intended target is suspect to be such, RNAi may
prove more beneficial. While integration of T-DNA into
the Histoplasma genome appears relatively random, large
scale studies in Magnaporthe, Leptosphaeria, and Arabidopsis
indicate there is a bias for insertion of the T-DNA element
into non-coding regions [37-40]. In addition, occurrence
of large-scale deletions or rearrangement mutations will
be missed by this approach. Thus, more insertion mutants
may be required for saturation mutagenesis of the Histoplasma genome than calculated above.
The reverse genetics process detailed here increases the
repertoire of methods available to disrupt gene functions
in Histoplasma capsulatum. Since Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation has been developed as an efficient mutagen for a variety of fungal species [41], this procedure
should be readily applicable to those microorganisms as
well. For intractable fungal systems where homologous
recombination is very limited or allelic replacement
unfeasible, this process provides the ability to disrupt
gene functions necessary for functional genetic tests. The
only requirement is an efficient insertional mutagen. The
increased capability to disrupt gene functions in Histoplasma and in other fungi will greatly improve our mechanistic understanding of fungal biology.

(ATCC 26032) and are listed in Table 1. WU15 is a uracil
auxotroph due to mutation of the URA5 gene [23]. OSU4
was derived from WU15 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and harbors a T-DNA insertion in the AGS1
gene. Histoplasma capsulatum was grown in HMM medium
at 37°C with 5% CO2/95% air with shaking (200 rpm) as
previously described [42]. For platings, HMM was solidified with 0.6% agarose (USB) and 25 uM FeSO4 was
added. HMM was supplemented with uracil (100 ug/ml)
for growth of uracil auxotrophs and hygromycin B (200
ug/ml) for selection of T-DNA insertion mutants.
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of
Histoplasma
Agrobacterium tumefaciens was used to transform Histoplasma capsulatum yeast using modifications to previously
described protocols [23,31]. A. tumefaciens strain
LBA1100 was transformed with pCM41, an engineered
plasmid containing a hygromycin resistance cassette
flanked by the left and right border T-DNA sequences
[23]. A. tumefaciens harboring pCM41 was grown in LC
media [43] containing 100 ug/ml kanamycin and 250 ug/
ml spectinomycin to select for the T-DNA and Ti plasmids, respectively. Liquid LC media was inoculated with
10 colonies and grown overnight at 25°C with shaking
(250 rpm). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation
(5000 × g) and resuspended in 5 volumes Agrobacterium
induction medium [IM-- 44] and grown for approximately 16 hours at 25°C with shaking. Complete induction medium contained 0.2% glucose, antibiotics, and
200 uM acetosyringone and was buffered to pH 5.3 with
MES. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in induction medium to an optical density at 600
nm of 1.5 (corresponding to roughly 1.5 × 109 bacteria/
ml). Histoplasma WU15 yeast were harvested from solid
HMM + uracil medium seeded 3 days earlier with 4 × 105
yeast/cm2. Yeast were collected by flooding plates with 5
mls HMM medium and scraping with a sterile spreader.
Yeast were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g) and
resuspended in induction medium at a density of 5 × 108
yeast/ml as determined by hemacytometer counts. For cocultivation, 1.5 × 108 Agrobacterium cells were mixed with
5 × 107 Histoplasma yeast in a total volume of 400 ul and
spread on Whatman #5 filter paper placed on top of solid
induction medium supplemented with 0.7 mM cystine
and 100 ug/ml uracil. Plates were incubated for 48 hrs at
25°C after which filters were transferred to selection
medium (HMM + uracil + hygromycin + 200 uM cefotaxime) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2/95% air until
Histoplasma transformants became visible (10-14 days).
Six cm diameter plates were used so that roughly 50-100
transformants were obtained per plate.

cells with a sterile spreader. Suspensions from individual
plates were combined to obtain pools representing 100200 independent transformant colonies. Yeast suspensions were diluted 1:10 into 10 mls HMM + uracil and
grown for 24-48 hours. Two milliliters of culture were collected for nucleic acid isolation and the remaining culture
frozen in 1 ml aliquots for later recovery of yeast.
To purify Histoplasma nucleic acid for PCR, cells were collected by centrifugation (2000 × g) and nucleic acids
released by mechanical disruption of yeast in the presence
of detergents and organic solvent [45]. 250 ul of lysis
buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA,
2% SDS, 4% Triton X-100) and 250 ul of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) were added to cells and
nucleic acids released by bead beating cells with 0.5 mmdiameter acid-washed glass beads. Phases were separated
by centrifugation (5 minutes at 14,000 × g) and the aqueous phase transferred to new tubes. Nucleic acids were
recovered by precipitation of the aqueous phase with 2.5
volumes of ethanol. As no efforts were taken to remove
RNA co-purifying with the DNA, total nucleic acids were
quantified by spectrophotometric readings at 260 nm
Screening of pools was done by two sequential PCR steps.
Primers used are listed in Table 2. For the primary PCR, 50
ng of total nucleic acid was used as template in a 25 ul
reaction with either a left border (e.g., LB6) or right border
primer (e.g., RB3) and a primer specific for the gene of
interest. 30 cycles of PCR were performed and the reaction
diluted 1:10,000 before use as template in a nested PCR
reaction employing a gene specific primer in conjunction
with a nested left border or right border primer (LB8 or
RB6, respectively). Thirty cycles were performed for the
nested PCR followed by electrophoretic separation of
products in 1% agarose gels. The following program was
used for amplification reactions: 2 min at 94°C; 30 cycles
of 10 seconds at 94°C, 15 seconds at 54°C, and 2 minutes
at 72°C. Amplifications used Taq polymerase (Invitro-

gen). Pools yielding PCR products were confirmed by
repeating the PCR with single primer controls as well as
the combined primer set.
Addressing and recovery of T-DNA insertion mutants
Yeast from pools showing a positive PCR were thawed
from frozen stocks and dilutions were plated on solid
HMM + uracil medium to obtain individual clones. One
millimeter-diameter colonies were individually picked
into 150 ul of HMM + uracil medium in 96-well plates
and 25 ul from the wells of each row and column pooled
using a multi-channel pipettor. The remaining yeast suspension in the 96-well plate was grown at 37°C with 5%
CO2/95% air while addressing PCR was performed.
Nucleic acids were prepared from the row and column
pools and used as template for PCR. Yeast were recovered
from positive wells and plated on solid medium. Single
clones were isolated and template nucleic acids prepared
for use in PCR. PCR amplicons were purified and
sequenced to confirm and localize the insertion in the
gene of interest.
Southern blot analysis of T-DNA insertion mutants
T-DNA mutant and WU15 genomic DNAs were prepared
and digested overnight with Hind III. Nucleic acid fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and
transferred to a Nytran membrane using a vacuum blot
apparatus. Fragments were fixed to the membrane by
ultraviolet irradiation (254 nm wavelength, 120,000 uJ/
cm2; Stratalinker UV Crosslinker, Stratagene). A nucleic
acid probe from the right side of the T-DNA element was
prepared by PCR and labeled using the AlkPhos Direct
Labeling System (Amersham). The T-DNA probe was
hybridized to the membrane and was detected by chemiluminescence using the CDP-Star reagent (Amersham).
Cryopreservation of Histoplasma yeast
Histoplasma yeast were collected from exponential or early
stationary phase cultures and added to vials containing

either glycerol or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). For rapid
freezing, vials were mixed and then placed immediately in
a rack at -80°C. For gradual freezing, vials were placed
within a styrofoam container which was then placed at 80°C. After 24 hours, vials were transferred to racks and
stored at -80°C. For recovery, vials were thawed by incubation in a 37°C water bath followed by addition of 2 volumes 37°C HMM. Serial 5-fold dilutions were plated on
solid HMM + uracil medium to enumerate viable colony
forming units (cfu) for each freezing condition and results
were compared to cfu counts before freezing.
Cbp1 production assay
Histoplasma yeast were grown in liquid HMM media to an
optical density at 595 nm of 3.2 - 3.8. Histoplasma yeast
were removed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 2000 × g.
The supernatant was further clarified by centrifugation for
5 minutes at 15,000 × g. SDS- and DTT-containing protein
sample buffer was added to culture supernatants and the
proteins separated by 12% poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Tris-tricine buffer system. The major culture filtrate proteins were visualized by silver staining of
gels.
