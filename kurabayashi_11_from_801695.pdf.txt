Abstract
Background: Microhylidae is a geographically widespread family of anurans. Although several extensive molecular
analyses have attempted to elucidate their subfamilial relationships, and correlate these with Mesozoic and
Cenozoic continental drifts, consensus has not been reached. Further, generic level relationships have not been
well investigated in some microhylid subfamilies, and therefore subfamilial affiliations of some genera are still
unclear. To elucidate the phylogenetic positions of two mysterious Asian genera, Gastrophrynoides and Phrynella,
and to better understand the trans-continental distributions of microhylid taxa, we performed molecular
phylogenetic and dating analyses using the largest molecular dataset applied to these taxa to date.
Results: Six nuclear and two mitochondrial genes (approx. 8 kbp) were sequenced from 22 microhylid frog species
representing eight subfamilies. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses could not fully elucidate the
subfamilial relationships, suggesting a rapid radiation of these taxa between 85 and 66 million years ago. In
contrast, generic relationships of Asian microhylines were generally well resolved.
Conclusion: Our results clearly showed that one of two problematic Asian genera, Phrynella, was nested in the
clade of the Asian subfamily Microhylinae. By contrast, Gastrophrynoides occupied the most basal position of the
Australian-New Guinean subfamily Asterophryinae. The estimated divergence of Gastrophrynoides from other
asterophryine was unexpectedly around 48 million years ago. Although a colonization scenario via Antarctica to
the Australian-New Guinean landmass has been suggested for Asterophryinae, our finding suggested a novel
colonization route via Indo-Eurasia.

Background
Microhylidae is a large anuran family containing 487
species equivalent to 8% of all frogs [1]. This family
belongs to the phylogenetically-nested anuran group,
Neobatrachia, and forms Ranoides with Afrobatrachia
(including the families, Arthroleptidae, Brevicipitidae,
Hemisotidae, and Hyperoliidae) and Natatanura (= Ranidae sensu lato).
Members of the Microhylidae occur in most continents and several large islands, i.e., Africa, Eurasia (not

in the subcontinent of Europe), South and North
America, Australia, New Guinea, and Madagascar.
Since Frost et al. [1], the subfamilial classification of
this family had been largely modified based on new
findings from several molecular phylogenetic studies
[2,3]. Consequently, eleven microhylid subfamilies are
now recognized [4] and each subfamily generally
occurs in one landmass area derived from the Gondwana supercontinent as follows: Asterophryinae (Australia-New Guinea); Cophylinae, Dyscophinae, and
Scaphiophryninae (Madagascar); Gastrophryninae and
Otophryninae (South and North America); Hoplophryninae and Phrynomerinae (Africa); and Kalophryninae,
Melanobatrachinae, and Microhylinae (Asia). Despite

comprehensive phylogenetic studies, the subfamilial
relationships have not been well elucidated (see Additional file 1). Further, this family contains 12 genera
for which subfamilial affiliations have not been investigated [4]. The majority of these genera occur in South
America, but two taxa are distributed in Asia. These
mysterious genera contain only one to three species
and difficulty in collecting them has prevented herpetologists from using them in phylogenetic study.
Recently, we succeeded in obtaining specimens of the
problematic Asian genera, Gastrophrynoides and Phrynella. Originally, Gastrophrynoides was a monotypic
genus but the specimen used here is a newly found
species of this genus (G. immaculatus) [5].
Because of their transcontinental distribution, microhylids have been regarded as an attractive research target for biogeography studies. Since Savage [6], several
biogeographic scenarios that incorporate the Plate tectonics theory and breaking up the Gondwanan landmass, have been proposed to explain the transcontinental distribution of anuran taxa including microhylids [3]. Two molecular phylogenetic and dating analyses that aimed to elucidate the higher phylogeny,
divergence ages, and formation process of the transcontinental distribution of microhylid taxa were recently
performed [2,3]. These studies that used different taxa
and molecular data resulted in different relationships
and divergence ages for microhylid subfamilies. Consequently, consensus on a biogeographic scenario to
explain the microhylid distribution pattern has not been
reached. Furthermore, although these studies proposed
different colonization scenarios for many microhylid
taxa, they agree on a similar Antarctic route scenario for
the Australian-New Guinean taxon (Asterophryinae), as
suggested in other vertebrate taxa distributed in Australia (e.g., marsupials, ratite bird, chelid turtles, and hyloid
frogs [7]).
It is generally considered that employing long
sequence data, and increased taxon sampling in
molecular phylogenetic inference, can clarify problematic phylogenetic relationships [8-10]. Thus, in this
study, we sequenced two mitochondrial (mt) and six
nuclear genes (total 8 kbp) from 22 microhylid specimens comprising eight out of 11 microhylid subfamilies, to determine the phylogenetic positions of the
two problematic Asian microhylid genera, and reexamine the phylogenetic relationships and divergence ages of microhylid subfamilies with the long
sequence data and additional samples. Based on our
finding for the phylogenetic position and divergence
age of the genus Gastrophrynoides, we advance a
novel colonizing scenario for the Australian-New
Guinean microhylids.

Results and discussion
Molecular phylogenetic analyses

The 35 specimens analyzed in this study are shown in
Table 1. Briefly, we used 22 microhylid specimens from
eight out of 11 known subfamilies, four afrobatrachians,
five natatanurans, two hyloids, and two archaeobatrachians. From these specimens, we sequenced two mt
and six nuclear genes approx. 8 kbp in total.
Adding our data to that from two previous studies
[2,3], we produced the longest aligned dataset (Aln-1,
7164 nucleotide sites) so far used with these taxa (see
Methods section). Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian interference (BI) analyses were performed on this
dataset. The resultant ML tree is shown in Figure 1.
The BI tree recovered an identical topology, except that
one branch that was resolved in the ML tree collapsed
to a trichotomy in the BI tree (see Figure 1). Our ML
and BI trees strongly supported the monophyly of the
family Microhylidae, the monophyly of each microhylid
subfamily (sensu after Frost et al. [1]), and the generic
relationships within each subfamily (with the exception
of several microhyline genera, see below). Unfortunately,
these trees could not fully elucidate subfamilial relationships (see below).
Relationships of microhylid subfamilies

The two most basal nodes among the microhylids, Phrynomerinae and Hoplophryninae, are both African in distribution. The remaining subfamilies are divided into
two clades. One clade consists of two Asian, one Australian-New Guinean, and one Madagascan taxa, i.e.,
Kalophryninae + (Asterophryinae + (Dyscophinae +
Microhylinae)). The subfamilial relationships within this
clade were well supported by bootstrap probabilities
(BPs = 84-94%) and Bayesian posterior probabilities
(BPPs = 100%). The other clade includes one American
and two Madagascan taxa, Gastrophryninae + (Cophylinae + Scaphiophryninae). The relationships within this
clade and among the basal African taxa were not
strongly supported by either BP or BPP values.
Many alternative relationships have been suggested for
these poorly-supported groups [1-3, and see Additional
file 1]. We evaluated these alternatives using the likelihood based Approximately Unbiased (AU) and KishinoHasegawa (KH) tests and could not reject four of ten
alternative relationships for the African, American, and
Madagascan taxa (topologies 2-11 in Table 2). Considering the similar likelihood scores among our ML tree
and the alternative topologies (topologies 1, 3-5, and 11
in Table 2), the lack of statistical difference may be due
to low phylogenetic signal in the DNA sequences due to
ancient rapid divergences of these microhylid taxa (85 66 Ma; see below).

reject most alternative relationships proposed in previous studies (topologies 12-16 in Table 2). However, an
alternative Kalophryninae position suggested by van der
Meijden et al. [3] could not be rejected (topology 14 in
Table 2). Furthermore, when we used a data subset
(Aln-3) that contained a member of the subfamily Melanobatrachinae not present in the Aln-1 dataset, a different Kalophryninae position, Melanobatrachinae +
(Cophylinae + Kalophryninae)), was recovered (Additional file 1). This suggests that the melanobatrachini
data affected the Kalophryninae position. In contrast to
the Kalophryninae case, the Asterophryinae + (Dyscophinae + Microhylinae) clade was well supported by two
data subsets having different taxon samplings (Aln-2
and 3; Additional File 1). Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies also suggested this clade and the relationships within [3,4]. Thus, the monophyly of these

Australian-New Guinean, Madagascan, and Asian taxa
seems to be well established.
Phylogenetic positions of mysterious microhylid genera

In this study, two Asian genera, Phrynella and Gastrophrynoides, of which subfamilial affiliations have not
been investigated, were analyzed. Our ML and BI trees
resulted in the genus Phrynella being nested in the
Asian subfamily Microhylinae (Figure 1). By contrast,
the genus Gastrophrynoides did not become a member
of the Asian group, rather this taxon possessed the most
basal position of the members of the Australasian-New
Guinean subfamily, Asterophryinae (ML BP and BPP =
100%). The AU and KH tests clearly rejected the ânonmonophyly of Gastrophrynoides and asterophryinesâ (P
< 0.01; topology 17 in Table 2). Furthermore, the most
basal position of Gastrophrynoides among asterophryines was also supported by our data subsets (Aln-2
and 3; ML BPs = 100% and BPPs = 100%, see Additional
file 1). Consequently, our analyses clearly elucidated the

Kurabayashi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:175
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/175

phylogenetic positions of these problematic Asian genera. Around the same time as this study, Matsui et al.
[11] suggested the Phrynella position within Microhylinae and a close relationship of Gastrophrynoides with
Asterophryinae from their analyses using 12S and 16S
gene data.
The synapomorphy of the subfamily Asterophryinae is
direct developing eggs [1]. Although the breeding ecology of the genus Gastrophrynoides is not known, the
pigment-less eggs and rudimentary webbings in G. borneensis [12] suggest direct development. Thus, we transiently regard this genus as a member of the subfamily
Asterophryinae. Furthermore, the distribution of another
asterophryine genus, Oreophryne, in islands of SouthEast Asia (e.g., Philippines, Sulawesi, and Bali) has been
noted [4,13]. However, asterophryine species have not
been reported from mainland Eurasia. Thus, G. immaculatus from the Malay Peninsula is the first record of
the occurrence of a species belonging to the asterophryine lineage in mainland Eurasia.
Generic relationships within Microhylinae

This study contains the first molecular phylogenetic
analysis that covers all known microhyline genera (in
Aln-3 data subset, see Additional file 1). Our analyses
largely elucidated the phylogenetic relationships of
microhyline genera, excluding the positions of Kaloula
spp., Chaperina, and Micryletta (see below). The ML
and BI trees from the Aln-1 dataset obtained the two
major clades for microhyline genera with good statistical
support: the Microhyla + (Calluella + Glyphoglossus)
clade and the clade including Kaloula, Metaphrynella,
Phrynella, and Ramanella (Figure 1). In the latter clade,
the monophyly of Metaphrynella and Phrynella was
strongly suggested (ML BP and BPP = 100%). Our data
subsets also supported this clade (Additional file 1).
Thus, the precise phylogenetic position of the genus
Phrynella within the subfamily Microhylinae is clearly
elucidated.
It is noteworthy that our analyses suggested the polyphyly of the genus Kaloula (Figure 1). The AU and KH
tests clearly rejected the monophyly of this genus (data
not shown). Our data subsets and the analyses of Van
Bocxlaer et al. [2] also suggested that Kaloula as
currently delimited is not a natural group (Additional
file 1). Because K. pulchra (one of the two Kaloula species used here) is the type species of the genus Kaloula,
the generic name of K. taprobanica might be altered in
a future study.
Divergence times of microhylid taxa

Using two data subsets (Aln-2d and Aln-3d) for which
we had greater taxon sampling and our ML tree topology (see Additional file 2), we estimated divergence

Page 6 of 12

times. Three distinct combinations of calibration points
were applied for each dataset, for a total six dating calculations (A-F). The estimated divergence times from
these calibrations are summarized in Table 3, and the
detailed results are shown in Additional file 3.
Similar divergence ages of microhylid taxa were estimated from the six calibrations; for most microhylid
nodes, the median age estimated from one calibration
was overlapped by the 95% confidence interval (CI)
values from the other calibrations. The exceptions were
several node ages that differed between the calibrations
A and F. The average ages (and mean difference = MD)
of the six calibrations for major microhylid divergence
events are as follows (Table 3). (I) 132.6 Ma (MD = 9.6)
for the split of microhylids from other ranoids. (II) 84.8
Ma (MD = 8.4) for the initial divergence of extant
microhylid subfamilies (i.e., split of Phrynomerinae from
other microhylids). (III) 81.7 Ma (MD = 8.2) for the
divergence of Hoplophryninae from the remaining
microhylid subfamilies. (IV) 78.4 Ma (MD = 8.1) for
split of the Gastrophryninae + (Cophylinae + Scaphiophryninae) lineage. (V) 75.3 Ma (MD = 7.9) for the split
of Kalophryninae from the Asterophryinae + (Dyscophinae + Microhylinae) clade. (VI) 70.6 Ma (MD = 7.7) for
the splits of Asterophryinae from the Dyscophinae +
Microhylinae clade. (VII) 67.2 Ma (MD = 7.6) for the
split of Dyscophinae and Microhylinae. (VIII) 76.0 Ma
(MD = 7.9) for the split of Gastrophryninae from the
Cophylinae + Scaphiophryninae clade. (IX) 66.3 Ma
(MD = 6.8) for the split of Cophylinae and Scaphiophryninae. (X) 47.8 Ma (MD = 5.4) for the split of Gastrophrynoides from asterophryine genera. (XI) 24.5 Ma
(MD = 5.4) for the initial divergence of asterophryine
genera (excluding Gastrophrynoides).
Additional calibrations (G-J) based on two alternative
topologies (the ML topologies inferred from the Aln-2
and Aln-3 data subsets) also estimated similar ages for
these microhylid divergences (Additional files 4 and 5).
Two previous molecular dating studies (Table 3) have
focused on these taxa. Our divergence times are similar
to those from Van Bocxlaer et al. [2], but are slightly
older than those from van der Meijden et al. [3].
Based on our estimations, the microhylid subfamilies
diverged between 85 and 66 Ma (nodes II-IX in Table 3
and Figure 1). These estimated ages suggest a rapid
radiation of major microhylid lineages, within less than
20 Ma during the late Cretaceous. According to traditional Plate-Tectonic theory, Gondwanan landmasses
(Africa, South America, Madagascar-India, and Australia) had already fragmented (â 100 Ma [e.g., 14]) by this
time. Thus, although several vicariance hypotheses
based on Gondwanan fragmentation have been proposed
for the trans-continental distribution of microhylids [see
3], our results can definitively reject a strictly vicariant

scenario. Rather, our estimated dates fit a dispersal
hypotheses (including overseas dispersal) [3] and/or the
prolonged existence of land connections among the
fragmented Gondwana landmasses [2].
Colonization route of Australian-New Guinean taxa

This study could not resolve relationships among many
microhylid subfamilies. However, the clade of Madagascan Dyscophinae + Asian Microhylidae and the sister
relationship of Australian-New Guinean Asterophryinae
with this clade are well established. Furthermore, we
revealed that the genus Gastrophrynoides, which is only
found in areas derived from the Eurasian landmass (Borneo and the Malay Peninsula), occupies the most basal
phylogenetic position among asterophryines, and this
taxon split from other asterophryine lineages during the
Eocene (around 48 Ma).
An Antarctic route (across a land bridge existing until
55 Ma or less [e.g., 13]) has been postulated by two
independent studies [2,3] as the colonization route of

Asterophryinae into the Australian-New Guinean landmass. However, our new phylogenetic placement of the
genus Gastrophrynoides and the estimated divergence
times of Gastrophrynoides from its related taxa seem to
suggest an alternative colonization pathway, from Asia
to the New Guinean landmass, for Asterophryinae
(Figure 2). In this context, the lineage split between
Asterophryinae and Microhylinae (and Dyscophinae)
occurred in the Indian landmass during the late Cretaceous (around 70 Ma), and these ancestors colonized
Asia by the collision of India and Eurasia. The lineages
of Gastrophrynoides and other asterophryines split during the Eocene (around 48 Ma, the same time as the
date of the collision). Then, the ancestor of major asterophryines moved from Asia to the Australian-New Guinean landmass via islands and/or short sea straits
around the late Oligocene (25 Ma) when both landmasses had been closing, and Southeast Asian islands
had been uplifting [15]. If the ancestor had acquired the
direct development characteristics, the synapomorphy of

asterophryines, which can eliminate the use of a freshwater environment for the egg and tadpole development,
oversea dispersal of this ancestor would have occurred
relatively easily [16]. Finally, radiation of asterophryines
mainly occurred in the New Guinean area and several
lineages moved to Australia.
Compared with the Antarctic route, our proposed scenario accounts well for the very low species diversity of
asterophryines in Australia (19 species, only 7% of all
asterophryines [13]) relative to that on New Guinea and
for the recent divergence time of asterophryines (< 25
Ma), both of which are difficult to explain in the Antarctic scenario [3]. Furthermore, to explain the placement of Gastrophrynoides under the Antarctic scenario,
one would have to assume long-distance overseas dispersal of the Gastrophrynoides lineage from Australia to
Asia during the Eocene, when the Southeast Asian
islands had not yet formed, followed by the extinction
of basal asterophrynine taxa (including the Gastrophrynoides lineage) only in Australian and New Guinean
areas.
A weakness of our Asian route scenario is a lack of
confidence in the sister taxon of the Asterophryinae +
(Dyscophinae + Microhylinae) clade, the limited taxon
sampling of asterophryines in our analyses, and the
absence of other basal taxa belonging to the asterophryine lineage in other Asian areas, especially in India.
Thus, to support our hypothesis, further phylogenetic
studies, ideally supplemented by the discovery of new
fossils, and more comprehensive surveys for living
microhylids in Asian areas will be necessary. Undoubtedly, the discovery of the unique taxon Gastrophrynoides
from Asian area has revealed a new concept for the
asterophryine evolution. Further this finding has significance to show the possible presence of further microhylid taxa with unexpected evolutionary backgrounds and
give a basis for future paleontological and biogeographic
studies of Asian anurans.

Conclusions
In this study, we performed phylogenetic analyses for
higher microhylid taxa with the largest molecular data
so far applied. Our results clearly indicate that one of
two problematic Asian genera, Phrynella, is a member
of the Asian subfamily Microhylinae. By contrast, Gastrophrynoides possesses the most basal position of the
Australian-New Guinean subfamily Asterophryinae
(Figure 1), and it is estimated that Gastrophrynoides
split from other asterophryine occurred around 48 Ma
(Table 3). The presence of the most basal asterophryine
taxon in the Eurasian area suggests the colonization
route from Asia to Australia for asterophryines
(Figure 2), although a colonization scenario via Antarctica to the Australian-New Guinean landmass has been

Page 9 of 12

suggested for Asterophryinae. The biogeographic findings on Gastrophrynoides imply the possible occurrence
of further microhylid taxa with unexpected evolutionary
backgrounds and give a basis for future paleontological
and biogeographic studies of Asian anurans.

Methods
Taxonomic names and frog specimens used

Since Frost et al. [1], taxonomic ranks and names of
many anuran taxa including microhylids have changed
frequently. To avoid needless confusion, in this paper,
taxonomic ranks and names followed Frost et al. [1] and
Frost [4], respectively. The 35 specimens analyzed here
are shown in Table 1.
PCR and sequencing

Total genomic DNA was extracted from muscle tissue
of each specimen using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN)
according to the manufacturerâs protocol. From the total
DNA, partial portions of two mt genes, 16S ribosomal
RNA (16S, approx. 0.9 kbp) and Cytochrome c oxidase
subunit I (cox1, approx. 0.8 kbp), and six nuclear encoding genes, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf,
approx. 0.7 kbp), chemokine receptor 4 (cxcr4, approx.
0.7 kbp), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (ncx1, approx. 1.3 kbp),
recombination-activating proteins 1 and 2 (rag1 and
rag2, approx. 1.6 and 1.2 kbp, respectively) and tyrosinase (tyr, approx. 0.7 kbp), were amplified by PCR.
These gene portions cover almost all sequence regions
of the alignment data used in two previous molecular
phylogenetic studies of microhylids (16S, ncx1, cxcr4,
and rag1 [2]; cox1, bdnf, tyr, rag1 and rag2 [3]), and the
amplification primers used here basically followed these
studies. The detailed sequences of PCR and sequencing
primers are available upon request (to AK). PCR
mixtures were prepared with an Ex-Taq Kit (TaKaRa
Bio) or a KOD-FX Kit (TOYOBO) according to the
manufacturerâs protocols. The resultant PCR fragments
were purified by ExoSAP-It for PCR Clean-Up kit (US
Biochemical) and ethanol precipitation. The gene
sequences were directly determined from the purified
PCR fragments with a BigDye Â® Terminator cycle
sequencing kit and an automated DNA sequencer
(ABI3130xl, Applied Biosystems). The resultant
sequence data were deposited in the DNA databases
(Table 1).
Molecular phylogenetic analyses

To perform phylogenetic analyses, we produced a long
alignment dataset (Aln-1) and two data subsets (Aln-2
and Aln-3) by combining our data with that from Van
Bocxlaer et al. and/or van der Meijden et al. [2,3]
(Additional file 6). The long dataset (Aln-1) made from
the data of all three studies includes a long sequence

Kurabayashi et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:175
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/175

(7164 nucleotide sites in total) of eight gene partitions
of 42 taxa (29 microhylids from nine subfamilies, six
afrobatrachians, five natatanurans, and two hyloids).
Among these two data subsets, the Aln-2 has a middle
length sequence (4122 nucleotide sites) of five gene portions from 82 OTUs consisting of 53 microhylids from
ten subfamilies, eight afrobatrachians, seven natatanurans and three hyloids, six archaeobatrachians, a caudate,
and four other vertebrates. In Aln-2, cox1 sequences of
non-neobatrachian taxa were not used because of the
fast nucleotide substitution rate of this gene [3]. The
Aln-3 data subset includes four gene portions (2813
nucleotide sites) from 63 taxa consisting of 44 microhylids from ten microhylid subfamilies, eight afrobatrachians, nine natatanurans, and two hyloids. More
detailed information of used taxa and sequences in each
alignment data are summarized in the Additional file 7.
To make these alignments, we initially aligned each
gene portion by using MUSCLE [17] implemented in
SeaView ver. 3.2 [18]. The resultant alignments were
revised by eye using amino acid alignments as the guide.
For 16S data, ambiguous alignment sites were removed
by using Gblocks ver. 0.91 b [19] with a default parameter. Then, each gene portions were concatenated to
make the above alignment datasets. The datasets used in
this study are available from Additional file 8.
Based on the long dataset (Aln-1) and two data subsets (Aln-2 and 3), phylogenetic trees were constructed
by the ML and BI methods. Heterozygous nucleotides
occasionally found in nuclear gene sequences were
deleted (and assign as missing data). Gaps in the alignments were treated as missing data. For ML and BI analyses, partitioned models were applied. The most
appropriate substitution model for each gene portion
was estimated based on the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria (AICc1 and BIC1 [20,21]) implemented
in Kakusan3 [22] for ML and BI analyses, respectively.
In ML analyses, the parameters for nucleotide frequencies, gamma distribution (G; with eight categories), and
proportion of invariable sites were estimated by Treefinder program ver. Oct. 2008 [23]. The estimated best-fit
models for each partition are shown in Additional file 6.
The ML analyses were performed using the Treefinder, and BP values were calculated with 1000 pseudoreplications. The BI analyses were performed using
MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 [24]. Two independent runs of four
Markov chains were conducted for 11 million generations for all datasets (sampling frequency was one tree
per 100 generations for every datasets). Parameter estimates and convergence were checked with Tracer ver.
1.4 [25], and the first 1 million trees and first 3 million
trees were discarded for Aln-1 and 2 data and Aln-3
data, respectively. Node credibility of the BI tree was
evaluated by Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP). Two

Page 10 of 12

hyloids (Agalychnis callidryas and Bufo japonicus) and
zebrafish (Danio rerio) were employed as outgroups in
the analyses based on Aln-1 and-3 data and Aln-2 data,
respectively.
Our ML tree topology and alternative microhylid phylogenies suggested by previous studies [1-3] were compared in an ML framework using approximately
unbiased (AU) and Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) tests [26,27]
implemented in Treefinder. For the phylogenetic position of Gastrophrynoides, alternative topologies having
high lnL scores were searched under the ânon-monophyly of Gastrophrynoides and asterophryinesâ constraint. In this analysis, we used âare NOTâ option of
tree constraint command implemented in PAUP4.0 b
[28]. Among the trees obtained under this constraint,
one topology with the highest lnL score was also tested
(topology 17 in Table 3).
Molecular dating

Divergence time estimations using a Bayesian molecular
clock method were conducted as in previous molecular
dating analyses on microhylids [2,3]. We used two combinations of an alignment dataset and a topology, Aln-2d
+ Tree1a and Aln-3d + Tree1b (see below). Three sets of
calibration points were applied to each combination (see
below) for a total six dating analyses (calibration A-F).
The topology and the applied calibration points in each
calibration are shown in Additional file 2 and the alignment datasets used are available in Additional file 8.
The first alignment dataset used (Aln-2d) is basically
the same with the Aln-2 but cox1 and tyr sequences
were removed from the original Aln-2. This is because
these genes are unsuitable for molecular dating of
microhylid subfamilies (due to high nucleotide substitution rates [3]), and the tyr sequences did not allow us to
calculate variance-covariance matrices of branch lengths
for the designated topology (Tree1a), possibly due to
many nodes lacking supporting nucleotide changes.
Thus, Aln-2d only contains rag-1, rag-2 and bdnf
sequences (2970 nucleotide sites in total). The other
alignment data (Aln-3d) is similar to Aln-3 but this data
contains a larger number of OTUs (total 101) to allow
us to employ broad calibration points that were used in
Van Bocxlaer et al. [2]. The Aln-3d (2739 sites in total)
is slightly shorter than the original Aln-3 because of
increment of ambiguous alignment sites due to adding
OTUs. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) was employed as outgroup for both Aln-2d and-3d analyses. The two tree
topologies (Tree1a and Tree1b) used in the age calibrations were modified from the ML trees of Aln-2 and
Aln-3 datasets, respectively; they have the ML topology
of Aln-1 (= Figure 1) for microhylids, natatanurans, and
afrobatrachians (see Additional File 2), while all other
relationships were as inferred for the respective datasets.

A total 14 calibration points, based on nine fossil
records (F1-9) and five paleogeographic events (G1-5),
were applied in this study as indicated below. F1: > 330
Ma, split of Lissamphibia and Amniota (fossil of the earliest aÃ¯stopod). F2: 338 - 312 Ma, split of Diapsida and
Synapsida (fossils of early diapsids and synapsids). F3: >
230 Ma, split of Anura and Caudata (fossil of Triadobatrachus). F4: > 164 Ma, split of Costata (Alytidae and
Bombinatoridae) from other anurans (fossil of Eodiscoglossus). F5: > 151 Ma, split of Rhinophrynidae and Pipidae (fossil of Rhadinosteus). F6: > 146 Ma, split of
Cryptobranchidae and Hynobiidae (fossil of Chunepeton). F7: > 55 Ma, split of Bufonidae and other hyloid
families (fossil of the oldest Bufonidae). F8: > 29 Ma,
split of Rana (sensu lato) and other ranid genera (fossil
of the oldest Rana). F9: > 404 Ma, split of lungfishes
and tetrapods (fossil of the oldest tetrapodomorph [29]).
G1: > 110 Ma, split of Pipa and Xenopus (fragmentation
of the African and South American landmasses). G2: >
65 Ma, split of Dyscophinae and Microhylinae (fragmentation of India and Madagascar). G3: > 42 Ma, split of
Agalychnis and Litoria (fragmentation of Australia and
South America). G4: < 15 Ma, Blommersia wittei and B.
sp. âComoroâ (formation of Comoro Islands). G5: > 5
Ma, Alytes muletensis and A. dickhilleni (the Mediterranean salinity crisis). With the exception of F9, these calibration points were applied in Van Bocxlaer et al. [2]
and/or van der Meijden et al. [3]. The minimum ages of
F1 and F2 were adjusted from those used by van der
Meijden et al. (from 338 and 288 to 330 and 312,
respectively) based on more recent information [30].
Also to accommodate more recent information, the
minimum divergence times of F2 and F3 were changed
from the original values used by Van Bocxlaer et al.
(from 306.1 and 245.0 to 312 and 230, respectively).
Seven calibration points, (F1-F3, F8, and G1-G3) were
applied in calibrations A and D. The seven points (F1F3, G1, and G3-G5) previously used in van der Meijden
et al. [3], plus F9, were applied in calibration B. Six
points (F1-F3 and F7-F9) consisting of only fossil evidences were applied in calibration C. Nine points (F1-8
and G2) previously used in Van Bocxlaer et al. [2] were
applied in calibration E. Eight fossil points (F1-8) were
applied in calibration F.
The age calibrations were performed using software
packages PAML ver. 4 [31] and Multidivtime [32]. In all
calibrations, optimized branch lengths with their variance-covariance matrices of each alignment data were
estimated for each gene partition (i.e., multiple loci analysis) with an F84 + G model (similar to the best model
among available models in Multidivtime) using estbranches program. Parameters used in the model were
estimated by PAML. To estimate divergence times, Markov chains were conducted for 10 million cycles with

Page 11 of 12

one per 100 sampling frequency and 10% burn-in for all
six calibrations.
Four additional dating analyses (calibrations G-J) were
performed using two distinct tree topologies (= the
topologies of maximum likelihood trees from Aln-2 and
Aln-3 datasets; see Additional file 4). The procedures of
these calculations were much the same as the above but
3 million Markov chain cycles were conducted for these
additional calculations.
