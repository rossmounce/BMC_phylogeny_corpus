Abstract
Background: Flaviviruses include the mosquito-borne dengue, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever
and West Nile and the tick-borne encephalitis viruses. They are responsible for considerable
world-wide morbidity and mortality. Viral entry is mediated by a conserved fusion peptide
containing 16 amino acids located in domain II of the envelope protein E. Highly orchestrated
conformational changes initiated by exposure to acidic pH accompany the fusion process and are
important factors limiting amino acid changes in the fusion peptide that still permit fusion with host
cell membranes in both arthropod and vertebrate hosts. The cell-fusing related agents, growing
only in mosquitoes or insect cell lines, possess a different homologous peptide.
Results: Analysis of 46 named flaviviruses deposited in the Entrez Nucleotides database extended
the constancy in the canonical fusion peptide sequences of mosquito-borne, tick-borne and viruses
with no known vector to include more recently-sequenced viruses. The mosquito-borne signature
amino acid, G104, was also found in flaviviruses with no known vector and with the cell-fusion
related viruses. Despite the constancy in the canonical sequences in pathogenic flaviviruses,
mutations were surprisingly frequent with a 27% prevalence of nonsynonymous mutations in yellow
fever virus fusion peptide sequences, and 0 to 7.4% prevalence in the others. Six of seven yellow
fever patients whose virus had fusion peptide mutations died. In the cell-fusing related agents, not
enough sequences have been deposited to estimate reliably the prevalence of fusion peptide
mutations. However, the canonical sequences homologous to the fusion peptide and the pattern
of disulfide linkages in protein E differed significantly from the other flaviviruses.
Conclusion: The constancy of the canonical fusion peptide sequences in the arthropod-borne
flaviviruses contrasts with the high prevalence of mutations in most individual viruses. The
discrepancy may be the result of a survival advantage accompanying sequence diversity
(quasispecies) involving the fusion peptide. Limited clinical data with yellow fever virus suggest that
the presence of fusion peptide mutants is not associated with a decreased case fatality rate. The
cell-fusing related agents may have substantial differences from other flaviviruses in their
mechanism of viral entry into the host cell.

Background
Flaviviruses are in the family Flaviviridae and are usually
arthropod-borne. They are enveloped, single-stranded,
positive sense RNA viruses that contain about 11,000

nucleotides. Translation results in a polyprotein that is coand post-translationally modified to produce three structural (C, M and E) and seven non-structural proteins
(NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5). More

than 75 flaviviruses have been named. The most common
virulent flaviviruses are the mosquito-borne dengue (four
serotypes, DENV1–4), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), yellow
fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis
(SLEV) and the tick-borne encephalitis viruses. A proposed classification assigns the tick-borne encephalitis
viruses to three groups: mammalian tick-borne virus
(TBEV), seabird tick-borne virus and Kadam [1].
Particular concerns with flaviviruses are the increasing
number of dengue infections in which infection with a
second serotype greatly increases the chance of developing
dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome,
the continuing western spread of JEV from the Far East
across Asia, the persistence of YFV especially in Africa and
the introduction of WNV into the Western Hemisphere in
1999. In addition to vector-borne species, the genus Flavivirus includes viruses with vertebrate hosts but no known
vector (NKV).
The currently unclassified flavivirus cell-fusing related
viruses (CFRV) have been isolated only from mosquitoes
or insect cell lines and contain cell fusing agent virus
(CFAV) [2,3], Kamiti River virus (KRV) [4] and Culex flavivirus (CXFV) [5]. The first CFRV virus described, a CFAV,
had the property that on propagation in Aedes albopictus
cells, the predominant cytopathic effect was cell fusion, a
finding not necessarily found with other cell lines or with
other CFRV. The observation that in measles virus, loss of
cell fusing (giant cell formation) ability can be the result
of a single mutational event suggests that a similar relatively minor change in the flaviviral genome could change
the cell-fusing phenotype [6].
Protein E, glycosylated in most flaviviruses, enables receptor-mediated attachment of the virion to the host cell and
fusion with host cell membrane. It contains the principal
epitopes eliciting neutralizing antibodies. The surface of
the virion has 90 copies of the protein E dimer [7]. Solution of the crystal structure of the soluble portion of E
indicates that the protein can be divided into 3 domains,
I, II and III [8]. The crystallographic study reveals a "cd"
loop at the tip of the elongation domain, domain II. The
loop was interpreted to be the fusion peptide. In the
mature virion, part of the fusion peptide of one monomer
in the dimer pair is buried under the surface of domains I
and III in the adjacent monomer.
Previously, on the basis of conservation of amino acids
among flavivirus species, a high glycine content, molecular flexibility and chemical characteristics similar to
known fusion peptides, it had been suspected that amino
acids 98–120 of protein E mediated fusion [9]. Subsequent estimates of the fusion peptide included amino
acids 98–110 [10] and 99–116 [11]. The crystallographic

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/27

study demonstrates that the cd loop contained amino
acids 98–113 [8]. Functional assessments of only some of
the amino acids influencing fusion or growth have been
reported e.g. for amino acids 104 [12,13], 106 [13], and
107 [12-14]. In part because it is the start of a conserved
amino acid sequence and because of its participation in a
salt bridge with K110, the N-terminus of the fusion peptide is likely to be D98. The C-terminus has not been
defined functionally. Conservation of the dipeptide 112
SI 113 in all of the pathogenic flaviviruses except the four
dengue serotypes and the inclusion of those amino acids
in the cd loop suggest that they be included as the C-terminus. In the present study the fusion peptide was considered to be the 16 amino acids in the cd loop.
A canonical sequence is defined in the current report as a
sequence conserved in a variety of viruses as contrasted
with a wild-type sequence characterizing an individual
virus. According to this definition, 12 of the 16 amino
acids in the flavivirus fusion peptide comprise a canonical
sequence, 98 DRGWGNXCGXFGKGXX 113 (with X representing variable amino acids). In mosquito-borne flaviviruses, amino acid 104 is G and in tick-borne strains, 104
is H. With either vector, 107 is L, except in the tick-borne
Powassan (POWV) in which it is F.
Since it is located in the envelope protein in tight association with the adjacent monomer, the flavivirus fusion
peptide has been classified as mediating class II fusion
with host cell membranes [15]. As a consequence of viral
entry into a cell via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, the
virion becomes encased in an endosome. During maturation the endosome becomes acidic causing release of the
buried tip of the fusion peptide. The protein E monomer
now associates as a trimer and fusion with host cell membrane occurs, permitting transfer of the RNA genome into
the host cell cytoplasm. The requirement for extensive
conformational change in the fusion peptide coupled
with its high degree of conservation among the flaviviruses suggests that fusion peptide mutants would be rare.
The current report was initiated to investigate whether the
conservation of flavivirus fusion peptide was preserved in
the more recent isolates especially in strains not yet associated with disease, to evaluate diversities associated with
mutations in the wild-type sequences and to study the
homologous sequence in the CFRV.

sequence (Table 2) with the expected G104 or H104
depending on their vector. Only with Kadam, a tick-borne
virus for which a separate grouping has been proposed
[1], was there an amino acid (N) other than G or H at
codon 104. Both the NKV and the CFRV had the mosquito-borne signature amino acid. Indeed the entire
canonical virus sequence with the mosquito-borne signature was found in some NKV (Rio Bravo, Apoi [16] and
Montana myotis leukoencephalitis virus [17]). However,
other NKV, Modoc [18] and the more distantly related
Tamana bat virus [19], although maintaining the mosquito-borne signature, had altered fusion peptides.

Inter-virus variation: The cell-fusion related viruses
CFAV [2,3], KRV [4] and CXFV [5], together constituting
the CFRV, have been grown only in mosquitoes or insect
cell lines. As was noted in the original description of
CFAV, the sequence homologous to the fusion peptide
contains only 8 amino acids in common with the canonical flavivirus fusion peptide [2]. The present analysis
extended the identity of the homologous peptide to CXFV
but found that the KRV differed from the other CFRV in 3
fusion-peptide related amino acids (Table 2). Five of the
six conserved glycine residues were maintained in all
CFRV. The amino acid changes in the CFRV abolished
both ends of the salt bridge between amino acids 98 and
110. Another difference previously noted is that the CFAV
has 14 cysteines in protein E rather than 12 as in flaviviruses [2]. The current findings demonstrated that the 14
cysteines were conserved in all CFRV. One pair of
cysteines in domain I, four pairs in domain II (including
the fusion-peptide related pair) and one pair in domain
III were present in both the arthropod-borne flaviviruses
and the CFRV (Figure 1). However, the arthropod-borne
flaviviruses had two disulfide-linked cysteines at the
beginning of domain I. The CFRV lacked these conserved
cysteines, but had four additional conserved cysteines,
presumably linked by disulfide bonds, whose pairing has
not been determined. Accordingly, there are likely to be
distinct differences in the folding pattern of their protein
Es, possibly resulting in a changed cell-surface orientation.
Variation within viruses: Amino acid mutations in flavivirus

The average prevalence of mutations in pathogenic flaviviruses was 5.0% (Table 3). In YFV, 27% of the fusion-pep-

than YFV), a flavivirus associated in general with comparatively few amino acid changes either in nature or on laboratory passage [25,26]. No deviations from wild-type
sequences were found in flaviviruses other than those
listed in Table 1. Although only relatively few sequences
have been deposited, the lack of deviation from the wildtype sequences also included the CFRV in which the current analysis found 1 sequence for the original CFAV, 1 for
CFAV (Puerto Rico) and 8 for CXFV. All encoded the same
amino acid sequence. The 2 sequences deposited for KRV
were identical to each other. However, in many of the
other viruses listed in Table 2, only one sequence has been
deposited. Since the prevalence of mutations in the pathogenic flaviviruses averaged 5% (range 0 to 27%), an
appreciable percentage of sequences determined only
once may not be wild-type.

tide sequences contained mutations. In the other
arthropod-borne flaviviruses capable of causing disease in
humans, the percentage varied from 0 to 7.4. The relative
lack of mutations of YFV in amino acids 108–113 could
be related to the fact that 80% of the YFV sequences came
from one laboratory whose reverse primers do not permit
detection of mutants in the sequence FGKGSI, the six Cterminal acids of the fusion peptide [20-24]. On the other
extreme, although only 97 sequences have been deposited, no fusion peptide mutants have been found with

Fusion-peptide mutants in yellow fever virus
Comparison of the fusion peptide mutations in other flaviviruses with those reported with YFV revealed that in
YFV the predominant mutation was G100S (Figure 2). In
YFV 25/56 (45%) of the mutations were at the 100th
codon in E (all but one were G100S). In contrast only 1/
60 (1.7%) mutations in other pathogenic flaviviruses
occurred at codon 100 (p < 0.0001) (Figure 2). Investigators in the laboratory that had deposited 80% of the YFV
sequences including 46/47 of the mutant sequences were
concerned about the large number of YFV fusion-peptide
mutants [24]. They pointed out that at least some of the
mutations would result in profound alterations of the
structural integrity of the fusion peptide, namely abrogation either of the disulfide bond with mutation of C105 or
of the salt bridge between amino acids D98 and K110.
They determined the mouse LD50 in two mutants, the
most commonly encountered, G100S and one that abolished a disulfide bond by the mutation C105S. In both
instances there was a 106.5 reduction in mouse virulence
compared to the wild-type sequence. The decreased virulence for mice in the two isolates tested contrasts with the

present analysis of their data indicating that six of seven
(86%) of Brazilian patients whose virus had fusion peptide mutations died, including all three with the G100S
mutation. Since the usual case fatality rate with YFV infection is 20–50%, infection with a fusion-peptide mutated
strain did not seem to decrease the risk of a fatal outcome.
Because of the frequency of the G100S mutation in YFV, a
phylogenetic tree was developed, an abridged version of
which is shown (Figure 3). The tree demonstrates that the
mutation is widely distributed amongst most of the genotypes (predominantly South American but also three African isolates in two branches), a pattern consistent with a
selective advantage conferred by a G100S mutation and
either multiple independent mutations or extensive
recombination. While recombination appears to occur in
dengue, JEV and SLEV, it has not yet been observed with
YFV [27]. Thus multiple independent G100S mutations,
"convergent evolution", are the most likely explanation
for the dispersal of the G100S mutation throughout the
tree. Such dispersal is distinctly different from the pattern
for a nonsense mutation in DENV1 protein E in which
strains with the mutation at codon E248 were all part of
the same lineage, a finding most consistent with a unitary
origin of the mutation [28].

mosquito-borne sequence is shown. In tick-borne viruses G

instead of SI.

Discussion
The current study confirms the well-known conservation
in the canonical sequence of the fusion peptide amino
acids in pathogenic flaviviruses. In addition, it documents
the extent of the conservation and variation in more distantly related flaviviruses. Protein E contains 493–501
amino acids in the arthropod-borne flaviviruses and flaviviruses with no known vector. Only 18% of the amino
acids are completely conserved in pathogenic flaviviruses
[29]. Although the fusion peptide contains only 3.2% of
the amino acids in protein E, it contains 13% of the conserved amino acids in E (p < 0.00001), making it the most
conserved sequence in protein E and possibly in the entire
flavivirus genome. Twelve of the 16 fusion peptide amino
acids are completely conserved not only in pathogenic
strains, but also in many flaviviruses found in diverse
environments such as bats, rats and seabirds and in flaviviruses with no known vectors. Six of the conserved fusion
peptide amino acids are glycines (five in the tick-borne
viruses), mostly alternating with another amino acid.
Since glycine residues may permit rotation around their
C-C and C-N bonds, their presence is likely to facilitate the
conformational changes necessary for fusion, including
release of the tip of the fusion peptide from underneath
domains I and III at the start of fusion. The conservation
of fusion-peptide amino acids, in association with the
structural studies indicating highly-organized conformational changes accompanying fusion, suggests that there
are considerable constraints on evolutionary changes in
the fusion peptide, particularly when the virion must be
capable of fusing both with mammalian and arthropod
cells.
The sequences homologous to the fusion peptide in the
CFRV differ in 8 amino acids from the other flaviviruses.
In KRV the wild-type sequence (based on 2 determinations) was NRGWGTGCFEWGLGQV (the three amino
acids different from the other CFRV are in bold). The
canonical sequence in the other CFRV (based on 10
sequences) was NRGWGTGCFKWGIGFV. These differences from the fusion peptide sequences in the vast majority of flaviviruses, in combination with the differences in
the presumed disulfide binding patterns (as shown in
Results) suggest that the mechanism of CFRV virus entry
into the cell differs from the other flaviviruses.
Disparity between inter-flaviviral conservation and intraflaviviral variation of the fusion peptide
Given the considerable conservation in fusion peptide
within the otherwise variable E protein, the high prevalence of fusion-peptide mutants in a given flavivirus was
surprising. The findings with two flaviviruses are particularly relevant: YFV and DENV1.

Figure 3
Phylogenetic tree of yellow fever viruses with a G100S E protein mutation
Phylogenetic tree of yellow fever viruses with a G100S E protein mutation. The nearest neighbor-joining tree was
developed from sequences in the prM/E region (nucleotides 643–1308). Similar results were obtained using maximum parsimony. Selected strains with G100S mutations indicated by red circles were supplemented with strains with the wild-type
codon to indicate additional branching patterns.

In YFV, the high prevalence, 27%, of fusion peptide mutations is noteworthy (Table 3). Limited outcomes data in
humans, cited above, suggest that despite laboratory evidence of diminished virulence in two fusion-peptide
mutants, patients infected with the mutant strains have a
high mortality rate. Dual infection with both a fusionpeptide mutant and wild-type virus is a plausible explanation. Two possible mechanisms for production of two different viral genomes by the same cell should be
considered. The first is co-infection with two different
viruses [28]. The second is the possibility that the virion

contains two different viral genomes, as is regularly the
case with retroviruses. But why does YFV stand out as the
flavivirus with by far the largest prevalence of fusion peptide mutations? Most of the sequencing on YFV virus
material is done on specimens lyophilized for periods of
time up to several decades. Consequently the virus is
propagated prior to sequencing. The laboratory that
deposited 46/47 of the fusion peptide mutants passaged
virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1 (many of the
other laboratories did not state the moi in their methods
sections). Since this is a relatively high moi and passage

Page 6 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

Virology Journal 2008, 5:27

with high moi's may encourage the emergence of defective
virus, it is possible that the fusion peptide mutants
increased in frequency on serial passage. However, it
should be noted that the laboratory tried to minimize the
number of passages prior to sequencing. On the other
hand, it is also possible that if the other laboratories passaged the virus under conditions that selected against persistence of the mutants (such as passage at a low moi), the
sequences determined in the other laboratories may have
underestimated the prevalence of mutations.
In DENV1, 2.8% of the fusion peptide sequences contained amino acid changes (Table 3). Eleven of the 12
mutant sequences came from a laboratory that did direct
sequencing without prior cultivation [28]. Their evaluation of sequence heterogeneity revealed a nonsense codon
in the middle of E at codon 248 in 68/290 (23%) of their
sequences. They documented expression of a truncated
protein E. In some viral populations 11 of the 20
sequences cloned from the same specimen contained the
nonsense codon. Since the resulting truncated protein E
lacks the C-terminal amino acids necessary for attachment
to the viral envelope, none of the protein E and obviously
none of the fusion peptide can be attached to the envelope. The authors postulate that co-infection with fully
infective virus complements the defective virus. Persistence of the mutation for at least three years and its presence in specimens obtained more than a thousand miles
apart was documented. The prolonged persistence of the
mutation suggests that it confers a survival advantage to
the virus. Moreover, in addition to the mutation resulting
in a protein truncated at amino acid 247, analysis of the
sequences deposited in GenBank in connection with the
DENV1 article revealed at least two sequences with the following mutations: In the fusion peptide itself (N103D), a
nonsense mutation at codon 2 and a 72 nucleotide deletion that resulted in loss of the entire fusion peptide (SJS,
unpublished). These repetitive mutations occurred in the
same specimens ("virus population") supporting the
interpretation that they were the result of virus propagation and were not simply dead end mutations or the result
of sequencing errors. Accordingly, at least with DENV1,
sequence heterogeneity with rescue of defective virus by
complementation with fully infective virus is a plausible
explanation for the persistence of fusion peptide mutations.
Quasispecies and sequence heterogeneity
Several reports in addition to the above discussed DENV1
have quantified sequence heterogeneity in flaviviruses
including DENV2 [30], DENV3 [31-33] and WNV [34]
and a non-quantitative evaluation of nucleotide variations in YFV vaccines [35]. These findings support the possibility that transmission of virus occurs as a combination
of sequences and might, at least in part, explain the prev-

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/27

alence of the fusion peptide mutations. Sequence heterogeneity is found with many other RNA viruses and is
considered to result from both the lack of a proof-reading
mechanism in virus-encoded RNA polymerases and
extensive viral multiplication. The variations are usually
attributed to virus being transmitted as a quasispecies
[36]. The concept of quasispecies as formulated by Eigen
is that the virus is propagated not as a single genome, but
as a mixture of genomes with the result that there is no
single wild-type sequence. In evolutionary terms, survival
of the fittest becomes survival of the fittest quasispecies.
The bacteriophage Qβ fits the definition of a quasispecies
[37]. When cloned isolates are propagated, they revert to
a mixture. Analogous results have been obtained in laboratory experiments with TBEV in which mammalianadapted virus and tick-adapted virus can be purified from
isolated plaques that, on additional propagation in the
alternate cell type, revert to the other tropism [38].
Despite suggestions that the term quasispecies should be
restricted to situations in which specific criteria have been
demonstrated, it has become common practice to label
the mere presence of sequence variation in a given specimen as a quasispecies. Indeed the sole finding of different
virus sequences in the same geographic area has been considered sufficient [39]. However, questions have been
raised about the real world applicability of the quasispecies concept in finite populations [40,41]. Proponents of
the quasispecies concept believe that the questions have
been satisfactorily addressed [42]. But, as even the concept's proponents acknowledge, in instances in which the
population has not been sufficiently studied, it is preferable to call the virus population a swarm [43]. By whatever
name one calls the finding of sequence diversity, the presence of a variety of genomes transmitted during the course
of flavivirus propagation appears to be intimately
involved in the explanation for the high prevalence of
fusion peptide mutations in most of the pathogenic flaviviruses.
Questions raised by the current analysis
Is the seventh amino acid in the flavivirus fusion peptide,
G in the mosquito-borne viruses and H in the tick-borne
strains, both necessary and sufficient in determining the
arthropod vector? Evidence against the possibility is the
observation that mutant TBEV/DENV4 plasmid constructs
containing the genes for TBEV proteins M and E in a
DENV4 backbone did not yield viable virus with H104G
(i.e. replacing the signature tick-borne amino acid with
the mosquito one) [12], However, the double mutant
H104G, L107F grew. It may be relevant that the normally
tick-borne POWV, whose wild-type sequence contains
F107, has been isolated from mosquitoes [44]. It would
be interesting to determine the fusion peptide sequences

in mosquito isolates from normally tick-borne viruses
(and vice versa).
What are the implications of the fusion peptide differences between CFRV and the other flaviviruses? The
changes in eight of the 16 amino acids in CFRV in the
sequence homologous to the flavivirus fusion peptide
bring up the possibilities either that fusion differs substantially in these viruses or that there is another mechanism for the RNA genome to gain entry into the cell. Even
if it is assigned to a genus other than flavivirus, the Tamana bat virus fusion peptide sequence with six amino acid
changes raises similar questions. In contrast with the
CFRV that have no known vertebrate host, the Tamana bat
virus has no known vector. Although more isolates need
to be sequenced to establish the wild-type, Bussuquara
virus and Iguape virus with three and two amino acid
changes respectively may be additional candidates for
altered cell entry mechanisms. If there is a mechanism for
entry of the genome into the cell that does not require
fusion, then it might also be utilized by the fusion peptide
mutants.
Are there additional insights to be gained by analyzing
conserved amino acids in other parts of the viral genome?
One example is a conserved glycine in the region between
protein E domains I and III, G301 [29]. Could that glycine
be necessary for some of the conformational changes in
protein E that accompany fusion? What about flavivirus
complex-specific determinants? Can amino acids conserved in one flavivirus complex that differ from homologous amino acids conserved in another be helpful guides
in elucidating the peptides crucial for complex delineation?

Conclusion
The contrast between the extensive conservation of the flavivirus fusion peptide sequence between flaviviruses and
the high percentage of mutations prevalent in many of the
individual flaviviruses is notable. The first result suggests
that there are significant constraints on the permitted evolutionary changes in the fusion peptide consistent with
the maintenance of pathogenicity in flaviviruses and with
the ability to infect both arthropod and mammalian
hosts. The high prevalence of fusion peptide mutants is
best explained by the presence of dual infection either
through superinfection or by virions containing two RNA
copies. The limited clinical information on YFV outcomes
(a high fatality rate in a few yellow fever patients infected
with fusion peptide mutants) is consistent with the
hypothesis that, despite demonstration that cloned
mutants have diminished mouse virulence, dual infection
can result in particularly virulent disease. In fact the persistence of mutants with defective replicative ability (best
demonstrated by a nonsense codon in DENV1) suggests

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/27

that dual infection can confer a replicative advantage. The
marked change in the composition of the "fusion peptide" in the CFRV suggests that entry of the viral genome
into host cell cytoplasm differs from the other flaviviruses.

Methods
Mosquito-borne flavivirus nucleotide sequences that contained all of the nucleotides encoding the fusion peptide
amino acids were obtained from the NCBI website using
the CoreNucleotide option [45]. That site uses the Entrez
Nucleotides database, a collection of sequences from several sources, including GenBank. YFV sequences were
imported into Mega version 4 [46]. Neighbor-joining
phylogenetic trees with 1000 bootstrap iterations were
then generated with the Mega program. Similar trees were
obtained using maximum parsimony.
The search for fusion-peptide-containing flavivirus
sequences for specific arthropod-borne flaviviruses
known to be pathogenic was initiated by Blastp searches
using the wild-type sequences shown in Table 1 in conjunction with the virus name. Additional tick-borne flaviviruses were identified from a recent publication [1]. In
one instance a sequence inadvertently omitted from GenBank was supplied by the author. Mutant sequences were
identified starting with sequences with less than perfect
matches and ending when the peptides were part of proteins other than flavivirus protein E. Published sources of
the sequences were obtained from the sequence citations
or, if the citation listed the source as "unpublished", from
a search in the NCBI website with the PubMed option.
Additional flaviviruses were identified from a protein
search in the NCBI site using the search terms "flavivirus
no known vector". However, most of the viruses identified
by that search term were mosquito-borne [47]. Completeness of the search for fusion peptide sequences was substantiated by reviewing the listing in the article by Cook et
al of all available flaviviral sequences which might include
the fusion peptide (genome and polyprotein [[48], their
Table 2]. For CFRV the search terms were "cell fusing
agent", "Kamiti River virus" and "culex flavivirus".
Categorical variables were evaluated by a two sided
Fisher's exact test for p(O>=E|O<=E) [49].
