Abstract
Background: For decades cichlid fishes (Perciformes: Cichlidae) of the East African cichlid
radiations (Teleostei: Cichlidae) have served as natural experimental subjects for the study of
speciation processes and the search for potential speciation key factors. Despite numerous
phylogenetic studies dealing with their intragroup relationships, surprisingly little is known about
the phylogenetic placement and time of origin of this enigmatic group. We used multilocus DNAsequence data from five nuclear and four mitochondrial genes and refined divergence time
estimates to fill this knowledge gap.
Results: In concordance with previous studies, the root of the East African cichlid radiations is
nested within the so called "Tilapias", which is a paraphyletic assemblage. For the first time, we
clarified tilapiine intragroup relationships and established three new monophyletic
groups:"Oreochromini", "Boreotilapiini" and a group with a distribution center in East/Central
Africa, the "Austrotilapiini". The latter is the founder lineage of the East African radiations and
emerged at the Miocene/Oligocene boundary at about 14 to 26 mya.
Conclusion: Our results provide the first resolved hypothesis for the phylogenetic placement of
the megadiverse East African cichlid radiations as well as for the world's second most important
aquaculture species, the Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Our analyses constitute not only a robust
basis for African cichlid phylogenetics and systematics, but provide a valid and necessary framework
for upcoming comparative phylogenomic studies in evolutionary biology and aquaculture.

Background
African cichlid fishes (Perciformes: Cichlidae) constitute
the most species rich vertebrate model system in evolutionary biology and ecology (reviewed in [1,2]). The spectacular radiations of the East African rift valley Lakes

Malawi and Tanganyika, L. Victoria and surrounding
smaller lakes and rivers, are best known for their exceptional diversity and efficient habitat and resource exploitation. [2]. Numerous studies on different aspects of
speciation and the evolution of adaptive traits are based

on East African cichlids, e.g. [3-6]. Identification of key
factors [7] associated with the enormous evolutionary
success of these radiations might improve our general
understanding of speciation processes. For this a resolved
phylogenetic framework is crucial [7]. Nevertheless, the
closest relatives of the East African cichlid radiations
(EAR) are still unknown, confusing interpretations of evolutionary trends in this group. This lack of knowledge can
especially hinder comparative genomic studies and meta
analyses, e.g. [1,5], which must rely on poorly resolved or
poorly supported tree topologies. The monophyletic origin of African cichlids is supported by molecular and morphological analyses, as are five major monophyletic
sublineages (Tylochromines, Hemichromines, Chromidotilapiines, Pelmatochromines, Haplotilapiines). A sixth
lineage, the monotypic genus Heterochromis, is either
regarded as a distant outgroup or as the sistertaxon to all
remaining African cichlids [8-20]. It is further established
that (1) the EAR, including the Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis
niloticus), the world's second most important aquaculture
species [21], are placed within the so called "Haplotilapiines" [18], of which internal relationships remain largely
unresolved; and that (2) the root of the EAR is placed
somewhere within a large subgroup of cichlid fishes, the
so called "Tilapias" or "Tilapiines" [18,22]. Tilapiines are
a widespread paraphyletic species assemblage including a
few speciose and phenetically similar genera, i.e. Tilapia,
Oreochromis, and Sarotherodon, as well as several less speciose and in some cases monotypic genera such as Alcolapia,
Tristramella, Danakilia, Iranocichla, Steatocranus, Gobiocichla and Chilochromis [15,18,23]. Divergence time estimates for splits within the African cichlids are scarce and
sometimes contradictory depending on the source of data.
For example, fossil calibrated dating has resulted in much
younger age estimates than Gondwana separation based
dating (e.g. [24-26]). Reliable age estimates are not only
required to link phylogenetic divergence with the palaeogeographical background but also to appraise the speed of
evolutionary change associated with rapid speciation
events. Until now age estimates for the origin of the East
African radiations have been mainly based on geological
information, e.g. on lake ages, assuming that divergence
of endemic clades took place after the formation of lacustrine habitats [27,28]. Other estimates based on Gondwana fragmentation yield rather imprecise ages for
terminal nodes [24,25] varying between 22 and 62 mya
for the root of the EAR. The present study is designed to
fill the gap between the rapidly increasing knowledge of
various aspects shaping African cichlid evolution and the
lack of a reliable phylogenetic background and divergence
time estimates. In particular we intend to (i) establish a
robust phylogeny for the paraphyletic group of Tilapias,
(ii) identify the root of East African cichlid radiations, and
finally (iii) estimate the root age of the primary East African radiation.

Results
The concatenated dataset included 56 taxa each with 6176
bp DNA sequence data derived from four mitochondrial
and five nuclear loci (dataset A, additional file 1). Of
these, 394 bp were excluded from the analyses due to
alignment ambiguities in non-coding genes and saturation in the 3rd codon position of the mitochondrial ND2
locus, resulting in a final alignment of 5782 bp. A second
dataset (B) was composed of 301 taxa and 993 bp of ND2
(additional file 2). The 3rd codon position was not
excluded in this dataset, as taxon assignment to terminal
groups rather than basal resolution was the focus. Parameters were estimated separately for each codon position.
Dataset A had 1783 variable sites and empirical base frequencies of A = 0.269, C = 0.252, G = 0.228, T = 0.251.
Dataset B had 707 variable sites and empirical base frequencies of A = 0.262, C = 0.357, G = 0.118, T = 0.262.
The Bayes factor test [29] identified the HKY model as the
best fitting model for all partitions except for nuclear
exons (ENC1, Ptr, SH3PX3, Tmo4c4), which were
assigned to GTR + Γ. As expected, nuclear genes gave a better resolution in the more basal splits whereas mitochondrial genes provided increased resolution in terminal
groups. The leaf stability index revealed an unstable placement of Tilapia mariae (0.67 vs. 0.87 as next higher value)
whereas all other taxa were comparatively highly supported. Exclusion of this taxon from further analyses
increased the overall leaf stability index significantly (Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, N = 62, z = -6.164,
p < 0.001, leaf stability for all taxa > 0.90). Furthermore,
exclusion of the ambiguous T. mariae yielded a clear
increase of BPP and BS support values in affected clades.
This effect was not evident during consecutive exclusion
of all other taxa (Figure 1), thus T. mariae was excluded
from all further analyses. Nevertheless, the topology of
the remaining consensus trees in both ML and BI analyses
remained unaffected.
Phylogenetic relationships
Trees obtained from ML and BI analyses were highly congruent and nodes were supported for all major clades.
Both approaches corroborated the monophyly of the
Haplotilapiini (100/1.00) whereas sister group relationship of this group within the African cichlids gained low
BS and BPP values (45/0.74, Figure 2). Within the "Haplotilapiini the following topology was highly supported
(BS and BPP = 99): (a) Etia nguti was sister group to all
other Haplotilapiines. (b) The mouthbrooding genera
Oreochromis, Sarotherodon, Iranocichla and Tristramella
formed a monophyletic group, hereafter named "Oreochromini", after the most species rich genus within this
group Oreochromis. The Oreochromini were sister to the
substrate-brooders (clades BI, BII, AII and AIII) as well as
to clade AI, comprising substrate and mouthbrooding representatives of the East African radiations (Figure 2). (c) A

hardly detectable (additional file 5). No conflicting signal
was detectable in 2000 randomly chosen BI topologies.

clade comprising clade AI (100/1.00), Tilapia sensu stricto
(AII, 98/1.00), and Steatocranus from the Congo Basin
(AIII, 100/1.00) formed the sister group to remaining
Haplotilapiines distributed mainly in the East/Central/
Southern part of Africa. In recognition of its distribution,
this group is called "Austrotilapiini", in contrast to the
"Boreotilapiini" with a predominantly West/Central African distribution (Figure 2). Within the Boreotilapiini, a
clade consisting of Gobiocichla wonderi, Tilapia brevimanus,
Tilapia busumana and "Steatocranus" irvinei (BI, 100/1.00)
and a clade comprising the Tilapia (Coptodon) subgenus
(sensu [30]) as well as T. joka and T. buttikoferi (BII, 100/
1.00, Figure 2) appeared monophyletic and emerged as
well supported sister groups (96/1.00). Within the Austrotilapiini sister group relationships were consistent and
moderately well supported (86/1.00 and 87/1.00 respectively). All major clades were confirmed as monophyletic
in a larger phylogenetic framework based on ND2 (additional file 3).
The phylogenetic placement of the East African radiations
Clade AI, comprising the EAR, appeared as sister group to
the remaining Austrotilapiini (Figure 2). The mitochondrial dataset supported a sister group relationship
between AI and the Congolian genus Steatocranus (AIII),
though with low support values (63/0.80), whereas the
nuclear dataset in accordance with the concatenated dataset, favored the above mentioned relationship ((69/0.95)
and (87/1.00) respectively). Discordant phylogenetic signal was evident in 6% and 7% of the bootstrap replicates,
favoring either a placement as sister to monophyletic
Boreotilapiini and Austrotilapiini (6%) or a sister group
relationship to Boreotilapiini alone (7%). All remaining
hypotheses were supported with less than 1% (additional
file 4). The 6% signal was only detectable in the nuclear
non-coding intron S7: without this marker the signal was

Divergence time estimates
Divergence time estimates yielded broadly consistent
results (Table 1). Preliminary analyses indicated a
younger age for node A (Figure 3) than represented by
prior A2 (71–89 mya, Gondwana calibration from [24])
and the age estimates for most recent ancestor of Oreochromis (Node O2, Figure 3) were younger (minimum age
4.18 mya, Table 1) than the age of the Oreochromis lorenzoi† fossil [31]. Thus, final analyses were performed using
priors O1 (lower bound 5.98 mya at the base of all Oreochromini, Figure 3) and A1 (53–84 mya, teleost fossil calibration from Azuma et al. [24]). The mean standard
deviation width of the 95% highest posterior density
(HPD) was 12.07–5.32 mya and the precision of the estimate was highly correlated with node age (Pearson correlation, p < 0.001, r = 0.703, N = 21), pointing to more
precise younger ages. The age of the most recent common
ancestor of the Haplotilapiini was estimated at about 37
(28–46) mya (Figure 3, node C). Mean ages for the three
major clades within the Haplotilapiini were estimated at
about 25 (19–32) mya for both Austrotilapiini and Boreotilapiini (nodes F and G) and 13 (9–17) mya for the constrained Oreochromini (node O1, Figure 3). The age for
the East African radiations, including the ancient lineages
Bathybatini and Boulengerochromis was estimated at 20
(14–26) mya (node K) and the subclade comprising the
H-lineage and "Lamprologini" was estimated to have
emerged at 15 (11–20) mya (node P). In a second analysis
Gondwana estimates, following [24], were included for
calibration point A (A3: 53–89 mya, Table 1). Results were
highly congruent with the first run using fossil calibrations even though confidence intervals increased. The
alternative algorithm based on penalized likelihood
revealed highly congruent results with those obtained by
the Bayesian approach (Table 1).

Discussion
With this well-supported phylogeny and consistent divergence time estimates for the ancestors of the most diverse
group of African cichlids a stable foundation is laid for
further studies on this prime model system in evolutionary biology. Our results clearly show that the genus Tilapia
is paraphyletic, and that previously proposed tilapiine
subgenera, summarized in [32], need revision. As this is
beyond the scope of the present study, we propose in
accordance with good practice in cichlid taxonomy to use
the genus name Tilapia Smith, 1840 only for Tilapia sensu
stricto, i. e. the small ingroup of southeastern species containing the type species Tilapia sparrmanii, along with T.
ruweti, T. baloni, and T. guinasana. Pending a thorough
revision all other members should be referred to as "Tila-

pia" (in quotation marks). The informal designation of
identified clades Etiini, Oreochromini, Austrotilapiini
and Boreotilapiiini will facilitate discussion of haplotilapiine monophlyetic groups in the absence of a full taxonomic revision and renders the previously used term
"Tilapiini" meaningless in the phylogenetic context. A list

Phylogenetic relationships of African cichlids
Resolving relationships of African cichlids has always
been challenging. While phylogenetic relationships
between and within the African Great Lake radiations
[1,2] and riverine Haplochromines [27,33,34] are comparatively well understood, little was known about the
broader phylogenetic framework for the most speciose
group of cichlids [1,22]. Most often the so called Tilapiines were discussed as precursors of the East African cichlid radiations [1,22]. Several morphological studies
classified different tilapiine genera into various numbers
of subgenera largely based on overall similarity of character states rather than on unambiguous apomorphies
[23,32]. However, the diversity of this heterogeneous
group was comparatively poorly represented in molecular

phylogenetic studies [8], but see [15,17,35]. A recent work
based on the mitochondrial ND2 marker [15] accentuated
the paraphyletic origin of the genera Tilapia and Sarotherodon, but did not recover well-supported deeper phylogenetic relationships. We present the first largely resolved
phylogeny of African cichlids with emphasis on tilapiine
cichlids including 47 ingroup and 7 outgroup species
(Figure 2). Phylogenetic analyses revealed congruent and
largely well-resolved topologies supporting a monophyletic origin of the Haplotilapiini, comprised of all
tilapiine cichlids as well as the East African radiations.
Relationships of Haplotilapiines to basal African cichlid
tribes were only weakly supported, possibly due to high
genetic distances compounding homoplastic signal
amongst the most ancient nodes. In accordance to previous results the sister group to all remaining Haplotilapiines was the monotypic taxon Etia nguti from the Cross
River in Cameroon [18]. Earliest divergence within the
Haplotilapiini separates the mouthbrooding, almost panAfrican Oreochromini from predominantly substrate
brooding tilapiines and the EAR. The latter formed two
monophyletic clades with largely non-overlapping distribution, one with a center in West/Central Africa (Boreotilapiini), and one in East/Central Africa (Austrotilapiini,
Figure 2). Remarkably a comparable distribution pattern
is evident in cyprinodont killifish [36,37], explained by a
marine incursion in the late Palaeocene at about 92-52

mya [38,39] separating West Africa from the East and
Central part. However, estimates for the Haplotilapiine
clades are substantially younger, with 28 (21–35) mya
(Figure 3, node E) for the separation of Boreo- and Austrotilapiini and a subsequent diversification at 25 (19–32)
mya (Nodes F and G). This even holds true without a fossil prior (Table 1). The estimated ages are concordant with
the East African aridification at 33-20 mya [40,41], which
influenced distribution patterns of the African fauna and
flora, i.e. rainforest trees [42] and caecilian amphibians
[40]. However, the influence of the drought on freshwater
systems possibly inhabited by the ancestors of the Austroand Boreotilapiini is not known at this time, leaving room
for speculation about the evolution of this distribution
pattern. The position of Tilapia mariae remained ambiguous in our analyses, which is reflected by a low leaf stability index. The predominant phylogenetic signal resulted
in its placement as sistertaxon to Boreotilapiines, but
depending on the algorithm used, it was also sometimes
resolved as sister to Austrotilapiines (additional file 4). A
possible explanation for this could be an ancient hybrid
origin of T. mariae, causing discordant phylogenetic signals in our dataset. Indeed, the distribution of the clade
represented by T. mariae and its sistertaxon T. cabrae is
intermediate between Austrotilapiines and Boreotilapiines (Figure 2). A more detailed analysis is necessary to
elucidate this pattern.
The origin of the East African radiation
The root of the East African radiations (EAR) within the
substrate brooding tilapiine cichlids (Figure 2) is corroborated with high support values. These results are consistent with earlier analyses based on limited taxon sampling
or fewer loci, e.g. [8,22], obtaining a closer sister group
relationship of Tilapia/Steatocranus to the EAR than the
mouthbrooding Oreochromini. Whereas the Steatocranus
radiation of the Congo Basin forms a monophyletic clade,
the genus Tilapia is clearly paraphyletic [15]. Tilapia taxa
included in the study of Terai et al. [22] have affinities
with the more distantly related Boreotilapiini in our analyses. A closer phylogenetic relationship of the EAR to the
(Austrotilapiini), comprising the Congolese Steatocranus
and a clade composed of Tilapia s.str., T. bilineata and Chilochromis, is corroborated (Figure 2). Biogeographically
this is plausible, because Austrotilapiini and the EAR
largely overlap in their distribution around the East African Lakes. In this area, the only representative of the Boreotilapiini present is T. (Coptodon) rendalli. The divergence
of the EAR clade was estimated at 20 (14–26) mya (Figure
3, Node K) including the ancient lineages and at 15 (11–
20) mya (Figure 3, node P) for the more derived lacustrine
and riverine radiations. Though only slightly overlapping,
the latter age estimate would be congruent with an origin
of the derived lineages in an emerging Lake Tanganyika,
estimated at 9–12 mya [43]. Alternative age estimates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/186

using Gondwana fragmentation calibrations or an alternative dating algorithm (penalized likelihood) point to
an older age for this node at 20 (13–28) mya and 14 mya,
respectively (Table 1). These estimates favor the alternative hypothesis of an origin of derived lineages prior to the
formation of Lake Tanganyika, in surrounding rivers or
peripheral palaeolakes and subsequent independent colonization [25]. Possibly, an increased taxon sampling with
a multi-locus dataset would render more precise age estimates and remove this remaining uncertainty.

Conclusion
Here, we provide the first reliable phylogenetic placement
of one of the most important model organisms in evolutionary biology, the East African cichlids. We show that
they are sister group to geographically proximate tilapiine
cichlids with a main distribution center in East/Central
Africa and that the whole group emerged in the late Oligocene/early Miocene. The dataset provided here constitutes not only a stable basis for critical testing of
divergence dates for basal EAR lineages from their tilapiine precursors [44] but also a critical template for future
phylogenomic and comparative studies based on African
cichlids.

Methods
Samples and Sequences
A total of 63 specimens of 54 species were included, representing all major groups of African cichlids, focusing on
Haplotilapiines sensu Schliewen & Stiassny [18]. To serve
as nested outgroups, members of all basal African lineages
(Tylochromini, Chromidotilapiini, Pelmatochromini,
Hemichromini) were added. As several recent molecular
and morphological studies support the basal position of
Heterochromis multidens with respect to the rest of the African cichlid radiation [10,16,45], this taxon served as outgroup. Total genomic DNA was isolated from fin clips or
muscle tissue using the Qiagen Tissue Extraction Kit
(DNeasy Tissue Extraction Kit) following the manufacturer's protocol. The following mitochondrial markers
were amplified and sequenced: partial mitochondrial 12S
and 16S genes and the intervening sequence between
them, and ND2. Additionally, four nuclear protein coding
genes (ENC1, Ptr, SH3PX3 and Tmo4c4) and the first
intron of the ribosomal protein coding gene S7 were
amplified and sequenced. The programs BioEdit (ClustalW) and MUSCLE v.3.6 were used for sequence alignment, followed by a control for ambiguous alignment
positions using ALISCORE v.0.2 under default settings
[46]. ALISCORE checks for random sequence similarity
using MCMC and a sliding windows approach. Under this
regime, similarity profiles based on pairwise comparisons
of sequences were calculated. Ambiguous positions were
summarized in a consensus profile along the alignment
[46] and subsequently removed from all analyses.

Coding genes were translated into amino acid sequences
to check for stop-codons or frame shifts and datasets were
checked separately for saturation at each codon position.
Base frequencies were equal for all markers (Chi-square
tests, df = 183, all p > 0.9). The combined dataset of all
sequenced markers resulted in a data matrix of 6176 total
bp comprised of 12SrRNA: 349 bp, 16SrRNA:543 bp, 12S/
16S:1245 bp, ND2: 1014 bp, ENC1: 725 bp, Ptr: 691 bp,
SH3PX3: 681 bp, Tmo4c4: 425 bp and S7 (first intron):
503 bp. In addition, a second dataset of 263 ND2
sequences (900 bp) retrieved from Genbank and 38 newly
sequenced ND2 sequences was generated (additional file
2), resulting in high coverage over all major African cichlid tribes, some of which are not present in data set A.
ND2 was chosen because this marker was available on
GenBank for a representative sampling of African cichlids.
The third codon position was saturated between in- and
outgroups in dataset B, but because the focus of this analysis was the identification of terminal clades (younger
splits), third positions were not excluded. Data were partitioned according to 1st, 2nd and 3rd codon position and
all parameters were estimated separately. A ML phylogeny
was constructed with RAXML v.7.0.3 using the rapid hill
climbing bootstrap algorithm with 1000 replicates and
following ML search. Branches not supported by 50%
bootstrap values were collapsed.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML)
approaches were used for phylogenetic inferences. The
combined dataset was partitioned according to coding vs.
non-coding and mitochondrial vs. nuclear genes yielding
four partitions, i.e. two partitions for mitochondrial genes
(rRNA and 1st and 2nd codon position of ND2) and two
for nuclear genes (Exons and Intron). The third codonposition of ND2 was excluded from phylogenetic analyses
(dataset A), as previous tests showed saturation between
Haplotilapiine and basal taxa (data not shown). For each
partition model parameters were estimated separately. For
BI, best fitting models of sequence evolution were estimated using the Bayes Factor Test [29]. Bayesian analyses
were performed using MrBayes v.3.1.2 [47] with eight parallel runs each over 106 generations starting with random
trees and sampling of trees every 1000 generations. To
ensure convergence the first 105 generations of each run
were treated as burn-in and excluded. The remaining trees
from all Bayesian analyses were used to build a 50%
majority rule consensus tree. The GTR + 3 model, implemented in the program RAxML v.7.0.3 [48] was used for
Maximum Likelihood analyses. Branch support was evaluated for the best scoring ML tree using non-parametric
bootstrapping (BS) consisting of 1000 pseudoreplicates
(using RAxML) and Bayesian posterior probabilities
(BPP).

Testing alternative phylogenetic hypotheses
To test for unreliably placed taxa the leaf stability index
[49] was calculated for all taxa based on 1000 bootstrap
trees using the program Phyutility v.2.2. [50]. This index
is a good measure of the consistency of a taxon's position
relative to other taxa across bootstrap replicates. Using the
same program, branch attachment frequencies were calculated for clades with low support values (BS < 90) using
1000 bootstrap trees and the ML topology as well as the
first 2000 BI topologies (after burn-in) and the BI topology. Following Seehausen [51], we applied a tree-based
method to test for excess homoplasy in our dataset, possibly introduced by taxa of ancient hybrid origin. The inclusion of a hybrid taxon would be expected to increase
internal conflict in the tree and diminish support values
for affected nodes owing the reticulate nature of the process [51]. To test for this possibility, each taxon was successively removed from the dataset (N = 63 experiments) and
subsequently a likelihood run (using RAxML) under the
GTR + 3 model with 1000 rapid bootstrap replicates was
conducted for each resulting dataset. The resulting trees
and bootstrap support values for the focus clades were
checked manually.
Divergence time estimates
Date estimates were calibrated using two age constraints.
One calibration point (O) was based on the fossil record
of Oreochromis lorenzoi† [31] from the Early Miocene of
the Baid Formation (5.98 mya, [52]). The second calibration point, assigned to the split between Tylochromis and
the remaining African cichlids (except Heterochromis multidens), corresponds to the 95% credible interval estimates
for African Cichlidae from Azuma et al. [24], (exact dates
were kindly provided by Y. Kumazawa and Y. Azuma,
pers. comm.). Estimates based on both non-cichlid teleostean fossils (A1 53–84 mya) and Gondwana fragmentation (A2 71–89 mya) were taken. An exponential prior
using a zero offset of 5.58 mya (marking the minimum
age) with a mean of 1 was used for the fossil calibration
point and a uniform prior with upper and lower bounds
either from 53 to 84 mya (A1), 71 to 89 mya (A2) or a
combination of both with 53 to 89 mya (A3) [24] were
fixed prior to analyses. As the distinction between Oreochromis and Sarotherodon is based on characters that are
often not preserved in fossils [23], at least two possible
placements for the Oreochromis lorenzoi† fossil in the phylogenetic framework exist. Most conservative is a placement at the base of all mouthbrooding Tilapiines (O1) or,
less so is a placement at the base of the genus Oreochromis
(point O2). Oreochromis lorenzoi† [31] is in our point of
view one of the few reliable cichlid fossils suitable for calibration, as the type specimens are in a well preserved
state and all key traits necessary for identification are recognizable. Its phylogenetic placement within the African

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:186

cichlid phylogeny is less ambiguous than for other fossils,
as the Oreochromini are a clearly monophyletic group
(Figure 2). Unfortunately this is not the case for most
other African cichlid fossils, which often lack diagnostic
characters necessary for a precise assignment to cichlid
tribes (for a more detailed discussion see additional file
7). Divergence time analyses were conducted using a lognormal distributed relaxed molecular clock MCMC
approach [53] as implemented in BEAST v.1.4.8 [54]. For
all calculations data were partitioned as described earlier
and the BI topology was used as starting tree. Separate
substitution models were used for each partition based on
the results of the Bayes Factor test. A pure birth model
(Yule) was assigned as prior for the branching process and
two independent and identical runs were conducted for
each BEAST setup for 306 generations. Convergence of
parameters was checked using Tracer v.1.4 [55]. The first
10% of generations were discarded as burn-in and the
effective sample size (ESS) was checked for good mixing
of the MCMC. All exceeded 200 for all model parameters.
Divergence dates were also estimated using penalized likelihood [56] as implemented in the program r8s v.7.1 [57].
The optimal smoothing parameter was 63 for each run
determined by a cross-validation approach [56]. All runs
were conducted several times with different sets of constraints to evaluate the influence of different calibration
points. As expected inclusion of the fossil calibration
point produced slightly younger but also narrower confidence intervals for all ages (additional file 8 and Table 1).
Two alternative placements of Oreochromis lorenzoi†
within the topology resulted in slightly different age estimates, with younger ages when the calibration point was
set at the root of all Oreochromini. Using the penalized
likelihood approach no difference in age estimates was
observed for different placements of Oreochromis lorenzoi†. Overall, age estimates largely overlap independent of
the priors used (additional file 8).

support values are given only for those clades. All focus clades (well supported clades from dataset A) were recovered as monophyletic in this tree,
despite lower data density and higher taxon sampling. One sequence of
Tilapia discolor taken from GenBank is nested within T. busumana in
clade BI instead of being sister to our conspecific and positively identified
T. discolor. As no vouchers are available for this tissue, we assume that
this discrepancy is a result of either misidentification or mitochondrial
introgression of sympatric T. busumana is the reason for this discrepancy.

Prior influence on divergence time estimates. The effects of different age
constraints on the estimation of divergence times using BEAST. Bars indicate age ranges (95% credibility intervals) of different BEAST runs using
either one single prior on the root (A3: 53–89 mya, based on published
time intervals from [24]) or two priors, including the Oreochromis
lorenzoi fossil (lower bound 5.98 mya) at two possible positions (O1 and
O2) in the phylogeny (Figure 2). Using solely the root prior increases credibility intervals and renders the whole age estimation older. Inclusion of
the fossil prior shifts intervals to a younger age. Large overlaps in estimates
unite all three results and increase the plausibility of the presented results.
Alternative positions of the Oreochromis lorenzoi† prior had no effect
in age estimates using penalized likelihood (r8s).
