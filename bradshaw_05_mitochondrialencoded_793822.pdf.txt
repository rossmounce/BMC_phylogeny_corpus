Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic organisms contain mitochondria, organelles capable of producing large
amounts of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Each cell contains many mitochondria with many
copies of mitochondrial DNA in each organelle. The mitochondrial DNA encodes a small but
functionally critical portion of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, a few other speciesspecific proteins, and the rRNA and tRNA used for the translation of these transcripts. Because
the microenvironment of the mitochondrion is unique, mitochondrial genes may be subject to
different selectional pressures than those affecting nuclear genes.
Results: From an analysis of the mitochondrial genomes of a wide range of eukaryotic species we
show that there are three simple rules for the pyrimidine and purine abundances in mitochondrial
DNA transcripts. Mitochondrial membrane protein transcripts are pyrimidine rich, rRNA
transcripts are purine-rich and the soluble protein transcripts are purine-rich. The transitions
between pyrimidine and purine-rich regions of the genomes are rapid and are easily visible on a
pyrimidine-purine walk graph. These rules are followed, with few exceptions, independent of which
strand encodes the gene. Despite the robustness of these rules across a diverse set of species, the
magnitude of the differences between the pyrimidine and purine content is fairly small. Typically,
the mitochondrial membrane protein transcripts have a pyrimidine richness of 56%, the rRNA
transcripts are 55% purine, and the soluble protein transcripts are only 53% purine.
Conclusion: The pyrimidine richness of mitochondrial-encoded membrane protein transcripts is
partly driven by U nucleotides in the second codon position in all species, which yields hydrophobic
amino acids. The purine-richness of soluble protein transcripts is mainly driven by A nucleotides in
the first codon position. The purine-richness of rRNA is also due to an abundance of A nucleotides.
Possible mechanisms as to how these trends are maintained in mtDNA genomes of such diverse
ancestry, size and variability of A-T richness are discussed.

Background
Mitochondria are the descendents of an early bacterium
that developed a symbiotic relationship with another cell

approximately 1.5 billion years ago [1]. Although the
mitochondria still contain DNA, the mitochondrial
genome has greatly simplified over its long history of

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:136

symbiosis. Naturally, this simplification in the mitochondrial genome has taken different routes as life diverged
into different kingdoms. Vertebrate mitochondrial
genomes are among the most compact, gene-rich
genomes, while some plant mitochondria have evolved to
have a low percentage of coding region similar to that of
nuclear DNA [2]. Features of the mitochondrial genomes
that have persisted through the divergent evolution of
eukaryotic life are likely to be due to fundamental limitations on the variation of that genome. In this paper we
discuss three such features that are preserved across
eukaryotic species.
Because of the relatively small size of mitochondrial DNA,
it is ideally suited for analysis by n-dimensional DNA
walks. One dimensional pyrimidine-purine walks were
first used to find long-range correlations in nucleotide
sequences [3]. Recently multi-fractal walks of mitochondrial DNA were used to find a nonlinear organization in
the mitochondrial genome [4]. Combining this information with pyrimidine-purine walks and walks of G-C versus A-T content [5] gives a better understanding of the
nucleotide organization of the genome.
Using these techniques we demonstrate certain features of
mtDNA sequences which have been preserved by evolution. Greater understanding of the evolutionary selection
pressures on mtDNA will allow the construction of more
accurate phylogenetic trees based upon mtDNA gene
sequences [6,7] as well as a better grasp of the root causes
of mitochondrial DNA mutations responsible for many
human diseases.

Results
A pyrimidine (C and T) – purine (A and G) walk of the (+)
strand of human mtDNA (commonly called the "light"
strand in vertebrates) is shown in Figure 1. For each pyrimidine in the sequence a step up is taken and for each
purine a step down is taken. In vertebrates, all mitochondrial genes except ND6 and many tRNAs are encoded on
the heavy strand. Therefore the mRNA species are predominantly (+) light strand synonymous. The first 3-kilobase section of the human mtDNA encodes two
ribosomal RNAs and the pyrimidine-purine walk slopes
downward in this region, indicating that the ribosomal
RNAs are slightly purine-rich. The remainder of the
genome predominately encodes mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation proteins with small tRNAs interspersed
between them. Each mitochondrial protein transcript
(except ND6) is pyrimidine-rich giving the remainder of
the graph an upward slope. Within this overall rise, small
almost flat sections where tRNA genes are located can be
seen between the protein coding regions. A particularly
large group of these tRNAs is contained in the section of
mtDNA around the origin of light strand replication (OL)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/136

(shown as an inset to Figure 1). The OL is dramatically
clear in this plot as a large run of pyrimidines on one side
of the OL followed by a long run of purines on the other
side. This section is thought to form a stem-loop structure
as an initiation event for light strand DNA synthesis [8,9].
However, we should note that a stem-loop structure does
not require a dramatic separation of pyrimidines and
purines as is seen here. The ND6 gene has a slightly
upward slope in the walk indicating that the human ND6
mRNA is slightly purine-rich in contrast to the other protein-coding mRNAs encoded on the opposite strand.
Clear pyrimidine and purine rich genome segments can
also be seen in the mtDNA from other eukaryotic species.
The pyrimidine-purine walks of the mitochondrial
genome of seven diverse species are shown in Figure 2. In
these species many of the genes, the gene order, and the
gene distribution over the two DNA strands are different.
Figure 2A shows a pyrimidine-purine walk of the mitochondrial genome of the red algae Chondrus crispus (Irish
Moss). The genes are color-coded based upon whether
they encode membrane proteins, soluble proteins, or
rRNA and upon the strand in which they are encoded. Figure 2B shows a mitochondrial genome walk of the red
algae, Porphyra purpurea. The similar gene order in these
two red algae species (Figures 2A and 2B) gives the walks
a similar overall shape. Metazoan mitochondrial genomes
such as those shown from Drosophila (Figure 2C) and sea
urchin (Figure 2D) are pyrimidine rich overall (+ strands),
especially in the sea urchin where all but one of the genes
are encoded on the same strand. Plant, fungal, and protist
genomes that are gene-poor, which encode oxidative
phosphorylation proteins on both strands, and also
encode soluble proteins are generally purine-rich. Small
genomes (<25 kB), such as that of Schizosaccharomyces
pombe (fission yeast) (Figure 2E), are pyrimidine-rich
because they are gene-rich and encoded entirely on one
strand.
No matter which strand encodes the genes, or whether the
entire mitochondrial genome is pyrimidine or purinerich, there are highly conserved features in these walks.
Places in the genome where the DNA walk went down
were locations where rRNA or soluble proteins were
encoded on the (-) (heavy) strand or where membrane
proteins were encoded on the (+) (light) strand. Locations
of membrane proteins on the (-) strand or rRNA or soluble proteins on the (+) strand were associated with an
upward slope in the pyrimidine-purine walk. Exceptions
to these rules are indicated on the figure with an asterisk.
The most notable exception that we found was the
mtDNA from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum
(Figure 2G), which has a very strand-asymmetric genome,
being very purine-rich on the (+) strand (60%). Unlike
other species, in Dictyostelium almost all oxidative-phos-

strand were purine-rich, just like the rest of its genome. To
place the extreme purine richness of Dictyostelium in context, the human mtDNA genome (+) strand is 44 % purine
while that of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana is 50 % purine.
The purine abundance of the mitochondrial genome of
other species is listed in additional file 1: Table S1. Slime

the 23 organisms we examined, while mammals, birds,
and a green algae species, Pedinomonas minor, contain the
least amount of purine (44%).

encode genes for many ribosomal proteins and a few
other soluble proteins. From this data we defined the following three rules that apply to the pyrimidine-purine
richness of mitochondrial transcripts.
Rule 1) Oxidative phosphorylation complex and other
membrane protein transcripts are pyrimidine-rich.
Rule 2) Ribosomal RNA is purine-rich.
Rule 3) Soluble protein transcripts are purine-rich.

We analyzed the pyrimidine and purine content of mitochondrial transcripts from many diverse eukaryotic species (Table 1). Unlike vertebrate mtDNA that lacks genes

few exceptions to these rules. In some mammals (though
not all) the ND6 transcript does not follow rule #1. The
main exception for rule #2 is the large ribosomal RNA
subunit in C. elegans, which has almost equal numbers of
purines and pyrimidines. In other non-animal species the
short 5S rRNA sometimes contains more pyrimidines
than purines.
We examined the mtDNA from 8 species that encode
genes for both soluble and membrane proteins. In Figure
3A we plot the percent pyrimidine in the transcripts versus
the frequency at which transcripts of that type (soluble
proteins, membrane proteins, or rRNA) occur in the 8 species. The membrane protein transcripts had a distinctive
distribution with a peak at around 56 % pyrimidine. The
ribosomal RNA and soluble protein transcripts had overlapping distributions with peaks near 45 % and 47 % pyrimidine respectively. These data explain the signals
obtained in the pyrimidine-purine walks. It also gives an

explanation as to why the soluble protein transcript walks
are more variable than the membrane protein transcript
walks, since the purine-rich signal is weaker in soluble
protein transcripts than is the pyrimidine-rich signal in
the membrane protein transcripts. The relative pyrimidine
percentage at each codon position in membrane and soluble protein transcripts is shown in Figures 3B and 3C will
be discussed later.
To clearly illustrate the relationship between protein
hydrophobicity and the pyrimidine content of the genes,
we plot in Figure 4 the percent pyrimidine in the protein
transcript versus the grand average of hydropathicity
(GRAVY) of the protein for four species with numerous
mitochondrial-encoded soluble and membrane protein
genes. A higher GRAVY score indicates a higher hydrophobicity of the protein. There was a strong correlation (P <
0.001) between the percent pyrimidine and the hydrophobicity of the encoded protein. This correlation has

for entire mitochondrial protein transcripts, whether the

proteins are soluble or membrane-bound. At high GRAVY
scores there is a consistent excursion of membrane proteins from the correlation line. Also, the membrane proteins having low GRAVY scores and low pyrimidine
content in the transcripts are likely peripheral membrane
proteins. Interestingly, the strong correlation in Figure 4
also holds for Dictyostelium where almost all mitochondrial transcripts are purine-rich.
It has been noted that the hydrophobicity of a protein is
related to the pyrimidine content of position 2 in the
codons of the gene [11,12]. If this is the cause of the pattern that we see in the mitochondrial protein genes, then

by splitting the DNA walk into three separate walks, one
for each codon position, we would expect that the walk
using codon position 2 would be responsible for the
signal, while the walks for codon positions 1 and 3 might
be random. Fig. 5 shows a pyrimidine-purine walk of each
codon position of the human COX1 membrane protein
transcript and the Chondrus crispus S12 soluble ribosomal
protein transcript. For comparison, the pyrimidine-purine
walk of the human 16S ribosomal RNA is also shown. The
base composition of mitochondrial genome sections
encoding rRNA and tRNA from other species is given in
additional file 1: Table S1. These walks are given as examples to show the uniformity of the signal along the length

of the gene. The mitochondrial-encoded transcripts from
other species have a similar pattern of pyrimidine-richness in the three codon positions (see Figures 3B and 3C
and Table 2). In mtDNA-encoded membrane-protein
transcripts, codon position 2 contains the most pyrimidines, as predicted (Figure 3B). However, codon position
3 also contributes slightly to the pyrimidine-rich signal
while codon position 1 is often slightly purine-rich. In the
soluble ribosomal protein transcript the purine-rich signal is driven mainly by codon position 1, while codon
positions 2 and 3 contribute only slightly (see also Figure
3B). The eight known mtDNA-encoded soluble protein
transcripts from Arabidopsis give a similar purine-rich signal in pyrimidine-purine walks (see additional file 1: Figure S1). Even the signals of the individual codon positions
follow the same trends in all eight genes.

As an example of the robustness of this signal, pyrimidinepurine walks of each codon position from the other 12
human mtDNA protein-coding genes are shown in Figure
6. From the linearity of the walk of the entire genome in
Figure 1, it is clear that the signal strength is almost
constant through all protein-coding genes. The
pyrimidine-rich signal is driven by codon position 2 in
almost all cases, with position 3 contributing modestly
and codon position 1 not contributing to an appreciable
extent. The conservation of this pattern through the vast
majority of the mitochondrial transcripts indicates the
strong selective pressure for this signature. Unlike the
other transcripts, the ND6 transcript is purine-rich, but it
is also the only transcript encoded on the (+) light strand
of mtDNA. So there does appear to be a strand-specific
selective force present as well, in human mtDNA. HowPage 8 of 12

ever, the ND6 transcript is pyrimidine-rich in other mammals even though it is encoded on the (+) light strand (see
Table 1). The percent occurrence of each individual nucleotide species in each codon position in mitochondrial
genomes from many eukaryotic species is given in Table 2.
It is shown that C more than T in codon positions 1 and
3 drives the pyrimidine-rich signal in human membrane
protein transcripts, while T more than C at codon position

2 also contributes. The constancy of this pattern throughout the genes as well as the overall abundance of A over G
and C over T can be observed in 2-dimensional walks of
the individual codon positions and entire transcripts (see
additional file 1: Figure S2). The pyrimidine-rich signal is
driven by C over T only in birds, reptiles, and some mammalian species. In all other species examined, T drives the
signal from all 3 codon positions.

Pyrimidine-purine codon position walks of human mtDNA-encoded protein transcripts
Pyrimidine-purine codon position walks of human mtDNA-encoded protein transcripts. The COX1 transcript
walk, absent in this figure, is shown in Figure 5A. All 13 genes have similar patterns in the codon positions of the pyrimidinepurine walks.

Discussion
Mitochondrial-encoded membrane protein transcripts are
pyrimidine-rich
Protein transcripts with an abundance of U (T) in the second codon position encode hydrophobic amino acids
[10,13] that tend to form membrane-spanning alpha helices [14] or beta strands [12]. This is likely the most
important factor that contributes to the relative pyrimidine-richness of mitochondrial membrane complex
transcripts. However it does not explain the entire signal
in humans where large quantities of C in the third codon
position also play an important role. In fact, the pyrimidine-rich signal in humans is mainly driven by C in the
third codon position (Table 2). The signal is also partially
driven by the lack of G in the transcripts. Mitochondrial

DNA is replicated by a strand asymmetric mechanism [15]
that is likely responsible for the unequal strand distribution of G nucleotides [16]. G is the most easily oxidized
base, forming 8-hydroxy guanine [17]. A low percentage
of G in the vertebrate mitochondrial transcripts has been
hypothesized to contribute to mRNA stability in the oxidative environment of the matrix space [18]. However, we
must emphasize that the low G abundance in the light
strand in vertebrates is not the primary source of the pyrimidine richness in these transcripts, because membrane
protein transcripts are also pyrimidine-rich in species
where no mitochondrial strand asymmetry in G content is
present (see Table 2).

The relative contribution of C versus T, and A versus G
throughout the transcripts can be seen in the 2-dimensional walks of the genes using A-G on one axis and C-T
on the other (additional file 1: Figure S2). The percentage
of C vs. T has been shown to vary greatly in different
mammalian lineages [7]. The greater abundance of C over
T on the mitochondrial light (+) strand first appears
evolutionarily in reptiles and is accompanied by a slightly
more G-C rich mitochondrial genome (37 % in Xenopus
compared to 44 % in humans (additional file 1: Table
S1)). The development of GC-rich isochores also first
occurred in the nuclear DNA of reptiles and may be one of
the factors allowing the evolution of warm-blooded birds
and mammals [19]. Based on the data presented here,
some of the same selective pressures may be affecting both
the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.
Mitochondrial-encoded soluble protein transcripts are
purine-rich
It has been suggested that purine-loading of transcripts
may have evolved to prevent detrimental RNA-RNA interactions [20]. However this hypothesis does not explain
the codon-specific pattern of purine-richness in mitochondrial soluble protein-coding transcripts. An A in the
second codon position of nuclear-encoded transcripts
often encodes relatively hydrophilic amino acids [12].
These amino acids have been shown to be abundant in
the aperiodic secondary structure of soluble proteins.
However, in the mitochondrial genome, purines (see Figure 3C), specifically A, in the first codon position (not the
second) mainly drives the purine-richness of soluble proteins (see Table 2). To the best of our knowledge, purine
abundance in the first codon position has not previously
been associated with the hydrophilic nature of soluble
proteins, even though this signature does occur in the vast
majority of nuclear-encoded transcripts [21,22]. One
hypothesis that could be tested is that ribosomes translate
more efficiently when purines are present at the first
codon position. Additionally, increased levels of specific
tRNAs in the mitochondrial matrix may select for such a
trend. However A in the second codon position also contributes to the signal. A decrease in T nucleotides accompanies the increase in A nucleotides in both positions. The
result of this A for T substitution in the first two codon
positions is the greater abundance of the hydrophilic
amino acids lysine and asparagine (codon AAX) in
soluble mitochondrial proteins and the decreased
abundance of the hydrophobic amino acids phenylalanine and leucine (codons UUX and CUX). In fact much
of the purine-rich signal in the soluble proteins is due to
the 3–4 fold increase in positively charged lysine residues
in these proteins compared to membrane proteins (data
not shown). Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins use these
residues to bind the negatively charged phosphate backbone of ribosomal RNA [23,24].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/136

Mitochondrial ribosomal RNA is purine-rich
The selective pressure that maintains the slight purine
richness of mitochondrial ribosomal RNA is not entirely
clear [25,26]. It is known that ribosomal RNA interacts
with ribosomal protein through hydrophobic interactions
of unpaired A residues in the RNA loop regions with
hydrophobic protein side chains [27,28]. Purine nucleotides are more hydrophobic than pyrimidine nucleotides
[13,29]. Therefore this slight purine abundance in the
loop regions may be conserved to facilitate this interaction. Mitochondrial introns are also purine-rich (additional file 1: Figure S3), likely conserving a hydrophobic
interaction between splicing proteins and the loop structures in the RNA.

It is difficult to hypothesize how such small magnitutudes
of purine and pyrimidine base skew can be conserved over
the billion years of mitochondrial evolution. Skewed
ribonucleoside triphosphate pools (highest in ATP) [30]
may select for a high level of A (purine) in ribosomal RNA
and soluble protein transcripts while the need for hydrophobicity in membrane proteins may overcome this pressure, resulting in pyrimidine-rich transcripts. The selective
pressure to contain charged hydrophilic amino acids in
soluble proteins may also contribute to the maintenance
of the purine-rich signal in soluble protein transcripts as
well as the abundance of hydrophobic A residues in the
loop regions of ribosomal RNA. A better understanding of
these mitochondrial selection pressures may be gained in
the future by comparing the pyrimidine-purine transcript
asymmetries with that of non-coding mtDNA.

Methods
Mitochondrial gene sequences, amino acid sequences and
genomes were downloaded from the NCBI website. Java
(JDK 1.50) programs were written to analyze the
sequences. The programs or software details are available
from the authors upon request. Other websites such as the
OGRe database of mitochondrial genomes [31] also allow
analysis and graphing of base composition at the codon
positions as well. The calculations were performed on a
2.8 GHz desktop computer and typically took less than a
few seconds to run. The gene sequences analyzed are the
mRNA synonymous sequences as available in PubMed.
The mitochondrial genome strand labels (+) and (-) follow PubMed convention.

Authors' contributions
PB generated the data, constructed Figures 3, 4, 5, 6 and
drafted the manuscript. AR wrote the majority of the
computer code for sequence analysis, generated the data
for and constructed Figures 1 and 2. DC designed and
supervised the study.
