Abstract
Background: The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has a characteristic reproductive
mode; mature males build nests using a secreted glue-like protein called spiggin. Although recent
studies reported multiple occurrences of genes that encode this glue-like protein spiggin in
threespine and ninespine sticklebacks, it is still unclear how many genes compose the spiggin multigene family.
Results: Genome sequence analysis of threespine stickleback showed that there are at least five
spiggin genes and two pseudogenes, whereas a single spiggin homolog occurs in the genomes of
other fishes. Comparative genome sequence analysis demonstrated that Muc19, a single-copy
mucous gene in human and mouse, is an ortholog of spiggin. Phylogenetic and molecular
evolutionary analyses of these sequences suggested that an ancestral spiggin gene originated from
a member of the mucin gene family as a single gene in the common ancestor of teleosts, and gene
duplications of spiggin have occurred in the stickleback lineage. There was inter-population
variation in the copy number of spiggin genes and positive selection on some codons, indicating that
additional gene duplication/deletion events and adaptive evolution at some amino acid sites may
have occurred in each stickleback population.
Conclusion: A number of spiggin genes exist in the threespine stickleback genome. Our results
provide insight into the origin and dynamic evolutionary process of the spiggin multi-gene family in
the threespine stickleback lineage. The dramatic evolution of genes for mucous substrates may have
contributed to the generation of distinct characteristics such as "bio-glue" in vertebrates.

Background
Genome sequencing has shown that gene copy number
variation (CNV) occurs more often than expected.
Recently, a genome-wide examination of CNVs in
humans revealed that many CNVs show linkage disequilibrium [1]. Moreover, CNVs contribute to inter-individual variation in responses to drugs, immune defence, and
susceptibility to certain diseases in humans and mice
[2,3]. These findings suggest that variation in gene copy

number is sometimes under selection and that it is one of
the driving forces for evolution in these species. However,
because these studies focused on certain human and
mouse diseases, it is unclear whether CNVs and these features of CNVs are common phenomena in vertebrates.

[4] and has recently attracted attention because of the evolution of diverse morphological characters among populations [5,6]. This fish is also well known for its
characteristic reproductive mode in which mature males
build nests using a glue-like protein called "spiggin" to
adhere materials to the nest [5,7]. There are multiple
occurrences of genes that encode spiggin, suggesting the
existence of an ancestral gene prior to the expansion of teleosts and the duplication of spiggin genes both before and
after the speciation of threespine stickleback [8]. This
implies a possible relationship between spiggin gene
duplication and the stickleback's specific reproductive
nest-building behavior.
It is unclear how many genes compose the spiggin multigene family [8-10]. In previous studies, spiggin gene
sequences were characterized mainly based on cDNA
[8,9], and information derived from genome sequences
was not considered. The results of genomic Southern analyses to estimate the number of spiggin genes differ among
studies [8,10]. The genome sequence of threespine stickleback was recently published [11], making it possible to
determine the number of spiggin genes and conduct comparative genomic analyses. Moreover, it may allow the
exploration of the origin of and evolutionary processes
occurring in the spiggin multi-gene family.
We aimed to resolve the spiggin multi-gene family in
threespine stickleback and understand its origin and evolutionary processes. We isolated members of the spiggin
multi-gene family from the threespine stickleback
genome database and conducted phylogenetic and synteny analyses of these genes together with their homologs
and related genes. We also performed molecular evolutionary analyses to examine the evolutionary forces that
shaped the spiggin multi-gene family.

Results
Identification of the spiggin multi-gene family and
homologs in genome sequences
We identified seven putative spiggin genes in linkage
group (LG) IV of the threespine stickleback genome
sequence. No other spiggin related genes have been found
in other regions, although the whole genome was
searched exhaustively. The length of the region in LG IV
that contained the entire spiggin multi-gene family was
approximately 200 kbp (Fig. 1). These genes were located
tandemly in the same direction. We named these seven
genes Gaac_spg1 to Gaac_spg7 (Fig. 1). A relatively long
intergenic region (approximately 46 kbp) was observed
between the third and fourth spiggin genes (Figs. 1, 2)
compared with the lengths of the other intergenic regions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/209

Gaac_spg4 were shorter than the other spiggin genes
because a region corresponding to the posterior region of
the other genes was truncated (Fig. 2). Although a rather
high level of similarity was observed among the spiggin
genes, Gaac_spg2 had relatively low similarity with the
other genes (Fig. 2). Low similarity was also found in the
central region of Gaac_spg6, although the other regions of
this gene had high similarity with the other copies (Fig. 2).
We examined the region of low sequence similarity in
detail.
To examine the detailed differences in the spiggin gene
sequences, we aligned all of the genes that were identified
in this study (Additional file 1). Examination of the
Gaac_spg2 sequence indicated that the central region has
been lost (Figs. 1, 2, and Additional file 1, P. 4–5). Even
the regions that showed relatively high similarity with
other spiggin genes had several indels, and some exonintron boundaries were not conserved (Additional file 1),
suggesting that this gene has been disrupted. Gaac_spg6
also contains several indels and mutations in the exonintron boundaries (Additional file 1), as well as a lowsimilarity region containing GC-rich regions (Fig. 1), a
repeated region (two repeat units, 332 bp in length), and
a gap sequence that has not yet been sequenced (Additional file 1). We amplified and sequenced the regions
that contained indels to confirm that such features were
not caused by sequencing errors (data not shown). Based
on these results, we judged that Gaac_spg2 and Gaac_spg6
are pseudogenes and thus excluded them from further
analyses.
The percent similarity was estimated among the putative
ORF regions of the remaining spiggin genes. High similarity was observed between Gaac_spg1 and Gaac_spg5
(99%), Gaac_spg1 and Gaac_spg7 (90%), and Gaac_spg5
and Gaac_spg7 (90%). Gaac_spg3 and Gaac_spg4 were
also highly similar (92%). However, the similarities
between the first three gene pairs (Gaac_spg1, Gaac_spg5,
and Gaac_spg7) and the latter pair (Gaac_spg3 and
Gaac_spg4) were relatively low (83–88%). The similarities among the translated amino acid sequences were all
lower than the similarities among the nucleotide
sequences, suggesting that there were more nonsynonymous than synonymous substitutions.
We identified one spiggin homolog in scaffold 898 of the
medaka genome sequence. This scaffold is one of the
shortest scaffolds (78 kbp) and assembled to none of the
LGs of the medaka genome. Combined with the results of
a previous study [8], this demonstrates the occurrence of
a single spiggin homolog in four fish species: torafugu,
spotted green pufferfish, medaka, and zebrafish.

Some of these spiggin genes had relatively high diversity
in length and similarity. Gaac_spg2, Gaac_spg3, and

(Gaac_spg1-Gaac_spg7) are plotted in the region containing all members of the spiggin multi-gene family (21,018,160–
21,202,000 bp in LG IV) of the threespine stickleback genome sequence. Putative spiggin genes are named and shaded.

We predicted the conserved domain structures of the
translated sequences of the spiggin genes and the medaka
spiggin homolog. All of the spiggins and the medaka spiggin homolog shared the von Willebrand factor D domain
(VWD) structure. Except for the VWDs, we could not identify any domains characteristic of the translated products
of secreted mucin genes, Muc2, 5AC, 5B, and 19, which
are suggested to be related to the spiggin genes [8].
Phylogenetic analyses of spiggin genes
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the spiggin
genes in threespine and ninespine sticklebacks and their
homologs in other fishes (Additional file 2). We used various data from the spiggin genes in threespine stickleback:
spiggin genes isolated in the threespine stickleback
genome sequence (Gaac_spg1, 3, 4, 5, and 7) and spiggin
cDNA sequences published in Genbank (spg1-spg4;
DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI accession numbers: AB221477,
AB221481-83). We also used spiggin genes from ninespine stickleback (spiggin α-γ; DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI acces-

sion numbers: DQ018713-8) and spiggin homologs
isolated from the torafugu, spotted green pufferfish,
medaka, and zebrafish genome sequences. No differences
in topology among the analyses (neighbor joining [12],
maximum likelihood [13], and Bayesian [14]) were
found. The tree derived from the maximum likelihood
(ML) analysis is shown (Fig. 3).
In the phylogenetic analyses, the threespine stickleback
spiggin genes (Gaac_spg1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and spg1-spg4) and
the ninespine stickleback genes (Pungitius_spgα-γ)
formed a monophyletic group (Fig. 3). The clade of threespine and ninespine stickleback spiggin genes was divided
into three subgroups: Clade A, containing Gaac_spg1,
Gaac_spg5, spg1, and spg4; Clade B, containing
Gaac_spg3, Gaac_spg4, spg2, spg3, and ninespine stickleback spiggins (α, β, and γ); and Clade C, containing
Gaac_spg7 (Fig. 3). Clades A and B were most closely
related, and Clade C was basal (Fig. 3). Although it is not
clear how many spiggin genes occur in ninespine stickle-

four other fish species (Tetraodon, spotted green pufferfish; Takifugu, torafugu; Oryzias, medaka; Danio, zebrafish) were subjected to phylogenetic analyses, and the resulting ML tree is shown.

phylogenetic studies (exons 7–16). The gene structure of spiggin cDNA sequences is shown in gray. Shaded boxes in the

back, this result suggests that the spiggin genes diverged
both before and after the divergence of threespine and
ninespine sticklebacks.
When we focused on the genes from the threespine stickleback genome sequence (Gaac_spg1, 3, 4, 5, and 7), the
phylogenetic relationships of the genes were not congruent with their chromosomal locations (Figs. 1, 3), indicating that the genes that showed close relationships in the
phylogenetic tree were not necessarily located close to
each other on the chromosome. Thus, it was not possible
to estimate the order of the gene duplication events based
on the relative gene positions. Spiggin genes isolated from

the threespine stickleback genome sequence and those
from cDNA sequences did not show exact one-to-one corresponding relationships (Fig. 3). Corresponding relationships were found for only a few genes: Gaac_spg1 +
Gaac_spg5 and spg1 in Clade A, and Gaac_spg4 and spg2
+ spg3 in Clade B (Fig. 3).
Gene structure
We estimated the gene structure of the spiggin genes in
threespine stickleback. In the spiggin genes isolated from
the genome sequence (Gaac_spg1, 3, 4, 5, and 7), the
numbers and lengths of exons in the 5' region were
diverse. The second exon of Gaac_spg7 and the fifth exon

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:209

of Gaac_spg3 were absent, and the second exon of
Gaac_spg4 was 20 nucleotides shorter than that of the
other genes (Fig. 3). The length of introns also differed
among the genes; introns in Gaac_spg7 were longer than
those in the other genes (Fig. 3). In Gaac_spg3 and
Gaac_spg4, exons in the posterior region were truncated,
which was apparent in the dotplot analysis (Figs. 2, 3).
When information about the putative exon-intron boundary in the threespine and ninespine stickleback spiggin
cDNA sequences was taken into account, there was a tendency for spiggin genes in Clade A to have similar exonintron structures, whereas those in Clade B had diversity
in the length and the number of exons (Fig. 3). Although
the gene structures of ninespine stickleback spiggins were
unclear because only partial cDNA sequences have been
published, Gaac_spg3 and Gaac_spg4 had fewer exons
than did the other genes, and spg1, 2, 3, and 4 contained
apparently untranscribed regions of the other genes. Probable changes in the consensus sequences of the exonintron boundary or terminal codon may have caused the
elongation of the ORF of these genes.
We also examined the gene structures of the spiggin gene
homologs of other fishes. In the spiggin homologs of
torafugu and spotted green pufferfish, the lengths and
sequence similarities of exons were conserved. Based on
sequence similarity in some exons, spiggin homologs of
medaka and zebrafish also seemed to conserve the basic
exon-intron structure with spiggin genes of threespine
stickleback, although reliable estimation of the ORF
region was difficult in these two species because of possible gaps in their genome sequence data. The lengths of
introns were dramatically short in torafugu and spotted
green pufferfish, whereas the homologs of medaka and
zebrafish had very long introns (Fig. 3).
Detection of positive selection and gene recombination
We conducted an evolutionary analysis to examine the
possibility that the threespine stickleback spiggin genes
were under positive selection and obtained evidence of
positive selection (p < 0.01) in two subgroups: Clades A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/209

and B (Table 1). In Clade B, the 140th amino acid residue
was estimated to be under positive selection with a high
posterior probability (PP > 0.99). Although translated
sequences of these genes conserved the VWD, which creates multimers with other molecules containing a VWD,
the 140th amino acid residue was not located in this conserved region.
Evidence of gene conversion was found in two regions of
Gaac_spg3 and Gaac_spg4 (p < 0.001; Table 2). The
regions were 152 and 138 bp long, respectively.
Comparison of synteny
The chromosomal locations of the spiggin multi-gene
family, its homologs, and their related genes were examined and compared among the species. Spiggin genes or
their homologs were located in LG IV (threespine stickleback), scaffold 273 (torafugu), scaffold 14,629 (spotted
green pufferfish), scaffold 898 (medaka), and scaffold
9975 (zebrafish). The chromosomal locations of all of
these genes, except for those of threespine stickleback, are
unknown because the scaffolds have not been annotated
to a specific chromosome. In human and mouse, the
chromosomal location of the secreted mucin gene family
(i.e., Muc2, 5AC, 5B, 6, and 19), which is thought to be
related to the spiggin multi-gene family [8], was examined. In human, Muc2, 5AC, 5B, and 6 were located on
the 11th chromosome as a cluster, whereas Muc19 was
located in the 12th chromosome. In mouse, Muc2, 5AC,
5B, and 6 clustered on the 7th chromosome, whereas
Muc19 was located on the 15th chromosome. We also
explored the genes around the spiggin multi-gene family,
its homologs, and mucin genes in each species. Although
other genes were not identified in the scaffolds of medaka
or zebrafish because of their shortness, some genes in the
syntenic region were identified by virtue of the other species' synteny information (Fig. 4). As a result, we found
that torafugu, spotted green pufferfish, medaka, and
zebrafish shared several genes around the spiggin gene
homologs with threespine stickleback, as well as Muc19
in human and mouse (Fig. 4). These facts strongly suggest

that spiggin and Muc19 are orthologous. In contrast, the
cluster of Muc2/5AC/5B/6 and Muc19 did not share any
genes around them, suggesting a paralogous relationship
between them.

Discussion
Spiggin gene repertoire in threespine stickleback
There are at least five spiggin genes and two pseudogenes
in the threespine stickleback genome sequence. However,
spiggin genes from the genome sequence (Gaac_spg1, 3,
4, 5, and 7) and those from cDNA (spg1-spg4) did not
show one-to-one correspondence (Fig. 3). Although these
two types of spiggin gene are derived from different
sources, they should show corresponding relationships
because they were sequenced from a single species. The
spiggin cDNAs (spg1-spg4) are extremely unlikely to contain alleles at spiggin loci because of their sequence diversity (Fig. 3).

One possible reason for the absence of such correspondence is that the two populations used for sequencing are
highly differentiated genetically. A population in Bear
Paw Lake, Alaska, USA, was used for the genome project
[15-17]. The population used for cDNA sequencing was
from the Pacific Ocean group in eastern Hokkaido, Japan
[8,18]. Allozyme and SNP analyses show that they are
genetically distinct populations [5,18,19]. In addition,
our results suggest the possibility of population-specific
evolution of the spiggin multi-gene family. Gene duplication/deletion, amino acid replacement, and gene conversion may have occurred independently in each stickleback
population (Fig. 3; Tables 1, 2). To confirm this possibility, further study of the genome sequence of the Pacific
Ocean group is necessary.
Origin and evolution of the spiggin multi-gene family
Our previous phylogenetic analyses using partial amino
acid sequences of the conserved domain structure suggested that the Muc19 gene is most closely related to the
spiggin multi-gene family; phylogenetic analyses using
full length spiggin/mucin genes could not be made
because of high gene diversity [8]. We confirmed this
hypothesis through the analysis of the chromosome location and synteny of the spiggin and related gene families
of various vertebrate species. Thus, we conclude that spig-

gin genes originated from members of the mucin gene
family. Translated spiggin gene products are high-molecular-mass glycoproteins that constitute glue-like proteins
[20]; translated mucin gene products are also high-molecular-mass glycoproteins that represent major components
of mucus-like substances [21]. This similarity clearly
reflects the orthologous relationships of these genes.
Five spiggin genes and two pseudogenes were observed in
the threespine stickleback genome sequence, and three
types of spiggin genes have been identified in ninespine
stickleback. In contrast, Muc19 is a single-copy gene in
human and mouse, and a single spiggin homolog was
found in fishes other than sticklebacks. These facts and the
results of our phylogenetic analysis imply that the ancestral spiggin gene existed as a single gene in the ancestral
fish lineage, and duplications of the spiggin gene occurred
both before and after the divergence of threespine and
ninespine sticklebacks (Fig. 3).
Spiggin mRNA is found in the kidney in threespine stickleback [8,10,20]. However, Muc19 mRNA is found in the
submaxillary gland in human and mouse [22,23]. Thus,
the expression pattern of the ancestral spiggin gene may
have changed after the divergence of tetrapods and fishes.
In human, secretory mucin genes other than Muc19 (i.e.,
Muc2, 5AC, 5B, and 6) are thought to have evolved from
a common ancestral gene by two successive duplications
[24]. These mucin genes show both spatially [25-27] and
temporally specific expression patterns [28-31]. It is clear
that these genes were neofunctionalized after the gene
duplications. A recent study also showed lineage-specific
gene duplication of the mucin gene family in chicken and
found that the additional gene encodes ovomucin, which
is abundant in egg white and responsible for its gel-like
properties [32]. These findings show that expression pattern shifts and gains of new function have occurred
repeatedly following gene duplication in the mucin gene
family in various vertebrate lineages.
We examined the expression of spiggin homologs in
torafugu and zebrafish. Although we did not find expression in any of the zebrafish tissues examined, we did find
kidney-specific expression in male and female torafugu
(Additional file 3). In threespine stickleback, spiggin

genes are expressed only in the kidneys of mature males,
and translated products of spiggin are secreted as a glue in
male nest building [8,10,20]. Such a glue-like protein produced in the kidney has not been reported in torafugu.
This implies that the function of spiggin should differ
between threespine stickleback and torafugu. The shifts in
expression and gain of new function as a glue may have
occurred in the spiggin gene family in sticklebacks in a
fashion similar to the mucin gene family in human or
ovomucin in chicken. Of course, we cannot exclude the
possibility that mutation events in regulatory regions of
these genes, which could cause such divergent expression,
also occurred in spiggins of other fish lineages. Further
expression and functional analyses will explore the
detailed evolutionary processes of the spiggin multi-gene
family in threespine stickleback.

Background of the evolution of the spiggin multi-gene
family
Our results demonstrate that the spiggin multi-gene family of threespine stickleback is localized in a cluster. In
general, such repeated genes can be divided into two
types: variant and invariant repeats [33]. Variant repeats
are copies of a gene that differ in sequence from the original, and sometimes can perform markedly different functions [34]. Invariant repeats are gene copies with identical
or nearly identical sequences, which can result in the synthesis of large quantities of gene product [35].

Although it is reasonable to hypothesize that spiggin
genes are invariant repeats because a large amount of glue
is required for nest building, considerable diversity was
observed in their sequences. The existence of many nonsynonymous substitutions in the sequences confirmed
that this multi-gene family is constructed of variant
repeats. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that diversify-

ing evolution occurred by positive Darwinian selection,
rather than the random fixation of neutral mutations.
Adaptive evolution to the local environment seems to
exist in the background of the evolution of the spiggin
multi-gene family. There are distinct wild populations of
threespine stickleback that have morphological, behavioral, and physiological differences. Various characters in
each population may have evolved to match the local
environment; one character is nest-building behavior
[36]. During nest building, a glue-like protein is used to
adhere materials to the nest [20]. To maximize its function, the character of the glue should be adapted to the
local environment (e.g., temperature, pH, and salinity).
The spiggin multi-gene family might have evolved in conjunction with the adaptation of the glue-like protein to
various environments.
Nest-building behavior might also be under sexual selection by females because this behavior is an important
component of reproduction. Mature females are more
attracted to males with decorated nests than to males with
undecorated nests [37,38]. Moreover, the relative weight
of a nest building male's kidney, which secretes the gluelike protein, is positively correlated with nest characters
such as neatness or compactness [39], which may reflect
male quality. Because mature males use the glue-like protein in nest building, spiggin genes may have also evolved
under sexual selection.

Methods
Identification of spiggin genes and their homologs in
genome databases
Genome sequences of threespine stickleback and medaka,
which are available from the Ensembl site [40] (threespine stickleback: BROAD S1, assembled in Feb 2006;
medaka:FHdrR, assembled in Oct 2005), were used for a
TblastN search [41]. Published spiggin cDNA sequences
(spg1-spg4: DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI accession numbers:
AB221477, AB221481-83) were used as queries. Protocols
for the identification of genes followed those of a previous
study [8]. Isolated sequences were translated and subjected to a BLASTP search. Sequences that were considered
products of homologs of the spiggin gene were used for
further analyses. The prediction of coding regions was performed using wise2 [42] and confirmed by eye.
Sequence analysis
The chromosome location and direction of the spiggin
multi-gene family in threespine stickleback were estimated using PIPmaker [43]. We extracted a genomic
region that contained all members of the spiggin multigene family from the genome sequence available in
Ensembl (LGIV_21,018,160–21,202,000 bp; 183,841 bp
in length). Similarity to this extracted region was plotted
using one of the isolated spiggin genes (Gaac_spg1) as a
query. Similarities among the spiggin genes were also
examined using a dotplot. The extracted genomic region
was compared with each of the seven isolated spiggin
genes, and more than 50% similarity was plotted.

Conclusion
Five spiggin genes and two pseudogenes were identified in
the threespine stickleback genome sequence and singlecopy spiggin homologs were found in other fishes. In
addition, Muc19, a single-copy gene in human and
mouse, was demonstrated to be a putative ortholog of
spiggin. These results suggest that the ancestral spiggin
gene originated from the mucin gene family as a singlecopy gene and that subsequent gene duplication events
occurred before and after threespine stickleback speciation. We also suggest a complex evolutionary trajectory of
the spiggin multi-gene family, including positive selection
after duplication events in stickleback populations. Further study of additional threespine stickleback populations will demonstrate population-specific evolution of
the spiggin multi-gene family in detail and may provide
insight into the evolutionary forces shaping the gene family. The dramatic evolution of genes such as mucin or the
spiggin multi-gene family that encode mucous substrates
may have helped to generate the characteristic of "bioglue" in vertebrates.

Estimation of the exon-intron structure was performed
using wise2. Translated sequences of the isolated spiggin
multi-gene family in threespine stickleback and its
homologs in other fishes (torafugu, spotted green pufferfish, medaka, and zebrafish) were used as queries. Exonintron boundaries of the threespine and ninespine stickleback spiggin cDNA sequences were also estimated based
on these results.
The regions that contained the indels of Gaac_spg2 and
Gaac_spg6 (exons 3 and 16 in Gaac_spg2; exons 13, 16 +
17, and 22 in Gaac_spg6; Additional file 1) were confirmed by additional sequencing of one individual. The
stickleback collected from Bear Paw Lake, Alaska, USA,
which was the resource for the genome project, was used
for total DNA extraction using an Aquapure genomic
DNA isolation kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules,
CA, USA). PCR reactions were performed using primers
designed to amplify regions with indels (Additional file 1,
4), using TaKaRa Ex-taq (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga,
Japan) in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction conditions for PCR were:
94°C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94°C for 15s, 53°C for 15s,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:209

72°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 10 min. The amplified PCR
products were cloned using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit for
Sequencing (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Cycle sequencing was conducted using dye-labeled terminators (Big Dye terminator ver.3.1, Applied Biosystems)
and the reaction products were sequenced using an ABI
PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
We estimated the expression pattern of the spiggin
homolog in torafugu and zebrafish. We extracted total
RNA from kidney, liver, muscle, skin, gonad, heart, brain,
fin, eye, gill (zebrafish), and stomach (torafugu) tissues of
male and female torafugu and zebrafish using TRIZOL
Reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was reverse transcribed
using a TaKaRa RNA-PCR kit ver2.1 (TaKaRa Bio) and
then subjected to PCR using a pair of primers designed to
amplify a partial region of each obtained spiggin homolog
gene (Additional file 4) as described above. The reaction
conditions for PCR were: 94°C for 2 min; 30 cycles of
94°C for 15s, 51°C (torafugu) or 57°C (zebrafish) for
15s, 72°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 10 min. As a negative
control, PCR amplification was also conducted using each
RNA sample without reverse transcription. As a positive
control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) mRNA was amplified using a pair of primers
described previously [8].
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using spiggin genes
in threespine and ninespine stickleback and their
homologs in other fishes. We used threespine and ninespine stickleback spiggin genes that were isolated from the
genome sequence (Gaac_spg1, 3, 4, 5, and 7), published
spiggin cDNA sequences (spg1-spg4; Pungitius_spgα-γ),
and

in
torafugu
(Takifugu_spg_homolog), spotted green pufferfish
(Tetraodon_spg_homolog), medaka (Oryzias_spg_
homolog), and zebrafish (Danio_spg_homolog; Additional file 2). Nucleotide sequences were translated and
aligned using ClustalW implemented in MEGA3.1 [44].
To avoid misaligning, we first extracted VWDs, which are
conserved in all of the sequences. Multiple alignment was
performed for each VWD, excluding truncated domains,
and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The preliminary
analysis indicated that the relative positions of VWDs are
conserved in all of the genes except the medaka spiggin
homolog (Additional file 5). Based on these results, we
aligned the translated sequences of full-length spiggin and
their homologs.

Because the ninespine stickleback spiggin genes were published as partial sequences, we concatenated them based
on conserved domain region information. Gap sequences
of ninespine stickleback spiggins were treated as missing
data. Ambiguous regions were excluded, and the resulting

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/209

aligned sequences (corresponding to exons 6–17; 211
amino acids in length) were subjected to neighbor-joining
(NJ), maximum-likelihood (ML), and Bayesian analyses
[14], using MEGA3.1, Treefinder [45], and MrBayes,
respectively. In all analyses, the JTT model [46] was
selected as a substitution model. In MrBayes, analyses
were done for 1,000,000 generations and sampled every
1000th generation. The log likelihoods were observed
graphically, and trees that were excluded before reaching
"stationarity" were used to construct a 50% majority consensus tree and calculate posterior probabilities (PP).
Estimating the pattern of nucleotide substitution and
positively selected sites
The diversity of threespine stickleback spiggin genes was
examined with molecular evolutionary analyses using ω,
which is the ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN)
to synonymous substitutions (dS). We used the threespine stickleback spiggin genes isolated from the genome
database (Gaac_spg1, 3, 4, 5, and 7) and the published
spiggin cDNA sequences (spg1-spg4). In addition to these
sequences, the spiggin homologs isolated in other fishes
(torafugu, spotted green pufferfish, medaka, and
zebrafish) were added and aligned using ClustalW in
MEGA3.1, with gaps excluded. Considering that positive
selection may act in very short episodes during the evolution of a protein and affect only a few sites along a lineage,
we used a recently developed likelihood-accommodating
ω ratio to vary among both lineages of interest and amino
acid sites, i.e., an improved version of the "branch-site"
model [47].

We tested for positive selection in the whole threespine
stickleback spiggin gene lineage and in two subgroups
(Clades A and B) as foreground branches. The branch-site
model compares two models. The alternative model
assumes four classes of sites in terms of ω. In the alternative model, site class 0 contains codons that are conserved
throughout the tree, with 0 < ω0 < 1. Site class 1 contains
codons that are neutral throughout the tree with ω1 = 1.
Site classes 2a and 2b contain codons that are conserved
or neutral on the background branches (2a, 0 < ω2 < 1; 2b,
ω2 = 1), but are under positive selection on the foreground branches with ω2 > 1, estimated from the data.
The null model differs from the alternative model in that
ω2 is fixed at 1. Thus, in the likelihood-ratio test (LRT), a
significantly higher likelihood of the alternative model
than that of the null model indicates positive selection on
the foreground branches. The Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB)
approach was used to calculate the posterior probability
that each site belongs to the site class of positive selection
on the foreground lineages.

Detection of recombination
The gene conversion detection method as implemented in
GENECONV [48] was used to look for evidence of gene
conversion in the spiggin multi-gene family in the threespine stickleback genome sequence. Aligned sequences of
the isolated spiggin genes (Gaac_spg1, 3, 4, 5, and 7) were
subjected to analysis using the default settings. The GENECONV program computes global and pairwise p-values
and allows mismatches within converted regions. Global
p-values are conservative and accurate because they are
corrected for multiple comparisons, whereas the p-values
of pairwise fragments are not. We considered p < 0.05 significant for both methods.
