Abstract
Background: Earlier we suggested the concept of the positive evolutionary role of tumors.
According to this concept, tumors provide conditions for the expression of evolutionarily new and/
or sleeping genes in their cells. Thus, tumors are considered as evolutionary proving ground or
reservoir of expression. To support this concept we have previously characterized in silico and
experimentally a new class of human tumor-related transcribed sequences.
Results: In this article we describe results of further studies of previously described tumor-related
sequences. The results of molecular phylogeny studies, Southern hybridization experiments and
computational comparison with genomes of other species are presented.
Conclusion: These results suggest that these previously described tumor-related human
transcripts are also relatively evolutionarily new.

Background
In previous studies [1,2], we formulated the concept of
the positive evolutionary role of tumors. According to this
concept, tumors provide conditions for the expression of
evolutionarily new and/or sleeping genes in their cells.
Thus, tumors are considered as an evolutionary proving
ground of expression.
In earlier work using the computational differential display approach, we identified a considerable number of
human tumor-related expressed sequence tag (EST) clusters many of which had not been described previously [3].
Experimental data confirmed the results obtained in silico,

i.e., the tumor-specificity of expression of these sequences
[4].
To experimentally examine our prediction [1,2] that at
least some tumor-related sequences are evolutionarily
new, we performed Southern hybridization of our newly
described tumor-related sequences with genomic DNA
from different animal species. Hybridization was found
only with human and orangutan DNA, with one exception in which a signal was also developed with chicken
DNA.
We performed a search for ortholog sequences in fugu,
tetraodon, zebrafish, frog, chicken, rat, mouse, cow, dog,

macaque, and chimpanzee genomes using cross-species
chained alignments. This search confirmed that our newly
described tumor-related transcripts are relatively evolutionarily new, with some of their orthologs having originated in mammals and others in primates.
PCR experiments with specific primers were performed on
a panel of DNAs from different primates. Amplified fragments were cloned and sequenced, and their molecular
phylogeny was studied. The results show that these
sequences form well-defined phylogenetic clusters which
correspond to the phylogeny of primates as previously
understood.
Taken together, our Southern hybridization, molecular
phylogeny, and comparative genomics data support our
prediction [1,2] that evolutionarily new and/or sleeping
sequences may be specifically expressed in tumor cells.

Results
Transcribed sequences analyzed
Because of the constant rebuilding of the UniGene clusters and EST shuffling between them, we cannot follow
the history of each cluster. Clusters very often do not mark
a specific transcript, but a set of transcripts whose genome
mapping regions are often neighboring but may be not
overlapping. Therefore, we selected ESTs which were used
for primer design in our previous investigations [3,4] and
followed the history of their sequences in UniGene.

In this paper, we present analyses of the following ESTs

PCR analysis and Southern hybridization
We performed Southern hybridization of [α-32P]-labeled
sequence-specific fragments with genomic DNA from
eleven different animal species: lamprey, fish, frog,
chicken, pigeon, mouse, rat, guinea pig, sheep, horse, and
human. Southern hybridization analysis reveals only
homology sequences in chicken genome for AA166653specific probe. In addition, we were able to demonstrate
by Southern hybridization that a sequence homologous
to the human AA166653-specific 11.2-kb fragment is
present in orangutan DNA [see Additional file 1].

Therefore, we performed PCR amplification of sequencespecific fragments on the panel of primate DNAs. The
results of PCR experiments and comparative genomics
data obtained by homology analysis of these tumorrelated sequences within primate DNA are presented in
Table 1. As follows from the results shown in Table 1,
sequences homologous to tumor-related human EST are
found in a variety of primates.
AL040372- and AI792557-specific tumor-related human
sequences are found in the majority of primate species
studied, even in the most archaic. The AI792557-homologous sequence is not found in lemurs and colobus monkeys. The AA166653-homologous sequence is present
only in apes and macaques. The AI952931-homologous
sequence is found in apes, new world monkeys, and

amplified by PCR on a DNA evolutionary panel with
genomic DNA from species non-primate species using the
selected primers.
Comparative genomics and bioinformatics analyses
Hs.133107 cluster consists of spliced mRNAs, but the
studied sequence AI792557 is a short, unspliced EST and
is mapped to an intronic region of Hs.133107. Analysis of
cross-species chained alignments revealed that sequences
homologous to AI792557 can be found in the genomes of
the cow, dog, rat, mouse, rhesus, and chimpanzee with
similarities of 60% to 72% in non-primate genomes and
of 93% in rhesus and 98% in chimpanzee genomes (Table
2). Chimpanzee chromosome 8 contains a 400-bp region
with a near-perfect homology to human EST AI792557,
almost completely overlapping the 344-bp sequence of
interest [see Additional file 2]. We also found an explanation for the reported absence of PCR signal in the chimpanzee genome: the AI792557-specific forward primer is
disrupted by TTATC deletion located at the border of the
segment of human-chimpanzee homology. It is of interest
that both human and chimpanzee AI792557-like loci are
5'-flanked by an imperfect poly(t) repeat. Genomic
sequences upstream of the poly(t) repeat and downstream
of the 3' end of human-chimpanzee homologous segments do not possess any resemblance. Similarly,
sequences corresponding to AI792557 were found in the
genome of Macaca mulatta, via BLAT and chained alignments, but not in PCR experiments. Sequences that
belong to the Hs. 128594 cluster represent human mRNA
CACNA2D3 encoding for the voltage-dependent calcium
channel protein alpha 2/delta 3 subunit. At the same time,
our target 415-bp sequence, AI952931, is located in an
intron of the CACNA2D3 gene. This EST has two exons
and is transcribed from the strand opposite to the gene, as
follows from direction of its splice sites consensus. The
genomic sequence corresponding to the 315-bp 3'-exon
can be found in genomes of cow, dog, rat, and mouse with
a similarity of 64%–75%, and with almost perfect identity
(93% and 99%) in the macaque and chimpanzee
genomes ([see Additional file 2], Table 2). At the same
time, sequences homologous to the 200-bp 3'-terminal
fragment of this EST are found in the genomes of opossum (72% similarity) and chicken (61% similarity, Table
2). Only 14% and 16% of the human genomic sequence
can be aligned with chicken and opossum orthologs,
respectively (Table 2). Interestingly, the 120-bp sequence
representing the 5'-exon sequence of AI952931 is entirely
absent in all known genomes except human and
macaque.

A 450-bp tumor-related sequence corresponding to the
non-coding cluster Hs.426704 (former Hs. 154173, core
EST AA166653) is mapped to a human ribosomal DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1750-9378/1/8

complete repeating unit. For this cluster, we used PCR
primers specific to sequences located on chromosome 2.
According to our experimental data [4], this sequence is
expressed in carcinomas only. This sequence has not been
found in any sequenced mammalian genome except rhesus and chimpanzee, with similarity levels of 88% and
99%, respectively ([see Additional file 2], Table 2). In the
chimpanzee genome, the Hs.426704 locus underwent
expansion, as it has been found in two locations on chromosome 13 as well as on chromosomes 18 and Y (Table
3).
Cluster Hs. 133294 corresponds to mRNA IQGAP3,
which encodes a member of the Rho GTPase family of regulators involved in cytokinesis. Specifically, cluster Hs.
133294 includes an alternatively spliced isoform of the
IQGAP3 gene that arises by retention of its 672-nt intron.
Earlier [4], we demonstrated that this isoform is characterized by broad tumor-related and embryonal expression,
thus representing a new carcinoembryonic transcript.
The AL040372-specific sequence corresponding to the
tumor-related transcript of interest is mapped to the 3'-terminal intron and the 3'-UTR of IQGAP3 mRNA.
Sequences with strong homology to this genomic region
are present in macaque (94%) and chimpanzee (99%)
genomes. Moreover, sequences with a similarity of 52%–
73% to this genomic region have been found in opossum,
mouse, rat, dog, and cow genomes (Table 2). Interestingly, the part of the 3'-UTR exonic sequence which is
overexpressed in human tumors according to UniGene
data is not present (or is highly divergent) in the mouse
genome [see Additional file 2].
Summary data of the cross-species homology analysis of
ESTs are presented in Table 2. Similar results were
obtained when experimentally studied PCR fragments
were analysed [see Additional file 2].
Using BLAT, we found that AL040372- and AA166653homologous sequences have duplicates in the human and
nonhuman primate genomes (Table 3).
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
Fig. 1a represents a phylogeny of AL040372-homologous
sequences. The scale bar indicates the relative amount of
change along branches. All-against-all BLAT searches
among non-primate species sequences were conducted.
Sequences with more than 70% identity were found in
cow and dog genomes. These sequences were included in
the phylogeny reconstruction. All primates except lemurs
produce a well-supported monophyletic group which
organizes a separate cluster on the phylogenetic tree.
Among these fourteen sequences, lemur, dog, and cow
form separate nodes. Fig. 1b shows a phylogenetic tree of

AA166653-homologous sequences. These sequences were
found in humans but in only four other primates. BLAT
searches against non-primate genomes did not reveal any
homologies. Pongo sequences form a distinct node. The
phylogeny of AI792557-homologous sequences among
primates is described in Fig. 1c. There are two separate
clusters on the phylogenetic tree, one of which consists of
new world monkeys (Ateles and Callimico), and the other
of which includes apes and old world monkeys. Erythrocebus and macaques, which belong to the old world monkeys, form a separate branch. This phylogenetic tree
corresponds well with the existing classification of primates. Fig. 1d represents the phylogeny of AI952931homologous sequences. Sequences with near 80% similarity were found in the dog and cow genomes using
BLAT. These sequences were included in the phylogeny
reconstruction. On this tree, primate sequences formed a
separate cluster that splits from the dog and cow node.
Other algorithms (ML and MP) provide similar results in
trees topology.
In some primates (Callimico goeldii, Ateles fusciceps), Alu
sequences were found in AL040372-homologous fragments (Fig. 2a, lanes 2 and 3). These Alu sequences belong
to type Y, as shown by sequencing (data not shown). Fig.
2b shows the location of the insert on the genetic map of
the IQGAP gene.

Discussion
The prediction that evolutionarily new sequences may be
expressed in tumor cells was made in our previous articles
[1,2]. To experimentally examine this prediction, we performed Southern hybridization of [α-32P]-labeled newly
described tumor-related fragments with genomic DNA
from different animal species. Sequences studied in the
present article were selected from tumor-related transcripts revealed by an in silico search and experimentally
described in our previous papers [3,4].
Hybridization signals were detected only with human and
orangutan DNA, with the single exception of a signal
observed after hybridization of the AA166653-specific [α32P]-labeled probe with chicken DNA [see Additional file
1]. This signal was consistently observed in several hybrid-

ization experiments. However, comparative genomics
analysis has not revealed AA166653-homologous
sequences in the chicken genome. We suggest that this signal may be an artifact of hybridization.
Interestingly, in the case of the AA166653-homologous
sequence, signals on Southern blot form a "ladder" [see
Additional file 1], which is a feature of fragments located
in a repetitive sequence. It is in good agreement with computational evidence that the AA166653-specific sequence
is located in an intergenic spacer upstream of the 23 repeat
region of the human ribosomal DNA complete repeating
unit [4], which is tandemly repeated and forms arrays in
genomes of eukaryotes.
Comparative genomics analysis have shown that the
tumor-related transcripts under consideration have
orthologs in mammal genomes only and not in those of
fishes, amphibia, and birds, with the single exception of a
short sequence in the chicken genome with low homology for AI952931 (Tables 2 and S1).
The reason why the probe did not hybridize with DNA
from mammals in which we found homologous
sequences using comparative genomics analysis is due to
low homology and the short length of orthologous
sequences (Table 2).
We may conclude that Southern hybridyzation and comparative genomics data confirm the evolutionary novelty
of the sequences studied, i.e., their origins in mammals or
in primates.
The results of molecular phylogenetic analysis are in
accordance with Southern hybridization and comparative
genomics results. AA166653-homologous sequences are
present only in apes and macaques and have no homology with any sequences in other mammals. The most
archaic of the four species presented on the phylogenetic
tree in Fig. 1b is the macaque. We cannot find an
AA166653-specific sequence in primates before the divergence of old world monkeys and apes. Therefore, the origin of AA166653-specific sequences took place about 25
mya, during the divergence of macaques and apes.

to 7.8%. It was found that Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes have 1.2% ± 0.4% divergence; the divergence between Homo sapiens
and Callimico is 7.8% ± 1.2%.

AL040372-, AI792557- and AI952931-specific sequences
formed separate clusters on phylogenetic trees demonstrating high nucleotide sequence divergence (from 20%
to 35%) with related sequences in mammals (Fig. 1a,1c
and 1d). AL040372-homologous sequences were found
in lemurs – the most archaic members of the primate
group. Lemur sequences demonstrate lower divergence
from other primates (about 8%) than related sequences
from non-primate animals (20% and more). Phylogenetic
analysis has shown that lemur sequences belong to the
primate phylogenetic cluster. Other primates form a separate non-lemur subcluster in this phylogenetic cluster
(Fig. 1a).

PVT1, encoding for the Pvt1 oncogene homolog. The Pvt1
locus also is a common integration site for murine leukemia viruses on mouse chromosome 15 and is located
approximately 270 kb from c-myc. MLV proviruses integrated in the Pvt1 locus activate c-myc expression by longrange (up to-300 kb) cis-effects [6]. In the human genome,
the corresponding sequence is located on chromosome 8.
Therefore, an evolutionarily new tumor-specific sequence
with a high potential of oncogenicity is presented in the
mammalian lineage near Pvt1 locus. Obvious overexpression of AI792557-specific transcripts in human tumors
[3,4] could be explained by enhanced transcriptional
activity of the c-myc-regulating element.

AI792557-homologous sequences form a well-supported
monophyletic group in apes and old world monkeys.
These sequence homologs were found in the Ateles-Callimico group and were not present in older primates. The
divergence of the Ateles-Callimico group from old world
monkeys took place about 40 mya The cDNA of

The proportion of the mammalian genome which is transcribed is greater than usually realized [7,8]. It turns out
that large regions of the genome beyond the coding segments are transcribed, producing non-coding RNAs

duplications of AL040372- and AA166653-homologous
sequences in the human, chimpanzee, and macaque
genomes (Table 3) supports this interpretation.

There is a growing number of recent publications on noncoding RNAs and their possible functions [10-12]. But the
fact that certain RNAs have low coding potential may also
characterize them as evolving sequences. The concept of
evolution by gene duplication [13] involves understanding that the extra copy of the duplicated gene may accumulate mutations and acquire a new function. Before
acquisition of a new function, it may express RNA without
long open reading frames or with stop-codons and/or
frame-shift mutations interrupting open reading frames.
In the similar way, non-coding sequences could evolve
and eventually acquire a function and/or longer open
reading frames. The fact that we were able to demonstrate

The Alu-Y element was found in a AL040372-homologous sequence in Ateles and Callimico. The presence of the
Alu sequence in the genome may mediate DNA recombination, the creation of new exons, and the donation of
new regulatory elements [14]. It was found in our study
that part of the AL040372-homologous sequence in the
lemur genome has an extension with no similarity in
those of other primates (data not shown). In higher primates, this region demonstrates a homology with the
human genome.
Taken together, these data from Southern hybridization
experiments, molecular phylogenetic studies, and compu-

tational evidence suggest that AA166653-, AL040372-,
AI792557- and AI952931-homologous sequences are
indeed evolutionarily new. They originate in mammals
(AA166653 – in primates) and form phylogenetic clusters
in primates. They are not expressed in normal cells [3,4],
i.e., they are sleeping.
Earlier [1,2], we formulated the concept of the positive
evolutionary role of tumors. According to this concept,
tumors provide conditions for the expression of evolutionarily new and/or sleeping genes in their cells. As evolutionary new genes we defined genes which participate in
the origin of new cell types [2]. New cell type origin is very
rare event which is associated with progressive evolution.
During 109 years of multicellular organisms evolution
only about 200 specialized cell types have been originated
[2]. Thus, within the framework of our hypothesis
sequences originated in mammalas may be well considered as evolutionary new.
We may guess that during the earliest period of the origin
of mammals, genome evolution and cellular proliferative
tumor-like processes provided material for the origin of
diversity of mammalian cell and tissue types by generating
a diversity of new gene expression patterns. Populations
of tumor-bearing animals could be ancestors of the first
mammals. Present-day tumors (at the earlier stages of progression) may somehow recapitulate these processes.

Conclusion
Our data presented in this and previous articles [3,4] demonstrate the expression of relatively evolutionarily new (in
respect to progressive evolution) and/or sleeping
sequences in tumor cells and support the concept of the
possible evolutionary role of tumors as a proving ground
or evolutionary reservoir of expression. If proven to be
correct, this concept may substantially increase our capabilities in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. This concept may also describe one of the mechanisms of
progressive evolution of animal species in which tumors
participate.

Methods
Genomic DNA
Human, ape (Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, Hylobates concolor), old world monkey (Erythrocebus patas, Macaca mulatta, Colobus guereza,
Cercopithecus aethiops), and new world monkey (Callimico goeldii, Lemur catta, Ateles fusciceps) genomic
DNAs were used in the study. All samples except human
DNA were kindly provided by Dr. S. O'Brien (Chief, Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, National Cancer Institute).
The DNA concentration of each sample was brought to
200 ng/µl before being used.

PCR analysis
Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were designed with OLIGONEW software after alignment of human EST
sequences and the corresponding regions of the human
genome. We performed BLAST searches for all primer
pairs created. Only PCR primers that corresponded to a
unique location in the human genome and to an EST cluster of interest were used.

Primers for AA166653: 5'-TCTTTCTTGATGAATTATCTTATG-3' and 5'-ACACACCCTCATTCCCGC-3'; the
expected fragment size is 443 bp. Primers for AL040372:
5'-GTCAACCTTCTCATCTTCCTC-3' and 5'-CAGGAAGTTGGGTAGATGTG-3'; the expected fragment sizes are 412
bp on cDNA and 1084 bp on genomic DNA. Primers for
AI952931: 5'-TAATTGCATTCTTCAAAATTCTAC-3' and 5'CTTCGCACCATTGAATAAAC-3'; the expected fragment
size is 315 bp. Primers for AI792557: 5'-TACATAGTTGTTATCTTAAGGTG-3' and 5'-TGGGAATTCTATACTTTTGAC-3'; the expected fragment size is 344 bp. Histone H4
control primers: 5'-ATGTCTGGCCGTGGTAAAGG-3' and
5'-CCGAAGCCGTAAAGAGTGCG-3'; the expected fragment size is 300 bp.
The PCR mixture contained 500 ng of genomic DNA as
template, PCR buffer (1), MgC12 (4 mM), dNTP (each at
200 µM), specific forward and reverse primers (each at 0.2
µM), and Taq DNA Polymerase (1 u) in a total volume of
25 µl (all reagents were supplied by Fermentas, Lithuania).
PCR was carried out under the following conditions: 1
min at 95°C, 35 cycles each consisting of 30 s at 95°C and
30 s at 56°C for AA166653 primers and histone H4 primers or at 58°C for all other primers, and 1 min at 72°C. At
the final stage of the PCR reaction, mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 72°C to elongate the DNA fragments
synthesized. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with
ethidium bromide.
Southern hybridization
DNA samples were digested with HindIII (10 U per µg of
DNA) for 16 h at 37°C. Digested DNA (8 µg per lane) was
electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gel overnight at 25 V/cm.
Gels were stained with ethidium bromide to assess loading and blotted onto a nylon membrane, Hybond-N
(Amersham, USA), according to the manufacturer's
instructions.

PCR products specific for genes of interest were labeled
with [α-32P]dCTP using the HexaLabel DNA Labeling Kit
(Fermentas, Lithuania) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Filter prehybridization and hybridization
were carried out according to the standard procedure [15].

Washing conditions were as follows: two times in 0.25 M
sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 5% SDS for 30–60 min at
65°C and two times in 0.125 M sodium phosphate (pH
7.2), 1% SDS for 30–60 min at 65°C (medium stringency) or two times in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH
7.2), 1% SDS for 30–60 min at 65°C (high stringency). Xray films were exposed to the blots for 3 days at -70°C
with an intensifying screen.
Cloning and sequencing
Amplified fragments were cloned by standard techniques
using the bacterial plasmid vector pGEM-T Easy
(Promega, USA). Colonies of recombinant DH10B/R E.
coli cells obtained by electrotransformation were selected.
We subjected recombinant plasmids to restriction endonuclease analysis and isolated those with fragments of
interest using the Wizard Minipreps Plasmid DNA Purification System (Promega, USA). Multiple clone sequencing was performed for each amplicon.

Sequencing was carried out by the Sanger method using
the AutoCycle Sequencing Kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) and standard Cy5-labeled primers T7, whose binding sites flank the cloning site of recombinant fragment.
We analyzed the products of the sequence reaction with
an automated sequencer, ALFexpress (Pharmacia Biotech,
Sweden), using the ALFwin v. 1.10 software package
(Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden).
Molecular phylogenetic analysis
PCR amplified fragments of primate DNA were cloned as
described above. A plasmid collection from each primate
was created. In total, 86 clones containing sequences of
interest were obtained. For each fragment, at least two
clones were sequenced in forward and reverse directions
in order to exclude PCR and sequencing errors. The
BioEdit software was used to generate sequence alignments. The alignments consist of the following numbers
of phylogenetically informative sites: 412 for the
AL040372 fragment, 443 for the AA166653 fragment, 315
for the AI952931 fragment, and 344 for the AI792557
fragment. We constructed phylogenetic trees using the
neighbor-joining method. Distance-based reconstructions and parsimony reconstructions based on the optimal alignments gave qualitatively similar phylogenetic
results, with the same major clades and topological differences in nodes. The results of phylogenetic analysis are
presented in Fig. 1.

Sequencing data were analyzed with the DNASIS v. 2.5
software (Hitachi Software Engineering, USA). We carried
out alignments using the BioEdit software and excluded
gap-containing sites. Phylogenetic trees were built according to the neighbor-joining method using the Kimura distances by the DNADIST and NEIGHBOR modules of the
PHYLIP software package and PHYLIP v.3.57c [16],
respectively. The reliability of the tree topology was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1750-9378/1/8

assessed by bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates (the SEQBOOT and CONSENCE modules of the PHYLIP). The tree
was drawn with Tree View software.
Identification of gene duplications and comparative
genomics analysis
BLAT searches among primate genome nucleotide
sequences were conducted to reveal duplications of
sequences under analysis. Matches with a level of identity
greater than or equal to 80% of maximum for each
sequence were taken as duplications.

The cross-species chained alignments database integrated
in the Genome Browser tool was used to search for orthologous sequences in fugu, tetraodon, zebrafish, frog,
chicken, rat, mouse, cow, dog, macaque, and chimpanzee
genomes [17].
