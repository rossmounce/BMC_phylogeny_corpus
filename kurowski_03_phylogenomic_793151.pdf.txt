Abstract
Background: Combination of biochemical and bioinformatic analyses led to the discovery of
oxidative demethylation – a novel DNA repair mechanism catalyzed by the Escherichia coli AlkB
protein and its two human homologs, hABH2 and hABH3. This discovery was based on the
prediction made by Aravind and Koonin that AlkB is a member of the 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenase
superfamily.
Results: In this article, we report identification and sequence analysis of five human members of
the (2OG-Fe2+) oxygenase superfamily designated here as hABH4 through hABH8. These
experimentally uncharacterized and poorly annotated genes were not associated with the AlkB
family in any database, but are predicted here to be phylogenetically and functionally related to the
AlkB family (and specifically to the lineage that groups together hABH2 and hABH3) rather than to
any other oxygenase family. Our analysis reveals the history of ABH gene duplications in the
evolution of vertebrate genomes.
Conclusions: We hypothesize that hABH 4–8 could either be back-up enzymes for hABH1-3 or
may code for novel DNA or RNA repair activities. For example, enzymes that can dealkylate N3methylpurines or N7-methylpurines in DNA have not been described. Our analysis will guide
experimental confirmation of these novel human putative DNA repair enzymes.

Background
The 2-oxoglutarate-Fe2+-depedent (2OG-Fe2+) oxygenase
superfamily groups together enzymes that catalyze a variety of reactions that typically involve oxidation of an
organic substrate using a di-oxygen molecule [1]. Among
them are proteins implicated in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine side chains in collagen, the synthesis of

plant hormones, pigments and flavones, enzymes catalyzing the reaction of oxidative ring expansion in biosynthesis of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics,
proteoglycans associated with basement membrane in
chordates (leprecan and its homologs). X-ray crystallographic studies of isopenicillin N synthase revealed a variant of the "jelly-roll" fold and provided insight into the

architecture of the conserved active site and the catalytic
mechanism of 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenases [2].
Using the protein fold-recognition method (a bioinformatic approach for determination if the sequence of interest is related to known protein structures) Aravind and
Koonin found that the Escherichia coli AlkB protein implicated in DNA repair is also a member of the 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenase superfamily [3]. They proposed that AlkB may
catalyze oxidative demethylation of alkylated bases in
DNA, while the eukaryotic homologs of AlkB maybe
involved in RNA demethylation. In accordance with this
prediction, it was demonstrated experimentally that bacterial AlkB carries out the oxidative demethylation of N1methyladenine (m1A) or N3-methylcytosine (m3C)
lesions in single-stranded and double-stranded DNA; the
reaction requires non-heme Fe2+, O2, and α-ketoglutarate
and yields succinate, CO2 and formaldehyde and the restoration of unalkylated bases in DNA [4,5]. To date, three
human homologs of AlkB have been reported, hABH1,
hABH2 and hABH3. Although hABH1 was initially
reported by one group to partially complement the sensitivity of an E. coli alkB mutant towards an alkylating agent
[6], this result could not be reproduced by others [7].
hABH2 and hABH3 remove m1A, m3C and 1-ethyladenine from alkylated polynucleotides in an α-ketoglutarate
dependent reaction [7]. Interestingly, bacterial AlkB and
hABH3 (but not hABH2) were shown to prefer singlestranded nucleic acids and to repair lesions in RNA [8].
The availability of several completed eukaryotic genome
sequences [9-13] allowed us to carry out large-scale
searches for novel members of previously identified protein families and to perform "phylogenomic" analyses, i.e.
functional predictions via phylogenetic analysis. The
premise of phylogenomics [14] is that only the analyses
carried out for complete sets of proteins obtained from
whole genomes allow to make accurate inferences of the
duplication/speciation
patterns,
identification
of
orthologs and paralogs, and mapping on known functions onto the evolutionary tree [15,16]. Thereby, functions of uncharacterized genes can be predicted by their
phylogenetic position relative to the characterized ones,
and by analyzing the rates and patterns of gene evolution
(reviews: [14,17,18]. Previous analyses of AlkB and its
homologs utilized databases of a smaller size (less complete genomes and less correctly predicted genes in the
human genome) that did not allow comprehensive comparisons of the eukaryotic protein families on the
genome/proteome scale. This prompted us to carry out a
genome-wide search for novel eukaryotic members of the
(2OG-Fe2+) oxygenase superfamily (with a special focus
on potential new close homologs of AlkB) and to carry
out the evolutionary analysis to predict their molecular
function.

Results
We have identified 24 members of the 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenase superfamily in the human genome, including 19 previously known members (according to the annotation in
the Ensembl database [19]) and 5 novel ones (see Methods for details). According to the phylogenomic analysis,
8 of these 24 human oxygenases grouped together with
the AlkB lineage. This group of proteins included previously reported hABH1, hABH2, and hABH3, three proteins annotated only as oxygenase homologs and two
proteins which have not been functionally annotated to
date. We propose to name these 5 novel putative AlkB
family members as ABHs (AlkB homologs) numbered 4
through 8 (Fig. 1). We also were able to find a number of
orthologs of the newly identified ABHs in other fully
sequenced metazoan genomes (Table 1) and in the EST
division of the GenBank database (data not shown, links
between the individual genes/contigs/transcripts are available via the Ensembl website using the gene identifiers
provided in Table 1).
To substantiate the hypothesis that the new hABHs are
genuine members of the 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenase superfamily, we have confirmed their structural relationship to
the jelly-roll fold by secondary structure prediction and
protein fold-recognition i.e. the same techniques that contributed to the original identification of AlkB as a member
of the 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenase superfamily [3]. All protein
structure analyses were carried out via the GeneSilico protein structure prediction meta server interface [20]. The
consensus pattern of secondary structures predicted for all
ABHs (Fig. 1) agrees very well with that observed in the
known crystal structures of genuine β-helix oxygenases
(see the "clavaminate synthase-like" superfamily in the
SCOP database [21]). The protein fold-recognition analysis has also corroborated our prediction: according to the
FFAS 03 algorithm [22], the sequences of all ABHs are
compatible with the structures of 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenases
(such as 1mze, 1gp4, 1bk0 in the Protein Data Bank) as
well as other proteins that exhibit the same doublestranded β-helix fold (such as 1lr5 or 2arc). This compatibility has statistically significant value (FFAS score lower
than -9.00). Taken together, these results can be regarded
as strong indication that all five novel ABHs (4–8) are
indeed true members of the 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenase
superfamily.
In order to find whether the new human ABHs belong to
the AlkB family (and are likely to be genuine "dealkylases"
involved in nucleic acid repair) or to some other 2OGFe2+ oxygenase family, phylogenetic analysis was carried
out and the multiple sequence alignment of ABHs (Fig. 1)
was scrutinized for the presence of conserved residues and
other features characteristic for AlkB. We found that all
hABHs exhibit the catalytic residues (HxD...H...RxxxxxR)

predicted for the AlkB family [3]. It is remarkable that all
these proteins share the conserved Arg residue in the Cterminal β-strand (R210 in E. coli AlkB), which was found
to be characteristic of the AlkB family and not found in the
other 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenases. The latter enzymes typically
have a bulky aromatic side chain at this position [3].
Furthermore, in the phylogenetic tree of the 2OG-Fe2+
oxygenase superfamily all ABHs cluster together with the
known AlkB family members from Prokaryota and
Eukaryota with strong bootstrap support (>90%; data not
shown). Interestingly, the novel ABHs (ABHs 4–8) were
found to be more closely related to the hABH2/hABH3
lineage described previously [3] rather than to the lineage
comprising E. coli AlkB and the ABH1 protein (Fig. 2).
This result suggests that eukaryotic ABHs 2–8 have a relatively recent common origin and that they have most
likely radiated by a series of duplication events in the
metazoan lineage. Our analysis shows that all eight
hABHs have orthologs in vertebrate genomes, while the
number of ABHs in the genomes of C. elegans and D. melanogaster is more limited. According to the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, ABH2&3, ABH5&7 and
ABH4&6&8 are in-paralogous (i.e. originated by duplication following the radiation of the main ABH lineages.
The mouse orthologs of hABH5, hABH6, and hABH7 are
within known regions of human-mouse synteny. The
hABH5 gene maps to the 17p11 locus and hABH6 and
hABH7 map to the 19th chromosome (loci 19q13 and
19p13, respectively). On the other hand, the hABH4 gene
is found outside the region of human-mouse chromosome synteny. It maps to the locus 7q22. There are two
separate transcripts in the Ensembl database for the
hABH8 gene (locus 11p11), seemingly corresponding to
two protein domains, namely the RRM domain, typically
found in RNA-binding proteins and the the oxygenase
domain homologus to AlkB. However, in the hABH8
orthologs from other metazoan genomes (including C.
elegans and D. melanogaster) these two domains are found
fused together to form a single polypeptide. The fusion of
the AlkB-like domain with an RNA-binding domain suggests that the ABH8 protein, like previously found for
hABH3, may be involved in repair of alkylation damage in
RNA. Whether the human hABH8 protein is formed by
two independently expressed domains or is encoded by a
single polypeptide like it orthologs, remains to be determined experimentally.

Conclusions
Based on the phylogenomic considerations supported by
structure prediction and identification of characteristic
conserved residues we predict that five so far uncharacterized human proteins are members of the AlkB family of
nucleic acid repair enzymes. hABH4, hABH5, and hABH6

have been annotated in Ensembl only as members of the
huge 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenase superfamily without any specification as to the possible substrate or biological function.
hABH7 and hABH8 have not been annotated as members
of the 2OG-Fe2+ oxygenase superfamily in any database at
the time of this analysis (August 2003). We hypothesize
that hABH 4–8 could either be back-up enzymes for
hABH1-3 or may code for novel DNA or RNA repair activities. For example, enzymes that can dealkylate N3-methylpurines or N7-methylpurines in DNA have not been
described. It is possible that some of the predicted ABHs
perform such demethylation reaction. Our prediction has
therefore a significant potential to facilitate the experimental analysis aimed at understanding the molecular
function of these proteins. However, it must be remembered that for hABH1 no activity could be reproducibly
demonstrated and some of the ABHs (4–8) reported in
this work may turn out to be inactive or may be difficult
to assay. Nonetheless, all ABHs have (at least partial)
counterparts in the characterized cDNA or EST databases
(Table 1) suggesting that they are all expressed in human
cells.

Methods
Our re-analysis of (2OG-Fe2+) oxygenases was initiated
with the sequence data obtained from the Pfam and the

Page 4 of 6

BMC Genomics 2003, 4

Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) databases
[23,24]. The Pfam database (release 9.0) contains 857
sequences from various species annotated as members of
the (2OG-Fe2+) oxygenase superfamily. We also used the
COG 3145 cluster with 23 prokaryotic members of the
AlkB subfamily. The multiple sequence alignments (MSA)
from PFAM (oxygenases) and COG (AlkB orthologs) were
converted to profiles and used to search for oxygenase/
AlkB homologs in the following genomic databases with
a variant of the RPS-BLAST program [25]: Homo sapiens
genome: NCBI assembly 33/ Ensembl 15.33.1; Mus
musculus genome: MGSC – NCBI assembly 30 / Ensembl
15.30.1; Takifugu rubripes genome: ICMB October 2001
release / Ensembl 15.2.1; Drosophila melanogaster genome:
Flybase 3.1; Caenorhabditis elegans genome: Wormbase
102. The RefSeq format and identifiers were used to annotate the sequences.
All bona fide oxygenases/AlkB orthologs and their
homologs identified in the genomic databases were
aligned using HMMER [26] and subjected to the evolutionary analysis using the SDI/RIO software package
[15,16]. Briefly, a maximum likelihood (ML) tree of the
bona fide members of the superfamily (sequences from
PFAM and COG) was built using Tree-Puzzle [27]. Each
newly identified putative oxygenase/AlkB homolog was
separately aligned to the genuine oxygenases and its position on the superfamily tree (as well as the statistical support for this position) was determined. The SDI algorithm
was used to identify the type of evolutionary relationships
(orthology/paralogy) between the tested sequence and
the subfamilies of genuine oxygenases, using the
established evolutionary tree of species [28] as the reference. Consequently, for each oxygenase candidate it was
predicted whether it could have evolved from the known
superfamily members by speciation or duplication and
what would be the relative timing of its radiation compared to the radiation of other members.
The final evolutionary tree of the oxygenase superfamily
was computed using the fast neighbor-joining (NJ)
approach [29] (for all sequences analyzed) and the computationally expensive maximum likelihood (ML)
approach [30](for the selected members of each major
lineage, including all hABHs). The topologies of major
branches of both trees were virtually identical, therefore
only the ML tree is shown, for the clarity of the presentation. The final phylogenetic tree was obtained following
using the "approximately unbiased" and ShimodairaHasegawa tests [31,32].
