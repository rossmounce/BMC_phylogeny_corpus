Phosphorylation site database

Abstract
PHOSIDA http://www.phosida.com, a phosphorylation site database, integrates thousands of highconfidence in vivo phosphosites identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics in various
species. For each phosphosite, PHOSIDA lists matching kinase motifs, predicted secondary
structures, conservation patterns, and its dynamic regulation upon stimulus. Using support vector
machines, PHOSIDA also predicts phosphosites.

Rationale

Protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous and important posttranslational modification, responsible for modulating protein function, localization, interaction and stability [1-4].
High-throughput experimental studies such as our recent
large scale analysis of the human phosphoproteome by quantitative mass spectrometry, in which we measured the time
courses of more than 6,600 phosphorylation sites in response
to growth factor stimulation [5], enable us to study biological
systems from a global perspective. Those sites were identified
by high resolution mass spectrometry with an estimated false
positive rate of less than one percent and constitute an unbiased, in-depth sampling of the in vivo phosphoproteome. In
addition, PHOSIDA includes large-scale phosphoproteomes
from various eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, such as
Bacillus subtilis [6] and Escherichia coli, providing information about the evolution of phosphorylation events in the cell.

We developed PHOSIDA to retrieve and analyze phosphosites from large-scale and high-confidence quantitative
phosphoproteomics experiments, usually studying the
response of biological systems to various stimuli by the integration of time course data. Thus, it is the first phosphosite
database to explicitly store quantitative data on the relative
level of phosphorylation. PHOSIDA also matches kinase
motifs to phosphosites. A challenge in mass spectrometrybased phosphosite mapping is the fact that phosphopeptides
are measured, which then need to be mapped to one or more
corresponding protein sequences. This problem is addressed
in PHOSIDA by a many-to-many mapping between phosphopeptide sequences and protein entries in the sequence
database. One of the fundamental strengths of PHOSIDA lies
in the high quality of the in vivo data contained in the database and in the very large size of its in vivo data sets.

In this paper we describe the features and capabilities of
PHOSIDA. We also use the analysis tools in PHOSIDA to
investigate the structure and evolution of the phosphoproteome from a global point of view. Recent studies have found
support for the hypothesis that protein phosphorylation
occurs predominantly within regions without regular structure [7,8]. This was also the conclusion of a recent paper
describing MitoCheck (mtcPTM) [9], a recently established
database containing phosphorylation sites of human and
mouse. These authors used known structures and homology
modeling to determine the structural constraints of phosphorylation sites. Here we investigate and quantify this observation on a very large in vivo dataset. The resulting secondary
structure and accessibility information for each phosphosite
is available in PHOSIDA.

ments are based on the IPI database [14], which is cross-referenced with the Swissprot database by PHOSIDA. Entries of
both databases that correspond to the same proteins were
aligned to derive the exact positions of protein features such
as domains, active sites, motifs, and binding sites. Already
annotated phosphosites derived from Swissprot are transferred to the IPI sequences in the same way. The aligned
regions can be visualized via 'check alignment' buttons. Phosphoproteome data generated by the community will be regularly imported into PHOSIDA in this way rather than by
individual import of specific projects. PHOSIDA will be
updated with sites identified according to Swissprot every 6
months at the least or as soon as substantial new large-scale
studies on phosphorylation are included in Swissprot. In the
case of prokaryotic phosphorylation sites, the protein assignment was exclusively based on the TIGR database.

Although conservation of specific sites is often taken to imply
biological importance, relatively little is known about the evolutionary constraints on the phosphoproteome. We investigated these constraints on three levels: conservation of
phosphoproteins, regions surrounding the site and the phosphosite itself. Consequently, PHOSIDA provides the evolutionary conservation of each phosphosite at these three levels.
In addition, we took advantage of the large number of in vivo
phosphosites to create a phosphosite predictor in PHOSIDA.
There have been various machine learning approaches to predict phosphorylation sites. For example, the prediction system Netphos [10] is based on neural networks, whereas
Scansite uses a profile method to predict phosphorylation
events [11]. We use our large-scale studies to construct a
phosphorylation site predictor on the basis of a support vector machine (see [12] for an introduction). Support vector
machines (SVMs) have been applied to a large variety of fields
ranging from internet fraud to topics in molecular biology,
such as classification of gene expression profiles, and there
has already been one study that applied SVM techniques to
predict phosphorylation sites [13]. However, that approach
was exclusively based on the primary sequences of around
1,000 phosphorylation sites. Here we construct a predictor
based on more than 5,000 high confidence phosphosites. We
also show that information about the structure and conservation of phosphorylation sites slightly increases the performance of the predictor.
Furthermore, PHOSIDA can search for motifs of interest in
any input sequence. These motifs can be user generated or
drawn from already annotated kinase motifs.

Database management of phosphorylation sites

As mentioned above, PHOSIDA was first developed to facilitate retrieval and analysis of high-confidence phospho-datasets generated in our group. For example, PHOSIDA contains
a large number of phosphorylation sites from human cell
lines exposed to growth factor stimulation. Protein assign-

For each protein, the user is presented with general features
such as isoelectric point (pI), molecular weight, sequence,
and description at the protein level in addition to all phosphorylation sites that have been identified in our laboratory and
those that are extracted from Swissprot. Mass spectrometry
identifies phosphopeptides by matching fragmentation spectra to databases and we require 99% confidence for peptide
identification to list peptides in PHOSIDA. However, localization of phosphosites within the identified phosphorylated
peptides is sometimes ambiguous. We developed a probability score ('localization score') that reflects the chance of each
potential phosphorylation site within the peptide to be phosphorylated given its fragmentation spectrum [5]. If the localization probability is lower than 0.995, it is enclosed in round
brackets. When users click on any of the displayed phosphosites, the surrounding sequence and matching kinase
motifs are shown (Figure 1). Often, several phosphopeptides
covering the same phosphosite are measured by mass spectrometry. These peptides are also listed along with their localization probabilities, Mascot scores, and MSQuant scores for
each instance. In many cases, for example, the growth factor
treatment mentioned above, PHOSIDA contains quantitative
and time-resolved data for the relative abundance of each
phosphopeptide. Figure 1 shows how the corresponding
ratios or clustered time courses are represented. These data
are listed separately for peptides as a function of their
sequences, degrees of phosphorylation, and further categories, such as experimental design or fraction. When moving
the mouse over the 'occurrences' button, protein entries sharing the same phosphopeptide of interest are listed along with
the number of unique peptides that have been measured in
one experimental assay. Each peptide is color coded according to the protein assignment: if the peptide sequence is
marked in green, the selected protein has the maximum
number of peptides in comparison to all other proteins that
contain the same peptide. If the protein assignment is ambiguous because of another protein with the same number of
identified peptides, the peptide is highlighted in blue. Red
indicates that other proteins exceed the number of detected

relative accessibility prediction assigns a value between 0 (fully buried) and

non-phosphorylated counterparts in the same proteins.

of each phosphorylation site are visualized in PHOSIDA. To
determine the overall accessibility at the protein level, we
compared 1,044 human phosphoproteins that had an exact
match in Swissprot with a set of 998 human random proteins
from Swissprot. This was done to avoid bias due to redundant
entries in IPI. We find that phosphoproteins as a group have
significantly higher accessibilities than a set of randomly
selected proteins (t-test, Ï = 0; Additional data file 1). This
means that all residues that occur in phosphoproteins show a
higher accessibility on average than all residues in non-phosphorylated proteins. Phosphoproteins, on average, are longer
than the average of the database; thus, this effect is not caused
by a smaller surface to volume ratio. A global analysis on the
human set, which contains 5,849 sites for which the localization was unambiguous (class I sites), showed that the accessibilities of phosphoserine (pS: t-test, Ït = 2 Ã 10-111; MannWhitney test, ÏMW = 4 Ã 10-103), phosphothreonine (pT: Ït = 1
Ã 10-21, ÏMW = 3 Ã 10-21), and phosphotyrosine (pY: Ït = 1 Ã 10-4
4, Ï
MW = 3 Ã 10 ) are significantly higher than non-phosphorylated serines, threonines or tyrosines (Figure 2). Non-phosphorylated residues were taken from phosphoproteins. Thus,
accessibility of phosphoresidues does not only follow from
the hydrophilicity of the amino acid but appears to be a requisite for efficient phosphorylation. This finding also correlates with the much higher frequency of pS and pT (80% and
18%, respectively) compared to pY (2%) [5]. Tyrosine is more
hydrophobic than serine and threonine and, therefore, tends
to be located in less accessible parts of the protein.
The high accessibility of phosphorylation sites suggests that
they are largely localized in hinges and loops, since these
structural elements are at the protein surface. In fact, this is
the case to a striking degree for pS (93.0%) as well as for pT
(88.5%). pY (67.3%) is also predominantly found in these
regions. Again, this pattern is not caused by the residues'
hydrophobicities alone as phosphoresidues have a significantly higher tendency to be located in these regions (Ï2 test:
p = 0 (pS), p = 0 (pT), p = 5 Ã 10-6 (pY); Figure 3). It is well
known that loop regions frequently participate in forming
binding sites and active sites of enzymes, making them excellent substrates for regulation.

structure [7,8]. To verify this observation on the basis of our
large-scale studies and to enable users to investigate the
structural context of each phosphorylation site of interest, we
performed large-scale solvent accessibility calculation as well
as secondary structure prediction employing the SABLE 2.0
program [15]. As shown in Figure 1, the structural attributes

We next wanted to confirm the generality of this observation
for phosphoproteins with a solved structure and determined
proteins from our human phosphoset that had a structure in
the Protein Data Bank [16] and mapped our in vivo phosphorylation sites to their three-dimensional coordinates.
Secondary structures were assigned by DSSP [17]. DSSP is a
program that assigns secondary structures to given threedimensional coordinates of atoms of proteins. In total, we
assigned 26 phosphogroups to 16 structures of different proteins (Additional data file 2). As is apparent from the
structures, the phosphogroups are always located in highly
accessible parts of the proteins. Furthermore, in all but one
case the phosphogroups are found in flexible parts of the
structure (hinges or loops). In 12 cases the structure around

the phosphosite was so flexible that it had not been determined at all (Additional data file 3).

Evolutionary conservation of the
phosphoproteome

We next wished to integrate another dimension of biological
information of the phosphoproteome into PHOSIDA, namely
its evolutionary conservation. We determined homologous
proteins to all phosphoproteins across 70 species from E. coli
to mouse via BLASTP [18]. The homology search was performed against protein databases of 53 bacteria, nine
archaea, and eight eukaryotes. These databases were
retrieved from Swissprot [19] in the case of Archaea and Bacteria. The yeast proteome was downloaded from SGD [20],
Drosophila melanogaster from FlyBase [21] and the other
eukaryotic sequences from IPI. We defined proteins to be
homologous when the resulting E-values were lower than 105. For homologous proteins, we used a bidirectional BLASTP
approach to distinguish between paralogs and orthologs [22].
PHOSIDA displays the results of the homology searches using
an approximate phylogeny of all investigated species. Taxonomic divisions are displayed on-screen when the cursor is
pointed at the phylogenetic tree. If the selected phosphoprotein is not homologous to any protein of a certain organism,
that organism is highlighted in red. If the similarity between
the sequence of the phosphoprotein and its homologous protein was the significantly best one in both directions, the
given organism is highlighted in green. A higher similarity
between the sequence of the homologous protein and another

We explored the conservation of the identified human phosphoproteome using the dataset of more than 2,200 phosphoproteins from [5]. We investigated phosphoproteins that had
an exact sequence match in the Swissprot database (version
48.0). This resulted in a set of 1,044 human phosphoproteins.
As shown in Figure 4, phosphorylated proteins have a higher
proportion of two-directionally conserved interspecific
homologs (Ï2 test, p = 0) in comparison to the entire human
proteome (complete human Swissprot database), presumably
reflecting conserved regulatory functions. For example, in the
case of Danio rerio alignments, we observed that 62.78% of
all human proteins had orthologs in comparison to 84.11% of
the phospho set.
Additionally, we created global alignments between each
phosphoprotein and its corresponding interspecific homolog
via the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [23,24]. Since the
length of alignments presents a further criterion for homology besides bi-directional significance via BLAST, users are
able to check the global alignments along with the proportions of identities and to estimate the degree of homology by
themselves. If users click on any green or blue 'species button', the corresponding global alignment appears at the bottom of the page (Figure 5).
With global alignments in hand, PHOSIDA directly tests
phosphosite and kinase motif conservation. In the evolutionary section of PHOSIDA, all phosphorylation sites that have
been measured in our laboratory are listed on the right side.
If users click on a phosphorylation site of interest, the conservation status of the selected phosphorylation site is indicated
in red or green (Figure 6). Green points to conservation. For
conserved phosphosites, the alignment of the surrounding
sequence is displayed. Very seldom, sections of the alignments cause gaps in the sequence of the selected short region
of the phosphoprotein; in this case these gaps are not displayed. With alignments between the phosphorylation site of
interest and protein sequences from 70 organisms, PHOSIDA
enables users to check the conservation of each site of each
protein of interest. Furthermore, the conservation of matching motifs can immediately be checked as shown in Figure 6.
This enables the user to distinguish conserved motifs around
the phosphosite from other motifs that also match the phosphosite but are not conserved and may thus be less likely to be
functionally important or have appeared only recently in
evolution.
On the basis of these global alignments for orthologous phosphoproteins, we found that regions containing phosphorylation sites showed lower conservation than the average
conservation of the entire protein. As seen in Additional data
file 4, the average identity in the 40 amino acid window
surrounding the aligned phosphorylation sites is lower for

due to their almost exclusive location in fast evolving loop and
hinge regions.

These data suggest that the surrounding sequence regions
may diverge to such an extent that the structural effect (fast
sequence evolution) could compete with the constraining
pressure of function (slow sequence evolution). In order to

correctly assess the degree of conservation of phosphosites, it
is therefore important to take the structural effect - fast
evolution of loop regions - into account. We did this by choosing only sites located in loop regions for the comparison set,
which should isolate the functional, evolutionary constraints
on the phosphosite itself.
The overall conservation of phosphorylation sites in orthologous eukaryotic proteins, based on the Needlemann-Wunsch
alignments, is shown in Figures 7, 8, 9, 10. The average amino
acid identity for all phosphoproteins with orthologs ranges
from greater than 80% in mammals to about 25% in yeast
(Figure 7). Figure 8 compares the conservation of phosphoserines that occur in loops with all non-phosphoserines that
occur in loops in the same proteins. In all vertebrates, phosphoserine is significantly more conserved than serine (p = 0).

both forms. In more distantly related species the numbers are small and
differences are not statistically significant.

In Drosophila the effect is still observable, but is not significant (p = 0.33). In yeast this is not the case. However, because
the sequence identity is already relatively high, the absolute
values of phosphoserine conservation are not much higher
than those of other serines. For example, compared to mice,
87.77 % of the phosphosites are conserved in orthologous
proteins, but 81.16% of all serines in loop regions of phosphoproteins are also conserved. Threonine yields a similar result
to serine, but this amino acid is generally less conserved than
serine (Figure 9). Tyrosine tends to occur in more conserved
regions of the protein as mentioned above. Therefore, conservation of all tyrosines in mouse is very high at 89.3% (Figure
10). However, the higher conservation of phosphorylated
tyrosines is still evident, but is not significant due to their low
number.

in each direction show elevated sequence identity.

What do these findings mean for the conservation of phosphorylation motifs? We plotted the conservation of amino
acids amino- and carboxy-terminal to the phosphorylation
site for the three phosphorylation sites and for all species. As
a typical example, Figure 11 shows the case of serine and
threonine in zebrafish (D. rerio). The figure reveals a sym-

metric region immediately adjacent to the phosphosite, in
which conservation is higher than in the surrounding region.
The length of this region is about -5 to +5 amino acids for both
serine and threonine and agrees well with the size of published phosphorylation motifs. Thus, in the evolutionary section of PHOSIDA, the surrounding region of -6 to +6 amino

motifs. For phosphotyrosine the picture was less clear, perhaps because of the limited number of sites in the data set.

Prediction of phosphorylation sites using
support vector machines

We then used the results of this large-scale study to construct
a phosphorylation site predictor on the basis of a SVM. As
shown above, phosphoserines, phosphothreonines and
phosphotyrosines show the same general patterns relating to
protein structure and conservation, but each to a different
extent. Therefore, we applied the machine learning approach
separately to the 4,731 pS, 664 pT and 107 pY sites. To create
a negative set of the same size, we randomly chose sites from
human proteins that were not present in the phosphoset. The

positive and negative datasets were split into a training set
(90%) and a test set (10%). SVMs attempt to partition true
from false sites by separating them in a high dimensional vector space with the help of hyperplanes and kernel functions. A
few sites out of the negative set may turn out to be phosphorylation sites in future experiments. This problem was
addressed by optimizing the 'C parameter' of the SVM, which
controls the softness of the margin. We optimized the parameters C and Ï by varying them from 2-10 to 210 in multiplicative
steps of two and chose the best combination of both parameters out of the 21 Ã 21 possibilities. The optimization was
based on a five-fold cross validation on the training set. To
determine the importance of each feature in the accuracy of
phosphosite prediction, we created various sets, which contain different information for each phosphosite (Figure 12):
set a, the primary sequence comprising the site and its 12 sur-

from 66.67% to 76.19% when including the structural and
conservational information. However, that increase is not
significant due to the fact that there were only around 100
phosphotyrosines sites.
The recall reflects the proportion of true positives to the sum
of true positives and false negatives, whereas the precision
describes the number of true positives out of all predicted
positives. As outlined in Figure 13, the precision-recall curve
of set e is slightly better than that of set a, indicating that the
inclusion of evolutionary and structural information
increased the recall and precision of the prediction to a minor
degree.

surrounding primary sequence and the predicted accessibility
in addition to the secondary structure of the site; set d, the
surrounding primary sequence, the conservation of the phosphosite in mammals and the protein conservation in yeast,
fly, zebrafish, chicken, cow, rat and mouse; and set e, the surrounding primary sequence, the accessibility of the phosphosite and secondary structure as well as its conservation in
mammals, and the protein conservation. This resulted in 260
to 274 dimensions that represent the features of each
phosphosite.

PHOSIDA includes the prediction of phosphorylated serines
and threonines on any input sequence on the basis of the
SVM, which was trained on the basis of raw sequences. Users
can set a certain cutoff directly on the precision-recall-curve
for the prediction. Sites that are predicted to be phosphorylated are automatically matched to annotated kinase motifs.
In addition to the prediction, we also integrated a simple tool
that searches for matching kinase motifs on any sequence of
interest. Alternatively, users can define their own motif and
derive matching sites of the given sequence.

Outlook and conclusion

We investigated several common kernel functions and found
that the radial basis function (RBF) turned out to be the most
powerful compared to linear, polynomial and sigmoid Kernel
functions. We optimized parameters C and Ï, the width of the
Gaussians used as the RBFs, and trained the optimal model
for each set of each phosphor amino acid separately (Additional data file 5).

The concept of a phosphorylation site database is, of course,
not a novel one. PhosphoSite [25] and Phospho.ELM [26] are
already comprehensive databases that contain phosphorylation sites from different projects. The aim of PHOSIDA is to
include very high quality input data as well as quantitative
information such as regulation after stimuli. Additionally, we
take into account structures and evolutionary data across a
variety of species, in order to integrate biological context into
the database and to quantify constraints of phosphorylation
on a proteome-wide scale. Thus, PHOSIDA provides a rich
environment to the biologist wishing to analyze phosphorylation events of proteins of interest.

We found that the accuracy of the prediction based on the primary sequence was already very high: in the case of phosphoserines, 89.85% were predicted correctly in the test set as
were 74.24% of the phosphothreonines (Additional data file
6). The accuracy of the prediction increased to 90.17% for pS
and 77.27% for pT by adding structural information (sets b
and c). For serines, the accessibility was slightly more important than the secondary structure information, whereas for
threonines, the opposite was the case. The additional dimensions reflecting the conservation of the site and of the entire
protein (set d) increased the accuracy to 90.70% (pS) and
81.06% (pT). By combining structural and evolutionary information (set e), we found that 91.75% in the serine set and
81.06% in the threonine set were predicted correctly. The
accuracy of the prediction of phosphotyrosines increased

Our analysis of a large and unbiased set of in vivo phosphorylation sites in human cells shows that phosphorylation
events are not distributed along the whole protein structure
but are instead constrained to sites of high accessibility and
structural flexibility. Particularly in the case of serine and
threonine, phosphorylation is almost completely restricted to
loops and hinges. Tyrosine is found to some degree in regular
secondary structure elements but phosphotyrosines are very
likely to be in flexible regions as well. Mechanistically, localization of phosphorylation in flexible regions of the protein is
advantageous as it provides access for the kinase to substrate,
which needs to be positioned into the active site. Furthermore, functional consequences of the phosphorylation in
many cases also depend on the flexibility of the phosphorylated sequence, such as when loops are repositioned after

phosphorylation or when the phosphorylated loop
participates in a protein-protein interaction. However, it is
important to emphasize that the structural analysis was based
on predictive methods rather than experimental data. Nevertheless, it stands to reason that the large size of the dataset
should compensate for statistical errors caused by the prediction algorithm. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the
Mitocheck database (mtcPTM) [9] also came to similar conclusions relating to structural constraints of phosphosites.
This is gratifying because those authors used a different set of
phosphorylation sites (gathered in the European Union consortium MitoCheck) and different methods to determine
preferential phosphorylation on different secondary
structure elements (homology modeling). The authors also
noted that phosphorylation sites can accumulate at the flanks
of structured domains and, in some cases, on buried residues.
Interestingly, phosphorylation of these sites could destabilize
part of the protein structure and, for example, allow or disallow protein-protein interactions [9].

defined by users. In addition, we constructed a SVM-based
prediction algorithm for phosphorylation. Training of the
SVM on our large-scale dataset led to excellent prediction
accuracy. We also showed that the inclusion of structural and
evolutionary constraints on the phosphoproteome could
slightly increase the performance of the predictor.

The concordant results on structural constraints of phosphorylation sites between the MitoCheck study and this study
also implicitly validate our use of the SABLE prediction tool
for secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction in
this context. Here we have used these predictions to extend
the feature space used in phosphorylation site prediction.
The analysis of the evolutionary sections of PHOSIDA shows
that the number of orthologs of the human phosphoproteome
is much higher than that of the entire human proteome, at
least when analyzing the phosphoproteins identified by Olsen
et al. [5]. This probably reflects important and conserved
functional roles of proteins with this post-translational modification. As a consequence of the location of phosphorylation
sites in loops and hinges, the sequence regions around
phosphorylation sites evolve faster than the rest of the protein. Practically, this leads to difficulties in correctly aligning
phosphosites in orthologous proteins, which can be overcome
by using a combination of fast, word-based algorithms
(BLASTP) to find candidates and exhaustive algorithms to
properly align phosphorylation sites (Needle).
Our analysis on the global alignments of orthologs in eukaryotes shows that phosphorylation sites are more conserved
than non-phosphosites of the same proteins. However, for
any given site the sequence identity is already very high, for
example, more than 70% for serine and threonine in mammals. For tyrosine, conservation is even higher. Therefore,
the mere conservation of a phosphorylation site in mammals
or in vertebrates does not necessarily indicate high selection
pressure. We found that a region of about five amino acids
around the phosphorylation site is more conserved than the
surrounding sequence context.
Furthermore, we integrated a tool that matches input
sequences with annotated kinase motifs or motifs that are

The PHOSIDA phosphorylation site predictor makes it possible to find putative novel phosphorylation sites that have not
(yet) been experimentally identified. While experimental
data, especially quantitative data, are the 'gold standard', predicting novel phosphosites and matching kinase motifs on
proteins of interest should be valuable for the design of biological experiments or for predicting a protein's role in a pathway [27]. Furthermore, once predictors are trained, these
prediction methods are basically 'free'. We provide an interactive method for setting a desired level of precision and
recall. For example, for mutagenesis experiments one may
want to set the precision very high, and for rationalizing the
function of a protein in a pathway one may want to set it relatively low. Thus, in the absence of experimental data, the
prediction of novel phosphosites can be taken as the first
method of an experimental design uncovering functionality of
any protein of interest and elucidating its involvement in certain signaling cascades.
The integration process and analysis pipeline have been automated, so that structural and conservation data for phosphorylation sites from prospective studies can readily be
incorporated into PHOSIDA. As new phosphorylation data
are integrated to PHOSIDA our SVM will also be updated,
leading to increasingly accurate predictions.
Upcoming projects will investigate the phosphoproteomes of
prokaryotes, such as E. coli and Lactococcus lactis, and the
dynamics of phosphorylation after various stimuli in B. subtilis and in eukaryotes such as D. melanogaster, mouse, and
human.
