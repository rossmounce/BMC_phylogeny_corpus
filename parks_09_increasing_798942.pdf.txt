Abstract
Background: Molecular evolutionary studies share the common goal of elucidating historical
relationships, and the common challenge of adequately sampling taxa and characters. Particularly at
low taxonomic levels, recent divergence, rapid radiations, and conservative genome evolution yield
limited sequence variation, and dense taxon sampling is often desirable. Recent advances in
massively parallel sequencing make it possible to rapidly obtain large amounts of sequence data, and
multiplexing makes extensive sampling of megabase sequences feasible. Is it possible to efficiently
apply massively parallel sequencing to increase phylogenetic resolution at low taxonomic levels?
Results: We reconstruct the infrageneric phylogeny of Pinus from 37 nearly-complete chloroplast
genomes (average 109 kilobases each of an approximately 120 kilobase genome) generated using
multiplexed massively parallel sequencing. 30/33 ingroup nodes resolved with ≥ 95% bootstrap
support; this is a substantial improvement relative to prior studies, and shows massively parallel
sequencing-based strategies can produce sufficient high quality sequence to reach support levels
originally proposed for the phylogenetic bootstrap. Resampling simulations show that at least the
entire plastome is necessary to fully resolve Pinus, particularly in rapidly radiating clades. Metaanalysis of 99 published infrageneric phylogenies shows that whole plastome analysis should provide
similar gains across a range of plant genera. A disproportionate amount of phylogenetic information
resides in two loci (ycf1, ycf2), highlighting their unusual evolutionary properties.
Conclusion: Plastome sequencing is now an efficient option for increasing phylogenetic resolution
at lower taxonomic levels in plant phylogenetic and population genetic analyses. With continuing
improvements in sequencing capacity, the strategies herein should revolutionize efforts requiring
dense taxon and character sampling, such as phylogeographic analyses and species-level DNA
barcoding.

Background
Molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses are
typically limited by DNA sequencing costs, and this forces
investigators to choose between dense taxon sampling
with a small number of maximally informative loci, or

genome-scale sampling across a sparse taxon sample [14]. Balancing these choices is particularly difficult in studies focused on recently diverged taxa or ancient rapid radiations, as taxon sampling needs to be sufficiently large to
define the magnitude of intraspecific variation and the

phylogenetic depth of shared alleles [5,6]. Similarly,
broad genome sampling is necessary to offset the low level
of genetic divergence among individuals of recent coancestry and to overcome low phylogenetic signal to noise
ratios characteristic of rapid radiations [6]. Next generation DNA sequencing is poised to bring the benefits of
affordable genome-scale data collection to such studies at
low taxonomic levels (genera, species, and populations).
Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) has increased per
instrument sequence output several orders of magnitude
relative to Sanger sequencing, with a proportional reduction in per-nucleotide sequencing costs [7,8]. In principle
this could allow the rapid sequencing of large numbers of
entire organellar genomes (chloroplast or mitochondria)
or nuclear loci, and result in greatly increased phylogenetic resolution [9]. To date, comparatively few plant or
animal evolutionary genetic analyses have utilized MPS
[10-12], due to associated costs and the technical challenge of assembling large contiguous sequences from
micro-reads. These barriers have been largely eliminated
through four innovations: development of strategies for
targeted isolation of large genomic regions [9,13-15]; harnessing the capacity of these platforms to sequence targeted regions in multiplex [9,14,16]; streamlining sample
preparation and improving throughput [17]; and developing accurate de novo assemblers that reduce reliance
upon a predefined reference sequence [18,19].
In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of MPS-based chloroplast phylogenomics for onethird of the world's pine species (Pinus), a lineage with
numerous unresolved relationships based on previous
cpDNA-based studies [20-22]. We also highlight the
broad applicability of our approach to other plant taxa,
and remark on the potential applications to similar mitochondrial-based studies in animals and plant DNA barcoding. Using multiplex MPS approaches, we sequenced
nearly-complete chloroplast genomes (120 kilobases (kb)
each total length) from 32 species in Pinus and four relatives in Pinaceae. Our sampling of Pinus includes both
subgenera (subg. Pinus, 14 accessions; subg. Strobus, 21
accessions) and species exemplars chosen from all 11 taxonomic subsections [21] to evenly cover the phylogenetic
diversity of the genus. Taxon density is highest for a chosen subsection (subsect. Strobus) as representative of a species-rich clade lacking phylogenetic resolution in previous
studies [5,21-23]. Three species are also represented by
two chloroplast genomes each (P. lambertiana, P. thunbergii, P. torreyana).

Results
Genomic Assemblies and Alignment
Assemblies in subgenus Strobus averaged 117 kb, with an
estimated 8.8% missing data (compared to P. koraiensis
reference); subg. Pinus assemblies averaged just less than

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/84

120 kb (6% estimated missing data, compared to P. thunbergii reference). Outgroup assemblies averaged just over
119 kb (10.4% average estimated missing data compared
to P. thunbergii reference). Median coverage depth for
determined positions was variable but typically high
(range 21 to 156×) (Table 1, [also see additional file 1]).
Full alignment of all assemblies was 132,715 bp in length,
including 62,298 bp from exons encoding 71 conserved
protein coding genes (20,638 amino acids), 36 tRNAs and
4 rRNAs. A high degree of co-linearity is inferred for these
genomes due to the absence of major rearrangements
within de novo contigs, and by the overall success of the
polymerase chain reaction-based sequence isolation strategy (indicating conservation of the order of anchor genes
containing primer sites). However, minor structural
changes (a tandem duplication in two species [24] and the
apparent loss of duplicate copies of psaM and rps4 in P.
koraiensis) could not be confirmed. No evidence of interspecific recombination was detected, consistent with the
rarity of recombination in plant plastomes [25].
The aligned matrix contained 7,761 parsimony informative ingroup substitutions (4,286 non-coding positions
and 3,475 coding positions) (Table 2). Over one-half of
parsimony informative sites (55.0%) in protein coding
regions resided in ycf1 and ycf2, two large genes of uncertain function [26], that accounted for 22% of all exon
sequence (Figure 1A, B). No other exons in the pine plastome exhibit such a disproportionate number of parsimony informative sites (Figure 1C). These loci have an
elevated nonsynonymous substitution rate (Table 3) and
appear to have a substantial number of indels in Pinus,
although it was not possible in many cases to confidently
score indels in these loci due to the inherent limitations of
reference-guided assembly of short reads in length variable regions. Start codon position, overall length and stop
codon positions were nonetheless largely preserved in
these loci across the genus. In addition to substitutions in
exons, 48 ingroup exon indels and 23 ingroup stop codon
shifts were identified in 26 loci.
Phylogenetic Resolution in Non-Random and Randomized
Data Partitions
Full alignment partitions yielded a higher proportion of
highly supported nodes, with 88 to 91% (29 to 30/33) of
ingroup nodes resolved with bootstrap support ≥ 95% in
likelihood analysis. The four largest data partitions tested
(full alignment and concatenated exon nucleotides, both
with and without ycf1 and ycf2) yielded results that were
topologically identical with the exception of four taxa (P.
albicaulis, P. krempfii, P. lambertiana N, P. parviflora) (Figures 2 and 3). In addition, support for the branching order
of P. cembra, P. koraiensis and P. sibirica was low in full
alignment partitions. Topological differences were found
to be significant according to Shimodaira-Hasegawa com-

parisons of the full alignment topology to two of the other
major partitions (full alignment and exon nucleotides
without ycf1 and ycf2). Trends in significance were most
strongly influenced by the two alternative positions of P.
krempfii (Figure 2 vs. Figure 3A, C; Table 4). With the
exception of P. krempfii, areas of topological uncertainty
reside in a single clade that historically has lacked internal
resolution (subsection Strobus) [20-22]. Coalescent estimations suggest that these poorly resolved subsection
Strobus haplotypes diverged in rapid succession relative to
the age of their shared nodes (0.009 to 0.44 coalescent
units, or ca. 90,000 to 450,000 years) (Table 5). A putative
chloroplast capture event in P. lambertiana previously documented [5] was also supported with whole-plastome
results. Substantial resolution was achieved in analyses of

ycf1 and ycf2 data partitions, however we observed several
topological differences from the full alignment with high
support (primarily involving the species discussed above)
(Figure 4).
Of the 71 exon coding indels and stop codon shifts identified, 35 mapped unambiguously to monophyletic
groups (that is, no accessions in a group were missing data
for that event) (Figures 5 and 6). All of these groups had
strong support in nucleotide-based phylogenetic analyses
(100% likelihood and parsimony bootstrap support). The
remainder of these events were primarily either putatively
monophyletic (missing data in one or more members of a
clade) or showed strong evidence of homoplasy (Figures
5 and 6).

Data from Gernandt et al. [21] and Eckert and Hall [20] pruned to include only ingroup species and outgroup genera common to our study. (PI =
parsimony informative.)

In parsimony analyses of variable-sized jackknife samples
of our full alignment, nodal support showed a strong positive correlation with the length of the nucleotide matrix
(proportion nodes ≥ 95% = -1.0808 + 0.38497*log10
[matrix size, bp]; r2 = 0.915, P < 0.0001) (Figure 7A). Resolution of full alignment and exon nucleotide partitions
was indistinguishable from random jackknife samples of
comparable size, indicating similar phylogenetic content
of these partitions and corresponding similar-sized random genomic subsamples. Partitions consisting of ycf1
and ycf2 - in particular ycf1, and ycf1 and ycf2 combined showed significantly higher resolution than the genomewide average (Figure 7A). The concatenated partition ycf1
+ ycf2 (13.1 kb; 77.4% nodes ≥ 95% bootstrap support)
yielded only slightly less phylogenetic resolution than all
exons combined (62.3 kb; 80.6% nodes ≥ 95% bootstrap
support) in parsimony analysis.
Comparisons to Previous Pinus Phylogenies
Previous cpDNA based estimates of infrageneric relationships in Pinus [20-22] sampled the same species and/or
lineages as our study, and inferred relationships using
2.82 to 3.57 kb of chloroplast DNA. Results of these studies are largely consistent with our results, although highly
supported nodes (≥ 95%) accounted for only 13 to 23%
of the total ingroup nodes (23% to 42% if [20,21]
adjusted to match our species composition). The empirical results of these studies fell within or close to the 95%
prediction intervals established from our jackknife resampling response from our full genome alignment (Figure
7A), indicating that the loci used in prior studies (primarily rbcL and matK) are similarly informative as a comparable sample of random nucleotides from the chloroplast
genome.
Meta-Analysis of Published Infrageneric Studies
From our sampling, infrageneric analyses in plants published from 2006 to 2008 were typically based on 2574

aligned bp (95% bootstrap confidence interval: 2,292,
2,864) of sequence data, evaluated 31.7 ingroup species
(95% bootstrap confidence interval: 20.2, 43.2), and
resolved 22.6% of nodes at ≥ 95% bootstrap support
(95% bootstrap confidence interval: 18.6, 26.5). Regression analysis shows that the proportion of highly resolved
nodes in these studies is significantly and positively correlated with matrix length (F1,96 = 18.032; r2 = 0.149; P <
0.0001) but not the number of included taxa (F1,97 =
0.546; r2 = 0.006; P = 0.461), although there was a negative trend in the latter (Figure 7B, C). Our current sample
size is typical in the number of taxa sampled, but both
matrix length (132.7 kb) and the proportion of highly
bootstrap-supported nodes (84.8% parsimony, 90.3%
maximum likelihood) were substantially higher.

Discussion
Our results highlight that whole plastome sequencing is
now a feasible and effective option for inferring phylogenies at low taxonomic levels. Compared to previous chloroplast-based phylogenetic analyses in Pinus, our data
matrix contained approximately 60 times more phylogenetically informative characters resulting in an approximately two- to four-fold increase in the proportion of
highly resolved nodes (after adjusting results of previous
studies to match our species composition) (Figure 8,
Table 2). An important question arising from these comparisons is whether the difference in resolution is entirely
attributable to the increase in nucleotides, or whether the
genomic partitions sequenced in prior studies were less
informative on average than the rest of the genome. In
fact, the resolution provided by loci used in previous Pinus
studies is indistinguishable from or slightly greater than
that of comparably sized random genomic subsamples
from our full alignment. Combined with the strong correlation between resolution and the size of random
genomic subsample, this suggests that the increase in resolution in this study is primarily due to the increase in

matrix length. This is further supported by a significant
relationship between resolution and matrix length in a
broad sampling of chloroplast-based infrageneric phylogenies. Based on these results, we predict that whole-plastome analysis will yield similar gains in phylogenetic
resolution not only in the genus Pinus but for most land
plant genera. On the other hand, it is apparent that even
the entire chloroplast genome may be insufficient to fully
resolve the most rapidly radiating lineages. In this regard,
our results are reflective of previous analyses of ancient
rapid radiations wherein nodal resolution does not scale
proportionately to the length of sequence analyzed
[27,28]. Notably, the position of P. krempfii was significantly different between the four largest data partitions
(Table 4), even though this species does not appear to be
associated with a rapid radiation (Table 5). This result is

not completely unexpected, as this species has previously
been difficult to place phylogenetically [29,30]. An unequivocal resolution of this species will likely require the
inclusion of multiple nuclear loci [30].
When considering recent divergence, the disproportionately high mutation rate in ycf1 (and ycf2, to a lesser
extent) demonstrated here is of importance, and mirrors
findings in other plant taxa [31,32] and recently in Pinus
subsection Ponderosae [33]. These loci should be informative for phylogenetic studies in recently-diverged clades or
in population-level studies in a range of plant species. Discretion is advised, however, as ycf1 (and possibly ycf2)
appears to be a target of positive selection at least in Pinus
and may reflect adaptive episodes rather than neutral
genealogies. In likelihood analyses of ycf1 and ycf2, we

Results of significance testing for topology comparisons of the full alignment (Figure 2) versus the three other largest data partitions (Figure 3). For
each set of comparisons, the first row represents comparison of unmodified maximum likelihood topologies. In the second and third rows the

indicated in bold. Significant topological differences at P < 0.05 are indicated with an asterisk.

observed several topological differences from the full
alignment at the subsectional level, further demonstrating
that caution must be taken in drawing phylogenetic conclusions from these two loci. Although we were able to
confidently score small structural changes (indels and
stop codon shifts) for all other exons, it was not possible
to score indels for ycf1 and ycf2 due to the apparent high
rate of indel formation in these loci. In all other loci examined, small structural changes only delineated clades with
concurrent high support from nucleotide-based analyses
(both in present study and [20-22]), and thus are likely to
be of limited use in species or population level discrimination. It is not clear whether this will also be the case in
ycf1 and ycf2.
It is reasonable to ask whether increased resolution is
worth the effort of assembling whole plastomes. Considering the conservative nature of bootstrap measures [3437], systematists often accept bootstrap values of ≥ 70% as

reliable indicators of accurate topology [36]. Simulation
studies [34], however, have demonstrated greatly
increased accuracy (approximately 42×) with bootstrap
values ≥ 95% versus ≥ 70%, and the initial formulation of
the phylogenetic bootstrap used ≥ 95% as the threshold
for topological significance [38]. Our results similarly
support using a 95% bootstrap support cutoff for conclusive evidence as in both areas of topological differences,
more than one clade received bootstrap support ≥ 70% by
analysis of alternate data partitions. It is probable that
conflicting topologies with ≥ 70% but < 95% bootstrap
support accurately reflect data partitions yet may not represent the plastome phylogeny, and here the use of entire
organelle genomes makes it possible to adopt more conservative criteria of nodal support. There are further biological reasons why an organellar phylogeny (essentially a
single-gene estimate) may not accurately represent the
organismal phylogeny; these include interspecific hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting, and stochastic proper-

All divergence time estimates assume a chloroplast mutation rate of 3.26 × 10-10 substitutions/site/year. Coalescent units reported are based on
either high (100,000) or low (10,000) effective population (Ne) sizes. Maximum likelihood (ML) branch lengths are shown as substitutions/site.
Estimated divergence times are presented in years (top), generations (middle) and coalescent units for high/low Ne (bottom).

Phylogenetic distribution of exon coding indel mutations in sampled Pinus accessions
Phylogenetic distribution of exon coding indel mutations in sampled Pinus accessions. Exon names given above
boxes, size of indel (bp) and polarity ("+" = insertion, "-" = deletion) given below boxes. Polarity of events determined by comparison to most distant outgroups. Due to the apparent high rate of indel formation in ycf1 and ycf2, these loci were not able
to be confidently scored for indels and are not included in this diagram. Events for only the first copy of psaM are reported.
Branching order of tree corresponds to RAxML analysis of complete alignment. Diagonal lines represent putative reversals of
indel events. * indicates missing data for one or more accessions of clade. Thin internal branches correspond to ML bootstrap
support < 95% or topological difference in four largest data partitions (full alignment and exon nucleotides, with and without
ycf1 and ycf2).

Figure 6
Phylogenetic distribution of stop codon mutations in sampled Pinus accessions
Phylogenetic distribution of stop codon mutations in sampled Pinus accessions. Exon names given above boxes,
amino acid shift relative to stop codon position in outgroups given below boxes. Polarity of events determined by comparison
to most distant outgroups; "+" signifies extension of coding region due to stop codon mutation, "-" signifies shortening. The
value of zero for the psbH- and psaM-associated events corresponds to events that alter the original stop codon without altering the total number of codons in the locus. Events for only the first copy of psaM are reported. Diagonal line represents a
putative reversal in psaJ of P. parviflora. Branching order of tree corresponds to RAxML analysis of complete alignment. * indicates missing data for one or more accessions of clade. Thin internal branches correspond to ML bootstrap support < 95% or
topological difference in four largest data partitions (full alignment and exon nucleotides, with and without ycf1 and ycf2).

ties of the coalescent process. Nonetheless, phylogenetic
reconstruction based on complete organellar sequences
may facilitate the detection of such phenomena, by reducing errors and uncertainty due to insufficient sampling of
DNA sequence.

Conclusion
Plastome sequencing is now a reasonable option for
increasing resolution in phylogenetic studies at low taxonomic levels and will continue to become an increasingly
simple process. As sequencers evolve to even higher capacity and multiplexing becomes routine in the near future,
this will allow more extensive taxon and genomic sampling in phylogenetic studies at all taxonomic levels. It is
estimated that sequencing capacity on next generation
platforms will approach 100 gigabase pairs per sequencing run by the end of 2009. For perspective, this is sufficient sequence capacity to produce all 100 genus-level
data sets used in our meta-analysis (including ours) at
greater than 100× coverage depth in a single sequencing
run. Based on the estimates of Cronn et al. [9], this
sequencing capacity would also allow the simultaneous
sequencing of several thousands of animal mitochondria,
which could greatly benefit low-level taxonomic or population-based studies in animals that currently tend to rely
on relatively short sequences from many individuals [39].
It is also clear that these improvements could enable other
pursuits that are currently hindered by limited sequencing
capacity, such as identification of plants by diagnostic
DNA sequences (DNA barcoding). The recently agreed

upon two locus chloroplast barcode for plants claims only
72% unique identification to species level[40]. Based on
results herein, whole plastome sequences have the potential to be more highly discriminating and efficient plant
DNA barcodes; in fact, the possibility of plastome- and
mitome-scale barcodes has been raised previously [41].
Results in this area (as well as in phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses) will be impacted particularly if
advances in target isolation and enrichment [13-15] and
streamlining sample preparation [17] prove globally
effective.

Methods
DNA Extraction, Amplification and Sequencing
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing are
described in and followed Cronn et al. [9], with 4 bp multiplex tags, replacing the original 3 bp tags (Table 1). For
one sample, P. ponderosa, additional reads from three nonmultiplexed lanes of genomic DNA were also included.
Sequence Assembly and Genome Alignments
Sequence assembly and alignment are described in and
followed Whittall et al. [42]. An analysis of interspecific
recombination was conducted using RDP(Recombination
Detection Program) v. 3.27 [43]. Rather than using the
full genomic alignment, which was too memory-intensive, concatenated nucleotide sequences for 71 exons
common to all accessions were used (reflective of order on
the plastome). Subgenera were investigated separately as
members of opposing subgenera appear incapable of
hybridization [44]. Each subgenus was checked for
recombination events using standard settings for several
recombination-detection strategies, including: RDP [45],
GeneConv [46], Chimaera [47], MaxChi [48], BootScan
[49], and SiScan [50]. A total of 24 putative recombination events were identified. On close investigation, all
events involved one or more of the following: misalignment, autapomorphic noise coupled with missing data,
and amplification of pseudogenes. In cases of misalignment, alignments were corrected prior to subsequent phylogenetic analyses. In cases of amplification of
pseudogenes, the entire amplicon for the accession
involved was turned to Ns. Inspection of the alignment
also revealed that some amplicons in some accessions had
failed to amplify, or amplified apparently paralogous loci
(evidenced by substantially higher divergence). These
regions were masked in affected accessions. The locus
matK was determined to be a putative paralog in several
accessions, and in four (P. armandii, P. lambertiana S, P.
albicaulis, and P. ayacahuite) it was replaced with Sanger
sequence [5]. We also replaced 2180 bp of poor quality
sequence of the locus ycf1 in P. ponderosa with Sanger
sequence. In all accessions amplified by PCR, the regions
adjacent to primer sites typically had low coverage, while
primers had very high coverage, thus primer-flanking

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/84

regions (where problematic) and the primers were also
excluded. It was also determined through Sanger sequencing that a 600 bp region of the previously published P.
koraiensis plastome (positions 48808 to 49634 in GenBank AY228468) is apparently erroneous. This region was
removed and reference guided analysis was rerun for this
amplicon.
Aligned sequences were annotated using DOGMA (Dual
Organellar Genome Annotator) [51] with manual adjustments to match gene predictions from GenBank and the
Chloroplast
Genome
Database
http://chloro
plast.cbio.psu.edu/. Exons were evaluated for reading
frame and translations, and validity of exon mutations
was judged based on presence in de novo sequence, effect
on the resulting polypeptide sequence, and sequence coverage depth.
Phylogenetic Analyses
Sequence data was analyzed using all genome positions
and concatenated nucleotide sequence from 71 exons
common to all pine accessions; both partitions were analyzed with and without the loci ycf1 and ycf2. A relatively
short (approximately 630 bp) repetitive stretch of the
locus ycf1 of subgenus Strobus accessions was masked in
all analyses due to alignment ambiguity. The loci ycf1 and
ycf2 (ca. 14 kb combined) were also analyzed individually
and together.

Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses were
performed through the Cipres Web Portal http://
www.phylo.org/portal/Home.do using RAxML bootstrapping with the general model of nucleotide evolution
(GTR+G) [52] and automatically determined numbers of
bootstrap replicates. Bayesian inference analyses (BI) were
performed using MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [53] using the GTR+G+I
model, which was selected using MrModelTest v. 2.3 [54]
under both Aikake Information Criterion and Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Test frameworks. Each analysis consisted of two runs with four chains each (three hot and
one cold chain), run for 1000000 generations with trees
sampled every 100 generations. The first 25% percent of
trees from all runs were discarded as burn-in. Unweighted
maximum parsimony analyses (MP) of data partitions
were conducted in PAUP* (Phylogenetic Analysis Using
Parsimony (*and other methods)) v. 4.0b10 [55] by heuristic search with 10 replicates of random sequence addition, tree bisection and reconnection branch swapping
and a maxtrees limit of 1,000. Non-parametric bootstrap
analysis was conducted under the same conditions for
1,000 replicates to determine branch support.
Topological differences between the full alignment topology and each of the three other largest data partitions (full
alignment without ycf1 and ycf2, and exon nucleotides

both with and without ycf1 and ycf2) were tested for significance using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test [56] with
resampling estimated log-likelihood (RELL) bootstrapping (1,000 replicates) under the GTR+G model of evolution. To further determine which topological differences
were most influential, tests were repeated with the positions of topology-variable accessions alternately modified
to match the full alignment topology. In total, the full
alignment data set was compared to nine different topologies.
Exon indels and stop codon shifts were mapped onto the
topology determined by ML analysis of the full alignment
by parsimony mapping using Mesquite v. 2.6 (Maddison
and Maddison, http://mesquiteproject.org). Tests of selection for exons were performed in MEGA v. 4.0 [57] using
the codon-based Z-test for selection, with pairwise deletion and the Nei-Gojobori (P-distance) model; variance of
the differences were computed using the bootstrap
method with 500 replicates.
Estimation of Divergence Times for Poorly Resolved Nodes
Divergence times for four nodes with topological uncertainty (P. albicaulis - P. lambertiana N - P. parviflora, P. sibirica - P. cembra - P. koraiensis, P. krempfii-section
Quinquefoliae of subgenus Strobus) were estimated according to Pollard et al. [58]. Chloroplast mutation rate was
estimated by averaging maximum and minimum mutation rates for Pinaceae chloroplast genomes from two previous studies [59,60] and assuming a generation time of
50 years [61]. Two estimates were calculated for each node
using either low (10,000) or high (100,000) effective population size [23].
Effect of Character Number on Phylogenetic Resolution
Empirical data from Pinus genomes
Variable-size random subsamples of the full alignment
were tested under the parsimony criteria using PAUP* v.
4.0b10 (the faststep option was used for all but the two
smallest partitions due to time considerations). Eleven
partition sizes were tested (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
80, 100 and 120 kb) in five replicates each, with resolution measured as the percentage of ingroup nodes produced with ≥ 95% jackknife support. Relationships
between partition size and ingroup resolution were estimated using least squares regressions, and 95% confidence limits for individual points were estimated based
on linear regression using SAS JMP 7.0.1 (S.A.S. Institute,
Inc., http://www.jmp.com/). Our full alignment, exon
nucleotides and ycf1/ycf2 partitions were analyzed under
the same parsimony criteria for comparison, as were the
alignments of [20-22]. Accessions from Gernandt et al.
and Eckert et al. [20,21] were pruned to include only taxa
common to our sampling; the original analysis of Wang et

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/84

al. [22] was used since this data matrix was not available
for alternative phylogenetic analyses.
Meta-Analysis of Published Studies
We evaluated 99 phylogenetic analyses from 86 studies
published between 2006 and 2008 in Systematic Botany,
Systematic Biology, American Journal of Botany, Taxon,
Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, and Annals of the
Missouri Botanical Garden [see additional file 2]. Analyses were selected based on: 1) the presented phylogeny
was based solely on chloroplast DNA sequence; 2) the
analysis included ≥ 10 species from a monophyletic
genus; 3) there were more inter- than intra-specific taxa
analyzed within the genus; 4) parsimony-based bootstrap
or jackknife values were presented. Ingroup branches with
bootstrap support ≥ 95%, the number of ingroup taxa and
the aligned base pairs used in the analysis were recorded
for each case. The authors' taxonomic interpretations were
accepted in instances of taxonomic uncertainty. Conspecific clades were treated as one taxon unless clearly differentiated from one another, and internal bootstrap values
were disregarded. The number of branches with bootstrap
support ≥ 95% was regressed both on the number of
aligned base pairs and the number of taxa (both log-transformed to meet assumptions of normality and equal variances).
