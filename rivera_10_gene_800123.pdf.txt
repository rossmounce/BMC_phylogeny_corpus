Abstract
Background: Duplication and divergence of genes and genetic networks is hypothesized to be a major driver of
the evolution of complexity and novel features. Here, we examine the history of genes and genetic networks in
the context of eye evolution by using new approaches to understand patterns of gene duplication during the
evolution of metazoan genomes. We hypothesize that 1) genes involved in eye development and
phototransduction have duplicated and are retained at higher rates in animal clades that possess more distinct
types of optical design; and 2) genes with functional relationships were duplicated and lost together, thereby
preserving genetic networks. To test these hypotheses, we examine the rates and patterns of gene duplication and
loss evident in 19 metazoan genomes, including that of Daphnia pulex - the first completely sequenced crustacean
genome. This is of particular interest because the pancrustaceans (hexapods+crustaceans) have more optical
designs than any other major clade of animals, allowing us to test specifically whether the high amount of
disparity in pancrustacean eyes is correlated with a higher rate of duplication and retention of vision genes.
Results: Using protein predictions from 19 metazoan whole-genome projects, we found all members of 23 gene
families known to be involved in eye development or phototransduction and deduced their phylogenetic
relationships. This allowed us to estimate the number and timing of gene duplication and loss events in these
gene families during animal evolution. When comparing duplication/retention rates of these genes, we found that
the rate was significantly higher in pancrustaceans than in either vertebrates or non-pancrustacean protostomes.
Comparing patterns of co-duplication across Metazoa showed that while these eye-genes co-duplicate at a
significantly higher rate than those within a randomly shuffled matrix, many genes with known functional
relationships in model organisms did not co-duplicate more often than expected by chance.
Conclusions: Overall, and when accounting for factors such as differential rates of whole-genome duplication in
different groups, our results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that genes involved in eye development
and phototransduction duplicate at a higher rate in Pancrustacea, the group with the greatest variety of optical
designs. The result that these genes have a significantly high number of co-duplications and co-losses could be
influenced by shared functions or other unstudied factors such as synteny. Since we did not observe coduplication/co-loss of genes for all known functional modules (e.g. specific regulatory networks), the interactions
among suites of known co-functioning genes (modules) may be plastic at the temporal scale of analysis performed
here. Other factors in addition to gene duplication - such as cis-regulation, heterotopy, and co-option - are also
likely to be strong factors in the diversification of eye types.

Background
Genomic complexity is driven, to a large extent, by gene
duplication, retention, and divergence [1,2]. This is
hypothesized to lead to both an increase in morphological complexity, via the evolution of novel features, and
an increase in proteomic network complexity, through
the establishment of new network interactions [3-5].
Here, we examine the genetic histories of 23 gene
families involved in eye development and phototransduction to test: 1) whether gene duplication rates are
higher in a taxon with greater eye disparity (we use the
term disparity as it is used in paleontology to describe
the diversity of morphology [6]) and 2) if genes with
known functional relationships (genetic networks) tend
to co-duplicate across taxa. We test these hypotheses by
identifying gene-family members involved in eye development and phototransduction from metazoan full genome sequences. We use the term ‘eye-genes’ to describe
the genes in our dataset with caution, because many of
these genes have additional functions beyond vision or
eye development and because it is not possible to analyze all genes that influence vision or eye development.
Next, we map duplication and loss events of these eyegenes on an assumed metazoan phylogeny. We then test
for an elevated rate of gene duplication/accumulation in
the group with the greatest diversity of optical designs,
the Pancrustacea. Finally, we search for correlation in
duplication patterns among these gene families - a signature of ‘co-duplication’ [7].
We define Pancrustacea as disparate in eye morphology
because the group has the highest number of distinct
optical designs of any animal group. At the broadest
level, there are eight recognized optical designs for eyes
in all Metazoa [8]. Four of the broad optical types are single chambered eyes like those of vertebrates. The other
four eye types are compound eyes with multiple focusing
(dioptric) apparatuses, rather than the single one found
in single chambered eyes. The disparity of optical
designs in pancrustaceans (hexapods + crustaceans) is
relatively high [8]. Other diverse and “visually advanced”
animal groups like chordates and mollusks have three or
four eye types, respectively, but pancrustaceans exhibit
seven of the eight major optical designs found in animals [8]. In is important to clarify that our use of ‘disparity’ in pancrustacean eyes does not have a direct
relationship to evolutionary history (homology). For
example, although related species often share optical
designs by homology, optical design can also change
during evolution in homologous structures. Insect stemmata share homology with compound eyes, but have a
simplified optical design compared to compound eyes
[9]. We argue that because of the range of eye designs,
pancrustaceans are a key group for examining molecular

evolutionary history in the context of morphological
disparity.
Targeted gene families involved in eye development

Despite visual disparity within insects and crustaceans,
morphological and molecular data suggest that many of
the developmental events that pattern eyes are shared
among the Pancrustacea. For example, several key morphological events in compound eye development are
conserved, suggesting that this process is homologous
among pancrustaceans [10-18]. While the genetics of
eye development are unknown for many pancrustaceans,
we rely on comparisons between Drosophila and other
insects. For instance, there are several genes commonly
expressed in the Drosophila compound eye, stemmata
and Bolwig’s organ patterning [rev. in [19]] that are
similarly employed in eye development in other pancrustaceans [e.g. [9,11,20-24]].
In our analyses, we examine developmental gene families
falling into three classes: 1) Gene families used early in
visual system specification: Decapentaplegic (Dpp),
Engrailed (En), Hedgehog (Hh), Kruppel (Kr), Wingless/
Wnt1 (Wnt1), and Zerknullt (Zen). 2) Gene families used
in retinal determination and patterning: Dachshund (Dac),
Eyes absent (Eya), Eyegone/Twin of Eyegone (Eyg/Toe),
Pax-6, and Sine Oculis/Six1/2 (Six1/2). 3) Gene families
used in photoreceptor differentiation: Epidermal Growth
Factor Receptor (Egfr), Glass (Gl), Munster (Mu), Notch,
Spam, Spitz (Spi), and CVC homeobox (Vsx). While most
of the gene families among these three classes have only
been examined extensively in Drosophila, studies in other
arthropods suggest at least some developmental conservation [e.g. [11,20-25]]. Interestingly, several of these genes
are also involved in vertebrate eye specification, suggesting
possible ancestral bilaterian eye-specification gene families
[26]. However, most of these gene families are used in
multiple developmental contexts, making ancestral assignments impossible without more data. For this reason, we
focus on the evolutionary history of the genes themselves,
rather than ancestral function. Although other genes are
known to be involved in these processes, we focus on gene
families with known functional interactions to maintain a
narrow scope that allows us to test our hypotheses. Other
more extensive datasets could be used in future similar
analyses as new information on eye-gene function
accumulates.
Targeted gene families involved in phototransduction

Phototransduction is the pathway for photosensitivity
and visual processes as it converts a light signal from
the environment to an electrical signal in photoreceptor
cells. The pathway is regulated by photosensitive proteins in the opsin family. In animals, two major opsin

Rivera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/123

clades (R- and C-opsins), and their associated pathway
proteins, tend to be segregated between rhabdomeric
and ciliary photoreceptor cell types [27-30]. R-opsins are
thought to have originated prior to the bilaterian ancestor [29]. Where the pathway is known, pancrustacean
vision is dependent on the rhabdomeric phototransduction pathway [31,32]. This begins with R-opsin and proceeds through a G-protein signaling cascade wherein the
Gq-alpha subunit interacts with Phospholipase C (PLC),
causing Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels
to open for membrane depoloarization [33]. Arrestin
(Arr) attenuates the signal by inhibiting further G-protein activation [34,35].
Evolution of complexity

Our first hypothesis, that genomic complexity facilitates
morphological complexity, predicts a pattern of high
gene duplication rate in an organismal clade with high
optical disparity. Our second hypothesis, that functional
relationships constrain the histories of individual genes,
predicts that gene families with direct functional interactions or common regulation (e.g. retinal determination
genes) will show similar patterns of gene loss and duplication. This second hypothesis addresses the question of
the evolution of gene regulatory networks. In the context of gene duplication, there are two non-mutually
exclusive ways that gene regulatory networks originate.
The first is via co-option, where new regulatory interactions are formed between a duplicated gene and other
genes. The second is via co-duplication, wherein all
genes in a highly-conserved module (such as a

Page 3 of 16

regulatory network) duplicate in the same phylogenetic
interval and continue to interact within diverging
daughter clades. When genes are involved in a highly
conserved module and used in various contexts, we
might expect that changes to specific genes in the module via duplication and divergence would be mirrored in
changes to the other components. That is, if two genes
act in a conserved manner over evolutionary time, then
the retention of a duplicate of one gene might result in
a greater chance of retention for the duplicate of the
other gene. One prominent example of co-duplication
of network genes preceding the evolution of greater
visual complexity is the origin of vertebrate rod and
cone specific photoreceptor gene networks [7,36,37].
Similar situations can also be envisaged for co-loss. In
the current study, we look at duplication and loss patterns across a large genetic dataset to ask if genes in our
dataset tend to duplicate and be lost in tandem, showing
patterns of co-duplication/loss.

Results
The sequencing of the Daphnia pulex genome allows us,
for the first time, to infer genomic-level arthropod evolution beyond the insect clade. Within the D. pulex genome, we identified any homologs of 23 gene families
involved in eye development and phototransduction
(based on those in Drosophila). We then constructed
gene-trees (Additional File 1) for each of these families
based on protein sequence from 19 taxa with completed
genomes (Tables 1 and 2, Additional File 1) and reconciled the gene trees to an assumed species tree to infer

gene duplication and loss events [38]. These data
allowed us to calculate the frequency of homolog loss
and gain within each gene family across phylogenetic
intervals on our assumed species tree (Figures 1 and 2).
We found that for certain gene families there was a significantly higher rate of duplication in the pancrustacean
clade compared to other clades of animals. With these
inferred patterns of gene loss and gain, we performed
correlative analyses to identify co-duplication of gene
families. While we found that several gene families exhibit co-duplication/loss with at least one other gene, in
many cases these correlations are between genes that

are without a known functional relationship (Figure 3,
Additional File 2).
Comparison to previously hypothesized gene trees

After searching whole genome sequences (see Methods),
we estimated gene trees for 22 different gene families
(Additional File 1, Table 2). We were unable to estimate
a tree for Munster due to ambiguous homology with
other genes. For many of these gene families, this was the
first phylogenetic analysis utilizing searches of wholegenome data. For several gene families this was also the
first pan-Metazoa phylogenetic analysis (Table 2).

Figure 3 Gene families with correlated patterns of duplication/loss. Loss and gain patterns over 36 phylogenetic intervals (Figures 2 and 3)
were compared between each pair of gene families. A) Gene families with significant correlation of their duplication patterns (see Methods) are
connected with a blue line. Gene families with significant correlation of their loss patterns are connected with a red line. B) To partially account
for the probable high amount of functional overlap between members of the same gene family, we calculated overall gene family duplication/
loss activity over a phylogenetic interval (number of losses subtracted from number of duplications) and compared patterns between gene
families over all phylogenetic intervals. Pairs with a significant amount of correlation (see Methods) are connected by blue lines. 15 genes had
significant correlation with at least one other gene family. This is much higher than the number found in our randomly shuffled matrices (C, see
Methods). C) Histogram representing the numbers of correlations found in 1000 randomly shuffled matrices using the gain minus loss data (see
Methods). Most shuffled matrices had 0 or 1 significant correlations, representing 0 or 2 genes, a few had 5 or 6. Arrow represents the number
of significant correlations (14) found in the unshuffled gain minus loss data matrix.

By searching whole-genome data, we were able to find
new members of several gene families. For example, we
were able to generate a more complete phylogenetic
hypothesis for the Glass (Gl) gene family with the discovery of a new chordate homolog. While a previous unpublished phylogeny identified an echinoderm Gl homolog
[39], no homologs have been reported previously in chordates. Through the analysis of the chordate Branchistoma
floridae genome, we discovered a putative homolog
which groups with the other Gl genes with very high support (aLRT = 1) and has similar domain structure to
other known Gl genes. This suggests a loss of the Gl
gene family of zinc-finger members early in chordate
evolution (Additional File 1, Figure S13). In addition, our
analyses uncovered one gene from zebrafish and one
from fugu that together form a sister group to all other
Dpp/BMP2/4 genes. This relationship implies a paralog
present in fugu and zebrafish but absent in all other
eumetazoans. These fish homologs have not, to our
knowledge, been studied, except in having been named
BMP2 based on similarity searches associated with zebrafish and fugu genome projects, so confirming the presence of new functional Dpp/BMP2/4 genes in these fish
would require experimental demonstration.
We examined Pax-6 in greater detail than other gene
families by including sequences from additional arthropod species. This gene has a well-known and conserved
role in eye development, and previous authors have
indicated, counter to our conclusions, that the genes
eyeless (ey) and twin-of-eyeless (toy) are insect- specific
duplications [40]. We found strong phylogenetic evidence for a pre-arthropod duplication of ey and toy. We

found support for a family of genes that includes Drosophila toy, a myriapod toy-like gene, plus a newly
described toy-like gene from an ostracod crustacean and
a chelicerate. The toy-clade excludes Drosophila ey and
the ey-like genes of a crustacean and a myriapod. We
conclude it is very unlikely that toy and ey represent an
insect-specific duplication event, although the precise
timing of this duplication is difficult to determine with
currently available data.
Pancrustaceans have high rates of gene-duplication
within our dataset

While excluding arthropod-specific gene families (Spitz,
Spam, and Zen), we analyzed and compared rates of
gain of gene-family members (duplications) across pancrustaceans, across non-arthropod protostomes (Lophotrochozoa and Caenorhabditis elegans), and across
vertebrates. We used three denominators to calculate
rates of gene duplication (ie rate equals distance/time,
and we used three different metrics of evolutionary
‘time’ to calculate gene duplications/time). Using total
gene duplications in the denominator normalizes by
overall rates of gene duplication in each clade, which
includes any whole genome duplications that occurred
in a particular group. A second denominator was
genetic distance, utilizing average ortholog divergence
between species in a clade [41]. Genetic distance normalizes by the overall molecular diversity in a clade.
Our third denominator was a molecular clock estimate
of divergence times [42,43]. Compared with other protostomes, we found that duplication rates of eye-genes
were significantly higher in pancrustaceans in all three

Rivera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:123

analyses (see Methods). Compared with vertebrates, eyegenes showed higher duplication rates in pancrustaceans
when normalized by total gene duplications. However,
comparing duplication over both molecular clock divergence times and genetic distance yielded similar rates of
eye-gene gain in vertebrates and pancrustaceans.
In our first analytical measure of duplication rates, we
normalized the number of duplications observed in our
eye-gene dataset by the total number of gene duplications calculated from the genomes of the clade of interest. We inferred 50 duplications of eye-related genes in
pancrustaceans compared to 33113 total duplications in
the pancrustacean genomes, resulting in a ratio (δ) of
0.0015 (Table 3). This is significantly higher than the δ
value for non-arthropod protostomes (δ = 0.00026; Fisher’s exact test, p = 1.5e-11) or vertebrates, (δ = 0.00058;
p = 4.9e-6) (Tables 3 and 4). To further scrutinize duplication rates, we examined developmental and phototransduction genes separately. The difference between
the δ of non-arthropod invertebrates and pancrustaceans
was still significant for both developmental (p = 0.0102)
and phototransduction (p = 1.47e-10) genes. When
compared to vertebrates, only the δ for phototransduction genes, and not developmental genes, was significantly higher in pancrustaceans (p = 2.52e-11) (Tables 3
and 4).
We also used genetic distance (average number of
amino acid substitutions between orthologs in a clade)
as a second measure of evolutionary rate [41]. This measure allows us to calculate gene duplications per amino
acid substitution (ι) to examine gene duplication in the
context of overall lineage diversity (Table 3). For

pancrustaceans, we found that ι for eye genes was
0.0478, significantly higher than ι for non-arthropod
protostomes (ι = 0.0193, p = 0.0010). However, ι was
higher in vertebrates (ι = 0.0577) than pancrustaceans.
We also calculated ι separately for developmental and
phototransduction genes. Pancrustacean ι (0.0124) and
non-arthropod protostomes ι (0.0091) did not differ significantly for developmental genes, although vertebrate
ι was significantly greater (ι = 0.043, p = 8.79e-5). For
phototransduction genes, pancrustacean ι (0.0353) was
significantly higher than ι for non-arthropod protostomes ι = 0.0102; p = 0.0004), and significantly higher
than ι for vertebrates ι = 0.0184, p = 0.0080) (Tables 3
and 4).
Finally, we used a calibrated molecular clock as a third
measure of evolutionary time. One critique of ages
inferred by molecular clock studies is that they often
overestimate absolute clade ages [44-48]. Even so, the
estimates could still be reliable estimators of relative
clade age, which is what we require for comparing rates
in different clades. Utilizing published molecular clockbased divergence time estimates [42,43], we found results
very similar to our analysis using genetic distance. Overall, eye-gene duplication rates standardized using clock
divergence time estimates (μ) were found to be significantly higher in pancrustaceans (0.1604) than other protostomes (0.0215, p = 1.9e-9) but were not significantly
different than μ for vertebrates (0.1044). Although developmental genes analyzed alone were not significantly different between pancrustaceans and vertebrates,
phototransduction genes showed a significantly higher μ
in pancrustaceans compared to vertebrates (p = 0.0010).

Both sets of eye-genes showed a significantly higher μ
compared to other protostomes (Tables 3 and 4).
In all three analyses, eye genes showed a higher rate of
duplication in pancrustaceans than in non-arthropod
protostomes. In contrast, pancrustaceans only show
higher rates of duplication than vertebrates when phototransduction genes are included in the analysis. That is,
pancrustaceans do not show higher rates of developmental gene duplication compared to vertebrates under
any analysis.
Co-duplication is significant in our dataset

We compared gene losses and gene duplications separately across Metazoan genomes and found that 15 of
22 gene families had correlated patterns of loss or gain
with at least one other gene family (Figure 3a). In a
separate analysis, we compared patterns of gene loss
and duplication simultaneously by taking the total number of duplications minus losses for each gene family
over each branch of the species tree. Both analyses
yielded similar results (Figure 3b).
To test the statistical significance of our observed
number of correlations, we randomized our data matrix
by shuffling to generate a null distribution of correlations. We found that the majority of shuffled matrices
(1000 total) had only either 0 or 1 significant correlations between gene families and none had over 6 correlations, making our observed result of 15 significantly
different from the null distribution (Figure 3c). This
confirmed that the number of correlated gene families
in the real dataset is greater than expected under by
chance. However, the genes showing high levels of correlation in gain/loss patterns were not primarily genes
with known functional relationships (Figure 3, Additional File 3).

Discussion
Here we have examined the evolutionary history of
genes involved in eye development and phototransduction by analysis of gene family trees, reconciled trees,
and co-duplication data. Thus, we examined gene-family
evolution in the context of both morphological disparity
(eye disparity vs. gene duplication rates) and protein
network evolution (co-duplication/loss). In most of our
analyses, we found that increased rates of duplication
within specific eye-gene families were correlated with
the increased optical disparity seen in pancrustaceans.
At the protein network level, we found significant coduplication of eye-genes, though the patterns of duplication are more complex than we originally hypothesized
with respect to previously known functional interactions
among proteins.

Gene trees

In our examination of gene duplication and loss, we
generated phylogenetic hypotheses for 22 gene families.
Many of these are the first detailed analyses of the evolution of the gene family, which will be of use in future
research on these gene families in various contexts. We
found that gene trees of orthologs often are incongruent
with assumed species-level relationships. Assuming our
inferred gene trees are accurate, our results imply that
there is a more complex pattern of gain and loss than
would have been expected by simply comparing number
of gene orthologs in each species. Because errors in our
trees could lead to overestimations of complexity, we
required support values of 90% or higher in our reconciliation analysis. That is, we allowed branch swapping to
minimize duplications and losses in cases where the
node support was less than 0.9. However, this method
can underestimate the numbers of gains and losses [49].
Future inquiries could focus on these poorly supported
nodes, by including additional species in the analyses as
they become available, or by including additional information (e.g. domain structure or intron presence/
absence) in attempts to estimate phylogenies with higher
support. In addition, presumably more accurate reconciled trees could be generated in the future using more
computationally expensive methods, such as fully Bayesian estimation of gene and species reconciliation
[50,51], which currently would be very difficult at the
scale of analysis conducted here. The inclusion of additional genomes in future studies will also be of help in
generating accurate hypotheses, as taxon (in this case
gene) sampling is an important determinant of phylogenetic estimation [52].
Rates of gene duplication

We found overall support for the hypothesis that gene
duplication and/or retention rates are higher in pancrustaceans, the group with the highest disparity of opticaltypes. We examined the sensitivity of this overall conclusion in three different ways. First, we compared pancrustaceans to both non-arthropod protostomes and to
vertebrates. Second, for each of these comparisons, we
estimated gene duplication rates using three different
denominators: total gene duplications, overall genetic
distance, and divergence time estimates from molecular
clock analyses. These different denominators are necessary to understand the influence of different modes of
genome evolution on our conclusions, such as the multiple genome duplications known in vertebrates. Third,
we examined (both separately and together) duplication
rates of genes from different eye-gene categories (developmental versus phototransduction genes), allowing us
to test whether one category was the primary driver of

Rivera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/123

the overall rates. For example, developmental genes are
probably involved in more non-visual phenotypes than
phototransduction genes since phototransduction genes
often have localized expression [e.g. [53]], and this difference in pleiotropy could influence final results.
Comparisons between eye-gene duplication rate in
pancrustaceans and non-arthropod protostomes clearly
supported our hypothesis, even when taking the conservative approach of not counting arthropod-specific
genes. The observed difference in gene duplication rate
between these two clades does not depend on the
denominator used in rate calculations, and is significantly different for both developmental and phototransduction genes (Tables 3, 4). Despite the consistency of
these results, it is important to consider that there are
multiple possible causes for our observed correlation
between higher optical disparity and higher eye-gene
duplication rate. One possible explanation is that gene
duplications, perhaps retained by natural selection, are a
causal factor in increasing optical disparity in pancrustaceans. In fact, gene duplications are known to have
increased retinal complexity in vertebrates, leading to
separate rod and cone phototransduction pathways
[7,36,37]. Whether these vertebrate duplications were
fixed by natural selection or neutral processes is
unknown. At present, however, too little is known about
the relationship between pancrustacean genes and optical design phenotypes to claim that gene duplication
was a causal factor leading to higher optical disparity.
Another explanation is that the available full genome
sequences do not allow for appropriate estimates of
duplication rates in these clades. For example C. elegans
does not possess conventional eyes, even though many
other non-arthropod protostomes do. If, as a result of
losing eyes during evolution, the lineage of C. elegans
has a lower rate of eye-gene duplication, this could
result in an underestimate of eye-gene duplication rate
for the entire clade. Similarly, the pancrustaceans used
here could have more eye-genes than other arthropods.
In fact, Daphnia pulex does have a large number of
genes compared to other arthropods, perhaps because of
its asexual/sexual life history (Colbourne J et al: Genome
Biology of the Model Crustacean Daphnia pulex, submitted). These hypotheses could be examined using the
approaches developed here, once additional genome
sequences become available.
Compared to rate differences between pancrustaceans
and non-arthropod protostomes, rate differences
between pancrustaceans and vertebrates were more variable. That is, using different denominators in our rate
calculations led to different results (total gene duplications, genetic distance, or molecular clock). An important consideration in these comparisons is that
vertebrates are known to have undergone multiple

Page 10 of 16

whole-genome duplications, which raised the overall
estimated rate of gene duplication and accumulation for
the group. This is evident in total gene duplications that
we counted (80673 in vertebrates vs. 33113 in pancrustaceans) but is not reflected in our other distance measures (denominators): both clades show similar genetic
distance (as measured by average ortholog distance 1047 and 814 respectively) as well as similar clade ages
(as estimated by a molecular clock - 470 and 450 mya).
The high overall rate of gene duplication and accumulation in vertebrates may therefore explain why, counter
to our hypothesis, vertebrates show a significantly higher
rate of eye development gene duplication than
pancrustaceans.
The high rate of duplication and/or retention of genes
in vertebrates further suggest that the best rate comparison might be that using total number of gene duplications as the distance between species (denominator). It
is this rate calculation that corrects for vertebrate
whole-genome duplications. Even here, we see a difference between gene types, with only phototransduction
genes, and not developmental genes, supporting our
starting hypothesis that pancrustaceans have a higher
eye-gene duplication rate. However, much of the significant difference in phototransduction genes is driven by
extensive duplications of opsin in the D. pulex lineage
(Colbourne J et al: Genome Biology of the Model Crustacean Daphnia pulex, submitted), a phenomenon also
known in other crustaceans [54,55]. Given the observed
difference between developmental and phototransduction genes when comparing vertebrates and pancrustaceans, it is tempting to speculate on possible biological
causes for this result. For example, we expect developmental genes to be pleiotropic, and several of the genes
studied here are known to function in many contexts
besides eye development [e.g. [56]]. Phototransduction
genes have a more specific functional role and may be
less pleiotropic [e.g. [53]]. The more pleiotropic developmental genes could rely more heavily on modifications in the protein and cis-regulatory sequences, rather
than on gene duplication for diversifying function [57].
If so, correlation between gene duplication rate and
morphological disparity could be low or nonexistent.
The consideration of pleiotropy also highlights
another avenue for future research. If pleiotropy does
result in a weaker correlation between eye disparity and
gene duplication rate, gene choice must influence the
final results. Therefore, future research might focus on a
broader sampling of genes, especially to the extent that
analyses conducted here could be fully automated to
allow the analysis of very large datasets. For example, a
recent study focusing on the insects found higher numbers of gene duplications in dipterans than other insects
by examining 91 fly eye-genes [58]. Integrating this type

Rivera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/123

of “retinome” scale analysis with the methods we show
here would give a more detailed and informed view of
gene evolution in the context of morphological disparity
and innovation.
The available genomic data allowed us to test the
hypothesis that pancrustaceans, a group with many disparate eye types, have more duplications of eye-genes
than less optically-diverse groups. This relies on an
assumed species phylogeny, and our assumption that we
are estimating rates of pancrustacean duplication for the
entire clade. Complicating this assumption, the phylogenetic position of branchiopods (including Daphnia
pulex) within Arthropoda remains somewhat uncertain
[59-62]. We here consider the hexapod/D. pulex ancestor to be the common ancestor of all pancrustaceans for
simplicity. This is justified by the wide variety of optical
designs found in this hypothesized hexapod-branchiopod clade, regardless of whether it represents the ancestral pancrustacean or whether crustaceans are in fact
paraphyletic [59-62]. Future research using genomes
from more crustaceans and taxa with a wider range of
eye-type disparity could allow testing for a broader correlation between eye disparity and eye-related gene
number, a possibility supported by our results. Namely,
if the ratio of eye-types to gene duplication rate is similar in different clades, then a broader correlation may
exist.
Co-duplication of genes

We found that duplication and/or loss patterns in 15 of
22 gene families correlated significantly with duplication
and/or loss patterns in at least one other gene family,
significantly more than expected by chance (Figure 3C).
Interestingly, many of the genes we found to co-duplicate are not known to have any functional relationship
with each other. This suggests the possibility of novel
functional relationships between genes, at least in animals where the genetics are relatively unstudied (the
majority of our samples). Co-duplications may also be
the result of undiscovered constraints at the genomic
level (e.g. synteny), or an unknown systematic artifact of
our gene reconciliation analysis that infers that unrelated genes duplicate or are lost at particular nodes.
While new gene pairings were suggested by our coduplication analysis, some pairings predicted by functional modules were not found.
One functional module of particular interest is the
suite of phototransduction genes [31]. We found that
even though multiple ciliary phototransduction genes
are known to have co-duplicated early in vertebrate history [29,36,63], rhabdomeric phototransduction genes
have not co-duplicated as a unit when considering the
entire history of Metazoa. A notable exception is that Ropsin and Gq-alpha (genes known to interact directly)

Page 11 of 16

exhibit a significant pattern of co-duplication. This suggests that R-opsin and Gq-alpha have been a tightly
linked functional module throughout animal evolution,
and if so, specific R-opsin paralogs may be expressed
with specific Gq-alpha paralogs.
We also found that some phototransduction genes coduplicate with developmental genes (Figure 3). Some of
our data could represent novel genetic interactions, but
they could also stem from other unknown aspects of
these genes including the number of protein interactions, the number of functions a protein is involved in,
or genomic location. Although we tested the general
false-positive rate by generating randomized matrices of
our data, future studies might also compare the numbers of co-duplicating eye-genes to that of a set of genes
drawn at random that are not necessarily involved in
the same organ system.
Similarly, we found extensive co-duplication/loss
between only a few gene families known to be involved
in the same developmental pathway [19]. The retinal
determination pathway, for example, includes Pax6, Dac,
Eya and Six1/2, gene families known to have functional
interactions in disparate taxa [56]. From this pathway,
Pax6 and Dac had correlated loss patterns as did Eya
and Six1/2. Perhaps the functional relationship between
these gene pairs is more constrained than that of other
genes in the retinal determination network. Dac and
Pax6, for instance, are known to have a complex inductive relationship in both vertebrates and invertebrates
[56,64]. Other gene families with known interactions in
Drosophila compound eye development also showed
correlations in either their loss or gain patterns. These
include Hh and Eya [65], Dac and Dpp [66] and Six 1/2
and Eya [67]. However, the majority of genes with
known regulatory interactions in eye development did
not tend to be duplicated/lost together more often than
expected by chance. This finding - that the evolutionary
history of genes belonging to complete genetic modules
do not share similar patterns of gain and loss - is consistent with a functional study that found network
degeneration after genome duplication in yeast [68]. In
that study, genes that function together before genome
duplication do not necessarily function together after
genome duplication.

Conclusion
Our research provides new methodology for examining
genomic complexity in the context of morphological
complexity. In particular, we examined the evolutionary
histories of genes acting in arthropod eye development
and phototransduction to evaluate hypotheses of gene
and protein module duplication. The phylogenetic trees
we created lay a foundation for research into the gene
histories of several understudied, but developmentally

Rivera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/123

important, gene families. Future research will likely lead
to advances in understanding evolutionarily conserved
protein domains in these genes as well as the significance of the expansion of some families in particular
lineages (e.g. the Six1/2 family in the lineage leading to
the Helobdella robusta). Our analyses of these gene histories revealed that, by one analysis, genes involved in
eye development and phototransduction had higher
rates of duplication in the taxon with the largest number of eye types (pancrustaceans) (Table 3). Our
co-duplication analysis found higher than expected
numbers of co-duplicating genes, yet genes in known
genetic modules were not always found to be gained
and lost together (Figure 3). Moreover, some genes that
are not known to have extensive interactions did show
high correlation in loss and gain pattern. Future
research could clarify these findings, comparing the
genomic locations of co-duplicating genes in order to
identify synteny, identifying gene modules in the eyes of
non-model organisms, confirming the function of the
gene families in non-insect arthropods, and testing for
patterns consistent with positive selection acting on the
genes and modules of interest.

Methods
Overview

We first found all homologs of genes of interest in the
Daphnia pulex v1.0 genome. We next found all homologs in 18 other metazoan genomes. We constructed
phylogenies for each gene family using maximum likelihood. Assuming species-level relationships to be known,
we next reconciled each gene family tree with the
metazoan tree to estimate timing of gene duplication
and loss events. We then estimated rates of gene duplication within major metazoan clades. Finally, we tested
for significant correlation of gene duplication/loss patterns across gene families. Detailed methods for each of
these general steps are detailed below.
Daphnia pulex genome searches and gene family
assignment

With a protein sequence for each gene of interest from
FlyBase used as a “bait” sequence, Blastall searches were
performed, using protein sequences for each gene of
interest as a “bait” sequence, against all gene models of
Daphnia pulex v1.0 obtained from JGI [http://genome.
jgi-psf.org/Daphnia; http://wfleabase.org/]. Searches first
retrieved the top 15 hits, this number was raised in subsequent searches until D. pulex models outside the
group of interest were obtained. Redundant sequences
were determined by examining the visual scaffold model
on JGI and then removed by hand. The gene family for
each D. pulex gene was assigned by inclusion in a maximum likelihood tree using UniRef50 and UniRef90

Page 12 of 16

sequences. These trees were estimated using an inhouse pipeline of shell and perl scripts that merge existing bioinformatic tools. The bait sequence from FlyBase
was used to perform a similarity search using blastp [69]
of non-redundant protein databases curated by uniprot
http://www.uniprot.org/. In most cases, we used two
blast search strategies for each bait gene: 25/10 (where
the top 25 blast hits of the Uniref90 and the top 10
blast hits of the Uniref50 database were retained for
further analysis). In cases when there was either not
enough resolution or no outgroup hits obtained; more
hits were taken from the Uniref90 or Uniref50 databases, respectively (See Additional file 1 for details).
Identical sequences, such as those obtained from both
Uniref90 and Uniref50 databases, were removed from
further analysis. Second, all retained sequences and bait
were aligned using MUSCLE [70]. Third, we estimated
maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees using aLRTPHYML [71,72] assuming a JTT [73] model of protein
evolution. We visualized resulting phylogenetic trees
with TreeView [74,75] or FigTree http://tree.bio.ed.ac.
uk/software/figtree/. Where relevant, we tested whether
gene trees were significantly different from previous
trees using the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test [76]
implemented in PhyML [71,72] by comparing constrained trees to the best trees.
Pax-6 sequences

In phylogenetic analyses of Pax-6, we utilized previously
unpublished sequence data from Daphnia pulex (confirming the automated genome assemblies with cDNA
sequencing) and the ostracod crustacean Euphilomedes
carcharodonta. Euphilomedes carcharodonta were collected at the University of Southern California’s Wrigley
Marine Lab on Catalina Island, California by free diving,
collecting sediment with an aquarium net, and sorting
with a dissecting microscope. Daphnia pulex were
obtained from stock collections at Indiana University.
We first isolated Pax-6 fragments using degenerate PCR
primers to highly conserved regions in the paired and
homeo domains of published Pax-6 sequences. After
sequencing an initial Pax-6 fragment, we designed specific primers for 5’ and 3’ RACE, often using nested primers and the Gene Racer kit (Invitrogen). Primers and
cycling conditions are given in Additional File 3. Additional arthropod Pax-6 sequences were obtained from
GenBank.
Genome comparisons

With protein sequence for each gene of interest from
FlyBase, initial blastall searches were executed against
19 genomes obtained from JGI and NCBI (Table 1) with
parameters set to return five best hits with e values less
than 0.5. To ensure no paralogs were omitted, blastall

Rivera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:123
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/123

Page 13 of 16

searches were modified and repeated to allow more
returns in cases where all five best hits fell within the
in-group for the gene of interest in initial phyogenetic
analyses. Sequence alignment and maximum likelihood
estimates of gene trees were performed as described
above. Genes were identified phylogenetically as monophyletic ingroups sharing conserved domain architecture
using Pfam databases and NCBI’s Conserved Domain
Database [77,78] (See Additional File 1 for details). With
outgroups identified and pruned from the alignment,
each gene tree was reconstructed and then reconciled to
the metazoan species tree [79] using NOTUNG [80].
Rearrangements were allowed for node supports below
0.9 in order to minimize the inferred number of gene
duplication and loss events implied by poorly supported
nodes.
Duplication pattern analysis

We estimated rates of gene duplication while normalizing for overall evolutionary time using three different
denominators. Total numbers of duplications of genes
along each branch of a species tree were estimated
using data from the reconciled tree analysis (Figures 1,
2). For each phylogenetic group, the numbers of duplications along each branch falling within the group were

added together, to get a total number of duplications
within a clade. Caenorhabditis elegans-specific duplications were added to Lophotrochozoa-specific duplications to get a total duplications value for “nonarthropod protostomes.” Ciona intestinalis, Branchiostoma floridae, and Nematostella vectensis were not
included in this analysis. To estimate total numbers of
gene duplications and losses during animal evolution,
we used EvolMAP software [41], which estimates the
gene content of hypothetical ancestral species relative to
evolutionary transitions marked by speciation events.
EvolMAP uses an assumed species tree, performs pairwise similarity comparisons of all genes, and assumes
that gene families cannot be gained independently in
separate lineages. Second, we used EvolMAP to calculate
average ortholog divergence, here termed “genetic distance”, see [41] for details on the calculation. Third, we
normalized gene duplication rates using clade age estimates from molecular clock studies [42,43].
To examine co-duplication, two methods were used.
First, data matrices were created representing the number of losses or duplications for each gene along each
branch of a species tree using the data from reconciled
tree analysis (Figures 1, 2). Gene patterns were compared in the loss and gain cases separately by examining

assumed species phylogeny (see Methods for details). Circles represent gene duplication events; different shades represent different gene
families. B) Gene duplication data illustrated in matrix form. Rows are gene families (G1-G21) columns are branches on the phylogeny (B1-B36).
Gene duplication events are represented in the matrix as a 1, absence of gene duplications on branches are represented as 0. C) All pair-wise
comparisons were made between gene families (rows). P-values were calculated using Spearman’s rho [82]. The number of significantly similar
gene family pairs is represented in this panel (see Methods). D) To test whether the observed number of significantly co-duplicating gene family
pairs could be due to chance, we next shuffled each row of the data matrix (G1S-G21S), thus randomizing the gene duplication events on the
tree. In this way, we created 1000 shuffled matrices. E) Using the shuffled matrices (D), we calculated p-values for the similarity of each pairwise
comparison of shuffled matrix rows. The number of significantly similar rows was counted for each of the 1000 shuffled matrices to form a null
distribution (Fig 4C), to which the observed value was compared.

correlation using Spearman’s rho implemented in R with
p-values calculated using Algorithm AS 89, a test of
upper tail probability [81,82]. The second method used
the same methodology comparing duplication and loss
patterns together by looking at the number of duplications minus the number of losses for each gene along
each branch of the species tree. Significance of correlation was assessed using sequential Bonferroni to accommodate multiple comparisons [83,84]. A null
distribution for the expected number of co-duplicating
gene family pairs was created by randomizing the data
matrix 1000 times and analyzing each pseudoreplicate in
R (Figure 4).
