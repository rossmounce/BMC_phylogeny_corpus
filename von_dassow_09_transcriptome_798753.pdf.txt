Abstract
Background: Eukaryotes are classified as either haplontic, diplontic, or haplo-diplontic, depending
on which ploidy levels undergo mitotic cell division in the life cycle. Emiliania huxleyi is one of the
most abundant phytoplankton species in the ocean, playing an important role in global carbon
fluxes, and represents haptophytes, an enigmatic group of unicellular organisms that diverged early
in eukaryotic evolution. This species is haplo-diplontic. Little is known about the haploid cells, but
they have been hypothesized to allow persistence of the species between the yearly blooms of
diploid cells. We sequenced over 38,000 expressed sequence tags from haploid and diploid E.
huxleyi normalized cDNA libraries to identify genes involved in important processes specific to each
life phase (2N calcification or 1N motility), and to better understand the haploid phase of this
prominent haplo-diplontic organism.
Results: The haploid and diploid transcriptomes showed a dramatic differentiation, with
approximately 20% greater transcriptome richness in diploid cells than in haploid cells and only ≤
50% of transcripts estimated to be common between the two phases. The major functional
category of transcripts differentiating haploids included signal transduction and motility genes.
Diploid-specific transcripts included Ca2+, H+, and HCO3- pumps. Potential factors differentiating
the transcriptomes included haploid-specific Myb transcription factor homologs and an unusual
diploid-specific histone H4 homolog.
Conclusions: This study permitted the identification of genes likely involved in diploid-specific
biomineralization, haploid-specific motility, and transcriptional control. Greater transcriptome
richness in diploid cells suggests they may be more versatile for exploiting a diversity of rich
environments whereas haploid cells are intrinsically more streamlined.

Background

Coccolithophores are unicellular marine phytoplankton that
strongly influence carbonate chemistry and sinking carbon
fluxes in the modern ocean due to the calcite plates (coccoliths) that are produced in intracellular vacuoles and extruded
onto the cell surface [1]. Coccolithophores are members of the
Haptophyta [2,3], a basal-branching division of eukaryotes
with still uncertain phylogenetic relationships with other
major lineages of this domain [4,5]. Intricately patterned coccoliths accumulated in marine sediments over the past 220
million years have left one of the most complete fossil records,
providing an exceptional tool for evolutionary reconstruction
and biostratigraphic dating [3]. Coccolith calcification also
represents a potential source of nanotechnological innovation. Fossil records indicate that Emiliania huxleyi arose only
approximately 270,000 years ago [6], yet this single morphospecies is now the most abundant and cosmopolitan coccolithophore, seasonally forming massive blooms reaching over
107 cells l-1 in temperate and sub-polar waters [7]. Many studies are being conducted to determine how the on-going
anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 increases affect E. huxleyi
calcification, with conflicting results [8,9]. Because of its
environmental prominence and ease of maintenance in laboratory culture, E. huxleyi has become the model coccolithophore for physiological, molecular, genomic and
environmental studies, and a draft genome assembly of one
strain, CCMP1516, is now being analyzed [10]. However, coccolithophorid biology still is in its infancy.
E. huxleyi exhibits a haplo-diplontic life cycle, alternating
between calcified, non-motile, diploid (2N) cells and non-calcified, motile, haploid (1N) cells, with both phases being capable of unlimited asexual cell division [11,12]. Almost all
laboratory and environmental studies on this species have
focused only on 2N cells, and lack of information about the
ecophysiology and biochemistry of 1N cells represents a large
knowledge gap in understanding the biology and evolution of
E. huxleyi and coccolithophores. More generally, a major
question remaining in understanding eukaryotic life cycle
evolution is the evolutionary maintenance of haplo-diplontic
life cycles in a broad diversity of eukaryotes [13,14], and E.
huxleyi represents a prominent organism in which new
insights might be gained.
E. huxleyi 1N cells are very distinct from both calcified and
non-calcified 2N cells in ultrastructure [12] and ecophysiological properties [15]. 1N cells have two flagella and associated flagellar bases, whereas 2N cells completely lack both
flagella and flagellar bases. The coccolith-forming apparatus
is present in both calcified and naked-mutants of 2N cells but
is absent in 1N cells [7]. 1N cells are also differentiated from
2N cells by formation of particular non-mineralized organic
body scales (and thus are not 'naked') [7,11]. 1N cells show different growth preferences relative to 2N cells [16] and do not
have the exceptional ability to adapt to high light exhibited by
2N cells [15]. As 1N cells of E. huxleyi are not recognizable by

classic microscope techniques, little is yet known about their
ecological distribution. Recent advances in fluorescent in situ
hybridization now allow detection of non-calcified E. huxleyi
cells in the environment [17], although it is still impossible to
distinguish 1N cells from non-calcified 2N cells. However, 1N
cells of certain other coccolithophore species are recognizable
due to the production of distinct holococcolith structures and
appear to have a shallower depth distribution and preference
for oligotrophic waters compared to 2N cells of the same species [18]. Recently, E. huxleyi 1N cells were demonstrated to
be resistant to the EhV viruses that are lethal to 2N cells and
are involved in terminating massive blooms of 2N cells in
nature [19]. This suggests that 1N cells might have a crucial
role in the long-term maintenance of E. huxleyi populations
by serving as the link for survival between the yearly 'boom
and bust' successions of 2N blooms.
The pronounced differences between 1N and 2N cells suggest
a large difference in gene expression between the two sexual
stages. In this study, we conducted a comparison of the 1N
and 2N transcriptomes in order to: test the prediction that
expression patterns are, to a large extent, ploidy level specific;
identify a set of core genes expressed in both life cycle phases;
identify genes involved in important cellular processes known
to be specific to one phase or the other (for example, motility
for 1N cells and calcification for 2N cells); provide insights
into transcriptional/epigenetic controls on phase-specific
gene expression; and provide the basis for the development of
molecular tools allowing the detection of 1N cells in nature.
For our analysis we selected isogenic cultures originating
from strain RCC1216 because strain CCMP1516, from which
the genome sequence will be available, has not been observed
to produce flagellated 1N cells. Pure clonal 1N cultures
(RCC1217) originating from RCC1216 have been stable for
several years and can be compared to pure 2N cultures originating from the same genetic background [15,16]. We produced separate normalized cDNA libraries from pure axenic
1N and 2N cultures. Over 19,000 expressed sequence tag
(EST) sequences were obtained from each library. Interlibrary comparison revealed major compositional differences
between the two transcriptomes, and we confirmed the predicted ploidy phase-specific expression for some genes by
reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR).

Results
Strain origins and characteristics at time of harvesting
E. huxleyi strains RCC1216 (2N) and RCC1217 (1N) were both
originally isolated into clonal culture less than 10 years prior
to the collection of biological material in this study (Table 1).
Repeated analyses of nuclear DNA content by flow cytometry
have shown no detectable variation in the DNA contents (the
ploidy) of these strains over several years ([20] and unpublished tests performed in 2006 to 2008). Axenic cultures of
both 1N and 2N strains were successfully prepared.

The growth rates of the 2N and 1N cultures used for library
construction were 0.843 ± 0.028 day-1 (n = 4) and 0.851 ±
0.004 day-1 (n = 2), respectively. These rates were not significantly different (P = 0.70). Two other 1N cultures experienced
exposure to continuous light for one or two days prior to harvesting due to a failure of the lighting system. The growth rate
of these 1N cultures was 0.893 ± 0.008 day-1 (n = 2). These
cultures were not used for library construction but were
included in RT-PCR tests. Flow cytometric profiles and
microscopic examination taken during harvesting indicated
that nearly 100% of 2N cells were highly calcified (indicated
by high side scatter) and that no calcified cells were present in
the 1N cultures [21] (Figure 1). No motile cells were seen in
extensive microscopic examination of 2N cultures over a
period of 3 months. 1N cells were highly motile, and displayed
prominent phototaxis in culture vessels (not shown).
Both 1N and 2N cultures maintained high photosynthetic efficiency measured by maximum quantum yield of photosytem
II (Fv/Fm) throughout the day-night period of harvesting.
The Fv/Fm of phased 1N cultures was 0.652 ± 0.009 over the
whole 24-h period; it was slightly higher during the dark
(0.661 ± 0.003) than during the light period (0.644 ± 0.001;
P = 9.14 × 10-5). The Fv/Fm of 2N cells was 0.675 ± 0.007,
with no significant variation between the light and dark periods. These data suggest that both the 1N and 2N cells were
maintained in a healthy state throughout the entire period of
harvesting.
Cell division was phased to the middle of the dark period both
in 2N cultures and in the 1N cultures on the correct light-dark
cycle (Figure S1 in Additional data file 1). The 1N cultures
exposed to continuous light did not show phased cell division.
Nuclear extraction from the phased 1N cultures showed that
cells remained predominantly in G1 phase throughout the
day, entered S phase 1 h after dusk (lights off), and reached
the maximum in G2 phase at 3 to 4 h into the dark phase (Figure 2). A small G2 peak was present in the morning hours and
disappeared in the late afternoon. These data show that we
successfully captured all major changes in the diel and cell

cycle of actively growing, physiologically healthy 1N and 2N
cells for library construction (below).

Global characterization of haploid and diploid
transcriptomes
General features, comparison to existing EST datasets, and analysis
of transcriptome complexity and differentiation
High quality total RNA was obtained from eight time points
in the diel cycle (Figure S2 in Additional data file 1) and
pooled for cDNA construction. We performed two rounds of
5'-end sequencing. In the first round, 9,774 and 9,734 cDNA
clones were sequenced from the 1N and 2N libraries, respectively. In the second round, additional 9,758 1N and 9,825 2N
clones were selected for sequencing. Altogether our sequencing yielded 19,532 1N and 19,559 2N reads for a total of 39,091
reads (from 39,091 clones). Following quality control, we
finally obtained 38,386 high quality EST sequences ≥ 50
nucleotides in length (19,198 for 1N and 19,188 for 2N). The
average size of the trimmed ESTs was 582 nucleotides with a
maximum of 897 nucleotides (Table 2). Their G+C content
(65%) was identical to that observed for ESTs from E. huxleyi
strain CCMP1516 [22], and was consistent with the high
genomic G+C content (approximately 60%) of E. huxleyi.
Sequence similarity searches between the 1N and 2N EST
libraries revealed that only approximately 60% of ESTs in one
library were represented in the other library. More precisely,
56 to 59% of 1N ESTs had similar sequences (≥ 95% identity)
in the 2N EST library, and 59 to 62% of the 2N ESTs had similar sequences in the 1N EST library, with the range depending on the minimum length of BLAT alignment (100
nucleotides or 50 nucleotides). To qualify this overlap
between the 1N and 2N libraries, we constructed two artificial
sets of ESTs by first pooling the ESTs from both libraries and
then re-dividing them into two sets based on the time of
sequencing (that is, the first and the second rounds). Based
on the same similarity search criteria, a larger overlap (73 to
79%) was found between the two artificial sets than between
the 1N and 2N EST sets. Given the fact that our cDNA libraries
were normalized towards uniform sampling of cDNA species,

this result already indicates the existence of substantial differences between the 1N and 2N transcriptomes in our culture
conditions.
Sequence similarity search further revealed an even smaller
overlap between the ESTs from RCC1216/RCC1217 and the
ESTs from other diploid strains of different geographic origins (CCMP1516, B morphotype, originating from near the

with the predominantly diploid nature of the CCMP1516 and
CCMP371 strains at the time of EST generation. When the
best alignment was considered for each EST, the average
sequence identity between strains was close to 100% (that is,
99.7% between RCC1216/RCC1217 and CCMP1516, 99.6%
between RCC1216/RCC1217 and CCMP371, and 99.5%
between CCMP1516 and CCMP371), being much higher than
the similarity cutoff (≥ 95% identity) used in the BLAT
searches. The average sequence identity between RCC1216
(2N) and RCC1217 (1N) was 99.9%. Thus, sequence divergence between strains (or alleles) was unlikely to be the major
cause of the limited level of overlap between these EST sets. A
large fraction of our EST datasets thus likely provides formerly inaccessible information on E. huxleyi transcriptomes.

Venn diagram showing the degree of overlap existing E. huxleyi EST
libraries. Included are the libraries analyzed in this study (1N RCC1217
and 2N RCC1216, combined) and the two other publicly available EST
libraries (CCMP 1516 and CCMP371). ESTs were considered matching
based on BLAT criteria of an alignment length of ≥ 100 nucleotides and ≥
95% identity. The degrees of overlap increased only very modestly when
the BLAT criteria were relaxed to an alignment length of ≥ 50 nucleotides.

One of the primary objectives of this study was to estimate the
extent to which the change in ploidy affects the transcriptome. Therefore, we utilized for the following analyses only
the ESTs from RCC1216 (2N) and RCC1217 (1N), originating
from cultures of pure ploidy state and identical physiological
conditions. The 38,386 ESTs from 1N and 2N libraries were
found to represent 16,470 consensus sequences (mini-clusters), which were further grouped into 13,056 clusters (Table
3; Additional data file 2 includes a list of all ESTs with the
clusters and mini-clusters to which they are associated and
their EMBL accession numbers). Of the 13,056 clusters, only
3,519 (26.9%) were represented by at least one EST from each
of the two libraries, thus defining a tentative 'core set' of EST
clusters expressed in both cell types. The remaining clusters
were exclusively composed of EST(s) from either the 1N
(4,368 clusters) or the 2N (5,169 clusters) library; hereafter,
we denote these clusters as '1N-unique' and '2N-unique' clusters, respectively. Cluster size (that is, the number of ESTs per
cluster) varied from 1 (singletons) up to 43, and displayed a
negative exponential rank-size distribution for both libraries
(Figure S3 in Additional data file 1). The Shannon diversity
indices were found close to the theoretical maximum for both
libraries, indicating a high evenness in coverage and successful normalization in our cDNA library construction (Table 4).
Crucially, the fact that the rank-size distributions of the two
libraries were essentially identical also shows that the normalization process occurred comparably in both libraries
(Figure S3 in Additional data file 1).
Interestingly, a larger number of singletons was obtained
from the 2N library (3,704 singletons, 19% of 2N ESTs) than
from the 1N library (2,651 singletons, 14% of 1N ESTs), suggesting that 2N cells may express more genes (that is, RNA
species) than 1N cells. To test this hypothesis, we assessed
transcriptome richness (that is, the total number of mRNA
species) of 1N and 2N cells using a maximum likelihood (ML)
estimate [23] and the Chao1 richness estimator [24]. These
estimates indicated that 2N cells express 19 to 24% more
genes than 1N cells under the culture conditions in this study,
supporting the larger transcriptomic richness for 2N relative
to 1N (Table 4). To assess the above-mentioned small overlap
between the 1N and 2N EST sets, we computed the abundance-based Jaccard similarity index between the two sam-

ples based on our clustering data. This index provides an
estimate for the true probability with which two randomly
chosen transcripts, one from each of the two libraries, both
correspond to genes expressed in both cell types (to take into
account that further sampling of each library would likely
increase the number of shared clusters because coverage is
less than 100%). From our samples, this index was estimated
to be 50.6 ± 0.9% and again statistically supports a large transcriptomic difference between the haploid and diploid life
cycles.

Functional difference between life stages
In the NCBI eukarote orthologous group (KOG) database,
3,286 clusters (25.2%) had significant sequence similarity to
protein sequence families (Additional data file 3 provides a
list of all clusters with their top homologs identified in UniProt, Swiss-Prot, and KOG, and also the number of component mini-clusters and ESTs from each library). Of these
KOG-matched clusters, 2,253 were associated with 1N ESTs
(1,385 shared core clusters plus 868 1N-unique clusters), and
2,418 were associated with 2N ESTs (1,385 shared core clusters plus 1,033 2N-unique clusters). The distributions of the

number of clusters across different KOG functional classes
were generally similar among the 1N-unique, the 2N-unique
and the shared core clusters, with exceptions in several KOG
classes (Figure 4a). The 'signal transduction mechanisms'
and 'cytoskeleton' classes were significantly over-represented
(12.3% and 4.15%) in the 1N-unique clusters relative to the
2N-unique clusters (7.36% and 1.55%) (P < 0.002; Fisher's
exact test, without correction for multiple tests). These
classes were also less abundant in the shared clusters (6.06%
and 2.02%) compared to the 1N-unique clusters (P = 3.49 ×
10-7 for 'signal transduction mechanisms'; P = 0.00395 for
'cytoskeleton'). In contrast, the 'translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis' class was significantly under-represented (3.69%) in the 1N-unique clusters compared to the
2N-unique (6.97%) and the shared clusters (7.58%). Similar
differences were observed when the 1N-unique and 2Nunique sets were further restricted to clusters containing two
or more ESTs (Figure S4 in Additional data file 1).
We used Audic and Claverie's method [25] to rank individual
EST clusters based on the significance of differential representation in 1N versus 2N libraries. An arbitrarily chosen

The maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of transcriptome richness was calculated following Claverie [23] using the two separate rounds of EST
sequencing. The Chao1 estimator of transcriptome richness and the Shannon diversity index was computed for each library separately and for the
combined library using EstimateS with the classic formula for Chao1. The range of estimated coverage was calculated by dividing the number of
clusters observed by the two estimates of transcriptome richness. The similarity of content of the 1N and 2N libraries was also determined: the
Chao abundance-based estimator of the Jaccard similarity index (accounting for estimated proportions of unseen shared and unique transcripts) was
0.506 ± 0.009, calculated with 200 bootstrap replicates and the upper abundance limit for rare or infrequent transcript species set at 2. The
maximum possible Shannon diversity index was calculated as the natural log of the number of clusters.

Distributions of clusters over KOG class for clusters shared between the

was used to determine significant differences in the distribution of clusters
by KOG class between the 1N-unique and 2N-unique sets (asterisks
indicate the KOG classes exhibiting significant differences between the
1N-unique and 2N-unique sets); P < 0.002 without correction for multiple

and both 1N-unique and 2N-unique clusters (the at symbol (@) indicates
KOG classes exhibiting significant differences between the 1N-unique and

threshold of P < 0.01 provided a list of 220 clusters predicted
to be specific to 1N (Additional data file 4) and a list of 110
clusters predicted to be specific to 2N (Additional data file 5).
A major caveat is that normalization tends to reduce the confidence in determining differentially expressed genes
between cells. As a first step to examine the prediction, we
were particularly interested in transcripts that may be effectively absent in one life phase but not the other. Namely, we
focused on 198 (90.0%) that are specific and unique to 1N as
well as 89 (80.9%) clusters that are specific and unique to 2N,
which we termed 'highly 1N-specific' (Tables 5 and 6; Additional data file 4) and 'highly 2N-specific' clusters (Tables 7
and 8; Additional data file 5).
The most significantly differentially represented highly 1Nspecific clusters (P = 10-9~10-4) included a homolog of histone
H4 (cluster GS09138; 1N ESTs = 13 versus 2N ESTs = 0), a
homolog of cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II regulatory subunit (GS00910; 1N = 14 versus 2N = 0), a transcript
encoding a DNA-6-adenine-methyltransferase (Dam)
domain (GS02990) and four other clusters of unknown functions. Other predicted highly 1N-specific clusters included
several flagellar components, and three clusters showing
homology to the Myb transcription factor superfamily
(GS00117, GS00273, GS01762; 1N = 8, 8, and 6 ESTs, respectively, and 2N = 0 in all cases). The most significantly differentially represented highly 2N-specific clusters (P = 10-7~104) included a cluster of unknown function (GS11002; 1N = 0
and 2N = 16) and a weak homolog of a putative E. huxleyi arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (E-value 2 × 10-6). Of the 199
highly 1N-specific clusters, 40 had homologs in the KOG
database, including 9 clusters (22.5%) assigned to the 'posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones'
class and 10 (25.0%) assigned to the 'signal transduction
mechanisms' class. The KOG classes for the 22 2N-specific
clusters with KOG matches appeared more evenly distributed, with slightly more abundance in the 'signal transduction
mechanisms' class (4 clusters, 18.2%). As discussed in the
'Validation and exploration of the predicted differential
expression of selected genes' section of the Results, RT-PCR
tests validated these predictions of differential expression
with a high rate of success.

Taxonomic distribution of transcript homology varies over the life
cycle
To characterize the taxonomic distribution of the homologs of
EST clusters, we performed BLASTX searches against a combined database, which includes the proteomes from 42
selected eukaryotic genomes taken from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (see Additional data file 6 for a list of selected genomes from the KEGG
database) as well as prokaryotic/viral sequences from the
UniProt database. There were 4,055 clusters (31.1%; 1,731
shared, 1,083 1N-unique and 1,241 2N-unique clusters) with
significant homology in the database (E-value <1 × 10-10),
with Viridiplantae, stramenopiles, and metazoans receiving

Only clusters with zero ESTs originating from the 2N library are shown. The number of 1N EST reads in each cluster and the P-value for significance
of the difference between libraries are shown. When no Swiss-Prot homolog was detected, ID and homology values for the top Uniprot homolog
are given (indicated by an asterisk), or the CDD name and homology values are given (indicated by †). Clusters are arranged by KOG class. Clusters
in bold were chosen for RT-PCR validation. Additional data file 4 gives a complete list of all clusters predicted to be 1N-specific by statistical
comparison of libraries.

the largest numbers of hits (72.1%, 66.4%, and 60.9%, respectively, of all clusters with KEGG hits). These clusters were
classified by the taxonomic group of their closest BLAST
homolog (that is, 'best hit'). The distribution of the taxonomic
group was found to substantially vary among the shared, 1Nunique and 2N-unique clusters. Shared clusters had a significantly higher proportion of best hits to stramenopiles compared to both 1N-unique and 2N-unique clusters, while 1Nunique clusters had a significantly lower percentage of best
hits to stramenopiles than 2N-unique clusters. In contrast,
metazoans received a significantly greater portion of best hits
from 1N-unique than from 2N-unique and shared clusters.
Consistent with the above functional analysis, the KOG class
'signal transduction mechanisms' was over-represented in
clusters best-hitting to metazoans (11.0%) compared to all
clusters with homologs in KEGG (5.0%) or clusters best-hitting to Viridiplantae (4.8%) (P = 2.9 × 10-13 and 5.0 × 10-6,
respectively; Fishers exact test). There was no difference
among 1N-unique, 2N-unique, and shared clusters in the proportion of clusters with best hits to Viridiplantae (Figure 5).
However, among the Viridiplantae best hits, a significantly
greater proportion of 1N-unique clusters was found to be
best-hitting to Chlamydonomas reinhardtii (Figure 5), the
only free-living motile, haploid genome from Viridiplantae
represented in our database.

Of all clusters best-hitting to either Viridiplantae, stramenopiles, or metazoans, the shared clusters had the highest percentage of clusters (53.6%) with homologs in all three groups,
and the lowest percentage of clusters (3.1%) with homologs
only in metazoans (Figure S5 in Additional data file 1). Clusters with homologs in stramenopiles were significantly overrepresented among shared clusters and under-represented in
1N-unique clusters relative to 2N-unique clusters.
The vast majority (7,442 clusters; 57.0%) of the total EST
clusters were orphans (Figure 6a). One of the main causes of
the high orphan proportion might be the presence of many
short EST clusters with only one or a few ESTs. The nonorphan clusters (having matches in UniProt, KOG, or the conserved domains database (CDD)) exhibited a significantly
higher average number of reads per cluster (3.67, combining
reads from both libraries) than orphan clusters (2.39; P <
0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). In a similar way, the orphan
proportion decreased to 39.4% for the shared core clusters
(Figure 6b), which have an average of 6.25 ESTs per cluster.
However, a more detailed analysis indicated that the size of
clusters (that is, the number of ESTs in the cluster) may not
be the sole reason for the abundance of the orphan clusters.
For instance, 58.6% of 1N-unique clusters with two or more
ESTs were orphan clusters (Figure 6c). Furthermore, an even
higher orphan proportion (63.9%) was obtained when these
1N-unique clusters were limited to the 119 clusters repre-

also obtained for the 2N-unique clusters (56.3% for the clusters with ≥ 2 ESTs (Figure 6d), and 55.0% for the 60 clusters
with ≥ 7 ESTs.). Overall, these results suggest that our transcriptomic data include many new genes probably unique to
haptophytes, coccolithophores or E. huxleyi, and that many

of these unique genes may be preferentially expressed in one
of the two life cycle phases.

those for proteins known to also serve functions in the cell
body may also be expressed in non-motile cells. Thus, flagella-related genes serve as a particularly useful initial validation step. Next, we examined several other clusters with
strong in silico signals for differential expression between the
1N and 2N libraries. Finally, we explored clusters homologous
to known Ca2+ and H+ transporters, potentially involved in
the calcification process of 2N cells, and histones, which
might play roles in epigenetic control of 1N versus 2N differentiation. In total, we tested the predicted expression patterns of 39 clusters representing 38 different genes. The
predicted expression pattern (1N-specific, 2N-specific, or
shared) was confirmed for 37 clusters (36 genes), demonstrating a high rate of success of the in silico comparison of
transcriptome content.

The taxonomic distribution of homology. Shown are the percentages of

the taxonomic group differs between 1N-unique and 2N-unique (asterisks)
or between 1N-unique and shared clusters (at symbol (@)), tested as
above. The inset shows the proportion of all assigned clusters that are
accounted for by best-hits to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (a subset of those
which are best-hits to Viridiplantae). The differences between 1N-unique
and 2N-unique, and between 1N-unique and shared clusters were
significant (P < 0.002).

Validation and exploration of the predicted differential
expression of selected genes
We examined how well our in silico comparison of the two
normalized libraries successfully identified gene content differentiating the two transcriptomes based on in-depth
sequence/bibliographic analysis and RT-PCR assays (summarized in Tables S1 and S2 in Additional data file 7). We
began with homologs of eukaryotic flagellar-associated proteins. This large group of proteins is well-conserved across
motile eukaryotes. Genes for proteins known to be exclusively
present in flagellar or basal bodies are expected to be specifically expressed in the motile 1N stage of E. huxleyi, whereas

A total of 156 E. huxleyi EST clusters were found to be homologous to 85 flagellar-related or basal body-related proteins
from animals or C. reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga serving as a model organism for studies of eukaryotic flagella/cilia
[26-28] (Tables 9 and 10). This analysis combined a systematic BLAST searche using 100 C. reinhardtii motility-related
proteins identified by classic biochemical analysis [27] with
additional homology searches (detailed analysis provided in
Additional data files 8 and 9). Of the 100 C. reinhardtii proteins, 64 were found to have one or more similar sequences in
the E. huxleyi EST dataset. We could also identify homologs
for six of the nine Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) proteins
known to be basal body components [29,30]. Excluding 64
clusters closely related to proteins known to play additional
roles outside the flagellum/basal body (such as actin and calmodulin) and 10 clusters showing a relatively low level of
sequence similarity to flagellar-related proteins, 82 of the 156
clusters were considered highly specific to motility. Remarkably, these clusters were found to be represented by 252 ESTs
from the 1N but 0 ESTs from the 2N library (Table 9). In contrast, clusters related to proteins with known possible roles
outside of flagella tended to be composed of ESTs from both
1N and 2N libraries, as expected (Table 10).
The abundance of 1N-unique EST clusters with the closest
homolog in Metazoa (Figure 5) appears to be partially due to
the expression of genes related to flagellar components in 1N
cells. In fact, 58 (37.2%) of the 156 motility-related clusters
had best-hits to Metazoa in the KEGG database, compared to
only 789 (14.1%) of all 5,614 non-orphan clusters (P = 2.9 ×
10-13).
Six core structural components of the flagellar apparatus
were chosen for RT-PCR tests (Figure 7). These included
three flagellar dynein heavy chain (DHC) paralogs (GS00667,
GS02579 and GS00012), a homolog of the outer dynein arm
docking complex protein ODA-DC3 (GS04411), a homolog of
FAP189 and FAP58/MBO2, highly conserved but poorly
characterized coiled-coil proteins identified in the C. rein-

hardti flagellar proteome [27] (GS02724), and a homolog of
the highly conserved basal body protein BBS5 (GS00844)
[31]. All showed expression restricted to 1N cells; no signal
could be detected for these five clusters in any 2N RNA samples. Curiously, three non-overlapping primer sets designed
to GS000844 (BBS5) all detected evidence of incompletely
spliced transcript products, suggesting its regulation by alternative splicing.
GS05223, containing three ESTs from the 1N library and
none from the 2N, showed a significant sequence similarity to
C. reinhardtii minus and plus agglutinins (BLASTX, E-values
3 × 10-5 and 8 × 10-6, respectively), flagellar associated proteins involved in sexual adhesion [32]. RT-PCR confirmed
that expression of GS05223 was highly specific to 1N cells,
being undetectable in 2N cells (Figure 7). However, inspection of the BLASTX alignment between GS05223 and C. reinhardtii agglutinins revealed that the sequence similarity was
associated with the translation of the reverse-complement of
GS05223. We also found that all of the three ESTs in
GS05223 contained poly-A tails, so must be expressed in the
forward direction. Therefore, we concluded that GS05223
represents an unknown haploid-specific gene product that
may not be related to flagellar functions.

Next we investigated four clusters that are homologous to
proteins known to often have additional, non-flagellar roles
in the cytoplasm, but that were represented only in the 1N
library. Two clusters (GS02889 and GS03135) displayed
homology to cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (DHC), which is
associated with flagella/cilia due to its role in intraflagellar
transport. In animals and amoebozoa, it also has non-flagellar functions such as intracellular transport and cell division
[33]; however, both clusters showed potential 1N-specific
expression, being represented by two and five 1N ESTs and
zero 2N ESTs, respectively, and RT-PCR confirmed the predicted highly 1N-specific expression pattern (Figure 7).
The flagellar-related clusters included five homologs of phototropin. In C. reinharditii, phototropin is found associated
with the flagellum and plays a role in light-dependent gamete
differentiation [34]. However, phototropin is a light sensor
involved in the chloroplast-avoidance response in higher
plants [35], so can have roles outside the flagellum. Clusters
GS00132, GS01923, and GS00920 showed the highest similarities to the C. reinharditii phototoropin sequence (E-values 1 × 10-22, 1 × 10-21, and 1 × 10-22, respectively) and were all
only represented in the 1N library (four, four, and three ESTs,
respectively). In contrast, GS04170, which showed weaker

The numbers of homologous clusters containing ESTs originating from 1N and 2N libraries are shown. Also shown are numbers of component ESTs
from 1N and 2N libraries. Potential 'false positive' homologs were identified (for example, clusters with stronger homology to non-flagellar proteins).
In such cases, the numerator represents the number of clusters or ESTs including potential false positive clusters, and the denominator when false
positive clusters are excluded. Detailed analysis of all motility-related clusters is provided in Additional data files 7 and 8.

homology to phototropins (E-value 3 × 10-9), was represented
by four ESTs in the 2N library and zero from the 1N library.
These four clusters all aligned well over the highly conserved
LOV2 (light, oxygen, or voltage) domains [35,36] of C. reinhardtii and Arabidopsis thaliana phototropins (Figure S7 in
Additional data file 1). The fifth phototropin homolog,
GS01944, was represented by ESTs from both libraries.
GS01944 did not correspond to the LOV2 domain. GS00132
and GS00920 were selected for RT-PCR validation, which
confirmed that expression of these clusters was indeed highly
restricted to 1N cells (Figure 7), as predicted by in silico comparison of the two libraries.

Use of digital subtraction to identify other 1N- or 2N-specific
transcripts

We found that several of the selected flagellar-related EST
clusters (GS00012, GS04411, GS00844, GS00132 and
GS00920) showed a strongly diminished RT-PCR signal in
the samples collected during the time of S-phase (Figure 7).
Because many genes tested in this study did not display this
pattern (for example, GS00217, GS00508, and GS00234), it
might be due to real differences in the circadian timing of
flagellar gene expression.

1N-specific conserved flagellar-related cluster and 1N-specific
possible signal transduction clusters

Fourteen of the 199 clusters predicted to be highly 1N-specific
and 10 of the 89 clusters predicted to be highly 2N-specific
were tested by RT-PCR (Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8; Tables S1 and S2
in Additional data file 7). Twenty-three out of these 24 clusters did show the predicted strong phase-specific expression
pattern, confirming that in silico subtraction of the two libraries identifies true phase-specific transcripts with a high success rate. Two (the DHC homologs GS00667 and GS00012)
were discussed previously and the remaining 22 are discussed
in this and the following sections.

GS00242 had a moderate level of sequence similarity to the C.
reinhardtii predicted protein A8J798 (E-value 4 × 10-14) and
the human spermatogenesis-associated protein SPT17 (Evalue 8 × 10-11). Although A8J798 is not among the previously
confirmed flagellar protein components listed in Table S3 of
Pazour et al. [27], these authors identified peptides derived
from A8J798 in the C. reinhardtii flagellar proteome (listed
as C-6350001). GS00242 was composed of eight 1N ESTs and
zero 2N ESTs. We confirmed by RT-PCR that GS00242 could

because it had the highest homology to known Myb proteins
(Gallus gallus c-Myb transcription factor; E-value 3 × 10-34).
The amino acid sequence derived from GS00273 was readily
aligned over the conserved R2-R3 DNA binding regions of
Myb family members [37] (Figure S9 in Additional data file

Cluster GS02894 displayed a sequence similarity to the E.
huxleyi 'glutamic acid-proline-alanine' coccolith-associated
glycoprotein (GPA) (E-value 7 × 10-7) and was represented by
six ESTs from the 1N library and zero from the 2N library. RTPCR confirmed that GS02894 was highly differentially
expressed in 1N cells (Figure 8). Through visual inspection of
alignment, we found that GS02894 in fact was aligned poorly
with the GPA sequence (Figure S10 in Additional data file 1)
and that the alignment did not cover the Ca2+-binding loops
of the EF-hand motifs previously identified in GPA. GS02894
thus represents a haploid-specific gene product of unknown
function.

GS01257 and GS01805 were orphan clusters highly represented in the 1N library by 25 and 16 ESTs and none in the 2N
library in either case (P = 1.50 × 10-8 and 7.66 × 10-6, respectively). RT-PCR confirmed that both showed highly 1N-specific expression patterns (Figure 8). Both of these clusters
showed multiple stop codons in every reading frame, the
longest open reading frames on the forward strand being 36
and 35 codons, respectively (not shown). They might represent long 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes that could

GS02941, represented by nine 2N ESTs and zero 1N ESTs,
was homologous to the SNARE protein family syntaxin-1
involved in vesicle fusion during exocytosis [41]. GS02941
had a top UniProt hit to Dictyostelium discoidium Q54HM5,
a t-SNARE family protein (E-value 3 × 10-32) and a top SwissProt hit to the Caenorhabditis elegans syntaxin-1 homolog
STX1A (E-value 2 × 10-19). RT-PCR confirmed that GS02941
expression was detectable exclusively in RNA from 2N cells
using three independent primer sets (Figure 8). The cluster
was composed of six different mini-clusters, representing
possible different alternative transcripts. Primers designed to
mini-cluster e02941.1, one potential alternative transcript
form, successfully amplified the predicted 317-nucleotide
product but also amplified at least one other product of
approximately 400 nucleotides. Only a single approximately
1,500-nucleotide product was amplified from genomic DNA.
This suggests that the gene encoding GS02941 contains several (or large) introns that might be subjected to alternative
splicing.

GS05051 was a homolog of the Cl-/bicarbonate exchanger
solute carrier family 4 proteins (SLC4) [40]. This cluster was
represented by seven 2N ESTs and zero 1N ESTs, which comprised six separate mini-clusters that only partially overlapped; these might represent alternative transcripts.
Primers designed to separate putative alternative transcripts
both detected the expected products from 2N RNA samples
but no product from 1N RNA samples in RT-PCR tests (Figure
8), confirming strong differential expression and the existence of alternatively spliced transcripts.

GS01164, and GS01802 could only be detected from 2N RNA
samples, and not at all in 1N RNA samples (Figure 8). In contrast, GS11002 was easily detected in both 1N and 2N RNA
samples (Figure 8). PCR amplification of GS01802 from
genomic DNA of 2N cells revealed two products, differing by
about 50 nucleotides but both larger than the single 444
nucleotides product from cDNA. Only the larger band was

GS00304 VCX1 (primer pair 1)

We chose to specifically examine Ca2+ and H+ transporters
that might play a role in calcification and to determine
whether any of them might display highly 2N-specific expression (Table 11). Five clusters had homology to vacuolar-type
Ca2+/H+ antiporters (VCX1). Although these sequences were
aligned with matching regions of known VCX1 proteins at the
amino acid level (Figure S11 in Additional data file 1), these
clusters could not be well aligned at the nucleotide level (not
shown), indicating that they represent paralogs. Only one of
these, GS00304, showed possible 2N-specific expression,
being represented by four ESTs in the 2N library and zero in
the 1N library. GS00304 had a top Swiss-Prot hit to the A.
thaliana VCX1 homolog CAX2_ARATH (E-value 3 × 10-60).
We confirmed by RT-PCR that GS00304 was strongly overexpressed in 2N cells using two independent primer sets (Figure 9).

GS00451 represents a putative aquaporin-type transporter.
GS03351 was weakly homologous to a putative arachidonate
lipoxygenase previously identified in E. huxleyi but to no
other proteins in the searched databases, so it may represent
a protein of unknown function. Both clusters were confirmed
by RT-PCR to be highly 2N-specific (Figure S8 in Additional
data file 1). Two other predicted highly 2N-specific clusters,
GS00463 and GS02435, are discussed in the next sections.

Three clusters showed similarity to sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic membrane (SERCA)-type Ca2+-transporting ATPases
(Table 11). However, none of these clusters showed strong
evidence of differential expression by in silico comparison of
the two libraries.
Six clusters displayed sequence similarities to the K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCKX) family of Ca2+ pumps. These
clusters did not align well with each other at the nucleotide
level, indicating that they are likely to be distant paralogs
(and not alleles). Two of these (GS05506 and GS00463) were

only present in the 2N library (two EST reads, P = 0.1249, and
eight EST reads, P = 0.00195, respectively). 2N-specific
expression of GS00463 was confirmed by RT-PCR with two
independent primer sets (Figure 9).
Homologs of 11 out of the 14 subunits of vacuolar-type H+ATPases were identified, comprising a total of 16 clusters.
Seven of these clusters were represented by both 1N- and 2NESTs. Only two clusters showed potential differential expression. GS01501 (top Swiss-Prot hit to Saccharomyces cerevisiae V-ATPase V0 domain subunit c', E-value 4 × 10-38) was
present only in the 1N library (four ESTs, P = 0.03129)
whereas GS09780 (top Swiss-Prot hit to A. thaliana V1
domain subunit F) was represented only in the 2N library
(four ESTs, P = 0.03129). Five clusters were homologous to
V0 domain subunit a, the presumed path for proton transport. These clusters did not align at the nucleotide level, thus
likely representing distant paralogs (and not alleles). Of the
V0 domain subunit a homologs, three shared the highly conserved 20 amino acid motif that contains the R735 residue
critical for H+ transport (Figure S12 in Additional data file 1).
The other two clusters, each represented by a single EST,
were short and did not cover this conserved region. Clusters

GS03783 and GS01934 were closely homologous (E-values 7
× 10-38 and 4 × 10-38, respectively) to the V0 domain proteolipid subunit (subunit c/c') previously identified as a singlecopy gene in the coccolithophore Pleurochrysis carterae
[42]. These two clusters aligned poorly at the nucleotide
sequence level and showed divergence at the amino acid
sequence level, thus probably representing paralogs.
The glycoprotein GPA was previously identified to be closely
associated with E. huxleyi coccoliths by biochemical and
immunolocalization studies [43]. Cluster GS09822 was
aligned perfectly over its entire length with the amino-terminal 86 codons of the previously sequenced GPA (AAD01505;
Figure S10 in Additional data file 1), with minor differences in
the 3' UTR (not shown). Surprisingly, GS09822 was represented by one 1N EST and one 2N EST, suggesting expression
in both non-calcified 1N cells and calcifying 2N cells, and RTPCR confirmed that this transcript was abundantly expressed
in both calcifying 2N and non-calcifying 1N cells (Figure 9), as
predicted from inter-library comparisons.
A previous study identified 45 transcripts with potential roles
in biomineralization using microarrays and quantitative RTPCR comparing expression levels in strain CCMP1516 under
phosphate-replete (non-calcifying) and phosphate-limited
(weakly calcifying) conditions and in calcifying cells of strain
B39 [44]. We attempted to determine whether any of these
transcripts might show highly 2N-specific expression patterns (see analysis in Additional data file 10). Of the 45 transcripts in Table 3 of Quinn et al. [44], only 23 could be
unambiguously identified in public databases based on the
provided information and three were each associated with
more than one unique EST sequence in GenBank. Fifteen of
these transcripts had BLAST matches to clusters in our dataset; ten of these clusters were represented by both 1N and 2N
ESTs. Four of the remaining five were represented by only
single ESTs from the 2N library. The last cluster, GS03082,
similar to GenBank EST sequence DQ658351 from
CCMP1516, was composed of two ESTs from the 2N library
and zero from the 1N library. However, the transcript for
GS03082 was easily detected in RNA from both 1N and 2N
cells (Figure 9). Thus, we could not confirm 2N-specific
expression of the transcripts described in [44].

We selected the KOG class 'chromatin structure and dynamics' for closer examination because chromatin packaging
might differ between 2N cells and 1N cells as the cells are similar in size but contain different DNA quantities. Also, chromatin factors are known to regulate gene expression. Within
this class, two clusters with homology to H4 histones were
found to exhibit potential differential expression. GS02435
was composed of six ESTs from the 2N library and zero from
the 1N library (P = 0.0078). In contrast, GS09138 was composed of 13 ESTs from the 1N library and 0 from the 2N

library (P = 6 × 10-5). A sequence alignment analysis of
GS09138 and two other H4 histone homologs (GS07034 and
GS07988) showed that these shared high nucleotide identity
over the coding region and 100% amino acid sequence identity (Figure S13 in Additional data file 1), suggesting that 1N
and 2N cells may preferentially utilize alternative genes for
what appear to be the same functional gene product. The 2Nspecific GS02435 differed from other H4 histone homologs in
the predicted amino acid sequence. The other H4 histone
homologs were almost identical along their 103 amino acid
predicted length to H4 histones from other eukaryotes but the
longest reading frame of GS02435 exhibited an additional ≥
50 residues in its amino-terminal sequence and lacked 3 carboxy-terminal conserved residues, making this predicted
protein at least 27 amino acids longer (by taking the most
downstream starting methionine codon) than the typical 103
amino acid residue H4 histones (Figure S13 in Additional
data file 1). We confirmed by RT-PCR that GS02435 was
detectable only in 2N RNA samples (Figure 10). Surprisingly,
genomic DNA-positive controls showed that GS02435 was
detected only in 2N genomic DNA and not in 1N genomic
DNA (Figure 10). All of the other clusters examined in this
study were detected in both 1N and 2N genomic DNA (Figures
7, 8, 9 and 10). The absence of GS02435 from the 1N genome
was confirmed by PCR using three independent, non-overlapping PCR primer sets.
There were five clusters with homology to the H2A histone.
Alignments of the predicted polypeptides with other eukaryotic H2A histones showed high conservation (Figure S14 in
Additional data file 1). GS10455 and GS07154 were identical
to each other across the predicted amino acid sequences,
although they diverged in nucleotide sequence, particularly in
the predicted 5' and 3' UTRs. GS06864 and GS07501 were
also identical in predicted amino acid sequence but diverged
in nucleotide sequence. GS06749 was divergent from all the
other E. huxleyi predicted H2A homologs, yet it still grouped
well within other eukaryotic histone H2As in preliminary
phylogenetic analysis. In particular, it was grouped within the
H2A variant class H2AV (Figure S15 in Additional data file 1).
GS06749 was composed of four ESTs from the 1N library and
three ESTs from the 2N library, and RT-PCR confirmed that
it was well-expressed in both 1N and 2N RNA samples (Figure
10). Only one H2A histone homolog, GS10455, showed signs
of differential transcription, albeit not statistically significant
(two ESTs in the 1N library compared to zero in the 2N
library, P = 0.1251). We confirmed by RT-PCR that GS10455
was highly expressed in 1N cells with no detection in 2N phase
cells (Figure 10).
Two other possible factors in epigenetic control were predicted to be highly 1N-specific. GS01285 had top Swiss-Prot
homology to mouse histone H3-K9 methyltransferase 3 (Evalue 3 × 10-13). However, GS01285 had modestly higher
homology scores (1 × 10-16) to bacterial ankyrin repeat-containing proteins, so its function is uncertain. Conserved

Domains Database (CDD) homology identified a possible
DNA N-6-adenine-methyltransferase domain (E-value 4 ×
10-9) in GS02990. RT-PCR confirmed the prediction that
both GS01285 and GS02990 were highly 1N-specific (Figure
S8 in Additional data file 1).

Discussion
Potential use of the new EST dataset for
environmental surveys and understanding the recent
evolution of the Emiliania huxleyi morpho-species
Two EST datasets were already available from different E.
huxleyi strains, but in both cases only 2N, day-phase transcripts were represented. The new E. huxleyi EST dataset,
from 1N and 2N life phases integrated over the day-night
cycle, dramatically expands the existing transcriptomic information of this species. The three EST datasets come from
strains with widely different geographic origins and morphotypes. The average sequence identity among ESTs from different genetic backgrounds was ≥ 99.5%. Therefore, the
limited overlap between the EST sets may be due to physiological or technical differences in the generation of cDNA
libraries (for instance, the cDNA libraries here were integrated over the diel and cell cycles, whereas the other cDNA
libraries were constructed only from cells harvested during
the day, presumably in G1 phase), but is not likely due to
sequence divergence within the E. huxleyi species-complex.
This has several important implications. Practically, this suggests that EST and genomic sequence information from laboratory cultures can be successfully used to design probes for
investigating in situ gene expression of E. huxleyi cells in
environmental samples (for example, using microarrays or
quantitative RT-PCR). Such probes will be particularly useful
as this species frequently dominates phytoplankton communities. Second, the limited sequence variability among strains
is consistent with the fossil records, indicating a very recent
origin of E. huxleyi, which may have rapidly colonized and
adapted to a wide range of ocean environments. Limited
intra-strain sequence variability suggests that the adaptation
perhaps instead involved changes in gene regulation and
gain/loss of genes.

Transcriptome differentiation of haploid and diploid
cells
The dramatic phenotypic differentiation between 1N and 2N
cells is reflected in the limited overlap between the 1N and 2N
EST libraries. Both libraries were normalized, which suppresses highly abundant transcripts to enhance the probability that rare transcripts are sampled. However, the high rate
of RT-PCR validation of potentially differentially expressed
genes and the fact that homologs of motility-related proteins
were distributed exactly as expected according to library origin supports the successful use of in silico subtraction of two
normalized libraries in this case. The 82 EST clusters related
to proteins known to be highly specific for flagella originated
exclusively from the 1N library, consistent with the fact that

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R114

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/10/R114

Genome Biology 2009,

only 1N cells synthesize these structures. In contrast, many
clusters homologous to proteins that can have non-flagellar
functions originated from both libraries. For example, six of
the nine clusters homologous to actin included ESTs from the
2N library. Because of the use of normalization, we focused
our analyses on estimates of presence/absence differences
and differences in the representation of functional classes of
genes, rather than quantitative expression differences of specific genes between the two transcriptomes. Our analysis
likely underestimates the true transcriptomic difference
between the two cell phases.
The two libraries were estimated to share only 50% of total
transcript clusters (by the abundance-based Jaccard similarity index). Such a level of transcriptome differentiation has
been seen between mammalian germ and somatic cells [4547] but it is much greater than that seen in vascular plant
germ cell development, where only less than 10% of transcripts in mature male pollen are exclusively expressed in that
tissue [48,49].
The estimated transcriptomic richness of 2N cells was
approximately 20% larger than that of 1N cells. The same tendency has been seen in our preliminary analysis of 2N versus
1N ESTs from the closely related coccolithophore Gephryocapsa oceanica (unpublished data). The 1N cells in this study
are clonal. It cannot be ruled out that the 2N cells have undergone sexual recombination since isolation (as clones),
because these cells can still produce 1N cells. However, we
have never observed 2N cells to be formed in cultures of either
clonal 1N cells or non-clonal 1N populations originating from
the same 2N clonal parent, suggesting heterothally and/or
strong barriers to inbreeding. Thus, we believe the 2N cells
have remained clonal and the higher transcriptome richness
in 2N cells is not due to increased diversity of genotypes
present in these cultures.
The higher transcriptome richness of 2N cells compared to 1N
cells has implications for life cycle function in coccolithophores in particular and for life cycle evolution in eukaryotes
more broadly. A smaller transcriptome richness in haploid
relative to diploid cells was also seen in studies of vascular
plant gametophyte development: mature pollen grains
express 40 to 50% fewer genes than the diploid progenitor tissues [48,49]. Likewise, the set of genes specifically expressed
in post-meiotic spermatids in mammals is smaller than the
set of genes specifically expressed in diploid tissues [45], suggesting a similar drop in transcriptome richness in the haploid stage. The large decrease in total expressed genes in the
vascular plant pollen grain may mostly reflect that they represent a haploid gametophyte that does not live independently
of the parent diploid and is capable of only a limited number
of mitoses. A similar explanation would apply for highly specialized short-lived animal sperm that cannot undergo mitosis. This explanation would not apply to haploid
coccolithophorid cells, which are capable of unlimited mitotic

division and live independently of the diploids. An increase in
transcriptome richness with ploidy has not previously been
reported in studies of autopolyploid organisms [50,51]. Only
one study (done in S. cerevisiae using microarrays) has compared global gene expression between haploid and diploid
cells where both represent free-living life stages. No decrease
in transcriptome richness of 1N cells was observed [50]. Proposed selective advantages allowing the maintenance of
haplo-diplontic life cycles in eukaryotes include the ability for
each life stage to adapt to alternative 'niches' [52], with 1N
stages possibly better adapted to low-resource environments
[14,53,54]. Available data on coccolithophore life stages is
consistent with this hypothesis, as the holocolith-producing
1N stages of several species are associated with nutrient-poor
waters compared to the heterococcolith-producing 2N stages
of the same species [18]. Perhaps a reduced transcriptome
allows 1N cells to be more streamlined to adapt to specific
niches and an intrinsically more rich transcriptome allows 2N
cells to be versatile in exploiting a variety of productive environments. There is a tendency of diploid cells to be the dominant building blocks of the most complex multicellular
organisms, including animals, vascular plants, and some
algae, albeit with many exceptions [13,14]. There might be a
more general constraint, such as differential expression of
alternative alleles due to heterozygosity, that permits diploid
cells to express a larger number of genetic loci (counting alleles as a single entity), and hence a more complex transcriptome, than haploid cells.

Enhanced motility and sensory systems of 1N cells
The 1N library displayed over-representation of signal transduction-related transcripts compared to the 2N library. This
trend was seen when measured by the number of distinct EST
clusters, by the number of ESTs, and also by the over-representation of predicted and validated '1N-specific' clusters in
the 'signal transduction' functional class. Three clusters
related to signal transduction processes were demonstrated
to be highly specific to the 1N cells. The motility of 1N cells
may require an enhanced repertoire for rapid signal perception and processing, leading to a more sophisticated behavioral repertoire.
A combination of homology analysis and digital subtraction
successfully identified a large set of motility-related transcripts in the 1N library. Of the motility-related proteins identified in C. reinhardtii, 68% had identifiable homologs in our
E. huxleyi EST datasets. Likewise, homologs for six of the
nine BBS basal body proteins queried were identified, and the
identification of 12 distinct flagellar DHC homologs and one
cytoplasmic DHC homolog is similar to the number of total
flagellar DHCs and cytoplasmic DHCs identified in other
organisms [26,55,56]. These proportions are similar to what
would be expected from the estimated sampling coverage of
the 1N library (Table 4). We conclude that the flagellar elements are highly conserved between C. reinhardtii and E.
huxleyi. Conserved core flagellar structural components,

Genome Biology 2009,

such as flagellar dyneins and basal body components, will
probably be intriguing new targets for phylogenomic studies
of deep relationships among the eukaryotes, as most eukaryote branches contain flagellated members, and the 'unikont/
bikont' split is originally based on flagellar/basal body characters [57].
Motility and sensory systems also appear to account, in part,
for the over-representation of clusters with highest homology
to metazoans and C. reinhardtii among the 1N-unique clusters. C. reinhardtii is the only member of the Viridiplantae
represented in the KEGG database that has an independently
reproducing motile stage. Clusters best-hitting to the moss
Physcomitrella patens were not over-represented among 1Nunique clusters. Mosses have a flagellated gamete stage but it
does not reproduce asexually and moss flagella are lacking
components present in C. reinhardtii [58]. The gene content
differentiation between eukaryotes that have ciliated/flagellated cells in the dominant phase of the life cycle and those
that do not is thus reflected in the transcriptome content differentiation between 1N and 2N E. huxleyi. This result suggests that the transcriptional differentiation of E. huxleyi
might involve regulation of functional modules with distinct
phylogenetic distribution among diverse eukaryotes.

Light sensing
The three 1N-specific phototropin homologs might have a
role in the pronounced phototaxis exhibited by 1N cells.
Although no information is yet available on the environmental cues that might lead to syngamy (fusion of 1N cells to produce 2N cells) or meiosis (formation of 1N cells from 2N
cells), light could be an important trigger to examine, given
the identification of four phototropin-related genes in this
study. Phototropin has been shown to mediate the light-regulation of gamete differentiation, light re-activation of gametes, and zygote development in C. reinhardtii [34], and light
is also a key regulator of centric diatom gametogenesis [59]
and diploid cyst germination in dinoflagellates [60]. The
absence of any detectable rhodopsin homologs in the E. huxleyi EST database further suggests that phototropin-like proteins might represent the major light-sensing proteins in
coccolithophores.

Identification of new putative elements involved in
biomineralization of 2N cells
Coccolith production has been calculated to require a massive
sustained flux of Ca2+ from outside the cell into the specialized Golgi-derived coccolith-deposition vesicles where calcification occurs; a major question in coccolithophore cell
biology is how the 2N cells can sustain such ion fluxes while
avoiding Ca2+ toxicity [61]. The diffusive gradient is very
strong for Ca2+ to enter from seawater ([Ca2+] ≈ 10 mM) to the
cytoplasm (average free [Ca2+] << 1 μM), but Ca2+ must then
be pumped into the Golgi vesicles against an equally powerful
gradient if Ca2+ were to transit through the cytoplasm. We did
not identify any candidate 2N-specific Ca2+-ATPases, but we

Volume 10, Issue 10, Article R114

von Dassow et al. R114.26

found one Ca2+/H+ VCX1-type antiporter specific to the 2N
calcifying cells. Curiously, we also identified several NCKX
family members, at least one of which was highly specific to
2N calcifying cells. NCKX proteins are usually involved in
rapid efflux of Ca2+ in cell types that experience frequent large
fluctuations in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] [62]. If Ca2+ enters immediately into the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum after transiting only a very limited portion of the cytoplasm, as
suggested by Berry et al. [61], then NCKXs could be important pumps for removing Ca2+ that has leaked into the general
cytoplasm from the coccolith deposition vesicle. Alternatively, if coccolith secretion involves Ca2+-dependent exocytosis, NCKXs could serve to return cytoplasmic [Ca2+] to a
resting state after these regular exocytosis events.
Calcification also releases H+ and requires alkalinization of
the coccolith deposition vesicles, so cells must simultaneously
manage Ca2+ and H+ fluxes [61]. The 2N-specific VCX1 (Ptype) Ca2+/H+ exchanger might participate in such a function.
However, P-type Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity was localized to plasma membrane fractions rather than coccolith vesicle or Golgi vesicle fractions in the coccolithophore
Pleurochrysis sp. [63]. Vacuolar-type (V-type) H+ ATPase
activity has previously been located to the Pleurochrysis sp.
coccolith vesicle [63] and the V0 subunit c/c' has been immunolocalized there as well [42]. Those studies assumed that the
coccolith vesicle must pump H+ into the cytoplasm, functioning in reverse to other eukaryotic V-type H+ ATPases, which
pump protons out of the cytoplasm. Here we identified
homologs of five out of the six subunits of the V0 domain and
six out of the eight subunits of the V1 domain known in yeast.
Many of these subunits were represented by multiple
homologs but, in general, were found in both the 1N and the
2N libraries; there was no clear candidate for a highly 2N-specific V-type H+ ATPase. This suggests that the same genes are
utilized for both forward H+ pumping (out of the cytosol) and
possible reverse H+ pumping (into the cytosol from the coccolith vesicle) as there is no obvious reason for the non-calcifying 1N cells to engage in reverse H+ pumping. Alternatively, it
may be that VCX1 activity does localize to the coccolith deposition vesicle in E. huxleyi, differing from Pleurochrysis sp.
VCX1-mediated Ca2+/H+ exchange has been estimated to
occur with a stoichiometry of 3H+:1Ca2+ [64,65], whereas calcification releases one H+ for every Ca2+ precipitated [61]. In
this scenario, VCX1 would pump excess H+ out of the vesicle
and V-type H+ ATPases would function in the normal direction (H+ into the vesicle).
We detected a highly 2N-specific homolog of SLC4 Cl-/bicarbonate exchangers, which are well known to play roles in
intracellular pH regulation in animal cells [40]. The SLC4
homolog might function to maintain optimal balance of pH
and carbonate/bicarbonate in the coccolith deposition vesicle
for calcification. None of the 12 carbonic anhydrases identified showed evidence for highly 2N-specific expression in
inter-library comparisons. The putative carbonic anhydrase

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/10/R114

Genome Biology 2009,

identified with highly 1N-specific expression, GS00157, was a
member of the β-family (closest homology to a putative carbonic anhydrase identified in Pleurochrysis sp.). Members of
this family can localize to either the mitochondria, the chloroplast, or potentially other locations in C. reinhardtii [66].
Target prediction was not possible with available EST
sequence from GS00157, so its function remains unclear.
Identification of the Ca2+, H+ and carbonate transport-related
transcripts will allow quantitative comparisons of their activities and functions to understand how 2N cells control the
large Ca2+ and H+ fluxes involved in calcification.
The 2N-specific SNARE homolog could likely play a role in
coccolith secretion, as SNARE proteins are the machinery
involved in fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane during exocytosis [41]. The secretion of coccoliths to
the cell surface is a massive and highly coordinated exocytosis
event specific to 2N cells: each coccolith is an ellipsoidal plate
with axial dimensions ranging from 2 to 4 μm, a substantial
fraction of the dimension of an individual E. huxleyi cell (4 to
5 μm) [7]. In contrast, 1N cells produce much smaller ellipsoid organic scales with dimensions of 0.4 to 0.6 μm [11].
The glycoprotein GPA was previously found associated with
coccolith polysaccharides and displays Ca2+-binding activity,
so it likely plays a role in biomineralization [43]. However,
the GPA gene (GS09822) is well expressed by both calcified
2N cells and non-calcified 1N cells. The set of transcripts
hypothesized by Quinn et al. [44] to be involved in biomineralization based on differential expression between calcifying
and non-calcifying cells (that were presumably 2N) showed a
similar pattern. Although Quinn et al. did not provide sufficient information to retrieve all of these transcripts from public databases, most of the ones that could be obtained were
represented in both of our libraries. Those genes might still be
subjected to differential expression or post-transcriptional
control. It is also intriguing to speculate that GPA (and perhaps other biomineralization proteins) might have a structural role in non-calcified 1N cells, potentially as a component
of 1N-specific organic scales.

Possible mechanisms for control of the transcriptome
The identification of 1N-specific Myb-like transcription factors and alternative histones provides the first insight into
transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in
haptophytes. Myb transcription factors are known to control
a large variety of cell differentiation processes in plants,
including sperm formation [38,39]. Histone variants are differentially expressed in different mammalian tissues [67] and
exert epigenetic control in both animals and plants [68,69].
Of the several H2 homologs identified, GS10455 was detected
only in 1N cells. It was identical in amino acid sequence to
GS07154, expressed in both cells. Both grouped phylogenetically within the canonical H2A histone group. GS06749 was
expressed in both 1N and 2N cells yet it was associated phylogenetically with the H2AZ and H2AV variant histones

Volume 10, Issue 10, Article R114

von Dassow et al. R114.27

involved in epigenetic controls in plants, yeast, and animals
[69]. Therefore GS06749 might be involved in epigenetic controls in E. huxleyi. We did not identify a histone H2A variant
highly specific to either phase. The potentially 2N-specific H4
histone variant GS02435 is intriguing because H4 histones
are nearly 100% identical across all eukaryotes [67,70], yet
this H4 variant is unusually long with an extended amino-terminal region with no homology in other eukaryotic H4s. The
amino-terminal region of histones, including H4, is the site of
specific acetylations and methylations that are thought to
influence transcriptional activity of the bound DNA [71]. A
strange aspect of GS02435 was its absence from the 1N
genome. GS02435 could have been lost from RCC1217 during
the culture of this clonal isolate or it could represent a
mutated allele present in one of the sets of chromosomes of
the 2N genome that was not transmitted to the 1N genome.
Alternatively, E. huxleyi might be heterothallic (as mentioned
above). If the GS02435 gene is on a sex-specific genome segment, half of the 1N cell products of meiosis would not contain it.

Conclusions

The expanded EST dataset on E. huxleyi represents an essential community resource for the on-going annotation and
manual curation of the whole genome sequence of E. huxleyi
and for improved understanding of coccolithophorids and
haptophytes. The greatest gap in current understanding of
the ecology and natural history of E. huxleyi and other coccolithophores is lack of knowledge of the occurrence, distribution, and role of 1N cells. Currently, there are no techniques
that can reliably recognize the presence of 1N E. huxleyi cells
in plankton samples. In addition to revealing potent new
hints about specific elements of coccolithophorid cell biology
(for example, calcification, motility, and signaling), our dataset will help create useful molecular markers of the occurrence of 1N cells in the field. For example, quantitative RTPCR using primers specific to E. huxleyi flagellar genes might
detect the presence of active 1N cells in natural plankton samples.
The heteromorphic haplo-diplontic life cycle and excellent
fossil record of coccolithophores makes them an especially
attractive group in which to study the influence of the life
cycle on gene evolution. An interesting observation was that
clusters shared between both life cycle phases were more
likely to have homologs among many taxonomic groups
whereas clusters unique to one phase or the other were more
likely to be orphans. The coming availability of the whole
genome sequence of E. huxleyi will allow the generation of
longer transcript models. This will increase the number of
genes for which homologs can be identified, permitting true
phylogenomic analyses to track gene origins and more confidence in assignment of genes as orphans. At the same time,
genomic and EST resources are being developed for other
coccolithophores and haptophytes. It will then be possible to

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/10/R114

unravel how life cycles influence which genes are maintained
or laterally transferred and to test whether new gene families
(haptophyte-specific, coccolithophore-specific, or E. huxleyispecific) have tended to arise as specific adaptations for one
life cycle phase.

tion has been shown to inhibit the growth rate of 1N but not
2N cells of other coccolithophores [74]. Cultures were acclimated to these conditions in semi-continuous culture for 2
weeks prior to the inoculation of 8-L cultures. Mid-exponential phase cells were harvested at eight time points over a 24h period beginning the first day that cell abundance increased
above 105 ml-1 (11 h, 15 h, 19 h, 21 h, 23 h30 on day 1 and 02 h,
05 h, 08 h on day 2).

Strain origins and preparation of axenic cultures
E. huxleyi strain RCC1216 (= TQ26) was initiated by micropipette isolation of a single cell from a sample from the Tasman
Sea off New Zealand in October 1998. A clonal 1N strain
(RCC1217) was isolated from RCC1216 following a partial
phase change (2N to 1N; Table 1). RCC1217 cultures were
made axenic by the following treatments: cells were washed
gently on sterile 1.2 μm pore-size filters (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) with sterile (autoclaved and 0.2 μm-filtered) seawater, and incubated for 4 days in K/2 (-Tris, -Si) medium
[72] mixed with 0.1 volumes Provosoli's antibiotic mix
(Sigma-Aldrich P8029, St Louis, Missouri, USA). Cells were
re-washed with sterile seawater and allowed to recover in K/
2 medium for >4 weeks before washing again and incubating
in 50 μg ml-1 ampicillin, 50 μg ml-1 streptomycin dissolved in
K/2 medium, incubating for 4 days, and then transferring to
antibiotic-free medium. Treatment of RCC1216 (2N) cells was
similar but involved first collecting heavily calcified cells on
sterile 5 μm pore-size filters (Millipore) before washing, and
brief acidification after washing to dissolve calcite coccoliths
before antibiotic treatment. Absence of bacteria was confirmed by inoculation in bacterial test media (protocols available at the Center for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton [73])
and by extensive epifluorescence examination of samples
fixed in 1% formaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, stained
with Sybr Green I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA),
and collected onto 0.2 μm pore-size filters (Millipore). These
tests were repeated several times, always in comparison to
cultures of the original non-axenic RCC1216 and RCC1217
strains as positive controls. Both inverted light microscopy
and flow cytometry confirmed that cultures did not contain
any cells of the opposite phase.

Experimental conditions
Cultures were grown at 17°C, 80 μmol·photons·m-2 on a 14:10
light-dark cycle in a modified K-based medium (iK/5) containing 115 μM nitrate, 20 μM ammonium, 7.2 μM phosphate,
trace metals at half the concentration of K/2, and fullstrength K/2 vitamins. Analysis of nutrient concentrations
showed that cultures had not substantially depleted available
nitrogen or phosphorus at time of harvesting and cells thus
were in a nutrient-replete state. The moderate light level permits a near maximum growth rate of both 1N and 2N cells
without causing photoinhibition of growth seen at higher
light levels in 1N cells [15]. A 14:10 light-dark cycle is similar
to that experienced during spring blooms and permits phased
cell division and an extensive period for dark metabolism to
occur. Cultures were not aerated because continuous agita-

Measurement of cell properties, cell cycle, and
photosynthetic efficiency
Cell abundance was measured daily and at each harvesting
time point using a Becton-Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer
equipped with a 488 nm laser (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA). Cell optical properties were characterized by
forward scatter (proportional to protoplast size), side scatter
(proportional to optical complexity), and chlorophyll fluorescence. A 3.8% NaCl sheath fluid was used for whole cell measurements to match the refractive index of seawater
permitting measurements of forward scatter [75]. Cell cycle
phase was determined at each point in harvesting by flow
cytometric analysis of Sybr Green I-stained extracted nuclei.
Nuclear extraction using previously published protocols
[20,76] was successful on 1N cells but not on 2N cells. Photosynthetic efficiency was measured as Fv/Fm with a PhytoPAM pulse-amplitude modulated fluorometer.

RNA isolation, cDNA library construction, and
sequencing
Cells were harvested by filtration onto 1.2 μm pore-size membrane filters (Millipore) and extracted following the Trizol
protocol. Ethanol-washed total RNA pellets were resuspended in RNA-free H2O, treated with DNase I and further
purified using an RNeasy Minikit following the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen, Valencia, California,
USA). RNA quantity and quality was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
Massachussets, USA) and a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, California, USA). The 260:280 ratios
were typically greater than 2.2 and absence of degradation
was evidenced by sharp 18 s and 28 s bands. Equal amounts
of total RNA from each time point were pooled before sending
to Vertis Biotechnologies (Freising-Weihenstephan, Germany) for library construction following a protocol for fulllength enriched cDNA that includes two successive poly-A
RNA purifications, first-strand cDNA synthesis at 42°C for 45
minutes, followed by a ramp up in temperature for a final 10
minutes at 55°C. cDNA was amplified by 19 cycles of PCR.
cDNA was normalized by one cycle of denaturation-reassociation followed by separation of reassociated double-stranded
cDNA from normalized single-stranded cDNA by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Normalized cDNA was amplified
with nine cycles of PCR followed by limited exonuclease
digestion. The >0.5 kb size fraction was isolated by agarose
gel electrophoresis and directionally ligated into the EcoR1
and BamH1 sites of the pBS II sk+ vector. Ligations were elec-

troporated into the T1 Phage resistant TransforMax EC100T1R (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) electrocompetent E. coli cells. Libraries were then sent to Genoscope
(Evry, France) for 5' Sanger sequencing.

EST sequence processing and analysis
Sequences derived from the 5'-end reads were trimmed
according to Phred TRIM values [77,78]. Vector, adaptor and
polyA sequences were removed using in-house software and
the NCBI/UniVec database [79]. The longest high quality
regions of each read were used as ESTs. At this stage, we
found no obvious contaminations in our EST dataset from
other organisms using BLASTN against NCBI/GenBank [80].
ESTs ≥ 50 nucleotides long were selected for further analysis.
Initial single-linkage clustering was performed using BLAT
version 34 [81] following the criteria that there was ≥ 98%
identity across the BLAT alignment and an additional constraint on the alignment (that is, either the alignment was ≥
150 nucleotides or ≥ 90% of the length of the shorter trimmed
read or was long enough that the extremities of the alignment
were within a few bases from the end of one of the ESTs in
comparison). Next we used the CAP3 program (the version as
of December 2007) [82] to generate one or more 'mini-clusters' for each of the initial clusters. A consensus sequence was
simultaneously obtained for each mini-cluster. We assigned
identifiers (such as 'e00001.1') to mini-clusters. Finally, we
performed a third round of clustering based on the overlap of
consensus sequences after BLAT mapping on the JGI E. huxleyi draft genomic sequences [10] as well as pairwise
sequence similarity criteria as above, provided that the latter
were consistent with the BLAT genomic mapping data. If the
longest consensus sequence of the mini-clusters composing a
cluster was shorter than 90 nucleotides, we discarded the corresponding cluster. The clusters finally obtained, each containing one or more mini-clusters, were denoted by distinct
identifiers (for example, 'GS00001') in this study. All the EST
sequences determined in the present study were deposited in
the EMBL database with the assigned accession numbers provided in Additional data file 2. At the final stage of the present
study, we noticed a possible contamination of yeast cloning
vector (GS12427 with 15 ESTs matching to yeast expression
vector pYAA-ZP-MCS EU882163.1). We re-performed
BLASTN searches of all mini-cluster consensus sequences
against the latest version of GenBank, and found no additional possible contaminations in our EST dataset. Thus, we
concluded that possible contaminations did not affect our
conclusions in this study. The GS12427 cluster was removed
from all lists of clusters in this manuscript but not from Additional data file 2.
EST consensus sequences were searched against the UniProt/
Swiss-Prot sequence databases [83] using BLASTX (E-value
≤ 10-5), and selected genomes of the KEGG database [84]
using BLASTX (E-value ≤ 10-10) and against NCBI/KOG [83]
and NCBI/CDD using RPS-BLAST (E-value ≤ 10-5) after
translating EST sequences. For a cluster with multiple mini-

clusters (thus, multiple consensus sequences), we recoded the
best scoring hit for each of the homology searches against
UniProt, Swiss-Prot and KOG. Those clusters with no detectable similarity (E-value ≤ 10-5) in these databases were
referred to as 'orphans' in this study. We automatically associated E. huxleyi EST clusters with C. reinhardtii flagellarrelated proteins [27,28,30,31], when the EST clusters had a
better BLASTX score to one of the flagellar-related proteins
than to other predicted protein sequences from the C. reinhardtii genome [85]. The automatically generated list of E.
huxleyi flagellar-related sequences was carefully examined by
additional BLAST searches and alignment analysis against
specific flagellar or basal body or closely related proteins [2628,30,31,36,55,56,86-94] (more details are provided in Additional data files 8 and 9).
Transcriptome complexity, or an estimate of the total number
of expressed genes represented in each library and in the
combined library, was assessed with the Chao1 estimator
[24], which has been recommended for estimating microbial
diversity in rDNA libraries [95] and has previously been used
for analysis of EST libraries [96], and using a ML estimator
developed for EST analysis [23]. The ML analysis was performed by artificially dividing the ESTs into two sets based on
the time of sequencing (that is, the first and the second
rounds of sequencing) and by counting the number of clusters
represented by either or both of the two sets. The ML analysis
assumes a uniform distribution for the probability of finding
an object (in our case, an EST cluster). This assumption may
not exactly apply to our dataset, although our ESTs were
derived from normalized libraries and the distribution of EST
reads per cluster followed a negative exponential curve characteristic of Poisson processes (Figure S3 in Additional data
file 1). The ML estimates should thus be considered as qualitative. Chao1 and transcriptome diversity were calculated
using EstimateS [97]. Sampling coverage of the libraries was
estimated to be >50% for both libraries according to the ratio
of total clusters to the estimates of transcriptome richness
(Table 4). Slightly lower estimates were obtained using the
'approximately unbiased estimate of coverage' discussed by
Susko and Roger [98] (50.4%, 44.8%, and 51.3% for 1N, 2N,
and combined libraries, respectively) but the same trends
between libraries were seen. Empirical estimates of coverage
based on identification of well-known and highly conserved
flagellar-related genes were between the two higher coverage
estimates, so those are used in Table 4. Shannon diversity H
is a function of the total number of genes detected and the distribution of ESTs among the genes [99]. H is maximal when
every gene that is detected is represented by an equal number
of ESTs: Hmax = lnS (where S is the total number of genes
that are represented in the library). When H is close to Hmax,
it suggests that a new EST generated has a nearly equal probability of being assigned to any of the genes that exist in the
library, as expected after normalization. The abundance
based estimator of Jaccard similarity index, which estimates
the overlap between the 1N and 2N libraries taking sample

Genome Biology 2009,

coverage into account [100], and the Shannon diversity of
each library and the combined library were also calculated
using EstimateS. Statistical analysis for differential representation between libraries, for both KOG classes and individual
clusters, was performed using the method by Audic and Claverie [25]. MUSCLE alignment and phylogenetic analysis
werer performed with the web service Phylogeny.fr [101].

DNA isolation
We filtered 25 ml of dense but growing cultures of RCC1216
(2N) and RCC1217 (1N) onto 25 mm 1.2 μm pore filters (Millipore) and DNA from these were extracted using the Qiagen
DNeasy Plant Minikit.

Primer design, reverse transcription and PCR for
confirming gene expression patterns
Oligonucleotide primers were designed using on-line software Primer3 [102] and double-checked for possible self and
primer-primer interactions using the on-line Oligo Analysis
and Plotting Tool (Operon) [103]. Custom primers were constructed by Eurogentec (Angers, France) and are provided in
Table S1 in Additional data file 7.
All RNA samples were diluted to 37.5 ng μl-1 prior to reverse
transcription (RT; final reaction concentration 16.9 ng μl-1)
using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) with
oligo-dT 20 mers following the manufacturer's protocol with
the following temperature selections: RNA was denatured
with primer and dNTPs at 65°C for 5 minutes followed by
transfer to ice immediately prior to addition of enzyme and
buffer. RT was performed at 55°C for 10 minutes, 60°C for 30
minutes, 65° for 10 minutes, and terminated at 85°C for 5
minutes. RT-negative (RT-) reactions were performed in parallel, substituting water for enzyme. Following the RT termination step, samples were treated with RNase following the
manufacturer's recommended protocol. All RT+ cDNA and
RT- samples were diluted 1:10 prior to testing by PCR. PCRs
were performed using the GoTaq PCR Core System I kit
(Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) with 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2
mM dNTPs, and 0.2 μM of forward and reverse primers. The
thermocycler protocol included an initial 2-minute denaturation at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 45 s denaturation at
95°C, 30 s annealing at 60°C, 90 s extension at 72°C. When
preliminary PCR tests showed that the product from genomic
DNA was less than 1 kb, the extension was typically shortened
to 60 s.
