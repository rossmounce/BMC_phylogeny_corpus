Background: The monotremes, represented by the duck-billed platypus and the echidnas, are the
most divergent species within mammals, featuring a flamboyant mix of reptilian, mammalian and
specialized characteristics. To understand the evolution of the mammalian major histocompatibility
complex (MHC), the analysis of the monotreme genome is vital.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is of central
importance for adaptive and innate immunity in vertebrates
[1]. Sequencing MHCs from several species of eutherian

mammals and human has led to the identification of approximately 220 genes located within an interval of 3.5-4 Mbp
[2,3]. The MHC region contains genes encoding class I and
class II receptors that are involved in peptide display, genes

Conclusion: Molecular and cytogenetic analyses reveal new insights into the evolution of the
mammalian MHC and the multiple sex chromosome system of monotremes. In addition, our data
establish the first homology link between chicken microchromosomes and the smallest
chromosomes in the monotreme karyotype. Our results further suggest that segments of the
monotreme MHC that now reside on separate chromosomes must once have been syntenic and
that the complex sex chromosome system of monotremes is dynamic and still evolving.

Results: We characterized several MHC containing bacterial artificial chromosome clones from
platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) and the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and
mapped them onto chromosomes. We discovered that the MHC of monotremes is not contiguous
and locates within pseudoautosomal regions of two pairs of their sex chromosomes. The analysis
revealed an MHC core region with class I and class II genes on platypus and echidna X3/Y3. Echidna
X4/Y4 and platypus Y4/X5 showed synteny to the human distal class III region and beyond. We
discovered an intron-containing class I pseudogene on platypus Y4/X5 at a genomic location
equivalent to the human HLA-B,C region, suggesting ancestral synteny of the monotreme MHC.
Analysis of male meioses from platypus and echidna showed that MHC chromosomes occupy
different positions in the meiotic chains of either species.

that are responsible for peptide generation and transport, as
well as genes encoding complement factors or cytokines.
Many other genes with functions that are not related to
immunity and defense are also located within the MHC.
The eutherian MHC subdivides into a single class II region
followed by several class I regions, interlaced by framework
gene regions. The central framework gene region, located
between the class II region and the class I region that encodes
the HLA-B and HLA-C genes in human, is also known as the
class III region (flanked by the genes Btnl2 and Bat1/Mccd1;
Figure 1a). This genomic architecture of MHC regions is
remarkably well conserved in eutherian mammals. For
instance, the position of the human HLA-B,C class I gene
cluster matches rat RT1-CE, mouse H2-D,L,Q, swine SLA6,7,8 and ovine β [4-8]. In each of these species, this particular class I gene block is flanked by the Bat1/Mccd1 and Pou5f1
framework genes. The same is true for the three other human
class I gene clusters and their counterparts in other eutherian
genomes, all of which locate at the same position, that is, are
flanked by the same framework genes (see framework gene
numbering in Figure 1a), even though not all of them contain
active class I gene loci. The fact that only certain positions of
the MHC support 'homing' of class I genes has previously
been recognized and is known as the framework hypothesis
[9].
In contrast to the conserved MHC architecture, much plasticity is observed within class I gene containing segments and, to
a lesser extent, in the class II region. Orthologous class I
genes are found in closely related species, for example,
human and chimpanzees. Class I gene orthology becomes less
apparent when more distantly related mammals are compared. This is attributed to the ongoing process of new class I
genes arising by gene duplication and, at the same time, their
disappearance from the genome by mutational inactivation or
by deletion. For example, the sequences of the classical class
I genes from rat form a separate clade when compared to class
I genes from mouse, indicating species-specific evolution
since separation of the two lineages 20 million years (Myr)
ago [4].

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/8/R175

In addition to comparative studies on eutherian mammals,
other species have been studied and compared to the eutherians: recently, the sequence of a metatherian mammal (marsupial) MHC from the opossum (Monodelphis domestica)
was assembled, based on whole genome shotgun sequence
data [10]. Its annotation revealed a core MHC region, resembling the eutherian class II region, that, unlike in eutherian
mammals, also encodes the class I genes. The opossum MHC
was found to be syntenic to a human MHC region of several
megabase pairs. Also in Xenopus tropicalis extensive synteny
with the eutherian MHC has been found. Ohta et al. [11] analyzed the scaffolds that were generated from assembling
Xenopus whole genome shotgun data for the presence of
MHC-encoded genes, including framework genes. They
found eight 200-900 kbp scaffolds that contained orthologs
to many of the genes in the eutherian MHC. The interpretation is that the syntenies of the MHC region are ancient and
predate the amphibian-mammalian split 350 Myr ago even
though it has not been shown that these scaffolds reside on a
single chromosome. In contrast, the MHC of the chicken, representing a lineage that is closer to mammals than Xenopus
(distance aves-mammalia of 310 Myr [12]), is highly derived
and does not align well with the human MHC [13]. The
chicken MHC is remarkably different and contains only 19
genes within 92 kbp on chicken chromosome 16.
Monotremes are prototherian mammals, possessing fur and
mammary glands, but uniquely combining reptilian features,
for example, egg-laying with mammalian characteristics.
They are the earliest offshoot of the mammalian clade that
separated from theria (consisting of metatheria and eutheria,
or marsupials and placental mammals, respectively) over 160
Myr ago [14]. The only extant prototheria are the duck-billed
platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), the short-beaked
echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and three species of longbeaked echidnas (Zaglossus sp.) [15]. The geographic range
of current monotremes is restricted to Australia and nearby
islands, including Papua New Guinea. In the following, when
mentioning echidna, we refer to the short-beaked echidna,
also known as the spiny anteater.

Because of their unique phylogenetic position, monotremes
are ideal species to unravel the characteristics of the ancestral
mammalian MHC. So far, little is known about MHC genes in
monotremes and there are only two reports where individual
cDNA clones were identified as MHC class I or class II genes
[16,17].
The general importance of monotremes for understanding
the evolution and function of the mammalian genome is now
generally accepted and is reflected by the presently ongoing
efforts to sequence the platypus genome, with funding from
the National Institute of Health (NIH) [18].
The platypus karyotype consists of 21 pairs of autosomes and
10 sex chromosomes (X1Y1-X5Y5 in males and X1X1-X5X5 in
females). In addition, the platypus karyotype contains a
number of very small chromosomes that have been proposed
to be bird-like microchromosomes; however, the homology
between these chromosomes and chicken microchromosomes has been controversial and no homologies have been
identified to date [19,20]. The sex chromosomes assemble as
a chain at prophase I during male meiosis where they adopt
an XY alternating pattern, which ensures the segregation into
X1-X5 and Y1-Y5 bearing sperm [21,22]. Although XY shared
regions are required to ensure meiotic pairing, chromosome
painting could not identify pseudoautosomal regions on some
of the sex chromosomes so far. The echidna karyotype contains 27 autosomes and 10 sex chromosomes in females and 9
sex chromosomes in males, which where determined by
counting the number of elements of the meiotic chain [23,24].
Very little is known about the gene content of both sex chromosome systems.
Here we describe the identification and characterization of
genomic clones encompassing parts of the monotreme MHC.
The unexpected localization of MHC genes on sex chromosomes of platypus and echidna provides valuable information
about chromosomal homologies between aves, monotremes
and eutheria, as well as homologies between platypus and
echidna sex chromosomes.

probe was generated matching a segment of Pou5f1 whose
translation had 100% amino acid identity in rat, chicken and
zebrafish (rat POU5F1 residues 174-185).
Twenty-four platypus BACs positive with the class I probe
and ten clones positive with the class II probe were identified
in a BAC library with eleven-fold genome coverage. Based on
Southern blots, two clones (BACs 446c3 and 462c1) were positive with both class I and class II gene probes (data not
shown). More than 30 BAC clones were identified with the
Bat1 and Pou5f1 probes. These genes co-localized in platypus,
as several BACs hybridized with both probes. We sequenced
and annotated the following three platypus BAC clones: BAC
462c1 (GenBank EU030443, class I and class II positive; Figure 2a); BAC 466a15 (GenBank EU030444, containing Bat1
and Pou5f1; Figure 2b); and BAC 362a17 (GenBank
EU030442, class I positive). In the following, these BACs will
be referred to as platypus BAC1, BAC2, and BAC3.
Using probes based on platypus MHC sequences, we searched
for BACs from the corresponding regions in the echidna
genome. A platypus Tap2 probe identified two positive clones
in echidna (BACs 48g5 and 287o10; Additional data file 1a).
Separate Southern blots prepared from these clones were
hybridized with the Oran2-1 probe [16] and with a pool of two
different class II gene oligonucleotide probes (Additional data
file 1b,c). Echidna BAC 48g5 was found to contain class I and
class II gene sequences, while BAC 287o10 contained class I
sequences but no class II genes. Shared restriction fragments
indicated that these two clones were from the same locus and
overlapped.
Further echidna BAC colony screens were done using oligonucleotide probes designed on the platypus genes Bat1 and
Pou5f1. For each gene, three probes were synthesized and
pooled before labeling (one pool per gene). Echidna BAC
clones 107j4, 129j16, 152g23 and 268a21 could be confirmed
on Southern blots to contain both the Bat1 and Pou5f1 genes
(Additional data file 1d,e).

Results
Identification of BAC clones from the platypus and
echidna MHC
We identified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones
from the platypus MHC by hybridization with oligonucleotide
probes designed from the platypus class I gene Oran2-1 [16],
the class II gene DZB [17], and from the MHC framework
genes Bat1 and Pou5f1 encoding a DEAD-Box helicase and a
stem cell transcription factor, respectively. Probes for the
framework genes were designed by aligning the chicken Bat1
and Pou5f1 mRNA sequences with the rat MHC [4]. A 36-mer
oligonucleotide probe for Bat1 corresponded to rat BAT1
amino acid residues 265-276, which are 100% conserved
between rat, chicken and zebrafish. A 37-mer oligonucleotide

We generated reference gene models for the genes identified
within platypus BACs 1-3, combining the gene prediction programs Genscan [25] and Genewise [26] as tools and utilized
rat MHC protein sequences [4] as input for Genewise predictions. The translation products from predictions with either
program were compared to each other and to the rat protein
as a reference by pairwise blast (Additional data file 7). In the
absence of monotreme expressed sequence tag (EST)
sequences for the majority of genes, the annotations covered
open reading frames (ORFs) and did not include untranslated
regions (UTRs). Genscan and Genewise complement each
other: The accuracy of Genewise is very good in coding
regions that are well conserved, while theoretical gene models
predicted by Genscan are exclusively based on signals and
content. In total, we annotated 25 genes and two pseudogenes

class I homology was considered as the reason why the clone
had been positive in the BAC colony screen, even though the
clone was not MHC-derived.

Ib genes [4]. Following this reasoning, the two novel platypus
gene classes I-1 and I-2 could be classical class I genes (Ia)
and the loci that Miska et al. [16] identified in both echidna
and platypus correspond to non-classical (Ib) class I genes.
However, this hypothesis would need support from expression data.

Analysis of the platypus core MHC

The sequence of BAC2 was assembled to a finished length of
194,463 bp. It contained 20 genes in a region that extended
from Bat4 to Cdsn (Figures 1c and 2b). Thus, this sequence
covers part of the class III region up to Bat1/Mccd1, spans a
segment that in the human MHC encodes the HLA-B and
HLA-C genes, and contains part of the adjacent framework
region distal to Pou5f1. The gene order and transcriptional
orientation of genes is the same as in other mammalian
MHCs. However, we could not identify Ncr3 in the platypus
sequence. Ncr3 encodes the natural cytotoxicity triggering
receptor 3 and has not been annotated in the opossum MHC
but was discovered in both the human HLA and rat RT1.
Human and rat NCR3 proteins evolve rapidly and share only
64% amino acid identity (Additional data file 7), which is
much lower than the average identity of 88% that has been
observed for protein orthologs in these species [31]. Thus,
similarity to a putative platypus Ncr3 gene may have been too
low for detection. Between Aif1 and Lst1 where Ncr3 is
located in human and rat, Genscan predicts a platypus gene
with correct position and orientation. This prediction could
not be verified by homology searches in the NCBI databases,
but might be a very diverged version of the Ncr3 gene. Alternatively, Ncr3 might have been deleted from the platypus
genome or might be eutheria specific.

The region between Bat1 and Pou5f1 harbors a class I gene
block in the MHC of placental mammals. In rat, this region
spans 340 kbp and contains 16 class I genes. In platypus, the
corresponding region is only 19 kbp in size and contains a
class I gene fragment (Oran-ps1) that consists of two exon
fragments encoding α2 and α3 domains that are separated by
a 283 bp intron. This suggests that the interval once encoded
at least one active class I gene in platypus. The sequence identity of the Oran-ps1 translation product to known and new
monotreme class I sequences is only 30-40%. We could not
find the active counterpart of Oran-ps1 by searching the
ENSEMBL platypus whole-genome assembly Oana-5.0 [32],
suggesting that Oran-ps1 was inactivated a long time ago. The

Between platypus proteins and their orthologs in rat or
human we found an average of 61-62% amino acid identity
(Additional data file 7) and observed much variation in the
degree of sequence conservation (range: 27-99%). For
instance, BAT1, which is involved in mRNA splicing and
transport, was 99% conserved, showing that little innovation
in such processes has occurred over the past 160 Myr. In contrast, the framework gene Lst1, encoding a protein of
unknown function, had an identity of less than 30%.

The two class I loci are tentatively named platypus class I-1
and class I-2 genes. We calculated phylogenetic trees including class I genes from eutheria, marsupials, monotremes, reptiles and birds, as well as amphibia. While for eutheria only
major lineages were represented in the tree (primates, carnivors, rodents, cetartiodactyls and so on), we included class
I sequences from all available marsupial taxons (presently
five species), and all monotreme class I sequences currently
in GenBank. In addition, the analysis encompassed class I
genes from two species of birds (chicken and duck) and four
species of reptiles. Amphibian class I genes served as outgroup (Figure 4). All monotreme sequences grouped at the
base of the mammalian subclade. Unexpectedly, echidna and
platypus class I sequences previously described by Miska and
co-workers [16] grouped together, whereas the novel platypus
class I-1 and class I-2 genes were in a separate branch (Figure
4; Additional data files 3 and 4). The divergence time between
echidna and platypus has been estimated to be approximately
20 Myr [27-29], a similar time span as the reported split
between the mouse and rat lineages [30]. It has been shown
in the two rodent species that class Ia genes are species-specific, while orthology exists among the more slowly evolving

The three framework genes were discovered as the platypus
orthologs of the immunoproteasome subunit Psmb8, as well
as Tap1 (only partially contained in the BAC sequence) and
Tap2, which encode for subunits of the antigen peptide transporter. These genes are typically found in the class II region
of mammalian MHCs, even though they are involved in the
generation and transport of peptides for display by class I
molecules. However, in contrast to the MHCs of eutheria and
similar to the opossum MHC, platypus possesses an MHC
with class II and class I genes being co-localized (Figure 1a,b).

reviews

In the finished sequence of platypus BAC1 (126,374 bp), seven
genes were identified, including two class II genes, two class I
genes and three framework genes. One of the two class II
genes has a sequence identity of 97% to the platypus class II β
chain gene DZB [17], and presumably represents a novel DZB
allele. The other class II locus encodes a class II α chain gene,
and phylogenetic analysis suggested orthology with the DRA
genes of the tammar wallaby (marsupial) and eutheria (Figure 3 and Additional data file 6). The classification of this
gene as a platypus DRA ortholog is supported by neighbor
joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) analysis. On
maximum likelihood (ML) trees, the branching of DRA
orthologs was not resolved (Additional data file 5). The
orthology of the α chain gene to DRA genes is surprising,
since DZB locates to a separate branch in phylogenetic analyses and is non-orthologous to all other β chain subfamilies
[17].

Chromosomal mapping of platypus MHC BAC clones

We localized the monotreme MHC to PARs of sex chromosomes. This is the first time MHC genes have been mapped

information

The platypus MHC is unusual when compared to MHCs from
eutherian mammals, because it contains a core region that

Discussion

The intron-containing class I pseudogene Oran-ps1 and the
surrounding region that corresponds to the distal class III
region and beyond map to platypus chromosome Y4/X5. In
contrast, the core MHC locates to X3/Y3. In the eutherian
MHC, class I genes are distributed among several class I gene
clusters, separated by hundreds of kilobase-pairs of
intervening regions. Despite such distances, concerted evolution takes place between different class I blocks within a species. For instance, the rat RT1-A and RT1-CE regions are more
than 1.2 Mbp apart and have a history of transposition events
that led to the presence of similar class I genes and shared
non-class I gene sequences (gene fragments) in both intervals. Similar but unrelated transposition events were
observed within the mouse MHC region, showing that reorganization across large genomic distances is fairly common
[4]. These distances seem to be large when considering linear
DNA but the regions may be actually juxtaposed in chromatin, facilitating transposition. Oran-ps1 is flanked by Bat1 and
Pou5f1 and these framework genes also flank a class I gene
cluster in the eutherian MHC. Thus, Oran-ps1 may have been
generated during concerted evolution of class I genes in the
platypus MHC at a time when the distal class III region and
the core MHC were still on the same chromosome. However,
concerted evolution between MHC segments on different
platypus chromosomes could be still ongoing, by means of
trans-interaction of separate chromosomes [33].

refereed research

To investigate whether the pseudoautosomal location of the
MHC is unique to platypus or a common feature in
monotremes, we isolated and characterized MHC clones from
echidna (see above and Additional data file 1). Two sets of
echidna BAC clones were obtained. The first set of BACs covered an interval equivalent to platypus BAC1 and contained
the core MHC region with class I and class II genes. The second set of BACs spanned the region encompassing Bat1 and
Pou5f1 (Additional data file 1). The FISH mapping results
revealed that the echidna MHC resides, similar to platypus,
on two different pairs of sex chromosomes (Figure 5b). The
selected BAC containing the core MHC region mapped to X3/
Y3, as in the platypus. The echidna BAC that contained Bat1
and Pou5f1 located to X4/Y4, different to the location in
platypus (Y4/X5). In meiotic chains, chromosomes X3, Y3,
X4, Y4, and X5 correspond to chain elements 5 to 9. Figure 6
shows the FISH mapping result of two echidna BACs onto
echidna male meiotic chains. In the chain, the two echidna
BACs map to elements 5, 6, 7, and 8, whereas the corresponding BACs in platypus locate in elements 5, 6, 8 and 9. Thus,
platypus Y4X5 occupies a different position in the echidna sex
chromosome chain. Since the chromosome morphology of
platypus X5 appears to be identical to X4 in echidna, this indicates that platypus X5 has changed its position in the echidna
chain.

FISH mapping of echidna MHC BACs

reports

We determined the localization of the sequenced BAC clones
on platypus chromosomes using FISH. Surprisingly, the
results showed that the monotreme MHC is not contiguous,
and maps to pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) of two pairs of
sex chromosomes: BAC1 was localized on X3/Y3 and BAC2
mapped to Y4/X5 (Figure 5a).

encodes both class I and class II genes, though such a common class I/II region has also been described in the opossum
[10]. The coincidence of compact class I/II regions in both a
monotreme and a marsupial supports the hypothesis that this
is the ancestral organization of the mammalian MHC. However, a platypus class I gene fragment, Oran-ps1, exists at a
position that contains a class I gene block in eutheria. Also,
the opossum MHC contains a class I-like MIC gene at this
position (Figure 1). Both findings contradict the strict concept
of a core MHC and indicate that early mammals already
encoded class I genes outside a common class I/II region at
positions equivalent to class I gene blocks in eutheria, embedded between framework genes.

reviews

283 bp intron within Oran-ps1 is not conserved in other class
I loci and cannot, therefore, be used for phylogenetic analysis
to date the age of the gene.

onto sex chromosomes in any mammal or vertebrate. In all
mammals investigated so far, the MHC region is located on a
single autosome, and in most cases without interruptions.
Exceptions are the swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) complex,
where the centromere of chromosome 7 separates the class II
region from the other parts of the MHC [34] and the recently
described class I genes of the tammar wallaby, which were
found to be dispersed in the wallaby genome [35].
The multiple sex chromosomes in platypus and echidna pair
at the first meiotic division and form a sex chromosome chain
during prophase I. PARs are necessary to ensure pairing and
segregation of most mammalian sex chromosomes. The ten
sex chromosomes of platypus, therefore, would require nine
PARs to connect the sex chromosomes at meiosis. The extent
of XY homology (that is, the size of PARs; see below) is clearly
different among the sex chromosomes. While some PARs are
large enough and could easily be identified by chromosome
painting, other PARs seem to be much smaller and did not
show XY homology using whole chromosome paints [21,22].
We found that MHC genes reside on two of these small PARs
in platypus. BAC2 was mapped to the PARs of Y4 and the
short arm of X5. This fits with the orientation of X5 in the
chain where the short arm lies towards Y4 [21]. Together with
the fact that chromosome painting could not detect these
PARs, it shows that the Y4X5 shared region is much smaller
than the extensive homology found between, for example, X1
and Y1.

PAR sizes vary widely. For instance, the human PAR regions
PAR1 and PAR2 differ eight-fold with respect to their sizes,
and in the mouse, PAR1 is almost four-fold smaller than in
human [36]. The small size of PARs and an obligatory
crossover to ensure proper segregation at meiosis results in a
high recombination frequency in mammalian PARs [37]. It is
therefore interesting to note that the MHC, which is one of the
recombination hotspots in the human genome, resides within
the PAR, another recombination hotspot.
Another special feature of the monotreme karyotype is the
presence of several tiny chromosomes. Initially they where
regarded similarly to reptilian microchromosomes [38,39],
which was later disputed on the basis of even distribution of
chromosome size in the monotreme karyotype [19].
Microchromosomes have long been regarded as heterochromatic elements but have been shown recently to represent the
gene rich regions of the chicken genome [40]. The identification of the ten sex chromosomes in platypus revealed that
some distinctively small chromosomes are not autosomes,
but part of the sex chromosome system (Y3, X4, Y4). The
mapping of MHC genes (class I, class II, Tap1, Tap2) on X3Y3
provides the first evidence for homology to the MHC bearing
chicken microchromosome 16. Likewise, five of the MHC
framework genes that map on Y4X5 (Bat2, Aif1, Tnf/Lta,
Atp6v1g2) locate to chicken microchromosome 17, establishing another novel synteny link between the genomes of
monotremes and birds.

chins of platypus and echidna. The key feature is a rearrangement between elements of the chain, which explains the different positioning of the MHC bearing sex chromosomes in
platypus and echidna as well as the change of orientation of
platypus X5 in echidna. We propose that three events led to
the observed similarities and differences between platypus
and echidna sex chromosome chains (Figure 7). Firstly, an Xautosome translocation captured the MHC-bearing chromosome into the sex chromosome system in a common platypus/echidna ancestor. In a second step, synteny of the MHC
was disrupted by recruitment of a pair of autosomes into the
chain. In echidna, we propose a further reciprocal translocation between two sex chromosomes, leading to the observed
differences in the echidna sex chromosome chain and the
positions of the MHC chromosomes contained therein.
The comparative mapping of the MHC in echidna and platypus provides evidence for homology between the sex chromosome systems in platypus and echidna. Our results support
the idea that an originally syntenic MHC has been disrupted
as a result of the evolution of the platypus and echidna meiotic sex chromosome chain. Following an initial X-autosome
translocation in a common platypus/echidna ancestor, subsequent translocations resulted in the differences observed in
echidna and platypus sex chromosome systems.

Shotgun library construction and sequencing
BAC clones were grown in 1,000 ml cultures at 37°C with agitation (200 rpm) in a shaking incubator over night. DNA was
prepared using the alkaline lysis method and purification on
a CsCl gradient in a Beckman centrifuge (VTi65i2 rotor) at
45,000 rpm for 20 h, followed by DNA extraction [41].
Finally, DNA was dissolved in 100 μl 1 × TE. Using a Branson
Sonifier 250 (Branson Ultrasonic, Danbury, CT, USA), 10 μg
BAC DNA was sheared in a volume of 200 μl to an average
size of 1.5 kbp, and after precipitation blunt-ended with Klenow fragment (USB, Cleveland, OH, USA) and T4 DNA
polymerase (New England Biolabs). End-repaired fragments
were size selected by electrophoresis on a gel of 0.8% SeaPlaque GTG agarose (Biozym, Hess. Oldendorf, Germany) in
1 × TAE buffer (40 mM Tris base, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM acetic
acid). A gel slice that contained fragments of 1.2-2 kbp was cut
out, molten at 55°C and incubated at 37°C for 3 h in the presence of 10 u agarase (Sigma-Aldrich) per 100 μl of solution.
Following chloroform-phenol extraction, the DNA was precipitated and dissolved in 10 μl 1 × TE buffer. Ligation with 30
ng of dephosphorylated, SmaI cut pUC19 and 200-300 ng
size-selected DNA was carried out at 16°C overnight, using
400 u T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). A 1 μl ligation

osid (IPTG) and 400 μl 50 mg/ml ampicillin per 400 ml
medium. Colonies were arrayed into 384-well plates
(Genetix, Dornach, Germany) using in-house custom-built
robotic devices. Plates contained 2YT medium supplemented
with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and 1 × HMFM freezing mix (0.4
mM MgSO4 × 7H2O, 1.6 mM Tri-sodium citrate × 2H2O, 6.8
mM (NH4)2SO4, 3.6% glycerol, 13.2 mM KH2PO2 and 26 mM
K2HPO4). Plates were incubated at 37°C for at least 12 h and
subsequently shock-frozen on dry ice. Sequencing was carried
out on PCR amplified pUC19 inserts, using the BigDye terminator chemistry on ABI3700 automated sequencers. Initial
sequence coverage of BACs was up to ten-fold. Thereafter,
gaps were closed directionally. Analyzed regions were manually edited in GAP4 [42]. Annotation of assembled BACs was
carried out using Genscan and Genewise [25,26]. Exon coordinates in PIPmaker format and predicted translations are
available (Additional data files 8 and 9).

Phylogenetic analysis
We searched the NCBI protein database for MHC class I
genes and class II α chain genes in all species groups ranging
from amphibians to mammals, based on the NCBI
TaxBrowser classification and recorded all the species found.
Opossum class I sequences were taken from [43]. We selected
only sequences that, by their length, indicated that they were
full-coding or nearly so, thereby excluding gene fragments
from further processing. The panel of sequences was further
reduced by manual inspection of alignments; that is, if several
similar sequences representing a gene were found in the data
set, only one was kept. We tried to maximize the number of
taxonomic entities while keeping the dataset manageable at
the same time. In order to achieve this, some taxonomic
groups were left represented by a single species only, for
example, rat for Glires and human for primates. Also, the
number of paralogs per species was reduced in most cases,
except for marsupials and monotremes. Multiple alignments
were carried out with clustalw [44] using default settings. We
calculated NJ trees using Poisson correction as substitution
model with homogeneous pattern among lineages, pairwise
deletion, and gamma distributed rates among sites with α =
2. We compared the NJ branching to MP and ML trees (Figures 3 and 4; Additional data files 3-6). ML trees were calculated using TreePuzzle [45] and visualized with TreeView
[46]. NJ and MP tree calculation and visualization were carried out with MEGA 3.1 [47].

Preparation of chromosomes and meiotic cells
Mitotic metaphase chromosomes were prepared from established platypus and echidna fibroblast cell lines. Primary cultures were set up from toe web from animals captured at the
Upper Barnard River, New South Wales, Australia, during
breeding season (AEC permit no. S-49-2006 to FG). The captured animals were killed with an intraperitoneal injection of
pentobarbitone sodium (Nembutal, Boehringer Ingelheim,
North Ryde, NSW, Austrialia) at a dose of 0.1 mg/g body
weight. Meiotic cells and sperm were obtained by crushing

the testis. The material was either directly fixed in methanol/
acetic acid (3:1) or incubated in 0.075 M KCl at 37°C as hypotonic treatment and then fixed.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization of BAC clones
DNA (1 μg) from BAC clones was directly labeled with spectrum orange or spectrum green (Vysis, Abbot Molecular, Des
Plaines, IL, USA) using random primers and Klenow
polymerase. Hybridization by FISH to platypus or echidna
metaphase chromosomes and echidna meiotic chromosomes
was performed under standard conditions. Briefly, the slides
were treated with 100 μg/ml RNase A/2 × SSC 37°C for 30
minutes and with 0.01% pepsin in 10 mM HCl at 37°C for 10
minutes. After re-fixing for 10 minutes in 1 × PBS, 50 mM
MgCl2, 1% formaldehyde, the preparations were dehydrated
in an ethanol series. Slides were denatured for 2.5 minutes at
75°C in 70% formamide, 2 × SSC, pH 7.0 and again dehydrated. For hybridization of one half slide, 10 μl of probe DNA
was co-precipitated with 10-20 μg of boiled genomic platypus
or echidna DNA as competitor, and 50 μg salmon sperm DNA
as carrier, and dissolved in 50% formamide, 10% dextran
sulfate, 2 × SSC. The hybridization mixture was denatured for
10 minutes at 80°C. Pre-annealing of repetitive DNA
sequences was carried out for 30 minutes at 37°C. The slides
were hybridized overnight in a moist chamber at 37°C and,
thereafter, washed three times for 5 minutes in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC at 42°C and once for 5 minutes in 0.1 × SSC.
Chromosomes and cell nuclei were counterstained with 1 μg/
ml DAPI in 2 × SSC for 1 minute and mounted in 90% glycerol, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 2.3% DABCO. Images were
taken with a Zeiss AxioImager Z.1 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera and Zeiss Axiovision
software.
