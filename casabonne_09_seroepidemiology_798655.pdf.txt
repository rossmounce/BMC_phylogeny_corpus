Abstract
Background: Despite intensive study of high-risk mucosal human papillomaviruses (HPV), little is
known of the epidemiology of cutaneous HPV. As part of a study of cutaneous squamous cell
carcinoma and HPV among organ transplant recipients (OTR) from London and Oxford, we
investigated the seroprevalence and risk factors for 34 HPV types (detected using Luminex
technology) among 425 Caucasian OTR without skin cancer.
Results: Overall, 86% of participants were seropositive to at least one HPV: 41% to mucosal alpha
types, 33% to cutaneous alpha types, 57% to alpha types, 56% to beta, 47% to gamma types and
45% to other types (nu, mu, HPV101 and 103). In both centres, the most common types were
HPV6 (33% and 26% for London and Oxford respectively), HPV8 (24% and 18%), HPV15 (26% and
29%), HPV17 (25% and 21%), HPV38 (23% and 21%), HPV49 (19% and 21%), HPV4 (27% and 23%),
HPV65 (30% and 25%), HPV95 (22% and 20%), HPV1 (33% and 24%) and HPV63 (28% and 17%).
The seroprevalence of 8 HPV types differed significantly (P < 0.05) between London and Oxford.
Those individuals seropositive to multiple types of one genus were more likely to be seroreactive
to multiple types of another genus. As expected, antibodies against mucosal alphaHPV types were
more frequent in younger patients and among women. Sunbed use and sunbathing was associated
with seropositivity to multiple gammaHPV (P-trend = 0.007) and self-history of abnormal smear
was related to seroactivity to multiple betaHPV (P = 0.01). Skin type and other self reported
markers of exposure to ultraviolet radiation were not consistently associated with any HPV types.

No other distinguishing epidemiological features of transplant recipients with antibodies against
single or multiple HPV types were identified.
Conclusion: Findings for mucosal HPV types were in line with results from previous studies. We
observed differences in HPV seroprevalence between organ transplant recipients from two
geographically close centres but no clear risk factor was found associated with cutaneous HPV
seropositivity among organ transplant recipients. These findings have implications for
interpretation of future seroepidemiology studies addressing the association between HPV and
cutaneous SCC in OTR populations.

Background

Methods

Papillomaviruses are small circular double-stranded DNA
viruses of around 8 kb. To date, at least one hundred and
eighteen papillomaviruses have been completely
described of which approximately 100 are human and the
remainder are animal types. Based on DNA analysis, the
HPV phylogenetic tree is composed of 5 genera (alpha,
beta, gamma, mu and nu papillomaviruses) which, in
turn, are grouped into species and subdivided into types
[1].

Study population
The present study was conducted as part of research examining the relationship between antibodies against the
major capsid protein L1 of 34 HPV types and cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma among OTR. More information
on the study design and data collection can be found elsewhere [9]. Overall the response rates were 96% and 82%
in London and Oxford respectively and all eligible
patients have had an equal opportunity to enter the study.
All organ transplant recipients from Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals and from Barts and London NHS Trust were invited
to participate in the study and were recruited between
October 2002 and August 2006. Patients underwent transplantation between 1964 and 2005 in Oxford and
between 1972 and 2006 in London. In London, all
patients have access to a dedicated dermatology clinic following their usual visit to the transplant centre, are seen
routinely within 6-12 months of transplant and undergo
routine dermatological examinations thereafter at which
all benign and malignant lesions are recorded and treated
if necessary. For the present study, patients were recruited
at routine clinic visits and completed a questionnaire
delivered by a specialist nurse and were examined by a
dermatologist. In Oxford, patients are referred to a dermatologist if a suspicious skin lesion is present, but are not
otherwise under routine surveillance. Therefore, OTR
attending the Oxford Transplant Centre were invited by
mail to take part in the study and to complete a questionnaire. At the next clinic visit, this questionnaire was
checked and finalised by a dermatologist who also conducted an examination of the participants' skin, recording
all benign and malignant cutaneous lesions. Treatments
were initiated where indicated and educational information relating to the risks of skin cancer in OTR was also
provided. In both centres, a blood sample was taken and
serum, buffy coat and red blood cells were separated, aliquoted and frozen at -80°Celsius. In total, 425 OTR
patients without skin cancer were recruited in the 2 centres (243 from London and 182 from Oxford).

Human papillomaviruses infect either cutaneous or
mucosal epithelium. High-risk mucosal HPV types (e.g.
16, 18, 31 and 33) are causative for cancers of the uterine
cervix [2], but other types are responsible for benign cutaneous viral warts [3]. For instance, common warts seen on
the skin of arm, hand and leg are often associated with
HPV 1, 2, 4, 7 and 57; flat warts are usually caused by HPV
3, 10 and sometimes 2 and are more commonly observed
in immunosuppressed patients or patients with a rare
inherited skin disease, epidermodysplasia verruciformis.
Genital warts (condyloma acuminata), oral warts and
low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions are
mainly caused by HPV 6 and 11. In addition, HPV are
ubiquitous viruses which are also detected in healthy skin
and hair follicles [4] and betaHPV types might be
involved in the pathogenesis of cutaneous SCC in patients
with a rare skin disease, epidermodysplasia verruciformis
[5].
The natural history of high-risk HPV types in relation to
cervical cancer has been studied intensively [2] but few
data are available on the seroprevalence and risk factors
associated with the other HPV types [6], especially cutaneous HPV types. Organ transplant recipients (OTR) are an
important high risk population to study since there is an
up to 100-fold increased risk of SCC in these patients
compared to the general population [7,8]. While the role
of betaHPV in the development of SCC is still unclear, a
better understanding of the epidemiology of HPV is also
important for future studies on SCC. Here, we investigate
the seroprevalence and risk factors for 34 HPV types
detected using Luminex technology among 425 OTR Caucasian without skin cancer.

Questionnaire
The same questionnaire was used in both centres to collect information on (i) social and demographic details
Page 2 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)

Infectious Agents and Cancer 2009, 4:13

(age, sex, height, weight, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, area of residence, country of birth) (ii) smoking and alcohol history; (iii) medical history (skin and/or
other cancers, psoriasis); (iv) exposure to ultraviolet (UV)
radiation (outdoor occupation and hobbies, sun exposure
before and after transplantation, sun exposure currently,
number of moles and freckles before and after transplantation, history of sunburn in childhood, protective measures against UV radiation, time spent abroad); (v) history
of HPV-related viral infection (cutaneous and genital
warts and history of abnormal smear in women); (vi)
transplantation and dialysis (number of transplantations,
dates, type of dialysis, time spent on dialysis before and
after transplantation, primary diagnosis); (vii) gynaecological and reproductive history for women (age at menopause, number of pregnancies, use of hormonal
contraception, hormone replacement therapy, surgical
removal of uterus). Since it is not clear how cutaneous
HPV are transmitted, the questionnaire also included
some questions on possible risk factors for infection (e.g.
shared bedroom or bed as a child, number of siblings and
number in household, as surrogates for crowding and
proximity). No information on HLA or other infections
was collected. Current immunosuppressive treatment at
recruitment was documented, but a detailed retrospective
history on specific or combined immunosuppressive
treatments was not recorded. All information on transplantation, medications and skin cancers was crosschecked against information held in the renal-centre database and medical records.
Ethical approval
The study in London was approved by the East London
and City Health Authority Research Ethics Committee and
in Oxford by the Mid- and South Buckinghamshire Local
Research Ethics Committee.
HPV multiplex serology
HPV antibody detection was performed by multiplex
serology, an antibody detection method that is based on a
glutathione S-transferase (GST) capture enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, as previously described [10,11] in
combination with fluorescent bead technology [12,13].
All antigens were expressed in E. coli as double fusion of
full-length viral proteins with a N-terminal GST domain
and a C-terminal peptide consisting of the last 11 amino
acids from the large T antigen of simian virus 40 [10]. The
expression constructs for the full length L1 proteins of all
HPV types analyzed here (mucosal alpha: 6, 13 and 16;
cutaneous alpha: 2, 3, 7 and 27; beta: 5, 8, 9, 15, 17, 20,
23, 24, 36, 38, 49, 75, 76, 92, 93, 96; gamma: 4, 65, 95,
48, 50, 60; nu: 41; mu: 1, other types: 101 and 103) are
described in detail elsewhere [6,11,14]. Glutathionecasein was coupled to internally fluorescence-labeled polystyrene beads (Luminex, Austin, TX), and fusion proteins

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/4/1/13

were affinity-purified on the beads directly in a one-step
procedure. Beads with GST and the C-terminal peptide
alone were prepared for background determination. Binding of the antigens (i.e. the GST fusion proteins) to various bead sets was verified with a monoclonal antibody
against the common C-terminal peptide [10]. The differently labeled bead sets carrying different antigens were
mixed and incubated in 96-well plates with human
plasma diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer, as described previously [13]. Antibodies bound to the beads via the viral
antigens were then stained with biotinylated anti-human
immunoglobulin and fluorescent reporter conjugate
streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin. Antibodies bound to antigens on beads were quantified via the reporter fluorescence in the Luminex analyzer, which also identified the
internal bead colour and thus the antigen carried by the
bead. Antibody quantity was determined as the median Rphycoerythrin fluorescence intensity (MFI) from at least
100 beads of the same internal colour after subtraction of
background reactivity (GST and C-terminal peptide
alone).
The assay reproducibility was high (R2 = 0.97) [12,15].
More information on quality control has been described
elswewhere [15]. For all HPV types but HPV6 analyzed
here, MFI cut-offs to define seropositivity for all antigens
were set to 200 MFI as described and discussed previously
[6,14]. To reduce the influence of borderline seropositive
sera, a stringent (doubled) cut-off of 400 MFI was applied
to HPV6. In our previous analysis [14], data analysis using
geometric mean MFI values instead of cut-off values did
not materially change the results.
Statistical methods
To assess the relationship between seropositivity to a single HPV type and various risk factors measured by questionnaire, conditional (on centre) logistic regression
adjusted for sex, age at recruitment (<45, 45-59, ≥ 60
years) and time since transplantation (<5 years, 5 to 9
years, ≥ 10 years) was applied. To examine the association
between the total number of HPV seropositivity (count)
and risk factors, negative binomial regression adjusted for
the same factors and centre was preferred since over-dispersion was observed when Poisson models were fitted
(likelihood ratio test for the null hypothesis of no overdispersion was rejected with P < 0.001). Where results are
presented in the form of plots, black circles indicate the
point estimates and horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals (CI). Skin type was defined using Fitzpatrick classification scale as follows (I) never tans, always
burns, (II) rarely tans, usually burns, (III) usually tans, can
burn and (IV) always tans, rarely burns.

To deal with multiple significant tests the level of statistical significance was set to 1% and when a sufficient

number of patients was available, agreement of results
across centre was used to detect genuine associations.
Missing value categories were added to adjustment variables with incomplete information in order to retain all the
observations in the analyses. Likelihood ratio tests were
used to assess heterogeneity tests. All P-values are twosided. Statistical analyses were carried out using STATA 9
(StataCorp, 2005).

Results
Participants
In total, 425 Caucasian OTR (5 patients [0.8%] from London with a solid organ graft other than kidney) with a
blood sample and a completed questionnaire, but without skin cancer were available for analyses. Table 1 shows
the distribution of OTR by sex, time since transplantation
and age at recruitment for each centre. There was no difference at the 5% level of significance in distribution
between the two centres in terms of these factors.
Prevalence and ubiquity of HPV
Table 2 shows the HPV seroprevalence by genus and summarises the mean number of serotypes. Those individuals
seropositive to multiple types of one genus were more
likely to be seroreactive to multiple types of another
genus. Eighty-six percent of patients were seropositive to
at least one HPV type with 41%, 33%, 56%, 47% and 55%
of patients being seroactive to any alpha mucosal, alpha
cutaneous, beta, gamma and other HPV types respectively.
There was no difference in terms of age at recruitment,
time since transplantation or sex between HPV seronegaTable 1: Descriptive statistics for age at recruitment, sex and

tive patients to all types and those being seropositive to at
least one HPV type (Table 3). Of the 425 Caucasians OTR,
237 (56%) were seropositive to any beta types, 205
patients (48%) were seropositive to HPV8, 9, 15, 17, 38
and/or 49 and only 32 patients (8%) were seropositive to
any of the other 10 betaHPV types. Regarding the gamma
types, 200 patients (47%) were seropositive to any gammaHPV types, 178 (41%) were seropositive to HPV4, 65
and/or 95 (species 1) and 22 patients (5%) were seropositive to any of the three other types (data not shown).
Risk factors associated with single HPV seropositivity
among Caucasian OTR
Additional file 1 shows seroprevalence of the 34 HPV
types by centre, sex, age at recruitment, time since transplantation and skin type. The prevalence of 8/34 HPV
types differed significantly (P ≤ 0.05) between centres. In
both centres, highest seroprevalence was observed for
HPV6 (33% and 26% for London and Oxford respectively), HPV8 (24% and 18%), HPV15 (26% and 29%),
HPV17 (25% and 21%), HPV38 (23% and 21%), HPV49
(19% and 21%), HPV4 (27% and 23%), HPV65 (30%
and 25%), HPV95 (22% and 20%), HPV1 (33% and
24%) and HPV63 (28% and 17%). Seroprevalence was
statistically significantly higher at the 1% level in London
compared to Oxford for 3 cutaneous types; HPV 27 (21%
versus 12% respectively), HPV 63 (28% versus 17%) and
HPV 101 (10% versus 3%), and for 1 mucosal type, HPV
13 (13% versus 5%). As expected, higher HPV seroprevalence was observed in women for HPV16 (25% in female
versus 10% in male) and seroprevalence for mucosal HPV
types (16, 6 and 13) decreased with increasing age (Ptrend < 0.01). The same associations were found when a
larger number of age categories was used (<35, 35-39, 4044, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, ≥ 60) (data not shown). Apart
from an increase in seroprevalence of HPV4 with time
since transplantation (P-trend = 0.01) and a decrease in
seroprevalence of HPV65 with increasing age (P-trend <
0.001), no clear association was found with time since
transplantation for any of the other HPV types examined.
Similarly, no association was found between HPV seroprevalence and skin phototype.

Regarding the other risk factors, patients who were seropositive to HPV6 were more likely to be ex- or current
smokers, to have had more children (P-trend < 0.001) and
to have had a history of genital warts and/or abnormal
cervical smear. A self-reported history of psoriasis (n = 23
patients) was not associated with any of the 34 HPV types
examined. Among women, an association was found
between history of abnormal cervical smear and presence
of antibodies against many betaHPV types (HPV 15, 17,
38, 76 and 92). However, across the 2 centres, only 28
women had such histories and results could not be examined by individual centre (data not shown). No other dis-

recipients with antibodies against any of the 34 HPV types
examined were identified (data not shown).
Risk factors associated with multiple HPV seropositivity
among Caucasian OTR
Figure 1 is a graphical representation of selected risk factors associated with the presence of antibodies against
multiple HPV types by genus. Multiple HPV seropositivity
was more frequent in patients from London as compared
to Oxford for alpha mucosal types and for other types (nu,
mu and 2 not defined types). Young women, past smokers
and female patients reporting a history of having had an
abnormal cervical smear test and/or genital warts were
more likely to be seroreactive to multiple mucosal HPV
types. Women with a self-reported history of abnormal
cervical smear were also more likely to be seropositive to
more beta HPV types than those without such a history
(CR: 2.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 4.5; P = 0.01)
and multiple seropositivity to beta types seemed to be
higher in patients with longer time since transplantation

(P-trend = 0.02). Ultraviolet radiation exposure history
was not associated with seropositivity to a single HPV type
but patients who reported using a sunbed and sunbathing
were twice as likely to have more gamma serotypes than
those who did not (P-trend = 0.007). No other distinguishing epidemiological features of OTR with antibodies
against multiple HPV seropositivity were evident.

Discussion
Little is known of the seroepidemiology of HPV, with the
exception of those mucosal types associated with cancer
of the uterine cervix [2]. Organ transplant recipients
(OTR) are at higher risk of developing skin cancer than the
general population [7,8] and HPV has been suggested as
having a role in the development of cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma [16,17]. Hence, examining potential risk
factors in high risk transplant populations is important to
better understand the epidemiology of HPV. We report
here on risk factors associated with HPV seropositivity for
3 mucosal and 31 cutaneous HPV types across 5 genera
among 425 Caucasian OTR without skin cancer.

Eighty six percent of transplant recipients without skin
cancers in this study were seroreactive to at least one HPV
type, identical to previous results from a UK study among
immunocompetent people [14], illustrating the ubiquity
of HPV [4]. We observed differences in HPV seroprevalence between OTR from 2 geographically close centres
(Oxford and London) perhaps reflecting the importance
of disparity in environmental exposure or even clinical
practice. Individuals seropositive to multiple types of one
genus were also more likely to be seroreactive to multiple
types of another genus. This pattern was also observed in
immunocompetent and dialysis patients (Casabonne et
al., this issue) suggesting that the association was not due
to higher susceptibility to multiple HPV seropositivity of
OTR patients following immunosuppressive treatments.
Multiple HPV seropositivity could reflect infections with
more types due to higher environmental exposure to these
viruses, similar modes of transmission or cross-reactivity
of the antibodies. Alternatively, it could reflect higher viral
load that induced stronger and more frequent antibody
responses. Viral load for beta HPV types could be regulated by genetic or other host factors. EV patients, who
cannot appropriately control beta HPV replication have
high viral loads and strong antibody responses to a broad
variety of beta HPV types [18]. Mutations in EVER1 and
EVER2 genes have been identified as essential genetic
defect in some EV patients [19,20]. In the general population an EVER2 polymorphism has been found positively
associated with beta HPV seropositivity as well as with
increased risk of SCC [21]. If beta HPV contribute to the
pathogenesis of cutaneous SCC it is conceivable that
higher viral load could increase the risk.

Findings for mucosal HPV types were in line with results
from previous studies [2] and provide internal validation
for the multiplex technology used in this study. Associations with time since transplantation and seropositivity to
certain beta or gamma types were not linear, but might
reflect a decline in antibody production following intensive immunosuppressive treatments in the first years following transplantation. However, this remains
speculative and would require prospective HPV serology
studies for confirmation. No association was observed
between the presence of psoriasis (self-reported) and any
of the 34 HPV type examined. Despite the small number
of patients, this result is in line with our recent study on
beta HPV-DNA and psoriasis [22]. There is limited statistical power to examine associations with all of the HPV
types, in part because the prevalence of some is low. Further limitations may arise because details of risk factors
were examined using self-reported information.
The largest previous study of HPV seroprevalence in the
immunocompetent population reported on age and sex
distributions of alpha, beta, gamma, nu and mu HPV
types among 1797 German adults and children [6]. Overall, detection of antibodies against nu and mu types was
evident in childhood whereas seroprevalence to alpha
types was higher in women after puberty; seroprevalence
to beta and gamma types was found to increase with age.
We did not find an association between age and presence
of antibodies against gamma and beta types in our transplant population. Our results in relation to age and
betaHPV differed from the German study [6] suggesting
that the observed differences might reflect differences

between children and adults. Other studies have reported
only on beta HPV seroprevalence and risk factors among
immunocompetent individuals [16,17,23,24]. Termorshuizen et al (2004) reported no association in 313 controls patients between seropositivity to any of 6 beta HPV
types (HPV5, 8, 15, 20, 24 or 38) and age, sex, skin type,
lifetime sun exposure and painful sunburns at different
age periods [23]. Karagas et al (2006) also reported that
seropositivity to any of 8 beta types (HPV 5, 8, 9, 15, 20,
24, 36 or 38) in 461 immunocompetent patients without
skin cancer did not differ in terms of age, level of education, smoking status, skin phototype and number of sunburns, but noted higher beta seroprevalence in men
compared to women [16]. Andersson et al (2008) looked
at 434 immunocompetent patients with and without skin
cancer (basal and squamous cell carcinoma) and also

found no relationship between age, sex, skin type, smoking and previous sunburn and seropositivity to any beta
types (HPV 5, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 24, 36 and 38) [17]. Only
Feltkamp et al (2003) found a statistical significant association between unadjusted seroprevalence of HPV24 and
increasing age and male sex in immunocompetent
patients [24].

Conclusion
In summary, findings on the association between various
risk factors and mucosal HPV types were an internal validation of the methodological approach used in this study.
Significant differences in HPV seroprevalence were identified between study centres. Sunbed use and sunbathing
was associated with seropositivity to multiple gammaHPV
and, among women, self-history of abnormal smear was

related to seroactivity to multiple betaHPV. No other distinguishing epidemiological feature of transplant patients
with antibodies against any of the 34 individuals or multiple HPV types examined were identified. Interpretation
of future HPV and cancer association studies will require
a better understanding of HPV seroepidemiology and further research is now needed to clarify the risk factors and
the natural history of these viruses.
