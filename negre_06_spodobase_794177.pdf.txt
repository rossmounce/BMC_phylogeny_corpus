Abstract
Background: The Lepidoptera Spodoptera frugiperda is a pest which causes widespread economic damage on a variety of crop
plants. It is also well known through its famous Sf9 cell line which is used for numerous heterologous protein productions.
Species of the Spodoptera genus are used as model for pesticide resistance and to study virus host interactions. A genomic
approach is now a critical step for further new developments in biology and pathology of these insects, and the results of ESTs
sequencing efforts need to be structured into databases providing an integrated set of tools and informations.
Description: The ESTs from five independent cDNA libraries, prepared from three different S. frugiperda tissues (hemocytes,
midgut and fat body) and from the Sf9 cell line, are deposited in the database. These tissues were chosen because of their
importance in biological processes such as immune response, development and plant/insect interaction. So far, the SPODOBASE
contains 29,325 ESTs, which are cleaned and clustered into non-redundant sets (2294 clusters and 6103 singletons). The
SPODOBASE is constructed in such a way that other ESTs from S. frugiperda or other species may be added. User can retrieve
information using text searches, pre-formatted queries, query assistant or blast searches. Annotation is provided against NCBI,
UNIPROT or Bombyx mori ESTs databases, and with GO-Slim vocabulary.
Conclusion: The SPODOBASE database provides integrated access to expressed sequence tags (EST) from the lepidopteran
insect Spodoptera frugiperda. It is a publicly available structured database with insect pest sequences which will allow identification
of a number of genes and comprehensive cloning of gene families of interest for scientific community. SPODOBASE is available

Background
Lepidoptera represent a diverse and important group of
agricultural insect pests that cause widespread economic
damage on food and fiber crop plants, fruit trees, forests,
and stored grains. They are also important indicators of
ecosystem diversity and health. Moreover, lepidopteran
insects display experimental advantages such as their large
body size, accessible genetics, and extreme diversity. They
show a large spectrum of interactions with plants and with
numerous parasites or pathogens. Among Lepidoptera,
the genus Spodoptera is largely studied due to its wide geographical distribution area. Indeed Spodoptera species are
scattered over all continents. Presence of S. frugiperda in
the American continent and in the Caribbean area has
been studied in detail [1,2]. S. frugiperda larvae cause
severe damage on many cultivated crops including corn,
rice and maize. S. littoralis is reported to cause damages in
Mediterranean and African subtropical regions as well as
in China whereas S. litura is found in India, Indonesia and
Australia. In addition to being important agricultural
pests these noctuids are biological models studied for several purposes. For example,S. frugiperda is well known
through its famous Sf21 cell line and its Sf9 subclone [3]
which is used for numerous heterologous protein productions. S. frugiperda is also used to study pesticide resistance
[4,5] and baculovirus host interaction [6], whereas S. littoralis is a model species to study pheromone regulations
[7-9] or densovirus pathogenicity [10].
The development of new methods of insect pest management is an important challenge for world economy and
health and it will be facilitated by a better knowledge of
lepidopteran crop pest genomics. Indeed, genome information provides powerful tools for understanding biological mechanisms and functions and is essential for
biology, medical science, and agriculture.

projects have already begun, but the results of only a few
are available, as for example on Choristoneura fumiferana
[18], Helicoverpa armigera [19], Plutella xylostella or Manduca sexta [20]. Some other butterflies are also investigated
[21]. We have developed resources for Spodoptera frugiperda, for which we have created a genomic BAC library
[22] and a set of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from the
well known Sf9 cell line [23]. Other labs have also
reported the development of ESTs collections (Rollie J.
Clem, Kansas State University, pers. comm.).
Here we present the database, named SPODOBASE,
which provides integrated access to expressed sequence
tags (EST) from S. frugiperda. The SPODOBASE currently
contains 29,325 sequences from various organs (Sf9 cell
line, hemocytes, midgut and fat body tissues). The EST
sequences were cleaned and clustered into non-redundant
sets (2294 clusters and 6103 singletons). User can retrieve
information using text searches, pre-formatted queries,
query assistant or blast searches.
This database will enable future functional genomics
studies of a variety of biological processes such as immunity, endocrinology, reproduction or behavior. Since several physiological processes have been shown to be
conserved through evolution, their study in lepidopteran
models will help to further elucidate the function of
homologous genes and will provide complements to the
model insects Drosophila and Anopheles. For example these
two model insects lack the receptors for the largely used
Bacillus thuringiensis toxin as well as for most of the chemical pesticides (acetyl cholinesterase type). One can predict that analysis of the lepidopteran crop pests will
contribute to sustainable agriculture, protection of the
environment and maintenance of biodiversity.

Construction and content
Recent years have shown a tremendous development of
genome projects of various species, in particular for
insects. Among model organisms, genome sequences
have been completed in Drosophila melanogaster [11], the
malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae [12], the honeybee
Apis mellifera [13] and the silkworm Bombyx mori [14,15].
In the year 2002 an International Lepidoptera Genome
Consortium was created, which gathers the cooperative
efforts of various laboratories in the world on genomic
and transcriptomic studies on insects of scientific and economic importance [16]. The project is organized in a
"Bombyx – Plus" scheme, where Bombyx mori represents
the core node of the knowledge both in terms of genetics,
physiology, and EST sequencing [17]. Around this model,
the genomic study of a variety of pests of agronomical
importance has been encouraged, as functional genomics
analysis were still limited by the lack of relevant genome
databases for gene identification. Several EST sequencing

1. Construction of cDNA libraries and sequencing
Four directional cDNA libraries were generated for Spodoptera frugiperda larvae. A Sf9 cell line library has been previously constructed and described [23]. To generate the new
libraries, different tissues of last larval instars, circulating
hemocytes, fat body and midgut, were collected directly in
TRIZOL reagent (InVitroGen). Extracted total RNAs were
reverse transcribed using the SMART cDNA library Construction Kit (Clontech) according to manufacturer
instructions. The library was built in λ Triplex2. From the
phages, excision and circularization of pTriplEx plasmid
was heat-induced at loxP sites in order to generate a plasmid library to be sequenced. The clones were robotpicked from agarose plates (CIRAD platform, Montpellier) and stored in 20% glycerol LB medium in 96-wells
plates. A total of 72, 126 and 191 plates were seeded for
the hemocyte (H), fat body (F) and midgut (M) libraries,
respectively.

The 37,344 bacterial clones were then spotted on high
density Nylon membranes and hybridized with an oligonucleotide probe encompassing the multiple cloning site
in order to detect empty plasmid clones. Hybridization
was conducted at high stringency and allowed the elimination of around 30 % clones in the different libraries.
After colony picking, a limited sequencing test on 1900
clones from the 3 libraries revealed that the percentage of
clones without insert was around 9%, showing an effective but non total rearrangement.
A second hybridization was performed with a probe consisting of a mixture of 40 cDNAs, in order to detect clones
corresponding to cDNAs that were abundantly represented within the previously analyzed Sf9 library. We were
expecting to increase coverage and decrease the number of
sequences corresponding to known housekeeping genes.
This hybridization leaded to the elimination of 0.7%, 1.9
% and 4.4 % of the clones in F, M and H libraries, respectively. We observed (See Table A) that the abundance of
these clones was significantly reduced by this procedure,
as their percentage in the library decreased from 36 % in
the initial Sf9 library to 11 % in the four tissues libraries.
Elimination was not total, probably because the complex
probe does not detect easily all of the 40 genes, but it was
still useful to avoid useless sequencing.
To assess inserts size, DNA was extracted from 96, 48 and
48 clones from the H, F and M libraries, respectively using
the Qiagen DNA extraction kit. Inserts were amplified by
PCR using primers flanking the insert cloning sites and
their size was controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis.
We found an average size of 1.1, 1.0 and 0.9 kb for the S.
frugiperda cDNAs from the H, F and M libraries, respectively.
The libraries were thus re-assorted in a total of 55 plates
for the hemocyte library, 87 plates for the fat body library
and 149 plates for the midgut library, stored in 5% glycerol 2YT medium, in duplicate. From those, 5184 (54
plates), 6048 (63 plates) and 5952 (62 plates) clones were
subjected to sequencing for hemocyte, fat body and midgut libraries, respectively. The plasmid DNAs were
extracted from overnight grown bacterial cultures using an
automated plasmid isolation machine BIO ROBOT 8000
(Qiagen). The cDNAs were sequenced using ABI PRISM
BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kits
on an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) in Insect Genome Laboratory of National Institute
of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS, Japan). All clones were
sequenced from both 5' and 3' extremities using forward
and reverse primers located in the pTriplex vector, in a
region flanking the insert. We thus obtained a total of
10,368, 12,096 and 11,904 sequences for hemocytes, fat
body and midgut respectively.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/322

A second midgut cDNA library was made from pooled
mRNAs extracted from midguts of 3rd instar larvae fed on
artificial diet supplemented with various natural products
and xenobiotics. This library generated a set of 2,688
sequences.
2. The SPODOBASE pipeline
Once the sequences established, they were analyzed and
processed according to the flow chart depicted in Figure 1.
The pipeline developed for EST analysis was divided into
three steps: EST quality control, clustering and annotations.
2-1 EST quality control
The sequences were given a unique ID consisting of a prefix including the species (Sf), 1 digit for the library
number, the tissue origin (H, M, F or SF9L), 5 digits for
clone number, 1 for sequencing direction and 1 for walking number. Sequences were then subjected to quality
checking. Base calling step was performed using the Phred
program [24,25]. Low quality bases (phred score < 10; this
quite permissive score was chosen due to the low quality
of some of the EST sequences) were masked and
sequences with more than 30 % n-content were removed.
The vector sequences were detected and removed. For this,
we used BLASTN [26] with the following parameters (-q 5 -G 3 -E 3 -F "m D" -e 700 -Y 1.75e12). Due to their short
length (less than 20 bp), the adaptor sequences were
detected with an exact and more sensitive local alignment
algorithm (Miller-Myers algorithm) and then eliminated.
The regions of the sequences that contained more than 15
N's on a 20 bases window in the first/last quarters of the
sequence were removed on both ends. The sequences with
nucleotide stretches, indicators of sequences of bad quality, were also removed. Lastly, the cleaned sequences
shorter than 100 bp were eliminated. After the cleaning
process, we obtained a total of 23,503 sequences, representing 63% of the initial 37,056 EST sequences. With the
5822 EST already available from the Sf9L library, SPODOBASE contains a total of 29,325 ESTs, which are in majority 500–600 bp long. The distribution of EST sequences
according to tissue origin is given in Table 1. Sequencing
was conducted in both directions for all ESTs coming
from tissues (Sf9 clones had only be 5' sequenced), but
both sequences were not always retained after quality control, especially at the 3' end. The number of clones with
available 5' only, 3' only or both sequences is given on
Table 1, where one can see that 20163 clones have produced a readable sequence.
2-2 EST clustering
All the 29,325 cleaned EST sequences were then subjected
to clustering using the TIGR software TGI Clustering tool
(TGICL) [27]. The clustering was performed by a modified
version of NCBI's megablast. EST sequences were assigned

to clusters based on identity: the clustering parameters
were 98% minimum percent identity for overlaps, for a
minimum overlap length of 40 nt and a maximum length
of unmatched overhangs of 20 nt. The cluster names corresponded to the name of the first EST sequence assigned
to the cluster. Thus, each cluster name will be maintained
as additional ESTs are added to the database. After analysis, the 29,325 cleaned EST sequences were distributed
among 2294 clusters and 6103 singletons. Most of the
clusters (2141; 93%) contained 2 to 25 ESTs (Figure 2). In

this step, 5' and 3' sequences are treated as independent
data, so that sequences coming from the same clone may
belong to two different clusters. This allows to control if a
clone is not colinear to the genome (due to cloning artifact), or if the encoded gene contains similarities with two
different genes. We then examined the clone origin of
clusters and singletons and were able to deduce from
these data a set of 5186 unigenes. As Spodoptera has a
genome coding capacity (genome size 407 Mb, see ref. 22
comparable or slightly smaller than that of Bombyx mori

As genome data (including ESTs) of Bombyx mori are the
most important among Lepidoptera, it represents a model
organism within this order. We thus subjected the EST
sequences to TBLASTX searches against 116,541 B. mori
sequences deposited in the NCBI dbEST database with a
cut-off E-value of 1e-10. A total of 21,185 (72%)
sequences were found to share significant similarities with
silkworm EST sequences.

Distribution of the number of ESTs per cluster for the 2294
clusters. The number of EST is given for each class of abundance (2–5, 6–10, 11–15, etc).

Thus, 24 % (8141) of the S. frugiperda ESTs do not have a
match in BLAST searches against neither NCBI nr nor
Bombyx mori databases. To identify those that did not
match because they may correspond to untranslated
regions, a search for predicted coding regions was performed with the software ESTScan [28]. Indeed, from
these 8141 sequences, we identified 3624 sequences (44.5
%) lacking predicted coding regions. Consequently, only
15 % of all sequences should be considered as new
sequences. At this stage it should also be emphasized that
B. mori ESTs database do not represent the total number
of putative silkworm genes, thus the TBLASTX should be
conducted against whole B. mori genome when it will be
annotated. This observation may also be correlated with
the phylogenetic distance which separates the two species.
Indeed, although the monophyletic origin of Lepidoptera
is well admitted [29], Bombycoidea and Noctuidea are
two well distinct super families among this order, separated by probably more than 60 million years [30-32].

(genome size 514 Mb for an estimated gene count of
around 18,500; see refs. [14,15]], one can assume that the
5186 Spodoptera unigene collection described here represents at least 35 % of potential total gene number.
2-3 EST assembling
Sequences from each cluster were assembled into consensus sequences called contigs using the CAP3 assembly
program available in TGICL. By doing that, we found 97
clusters (4 %) that were separated in more than one contigs (Table 2) leading to a final number of 2436 contigs
instead of the 2294 clusters described above. This discrepancy can be explained by small differences in the EST
sequences probably due to transcript diversity (mutations,
deletions). Note that sequences from a cluster containing
only one sequence are called singletons.

We also compared the 2436 contigs and the 6103 singletons to the Uniprot [33] protein database (release 6.0,
September 2005) using the BLASTX program with a 1e-10
cut-off. We found 1178 contigs (48%) and 1809 singletons (30%) that showed a significant similarity with a
Uniprot entry.

2-4 EST annotation
To identify similarities with known proteins, the
sequences were searched using the BLASTX algorithm
against a local non-redundant protein database (NR,

2-5- GO assignment of the EST sequences in the SPODOBASE
To define the function of the contigs and singletons
present in the SPODOBASE, we used the Gene Ontology
(GO) controlled vocabulary [34], and more particularly
GOSlim, a subset of GO terms, which provides a higher
level of annotations and allows a more global view of the
dataset. To this end, we searched for the GOSlim terms
(provided by GOA [35] released on January 2006) associated with the 1178 contigs and 1809 singletons that
showed a significant similarity with a Uniprot entry. These
identifiers were further used to select the sequences to be
printed on a Spodoptera DNA microarray (R. Feyereisen,
pers. comm.).
2-6- Software
The database is based on the AceDB database management system version [36], originally created for the worm
Caenorhabditis elegans, and used by many databases:
WormBase [37], crop-related databases available from the
UK Crop Plant Bioinformatics Network WWW site [38],
MagnaportheDB [39], ESTHER [40], ParaDB [41], TropGene [42], etc. This is an object-oriented system capable
of storing and retrieving complex biological information.
The Web server is an Apache Web server version running
on Red Hat Linux version. The Web consultation interface
is implemented with Perl/CGI scripts, using modules of
the AcePerl Application Programming Interface (API) and
the AceBrowser generic web interface [43]. The EST pipeline was created with Perl programming language and
Bioperl libraries and used additional programs (PHRED
for sequence quality control, BLAST for contaminant
detection and annotation step, TGICL for clustering and
assembling).

Utility and discussion
1- User interface
For each sequence, series of information are available
including the direction of sequencing, the existence of the
other direction sequence, the relation to an existing cluster, the 10 best hits of BLASTX against NCBI and Bombyx
EST database, and the library where the sequence was

2437

found. For each cluster, the software displays the distribution of sequences among the different tissue libraries, and
gives the list of sequences belonging to the cluster; it offers
the possibility to visualize their alignment and to download the FASTA file comprising all of them. The 10 best
hits of BLASTX against Uniprot and G0 annotations are
available for each contig and singleton. Users can query
database in several ways. Information can be retrieved
according to text search or using a query assistant.
1-1- Classical AceDB queries
User can query database with AceDB data queries (Class,
Text and AceDB queries). Class query allows the user to
retrieve objects by class, with the possibility of restricting
the search to names that match a pattern. Text query is a
keyword-based search on all the data. AceDB query uses
the Ace Query Language (AQL), which was created to formulate complex queries based on several criteria. In order
to create an AQL request, the user must know the structure
of the object model and learn a specific syntax. However
some examples of classical questions written in AQL can
be found at the AQLquery top page.
1-2- Query assistant
To help the user for retrieval, we implemented the QueryBuilder tool [43]. This is a step-by-step graphic interface to
formulate Ace queries. Five initial choices are proposed,
concerning the clusters, the singletons, the libraries, the
contigs or the sequences themselves. After this, the
retrieval can be directed within a specific field and the
chain of characters or numbers to be found are used in
combination with the classical Boolean operators.
1-3- BLAST search
Users can search for similarities between their own
sequences using BLASTN, TBLASTN or TBLASTX searches
against the whole set of S. frugiperda EST sequences.
2- Intended uses
The database provides an overview of S. frugiperda transcripts. One of the major interests of the SPODOBASE

consists in the large number of sequences and the existence of 5 different tissues cDNA libraries. The database
can be used, among other applications, for functional
genomics (primer design for micro-array analysis), to
identify the genes expressed predominantly in a given tissue, and to compare genes between different species. On
the basis of extensive sequence-based analysis of relationships among noctuids, it has been recently shown [44]
that Spodoptera is relatively close to a group of species
called the "pest clade" and including Heliothinae and
Noctuinae s. l. Actually SPODOBASE is constructed in
such a way that it can welcome large numbers of additional sequences from other different tissues of S. frugiperda, as well as from other Spodoptera species. The
implementation of S. littoralis ESTs is already programmed for a near future.

Conclusion
The SPODOBASE represent a major contribution to the
genomics of Spodoptera frugiperda. Together with BAC
library, existence of various cell lines and expression systems, this makes of S. frugiperda of the most advanced
models among agricultural pests in terms of genomic
resources. SPODOBASE contains EST sequences that are
cleaned, clusterized and annotated. These informations
are available to serve insect research community, provide
better understanding of the Lepidoptera physiology and
identify new molecules targeted against Lepidoptera pests
that could be used as safe biopesticides for sustainable
agriculture.
