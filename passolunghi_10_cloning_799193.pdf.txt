Cloning of the Zygosaccharomyces bailii GAS1
homologue and effect of cell wall engineering on
protein secretory phenotype

Abstract
Background: Zygosaccharomyces bailii is a diploid budding yeast still poorly characterized, but widely recognised
as tolerant to several stresses, most of which related to industrial processes of production. Because of that, it would
be very interesting to develop its ability as a cell factory. Gas1p is a b-1,3-glucanosyltransglycosylase which plays an
important role in cell wall construction and in determining its permeability. Cell wall defective mutants of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris, deleted in the GAS1 gene, were reported as super-secretive. The aim
of this study was the cloning and deletion of the GAS1 homologue of Z. bailii and the evaluation of its deletion on
recombinant protein secretion.
Results: The GAS1 homologue of Z. bailii was cloned by PCR, and when expressed in a S. cerevisiae GAS1 null
mutant was able to restore the parental phenotype. The respective Z. bailii Δgas1 deleted strain was obtained by
targeted deletion of both alleles of the ZbGAS1 gene with deletion cassettes having flanking regions of ~400 bp.
The morphological and physiological characterization of the Z. bailii null mutant resulted very similar to that of the
corresponding S. cerevisiae mutant. As for S. cerevisiae, in the Z. bailii Δgas1 the total amount of protein released in
the medium was significantly higher. Moreover, three different heterologous proteins were expressed and secreted
in said mutant. The amount of enzymatic activity found in the medium was almost doubled in the case of the
Candida rugosa lipase CRL1 and of the Yarrowia lipolytica protease XPR2, while for human IL-1b secretion
disruption had no relevant effect.
Conclusions: The data presented confirm that the engineering of the cell wall is an effective way to improve
protein secretion in yeast. They also confirmed that Z. bailii is an interesting candidate, despite the knowledge of
its genome and the tools for its manipulation still need to be improved. However, as already widely reported in
literature, our data confirmed that an “always working” solution to the problems related to recombinant protein
production can be hardly, if never, found; instead, manipulations have to be finely tuned for each specific product
and/or combination of host cell and product.

Background
The “non-conventional” yeast Zygosaccharomyces bailii
has been proposed as a possible new player in biotech
processes arena [1]. Its tolerance to high sugar concentrations, low pH environments caused by organic acids,
relatively high temperatures [2] could allow its growth
under restrictive conditions. These features can be very
useful for industrial fermentations because they can

simplify the process, improving the economical value. In
addition, the high specific growth rate of Z. bailii and
its high biomass yield render this yeast particularly
attractive for those applications were the biomass itself,
or a specific protein or metabolite, is the desired product. In respect to recombinant protein production, it
has been demonstrated that production and secretion
levels of the recombinant human interleuchin-1b (rhIL1b) and of fungal glucoamylases in Z. bailii are higher
than the levels obtained with S. cerevisiae by the use of
the same centromeric expression vector [3].

From an industrial point of view, production and
secretion capabilities of the host systems currently in
use are still insufficient. In particular, secretion of the
heterologous protein often represents one of the main
bottlenecks. Different strategies can be utilized in this
respect, and among them are: improvement of the heterologous gene expression levels, signal sequence optimization, co-expression of chaperones and foldases,
introduction of mutations which improve secretion capabilities and reduction of the proteolytic activity in
secretion vesicles [4].
Since the yeast cell wall constitutes a physical barrier
to large molecules transit, it represents one of the main
limits for heterologous protein secretion. Thus, mutations which directly or indirectly alter the cell wall organization can lead to better secretion capabilities of a
yeast host [5].
Mutations in genes involved in the construction and
in the maintenance of the cell wall, such as PMR1,
SEC14, ERD1, MNN9 and MNN10, have in some cases
been demonstrated to lead to supersecretive mutants in
S. cerevisiae and other yeasts [5]. The results evidence a
tight correlation between glycosylation processes and
protein secretion [6]. It was hypothesized that this correlation is not directly linked to the heterologous
secreted proteins, but rather to an altered structure of
the glycosidic residues added to the cell wall (glycol)proteins [5], which in turn leads to an altered permeability
of the cell wall itself.
Among the already mentioned target, also the inactivation of the GAS1 gene, whose product is directly
involved in the synthesis of the cell wall, led to a hypersecretive phenotype in S. cerevisiae [7]. The ScGas1p is
an extracellular glycoprotein, anchored to the cell membrane through a GPI tail, which has a b-1,3-glucanosyltransferase activity. This enzyme plays a central role in
the formation of cell wall glucans: it catalyzes the crosslinking of the glucans resulting in the b-1,3-glucan elongation [8]. The identification of Gas1p homologues in
other yeast species and some pathogenic fungi led to
the definition of a new glycosyl-hydrolases family.
Recently, the hypothetical 3D structure of the catalytic
domain of the protein was built by homology modelling
[9]. The GAS1 gene disruption leads to peculiar morphological and physiological phenotypes due to an
altered cell wall structure and composition. In particular, it was reported an altered distribution of the percentages of b-1,3- and b-1,6-glucans, the latter being higher
than in wild type strain [10]. It was also reported an
increase in the chitin and mannoproteins levels, together
with altered linkages between the different components
[11]. As a direct or indirect result of these cell wall
structure modifications, the gas1 mutant shows higher
secretion levels if compared to the wild type, both for

total and for the heterologous recombinant proteins, as
the human insuline-like growth factor (rhIGF1), [7].
More recently, the Pichia pastoris GAS1 homologous
gene was cloned and then deleted, also resulting in a
yeast mutant showing a supersecretive phenotype for
some heterologous proteins, like a yeast lipase, but not
for other, like the human trypsinogen [12].
Here we demonstrate that the deletion of the Z. bailii
GAS1 homologue leads to an improved heterologous
protein secretion in this new promising host. For reaching this goal, the ZbGAS1 gene was firstly cloned and
then deleted thanks to the setting up of a protocol for
gene deletion in this non-conventional diploid yeast. We
describe here the morphological and physiological characterization of the ZbΔgas1, which, in analogy to the
ScΔgas1 and PpΔgas1 mutants, resulted to have a supersecretive phenotype.

Results
PCR cloning for Z. bailii GAS1 homologue

Because of the high phylogenetic correlation between Z.
bailii and S. cerevisiae [13] and because of the high percentage of identity among the few known Z. bailii and
the corresponding S. cerevisiae gene sequences, our first
attempt was to clone the gene homologous to GAS1 in
Z. bailii by PCR amplification, using primers designed
on the 3’ and 5’ ends of the ScGAS1 coding sequence,
but with no success.
It was therefore necessary to design internal primers
choosing the most conserved regions of the gene, based
on multiple sequence alignments. The Candida glabrata
and the Schyzosaccharomyces pombe homologous genes
(overall sequence identity to ScGAS1: 71% and 62%
respectively), in addition to the S. cerevisiae one, were chosen for comparison. Two amplification primers were
designed on ScGAS1 in (sub)regions sharing nearly 100%
sequence identity with the two homologues, at about 200
bp and 300 bp from the ATG and the STOP codon,
respectively. A 1137 bp fragment was amplified, using Z.
bailii genomic DNA as a template, sharing 72% sequence
identity with the corresponding internal region of ScGAS1.
Translation into the putative aminoacidic sequence led to
the identification of a region with 74% identity to the
ScGas1p protein fragment spanning from the catalytic
domain to the beginning of the Cys Box (WU-Blast2 alignment results, Figure 1). This confirms data reported in literature which indicate the catalytic domain and the Serine
and Cysteine Boxes as the most conserved regions of the
GAS1 homologues in different yeast species [8].
The 5’ and 3’ regions of the ZbGAS1 homologue were
subsequently amplified from a Genome Walker library
constructed from the Z. bailii genomic DNA using the
Universal GenomeWalker® Kit (Clontech). Gene-specific
primers used were ZbGAS1intREV and ZbGAS1intFW

for the 5’ and 3’ ends respectively (see Methods). The
complete ORF of ZbGAS1 was reconstructed in this
way, and additional 262 bp upstream to the ATG and
177 bp after the STOP codon were also sequenced
(GeneBank Accession N° GU136594).
Based on the new sequence, it was possible to design
specific primers for the ZbGAS1 gene (see Methods)
and a DNA fragment of the expected length was amplified from the Z. bailii genomic DNA.
The complete ZbGAS1 ORF resulted to be 1710 bp
long (+ 30 bp vs ScGAS1), sharing a 67% sequence identity with the S. cerevisiae homologue (additional file 1).
This sequence encodes for a putative aminoacidic
sequence of 569 aa (+10 aminoacids vs ScGas1p) having
68% identity with the ScGas1p protein (Figure 1).
Sequence alignments were also performed between the
newly isolated Z. bailii ORF and sequences of other
homologous GAS genes in S. cerevisiae (GAS1-5): the
lower identity scores obtained for sequences other than
ScGAS1 (not shown) further indicated that we cloned
the GAS1 homologue of Z. bailii.
Hence, considering the sequence similarities between
the ScGAS1 gene and their homologues in other yeasts,
the GAS1 gene resulted to be highly conserved also in
Z. bailii. The overall deduced protein structure seems to
be also conserved.
The ZbGAS1 gene is one of the few Z. bailii gene
sequences isolated to date, hence representing a further
little step towards the knowledge of this still poorly
characterized yeast.

ZbGAS1 gene disruption

Two different ZbGAS1 deletion cassettes were constructed based on the kanR and hphR markers. Differently from the case of the ZbYME2 gene deletion [14],
where flanking regions of about 60 to 80 bp were
described to be sufficient for obtaining homologous
recombination, long homologous flanking regions were
necessary to obtain gene replacement. In particular, we
constructed both the deletion cassettes, represented in
Figure 2a, with flanking regions of about 400 bp, which
resulted to be sufficient to disrupt the first and as well
the second allelic copy of ZbGAS1, despite with quite
low efficiency (about only 10% of the transformants
resulted to effectively have both the deleted alleles, confirming what previously described [14]). The two cassettes (see Methods) were therefore used to transform
Z. bailii cells, resulting in the gas1 null mutant. The
insertion of both deletion cassettes in the homologous
loci was confirmed by PCR (Figure 2b). We applied the
same strategy for the deletion of the first essential Z.
bailii gene, leading to the first auxotrophic mutant of
this yeast, and in this case we had to further extend the
length of the homologous region for specific recombination, and despite that the percentage of positive events
was even lower (manuscript in preparation). These
results could lead to hypothesize that for targeted gene
deletion in Z. bailii the length of the flanking regions
could be crucial according to the specific role that a
specific protein plays, thus explaining results obtained
by other researchers [14].

the deletion of both the allelic copies of ZbGAS1. Two independent mutant clones (A and B) were tested. In both clones it is possible to see the
presence of bands corresponding to the two deletion cassettes and the absence of the band corresponding to the wild type gene copy.

Morphological and physiological characterization of the
null mutant

The GAS1 gene inactivation leads to different peculiar
phenotypes in S. cerevisiae that were widely characterized [10]. We therefore performed a morphological and
physiological characterization of the obtained Z. bailii
Δgas1 mutant in analogy to what reported in literature
for the model yeast. First, some morphological traits of
the Sc Δgas1 mutant are visible both by light and by
fluorescence microscopy after Calcofluor White staining.
It was reported for S. cerevisiae (both haploid and
diploid) mutants a rounded shape and higher cell diameter if compared to wild type cells, especially in the
stationary phase [10]. We performed the analysis of the
ZbΔgas1 and wild type strains in parallel to the S. cerevisiae BY4741 Δgas1 and wt strains. Microscopy images
are shown in Figure 3. It is possible to see the typical
rounded phenotype also for the ZbΔgas1 (panels C and
G). Moreover, like in S. cerevisiae, intracellular granules
and altered vacuoles are also visible (indicated by
arrows, panels C and G). The altered shape is also
reflected by cellular volumes, being higher in the
mutants, as assessed by coulter counter measurements
in cell populations growing in minimal or in rich medium; like for the model yeast, differences are more pronounced in stationary phase, were the mutant cell
volume is 1.6 fold larger in respect to the wild type
cells (data not shown). Another feature described for
the ScΔgas1 mutant is the appearance of large cellular
aggregates, still permanent after repeated sonication
cycles [10]. This feature is also conserved in the Z. bailii mutant, as it is visible from the microscopy images
of sonicated cells (Figure 3, panels C, D, G and H). The
morphological alterations described are likely a consequence of the altered structure and composition of the
mutant cell wall: it was reported for S. cerevisiae a

lowered glucans content together with a marked
increase in the chitin and mannoproteins content [15].
Moreover, an altered distribution of the cell wall components in the mother and daughter cell have been
reported [10]. Our analyses confirmed these alterations
also for the Z. bailii mutant: overall Calcofluor staining,
in fact, was more intense in Δgas1 than in wild type
strain (Figure 3, panels D and H), indicating a higher
chitin content in the mutant. The chitin seems to be
delocalized throughout the entire cell wall in the
mutant, while in the wild type it is more concentrated
at the budding ring and at the bud scars. Moreover, in
the mutant the cellular buds are also Calcofluor-stained,
in contrast to the wild type. It was proposed that the
increase in chitin levels and cross-links with b-1,6-glucosyl mannoproteins may be the effect of the activation
of a compensatory mechanism in mutants characterized
by defects in the cell wall architecture, like the Δgas1
mutants. The aim of this response would be to prevent
excessive loss of mannoproteins as a consequence of
the inability to cross-link the b-1,6-glucosyl mannoproteins and the b-1,3-glucans, a process in which Gas1p
plays a central role [15]. It was also hypothesized that
the loss of Gas1p may cause a weakening of the cell
wall of the emerging bud. The yeast cell could, in
response to this weakening, target the accumulation of
chitin at the bud surface in order to protect it from
lyses [16]. Alteration of the processes directly or indirectly linked to budding leads to the appearance of a
relative high fraction, in the cell population, of multibudded cells (the so-called “Mickey Mouse” phenotype)
(figure 3). A similar phenotype was also visible in
ZbΔgas1 mutants (Figure 3).
The altered cell wall structure renders the deleted
bakers’ yeast strain more sensitive to sodium dodecyl
sulphate (SDS) and to Calcofluor White (CFW), as

reported in literature for the W303 background [17].
Here we confirm by spot assays the sensitivity to both
agents of the ScΔgas1 mutant, background BY4741 (Figure 3, upper right panels), and as well of the ZbΔgas1
mutant (Figure 3, lower right panels).
Finally, to verify the functionality of the GAS1 homologue of Z. bailii in S. cerevisiae and the similarity of its
biological role, the ZbGAS1 gene was expressed into the
GAS1-deficient S. cerevisiae strain, resulting in wild type
phenotype restoration either in respect to the morphological traits as well as for the chitin distribution (data not

shown). Moreover, to verify the functionality of the S.
cerevisiae GAS1 in Z. bailii, the ScGAS1 gene was
expressed into the GAS1-deficient Z. bailii strain, also
in this case restoring the native phenotype (data not
shown).
Overall morphological and physiological data strongly
indicate that the ZbGAS1 gene may have a similar role,
with respect to the ScGAS1 homologous, in the assessment of the cell wall structure and, hence, their inactivation might have similar effects in the two yeasts in
respect to secretion abilities.

Supersecretive phenotype of Δgas1 strains

As already mentioned (see Introduction), the most
interesting phenotype of Δgas1 mutants reported in literature is the supersecretive property. Besides the
increased secretion of heterologous proteins, which
appears to be dependent on the individual protein [12],
the levels of total secreted proteins in late-stationary
phase cultures of S. cerevisiae mutants were two fold
higher with respect to the wild-type [7]. We therefore
started our evaluation of secretive properties of the Z.
bailii mutant, in the perspective of a possible application in industrial processes, by determining the amount
of total proteins released in the growth medium during
batch cultivation with respect to the wild type strain. Z.
bailii and S. cerevisiae wild type and Δgas1 respective
strains were grown in shake flasks in minimal YNBbased medium containing 5% glucose. Cells were harvested at different times of cultivation and the fermentation broths were assayed. At least triplicate
experiments were performed on three independent
transformants, and Figure 4 shows the mean data
obtained reported as mg of total proteins secreted per
litre of the culture broth, normalised for OD values.
The values refers to 72 h of cultivation, but it was possible to observe a trend leading to this result starting at
the end of exponential phase and becoming more pronounced in stationary phase of growth.

Page 6 of 11

The data clearly underline the overall higher secretive
capacity of Z. bailii if compared to S. cerevisiae, in
accordance to heterologous proteins secretion data
already reported [3]. Moreover, they indicate a significant improvement in the secretive capability of the Z.
bailii mutant, being nearly 80% more than the wild type
in terms of total endogenous protein, similarly to the S.
cerevisiae mutant.
Overexpression of CRL lipase, XPR2 protease and hIL-1b
in Z. bailii Δgas1 strains

With the intention to evaluate the potential effects of
cell wall engineering and to test the secretive performance in the presence of an heterologous protein, three
model proteins were tested: a fungal lipase from Candida rugosa (CRL1), a fungal protease from Yarrowia
lipolytica (XPR2) and the human interleukin 1b (hIL1b).
Four clones of Z. bailii Δgas1 [pZLN022XPR2] and
four clones of the parental strain Z. bailii
[pZLN022XPR2], together with control clones harbouring the respective empty plasmid were pre-cultivated for
16 hours in shake flasks using YPD medium, and then
transferred in shake flasks in minimal YNB-based medium containing 5% glucose. The amount of secreted
recombinant XPR2 in culture supernatants was tested in
terms of enzymatic activity after 72, 96, 120 and 148 h
with the Azocoll method (see methods for detail). The

were inoculated at 0.1 OD and harvested after 72 hours of cultivation. Amount of released proteins (in mg l-1 of culture broth) were normalized
for OD values.

ZbΔgas1 transformants showed a relevant increase in
specific activity levels since 72 h (+ 25% at 72 h, more
than two-fold at 148 h, see Figure 5a), in respect to wild
type transformants.
Similarly, three clones of Z. bailii Δgas1
[pZLN022LIP1] and three clones of the parental strain
Z. bailii [pZLN022LIP1], together with control clones
harbouring the respective empty plasmid were pre-cultivated for 16 hours in shake flasks using YPD medium,
and then transferred in shake flasks in minimal YNBbased medium containing 5% glucose. The amount of
secreted recombinant LIP1 in culture supernatants was
tested in terms of enzymatic activity after 24, 48, 72 and
120 h using the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenylesters
method (see methods for detail). Also for this second
heterologous product the Δgas1 transformants showed a
relevant increase in specific activity levels since 24 h

Page 7 of 11

(+35% at 24 h, more than two-fold at 120 h, see Figure
5b), in respect to wild type transformants.
Finally, three clones of Z. bailii Δgas1 [pZ5KlIL-1b]
and three clones of the parental strain Z. bailii
[pZ5KlIL-1b], together with control clones harbouring
the respective empty plasmid were tested for secretion
level of the human interleukin, since the coding
sequence was functionally linked to the signal peptide of
the K1 killer toxin from K. lactis. The independent
transformants were pre-cultivated and then cultured in
shake flasks containing rich medium (YPD, 5% w/v glucose). Samples were collected at the indicated times (see
Figure 5c), cells were harvested and both the supernatants and the cell protein extracts of said samples were
loaded on a polyacrylamide gel. The data obtained by
Western blot (see Figure 5c) performed on the supernatant showed a well represented band corresponding to

the recombinant protein for both Z. bailii and Z. bailii
Δgas1 samples, but differently from the case of recombinant fungal enzymes, no relevant differences in favour
of the deleted yeast are appreciable. Remarkably, the signal corresponding to the protein retained intracellularly
is more intense in gas1 null mutant than the signal
obtained from Z. bailii parental strain, indicating an
incomplete secretion of this protein.

Discussions
Cell wall engineering can improve the release of heterologous proteins from yeasts [18]. Generally speaking, GAS1, which mediates the crosslinking of cell wall
components, is directly involved in defining the permeability of the cell. Cloning of the unknown Z. bailii
GAS1 homologue by PCR was only possible starting
from highly conserved internal regions, identified upon
alignment of the GAS1 homologues of three yeast species. The 5’ and 3’ ends were subsequently amplified
using a Genome Walker library. With this approach,
the full-length Z. bailii GAS1 homologue could be
amplified and sequenced. The cloned gene was
expressed in the GAS1-deficient S. cerevisiae strain and
reversion of the phenotype proved that this homologue
is not only structurally but also functionally similar to
the S. cerevisiae gene. Moreover, also the ScGAS1 gene
complemented the Z. bailii mutant. Disruption of
GAS1 in Z. bailii revealed its influence on the cell wall
morphology. The GAS1 null mutants of Z. bailii
showed the same phenotype reported for S. cerevisiae
[10], with enlarged cells often showing granular cytoplasm, an alterated chitin distribution, two buds
(Mickey Mouse-like appearance) and big vacuoles. The
vacuole is known to be a dynamic organelle whose
morphology is highly responsive to different extracellular and intracellular stimuli/stressors [19]. In the GAS1
null mutant, it can be therefore speculated that the
generation of big vacuoles is related to stressful conditions, as already suggested by the altered chitin distribution being a possible defence mechanism against
lysis or related to a generalized response to sickness of
the cells [10].
Finally, also the sensitivity to SDS and CFW
appeared very similar to what observed in the S. cerevisiae mutant. A comparison of the different GAS1 null
phenotype mutants and the functionality of the Z. bailii GAS1 homologue in S. cerevisiae suggest a similarity
of the cell wall structure of Z. bailii compared with the
cell wall structure of S. cerevisiae. Considering the
secretory pathway of a secreted protein, it was speculated whether the protein becomes retarded in the cell
wall after release from the plasma membrane. The disruption of GAS1 in Z. bailii first of all confirmed a
general phenomenon of protein release in respect to

Page 8 of 11

the wild type strain, as demonstrated by the higher
accumulation of total protein in the growing medium
of the deleted strain when compared to the parental
strain. Moreover, such as compromised cell wall permeability in the production strains for XPR2 and LIP1
does lead to a clear improvement in the secretion of
the respective proteins. In the case of h IL-1b the
enhancement of product secretion was not so evident,
and difficult to interpret in respect to the higher accumulation of intracellular product. It could be speculated that this can be related to the nature or to the
source of the protein, but too few information are
available at the moment to further comment in this
direction. What seems to be true is unfortunately what
we very often experience for recombinant protein production, which is the protein and protein-host dependence. In fact, also in P. pastoris two out of three
heterologous proteins resulted more secreted in the
mutant, as for Z. bailii, and when we tested the same
protein, in particular the IL-1b secretion in the S. cerevisiae Δgas1 mutant (data not shown), we did not register any improvement.

Methods
Yeast strains, media and transformation

The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were the
auxotrophic haploid BY4741 (Mat a, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0,

for S. cerevisiae and 200 mg l-1 for Z. bailii) or hygromicine (100 mg l -1 for Z. bailii) were added to the
media. Alternatively, yeast cultures were grown in
minimal synthetic medium (0.67% w v -1 YNB Biolife
without amino acids) with 2% or 5% w v -1 glucose as
carbon source. When required, supplements such as
histidine, leucine, methionine and uracil were added to
a final concentration of 50 mg l -1 . Media for plates
were solidified by addition of agar (Biolife, Milan, Italy)
to 1.5% w v -1 . Shake flask experiments were carried
out with 50 ml of medium in 250 ml shake flasks on a
shaker at 30°C with 160 rpm. For sensitivity tests in
Petri dishes 12.5 μg ml -1 of CFW or 50 μg ml -1 SDS
were added to solid media. Yeast transformation was
performed using the Lithium Acetate/ssDNA method
as described [20] and slightly adapted for Z. bailii, as
described [3].

Genes amplifications, deletion cassettes and expression
plasmid construction

PCR amplifications were made from yeasts genomic
DNA, prepared as described in [21]. Amplifications were
performed by the Pwo DNA Polymerase (Roche).
The amplification of the ZbGAS1 gene was as follows:
the primers GAS1int_fw: 5’-AGT TGT TCC AGA GAT
ATT CCA TAC CTC AA-3’ and GAS1int_rev: 5’-GCA
GAA CCG CTG AAG CTA CAG T-3’ designed on
internal conserved region of the available sequences
from other yeasts were firstly used to amplify an internal
region of 1137 bp of the Z. bailii gene with the following program: 94°C 5 min; (94°C 15 s, 57°C 30 s, 72°C 1
min) × 25; 72°C 7 min; 4°C ∞. After that, the designed
primers ZbGAS1int_fw: 5’-GGA CGA TAA GGT TGA
CGA AGA-3’ and ZbGAS1int_rev 5’-TGC TGT GGT
CCA AAG TTG TG-3’ were used for the amplification
(program: 7 cycles: 94°C 2 min, 72°C 3 min; 32 cycles:
94°C 2 min, 67°C 3 min; 67°C 4 min; 4°C ∞) of the
terminal ends of ZbGAS1 utilizing a Z. bailii Genome
Walker library constructed using the Universal Genome
Walker kit (Clontech) following the manufacturers
instructions. From the obtained and reconstructed
sequence the final primers were established and used for
the ZbGAS1 1710 bp full length coding sequence amplification: ZbGAS1_fw: 5’-ACT AAT GTT ATT CCA
GGC GTT TTC G-3’ and ZbGAS1real_rev: 5’-AAA
TCA AGC CAA AGC AAA TCC AGC A-3’ (program:
94°C 5 min; (94°C 20 s, 58°C 30 s, 72°C 2 min) × 30; 72°
C 10 min; 4°C ∞). The DNA sequence of ScGAS1 was
PCR amplified with the following primers: ScGAS1fw:
5’-ACA ATG TTG TTT AAA TCC CTT TCA AAG
TTA GCA A-3’ and ScGAS1rev: 5’-TTT TTA AAC
CAA AGC AAA ACC GAC ACC AG-3’ (program: 94°C
5 min; (94°C 20 s, 60.5°C 30 s, 72°C 2 min) × 30; 72°C
10 min; 4°C ∞), and the DNA sequence of YlXPR2 was
PCR amplified with the following primers: XPR2_fwd:
5’-ACA ATG AAG CTC GCT ACC GCC TTT A-3’
and XPR2_rev: 5’-TGC CTA AAT GCC AAC ACC
GTT GTA G-3’ (program: 94°C 4 min; (94°C 15 s, 62.5°
C 30 s, 72°C 2 min) × 30; 72°C 7 min; 4°C ∞). All the
unique fragments obtained were sub-cloned in the vector pSTblue-1 utilising the Perfectly Blunt® Cloning Kit
(Novagene) and sequenced. The resulting respective
plasmids utilised in this work were named as follows:
pSTbZbGAS1int, pSTbZbGAS1, pSTbScGAS1 and
pSTbYlXPR2.
For the construction of the ZbGAS1 deletion cassettes,
the Kan R or the hph R cassette, derived from plasmid
pFA6-KanMX4 [22] and pAG26 [23] and conferring
resistance to G418 and hygromycin respectively, were
bluntended excised and inserted in the pSTbZbGAS1int
opened BstEII BglII, bluntended and dephosphorylated,
resulting in the plasmids pSTbZbGAS1ΔK and

pSTbZbGAS1ΔH. The resistance cassettes resulted in
both cases counter-clockwise inserted. The Z. bailii wild
type cells were transformed with the respective deletion
cassettes obtained by cutting the two described plasmids
in the AccI and SnaBI sites. The effective deletion was
PCR checked by using the following couples of primers:
ZbG1int2_fw 5’- TGC AGA AGT TAC AGA CCA
ATG TTG T -3’ and and ZbG1int2_rev 5’-AAG ATA
GAG AAG TGC TCT TGG CA -3’ (see Figure 2) or
ZbG1int2_fw and Hph_fw 5’- ATA TGA AAA AGC
CTG AAC TCA CCG AC -3’ or Kan_fw 5’- ATG GGT
AAG GAA AAG ACT CAC GTT -3’ (not shown) in
order to verify the presence of the cassettes in the
desired locus.
For complementing the yeasts GAS1 deletion, pZ 5
(-Nco)ScGAS1 and pYX022ZbGAS1 were constructed.
pZ5(-Nco)ScGAS1 was obtained from pZ5(-Nco) opened
SacI/EcoRV with the insertion of ScGAS1, from
pSTbScGAS1 cut with SacI/SnaBI. The pZ 5 (-Nco)
derives from pZ3 [3] where at the KpnI site the KanR
cassette was substituted from the NAT R cassette
obtained from vector pAG25 [23] by cutting PvuII/SacI/
blunt (obtaining the pZ5 plasmid): finally this plasmid
was EcoRI/BamHI cut and bluntended and reclosed.
pYX022ZbGAS1 was obtained with the insertion of
ZbGAS1 from pSTbZbGAS1 into pYX022 (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) both EcoRI cut.
For heterologous protein expression the plasmids
pZLN022XPR2, pZLN022LIP1 and pZ 5 KlhIL-1b were
constructed. The first two integrative plasmids derives
from pZLN022 (manuscript in preparation), obtained
from pYX022 opened DraIII blunt/SpeI blunt (to
exclude HIS3) with the insertion of ZbLEU2 cut from
pSTbZbLEU2 with EcoRI blunt; in KpnI blunt site the
NAT R cassette was inserted, obtained from vector
pAG25 [23] by cutting PvuII/SacI/blunt. The
pSTbZbLEU2 was obtained by sub-cloning ZbLEU2
amplified by PCR from Z. bailii genomic DNA (manuscript in preparation) in pSTBlue (Novagen) cut by
EcoRV. For pZLN022XPR2 construction, the pZLN022
was AatII/NheI cut, and the XPR2 from pSTbXPR2 was
inserted. For pZLN022LIP1 construction, the pZLN022
was AatII blunt/NheI blunt opened and the LIP1 was
inserted by BamHI blunt/NsiI blunt excision from the
pGAPsLIP [24]. For rh interleukin the pZ5KlhIL-1b was
built: it was obtained from pZ 5 opened with EcoRIblunt, with the insertion of hIL-1b in frame with Kl signal sequence from vector pKSSPI/3 [25] cut EcoRI
blunt/XbaI blunt.
DNA manipulations, transformation and cultivation of
Escherichia coli (DH5aF’ (80dlacZΔM15, Δ (lacZYAargF), U169, deo, rec1, end1, sup44, l, THI-1, gyrA96,
relA1) and Novablue Competent Cells (Novagene) were
performed following standard protocols [26]. All the

restriction and modification enzymes used were from
New England Biolabs (Hitchin, Herts, UK) or from
Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany).
Calcofluor staining and fluorescence microscopy

Cells were harvested, washed in PBS and resuspended in
1 mg ml-1 Calcofluor White solution, incubated 10-30
min at room temperature, washed again twice in PBS.
Fluorescence microscope images were taken by a Nikon
Eclipse 90i microscope using the Metamorph software
version 2.2 (Nikon), using emission filter UV-1A.
Quantification of total released proteins

Cultures were harvested and centrifuged at maximal
speed, then total proteins in the supernatants were ethanol-precipitated. The amount of proteins was determined by the dye-binding method of Bradford (Quick
Start Bradford Dye Reagent - BIORAD), using BSA as
standard. All the data were normalized by OD, after verification of the linear correlation between OD and dry
weight as a measure of biomass.
Quantification of secreted protease

Cultures were harvested and centrifuged at maximal
speed, then total proteins in the supernatants were separated and stored at -20°C until analysis. The amount of
protease secreted in the medium was determined by the
Azocoll assay (Azocoll - Calbiochem), using commercial
protease as positive control. Azocoll assays were performed according to [27] with some modifications.
Reaction mixtures contained 15 mg ml -1 Azocoll, 50
mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM
CaCl 2 . Proteolytic activities were measured by absorbance changes at 490 nm (Shimadzu UV 1601) after
incubation for 18 h at 30°C.
Quantification of secreted lipase

Cultures were harvested and centrifuged at maximal
speed, then the supernatants were separated and stored
at -20°C until analysis. The amount of lipase secreted in
the medium was determined according to [28] with
some modifications. Reaction mixtures contained: (A)
60 mg of p-nitrophenyl palmitate (Sigma Aldrich) in 20
ml of isopropanol (Sigma Aldrich), (B) 1 g Triton X-100
(Sigma Aldrich) and 0.2 g of Arabic gum (Sigma
Aldrich) in 200 ml Tris/HCl 0.1 M (pH 7.5). To obtain
the mixture (C) add slowly 1 part of A solution to 9
part of B solution under continuous agitation. Add 9
part of (C) solution to one part of the enzyme containing solution (i.e. the supernatant). Lipase activities were
measured by absorbance changes at 410 nm (Shimadzu
UV 1601) and the amount of enzyme is proportional to
OD according to the relation U/m = 0.667 × OD410 nm
(if OD410 nm < 0.5).

samples were collected. Cells were harvested (a culture
volume corresponding to 10 8 cells) by centrifugation.
One volume of 2×Laemmli buffer [29] was added to the
supernatants of said samples, they were boiled for 3-5
min and stored at -20°C until loading, or loaded directly
on a polyacrylamide gel. For the analysis of intracellular
production, crude extracts were prepared from 108 cells
by following the trichloroacetic acid protocol [30] and
resuspending the final protein extract in 150 μl of
Laemmli buffer. Samples were then loaded on standard
polyacrylamide gels (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, final concentration of the
separating gel: 15%); after separation, proteins were
blotted to nitrocellulose membranes and immunodecorated. An anti-IL-1b rabbit polyclonal antibody (IL-1b
(H-153), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA; cat. no. sc7884; dilution 1:200) was used for the interleukin immunodecoration. An anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK cat
no. NA934; dilution 1:10.000) secondary antibody was
used. For the interleukin detection, as a positive control,
the human recombinant IL-1b from E. coli (Roche cat.
no. 1 457 756) was always loaded in parallel on the
polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were visualised using
the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences, UK), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
