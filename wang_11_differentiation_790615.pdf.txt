Abstract
In order to effectively identify the vaccine and field strains of Canine distemper virus (CDV), a new differential
diagnostic test has been developed based on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). We selected an 829 bp fragment of the nucleoprotein (N) gene
of CDV. By RFLP analysis using BamHI, field isolates were distinguishable from the vaccine strains. Two fragments
were obtained from the vaccine strains by RT-PCR-RFLP analysis while three were observed in the field strains. An
829 nucleotide region of the CDV N gene was analyzed in 19 CDV field strains isolated from minks, raccoon dogs
and foxes in China between 2005 and 2007. The results suggest this method is precise, accurate and efficient. It
was also determined that three different genotypes exist in CDV field strains in fur animal herds of the north of
China, most of which belong to Asian type. Mutated field strains, JSY06-R1, JSY06-R2 and JDH07-F1 also exist in
Northern China, but are most closely related to the standard virulent strain A75/17, designated in Arctic and
America-2 genetype in the present study, respectively.
Background
Canine distemper virus (CDV) is an enveloped negativestrand RNA virus classified into the genus Morbillivirus
within the family Paramyxoviridae. CDV has a very
broad host range, having been isolated from dogs, red
pandas, foxes, raccoon dogs and tigers, and also identified in giant pandas, lions, lynxes, golden cats, bears and
wolves [1-4]. Since 1972, the number of clinical cases of
distemper in dogs and fur animals increased rapidly,
when large mink and fox farms were established in
China. CDV infection results in systemic disease with
involvement of the central nervous system and the
respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts [5]. The economic
loss is significant due to CDV infection.

Although vaccination against CDV with attenuated
virus can protect the majority of animals, this protection
does not necessarily extend to the field strains. The accurate diagnosis of CDV infection can be made with the
use of methods based on molecular biological techniques.
In recent years, the application of nucleic acid hybridization, PCR and other techniques [6-9] has improved the
accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of CDV diagnosis.
The detection of CDV based on N gene has been established by many researchers [10-14]. Recently, real-time
RT-PCR targeting the hypervariable C-terminal domain
of the nucleocapsid (N) gene was established and shown
to be more sensitive and effective [15]. The use of RTPCR-RFLP to detect the hemagglutinin (H) gene of CDV
was reported by Calderon [16]. However, the CDV N
gene is more conserved than H gene, and therefore, provides a better target for CDV detection.
Identification of vaccine and field strains of CDV is
very important for control the disease. The contagious

nature and the high mortality rates of canine distemper
make it necessary to speed up the diagnostic procedure
in order to quarantine infected animals and start appropriate treatments early. CDV is a highly effective prophylactic. Accurate vaccination and good surveillance
programs are of great importance, and reliable detection
methods are needed. So the tool of differentiation of vaccine and field strains is the first step to do. In this study,
an RT-PCR-RFLP method based on CDV N gene was
established, which could effectively differentiate the vaccine and field strains of CDV. This method not only met
the need for veterinary technology in the fur industry,
but also supplied a theoretical foundation for field strain
genotyping and furthered the basic research of CDV.

product length of 829 bp. The primer set was synthesized by Shanghai Yingjun biotechnological Co. Ltd
(Invitrogen, Beijing, China).
Preparation of the viral RNA

The tissues and blood of infected animals were collected
using sterile technique. The tissues were ground after
adding 1:1 PBS (weight: volume). The total RNA was
extracted using the RNAeasy kit (QIAGEN) according
to the manufacture’s instructions. Total RNA of virus
culture was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and
eluted using DEPC (diethyl pyrocarbonate)-treated
water. The RNA was either directly used in RT-PCR or
preserved at -70°C for later use.

Methods

RT-PCR

Viral strains, cells and samples

The PCR amplication cycle was optimized as follows:
94°C 45 s, 52.2°C 45 s and 72°C 45 s, for 35 cycles with
a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. Five microliters
of the amplified products were visualized using gel electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide. Bands were visualized by ultraviolet light
transillumination and compared with a 100 bp Ladder
(TakaRa).

The vaccine strain, CDV3, which has been most widely
used in the prevention of canine distemper in domestic
fur animals, was identified and preserved by the Zoonosis Lab, Institute of Special Field Economic Animal and
Plant Science, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences. The commercial vaccine products included
vaccine 1: INTERVET DHPPI (Holland), vaccine 2: VIRBAC hexade vaccine (France), vaccine 3: Norden Chimeric quadruple vaccine (USA) and vaccine 4:
Laboratories HIPRA septuple vaccine (Spain). All the N
gene segments of CDV in these combinative vaccines of
the present study were respectively labeled as vaccine 1,
vaccine 2, vaccine 3, vaccine 4. African green monkey
kidney cells were purchased from China Institute of
Veterinary Drug Control. The blood or tissue samples
from infected animals were collected from breeding
fields in different provinces of northeast China.
Primers

GenBank sequence analysis revealed a BamHI site at position 1086 in the genome of CDV field strains [GenBank:
AY443350, GenBank: AY649446, GenBank: AY445077,
GenBank: AY542312, GenBank: AY466011, GenBank:
AY386315, GenBank: AY386316] and the standard virus
strain (A75/17) but not in the vaccine strain (Onderstpoort). After analysis of the N gene in other field isolates
[GenBank: AY390348, GenBank: AJ009656, GenBank:
DQ887066, GenBank: DQ003302, GenBank: EF445056,
GenBank: DQ435615, GenBank: EF445050, GenBank:
DQ522030] and the vaccine strain [GenBank: EF418783],
a difference in the BamHI site was observed. Therefore,
this could serve as a valuable tool in the differentiation of
field strains from vaccine strains.
A conserved segment (372-1200 bp) of CDV N gene
(Onderstepoort) was selected and primers designed (P1:
5’TTCTG AGGCA GATGA GTTCT TC 3’, P2:
5’CTTGG ATGCT ATTTC TGACA CT 3’), with a

Recovery, purification and RFLP analysis on PCR products

The positive bands were purified by gel extraction
(TIANGEN) and subsequently used for the RFLP experiment. The RFLP reaction was performed as follows.
Two μl 10× buffer, 1μl BamHI (TaKaRa), 6μl PCR product and 11μl aseptic deionized water were combined
into 20 ul total reaction volume. The reaction was then
incubated in 37°C water bath for 1-1.5 h, after which
time, 2 μl of 10× Loading buffer was added. The results
of agarose gel electrophoresis were used to determine
the type of virus in the sample.
Sequencing and genetic analysis of N gene of isolated
CDV field virus strains

To confirm the occurrence of the target gene sequence
and BamHI site, all of the amplified segments were
cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) and
sequenced at Shanghai Yingjun Biotechnological Co. Ltd
(Invitrogen, Beijing, China). The sequencing result was
analyzed and 829 bp segments of 19 field strains were
compared to cognate sequences of a selection of 21 CDV
strains of various animal and geographical origins and 5
vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis was performed.

Results
Amplification and purification of the target gene
segments

The total RNA was extracted from suspected CDV samples and vaccine strain. The target segment was

Wang et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:85
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/85

amplified under optimized conditions. A specific 829 bp
fragment of N gene was obtained from 19 CDV field
strains and 5 CDV attenuated strains contained in the
commercial vaccines (data not shown). The positive products were purified by gel extraction and stored at -20°C
for later use.
RFLP analysis

RFLP analysis was carried out on the purified target segments and the results were used to identify the corresponding virus as vaccine or field strain. According to
the analysis, the 829 bp PCR product was cleaved into
two segments by BamHI: 675 bp and 153 bp in the
vaccine strains. The field strains were cleaved into three
segments: 455 bp, 220 bp and153 bp (Figure 1). Lanes
1-10 in Figure 1A and lanes 1-9 in Figure 1B show the
RFLP results of the amplified 829 bp segment in the 19
samples from clinically suspected canine distemper animals. These strains are from several provinces: Hebei,
Shandong, Liaoning and Jilin. They are isolated in minks,
raccoon dogs and foxes. Lanes 11, 12 in Figure 1A and
lanes 10-12 in Figure 1B show the RT-PCR-RFLP results
of vaccine strains, which are CDV3, Spanish, France, Holland and USA. From the figure, the 829 bp segments
amplified from suspected CDV animals could all be
digested by BamHI into three fragments, suggesting the
detected CDV strains in these tissues are field strains;
while the vaccine strains show the theoretical 2 fragment
pattern.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the isolated
field virus strains

The PCR product of the putative field strains were
sequenced and submitted to GenBank. The 610th base
of the 829 bp segment (correlating to the 981st base in
the total N gene) in field strains was different from that
in vaccine strains. It was the conversion of the 610 th
base from G to A leading to an additional BamHI site
in 829 bp segment of N gene in field CDV strains compared to CDV vaccine strains (Figure 2). Thus there are
2 BamHI digestion sites in the 829 bp segment of the N
gene in CDV field strains, whereas only one in vaccine
strains (sequence of the five CDV commercial vaccine).
Additionally, this single nucleotide differentiation is
observed between 3 CDV vaccine strains (Lederle, Snyder Hill, Onderstepoort) and 21 CDV isolates in the
GenBank sequences, indicating the BamHI site can distinguish these CDV vaccine strains and field strains.
Furthermore, the nucleotide sequences of the RT-PCR
products from 19 field isolated strains and CDV of in
the five commercial vaccine were analyzed. The 829 bp
nucleotide fragments of the N gene were sequenced and
then aligned with corresponding sequences of the CDV
strains obtained from the GenBank database. Figure 3

shows the distance-based Neighbor-Joining tree displaying the phylogenetic relationship among 49 CDV strains
based on one part of N gene. In the phylogenetic tree,
most of the Chinese field strain (16/19) grouped
together in one branch in the Asia-1 genotype. However, three strains (JSY06-R1 and JSY06-R2, isolated
from raccoon dog in Jilin Songyuan, and JDH07-F1
from Jilin Dehui silvery fox) obviously belong to distinct
branchs. The raccoon dog strains JSY06-R1 and JSY06R2 displayed the highest identity to HL, a fox strain
identified from Heilongjiang province and were designed
in Arctic genotype. The fox strain JDH07-F1 has the
highest homology with the standard virulent strain A75/
17, which is belong to America-2 genotype. The other
16 field strains are similar to published strains on the
China mainland, such as HD, TN, MS01 and PingTung
in the genotype of Asia-1.

Discussions
Due to a worldwide distribution and the broad hostrange of CDV including a vast wildlife reservoir, and
available in large amounts of unrelated species of animals in interspecific spreads, eliminate CDV is unlikely,
therefore, prevention of disease is very important.
Timely diagnosis, differential detection of strain type of
CDV, reasonable utilization of vaccine to prevent the
disease effectively, can obtain the effective control of
canine distemper. So the method of differentiation of
CDV vaccine and field strains is needed to construct.
Nucleocapsid protein (N) gene is most conserved structural proteins gene of CDV.
Sidhu et al have found the 981st base of N gene originating from some CDV vaccines has changed from G to
A in the field strains [17]. This leads an additional
BamHI site, which allows for the clinical discrimination.
During sequence alignment of the CDV genome, a difference between CDV field strains and vaccine strains
was observed and therefore a method developed to identify them.
In present study, we report on the development of
RT-PCR-RFLP suitable for the rapid and sensitive discrimination of CDV field strains and vaccine strains. The
assay is based on the conserved CDV N gene. An 829
bp segment between 372 bp and 1200 bp of the CDV N
gene was amplified and used in RFLP analysis. By the
result banding pattern, one could identify the strain as
vaccine or field. After digestion by BamHI, electrophoresis showed two fragments (659 and 153 bp) in the vaccine strain and three fragments (455, 220 and 153 bp) in
the field strains. Due to fur animal breeding at present
mainly concentrated in north and northeast of China,
we collected several CDV vaccine on the domestic and
international markets and animal organs suspected happening distemper in north and northeast of China. The

collected tissues were investigated including 19/83
RT-PCR positive (data not shown).
When Calderon characterized CDV from vaccinated
and non-vaccinated dogs, he found that the CDV H
gene RFLP analysis by NheI could identify vaccine and
field virus strains of CDV [16]. But CDV H gene had
more variable than N gene [18-20]. This novel method
(RT-PCR-RFLP) to identify vaccine and field virus
strains of CDV targets the conserved N gene and the
amplified segment (829 bp) is easy to manipulate. Confirmation of field virus infection (or vaccine virus artifact) animals in the clinic could be completed in
6 hours. Five CDV vaccines on the market, including

vaccines from China, Holland, France, USA, and Spain,
were analyzed, and only 2 fragments by the 829 bp fragment of CDV N gene RFLP analysis were observed,
coinciding with one BamHI digestion site. Furthermore,
the sequences were identical to the Onderstepoort strain
displayed in GenBank [16]. The 19 field isolates coming
from northeast and north of China from 2005 to 2007,
all displayed 3 fragments and contain 2 BamHI sites,
identical to the N gene sequence of CDV isolates in
GenBank. Then this new assay is suitable to accurately
distinguishing between the CDV vaccine and field
strains. The assay is also precise, and efficient and will
give an excellent technological support that will in turn

Northern China. Most of the field CDV strains coming
from northeast and north of China from 2005 to 2007
belong to Asia-1 type. Two strains from Jilin (JSY06-R1
and JSY06-R2) must be mentioned, as they are remarkably different from other isolates and presumably have
diversity due to gene mutation. In previous report, three
different CDV genotypes (Asia-1, Arctic, and Asia-3)
were currently circulating in breeding foxes, raccoon
dogs and minks in China based on H gene of CDV phylogenetic analysis [22]. Here, strains JSY06-R1 and JSY06R2, identified from Jilin province in 2006, displayed the
highest identity to HL strain, belong to Arctic genotype.
Arctic CDVs had been reported since 1980 s [23,24] and
then widespread in Europe [25,21,26]. In the late 1990 s,
Arctic CDVs arised in China [27]. At present, Arctic
CDVs, such as strain HL from Heilongjiang province
[22], strain Liu from Jilin province [27] and JSY06-R1
and JSY06-R2 from Jilin province in this study, are all
exist in northeast of China.
Asia-3 CDV in breeding foxes, raccoon dogs and minks
in China were firstly described in 2010 [22]. However,
the present study further revealed the existence of America-2 genotypes of CDV in breeding foxes in China. By
phylogenetic analysis, strain JDH07-F1 from fox had
been found to belong to the branch with classical virulent
virus A75/17, which belonged to CDV America-2 genotypes (Figure 3). Wild-type CDV strain A75/17 is a highly
virulent strain, which induces a persistent infection in the
central nervous system with demyelinating disease [28].
Strain JDH07-F1 was highly identical (99.2% nucleotide)
with Wild-type strain A75/17 in the N protein gene. So it
was speculated that the virulence of JDH07-F1 strain
must be strong. Further study will explore the biological
characteristics of these virulent virus strains.

Conclusions
An ingenious method had been applied to identify vaccine and field virus strains of CDV. RFLP analysis of the
829 bp fragment of CDV N gene can be digested into
two fragments(659 and 153 bp) in the vaccine strain
and three fragments (455, 220 and 153 bp) in the field
strains by BamHI. We analyzed N gene of 49 strains of
CDV (including 19 new field isolates coming from
northeast and north of China during 2005 and 2007).
The results showed the vast majority of the CDV strains
analyzed in this study were characterized as Asia-1 genotype. Strain JSY06-R1, JSY06-R2 and JDH07-F1 are
belong to Arctic and America-2 type, respectively. And
JDH07-F1, a first America-2 type CDV, is close to A75/
17, maybe with higher virulence.
