Abstract
Background: Fishes in the families Cichlidae and Labridae provide good probable examples of
vertebrate adaptive radiations. Their spectacular trophic radiations have been widely assumed to
be due to structural key innovation in pharyngeal jaw apparatus (PJA), but this idea has never been
tested based on a reliable phylogeny. For the first step of evaluating the hypothesis, we investigated
the phylogenetic positions of the components of the suborder Labroidei (including Pomacentridae
and Embiotocidae in addition to Cichlidae and Labridae) within the Percomorpha, the most
diversified (> 15,000 spp) crown clade of teleosts. We examined those based on 78 whole
mitochondrial genome sequences (including 12 newly determined sequences) through partitioned
Bayesian analyses with concatenated sequences (13,933 bp).
Results: The resultant phylogenies indicated that the Labridae and the remaining three labroid
families have diverged basally within the Percomorpha, and monophyly of the suborder was
confidently rejected by statistical tests using Bayes factors.
Conclusion: The resultant phylogenies indicated that the specified PJA evolved independently at
least twice, once in Labridae and once in the common ancestor of the remaining three labroid
families (including the Cichlidae). Because the independent evolution of pharyngeal jaws appears to
have been followed by trophic radiations, we consider that our result supports, from the aspect of
historical repeatability, the idea that the evolution of the specialized PJA provided these lineages
with the morphological potential for their spectacular trophic radiations. The present result will
provide a new framework for the study of functional morphology and genetic basis of their PJA.

Background
Fishes of the families Cichlidae and Labridae [1] (including scarids and odacids as subgroups) represent good
probable examples of vertebrate adaptive radiations [2,3].
Although the two families inhabit different aquatic environments (freshwater cichlids vs marine labrids), both
families have radiated into several hundreds to over a

thousand of species exhibiting various feeding modes
(Fig. 1). In terms of species richness, cichlids exceed
labrids (1478 spp. vs 576 spp.; calculated from the data
from FishBase [4], whereas labrid morphological diversity
is comparable to that of the cichlids in terms of feeding
modes, as represented by the wide variety of their skull
forms (Fig. 1) [5]. Indeed, biomechanical studies of lower

jaw shapes [6,7] quantitatively demonstrated that the
labrid functional diversity in lower jaw was well comparable to that of all ray-finned fishes.
The dramatic radiation of the cichlid and labrid fishes is
widely believed to result from the "key innovation" of a
unique pharyngeal jaw apparatus (PJA). Generalized percomorph fishes, from which the cichlids and labrids were
derived, have upper and lower "pharyngeal jaws" within
the throat, which function chiefly to transport food into
the esophagus, whereas the "oral jaws" have a task of both
collecting and manipulating (crushing and processing)
food. In the cichlid and labrid fishes, the pharyngeal jaws
and attached muscles (constituting PJA) was modified
into a derived condition with three major features: 1) the
left and right lower jaw elements are fused into a single
structure, 2) the lower jaw is suspended in a muscular
sling that runs from the neurocranium to the posterior
muscular arms of the lower jaw, and 3) the upper jaw elements have a diarthrotic articulation with the underside
of the neurocranium (Fig. 2) [8]. The unique condition of
the PJA is assumed to allow efficient manipulation (particularly strong bite) of food [8-10]. Liem [9] has suggested that the evolution of the uniquely modified PJA in
cichlids and labrids freed the oral jaws from the task of
food manipulation, allowing it to diversify into various
food-collecting modes (see Fig. 1).
Although this scenario is one of the most well-known
examples of an evolutionary key innovation (cited in
Futuyma's [11] "Evolutionary Biology", the most widelyused textbook in the field), it has never been evaluated
adequately. Unfortunately, the key innovation hypothesis
on the specialized PJA has been proposed being coupled
with a taxonomic hypothesis that has widely been
accepted ever since: the family Labridae and Cichlidae
have been classified into the suborder Labroidei, together
with Pomacentridae and Embiotocidae, based on the
sharing of the specialized PJA [10,12]. According to
Stiassny & Jensen [12], the specialized PJA has seven morphological features including the above three major ones.
None of them is, however, unique to labroid fishes,
although there is no other group known to have them all
[13]. Moreover, there is no independent, corroborative
evidence for a monophyletic Labroidei outside of the specialized PJA [12,13]. This situation has led some evolutionary biologists to doubt not only the taxonomic
hypothesis but also the key innovation hypothesis (e.g.
[14]). The doubt about the latter hypothesis is a little rash,
however, because appropriateness of the evolutionary
hypothesis essentially does not depend on that of the
appended taxonomic hypothesis.

esis independent of pharyngeal characters as below. The
widely-accepted taxonomic hypothesis (monophyletic
Labroidei) assumed that the evolution of the specialized
PJA occurred only once during the percomorph evolution,
a situation that has prevented the famous evolutionary
example from being examined from the aspect of historical repeatability. The traditional taxonomic hypothesis
based on the sharing of the specialized PJA, however,
needs reconsideration. Phylogeny independent of the PJA
may come to demonstrate multiple origins of the specialized PJA followed by trophic radiations, which support
the key innovation hypothesis at least from the aspect of
the historical repeatability. The hypothesis, however,
must be tested statistically by comparing the diversity of
the clades with the trait to that of the sister taxa without
that trait [15,16] when the true sister taxa are found in a
future study.
For the first step of evaluating the key innovation hypothesis on the specialized PJA, we examined labroid monophyly based on 78 whole mitochondrial genome
sequences from a variety of the Perciformes and related
other ordinal taxa (collectively called "Percomorpha").
Usefulness of whole mitochondrial genome sequences
(ca. 16,000 bp) for resolving higher-level phylogenetic
relationships of teleost has been demonstrated in several
studies [e.g. [17-19]]. Although non-monophyly of the
labroid families have been suggested in previous studies
[14,20,21], limited sequence data used in these studies
(2,222 bp at longest) have precluded them from drawing
definite conclusions, and no statistical test has been conducted for corroborating that hypothesis. Our analysis
used the whole mitochondrial genome sequences
(>13,000 bp per species), and confirmed the independent
origins of the two diversified families by statistical tests
using Bayes factors.

Results
The final DNA alignment contains 13,933 nucleotide sites
for the 78 taxa listed in Table 1. Of the sites, 9,037 were
variable and 7,832 informative under the parsimony criterion. Partitioned Bayesian analyses based on three differently-weighted datasets, #1, #2 (3rd codons RY-coded),
and #3 (3rd codons excluded), recovered nearly identical
topologies. Figure 3 shows a 50% majority rule consensus
tree of the 4,700 pooled trees from two independent Bayesian analyses for dataset #2. It was fully bifurcated with
the exception of an unresolved trichotomy denoted by an
arrow, and most internal branches were supported by
100% posterior probabilities (PPs). Topological differences among results from the three datasets were shown
only in the trichotomy and five internal branches denoted
by arrowheads in Fig. 3.

A discussion of the specialized PJA as a key innovation,
however, hinges, first of all, upon a phylogenetic hypoth-

In the resultant trees, every family of the suborder Labroidei (Cichlidae, Pomacentridae, Embiotocidae, and Labridae) was monophyletic with 100% PPs, and moreover,
the family Labridae (clade A) was phylogenetically distant
from the remaining three labroid families forming clade

B. Monophyly of the Labroidei comprised of all the four
families was confidently rejected by a statistical test using

Phylogenetic relationships among Labroid families, based on whole mitochondrial DNA sequences. Shown is the
50% majority rule consensus tree of the 4,700 pooled trees from two independent Bayesian analyses for dataset #2 (3rd
codons RY-coded). The dataset comprises unambiguously aligned nucleotide sequences of 13,393 bp from 76 percomorphs
and two outgroups; we set five partitions (1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions from 12 protein-coding genes plus tRNA and
rRNA genes). Partitioned Bayesian analyses were conducted using MRBAYES 3.1.2 [53], with the best-fit model of sequence
evolution [ref. 54; GTR + I + Î] being set each partition and all model parameters variable and unlinked across partitions.
Numerals beside internal branches indicate Bayesian posterior probabilities (PPs) (shown as percentages) for dataset #1/#2/#3.
Single numerals are given when analyses for all the datasets have shown the same values, and clades denoted by broad lines
indicate those supported by 100% PPs in the all datasets. An unresolved trichotomy is indicated by an arrow, and topological
incongruities among the datasets are denoted by open arrowheads (dataset #1 vs. #2) and filled arrowheads (dataset #1 vs.
#3). Note that the species of the Labridae and those of the remaining three labroid families (Cichlidae, Pomacentridae, and
Embiotocidae) form different monophyletic groups, respectively.

unweighted and weighted maximum-parsimony analyses
in Miya et al. [18], except for the newly added fishes, such
as labroids. Although the phylogenies recovered many
interesting inter-subordinal relationships that were not
congruent with the traditional classification, sparse taxon
sampling outside the Labroidei precludes further discussions.
Labroid phylogeny
The resultant trees and the statistical test with Bayes factor
demonstrated that the Labridae and the remaining three
labroid families including Cichlidae have independent
origins within the Percomorpha. Based on molecular
analyses, various relationships among the labroid families
have been so far proposed [14,20,21]. Our analysis demonstrated entirely different relationships from the various
ones with high statistical support, whereas none of the
previous relationships was supported with high statistical
value, probably owing to short sequences (2,222 bp at
longest). The present analyses were conducted based on
the long nucleotide sequences more than six times the
lengths of those so far used (13,933 bp).

In spite of the high statistical supports, we must keep in
mind that the sister relationships obtained here are highly
tentative because of the sparse taxon sampling (76 species
from 53 families) compared to the tremendous taxonomic diversity of the Percomorpha (ca. 14,000 species in
251 families; calculated from Nelson [23]). That is to say,
although the present phylogeny demonstrated that the
three labroid families, Cichlidae, Pomacentridae, and
Embiotocidae, formed a well-supported monophyletic
group (clade B) without non-labroid taxa, there remains a
possibility that some non-labroid taxa would break into
the group when more extensive taxon sampling is conducted. In the same way, there remains not a few possibilities that some yet-to-be-analyzed taxa (ca. 200 families
left) would become sister group of the "labroid" taxa. To
evaluate these possibilities, we need to conduct analyses
with more extensive taxon sampling. In doing so, we
would be able to evaluate "key innovation" hypothesis in
a more rigorous manner using statistical test [15,16].
Implications of the revised labroid phylogeny
The present result supports, from the aspect of historical
repeatability, the famous (but never evaluated) evolutionary hypothesis that the dramatic labroid radiations in
trophic ecology are due to evolution of specialized pharyngeal jaw apparatus (PJA). Based on the present phylogeny, a single origin of the specialized PJA in a common
ancestor of the suborder Labroidei is unlikely, because
such an evolutionary scenario requires subsequent losses
of the complex structures in a wide variety of percomorphs. Rather, it is plausible that the specialized PJA has
evolved twice independently in the Percomorpha history,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/10

in a common ancestor of the Labridae (clade A) and that
of the Cichlidae, Pomacentridae, and Embiotocidae
(clade B). Interestingly, evolutionary radiations in jaw
forms and head shape (see Fig. 1) have occurred within
both of the lineages with specialized PJA: one in the Labridae, and the other in the Cichlidae. The independent
occurrence of such evolutionary succession (evolution of
specialized PJA followed by trophic radiation) appears to
support the idea that the evolution of the specialized PJA
provided these lineages with the morphological "potential" for trophic radiations.
Despite their specialized PJA, the Pomacentridae and
Embiotocidae seem not to have experienced clear trophic
radiation. This may reflect the context-dependence of a
key trait's effect on diversification [24]. There are many
potential factors that could influence how a key trait
affects diversification. De Queiroz [24] categorized these
factors roughly into three types: (1) other taxa, (2) other
traits of the group itself, and (3) the physical environment. Evolutionary radiations in African Great Lake cichlids are supposedly facilitated by colonization of novel
habitats (newly created lakes) without other competitive
taxa [25]. The Pomacentridae and Embiotocidae, both of
which inhabit coastal marine waters, may not have had
such opportunity to colonize novel habitats without competitors.
Evolution of the specialized "labroid" PJA
It is interesting fact that the complex "labroid" PJA
evolved multiply in the Percomorpha history (other than
the two lineages recognized here, two fossil labroid families have been recognized so far from the lower Middle
Eocene [ca. 50 million years ago] of Monte Bolca, Italy,
together with the oldest fossil records of the Labridae and
Pomacentridae [26-29]). Is the acquisition of the "successful" PJA not so difficult for percomorph fishes, like parallel evolution of trophic morphologies in African Great
Lake cichlids [30]? According to Stiassny & Jensen [12],
typical labroid PJA has seven features (three of them
shown in Fig. 2). Interestingly, none of them is unique to
labroid fishes ([12]; e.g. fused lower pharyngeal jaw is also
shown in several families of Perciformes and members of
Beloniformes), though there is no other group known to
have them all [13]. In addition to it, it seems that such features can be accomplished by a very simple change in
ontogenetic mechanism (e.g. fusion of lower pharyngeal
jaws into one unit) [9]. The labroid PJA is therefore considered to have been achieved through the unique combination of several commonplace and slight morphological
modifications. It will be worthwhile to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the morphological modifications, which would reveal molecular basis for the
probable key innovations. According to Hulsey et al. [31],

Page 8 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:10

more than ten genes have been so far recognized which
putatively influence teleost pharyngeal jaw.
The present result will provide a new view point for functional morphology of the unique organ (the "labroid"
PJA). Although many works on the trophic apparatus have
been so far published [e.g. [8-10,12,32-35]], comparison
between labrid and other labroid fishes (including cichlids) as evolutionary independent lineages has never been
conducted. Careful comparisons, particularly based on
more extensive phylogenies including labroid and nonlabroid fishes possessing "partly" specialized PJA (e.g.
members of Beloniformes), will shed light on overlooked
evolutionary implications.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/10

DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing
We amplified whole mitogenome sequences for the 11
labroids plus a single non-labroid species (Labracinus
cyclophthalma: Pseudochromidae) using a long PCR technique [37]. We used six fish-versatile long PCR primers in
the following four combinations (S-LA-16S-L + S-LA-16SH; L2508-16S + H1065-12S; L2508-16S + H12293-Leu;
L12321-Leu + S-LA-16S-H; for locations and sequences of
these primers, see Miya & Nishida [17,38], Inoue et al.
[39,40], Ishiguro et al. [41], Kawaguchi et al. [42]) so as to
amplify the entire mitogenome in two reactions. Long
PCR reaction conditions followed Miya & Nishida [38].
Dilution of the long PCR products was with sterile water
(1:10â100) served for subsequent uses as short PCR templates.

Conclusion
The phylogenetic analyses of whole mitochondrial DNAs
from various labroid and non-labroid "percomorph"
fishes revealed that the Labridae and the remaining three
labroid families have diverged basally within Percomorpha, indicating that the specified "labroid" PJA evolved
independently at least twice, once in Labridae and once in
the common ancestor of the remaining three labroid families (including the Cichlidae). Because both of the evolution appear to be followed by trophic radiations, we
consider that our result supports the idea that the evolution of the specialized PJA provided these lineages with
the morphological potential for their spectacular trophic
radiations.
The present result will provide a new view point for functional morphology of the unique organ: although many
works on the specialized PJA have been so far published,
comparison between labrid and other labroid fishes
(including cichlids) as evolutionary independent lineages
has never been conducted. Careful comparisons, particularly based on more extensive phylogenies, will shed light
on overlooked evolutionary implications.

Methods
Taxon sampling
To examine monophyly of suborder Labroidei, we used
all four labroid families (Labridae, Cichlidae, Pomacentridae, and Embiotocidae) and a possible sister family for
Labridae (Pseudochromidae) in our analysis. In addition,
we used all available whole mitochondrial genome
(mitogenome) sequences from the Percomorpha (sensu
Miya et al. [18]) in the database (NCBI Organelle Genome
Resources) [36] in the analyses. We chose two basal acanthomorph (but not percomorph) taxa, Polymixia japonica
and Beryx splendens, as collective outgroups to root the
trees. A list of taxa examined in this study is provided in
Table 1 along with DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession.

We used a total of 162 fish-versatile PCR primers in various combinations to amplify contiguous, overlapping
segments of the entire mitogenome for each of the 12 species (for locations and sequences of the primers, see Miya
& Nishida [17,38], Inoue et al. [39,40,43-45]; Ishiguro et
al. [41], Kawaguchi et al. [42]). Short PCR reaction conditions followed Miya & Nishida [38].
Double-stranded short PCR products, purified using a
Pre-Sequencing kit (USB), subsequently served for direct
cycle sequencing with dye-labeled terminators (Applied
Biosystems and Amersham Pharmacia) with the same
primers for the short PCRs. All sequencing reactions were
performed according to the manufacture's instructions.
Labeled fragments were analyzed on model 373/377/
3100 sequencers (Applied Biosystems).
Sequences editing and alignment
The sequence electropherograms were edited with the
computer programs EDITVIEW (Version 1.01; Applied
Biosystems). AUTOASSEMBLER (Version 2.1; Applied
Biosystems) and DNASIS (Version 3.2; Hitachi Software
Engineering) were used to concatenate the consensus
mitogenomic sequences. Then, sequences were exported
to phylogenetic software programs. To build our character
matrix, we combined the 12 newly determined sequences
with the 66 previously published sequences.

For each individual protein-coding gene, we manually
aligned the sequences for the 78 species, with respect to
the translated amino acid sequence, using MACCLADE
[46]. All stop codons and gaps were excluded from the
subsequent phylogenetic analyses, as well as ambiguously
aligned regions. The ND6 gene was also excluded because
of its heterogeneous base composition and consistently
poor phylogenetic performance [17]. The 22 tRNA genes
were also aligned manually, and ambiguous and gap
alignment were excluded from the phylogenetic analyses.
The 12S and 16S rRNA sequences were aligned using the

Page 9 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:10

software PROALIGN (Version 0.5) [47], and default setting parameters. Regions with posterior probabilities of â¤
50% were excluded from the subsequent phylogenetic
analyses.
Phylogenetic analysis
When using a mitogenomic dataset for a particular taxonomic sampling, Simmons & Miya [48] empirically demonstrated that Bayesian analysis [49-52] is the most
efficient character-based method for accurately reconstructing phylogeny. Following their recommendations,
we used this method for constructing the labroid phylogeny.

Partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed with MRBAYES (Version 3.04 b) [53] for three different character matrices. The first matrix (dataset #1,
13,933 positions) includes concatenated nucleotide
sequences from 12 protein-coding genes (10,758 positions), 22 transfer RNA genes (1,406 positions) and the
two ribosomal RNA genes (1,769 positions). The second
(dataset #2, 13,933 positions) includes the same set of
characters with 3rd codon positions of the protein-coding
genes converted into purine (R) and pyrimidine (Y), and
the third matrix (dataset #3, 10,347 positions) with the
3rd codon positions excluded. Assuming that functional
constraints on sequence evolution are more similar
within codon positions (or types of molecules) across
genes than across codon positions (or types of molecules)
within genes, five partitions (1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions of protein-coding genes, tRNA genes and rRNA
genes) were set for the datasets #1 and #2, and four partitions (no third codon positions included) were done for
dataset #3.
The general time reversible model with some sites
assumed to be invariable and with variable sites assumed
to follow a discrete gamma distribution [ref. [54]; GTR + I
+ Î] was used for model of sequence evolution, as it was
selected as best-fitting model with MRMODELTEST (Version 2) [55] for each partition except for positions with
the RY-coding. We assumed that all of the model parameters were unlinked and rate multipliers were variable
across partitions. For 3rd codon positions in the dataset
#2, we used arbitrarily "A" and "C" instead of "R" and "Y"
and set a single rate category (lset nst = 1) instead of six
(lset nst = 6) to allow the program to estimate only transversional changes between purine (R) and pyrimidine (Y)
nucleotides. MrBayes unnecessarily estimated transitional
changes (A â G or C â T) when RY-coding was
employed, which simply imposed fixed nucleotide compositions on R (A + G) and Y (C + T) during the calculation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/10

For each of the three matrices, two independent Bayesian
analyses with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process of 3,000,000 generations were performed. Parameter
values and trees were sampled every 1,000 generations,
and the samples before the convergence of the Markov
chain were discarded for each run. The remaining samples
from the two independent run were combined into a single file with a total of 5,200, 4,700 and 5,520 phylogenetic trees, respectively. The combined tree files were then
imported into PAUP (Version 4.0b10) [56] to compute
the 50% majority rule consensus trees. The percentages for
the branches in the consensus trees represent the Bayesian
posterior probabilities, which are the rough equivalent of
a maximum likelihood search with bootstrapping [53].
Testing an alternative phylogenetic hypothesis
We tested an alternative hypothesis for labroid phylogeny
using Bayes factors. Constrained Bayesian trees (imposing
labroid monophyly on the trees) were estimated with
MRBAYES (Version 3.1.2) [53] and harmonic means of
log likelihood scores (calculated using "sump" command) were compared between constrained and unconstrained trees. Two independent partitioned Bayesian
analyses with MCMC process of 3,000,000 generations
were performed based on the dataset #2 (RY coding),
which effectively removes likely "noise" from the dataset
and avoids the apparent lack of signal by retaining all
available positions in the dataset. Parameters and trees
were sampled in the same way as described above, being
combined into a single file with a total of 5,200 trees. The
alternative trees were then compared using a Bayesian
approach with Bayes factors [57], the traditional criterion
of 2 ln Bayes factor of â¥ 10 being used as very strong evidence against the alternative hypothesis [58].
