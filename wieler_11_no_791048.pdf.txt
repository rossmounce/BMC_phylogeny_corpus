Abstract
Background: Ruminants, in particular bovines, are the primary reservoir of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), but
whole genome analyses of the current German ESBL-producing O104:H4 outbreak strain of sequence type (ST) 678
showed this strain to be highly similar to enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). Strains of the EAEC pathotype are
basically adapted to the human host. To clarify whether in contrast to this paradigm, the O104:H4 outbreak strain
and/or EAEC may also be able to colonize ruminants, we screened a total of 2.000 colonies from faecal samples of
100 cattle from 34 different farms - all located in the HUS outbreak region of Northern Germany - for genes
associated with the O104:H4 HUS outbreak strain (stx2, terD, rfbO104, fliCH4), STEC (stx1, stx2, escV), EAEC (pAA, aggR,
astA), and ESBL-production (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV).
Results: The faecal samples contained neither the HUS outbreak strain nor any EAEC. As the current outbreak
strain belongs to ST678 and displays an en-teroaggregative and ESBL-producing phenotype, we additionally
screened selected strains for ST678 as well as the aggregative adhesion pattern in HEp-2 cells. However, we were
unable to find any strains belonging to ST678 or showing an aggregative adhesion pattern. A high percentage of
animals (28%) shed STEC, corroborating previous knowl-edge and thereby proving the validity of our study. One of
the STEC also harboured the LEE pathogenicity island. In addition, eleven animals shed ESBL-producing E. coli.
Conclusions: While we are aware of the limitations of our survey, our data support the theory, that, in contrast to
other Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, cattle are not the reservoir for the O104:H4 outbreak strain or other EAEC, but
that the outbreak strain seems to be adapted to humans or might have yet another reservoir, raising new
questions about the epidemiology of STEC O104:H4.

Background
The month of May 2011 marked the beginning of an
outbreak of haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) caused
by an unusual Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC)
O104:H4 strain, belonging to the HUSEC041 clone

(HUS-associated enterohaemorrhagic E. coli) because of
this specific serotype [1]. The strain, which was found to
be of sequence type (ST) 678 rendered many ill and also
claimed several lives in Germany. The epicentre of the
outbreak was Northern Germany, from where it has
spread throughout Germany and beyond, to other European countries [2-4]. With a predominance of infection
in adult women and more than 800 cases of haemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS) accompanied with central

nervous system complications, this outbreak is unusual.
While the reasons for this are currently unknown, it has
already been proven that the outbreak strain has an
unusual genome make up, as it shows a strong similarity
to an enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) of the same serotype, which was previously isolated from a patient in
Africa. Therefore, this E. coli strain combines virulence
traits of EAEC and STEC [3,5-8].
The principal reservoir of STEC strains are ruminants. However, they have not been reported to harbour STEC O104:H4 nor EAEC [9-11]. To analyse
whether the O104:H4 outbreak strain and/or related
strains were shed by cattle in the outbreak region, we
sought to investigate faecal samples from cattle, originating from the current outbreak area. To address this
question, we collected faecal samples from 100 slaughter cattle originating from 34 different farms located in
the vicinity of the outbreak area in Northern Germany.
Sampling was done on one day in one abattoir. Our
findings indicate that the reservoir of the current outbreak strain in fact does not seem to be cattle, addressing the question of whether humans or other so far
unrecognized hosts act as a reservoir for these highly
pathogenic STEC strains.

Results
On June 6 th , 2011, during the time of the HUS outbreak, we visited a local abattoir and collected faecal
samples of 100 animals, which were slaugh-tered on
that day. As shown in Figure 1, most of the 34 farms
these animals originated from were located in the outbreak area. The number of animals tested per farm ranged from one to twenty-one (Xmed = 2; Xarith = 2.94).
After cultivation (18 h, 37°C), 20 coliform colonies per
animal (2.000 colonies in total) were picked according
to the colony morphology and further investigated in a
two-step-process: (i) testing the investigated colonies for
the presence of the O104:H4 HUS outbreak strain, and
(ii) testing the investigated colonies for the presence of
STEC and EAEC as well as ESBL-positive strains using
both PCR and phenotypic methods.
Screening bovine faecal E. coli for the HUS O104:H4
outbreak strain

In the first part of the present study, the strains were
tested using the Multiplex-PCR developed by Bielaszewska et al. (2011) for rapid detection of the outbreak
strain. Out of 2.000 E. coli isolates derived from the 100
faecal samples investigated, not a single one showed the
O104:H4 HUS outbreak strain-specific combination of
the genes stx2, terD, rfbO104, and fliCH4 detected by this
Multiplex-PCR. Thus, not a single animal shed the
O104:H4 outbreak strain.

Screening bovine faecal E. coli for the presence of STEC,
EAEC, and ESBL-positive isolates

The second part of the study focussed on the question,
whether STEC, EAEC, or ESBL-positive strains are
present in the investigated population. For this purpose, the strains were further tested for (i) STEC and
EPEC properties, namely stx1, stx2, bfpA, and escV; (ii)
enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) properties, especially
the occurrence of the genes pAA, aggR, but also the
enteroaggregative adhesion pattern; and (iii) ESBL
phenotype.
(i) Twenty-eight of the 100 faecal samples tested harboured STEC. One single sample could be positive for
different STEC strains, that is, harbouring isolates either
positive for stx1 or stx2 or both (Table 1). Most of these
samples (n = 19) harboured isolates containing stx2
only. Eight samples harboured isolates with both stx1
and stx2, and only one of these samples contained an
isolate positive for stx1 only. One animal shed an isolate
which, in addition to stx2, was positive for the escV

gene, indicating the possession of a Locus of enterocyte
effacement (LEE). As for the bfpA gene, we were unable
to find any positive isolate, thus no typical EPEC were
identified.

(ii) None of the animals shed any isolates that showed
typical genetic features of EAEC, as not a single sample
could be identified, that harboured isolates reacting
positive for pAA or aggR. In contrast, a large number of

Wieler et al. Gut Pathogens 2011, 3:17

Page 4 of 10

animals shed isolates that reacted positively for astA, the
gene encoding an enterotoxin, which had originally been
identified in EAEC, but is not specific for this pathotype.
In summary, while STEC were shed by 28% of the
investigated animals, not a single animal shed EAEC.
(iii) Eleven of the one hundred animals tested shed a
total of 14 ESBL-producing E. coli as identified using
the CHROMagar orientation supple-mented with cefotaxime. These animals originated from nine different
farms. PCR based screening and subsequent sequence
analysis revealed blaCTX-M-1 (n = 12) as the most common ESBL-resistance determinant. Additionally, we
found a single blaTEM-positive isolate, which was identified as blaTEM52, and another ESBL-producing isolate
positive for bla CTX-M-15. As outlined in Table 2 some
ESBL-producing strains further possessed different virulence factors. The single bla CTX-M-15 -positive strain
IMT26356 harboured genes terD and astA. Also, four of
the blaCTX-M1-positive strains were positive for fliCH4,
the gene encoding H-antigen 4, but none possessed
O104-encoding genes.
MLST

Even though we were unable to identify either the O104:
H4 outbreak strain or any EAEC, nevertheless we chose
a total of 86 strains with at least one characteristic of
the O104:H4 HUS-outbreak strain for further proof of
our results. As the phylogenetic relationship of E. coli
strains is more accurately reflected by its sequence type
than by its serotype, we first sequenced the two housekeeping genes icd and mdh, the alleles of which are able
to specifically determine strains of ST678. As the outbreak strain belongs to ST678, the unique combination
of icd 136 and mdh 9 determines the existence of any

phylogenetically related strain. The 86 strains were
selected for MLST on the following bases: (i) ESBL-producing strains, (ii) strains positive for stx2, (iii) strains
positive for fliC H4 , and (iv) strains positive for terD.
However, we did not find the unique ST678 allele combination of icd 136 and mdh 9 in any of these investigated strains. While icd allele 136 was never found, 18
strains contained mdh allele 9. Of these 18 strains that
where potentially related to each other due to the common mdh allele, we identified 10 strains to be related to
ST678 by Maximum Parsimony analysis (Figure 2).
Three of them showed the icd allele 18 and seven
strains shared the icd allele 26. As icd 18 differs in only
one and icd 26 in just two nucleotides from icd 136, we
additionally performed a complete MLST analyses for
these 10 strains to further determine the degree of relatedness of these strains to ST678.
The sequence types identified in these 10 strains differed in around 3 to 5 alleles from ST678 of the O104:
H4 outbreak strain. An additionally performed clustering based on the nucleotide differences of the 7 MLST
genes further substantiated these results as they clearly
identified a rather distant similarity between these 10
strains and the O104:H4 outbreak strain (Table 3 and
additional file 1).
Testing for the enteroaggregative adhesion pattern

Because it is known that EAEC are a diverse type of
pathogens [12], in addition to testing for EAEC specific
genes pAA or aggR, we tested 27 strains with some similarity to the outbreak strain, namely possession of virulence gene combinations similar to that of the outbreak
strain and/or showing an ESBL phenotype, and/or a
slight relation to ST678 as determined by MLST, in the

HEp-2 cell adhesion assay for the enteroaggregative
adhesion pattern. The features of these 27 tested strains
are given in additional file 2. Not a single strain displayed this adhesion pattern, while EAEC 17-2 and the
HUS outbreak strain RKI II-2027 did (data not shown).
Therefore, our cumulative data show that the investigated animals did not shed any EAEC.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
which actively screened cattle during the O104:H4
ST678 HUS outbreak in Germany by simultaneously
taking samples of 100 slaughter cattle from 34 different
farms, which were located in close proximity of the outbreak area in Northern Germany in June 2011. By
screening for the three characteristics that make the
current outbreak strain so unique, namely Shiga toxin 2,
serotype O104:H4, and tellurite resistance, utilizing the
PCR protocol established by Bielaszewska et al. [3] and

phenotypically testing for ESBL-production, we could
clearly show that none of the samples harboured the
outbreak strain. This suggests that the strain was not
shed by any of the animals tested. This result was also
supported by additional sequence analyses, namely
MLST and further phylogenetic analyses, which could
clearly show that none of the strains that were found in
the cattle are closely related to the O104:H4 outbreak
strain.
In addition, we were not able to detect any strains that
belonged to the EAEC pathotype in any of the samples.
Furthermore, cell culture tests unravelling the adhesion
pattern of strains that shared at least some of the features of the outbreak strain did not reveal any strains
with an aggregative adhesion pattern, which due to the
large diversity of EAEC is still the gold standard for testing [13].
We are aware that active testing of 100 samples does
not give sound risk assessment about the possibility of

cattle serving as an infection source. Nevertheless, given
the fact that (i) we tested these animals during the HUS
outbreak [3,14] and (ii) EAEC have not been found in
previous studies in cattle [9-11], our findings indicate
that cattle are not the source of this current outbreak.
In effect, while we confirm previous findings on cattle
not shedding EAEC, our study is important with respect
to the fact that ruminants, and mainly cattle, are the primary reservoir of STEC. Therefore, our results, showing
that neither the O104:H4 outbreak strain nor any EAEC
could be isolated, strongly hint towards the possibility
that cattle are not the reservoir of the O104:H4 outbreak strain. Hence, the reservoir of these special STEC
is unknown and further work is needed to answer this
question.
According to the literature EAEC are highly adapted
to humans only, which would suggest the human to be
the reservoir [13,15]. This indeed would have a profound impact on infection epidemiology, particularly
when taking into account the role of humans who shed
the HUS outbreak strain without developing disease.
While it is known from previous studies that STEC are
shed, it can therefore be openly speculated for how long
and how intensely this strain could then be shed.
We were able to isolate STEC strains from 28% of the
animals, which also is an expected finding, substantiating our previous work and that of other colleagues from
Germany [16-20]. It is however worth mentioning, that
all of these animals shed one or more strains positive
for stx2, while only eight animals shed strains producing
stx1, all in addition to stx2-positive strains.
Another interesting finding was the isolation of 14
ESBL-producing E. coli out of 11 animals originating
from nine different farms, meaning that 11% of the animals actually shed ESBL-producing E. coli, mainly harbouring the gene blaCTX-M-1. We are not aware of too
many studies detecting such strains in faecal samples of
cattle, but this high percentage of ESBL-producers is
comparable to the so far limited knowledge given by
other studies, where up to 39% of the cattle of a single
farm were ESBL-producers mostly carrying blaCTX-M-1
[21-24]. Nearly all ESBL-positive strains we isolated

belonged to this group, suggesting that such strains are
obviously common in cattle worldwide.
In summary our data indicate that cattle are not the
reservoir for the O104:H4 outbreak strain or EAEC.
Clearly the identification of the ecology of the O104:H4
strains requires further investigation.

Conclusions
No O104:H4 outbreak strains could be detected in the
investigated cattle, while other STEC were present. In
addition, no E. coli showing character-istics of closely
related E. coli, e.g. aggR, pAA were isolated from the
samples, indicating that O104:H4 and EAEC may possibly have a reservoir other than cattle, which is known to
be the reservoir for “classical” STEC like serotype O157:
H7. This work presents the first step in the process of
identifying the host and res-ervoir of the O104:H4 outbreak strain.
Materials and methods
Reference strains

The following strains were used as reference strains for
all experiments elaborated as described in the Materials
and Methods section: Strain HUSEC041 (ST678; O104:
H4; [3]) and HUS-outbreak strain RKI II-2027 (ST678;
O104:H4, kindly provided by Angelika Fruth and Erhard
Tietze, Robert Koch Institute Wernigerode, Germany)
were the HUSEC http://www.ehec.org/ and outbreak
reference strains, respectively. The STEC reference
strain was EDL933 (ST11, O157:H7), while strain 17-2
(ST10; O3:H2) [25] served as EAEC reference strain. In
addition, E. coli strain E2348/69 (ST15; O127:H6) was
used as an EPEC reference strain (Table 4).
Faecal screening study

On June 6th, 2011, faecal samples were taken from the
gut of a total of 100 cattle, slaughtered on that day in
one abattoir. The animals originated from 34 different
farms in Northern Germany, the centre of the 2011
HUS outbreak. After diluting the samples in a ratio of
1:2 with PBS and vortexing, the samples were streaked
on (i) CHROMagar Orientation (Mast Diagnostics,

Paris, France), (ii) CHROMagar supplemented with cefotaxime (4 μg/ml) and (iii) Gassner agar plates (Oxoid
GmbH, Wesel, Germany). After 18 h of incubation at
37°C a total of 20 coliform colonies per animal were
picked from these three plates based on colony morphology and streaked on blood agar, resulting in the
total number of 2.000 coliform colonies that were
further investigated. The next day, the colonies were
grouped into 4 pools per animal, each pool containing
material of five coliform colonies and after heat lysis
treatment (10 min, 100°C) the pools were analysed using
three different Multiplex-PCRs (see below). If any gene
detected in these Multiplex-PCRs yielded a positive
result, the PCR was repeated with each single colony of
the pool. Positive colonies were puri-fied and tested biochemically to confirm that these were E. coli after which
each colony was now referred to as a bacterial strain.
Determination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
(ESBL)-producing E. coli

Colonies showing growth and the typical phenotype of
E. coli on CHROMagar agar plates supplemented with
cefotaxime were also tested bio-chemically to confirm
they were E. coli, and ESBL-production was confirmed
according to the CLSI criteria [26]. Colonies with a
positive confirmatory test were further processed and
regarded as bacterial strains. DNA was isolated using
standard methods and used for PCR based screening
and, if positive, subsequent sequencing of the ESBL
related genes blaCTX-M, blaTEM and blaSHV [27].
Determination of virulence-associated genes

Two of the three Multiplex-PCRs utilized in this study
have been published previously. In brief, for the detection and identification of the O104:H4 outbreak strain,
we used the recently described Multiplex-PCR for stx2,
terD, rfbO104, and fliCH4 [3].
In a second part of the study, STEC and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) were identified using a MultiplexPCR including stx1 and stx2 (STEC) as well as escV and
bfpA (EPEC) [28]. The screening for EAEC was performed by the detection of pAA, aggR, and astA by a
Multiplex-PCR based on published primer sequences
and single PCR protocols, respectively. Briefly, primers
for the detection of the virulence-associated factors pAA
(5’-CTGGCGAAAGACTGTATCAT-3’ and 5’-CAATGTATAGAAATCCGCTGTT-3’) [29], aggR (5’-GTATACACAAAAGAAGGAAGC-3’ and 5’-ACAGAATCGT
CAGCATCAGC-3’) [30], as well as astA (5’-TGCCATCAACACAGTATATCC-3’ and 5’-TAGGATCCTCAGGTCGCGAGTGACGGC-3’) [31], were chosen
according to primer compatibility and product size to fit
into a single Multiplex-PCR. In brief, this MultiplexPCR was performed in a 25 μl reaction mixture

Page 8 of 10

including 2.5 μl 10 × PCR buffer, 2.0 μl 50 mM MgCl2,
2U Taq DNA polymerase (Rapidozym, Germany), 0.5 μl
of each 10 mM dNTP, 0.1 μl (100 pmol) oligonucleotide
primer pair, and 4 μl template DNA, supplemented with
the appropriate volumes of double-distilled water. Reaction mixtures were subjected to the following temperature profiles: 5 min at 94°C; 25 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 1
min at 56°C, 45 s at 72°C, with a final circle of 10 min
at 72°C and a hold at 10°C.
Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) and phylogenetic
grouping

ST678, the ST of the current HUS outbreak strain,
according to the scheme described by Wirth et al. (2006)
[32] (http://mlst.ucc.ie/mlst/dbs/Ecoli) can easily be identified by the analyses of two housekeeping genes only,
namely icd and mdh, as the combination of icd allele 136
and mdh allele 9 specifically identifies this ST. Therefore,
all identified STEC, phenotypic ESBL-producing E. coli
and other isolates that harboured at least some of the
genetic features common to the outbreak strain were
further analysed by sequencing these two alleles.
All sequences generated for these two genes were concatenated and the phylogenetic relationship was inferred
using the Maximum Parsimony method. Phylogenetic
analyses were performed with Mega 5.05 (http://www.
megasoftware.net) and CLC Genomics Workbench 4.7
(http://www.clcbio.com). Based on these analyses, complete MLST was performed for all strains that seemed
to be very closely related to ST678. MLST determination was carried out as described previously [32] with
minor modifications as published by Ewers et al. [27].
Cell adhesion assay

As EAEC are a highly heterogeneous group of pathogens,
we further tested selected strains (n = 27) for their adhesion pattern in HEp-2 cells, the gold standard for EAEC
typing [12,33]. The selection of strains was based on the
results obtained in the Multiplex-PCRs (particularly, but
not exclusively, the ability to produce Shiga toxin), and/or
close relation to the outbreak strain according to the
MLST analysis (additional file 2). Briefly, HEp-2 cells were
seeded in 12-well-plates with cover slips 48 hours before
infection. After a three hour infection period using bacterial strains suspended in cell culture medium containing
1% mannose, HEp-2-cells on the cover slips were washed
with 1× PBS three times, fixated with methanol for 15
minutes and stained with freshly prepared GIEMSA staining solution (45 minutes, room temperature) [13].
