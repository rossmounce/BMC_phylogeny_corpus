Abstract
Background: The impact of diseases such as Phytophthora foot rot and the replacement of
unproductive cultivars by high yielding ones has brought about the disappearance of varieties in
Piper species, like any other crop. Black pepper (King of spices), is a major spice crop consumed
throughout the world. It is widely cultivated across various parts of the world apart from India. The
different cultivars may be genetically related and could be a source of valuable genes for disease
resistance and an increase in quantity and quality. Even though Western Ghats in India is believed
to be the site of origin of this crop, numerous accessions from the NBPGR have not yet been
evaluated. Our study aims to investigate the genetic relatedness in major cultivars of black pepper
using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism.
Results: Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphic (AFLP) DNA analysis was performed in thirty
popular cultivars of black pepper from National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), India.
Fingerprint profiles were generated initially with, five different primer combinations, from which
three primer pair combinations (EAGC/MCAA, EAGG/MCTA and EAGC/MCTG) gave consistent
and scorable banding patterns. From 173 scorable markers, 158(> 90%) were polymorphic which
shows there is considerable variation in the available germplasm. The dendrogram derived by
unweighted pair group method analysis (UPGMA) grouped the accessions into three major clusters
and four diverse cultivars with only 30% similarity. Karimunda, a widely grown and popular cultivar
was unique in the fingerprint profiles obtained.
Conclusion: There are currently few fingerprinting studies using the valuable spice crop black
pepper. We found considerable genetic variability among cultivars of black pepper. Fingerprinting
analysis with AFLP proved to be an ideal tool for cultivar identification and phylogenetic studies. It
shows the high level of polymorphism and the unique characterization of the major cultivars. An
extensive range of similarity value between the cultivars was noted (6.01 to 98.13). Further
screening of more cultivars will provide valuable information for current breeding programmes.

Background
The Piper genus includes the most valuable economically
important spice crop, black pepper (Piper nigrum L) the

'King of Spices' which is consumed throughout the world.
Apart from Asian countries such as Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, China and SriLanka, it is also

cultivated in Brazil and Madagascar. The humid climatic
conditions and the daily consumption in the diet made
this spice crop a synonym of the Asian continent. The
Western Ghats of Indian peninsula is the primary centre
of origin of the 'King of spices' (Piper nigrum L), the source
of medicinally and commercially important black pepper
[1]. By habit, it is a perennial woody climber. Kerala the
southernmost state of India occupies a considerable portion of the Western Ghats and is a rich source of wild relatives of this spice crop. The hot and humid climate of the
sub-mountainous tracts of Western Ghats is ideal for its
cultivation and hence Kerala is the centre for the production of most of the black pepper in India.

prints were created using five different AFLP primer combinations, from which three were selected for analysis.
The three primer pair combinations (EAGC/MCAA,
EAGG/MCTA and EAGC/MCTG) resolved 173 markers
that could be scored reliably. Across all the thirty cultivars
evaluated, 158 markers (91.4%) were polymorphic. The
details of the bands scored for further analysis with different primer combinations are illustrated in Table 1. A similarity matrix (Figure 2 and see Additional file 1) and a
UPGMA dendrogram (Figure 3a and 3b) were generated
from the AFLP analysis software (Bionumerics software
package, version 3.0, Applied Maths, Belgium). The dendrogram (Figure 3b) shows three main clusters (I, II and
III) and four genetically distinct cultivars. The majority of

Cytological studies [2-4] suggest that the basic chromosome number of Piper is x = 13, whereas Piper nigrum is
tetraploid (2n = 52). Chance cross-pollination between
different species of Piper might have occurred when more
than one species climbed up the same support trees. Due
to the absence of a pollen transfer mechanism, subsequent gene flow is restricted in these progenies. High successful vegetative propagation ensures further survival and
spread of these progenies. The present day Piper nigrum
cultivars are the descendants of such segregating populations which are vegetatively propagated by farmers
through cuttings [1]. Breeding and conservation programmes by humans based on good fruit set, pungency
etc, contributes to cultivar diversity.
Amplified Fragments Length Polymorphism (AFLP) is an
accepted tool among molecular biologists owing to its
high resolution, wide genome coverage and reproducibility. AFLP is a novel PCR based assay [5] for plant DNA fingerprinting that reveals significant levels of DNA
polymorphism. Genetic diversity studies by AFLP analysis
have been applied to several accessions of plant genera
like South Indian tea [6], Brassica [7], potato [8], soyabean
[9], barley [10], wheat [11], marijuana [12], lupines [13],
and opium poppy [14]. Awareness of genetic diversity
among the available germplasm is a worthy pre-requisite
for crop improvement programmes. To date, little work
has been published in fingerprinting studies of black pepper except for Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA
(RAPD) markers [15]. Even though RAPDs' generate polymorphic markers with random primers, the technique
suffers from irreproducibility between laboratories
[16,17]. The objective of the present study was to assess
the usefulness of AFLP for cultivar identification and to
determine genetic relationships of important cultivars of
Piper nigrum.

Results
AFLP analysis generated a large number of reproducible
and unambiguous markers for fingerprinting the cultivars
of black pepper used in the study. Initially DNA finger-

the cultivars fall into cluster II, which can be further
divided into four groups.
Our results show that cultivars with the same name from
different localities do not always group together. The Vellamundi accessions 14 and 11 are from different localities; both are in cluster II, group1 and have a similarity
coefficient of 96.6. Similarly, the Neelamundi accessions
10 and 17 have high similarity (92.56), although they
occur in different groups within cluster II. The Thevanmundi accessions 12 (unique) and 15 (cluster I) have a
similarity coefficient of 41.19. Likewise, the Karimunda
accessions 3 (cluster III) and 16 (unique) have low genetic
similarity (34.52). Morphological studies [1] found that
the Karimunda cultivar (from Kerala) had distinctive leaf
anatomical and stomatal characters. Accession 16 is most
dissimilar from the rest and therefore may be a candidate
for the "true" Karimunda. Regardless of names, the
genetic distinctiveness of accession 16 makes it potentially
more interesting for breeding programmes.

Our cluster analysis reveals four distinctive cultivars,
accession 7 (local e), 16 (Karimunda), 12 (Thevanmundi)
and 25 (Konnamankara). In our results, cultivars from the
same locality mostly cluster together – eg. Cluster II,
group 3 is made up of cultivars from Panniyur, all of the
cultivars from Nedunkandam are in Cluster II, group 1,
the Kochandi and Konni cultivars are together in cluster II,
group 2, the Puyamkutti cultivars are together in cluster
III.
AFLP analysis can provide information about locally
derived (unnamed) cultivars. In our results, the local
accessions mostly cluster with named accessions, except
for local e, which is apparently not closely related to any
of the other cultivars. Analysis of further accessions, particularly from the Ayiram Acre locality will help determine
whether this cultivar is really genetically unique.
Morphologically the cultivars Kuching (29), Vattamundi
(9), Kottanadan (28) and Thevanmundi (12 or 15) have
been found to be similar [18,19]. Our AFLP analysis
shows that Kuching (29), Vattamundi (9), Kottanadan

and Kuching/Thevanmundi 15 having a coefficient of
67.21. Kuching is the most popular cultivar in Malaysia. It

from Southern India by the Chinese trader Zheng, who

of the Indian germplasm [21]. Pradeepkumar et al., 2003
[22] reports the increase in divergence among landraces,
compared to the advanced cultivars, that have been
derived mostly by clonal selection from land races,
though a few are of hybrid origin. Morphologically divergent intraspecific variants of this species occur both in
wild forms and in the cultivated varieties. These facts
should be considered essentially to select diverse types in
crossing programmes for improvement of breeding and
while planning conservation strategies.

Discussion
Piper nigrum L. has a high level of polymorphism (96.6%)
among the cultivars indicating extensive genetic variation

The AFLP profiles depend mainly on the selective base

EcoR1/MseI restriction digested DNA fragments. The selective base pairs in the primer correspond to the first base
pairs of the genomic DNA beyond the restriction site.
Changing these three selective base pairs in the primer can
be used as a dynamic tool to scrutinize the genetic diversity within specific plant populations.
Fingerprint profiles generated were best with the three
primer combinations EAGC/MCAA, EAGG/MCTA and
EAGC/MCTG. In a similar study on Lettuce [23], 320 polymorphic loci were determined using only three AFLP
primer combinations. In our study the mean number of
bands created was highest (72) for primer pair EAGC/
MCAA, when compared to the other two combinations
selected (EAGG/MCTA-63, EAGC/MCTG-38). Even
though the primer pair EAGC/MCAA had greater number
of scorable bands, the number of polymorphic bands was
high for EAGG/MCTA-62/63; hence the percentage of polymorphism was maximum (98.74%) for this primer pair
selected. A comprehensive analysis was achieved when the
individual dendrograms of each primer pair tested were
compared with the composite dendrogram of all the chosen three primer pairs. The mean percentages of polymorphism of all the three primer combinations were found to
be very high (> 90%). The majority of landraces were distinctly different from advanced cultivars in the molecular
profile indicating artificial breeding efforts have brought
distinct genetic changes in the species.
During the course of time, human migration from the
plains to the hilly tracts of Western Ghats contributed to
the spread of certain high yielding cultivars of black pepper. The cultivars were clonally propagated, identified and
named by the farmers. These form the basis of the present
day landraces in confined areas. Given this history, it is
not surprising to find some possible discrepancies in the
naming and identification of cultivars. AFLP analysis is an
ideal tool for investigating genetic similarity among accessions from the germplasm collection and identifying the
most divergent cultivars. AFLP analysis can also provide
information on the uniqueness of the unnamed local cultivars.

Conclusion
Pepper, is a valuable spice crop. AFLP fingerprinting studies circumvents the traditional methods for identification
of cultivars, which will take several years. Using incorrectly identified germplasm material for breeding programmes can produce misleading and unsuccessful
results. As seen from the preliminary results, AFLP marker
has the potential to provide solutions to the presence of
duplicates in the collection of germplasm, misnaming of
cultivars etc. Thus the data obtained, can also be utilized
for further comparison and improvement of pepper cultivars, thereby ensuring a promising future by facilitating

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/42

rational selection of parents from genetically divergent
groups of cultivars. Linkage of genetic markers to specific
commercial traits in future will assist plantation management strategies. All the observations support the view that
pepper originated in the tropical evergreen forests of
Western Ghats and that it is a species that is still in evolution.

Methods
Plant material
Thirty accessions of black pepper were obtained from the
germplasm collection of National Bureau of Plant Genetic
Resource (NBPGR), Thrissur. This represents the most
popular widely cultivated landraces. The cultivars extend
across the central, southern and northern parts of the state
of Kerala (Table 2).
DNA extraction
From 1 g of young tender leaves of each black pepper cultivar, total genomic DNA was isolated, using Nucleon
phtyopure plant DNA extraction kit (Amersham) according to manufacturer's instructions.
AFLP analysis
DNA fingerprints were generated according to the standard protocol using the AFLP kit (Invitrogen). For each
sample, 0.5 μg of DNA was restriction digested with 2.5 μg
of EcoRI/MseI restriction enzyme in a total reaction volume of 25 μl and incubated at 37°C for 2 hrs. Samples
were then transferred to 70°C bath for 15 min before
being briefly cooled on ice to inactivate the enzyme.
Digested DNA, was supplemented with 25 μl of adapter
solution (EcoRI/MseI adapters, 0.4 mM ATP, 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM Mg-acetate, 50 mM K-acetate) and
1 μl of T4 DNA ligase and incubated at 20°C for 2 hrs.
This was then diluted (1:10) with TE buffer. 5 μl of diluted
ligation mix was combined with 40 μl of preamp primer
mix, 5 μl of 10×buffer plus MgCl2 and 5 μl of Taq DNA
polymerase in order to perform the pre selective amplification. PCR was performed for 20 cycles of 94°C for 30 s,
56°C for 60 s and 72°C for 60 s. Consequently the PCR
amplification mixture was diluted (1:50) with TE buffer.
For selective amplification, the EcoRI primer in each
primer pair combination chosen was radiolabelled with [γ
33P] ATP. About 18 μl of EcoRI selective primer was
labeled with [γ 33P] ATP using 20 μl of T4 polynucleotide
kinase (50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.6), 25 mM KCl, 1 mM βmercaptoethanol, 0.1 μM ATP, 50% (v/v) glycerol) in 5 ×
kinase buffer in a total reaction of 50 μl. Labeling was
done at 37°C for 1 hr and kept back at 70°C for 10 min
for heat inactivation of enzymes. A 50 ul reaction comprising, 5 μl each of diluted pre selective DNA sample, 5
μl of radiolabelled EcoRI primer, 5 μl each of MseI primer,
20 μl of 10 × PCR buffers with MgCl2 and 5 μl of Taq DNA
polymerase, was subjected to a touch down PCR of 13

cycles, which included 94°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s and
72°C for 60 s. The annealing temperature were reduced by
0.7°C during these 13 cycles in an attempt to give a touchdown phase from 65°C to 56°C. This was followed by 23
cycle reactions of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s and 72°C
for 60 s. The amplification products were electrophoresed
at constant power in a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel,
to resolve the fragments until xylene cyanol run two-third
down the length of the gel. The experiment was repeated
to confirm the results. Later the gel was vacuum dried at
80°C for 1 hr and developed using the phosphor imager
(Biorad) after exposure for 3–4 hrs.
Data analysis
Each fingerprint profile was scored for the presence or
absence of bands. Very faint bands were excluded and
only the scorable, intense bands were used for further
analysis. The fingerprint profile with the selected bands
alone was further analysed by Bionumerics software package, version 3 (Applied maths, Belgium). A composite
dendrogram (for the three primer combinations) and a
Pearson correlation coefficient similarity matrix were generated based on the Unweighted Pair Group Method with
Arithematic mean (UPGMA).
