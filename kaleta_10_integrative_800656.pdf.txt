in Escherichia coli using information theoretic
concepts and sequence analysis

Abstract
Background: Although Escherichia coli is one of the best studied model organisms, a comprehensive
understanding of its gene regulation is not yet achieved. There exist many approaches to reconstruct regulatory
interaction networks from gene expression experiments. Mutual information based approaches are most useful for
large-scale network inference.
Results: We used a three-step approach in which we combined gene regulatory network inference based on
directed information (DTI) and sequence analysis. DTI values were calculated on a set of gene expression profiles
from 19 time course experiments extracted from the Many Microbes Microarray Database. Focusing on influences
between pairs of genes in which one partner encodes a transcription factor (TF) we derived a network which
contains 878 TF - gene interactions of which 166 are known according to RegulonDB. Afterward, we selected a
subset of 109 interactions that could be confirmed by the presence of a phylogenetically conserved binding site of
the respective regulator. By this second step, the fraction of known interactions increased from 19% to 60%. In the
last step, we checked the 44 of the 109 interactions not yet included in RegulonDB for functional relationships
between the regulator and the target and, thus, obtained ten TF - target gene interactions. Five of them concern
the regulator LexA and have already been reported in the literature. The remaining five influences describe
regulations by Fis (with two novel targets), PhdR, PhoP, and KdgR. For the validation of our approach, one of them,
the regulation of lipoate synthase (LipA) by the pyruvate-sensing pyruvate dehydrogenate repressor (PdhR), was
experimentally checked and confirmed.
Conclusions: We predicted a set of five novel TF - target gene interactions in E. coli. One of them, the regulation
of lipA by the transcriptional regulator PdhR was validated experimentally. Furthermore, we developed DTInfer, a
new R-package for the inference of gene-regulatory networks from microarrays using directed information.

Background
Gene regulation represents a central mechanism in the
control of the phenotype of an organism. Thus, the
comprehension of gene regulatory mechanisms is a central topic in Systems Biology [1]. The prokaryote Escherichia coli is best suited as a model organism for
genome-wide network inference studies due to the
available and well-documented molecular biological
knowledge and the remarkable amount of published

genome-wide data. Relevance or association networks
[2] are widely used for genome-wide network inference.
They require, first, a measure to evaluate association of
pairs of genes, second, a threshold to cut off irrelevant
associations, and, third, a criterion or algorithm to discriminate between direct and indirect interactions. The
ready-to-use algorithms ARACNE [3,4], Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR, [5]) and MRNET [6] use
mutual information (MI) as the association measure. A
drawback of MI is represented by the fact that it is an
undirected measure. That is, to derive causal relations
from the inferred associations between interacting
nodes, further information is necessary, in particular, to
qualify one node as the regulator and the other as the

target. There are several ways to derive a causal interaction from an inferred association: First, one can integrate prior knowledge. In [5] the inferred interactions
are restricted to cases where one partner is a transcription factor (TF). Another approach is to use active and
gene-specific interventions, like knockouts, knockdowns
or over expressions. A third way is to exploit time series
data and use them to infer the direction of association
from temporal patterns. In this context directed information (DTI, [7]) can be used. DTI is an extension of
the concept of MI that allows to measure the direction
of an information flow between two random variables. It
has been used earlier to infer gene regulatory mechanisms in kidney development [8]. In this work we
improved the computation of DTI and used it to infer
regulatory networks on a genome scale.
A second important step in the inference of generegulatory networks is the integration of additional
knowledge. This process allows one to reduce the number of false positive predictions. One such approach is
the integration of information extracted from genome
sequence data. For predicted interactions between TFs
and genes it is, for instance, possible to align the promoter regions of the predicted targets of a specific TF
with each other to detect overrepresented motifs [5].
One possible explanation of such overrepresented motifs
is that they correspond to a binding site of a common
TF. On the other hand, if some binding sites of a TF
are already known, the promoter regions of the putative
target genes can be searched for sequences resembling
these known binding sites. However, the sequences of
binding sites can be very heterogeneous. In consequence, a binding site can be additionally validated by
checking its phylogenetical conservation over several
species [8]. This approach was used in this work.
A third step to reduce the number of false positive
interactions is to integrate prior knowledge in form of
known functional relationships between the regulator
and the predicted target into the inference procedure.
Finally, the predicted interactions have to be verified
experimentally. In order to select a candidate interaction
to verify we chose the regulation of a gene by a transcription factor whose targets are most suitably detected
by our method. Thus, the present work demonstrates
the full cycle of systems biological work, from genomewide data analysis via large-scale modeling, to prediction
of testable hypothesis by studying certain regulatory
modules of interest, and, finally, to the prediction and
experimental validation of novel molecular mechanisms.

Results and Discussion
The setup of our analysis is outlined in Fig. 1. The procedure started by the extraction of microarray experiments
containing equidistant time-series data from the Many

Microbes Microarray Database (M3D, [9]). In the second
step a DTI matrix was calculated. Afterward, TF-gene
interactions were selected and a background correction
was performed using the CLR algorithm [5] by computing the significances (z-scores) of the DTI values. The
threshold for the acceptance of an interaction was determined by a comparison of the inferred network to known
TF-gene interactions contained within RegulonDB version 6.1 [10]. There are 316 known and predicted TFs
denoted in RegulonDB (see Additional File 1: Supplemental Material S6 for a list of TFs). A precision of 40%
was used to calculate the threshold for the z-score.
Usually, precision is defined as the fraction of known
interactions within the inferred graph. Note that we did
not compute here precision in this classical sense, but
similar to [5](see Methods). Thus, we inferred 878 interactions, of which 166 are known. We compared our
results to those that can be obtained using other inferences procedures building on mutual information. At the
same precision, CLR based on mutual information [5]
infers 1155 interactions of which 175 are known. Using
ARACNE [3,4] and the same mutual information matrix
we obtain 167 interactions of which 21 are known. In
conclusion, our method, i.e. DTI with CLR, as well as
mutual information in combination with CLR perform
much better than ARACNE that does not use CLR. For a
more detailed comparison of precision at different numbers of inferred interactions see Additional File 1: Supplemental Material S3.
The inferred interactions were validated by a search
for a phylogenetically conserved binding site of the TF
upstream of its putative target. The validated interactions were manually enriched for functional relationships between the regulator and the targets to select
candidates for an experimental verification. Finally, the
most promising regulatory interaction between PdhR
and lipA was experimentally verified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
Validation of predicted interactions by sequence analysis

The predicted TF - gene interactions were validated by
searching for phylogenetically conserved transcription
factor binding sites (TFBS) in the promoter region of
the presumed target genes. To this end known binding
sites of the regulator are aligned with the promoter
region of the putative target using the motif discovery
tools cosmo [11]. If a region that resembles the known
binding sites of the regulator was discovered, we
checked whether this region overlaps to more than 50%
with a phylogenetically conserved region of the genome.
If we found such an overlap, the interaction was
accepted. For more information on the search for binding sites see Methods and Additional File 1: Supplemental Material S4. This leads to 109 accepted interactions,

of which 65 are known according to RegulonDB [Additional File 1: Supplemental Material S7]. While the total
number of predicted interactions dropped from 878 to
109, the fraction of known interactions increased from
166/878 = 19% within the network inferred using DTI
to 65/109 = 60% when additionally requiring the presence of a phylogenetically conserved binding site of the
regulator. Thus, the search for phylogenetically conserved binding sites reduces the number of inferred
interactions to a much smaller set which is supported
by additional evidence. However, due to this step we
might also loose true positive interactions since only
about one third of the TFBS overlap to more than 50%
with a conserved region of the E. coli genome [Additional File 1: Supplemental Material S4].

For the 44 (109-65) interactions not reported in RegulonDB for which we found a phylogenetically conserved
binding site, we checked for functional relationships
between the regulator and the target. Thus, we found
ten interactions (table 1). Five of them have already
been reported in the literature [12-14], but were not yet
included in RegulonDB 6.1.
Predicted and functionally related interactions
Predicted targets of LexA

LexA is an important regulator in the bacterial SOS
response allowing to bypass lesions or errors in DNA
during replication [15]. As already observed by [5],
many of the known targets of LexA can be correctly
identified from microarray experiments present in M3D

Overview over the regulatory interactions inferred by the use of DTI and
validated through a phylogenetically conserved TFBS in the promoter region
of the target gene not yet reported in RegulonDB. A total of 10 interactions of
which five have already been reported elsewhere are predicted (indicated in
column five). Of the 44 interactions that have been not included in Regulon
DB v. 6.1 but have been validated through the search for a phylogenetically
conserved binding site of the regulator, ten were ascertained through a
functional relationship of the putative target with other known targets of the
regulator. In the third column the z-score of the interaction and in the forth
column the average overlap of known TFBS of the regulator with conserved
regions of the genome are given. The interaction marked with $ lies within
the same operon like a gene for which an interaction has been inferred. For
additional interactions validated through the chromosomal location of the
target downstream of an operon known to be regulated by the putative
regulator see Additional File 1: Supplemental Material S8.

since a significant portion of the experiments stored in
this database involve DNA damage. Additionally, LexA
binds to a very specific DNA sequence (Fig. 2): the
LexA binding site is flanked by three very well preserved
nucleotides containing a stretch of AT repeats.
The search for phylogenetically conserved binding
sites for predicted interactions identified five new targets
of the transcription factor LexA: cho, dinB, dinI, dinD
and yebG. These five genes have been reported previously to be regulated by LexA [12,16], but were not
yet included in Regulon DB 6.1.
PdhR

We found strong evidence, both on an expression and
phylogenetic level, for the regulation of lipA by PdhR.
PdhR is an important regulator of central metabolism
by controlling the transcription of the components of
the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and several genes
involved in the respiratory chain [17]. LipA encodes the
lipoate synthase which catalyzes the last step in lipoate
biosynthesis and incorporation. Lipoate is an important
co-factor of LpdA that is contained in the the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
and the glycine cleavage complex [18].
PhoP

According to RegulonDB, PhoP binds in the promoter
regions of 31 genes. Among the genes regulated by
PhoP are two genes involved in methionine biosynthesis.
One of the corresponding enzymes, encoded by metB,
catalyzes the step of the incorporation of sulfur

contained within cysteine into O-succinyl-L-homoserine
to produce cystathionine, subsequently converted into
methionine. A putative phylogenetically conserved binding site of PhoP in the upstream region of cysB was
detected. CysB encodes a TF regulating several genes
necessary for the production of cysteine from which
methionine is synthesized in E. coli [19].
KdgR

A newly predicted target of KdgR is edd encoding a gluconate dehydratase in the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.
While a binding site of KdgR in the upstream region of
eda, the Entner-Doudoroff aldolase, is known [20],
hitherto no binding site upstream of edd which precedes
eda on the chromosome has been reported. Regulation
by KdgR induces eda if glucuronate, galacturonate, or
methyl-b-d-glucuronide are present in the growth media
[20]. The activation of eda allows the growth on these
compounds. The existence of a binding site upstream of
edd would furthermore allow a control of the metabolic
flux into the pentose-phosphate-pathway.
Fis

Fis is a small protein that plays an important role in the
organization and maintenance of nucleotide structure by
binding to DNA. Furthermore, it modulates the expression of other proteins serving this purpose [14,21] and
is involved in the regulation of many other processes of
the cell. In [14] it was found that the expression of 21%
of all genes of E. coli changed after an knockout of Fis.
Due to its involvement in nucleotide organization, only
some of the binding sites of Fis confer a regulatory
influence. In contrast to LexA, the binding sites of Fis
are less preserved in their sequence (Fig. 3). In consequence, the evidence from a detected binding site of Fis
in the promoter regions of rplM and rpsI is not as
strong as in the case of the detected binding sites of
LexA. rplM and rpsI encode ribosomal proteins. Many
proteins of the translational apparatus in turn are
known to be regulated by Fis [22]. However, in [14]
who studied the distribution of Fis binding sites within
the entire genome of E. coli, no binding site of Fis
upstream of these two genes was identified.
Selection of candidates and experimental verification

In order to select a candidate for the experimental validation of a predicted interaction we compared the zscores and the average phylogenetical conservation of
known binding sites of each TF (Table 1) for the interactions reported in the last section. Especially, the TFBS
of LexA and PdhR are well conserved. Furthermore, the
z-scores of the interactions of these regulators are the
highest. Since the predicted targets of LexA have already
been experimentally verified in [12,16], we thus chose
the regulation of lipA by PdhR as best candidate for an
experimental validation of a predicted interaction.

sequence of the binding site, with the height of each letter indicating the information content of each position.

To confirm the presence of a PdhR binding site in
the promoter region of lipA, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As a positive control
we used standard conditions to detect the PdhRdependent shift of the DNA fragment of the previously
reported PdhR binding site within the promoter region
of the pdhR-aceEF-ldpA operon (Fig. 4A). Previous
studies on the regulation of PdhR unveiled that pyruvate inactivates the PdhR binding activity in several
promoter regions including the PdhR binding site in
the pdhR-aceEF-ldpA operon [17]. We could confirm
this result, which also indicated a completely functional PdhR protein (Fig. 4B). To exclude unspecific
binding of PdhR to heterologous DNA, which does not
contain any PdhR binding site, we incubated the
repressor with a DNA fragment, which includes the
Mlc binding site within the ptsG operator promoter
region. No shift of this DNA fragment was observed
(Fig. 4C). For the promotor region of lipA, the PdhRdependent complex of DNA and repressor protein
became evident in the appearance of the shifted promoter region of lipA (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, we could

demonstrate that the interaction of PdhR with the lipA
promoter region was abolished in the presence of pyruvate (Fig. 4E).
R-package for Network Inference

The methods for the inference of gene regulatory networks presented in this work have been implemented in
an R-package that can be downloaded from http://users.
minet.uni-jena.de/~m3kach/DTInfer/[Additional File 2].
Given the time-courses of expression values for a set of
genes over one or several experiments, DTI values are
computed between arbitrary sets of genes. Additionally
it is possible to compute MI values. DTIs and MIs can
be estimated using one of two estimators; a kernel density estimator we implemented based on the work of
[23] and a b-spline estimator based on the work of [24],
implemented by Boris Hayete and provided by courtesy
of the Gardner Lab of the Berkeley University. Significance of the MI or DTI values, as well as those provided
by the user are assessed through the Context Likelihood
of Relatedness algorithm presented in [5]. Finally, interactions are inferred either at a certain precision (see

Conclusions
In this work we used directed information (DTI) to infer
transcription factor gene interactions in E. coli. In contrast to previous works using DTI [8] we improved the
inference procedure in several points. First, we used a
more precise algorithm for the computation of mutual
information required for the estimation of DTI. Second,
we used CLR [5] in order to determine the significance
of the DTI values. This step is necessary to remove
interactions starting or ending in genes which have high
DTI values with many other genes. Third, we validated
the inferred interactions by the search for phylogenetically conserved transcription factor binding sites. Especially this last step allows to drastically increase the
fraction of true positives in the set of inferred interactions. Finally, by additionally requiring a functional relationship between regulator and target, we extracted a
set of ten TF - gene interactions of which five are
unknown in the literature. We predicted that PhoP

regulates cysB encoding a global regulator of cysteine
biosynthesis, KdgR putatively regulates edd encoding the
gluconate dehydratase, Fis putatively regulates rpsI and
rplM encoding two ribosomal proteins, and PdhR regulates lipA encoding the lipoate synthase.
Experimentally validating the most likely candidate of
a predicted interaction we were able to shed new light
on the regulation of central metabolism. We found that
the transcription factor PdhR does not only regulate the
expression of the the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)
multi-enzyme complex, but additionally controls the
production of the co-factor lipoate required for
the activity of this enzyme complex by regulating the
expression of the lipoate synthase LipA. Thus, these
new findings further emphasize the role of pyruvatesensing PdhR in the control of the activity of LpdA, the
E3 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,
the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and the glycine
cleavage complex. Moreover they underline the key role
of the regulator PdhR in the control of fluxes at the pyruvate node that connects glycolysis, citric acid cycle and
lipid metabolism.

with 39 pmol PdhR (lane 2) and with PdhR and 50 mM pyruvate (lane 3). C The Mlc consensus sequence was incubated with purified PdhR (18,

pmol) E The lipA operator promoter was incubated with 44 pmol PdhR (lane 2) and with PdhR and 100 mM pyruvate (lane 3).

Additional to the ten predicted interactions, we found
eight cases for which we did not detect a phylogenetically conserved binding site, but we could support our
prediction using data from the literature [Additional File
1: Supplemental Materials S8 and S9]. In one case a
binding site has been detected independently. In seven
cases an alternative operon structure reported in the literature supports the predicted interactions.
In conclusion, our work demonstrates the importance
of integration of different types of data and prior knowledge into network inference algorithms in order to
stringently plan new experiments that are able to

identify hitherto unknown molecular interactions in
gene regulatory networks. We started from a large compendium of gene-expression experiments and inferred
878 putative regulatory interactions. By probing these
predicted interactions with independent knowledge from
phylogenetic and sequence data we were able to narrow
down the list of potential interactions to a smaller list of
109 validated interactions, which could be surveyed by
manual inspection. Of the 44 interactions contained in
this list, which were not yet present in RegulonDB 6.1,
we identified ten interactions where we could also identify a functional relationship between the regulator and

the target. Of these ten targets, five were already
reported in the literature. Thus, we narrowed down the
list of 878 interactions to five very likely targets that
should be verified by experiment. Finally, genome-wide
data analysis and modeling was the driving force to
design experiments for the discovery of the regulation of
lipA by PdhR. In consequence, our approach further
emphasizes the vital importance of the combination of
different bioinformatics methods for saving resources in
experimental work by in silico selection of most likely
candidates for the time-consuming and expensive procedure of experimental verification.

Methods
Directed information

Directed information can be interpreted as a directed
version of mutual information [7] that allows to measure the information flow between the time-series of the
expression of two genes. Given two random processes X
and Y of length N, the DTI I(XN®Yn) is defined as
N

(

) ∑I( X

I XN → Y N =

n

; Y n | Y n −1

n =2

)

(1)

n

where Y denotes (Y1,Y2, ..., Yn), that is, a segment of
the realization of the random sequence Y. DTI can be
interpreted as the mutual information between the time
course of X to the current point n and the current value
of Y given all values of Y up to the previous instant n 1. Since we are summing over all time-points we are
taking into account the relationship for every time point.
Equation 1 contains a conditional term, hence it can
be reformulated using the relationship I(XN,YN) = H(XN)
- H(XN|YN) between mutual information I(··;··), entropy
H(·) and conditional entropy H(·|·)[8]

where 0Yn-1 denotes the concatenation of 0 and Yn-1,
i.e., (0,Y1,Y2,...,Yn-1). This concatenation is equal to considering pairs of (X2,Y1), (X3,Y2),...,(Xn,Yn-1) of expression
values in which the X-values are shifted one time-step
into the future. In consequence, directed information
can also be understood as the mutual information
between X and Y subtracted by the information flow
between the time series of Y shifted one step and X.
Hence, by subtracting the causal (shifted) relationship
from Y to X, the causal dependency from X to Y
remains.
To evaluate the mutual information term in equation
(2), a b-spline estimator based on the work of [24] and
implemented by Boris Hayete of the Gardner Lab as
part of the CLR algorithm has been used. More details
on the implementation of the DTI estimator can be
found in Additional File 1: Supplemental Material S1.
Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR)

Having computed a DTI value, the significance of the
value needs to be determined. That is, the probability that
the DTI indicates a true dependency is to be assessed. The
complementary event, the null-hypothesis, is represented
by a DTI value that can be obtained from the expression
series of randomly chosen non-interacting genes. The
null-distribution of the DTI-values for a given context, i.e.,
the distribution of DTI values for two independent genes,
are not known. Hence they need to be estimated.
A method to perform this estimation is represented by
the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm
[5]. CLR is an extension of the relevance networks
approach [2] and has first been proposed by [4] for cluster-analysis. This approach makes explicit use of the
data to estimate the null-distribution. The assumption
underlying the approach is that there is no interaction
between most gene pairs. Hence, the null-distribution of
the DTIs can be obtained from the whole set of DTIs
determined from a potential regulator to all other genes.
Furthermore, when using CLR, we do not consider only
the value of the DTI within the set of potential regulators
of a target gene. Thus, two z-scores are computed. The
first is the z-score of the DTI within the null-distribution
of DTIs for all potential targets of a regulator and the second the z-score of the DTI within the null-distribution of
all potential regulators of a target gene. A cumulative zscore is computed as the quadratic mean of both z-scores.
For TF-gene interactions, these z-scores are computed
only within the matrix of TF-gene interactions. [5] in contrast computed z-scores within the full MI matrix and
then extracted all those concerning interactions where one
partner is a TF. More details on the implementation of the

An interaction is accepted if the cumulative z-score is
above a certain threshold. Similar to [5] this threshold is
determined using precision, which is defined as the fraction of known interactions within the set of inferred
interactions. However, since not all TFs and genes are
equally well studied, we use only a subsystem of the
inferred network that contains genes having known regulators or TFs having known targets as a reference.
Thus, for the computation of precision, edges corresponding to TFs or genes without known targets or regulators, respectively, are removed. Then, we determine
the known interactions by a comparison of inferred TF
- gene interactions to the interactions contained within
RegulonDB. Finally, we compute precision as the number of known interactions divided by the number of
inferred interactions in the reduced graph.
Sequence-based validation of TF - gene interactions

Inferred interactions are validated through independent evidence. This process helps to reduce the number of detected
interactions to a smaller set containing a higher fraction of
true interactions. A direct approach is to search for putative
binding sites of the regulator in the promoter region of the
target gene. This process is separated into two steps. First, a
putative binding site of the TF is searched in the promoter
region of the target gene. Then, this binding site is checked
for phylogenetical conservation.
The discovery of binding sites can be performed using
various approaches [11,25,26]. Here, the R-package
cosmo [11] was used. cosmo allows us to detect overrepresented motifs in DNA sequences. Binding sites are
detected by passing known binding sites of the TF along
with a stretch of 400 base pairs upstream of the start
site of the presumed target gene to cosmo (for more
details on the detection of binding sites see Additional
File 1: Supplemental Material S4).

In order to validate the predicted binding site its phylogenetical conservation over different species is
checked. Phylogenetically conserved regions upstream of
genes in ten proteobacterial genomes have been identified in [27,28]. The assumption that underlies this analysis is that TFBSs are under a positive selective
pressure and hence can be identified by comparing
stretches of upstream regions of orthologous genes in
several species. If a conserved region overlaps to more
than 50% with a putative binding site, the interaction is
accepted.
Data

Gene expression data has been obtained from the dataset E-coli-v4-Build-4 of the Many Microbe Microarray
Database [9] released in December 2007. Of the 203
experiments, 38 contain time-course data. Since DTI
requires equidistant time data, experiments for which
data of 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes are available were
chosen (Fig. 5). In some cases data for 120 and 180
minutes is additionally available. However, for a timespan of 90 minutes, M 3D contains 19 experiments,
which is larger than for other time spans. Using for
example data stretching over 120 minutes, fewer true
positive interactions are inferred when comparing to
the use of data stretching over 90 minutes (not
shown). In some cases, where time-point 90 minutes is
missing, but 120 minutes available, 90 minutes was
estimated using a spline interpolation [29]. An overview on the experiments used and the time-points
available is given in table 2. Data on known TF gene
interactions, a list of known and predicted TFs, position within the chromosome and arrangement within
operons were collected from RegulonDB release 6.1
[10]. Information on the function of gene products was
obtained from EcoCyc [30].

Experimental procedures
Plasmid construction

The pdhR gene was amplified by standard PCR with a
pair of primers, PdhR+ (3′-CTGCAGGAACTCATGGCCTACAG-5′) and PdhRhis- (3′-GAATTCCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGT GATTCTTTCGTTGCTCCAG-5′). The latter encodes a C-terminal Penta-His-tag
fused to the pdhR gene. Genomic DNA of the Escherichia coli K-12 derivative LJ110 [31] was used as template. The 797 bp PCR product was purified with DNA
Purification System (Promega), ligated into the pGEM®T vector (Promega) and sequenced (Scientific Research
and Development GmbH). Via a 5′ PstIrestriction site
provided by the primer PdhR+ and a 3′ PstIrestriction
site provided by the pGEM®-T vector, the pdhR-his gene
was cloned into the expression plasmid pTM30 [32]
yielding pTM30PdhRhis.
Purification of His-tagged PdhR protein

His-tagged PdhR was overexpressed in E. coli JM109 [33]
using the expression plasmid pTM30PdhRhis and purified using affinity chromatography as described previously [34]. Except that, for purification, frozen cells
were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH

DNA probes were either generated by annealing
equimolar amounts of fluorescence labeled primers
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) of the PdhR-binding site
(5′DY682-GCCGAAGTCAATTGGTCTTAC CAAT
TTCATGTCTGTG-3′ and 5′DY782-CACAGACATGAAATTGGTAAGACCAATTGACTT CGGC-3′) or
the Mlc-binding site (5′DY782-TTGGCAAATTATTTTACTCTGTGTAATAAATAAA GGGCG-3′ and 5′
DY682-CGCCCTTTATTTATTACACAGAGTAAAATAATTCAGTGCCAA-3′). The promotor region (507
bp from the initiation codon) of lipA was amplified by
PCR with fluorescence labeled primers (5′DY682ACTATCGACAACGCTGCGCATG-3′ and 5′DY782TAGCGTGCGTGTTCCAGTT GCG-3′). The PCR
product was purified with the DNA Purification System
(Promega). The gel shift assays were performed as
described previously [17] except that 0.1 pmol labeled
DNA probe was added to the binding reaction. The
PCR product of the lipA promotor region was used in a
dilution of 0.025 pmol per reaction. The binding buffer
and conditions were used as in [17], but 0.1 mg/ml buffer of heterologous herring sperma DNA was added.
After addition of 5 μl 50% glycerol to the binding reaction, the sample was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide
gel. After gel electrophoresis the labeled DNA was
detected by the Odyssey Scanner (Licor).
