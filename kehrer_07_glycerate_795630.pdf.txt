Abstract
Background: The presence of the branched Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway in two hyperthermophilic
Crenarchaea, the anaerobe Thermoproteus tenax and the aerobe Sulfolobus solfataricus, was suggested. However,
so far no enzymatic information of the non-phosphorylative ED branch and especially its key enzyme – glycerate
kinase – was available. In the T. tenax genome, a gene homolog with similarity to putative hydroxypyruvate
reductase/glycerate dehydrogenase and glycerate kinase was identified.
Results: The encoding gene was expressed in E. coli in a recombinant form, the gene product purified and the
glycerate kinase activity was confirmed by enzymatic studies. The enzyme was active as a monomer and catalyzed
the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of D-glycerate forming exclusively 2-phosphoglycerate. The enzyme was
specific for glycerate and highest activity was observed with ATP as phosphoryl donor and Mg2+ as divalent cation.
ATP could be partially replaced by GTP, CTP, TTP and UTP. The enzyme showed high affinity for D-glycerate
(Km 0.02 ± 0.01 mM, Vmax of 5.05 ± 0.52 U/mg protein) as well as ATP (Km of 0.03 ± 0.01 mM, Vmax of 4.41 ± 0.04
U/mg protein), although at higher glycerate concentrations, substrate inhibition was observed. Furthermore, the
enzyme was inhibited by its product ADP via competitive inhibition. Data bank searches revealed that archaeal
glycerate kinases are members of the MOFRL (multi-organism fragment with rich leucine) family, and homologs
are found in all three domains of life.
Conclusion: A re-evaluation of available genome sequence information as well as biochemical and phylogenetic
studies revealed the presence of the branched ED pathway as common route for sugar degradation in Archaea
that utilize the ED pathway. Detailed analyses including phylogenetic studies demonstrate the presence of three
distinct glycerate kinase classes in extant organisms that share no common origin. The affiliation of characterized
glycerate kinases with the different enzyme classes as well as their physiological/cellular function reveals no
association with particular pathways but a separate phylogenetic distribution. This work highlights the diversity
and complexity of the central carbohydrate metabolism. The data also support a key function of the conversion
of glycerate to 2- or 3-phosphoglycerate via glycerate kinase in funneling various substrates into the common EMP
pathway for catabolic and anabolic purposes.

Background
Modifications of the ED pathway, the semi-phosphorylative (sp) and the non-phosphorylative (np) ED pathway,
have been identified in all three forms of life [1]. Initial
biochemical studies in Archaea revealed the presence of
the npED pathway in (hyper)thermophiles [2-8] and the
spED pathway in halophiles [9]. However, a recent
approach that combined comparative genomics and biochemistry identified the presence of the spED pathway –
probably in addition to the npED pathway – in T. tenax
and S. solfataricus, suggesting the presence of a branched
ED pathway in these hyperthermophiles. [8,10-13]. The
hyperthermophilic anaerobe Thermoproteus tenax grows
optimally around 90°C, pH 5. This sulphur-dependent
Creanarchaeon is able to grow chemolithoautotrophically
on CO2 and H2, as well as chemoorganoheterotrophically
in the presence of various organic compounds such as
starch, glucose, malate and methanol [14,15]. Therefore,
T. tenax represents a perfect model organism for studying
the complexity of the central carbohydrate metabolism as
well as its regulation.

In the suggested branched ED pathway [10], glucose is
oxidized to gluconate via glucose dehydrogenase, and gluconate is dehydrated forming 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate
(KDG) by gluconate dehydratase (GAD). In the spED
branch, KDG is phosphorylated via KDG kinase, the key
enzyme of the spED branch, and the formed 2-keto-3deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) is cleaved into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate by the
action of the bifunctional KD(P)G aldolase, which is a key
player in both ED branches. GAP is processed via the common lower shunt of the EMP (Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas)
pathway, which is characterized by the presence of an
unusual irreversible non-phosphorylating GAP dehydrogenase and/or GAP oxidoreductase in hyperthermophiles.
These enzymes substitute for the anabolic enzyme couple
NADP+-dependent GAP dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase [11,16-18]. In the npED branch,
KD(P)G aldolase cleaves KDG into pyruvate and glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde is further oxidized to form glycerate either by a NAD(P)+-dependent glyceraldehyde
dehydrogenase [3,19,20] or by a ferredoxin-dependent
glyceraldehyde oxidoreductase [5,21-23]. Glycerate is
phosphorylated via glycerate kinase, the key enzyme of
the npED branch, forming 2-phosphoglycerate. 2-Phosphoglycerate then enters the common lower shunt of the
EMP pathway yielding a second molecule of pyruvate by
the action of enolase and pyruvate kinase (Fig. 1).
Enzymes of the common ED shunt (glucose dehydrogenase [6,10,24,25], gluconate dehydratase [10,26,27] and
KD(P)G aldolase [24,28,10]) as well as the spED branch
(KDG kinase [10,29]) have been characterized from the
hyperthermophilic Archaea T. tenax and S. solfataricus.

which is either phosphorylated and cleaved forming pyruvate
and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) in the semi-phosphorylative ED branch (left side) or directly cleaved forming
pyruvate and glyceraldehyde in the non-phosphorylative
branch (right side). Enzyme key: 1, glucose dehydrogenase; 2,
gluconate dehydratase (GAD); 3, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate
(KDG) kinase; 4, 2-keto-3-deoxy-(6-phospho)gluconate

mutase; 7, enolase; 8, pyruvate kinase; 9, aldehyde dehydrogenase or aldehyde oxidoreductase; 10, glycerate kinase.

Interestingly, these enzymes were shown to be promiscuous for glucose and galactose catabolism in S. solfataricus
[24-26,28,29], which relies on the ED pathway as only
route for sugar degradation. In contrast, the pathway
seems to be specific for glucose and is active in addition to
the EMP variant in T. tenax [6,10]. Glyceraldehyde oxidoreductase activity has been reported in cell extracts of T.
tenax [5]. However, no information is currently available
for the key enzyme of the npED branch, glycerate kinase,
in T. tenax and hyperthermophilic Archaea in general.

Studies addressing this metabolic key reaction are
expected to reveal some new important insights into the
regulation and the physiological role of the branched ED
pathway.
Glycerate kinases have been characterized from all
domains of life: Bacteria, Eukarya and Archaea. In general,
two distinct classes of glycerate kinases were identified: 3phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and 2-phoshoglycerate (2-PG)
forming glycerate kinases. 3-PG forming enzymes were
characterized for example in plants, fungi and different
heterotrophic bacteria. 2-PG forming glycerate kinases, on
the other hand, were identified and examined in animals
and methylotrophic bacteria. Recently, the 2-PG forming
glycerate kinases of the thermoacidophilic Euryarchaea
Picrophilus torridus and Thermoplasma acidophilum were
characterized and their function as key enzyme of the
npED pathway in thermophiles was reported [30,32].
However, up to now little attention was given to the phylogenetic affiliation of the enzymes. Initial phylogenetic
analyses published previously indicate the presence of
three glycerate kinase families or groups and wrongly suggest that they share a common origin [31,32].
In order to confirm the presence of the branched ED pathway in T. tenax and beyond that in other hyperthermophilic Archaea and in order to study this pathway's
regulation, the gene encoding the putative glycerate
kinase was cloned and the enzymatic and regulatory properties of the gene product were characterized. Here we
describe the first hyperthermophilic archaeal glycerate
kinase, the enzyme of Thermoproteus tenax. Moreover, new
data from comparative genomics analyses as well as available biochemical information indicate a much broader
distribution of the branched ED pathway in Archaea than
previously assumed. Finally, the evolution of glycerate
kinases was re-evaluated revealing the presence of three
independent glycerate kinase classes that share no common origin: i) the glycerate kinase class I (GK I), ii) the
glycerate kinase class II (GK II, MOFRL family) as well as
iii) a novel glycerate kinase family related to the phosphoribulokinase/uridine kinase family, here named glycerate kinase class III (GK III). The affiliation of enzymes
with the different enzyme classes, their phylogenetic distribution as well as their physiological function are discussed. This study confirms the complexity and mosaic
nature of the central carbohydrate metabolic pathways in
extant organisms.

Results and discussion
Combined genomics and biochemical studies suggested
the presence of the branched ED pathway in Thermoproteus
tenax [10]. In the genome of T. tenax, one gene homolog
with high similarity to predicted glycerate kinases (COG
2379, EC 2.7.1.31) and hydroxypyruvate reductases (glyc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/301

erate dehydrogenases) (COG 2379, EC 1.1.1.29 (NADH),
EC1.1.1.81 (NAD(P)H)) was identified [8]. In order to
confirm the predicted glycerate kinase activity and thus
the presence of the branched ED pathway in T. tenax and
to gain first insights into its regulation as well as its physiological role, the encoding gene was expressed as a
recombinant protein in E. coli, purified and characterized.
Cloning of the garK gene, expression and purification of
the glycerate kinase from T. tenax
The gene encoding the putative glycerate kinase/hydroxypyruvate reductase from T. tenax (garK, AJ621354)
revealed an open reading frame of 1197 bp coding for a
polypeptide of 398 amino acids. The glycerate kinase/
hydroxypyruvate reductase homolog revealed significant
overall similarity with the recently characterized glycerate
kinase of the thermoacidophile P. torridus, (27% identity,
Blastp search) as well as numerous "annotated" glycerate
kinases and hydroxypyruvate reductases or glycerate dehydrogenases in all three domains of life. The garK gene was
cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the pET
expression vector system. The recombinant enzyme was
enriched from E. coli crude extract by heat precipitation at
80°C for 30 minutes. Further purification was achieved by
Q-sepharose, phenyl sepharose and gel filtration (Fig. 2).
From 10 g wet cells of recombinant E. coli, 2.72 mg of
homogenous glycerate kinase with a specific activity of 4.6
U/mg protein was recovered.

The glycerate kinase of T. tenax migrated as a single band
on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa
(Fig. 2), corresponding well to the calculated mass of 42.4
kDa. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200
prep grade column and revealed 48.3 ± 1.1 kDa, indicating a monomeric structure for the glycerate kinase of T.
tenax. A monomeric structure was also reported for the
characterized Hyphomicrobioum methylovorum GM2 glycerate kinase [33] and the enzyme of T. acidophilum [30].
Interestingly, biochemical data suggest a dimeric structure
for the glycerate kinase of P. torridus as well as Thermotoga
maritima [32,34], although analysis of the crystallographic
packing of the T. maritima enzyme (TM1585) indicates a
monomeric structure [34]. Also many plant enzymes (e.g.
Brassica campestris [35], spinach leaf [36]), which, however, as discussed later are members of a different glycerate
kinase class, exhibit a monomeric structure.
Enzymatic and regulatory properties of the glycerate
kinase from T. tenax
Glycerate kinase activity was determined in a discontinuous assay at 70°C by coupling the formation of 2-phosphoglycerate with NADH oxidation in the presence of
enolase, pyruvate kinase and L-lactate dehydrogenase.
Glycerate kinase catalyzed the ATP-dependent phosphor-

ylation of D-glycerate yielding 2-phosphoglycerate. No
formation of 3-phosphoglycerate was observed in
response to the addition of phoshoglycerate mutase to the
assay. The enzyme showed activity only in the presence of
ATP and Mg2+. No activity was detected in controls without protein or without the (co-)substrates D-glycerate,
ATP or both D-glycerate and ATP. The enzyme showed no
hydroxypyruvate reductase activity either in the presence
of NADH + H+ or NADPH + H+.
The 2-glycerate kinase activity was measured in the presence of different substrate and co-substrate concentrations. Strikingly, the enzyme was inhibited at higher
glycerate concentrations (Fig. 3) and apparent Km- and
Vmax-values for glycerate (0.02 ± 0.01 mM, 5.05 ± 0.52 U/
mg protein, D-glycerate at concentrations below 0.3 mM)
and for ATP (Km of 0.03 ± 0.01 mM, Vmax of 4.41 ± 0.04 U/
mg protein) at 70°C were estimated. No substrate inhibition was observed for the enzymes of P. torridus, T. acidophilum, and H. methylovorum. As shown in Table 1, the T.

tenax enzyme exhibits a higher substrate affinity, however,
the specific activity is significantly reduced in comparison
to the glycerate kinases of P. torridus and H. methylovorum.
This is reflected in an about 6 or 7-fold (glycerate) and 5
or 9-fold (ATP) reduced catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km-values, Tab. 1) of the hyperthermophilic enzyme compared
to P. torridus and H. methylovorum, respectively. The glycerate kinase of T. acidophilum shows a similar catalytic efficiency for glycerate, only for ATP it is slightly (2.3-fold)
increased.
The ability of the T. tenax glycerate kinase to phosphorylate other compounds than D-glycerate was tested in a
discontinous assay at 70°C by monitoring the formation
of ADP from the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of substrate via pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The
following compounds were substituted for D-glycerate:
the stereoisomer L-glycerate, sugar acids (galactonate, gluconate, malate, pyruvate, lactate), glyceraldehyde, glycerol, serine and phosphorylated intermediates (3-

phosphoglycerate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP)).
The enzyme is absolutely specific for glycerate as phosphoryl acceptor. Like the enzymes of P. torridus [32], H.
methylovorum [33] and plant [37] glycerate kinases
described so far, the enzyme showed higher activity with
D-glycerate (100%) and only low activity with L-glycerate
(30%) (Tab. 1).
The T. tenax glycerate kinase has a temperature optimum
at 90°C (100% activity), correlating well with its growth
optimum (around 90°C). At 70°C only 55% and at 50°C
only 15% residual activity were observed.
The specificity of the enzyme for phosphoryl donors (5
mM) was tested for ATP, CTP, GTP, TTP, UTP, ADP as well
as PPi and polyphosphates (P3, P5 and P25). The enzyme
exhibited highest activity with ATP, although ATP could
be partially replaced by CTP, GTP, TTP and UTP (16%,
20%, 16% and 10% activity, respectively). No activity was
observed with ADP, PPi and polyphosphates.
The glycerate kinase of T. tenax required divalent metal
ions for activity and the highest activity was observed in

tenax. The glycerate kinase activity was determined in a discontinuous assay at 70°C by coupling the formation of 2phosphoglycerate with NADH oxidation via enolase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The dependence of
the specific enzyme activity on the glycerate concentration is
shown. The enzyme is inhibited at higher glycerate concentrations. The insert shows the linear transformation according to Hanes for glycerate concentrations up to 0.3 mM.

the presence of 20 mM Mg2+. Activity was inhibited by the
addition of EDTA (40 mM). Co2+, Mn2+ and Ni2+ (all 5
mM) and Ca2+ (2 mM) could partially replace Mg2+ (56%,
59%, 30% and 15% activity, respectively). No activity was
detected in the presence of Cu2+ and Fe2+ at 0.2, 2, 5 and
20 mM. Thus, in respect of cosubstrate specificity and
dependence on metal ions, the enzyme of T. tenax resembles the enzymes of P. torridus and H. methylovorum and
plant glycerate kinases described previously [32,33,38]
(Tab. 1). Monovalent ions (K+ and NH4+), which were
reported to activate the H. methylovorum glycerate kinase
[33], showed no effect on the T. tenax and P. torridus
enzyme.
Effector studies were performed in the presence of nonsaturating concentrations of D-glycerate (50 µM) and
non-saturating (50 µM) and saturating (5 mM) concentrations of ATP. The reaction rate of T. tenax glycerate kinase
showed no significant alteration by the following intermediates (1 and 10 mM): AMP, intermediates of the EMP
pathway (glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6bisphosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone
phosphate, GAP, 3-phosphoglycerate, lactate), the
branched ED pathway (galactonate, gluconate, KDG), glycogen metabolism (glucose 1-phosphate) and the citric

acid cycle (citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate,
fumarate, malate). The reaction product ADP showed an
inhibitory effect on the glycerate kinase activity. In the
presence of non-saturating concentrations of ATP, the
inhibition by ADP was much higher suggesting competitve inhibition (non-saturating ATP: 76%, 39.1%,
8.2% and saturating ATP: 93.2%, 87.3%, 42% activity of
control at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mM ADP,
respectively; the average over two independent measurements is given). A similar inhibition by ADP is also
reported for the H. methylovorum enzyme [33]. For the P.
torridus and T. acidophilum enzyme respective studies were
not performed [32].
In summary, the gene product of the garK gene possesses
exclusively 2-glycerate kinase activity, and no 3-glycerate
kinase or hydroxypyruvate reductase activity was detected.
The first characterized archaeal hyperthermophilic
enzyme exhibits common features with the well characterized enzymes of P. torridus, T. acidophilum and H. methylovorum such as (co)substrate specificity and metal ion
dependence. At the same time, it also shows some unique
characteristics such as its inhibition by glycerate and its
hyperthermophilic properties (Tab. 1). The physiological

significance of the inhibition by glycerate is unknown,
since information about the cellular concentrations of
glycerate in T. tenax is currently unavailable. The key
enzyme of the non-phosphorylative branch of the ED
pathway in T. tenax seems to be no subject of broad regulatory control, at least for the effectors tested, but seems to
be regulated by the energy charge of the cell probably via
competitve (product) inhibition by ADP.
Distribution of the branched ED pathway in Archaea
New comparative genomics based data [12,13] and available biochemical information revealed a much broader
distribution of the branched pathway in Archaea than previously assumed (Tab. 2). As supported by biochemical
and phylogenetic data, the branched ED pathway is not
only present in hyperthermophilic Archaea (e.g. T. tenax,
Sulfolobales) but represents the pathway for sugar degradation in thermoacidophilic Archaea (e.g. Thermoplasmatales) and Haloarchaea, with the only exception of
Halobacterium sp. NRC-1.

In thermoacidophiles the specific enzymes of the npED
branch glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (P. torridus [19], T.
acidophilum [19,39]) as well as the glycerate kinase (P. tor-

ridus [32], T. acidophilum [30]) have been characterized
recently. In addition, the presence of the spED branch was
demonstrated by the identification of a novel KDG kinase
in T. acidophilum [39], which is not related to the characterized enzymes of T. tenax and S. solfataricus (ribokinaselike superfamily, pfkB family carbohydrate kinase,
PF00294), but is a member of the BadF/BadG/BcrA/BcrD
ATPase family (PF01869). Homologs of the new KDG
kinase were identified in all members of the Thermoplasmatales with available genome sequence information. In
Haloarchaea the presence of glycerate kinase homologs in
Haloarcula marismortui, Haloquadratum walsbyi and
Natronomonas pharaonis suggests the presence of the
branched ED pathway rather than the assumed spED
pathway. Therefore the branched ED pathway – rather
than the semi- or non-phosphorylative ED pathway –
seems to be common for sugar degradation in Archaea
that utilize the ED pathway.
Phylogenetic analyses
Glycerat kinase class II (MOFRL family)
Data bank searches (BlastX, BlastP) revealed sequences
homologous to the glycerate kinase of T. tenax in all three
domains of life: Bacteria, Eukarya and Archaea. In
Archaea, glycerate kinase homologs were identified in
about half (19 of 35) of the sequenced genomes (Tab. 2,
Fig. 4, Fig. 6). Beside Archaea that utilize the ED pathway
for sugar degradation (Tab. 2) homologs were also identified in the genomes of Aeropyrum pernix (APE0996), Pyrobaculum aerophilum (PAE1309), Thermofilum pendens
(TPE0207), Metallosphaera sedula (MSED0161) and in
Thermococcales (Pyrococcus horikoshii (PHO0495), P.
abyssi (PAB1021), P. furiosus (PFU0024), Thermococcus
kodakarensis (TKO1893)). No glycerate kinase homologs
were identified in the genomes of Halobacterium sp. NRC1, Pyrobaculum islandicum, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Nanoarchaeum equitans and Methanogens (Methanocaldococcus
jannaschii, Methanococcoides burtonii, Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanoculleus marisnigri, Methanopyrus kandleri,
Methanosaeta thermophila, Methanosarcina acetivorans, M.
barkeri, M. mazei, Methanosphaera stadtmanae, Methanospirillum hungatei, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus).

Whereas all archaeal and eukaryal organisms harbor only
one gene encoding glycerate kinase, paralogous genes that
originated in gene duplications and/or horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) were found in several bacteria (e.g. Ralstonia solanacearum, Sinorhizobium meliloti (Fig. 7)). All
homologs are characterized by the conserved C-terminal
MORFL (multi-organism fragment with rich leucine)
domain (residues 304–410 of the glycerate kinase of T.
maritima, TM1585). For the identification of conserved
amino acid patterns sequences of all identified members
of class II glycerate kinases (MOFRL family) were analyzed
by PRATT 2.1 [40,41] revealing one conserved motif (D-

X(0,2)-G-X(0,1)-D-[GP]-X(4)-[APS]-[ACDGST] (residues
322–332 of the T. tenax glycerate kinase: DGLDGNTGVAG).
In order to analyze the phylogenetic relationship between
the GK II members, we aligned 135 sequences. An overview of their relationships is shown in form of a cartoon
(Fig. 5). From this group 56 sequences were selected,
which adequately represent the original diversity. After
the elimination of highly divergent regions, a total of 169
amino acid residues were used for the construction of the
phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 6. Phylogenetic analyses
based on Maximum Likelihood resulted in a complex tree
topology with three major clades. Bootstrap analyses
show a low support for all basal branches.
Clade I consists essentially of archaeal homologs with a
few basal branching bacteria. Within this group several
lineages display a pronounced acceleration, namely the
Thermoplasmatales and the Sulfolobales together with
Thermoproteus. More precisely, the archaeal clade I is
divided in two lineages: one with euryarchaeal (Thermoplasmatales), crenarchaeal as well as two bacterial
homologs (Candidatus kuenenia, Syntrophus aciditrophicus)
and a second lineage with euryarchaeal (Pyrococcus sp.)
and again two bacterial homologs(T. maritima, Alkaliphilus metalliredigenes).
The second clade consists exclusively of animals. It represents the only basal branch that is weakly supported. The
clade II is divided in a major group of vertebrates, an echinoderm and several insects, which are separated from the
very fast-evolving nematodes. Since it is highly likely that
these bilaterian animals form a monophyletic group, this
observation reveals the limited resolving power of the
data set and supports the view that the other groups are
substantially older than the animals.
The third clade consists almost exclusively of bacterial
sequences and represents the major group of bacterial
homologs. However, it includes two haloarchaeal
sequences possibly due to a HGT event with a high GCGram positive. This group represents a fair amount of the
bacterial diversity (ten deeply branching lineages/phyla).
Nevertheless, the great majority of the sequenced bacterial
genomes do not contain homologous sequences.
The presence of bacterial and archaeal sequences in the
first clade can be interpreted in two different ways. Either
there was an early gene duplication event that created two
copies in Archaea and Bacteria and subsequently these
copies were lost in most lineages, or this gene was originally present in Archaea and at least two HGT events from
Archaea to Bacteria created the current distribution. The
phylogenetic tree contains representatives of all three

domains of life. Consequently, it seems likely that the
glycerate kinase is truly universal. This notion is supported by the fact that, despite the presence of possible
HGT events at a later time, the three domains are essentially discrete. One of the lineage-specific HGT events is
found in the case of the high GC-Gram positive Rubrobacter xylanophilus. This bacterium likely represents the
donor lineage (Clade III) for the glycerate kinase enzymes
present in the two extreme halophilic Archaea Haloarcula
marismortui and Natronomonas pharaonis (Euryarchaea).
No homolog was identified in the closely related Halobacterium NRC-1 genome. Further evidence for HGT events
between Archaea and Bacteria in the context of thermoadaptation was demonstrated for the hyperthermophile T.
maritima [42].
Within the bacterial clade, there is a group that is limited
to more closely related proteobacterial sequences (α-, β-,
γ-group). The Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree of
this group is shown in Fig 7. It is based on 56 sequences
and 374 amino acid residues. Since these sequences are
much closer related, there are about two times the number
of positions that can be used in the phylogenetic analyses.
The proteobacterial sequences are divided in two basic
lineages. One of them consists exclusively of α-Proteobac-

teria and a mixed group of α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria. In
Bacteria – in contrast to Eukarya and Archaea – several
species were identified with two or multiple glycerate
kinase isoenzymes, representing examples of early (e.g.
Ralstonia solanacearum) or more recent gene duplications
(e.g. Sinorhizobium meliloti). The mosaic picture in extant
Proteobacteria might therefore represent the result of a
complex mixture of gene duplications with subsequent
differential losses and/or potential lateral gene transfer
elements.
Three distinct glycerate kinase classes
In contrast to previous reports [31,32], PSI Blast analyses
revealed that members of the glycerate kinase class II
(MOFRL family) show no similarity to members either of
the bacterial glycerate kinase class I (GK I) or the recently
identified novel kinase family (here named glycerate
kinase class III, GK III) [31]. Therefore, known glycerate
kinases divide in three distinct, unrelated glycerate kinase
classes and seem to represent examples of independent
(non-homologous) functional evolution. Interestingly,
PSI Blast analyses of class III glycerate kinases revealed a
diverse superfamily with enzymes that catalyze substantially different enzyme reactions such as glycerate kinase,
phosphoribulokinase (EC 2.7.1.19), panthotenate kinase
(EC 2.7.1.33), uridine kinase (EC 2.7.1.48) and are
involved in cell division (cell division recognition particle). These data suggest that class III glycerate kinases are
members of the diverse phosphoribulokinase/uridine
kinase family (PF00485, nucleoside/nucleotide kinase
(NK) superfamily cd02019) within the P-loop kinases,
which phosphorylate all kind of different substrates [43].

The crystal structures of three glycerate kinases, one GK
class I (Neisseria meningitidis (PDB|1to6)) and two GKs
class II (MOFRL family, Pyrococcus horikoshii (PH0495;
PDB|1x3l, T. martima (TM1585, PDB|2b8n), [34]) are
established. As reported previously by Schwarzenbacher
et al. [34] structural similarity search revealed no significant structural similarity between the two glycerate kinase
structures of N. meningitides (class I) and T. maritima (class
II). So far no glycerate kinase class III structure is available.
However, several structures of different P-loop kinases
have been established, which are structurally unrelated to
class I or II glycerate kinases. Therefore, the glycerate
kinases of A. thaliana and S. cerevisiae represent a third
class of glycerate kinases. In summary available protein
structures reveal three different structural classes of glycerate kinases, which are structurally unrelated and thus evolutionarily distinct.
Physiological function and affiliation of characterized
enzymes with the three different glycerate kinase classes
The identification of three distinct glycerate kinase classes
raises questions about the affiliation of previously charac-

terized enzymes with the different enzyme classes and
more generally about the distribution and physiological
function in extant organisms (Tab. 3, Fig. 8). Respective
analyses remain difficult since many biochemical studies
go back to the 1950–1970s and often the genes encoding
these enzymes were not identified.
Members of the class II glycerate kinases (MOFRL family,
PF05161; GckA/TtuD-like family (PDB: 1o0u, SCOP))
were identified in all three domains of life (19 Archaea, 75
Bacteria, 16 Eukarya; IPR 007835). They represent the
only glycerate kinases identified in Archaea and animals
(Metazoa; vertebrates, echinoderm, insects, nematodes).
In Bacteria a preferred presence in α-, γ- and δ-Proteobacteria is observed. The glycerate kinase of T. tenax, the first
characterized archaeal hyperthermophilic enzyme (this
study), and of the thermoacidophiles P. torridus [32] and
T. acidophilum [30] represent the only archaeal enzymes
characterized so far. Several bacterial and eukaryal members have been characterized previously, although their
affiliation with a new enzyme classes was not considered.
In Bacteria, class II glycerate kinase has been identified in
several facultative methylotrophes, where the enzyme is a

constituent of the serine cycle for conversion of C1-compounds (e.g. methane, methanol) in C3-compounds.
Glycerate kinases of Methylobacterium extorquens [44] and
H. methylovorum GM2 [33] were examined and shown to
form 2-phosphoglycerate. The serine pathway and significant levels of glycerate-2-kinase were also reported in
Pseudomonas species grown on methanol as well as oxalate
[45-47].
In different strains of Agrobacterium vitis (AB3, AB4), a
grapevine pathogen, two plasmid-encoded GK II
homologs (ttuD4 (pTrAB4), ttuD3 (pTrAB3)) were identified. The genes are part of the plasmid-encoded tartrate
utilization gene clusters. Using a mutational approach,
hydroxypyruvate reductase activity was suggested
although the catalyzed reaction was unknown [48,49].
The tartrate utilization pathway shares common reactions
with the serine cycle (conversion of hydroxypyruvate via
2-phosphoglycerate to pyruvate). From the absence of
similarities of TtuD to known hydroxypyruvate reductases
and the high similarity to glycerate kinase it was already
previously suggested that the enzyme encodes glycerate
kinase rather than hydroxypyruvate reductase [44]. Therefore, in contrast to annotations found in many genome

Members of the classical class I glycerate kinase (GK I)
(Pfam 02595; glycerate kinase I (PDB: 1to6, SCOP)) represent the major glycerate kinase in Bacteria and few
Eukarya (220 Bacteria, 7 Eukarya (Entamoeba histolytica
(2), Trypanosoma cruzi (2), Fusarium graminearum, Aspergillus nidulans, Dictyostelium discoideum; IPR004381). No
homolog was identified in Archaea and animals and only
few homologs in α-, and δ-Proteobacteria. However,
many homologs were found in β- and γ-Proteobacteria as
well as low- and high-GC Gram positives. This is nicely
complementary since there are almost no Gram positives
that harbor class II glycerate kinases (MOFRL enzyme
family), whereas the α-, and δ-Proteobacteria do contain
predominantly members of class II glycerate kinases.

GK II

Figure role of glycerate kinase in carbohydrate metabolism
The key8
The key role of glycerate kinase in carbohydrate
metabolism. Current knowledge about the physiological
function of glycerate kinases of the different glycerate kinase
classes in extant living organisms is shown (according to
Table 3). The different carbon sources/pathways and organisms are boxed and the color indicates the involvement of
glycerate kinases of the three different glycerate kinase
classes (class II GK (MOFRL family), white; class I GK, light
grey; class III GK, dark grey) in the respective metabolic
pathway. The formation of 2- or 3-phosphoglycerate is indicated by the name of the enzyme family indicated below the
compounds. The suggested function of the class I and class II
(MOFRL family) glycerate kinases in Pseudomonas fluorescens
and P. putida is indicated by dashed lines.
sequencing projects and data banks (COG, SCOP and
Pfam), so far only glycerate kinases and no hydroxypyruvate reductases or glycerate dehydrogenases were identified as members of class II glycerate kinases (MOFRL
family).
In animals, class II glycerate kinase is the key enzyme for
gluconeogenesis from serine and is involved in fructose
metabolism [50,51]. Glycerate kinases have been characterized in great detail from different organisms and organs
(e.g. rat liver, kidney cortex [52,53]) and all enzymes characterized so far were shown to be specific for 2-phosphoglycerate formation. Therefore, all class II glycerate
kinases (MOFRL family) characterized until now seem to
be specific for 2-phophoglycerate formation.

Glycerate kinases have been characterized from different
bacterial sources. In E. coli (K12) two different glycerate
kinases were identified, which are subject to independent
biosynthetic regulation [54]. In more recent studies it was
shown that the two glycerate kinases are members of the
GK I family (class). The two encoding genes were identified in conserved gene clusters and their involvement in
allantoin metabolism (purine degradation via glyoxylate
and the glycerate pathway; GK-1, glxK gene, [55]) and glucarate and galactarate utilization (GK-2, gclK gene, [56])
was demonstrated. Both pathways share the conversion of
tartronate semialdehyde (TSA) catalyzed by TSA reductase
to glycerate and the phosphorylation via glycerate kinase
(Fig. 8). Whereas the enzyme involved in sugar acid degradation forms 2-phosphoglycerate, the enzyme of the
glycerate pathway forms 3-phosphoglycerate. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that also the Flavobacterium sp.
glycerate kinase (Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis MED217,
EAQ51383), which was purified from ethylene glycol
grown cells and uses the glycerate pathway for conversion
to pyruvate via 2-phosphoglycerate [57], is a member of
this enzyme family. Therefore, the currently characterized
enzymes of the class I glycerate kinases form either 2- or
3-phosphoglycerate.
Members of a novel third glycerate kinase class (named
GK class III here) were reported recently (IPR 006083,
PF00485, COG 4240 predicted kinases; P-loop-containing NTP hydrolases (PDB: 1a7j, SCOP)) [31]. Detailed
phylogenetic analysis revealed a more general distribution
in cyanobacteria (e.g. most Synechococcus sp., Prochlorococcus marinus) as well as in proteobacteria, especially of the
γ-group (e.g. Nitrosococcus oceanii, Pseudoalteromonas tunicate) than reported previously (data not shown). Therefore, this enzyme family seems to occur in fungi, plant
and few bacteria (i.e. most cyanobacteria and few γ-proteobacteria). Some of the sequences in the databanks were
annotated as phosphoribulokinase/uridine kinase due to
the presence of the PRK/UK domain (IPR 006083, Pfam
00485, amino acid 210–425 A. thaliana) and their affilia-

tion with the diverse phosphoribulokinase/uridine kinase
family (see above). Interestingly, in cyanobacteria two
Synechococcus strains (JA-2-3B'a (ABD02569), JA-3-3Ab
(ABC99586)) as well as Synechocystis sp. Pcc6803
(P73408) possess only a class I glycerate kinase homolog.
The enzymes of Arabidopsis thaliana (At1g80380) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NP_011721) were shown to possess
glycerate kinase activity and were characterized [31]. Both
enzymes are specific for glycerate and form 3-phosphoglycerate. Many plant enzymes were characterized in
great detail previously, but the encoding genes were not
identified [31,35-38]. In plants, glycerate kinase plays an
important role in the photorespiratory C-2 cycle, which
compensates for the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) and
thus serves as carbon recovery system reconverting 2phosphoglycolate to 3-phosphoglycerate [31]. The C-2
cycle involves at least ten reaction steps localized in different cell organelles (chloroplast, peroxisome, mitochondria). The final step of glycerate phosphorylation is
performed in the chloroplast.
In fungi, a role of glycerate kinase was reported in Neurospora crassa grown on glycerol [58], which is metabolized by a phosphorylative pathway via glycerol kinase
and an oxidative pathway via NADP+-glycerol dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase and glycerate kinase.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed only one homolog of the
class III glycerate kinases in Neurospora crassa
(EAA32802). The function in Bacteria (Cyanobacteria and
Proteobacteria) remains unclear and a role in carbon
metabolism, as reported for fungi [58], or in photorespiration, as suggested for complex cyanobacteria [31], might
be possible.
In summary, phylogenetic analyses of class II (MOFRL),
class I and class III glycerate kinases revealed a separated
distribution: (i) class II members in Archaea, animals and
Bacteria, especially α-, β- and γ-Proteobacteria, (ii) class I
members in Bacteria (especially Gram positives and βand γ-Proteobacteria, but only few Cyanobacteria) and
(iii) members of class III glycerate kinases in plants, fungi,
Cyanobacteria and few Proteobacteria (many of the γgroup). Interestingly, no organism harbors members of all
three glycerate kinase classes and only very few comprise
members of two different glycerate kinase classes. Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. putida harbor a class II glycerate
kinase (MOFRL) homolog as well as the class I glycerate
kinase. In addition, few fungi (Coccidioides immintis,
Aspergillus nidulans, Giberella zeae) comprise class I and
class III glycerate kinase homologs. The physiological role
of the different glycerate kinase homologs is still unclear.
For the facultatively methylotrophic Pseudomonas species
a putative role of the GK class II homolog in C1-fixation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/301

as well as glyoxylate metabolism and for the GK class I
homolog in sugar/sugar acid degradation might be suggested [45-47] (Tab. 3, Fig. 8). This is supported by the
organization of the GK class II gene homolog (PFL1595)
in a gene cluster comprising genes encoding pyruvate
kinase (PFL1594), tartronate semialdehyde reductase
(TSAR)
(PFL1596),
hydroxypyruvate
isomerase
(PFL1597) and glyoxylate carboligase (tartronate-semialdehyde synthase) (PFL1598) in Pseudomonas fluorescens
(strain Pfo-1 and Pf-5) as well as P. putida. A similar coorganisation of the class II glycerate kinase (MOFRL family) and pyruvate kinase is also reported in M. extorquens
and A. vitis and a function in the generation of pyruvate/
acetyl-CoA for anabolic purposes is discussed [44]. The
GK class I gene homolog (PFL2908) is found in a gene
cluster with a putative transcriptional regulator involved
in sugar acid recognition (PFL2909), a putative 2hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (PFL2904) and a putative
PfkB family carbohydrate kinase (putative KDG kinase;
PFL2902).
As shown in Fig. 8, there seems to be no correlation
between the biochemical function or pathway and the
enzyme involved from the metabolic point of view. For
example, sugar acids (e.g. glucarate) are degraded in E. coli
via a class I glycerate kinase and in T. tenax glucose degradation via gluconate is performed by a member of class II
glycerate kinases. However, these analyses demonstrate
that glycerate is a key metabolite in the central carbohydrate metabolism. Glycerate is formed during the degradation of various compounds such as amino acids
(serine), sugars (glucose, fructose), sugar acids (glucarate,
oxalate, tartrate), glycerol, as well as during the synthesis
of C-3 compounds from C-1 (methane, methanol) and C2 (2-phosphoglycolate) compounds. The different metabolic routes merge at the level of the two isomers hydroxypyruvate and tartronate-semialdehyde as well as
glyceraldehyde, which are converted to glycerate via redox
reactions. Therefore, the conversion of glycerate to 2- or 3phosphoglycerate by glycerate kinases of the three different enzyme classes is the key reaction for channeling a
great variety of intermediates into the EMP pathway,
which serves as funnel for catabolic as well as anabolic
purposes. So far, not much is known about the metabolism of carbohydrates other than glucose, galactose and
fructose in Archaea. These findings suggest that Archaea
share with organisms from other domains of life the common concept that alternative metabolic routes channel
into the EMP pathway via the glycerate kinase reaction.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, this report contains the first characterization of a hyperthermophilic archaeal glycerate kinase.
The re-evaluation of available archaeal genome sequence
information revealed that the branched Entner-Doudor-

off (ED) pathway, rather than the suggested non- or semiphosphorylative ED pathway, is common for sugar degradation in Archaea that utilize the ED pathway (with the
only exception of Halobacterium spec. NRC-1). Archaeal
glycerate kinases are members of the MOFRL (multiorganism fragment with rich leucine) family and in contrast to many current annotations found, so far no hydroxypyruvate reductases or glycerate dehydrogenases were
identified as members of this enzyme family. Detailed
phylogenetic studies demonstrated the presence of three
distinct glycerate kinase classes that share no common origin, and are distributed separately in extant organisms.
The affiliation of characterized glycerate kinases with the
three different enzyme classes as well as their physiological function gives no evidence to the association with particular pathways. However, our results highlight the key
function of glycerate kinase in funneling various substrates into the common EMP pathway for catabolic and
anabolic purposes.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions
Cultures of T. tenax (DSM 2078, [14] were grown as
reported previously [17]. E. coli strains DH5α (Life Technologies), BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for cloning and expression studies were grown under standard conditions [59]
following the instructions of the manufacturer.
(Bio)chemicals and enzymes
If not indicated otherwise, (bio)chemicals and enzymes
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, VWR International
or Roche Diagnostics GmbH in analytical grade. D- and LGlycerate was purchased from Sigma.
Heterologous expression
For heterologous expression, the pET vector system (pET24a, Novagen) was used. The garK gene coding for the
putative glycerate kinase, (TTX_0788, AJ 621345) was
cloned into pET-24a via two new restriction sites (NdeI
and EcoRI) intoduced by PCR mutagenesis with the
primer
set
Ttx-garK-pETf
5'GTTGCAAGTCGACTACCATATGATAG3' and Ttx-garKpETrev 5'TATACTTGGAATTCCTCCTCC3'. PCR mutagenesis was performed using Pfu polymerase (Fermentas) and
genomic DNA from T. tenax as template. The sequence of
the cloned gene was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of
both strands. Expression of the recombinant enzyme in E.
coli BL21(DE3) was performed following the instructions
of the manufacturer (Novagen).
Protein purification
Recombinant E. coli cells (10 g wet weight) were suspended in 20 ml of 100 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.0) containing 7.5 mM dithiothreitol (buffer A) and passed three
times through a French pressure cell at 150 MPa. Cell

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/301

debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation
(60 000 × g for 30 min at 4°C). For enrichment, the resulting crude extract was diluted 1:1 with buffer A and subjected to a heat precipitatation at 80°C for 30 min. After
heat precipitation, the sample was cleared by centrifugation (60 000 × g for 30 min at 4°C), dialyzed overnight
against 50 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.0), 7.5 mM dithiothreitol (2-liter volume, 4°C). Enzyme purification was
achieved by chromatography on Q sepharose fast flow
(Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in 50 mM
HEPES/KOH (pH 7.0), 7.5 mM dithiothreitol. All glycerate kinase activity was found in the run-through fraction.
(NH4)2SO4 was added to the protein fraction to a final
concentration of 0.7 M and the mixture was applied to a
phenyl sepharose (high performance) column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in buffer A containing
0.7 M (NH4)2SO4. After three washing steps with buffer A,
protein was eluted by a linear gradient of buffer A with
increasing concentration of ethylene glycol (0–100%).
Fractions with glycerate kinase activity were pooled and
dialyzed overnight against 50 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.0),
7.5 mM dithiothreitol, 300 mM KCl. After concentration
by membrane filtration (Vivaspin 6 ml Concentrator,
5000-MWCO PES, Vivascience Sartorius Group) protein
was subjected to gel filtration on HiLoad 26/60 Superdex
200 prep grade (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated
in dialysis buffer. Fractions containing the homogeneous
enzyme fraction were pooled and used for enzymatic
assays. Protein concentration was determined according
to Bradford [60] using the reagent kit from BioRad Laboratories (Munich, Germany) and bovine serum albumin
as standard. The purity and molecular mass of the subunits of glycerate kinase were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturating conditions
according to Laemmli [61] with Dalton Mark VII-L
(Sigma) as standard.
Molecular mass determination
The native molecular mass was determined by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column
(Amersham Biosciences) using the same running conditions as for enzyme purification (protein concentration:
0.45 mg protein/ml). Standards: ferritin type I (horse
spleen, 443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (yeast, 148
kDa), D-lactate dehydrogenase (Lactobacillus leichmanii,
78 kDa), and cytochrome c (bovine heart, 12.5 kDa).
Enzyme assays and determination of kinetic, enzymatic
and regulatory properties
Glycerate kinase assay
For the determination of all parameters, except substrate
specificity, a discontinuous assay at 70°C, which monitors the glycerate-dependent formation of 2-phosphoglycerate was used. In the standard assay the phosphorylation
of glycerate by ATP was followed by coupling the forma-

tion of the reaction product 2-phosphoglycerate to the
oxidation of NADH via enolase (S. cerevisiae, bakers yeast
EC 4.2.1.11), pyruvate kinase (rabbit muscle, EC
2.7.1.40) and lactate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle, EC
1.1.1.27). The formation of 3-phosphoglycerate was studied by the addition of 1 unit of phosphoglycerate mutase
(rabbit muscle, EC 5.4.2.1). The glycerate kinase assay was
performed in 100 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5, 70°C) in the
presence of glycerate kinase (10 µg protein/ml volume), 5
mM ATP and 20 mM MgCl2. The reaction was started by
the addition of 0.25 mM D-glycerate. The indicator reaction (0.5 ml total volume) was performed at 37°C in 100
mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5, RT), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM
ADP, 0.5 mM NADH, 3.5 units of pyruvate kinase, 2.5
units of lactate dehydrogenase and 100 µl aliquots from
the glycerate kinase assay. The reaction was started by
addition of 1 unit enolase. Enzymatic activities were
measured by monitoring the increase in absorption at 340
nm (εNADH = 6.3 mM-1 cm-1). The measured enzyme activity was directly proportional to the amount of enzyme
added to the assay. If not stated otherwise, three independent measurements were performed for each assay,
and the experimental error is given.
For determination of Km- and Vmax-values for D-glycerate
and ATP, concentration ranges of 0–5 mM and 0–10 mM,
respectively, in the presence of 20 mM Mg2+ were used. In
order to assure the linearity of the enzyme reaction kinetics, reaction times of 0, 1, 2 and 3 min were recorded for
each measurement. Calculation of the kinetic parameters
(Vmax and Km) were performed by iterative curve-fitting
(Hill) using the program Origin (Microcal Software Inc.).
Co-substrate specificity was tested by substituting ATP (5
mM) for alternative phosphoryl donors (CTP, GTP, TTP,
UTP, ADP as well as PPi and P3, P5 and P25 polyphoshates)
at equimolar concentrations. Measurements were generally performed in the presence of 20 mM Mg2+; for PPi and
polyphosphate 1 mM Mg2+ was added. Metal ion requirement was analyzed by exchanging Mg2+ for other divalent
metal ions and by addition of EDTA. Samples were incubated at 70°C for 0 and 3 minutes and ion concentrations
of 0.2, 2, 5 and 20 mM were tested. EDTA was added at a
final concentration of 40 mM in the presence of 20 mM
Mg2+. The effects of K+ and NH4+ were studied at concentrations of 50 mM.
For effector studies, activity was determined in the presence of non-saturating concentrations of D-glycerate
(0.05 mM) as well as non-saturating (0.05 mM) or saturating (5 mM) concentrations of ATP. Temperature
dependence was followed over a wide range of temperatures (30–100°C) using the standard glycerate kinase
assay.

Substrate specificity was measured at 70°C in a discontinuous assay by monitoring ADP formation from the ATPdependent phosphorylation of different substrates. ADP
formation was coupled to the oxidation of NADH via
pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The glycerate
kinase assay was performed as described above but in the
presence of alternative substrates (5 mM) instead of the Dglycerate. The indicator reaction (0.5 ml total volume)
was performed at 37°C in 100 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5,
RT), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM phosphoenol-pyruvate, 0.5
mM NADH, 3.5 units of pyruvate kinase and 2.5 units of
lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was started by addition of 100 µl aliquots from the glycerate kinase assay.
Enzymatic activities were determined as described above.
Hydroxypuruvate reductase/glycerate dehydrogenase assay
Hydroxypyruvate reductase activity was determined at
70°C using a continuous assay. The reduction of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate was followed in the presence of
NAD(P)H + H+ in 100 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5, RT)
including 10 mM hydroxypyruvate, 0.5 mM NAD(P)H +
H+ and 10 µg of protein (assay volume 1 ml).
Sequence Handling and phylogenetic analyses
The initial alignments, obtained with CLUSTAL X [62],
were manually refined using the ED option of the MUST
program package [63]. All data sets were analysed by a
Maximum Likelihood (ML) method, implemented in
Treefinder [64], with a model based on the Whelan and
Goldman (WAG) matrix of amino acid replacements
assuming a proportion of invariant positions and gamma
distributed rates (WAG+F+I+Γ4). All phylogenetic trees
presented are Treefinder ML topologies. Bootstrap analyses with 100 replicates were used to estimate the support
for internal nodes of the phylogenies (Treefinder,
WAG+F+I+Γ4 model). The bootstrap consensus tree was
subsequently generated by the CONSENSE option of the
PHYLIP package [65]. PSI Blast analyses were performed
using the NCBI browser [66].
