Abstract
Background: Streptomyces coelicolor is a bacterium with a vast repertoire of metabolic functions
and complex systems of cellular development. Its genome sequence is rich in genes that encode
regulatory proteins to control these processes in response to its changing environment. We
wished to apply a recently published bioinformatic method for identifying novel regulatory
sequence signals to gain new insights into regulation in S. coelicolor.
Results: The method involved production of position-specific weight matrices from alignments of
over-represented words of DNA sequence. We generated 2497 weight matrices, each
representing a candidate regulatory DNA sequence motif. We scanned the genome sequence of S.
coelicolor against each of these matrices. A DNA sequence motif represented by one of the matrices
was found preferentially in non-coding sequences immediately upstream of genes involved in
polysaccharide degradation, including several that encode chitinases. This motif
(TGGTCTAGACCA) was also found upstream of genes encoding components of the
phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransfer system (PTS). We hypothesise that this DNA sequence
motif represents a regulatory element that is responsive to availability of carbon-sources.
Other motifs of potential biological significance were found upstream of genes implicated in
secondary metabolism (TTAGGTtAGgCTaACCTAA), sigma factors (TGACN19TGAC), DNA
replication and repair (ttgtCAGTGN13TGGA), nucleotide conversions (CTACgcNCGTAG), and
ArsR (TCAGN12TCAG). A motif found upstream of genes involved in chromosome replication
(TGTCagtgcN7Tagg) was similar to a previously described motif found in UV-responsive
promoters.
Conclusions: We successfully applied a recently published in silico method to identify conserved
sequence motifs in S. coelicolor that may be biologically significant as regulatory elements. Our data
are broadly consistent with and further extend data from previously published studies. We invite
experimental testing of our hypotheses in vitro and in vivo.

Background
The complete functional information encoded in a
genome consists not only of the genes, encoding proteins

and RNAs, but also structural and regulatory elements.
Complete genome sequences are generated much faster
than regulatory sites can be determined by experiment,

and so there is a need for computational prediction and
detection of regulatory elements in complete genomes.
In some cases, a set of co-regulated genes (i.e. a regulon)
is known, for example as the result of micro-array experiments. Several algorithms are available to discover
sequence motifs that occur more frequently in a set of coregulated genes compared against the background
sequence [e.g. [1-6]]. In the absence of experimental evidence for co-regulation, an alternative approach is to
compare the upstream regions of orthologous genes from
different species [7-9].
Successful as these procedures have been, they also have
limitations. For example, mRNA micro-array experiments
will only find those regulons that are responsive to the
laboratory conditions tested, and interspecies comparison
is limited by the availability of species separated by an
appropriate phylogenetic distance.
Several recent studies have addressed the problem of discovering binding sites for regulatory proteins in the
absence of experimental data about co-regulation [e.g.
[10,11]]. Again these methods are based on identifying
short DNA sequences that occur more frequently in a subset of sequences than would be expected from a random
sample of the background distribution. Li et al. [11] carried out a comprehensive analysis of the complete
Escherichia coli K12 genome sequence and discovered
many new potential regulatory elements as well as recovering previously known binding sites for 37 regulatory
proteins. Subsequently, Mwangi and Siggia [12] applied
the same technique, with some refinements, to the complete genome of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus
subtilis.
Streptomyces species are Gram-positive soil bacteria that
undergo a complex cycle of morphological differentiation, which culminates in the spore-bearing aerial hyphae
on mycelial colonies. This process of morphological differentiation is also accompanied by physiological differentiation, characterised by production of biologically
active secondary metabolites. In fact Streptomyces species
produce the majority of known antibiotics [13]. The huge
metabolic repertoire and complex developmental cycle is
the product of one of the largest known prokaryotic
genomes. The genetically best-known representative of
the genus, S. coelicolor A3(2), possesses an 8.67 Mb linear
chromosome [14]. Its complex genome is particularly rich
in regulatory proteins (12.3% from 7825 predicted genes)
including about 65 sigma factors [14]. We applied a similar method to that of Li et al. [11] and Mwangi and Siggia
[12] to try to discover novel regulatory motifs in Streptomyces coelicolor.

Results and discussion
The non-coding intergenic regions of the S. coelicolor
genome were scanned for significantly over-represented
dyads of the form W1NxW2 (see Methods for more details)
where W1 and W2 each represent a sequence of 4 nucleotides and Nx represents a sequence of between 4 and 20
nucleotides long. This resulted in identification of 2770
dyads that were statistically over-represented. These are
listed
in
additional
file
10
[significantly_overrepresented_dyads.txt]. The
2770
dyads were grouped into 2497 clusters, each of which was
used to generate a position-specific weighted scoring
matrix (PSWM). Essentially, each PSWM represented a
statistical model of a DNA sequence motif, which summarises the relative frequencies of each of the four nucleotides at each position. Each of the matrices is listed in
additional file 11 [matrices.txt].
All the intergenic sequences in the S. coelicolor genome
were scanned against each of the matrices to find highscoring matches to the DNA sequence motifs represented
by each matrix. Thus we identified 2497 sets of genes that
share common upstream DNA sequence motifs. Given
this large quantity of data, the challenge was to determine
which of these sets of genes sharing common upstream
sequence motifs represented biologically significant
regulons.
One way to address this issue was to search the data for
sets of genes that are functionally coherent; that is to find
those sets of genes in which the number of members associated with a particular biological function is significantly
larger than that which could be explained by chance. As
an indicator of biological function, we made use of a protein classification scheme [15] (see additional file 12
[classification_scheme.txt]) based on that originally created for E. coli in the EcoCyc database [16,17]. For every
set of genes sharing an upstream DNA sequence motif,
each gene was assigned to one of the 181 functional
classes. To determine whether any functional class was
statistically significantly over-represented in the set of
genes, a P value was calculated. The P value represented
the probability of obtaining the observed number of
genes (or more) belonging to that functional class within
a set. This P value indicates the statistical significance of
functional coherence within a set of genes.
We chose a threshold P value that was equal to one
divided by the product of the number of matrices and the
number of categories considered: 1 / (2497 *181) = 2.21
× 10-6. Thus by chance alone for the complete analysis, we
would expect to find less than one set of genes in which
the P value is less than this threshold. In fact, we found 11
sets of genes sharing common upstream sequence motifs
that contained over-represented functional categories

Table 1. Position-specific weight matrices (PSWMs) that represent DNA sequence motifs shared by functionally coherent sets of genes in
Streptomyces coelicolor. A library of 2497 matrices was generated from alignments of over-represented DNA sequence dyads as described in the
Methods section. Each matrix is essentially a statistical model of a DNA sequence motif [58]. The non-coding regions of the S. coelicolor genome
were searced against the matrices to find matches to each of the sequence motifs. The scanning method assigneda score (maximum 100) to each
match site. The minimum score threshold was chosen as 80. For each matrix, we recorded the number of genes whose upstream region contains
at least one match site. We also recorded the number of those genes belonging to each functional category in the protein classification scheme, and
calculated a P value to determine whether that functional category was significantly over-represented.

(Table 1 and Figure 2) plus several additional motifs associated with category 5.1.4 "Transposon/insertion element-related functions". The motifs associated with
category 5.1.4 were excluded from further consideration
as the aim of this study was to identify potential regulatory elements, not repeats associated with mobile
elements.
We performed a negative control experiment whereby we
randomly shuffled the orders of the columns of each of
the 2497 matrices and repeated the scans. After excluding
several motifs associated with category 5.1.4 "Transposon/insertion element-related functions", none of the
matrices yielded sets of target genes that satisfied the criteria for functional coherence.
It is important to note that for a set of genes to be functionally coherent, it is not necessary that the majority of
members of the set belong to a particular category; it is
only necessary that the number of members belonging to
a particular functional class is greater than could be reasonably expected by chance.
A motif associated with degradation of polysaccharides
and sugar transport
One of the matrices (matrix 2083), when used to search
against the S. coelicolor genome, yielded matches upstream
of sets of genes in which the functional class 2.1.3 "Degradation of polysaccharides" were over-represented (Table
2, additional file 1 [table2.pdf]). Many of the sites were
also conserved in the close relative S. avermitilis (Table 10,
additional file 9 [table10.pdf]). Scanning the genome

sequence of S. coelicolor against matrix 2083 yielded intergenic match sites upstream of 54 genes, including nine
that encode chitinases (SCO1429, SCO2503, SCO5003,
SCO5376, SCO5673, SCO5954, SCO6012, SCO7225
and SCO7263) and two that encode chitin-binding proteins (SCO0481 and SCO2833). The intergenic regions
upstream of SCO2503, SCO6012, SCO7225 and
SCO7263 each contain two sites (i.e. tandem repeats).
Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) are a group of glycosylhydrolases
that hydrolyse chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine
linked by beta-1, 4-bonds. Streptomycetes are the main
decomposers of chitin, the second most abundant
polysaccharide in soil. The complete genome of S. coelicolor [14] encodes 11 chitinases [18].
Several studies have demonstrated that Streptomyces chitinase genes are induced in the presence of chitin and
repressed in the presence of glucose plus chitin [19-22]. A
direct repeat of the sequence TGGTCCAGACCT, similar to
that of our motif, was shown [23] to be involved in the
both chitin-induction and in glucose-repression of chi63
encoding chitinase C (SCO5376). A similar motif has
been identified upstream of several other chitinases in S.
coelicolor [23-25].
From the results of our searches against matrix 2083, it
was apparent that several genes had direct repeats of the
motif in their upstream non-coding regions. These
included genes encoding chitinases (SCO2503,
SCO6012, SCO7225 and SCO7263), phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransfer transport system (PTS) components

(SCO2907 and SCO5841), a hydrolase (SCO6032),
amongst others (Table 2, additional file 1 [table2.pdf]).
The distance between repeated instances of the motif
appeared to be quite variable.
The identity of the transcription factor(s) mediating regulation of chi63 through this DNA element is not known.
In S. lividans, glucose repression of chitinase production
involves glucose kinase (encoded by glkA) [26,27]. However, it has been demonstrated that glkA is not required for
glucose repression of chi63 in S. coelicolor [28].
In S. lividans, regulation of chitinases also requires Reg1,
the 345-amino acid product of the gene reg1 [29,30]. Reg1
(SwissProt P72469) is a member of the LacI/GalR family
of transcriptional regulators and contains a helix-turnhelix motif at its N terminus. Reg1 is 95% identical to
MalR, the repressor of malE in S. coelicolor, and reg1 shares
synteny with malR; so Reg1 can be considered to be the
orthologue of MalR [30]. Two Reg1 (MalR) binding sites
upstream of malE have been identified in S. lividans by
DNA footprinting [31]. These operator sequences share
no obvious similarity with the motif represented by
matrix 2083. Therefore it is unlikely that this motif represents the Reg1/MalR binding signal.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/14

similar DNA elements upstream of genes encoding glucose-repressible chitinases and upstream of PTS genes,
suggests that a regulatory mechanism may be common to
both sets of genes. More specifically, an unidentified transcription factor that is presumed to mediate chitin-induction and glucose repression of chi63 may also play a role
in regulation of the PTS in S. coelicolor.
In addition to those associated with chitinases and PTS
components, a number of other sites matching matrix
2083 (Table 2, additional file 1 [table2.pdf]) were also
found upstream of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase
(SCO3563), a putative glucosamine phosphate isomerase
(SCO5236) and several putative sugar binding proteins
(SCO0531, SCO2946 and SCO5232). It seems plausible
that these might also share a common regulatory system
with the PTS and chitinases.
Conserved DNA sequence motifs associated with DNAreplication and repair
Of the 21 ORFs having an upstream match to matrix
2318, six belong to functional category 2.2.3 "DNA – replication, repair, restriction/modification" (Table 3, additional file 2 [table3.pdf]). These included genes predicted
to encode an ABC excision nuclease (SCO1966), DNA
helicase (SCO5761), DNA polymerase (SCO3541 and
SCO6084), a DNA gyrase (SCO5836) and a putative primosomal protein (SCO1475).

Interestingly, the intergenic sites matched by matrix 2083
also included several that are upstream of genes encoding
components of the PTS. The main function of the PTS is
to carry out the fundamental process of substrate-level
phosphorylation, whereby the transport and activation of
sugar substrates are thermodynamically coupled to
dephosphorylation of the glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate. The phosphoryl relay proceeds sequentially from phosphoenolpyruvate to enzyme I (EI), HPr,
enzyme II (EII), and finally to the incoming sugar that is
transported across the membrane and concomitantly
phosphorylated by EII. Additionally, in Gram-negative
and low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, PTS components
have been shown to participate in signal transduction,
chemotaxis, and the regulation of some key physiological
processes, e.g., carbohydrate transport, catabolite repression, carbon storage, and coordination of carbon and
nitrogen metabolism [32,33]. Complete genome
sequencing confirmed the presence of the general PTS
components enzyme I (ptsI), HPr (ptsH) and enzyme IIACrr (crr) in S. coelicolor [14,34-37]. Also there are several
genes that may encode four sugar-specific PTS permeases.
Several studies have examined the PTS in Streptomyces species and demonstrated its activity [e.g. [34-38]].

A sequence motif represented by matrix 1744 was found
in intergenic regions upstream of three genes classified as
belonging to category 1.2.1 "Chromosome replication"
(Table 4, additional file 3 [table4.pdf]). The genes encode
a putative replicative DNA helicase (SCO3911), a DNA
polymerase subunit (SCO2064) and recombinase RecA
(SCO5769). Matches also occurred upstream of other
genes implicated in nucleic acid metabolism including
ABC excision nuclease subunits (SCO1953, SCO1958 and
SCO1966), a helicase (SCO6262) and uracil-DNA glycosylase (SCO1343). On further examination of the matrix
1744 match site upstream of S. coelicolor recA, it became
apparent that this site overlaps the previously described
recA promoter [39]. The recA promoters of Streptomyces
and Mycobacterium species represent a distinct class of promoter
whose
consensus
sequence
is
TTGTCAGTGGCN6TAGggT, and which are probably
responsive to ultra-violet (UV) light [39]. Clearly the
motif represented by matrix 1744 (TGTCagtgcN7TAgg) is
related to this promoter sequence consensus.

Sites matching matrix 2083 were found immediately
upstream of several S. coelicolor genes that encode PTS EII
components (SCO1390, SCO2906 and SCO2907) and
ptsH (SCO5841) that encodes HPr. The co-occurrence of

coelicolor encodes about 65 sigma factors, each perhaps
having different promoter-specificities. One important
family of sigma factors are the extracytoplasmic function
(ECF) sigma factors, of which S. coelicolor encodes about
50 [40]. We found matches to matrix 46 in intergenic
regions upstream of 116 genes. Of the 66 S. coelicolor
genes belonging to class 6.2.1 "Sigma factor", ten had
matches to matrix 46 in their upstream intergenic regions
(SCO0038, SCO0803, SCO2742, SCO3356, SCO4960,
SCO7104, SCO7105, SCO7112, SCO7192 and
SCO5216). A match was also found upstream of
SCO5216, annotated as a sigma factor (Table 5, additional file 4 [table5.pdf]). All eleven of these gene products are predicted to belong to the ECF family of sigma
factors, though SCO0038 is only fragment, not a complete sequence. It is possible that this motif,
TGACN19TGAC, may be involved in some hitherto
unknown mechanism of regulation shared by several ECF
sigma factors in S. coelicolor.
A conserved DNA sequence motif associated with
exported proteins
Matrix 1909 matched 106 intergenic sites, 22 of which
were upstream of genes belonging to functional class
4.1.7 "Gram positive exported / lipoprotein" (Table 6,
additional file 5 [table6.pdf]). The putative products of
these 22 genes included many proteins of unknown function predicted to be secreted across the cell membrane
(e.g. SCO2741, SCO2001 and SCO1650). Also this
GAACN19GTTG motif was found upstream of genes for six
secreted peptidases. According to the MEROPS classification [41], these belong to peptidase family S8 (SCO0432,
SCO1741), family M1 (SCO7605), family M6
(SCO2920), family M16 (SCO5837) and family M23
(SCO3368). A homologue of SCO0432 (38% sequence
identity) cloned and purified from S. albogriseolus has
been shown to be secreted and to have subtilisin-like
endopeptidase activity [42]. Sigma factors belonging to
the ECF family characteristically recognise an 'AAC' motif
in the -35 region [40]. We hypothesise that this
GAACN19GTTG motif may represent a class of promoters
targeted by an as yet unidentified ECF sigma factor that
regulates expression of some or all of these extracellular
proteins.
A conserved DNA sequence motif found upstream of arsR
homologues
Members of the ArsR family are metalloregulatory transcriptional repressors, which repress expression of operons involved in response to high concentrations of heavy
metal ions [43]. Binding of metal ions to the ArsR protein
leads to derepression of the target operons. For example,
an ArsR-homologue, SrnR, was shown to mediate nickelresponsive transcriptional repression of superoxide dismutase in S. griseus [44].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/14

Fifteen genes in S. coelicolor are predicted to encode ArsRlike transcriptional regulators [15]. Of these fifteen, four
(SCO0875, SCO3699, SCO6808, and SCO6836) have an
upstream match to the motif TCAGN12TCAG, represented
by matrix 2034 (Table 7, additional file 6 [table6.pdf]). In
fact SCO6836 has two upstream matches and SCO3699
has three upstream matches. It is possible that this motif
represents a regulatory element. None of the other genes
with upstream matches are obviously implicated in metal
ion stress, so it is unlikely that this is a motif associated
generally with metal ion stress response. Also, these
matches are not conserved upstream of ArsR homologues
in S. avermitilis.
A conserved DNA sequence motif found upstream of genes
involved in nucleotide metabolism
The genome of S. coelicolor encodes 25 proteins belonging
to category 3.3.11 "Nucleotide interconversions" (Table 8,
additional file 7 [table8.pdf]). In the upstream intergenic
regions of five of these, there are matches to the near-palindromic motif CTACgcNCGTAG represented by matrix
1853 (SCO1776, SCO2015, SCO4901, SCO4914 and
SCO4917). Furthermore, a match is found upstream of
SCO4886. SCO4886 may be the first gene in an operon
also containing SCO4889, which encodes a putative cytidine deaminase. A match is also found upstream of
SCO4152, encoding a secreted nucleotidase and thiC
(SCO3938), which is involved in biosynthesis of the
nucleotide-derived cofactor thiamine. In many other bacteria, including the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, immediately upstream of thiC
is a highly conserved motif called the thi box [45], which
is characteristic of the so-called TPP riboswitch [46]. However, according to the Rfam database [47], there is no recognisable TPP riboswitch in the vicinity of thiC in S.
coelicolor.

This motif seems to be a good candidate regulatory element and it would be intriguing to test whether it is
involved in regulation of nucleotide metabolism and possibly associated secondary metabolic pathways.
A conserved DNA sequence motif found upstream of genes
involved in secondary metabolism
Actinomycetes are famous as producers of antibiotics and
other useful products for biotechnology [48]. In the S. coelicolor genome, the products of 165 genes were classified
as belonging to category 3.8.0 "Secondary metabolism"
(Table 9, additional file 8 [table9.pdf]). Three matches to
the near-palindrome TTAGGTtAGgCTaACCTAA occur in
intergenic regions within a cluster of these genes. This
motif was represented by several related matrices (363,
571, 293 and 153). One match falls between the divergently transcribed SCO0489 and SCO0490, the second
falls between the divergently transcribed SCO0498 and

BMC Microbiology 2004, 4

SCO0499, and the third falls upstream of SCO0495. It
seems plausible that this motif may be involved in coordinated regulation some or all of the genes in this cluster.
Their precise function of is unknown, but since these
enzyme-encoding genes are clustered together on the
chromosome it is possible that they may encode components of a single metabolic pathway. An additional incidence of the motif occurs upstream of a further gene
implicated in secondary metabolism (SCO2782).
Distribution of motifs in coding and non-coding DNA
A biologically significant regulatory sequence motif
would be expected to occur more frequently in non-coding rather than coding regions of a bacterial genome
sequence. Therefore, we investigated whether there was
such a bias in the distribution of matches to each matrix
in the complete genome of S. coelicolor (Figure 1A). We
scanned the complete genome sequence of S. coelicolor
against the matrix using a range of different threshold
scores. For each threshold used, we counted the number
of matches occurring in intergenic regions and those
occurring within coding regions, and calculated the ratio
between the two counts. About 5% of the S. coelicolor
genome is predicted to be non-coding [14]. When low
threshold scores were used, for most matrices about 10%
of the matches fell within intergenic regions. However,
when the searches were made more stringent by raising
the threshold, the ratio clearly changed and there was a
clear bias towards non-coding regions such that using a
threshold of 90, over half the matches occur in the 5% of
the S. coelicolor genome that is non-coding. The distribution of matches to matrix 363 was exceptionally biased
towards non-coding regions, with about 90% of the
matches occurring in non-coding DNA even when the
threshold was lowered to 70.

A similar pattern was observed when the analysis was
repeated using the closely related S. avermitilis genome
[49] (Figure 1B) for most of the matrices. However, the
bias was much smaller for matrix 46, and apparently
absent for matrix 1909. This suggested that these motifs
are probably not biologically significant in S. avermitilis. If
matrix 1909 does indeed represent a recognition site for
an ECF sigma factor as suggested above, then presumably
the sigma factor is not conserved in S. avermitilis.
When the same matrices were used to scan the genome of
the more distantly related Mycobacterium tuberculosis [50]
(Figure 1C), the bias towards non-coding DNA was much
less pronounced. However, matches to matrix 363 and
matrix 1744 showed a significant bias towards non-coding DNA in M. tuberculosis as well as in Streptomyces species, suggesting that they might be biologically significant
in a broader range of organisms. Consistent with this
observation, it has previously been reported that the UV-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/14

responsive promoter motif represented by matrix 1744 is
conserved in mycobacteria as well as streptomycetes [39].
In the genome of the very distantly related E. coli [51],
there was little or no detectable bias towards occurrence in
non-coding DNA (Figure 1D).

Conclusions
Historically, the study of regulation in Streptomyces species
has focussed on antibiotic production and cellular differentiation and relatively few regulons have been confirmed. We successfully applied a bioinformatic technique
[11,12], which had been developed using the model bacteria E. coli and B. subtilis, to identify conserved DNA
motifs in the actinomycete S. coelicolor. This resulted in a
large number of sets of genes sharing common upstream
DNA sequence motifs. These sets could be considered as
'putative regulons', but it is likely that many or most of the
motifs would not in fact be biologically significant. Therefore, we selected a small subset of the 'putative regulons'
that were functionally coherent (Table 1 and and Figure
2), and therefore might genuinely represent sets of genes
that share regulatory DNA elements in common.
One of the functionally coherent putative regulons
included genes encoding PTS components, chitinases and
other carbohydrate degradation and transport functions.
Members of this putative regulon shared an upstream
sequence motif (TGGTCTAGACCA). Since the roles of
glucose kinase and Reg1 on chitinase regulation are indirect, the mechanism of regulation of S. coelicolor chitinases
remains unknown. The presence of a sequence motif that
is shared by several chitinases and other genes of carbohydrate metabolism is intriguing. One possibility is that the
shared sequence motif represents the target site for a
DNA-binding transcription factor. A candidate regulatory
factor is ChiR [52], which has been shown to be involved
in activation of chiC expression in S. coelicolor. ChiR
belongs to the two-component response regulator family
[53] and contains a good candidate DNA-binding
domain. However, the target DNA sequence for ChiR is
unknown, as no direct DNA-binding has yet been demonstrated [52].
We discovered a motif found upstream of genes involved
in replication (Table 4, additional file 3 table4.pdf]),
which was similar to that of a previously described class of
UV-inducible promoters [39]. Also we found conserved
sequence motifs associated with ECF sigma factors, ArsRlike transcriptional regulators, nucleotide metabolism,
and secondary metabolism. We hope that these in silico
predictions will provide a useful starting point for future
experimental work (such as micro-array studies) on
important regulatory systems in Streptomyces.

Occurrence of sequence motifs in coding and non-coding DNA
Occurrence of sequence motifs in coding and non-coding DNA. The genomes of Streptomyces coelicolor (A), S. avermitilis (B),
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (C) and Escherichia coli (D) were scanned against each matrix to find matches to the corresponding
DNA sequence motifs. The scanning method assigned a score (maximum 100) to each match site. Scans were performed using
a range of different threshold minimum scores. For each threshold, we counted the number of match sites (with a score of
equal to or greater than the threshold) found in coding and in non-coding DNA (i.e. intragenic and intergenic sites respectively). The ratio of the number of intergenic sites to the number of intragenic sites is plotted for each threshold level that was
used. The matrices are further described in Table 1.

Methods
Sequence data were downloaded from the NCBI FTP site
[54]. A series of Perl scripts were developed to implement
a similar method to that described by Li et al. [11] for
identification of potential regulatory signals in intergenic
regions of complete genome sequences. These scripts are
included in additional file 13 [scripts.tar] and can also be
freely downloaded from the corresponding author's website [55].
The identification of potential regulatory motifs within a
given genome consisted of several steps. First, the script
'get_significant_dyads.pl' (see additional file 13
[scripts.tar]) was used to find statistically over-represented
dimers or 'dyads'. Secondly, the significantly over-repre-

sented dyads were grouped into clusters of dyads sharing
high sequence similarity (using script 'cluster_dyads.pl').
Next, for each cluster, the script 'find_matches.pl'
extracted short sequence strings that matched the dyads in
that cluster. Then for each cluster, the associated set of
sequence matches was aligned using ClustalW [56].
Finally each alignment was converted into a position-specific weight matrix (using script 'make_matrix.pl'), which
was used to search the genome sequence for close
matches. Each step is described in more detail below.
Identification of significantly over-represented dyads
A dyad is a DNA sequence of the form W1NxW2; that is
two words, W1 and W2, separated by x residues. The pair
of conserved oligonucleotides correspond to residues that

enter into direct contact with the DNA-binding domain of
the transcription factor. Their pairing is due to the fact that
many bacterial transcription factors form dimers, with
each unit binding to a similar small element, accounting
for the symmetry of the site [4,11,12].
In these analyses words W1 and W2 were each 4 residues
long and the spacing, x, was from 4 to 20 residues long.
The expected frequency of a word W1NxW2 in a given
sequence is considered to be the product of the frequencies of the words W1 and W2 [10-12]. Given the expected
frequency of a dyad and the observed frequency of that
dyad within a sequence of known length, it is possible to
test whether that dyad is found significantly more frequently than expected. Assuming a Poisson distribution, a
P value for the dyad can be calculated as follows. The
probability P of observing n(D) or more occurrences of D
is

P=

∑

n≥n(D)

[ y(D) ]n e − y(D)
n!

where y(D) is the expected number of occurrences of the
dyad D under the null hypothesis that the occurrences of
W1 and W2 are uncorrelated. The dyad was considered to
be significantly over-represented if it had a P value of less
than the inverse of the number of dyads considered [1012]. Thus we would expect less than one of the 'significantly over-represented dyads' to have been included by
chance.
In identifying significantly over-represented dyads, we
only considered non-coding DNA less than 300 bp
upstream of a predicted translational start codon. This
upper limit was chosen because it almost all known regulatory sites in bacteria fall within 300 bp of the coding
region [59].
Clustering of the significantly over-represented dyads
Many of the over-represented dyads represented different
but overlapping versions of the underlying sequence
motif [10-12]. To cluster the dimers, a pairwise similarity
score was computed for each aligned pair of dyads D1 and
D2 using the same method as [10-12]. Each dyad was considered as a vertex in a graph object. For each pair of
dyads, D1 and D2, if the pairwise score was greater than or
equal to a threshold of 7, an edge was added to the graph
to connect D1 and D2. This procedure led to a graph object
comprising a forest of a few large trees. Some rather dissimilar dyads were linked to each other via a series of several edges; therefore, the trees needed to be pruned to
generate a larger number of compact trees that contained
only a few closely related dyads. The process of pruning

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/4/14

consisted of removing any edges linking pairs of dyads
whose pairwise score was below a threshold of 5.
Generation of weight matrices (PSWMs) and prediction of
regulatory sites
For each tree of dyads in the graph object, we compiled a
list of all intergenic matches to any dyad within that tree
(using script find_matches.pl, see additional file 13
[scripts.tar]). We only included matches in non-coding
DNA less than 300 bp upstream of a predicted translational start codon. An ungapped multiple alignment was
generated for each list of matches using ClustalW. Each
multiple alignment was then converted to a position-specific weight matrix (PSWM) [58] using the
make_matrix.pl script (see additional file 13 [scripts.tar]).
Genome sequences were searched against PSWMs using
the promscan.pl script. The entire genome sequence was
scanned such that every window (of the same number of
bases as the length of the matrix) was assigned a score
using the matrix. This score, known as the Kullback-Leibler distance, reflects the theoretical binding energy of the
DNA protein interaction [57] and is calculated using the
formula:

I seq (i) = ∑ b fb,i log 2

fb,i
pb

where i is the position within the site, pb is the frequency
of that base in the genome, and fb,i is the observed frequency of each base at that position (from the matrix). To
avoid taking the logarithm of zero, a 'pseudocount' was
used such that where fb,i was equal to zero, the value of

fb,i log 2

fb,i

was taken as zero. Values for pb were calcupb
lated from the percentage G+C content of the genome
sequence. Scores were normalised such that 100 is the
highest possible score for a sequence window.
