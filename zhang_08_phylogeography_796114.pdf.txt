Abstract
Background: Pleistocene glaciations had considerable impact on phylogeographic patterns within and among
closely related species of many vertebrates. Compared to Europe and North America, research on the
phylogeography of vertebrates in East Asia, particularly in China, remains limited. The black-spotted frog
(Pelophylax nigromaculata) is a widespread species in East Asia. The wide distribution of this species in China makes
it an ideal model for the study of palaeoclimatic effects on vertebrates in East Asia. Our previous studies of P.
nigromaculata revealed significant subdivisions between the northeast China populations and populations in other
regions of the mainland. In the present study, we aim to see whether the deepest splits among lineages and
perhaps subsequent genealogical divisions are temporally consistent with a Pleistocene origin and whether clade
geographic distributions, with insight into expansion patterns, are similarly spatially consistent with this model.
Results: Using 1143 nucleotides of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from 262 individuals sampled from 28
localities, two main clades (clade A and clade B) differing by c. 7.72% sequence divergence were defined from
parsimony analyses. The corresponding timing of lineage divergence, 0.92 Mya, indicates a most likely Pleistocene
split. The A clade is further subdivided into two sub-clades, A1 and A2 with 1.22% sequence divergence. Nested
clade phylogeographical and population demographic analyses suggested that the current distribution of this frog
species was the result of range expansion from two independent refugia during the last interglacial period. We
discovered a population within which haplotype lineages A and B of P. nigromaculata coexist in the Dongliao area
of China by nucleotide sequences, PCR-RFLP and ISSR (inter simple sequence repeat) patterns. The ISSR result
in particular supported divergence between the mitochondrial clades A and B and implied introgressive gene flow
between the two divergent lineages.
Conclusion: Nested clade phylogeographical and population demographic analyses indicate that the current
distribution of P. nigromaculata is the result of range expansion from two independent refugia during the last
interglacial period in late Pleistocene. One refugium was in east China and the lower elevations of south-western
plateau. The distribution of the other mitochondrial clade is consistent with the presence of a refugium in the
Korean Peninsula. The gene flow as detected by ISSR markers suggests a range expansion of the two refugia and
a secondary contact between the two highly divergent lineages in the Dongliao (DL) area of northeast China.

Background
During Pleistocene glaciations, Northwest Europe, Siberia
and the northern most regions in North America were
covered with ice sheets [1,2]. Pleistocene glaciations had
extensive impact on phylogeographic patterns within and
among closely related species of many vertebrates [3]. In
Europe and North America, various species have been
studied to determine the climatic and geological effects on
phylogeographic patterns and population structures. In
Europe and America, species dispersed to southern locations to survive in refugia and then expanded northward
again during interglacial periods when climate recovered
to or exceeded current mean global temperatures.
Although there are discussion and debates regarding the
degree of Pleistocene effects on speciation in North American birds [4-6], Pleistocene conditions appear to have
played an active role both in initiating intraspecific and
species-level divergences of the most closely related North
American taxa [7]. However, climate recovery in East Asia
during interglacial periods did not seem to resemble that
of Europe or North America primarily due to the continuing uplift of the Tibet Plateau during late Tertiary. In
China, the glacial advance was not as extensive as in
Europe and North America because of the monsoons in
East Asia. Biotic zones of Asia were also located at higher
northern latitude than on other continents [8-10]. Despite
the relatively mild climate, species' distribution were
affected by climatic fluctuations during Pleistocene. However, research on the phylogeography of vertebrates in
East Asia, especially in China, remains limited both in
terms of the number of model species and geological
timescales.
The black-spotted frog (Pelophylax nigromaculata) is a
widespread species found in East Asia covering both Palaearctic and Oriental realms. The wide distribution of this
species in Northeast, North, East, Central and Southwest
China renders it an ideal model for investigating the palaeoclimatic effects on vertebrates in East Asia. P. nigromaculata is variable in size and color pattern over its wide
geographic range; but shows no distinct morphological
differentiation among populations and no subspecies
have been designated. Traditionally, the black-spotted
frog was treated as a member of genus Rana, but was
recently placed into Pelophylax, a genus reintroduced by
Fei et al. [11]. Recent studies on the phylogeny of ranid
frogs based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences
consistently supported Pelophylax as a well resolved
monophyletic unit [12-15].
Studies of molecular phylogeography of P. nigromaculata
have been independently reported by two groups. Yang et
al. proposed that during the last interglacial period, P.
nigromaculata experienced a rapid population expansion
and that its distribution range fluctuated latitudinally in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/21

response to climatic oscillations [16]. But details of the
evolutionary history and population structure were not
inferred because of the small number of sampling localities (eight) and the relatively few Cyt b sequence data (704
bp). In a previous study, we examined the genetic structure of this frog in mainland China using 5'control region
sequences and detected significant subdivision between
Jilin-Liaoning (Northeast China) populations and other
mainland populations [17].
In this report, we tested the hypothesis that the Quaternary glaciations were the causes of this significant genetic
structure. We analyzed the complete mitochondrial Cyt b
sequences and generated ISSR fingerprint data in order to
reconstruct the phylogeographic patterns in black-spotted
frog populations sampled from 28 localities across the
Chinese range (Fig. 1, Table 1). These data allowed us to
assess the evolutionary history (demography, age and origins) of various Chinese populations and to address the
hypothesis that the observed phylogeographic divisions
are consistent with past range fragmentation by Pleistocene glaciations.

Results
Cytochrome b variation
Of the entire 1143 bp of Cyt b sequences, 197 nucleotides
are variable and 130 are parsimony-informative. Nine, 29,
and 159 variable sites are in the first, second, and third
codon positions, respectively. No indels or premature
stop codons were observed. This result, together with a
strong bias against guanine (mean G = 13.3%, A = 25.8%,
T = 27.4% and C = 33.4%), implies that the target fragment is mitochondrial Cyt b rather than its nuclear homologue. We identified 118 haplotypes among the 216 P.
nigromaculata complete Cyt b sequences [GenBank:
AY803813~AY803895 and DQ006233~DQ006267].
Eighty-seven of these were unique haplotypes, 19 were
shared within local populations and 12 were shared
among local populations (Table 2). The sequence distances (based on the HKY model) vary from 0.09 to
8.65% (mean 2.2%) among ingroup taxa, distances
among different haplotype clades vary from 1.10% to
7.73% (Table 3). The overall haplotype diversity (h) and
nucleotide diversity (π) were 0.975 and 0.028, respectively.
Cyt b phylogenetics
Maximum parsimony (MP) analysis from 122 ingroup
haplotypes resulted in 6884 most parsimonious trees,
each 566 steps in length (CI = 0.7621, RI = 0.9027). Two
major monophyletic haplotype groups were revealed in
the Chinese population of P. nigromaculata: designated
here as clade A and clade B (as shown in Fig. 2a). Clade A
included all haplotypes present in most sampling regions
of this frog species: from northeast China (locality 24,

47°20'N) to southwest China (locality 16, 25°08'N);
clade B was found limited to eastern part of northeast
China (locality 25, 26, 27 and 28). Clade A was further
subdivided into two sub-clades: A1, with a broad geographical distribution and weak phylogenetic structure;
A2, with higher bootstrap support of 85% and distributed
to mountainous regions of southwest China (locality
17–23, see Fig. 1). When included the Korean and Japanese haplotypes, this phylogenetic topology showed that
the single Korean haplotype and clade B clustered with
100% bootstrap support, and that the three Japanese haplotypes formed a sister relationship with clade A and
showed 100% bootstrap value (Fig. 2).
Maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML)
and neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis of our reduced dataset

resulted in concordant topologies (topology and bootstrap support value of major clades were shown in Fig.
2b). ML analysis resulted in a tree with a likelihood score
of -ln L = 3396.27; MP analysis resulted in 3372 most parsimonious trees, each 528 steps in length (CI = 0.7670, RI
= 0.8388). The most obvious feature of the three topologies was consistent with those revealed by MP tree based
on 122 haplotypes (Fig. 2a). The sequence distances
among these haplotype clades also yielded obvious
insight of such phylogenetic relationships (Table 3). The
division pattern of haplotypes into several clades (A1, A2,
B and Japan) was concordant in three analyses, but support for sub-clade A2 was lower in ML (65%) than in MP
(80%) and NJ (88%) analyses. Lower support in ML compared to the MP and NJ analyses was likely the result of a

more complex model of sequence evolution used for ML
reconstruction.
For all the sequence data, Fu and Li's D* and F* were negative and not significant, and Tajima's D = -1.22, which
was not significantly different from 0 (P > 0.10). Patterns
of variation within our mitochondrial data are thus consistent with the neutrality hypothesis.
PCR-RFLP analysis
Most haplotypes are unique to local populations. Haplotypes shared across local populations (12 instances, Table
2) occur entirely in geographically adjacent areas except
for one case (haplotype 3), which is shared between
southwest China (BS) and central China (HC). To our surprise, locality 25 (northeast China) is composed of haplotypes grouping of the two highly divergent lineages (A and
B). This observation suggests that the Dongliao area
(locality 25, DL) may represent a secondary contact zone
of the two deeply split lineages. Accordingly, we widened
our sampling scales in this region and collected samples
from four contiguous sites of 25-a, 25-b, 25-c, and 25-d
with the maximum pairwise distances about 28 km (Fig.
1). We used 56 individuals in the PCR-RFLP analysis on
Cyt b. When the PCR products digested with Taq I and Xba
I, the expected fragment sizes were 1090 and 151 bp for
haplotype A, and were 704 and 537 bp for haplotype B.
The PCR product-digestion patterns allow us to readily
distinguish which haplotype group each product (sample) belongs to. All 12 samples from site 25-a are identified as haplotype A, while 6 and 4 in 25-b are respectively
A and B. In 25-c, 7 and 8 belongs to A and B respectively
and total 19 samples from 25-d are all B haplotype. Such
a distribution pattern strongly supports that secondary
contact and introgression between lineages A and B had
occurred in this region.
Nested-clade phylogeographic analysis
Haplotypes separated by up to eight mutational steps
were connected following the hierarchical nesting procedure. The two haplotype clades were grouped into two
independent networks (A and B). One hundred and six
haplotypes and 5 nesting levels were included in cladog-

ram A (Fig. 3), 12 haplotypes and 2 nesting levels in
cladogram B (Fig. 4). For both cladograms, fifteen nested
groups showed significant geographical associations in
nested contingency test (Table 4). Further, the nested distance analysis showed that 34 nested groups in both haplotype cladograms have geographic distributions that
differ significantly from random expectations (results not
shown). Contiguous range expansion, isolation by distance, long-distance colonization and past fragmentation
were inferred at different levels (Table 5), which facilitated
the identification of additional sampling areas.
For both cladograms, range expansion was inferred at
higher levels (Table 5). Tip (young) clades are more widespread geographically than interior (ancestral) haplotypes, which is characteristic of range expansion [18]. For
total cladogram A, there was no conclusive inference due
to the lack of tip-interior differentiation. Restricted gene
flow with isolation by distance is a repeated pattern
inferred in clade-groups 2-30, 3-2, 4-1 and 4-2. These four
groups correspond to lineage A1 and distribute most sampling localities. For group 3-1 and 3-12 which include
haplotypes from coastal population (locality 4), southwestern population (locality 16), and most central or eastern populations, we do not have sufficient evidence to discriminate between long-distance movement and the
combined effects of gradual movement during a past
range expansion and fragmentation. Long-distance colonization (or past fragmentation) is interpreted for group
3-13, which is located in the south-western plateau and
corresponds to lineage A2. Inadequate geographical sampling is identified within group 3-11 which corresponds
to the regions between northeast and north China (Fig. 1
and 3). Allopatric fragmentation is predicted within group
4-5 and 4-6. The former group is located across southwest
China and eastern most regions, while the latter is composed of haplotypes from north-eastern populations and
the east China populations.
Historical demography
Mismatch distributions for the entire group exhibited two
distinct modes (Fig. 5). We assume that the left peak represents a stationary expansion corresponding to lineage A,

but the "older" peak on the right is unlikely due to demographic expansion. Rather, may result from the deep split
between the lineages, perhaps caused by bottlenecking

was weakly significant (P = 0.043), but Tajima's D and
Fu's Fs are both negative (Table 6). Our estimated time
since expansion for lineage A1, A2 and B were different.
Expansions of sub-lineage A1 took place contemporarily
about 0.08 Mya, whereas expansion was about 0.012 Mya
for sub-lineage A2 and 0.028 Mya for lineage B. The
sequence variation (Table 6) of each lineage differs in our
estimated h and π. The presence of high h and high π
(0.975 and 2.8%) in the total populations seems to reflect
the fact that different mtDNA lineages were analyzed
together. Similarly, the same genetic diversity pattern was
observed for sub-lineage A1 (h = 0.972,π = 0.9%), which
means this lineage is a large population with admixed
local populations. Relatively low h and extremely low π
(0.631 and 0.13%) were found in sub-lineage A2, suggest-

ing that a prolonged bottleneck was present in this population. In lineage B, π is low (0.3%) but h is otherwise
(0.799), which can be explained by rapid population
growth from ancestral populations [20].
Based on the results from the MDIV analysis, the posterior
distribution for T revealed a sharp peak at 1.16. With substitution rate of 4.4% per Myr [21], our estimate of the
timing of lineage divergence, 0.92 Mya (95% credibility
internal 1.5 to 0.26 Mya), supports a Pleistocene split.
Further within the lineage A, divergence time between the
two sub-lineages was estimated to be 0.18 Mya (95% credibility internal 0.10 to 0.32 Mya), roughly corresponding
to the Riss glaciation (210,000–135,000 years ago) [22].
ISSR polymorphism and population structure
The 10 ISSR primers generated a total of 127 bands, of
which 103 were polymorphic thus showing 81.10% polymorphism and an average genetic diversity of 0.27. The
number of bands generated by individual primers varied
from 9 to 21, with the average being 12.7. The genetic variation indices at the species level were PPB = 81.10, Ao =
1.80, Ae = 1.45, He = 0.27, and I = 0.40, much higher than
the mean values of all populations, especially the PPB
(data not shown).

The UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean) dendrogram showed similar topology to that
of the mitochondrial phylogeny, showing divergence
between the mitochondrial clade A and clade B, and also
between sub-clade A1 and sub-clade A2 (data not shown).
As expected, we detected potential gene flow between lineage A and lineage B in DL area. Fig. 6 was the PCR banding pattern with primer UBC826. As shown (right side),
band L. A can be readily recognized as a lineage A-special
band, while band L. B was unique in lineage B. In the 3
individuals (DL1, 2, 6) of the mitochondrial linage B, L. B
was detected, while in 5 individuals (DL3, 4, 5, 7 and 8)
of lineage A, both bands (L. A and L. B) were amplified
(Fig. 6 left part). Interestingly, in individual DL9 which
belongs to mitochondrial lineage A (haplotype 14), only
band L. B. was detected. This phenomenon was not found
in all other local populations, and provided nuclear evidence to support the secondary contact and introgression
between lineage A and B at Dongliao area.

Discussion
Evolutionary history and independent refugia
Amphibians are known to exhibit a higher degree of population subdivision than any other major animal taxon
[23]. Our analyses revealed that there are two reciprocally
monophyletic lineages within Chinese range of P.
nigromaculata: the mainland lineage (A) and the northeast
lineage (B). The deep intraspecific split (7.72%) in Cyt b
is not of the same magnitude as to some anuran amphibians (maximum of 11.35% in Mantella bernhardi; 13.7%
in Hyla arenicolor [24]) and other vertebrate groups
(12.5% in Microtus oeconomus [25]). Zhang et al. had also
detected a deep haplotype split within P. nigromaculata on
mitochondrial 5' control region [17]. The interpretation
was that the relatively long-term hibernation of the northeastern population limited its ability of gene flow with
other mainland populations. In other words, genetic drift
under natural selection in northeast China resulted in a
deep divergence of this frog species. In such a case, selective sweeps would be expected to affect the evolutionary
pattern of Cyt b, but this conjecture was not supported by
the neutral tests of our dataset which indicated that its patterns of variation were consistent with the hypothesis of
neutrality. According to the estimated divergence time of
Cyt b haplotypes, the two lineages of P. nigromaculata

diverged approximately 0.92 Mya (credibility internal 1.5
to 0.26 Mya), similar to that of other anurans isolation
events [26,27]. This divergence time was roughly congruent with the Gunz glaciation (1.2 – 0.9 Mya), which may
be the cause of allopatric isolation and the lineage split.
Geographically, lineage A (A1 and A2) covers almost the
entire sampling region of this study. Lineage B is restricted
to the eastern part of northeast China (Fig. 1). The patterns of diversification suggest complex histories involving both allopatric isolation among refugial areas and
prominent patterns of dispersal. We proposed that there
were two independent refugia during Pleistocene glaciations. One refugium was the eastern monsoon region and
the lower elevations of the south-western plateau. Unlike
Europe and North America, China was not covered by
continental ice sheets during the Quaternary [28,29], even
though the climate was cold and dry. The permafrost had
expanded southward by about 10 degrees latitude to the
present day Great Wall line and the ice-age "mammoth
fauna" had roamed in north China and had even reached
the Yangtze River Estuary [30]. Conversely, the climate in
eastern China was relatively moist and warm; therefore,
eastern China was likely an alternative for this waterdependent frog to live through the cold periods. Zhang
also suggested that eastern China was a refugium for temperate and tropical-subtropical faunas during cold stages
of the Quaternary [31]. The fact that most haplotypes
from eastern local populations are present in interior
clades of the parsimony network A again substantiates our
east China refugium contention. Although the southwestern plateau had been identified with 3–5 glaciations
that are dated to late and middle Pleistocene [32], environmental diversity of tropics and subtropics in lower elevations are still maintained [9]. This region has retained
many relic floras of Tertiary and was also a refugium for
temperate and subtropical floras in cold periods of Quaternary [33]. It is possible for P. nigromaculata to have survived the lower elevations in cold periods and expand
afterwards.
We suggest that the other refugium was situated in the
present day Korean Peninsula. This Peninsula is situated
between 33°–43° N and 124°–132° E, and is adjacent to
northeast China. Recent studies on the Quaternary indicated that there were mountain glaciations developed in
the Changbai Cordillera [32], which lies between China
and North Korea. But the Korean Peninsula, characterized
by subtropical mountain climate [10], was not deeply
affected by the global climate changes starting in the Pleistocene. The sustained stable environment was presumably
favorable to P. nigromaculata. The Korean haplotype clustered with clade B and differed by only 0.009 on Cyt b
sequence from B further strengthens the notion of a
Korean refugium.

Expansion of lineage A
Using NCA on the Cyt b data, we obtained further insights
into the phylogeographic pattern in lineage A of P.
nigromaculata. First, contiguous range expansion was predicted for cladogram A in the highest nesting level (5-1, 52), which represents an older event in the evolutionary
history of P. nigromaculata. This conclusion helps explain
the species' current distribution in the north-eastern areas
and in the high elevations of south-western plateau where
former glaciations occurred. The tip haplotypes are interpreted as being younger than the interior ones [18]. We
found that the majority of younger haplotypes distributed
in the most peripheral populations of the species' range
(north-eastern, south-western and some costal regions).
This pattern, together with the unimodal mismatch distributions, supports the range expansion inference of lineage A. Most ancient haplotypes distributed in eastern
China also suggest that this area was the origin of the last
interglacial range expansion. From the high genetic variation of this lineage and the fact that most common haplotypes are shared among eastern and south-western
populations, we can conclude that the eastern and southwestern regions were the ice-age refugium for lineage A.
From this refugium, P. nigromaculata expanded in all
directions to form the current distribution pattern (Fig. 7).
Following range expansion, restricted gene flow isolation
by distance (IBD) at lower nesting levels (2-30, 3-2, 4-1
and 4-2) took place repeatedly, which seems to represent
more recent dynamics of this species. These results likely
indicate that gene flow decreased with geographic distance, despite the fact that there were rivers distributed
across the frogs' range. It also reflects the reduced vagility
of amphibian species. The close relationship between Japanese and clade A haplotypes might be an indication of its
origin. Throughout the Quaternary, sea level has risen and
fallen as continental ice sheets have waned and waxed
[34], and it was about 70–125 m lower than present during the last glacial period when the Eurasia continent was
in connection with Japanese archipelago by a land bridge
[34-36]. Additionally, the deepest Korean strait makes it
controversial of whether a land-bridge connection existed
in that place during Late Quaternary [36]. Via the land
bridge, we suggest, P. nigromaculata colonized Japan from
Chinese eastern coast (Fig. 7). However, further samples
from the Japanese population are required in future studies.

For group 2-19 (north-eastern populations QQ and DL
were included) in lineage A1, we could not distinguish
past fragmentation\long-distance colonization from contiguous range expansion due to the inadequate sampling
design. Again, in group 3-11, the two north-eastern populations and two populations near the Shandong Peninsula
(locality 3, 8) were included, for which the patterns of
fragmentation and isolation by distance were not identi-

fied due to sampling gaps. Nonetheless, it may imply that,
when recolonizing northeast China during the last interglacial period, these peninsula-adjacent populations were
founders. The recolonizing route might have been via the
Shandong region to northeast China (Fig. 7). This is also
consistent with the topology of MP tree (Fig. 2), in which
the north-eastern haplotypes are clustered with the peninsula-adjacent haplotypes. The route through which lineage A1 recolonized Baoshan (Location 16) is somewhat
puzzlings. The Baoshan population is an isolated population hundreds of kilometres apart from the nearest P.
nigromaculata population in Sichuan. It is recognized not
only by the specimens we obtained in 2002, but also by
63 specimens collected in 1998 by the researchers from
Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Fei and Jiang, personal communication). However,
due to the relatively high diversity level (both in mitochondrial haplotypes and ISSR profiles), and the relatively
few individuals studied, we were unable to unequivocally
identify the origin of the Baoshan population.

Group 3-13, corresponding to lineage A2 is composed of
all south-western plateau populations characterized by
long-distance colonization, and possibly couple with subsequent fragmentation. The unimodal mismatch distribution in this lineage suggests recent rapid colonization. The
estimated time since expansion was about 0.012 Mya,
after the last glacial maximum (LGM, 0.018 Mya). According to the palaeoclimatic records of this region [9], ice
sheet on the mountain had shifted vertically in response
to the oscillations of ice ages, natural zones have also
moved vertically since the Pleistocene, but retained environmental diversity of tropics and subtropics in lower elevations. P. nigromaculata likely survived in these areas in
ice-ages and rapidly expanded subsequently. Based on the
dispersal theory of Hewitt [2], once a place is occupied by
a leading edge expansion population through dispersal, it
will be much more difficult for those behind them to follow. The imprint of this is reduced genomic variability.
The strikingly low levels of genetic variation, especially
the observation that multiple individuals from distant
geographic regions share one single haplotype (No. 20 in
Table 2: 5 from DS, 3 from WG, 10 from GH, 5 from RH
and 4 from DZ) strongly supports rapid expansion.
Recolonization to northeast China of lineage B
Contiguous range expansion is also inferred for total
cladogram B, which restricted to northeast China. Mismatch distribution also lend strong support to the conclusion of population expansion of this lineage. The last
global glaciation corresponds respectively to the Würm,
Wisconsin and Weichsel glaciation in Alps, North America and western Europe [37]. In China the same period is
called Dali glaciation, which began at about 0.05 Mya. In
Europe and North America, the most extensive glacial
period was during the last glacial maximum (LGM) beginning 0.020 ~ 0.018 Mya, whereas in China the most extensive glacial period was not LGM, but the early stage (0.054
~ 0.044 Mya) of the Dali glaciation [38] when northeastern China was cold and the Changbai Cordillera was covered with ice caps [32]. The Korean Peninsula was
assumed to be a refugium not only because the relatively
mild climate of the Peninsula, but also because of the phylogenetic basal position of the Korean haplotype. Our
estimated time of expansion was about 0.028 Mya for the
P. nigromaculata lineage B and it was likely after the early
extensive glacial period in Dali glaciation, that this lineage
colonized northeast China via the Changbai Cordillera,
but not after the last glacial maximum when many lineages in Europe and North America underwent expansions.
The current distribution of lineage B suggests that after
recolonizing northeast China, this lineage remained in
situ rather than expanding southward, at least in the
present interglacial period.

Secondary contact and introgressive gene flow
Secondary contact of previously isolated populations after
the last glacial maximum in Europe and North-America
are well established [2,39-42]. In the present study, we
uncovered a population where haplotype lineage A and B
of P. nigromaculata coexisted in Dongliao area (locality
25). The DL population, located in northeast China, is the
only one composed of both lineages, a conclusion confirmed by nucleotide sequences, PCR-RFLP, and ISSR patterns. Hence, the DL region (especially 25-b and 25-c with
a distance only 2.2 km) was likely a rather narrow secondary contact zone during the current interglacial period.
The full range of the secondary contact zone remains to be
defined.

In general, hybrid or contact zones between populations
or species of varying degrees of differentiation provide a
potentially important source of information about how
taxa diverge and populations interact. We could not conclude that in the area of sympatry, genetic isolation exists
between the two lineages based solely on high mtDNA
sequence divergence of 7.7%. Indeed our nuclear ISSR
data suggest some inter-lineage gene flow in the DL population. Two lines of evidence support this contention.
First, in 5 individuals of mitochondrial lineage A, both
bands of L. A. and L. B. were amplified. Second, one lineage A individual only possessed L. B band. The former
may arise from the hybridization between males of lineage B and females of lineage A, and the later might be
caused by backcross of female hybrids of the former with
males of lineage B. In other words, these two divergent
lineages may have experienced a recent hybridization
resulting in introgressive gene flow.

Conclusion
Our phylogeographic study suggests that, two mitochondrial lineages diverged about 0.9 Mya beginning in independent refugia during the Pleistocene glaciation. Two
main clades, A and B, differing by c. 7.72% sequence
divergence were detected. The A clade is further subdivided into two sub-clade, A1 and A2 differing by 1.22%.
The two refugia seemed to be located in east China and
the lower elevations of south-western plateau, and in
Korean Peninsula, respectively. Contiguous range expansion from the two refugia during last interglacial period
resulted in the current distribution pattern of this frog species. Lineage A covers almost the entire sampling region of
this study. Lineage B is restricted to the eastern part of
northeast China. Secondary contact was detected in DL
area where both lineages coexisted, as confirmed by
nucleotide sequences, PCR-RFLP and ISSR analyses. ISSR
results provided further evidence for introgressive gene
flow between the two lineages in this area. Although climate events of the Pleistocene in East Asia did not seem to
resemble that of Europe or North America, they do have

had marked effect on the historical distribution and
intraspecific divergence of amphibians as in Europe and
North America.

Methods
Sample collection and Molecular techniques
Sampling was designed to cover most of the range of P.
nigromaculata across the temperate and subtropical zones
in China. We obtained 262 individuals from 28 localities
during the year 2002 and 2003. Two hundred and six
samples were used in cytochrome b (Cyt b) sequence analyses, the other 56, collected from 4 sites (25-a, 25-b, 25-c
and 25-d) in Dongliao area (locality 25, DL, Fig. 1) were
used in PCR-RFLP analyses to identify secondary contact
between haplotype group A and B. The distance between
sites 25-a and 25-b is 11.9 km, and that of 25-b and 25-c,
25-c and 25-d is 2.2 and 28.1 km, respectively. For inter
simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analyses, six or nine (just in
DL) individuals were sampled from the 28 localities mentioned above. Rana catesbeiana [GenBank: AF205089] and
Rana rugosa [GenBank: AF205093] were used as outgroup
taxa. Four conspecific haplotypes from Korea (KR) and
Japan
(JP-1,
2,
3)
[GenBank:
AF205087,
AY315755~AY315757] were also included in the phylogenetic analyses to help infer relationships with Chinese
haplotypes. The sampling code and population localities
are given in Table 1, and the map of collecting localities is
shown in Fig. 1.

Tissue was taken from leg muscle and stored in 95% ethanol. Extraction of DNA followed standard phenol/chloroform extraction methods. The complete 1143 bp of
mitochondrial Cyt b gene was amplified with primers
Glu-f: GAC TCT AAC CTG GAC CAA TAG-3' and contr5'r:
TAA ATT TAT GCT CTA TAC A-3', which were designed
based on the published mtDNA complete sequence of
Rana nigromaculata [GenBank: AB043889] [43]. The
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in 30 μL
volumes containing 3.0 μL 10 × Buffer, 2.0 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM each dNTP, 0.25 μM each of primers, 5–10 ng of
template DNA and 1.0 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega). The PCR cycling parameters were 95°C for 4
min, 35 cycles of 95°C for 40 s, 50°C for 45 s, 72°C for 1
min, and 1 cycle of 72°C for 7 min. Templates for
sequencing were purified and sequenced in both directions by United Gene Holdings (Shanghai). Nucleotide
sequences were initially aligned using CLUSTAL X Version
1.81[44] and corrected manually. Complete sequences
were assembled using Seqman II (DNASTAR). The program DNAClub which could predict cutting sites in a
DNA sequence was used to search for restriction endonucleases that would yield unique, specific restriction digestion profiles for each haplotype group. For the 56
unsequenced samples, we used two restriction enzymes of
Taq I and Xba I to digest the Cyt b products simultane-

ously, by which we could distinguish the two sharply
diverged haplotype groups rapidly and unambiguously.
We also investigated diversification and potential gene
flow using inter simple sequence repeat PCR (ISSR). Ten
3'-anchored primers (UBC807, 808, 809, 811, 817, 818,
825, 826, 827 and 835) from University of British Columbia (ISSR set #9) were used for the study. The reaction
mixture (25 μL) contained 2.5 μL of 10 × reaction buffer,
25 ng of DNA template, 0.5 μM of a single primer, 2.0 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP and 1.0 U of Taq DNA
Polymerase (Promega). The PCR products were separated
on 2% agarose gels buffered with 0.5 × TBE, detected by
staining with ethidum bromide, and photographed under
ultraviolet light. Molecular weights were estimated using
a 100-bp DNA ladder.
Phylogenetic analysis
We used PAUP*4.0b10 [45] for phylogenetic analyses
using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood
(ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods. Most local
populations showed low level of genetic differentiation
and were composed of haplotypes with only 1 to 3 nucleotide changes. For ML phylogenetic reconstruction, these
similar haplotypes would considerably increase the computation time. Therefore, the dataset comprised of all haplotypes was only used for MP reconstruction. To save the
computing time, we cut the sequences with less than fourstep substitutions for ML analysis to a 49 ingroup exemplar dataset including 45 from China, 1 from Korea and 3
from Japan. The best-fit likelihood model of sequence
evolution was HKY + I + G, which was chosen on the basis
of hierarchical likelihood-ratio tests (hLRTs) as implemented in MODELTEST 3.06 [46]. The parameters of the
model were calculated using PAUP*. The base frequencies
were 0.2582, 0.3340, 0.1334 and 0.2743 for A, C, G and
T, respectively, transition/transversion ratio ti/tv = 4.2823,
proportion of invariable sites Pinvar = 0.5841, gamma
distribution shape parameter α = 1.9961. We also conducted MP and NJ analyses for our reduced exemplar taxa.
ML heuristic search was conducted using the following
options: addition sequence = 'as-is', with 1 tree held at
each step, TBR swapping algorithm, Collapse and Multrees options in effect, steepest descent option not in
effect. Nodal support of the ML tree was estimated using
bootstrap method [47] with 100 pseudoreplicates; Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses were conducted using
heuristic search with 100 random sequence additions and
tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping.
Robustness of the MP trees was assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates; NJ reconstruction was conducted using
distances calculated under the HKY model, support for
the topology was evaluated by bootstrapping 5000 replicates. We also used the chosen model to calculate the
diversity indices and the sequence distances.

We calculated the statistical tests D* and F* proposed by
Fu and Li [48], and the D test statistic proposed by Tajima
[49] implemented in DnaSP 3.0 [50] for testing the
hypothesis that all mutations are selectively neutral [51].
Nested-clade phylogeographic analysis
We applied nested clade analysis (NCA [18,52]) to gain
further insight into the demographic history of P.
nigromaculata. The statistical parsimony [52] cladogram
networks were constructed using TCS version 1.13 [53].
The connection for haplotypes at 95% confidence level
were nested into higher level clades followed the algorithm given by Templeton et al. [52]. We used GEODIS
version 2.0 [54] to test the null hypothesis of no association between haplotypes and their geographical locations
by randomly permuting the observations within a nesting
clade across geographical locations. After 1000 random
permutations, the clade and nested clade distances (Dc
and Dn), the interior-tip distances (I-Tc and I-Tn) were calculated. The observed Dcand Dn were then contrasted to
the null distribution to infer the statistically significantly
large (L) and small (S) distances at 5% deviation level. For
the clades with significant geographical associations, the
recent published inference key [55] was used to infer possible causation.
Demographic history
Mismatch distributions were created using ARLEQUIN
version 2.000 [56] to detect historical demographic
expansions for the major lineages (with or without range
expansion in NCA analysis). We also calculated Tajima's
D [49,57] and performed Fu's Fs test [58] to confirm evidence of demographic expansion. We estimated the time
since expansion with the equation τ = 2ut [19], where τ is
the mode of the mismatch distribution, an index of time
since expansion expressed in units of mutational time, u
is the mutation rate for the whole sequence, and t is the
time since expansion. Finally, the comparisons of haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) within different lineages were used to infer historical demography
and examine the biological inference from our nested
clade analysis.
Divergence time between lineages
We analyzed the divergence time between the two lineages with a coalescent-based approach using the program
MDIV [59]. We ran the program under the 'finite model',
which does not assume that only one mutation occurs at
each site but takes into account the possibility of multiple
hits, differences in the nucleotide frequencies and the
presence of transition/transversion bias. MDIV estimated
values for theta (θ = 4Neμ), migration rate (M = 2Nem),
time of divergence (T = t/2Ne) [59]. We then ran each simulation 5 × 106 times with a 10% burn- in period as suggested. Likelihood values for θ, M and T were calculated

and the value with the highest posterior probability
accepted as the best estimate. Values for T were calculated
using an evolution rate estimated at 4.4% per Myr [21].
ISSR analysis
Unequivocally scorable and consistently reproducible
amplified ISSR bands were scored as present (1) and
absent (0), each of which was treated as an independent
character regardless of its intensity. Fragments of the same
molecular weight were considered as the same locus.

The binary matrix was used under the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium to calculate the percentage of polymorphism
(PPB), Nei's gene diversity (He), the observed number of
alleles per locus (Ao), the effective number of alleles per
locus (Ae), Shannon's information index (I), total gene
diversity, the level of gene flow using POPGENE version
1.31 [60].
Furthermore, to illustrate the relationship among populations, genetic divergence (Fst) were calculated using software ARLEQUIN version 2.000. We generated UPGMA
(unweighted pair group method with arithmetical averages) trees using the SAHN- clustering and TREE programs
from the NTSYS-pc, version 2.1 package [61]. In this tree,
individuals were enforced to their populations except for
those from the DL population (site 25), which were subdivided into DLA and DLB according to their ISSR patterns.
