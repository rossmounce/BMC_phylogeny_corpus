Sex in the PAC: A hidden affair in dark septate
endophytes?
Pascal L Zaffarano1, Valentin Queloz1, Angelo Duò1 and Christoph R Grünig1,2*

Abstract
Background: Fungi are asexually and sexually reproducing organisms that can combine the evolutionary
advantages of the two reproductive modes. However, for many fungi the sexual cycle has never been observed in
the field or in vitro and it remains unclear whether sexual reproduction is absent or cryptic. Nevertheless, there are
indirect approaches to assess the occurrence of sex in a species, such as population studies, expression analysis of
genes involved in mating processes and analysis of their selective constraints. The members of the Phialocephala
fortinii s. l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are ascomycetes and the predominant dark septate
endophytes that colonize woody plant roots. Despite their abundance in many ecosystems of the northern
hemisphere, no sexual state has been identified to date and little is known about their reproductive biology, and
how it shaped their evolutionary history and contributes to their ecological role in forest ecosystems. We therefore
aimed at assessing the importance of sexual reproduction by indirect approaches that included molecular analyses
of the mating type (MAT) genes involved in reproductive processes.
Results: The study included 19 PAC species and > 3, 000 strains that represented populations from different hosts,
continents and ecosystems. Whereas A. applanata had a homothallic (self-fertile) MAT locus structure, all other
species were structurally heterothallic (self-sterile). Compatible mating types were observed to co-occur more
frequently than expected by chance. Moreover, in > 80% of the populations a 1:1 mating type ratio and gametic
equilibrium were found. MAT genes were shown to evolve under strong purifying selection.
Conclusions: The signature of sex was found in worldwide populations of PAC species and functionality of MAT
genes is likely preserved by purifying selection. We hypothesize that cryptic sex regularely occurs in the PAC and
that further field studies and in vitro crosses will lead to the discovery of the sexual state. Although structurally
heterothallic species prevail, it cannot be excluded that homothallism represents the ancestral breeding system in
the PAC.

Background
The origin and maintenance of sexual reproduction is a
controversially discussed topic in evolutionary biology as
reflected by the multitude of theories that have been
proposed to explain why sexual reproduction, although
highly costly, is widely occurring in nature [1-6]. Asexual organisms have a two-fold advantage over sexual
conspecifics and can effectively disseminate [7-10]. In
contrast, sexual reproduction efficiently eliminates deleterious mutations [11] and creates genetic variation that
favors natural selection and accelerates adaptation to

changing environments [1]. However, many species are
capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually and
illustrate how difficult it is to provide a general explanation on the evolutionary significance of sex. Fungi combine the advantages of the two reproductive modes.
Several reasons were proposed for why the cost of sex
compared to asex is lower in fungi than for animals and
plants [12] because (i) fungi can be isogamous and thus
the contribution of resources to the zygote by the
gametes is limited and (ii) many fungi are also homothallic (self-fertile) and do not depend on finding a compatible mate which reduces the cost of sex, whereas
others are heterothallic (self-sterile) and mating is regulated by mating type factors. (iii) Moreover, the majority
of fungi can alternate between asexual and sexual

reproduction and thus sexuality can be adjusted to when
opportunity costs are low, for example at the end of the
growing season of a host plant on which a fungus is
dependent when adverse conditions are disadvantageous
for somatic growth. Sex is also linked to essential processes such as the formation of resistant spores that are
able to survive unfavourable conditions and enable new
genotypes to be spread into new environments. Once
the link between sex and such essential processes has
evolved, selection against frequent sexual recombination
might be less effective.
However, for many fungi, especially for filamentous
ascomycetes, only part of their life cycle is known.
These taxa are classified as Deuteromycota or “fungi
imperfecti” due to the lack of sexual morphology [13],
but it is unclear whether sexual reproduction is absent,
rare or cryptic because sexual morphology is often difficult to observe in nature or in the laboratory [14,15].
Thus, the importance of sexual reproduction in natural
populations of such species remains an open question
which can be addressed by direct and indirect
approaches [16].
The direct apporach consists in searching for the sexual state (teleomorph) in the field or in the laboratory.
However, it is often difficult to induce the teleomorph
in vitro as many factors (e.g. nutrient media, temperature, light exposure, selection of compatible mating
types) need to be optimized for a successful induction
[17,18]. Moreover, although sexual structures obtained
in the laboratory indicate that the ability for sexual
reproduction has not been lost, its importance in the
field remains to be established by population studies
and by monitoring the teleomorph in the field [16].
Indirect approaches comprise population studies that
test the null hypothesis of random mating and include
analysis of gametic disequilibrium, mating type ratios,
genotypic diversity and phylogenetic analysis [19,20].
Moreover, functionality of genes involved in mating processes can be tested by expression analyses and provide
further evidence for sexual reproduction [21]. Alternatively, estimates of selective pressures acting on such
genes might indicate whether functionality is preserved
[22-26].
In this study we aimed at elucidating the importance
of sexual reproduction in the Phialocephala fortinii
sensu lato - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC)
that belongs to the dark septate endophytes, a polyphyletic group of ascomycetes with characteristic melanized,
septate hyphae that commonly colonize roots of woody
plant species [27]. The PAC is composed of more than
20 species, eigth of which were formaly described
[28,29], and they dominate the endophytic assemblages
in roots of conifers and members of the Ericaceae in the
northern hemisphere from polar to subtropical regions

[30-32]. PAC species form communities of up to ten
species [32,33] and species abundance distributions
within these communities ususally follow a hyperbolic
distribution with a few abundant species and many
“rare” species, consistent with the community structures
of many other organismal groups [34]. Interestingly, no
biogeographical pattern was found for PAC species and
community compositions did neither correlate with
composition of the host species nor with climate [32]
supporting the the hypothesis that “everything is everywhere” [35]. Despite the broad geographical occurrence
of this fungal species complex, the teleomorph has
never been observed for any of its species.
In ascomycetes, the mating type (MAT) locus exercises
key regulatory functions involved in mating processes
and usually defines homothallism and heterothallism
[36,37]. In heterothallic ascomycetes the MAT locus is
characterized by two alternative forms, MAT1-1 and
MAT1-2, called idiomorphs because they contain dissimilar DNA sequences at the same chromosomal location. These encode proteins with conserved DNA
binding domains that are involved in transcription regulation leading to the attraction of compatible mating
types in order to initiate the mating process [37] and
are also involved in controlling the regulation of internuclear recognition in later steps of sexual development
[38-40]. In contrast, in homothallic species, a single
individual generally contains all of the MAT genes and
is thus capable of selfing [41]. In filamentous ascomycetes the simpliest idiomorphs consist of MAT1-1 that
carries one gene called MAT1-1-1 encoding a protein
with an a-domain binding motif and MAT1-2 that contains one gene called MAT1-2-1 encoding a protein
with a high mobility group (HMG)-binding domain
[42,43]. However, additional MAT genes are regularely
found in ascomycetous species [42]. For example, in the
helotialean species Pyrenopeziza brassicae and Rhynchosporium secalis that are closely related to the PAC [44]
up to two additional MAT genes have been identified in
the MAT1-1 idiomorph. One is designated MAT1-1-3,
encodes a protein with an HMG-binding domain and is
present in both species, whereas MAT1-1-4 encodes a
metallothionein-like protein and is only present in P.
brassicae [45,46].
In a recent study we cloned the MAT genes of eight
PAC species [44]. and expected the MAT idiomorphs to
be similar to those of their helotialean relatives. Seven
examined species showed a heterothallic organization of
the MAT locus because strains either contained the
MAT1-1 idiomorph carrying MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-1-3
or the MAT1-2 idiomorph carrying MAT1-2-1. In contrast, in A. applanata the MAT locus structure was indicative of homothallism because all of the three MAT
genes were present in single strains. However, it was

Zaffarano et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:282

neither possible to induce sexual reproductive structures
in crossing experiments nor to show that MAT genes
were expressed under laboratory conditions [44]. In contrast, analysis of multi-locus gametic disequilibrium for
a limited number of Swiss populations of four PAC species showed that in most populations the index of association I A [47] did not deviate significantly from zero
which is indicative of recombination [33,48]. Because
PAC species are successful root colonizers of a multitude of plant species in many ecosystems, we hypotesize
that sexual reproduction occurrs as it confers the ability
to successfully adapt to different environments
worldwide.
In the present study we aimed at gaining a more complete picture about the importance of sexual reproduction in this species complex. In particular, we determined
(i) the MAT locus structure for 11 additional PAC species, (ii) whether opposite mating types in populations of
the PAC species deviated from the 1:1 ratio expected
under random mating, (iii) the deviation from gametic
equilibrium in the fungal populations, (iv) the spatial distribution of mating types at the collection sites, and (v)
the selective pressures acting on MAT genes.

Page 3 of 14

The MAT locus of 11 additional PAC species was
sequenced and characterized for one MAT1-1 and
MAT1-2 strain per species (Table 1), and its structure
was found to be congruent with the MAT locus structure of the seven previously studied species [44]. The
MAT1-1 idiomorphs contained the MAT1-1-1 and
MAT1-1-3 gene whereas the MAT1-2 idiomorphs
included the MAT1-2-1 gene.
Mating type ratios and gametic disequilibrium in PAC
populations

The vast majority of populations (> 80%) did not deviate
significantly from the expected 1:1 ratio in mating types
(Table 2). After applying Bonferroni correction to adjust
for errors of multiple comparisons (type 1 error), no significant deviations remained. Moreover, even those
populations with < 10 individuals contained both mating
types. Only a single population was found that did not
include both mating types. Similarly, only six out of 52
populations showed significant gametic disequilibrium
and these were restricted to populations of P. subalpina
(Table 2), Furthermore, in only two of these P. subalpina populations both unequal mating type frequencies
and gametic disequilibria were recorded.

Results
Organization of the MAT locus in PAC species

The multiplex PCR amplified either a MAT1-1 specific
fragment of ~550 bp or a MAT1-2 specific fragment of
~750 bp in strains of any PAC species, except in the
homothallic A. applanata for which no fragments were
amplified, as expected due to its MAT locus organization [44] (Figure 1). During the screening of the collections, occasionally (in < 2.5% of the screened strains)
both fragments were amplified in single strains, indicating potential homothallism, and in < 1.0% of the strains
an amplification failure of the PCR product was
recorded. However, re-analyzing newly prepared singlehyphal-tip cultures from a subset of eight of these
strains, an amplification of single idiomorph-specific
fragments was always obtained (see Additional file 1).

Spatial distribution of mating types in selected study
sites

The spatial distribution of mating types was analyzed for
four PAC species in ten Swiss populations. In each
population, strains of opposite mating type were found
distributed over the whole study site (see Additional file
2). Strains of different mating types were regularly isolated from the same grid points indicating that they can
be found in close physical proximity (Table 3). In addition, measures of association [Q] between opposite mating types for significant spatial structures ranged from
weakly negative to strongly positive (Table 3), meaning
that co-occurrence of strains with different mating types
is often more frequently observed than expected by
chance.

Analysis of selective pressures based on sequence
information

Overall values of ω ranged between 0.26 and 0.46 for
the three MAT genes and proportions of amino acid
sites under purifying selection (ω < 1) were larger than
proportions of sites reported under neutral selection (ω
= 1) or positive, diversifying selection (ω > 1). For all
three MAT genes, models that allow codons to evolve
under positive selection (M2a and M8) did not fit the
data significantly better than models that do not permit
positive selection (M1a and M7) (Table 4). Although for
the genes MAT1-1-3 and MAT1-2-1 the log likelihood
values of Model M2a and M8 were higher than the

associated models M1a and M7, the p-values of the LRT
statistic were > 0.05. Nevertheless, for MAT1-1-3 and
MAT1-2-1 the LRT test of M0 versus M3 was significant, suggesting variable selection pressure among sites.
For these two genes a proportion of sites with ω > 1
was found in models M2a and M8, i.e. 7.6% of the sites
with ω = 2.72 for MAT1-1-3 and 3.1% of the sites with
ω = 5.76 for MAT1-2-1. Up to seven amino acid sites
were identified as sites of positive selection using the
BEB analysis in MAT1-1-3 but only one site had strong
support with BEB posterior probability > 95% in model
M8 (see Additional file 3). In MAT1-2-1 five amino acid
sites were reported under positive selection but had

Discussion
Members of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala
applanata species complex (PAC) have no known sexual state. In this study, however, footprints of sexual
reproduction were found in populations from large global samples, providing evidence that sexual reproduction
may occur in these fungal species.
MAT locus structure and evolution of homo- and
heterothallism in the PAC species

Homothallic fungi can fertilize themselves whereas heterothallic fungi depend on another compatible individual for sexual reproduction to occur. In filamentous
ascomycetes the MAT locus is the key determinant of
breeding system and it has been shown that conversions
between heterothallism and homothallism can be
achieved by manipulating the MAT locus [41,49]. For
example, the heterothallic Neurospora crassa was capable of self-fertilization after a strain was made carrying
both mating types [50,51]. In contrast, a strain of the
homothallic Giberella zeae was converted to self-sterility
after those MAT genes were deleted that are present on
opposite mating types in other closely related heterothallic species [49,52].
The structure of the MAT locus was mapped for 11
additional PAC species for which the MAT locus had
not yet been characterized. All of these species

possessed either the MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 idiomorph
consistent with a heterothallic organization structure.
The identified MAT genes MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-3-1 or
MAT1-2-1 in the respective idiomorphs were of consistent lengths and their arrangement within the MAT
locus and orientation with respect to each other was the
same as found for other PAC species [44] and the other
closely related helotialean species Pyrenopeziza brassicae, Oculimacula yallundae and Rhynchosporium secalis
[45,46,53]. The only PAC species containing a homothallic MAT locus structure remains A. applanata [44].
A controversial topic in fungal biology is whether heterothallism or homothallism represents the ancestral
state [37,41,49,54,55]. The question has been addressed
in particular for the ascomycete genera Cochliobolus
[40], and references therein] and Aspergillus [56], and
references therein] that comprise heterothallic and
homothallic species. In the heterothallic Cochliobolus
species the MAT locus structure is conserved as strains
are either MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 and contain the genes
MAT1-1-1 or MAT1-2-1 with the same gene orientation
within idiomorphs. In contrast, in the homothallic species the MAT locus structure is unique because single
individuals possess both MAT genes that are either
fused into a single ORF, are closely linked or likely present on different chromosomes. Due to this variation in
MAT locus structure and phylogenetic evidence of independent evolution of self-fertility, the likely derived state
in this genus was proposed to be homothallism [49].
Recombination is normally suppressed in the MAT
locus because the sequences of the two idiomorphs are

Models of neutral evolution (M1a and M7) are tested against models that incorporate positive selection (M2a and M8). Comparison of M0 vs. M3 tests variable
dN/dS rate ratios among sites. Model M3 classifies sites in the sequence into discrete classes ( = 3) with both the dN/dS rate ratio ω0, ω1, ω3 and the
proportions p0, p2 and p3 estimated from the data. For models M1a and M2a, values of p0, p1, and p2, are the proportions of sites inferred to be evolving under
purifying selection, neutral evolution, and positive selection, respectively, and ω0, ω1 and ω2 are their corresponding dN/dS rate ratios. For models M7 and M8,
the b distribution, b (p, q), describes the distribution of the dN/dS rate ratio between zero and one, and p0 is the proportion of sites within this distribution. In
these models, p1 is the proportion of sites inferred to be under positive selection, and ω is the dN/dS rate ratio for those sites.

significantly diverged [57,58]. However, small identity
island of 8 and 9 nucleotides were identified within
MAT genes of the heterothallic Cochliobolus heterostrophus and rare recombination events between these small
identity islands were suggested to be the likely mechanism for the conversion of reproductive modes in ancestral lineages [49]. In contrast, the prevalence of
homothallic species, phylogenetic analyses and comparisons of genome sequences suggest that heterothallism is
the derived state in the genus Aspergillus [59] albeit
additional characterizations of MAT loci of supposedly
asexual Aspergillus species may alter this view [56].
For PAC species both evolutionary trajectories of
reproductive modes from homothallism to heterothallism and vice versa are conceivable. Because MAT genes
control reproductive processes the information gained
by comparing their DNA sequences might allow reconstructing the evolutionary history of a species complex
and indicate mechanisms that led to changes in reproductive modes [49]. The basal position of A. applanata

in the MAT gene phylogenies suggests that the MAT
genes of A. applanata are older than the MAT genes of
the remaining PAC species which are grouped in clusters, and thus are more recently derived and share a
common ancestor (see Additional file 4). In fact, this
finding is congruent with population genetic data and
other phylogenetic data based on DNA sequences of
housekeeping genes and RFLP loci that showed that A.
applanata is the most diverging species in the PAC
[60]. It is possible that a switch in reproductive mode of
a homothallic ancestor was the source of the strong
divergence between A. applanata and other PAC species
and that thus, A. applanata represents an ancient lineage within the PAC. In populations of an ancestral
homothallic species a structural change in the MAT
locus, e.g. after a deletion of a MAT gene could have
provoked a switch to heterothallism and created barriers
to self-mating. These genetic barriers could have
increased and maintained genetic diversity, eventually
leading to speciation and radiation that gave rise to the

Zaffarano et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:282
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/282

current heterothallic species. The likely mechanisms that
have initiated such a switch in the PAC might be
explained by re-arrangements among idiomorphs and
the influence of transposable elements on recombination
events in the MAT locus of A. applanata [44]. On the
other hand the heterothallic PAC species possess a conserved MAT locus structure with congruent MAT gene
orientation and position within the MAT locus. This
organization is also consistent with the MAT locus
structure found in closely related helotialean species
that are heterothallic [45,46,53]. Thus, the prevalence of
structurally heterothallic species in the PAC and their
conserved MAT locus organization are arguments in
favor of heterothallism as ancestral breeding system.
Mating type distribution and gametic equilibrium

If sexual reproduction plays an important role in the
life cycle of a fungal species, natural populations would
be expected to show following characteristics [16,19]:
(i) 1:1 ratio of mating types because frequency-dependent selection acts on the rare mating type that has
the higher chance for mating, and (ii) gametic equilibrium at unlinked loci because under random mating
sexual recombination will reduce non-random association of alleles. Both criteria were met for the majority
of PAC populations. The 6 out of 52 populations that
displayed gametic disequilibrium were restricted to the
species P. subalpina. Independently of the reproductive
mode several factors can cause non-random association of alleles that result in gametic disequilibrium.
These factors include high frequency of rare alleles,
genetic drift, population admixture and selection
[16,61]. We therefore re-analyzed these collections of
P. subalpina after pooling rare alleles but the results
did not change (data not shown). We then tested
whether traces of population admixture could be identified in the two populations using the program
STRUCTURE [62] and evidence for admixture was
found in two populations. Moreover, the strains collected from Bialowieza could be allocated with high
posterior probabilities to two subpopulations and the
index of association I A did not significantly deviate
from zero in both of these subpopulations (data not
shown).
The spatial distribution of mating type within study
sites is often neglected in studies aiming at assessing the
reproductive biology of fungal species. In this study
opposite mating types were often collected at the same
grid points within study sites. Moreover, the measures
of spatial association Q were predominantly neutral to
strongly positive, meaning that for several populations
the occurrence of both mating types at the same grid
point was higher than expected by chance alone. Thus,
the physical proximity of compatible mating types in the

Page 9 of 14

study sites meets another prerequisite for successful sexual reproduction in the PAC.
Selection acting on mating type genes in PAC

If MAT genes play an important role in the initiation
and further steps of sexual reproduction [39,40] they are
expected to be functionally conserved in sexual species.
All PAC species possessed structurally identical idiomorphs and translation of the MAT genes suggested
that they encode functional proteins. In A. applanata
the insertion of a transposable element in the 3’ end of
MAT1-2-1 caused a truncation of 30 amino acids in the
translated protein [44]. Moreover, insertions of 3 and 9
bp were found in MAT1-1-1 of A. applanata and in
MAT1-2 deletions as long as 18 bp were found for cryptic species CSP12, CSP14, P. letzii, P. europaea and A.
applanata. However these indels did not result in stop
codons or frame shifts that could affect functionality.
The molecular analyses revealed that all three MAT
genes appear to be under strong purifying selection
because sites under purifying selection were predominant. The overall values of ω obtained ranged between
0.26-0.46, and the proportions of sites under purifying
selection (ω < 1) were much larger than the fraction
evolving neutrally or under positive selection accounting
for at least 65% of the sites. In only few studies the
selective pressures on MAT genes were analyzed and
similar overall values of ω were found ranging between
0.14 and 0.49 in sexual or presumed sexual fungi
[22,23,25,26]. The predicted effect of long-term asexuality is the decay of genes specific for sex and recombination due to the relaxation of selective constraints [63]
but the results of our study suggest that MAT genes in
PAC species are highly conserved and functional.
Rapid divergence of reproductive proteins, due to
positive selection and adaptive evolution, is believed to
be important in the formation of reproductive barriers
leading to speciation [64-66]. Competition for gamete
recognition between individuals might explain the rapid
evolution of reproductive proteins [67]. High levels of
interspecific polymorphism have been found in MAT
genes [22,68]. In our study the amount of polymorphism
between the structurally heterothallic PAC species was
also high and ranged between 8.7 and 9.4%. This was in
the range found for non-coding RFLP loci and approximately 2.5-fold more than in levels found in the housekeeping gene beta-tubulin [60]. However, statistical
evidence of positive selection of MAT gene, i.e. high
levels of non-synonymous substitutions leading to
changes in MAT proteins, has only been shown in the
genus Neurospora [25]. Our results showed that models
of evolution that allow positive selection (ω > 1) were
not more likely than those incorporating neutral evolution. Nevertheless, the comparison of model M0 vs. M3

Zaffarano et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:282
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/282

tested significant for variable pressure among sites in
MAT1-1-3 and MAT1-2-1 and up to seven sites evolving
under positive selection were identified in these genes,
although only one was significant in the BEB analysis. It
might be assumed that these and many more sites
evolve under positive selection in MAT genes but that,
in a strong background of purifying selection, they
remain uncovered by the currently available analysis
methods. However, whether the putative protein alterations at such positively selected sites have a biological
significance is unknown.
Have PAC species a sexual life cycle?

In the present study we combined different indirect
approaches to analyze the importance of sexual reproduction in the PAC. The population analyses were in
accordance with random mating and sexual recombination in abundant collections from different ecosystems.
Moreover, the presence of a conserved MAT locus in all
PAC species suggests that MAT genes are functional
and are still involved in mating processes. Yet, although
the data does not allow rejecting the hypothesis of sexual recombination, the confirmation of the teleomorph
in vitro is pending. Our first attempts to induce apothecia formation of PAC species failed when we tried to
cross opposite mating types under laboratory conditions
[44]. However, in vitro induction of the teleomorph is
often difficult and time consuming and some perseverance is required [17,18]. Nevertheless, we successfully
induced teleomorph formation of Phaeomollisia piceae,
the closest known relative of the PAC [69]. P. piceae
forms small darkly pigmented apothecia of less than 800
μm diameter. Considering that PAC species might form
similar apothecia in the soil or on roots it seems likely
that the teleomorph has been overlooked in field
studies.

Conclusions
In this study we evaluated the importance of sexual
reproduction in the PAC, the dominant dark septate
root endophytes of woody plant species, and showed
that the signature of sex is present in all of these putatively asexual species. The MAT locus resembles those
of closely related heterothallic ascomycetes, is conserved and purifying selection likely preserves functionality of its genes. The hypothesis of sex occurring
in the PAC cannot be rejected based on the random
association of alleles at multiple loci, the equal mating
type frequencies and the spatial distribution of opposite mating types in populations from different ecological habitats, hosts and continents. We believe that
further field studies and in vitro crosses will finally
lead to the discovery of the sexual state, which is the
missing link to better understand how reproductive

biology shaped the evolutionary history and influences
the ecological role of the PAC.

Methods
Collection of PAC species and mating type screening

A total of 3, 639 strains derived from 33 study sites
were included in the mating type screening (Table 2).
These strains represent 19 PAC [32] species eight of
which are formally described [28,29]. Several classes of
molecular markers were developed for PAC species
assignment including PCR fingerprints, single-copy
restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP),
multi-locus DNA sequences, and microsatellites. Each of
these molecular markers supported the delineation of
multiple species in this complex, with concordant cryptic species defined by all markers [60,70]. PAC species
communities were either collected on grid nets (196 m2,
74 grid points) [33] or on transects (50 m, 11 grid
points) [32] from Europe (number of study sites n =
19), North America (n = 10) and Asia (n = 4). Collections included both undisturbed and managed forests.
Multiplex PCR

A multiplex PCR method was developed to discriminate
between isolates carrying either the MAT1-1 or the
MAT1-2 idiomorph based on available sequence data of
the MAT locus of seven structurally heterothallic PAC
species [44]. The primer Pf_HMG_R.03 (5’TCCTCGAACCGGTGCCACGAATGACTCCGA-3’)
was designed to match a flank of the idiomorphic region
that is conserved between the two mating types of these
species. The MAT1-1 specific primer (Pf_HMG_F4: 5’AGCTGAGCTCGAGACCTCGTTCGC-3’) and a
MAT1-2 specific primer (Pf_MAT1-1F1c: 5’-CTTGTA
CGGTCCGGCAATCCACA-3’) were designed to generate DNA fragments of distinct length in combination
with Pf_HMG_R.03 that could be easily differentiated
on agarose gels. All PCRs were performed on a Biometra T1 thermal cycler in a 10 μl reaction volume containing approximately 2 ng template DNA, 5 pmol of
each primer, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1, 5 mM
MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs (Promega AG, Dübendorf) and
0.2 U Taq polymerase (Promega AG, Dübendorf).
Cycling conditions during PCR were 2 min at 94°C followed by 29 cycles of denaturation for 20 s at 94°C,
annealing for 30 s at 60°C and extension for 60 s at 72°
C, followed by a final extension step of 5 min at 72°C.
Mating type frequencies in PAC populations

The number of strains from a single study site and
belonging to the same PAC species is here defined as a
population. Before assessing significance of deviation
from a 1:1 mating type ratio in a population, each population was clone-corrected using 12 microsatellite loci

Zaffarano et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:282
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/282

[70] or 11 single-copy RFLP markers [33], meaning that
only one representative of each multi-locus genotype
was included. Clone-correction is necessary because the
same fungal thallus is found on several grid points. Five
species [cryptic species (CSP) 8, 9, 10, 18 and 19]
occurred at exceptionally low frequencies in the collection sites and represented less than 3% of all collected
strains. For these species, the distribution of mating
types was assessed after pooling all strains of a species,
irrespective of the study site from which they were isolated. Significance was tested using the exact binomial
test. In addition, Bonferroni corrections were performed
for multiple comparisons.
Because species abundance distributions within local
PAC communities follow a hyperbolic distribution with
a few very abundant species and many “rare” species
[48], clone-corrected datasets for such rare species
resulted in a low number of distinct genotypes (< 10).
In these cases, only the frequency of mating types was
recorded without testing for significance.
Analysis of gametic disequilibrium

Significant deviations from multi-locus gametic equilibrium in a population were tested using the index of
association I A and its variance according to Maynard
Smith et al. [47]. All calculations of IA were based on
clone-corrected datasets and multi-locus genotypes with
missing data were excluded from the analysis.
Spatial distribution of mating types in selected study
sites

Spatial distribution of mating types was analyzed for five
Swiss study sites. Only the two most abundant PAC species per community were included in this analysis. For
each of these species, the number of grid points was
recorded where either MAT1-1 or MAT1-2 or both
mating types were found. A contingency table test for
independence of the spatial distribution of the mating
types was performed and a measure of association
between MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 (Q) was calculated as
described in Pielou [71].
Studying the presence of both mating types in single
isolates

In few cases, no amplification product was obtained in
some strains, or both the MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 specific fragments were amplified in single strains. In order
to study the reason for these observations, ten new
single-hyphal tip cultures were prepared from the original slants of the three strains having displayed both
PCR products and of the five strains from which no
PCR product was obtained. After harvesting and
extracting DNA of mycelia from both the original
slants and the newly prepared single-hyphal tip

Page 11 of 14

cultures, the mating types were re-determined using
the multiplex PCR.
Sequencing the MAT locus

The MAT locus was sequenced for 11 PAC species and
compared to the MAT locus structure of 8 previously
sequenced PAC species [44]. For each of these species
the MAT locus of both the idiomorph MAT1-1 and
MAT1-2 was sequenced (Table 1). The detailed sequencing strategy and the sequencing primers used are given
in the Additional files 5 &6, and the MAT locus was
annotated as described in [44]. PCR fragments were
directly purified using an “ExoSap” protocol [70]. Cycle
sequencing was performed with the Big-Dye v3.1 kit
(Applied Biosystems) in a 10 μl reaction volume using 1
μl purified PCR amplification product, 0.5 μl BigDye
v3.1, 1.9 μl 5 × Buffer, 5.6 μl ddH2O and 1 μl of the
sequencing primer (10 μM). Cycle sequencing reactions
were performed on a Biometra T1 thermal cycler with
the following running conditions: 60 s at 96°C followed
by 55 cycles of 10 s at 95°C, 5 s at 50°C and 4 min at
60°C. Dye-labeled fragments were cleaned using BigDye
Xterminator Purification kit following manufacturer’s
instructions (Applied Biosystems). Samples were run on
an ABI 3130xl DNA Analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Analysis of selective pressures

In order to assess what kind of selective pressure is acting on any of the three MAT genes a maximum likelihood (ML) method implemented in the program
CODEML in the PAML 4.1 software package [72] was
used to compare the rate of non-synonymous substitutions with the rate of synonymous substitutions (dN/dS
= ω). Under neutrality ω is expected to be 1. When
amino acid changes are favored, indicative of positive
selection, ω is expected to be > 1, whereas under purifying selection amino acid changes are prevented and ω is
expected to be < 1. Positive selection of small number
of codons in the MAT genes may be masked when the
entire gene is strongly affected by purifying selection.
Therefore, a codon by codon approach was used based
on the ML method implemented in CODEML that
allows site by site identification of particular codons that
have been evolving under repeated and strong positive
selection [72]. The three MAT genes were analyzed
separately and a gene tree describing the phylogenetic
relationships of all taxa studied (one strain per species)
was constructed using the ML method implemented in
the program treefinder [73] using the best-fitting mutation model. The inferred trees served as the basis for
the implementation of the ML methods in the CODML
(see Additional file 4).
Three sets of models, commonly applied to test
hypotheses of selection, were used. Following the

Zaffarano et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:282
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/282

suggestions of Yang [72] the site model pairs that
appear to be particularly useful for real data analysis, are
the M1a (nearly neutral) versus M2a (selection) and M7
(neutral) versus M8 (selection). However, model M0
(one-ratio) was also compared versus M3 (discrete) in
order to see if the selective pressure is variable among
sites. Because the comparison of M7 versus M8 is less
conservative, this set of models may indicate positive
selection even when none is detected by the M1a vs.
M2a comparison.
The strength of positive selection was calculated using
the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) [72] implemented in
PAML by comparing twice the log likelihood difference
in a chi-square test. The degree of freedom for the test
statistic is determined by the difference in estimated
parameters between the models of selective pressures
being compared, i.e. four [M0 (one-ratio) vs. M3 (discrete)] or two [M1a (nearly neutral) vs. M2a (selection),
and M8 (selection) vs. M7 (neutral)] degrees of freedom
[72]. Codons that are identified as having evolved under
positive selection have high posterior probabilities (p >
0.95). Posterior probabilities for such sites were estimated based on Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis
[74].
The MAT gene sequence of the homothallic A. applanata species was not included in this analysis because it
would have inflated the alignments with deletions. For
example, the MAT1-2-1 sequence of A. applanata contained a large deletion of 90 bp at its 3’ end, due to the
insertion of a transposable element in the MAT locus of
the species [44]. Gaps in alignments cannot be handled
by CODEML and the program automatically removes
such sites. Thus, in order to prevent the loss of informative sites in the sequence of the other species, the A.
applanata sequences were removed from the alignment
prior to the analyses.
