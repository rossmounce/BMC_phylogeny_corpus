Abstract
Background: Many fish alter their expressed visual pigments during development. The number of
retinal opsins expressed and their type is normally related to the environment in which they live.
Eels are known to change the expression of their rod opsins as they mature, but might they also
change the expression of their cone opsins?
Results: The Rh2 and Sws2 opsin sequences from the European Eel were isolated, sequenced and
expressed in vitro for an accurate measurement of their λmax values. In situ hybridisation revealed
that glass eels express only rh2 opsin in their cone photoreceptors, while larger yellow eels
continue to express rh2 opsin in the majority of their cones, but also have <5% of cones which
express sws2 opsin. Silver eels showed the same expression pattern as the larger yellow eels. This
observation was confirmed by qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction).
Conclusions: Larger yellow and silver European eels express two different cone opsins, rh2 and
sws2. This work demonstrates that only the Rh2 cone opsin is present in younger fish (smaller
yellow and glass), the sws2 opsin being expressed additionally only by older fish and only in <5% of
cone cells.

Background
Eels (such as the European eel, Anguilla anguilla) change
their habitat several times during their life cycle and
undergo two distinct metamorphoses that involve morphological, physiological and behavioural changes [1,2].
Eels are catadromous teleosts which are probably
spawned in the blue water of the Sargasso Sea [3], possibly
at depths of <200 m [3]. The embryo becomes a leptocephalus (translucent leaf-shaped larva) and spends 1-2
years [3] drifting with the Gulf Stream into the North
Atlantic. Leptocephali travel the ~6000 km to the European continental shelf with its more green coastal water,

where they metamorphose into glass eels, one of two juvenile forms. As elvers (pigmented glass eels) and then as
yellow eels (the larger juvenile form), they travel up European rivers and spend 6-20 years in a yellow/brown
stained fresh water environment, where they grow and
mature as a freshwater species. Subsequently, mature eels
must cross the Atlantic Ocean to return to the Sargasso Sea
to spawn. Both just prior to and during this migration
they undergo 'silvering', usually described as a second
metamorphosis but which is more correctly a pubertal
event [4], when they become sexually mature adult fish.
As sexually mature European eels have never been caught,

it is thought that they become fully mature either on the
last part of their journey or on reaching their destination.
During this life cycle, the photic environment of the eel
changes considerably, moving from blue deep sea to green
coastal waters, into yellow/brown shallow freshwater and
back to blue deep sea again.
Many fish alter their complement of visual pigments during development and this can be attributed in most cases
to environmental changes during the life cycle [5-7]. Shallow dwelling fish with access to a wide visual spectrum
usually express a full complement of visual opsins, a rod
pigment and four cone pigments. Deeper dwelling benthic (living >1 km down) species which have limited or no
access to down-welling sunlight have dispensed with
many or all of the cone opsins and retained only rod photoreceptors. These often have very extended or multiple
layered outer segments for maximal photon catch of
attenuated sunlight or bioluminescence [8]. Eels experience more changes to their photic environment than most
fish species, and are known to switch the rod visual pigment (rh1) on maturation from a "fresh water" form to a
"deep-sea" form [9,10]. Wavelength sensitivity is also
affected by a change in the ratio of vitamin A1- and A2derived chromophores used to produce rhodopsin (i.e.
vitamin A1-based pigment) and porphyropsin (vitamin
A2-based pigment) [11,12]. Maturation is also accompanied by an increase in rod domination in the retina
[12,13] arising from the proliferation of rod progenitors
[14].
The retinae of most larval teleosts which later undergo a
metamorphic event (termed indirect development), contain only cone photoreceptors; with rods being added
later after metamorphosis [15-17]. It had been thought
that eels were the exception to this rule [13], but work by
Omura [18], showed that cones are present in very early
(<2 week old) leptocephali. Omura also showed that
older leptocephali (>2 weeks) possess a pure rod retina
from which the cones must have been lost [18]. However,
in postmetamorphic glass eels, the retina contains both
rods and cones [19-21]. Eels are therefore known to
change the photosensitivity of their rod photoreceptors as
well as the photoreceptor composition of the retina during their life cycle. Two spectrally distinct cone classes
have been identified [19] but the classes of cone opsin
expressed, the timing of cone development, and the distribution of cone types in the retina are largely unknown.
This study sets out to determine when changes in cone
opsin expression might occur.

Results
Cone opsins
Microspectrophotometric (MSP) analysis of the retinae of
glass, yellow and silver eels [19] demonstrated the pres-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/71

ence of two types of cones, a middle wavelength-sensitive
(MWS) class and a short wavelength-sensitive (SWS) class.
The former was found at all three developmental stages
but showed a variable λmax that arose from changes in the
proportions of the A1 pigment rhodopsin and the A2 pigment porphyropsin that were present. The λmax of the pigment as a pure rhodopsin was estimated to be at 525 nm,
consistent with the values found by other workers, allowing for differences in chromophore ratio [20,21]. In contrast, the SWS class was found only in yellow and silver
eels. Again, the exact wavelength varied slightly according
to the proportions of rhodopsin (A1) and porphyropsin
(A2) present, with an estimated λmax for pure rhodopsin of
435 nm.
To identify the opsin genes responsible for the pigment
present in these MWS and SWS cones, eel retinal cDNA
was used. Only two opsin sequences were obtained which
corresponded by BLAST analysis to the rh2 and sws2 opsin
coding sequences present in other species. No fragments
corresponding to either the lws or sws1 opsin genes were
found.
The identity of these sequences was further confirmed
using phylogenetic analysis. As shown in Figure 1, the rh2
and sws2 eel sequences are placed into clades with orthologues from other species. The sequences have been
deposited in GenBank with accession numbers of
FJ515778 for rh2 and FJ515779 for sws2.
Peak sensitivities of cone pigments
To correlate the expressed cone opsin genes with the cone
classes identified by MSP, full-length eel rh2 and sws2
sequences were expressed and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal, the λmax values were obtained by spectrophotometry.
As shown in Figure 2, the rh2 sequence resulted in a pigment with a λmax value of 525 nm, identical therefore to
the value obtained by MSP for the MWS cones. The sws2
sequence gave a pigment with a λmax of 44 6nm, which is
somewhat red-shifted compared to the value of 435 nm
obtained by MSP for the SWS cones. Such differences may
be encountered when comparing between in vitro and in
situ λmax values and it was concluded therefore that the
MWS and SWS cones express the rh2 and sws2 pigments
respectively [5,22].
Spatial and temporal development of cones classes
In situ hybridisation (ISH) was performed with rh2 and
sws2 sense and anti-sense probes. These were derived from
the 5' or 3' UTR and coding region of the RH2 cDNA, and
gave a positive signal in a large proportion of cells in the
cone layer. Using the 3' end of the sws2 coding sequence a
positive signal to the anti-sense probe was observed in a
sub-set of cone cell bodies (Figure 3). No signal was
obtained for either of the sense (control) probes.

As is usual for fish retinae, the cone cells are arranged as a
continuous monolayer situated above the outer limiting
membrane, between the outer nuclear layer (ONL, the
nuclei of the rod cells) and the rod outer segments themselves (ROS). The signal indicating the presence of rh2
opsin mRNA transcript can be seen in all cone cells in the
glass eel, and in the majority of cone cells in the yellow
and silver eels. The sws2 probe also highlighted cones in
the monolayer. However, in contrast to the MWS cones,
sws2-containing cells were restricted to the retinae from
older eels, with none in any of the glass eels (20 fish), a
few in the elvers/small yellow eels (2 of 19 fish <300 mm
in length), but were present in all the larger yellow fish (8
fish >300 mm in length) and in all silver eels (3 animals
>770 mm in length). The spatial frequency of the SWS
cones is also lower than the MWS cones, with each SWS
cone sited at discrete spacings compared to the continuous monolayer of MWS cones. The distance between SWS

cones varied widely (partly according to fish size), from a
value of 1 in 5 found in several mid-sized yellow eels, to
1 in 12 cells in one of the silver eels. Most mid-sized yellow eels measured showed average MWS cone spacings of
7 ± 1.7 μm; whilst for the SWS cones, the same fish gave
values of 45 ± 15 μm. The silver and very large yellow eels
were more variable (50-90 μm between SWS cells, with
standard deviations of up to 40%, typically 68 ± 23 μm).
For mid-sized yellow eels, this was a linear spacing of
approximately one in every 6-7 cones, equivalent to an
array frequency of approximately 1 in 30.

in agreement with the previously measured λmax of 435 nm allowing for the differences in chromophores. B. Expression of the
eel rh2 opsin protein gave a calculated λmax of 524.5 ± 0.0 nm, which is almost identical with the measured λmax of 525 nm. The
close agreement between the MSP measurements and those of the in vitro expressed protein confirms that the isolated opsin
sequences are those expressed by the cones.

glass eels than in yellow and silver eels, where the levels
were very similar. A surprising finding was the presence of
expressed sws2 opsin mRNA in glass eels when no SWS2containing cones were evident by in situ hybridization
staining. Across all three stages, the level of sws2 message
was substantially lower than rh2 message, consistent with
the relative paucity of SWS2-containing cones compared
to MWS cones.
Rod pigments
It has been previously shown [12] that the sexual maturation of both the European and American eel is accompanied by an increase in rod domination of the retina and a
shift in absorbance maxima of the rod photoreceptors to

a shorter wavelength; this shift is the result of a switch in
expression in rod opsin from the "freshwater" (fwo) to the
"deep sea" (dso) form [9,10]. The presence of this switch
was confirmed by qPCR (Figure 4B) where expression of
the dso form, although just detectable in glass and yellow
eels, is significant only in silver eels where it represents
around 60% of the total expressed rod opsin. The levels of
the fwo form show a significant increase from glass to yellow stage, and this level is maintained in the silver eels
despite the simultaneous expression at a higher level of
the dso form.
The ratio of cone to rod opsin expression reflects the rod
dominant nature of the eel retina. Even at the glass eel
stage, a ratio of rod to cone (rh2 + sws2) opsin mRNA
expression is 17:1, and this rises to 30:1 in yellow eels and
to 121:1 in silver eels (with expression of fwo and dso
forms of rod opsin combined). Morphologically (Figure
5), rods contribute an increased proportion of the retina
in yellow eels compared to glass eels, with an approximate
doubling in the thickness of the outer nuclear layer. This
increase does not however continue into the silver eel
stage, so the substantial increase in the rod to cone opsin
ratio seen at this stage is likely to reflect an increase in the
relative production of rod opsin mRNA during the switch
over from fwo to dso forms.

Discussion
We have demonstrated here that the European eel
(Anguilla anguilla) changes opsin gene expression more
times during its lifetime than had previously been
reported. It was shown by Omura [18] that cones cells are
present in very early leptocephali; whilst older leptocephali possess a pure rod retina [23]. It was also shown
by Hope et al. [9], and quantified by Zhang et al. [10], that
rod photoreceptors start to express the dso form of rod
opsin as the animal undergoes puberty (silvering) before
migration from fresh to salt water. Glass eels have a mixed
retina with rh2 opsin expressed in cones [19], indicating
that they have already made a change from the pure rod
retina of the leptocephali. This probably occurs as they
move from the deep sea into the shallower waters of the
continental shelf and estuaries. A second change in cone
opsin expression then occurs as they either move into the
rivers or remain longer in the estuaries. Instead of a monolayer of cone photoreceptor cells expressing only the rh2
pigment, occasional sws2 opsin-expressing cones appear
within the monolayer. It could not be determined
whether an rh2 opsin-expressing cone changes to express
sws2 opsin (as happens during the switch in expression
from fwo to dso forms of rod opsin [9,10]); or if new
cones which express the sws2 pigment are inserted at
intervals into the monolayer. The result appears as an
array of SWS-expressing cones interspersed within the
MWS cone monolayer.

The results of the qPCR experiments did not fully confirm
the findings of the in situ hybridisations on the varying
amounts of sws2 cone opsin in the different life stages of
the eel. Whilst no cells containing sws2 opsin mRNA were
detected by in situ hybridisation in the glass stage eels,
sws2 opsin sequence was detected in these samples by
qPCR, which is commonly believed to be a more sensitive
detection method. From the in situ hybridisation results,
sws2 opsin expression did not appear to start until well
into the yellow stage (greater than 300 mm length), and
continued at a similar level into the silver stage. However,
qPCR, suggested that the levels of sws2 opsin expression in
the yellow and silver eel was only about 4 to 5-fold higher
than in the glass eel stage, as can be seen in figure 4A. A
possible explanation for this could be that sws2 opsin
message is transcribed as a default at a very low level by all
cone cells, but at too low a level to be detected by in situ
hybridisation. It is thought that expression of the sws1
opsin gene is the default pathway for mouse cone cells
[24] and it could be that the sws2 message is the default in
eel cones. In this case, after the eel reaches a certain size,
the sws2 opsin transcript is turned off in most cells which
continue to express rh2 opsin and are spectrally identifiable as MWS cones, but is upregulated in specific cells
which then become detectable by in situ hybridisation as
sws2-expressing cells and by microspectrophotometry as
SWS cones. The calculated transcription copy numbers
suggested that the level of rh2 expression was approximately 40-fold higher for all stages than that for sws2,
which is in good agreement with the apparent 30-fold
fewer sws2 opsin-expressing cells seen by in situ hybridisation.
There are two possible mechanisms for the changes in
opsin gene expression. The most probable mechanism is
that the existing cone cell changes the opsin type it is
expressing. This is already known to occur in the rod cells
of eels when they switch from expression of fwo to expression of dso [25]. It has also been shown to occur in rainbow trout [26], where single cones change from
expression of sws1 to sws2 opsin. Alternatively, newly generated photoreceptors expressing the sws2 opsin could be
generated from Müller glial-associated retinal progenitors
that can function as multipotent retinal stem cells [26]
and inserted into the photoreceptor layer [27].

the retina at the glass eel stage. The sws2-expressing cones
appear later at the yellow eel stage as occasional cells
within this monolayer. The presence of two cone classes at
the later stages of pre-pubertal development is consistent
with a relatively broad-spectrum light environment
present in the rivers and estuaries that the eels occupy
prior to full sexual maturation and migration into the
deep ocean.

Methods
Animals
European eels (Anguilla anguilla L.) were obtained from
different sources according to their size. Glass eels were
obtained from http://www.glasseel.com. Elvers and small
yellow eels were collected by the authors from the river
Thames, with the permission of the Environment Agency.
Larger yellow eels were obtained from a registered Thames
eel fisherman (Gary Hillar). Very large yellow and silver
eels were obtained from Billingsgate fish market. All animals were treated in line with the guidelines laid out in
the code of practice for the housing and care of animals
used in scientific procedures (Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986). Animals that were not used immediately on arrival were maintained in large aerated tanks
with natural light or, if in a dark room, on a 12L:12D light
cycle using fluorescent aquarium light tubes. Immediately
before use animals were anaesthetised by immersion in
MS222 (1:2000 w/v in water) before being culled following standard procedures. Mature silver status was assessed
by eye and body length measurements which were fed
into the formula of Pankhurst [28], and only those animals with a Eye Index scores >6.5 were considered true silver eels.

Conclusions

Identification of gene sequences
Total RNA was isolated from the heads of glass eels, or
eyecups (lacking lenses) of slightly larger animals or the
retina/RPE of large animals, using Tri Reagent (Sigma).
The mRNA was transcribed into cDNA using the SMART
RACE Amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Opsin
sequences were PCR-amplified using degenerate primers
designed to conserved areas of opsin sequences. The 5'
and 3' ends were obtained by RACE using the anchor
primers in the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit
paired with specific primers designed to previously isolated sequence.

In this paper, we have shown that European eels express
only two classes of cone opsin, rh2 and sws2. The rh2 class
is expressed in young animals, whereas the sws2 opsin is
expressed only by older animals. Spectral analysis of in
vitro expressed pigments demonstrates that their absorbance peaks correspond to the values obtained by in situ
MSP for the MWS and SWS cones. This was further confirmed by in situ hybridization where it was shown that a
class of rh2-expressing cones is present as a monolayer in

In situ hybridisation
Eyes isolated from animals that had been culled following
standard procedures, were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, transferred to 30% sucrose and the lens
removed (from larger eyes). After overnight incubation in
sucrose they were snap frozen in OCT compound (Vector
Labs) and stored at -80°C before being sectioned on a cryostat.

T(easy) vector (Promega). The inserts were made into riboprobes labelled with DIG using the SP6/T7 Transcription
kit (Roche Ltd.). The DIG-labelled probes were hybridised
to 10μm frozen tissue sections and hybridised probe was
visualised using BM purple (Roche Ltd.). Sections were
examined using an Olympus BX50 microscope and photographs taken with a Nikon digital camera DXM 1200.

In vitro opsin expression
This was performed as previously described [33,34]. The
full-length coding region of the rh2 and sws2 opsins were
isolated by PCR using specific primers and cloned into the
eukaryotic expression plasmid pMT4. The resulting plasmid was used to transiently transfect HEK-293T cells. The
recombinant visual pigments were extracted and column
purified with the Rho1D4 antibody. Pigments were regenerated by incubation with 11-cis-retinal, and analysed by
a Spectronic Unicam UV500 dual-beam spectrophotometer. After 3 independent recordings, pigments were
bleached by exposure to bright fluorescent light for 30
minutes and re-analysed. The bleached pigment spectra
were subtracted from the dark spectra to produce a difference spectrum and a peak absorbance (λmax) value using
standard computer programs. The resulting visual spectra
were overlaid by visual pigment templates and best-fit
spectral curves were obtained.
Histology
Eyes for embedding in plastic were fixed in fresh 2% formaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS, dehydrated
through an ascending alcohol series and embedded in
Technovit 7100 resin (Heraeus), as per manufacturer's
instructions. After the blocks had hardened, sections were
cut at 2 μm on a microtome using a glass knife before
being stained with Richardson's stain and mounted in
DPX.

Authors' contributions
qPCR
The RNA extraction protocol followed was as above using
Tri Reagent (Sigma) or Trizol (Invitrogen), with mRNA
transcribed into cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen)
with oligo d(T) primer (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA
was prepared from 1 μg total RNA extracted from heads of
glass eels, or eyecups lacking lenses of larger fish. The visual pigments were quantified using gene-specific primers;
which were designed, using the primer 3 program on the
NCBI website, to amplify 300 bp fragments. Internal controls (housekeeping genes) used were as previously published: mitochondrial cytochrome b (intron-free) and
acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (ARP) from Welt-

All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.
The in vitro expression work was done by WLD who generated figure 2 and provided degenerate primers for the
lws and sws1 sequences. MS obtained the sequence of the
rh2 opsin, PBC isolated the sws2 sequence, performed the
ISH and qPCR, and initially drafted the manuscript. DMH
generated figure 1 and modified the manuscript; GJ, DMH
and JKB obtained the funding, and guided the project and
write-up of this manuscript.
