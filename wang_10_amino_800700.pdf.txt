Amino acid composition in endothermic
vertebrates is biased in the same direction
as in thermophilic prokaryotes
Guang-Zhong Wang, Martin J Lercher*

Abstract
Background: Among bacteria and archaea, amino acid usage is correlated with habitat temperatures. In particular,
protein surfaces in species thriving at higher temperatures appear to be enriched in amino acids that stabilize
protein structure and depleted in amino acids that decrease thermostability. Does this observation reflect a causal
relationship, or could the apparent trend be caused by phylogenetic relatedness among sampled organisms living
at different temperatures? And do proteins from endothermic and exothermic vertebrates show similar differences?
Results: We find that the observed correlations between the frequencies of individual amino acids and prokaryotic
habitat temperature are strongly influenced by evolutionary relatedness between the species analysed; however, a
proteome-wide bias towards increased thermostability remains after controlling for phylogeny. Do eukaryotes show
similar effects of thermal adaptation? A small shift of amino acid usage in the expected direction is observed in
endothermic (’warm-blooded’) mammals and chicken compared to ectothermic (’cold-blooded’) vertebrates with
lower body temperatures; this shift is not simply explained by nucleotide usage biases.
Conclusion: Protein homologs operating at different temperatures have different amino acid composition, both in
prokaryotes and in vertebrates. Thus, during the transition from ectothermic to endothermic life styles, the
ancestors of mammals and of birds may have experienced weak genome-wide positive selection to increase the
thermostability of their proteins.

Background
Evolutionary molecular biology is mostly concerned with
the forces affecting individual genes. However, observations of variable proportions of guanine and cytosine
(GC) in different species and in different genomic
regions of vertebrates [reviewed in [1,2]] have prompted
the analysis of forces that may affect the evolution of
complete genomes. One particular hypothesis concerns
adaptation to high temperatures, proposing that high
GC content results from selection favouring G:C pairs
over less stable A:T pairs [3]. Against initial expectations, there seems to be no direct relationship between
the GC content of prokaryotic protein-coding genes and
optimal growth temperature [4,5]. Similarly, in the case
of vertebrates, it was argued convincingly that the ‘isochore’ structure of high- and low-GC regions is not due

to selection, but reflects varying fixation biases of GC
over AT pairs in the presence of recombination [6,7].
A clear picture of selection at work emerges only in
the study of structured RNAs. The ribosomal RNAs and
transfer RNAs of prokaryotes living at high temperatures contain a much larger GC-fraction in their stem
regions compared to homologs from prokaryotes living
at more moderate temperatures [4,8], likely because GC pairs (with three hydrogen bonds) are more stable to
thermal fluctuations than A-U pairs (with only two
hydrogen bonds). A similar effect is seen in vertebrates:
the ribosomal RNA of endothermic (’warm-blooded’)
animals has a higher GC-content compared to that of
ectothermic (’cold-blooded’) vertebrates [8,9]. Thus,
RNAs that require a specific three-dimensional structure
to perform their function appear to be under selection
for increased thermostability in cellular environments
with elevated temperatures, consistent with the thermal
adaptation hypothesis.

However, a higher GC-content in structural RNAs of
thermophiles and hyperthermophiles may also have
arisen through reasons unrelated to environmental temperatures, e.g., random genetic drift or mutational
biases. Closely related species often have similar nucleotide composition and similar habitats simply due to
their descent from a common ancestor; a statistically
significant relationship between GC content and temperature across species might thus reflect nothing more
than a close phylogenetic relationship of these species.
This is not the case: even after controlling for phylogenetic relationships, the GC content of structural RNA
remains strongly correlated with optimal growth temperature [5]. Thus, genomic effects of thermal adaptation appear to exist at the structural but not the
sequence level.
Just like structural RNAs, proteins need to retain their
three-dimensional structure in the presence of thermal
fluctuations. It hence appears likely that the proteins of
thermophilic organisms show corresponding signs of
thermal adaptation. Several studies indeed report a correlation between amino acid usage and optimal growth
temperature of bacteria [10-14]; however, these studies
are based on amino acid usage patterns and not directly
on protein thermostability.
Two further analyses are based directly on large datasets of compositional comparisons that took protein
structure into account. In a careful study of biophysical
properties of a subset of proteins, Glyakina et al. [15]
confirmed that those amino acids that lead to stronger
electrostatic interactions in protein surfaces are enriched
among thermophiles, while certain amino acids that
tend to de-stabilise proteins are depleted. In another
large scale study of the surfaces of hyperthermophilic
proteins, Claverie et al. [16,17] found solvent accessible
charged residues to be strongly overrepresented, concluding that the resulting measure of CvP-bias was “the
sole criterion that is able to clearly discriminate
hyperthermophilic from mesothermophilic microorganisms on a global genomic basis”. The measures of amino
acid composition derived in the two studies are strongly
correlated, as they aim to measure the same phenomenon; they differ only in the treatment of three amino
acids.
Thus, amino acid sequence composition is correlated
with temperature. However, just as for the GC content
of structural RNAs, these correlations could simple be
due to the close phylogenetic relationships of some thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. Using the comparative
phylogenetic method [18], we show here that patterns of
amino acid usage between thermophiles, hyperthermophiles and mesophiles are indeed strongly affected by
phylogenetic relationships. Consequently, previous
results from direct sequence comparisons are partly

misleading. Reassuringly, the two measures of amino
acid bias that are derived from studies taking into
account the known structure of protein subsets [15,16]
are strongly correlated with optimal growth temperature
when extended to complete prokaryotic proteomes, even
after controlling for phylogenetic non-independence.
Can similar effects of thermal adaptation be seen in
higher eukaryotes? The proteins of mammals and birds,
which are endothermic species, operate at a speciesdependent constant temperature of 35-42° Celsius. This
temperature is significantly higher than the average temperature in fish or reptiles, which are ectothermic species. Thus, the same trends observed in prokaryotes may
also operate on vertebrate proteins: we hypothesize that
compared to ectothermic vertebrates, endothermic animals have proteins with an amino acid composition
biased in the same direction as in thermophilic
prokaryotes.
Physiological constraints on multi-cellular animals
mean that they cannot live at the temperatures in which
prokaryotic thermophiles thrive, and thus we expect
their amino acid compositions to be less biased. However, the relationship between amino acid composition
and thermal stability is approximately linear between
7°C and 103°C [19]. Thus, if thermal adaptation indeed
occurred in endothermic animals, it appears likely that
the same amino acids as in thermophilic prokaryotes are
involved, even if the relevant temperature differences in
eukaryotes are substantially smaller than in prokaryotes.
Here, we test this prediction using data from 5 fully
sequenced endothermic and 6 fully sequenced ectothermic vertebrates. We first demonstrate that the ERK
measure [15] of biased amino acid composition shows a
strong correlation with optimal growth temperature
when applied to genome-scale prokaryotic data, even
after controlling for phylogenetic relatedness (as does
the CvP-bias, see Additional file 1). We then proceed to
show that the same measures indicate a weak but statistically significant adaptation of protein thermostability
to elevated body temperature also in endothermic
vertebrates.

Results
Genome-wide bias in amino acid composition of
thermophilic prokaryotes

Based on careful structural alignments of 373 proteins,
Glyakina et al. [15] showed that among the external
residues of proteins from thermophilic prokaryotes,
three amino acids (E, R and K) are enriched, while
seven amino acids (D, N, Q, T, S, H and A) are depleted
compared to mesophilic prokaryotes. This effect is
quantified by the combined proportion ERK = E + R +
K - D - N - Q - T - S - H - A (where each letter
denotes the fraction of the respective amino acid among

Wang and Lercher BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:263

all amino acids in a given protein, added for the
enriched and subtracted for the depleted amino acids).
ERK is elevated for the exterior regions of proteins from
thermophiles compared to mesophiles [15].
It has not yet been tested if this measure, which was
developed from an analysis of external residues, is correlated with the optimal growth (or habitat) temperature
of individual species when applied to the full amino acid
sequences of complete proteomes [15]. Applying it to
complete amino acid sequences dilutes the signal from
the surfaces, but is not expected to lead to any systematic biases. To test this, we used a large set of whole genome sequence data and optimal growth temperature
(OGT, ranging from 8°C to 100°C) that was previously
compiled by Zeldovich et al. [20]. This data set contains
204 species (180 bacteria and 24 archaea), of which 16
are hyperthermophiles (optimal growth temperature
OGT ≥ 80°C), 11 are thermophiles (OGT = 50-80°C),
and 177 are mesophiles (OGT ≤ 50°C). In agreement
with earlier observations on the surface regions of a
subset of genes [15], we find a strong correlation
between the mean ERK of complete proteomes and

Page 3 of 10

optimal growth temperature (Figure 1, Pearson’s R =
0.72, p < 10-15; Spearman’s r = 0.46, p = 10-12). Analogous results are obtained using CvP-bias, a very similar
alternative measure of temperature-related amino acid
usage (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1, Pearson’s R = 0.69, p < 10-15; Spearman’s r = 0.31, p = 5.2 ×
10-6).
As evident from Figure1, this correlation can mostly
be attributed to strong differences between hyperthermophiles, thermophiles, and mesophiles (Wilcoxon rank
sum tests: p = 2 × 10-5 between hyperthermophiles and
thermophiles, p = 0.00059 between thermophiles and
mesophiles, and p = 4 × 10-11 between hyperthermophiles and mesophiles; see also Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S2). However, despite large variation in
amino acid composition among mesophiles (Figure 1),
we do still see a significant correlation of ERK with optimal growth temperature among prokaryotes living at
moderate temperatures (between 8°C and 50°C; Pearson’s R = 0.23, p = 0.0017; Spearman’s r = 0.21, p =
0.0045). This is in agreement with a detailed study on
the properties of six proteins from 42 microorganism

prokaryotes (Pearson’s R = 0.72, p = 10-15; Spearman’s r = 0.46, p = 10-12). See Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S1 for a correlated
alternative measure of amino acid usage bias.

living at temperatures ranging from 7°C to 103°C, which
found that compositional features related to thermoadaptation increase almost linearly with temperature
[19].
Amino acid usage patterns are strongly affected by
phylogeny

An appreciable number of species in each of the
hyperthermophile, thermophile, and mesophile categories are very closely related to each other. The corresponding data points in Figure 1 are thus not
statistically independent, and simple correlation statistics
as reported above may be misleading. We thus
employed the comparative phylogenetic method, which
calculates statistically independent contrasts [18]; this
eliminates correlations due to common descent. Controlling for phylogenetic relatedness indeed leads to very
different patterns of amino acid enrichment/depletion
compared to simple correlations (Table 1). In particular,
the amino acids A, E, H, I, K, W, and Y, which show
significant positive or negative correlations with temperature in a naïve analysis, do not show any significant
correlations after controlling for phylogenetic non-independence. In contrast, C, M, N, P, and S, which do not
show significant correlations with temperature in the
naïve analysis, show significant correlations after including phylogeny into the statistical model (Table 1).

In the naïve analysis, there are 6 amino acids (A,D,H,
Q,T,W) which are correlated negatively with growth
temperature, while 4 amino acids (E,I,K,Y) are correlated
positively with growth temperature. After controlling for
phylogenetic non-independence, 7 amino acids (C,D,M,
N,Q,S,T) are correlated negatively with growth temperature, while only 2 amino acids (R and P) are enriched at
high temperatures. Thus, the temperature-related patterns seen for individual amino acids depend strongly
on evolutionary history. However, we found that ERK
and CvP- bias, which were both derived including consideration of the protein structure, are still strongly correlated with temperature even after controlling for
phylogeny (Spearman’s r = 0.45, p = 1.2 × 10-10 and r =
0.60, p = 4.1 × 10-20, respectively). These results further
underline the importance of structural rather than
sequence properties in thermal adaptation.
Organisms living at different ambient temperatures
may have different protein repertoires, and thus comparisons of complete genomes are potentially misleading. To circumvent this problem, we performed a
complementary analysis restricted to groups of orthologous proteins. We collected amino acid sequence data
from 5 species each of hyperthermophiles, thermophiles,
and mesophiles (Additional file 1: Supplemental Table
S1). Using reciprocal best blast hits, we retained only
proteins in each group (hyperthermophiles, thermophiles, mesophiles) that had orthologs in at least one of
the other groups (see Methods for details). Comparing
the remaining 15293 proteins among groups, it is again
clear that ERKhyperthermophiles >ERKthermophiles >ERKmeso-15
in all
philes (Figure 2; Wilcoxon rank sum tests: p < 10
pair-wise comparisons). Thus, we confirmed that ERK,
even when applied to complete amino acid sequences
on a genomic scale, is a useful predictor of temperature
adaptation in prokaryotes. In the remainder of this
paper, we use ERK to test for a corresponding effect in
vertebrates. We repeated all analyses using the CvP-bias
[21], in each case obtaining qualitatively very similar
results (see Additional file 1); however, as ERK and CvPbias differ only in the treatment of three amino acids,
these two measures are not statistically independent.
Endothermic vertebrates have biased amino acid usage

Just as in prokaryotes, the body temperatures of fish,
amphibians, and reptiles are closely linked to ambient
temperatures. Consequently, the proteins of these
ectothermic or ‘cold-blooded’ vertebrates usually operate
below 30° Celsius (Table 2). In contrast, endothermic or
‘warm-blooded’ vertebrates (mammals and birds) have a
thermoregulation system which keeps their body temperatures at a species-specific constant 35-42° Celsius.
Does this relatively small difference in temperature
between endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates result

in a discernible selection pressure for increased thermal
stability of proteins? If so, we expect to see compositional biases in the same direction as in prokaryotes, as
the rules connecting amino acid usage and thermostability appear to apply across the complete temperature
range encountered by life [19].
To test this hypothesis of vertebrate thermo-adaptation, we obtained a total of 335,841 protein sequences
from 11 sequenced species. This included four mammals: human, rat (Rattus norvegicus), mouse (Mus musculus), and cow (Bos taurus); one bird (the chicken
Gallus gallus); one reptile (the lizard Anolis carolinensis), two amphibia (the frogs Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis), and three fish (Danio rerio, Tetraodon
nigroviridis, and Takifugu rubripes). Analysing the combined amino acid composition of the complete proteomes, we indeed find a small but statistically highly
significant shift in ERK of endothermic compared to
ectothermic vertebrates (Figure 3; Wilcoxon rank sum
test: p < 10-15). As shown in Figure 4, there is a strong
correlation between the compositional bias of amino
acids and the temperature at which the proteins of the
species typically act (Pearson’s R = 0.72, p = 0.01). Consistent with our hypothesis, this correlation is mostly

Compositional bias (ERK)
Figure 3 Amino acid usage differs between endothermic and ectothermic vertebrates. Distribution of amino acid usage bias, ERK, across
proteins for endothermic vertebrates (mammals, birds) and ectothermic (’cold-blooded’) vertebrates (reptiles, amphibia, fish). ERK is significantly
increased in endothermic relative to ectothermic animals (Wilcoxon rank sum test: p < 10-15). See Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure S4 for a
correlated alternative measure of amino acid usage bias.

due to a systematic difference between ectothermic and
endothermic vertebrates (Figure 4).
Again, we confirmed this result by restricting the analysis to orthologous proteins. Among the ectothermic
species considered, Anolis carolinensis is the closest relative to the endothermic animals and was thus chosen as
the reference genome. We identified orthologous proteins in each of the other 10 genomes as reciprocal best
blast hits against Anolis carolinensis. In pair-wise comparisons (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Additional
file 1: Supplemental Table S2), all five endothermic species show a significantly higher average ERK compared
to orthologous proteins in Anolis carolinensis (p < 0.002
in each comparison), while this is not the case for any
of our amphibia or fish (p > 0.08 in each comparison).
However, individual proteins in a single species are
not truly independent data points, as species-specific
compositional biases unrelated to temperature may
exist. We thus performed an additional analysis, which
treated the average ERK across 399 orthologs as a single
data point for each of our 11 species. ERK is significantly higher for the mammal/bird group compared to

the ectothermic group (p = 0.0075, Wilcoxon rank sum
test on genomic averages, Table 2).
Just as in the prokaryotic analysis, treating closely
related species (such as the four mammals) as independent data points could be misleading: similar compositional biases might be due to common descent rather
than common physiology. We thus repeated the genome-wide analysis of amino acid bias using the comparative phylogenetic method of independent contrasts.
Despite the small sample size, we still find a statistically
significant correlation between amino acid bias and temperature after controlling for phylogenetic relatedness
(Pearson’s R = 0.35, p = 0.049 for ERK, and Pearson’s
R = 0.70, p = 0.022 for CvP-bias).
Chicken have elevated ERK compared to reptiles

Of all ectothermic animal classes, reptiles - which are
paraphyletic due to the exclusion of birds - are the closest living relatives to endothermic vertebrates. Thus, we
wanted to confirm that the elevated ERK values are
indeed restricted to endothermic animals, by comparing
the chicken genome to several hundred recently

published protein segments of three further reptilia [22].
Based on best blast hits of the segments against the
chicken genome, we constructed 508 protein segment
alignments between Alligator mississippiensis and
chicken, 429 segment alignments between Chrysemys
picta (a turtle) and chicken, and 138 segment alignments between Anolis smaragdinus (another lizard) and
chicken. ERK in chicken protein segments is significantly higher than in each of the three reptilia species
(Wilcoxon rank sum tests: p = 4 × 10-16 for the alligator, p = 0.00027 for the lizard, and p = 0.011 for the turtle; see Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S3).
Elevated ERK is not due to biased GC content

The strongest known predictor of amino acid composition at the genomic scale is the GC content of the coding DNA sequences [2,23]. Thus, it is conceivable that
the biased amino acid composition (higher ERK) in
endothermic vertebrates is due to GC content variation
between the genomes of endothermic and ectothermic
vertebrates. However, for the 339 co-orthologs studied
here, there are no differences in the usage of AT-rich or
of GC-rich codons between endothermic and ectothermic genomes (Wilcoxon rank sum tests: p = 0.25 for

AT-rich codons and p = 0.13 for GC-rich codons, Table
2).
To further exclude GC content as a confounding factor, we investigated 6227 aligned orthologous coding
sequences of human and Danio rerio in more detail. As
expected, the human genes encoded proteins with significantly higher ERK values than their Danio orthologs
(Wilcoxon rank sum test: p < 10-15). If these differences
in ERK could be fully explained by variation in GC content, we would not expect to see different ERK values if
we restrict our analysis to those aligned codons that
have the same GC content in human and Danio. Contrary to this expectation, we still see higher ERK in the
human sequences on these GC-neutral codons (Wilcoxon rank sum test: p < 10-15). Thus, the differences in
amino acid composition cannot be simply explained by
differences in GC content.
Elevated ERK is not due to purine loading

Secondary structures of RNA sequences are built by the
formation of hydrogen bonds between purines (adenine
and guanine) and their complementary pyrimidines
(uracil and cytosine, respectively). Purine loading, i.e.,
the over-representation of purines in coding sequences,

Wang and Lercher BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:263
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/263

thus reduces the potential for self-interactions of the
mRNA. As self-interactions can interfere with translation, purine loading may be a selected molecular trait.
Purine loading is found in almost all prokaryotes, and is
positively correlated with optimal growth temperature
[reviewed in [2]]. As biased nucleotide composition can
lead to biased amino acid composition [2,23], it is conceivable that the observed elevated ERK levels in
endothermic vertebrates may be a consequence of purine loading.
To exclude purine loading as a confounding factor, we
employed an analogous strategy as for GC content.
When we restrict the alignments of the 6227 human Danio rerio orthologs to those codons with the same
purine content, we still observe a significantly higher
ERK value in the human sequences (Wilcoxon rank sum
test: p < 10-15). Thus, the biased amino acid composition of proteins from endothermic vertebrates cannot be
attributed to purine loading alone.

Discussion
Building upon earlier results on aligned structures of
prokaryotic protein pairs [15,16], we show that genomewide amino acid usage biases (measured by ERK or
CvP) correlates strongly with the optimal growth temperature of bacteria. That ERK and CvP measures are
derived directly from physicochemical considerations
[15,16] strengthens the notion that it is indeed selection
on thermostability which is responsible for this longrecognised trend. While the enrichment or depletion of
individual amino acids in (hyper-)thermophilic species is
strongly affected by phylogenetic non-independence, the
overall biases measured by ERK and CvP are robust.
Applying the same methodology to 11 vertebrate species, we find that mammalian and bird proteomes show
a weak but significant increase in ERK and CvP-bias
compared to ectothermic fish, amphibia and reptilia.
This increase cannot simply be explained by biases in
nucleotide composition, and remains statistically significant when controlling for phylogenetic non-independence. While the examined dataset of genome
sequences is necessarily small and not evenly sampled
across vertebrates, we thus have strong evidence for a
direct relationship between amino acid bias and the
temperature at which vertebrate proteins operate. Analogous to the situation in prokaryotes, our findings are
most parsimoniously explained by selection for
increased stability against thermal fluctuations in
endothermic vertebrates. Why then do we not see a correlation of amino acid usage bias with environmental
temperature when considering only ectothermic vertebrates (open circles in Figure 4, Pearson’s R = -0.20, p =
0.77)? Apart from an issue of small sample size, this
lack of a correlation may be due to the fact that

ectothermic vertebrates can rapidly switch between
habitats of different temperatures during evolution. This
is evident, e.g., from the two Xenopus species in our
study, which thrive at 18-22 and 23-28°C, respectively
(Table 2).
It should be pointed out that ectotherms are not
necessarily cold-blooded, i.e., body temperature in some
ectothermic species can reach temperatures as high or
higher as in endotherms. Furthermore, internal temperature can vary between different body regions of an
ectotherm, and can be above the outside temperature
[24]. However, the temperatures listed in Table 2 are
‘optimal’ temperatures for these species, and internal
temperatures will indeed be close to these values. On
average, body temperature in endotherms is higher than
in ectotherms, and has likely remained stable since the
last common ancestors of mammals and of birds.
A shift towards stability-increasing amino acids in proteins of endothermic vertebrates mirrors similar effects
seen for the nucleotide composition of structural RNAs
[9]. While the effect for structural RNAs appears to be
much stronger, this may not be surprising: RNA structures
are formed by direct bonds between complementary bases,
G-C bonds being more stable than A-T bonds. Thus, thermostability of RNAs is directly related to the GC fraction
of sites involved in bond formation. The effect of individual amino acids on the thermostability of proteins is
much more subtle: the relevance of different physicochemical properties of amino acids depends on their threedimensional context within the protein structure. The
subtleness of this effect was already seen in prokaryotic
proteins (Figure 1), where we found only a weak (though
significant) correlation of amino acid usage bias with optimal growth temperature among mesophiles.

Conclusions
Taken together, our results indicate weak but significant
genome-wide positive selection on protein structure
during the change from ectothermic to endothermic life
styles in vertebrates. This molecular process may have
been very similar to the adaptation of microorganisms
that switch from mesophilic to thermophilic life styles
[25], except that the temperature differences involved
were much smaller.
Methods
Data sources

The genomes of prokaryotic species were obtained from
NCBI ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria. Optimal
growth temperatures were taken from Mizuguchi et al.
[26] and Suhre and Claverie [17], except for Chloroflexus aurantiacus J-10-fl, which was obtained from
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/finished_microbes/chlau/chlau.

Genome sequences for Bos taurus, Danio rerio, Gallus
gallus, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus,
Xenopus laevis, Xenopus tropicalis, Danio rerio Tetraodon nigroviridis, and Takifugu rubripes were obtained
from NCBI ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/ and
ENSEMBL http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/. Protein sequences of Anolis carolinensis were downloaded
from the superfamily database http://supfam.mrc-lmb.
cam.ac.uk/SUPERFAMILY/index.html. Three sets of
non-avian reptile protein coding sequences were taken
from Shedlock et al. [22].
Calculation of amino acid usage bias in prokaryotes

For each protein in each of the 204 prokaryotic species,
we calculated ERK = E + R + K - D - N - Q - T - S H - A; here each capital letter on the right hand side
stands for the proportion of this amino acid relative to
all amino acids in the protein sequence [15]. Total ERK
for each species was obtained analogously from the concatenated sequences of all proteins. As an alternative
measure of amino acid usage bias, we similarly calculated CvP-bias = D + E + R + K - N - Q - T - S [21].
To control for biases in gene repertoires of the different
life styles, we first chose 5 representative species from
each life style group (hyperthermophiles with optimal
growth temperature OGT ≥ 80°C, thermophiles with
OGT = 50-80°C, and mesophiles with OGT ≤ 50°C). For
these 15 species, we performed an all-against-all protein
blast search, identifying pair-wise orthologs through reciprocal best blast hits. We then excluded all proteins that
had no orthologs outside their group (hyperthermophiles,
thermophiles, mesophiles). All remaining proteins had at
least one ortholog outside their life style group, and
where hence retained for our comparison (Additional file
1: Supplemental Table S1). We then compared mean
ERK values between groups using Wilcoxon rank sum
tests.

109 species with OGT ranging from 15-100°C were
included (Additional file 1: Supplemental Table S4). The
phylogenetic tree for these 109 species was obtained
from the Tree of Life project [27]. Branches of length 0
were set to 0.00003, which is half the length of the
shortest non-zero branches.
To apply the comparative phylogenetic method to the
vertebrate data, we first reconstructed the phylogenetic
tree. Multiple alignments of the 399 co-orthologs across
the 11 species were obtained using Muscle [28]. We
eliminated poorly aligned positions with Gblocks [29]. A
phylogenetic tree of these 11 vertebrates was constructed from the contatenated amino acid sequences
with Phyml [30] using standard settings.
We employed a randomization test to assess statistical
significance of the correlation between the independent
contrasts. We first calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient R for the contrasts of temperature (Table 2) and
ERK. We then randomised the association between the
two types of contrasts and re-calculated the correlation
coefficient Rrand. This was repeated 9999 times; in 498
randomised data sets Rrand. was equal to or larger than
R. Treating the observed data as an additional data
point, the p-value of the correlation was then estimated
as 499/10000.
Comparison of Chicken with three non-avian reptiles

Based on well-aligning best blast hits of protein segments against the chicken genome (protein blast e-value
< 10-5), we constructed 508 protein segment alignments
between Alligator mississippiensis and chicken, 429 segment alignments between Chrysemys picta (a turtle) and
chicken, and 138 segment alignments between Anolis
smaragdinus (another lizard) and chicken. As before,
ERK and CvP-bias were calculated for each aligned
segment.
GC content and purine content as confounding factors

Calculation of amino acid usage bias in 11 vertebrates

ERK and CvP-bias were calculated as for prokaryotes.
As reptiles are the closest relatives of endothermic animals in our set of ectothermic species, we chose the
lizard Anolis carolinensis as a reference point. We first
identified orthologous protein pairs between Anolis and
each of the other 10 vertebrates through a search for
reciprocal best blast hits. If an Anolis carolinensis protein had orthologs in each of the other ten genomes, we
included this protein in our co-ortholog list, resulting in
339 groups of ubiquitous orthologs.
Application of the comparative phylogenetic method

To control for phylogenetic non-independence, we calculated independent contrast using the AOT module
implemented in the software Phylocom [18]. In total,

To check if nucleotide content variation could explain
the higher ERK values in endothermic compared to
ectothermic vertebrates, we performed a detailed analysis of orthologs between human and Danio rerio. Orthologs were identified from reciprocal best blast hits. We
aligned the translated orthologous protein sequences
using MUSCLE [28] with default settings, and then
replaced the aligned amino acids with their encoding
codons to obtain DNA alignments.
To exclude the influence of differences in GC content
between human and Danio on amino acid usage, we
then re-calculated ERK from only those aligned codons
that had the same G+C content in both species. Similarly, to exclude the influence of differences in purine
content, we re-calculated ERK from only those codons
that had the same A+G content in both species.
