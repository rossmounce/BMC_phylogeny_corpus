Abstract
Background: Nucleoplasmin is a nuclear chaperone protein that has been shown to participate
in the remodeling of sperm chromatin immediately after fertilization by displacing highly specialized
sperm nuclear basic proteins (SNBPs), such as protamine (P type) and protamine-like (PL type)
proteins, from the sperm chromatin and by the transfer of histone H2A-H2B. The presence of
SNBPs of the histone type (H type) in some organisms (very similar to the histones found in somatic
tissues) raises uncertainty about the need for a nucleoplasmin-mediated removal process in such
cases and poses a very interesting question regarding the appearance and further differentiation of
the sperm chromatin remodeling function of nucleoplasmin and the implicit relationship with SNBP
diversity The amphibians represent an unique opportunity to address this issue as they contain
genera with SNBPs representative of each of the three main types: Rana (H type); Xenopus (PL type)
and Bufo (P type).
Results: In this work, the presence of nucleoplasmin in oocyte extracts from these three
organisms has been assessed using Western Blotting. We have used mass spectrometry and cloning
techniques to characterize the full-length cDNA sequences of Rana catesbeiana and Bufo marinus
nucleoplasmin. Northern dot blot analysis shows that nucleoplasmin is mainly transcribed in the
egg of the former species. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleoplasmin family members from various
metazoans suggests that amphibian nucleoplasmins group closely with mammalian NPM2 proteins.
Conclusion: We have shown that these organisms, in striking contrast to their SNBPs, all contain
nucleoplasmins with very similar primary structures. This result has important implications as it
suggests that nucleoplasmin's role in chromatin assembly during early zygote development could
have been complemented by the acquisition of a new function of non-specifically removing SNBPs
in sperm chromatin remodeling. This acquired function would have been strongly determined by
the constraints imposed by the appearance and differentiation of SNBPs in the sperm.

Background
Nucleoplasmin was initially isolated from African clawed
frog (Xenopus laevis) egg extracts and it was described as an
acidic chaperone protein capable of assembling nucleosomes [1,2]. Indeed, it represents the "archetypal" molecular chaperone [3] and is certainly the first of a long list of
chromatin assembly complexes that have been, and still
are, the focus of much research attention [4,5]. In the egg,
nucleoplasmin is found natively bound to histones H2A
and H2B, facilitating the storage of these proteins [3,6,7].
Nucleoplasmin is the most abundant protein in Xenopus
oocytes. It is a highly thermostable protein and is very rich
in acidic amino acids (approx pI = 5). It consists of
approximately 200 amino acids and exists as a pentamer
[2,8]. The first 120 N-terminal amino acids contain a
small acidic cluster and exhibit a highly organized secondary and tertiary structure and constitute the "core" of the
protein that is responsible for the formation of the pentameric structure of the molecule. By contrast, the last 80 Cterminal amino acids are sensitive to protease digestion,
highly unstructured, and hence correspond to the "tails"
of the protein. These regions contain two polyglutamic
clusters, one of which spans 20 amino acids, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal [9].
In vivo, nucleoplasmin has been shown to mediate the X.
laevis sperm decondensation in the egg cytoplasm that
takes place immediately after fertilization [10]. This process involves the binding of the X. laevis SNBPs and transfer
of H2A-H2B to the sperm chromatin [10]. The protein
exchange is enhanced by the dramatic increase in phosphorylation undergone by the protein [11] (up to 14–20
phosphates per nucleoplasmin monomer [12]) during the
maturation of the oocyte into the unfertilized egg [7].
High levels of phosphorylation remain until the mid-blastula transition (MBT), following which the levels drop off
[11].
SNBPs can be classified in three major groups (H, P and
PL) according to their compositional and structural
organization [13,14]. The histone type H consists, as its
name indicates, of proteins which are very similar to the
histones that are found associated with DNA in somatic
chromatin complexes [15]. The protamine type P includes
a group of highly specialized arginine-rich sperm chromosomal proteins of relatively small molecular mass (≤
10,000) [16]. The protamine-like type encompasses a
highly structurally heterogeneous group of proteins with
intermediate composition between protamines and histones (lysine- and arginine-rich) which are evolutionarily
related to histone H1 [13,17].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/99

that coexist with an H2A-H2B deficient complement of
histones H3 and H4 [18]. It is important to mention
though, that this composition varies significantly between
different species of Xenopus which in some instances only
contain SP1-2 (such as in X. tropicalis) and more often
than not contain a stoichiometric complement of nucleosomal H2A-H2B and H3-H4 [18].
In contrast to the SP1-SP6 proteins from X. laevis that have
an amino acid composition intermediate between histones and protamines and hence belong to the PL type
[13], the toad Bufo contains protamines in its sperm that
are very rich in arginine and can be considered representatives of the vertebrate P type SNBP [19]. In the frog Rana,
the mature sperm contains histones that are almost indistinguishable from the somatic counterparts as is characteristic of the H type [20,21].
If nucleoplasmin is involved in sperm chromatin remodeling during fertilization [22], the existence of three main
types of structurally and compositionally different SNBP
raises the question of whether there are three different
nucleoplasmins specific for each of these types or
whether, in contrast to SNBPs, nucleoplasmin is a highly
conserved molecule. Amphibians provide a unique
opportunity to address this question as the group contains
representative organisms of each of the main SNBP types.
In this paper we have characterized the structure of the
Xenopus nucleoplasmin gene as well as the complete
sequences of both the Bufo marinus and Rana catesbeiana
nucleoplasmin cDNAs. The analysis of these sequences
shows that nucleoplasmin is indeed a highly conserved
protein that is closely related to mammalian NPM2, and
suggests that its functional role goes beyond chromatin
assembly immediately after fertilization, into the early
stages of development. We propose that nucleoplasmin
may have acquired the function of SNBP removal after fertilization in many vertebrates because of the appearance
and vertical evolution of SNBPs.

Results
Ubiquitous presence of nucleoplasmin in the eggs of
amphibians
As it can be seen in Figure 1A–C, R. catesbeiana sperm contains only core histones that, except for the histone H1
counterpart, exhibited identical electrophoretic mobility
to those of somatic histones (Fig. 1A–C, lane 3). Indeed,
the sperm of this amphibian has been shown to consist of
core histones that have amino acid compositions identical
to those of somatic tissues and a set of highly specific
linker histones with similar composition to histone H1
[21].

The SNBPs of X. laevis consist of a structurally heterogeneous mixture of protamine-like proteins named SP1-SP6

called sperm-specific proteins (SP1-6), are labeled and arrows (<) are used when needed to clearly indicate which bands the

In contrast to R. catesbeiana, the SNBPs of X. laevis in testis
showed the presence of a complex mixture of SNBPs of
the PL type (SP1-SP6) [18] (Fig. 1B, lane 5), which in the
mature sperm coexist with a H3-H4 complement. Alternatively, B. marinus contained a typical vertebrate protamine
[19,20] (Fig. 1B, lane 6). Thus, the protein composition of
the sperm chromatin of these organisms is very different.
With the exception of X. laevis nucleoplasmin, which has
been extensively characterized and has been for many
years used as a generic prototype for nucleoplasmin, only
fractional information is available on Bufo nucleoplasmin
[23] and very little is known about its existence in Rana
[24]. Therefore, we took advantage of an antibody developed in our lab against recombinant X. laevis nucleoplasmin to identify the nucleoplasmin-like proteins in egg
extracts of these two organisms. The candidate bands from
gels were then used to obtain some partial protein
sequence information in order to further confirm the
bands identity and to produce primers that would allow
us to obtain the complete cDNA sequences of these proteins.

One of the distinctive features of nucleoplasmin is its ability to retain its native pentameric conformation (Mr =
110,000) in the presence of the SDS used in the sample
buffer of SDS-PAGE [25]. The monomeric subunit can
only be visualized after extensive (ca. 10 min) boiling in
the presence of the SDS (1%) sample buffer. We exploited
this highly characteristic property in order to analyze the
egg extracts from X. laevis, B. marinus and R. catesbeiana.
Figure 2 shows the results of unboiled (Fig. 2A) and
boiled (Fig. 2B) extracts separated by SDS-PAGE (upper
panels). The presence of nucleoplasmin was assessed by
Western blot analysis using an antibody against X. laevis
recombinant nucleoplasmin (Fig. 2, lower panels) [26].
For all three extracts a higher molecular weight form corresponding to the pentamer was seen in the unboiled
samples (Fig. 2A) which dissociated into monomers following boiling in SDS sample buffer (Fig. 2B). Note that
X. laevis and B. marinus exhibited a smeared band in the
region of the SDS-PAGE corresponding to the pentameric
form, a fact that can be attributed to either differences in
the extent of phosphorylation or the incorrect folding of
the pentamer. In addition, due to its highly charged

protein and also to determine the hitherto unknown primary structure of Bufo nucleoplasmin. To this end,
nuclear extracts were purified as described in the experimental section and the extent of purity of the fractions
was monitored by SDS-PAGE Western analysis. Bands for
the B. marinus and R. catesbeiana nucleoplasmins, such as
those shown in Figure 2, were excised and analyzed by
mass spectroscopy to obtain partial protein sequence
information. This information, together with the nucleotide sequence available from the genome draft of X. tropicalis for the nucleoplasmin gene (assigned name:
ESTEXT_FGENESH1_PG.C_340042 at [27]), was used to
generate primers to be used in conjunction with mRNA
prepared from both R. catesbeiana and B. marinus egg
extracts.

Although the presence of nucleoplasmin in Bufo had
already been well documented [23], the presence of a
nucleoplasmin-like equivalent protein in Rana had never
been demonstrated, despite the fact it was known that
Rana egg extracts had the ability to decondense demembranated sperm nuclei from Xenopus [24]. The results of
Figure 2 encouraged us to pursue the isolation of such a

tropicalis [GenBank: NM_001016938] and the corresponding organization of the gene, which contains of 9
introns, is shown in Figure 3B. A very similar organization
was found in the case of the X. laevis nucleoplasmin gene
when it was analyzed using the genomic DNA of this species and primers designed based on the cDNA sequence
(results not shown).

We also established the complete cDNA sequences for one
of the nucleoplasmin genes from each B. marinus [Genbank: DQ340657] and R. catesbeiana [Genbank:
DQ340656] which were submitted to GeneBank December, 2005 (Fig. 4A–B). The precise number of nucleoplasmin genes in each genome has not yet been determined.
However, two different cDNAs have been isolated from X.
laevis that encode for two almost identical forms of the
protein, except for the fact that one of them is 9 amino
acids shorter [28] than the other [29]. It is thus possible
that at least one other cDNA sequence besides those
shown in Figure 4 is present in each of these species. Nevertheless, mass spectroscopic determination of the nucleoplasmin proteins purified by us from the egg extracts,
confirmed that the proteins encoded by the cDNAs shown
in Figure 4 correspond to the main translated mRNA
forms (results not shown).
The comparison of the amino acid sequences for the different amphibian nucleoplasmin proteins is shown in Figure 5. As it can be seen, the protein sequence is extremely
conserved (approximately 75 % identity) among the different amphibian species analyzed. Hence, it is to be

expected that these proteins all have a common closely
related function across these species.
Amphibian nucleoplasmin is closely related to mammalian
NPM2
It is possible to use the sequence information shown in
Figure 5 in the context of all the nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin metazoan sequences to determine the phylogenetic relationships of their main families: NPM1, NPM2,
and NPM3 (Fig. 6). NPM1 includes a set of nucleoplasmin-like proteins, also referred to as nucleophosmin,
which localize to the nucleolus of somatic cells and have
been implicated numerous cellular processes including
ribosome biogenesis [30], centrosome duplication [31]
and nuclear chaperoning [32,33]. NPM1 variants have an
important role in embryonic development and mutations
of the genes encoding these proteins have been shown to
be involved in acute myeloid leukemia [34]. NPM2 and

NPM3 are nuclear chaperone proteins. The latter is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues [35] in contrast to
NPM2 which is only found in oocytes and eggs [36].
Mammalian NPM2 has been shown to play a critical role
in nucleolar and nuclear organization and plays an
important role in the maintenance of the perinuclear heterochromatin which is usually observed in eggs and early
embryos [36]. Although Npm3 antisense oligonucleotides
injected into mammalian oocytes significantly prevented
histone assembly and male pronuclear formation [37],
the molecular components involved in the sperm chromatin remodeling after fertilization in mammals still
remains largely unknown.
As shown by Figure 6 and not surprisingly, the four
amphibian sequences cluster together in this analysis.
They are in turn grouped with NPM2 opposed to family
members in NPM1 and NPM3 or the insect nucleoplas-

min-like proteins. Although amphibian nucleoplasmins
group with mammalian NPM2 relative to other family
members, they are in distinct clusters of the evolutionary
analysis. In addition, broader evolutionary analyses
(manuscript in preparation) reveal a polyphyletic origin
for the NPM2 lineage, which maybe due to the differentiation between amphibians (SNBPs of H, PL, and P-types)
and mammals (SNBPs of the P-type).
R. catesbeiana nucleoplasmin is mainly expressed in
oocytes
In order to put the phylogenetic implications into a functional perspective, we made RNA extracts from different
tissues of R. catesbeiana and the levels of expression of
nucleoplasmin and nucleophosmin were assessed using
dot blot Northern hybridization (Fig. 7). Of the three genera of amphibians studied here, we chose Rana for this

analysis because we reasoned that the presence of canonical histones in the mature sperm of this organism makes
it unlikely that the major function of nucleoplasmin is
that of remodeling of the male pronucleus chromatin.
The results obtained are similar to those obtained with
other vertebrate species. As expected from its generic participation in ribosome biogenesis, nucleophosmin was
widely distributed throughout the different tissues analyzed (Fig. 7) with different levels of expression which
likely reflect their ribosome assembly nucleolar activity.
In contrast, nucleoplasmin (Fig. 7) mRNA appeared to be
primarily transcribed in the egg, a result which is consistent with the results reported for other species [9,36].
Although some background is observed in the lane of dots
corresponding to the nucleoplasmin tissue distribution,
this appears to follow the same pattern of distribution

observed for nucleophosmin and it is likely the result of
the some cross hybridization of the nucleoplasmin and
nucleophosmin probes.
Thus, like mammalian nucleoplasmin, amphibian NPM2
is predominantly expressed in the oocyte nuclei were it
likely accumulates and persists throughout the first stages
of early development [36]. In the case of mammals,
NPM2 participates in different roles from nucleolar organization to chromatin remodeling [36].

Discussion
In the introduction we put forward a question regarding
the specificity of nucleoplasmin within the functional
context of its participation in the remodeling of sperm
chromatin with different types of SNBPs (see Fig. 8).
The results described in the previous section show that
within amphibians, nucleoplasmin is a highly conserved
protein (Fig. 2 and Figs. 4, 5) in contrast to the structural
and compositional heterogeneity of the SNBPs (Fig. 1).
This suggests that the removal of SNBPs is a highly nonspecific process, a notion that is further reinforced by the
observation that nucleoplasmin binds equally well to protamines [25,38], protamine-like proteins [9,38,39] and
somatic linker histones [39]in vitro. The non-specificity of
the sperm chromatin remodeling process (Fig. 8) is also
supported by the observations that different egg extracts
appear to be interchangeable in terms of their ability to
decondense sperm chromatin[7]. In addition, the normal

progression of sperm DNA decondensation in NPM2-null
embryos in mice suggests that other related proteins
(either NPM1 or NPM3) may even be able to compensate
in this process [36]. It is possible that the polyglutamic
tracts of nucleoplasmin in conjunction with phosphorylation play a critical role in out-competing the electrostatic
interaction between the highly positively charged SNBPs
and DNA in sperm chromatin [9].
The lack of specificity with which nucleoplasmin removes
SNBPs during the formation of the male pronuclei (Fig. 8)
contrasts with the specificity implicit in the binding of
H2A and H2B histones during the early stages of development of the zygote. While the molecule has a conserved
binding site highly specific for histones [8], which is most
likely stereo-specific [40] and involves the highly structured N-terminal part of the molecule [8], the binding of
SNBPs is quite non-specific and it probably involves the
glutamic acid rich domains that become overexposed
when the molecule becomes phosphorylated during
oocyte maturation [41]. Indeed, nucleoplasmin is found
associated with H2A-H2B in the egg [1], a property that
originally led to the first time coining of the term molecular chaperone to describe this molecule [1,3,7]. Our
results suggest that in addition to X. laevis, whose sperm
chromatin is deficient in H2A-H2B [10], nucleoplasmin
contributes the H2A-H2B dimers during the formation of
the male pronuclei in other vertebrate organisms regardless of the initial SNBP composition of the male chromatin during fertilization. Other assembly factors such as

Phylogenetic tree of nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin family members from various metazoans. Amino acid
sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL W (Thompson et al., 1994), and the tree was produced with MEGA 3.1 (Kumar et al.,
2004) using the neighbor-joining method. Two other histone-binding proteins, NASP [61] and N1/N2 [62], which are closely
related to each other [61] but unrelated to the nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin family were used to root the tree. Bootstrap significance values are shown at the corresponding internal nodes after 1000 replications.

N1/N2 [42-44] and NAP1 [45] provide the H3-H4 and
egg-specific linker histones (such as B4 [46] in Xenopus)
respectively. This process continues throughout the
assembly of chromatin that takes place during the cell
divisions preceding the mid blastula transition [7]. Nucleoplasmin phosphorylation, which remains high until this
stage, may facilitate the histone exchange between nucleoplasmin and the newly replicated chromatin and does
not interfere with the H1 deposition that takes place
downstream of the replication fork long after the nucleosomes have been assembled [47].
Finally, we have shown that nucleoplasmin shares a close
phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 6) and similar tissue distribution (Fig. 7) to mammalian NPM2 [36]. Not only this,
but the genes encoding for these two proteins exhibit a
highly complex similar organization which in the case of
the amphibian counterpart spans over eight translated
exons (Fig. 2). Thus, it is highly possible that like mammalian NPM2, amphibian nucleoplasmin has some additional chromatin remodeling functions during these early
stages of development. All these observations (Fig. 2 and
Fig. 6, 7) also confirm that mammalian NPM2 is the gen-

uine mammalian equivalent of amphibian nucleoplasmin.

Conclusion
Our results clearly show that nucleoplasmin is highly conserved between different amphibian species and its presence is independent of the SNBP type. Although
amphibian nucleoplasmin clusters with mammalian
NPM2 in phylogenies, broader evolutionary analyses
(manuscript in preparation) reveal a polyphyletic origin
for the NPM2 lineage, which maybe due to the differentiation of SNPBs between amphibians (H, PL, and P-types)
and mammals (P-type). Thus, while histone storage and
exchange in early development represents a critical function of nucleoplasmin, the appearance of SNBPs of the Htype early in metazoan evolution, as well as their subsequent differentiation towards PL and P-types, could have
been a strong enough functional constraint to recruit
SNBP removal as an acquired non-specific function. This
additional role became critical in animals as the vertical
evolution of SNBPs progressively led to the incorporation
of more specialized PL and P proteins in sperm chromatin.

In closing, nucleoplasmin can be defined as a non-specific
ATP-independent sperm chromatin remodeller with a
highly specific chromatin assembly activity that plays a
critical role in chromatin metabolism during the early
stages of development.

urea) according to [49]. AUT-PAGE (5% acetic acid-10.5%
PAGE-5.25 M urea-5 mM Triton X-100) was a modified
recipe from that described in [50]. The gels were prepared
by mixing the following: 7 mg thiourea, 5 ml (20:1 acrylamide-bisacrylamide), 0.48 ml of glacial acetic acid, 3 g
urea, 24 µl of 45 mM NH4OH (made fresh), 0.118 ml of
25% Triton X-100 and 1.33 ml of double distilled water.
After the urea had been completely solubilized, 45 µl of
30% H2O2was added and the solution was immediately
poured between the glass plates as polymerization proceeds very quickly. These gels do not need to be pre-electrophoresed and can be used immediately after

Western blot analysis with nucleoplasmin antibody
For preparation of high speed extracts enriched in nucleoplasmin, ovaries were dissected from mature females after
three injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (3000
units per frog) (Sigma, Oakville, ON) given equally over 5
days. The high speed extract purification procedure followed the protocol of [51] with 1/100 v/v complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Laval, Qc) added to
the buffers. R. catesbeiana nucleoplasmin was further purified by HPLC. For this, the egg high speed extract was filtered with a Nanosep MF microconcentrator (Pall Filtron
Corporation, Northborough, MA) and fractionated by
HPLC on a reverse phase 300-A° Vydac C18 column (25
× 3 × 0.46 cm) (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) and eluted at 1 ml/
min with a 0.1% TFA-acetonitrile gradient [52].

For Western analysis, nucleoplasmin proteins or high
speed extracts were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE [53],
electo-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
(Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON) and processed as described in
[54]. The anti-nucleoplasmin serum was diluted 1:5000
and a secondary goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase
conjugate (Sigma, Oakville, ON) was diluted 1:3000.
Mass Spectroscopy partial peptide sequences
SDS-PAGE separated R. catesbeiana and B. marinus protein
bands, identified by Western Blot analysis as nucleoplasmin, were excised and the tryptic digested gel plugs analyzed on a Q-Star nanospray MS/MS analysis at the UVic
Genome BC Proteomics center. Alternatively, the gel plugs
were digested with Glu-C endoproteinase (EC 3.4.21..19)
using 50 ng/uL Glu-C enzyme overnight at room temperature following the in-gel digestion and extraction protocol described by [55] and analyzed using electrospray
ionization to spray the analyte into a LTQ-FTMS instrument (ThermoElectron, San Jose, CA).
cDNA sequence obtained from RT-PCR and RACE
For RT-PCR total RNA was extracted from oocytes using
Trizol reagent (GibcoBRL, Burlington, ON) and cDNA
was synthesized using Superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). Degenerate primers for PCR were created based on the determined amino
acid sequences for B. marinus and R. catesbeiana and the X.
laevis nucleoplasmin cDNA sequence. Polyadenylated

Figure 8
Schematic representation of the amphibian sperm chromatin remodeling by nucleoplasmin
Schematic representation of the amphibian sperm chromatin remodeling by nucleoplasmin. The chromatin
structures corresponding to each of the different SNBP types is schematically shown in the upper part of the figure. Upon fertilization of the egg, nucleoplasmin (shown here as a pentamer) stereo-specifically bound to histone H2A-H2B dimers
exchanges these dimers with the SNBP components that become non-specifically (electrostatically) bound to the polyglutamic
tracts of the unstructured C-terminal tails of the molecule. Note that only chromosomal proteins associated with the "linkerlike" (non-helically constrained) domains of the sperm chromatin are extracted by nucleoplasmin which is highly phosphorylated at this stage of development [39]. Other nuclear chaperones are likely involved in the transition from the sperm chromatin to the male pronuclear chromatin. In this regard N1/N2 would be responsible for the assembly of H3/H4 [6] and NAP-1
for the assembly of egg/early embryo-specific histone B4 like histone H1 molecules [45].

mRNA was purified using the MicroPoly(A) Purist small
scale mRNA purification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and
used for 3'and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE) using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Ambion,
Austin TX) following the manufacturers directions. PCR
was performed using a PCRsprint thermal cycler (Hybaid,

Teddington, UK) with cDNA as the template. The following primers were designed for RACE from the internal
sequence:

For DNA sequencing, agarose gel purified PCR products
were cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) following the instructions of the manufacturer and transformed into TOP10 competent cells
(Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). Sequencing was done by
the DNA Sequencing Facility, Centre for Biomedical
Research at the University of Victoria. In addition to the
cDNA sequences of R. catesbeiana and B. marinus, the partial genomic DNA sequence of the X. laevis gene was determine to confirm that X. laevis had a similar intron/exon
structure to X. tropicalis. PCR and sequencing was done as
described for the cDNA using X. laevis genomic DNA as a
template and the following PCR primers:

ducted using the computer program MEGA version 3.1
[58].

Npm1 mRNA levels in different R. catesbeiana tissues
Total RNA was extracted from oocytes using Trizol reagent
(GibcoBRL, Burlington, ON) and the purity and concentration were determined by UV absorbance and agarose
gel electrophoresis of denatured samples. Total RNA samples (7.5 µg for Npm1 and Npm2 or 1.5 µg for 18S ribosomal) were dissolved in 10 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA and
transferred to Zeta-Probe GT Blotting membrane (BioRad,
Mississauga, ON) using a Bio-Dot Microfiltration Apparatus (BioRad, Mississauga, ON) following the manufactures directions, then crosslinked to the membrane with

Phylogeny of nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin family
members from various metazoans
Amino acid sequences were aligned using the program
CLUSTAL W [56] and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method [57]. Amino
acid sequence distances were estimated as the uncorrected
differences (p-distance) resulting in smaller variance. The
reliability of the topology was tested by the bootstrap
method (1000 replications) and values are shown in the
corresponding internal nodes of the topology. Two other
histone-binding chaperone proteins (NASP and N1/N2),
which are closely related to each other but unrelated to the
nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin family were used to root
the tree. All the molecular evolutionary analyses were con-

NPM 1 and 2 primers were designed based on nucleotide
regions unique to each sequence. The 18SCOMF and
18SCOMR primers were from [59]. The 18S and Npm2
probes were from R. catesbeiana and the Npm1 probe was
from X. laevis. PCR products run on agarose gels gave single bands of the expected sizes which were excised, purified using the QIAquick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen,
Mississauga, ON) and sequenced as described above to
confirm their identity. The purified PCR products were
labeled with the Random Primer DNA Labeling System
(Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) following the Standard
Labeling protocol to produce probes. Hybridization of ~
106cpm 32P-labeled cDNA probes in PerfectHybtm Plus
buffer (Sigma, Oakville, ON) were incubated overnight
with the blots. Membranes were then washed to high
stringency, exposed and analyzed.
