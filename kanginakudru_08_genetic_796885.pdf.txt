Abstract
Background: Domestication of chicken is believed to have occurred in Southeast Asia, especially
in Indus valley. However, non-inclusion of Indian red jungle fowl (RJF), Gallus gallus murghi in
previous studies has left a big gap in understanding the relationship of this major group of birds. In
the present study, we addressed this issue by analyzing 76 Indian birds that included 56 G. g. murghi
(RJF), 16 G. g. domesticus (domestic chicken) and 4 G. sonneratii (Grey JF) using both microsatellite
markers and mitochondrial D-loop sequences. We also compared the D-loop sequences of Indian
birds with those of 779 birds obtained from GenBank.
Results: Microsatellite marker analyses of Indian birds indicated an average FST of 0.126 within G.
g. murghi, and 0.154 within G. g. domesticus while it was more than 0.2 between the two groups. The
microsatellite-based phylogenetic trees showed a clear separation of G. g. domesticus from G. g.
murghi, and G. sonneratii. Mitochondrial DNA based mismatch distribution analyses showed a lower
Harpending's raggedness index in both G. g. murghi (0.001515) and in Indian G. g. domesticus (0.0149)
birds indicating population expansion. When meta analysis of global populations of 855 birds was
carried out using median joining haplotype network, 43 Indian birds of G. g. domesticus (19
haplotypes) were distributed throughout the network sharing haplotypes with the RJFs of different
origins.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the domestication of chicken has occurred independently in
different locations of Asia including India. We found evidence for domestication of Indian birds from
G. g. spadiceus and G. g. gallus as well as from G. g. murghi, corroborating multiple domestication of
Indian and other domestic chicken. In contrast to the commonly held view that RJF and domestic
birds hybridize in nature, the present study shows that G. g. murghi is relatively pure. Further, the
study also suggested that the chicken populations have undergone population expansion, especially
in the Indus valley.

Background
Archeological findings have indicated that the 'mother of
all poultry' is the Southeast (SE) Asian Red jungle fowl
(RJF) (Gallus gallus). Since domestication of chicken has
been observed at the Indus valley as early as 3,200 BC, it
is believed to be the epicenter of chicken domestication
[1]. However, later day excavations in Peiligan Neolithic
sites of China have raised questions about the exclusive
domestication at Indus valley, suggesting alternate and
possibly earlier domestication centers [2]. It is proposed
that G. gallus, the wild RJF found in the forests of SE Asia
and India, spread to other parts of the world when people
domesticated the chicken, resulting in many chicken
breeds [3,4]. Subsequent to domestication, the extensive
breeding programmes have resulted in sixty or so breeds
of chicken representing four distinct lineages: egg-type,
game, meat-type and bantam [5]. While some authors
suggest monophyletic origin of domestic chicken [6,7],
others provide evidence for multiple and independent
domestication events [8]. Such inconsistent observations
are attributable to the fact that the initial studies were
done with relatively small set of samples. In all these
reported studies the native RJFs of Indian sub-continent,
G. g. murghi were not represented in the analyses due to
lack of sequence or molecular marker information on this
group of birds.
Taxonomically, genus Gallus is composed of four species,
G. gallus (RJF), G. lafayettei (Lafayette's JF), G. varius
(Green JF) and G. sonneratii (Grey JF – GJF). Presently
there are 5 sub-species of RJF, G. g. gallus (SE Asian RJF),
and G. g. spadiceus, G. g. bankiva, G. g. murghi (Indian RJF)
and G. g. jabouillei [9]. These classifications are mainly
based on phenotypic traits and geographic distribution of
the populations. In literature, wild and domesticated
birds are often referred to as 'fowls' and 'chicken', respectively. The domestic chicken is considered either as a subspecies of RJF (G. g. domesticus) or as a separate species, G.
domesticus. However, tight clustering of the different subspecies discounts this existing taxonomical hierarchy [6]
rendering sub-species status within RJF redundant.
Besides the taxonomical intricacies, the researchers are
also concerned about the genetic integrity and conservation status of the RJF in the wild and those held in avicultural collections. It is suspected that the domestic chicken
is hybridizing with the wild RJF resulting in erosion of
genetic purity of the wild birds [4,10,11]. Most of these
earlier studies are based on either phenotypic characters
or DNA analyses confined to small samples. Phylogenetic
analyses of mitochondrial D-loop sequence and nuclear
genes have indicated possible hybridization between GJFRJF/domestic birds [11]. In the light of these reports it is
important to assess the genetic uniqueness of Indian RJFs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/174

not only from conservation point of view, but also for
using them in population studies.
It is well known that the patterns of genetic differences can
reveal the demographic history of the population under
study. Since changes in population size leave characteristic molecular signatures, by measuring such changes one
can reconstruct the population history. Mismatch distributions, also known as 'pairwise differences' give information on genetic differences between pairs of subjects
and can be used to understand the population history
[12]. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited maternally [13] and is often employed in population genetic
analyses due to its high copy number, haploid nature and
absence of/rare recombination events [14]. A recent study
involving the analysis of chicken mitochondrial DNA
sequence from pre-historical samples pointed pre-columbian Polynesian origin of American breeds [15], thus suggesting the importance of mitochondrial D-loop sequence
in determining the history of chicken domestication. Microsatellite markers, on the other hand, are nuclear markers and are used extensively in population genetic
analyses because they are highly polymorphic, ubiquitously distributed throughout the genome, are having
high mutation rates, co-dominant in nature, selectively
neutral and are amenable to PCR-based high through-put
analysis [16]. Hilel et al. [17] characterized 52 chicken
breeds using 22 microsatellite markers and concluded
that the origin of domestic chicken to be from RJFs, as
supported by mt DNA analyses [8].
In all the earlier studies these two marker systems have
been used independently to study chicken populations
[7,17-19]. In the present study we have combined the
results emanating from these two informative marker systems to address the questions relating to (i) evolutionary
status of Indian RJF and chicken and (ii) extent of gene
flow between Indian RJF and chicken, RJF-GJF in comparison to the world population.

Results
Genetic identity of Indian fowls
In the present study, phylogenetic and demographic profiling analyses were carried out using 76 Indian birds that
belong to seven populations. We employed 11 microsatellite markers and also sequenced 650 bp of hyper variable region (D-loop) of mitochondrial genomes of two
species of fowls namely G. sonneratii (n = 4) and G. gallus,
which includes two subspecies G. g. murghi, (n = 56) and
G. g. domesticus (n = 16).

Totally there were 197 alleles from 11 microsatellite loci,
of which, 106 were from G. g. murghi, and 59 were from
G. g. domesticus chicken. The locus MCW5 gave the maximum number of alleles in G. g. murghi and in G. sonner-

atii, while VITIIG2 locus revealed the maximum number
of alleles in G. g. domesticus (Table 1). The total number of
private alleles was maximum in G. g. murghi followed by
G. g. domesticus and G. sonneratii, respectively. Populationwise mean number of alleles per locus ranged from 2.91
(G. sonneratii) to 6.09 (Birshi Kargah population of G. g.
murghi, B-RJF), with a mean heterozygosity ranging from
0.481 (K-RJF) to 0.600 (B-RJF).
When the 76 birds were subdivided into seven groups (see
methods section for the grouping of birds) and analyzed
for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), of the 77 combinations (7 groups × 11 loci) 32 deviated from HWE, with
22 deviations occurring in G. g. murghi alone and 8 in G.
g. domesticus group (See Additional file 1). We speculate
that G. g. murghi is probably not in HWE because of
inbreeding within the fragmented populations. The low
FST values among G. g. murghi as compared to G. g. domesticus birds also suggested possible inbreeding within G. g.
murghi populations. The average FST was 0.126 within G.
g. murghi, while it was 0.154 within G. g. domesticus (Table
2). The AMOVA estimation based on 99 permutations
using GenAlEx showed a significant (P = 0.01) within
population variation (66% in 7G and 69% in 2G population). Upon grouping the 72 Indian birds as domestic and
RJF, the microsatellite markers showed a significant variation 'among the groups' (i.e. domestic-RJF, 27%, P = 0.01)
than 'within the group' (17%, P = 0.01).
Population-wise Nei's genetic distance calculated using
GenAlEx program showed a higher average distance
between G. sonneratii and G. g. domesticus (2.099) than
between G. sonneratii – G. g. murghi (0.758) and G. g.
murghi – G. g. domesticus (1.695) combinations (Additional file 1). Intra-population average distances were

lower for both domestic and RJF groups than across the
population distances, which is consistent with the observation that among population variation was more than
within population variation. The results suggest very rare
genetic exchange between the RJF and domestic chicken
populations, at least in recent history.
A Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree obtained from the microsatellite data showed a clear separation of G. g. domesticus from the G. g. murghi, with G. sonneratii as an outgroup
(Fig. 1a) suggesting the genetic distinctness of G. g.
murghi. However, rare instances of hybridization between
Indian RJF and domestic birds cannot be excluded in
nature as seen in one case (K10-C1, Fig. 1a).
We also constructed a genetic distance based neighborjoining (NJ) tree to obtain the genetic relationship among
Indian birds. The result clearly points to the fact that

hybridization between Indian chicken and Indian RJF G.
g. murghi in the wild is extremely rare (Fig. 1b).
To understand the clustering pattern of birds, we also carried out genetic distance based principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2) of domestic and RJF birds, using
GenAlEx. The results showed clear segregation of all
domestic birds into a single quadrate of the PCA (left
upper quadrate in Fig. 2), which did not include any RJF.
However, the population of RJFs did not segregate according to the location/population, suggesting the possibility
of inbreeding within the RJF populations. This result further supports the absence of hybridization between RJF
and domestic birds in India, at least in recent times.

We also sequenced and analyzed 650 bp of the D-loop
region of 76 Indian birds to derive the matrilineal population history by using coalescent-based models.
The pairwise FST values calculated using Arlequin were
very low within G. g. murghi when compared to G. g.
domesticus (Table 2). The average FST values were more for
G. sonneratii – G. g. domesticus combination than for G.
sonneratii-G. g. murghi or G. g. murghi – G. g. domesticus
combinations. Contrary to microsatellite based analysis,
mitochondrial analysis showed a lower mean pairwise FST
value for G. sonneratii – G. g. domesticus combination.
These results again point out that there is hardly any
genetic exchange across the three categories of birds,
namely GJF, RJF and domestic birds.

Principal2component analysis based on genetic distances of Indian chicken
Principal component analysis based on genetic distances of Indian chicken. The clear clustering of all domestic
chicken to a single quadrate (upper left) indicates absence of hybridization between domestic chicken and RJFs.

To understand the demographic history of the two populations, we obtained pairwise mismatch distribution estimates. In an expanding population, mismatch
distribution is expected to be a bell shaped smooth curve,
whereas population at constant growth shows raggedness.
In the present study, observed mismatch distribution was
bell-shaped for 56 Indian birds of G. g. murghi (Fig. 3).
However, appearance of multiple peaks suggested a population subdivision, which was more prominent in G. g.
domesticus than in G. g. murghi. This also suggests homogenous population of G. g. murghi, again supporting our
notion that inbreeding is more common in RJF than in
domestic birds. Harpending's raggedness index was lower
in G. g. murghi (0.001515) than in G. g. domesticus
(0.0149), but was significant (P < 0.05) in both the populations reiterating population expansion.
Phylogeny and median-joining network profiles of Indian
birds in comparison to global populations
In the present study we also compared the D-loop
sequence of 76 birds with the corresponding sequences

(approximately 400–440 bp) of 779 birds from NCBI
GenBank to get insight into phylodemographic status of
G. g. murghi and G. g. domesticus (India). Of the 855
sequences, 117 were from RJFs, 714 were from domestic
chicken and the rest belonged to other species of Gallus.
These 855 birds were classified into 13 groups based on
geographical location and species/sub-species status as
shown in Table 3. We included Japanese quail, Coturnix
japonica as an outgroup whenever necessary.
All the 855 sequences resulted in 117 segregating sites and
146 haplotypes with a haplotype diversity of 0.940 and an
average nucleotide diversity of 0.020. The NJ tree generated from the haplotype data revealed two distinct G. gallus clusters, one consisting of the G. g. bankiva group, and
the remaining cluster containing all the other groups
namely, G. g. spadiceus, G. g. gallus, G. g. murghi, G. g.
jabouillei and G. g. domesticus. Irrespective of the geographic distribution and sub-species status, more than
95% of the birds clustered within this single largest group
(Fig. 4 – see discussion). This result is consistent with the

neighbor-joining tree of all 855 birds (Additional file 2),
where we observed a single clade for all domestic and RJF
birds. However, in contrast to Fumihito et al.'s work [5],
we observed a clear segregation of a clade containing G.
varius, G. lafayettei and G. sonneratii from all RJF/domestic
bird combination, which reassures us about the absence
of the hybridization. Such a topology was also evident
from the haplotype-based tree (Fig. 4)
To obtain further insight into the haplotype relationships,
we constructed a median-joining network using 146 haplotypes. In the haplotype network, most of the G. g. gallus
formed individual nodes (e.g. H_1, H_2, H_78, H_79)
and clustered independently, while many G. g. murghi
haplotypes (H_86 to H_99 and H_102 to H_123)
grouped around a major cluster (H_112) having 16 birds,
giving rise to a star like phylogeny (Fig. 5). The largest
haplotype H_3 (with 127 birds) confined mostly to Chinese G. g. domesticus birds without any representation of
jungle fowls. Thirty nine birds of G. g. spadiceus belonging
to 9 haplotypes did not have any representation from G.

g. murghi birds. The second largest haplotype (H_61 with
102 birds) shared only a single individual of G. g. gallus
and many G. g. domesticus from China, India, Japan and
Indonesia. Forty-three G. g. domesticus of India (19 haplotypes) were distributed throughout the network. These
haplotypes were connected with G. g. gallus, G. g. murghi
and G. g. spadiceus. The haplotype H_63 contained G. g.
domesticus (India) birds reported in the present study as
well as from an earlier study [8]. Interestingly, majority of
the Indian G. g. domesticus haplotypes shared the birds
from the three major G. gallus groups belonging to G. g.
spadiceus (H_58, H_61), G. g. gallus (H_59, H_61), and
also G. g. murghi (H_6). It is very likely that G. g. spadiceus
has also contributed to the domestic chicken. Apart from
Indian RJF, G. g. murghi haplotype H_6 also contained 5
Chinese, 1 Iranian and 1 Japanese domestic chicken. The
distribution of Indian domestic chicken into different
haplotypes could imply multiple origins of Indian domestic chicken breeds.

* Misc. represents birds from Iran, UK and Vietnam. NC – not calculated.

The sequenced regions of D-loop were well conserved in
most of the birds. The 62 bp insertion element found in
G. sonneratii was the only indel of considerable size
present in the whole sequence. The salient mutation
observed in G. g. murghi was the presence of 'T' in most of
the birds (54 out of 56 i.e. 96.4%) (Fig. 4) that was present
in only 33.3% of G. g. gallus, 24.4% of G. g. spadiceus and
13.1% of all the G. g. domesticus birds. Only three Indian
G. g. domesticus (6.9%) had 'T' at this position. This position corresponds to the nucleotide number 360 (where
there is 'C') in the complete mitochondrial genome
sequence of G. gallus (Acc. No. NC_001323) available in
GenBank. Across the portion of the sequenced mitochondrial genome we observed that transition to transversion
ratio was lower in case of G. g. murghi (45/47 = 0.99) than
in G. g. gallus (31/2 = 15.5) or G. g. spadiceus (23/4 = 5.75
– Table 3).
Mismatch distribution analyses carried out under sudden
expansion model showed that mean pairwise differences
were highest in G. g. murghi among G. gallus sub-species.
However, another species of Gallus, G. sonneratii had the
highest mean pairwise differences (Table 3). Both
Tajima's D and Fu's Fs were significantly (P < 0.05) negative in G. g. murghi, suggesting the departure from neutrality (Table 3). Tajima's D was significant only in G. g.
spadiceus and G. g. murghi. Fu's FS, a better indicator for

estimating the departures from neutral theory, showed a
significant negative value (P of simFS < = obsFS is < 0.01)
for G. g. murghi and G. g. domesticus (Indonesia). Nucleotide diversity was also high (0.030) in case of G. g.
murghi (except for G. sonneratii) amongst all the groups
studied (Table 3).
The FST values showed a very high differentiation between
the out group C. japonica and the other 13 populations,
with a value above 0.9. Most of the pairwise FST values
were significant with a P value < 0.05. FST value [20] based
NJ tree showed the divergence of G. g. murghi from G. g.
gallus, G. g. spadiceus and G. g. domesticus (Additional file
3). AMOVA calculations showed that the majority of variation found within G. gallus subspecies was between the
domestic and jungle fowl populations (76%), while
'among the group' variation was 7% with an overall FST
value of 0.234 (P = 0).

Discussion
In the present study we attempted to understand the contribution of Indian red jungle fowl, G. g. murghi to the
domestication event. As of now, no sequence information
is available from this group of birds which, in all likelihood, was contributor of one of the earliest known
chicken domestication event, i.e. in Mohanjo-Daro. We
studied Indian birds belonging to two species of Gallus

A NJ haplotype tree obtained by 50% consensus rule using 117 variable sites within the sequenced portion of the D-loop, with their corresponding haplotypes generated from the 146 haplotypes of 855 birds. Different haplotypes are color-coded based on the group they belong to
(See methods section for grouping details) as indicated. Filled structures indicate haplotypes consisting of all birds of the same group (e.g. Indian RJF-pink
colored), while open structures indicate the presence of at least one bird of a specified/color-coded group that also contains birds belonging to other
groups (e.g. Indian RJF containing domestic birds). Different sub-species of G. gallus form only two clusters, one of G. g. bankiva and others containing all
other sub-species. The cluster of G. gallus sub-species, however also contained another species of Gallus, namely G. lafayettei. Identical sequences are shown
as dots in comparison with H_11. A specific mutation found in 96% of G. g. murghi is shown in bold and red color and the corresponding nucleotide is
underlined in H_11. This position corresponds to the nucleotide number 360 (where there is 'C') in the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of G.
gallus (Acc. No. NC_001323). The color-coding used is represented below the figure.

Median-joining haplotype network of 855 birds belonging to 146 haplotypes. Various haplotypes of chicken species/
sub-species are represented in different colored circles. The size of the circles is proportional to the haplotype frequency.
Some of the important haplotype numbers are indicated. The median vectors that represent hypothetical intermediates or unsampled haplotypes, are shown in blue circles. The data indicate formation of a star-like phylogeny of G. g. murghi around

and compared them with the worldwide bird populations. Since microsatellite markers and the D-loop
sequence of mitochondrial DNA have a high mutation
rates, they provide information about recent evolutionary
history as compared to slow mutating genes that provide
data about ancient history [21]. To reconstruct the recent
past, we used both these marker systems and also
addressed the issue of genetic purity of wild birds.
From the mtDNA analysis, we observed that a group of G.
g. domesticus birds had the G. g. murghi haplotype (H_6),
while a few others shared haplotypes with G. g. gallus
(H_21, H_59, H_61 etc.) and with G. g. spadiceus (H_39,
H_42, H_58 etc.). This is also true for Indian chicken that
have originated by independent domestication from G. g.
murghi as well as possibly from other G. g. subspecies.
Interestingly, sharing of different haplotypes by Indian
domestic chicken clarify that the present day Asiatic

chicken might have originated from different progenitors
by multiple domestication events and such multi-origin
breeds could still be observed in a single geographical
location. This is consistent with the observation of Oka et
al. [22], who showed that the present day native Japanese
chicken are having multiple origin.
A model explaining the origin of Indian domestic bird by
multiple domestications is depicted schematically in Fig.
6. Sharing of haplotypes, as indicated in this model, suggests multiple origins to Indian domestic chicken. Independent domestications have also been reported for cattle
[23], pig [24] suggesting that such events are not rare.
However, all the birds except G. g. bankiva form a single
cluster suggesting a common ancestor long back in history
for these birds including jungle fowls and domestic birds.
The separation of G. g. bankiva from the main cluster of
birds indicates the possibility of a speciation event.

Figure 6
Comparison of (A) single domestication against (B) multiple domestication hypothesis
Comparison of (A) single domestication against (B) multiple domestication hypothesis. The present study supports the hypothesis B for origin of domestic chicken. The numbers in parenthesis indicate the nucleotide diversity (p-black),
transition-to-transversion ratio (Ts/Tv-blue) and haplotype diversity (Hd-violet), respectively. The number inside the square
indicates average number of mutational events of each group from the outgroup, C. japonica. The sharing of the haplotypes (as
exemplified by H_number) indicates the multiple origin of the domestic chicken from different jungle fowls. Low mutational
distance, low Ts/Tv ratio and high nucleotide diversity indicate the ancient nature of Indian RJF, G. g. murghi. The dashed line
separates domestic chicken (below the line) from other birds.

The multilocus microsatellite data as well as the D-loop
sequence of Indian chicken showed departure from neutrality as indicated by significant negative value of
Tajima's D and Fu's Fs for G. g. murghi suggesting the possible population expansion of Indian birds. These results
are also consistent with mismatch distribution analyses
and significant value for Harpending's raggedness index
(Table 3). Taken together with the genetic diversity analyses, we surmise that G. g. murghi and G. g. domesticus
(India) must have undergone population expansion. It is
believed that population expansion follows a domestication event. This fact holds true even in case of chicken,
where we did observe population expansion, as did previous studies.
Our analyses revealed that the sampled Indian birds are
relatively pure with very rare hybridization between G. g.

murghi and G. g. domesticus (India). Nishibori et al. [11]
suggested the hybridization of RJF with domestic and grey
jungle fowl. In the present study of Indian birds, we did
not come across noticeable hybridization at least in the
recent past, as indicated by very low FST values for mtDNA
(Table 2) and microsatellite markers and also a clear separation of RJF clades from domestic chicken in microsatellite based phylogeny. All these results indicate the
genetic integrity of the G. g. murghi.
In the present study, we observed predominant occurrence of a characteristic 'T' nucleotide in 96.4% of G. g.
murghi birds that is absent in most of the Indian domestic
chicken further supporting the occurrence of negligible
hybridization between G. g. murghi and G. g. domesticus
(India). All the sampled G. sonneratii had 'A' nucleotide in
this position. If the frequent hybridization is occurring
then it is expected that at least a few of G. g. murghi to have

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:174

'A' at this position. Since we found only one RJF with 'A'
at this site, and also due to clear separation of the clades,
it is unlikely that G. g. murghi and G. sonneratii hybridize
in the wild contrary to the observations made by Nishibori et al. [11] who suggested the possible hybridization
between the RJF and GJF. Such contrasting observations
may be due to the limited number of samples (3 RJF and
3 GF) used by Nisibori et al. [11]. Taken together with the
Fumihito et. al.'s [6,7] and Liu et al.'s [8] observations our
results prompted us to question the sub-species status for
G. g. gallus, G. g. spadiceus, G. g. murghi and G. g. domesticus. In the light of these findings, we recommend that G.
gallus should be classified as G. g. gallus that should
include all RJFs and G. g. domesticus birds. At the same
time, after confirmation of reproductive isolation, G. g.
bankiva could be placed into a separate species, Gallus
bankiva.

Conclusion
For the first time by analyzing hitherto unreported samples of G. g. murghi and also including the G. g. domesticus
(India), we confirm that the domestication of chicken has
occurred independently from G. g. murghi. We also provide evidence that there is little genetic exchange between
G. g. murghi and G. g. domesticus (India) and minimal
hybridization between G. sonneratii and G. g. murghi.
Comparison of Indian RJF and domestic bird to that of
world population also supports the previous studies of
obsoleteness of the sub-species status given to RJFs and
domestic chicken.

n = 25), Kalesar Forest ('K-RJF', n = 10) and Birshi Kargah
Forest ('B-RJF', n = 21) of Haryana State of India (Fig. 7),
3 populations of G. g. domesticus birds i.e. Chicken ('C', n
= 5), Jodhpur ('J', n = 5) and Mirpur Bakshiwala ('M', n =
6) villages of Haryana. Grey Jungle fowl (G. sonneratii)
blood samples (n = 4) were collected from different Zoological Parks of South India and were considered as a single population. Except for the G. g. domesticus birds, which
were collected from specific villages, all the other birds
were captive bred from the founder-lines that were
obtained from the specified village. The 76 birds were
considered as belonging to 7 populations (3 RJF, 3
domestic and a single population of GJF).
About 0.5 ml of blood was collected from the wing vein
of live birds into vials containing 5 mM EDTA and
genomic DNA was isolated as per standard protocols [25].
PCR amplification of microsatellite loci
The microsatellite loci used in the study, the primer details
and PCR conditions are available in Table 1. The PCR
products were separated on 3.5% Metaphor agarose gel
along with pUC/MspI digest (MBI Fermentas) ladder. For
GeneScan analysis, the PCR products generated using fluorescent dUTPs were dissolved in 2 μl of formamide gel
loading buffer with 0.3 μl of ROX-500™ GeneScan ruler
(Perkin Elmer) and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide-7
M Urea gel.
PCR amplification and Sequencing of D-loop of
mitochondrial DNA
The D-loop hypervariable region was PCR amplified using
primers described elsewhere [7]. The sequencing was carried out on both the strands. We also used an internal
primer (5'GTGGAATATAGGTTAATGCC 3') to obtain the
sequence information from 5' region without any ambiguity. 50 ng PCR product was used in a sequencing reaction that contained 8 μl of Ready reaction mix (BDT v 3.0,
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 5 picomoles of
primer. The sequencing was carried out in ABI Prism 3100
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Data analysis
Microsatellite Data
The individuals were genotyped based on allele size data.
Allele frequency and heterozygosity were calculated using
GenAlEx [26]. F-statistics were used as a measure of diversity within and between populations and were estimated
using GenAlEx. For PCA, genetic distance was calculated
from the allele data and the genetic distance was plotted
as PCA using GenAlEx. Population history parameters
were calculated using Arlequin [27]. The microsatellite
allele frequency data from different populations was
bootstrapped using seqboot of Phylip and the output file
was used for construction of maximum likelihood (ML)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/174

tree using Phylip 'contml' program. For distance based NJ
tree, the genetic distance was calculated using GenAlEx
program and the resulting distance matrix was used to
construct NJ tree with Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) option
in MEGA.
Mitochondrial DNA
Mitochondrial D-loop sequences of 779 Jungle Fowls and
G. g. domesticus birds as well as other species of Gallus were
obtained from GenBank [28] (available as Additional file
4). The sequences of 855 birds, including the 76 samples
sequenced in the present study were aligned using ClustalX program [29], manually edited using GeneDoc [30]
and the region conserved in all the birds was used for
analysis. With gaps there were a total of 482 bp sequence,
with highest number of nucleotides (460–462) coming
from the G. sonneratii and approximately 400 bp from
RJFs. Similar to previous phylogenetic studies, we used
Coturnix japonica as an outgroup in our study. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using Phylip 3.5 [31] or
MEGA [32]. The best fit model was selected using the program MODELTEST [33] as implemented in HyPhy [34].
The alpha value obtained from best-fit model was used for
gamma correction in haplotype NJ tree, which was constructed using Tajima and Nei's model in MEGA3. Haplotype data was obtained using DnaSP [35] and was used to
construct haplotype network using Network program
[36]. Default parameters were used for obtaining the
median joining network tree. Population genetic structure
was measured using AMOVA as implemented in Arlequin
with 1000 permutations. Tajima's D [37], Fu's Fs [38] and
other population genetics parameters were also calculated
using Arlequin for which the significance was tested after
1000 simulation steps [27]. For such analyses, populations were defined depending on the data being analyzed
– e.g. in case of Indian chicken, as 2G – 2 populations viz.
G. g. domesticus and G. g. murghi, 6G-3 sub populations
each based on the sampling location in both G. g. domesticus (C, J, M) and G. g. murghi populations (M-RJF, B-RJF,
K-RJF) or 7G (6G and G. sonneratii). Such a classification
was carried out to study the population genetic structure
within the subdivided populations. Whenever necessary,
as in case of subdivided populations, realignment of the
sequence was carried out using clustalX.

We investigated the demographic profiles of chicken populations based on coalescence theory and analyzed pairwise mismatch distribution to confirm the population
expansion [39], using Arlequin. The parameter of demographic expansion τ was estimated with a generalized
nonlinear least squares approach and approximate confidence intervals were obtained with 1000 parametric bootstrap replicates. The goodness-of-fit of the observed data
to a simulated model of expansion was tested with the
sum of squared deviations and Harpending's raggedness

index was estimated [40]. For bootstrap phylogenetic NJ
tree, the aligned mtDNA sequence was run in MEGA with
1000 replicates with a 50% cutoff option.
