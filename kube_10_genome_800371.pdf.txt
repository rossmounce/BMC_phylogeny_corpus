Abstract
Background: The genus Erwinia includes plant-associated pathogenic and non-pathogenic Enterobacteria. Important
pathogens such as Erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight and E. pyrifoliae causing bacterial shoot blight of
pear in Asia belong to this genus. The species E. tasmaniensis and E. billingiae are epiphytic bacteria and may represent
antagonists for biocontrol of fire blight. The presence of genes that are putatively involved in virulence in E. amylovora
and E. pyrifoliae is of special interest for these species in consequence.
Results: Here we provide the complete genome sequences of the pathogenic E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96 with a size of
4.1 Mb and of the non-pathogenic species E. billingiae strain Eb661 with a size of 5.4 Mb, de novo determined by
conventional Sanger sequencing and next generation sequencing techniques. Genome comparison reveals large
inversions resulting from homologous recombination events. Furthermore, comparison of deduced proteins highlights
a relation of E. billingiae strain Eb661 to E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 and a distance to E. pyrifoliae for the overall gene
content as well as for the presence of encoded proteins representing virulence factors for the pathogenic species.
Pathogenicity of E. pyrifoliae is supposed to have evolved by accumulation of potential virulence factors. E. pyrifoliae
carries factors for type III secretion and cell invasion. Other genes described as virulence factors for E. amylovora are
involved in the production of exopolysaccharides, the utilization of plant metabolites such as sorbitol and sucrose.
Some virulence-associated genes of the pathogenic species are present in E. tasmaniensis but mostly absent in E.
billingiae.
Conclusion: The data of the genome analyses correspond to the pathogenic lifestyle of E. pyrifoliae and underlines the
epiphytic localization of E. tasmaniensis and E. billingiae as a saprophyte.
Background
The genus Erwinia comprises essentially plant-associated
bacteria. Two species, Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia
pyrifoliae, are connected with "pome fruit" diseases, fire
blight of apple, pear and some ornamentals and Asian
pear blight, respectively [1-3]. Other species were isolated from plant surfaces such as Erwinia billingiae and
Erwinia tasmaniensis. Due to their epiphytic occurrence,
they can compete with growth and distribution of E.
amylovora on flowers and may be applied as antagonists
for control of fire blight [4]. Such bacteria have the poten* Correspondence: kube@molgen.mpg.de

tial to reduce the use of antibiotics in agriculture for control of the disease. Accumulation of streptomycin
resistant strains in pome fruit growing regions in the
United States emphasizes the need of new strategies to
reduce economical losses of more than $100 million per
year for the United States resulting from fire blight [5-10].
In the course of description of pear pathogenic E. pyrifoliae strains, isolated in Korea, it became evident that
they are related to E. amylovora, but distinct for several
taxonomic criteria [11]. A pathogen associated with bacterial shoot blight of pear (BSBP) in Japan was also classified as E. pyrifoliae [12]. Strain Ep1/96 from Korea is
assumed to be a representative for E. pyrifoliae and the
features are also valid for the strains from Japan.

In dendrograms from 16 S rRNA sequences and in
alignments of parts from the house keeping genes gpd
and recA, E. pyrifoliae is related to E. amylovora, less to E.
tasmaniensis and in more distance to E. billingiae [12].
Several properties of these species can explain their
interactions with plants. Pathogens as well as epiphytic
bacteria are dependent on the availability of carbohydrates to metabolize them as an energy source. Plants
synthesize and transport high levels of sucrose as a main
product of photosynthesis. E. amylovora, the fire blight
pathogen, is specialized on rosaceous plants, which typically also produce sorbitol. Mutants of E. amylovora in
the sucrose and in the sorbitol metabolism are nonpathogenic [13,14]. Surprisingly, E. tasmaniensis lacks the
srl-operon and is unable to metabolize sorbitol, although
the epiphytes were isolated from the apple and pear flora
[15,16]. E. billingiae was isolated from a similar environment, initially designated as "white Erwinia herbicola"
and later classified as a novel species [17,18]. These bacteria are also detected in necrotic plant tissue from trees
with fire blight (Geider et al., unpublished), but do not
share important properties with E. amylovora [4]. These
include the inability of E. billingiae to cause a hypersensitive response (HR) on tobacco leaves, a lack of levan synthesis with a general deficiency to metabolize sucrose [4].
A deficiency in levan formation was also observed for E.
pyrifoliae [1]. On the other hand, destruction of the host
plant tissue, indicated by HR on non-host plants, is an
important pathogenicity factor of E. amylovora and was
also described for E. pyrifoliae [1,19,20].
Another important pathogenicity factor of E. amylovora and E. pyrifoliae is the formation of capsular
exopolysaccharide (EPS). Gene clusters encoding functions for amylovoran synthesis of E. amylovora and pyrifolan synthesis of E. pyrifoliae have been described and
mutants created in these genes by transposon and by site
directed mutagenesis, which lost virulence [21,22]. Other
virulence factors of E. amylovora were described to
include iron uptake, or defects in amino acid or nucleotide metabolism [23].
Therefore it was of special interest to show, if factors
necessary for invasion can be identified in the genome of
E. pyrifoliae and if their absence in the genome of E.
billingiae and E. tasmaniensis can describe their epiphytic occurrence in plant surfaces.
We determined the complete genome of the pearpathogen E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96, which is related to E.
amylovora and of the non-pathogenic E. billingiae strain
Eb661 [11,24]. A mixed strategy of pyrosequencing and
traditional Sanger sequencing was used to determine
both new genome sequences. These data together with
the previously published genome sequence of E. tasmaniensis provide databases for comparative analysis of
virulence factors.

Results and Discussion
Genome composition and architecture of Erwinia billingiae
strain Eb661, E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 and E. pyrifoliae
strain Ep1/96

The genomes of E. billingiae strain Eb661, E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 and E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96 contain
one circular chromosome with a size of 5.1 Mb for strain
Eb661, and 4.0 Mb for strain Ep1/96 down to 3.9 Mb for
strain Et1/99 [15]. The number of corresponding predicted proteins ranges from 4,587 to 3,427 (Table 1). The
distant position of E. billingiae strain Eb661 is indicated
by the general genome data and corresponds to the phylogenetic position on a different branch in contrast to the
other three genomes [12,24]. This classification into two
groups is also supported by the estimated numbers of
shared genes for the chromosomes of the strains Ep1/96,
Et1/99 and Eb661 (6,883 out of 11,659 proteins in total)
(Figure 1). The highest amount of unique proteins is present for strain Eb661 with 2,037 proteins (2,065 including
paralogs etc.) corresponding to the enlarged chromosome size. This portion encompassing 4% of the deduced
protein set encodes a wide additional metabolic repertoire and associated transporters. In contrast, the portion
of estimated unique genes for the pathogenic strain Ep1/
96 is 785 (897 including paralogs etc.) corresponding to
approx. 25% of the proteins encoded on the chromosome.
The number of 7 rRNA operons is constant within the
chromosomes, but the presence of one unusual rRNA
operon with a 16S-23S-5S-5 S organization is limited to

Sequencing coverage was reached by a 9fold Sanger sequencing and
a 25fold coverage with GS20 data for strain Ep1/96 and by a 11fold
Sanger sequencing and a 8fold coverage with GS FLX data for strain
Eb661.
rRNA operons show 16S-23S-5S order, except one copy within the
chromosome of the strains Ep1/96, Ea273 and Et1/99 with the
unusual 16S-23S-5S-5S order organization. The 16S-23S-5S-5S
operon is missing in strain Eb661, which belongs to a different
phylogenetic branch.

the genomes of strains Ep1/96 and Et1/99. This could
provide a genetic marker for these species within the
genus Erwinia. The occurrence of the unusual 16S-23S5S-5 S organization within the chromosome is interpreted as the result of a chromosomal recombination
event. Large inversions and translocations have occurred
frequently during evolution in the genus Erwinia (Figure

2). The present conserved synteny between the three
genomes is disrupted by large inversions, which indicates
two different types of organization. One type is shared by
strain Ep1/96 and Et1/99 as well as a second one which is
shared by strain Eb661 and strain Ea273 (data not
shown). These re-arrangements are thought to be driven
by homologous recombination, which often occurs at the
rRNA operons [25]. The importance of rRNA operons for
these events could be confirmed by the comparison of the
chromosomes of strain Eb661 and Et1/99 for the centered
inversion, which is suggested to be responsible for the
duplication of the 5S-rRNA gene. The comparison of the
chromosomes of strain Et1/99 and Ep1/96 indicates the
stability of this re-arrangement. Several other translocations and inversions are present especially within two
regions not neighbouring to rRNA operons.
However, Figure 2 also illustrates that the larger chromosome size of E. billingiae strain Eb661 is mainly based
on the presence of single genes scattered over the whole
genome and not on the transfer of large gene clusters.
The minor influence of phage integrations was estimated
by the prediction of integrated regions (258 kb for strain
Eb661, 177 kb for strain Et1/99 and 261 kb for strain Ep1/
96) and of gene duplication corresponding to the number
of potential paralogs (76 for strain Eb661, 57 for strain
Et1/99 and 223 for strain Ep1/96). Cumulative GC skew
analyses support the weak modulations of the chromosomes by these events by its regular run (Additional file
1).
The exchange of genetic material mainly depends on
the presence of extrachromosomal elements. The number of plasmids ranges from two for Eb661 to five in
strain Et1/99 (Table 2). A deviating GC content compared
to the chromosome suggests an unrelated origin for
pET35 and pET49. Several plasmids in the genus Erwinia
show the potential for a conjugal transfer such as pEB170
of E. billingiae strain Eb661, the plasmids pET35
(CU468130), pET45 (CU468132), pET46 (CU468133),
pET49 (CU468131) of E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 and
pEL60 of E. amylovora strain Leb66 (AY422214), an
untypical isolate from Lebanon. Plasmids pEp05 and
pEt46 carry mob genes and may contain an oriT to be
mobilized by Tra proteins of other plasmids. The species
E. amylovora, E. pyrifoliae, and E. tasmaniensis share
thiO (glycine oxidase), thiS (sulfur carrier protein), thiG
(thiazole synthase) and thiF (adenylyl transferase) in conserved order. These genes are located on plasmids of E.
pyrifoliae and E. amylovora and on the chromosome of E.
tasmaniensis. A potential gene flow is indicated by the
high identities between the sequences on the nucleotide
level and the amino acid level of at least 87% (Figure 3). E.
amylovora genes for thiamine metabolism are located on
plasmid pEA29. Plasmidfree strains of E. amylovora show
reduced virulence and reduced growth in minimal

Figure 3 Alignment of genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis (thiOSGF), a toxin-antitoxin system (stbDE) and a choline transporter (betT)
for E. tasmaniensis, and E. pyrifoliae. The maps show corresponding parts from the chromosome of E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 and from plasmid
pEP36 of E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96. BlastP results (percentage identity) are shown for related genes (grey boxes). Labels indicating the locus tag number are given within the grey boxes, if no gene name is assigned. White boxes indicate genes without similarity. The proteins for thiamine biosynthesis
(thi) and the flanking regions are highly related and the genes are in conserved order. The stbD and stbE genes of pEp36 encode for a toxin-antitoxin
system. A comparison for genes in this region was done before for the E. amylovora plasmid pEA29, the E. pyrifoliae plasmid pEP36 and plasmid pEJ30
from the Japanese E. pyrifoliae strain Ejp557 [89]. Locus tags of the genes are abbreviated for this overview.

medium without thiamine [26,27]. The choline transporter protein BetT is encoded in all three species and
may help to protect bacteria against osmotic stress [28].
We detected homologies for stbD and stbE in the
sequences of pEp36 but not for E. tasmaniensis strain
Et1/99. StbD and StbE are plasmid stability proteins and
code for a toxin-antitoxin system, which is widespread
throughout pathogenic bacteria [29].
Pathogenicity of several Erwinia species is probably
based on a large set of modules (Table 3).
We focussed the analyses on the genetic environment
encoded within the genomes with respect to secretion,
production of exopolysaccarides, sorbitol and sucrose
metabolism as well as on the presence of miscellaneous
genes with potential impact to the virulence for the
pathogenic erwinias.
Secretion systems

The ability to secrete effector proteins and to colonize
host plant tissue represents very important features. Differences in chromosome content were also identified by
mapping the deduced proteins from the non-pathogenic
strains on the chromosome of E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96
as well as by one by one comparison (Additional file 2,
Figure S2A-E; Additional file 3). The data for several
combinations are arranged in Additional file 2 and several secretion systems are classified in Additional file 3
for their presence or absence in the investigated genomes.
Common secretion systems of the Enterobacteriaceae
such as the sec-independent (Type 1) and sec-dependent
(Type 2) secretion systems have been identified in
Erwinia species that fulfil vital functions, e.g. export of
extracellular proteins for nutrient acquisition [30].
Among them, one of the best studied are the genetically

and structurally conserved type III secretion systems
(T3SSs), which were found to be crucial for delivery of
proteins acting as pathogenicity factors into the extracellular space or the cytoplasm [31,32]. Target cells and
secreted proteins are of broad range and host-specific.
The primary T3SS in Erwinia species is composed of
the hrp/hrc-gene-cluster and two flanking regions (Hrp
elicitors and effectors [HEE] and Hrp-associated enzymes
[HAE]), which contain effector proteins and enzymes
involved in systemic virulence [15,33]. Like in E. amylovora this assembly could also be identified in the pathogenic E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96, and clearly marks a
difference to the system of the non-pathogenic E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 without the HAE region and E.
billingiae strain Eb661, which contains no homologs to a
T3SS [15]. Nevertheless, the hrp/hrc-clusters of E. pyrifoliae and E. tasmaniensis show almost conserved synteny.
Slight differences are orfU1 (Acc. No. AAD24685) and
orfU2 (Acc. No. AAD24686) of E. amylovora with similarity to genes coding for hypothetical proteins in Helicobacter pylori [33]. The products of those CDS may
represent specific components of the E. amylovora T3SS.
A second gene cluster similar to the HAE region could
be identified in E. pyrifoliae. The two genes hsvA and
hsvC show a high similarity on amino acid level of 86%
and 66%, respectively, to their counterparts in the hrp/
hrc-T3SS. However, a corresponding hsvB-gene was not
found in this cluster but a sequence coding for a putative
capsular exopolysaccharide synthesis protein.
An incomplete T3SS similar to the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and also found in the insect endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidus, may have a distinct
function in Erwinia species [15,34]. This region, spanning
about 20 kbp in E. pyrifoliae and E. tasmaniensis, con-

tains most of the invasion- (invFGEABC), surface presentation of antigens (spaOPQRS) and invasins with the
associated chaperone-genes (sicA, sipB, sipD) as well as
those encoding the needle complex (prgHIJK, orgA).
However, three CDS for conserved hypothetical proteins
were found replacing sipC, an essential invasion gene and
invIJ, encoding putative effectors [35,36]. Furthermore,
the genes sipA, iacP, sicB, sptP, iagB, hilA, orgBC and hilC,
which constitute mainly regulatory components, are lacking. The gene content and order is highly conserved
between E. pyrifoliae and E. tasmaniensis. A similar
island was not found in E. billingiae. However, it remains
unclear, if this T3SS is operative because of the incompleteness in comparison to the SPI-1 and the replaced
genes. Recent results from pathogenicity tests on immature pears with SPI-1-like mutants of E. amylovora indicate that it is not essential for pathogenicity [37]. Even for
Salmonella typhimurium it was shown, that only the initial infection stages are affected in mutants while they
remain pathogenic when applied by different routes [38].
Only few CDS for putative effector proteins could be
identified in the erwinias. Most of those proteins are

Eb661

thought to affect or to be secreted by the T3SS. The suggested effector SrfC of Pectobacterium carotovorum
subsp. atrosepticum is also thought to be exported by
T3SS [39]. E. billingiae carries the srfABC gene cluster
like the other three erwinias, but is lacking the instrumentation for a T3SS. The function of SrfC remains
unclear, in consequence.
Both pathogenic erwinias possess coding sequences for
the SopA protein, which has been characterized as an
effector-like protein in Salmonella influencing the
inflammatory response of mammalian hosts [40]. This
protein is translocated via the Salmonella T3SS on the
SPI-1 into eukaryotic cells and seems to be necessary for
full virulence [41]. Since a similar T3SS has been identified in the pathogenic erwinias, one could assume that
the SopA effector has a particular role in pathogenicity of
those bacteria in plants. It could influence proteins in the
plant cell to alter defence response to bacterial invasion.
Another putatively SPI-1 dependent system found in the
four Erwinia species is composed of the small operon
srfABC, which seems to be regulated by SPI-1 activation
[42]. Repression is accomplished by RcsB and PhoP,

whose coding sequences could be identified in the erwinias. For several effectors the SPI-1 related T3SS may has a
special function, which is different to the hrp/hrc-T3SS
but probably not essential for virulence because it is also
present in the non-pathogenic species E. tasmaniensis.
This would be in accordance to rececently published
results on SPI-1 mutants of E. amylovora [37].
The gene virK, which is secreted by the second Salmonella T3SS found on the pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2)
and regulated by the phoPQ-genes, is a pathogenicity factor of Salmonella sp. [43]. A coding sequence for VirK
was identified in E. tasmaniensis and E. billingiae but not
in the pathogenic erwinias. A possible reason could be
the missing secretion system for this protein, which led to
the loss of the gene in the process of specialization. The
T3SS share a wide homology that could support secretion
by the other systems found in the Erwinia species [30]. A
simple protein export machinery is built by the Type V
secretion system (T5SS), which is found in various bacteria [44]. The main domains, a leader sequence and an
extracellular effector domain, and an outer membrane
export channel, are sometimes encoded on one sequence
and constitute one protein. Because of the self-assembly
and -export they were termed autotransporters. Another
strategy, dubbed two-partner secretion, is characterized
by separate expression of leader-effector protein and the
leader-channel protein. Most effector proteins are
involved in adherence, invasion and degradation [44].
The non-pathogenic E. billingiae is the only species
where we identified genes for corresponding autotransporters (EbC_25980, EbC_37340). They show similarities
to the AidA domain family, which is mainly present in

enteropathogenic bacteria, and pertactin, an autotransporter found in Bordetella sp., respectively. The primary
role of the afore mentioned proteins is adherence to target structures. It may be possible that they substitute the
function of missing fimbrial parts found in the other
Erwinia species, a difference to strains Ep1/96 and Et1/
99.
An emerging class of secretion systems, possibly related
with pathogenicity, is the recently identified Type VI
secretion system (T6SS) in Gram-negative bacteria [45].
Analyses revealed one large (EpC_06160-EpC_06400,
vgrG) and one small cluster (EpC_19520-EpC_19550) in
E. pyrifoliae. Both clusters are present in E. tasmaniensis
and E. billingiae, but show variations in gene content
(Additional file 4). Most of the still uncharacterized genes
are conserved within the clusters. Functions were
assigned for the putative regulator Fha (involved in phosphorylation), the membrane associated proteins such as
Lip (outer membrane lipoprotein), IcmF and DotU (inner
membrane proteins), ClpV (ATPase) and Hcp and VgrG
[46,47]. The proteins Hcp and VgrG are secreted, Hcp
building a tube-like structure for effector delivery, while
VgrG may be an effector-activator or an effector itself
[45]. One CDS, found in E. pyrifoliae (EpC_06280) and E.
billingiae (EbC_05860), of the larger cluster codes for a
putative exported protein, which shows similarities of 5065% to a protein of other plant-pathogenic bacteria such
as Pectobacterium atrosepticum (syn. Erwinia carotovora
ssp. atroseptica) and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. In
case this exported protein has an effector function, it
would match the previous results, that E. tasmaniensis is
missing many other effector proteins [15]. Whether the

Kube et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:393
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/393

secretion systems have an influence on pathogenicity is
undiscernible so far, since only a rudimentary instrumentation was found in E. amylovora. Plant invasion, which
was not confirmed for E. tasmaniensis, may be an important requirement for the function (i.e. translocation of
proteins into dedicated host cells).
For the T6SS essential gene content, function assignment and structural determination is not well advanced.
Most information exist for animal pathogens, but also
plant pathogens may use T6SS [48]. Nevertheless, the
intrinsic role of the T6SS beside T3SS and/or T4SS has
yet to be determined.
Genetics of EPS synthesis by E. pyrifoliae and E. billingiae

Several metabolic factors are considered to play an
important role for causing disease in Erwinia-infected
plants including synthesis of exopolysaccharides (EPS)
i.e. amylovoran or related products and levan production
as well as metabolism of sorbitol and sucrose [49].
The capsular EPS of E. amylovora is amylovoran, which
apparently modulates recognition of the bacteria by plant
defense mechanisms and is a main pathogenicity factor
[50]. The gene cluster for EPS-synthesis of pyrifolan by E.
pyrifoliae also consists of 12 CDS (Additional file 3) with
two adjacent genes for precursor synthesis. The encoded
proteins are at least 85% similar and have a conserved
order for E. pyrifoliae and E. amylovora. The repeating
units of amylovoran and pyrifolan have the same sugar
composition and identical linkages except a missing second side chain of glucose for pyrifolan [22].
No EPS has been identified so far for E. tasmaniensis,
but there is a gene cluster for synthesis of capsular polysaccharide on the chromosome [15]. E. billingiae possesses similar genes but produces an EPS. In alignments
of Cps proteins from E. pyrifoliae and E. billingiae, CpsF
(WceF) have a remarkable divergence, which may indicate specific functions for processing and assembly of the
repeating units of capsular EPS for both species.
E. amylovora produces another EPS, levan, which
serves as quickly generated shield against recognition by
plant defence reactions [51]. The secreted levansucrase,
encoded by lsc, cleaves sucrose into glucose and fructose,
which is subsequently polymerized to levan [52]. Levan is
not strictly necessary for virulence of E. amylovora [51].
Also the non-pathogenic E. tasmaniensis possesses an lsc
gene and produces levan [15]. E. pyrifoliae lacks the lsc
gene, but an orf (EpC_17920) coding for a protein similar
to levanase was identified [22]. Levanase belongs to the βD-fructofuranosidases and can also cleave inulin and
sucrose [53]. Therefore, the enzyme could provide nutrients by cleavage of fructans in plant tissue, and may
degrade levan from synthesizing bacteria, if it is secreted
by E. pyrifoliae.

Sorbitol and sucrose metabolism

A dominant carbohydrate in rosaceous plants is the
transport sugar alcohol sorbitol. In case of E. amylovora
the proteins for its metabolization are encoded by the
genes srlAEBDMR, which could also be identified for E.
pyrifoliae and E. billingiae but not in the genome of E.
tasmaniensis [13,15]. Virulence assays of E. amylovora
srl-mutants showed reduced symptoms on apple seedlings but only weak effects on pear slices due to their low
content of sorbitol. The content of sorbitol is high in
leaves and in transport tissue, and its amount varies during plant development [54].
Sucrose is another important transport sugar in plants.
Mutants of E. amylovora in the scr operon are non-virulent [14]. The disaccharide is actively transported into the
cells and subsequently cleaved. Besides the repressor
gene scrR, four genes encoding steps in sucrose metabolism are present in E. amylovora, E. pyrifoliae and E. tasmaniensis. The genes scrKYABR are located in an operon
for these three species, but E. tasmaniensis carries a second copy of scrAB [15]. Alignments with MAUVE of the
srl regions of E. pyrifoliae and E. billingiae as well as the
scr region of E. pyrifoliae and E. tasmaniensis show a
remarkable similarity for these gene clusters including
the second scrAB copy in the genome of E. tasmaniensis
(Figure 4) [55]. This region does not completely comprise
the scrAB gene cluster, but is extended to 400 bp downstream of scrB and to a partial similarity at 1000 bp
upstream of scrA.
An interesting feature of E. billingiae is its possible ability to metabolize xylitol. This sugar alcohol is widely distributed in nature and can interfere with bacterial
activities [56]. E. billingiae may degrade xylitol to avoid
interference with its growth and to use it as a carbon
source despite its low nutritional value. A similar gene is
missing in the genomes of E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96 and
the E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99. On the other hand, E.
tasmaniensis strain Et2/99 can grow with xylitol as carbon source [16].
Miscellaneous determinants with potential impact to
virulence of pathogenic erwinias

A striking difference between the pathogenic species E.
pyrifoliae and the non-pathogenic E. tasmaniensis is the
existence of a nearly complete Type I fimbrial gene cluster in the latter one (Additional file 3). Enterobacterial
Type I fimbriae are implied to be involved in cell attachment and adhesion to surfaces leading to biofilm formation [57]. Beside being a virulence determinant the
fimbriae may therefore be a tool of epiphytic bacteria for
colonization and protection against environmental
effects. Without production of a capsular polysaccharide
by E. tasmaniensis, the fimbriae may replace the capsules

profile of the alignment in the progressive mode is shown in red [55]. The height of the bars corresponds to the average level of conservation in the
sequence. White boxes indicate genes. The alignment of the sucrose operons (A-D) comprise nucleotide sequences of E. amylovora strain CFBP 1430

99 (C; Acc. No. CU468135, positions 2119695- 2126241). The genes scrA and scrB are duplicated in the genome of E. tasmaniensis Et1/99 (D; positions
1064052- 1070604). There is a continuous homology in the sucrose operons shown in the similarity profiles. Alignment of the sorbitol operons (E-G)
comprises nucleotide sequences of E. amylovora strain Ea7/74 (E; Acc. No. Y14603, positions 276- 4479), E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96 (F; Acc. No. FP236842,
positions 668798- 672810) and E. billingiae strain Eb661 (G; Acc. No. FP236843, positions 2907872- 2911878).

Kube et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:393
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/393

to allow bacterial aggregation [15]. This is supported by
the lack of a Type I fimbrial gene cluster in E. billingiae,
which produces EPS and may thus not depend on fimbriae. On the other hand, the existence of Type I fimbriae
may induce plant defence responses comparable to the
effect of FimH on mammalian cells [58].
While the distribution of Type I fimbriae genes seems
to differ, all Erwinia species except E. billingiae possess a
comparable incomplete instrumentation of K88 (F4) fimbriae genes. These fimbriae were found in enterotoxigenic E. coli strains and identified as virulence factors, to
determine attachment to specific receptors of intestinal
cells [59]. The cluster, build up with faeBCDEFGHIJ,
could be reconstructed except for the regulator FaeB and
the component FaeJ, without known expression and
function [60]. However, a CDS coding for a possible regulatory protein was found in E. pyrifoliae instead of FaeB,
leading to the assumption that functional F4 fimbriae
participate in adhesion of these species. There are no
hints if they are related to pathogenicity.
Another gene cluster first described in enterotoxigenic
E. coli strains and also found in the erwinias forms the
class 5 fimbriae with the surface antigen CS14 in the csuABCDE-operon [61]. They are involved for E. coli in
attachment to specific intestinal epithelial cells. Whether
F4 and class 5 fimbriae have a cumulative effect by adhering to receptors of the same cells or aim at different cells
and have specific functions is difficult to determine on
the molecular level. Since both, pathogenic and nonpathogenic, Erwinia species possess these genes, their
role in pathogenicity is unclear.
Furthermore, genes for the global regulator of fimbrial
expression, the heat-stable nucleoid-structuring protein
(hns), are present in the erwinias [59]. In E. amylovora, E.
pyrifoliae, E. billingiae and E. tasmaniensis, copies of an
hns gene are located on the chromosome and also on a
plasmid. E. tasmaniensis carries two chromosomal hns
genes. The global regulator also affects EPS synthesis and
the protein binds to the lsc promoter region of E. amylovora [62].
Strain Eb661 encodes several matrix components necessary for biofilm formation. Genes for cellulose synthesis
(bsc- and bcs-operon) were identified as well as a CDS for
the surface protein BapA. This instrumentation is similar
to biofilm producing Salmonella species [63]. Several
potential adhesion factors such as hemaglutinin-like proteins may support surface colonization [64].
The three Erwinia species share a common set of genes
for proteases and siderophore production, which are
important virulence factors in soft rot erwinias [65]. Two
proteases (PtrA, PtrB) and siderophores (encoded by
foxR, dfoA, alcA) may help in colonization and acquisition
of nutrients [15,66]. Interestingly, the protease operon for
the secreted enzyme PrtA, connected with virulence of E.

Page 11 of 15

amylovora, is not represented in the genomes of E. pyrifoliae, E. tasmaniensis or E. billingiae [67].
Furthermore, virulence factors such as the cytotoxic
necrotizing factors Cnf1 and Cnf2 were identified. These
proteins were connected with pathogenic E. coli strains to
alter signal transduction resulting in modified cell morphology and cell cycles as well as decreased phagocytosis
of the bacteria [68,69]. Cnf1 was shown to inhibit apoptosis, which may help bacteria to survive after cell invasion
and grow in an adapted environment [70]. In the case of
the Erwinia species which have been investigated, cnf1and cnf2-genes could be identified in all species except E.
billingiae, a possible role of Cnf may be to weaken
defence response therefore helping the bacteria to spread.
Cnf is thought to influence transcription factors via
effects on signal transduction [71].
A striking feature of E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96 is the
presence of an assumed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS; suggested name EppT; EpC_11160) with a
size of 7028 aa. It shows similarities to several non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). It shows high similarity with a protein of unknown function from
Photorhabdus luminescens (syn. Xenorhabdus luminescens), an enterobacterial pathogen of insects and an
NRPS of the distantly related soft rot pathogen P. atrosepticum SCRI1043 encoded in an island typical for horizontal gene transfer [39,72]. Similar NRPS proteins are also
encoded in the genome of E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99
and E. billingiae strain Eb661, but differ in size and
domain content (Figure 5). According to a prediction program the NRPS-encoding ORF of E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/
96 contains six modules for the synthesis of a hexameric
peptide with Ala-Thr-Thr-Gln-Phe-Ser [73]. The NRPS
proteins in the genome of E. billingiae and E. tasmaniensis are considerably smaller with an encoding capacity for
possible attachment of modified Leu-Leu-Xaa and Ser,
respectively. No significant relation to the modules to the
analogous E. pyrifoliae region can be deduced. The short
NRPS-regions may only encode small modified peptides.
The presence of the eppT gene in strain Ep1/96 may be
a result of an integration event as it is indicated by the
phage integrase located upstream. Similar proteins could
be identified in other plant pathogens such as P. syringae
pv. syringae, which has been involved in synthesis of the
phytotoxin syringomycin [74]. This list can be extended
to several plant pathogens such as Ralstonia solanacearum and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri, but also
to the non-pathogenic species Pseudomonas fluorescens[39]. The NRPSs vary in size (e.g. 3351 aa for Et1/99
compared to 7028 aa for Ep1/96) [75]. The NRPS of E.
pyrifoliae and the one of P. atrosepticum show a similar
length (7028 aa/7523 aa) and nearly 6000 aa could be
aligned with an identity of at least 41%.

evolutionary adaptation process resulting in the specialization as a plant pathogen. The genetic distance between
the pathogenic Erwinia species and E. tasmaniensis is
small, and larger to E. billingiae, which has a tendency to
invade necrotic tissue of plants. Several differences in
genes and their expression apparently restrict E. tasmaniensis to exist as an epiphyte on plant surfaces. This
enables the species to survive especially on flowers and
supports its potential to compete with pathogens such as
E. amylovora and possibly E. pyrifoliae.

Conclusions
The comparative analysis of E. billingiae strain Eb661, E.
tasmaniensis strain Et1/99 and E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96
highlights the different genome organization within this
genus driven by recombination events. The genomes of
these epiphytic and pathogenic bacteria show high accordance of single genes and gene clusters, which are potential virulence factors in pathogenic species. The
difference in lifestyle may depend on protein secretion
and invasion into plants. E. billingiae lacks any T3SS in
contrast to E. tasmaniensis and E. pyrifoliae. Differences
between both pathogenic E. amylovora and E. pyrifoliae
and the non-pathogenic E. tasmaniensis include a lack of
the HAE-region in the hrp/hrc-T3SS, of the SopA and
PagC proteins and the presence of a VirK protein and
putatively of Type I fimbriae. E. billingiae shows much
larger variations, e.g. apparently more possibilities for
biofilm formation and adhesion, no synthesis or utilization of levan, the absence of a non-ribosomal peptide
synthetase similar to EppT and a T3SS with the HAEregion, the SopA protein and possesses a VirK protein.
Therefore, those components probably represent factors
to describe pathogenic and non-pathogenic Erwinia species. Factors such as synthesis of EPS and levan, utilization of sugar and sugar alcohols as well as expression of
proteases and siderophores may be related to nutrient
acquisition and to modulate plant defence.
The role of the NRPS in the pathogenic strain Ep1/96
remains unclear. A phytotoxin could be an advantage in
weakening the plant during the colonization and can
explain differences in the habitat of Erwinia species.
Virulence for E. pyrifoliae may depend on the factors
summarized in this section. Accumulation in the genome
of E. pyrifoliae could be interpreted as the result of an

Methods
Genome determination

E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96 (DSM 12162) and E. billingiae
strain Eb661 (DSM 17872) were cultured as described
previously [11,18]. DNA was isolated with the Genomic
DNA kit (Qiagen, Hildesheim, Germany) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The genomic sequences
were determined by whole genome shotgun sequencing
using Sanger based sequencing technology and pyrosequencing.
The genomes of E. pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96 and E.
billingiae strain Eb661 were covered by short insert shotgun libraries with 1.5 and 2.5 kb inserts and fosmid libraries with 37 kb inserts (CopyControl™ Fosmid Library
Production Kit, Epicentre, Madison, U.S.A.) [76]. Endsequencing was performed on recombinant plasmids
using BigDye 3.1 chemistry and 3730XL capillary
sequencers (ABI, Darmstadt, Germany) resulting in a 9fold sequencing coverage for strain Ep1/96 and a 11-fold
sequencing coverage for strain Eb661. The high number
of fosmid reads (24,252 and 7,096) resulted in one uncovered chromosomal region for strain Ep1/96 and a complete physical coverage by fosmid clones of the
chromosome of strain Eb661. To reduce finishing experiments pyrosequencing was performed using the GS20
sequencer for strain Ep1/96 and the GS FLX platform for
strain Eb661 (both 454 life science/Roche) resulting in an
additional 25-fold (1,043,447 reads) and 8-fold (194,142
reads) sequencing coverage, respectively.
Data assembly was performed for strain Ep1/96 within
two steps. GS20 data were initially assembled by Newbler
(454 life science/Roche) and the resulting contigs were
fragmented using PERL scripts resulting in overlapping
sequence fragments, which were assigned as forward and
reverse reads in fasta format and the corresponding fasta
quality files. The thus obtained faked reads were assembled together with the Sanger derived processed reads
using PhredPhrap http://www.phrap.org. GS FLX data
and Sanger derived reads for strain Eb661 were assembled using the Celera assembler [77]. Assembled data for
both projects were imported into Consed, edited and verified. Finishing experiments were performed by primer-

walking on bridging clones and PCR products to improve
sequence quality and gap closure [78].
Genome annotation and comparison

Protein coding sequences were predicted by Glimmer3
and manually curated in Artemis [79,80]. Artemis was
also used to calculate cumulative GC-skews [(G-C)/
(G+C)] of the chromosomes. The genome sequences
were annotated with HTGA [81]. Structural rRNAs and
tRNAs were determined using RNAmmer and tRNAscan-SE [82,83]. Integrated bacteriophages were predicted by PhageFinder [84]. Furthermore, sequence
analysis was improved using the RAST analysis platform
[85]. NRPSs content was subsequently analysed by Pfam
http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ and specificity prediction
(NRPSredictor,
http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/toolbox/) [73].
Genome comparisons were performed for E. billingiae
strain Eb661 (this study), E. tasmaniensis strain Et1/99, E.
pyrifoliae strain Ep1/96 (this study) and partial sequences
of E. amylovora strain Ea273 [15]. The complete genome
sequence of E. amylovora strain Ea273 (ATCC 49946) was
published recently: FN666575, FN666576, and
FN666577. Conserved synteny was examined using ACT
with the big_blast.pl script (5000 bases sequence size;
BLASTN algorithm) [86].
Core and pan genome for the deduced proteins were
analysed by BLASTCLUST http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
and parsed through a script to obtain intersections. Numbers were calculated using an identity of 60%, an alignment length of 70% and an e-value of 1e-6 at least as
cutoffs for these analyses. The utilized scripts were
implemented in a new public web-service at http://
www.reziclust.molgen.mpg.de, which allows recalculation of results as well as performing new analyses. Results
were parsed in addition through scripts for visualization
of the present or absent potential orthologs within each
genome.
Potential paralogs were estimated using BLAST [87].
Deduced protein sets of the chromosomes were compared against themselves and filtered with MSPcrunch
using a minimal identity of 90% for this purpose [88].
