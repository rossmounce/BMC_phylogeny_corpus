variation in sleep patterns of rodents

Abstract
Background: In humans, rapid eye movements (REM) density during REM sleep plays a prominent role in
psychiatric diseases. Especially in depression, an increased REM density is a vulnerability marker for depression. In
clinical practice and research measurement of REM density is highly standardized. In basic animal research, almost
no tools are available to obtain and systematically evaluate eye movement data, although, this would create
increased comparability between human and animal sleep studies.
Methods: We obtained standardized electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG) and
electrooculographic (EOG) signals from freely behaving mice. EOG electrodes were bilaterally and chronically
implanted with placement of the electrodes directly between the musculus rectus superior and musculus rectus
lateralis. After recovery, EEG, EMG and EOG signals were obtained for four days. Subsequent to the implantation
process, we developed and validated an Eye Movement scoring in Mice Algorithm (EMMA) to detect REM as
singularities of the EOG signal, based on wavelet methodology.
Results: The distribution of wakefulness, non-REM (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was typical
of nocturnal rodents with small amounts of wakefulness and large amounts of NREM sleep during the light period
and reversed proportions during the dark period. REM sleep was distributed correspondingly. REM density was
significantly higher during REM sleep than NREM sleep. REM bursts were detected more often at the end of the
dark period than the beginning of the light period. During REM sleep REM density showed an ultradian course,
and during NREM sleep REM density peaked at the beginning of the dark period. Concerning individual eye
movements, REM duration was longer and amplitude was lower during REM sleep than NREM sleep. The majority
of single REM and REM bursts were associated with micro-arousals during NREM sleep, but not during REM sleep.
Conclusions: Sleep-stage specific distributions of REM in mice correspond to human REM density during sleep.
REM density, now also assessable in animal models through our approach, is increased in humans after acute
stress, during PTSD and in depression. This relationship can now be exploited to match animal models more
closely to clinical situations, especially in animal models of depression.

Background
Already in 1875 electrical activity from the brains of
rabbits and monkeys was described [1] and by the early
1930s, all major findings in electroencephalograms
(EEG) alterations during wakefulness and sleep in general had been discovered [2-6]. It was not until 1953
that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was first
described in humans with rapid, jerky and binocularly
symmetrical eye movements as a level of neuronal activity encountered normally during sleep [7]. Since then,
these for REM sleep eponymous activities have been
found in many non-mammalian (e.g. in birds [8] and
reptiles [9]) and mammalian species (e.g. in cats [10-15],
rats [16-21] and mice [22-26]).
In humans, REM density - the frequency of REM during
REM sleep, increases over the night for successive REM
sleep episodes [27-29]. REM density decreases during
recovery sleep, after sleep deprivation [30-36] and
increases during extended sleep [37-40], with direct relationship to prior sleep duration [33,36]. The occurrence of
REM during REM sleep closely relates to the occurrence
of ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves in animals [41]
and possibly also in humans [42-44]. In animals these
PGO waves have important functions in brain development and plasticity [45]. In humans increased REM density has been found after learning tasks [46-48] and,
interestingly, donezepil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
that is used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, was
found to increase REM density and memory in healthy
subjects [49-51].
An increased REM density has been found in patients
suffering from psychiatric diseases such as post traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) [52] or depression [53]. Indeed,
increased REM density has been suggested to be an
endophenotype for depression [54,55], as it is systematically elevated in depressed patients [56,57]. REM density
has also been associated with treatment outcome [58-60],
and in studies of high risk subjects, such as relatives of
depressed patients, increases in REM density were present before the onset of the disorder and predicted its
development [61-64].
REM sleep and REM density in humans are significantly
affected by psychopharmacological drugs. In particular,
many antidepressants such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), tricyclic antidepressants and also selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) strongly, rapidly and
lastingly reduce REM sleep [65,66]. While these antidepressants suppress the absolute and relative REM sleep
amount, REM density increases with continued treatment
[67].
It follows that REM density, i.e. the quantitative analysis of REM during REM sleep, is an important parameter in the assessment of human sleep and it would,

Page 2 of 13

therefore, be of considerable interest to study this parameter in animals as well.
Standard procedures for obtaining meaningful data on
sleep/wake behavior of laboratory animals generally
include recordings of EEG and electromyograms (EMG).
The techniques of chronic EEG and EMG electrode
implantations are rather standardized and routinely utilized in many laboratories. It is remarkable that the
recording of REM during sleep has been applied only in
very few experiments in basic animal research so far,
although, already more than 30 years ago electrooculograms (EOG) were used to characterize basic sleep/wake
behavior in mice [22]. In a few, more recent experiments
qualitative analyses of EOG were applied to characterize
the sleep architecture of mice with a modified serotonin
system [26,68] or for the description of ultradian cycles
in the same animals [69]. EOG were also applied to characterize sleep/wake behavior of mice treated with hypnotic compounds, used for the treatment of insomnia [70],
or to describe the EEG of mice treated with X-rays [71].
To our knowledge none of the previous studies that
recorded EOG in rodents presented quantitative analyses
of EOG, i.e. assessed REM density. The potential role of
such an approach lies in an in-depth characterization of
sleep/wake behavior in animal models, for example for
depression, which could then be more closely related to
reports from human studies, where REM density in REM
sleep is a standard parameter in data collection and data
interpretation. It would also have the potential to characterize and evaluate the effect of medications with a closer
relation to clinical situations.
In the present study, we introduce a standardized and
well-defined approach to measure and automatically
analyze REM during sleep in mice.

Methods
Animal housing

6 adult mice (C57BL/6J, Harlan-Winkelmann, Germany)
were used in the experiments. All animals were housed
in individual recording cages located in a sound attenuated chamber at constant temperature (22 ± 1°C) and
controlled light-dark cycles (12-12 h, lights on: 12 am at
100l×) during habituation, recovery from surgery and
during all recording sessions. Food and water were available ad libitum.
Experimental design

All animals were adapted to the light-dark cycle for seven
days before surgery. After surgery all animals were
allowed to recover for another 14 days before two days of
baseline recordings started (B1; B2), followed by two days
of treatment recordings (T1; T2). During treatment, each
animal received two oak flakes per day, saturated with

Fulda et al. BMC Neuroscience 2011, 12:110

Page 3 of 13

the following solution: 0.2% saccharine, 0.05% vanillin in
5 μl aqua dest./oak flake. To ensure acceptance of the
oak flakes at ZT0, all animals where food deprived for
four hours prior to its presentation. This treatment was
designed in anticipation of future studies, where we plan
for the application of several antidepressants via this routine to systematically study the effects of these drugs on
REM during sleep. After termination of the experiments
animals were euthanized with an overdose of sodium
pentobarbital.
Surgery

During surgery the animals were fixed in a stereotaxic
apparatus. For anaesthesia a isofloran/oxygen mixture
was constantly delivered through a respiratory mask
(custom made) and body temperature was maintained
with a small heating pad. Before and after surgery, all
animals received atropine sulphate (0.05 mg/kg BW,
Braun Melsungen, Germany) and meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg
BW, Braun Melsungen, Germany). Two EOG electrodes
were placed bilaterally on the dorsal field of the eye
muscles within the orbit (please refer to Figure 1 for
details). These electrodes where insulated with cured
coating (Konform SR, ITW Chemitronics, United Kingdom) prior to implantation, only the tip of the electrodes had ohmic contact with the surface of the eye
muscles. Four EEG electrodes where placed epidurally
on the intact cerebral membranes of the cortex through
small holes in the skull (diameter: ca. 250 μm). Two
electrodes were inserted into the neck muscle to record
EMG signals. All electrodes (gold wire, diameter: 150
μm, with ball-shaped endings) were soldered to a connector (PCB socket connector) which was affixed to the
skull with Paladur and two jeweller’s screws. The position of each individual recording electrode and especially the EOG electrodes were carefully inspected for
proper placement and possible inflammations at tissue
surrounding the electrode tips after termination of the
experiment. Only animals without any tissue abnormalities and proper placement of the EOG electrodes were
used for further analyses.
EOG/EEG/EMG recordings

After surgery, animals were connected to an 8-pole
recording cable. EEG, EMG, and EOG signals were
relayed via the sliding contact of a head unit that was
attached to a counter-balanced swivel system, and which
allowed for free and undisturbed movement of the animals during recordings. All signals were fed into a preamplifier (1000×, custom made) and main amplifier
(10×, custom made). The EEG and EOG signals were
analog band-pass filtered (0.5-29 Hz, filter frequency roll
off 48 dB/octave) and analog-to-digital converted at a
sampling rate of 64 Hz (AD board, NI PCI-6070,

Figure 1 Dorsal view of the skull illustrating the placement of
electrodes. The EOG electrodes penetrated the connective tissue
separating the orbit from the frontal bone (os frontale) bilaterally.
Both electrodes were gently born around the musculus rectus
lateralis without penetrating the muscle tissue. The two rostral EEG
electrodes were placed centrally at the frontal bone, a third EEG
electrode and one grounding electrode were placed caudally at the
parietal bone (os parietale). Two EMG electrodes were inserted in
neck muscles bilaterally (adapted from: www.informatics.jax.org).

National Instruments, Austin, USA). Root mean square
was applied to the non-filtered EMG signals before its
digital conversion (sample rate: 64 Hz). The digital data
were stored for further offline-analysis.
Automated scoring of eye movements

The Eye Movement scoring in Mice Algorithm (EMMA)
conceptualized REM as singularities of the EOG signal
and used wavelet methodology to detect them [72]. The
EOG signal was wavelet filtered, eliminating the lower
frequencies, and a continuous wavelet transform with the
Mexican hat wavelet was computed. Wavelet transform
modulus maxima were used to identify singularity candidates at the smallest scale against a threshold derived
from the variation of the wavelet transform modulus.
These candidates were subjected to two thresholds: a) an
amplitude criterion (> 4*85th percentile of the signal or <
4*15th percentile of the signal) to ensure that REM was
decidedly higher than the baseline signal and to protect
against regular high frequency artifacts; b) the absolute

Fulda et al. BMC Neuroscience 2011, 12:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/12/110

lag-2 difference of the signal had to be higher than 2*95th
quantile of the lag-2 differences of the signal that did not
include REM candidates. All threshold criteria were
derived from a training set that was independent from
the validation set (see below). Automated detection was
programmed in R [73] and made use of the Rwave package [74]. Details of the EMMA algorithms are given in
the appendix.
Each REM was conceptualized as having a start, a peak,
and a stop and each of these time points was defined in
terms of peaks of the signal. Peaks were defined as points
where the direction of the signal changed from downward
to upward deflection or vice versa. The peak of REM was
detected with the EMMA algorithm, the start was defined
as the nearest change point before the peak and the end
was the nearest change point after the peak. A complete
REM, therefore, consisted of a down- or upward initial
deflection and the following opposite deflection.
The following parameters were extracted for each REM:
amplitude (measured in mV at the peak of REM), duration
of REM (measured from start to end), velocity of the initial
and opposite deflection (measured in mV/ms for start to
peak and peak to stop of REM), and direction of REM
(upward or downward deflection).

measures design. Significant main or interaction effects in
ANOVA were followed by a post hoc test for simple
effects (Student-Newman-Keuls test, a = 0.05).
REM density and REM parameters were computed separately for each animal and day, for REM sleep and NREM
sleep and for different time spans (whole day, light and
dark period, 2 hour intervals). Comparison between sleep
stages, days and time periods were undertaken with linear
mixed models [77] that treated animals as the random factor. In addition, we quantified trait-like stability of REM
density and sleep stage duration with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICC was computed as the
ratio of between-animal variance to total variance with
variance derived from a linear mixed model analysis. ICC
values were interpreted according to benchmark ranges as
“slight” (0-0.2), “fair” (0.2-0.4), “moderate” (0.4-0.6), “substantial” (0.6-0.8) and “almost perfect” (0.8-1.0) [78]. Data
analysis was undertaken with R [73] and the nlme package
[79] in R.
Animal care

Laboratory animal care and experiments were conducted
in accordance with the regulations of the current version of German Law and Animal Protection. Animal
protocols were approved by the Government of Bavaria.

Validation of automated scoring of REM

The automated scoring was validated against visual scoring by two of the authors (SF, TF) in 260 randomly
selected epochs (130 REM sleep, 130 non rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep)) recorded at B1. A comparison
between the two visual scorers showed a sensitivity of 92%
with a specificity of 86% yielding a positive predictive
value (PPV) of 79% and a negative predictive value (NPV)
of 91%. Comparison of automated scoring and visual scoring showed comparable indices with a sensitivity of 84%
and a specificity of 87% (PPV 81%; NPV 89%) for the first
scorer and 86% for both sensitivity and specificity for the
second scorer (PPV 79%, NPV 91%).
Data analysis

The vigilance states WAKE, NREM sleep and REM sleep
were scored semi-automatically using a FFT-algorithm
spectral analysis from all recordings on a LabVIEW ®based scoring program (SEA, Koeln, Germany). The frequency bands were as follows: δ (0.75-5 Hz), θ (6-9 Hz), a
(10-15 Hz), h (16-22.75 Hz) and b (23-31.75 Hz). A
detailed description of the scoring procedure is described
elsewhere [75,76]. All semi automatically scored vigilance
states were inspected manually and rescored if needed.
All three vigilance states (WAKE, NREM sleep and REM
sleep) were calculated in consecutive two hour means.
Effects of treatment and time intervals were evaluated for
23 hours without a separation in dark and light period
with 2-factorial analyses of variance with a repeated

Results
A) General sleep/wake behavior

The analysis of the vigilance states revealed small amounts
of wakefulness and large amounts of NREM sleep during
the light period and increased wakefulness and decreased
NREM sleep during the dark period (Figure 2). For the
vigilance states WAKE (F(5,11) = 1.805; ptime vs. treatment =
0.075) and NREM sleep (F(5,11) = 1.513; ptime vs. treatment =
0.154) no statistically significant interactions were found.
As for NREM sleep, the amount of REM sleep was highest
during the light period and decreased to its nadir towards
the first two hours of the dark period. Significant differences in REM sleep between baseline and treatment were
found at ZT6- ZT12 and ZT22 (F(5,11) = 2.705; p ZT6 <
0.001; pZT8 = 0.019; pZT10 = 0.035; pZT12 = 0.035; pZT22 =
0.042).
B) REM characteristics
Proportion of REM in REM bursts

For all animals and days, 37% of all REM occurred in
bursts of at least two individual eye movements. This
percentage was higher for NREM sleep (41%) than REM
sleep (33%, F(1,29) = 21.16, p < 0.001). There was no overall difference between the light and the dark period but
we found a day × light/dark interaction (F (2,61) = 3.43,
p = 0.0387) where only for day B2 the percentage of
REM in bursts was lower for the light period than the
dark period (34% vs. 41%, p < 0.05) while for the two

Figure 2 Distribution of vigilance states. Typically for a nocturnal rodent, wakefulness was strongly reduced during the light period (ZT0ZT12), compared to the dark period (ZT12-ZT22). Inversed patterns were obtained for NREM sleep and REM sleep with significant differences
between baseline and treatment recordings only for REM sleep (asterisks). Data points represent two hour means ± SEM. Gray background
indicates the dark period.

Fulda et al. BMC Neuroscience 2011, 12:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/12/110

following recording days (T1, T2) there was no difference. The proportion of REM in bursts differed across 2hour intervals (F(10,347) = 2.25, p = 0.015) and was lower
at the beginning of the light period (ZT2) and higher at
the end of the dark period (ZT20, p < 0.05) (Figure 3A).
In addition, REM bursts during NREM sleep tended to
consist of a higher number of REM (Figure 3B).
Direction of REM

Overall, as many downward as upward deflections of REM
were recorded (54% vs 46%, F(1,65) = 1.19, p = 0.2795). The
proportion of upward deflections tended to be less for
REM sleep than NREM sleep (42% vs 48%, F(1,29) = 5.84,
p = 0.0221). There was no difference for the proportion of
upward deflections between the light and the dark period
or between 2-hour time intervals.
Duration of REM

The average duration of all REM was 95 ± 36 ms and the
distribution of all individual REM durations is given in
Figure 3C. REM duration was longer during REM sleep
than during NREM sleep (104 ± 4.8 vs. 90 ± 3.5, F(1,63) =
167.36, p < = .001). REM duration was also longer for
REM in bursts (97 ± 3.5 vs. 92 ± 3.9, F(1,63) = 15.92, p <
0.001) but these two factors interacted significantly (sleep
stage × burst interaction, F(1,63) = 16.26, p < 0.001). Specifically, during REM sleep, REM duration did not differ
between isolated REM and REM in bursts (104 ± 4.9 vs.
104 ± 6.0) while during NREM sleep isolated REM were
shorter than REM in bursts (87 ± 4.3 vs. 95 ± 3.7, p <
0.05). There was no difference in REM duration between
the light and the dark period. REM duration varied across
2-hour intervals (F(10,698) = 4.056, p < 0.001) with REM
duration being shorter at the beginning of the dark period
(ZT14 and ZT16 vs. all other intervals, p < 0.05).
Amplitude of REM

The average magnitude of the amplitude of all REM was
124 ± 83 mV (including amplification) and the distribution
of all individual REM amplitudes is given in Figure 3D.
Similar to REM duration, the amplitude was lower for
REM during REM sleep than NREM sleep (F (1,63) =
365.82, p < 0.001), it was lower for isolated REM compared to REM in bursts (F(1,63) = 533.16, p < 0.001), but
there was also a significant interaction between sleep stage
and burst status (F(1,63) = 261.14, p < 0.001). In particular,
although the amplitude was lower during REM sleep than
NREM sleep for both isolated and burst REM, the increase
in amplitude from isolated to burst REM was significantly
larger during NREM sleep (from 96 ± 18.2 to 193 ± 18.0)
than during REM sleep (from 89 ± 8.5 to 106.14.9, p <
0.05). REM amplitude did not differ between the light and
dark period or across 2-hour intervals.
C) REM density and REM burst density

REM density was computed as the number of REM per
4s epochs. We computed both total REM density and

Page 6 of 13

REM burst density. For the total recording period, REM
density was significantly higher during REM sleep than
during NREM sleep (0.96 ± 0.33 vs. 0.18 ± 0.06, F(1,29) =
203.709, p < 0.001). While there was no systematic difference in REM density between the light and the dark
period, for both REM sleep and NREM sleep, REM density differed across the recording period (Figure 3E) with
a significant interaction between sleep stage and time
interval (F(10,340) = 2.009, p = 0.0317). For NREM sleep,
REM density peaked at the beginning of the dark period.
For REM sleep, REM density showed ultradian changes
with troughs at ZT2, ZT8 and ZT16 (Figure 3E).
Density of REM bursts (burst density) was significantly
higher for REM sleep than for NREM sleep (0.14 ± 0.06
vs. 0.02 ± 0.01, F(1,29) = 121.939, p < 0.001). Again, there
was no difference between the light and the dark period.
Although burst density during REM sleep varied similar
to REM density during REM sleep, there was no significant difference between 2-hour intervals (F (10,158) =
1.185, p = 0.305). In contrast, burst density during
NREM sleep again peaked at the beginning of the dark
period (Figure 3F; F(10,177) = 2.975, p = 0.0017).
Trait-like stability of REM density

We used ICCs to quantify trait-like stability of REM density during REM sleep and NREM sleep. For descriptive
purposes the stability of REM sleep and NREM sleep duration is given as a further comparison standard. Figures 4A
and 4B give the individual REM density and sleep stage
proportions per animal and night. Trait-like stability,
quantified as the ratio of between-animal variance to total
variance, was almost perfect for REM densities during
REM sleep and NREM sleep for the total recording period
or the light period (Figure 4C). For the dark period alone,
REM density during REM sleep was only moderate, while
REM density during NREM sleep was substantial. As a
comparison standard, stability of REM sleep proportion
was only fair for the total recording period and the light
period and moderate for the dark period. In contrast, stability of NREM sleep proportion was substantial for all
three periods. For the total recording period and the light
period, trait-like stability was higher for REM densities
than sleep stage proportions.
D) REM bursts and micro arousals

Given that during NREM sleep REM bursts were relatively
more frequent than isolated REM, and compared to REM
sleep, REM bursts during NREM sleep consisted of more
REM with a higher amplitude and a longer duration, as
well as the peak of REM bursts at the beginning of the
dark period for NREM sleep, we explored whether REM
bursts during NREM sleep could be associated with transient micro arousals defined as short EMG increases (< 4
sec). To that end, we randomly chose 360 epochs with
REM bursts (10 epochs × 6 animals × 3 days × 2 sleep

during REM sleep than NREM sleep (* The proportion was lower at ZT2 than at ZT8-ZT12 and ZT18-ZT22 (p < 0.05); # The proportion was higher at
ZT20 than at ZT5 and ZT13 (p < 0.05)). B: Number of REM in REM bursts. REM bursts during NREM sleep tended to include a higher number of REM
than during REM sleep. C: Distribution of all recorded REM durations. REM duration was computed as the difference in milliseconds between the
start and the end of the REM. D: Distribution of all recorded REM amplitudes. REM amplitude was computed as absolute difference from zero at the
peak of the REM in mV. E: REM density in REM sleep and NREM sleep differed across the recording period. REM density during NREM sleep showed
increased density at the beginning of the dark period. (* REM sleep REM density at ZT16 was significantly lower than ZT4 to ZT6; ZT10 to ZT14, and
ZT18 to ZT22; # REM sleep REM density was significantly lower at ZT2 than ZT10, ZT12, and ZT18 to ZT22; + REM sleep REM density was
significantly lower at ZT8 than ZT12 and ZT22; § NREM sleep REM density was significantly higher at ZT14 than all other time intervals; (p < 0.05 for
all comparisons)). F: REM burst density in REM sleep did not differ across the light and dark period. REM density during NREM sleep showed
increased density at the beginning of the dark period (ZT14-ZT22). A REM burst was defined as at least two eye movements not faster than 200 ms
apart (* NREM sleep REM burst density at ZT14 was significantly higher than at all other times (p < 0.05)).

stages) and 360 epochs with isolated REM. At the time of
evaluation we were blind with regard to sleep stage, day or
animal. The majority of REM bursts during NREM sleep
were associated with micro arousals (72.8%) while this percentage was significantly lower during REM sleep (7.2%;
Chi2 = 158.4, df = 1, p < 0.0001, Figure 5). Similarly, single
REM were associated more frequently with micro arousals
during NREM sleep than during REM sleep, however, in
an overall lower proportion (32.2% vs. 10.0%, Chi2 = 25.4,
df = 1, p < 0.0001).

Discussion
Standard procedures to obtain meaningful data about the
sleep/wake behavior of laboratory animals generally
include recordings of the EEG and the EMG. The

techniques of chronic EEG and EMG electrode implantations are routinely utilized in many laboratories. Sophisticated algorithms and the experience of the researchers in
the handling of data being obtained in basic research
with laboratory animals allow differentiation between
wakefulness, NREM sleep and REM sleep. In the present
study we provide a complementary element of sleep data
analysis, based on a highly standardized evaluation of eye
movements (EMMA). We found that REM density
recorded across three nights showed remarkable intraindividual trait-like stability. REM density was significantly higher during REM sleep than during NREM sleep
and this sleep-stage specific distribution corresponds
with human REM density. While REM density during
REM sleep showed an ultradian course, during NREM

and NREM sleep associated with micro-arousals or without micro arousals. Right upper panel: REM bursts were more frequently associated

sleep REM density peaked at the beginning of the dark
period. The majority of single REM and REM bursts
were associated with micro arousals during NREMS, but
not during REMS.
The present configuration of the EOG electrodes was
designed to record eye muscle activities per se with the
electrode placed between the musculus rectus lateralis
and musculus rectus superior. The gold wires used in
our study could be replaced by multiple wires such as
those used to record with tetrodes. Single wires could
then be brought individually to the musculus rectus
superior and the left and right musculus rectus lateralis.
Although not part of our study, this extension of the
present electrode configuration would allow differentiating between dorsal and lateral eye movements. Provided

that the morphological components of the recorded
potentials from separated dorsal and lateral eye movements are similar to the potentials we obtained, the
EMMA algorithm could be applied with only minor
adaptations in threshold detection. We doubt that the
musculus rectus inferior could be equipped solidly with
electrodes to record ventral eye movements with the
present approach.
We found REM not only during REM sleep but also
during NREM sleep in mice. One possible concern could
therefore be that REM during NREM sleep are due to the
EEG signals, in particular the large slow potentials, contaminating the EOG signal. We judge this as unlikely for
several reasons. First, we designed a wavelet filter that
eliminated lower frequencies (0.25 to 2 Hz) from the

Fulda et al. BMC Neuroscience 2011, 12:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/12/110

EOG signal before REM detection. Second, EOG electrodes where fully isolated with coating against ohmic contact on the skull’s surface, leaving only the non-isolated
electrode tip embedded fully in the eye muscle without
contact to the bone. Third, detection of REM was based
on the concept of singularities i.e. discontinuities in the
signal that are not continuous on a particular derivative.
To be considered a REM candidate, a local maximum at
the finest scale (fastest frequency) of the wavelet transform modulus maxima was a necessary (though not sufficient) condition. Therefore only high frequency noise can
trigger false detection. We would expect slow EEG components leaking into the EOG signal to also affect neighboring signal points and our threshold based on the
standard deviation of the local wavelet transform modulus maxima was chosen to protect against this possibility.
Given that the EOG electrodes are chronically
implanted together with the EEG and EMG electrodes,
any experimental recording situation in freely moving
animals is conceivable. We applied the present electrode
configurations for several weeks in all of our animals
and detected neither any behavioral irritations, such as
scratching the eye lids, nor inflamed tissue post mortem.
One possible limitation is the low sampling rate of 64
Hz in the present study. We can not exclude the existence of REMs with higher frequencies (> 29 Hz) and
therefore our results may be an underestimation of the
frequency of REMs during sleep in mice. Future studies
with higher sampling rates are needed to clarify this
issue.
In the present study, single REM and REM bursts were
associated with micro-arousals, which we defined as transient EMG increases during NREMS, but not during
REMS. The definition found in the literature for arousals
is inconsistent. Single events of arousals within a 4 s
epoch or a waking episode lasting less than 16 seconds
were defined as sleep fragmentations and separated from
clear transitions between vigilance states which were
longer than 16 seconds [80]. Other definition criteria for
clear changes to another behavioral state comprised eight
or more consecutive 4s epochs scored as one behavioral
state, which were followed by eight or more consecutive
4s epochs scored as a different behavioral state [81]. In
other studies, micro-arousals were defined as events in
NREM sleep lasting 5-15s and including a drop of at
least 50% in the EEG power in the δ band [82]. Short, single episodes in NREMS with increased power in the θ
band and EMG activation were counted as wake [82]. In
the present study, transient EMG activity (< 4s) during
sleep was taken to define micro arousals. When evaluating micro-arousals we found EMG increases both with
and without changes in the EEG. Both types of microarousals were frequently accompanied with either single
REM or REM bursts (Figure 5 gives examples for both

Page 10 of 13

events). In addition to what is defined as a state of arousal in the literature, the present data suggest differentiating micro-arousals in more detail. We would suggest
reserving the concept of “micro-arousal” for events less
than 8 seconds. Within this time frame, micro arousals
could be separated between micro-arousal with EMG
changes and micro arousal without EMG changes. Additionally, micro-arousals could be divided into events with
single REM and with REM bursts. The occurrence of
REM in the majority of micro-arousals in the present
study may also support the need to implement the eye
movements per se as a general feature in the detection
and declaration of micro-arousals. Since arousals are
deeply involved in the pathophysiology of human sleep
disorders [83], the establishment of well-defined microarousals in mice may also help to better understand the
origin of increased micro-arousals in particular sleep disorders and to characterize their sleep more fully.
Rapid eye movements, which gave name to the prominent vigilance state of REM sleep in humans, had never
really been in the focus of in-depth investigations in animals, although, general references to eye movements
during sleep and wakefulness were obtained in several
non-mammalian species and mammalian species (please
refer to the introduction). This obviously fundamental
and phylogenetically diverse component of REM sleep
seems to be predestined to serve as a tool in translational approaches between basic and clinical research.
In humans REM density is an important parameter
that has been associated with sleep satiety [37], learning
and memory [46-48] and psychiatric disorders [52].
Importantly, increased REM density has been proposed
to be an endophenotype for depression [54,55] and is
sensitive to treatment with antidepressants. Characterization of sleep in mouse models of depression has
shown REM sleep facilitation and increased sleep fragmentation that resemble endophenotypes of depressed
patients [84-88].
Analysis of REM density is expected to complement
and significantly extend sleep characterization in these
mouse models. Importantly, we found a high intra-individual stability of REM density across several days with
almost perfect trait-like stability that was substantially
higher than the stability of REM sleep proportion. REM
density might therefore be better suited to characterize
phenotypic variations in sleep patterns in mice.

Conclusions
REM density plays a prominent role in psychiatric diseases. We have developed the Eye Movement scoring in
Mice Algorithm (EMMA) to detect REM as singularities
of the EOG signal, based on wavelet methodology, and
characterized eye movements during sleep in mice. REM
density was significantly higher during REM sleep than

Fulda et al. BMC Neuroscience 2011, 12:110
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/12/110

NREM sleep in mice and across three nights showed a
high trait-like stability that outperformed the stability of
REM sleep proportion. During NREM but not REM
sleep the majority of REM bursts were associated with
micro-arousals. Automated detection and analysis of
REM density in mice is expected to contribute significantly to the characterization of sleep in mouse models
of psychiatric disorders.

APPENDIX
Eye Movement in Mice scoring Algorithm (EMMA)

Eye movements were detected separately for each epoch
(4s or 256 sampling points) of sleep. To avoid phenomena associated with the edges of the epoch, the detection algorithm was used on three overlapping windows
-1s to 3s, 0 to 4s, and 1 to +1s.
1) The EOG signal was filtered with a low frequency
filter that used discrete dyadic wavelet transform with
Mallat’s wavelet and with 8 decomposition scales.
Scales 4 to 8 were set to 0 and the resulting signal was
subjected to an inverse dyadic wavelet transform. This
procedure omitted frequencies centered at 0.25 to
2 Hz. The choice of Mallat’s wavelet and the dyadic
transform ensures that the reconstructed signal preserves locations and values at the extrema.
2) Rapid eye movement (REM) candidates were
detected as singularities candidates from the wavelet
transform modulus maxima of a continuous wavelet
transform [72]. We used the complex-valued 2nd derivative of the Gaussian wavelet, the Mexican hat wavelet, with 2 moments on an 8 octave scale with 8 scales
within each octave. REM candidates were local maxima at the finest scale of the wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) that were above a threshold
based on the standard deviation of the WTMM and
the sampling length [(standard deviation of the modulus)*square root (2*log(sample length)) ] [89].
3) Singularity candidates from the WTMM were then
compared to two thresholds: first, peak amplitudes of
the eye movement candidates had to be clearly above
the background noise (> 4*85th percentile or < 4*15th
percentile of the signal amplitude). Second, instantaneous amplitude, computed as absolute lag-2 difference, had to be above the 2*95 th quantile of the
absolute lag-2 differences of the signal, that did not
include the eye movement candidates. This latter
threshold was used to protect against regular high frequency artifacts.
4) Each REM was conceptualized as having two
phases: a significant deflection from baseline and the
subsequent return to baseline. In the case of a positive
deflection, the start of the REM was the closest local
minimum before the singularity, the peak of the REM

Page 11 of 13

the closest local maximum after the singularity, and
the end of the REM the next local minimum after that.
In case of a negative deflection local minima were
exchanged for local maxima and vice versa.
5) In the case that two or more singularities were
adjacent to each other, the number of different REM
were determined according to the first threshold
criterion
6) (> 4*85th percentile or < 4*15th percentile of the
signal): to detect a second REM subsequent to a first
one, where the peak of the first REM (which is
above the threshold) was the start of the second
REM, the peak of the second REM had to be above
the threshold too.
