SORGOdb: Superoxide Reductase Gene Ontology
curated DataBase

Abstract
Background: Superoxide reductases (SOR) catalyse the reduction of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide and
are involved in the oxidative stress defences of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms. Genes encoding
SOR were discovered recently and suffer from annotation problems. These genes, named sor, are short and the
transfer of annotations from previously characterized neelaredoxin, desulfoferrodoxin, superoxide reductase and
rubredoxin oxidase has been heterogeneous. Consequently, many sor remain anonymous or mis-annotated.
Description: SORGOdb is an exhaustive database of SOR that proposes a new classification based on domain
architecture. SORGOdb supplies a simple user-friendly web-based database for retrieving and exploring relevant
information about the proposed SOR families. The database can be queried using an organism name, a locus tag
or phylogenetic criteria, and also offers sequence similarity searches using BlastP. Genes encoding SOR have been
re-annotated in all available genome sequences (prokaryotic and eukaryotic (complete and in draft) genomes,
updated in May 2010).
Conclusions: SORGOdb contains 325 non-redundant and curated SOR, from 274 organisms. It proposes a new
classification of SOR into seven different classes and allows biologists to explore and analyze sor in order to
establish correlations between the class of SOR and organism phenotypes. SORGOdb is freely available at
http://sorgo.genouest.org/index.php.

Background
Two and a half billion years ago, the intense photosynthetic activity of cyanobacteria caused the largest environmental change in Earth’s history: the oxygenation of
the atmosphere and the oceans, which were hitherto largely anoxic [1,2]. This profound transformation of the
biosphere exerted an evolutionary selection pressure on
organisms and led to the development of new pathways,
including the highly exergonic respiratory chain based
on O 2 as the terminal electron acceptor. Currently,
most living organisms, except anaerobic microbes,
require oxygen. O 2 is used as a substrate by many
enzymes involved metabolizing amines, purines and
amino acids. Oxygen is a relatively inert molecule due
to its spin triplet ground state. However, it can be activated by photons or by one electron oxidation or reduction processes to generate reactive oxygen species

(called reactive oxygen species or ROS), particularly
hydroxyl radicals (•OH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and
superoxide anion radicals (O2-).
The superoxide anion is generated fortuitously by flavoenzymes such as NADH dehydrogenase II, succinate
dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, and sulphite reductase [3,4]. The superoxide anion is one of the deleterious
reactive oxygen species: it can damage DNA, proteins
and lipids indirectly by releasing iron from damaged
dehydratase clusters [4,5]. In anaerobes, most of the
essential “central metabolic” redox enzymes (for example aconitase, fumarase, dihydroxyacid dehydratase, and
pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) contain iron sulphur [Fe-S] clusters that are rapidly inactivated when
exposed to oxygen [5-8].
To survive and protect themselves from the toxicity of
superoxide anion, many species, and especially anaerobes, have developed defence mechanisms [5].
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was first isolated by
Mann and Keilis (1938) and its catalytic function, which
consists to dismutate O 2 - into molecular oxygen and

hydrogen peroxide, was discovered in 1969 by McCord
and Fridovich [9]. Mammals have two forms of SOD
isozymes: the manganese SOD (Mn-SOD), present in
the mitochondria, and the copper/zinc SOD (Cu/Zn-SO),
present in the cytoplasm [10,11]. In plants, SOD have
been classified into three distinct types on the basis of
their metal cofactor: Cu/Zn-SOD (in the cytosol and
chloroplasts), Mn-SOD (in mitochondria), and Fe-SOD
(often in chloroplasts) [12-14]. There are three known
SOD in E. coli: MnSOD, FeSOD and CuZnSOD. The two
first are located in the cytoplasm and the last in the periplasmic space [15]. A distinct additional fourth class of
SOD containing nickel (NiSOD) was recently discovered
in Streptomyces [16,17] and cyanobacteria [18]. SODdriven dismutation was the only biological mechanism
identified for scavenging superoxide anion radicals until
the early 1990’s. McCord et al. [19] established a correlation between oxygen tolerance and SOD production and
suggested that SOD was the single most important
enzyme for enabling organisms to survive in the presence
of molecular oxygen. They proposed that the hypersensitivity of obligate anaerobes to oxygen was a consequence
of SOD deficiency. However, most anaerobic organisms,
which indeed lack SOD, show various degrees of tolerance to oxygen when they are occasionally exposed to
this molecule in their environments.
Two novel iron-sulphur-containing proteins that
detoxify superoxide molecules were then discovered in
sulphate-reducing and hyperthermophilic anaerobes:
desulfoferrodoxin (Dfx) in Desulfovibrio desulfuricans,
Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenbourgh [20] and Desulfoarculus baarsii [21], neelaredoxin (Nlr) in Desulfovibrio
gigas [22] and superoxide reductase (SOR) in Pyrococcus
furiosus [23]. This revealed the existence of alternative
mechanisms for ROS detoxification in anaerobes. The
function of these proteins was first studied in 1996 by
Dfx complementation of superoxide detoxication activity
in E. coli SOD mutants [24]. Later, Nlr from Treponema
pallidum [25] and D. gigas [26] were also shown to
complement such SOD mutants. Liochev and Fridovich
[27] suggested that Dfx catalyzes the reduction of superoxide rather than its dismutation, and that it uses cellular reductants such as NAD(P)H. Subsequently, the Dfx
enzyme was confirmed as an oxidoreductase [23-25,27].
Finally, the superoxide reductase activity of those proteins were established by two groups [21,23].
Dfx and Nlr proteins have different numbers of iron
sites: both contain a similar C-terminal single ironcontaining site (centre II) but also has Dfx a second Nterminal site (centre I) [22,28]. Centre II is the active
site of SOR and consists of a pentacoordinated Fe2+ centre with four equatorial histidines and one axial cysteine
in a square pyramidal geometry (Fe(His)4(Cys) [29-31]).
The binding site for the substrate O2- is the free sixth

Page 2 of 12

axial site of the reduced enzyme centre [30]. The additional N-terminal domain of the 2Fe-SOR contains a
rubredoxin-like centre, with Fe 3+ ligated by four
cysteines in a distorted tetrahedral geometry (centre I,
Fe(Cys)4 , [32]). A first classification of these enzymes
was proposed according to the number of metal centres:
neelaredoxin or 1Fe-SOR and desulfoferrodoxin or 2FeSOR [33,34]. An additional class was proposed after the
isolation of a Treponema pallidum SOR that contains
an extended non-iron N-terminal domain of unknown
function [25,35]. In all these three classes, only the
reduced form of the iron-containing active centre II is
able to react with the superoxide anion O2•-.
SOD are found in nearly every living organism except
in some strictly anaerobic species [36,37]. Tally et al
suggested that the diversity in the oxygen tolerance of
anaerobes is generally related to their level of SOD [38].
SOR were first thought to be restricted to anaerobic
prokaryotes but were subsequently discovered in some
micro-aerophilic and micro-aerotolerant Bacteria and
Archaea [39,40]. More recently, a SOR encoding gene
was also discovered in an eukaryote, Giardia intestinalis,
a microaerophilic protozoan (cited by [41]). Although
SOD and SOR both detoxify superoxide, there is a fundamental difference in their properties: SOD generate
one-half mole of oxygen and one-half mole of hydrogen
peroxide per superoxide molecule whereas SOR produce
only one mole of hydrogen peroxide. The physiological
conditions, that determine SOR or SOD preference in
organisms, have not be completely determined, although
the presence of SOR rather than SOD may be associated
with the amount of redox proteins produced by organisms [25].
Most genomes, even those of anaerobic species, contain both SOD and SOR although some species have
only one of the two enzymes. The increasing number of
sequenced genomes makes allows comparative genomic
analyses, to elucidate the evolutionary or functional processes of SOR. Unfortunately, there are several problems
with the annotation of superoxide reductase genes,
partly a consequence of heterogeneous transfer of annotations from previously characterized neelaredoxin,
desulfoferrodoxin, superoxide reductase or rubredoxin
oxidase. Moreover, due to the absence of updating or
correction of databases, many sor genes remained anonymous because of the transfer of annotations from SOR
genes initially annotated as “hypothetical”, “function
unknown” or “putative activity”. Also, SOR are small
proteins, ca. 200 amino acids on average, and mis-annotations are frequent for proteins of this length [42].
For all these reasons, we developed SORGOdb, the
first resource specifically dedicated to superoxide reductase genes in entirely sequenced and in-draft genomes.
SOR sequences were curated manually, analysed and

stored using a new ontology in a publically available
resource (http://sorgo.genouest.org/). SOR genes were
detected in the three kingdoms of life, and only on
chromosomal replicons. Although no N-terminal signal
sequences were previously described for bacteria SOR
[43], we predicted seven SOR to be potentially TATsecreted (Twin-arginine translocation) in some bacteria,
including for example in Desulfovibrio salexigens
DSM 2638, Desulfuromonas acetoxidans DSM 684 and
Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4. Our analysis confirms the
observations by Pinto et al in 2010 that (1) the repartition of SOR classes does not correlate with organism
phylogeny and that (2) sor genes occur in very diverse
genetic environments. Indeed, although some sor are
clustered with genes encoding electron donors (such as
rubredoxin in D. vulgaris) or inter-related oxidative
responsive genes, most are close to functionally unrelated genes. This is consistent with sor genes being
acquired, or lost, through lateral gene transfer [41].

Construction and content
Collection of SOR

For collection of SOR, we have extensively searched the
Pubmed database and identified all relevant literature
concerning any protein with “superoxide reductase”
activity; this search resulted in a small dataset (13 SOR
published in 12 organisms, see Table 1). We therefore
enriched the database using manually curated sequences
described as desulfoferrodoxin (160 proteins), superoxide reductase (50 proteins) or neelaredoxin (9 proteins)
in EntrezGene and/or GenBank entries. As the “centre
II” is the active site for the SOR activity, we also
included all proteins with a domain of this type
as described in InterPro (IPR002742, IPR004793,
IPR004462, IPR012002), Pfam (PF01880, PF06397),

Supfam (SSF49367), TIGRfam (TIGR00332, TIGR00320,
TIGR00319), NCBI conserved domains (cd03172, cd03171,
cd00524, cl00018, cl00014, cd00974) and PRODOM
(PD006618, PD330262, PDA2O7Z7, PDA36750, PD985590,
PDA36751, PDA63215, PDA7Y161, PDA7Y162, PD511041,
PD171746, PD985589, PDA7Y163). All sequences
collected were cleaned up to remove redundancy and
unrelated proteins. This non-redundant and curated
dataset was used to investigate the 1237 complete and
1345 in-draft genomes available in the NCBI database
(May, 2010) through a series of successive BlastP [44]
and tBlanstN [45] searches. Orthology (KO K05919 and
COG2033) and synteny (IMG neighbourhood interface)
were also exploited. To be as comprehensive as possible
in the data collection, we performed multiple alignments
using both ClustalW [46,47] and Muscle [48] algorithms.
These alignments showed highly conserved residues in
the sequences of active centre I (CX2CX15CC) and centre
II (HX5H-CX2H ). These conversations were translated
into “regular expressions” that were used to perform for
final screening of databases. All these search processes
allowed us to retrieve 106 supplementary proteins including 82 proteins described as “hypothetical protein”.
At the end of this integrative research, we had a collection of 325 non-redundant and curated predicted
SOR in 274 organisms, covering all the three kingdoms:
Bacteria (270 genes), Archaea (52 genes) and Eukaryota
(3 genes).
New Classification and ontology

Consistent with the collecting procedure, all the 325
proteins present in SORGOdb contain at least the SOR
active centre II domain. However, we found that this
SOR module is, in some cases, associated with other
domains, in a modular way. The discovery of new

combinations of domains makes the previous classification into three classes inappropriate. Indeed, we suggest
that the existence of multi-domain SOR indicates new
function due to cooperation between domains. As
previously proposed, the concept of orthology is more
relevant at the level of domains than at the level of
whole proteins except for proteins with identical domain
architectures [49,50]. We therefore propose a new
unambiguous SOR classification based on their domain
architectures (sequential order of domains from the
N- to the C-terminus [49]). Considering both domain
compositions and arrangements, this classification contains seven functionally relevant classes which were precisely described on the website (http://sorgo.genouest.
org/classif.php, additional file 1 and Table 2). Briefly, the
144 proteins that contain only the active site II (SOR)
without other additional domains or cofactors have been
classified as Class II-related SOR and correspond to the
previous SOR class II [20,22,23,51]. Class III-related
SOR correspond to the previous SOR class III proteins
which have the active site II and enclose an additional
N-terminal region of unknown function [25,35,52].
Class-IV related SOR correspond to very recently new
class of methanoferrodoxin [53] which have the active
site II and an additional iron sulfur domain. The TATSOR have the active site II and include an extra twinarginine N-terminal signal peptide. The 152 proteins
composed of a desulforedoxin (Dx) domain preceding
the SOR unit (formerly Class I [20,21,54-56]) were clustered in a class named Dx-SOR. The 19 proteins that
combined a N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain (HTH)
before the Dx-SOR module were gathered in a separate
class called HTH-Dx-SOR. Finally, 10 SOR proteins that
correspond to exceptional domains fusion or that
encompass a mutated ncDx domain (frameshift or
mutation in the conserved CXXCX15CC metal binding
residues) were classified in a disparate class labelled
“Atypical-SOR”. This class is quite heterogeneous
but includes all proteins whose composite or mutated
structure might suggest a function different of the three
previous classes or, in the case of mutants, a nonfunctionality due to the loss of key binding sites.
SORGOdb website construction

SORGOdb is a relational database built on MySQL and
accessed from a PHP web-based interface (phpMyAdmin, Ratschiller, 2000) with additional JavaScript and
JQuery functionalities (Jquery JavaScript library released

in 2006 by John Resig). The database runs with the
Apache web server version 2.2.3, hosted at the BioGenouest bioinformatics platform (http://www.genouest.org/).
The sequences, features and annotations were introduced
into the database using Python-based scripts.
SORGOdb Web interface

SORGOdb includes both documentation and search
options. The web interface is composed of two panels
(Figure 1).
The navigation menu (on the left) provides access to
SORGOdb functions through three modules. (i) Browse:
browse SOR proteins according to phylogeny criteria
(kingdom, phylum, class and order) or locus tag name. (ii)
Search: by organism name query and by sequence similarity through a BlastP form that allows users to enter primary sequences to find similar entries into the SORGOdb
database and (iii) Pre-computed Results that include data
statistics (organized in three tabs), classes (details about
SORGOdb classes and ontology) and useful links (reference, tools and websites). Statistical results about SORGOdb classification were presented in the Classification
tab (http://sorgo.genouest.org/classif-Stat.php).
The results panel (on the right) provides intermediary
selection options and displays SOR record information
in a tabular way including organism name, locus tag
name, SORGOdb classification and domains architecture. When available, SORGOdb includes a CGView
[57] representation of the distribution of SOR and all
SOD genes (MnSOD, FeSOD CuZnSOD and NiSOD)
[36] in the replicons and a gView [58] map to illustrate
the genetic organisation and encoded functions surrounding each SOR (window of 11 genes max.).
SORGOdb synopsis and download

Using checkboxes, amino acid sequences and bibliography links can be obtained and synopsis cart can be
downloading in .pdf format (Figure 2). Synopsis were
created and pre-computed for each SOR (using Python
scripts and PHP library FPDF v1.6, http://www.fpdf.
org/) in order to highlight key findings in an unified
manner with all protein information (locus tag, ID,
organism name, replicon and genome status), previous
(PRODOM, PFAM and CDD) and new (SORGOdb)
classification, position in the SORGOdb distance tree,
SOR cellular localization prediction using CoBaltDB
[59], genomic organisation for SOR and SOD loci, synteny viewer, PMID and PDB references. Images were
generated using Python scripts from CGview (genomic
map), MyDomains (SORGOdb domains representation), CDD, PFAM and PRODOM (database domains
illustration), gView (synteny organisation) and from
FigTree (for distance tree; http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).

Utility and Dicussion
As an example, SORGOdb allows the study of the distribution of genes encoding superoxide reductase across a
whole phylum. As a case study, we decided to consider
the Archaea as these organisms are considered to be
originate from a hyperthermophilic anaerobic common
ancestor and were probably already prevalent when the
Earth had its primative anoxic H2 and CO2 atmosphere.
Using the “Browse by phylogeny” option of
SORGOdb, we collected the names of all Archaea that
possess at least one SOR gene in their complete or partial genomes. Then, we generated a 16S-based phylogenetic tree for these organisms, using ClustalW [46] and
sequences recovered from the SILVA comprehensible
ribosomal RNA databases [60] (http://www.arb-silva.de/),
clustered by Maximum Likelihood and Neighborhood
joining algorithms (Neighborhood joining tree is not
shown). This tree was annotated with the class of SOR
and the presence of SOD on the genome (Maximum
Likelihood Tree; Figure 3).

superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes regarding the 16S rRNA

the sequences were retrieved from SILVA [60] when available or

Nanoarchaeota [61] and Korarchaeota [62] are obligately anaerobic sulphur-dependent organisms placed
close to the root of the archaeal SSU rRNA tree.
Nanoarchaeota is currently known from a single organism Candidatus Nanoarchaeum equitans, a hyperthermophilic symbiont that grows on the surface of
Ignicoccus hospitalis [62,63]. There are currently no
representatives of Korarchaeota in pure culture but the
genome of K. cryptophilum, a very thin filamentous
thermophilic heterotroph, has been determined from a
sample of Yellowstone National Park Obsidian Pool.
Both C. N. equitans and K. cryptophilum are found
together in the 16S tree, in the vicinity of the Crenarchaeota group, and contain genes encoding superoxide
reductase with a SOR (centre II) functional domain and
do not encode superoxide dismutase genes.
According to 16S rRNA gene sequences, the Crenarchaeota group can be subdivided into three orders, the Thermoproteales, the Sulfolobales and the Desulfurococcales
[64]. All Sulfolobales and Thermoproteoles genomes studied encode a single SOD, with the single exception of the
unique member of the Thermofilaceae familly, Thermofilum pendens, an anaerobic commensal that encodes a
SOR. By contrast, all Desulfurococcales genomes available
encode a SOR but not a SOD, except Aeropyrum pernix
that has the particularity to be strictly aerobic [65] and
that encodes an extremely thermostable Mn/Fe superoxide
dismutase [66] and Ignisphaera aggregans, a novel deepbranching member of the Desulfurococcaceae lineage of
strict anaerobes (as even trace quantities of oxygen inhibited its growth, [67] ) the genome of which carries neither
SOR or SOD genes. Other Desulfurococcales studied
(Figure 4) have all a gene encoding a centre II monodomain SOR-type enzyme. Interestingly, two recent
genomes have been made available since the last update of
SORGOdb (May 2010) and both contain annotation for
SOR-like genes: Tagg_0590, described as a Desulfoferrodoxin ferrous iron-binding protein of Thermosphaera
aggregans DSM 11486 and Shell_0770 for Staphylothermus hellenicus DSM 12710, annotated as a twin-arginine
secreted superoxide reductase, by homology with Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 Gmet_2613 SOR. Using the
SORGOdb “search by BlastP”, we could confirm that both
ORFs are true SOR (ten best e-value from e-59 to e-34)
and belong to the SOR-type class. This analysis contradicts
the annotation of Shell_0770 in NCBI as TAT-SOR; the
absence of a significant TAT targeting signal in Shell_0770
was tested and confirmed by TatFind [68] and TatP [69]
predictions. The SORGOdb “search by BlastP” tool therefore allows the accuracy of public SOR annotations to
be checked and allows suggestions of their possible
SORGOdb classification.
Thermococcus and Pyrococcus are obligate anaerobes
that live in environments where there is no oxygen and

both produce a SOR-type superoxide reductase that is
catalytically active at temperatures below the optimum
growth temperature but representing conditions likely
corresponding to zones of oxygen exposure [23].
Archaeoglobus is a true archaeal sulphate reducer,
reducing SO4 2- to H 2 S in hot marine sediments. Two
complete Archaeoglobus genomes are available, A. fulgidus and A.profundus, The A. fulgidus genome contains
one SOR and one Dx-SOR, and the two enzymes have
similar kinetics of the superoxide reduction. This raises
the question of functional redundancy as Dx-SOR is
absent from A. profundus and from the related Ferroglobus placidus, an iron-oxidising nitrate-reducing species
that lives in anoxic (oxygen free) and hot (85°C) environments [70]. The A. profundus genome (1.6 Mb) is significantly smaller than those of A. fulgidus (2.2 Mb) and
F. placidus (2.2 Mb). Using the SORGOdb “by organism
name search” option, it is easy to compare the genomic
locations (GC view map) and the genes contexts (gview
synteny map) of the SOR of these three species. This
visualization reveals that these genes have different
genetic locations and, although the neighbouring genes

encode related functions, the genetic organization and
order, are not conserved. Again using the “Browse by
phylogeny” option of SORGOdb, we get quickly all
archaeal SOR amino acid sequences (using check all
then get all amino acid sequence) can be selected and
used to cluster by Maximum Likelihood using ClustalW
to produce a protein distance-tree (Figure 3). This tree
shows the position of each four proteins considered
(AF0833, AF0344, Arcpr_0633 and Ferp_1979) and indicate that the two A. fulgidus SOR (Figure 5, point 3 and
5) are very distant from those of A. profundum and
F. placibus, which by contrast are closely related
(Figure 5, point 4). This proximity cannot be linked to
the origin of the organisms as A. fulgidus and F. placibus
originate from a shallow marine hydrothermal system at
Volcano, Italy [70,71] whereas A. profundus was isolated
from a deep sea hot vent area (depth: 2000 m) at Guaymas, Mexico [72]. However, based on 16S rRNA gene
sequences, indicate that A. profundus and F. placidus are
the most closely related with 96.5% sequence identity.
The protein tree also revealed two interesting phenomena: Msp_0788 that is a non-canonical Dx-SOR (as
the Dx active site is incomplete) that is branched as an
out-group close to the entire archaeal Dx-SOR group
(Figure 5, point 1). This is consistent with the presumed
loss-of-function of Dx of Msp_0788 being relatively
recent. Also, the Kcr_1172 locus forms a major divergent branch (Figure 5, point 2).). Using the “Browse by
locus tag” option, Kcr_1172 is revealed to be a fusion
protein with an additional C-terminal module sharing
significantly similarities with archaeal proteins annotated

SOR proteins. The tree shows the repartition of SOR (blue area)
and Dx-SOR (pink area) types.

as “hypothetical” or “redoxin domain-containing”. The
best-conserved component is a CXXC motif (i.e.
cysteines separated by two amino acids), found in many
redox proteins for the formation, the isomerization and
the reduction of disulphide bonds and for other redox
functions [73]. Kcr_1172 has a new SOR-derived architecture with the presence of two CXXC active sites
(in the C-terminal fusion and N-terminal “Dx parts”),
separated by the functional SOR centre II. This arrangement is unique and interesting as a combination of two
sites CXXC motifs has been shown to be involved in
protein disulphide-shuffling in hyperthermophiles [74].
Although the true function of this protein needs to be
determined experimentally, we show with this example
that SORGOdb can also be used to reveal possible new
SOR features.
The distribution of genes encoding SOR and SOD is
extremely heterogeneous, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in the group of methanogenic archaea as shown
in Figure 3. Thus, for the genus Methanosarcina,
Methanosarcina acetivorans (5.8 Mb) possesses one
SOR and two SOD whereas Methanosarcina mazei (4.1
Mb) encodes only one SOR. M. barkeri, that shares 80%
identity with both M. acetivorans and M. mazei [75],
encodes two SOD [36] but no SOR. The presence of
these various combinations of oxygen-dependent SOD
and SOR genes confirm that methanogens, that are sensitive to oxygen and are rapidly killed by even very low
concentrations of O 2 , protect themselves from ROS;
however, the factors that influence the presence and
evolution of these genes remain unidentified. No clear
relationship can be established between oxygen tolerance and the existence of superoxide reductase functions in the genome of microbes. A difficulty is the
different connotations of the term ‘anoxia’ as used by
geologists, zoologists and microbiologists. Geologists call
an environment ‘aerobic’ if the oxygen content exceeds
18%. Zoologists talk about ‘hypoxic’ conditions when
referring to oxygen levels that limit respiration (usually
less than ca. 50% O2). For microbiologists, the so-called
‘Pasteur point’ of switch from aerobic respiration to fermentation is generally less than about 1 per cent of the
atmospheric levels of oxygen; microbes, though, are
affected by very low levels of oxygen, often much less
than 0.1 per cent whereas some “anaerobes” living today
are able to tolerate oxygen even at higher levels.

Conclusions
The SORGOdb server is the first web server that centralizes and provides an interface for information concerning superoxide reductase proteins. SORGOdb provides
integrated features: (1) Multiple options for data browsing and searching (2) Complete descriptions of SOR and
a new domain-based classification (3) Synthetic and

Page 9 of 12

downloadable synopsis for each locus tag (4) A SORhomology analysis tool using BlastP similarity searches
with the SORGOdb-positive dataset (5) An integrated
access to external hyperlinks to various public data
sources (notably NCBI GenBank, and Pubmed). SORGOdb is a unique mining tool that can assist researchers with diverse interests to retrieve, visualize and
analyse superoxide reductase genes and proteins.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Distance trees and alignments for each SORGOdb
classes and subclasses. The Dx-SOR (Figure A) and Class II-related SOR
(Figure B) trees, based on genetic distances, were constructed using
ClustalW and UPGMA algorithm. Clade divisions are illustrated by
alternatively pink and yellow highlighted area and sequences selected to
represent each clade in the alignment are written in red. Multiple
sequence alignment were performed using ClustalW and visualized with
Jalview [113,114]. Conserved amino acids are highlighted with different
shades of blue considering the degree of identity (most conserved
amino acids are coloured in dark blue). These alignments correspond to
selected Dx-SOR (Figure C), selected Class II-related SOR (Figure D), all
Class III-related SOR (Figure E), all Class IV-related SOR (Figure F), all TATSOR (Figure G) and all HTH-Dx-SOR (Figure H). Residues that bind the
catalytic center are indicated by a blue asterisk. The amino acid
sequences corresponding to SOR which have been biochemically
characterized are indicated by a blue arrow. The different SOR domains
for each class of SOR, are represented just below multiple sequence
alignment.
