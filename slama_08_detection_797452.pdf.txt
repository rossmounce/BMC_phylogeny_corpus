Abstract
Background: Identifying the active site of an enzyme is a crucial step in functional studies. While
protein sequences and structures can be experimentally characterized, determining which residues
build up an active site is not a straightforward process. In the present study a new method for the
detection of protein active sites is introduced. This method uses local network descriptors derived
from protein three-dimensional structures to determine whether a residue is part of an active site.
It thus does not involve any sequence alignment or structure similarity to other proteins. A scoring
function is elaborated over a set of more than 220 proteins having different structures and
functions, in order to detect protein catalytic sites with a high precision, i.e. with a minimal rate of
false positives.
Results: The scoring function was based on the counts of first-neighbours on side-chain contacts,
third-neighbours and residue type. Precision of the detection using this function was 28.1%, which
represents a more than three-fold increase compared to combining closeness centrality with
residue surface accessibility, a function which was proposed in recent years. The performance of
the scoring function was also analysed into detail over a smaller set of eight proteins. For the
detection of 'functional' residues, which were involved either directly in catalytic activity or in the
binding of substrates, precision reached a value of 72.7% on this second set. These results suggested
that our scoring function was effective at detecting not only catalytic residues, but also any residue
that is part of the functional site of a protein.
Conclusion: As having been validated on the majority of known structural families, this method
should prove useful for the detection of active sites in any protein with unknown function, and for
direct application to the design of site-directed mutagenesis experiments.

Background
Determining the location of the active site of an enzyme is
a crucial step in fundamental research as well as in drug
design. In genetical studies, identifying mutations at or
near an active site can help explain biological malfunctions. Knowledge of an active site, its geometry and phys-

ico-chemical properties, is essential for the efficient design
of inhibitors of malignant proteins [1]. With extensive
data now at hand on sequence and structure of genes and
proteins, and broad functional knowledge, new methods
aimed at determining the sequence and space location of
unknown active sites from related or distant data have

been elaborated over recent years. On specific protein
families, such as DNA-binding proteins, methods analysing sequence only [2] or structural patterns [3,4] have
proved efficient at detecting functional sites of such proteins. For more general applications, the distributions of
different structural properties only [5] or in combination
with physico-chemical properties of residues [6] have
been studied. These properties were e.g. integrated into a
neural network algorithm, in order to predict active site
residues over various proteins with known structures [7].
A similar approach was used by Petrova, so as to predict
active sites using Support Vector Machine on different
structural and conservation properties of protein residues
[8]. Another method, the 'Evolutionary Trace', relies on
the hypothesis that important residues show slower mutation rates than non-functional residues in proteins and
that, in three-dimensional structures, such residues are
more likely to be clustered with each others than to be isolated in space [9-11]. Graph-derived approaches that
detect the structural patterns of side-chain atoms that are
recurrent over evolutionarily-related proteins were also
proven to efficiently detect protein functional sites [12].
An optimal division of protein families into subfamilies,
which followed the principles of phylogeny, enabled the
identification of residues that were important for protein
function [13]. Lastly, representation of protein structures
as networks of interacting residues also enabled efficient
detection of protein functional sites from three-dimensional structures [14-16].
This last representation, which facilitates mathematical
manipulations of protein structures, is used in the current
work. In such networks, each protein residue is a node,
and two residues are connected by an edge if they have
atoms within a given distance from each other. In the original definition, only contacts between amino-acids Cα
atoms were considered [17,18]. This description proved
relevant for the detection of secondary structure motifs
[19] and for comparing protein structures [20,21].
Closeness centrality of a node (a residue) within a network (a protein structure), as used in recent studies for the
detection of protein catalytic sites [14,15], takes into
account pathways that connect residues over the whole
protein. Our belief was that interactions that take place at
a local scale between residues would have a greater influence on the chemical and physical properties of residues
than global properties. Non-bonding interactions have
indeed very little chemical effect in the long range, as
being due to electrostatic effects [22]. In addition, the
modification of the electron richness of the side-chain
atoms of a residue is in most cases not modified by residues that are distant from it by more than two non-covalent contacts.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/517

The main features we thus focused on to describe protein
residues were the number of 'local' neighbours of a node,
i.e. nodes that are distant from this node by a path-length
of one or two edges within the residue network. It has
been shown that 2-connectivity, the count of the number
of nodes distant by at most two edges from a given node,
produced a similar efficacy at detecting protein active sites
as closeness centrality [15]. Here we describe a combination of the counts of local neighbours, based both on allatom contacts and side-chain atoms only contacts, with
the distribution of residue types among protein catalytic
sites. This score was tested for classifying residues as catalytic and non-catalytic using a set of over 220 proteins.
Detection of catalytic sites was evaluated with respect to
precision, or predictive value of positives, which reached
a value superior to 28%. This performance is more than
triple that of closeness centrality [14]. Our score also had
highly improved performance using a measure that combined precision and coverage. Lastly, it was tested in detail
over a set of eight proteins with different biological functions. Results suggested that our score was not only efficient at detecting only 'catalytic' residues, as defined in the
Catalytic Site Atlas [23] but, more broadly, at detecting
any residue involved in protein function.

Results
Detection of functional sites: general approach
Residue interaction networks were generated after the
three-dimensional structures of a large test set of 226 proteins. Each of these proteins belonged to a distinct SCOP
superfamily (see Methods for details) and had identified
catalytic site residues, as being reported in the Catalytic
Site Atlas [23]. This Atlas considers as catalytic the residues
of a protein that are involved in catalytic reactions, under
the following rules: being one of the reactant of the catalytic reaction, exerting an effect on a residue, a water molecule, a ligand or a cofactor which assists catalysis,
stabilisation of a proposed transition state [6].

For each residue interaction network, different network
parameters were analysed. Individual scores were next
transformed into MDev values (see Additional file 1).
MDev values do not involve standard deviations, and
quantify deviations from average towards maximum for a
given parameter (see Methods for definition).
As a benchmark to our method, prediction of protein catalytic sites was performed after the criteria defined by
Amitai and Pietrokovski [14]. These criteria combine Zscore values on closeness centrality [24] and ranges for
residue surface accessibility (RSA) values [25]. Using our
set of 226 proteins, these criteria yielded a precision (see
Methods for definition) of 8.22% for the detection of catalytic sites (Table 1).

bResidues were considered as catalytic if their MDev value for the
scoring function defined in Equation 1 was superior to the indicated
threshold value. Corresponding 'specificity' (equal to (p-, r-)/r-) values
were 97.80% at MDev1, 99.68% at MDev2, and 95.57% when using
closeness combined to RSA.

0.375 and MDev2 = 0.93 (Figure 1). The corresponding
values for precision and coverage are displayed in Table 1.
When comparing these values with those obtained using
closeness centrality and RSA, our scoring function produced a two-fold increase in precision when using MDev1
and more than three-fold increase in the MDev2, with calculations performed on the same data set (Table 1). Moreover, the overall performance was improved with respect
to that same method, both when using F1 at threshold
MDev1 and F2 at threshold MDev2 (Table 1).
Distributions of per-protein performance values were
homogeneous at threshold MDev1, while precision values
were split between low and high values at MDev2 (Figure

when considering as catalytic the residues with an MDev
value superior to MDev1, with 75 of the 226 proteins having a coverage value above 40%. When using threshold

function
Our scoring function combined three characteristics of a
given residue: the number of residues in contact with it
through side-chain atoms (Dg1SC), the number of residues located at a path-length of three (Dg3) and the type
of the residue (Equation 1). It was used to detect catalytic
residues over a set of 226 proteins belonging to different
structural families. The score obtained for each residue
was then transformed into a normalised MDev value.
Moreover, the threshold value of MDev was optimized in
order to produce a maximal value for a measure of performance that combined the precision and coverage values of the detection. Indeed, in order to have an efficient
tool for the prediction of residues interesting for sitedirected mutagenesis, it is important both to predict few
non-catalytic residues (high precision) and to have a high
likelihood that a catalytic site is effectively predicted as
such (high coverage). Still, precision tends to increase
with increasing values of thresholds, while coverage displays an opposite trend. We thus optimised our detection
of catalytic sites for a maximal value of a measure of performance which combined precision and coverage, the Fmeasure [26]:

Fb =

(1+ b 2 )×(precision ×coverage)
.
b 2 ×coverage + precision

This measure of effectiveness was maximised for the
extended set of 226 proteins in two conditions: at β = 1,
i.e. when precision and coverage were given a similar
importance, and at β = 2, with increased importance on
precision. The maximum values for F1 and F2 when using
our scoring function were respectively 20.82% and
20.56%, with corresponding threshold values of MDev1 =

Validation set: detailed performance and re-consideration
of 'catalytic' residues
In order to evaluate the quality of our detection method at
a structural and functional level, eight proteins belonging
to different functional families were analysed into more
detail. These proteins along with their catalytic sites and
the residues predicted as catalytic by our scoring function
are presented in Table 2.

For this smaller set we considered 'catalytic' residues as
well as 'functional' ones based on extensive analysis of
existing literature on each of these proteins. 'Functional'
residues, as opposed to the more restrictive definition of
'catalytic' residues of the CSA, included all residues which
had a proven role either in the binding of substrate(s) or
cofactor(s), as well as in the catalytic activity of the protein, even though not directly involved in the catalytic
reaction.
Detection of 'catalytic' residues was run on the two threshold values which yielded maximal values for F1 and F2,
MDev1 and MDev2 respectively, with results summarized

known class A β-lactamases [30].
In pancreatic phospholipase, an enzyme involved in the
metabolism of phospholipids, catalytic Asp99 was
detected, but only at MDev1. Active-site His48, calciumbinding Asp49 and substrate-binding Arg6 [31,32] were
also detected.
Alkylguanine transferase is a key enzyme in DNA repair
which catalyses the dealkylation of O6 from guanine
nucleotides. Prediction on this enzyme yielded numerous
positive residues, among which catalytic Cys145 was not
present. Still, the two residues proposed as activating this
residue by deprotonation, His146 and Glu172 [33], were
predicted as catalytic. All but two of the remaining residues predicted as catalytic had either a structural role in
the arrangement of the active site (Tyr158) or a functional
role (Arg147, Lys165) [34,35].

dues defined a single pocket in the crystal structure, which
is located at the surface of the protein, and facing the second monomer present in the structure (Figure 3). These
residues could thus play a role in interactions of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme with other proteins.
Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the aromatic-ring
hydroxylation of amino-acid phenylalanine to produce
tyrosine. Three of the ligands of the active-site iron of this
enzyme were detected (Table 2), while the last detected
residue (Asp139) is hydrogen-bonded to an iron-binding
water molecule [37] (Figure 4). It is interesting to note
that, in spite of the length of the protein sequence (275
residues in crystallised structure), all residues detected
play a functional role. A distribution of the MDev values

Prolyl-isomerase 1 catalyses the cis-trans isomerisation of
proline residues, and recent studies have linked this protein to cancer and Alzheimer's disease [38]. His59 and
His157 (Table 2) are catalytic residues that are located at
the bottom of the pocket for substrate interaction (Figure
4), while Glu145 is located in the region that links the isomerase domain to the WW domain of the protein [39,40].

iron uptake, one residue detected at MDev2 is an iron ligand (Glu57), and the second one (Arg101) interacts with

terminal nitrogens, Figure 4). Among the four additional
residues predicted at MDev1 (Figure 5), one is an iron ligand (His9) and one (Glu264) hydrogen binds both
Arg101 and a water molecule close to the active-site iron.
None of the residue predicted by our method in protease
bovine β-trypsin is involved in catalytic function (CSA
definition, Table 2). Still, as observed in more recent
inhibitor-bound structure [41], four of the six residues
predicted as catalytic are directly hydrogen-bonded to
inhibitor molecule (Ser190), or to water molecules that
are present at the active site. Moreover, while Asp194,
which was detected at MDev2, is not involved in docking,
its two sequence neighbours, Gly193 and Ser195, directly
interact with bound inhibitor and are labelled as catalytic
residues in the PDB structure.
Overall, for six out of the eight proteins, catalytic residues
were detected using our scoring function, though with
many positive residues that were not catalytic according to
CSA definition (Table 2). Still, for all but one of the proteins, all residues predicted at MDev2 corresponded to
'functional' residues. We labelled as such the residues
directly involved in catalytic reactions or in substrate
binding, as well as those located near an active site that
had a proven influence on catalytic rate, as deduced from
experimental results. When using either MDev1 or MDev2
threshold value, the precisions obtained were higher than
those obtained on the extended set (Table 1 and Table 3).
Coverage values of catalytic residues were respectively of
19.2% and 46.2% at MDev1 and MDev2, to be compared
to 9.9% and 32.1% respectively on the extended set (Table
1). As for 'functional' residues, precisions obtained were
72.7% and 65.8% respectively at MDev1 and MDev2
(Table 2 and Table 3). Even though precision values
between this restricted set and the extended set cannot be
compared due to the small size of the former, increase in
precision when detecting 'functional' residues as opposed
to 'catalytic' residues only (Table 3) is highly interesting
for the biological relevance of our detection method. Distribution of MDev values showed that this measure was
efficient at discriminating between residues, with very few
non-functional residues at high MDev values, as observed
e.g. on phenylalanine hydroxylase and the Fe3+-binding
protein (Figure 5).

Discussion
The present study proposes a new method for the prediction of catalytic sites in proteins based on their residueresidue contact networks. This method only relies on the
knowledge of protein three-dimensional structures, with
no requirement of functional attribution or sequence
alignment to other proteins, and can thus directly be
applied to proteins with no known homologues.

Definition of residue-residue contacts and local network
parameters
Residue interaction networks were built from protein
three-dimensional structures using all non-hydrogen
atoms to define contacts between residues. Edges were distinguished on whether the atoms involved belonged to
the side-chain or backbone of each residue. This distinction proved relevant, since Dg1SC (defined in Methods)
both produced a higher average MDev value over catalytic
residues from the extended set and was less correlated to
Dg3 than e.g. Dg1 (see Additional file 2).

Our results therefore prove that the use of these local
(Dg1SC) and semi-local (Dg3) parameters within the residue-interaction network that describes a protein structure
enabled a better detection of protein catalytic sites than
closeness centrality, a parameter that considers path
lengths between all residues of the network. They therefore suggest that local or semi-local organisation of residues is more critical than whole-protein structural
information to define them as catalytic or not, as shown
by the increased precision of detection obtained over 226
representative protein structures (Table 1). They moreover
validate our initial hypotheses of a stronger relevance of
chemically significant residue-residue contacts to define
catalytic sites.
It is likely that an even better detection shall be achieved
in the future by using different types of local network
parameters, possibly by combining them to other physico-chemical properties. Still, it is to be noted that combination of our two network parameters to the
crystallographic B-factor for each residue did not produce
a higher precision of the detection than that obtained
with the scoring function of Equation 1 (data not shown).
Choice of binary descriptors
The final performance of the detection was measured
using both precision (predictive value of positives) and
coverage, instead of the more classical specificity and sensitivity (coverage) combination. This choice was motivated by two reasons: a practical one and a
methodological one. The practical reason is the applicability of the method to the choice of protein amino-acids
that would be interesting for site-directed mutagenesis
experiments. Both a high rate of correctly predicted sites,
i.e. a low false detection rate, and a high coverage of functional sites, are the characteristics one would require for
efficient prediction. Indeed, these two criteria will provide
both a low rate of negative experiments and a high likelihood of detecting the active site for a given protein. The
methodological reason has grounds in the rates of
occurences of catalytic residues in the extended set. The
226 proteins have 62083 amino-acids in total, with 777
catalytic residues. Therefore, the sample is highly unbal-

BMC Bioinformatics 2008, 9:517

anced, with percentages of real positives (r+) and real negatives (r-) over this set of respectively 1.3% and 98.7% of
full sample. In such a case, small variations in the number
of correct predictions (and therefore of non-correct predictions) will have a low influence on measures of performance that use ratio to the number of residues
predicted as non-catalytic (p-), e.g. specificity or true negative rate. On the contrary, similar variations will have a
high influence over coverage or predictive value of positives, whose evaluation only involves positive residues
(predicted or real). For these two reasons, precision and
coverage were chosen as performance measures.
In order to obtain a single measure of performance for our
detection, precision and coverage were combined into an
effectiveness measure, the F-measure (see Methods).
Thresholds on MDev that produced maximal values for
this effectiveness measure were chosen in two conditions:
one where an equal relative importance was conferred to
precision and coverage (β = 1, threshold MDev1), and one
where precision was given a more important weight (β =
2, threshold MDev2). The use of two distinct threshold
values provides the user with two sets of residues to analyse of different sizes: a broad set presenting a high coverage, with low chances to miss an active site and more
experiments to perform (MDev1), and a narrow set, with
both fewer false positives and lower chances to hit an
active site, and also fewer experiments to perform
(MDev2).
Comparison to other methods
Table 1 compares the performance of our method with
one that combines closeness centrality and RSA [14],
using our extended set of 226 proteins. When using the
combination of Z-score on closeness centrality and RSA
criteria as proposed by Amitai et al. [14], a value of 8.2%
was obtained for the precision of the detection of catalytic
sites (Table 1). This value is to be compared with that of
28.1% obtained using our method (Table 1). As for the Fmeasure, respective values of 15.1% and 11.5% were
obtained when applying the method of Amitai and coworkers at β = 1 and β = 2, while our method produced values superior to 20% (Table 1).

The final performance of our method was also compared
to that proposed by Petrova, which uses Support Vector
Machine over 7 residue attributes. In that study, predictive
accuracy

(

( p + , r+ ) + ( p − , r− )
r+ + r−

) is used as a performance meas-

ure, for which an optimum value of 87% was obtained
[8], while a similar calculation on our method yielded a
value of 98.6% over our extended test set.
Lavery and co-workers used calculations of propensity of
protein residues to be locally displaced, or mechanical

rigidity, as a tool for detecting catalytic sites over various
proteins [42]. Their method produced both a high specificity and coverage of predictions, with respective values of
74% and 78% over 100 proteins. These values correspond
to a precision of 3.3% for the detection of catalytic sites. It
can also be noted that this method involved time-costing
molecular mechanics calculations on each protein structure, in comparison to ours which could be run in a few
seconds on each protein.
Further comparison to our method can also be performed
using the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve (see
Additional file 3) though, as discussed earlier, specificity
is not a relevant performance measure for such unbalanced samples.
'Catalytic' vs. 'functional' residues
When comparing the performance of the method over the
extended set and the restricted set, it was observed that a
higher precision was obtained on the second one than on
the first. One trivial bias could be due to the much smaller
size of the validation set, with 8 proteins vs. 226. Still, an
important difference in the measure of precision over the
validation set has to be noted. In the Catalytic Site Atlas,
residues are labelled as 'catalytic' if they are involved in
the catalytic reaction in the strict sense [6]. However,
when testing the performance of our scoring parameter on
the validation set, we manually defined residues that were
important for activity on grounds of functional and structural experiments. One difference between the two definitions is, for instance, that residues that bind an active-site
metal ion or are involved in substrate docking are considered as functional, in our definition, but are not present in
the Atlas. We could thus observe that our scoring function,
while optimised for detecting 'catalytic' residues from the
Catalytic Site Atlas, produced a higher precision at detecting 'functional' residues, both at MDev1 (72.7% vs.
45.5%) and MDev2 (65.8% vs. 31.6%), than at detecting
purely catalytic sites (Table 3). It should also be noted that
definition of functional residues as used for the validation
set, which originates from literature searches for each protein, is likely to be more accurate than that used to define
'catalytic' sites in the CSA. Indeed, a majority of the residues listed in the CSA are defined as catalytic using only
information from analogous proteins and sequence comparison methods [23]. These results thus further validate
the current method as a solid one for detecting functional
residues present at enzyme active sites, which can play
crucial roles in enzyme activities [35], and not only residues directly involved in catalytic reactions.

Conclusion
A scoring function based on residue local network
descriptors, which did not involve any sequence alignment of the proteins under study or any attribution of
function to proteins, was calculated for each residue of a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/517

set of proteins with known active sites. Residues were
labelled as catalytic when their resulting score was superior to a given threshold value, and the threshold was fitted in order to obtain a minimal false detection rate, or
maximal precision. Our detection method produced a
precision of 28.1% for the catalytic sites of 226 proteins
with variable folds and function, a more than three-fold
increase compared to existing methods (8.2% for closeness centrality combined with residue surface accessibility). On a smaller set of 8 proteins, use of the same
method produced a precision of 45.5% for the detection
of catalytic sites and, when extending the measure of performance to all residues that were crucial to protein activity, which we coined 'functional', precision of the
detection increased to 72.7%. The present scoring function, while optimised for 'catalytic' residues, thus proved
even more efficient at detecting 'functional' residues. The
high precision obtained with this method proved the
influence of the local environment of residues in structurally organising protein active sites. The method should be
of help in designing site-directed mutagenesis experiments with a low time-cost.

within a distance of 4.2Å. Side-chain-to-side-chain contacts represented contacts between any two atoms not
belonging to the amino-acid moiety (Cα, N or carbonyl
group) of two distinct residues.

Availability
The method can be applied to any protein structure (Xray, NMR or model) by submission of a PDB file to the
corresponding author. Two sets of residues will be produced: one that will only consider the residues predicted
as catalytic or functional at high coverage and average precision (MDev = MDev1), and another set, which will be a
subset of the previous one, with the residues predicted at
high precision and average coverage (MDev ≥ MDev2). An
online version for direct submission will soon be available on our web-page http://www.molgen.mpg.de/~lappe.

Methods
Definition of the extended test set
A non-redundant set of enzymes was selected from the
Catalytic Site Atlas http://www.ebi.ac.uk as in version
2.2.1. Proteins present in this Atlas were mapped with the
Structural Classification Of Proteins (SCOP, http://
scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/). Superfamilies which
included fewer than two proteins, as well as those belonging to the 'low resolution proteins' and to the 'designed
proteins' classes, were excluded. A single protein was randomly selected for each remaining SCOP superfamily. The
resulting set contained 226 proteins as listed in additional
file 4, with 62803 amino-acids, among which 777
labelled as 'catalytic' in the Catalytic Site Atlas.
Networks of residue interactions
Residue interaction networks were calculated from protein three-dimensional structures on all atom-to-all atom
contacts. Two residues were considered in contact if they
had a pair of not covalently-connected atoms that laid

Different network parameters were calculated for each residue within the resulting networks, such as direct neighbours defined on all-atom contacts (Dg1) or on contacts
involving only side-chain atoms (Dg1SC). More generally,
the Dgp value for a given node, with p an integer number,
represents the number of nodes that are located at exactly
p steps (or edges) from that node.
Standard values of Dg1SC per residue type were calculated
for a set of proteins that was obtained from the Pisces Protein Sequence Culling Server http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/
pisces/. Networks of residue interactions were calculated
for 1858 proteins with less than 25% sequence identity
and resolution better than 1.8Å. The resulting averaged
Dg1SC value for each amino-acid type was referred to as
<Dg1SC>. Parameter Dg1SC was thus transformed into
Dg1

formed on Dg1 for all residues from this set and enabled
us to define a <Dg1> value for each amino-acid type. This
normalised value was preferred to Dg1SC, since the
number of direct neighbours was highly dependent on the
residue type, an effect which is not observed in Dg1SC-R. In
contrast, the influence of the residue type on Dg2 or Dg3
was smaller, so no normalisation was used on these
parameters.
Closeness centrality for a node within a given network was
defined as the inverse of the average shortest path-length
to all other nodes, as used by Amitai [14].
Statistical analysis
For each network scoring function (x) used to characterize
a residue, the average ( x ), maximum (xmax) and standard

deviation (σ(x)) for that score over each protein residueresidue contact network were calculated. Parameters were
x−
then classified either on Z-scores: Z − score = s ( xx) or on

MDev = x x − x− x . MDev was chosen in order to measure a
max
deviation from maximum, rather than a deviation from
the average as in standardised Z-score. It was moreover
preferred to a plain ranking with selection of a fixed
number of residues for all proteins, since the number of
residues that define an active site can differ from a protein
to another and between catalytic functions. MDev pro-

duced a value of 0 for a residue with a parameter value x
equal to its average over the protein it belonged to, 1 for
the residue(s) with x equal to xmax for the protein, and negative values for residues with x values lower than the average parameter value over the protein.
Residues were considered as 'positives', i.e. predicted as
belonging to a catalytic site, if their Z or MDev value was
superior to a given threshold value for the score under
consideration. Each score was finally evaluated with
respect to precision (or predictive value of positives, ratio
of correct prediction of positives over all prediction of
positives) and coverage of positives (ratio of the number
of correctly predicted catalytic residues over the number
of residues that were effectively catalytic) over the protein
set. With r+ and r- the number of real catalytic and non-catalytic residues in the set under consideration, p+ and p- the
number of protein residues respectively predicted as
involved and not involved in catalysis, (p+, r+) the number
of correctly predicted catalytic residues, the values for the
different measures were:

precision =

(p + , r+ )
(p , r )
, coverage = + + .
p+
r+

For measuring the performance of the detection method,
a combination of precision and coverage was also used:
the F-measure [26], Fb =

(1+ b 2 )×(precision × coverage)
b 2 ×coverage + precision

.

Elaboration of the scoring function
The scoring function we derived from network parameters
was defined using a combination of two network parameters with a residue-type frequency. Use of two network
parameters was justified by the fact that any single parameter considered produced poor predictive values. The
parameters used were Dg3 and Dg1SC-R, because i) they
displayed a distribution of MDev values biased towards 1
for catalytic residues from the extended set and ii) they
possessed the smallest pairwise correlations between the
parameters that were considered (see Additional file 2).

The likelihood of each amino-acid to be a catalytic residue
was considered in our scoring function. A subset of the
Catalytic Site Atlas with no overlap with the extended test
set was defined, with the following rules: only entries with
literature evidences were included, a single chain was considered for PDB entries with multiple chains present in
the Atlas, and proteins from the 'low resolution proteins'
and 'designed proteins' classes were excluded. The resulting set included 546 proteins, for a total of 1478 catalytic
residues. Each residue was thus attributed a Dtype value,
which represented the percentage of residues of this given

type (Ala, Asp, Cys...) present over these 1478 catalytic residues.
The combined scoring function attributed to each residue
the following score:
⎛
Dg1SC ⎞ ⎡
Dg 33 × exp ⎜ k exp
⎟ × ⎢ 1 + k type × D type − med ⎡ D type ⎤ ⎤
⎣
⎦ ⎦
⎥
< Dg1SC > ⎠ ⎣
⎝

(

)

(1)
Variable parameters kexp and ktype were chosen in order to
produce a maximal performance value for the detection,
and had final values of 0.25 and 50, respectively.
Validation set
For a validation at the residue scale of the scoring parameter defined on the extended set, eight proteins belonging
to different functional classes were chosen for detailed
analysis. These proteins were as follows, with respective
PDB three-dimensional structures used to generate the
residue contact networks: TEM β-lactamase from Esch. coli
(E.C. 3.5.2.6, PDB entry 1m40, adduct with transitionstate analogue boronate), porcine pancreatic phospholipase (E.C. 3.1.1.4, PDB entry 1p2p, calcium bound),
DNA-alkylguanine transferase (E.C. 2.1.1.63, PDB entry
1eh6, unbound form), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 1
from Sacch. cerevisiae (E.C. 6.3.2.19, PDB entry 1fzy,
unbound form), phenylalanine hydroxylase from Chr.
violaceum (E.C. 1.14.16.1, PDB entry 1ltv, iron cofactor
bound), human peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (E.C. 5.2.1.8,
PDB entry 1pin, substrate Ala-Pro bound), ferric binding
protein from Hæm. influenzae (PDB entry 1mrp, iron and
phosphate bound) and bovine β-trypsin (E.C. 3.4.21.4,
PDB entry 5ptp, calcium bound).
