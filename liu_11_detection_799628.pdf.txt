Abstract
Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly discovered parvovirus associated with acute respiratory tract
illness (ARTI) and gastrointestinal illness. Our study is the first to analyze the characteristics of HBoV-positive
samples from ARTI patients with a wide age distribution from Guangzhou, southern China.
Methods: Throat swabs (n=2811) were collected and analyzed from children and adults with ARTI over a
13-month period. The HBoV complete genome from a 60 year-old female patient isolate was also determined.
Results: HBoV DNA was detected in 65/2811 (2.3%) samples, of which 61/1797 were from children (<18 years old)
and 4/1014 from adults (≥18 years old). Seasonal peaks of 4.8% and 7.7% were detected in May and June,
respectively. 28 of 65 (43.1%) HBoV-positive samples were co-detected with 11/16 other potential pathogens.
Mycoplasma pneumoniae had the highest frequency of 16.9% (11/65). Upper and lower respiratory tract illness were
common symptoms, with 19/65 (29.2%) patients diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiography. All four adult
patients had systemic influenza-like symptoms. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome revealed a close
relationship with other HBoVs, and a more distant relationship with HBoV2 and HBoV3.
Conclusions: HBoV was detected from children and adults with ARTI from Guangzhou, southern China. Elderly
people were also susceptive to HBoV. A single lineage of HBoV was detected among a wide age distribution of
patients with ARTI.

Background
Respiratory tract infection etiology is complex and diverse,
and new pathogens are continuously being reported. Over
the past few years, several novel respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [1], severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [2], human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [3,4], and coronavirus
HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) [5-7] have been identified.
In 2005, Allander et al. [8] reported a previously undescribed human parvovirus, human bocavirus (HBoV) that
belongs to the genus Bocavirus, in respiratory secretions
of children with respiratory tract disease in Sweden. HBoV
is a single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus
with a small genome size of approximately 5.3 kilo-bases
(kb), which has three open reading frames (ORF) encoding

two non-structural proteins NS1 and NP1, and the two
structural proteins VP1 and VP2. VP1 and VP2 are located
within the same ORF but have different initiator codon
positions [8].
Subsequently, HBoV was reported in respiratory samples
from different countries and regions worldwide [9-14],
where HBoV was detected in 1.5%-8.3% of respiratory
samples from individuals with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI), especially young children and infants. The
virus was also found in stool samples from patients with
gastrointestinal illness [15-22]. These reports suggest that
HBoV might be associated with upper and lower respiratory disease and gastrointestinal illness throughout the
world. In 2009, two viruses closely related to HBoV,
named HBoV2 [23] and HBoV3 [24], were found in stool
samples, and suggested HBoV diversity.
HBoV infection has recently attracted increasing attention all over the world. However, the incidence and clinical presentation of this infection varies widely, and often

involves co-infection with other potential pathogens
[9-22]. Such characteristics have led to debate over the
role of HBoV as a true pathogen. Therefore, additional
evidence and studies are needed throughout the world to
gain a better understanding of this virus. In this study,
2811 respiratory samples were collected from patients
(with an age range of 9 days to 84 years) with ARTI in
Guangzhou, southern China, from November 2009 to
November 2010 to analyze the characteristics of HBoVpositive patients.

Methods
Samples in this study were taken as part of standard care.
The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University Ethics Committee approved the experimental
design and patient involvement in this study.
Respiratory samples collection

Throat swab samples (n = 2811) were collected from
patients with ARTI (presented at least two of the following
symptoms: cough, pharyngeal discomfort, rhinobyon, snivel, sneeze, dyspnea) at three hospitals in Guangzhou,
southern China between November 2009 and November
2010. Patients’ ages ranged from nine days to 84 years,
and included 1797 children (<18-years-old) and 1014
adults (≥18-years-old). Clinical characteristics of the
patients were recorded for further analysis.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HBoV
detection

DNA from respiratory samples was extracted using a
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), in accordance with the
manufacturer’s protocol. Taqman real-time PCR primers
and probe were designed based on the conserved region
of the NP1 gene. Sequences were as follows: forward primer, 5’- GAG AGA GGC TCG GGC TCA TA-3’ (25452564 nt); reverse primer, 5’- TCG AAG CAG TGC AAG
ACG AT-3’ (2592-2611 nt); and probe, 5’-FAM- CAT
CAG GAA CAC CCA ATC AGC CAC C-BHQ1-3’
(2566-2590 nt). Primers and the probe were synthesized
by TaKaRa. Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real Time) real-time
PCR reaction buffer was also purchased from TaKaRa.
Amplification was conducted using 10 pmol of primers, 3
pmol of probe and 5 μl DNA in a final volume of 25 μl.
Cycling conditions included an initial incubation at 94°C
for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 10 sec and
55°C for 35 sec (ABI-7500 real-time PCR instrument,
Applied Biosystems). The amplified NP1 gene target
sequence (2545-2611 nt) was inserted into the pMD18-T
vector (TaKaRa) and used as a positive control for quantification analysis. Sensitivity of the PCR assay was calculated to be 10 copies of plasmid DNA using positive
control plasmid diluted gradients.

Detection of common respiratory pathogens in HBoVpositive samples

HBoV DNA positive samples were tested for 16 other
potential pathogens, including influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus (1, 2, 3, 4), respiratory
syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus (229E, OC43, NL63,
HKU1), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae by Taqman real-time PCR, in accordance with
the manufacturer’s protocol (Guangzhou HuYanSuo
Medical Technology Co., Ltd).
Complete genome sequencing

The complete genome of HBoV from a 60-year-old female
patient isolate was sequenced and analyzed. Sequencing
primer sets were designed according to HBoV genome
sequences available in the GenBank database (Table 1).
DNA template (2 μl) was added to the Pfu DNA polymerase reaction mixture (Fermentas) in a final volume of 25
μl and PCR amplified. Products were purified after 1%
agarose gel electrophoresis using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA was then sequenced
(ABI Genetic Analyzer 3130XL) and assembled using
DNASTAR-SeqMan software (DNASTAR, http://www.
dnastar.com/t-products-lasergene.aspx). PCR amplification
and sequencing were conducted at least twice to ensure
sequence accuracy.
Phylogenetic analysis

The HBoV complete genome (GU338055) was aligned to
other HBoV genomes available in the GenBank database
using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST,
http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Phylogenetic analysis of 18 complete genomes of HBoV, HBoV2 and HBoV3
from different countries and regions, including USA, Sweden, Thailand, Japan, Australia, China, Hong Kong, and
Taiwan was conducted using Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis Version 4.0 (MEGA 4.0, http://www.
megasoftware.net/). Phylogenetic trees were inferred from
VP1/VP2 (3056-5071 nt), NS1 (253-2172 nt), NP1 gene
(2410-3069 nt) and complete genome data (1-5299 nt)
using the neighbor-joining method, and bootstrap values
were calculated from 1000 replicates.
Statistical analysis

For comparison of categorical data, c2 test and Fisher’s
exact test where appropriate. All tests were two-tailed
and p < 0.05 was considered statistical significant.

Results
Detection of HBoV from patients with ARTI

HBoV DNA positive samples were detected in 65/2811

for >4-5 year-olds, and 1.1% (4/349) for >5-17 year-olds
(Figure 1), with a total of 3.4% (61/1797). The positive
rate of adults (≥18 year-old) was 0.4% (4/1014) (Figure
1).
The 65 positive patients were aged between 54 days
and 70 years, comprising 83.1% (54/65) that were ≤ 3
years-old, 10.8% (7/65) that were 4-17 years-old, and
6.2% (4/65) adult patients. Four HBoV-positive adults
were 19, 22, 60 and 70 years-old, respectively.

(single HBoV: 3.0%, co-pathogens: 1.8%) were found in
May 2010 and 7.7% (11/143) (single HBoV: 1.4%, copathogens: 6.3%) in June 2010 (Figure 2). The positive
rates of other seven months fluctuated around the total
rate of 2.3% (65/2811) (Figure 2).
Co-detection with common respiratory pathogens

HBoV DNA positive samples were co-detected with 11
of 16 upper referred pathogens in 28/65 (43.1%) of the
patients. Mycoplasma pneumoniae had the highest frequency of 16.9% (11/65), followed by RSV with 7.7% (5/
65) (Table 2).

Seasonal distribution of HBoV

The clinical characteristics of HBoV-positive patients

During our 13-month study period, more than 100 samples were collected for detection each month, and the
ratio of ≤3 year-old patients ranged from 20.2% to
66.5%. Low positive rates of 0.3% (1/369) (single HBoV:
0, co-pathogen: 0.3%) were detected in March 2010 and
0.7% (1/135) (single HBoV: 0.7%, co-pathogen: 0) in
October 2010, while high positive rates of 4.8% (8/166)

The male:female ratio was 42:23 in the HBoV-positive
patients which did not differ significantly from the
HBoV-negative patients (p = 0.40). The clinical characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 3. Most
patients presented with symptoms of upper respiratory
tract illness (URTI), including cough (93.8%) and expectoration (40.0%); 44 (67.7%) patients presented with

Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis

Complete HBoV genome sequences for isolates from a 60
year-old patient were sequenced and submitted to the
GeneBank (Accession Number:GU338055). The full
length of the genome was 5299 bases and the distribution
of A/G/C/T was 32.4%/20.4%/21.8%/25.4%, respectively.
Compared to the other HBoV genomes available in the
GeneBank database, GU330588 showed a 98% similarity
with the HBoV previously described by Allander et al.
[8]. Phylogenetic trees were inferred from VP1/VP2, NS1,
and NP1 gene data, in addition to the complete genome
sequence (Figure 3). GU330588 was similar to other
HBoVs, although it displayed obviously sequence variations from HBoV2 and HBoV3. Three HBoV lineages
were illustrated in all four phylogenetic trees (Figure 3).

pathogens”. Two of seven patients with systemic influenza-like symptom samples were co-detected with influenza A virus-enterovirus (triple pathogens) and
influenza B virus (dual pathogens), respectively, while
the remaining five patients were detected with single
HBoV. All four adult patients (≥18 years old) presented
with systemic influenza-like symptoms; three had only
HBoV detection and the other 19 year-old female
patient was co-detected with influenza B virus.

Discussion
HBoV is a novel parvovirus first described in 2005 by
Allander and colleagues [8]. Since that time, it has been
associated with upper and lower-respiratory tract disease
and gastrointestinal illness throughout the world.

However, most studies were focused on young children
and infants [9-14], and only a few papers have described
the characteristics of HBoV infection in adult patients
[16,25,26]. Our study successfully analyzed the characteristics of HBoV-positive samples from ARTI-infected
patients with a wide age distribution from Guangzhou,
southern China for the first reported time. Similar to
previous study [16], the detection rate in pediatric
patients (<18 years old) was significantly higher than
that in adults (≥18 years old) (p < 0.001), and most
HBoV-positive patients were ≤3 years old. HBoV was
detected in four adult patients, including 60 and 70
year-old patients. This suggested that older people were
also susceptive to HBoV infection, although at much
lower positive rates. Four adult patients also presented
with systemic influenza-like symptoms, which might
suggest that HBoV infection in adults is a more complex
and serious problem than in children.
While seasonal peaks of HBoV infection vary among different counties and regions because of climate and other
factors, many previous studies suggest a higher detection
rate in winter [27,28]. In our study, a higher frequency of

HBoV was observed between May and June during the 13month testing period (Figure 2). This result was similar to
the report of Choi and colleagues, in which a seasonal
peak was observed between May and June [29].
Characteristics of HBoV-positive patients in our study
were also similar to previous reports [9-14]. The male:
female ratio in the HBoV-positive patients did not differ
significantly from the HBoV-negative patients. In all
clinical characteristics, seven major symptoms (cough,
fever (≥38°C), abnormal pulmonary breath sound, dyspnea, expectoration, snivel and pneumonia) had the
highest ratio (ratio > 10%) (Table 3) and were common
as URTI and LRTI.
As previous studies [13,29-34], co-detection with other
potential pathogens was common in HBoV-positive
patients. In this work, 43.1% (28/65) patients were codetected with other 16 potential pathogens, and there
would be higher ratio if human rhinovirus were concerned [16]. Furthermore, not only co-pathogens but
also single HBoV groups had a high ratio of major
symptoms (Table 3), which might suggest HBoV is an
important pathogen in URTI and LRTI. A statistic

difference was found for the symptom of “pneumonia”
between the two groups “Single HBoV” and “Co-pathogens” (Table 3), which might further suggest HBoV is
an important pathogen. Further studies were required to
determine whether HBoV played a causative role in
these co-infections or acted as an exacerbation factor.
Before 2009, little variation was found in the surface
protein of HBoV (VP1-VP2), and some researchers predicted that HBoV infection might only occur after the
subsequently development of life-long immunity via the
neutralization of the target antibody [16]. However,
novel types of HBoV2 and HBoV3 were described successively in 2009 [23,24], suggested diversity within this
group of viruses. Furthermore, we successfully
sequenced the complete HBoV genome (GU338055) for
an isolate from an adult patient and phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of three lineages: group I,

HBoV; group II, HBoV2; group III, HBoV3, and
GU338055 was located in group I.
The frequency and clinical presentations of HBoV
infection vary widely [9-14,16,25,26] and are typically
associated with other pathogens [13,29-34]. Such characteristics have subsequently led many scientists to
question the role of HBoV as a potential pathogen. This
lack of information is largely because of the inability of
HBoV to grow in standard cell lines [35]. To confirm
the effects of HBoV, more studies are required throughout the world, focusing on various aspects of this infection, including epidemiology, serology, molecular
biology, in vitro culture and animal models.

Conclusions
HBoV was detected from children and adults with ARTI
from Guangzhou, southern China, and the features were

Liu et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:345
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/345

described in this study. HBoV was confirmed in elderly
patients (60 and 70 years old), suggesting that older
people were also susceptive to HBoV. All four adult
patients with HBoV positive in this study presented systemic influenza-like symptoms, which potentially suggest
that HBoV infection in adults may develop more serious
symptoms than those in children. Phylogenetic analysis
suggested that HBoV-GU338055 from an elderly patient
is in a single lineage with other HBoVs.
