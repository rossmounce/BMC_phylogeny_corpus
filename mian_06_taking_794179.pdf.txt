Abstract
Background: REX1 and REX2 are protein components of the RNA editing complex (the
editosome) and function as exouridylylases. The exact roles of REX1 and REX2 in the editosome
are unclear and the consequences of the presence of two related proteins are not fully understood.
Here, a variety of computational studies were performed to enhance understanding of the
structure and function of REX proteins in Trypanosoma and Leishmania species.
Results: Sequence analysis and homology modeling of the Endonuclease/Exonuclease/Phosphatase
(EEP) domain at the C-terminus of REX1 and REX2 highlights a common active site shared by all
EEP domains. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that REX proteins contain a distinct subfamily of EEP
domains. Inspection of three-dimensional models of the EEP domain in Trypanosoma brucei REX1
and REX2, and Leishmania major REX1 suggests variations of previously characterized key residues
likely to be important in catalysis and determining substrate specificity.
Conclusion: We have identified features of the REX EEP domain that distinguish it from other
family members and hence subfamily specific determinants of catalysis and substrate binding. The
results provide specific guidance for experimental investigations about the role(s) of REX proteins
in RNA editing.

Background
Most mitochondrial mRNAs in trypanosomatid parasites
such as Trypanosoma, and Leishmania species undergo RNA
editing [1-3]. This post-transcriptional process produces
mature and functional mRNAs through a series of coordinated steps catalysed by a multi-protein complex that
inserts and deletes uridylates (Us) specified by guide
RNAs (gRNAs). One hypothesis posits a structural and
functional subdivision of the editosome into insertion
and deletion subcomplexes [4-8]. Editosome proteins
with endonuclease (REN1, REN2) [9,10], terminal uridylyl transferase (TUTase; RET1, RET2) [6,11,12], 3' exouridylylase (exoUase; REX1, REX2[5,13], Ernst et al.,

unpublished), ligase (REL1, REL2) [5,8,14,15], and helicase (REH1) [16] activities have been identified and functionally characterized. Sets of proteins related by sequence
similarity exhibit both unique and common functions.
For instance, REN1 is an endoribonuclease that is specific
for RNA editing deletion sites whereas REN2 is specific for
RNA editing insertion sites. RET1 is implicated in the
addition of the non-encoded 3'-oligo U tails to gRNAs but
RET2 adds Us to pre-edited mRNAs. REL1 may be
involved in U-deletion editing and REL2 in U-insertion
editing. Six additional editosome proteins, KREPA1-A6,
have varying degrees of sequence relatedness with each
protein containing a C-terminal motif associated with an

oligonucleotide-binding (OB) fold [5,17-20]. Recent
results point to both REX1 and REX2 as candidates for the
RNA editing exoUase responsible for deletion of the 3'
overhanging U residues from the mRNA 5' cleavage fragment. A U-specific exonuclease, REX1, has been partially
purified from L. tarentolae [13]. The reconstitution of precleaved U-deletion in vitro with recombinant L. tarentolae
REX1 and REL1 proteins and the in vivo RNAi down-regulation of REX1 expression in T. brucei suggest that REX1 is
the exoUase. However, the closely related REX2 protein
(28% overall identity and 46% similarity in T. brucei) may
be the putative exoUase since tagged T. brucei REL1 subcomplex consisting of REX2, REL1 and KREPA2 catalyze
accurate U removal and ligation (i.e. pre-cleaved deletion
editing) [5]. Thus, the exact roles of REX1 and REX2 in the
editosome complex are unclear and the consequences of
the presence of two related proteins are not fully understood.
Comparative sequence analysis indicates that both REX1
and REX2 contain a putative C-terminal Endonuclease/
Exonuclease/Phosphatase (EEP) domain as well as a
region exhibiting subtle, but significant similarity to a
known 5'->3' exonuclease domain (L. major REX2 lacks an
EEP domain because of a truncation at the C-terminus)
[17]. Whether REX1 and REX2 have 5'->3' exonuclease
activity in the editing complex is unknown.
In this study, we extend our previous analysis of the REX1
and REX2 EEP domains [17]. We use sequence analysis,
homology modeling and phylogenetic analysis to
enhance understanding of the structure and functions of
REX proteins, as well as the relationships amongst EEP
family members. Our results suggest that while these
enzymes have diverged at the sequence level, the EEP
domains share a common catalytic site. Our three-dimensional modeling studies suggest that the REX EEP
domains fold in much the same way as other EEP
domains whose structures have been determined by X-ray
crystallography. We identify features of the REX EEP
domain that distinguish it from other family members
and hence subfamily specific determinants of catalysis
and substrate binding.

Results and discussion
Trypanosomal REX proteins
The REX1 and REX2 proteins from three trypanosomatids
show considerable sequence similarity suggesting they are
encoded by paralogous genes (Fig. 1). Since the genes are
present on non syntenic chromosomal regions in L. major
and T. brucei (chromosome assignments not having been
made for the T. cruzi genes) it is likely that the ancestral
genes diverged prior to the fission/fusion events which
resulted in the modern day trypanosomatid genomes.

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of EEP domains
The EEP domains in proteins from a variety of Eucarya
and Bacteria were modelled and analyzed using an HMMbased approach. Members of the EEP domain family
include magnesium dependent endonucleases (L1-EN,
DNaseI, APE1, APE2) [21-26], exonucleases (ExoIII,
REX1, REX2) [5,13,17,27], and phosphatases of lipid second messengers (I5PP) [28] (Fig. 2). Although these proteins have diverse substrate specificities, REX EEP
domains possess the conserved sequence motifs that have
been used to characterize other EEP domains (I to VI, Fig.
2). A phylogenetic tree of EEP domains indicates that REX
and APE proteins form distinct subfamilies (Fig. 3). EEP
domains in I5PP proteins are more REX- than APE-like.
Homology modelling of T. brucei REX1 and REX2 and L.
major REX1
The X-ray crystal structures of the EEP domains in two
DNA repair enzymes (Fig. 2, APE1_Hs_1HD7,
ExoIII_Ec_1AKO) [25,27] were used as the templates to
build homology models of the EEP domains in three REX
proteins (REX1_Tbrucei, REX2_Tbrucei, REX1_Lmajor).
H. sapiens APE1 and E. coli ExoIII are functional homologs
that possess apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease
activity and which hydrolyze the phosphodiester bond of
DNA at the AP sites by cleaving the DNA in intact strands
[29]. Although ExoIII also has 3'->5' exonuclease activity,
its biological role remains unclear. Following cleavage by
ExoIII or APE1 the bacterium E. coli uses DNA polymerase
I (pol I) to fill in the single-nucleotide gap whereas the
eucaryote H. sapiens uses DNA polymerase β (pol β). Pol I
has also a 3'->5' proof-reading activity which allows the
removal of misincorporated nucleotides [30]. Although
pol β is prone to high error (one mistake per 4000 bases
inserted) [31], it lacks the proof reading mechanism
found in pol I [32]. Instead, APE1 acts as an exonuclease
that trims off nucleotides from DNA ends that do not terminate in correct basepairs [33].

As would be expected, the four-layer α/β fold observed in
the crystal structures of the templates (APE1/1HD7;
ExoIII/1AKO) is reflected in the three-dimensional models of the target proteins (Fig. 4). The roles of amino acids
in the conserved sequence motifs found in EEP domains
(I to VI, Fig. 2) were examined in APE1/1HD7 and ExoIII/
1AKO (Table 1). Based on high resolution X-ray crystal
structures, the similar overall catalytic mechanism of
APE1 and ExoIII involves the abstraction of a proton from
a water molecule by a residue acting as a general base
[23,27]. The resultant nucleophilic hydroxide ion attacks
a scissile phosphate. The major difference between APE1
and ExoIII is that the catalytic residue which deprotonates
the water molecule in APE1 is Asp in motif IV whereas in
ExoIII it is the His in motif VI (Table 1 and Fig. 5, 6, 7). In
addition, ExoIII appears to be a relatively more powerful

3'-exonuclease than APE1 [34,35]. This enhanced activity
has been attributed to the fewer hydrophobic residues in
the active site of ExoIII [23,24] (and see below).
Putative activity and mechanisms of action of REX
proteins
To gain insights into the enzymatic activity of the REX
proteins, we measured the rmsd values of the superposed
models of each of REX EEP domain model to APE1/1HD7
and ExoIII/1AKO. The REX2_Tbrucei model is closer to
APE1/1HD7 than to ExoIII/1AKO (2.54 Å versus 4.19 Å).
In contrast, both the REX1_Lmajor and REX1_Tbrucei
models are closer to ExoIII (2.17 Å, 1.97 Å, respectively)
than to APE1/1HD7 (3.41 Å, 3.91 Å, respectively). These
results suggest that REX2_Tbrucei may have more in common with APE1/1HD7 whereas REX1_Lmajor and
REX1_Tbrucei may be more related to ExoIII/1AKO. The
latter data suggest that REX1 exoribonuclease activity in

both Leishmania and Trypanosoma species may share a similar catalytic mechanism with ExoIII [13]. These results
also raise the possibility that if REX2_Tbrucei is similar to
APE1, the potential proof-reading function of Trypanosoma REX2 may remove (i) the extraneous U residues
added during TUTase activity [36-38] and (ii) the Us that
result from TUTase function within a U-deletion site [39].
Current data indicate that Leishmania REX2 lack a C-terminal EEP domain (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) and hence potential proofreading activity. Although this function could be compensated for by the related REX1 protein (see below), the
absence of an EEP domain could be explained by less
extensive editing in Leishmania species compared to
Trypanosoma family members. While both APE1 and
ExoIII are known to act as endonucleases, such activity has
not yet been demonstrated for the REX family of proteins.

(Fig. 2 provides information on the proteins shown).

In addition to the primary catalytic residues, the active site
of APE1/1HD7 and ExoIII/1AKO contains a bulky hydrophobic pocket that has been proposed to act as a sequence
specific "gate-keeper" able to accommodate only abasic
sites [23,24]. In APE1/1HD7, the hydrophobic pocket is
composed of Phe266, Trp280, and Leu282 (Fig. 2, Fig. 5).
The equivalent pocket in ExoIII/1AKO is larger and consists of Trp212, Leu226, and Ile228 (Fig. 2, Fig. 6, 7).

Mutations of the APE1 hydrophobic pocket that results in
smaller residues (e.g. Phe266 to Ala/Cys, Trp280 to Ile/
Leu/Ser), can enhance its 3'-exonuclease activity [24].
ExoIII possesses a hydrophobic pocket containing only
one aromatic residue and the enzyme is a better 3' exonuclease than APE1. These two findings support the idea that
the hydrophobic pocket in EEP domains plays a significant role in nucleotide binding and specificity. Our
sequence and structural analysis suggests that REX1 and
REX2 do not have a bulky hydrophobic pocket but instead
share a pocket composed of smaller residues. The pocket
is formed by Arg834, Gly848, and Ala850 in REX2_T.brucei, Thr825, Gly839, and Ser841 in REX1_Tbrucei, and by
Ser916, Gly930, and Ser932 in REX1_Lmajor (Fig. 2, Fig.
5, 6, 7). The equivalent of Trp280 in APE1/1HD7 or
Leu226 in ExoIII/1AKO is Gly839 in REX1_Tbrucei,
Gly848 in REX2_Tbrucei, and Gly930 in REX1_Lmajor.
Thus, we predict that REX1 and REX2 have the potential
to accommodate an extrahelical residue (i.e. uridine)
downstream (3') of the scissile bond. The conserved polar
Ser/Thr in REX1, and positively charged Arg in REX2 may
form hydrogen bonds with the extrahelical base (column
in pink between conserved motifs IV and V in Fig. 2). In
REX1, a Ser in Leishmania is a Thr in Trypanosoma (Fig. 6,
7). This suggests altered substrate specificity for Leishmania species, which may partially compensate for the
absence of an EEP domain in REX2.
Comparison of the REX subfamily of EEP domains with
that of the B. taurus DNase I (DnaseI_Bt_1DNK, Fig. 2)
and inositol polyphosphate 5'-phosphatase (I5PP, Fig. 2)
family members reveals a conserved His in motif III (Fig.
2 and Table 1) [22,28,40]. In DNase I, this residue is part
of the essential His-Glu catalytic pair located within the
active site and is proposed to act as a general acid acting to
stabilize the leaving group [22]. Mutagenesis of Glu in
DNase I has also shown the importance of this residue for
catalytic activity. However, the sequence analysis of the
REX and other family members of EEP domains does not
reveal a conserved Glu or other negatively charged residue

that could pair with the His residue (Fig. 2) [41]. Therefore, we predict that in the REX EEP domains, the His residue forms a hydrogen bond to and further polarizes the
scissile phosphate, as previously proposed for the I5PP
family of proteins [41].

Conclusion
Using a variety of computational approaches, we have
identified conserved motifs and a critical substrate binding pocket in the REX subfamily of EEP domains. Our
results suggest experiments that could be performed to
examine the distinct catalytic roles of REX proteins in the
editosome.

genome sequences. These findings were later confirmed
through mutual best BlastP analysis amongst the unique
portions of the three essentially complete trypanosomatid
genomes. The sequences of these homologous genes were
also confirmed against the high coverage sequences available from the genome projects. The available, unfinished
genome sequences for the remaining trypanosomatids
discussed in this manuscript have been made available
through GeneDB, and were searched using the blast algorithm to identify putative orthologues in these species. In
a number of instances, the matches were not full length,
and the gene was present in more than a single contig,
thereby requiring assembly of the sequence to obtain fulllength genes.

The genomic locations of the trypanosomal proteins discussed in this work were determined using the GeneDB
Artemis interface to data from the TriTryp genomes
sequencing consortium [42]. Putative orthologs were initially identified using BLAST searches of the unfinished

(REX1_Lmajor). The four-layered α, β sandwich fold in each EEP domain is shown in the same orientation with the substrate
binding surface at the top.

Previously, we estimated an HMM of the EEP domain
using the SAM software suite version 3.3.1 [48] and a limited number of protein sequences [17]. For this work, the
parameters of this initial HMM were updated using an
expanded training set that included additional eukaryotic
(including trypanosomatid) and bacterial sequences. The
ensuing EEP domain HMM was used to generate a multiple sequence alignment of all the EEP domains in the
training set and the alignment was annotated with known
structural information for some members of the EEP
domain family (Fig. 2).
A phylogenetic tree for EEP domains was estimated using
an HMM-generated multiple sequence alignment of the

training set and ProtML in the MOLPHY software suite
version 2.3b3s. Since insert states in the HMM are uninformative, the alignment consisted only of residues
aligned to match states of the EEP HMM. ProtML infers an
evolutionary tree from amino acid sequences using the
Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. The tree with the
maximum likelihood was used to understand the relationships between EEP domains.

unknown structure against a domain of known structure
(Fig. 2). The sequences/structures of APE1_Hs_1HD7 and
ExoIII_Ec_1AKO were used as the templates for constructing models of three targets, REX1_Tbrucei, REX2_Tbrucei
and REX1_Lmajor. This particular choice was based on (i)
the functional homology and multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 2), (ii) a statistically significant PSI-BLAST
score between the target and an EEP family protein (Evalue = 5e-12 REX1_Tbrucei, 6e-08 REX1_Lmajor, and 2e08 REX2_Tbrucei), and (iii) a statistical significant score
produced by 3D-Jury (120–156, well above the cutoff
value of 50). The 3D-Jury metaserver [51] selects the most
abundant models from the set of 3D models generated by
various independent prediction providers. To measure the
r.m.s. deviation of the superposed template and the target,
the complete sequences of the predicted EEP domains
aligned in Figure 2 were used to measure the r.m.s. devi-

ation values. The quality of predicted modeled structures
were checked with the Profiles_3D program [52] in DS
Modeling 1.1.
