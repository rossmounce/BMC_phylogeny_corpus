Abstract
Background: Lung transplant recipients have an increased risk for actinomycetales infection
secondary to immunosuppressive regimen.
Case presentation: A case of pulmonary infection with bacteremia due to Tsukamurella
tyrosinosolvens in a 54-year old man who underwent a double lung transplantation four years
previously is presented.
Conclusion: The identification by conventional biochemical assays was unsuccessful and hsp gene
sequencing was used to identify Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens.

Background
Bacteria of the genus Tsukamurella are included in the
order Actinomycetales, characterized by mycolic acids. Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that the genus Tsukamurella is related to the genera Nocardia, Rhodococcus,
Dietzia, Gordonia, Streptomyces, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium [1,2]. The name of Tsukamurella comes from
Tsukamura, a microbiologist who in 1971 described the
first strain of Gordona aurantiaca, isolated from sputum of
a patient who was affected by a chronic lung pathology
[3]. Some Tsukamurella species are commensal bacteria
found in the environment, both at ground level and in
water, and are opportunistic bacteria in patients with
chronic pulmonary infection or in immunocompromized
patients [4,5]. To date, T. tyrosinosolvens has been isolated

only from human specimens and has always been associated with clinical disease [6].
In this report, we describe the first isolation of T. tyrosinosolvens from sputum and blood samples of a lung transplant patient.

Case presentation
A 54-year old man was hospitalized in July 2008 for a pulmonary infection. His medical history indicated 1) a lung
transplant in November 2004 for emphysema linked to
an alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, 2) chronic respiratory
insufficiency, and 3) hypertension. In addition, several
infectious episodes were noted in 2005 and 2006 following a fracture of the left femoral neck in May 2005 with

severe osteoporosis and a fracture of the right foot in June
2006.

Concerning the genotypic identification, a 16S rRNA gene
sequencing was first performed with the universal forward
27F (5'-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3') and reverse
1492R (5'-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3') primers
[7,8] generating amplicons of 1485 bp. PCR was performed with the Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Charbonnières-les-Bains, France). Amplification parameters
consisted of one cycle at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35
cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min,
and finally one cycle at 72°C for 5 min. The products of
PCR amplification were purified using MicroSpin S-400
HR columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) and sequencing of these products was
achieved on both strands using the initial set of PCR primers, and internal primers F1-16S-Seq-Univ (5'GCTAACTCCGTGCCAGCAG-3') and R1-16S-Seq-Univ
(5'-TTGCGGGACTTAACCCAAC-3'), using an Applied
Biosystems 3130 xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with the fluorescent Big Dye
terminator V1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Amplified primer-less sequences were compared to the
GenBank database with the nucleotide Blast program at
the National Center for Biotechnology Information Computer server [9]http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi.
The sequence showed 99% identity in a 1332 nucleotide
overlap with T. tyrosinosolvens and the species identification was confirmed by using the bioinformatics bacterial
identification tool BIBI [10] (strain Bx-62986 closely
related to type strain T. tyrosinosolvens DSM 44234). Second, this species identification based on the 16S rRNA
gene was confirmed with another identification based on
heat shock protein coding gene sequencing. The available
hsp sequences of T. tyrosinosolvens strain IMMIB D-1411
and Tsukamurella paurometabola strain 2061 (GenBank
accession numbers: TTU90204 and AF352578), respectively were aligned using multiple sequence alignment
with hierarchical clustering [11]http://bioinfo.genot
oul.fr/multalin/multalin.html and analyzed to identify
conserved regions for the primer design. The resulting
primer set F2-HSP-Tsu (5'-AATTGCGTTCGACRAARAGG3') and R2-HSP-Tsu (5'-AATCCATGCCACCCATGC-3')
were designed using the web Primer3 software [12]http://
frodo.wi.mit.edu/. Amplification parameters consisted of
95°C for 5 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 30 s
and 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 90 s, and finally one cycle
at 72°C for 5 min. Amplified DNA fragments were purified and direct sequencing was carried out on both strands
(see above) with the PCR primers and the newly designed
internal primers F3-HSP-Tsu (5'-GGACATGGCGATCCTCAC-3')
and
R3-HSP-Tsu
(5'-ACGATGGTGGTCTCGTCCT-3'). When compared with the NCBI Blast
program, the 1576 nucleotide sequence had 96% identity
in a 1579 nucleotide overlap while the deduced protein

Upon admission, the patient described a chronic cough
with abundant expectorations during the previous ten
days. No fever was noted. The bronchial endoscopy
showed of the presence of abundant secretions in the right
bronchial tree. The mucous was notably inflammatory.
The bronchial biopsies revealed acute bronchitis signs. A
broncho-alveolar fluid sample was sent to the bacteriology laboratory and the analysis showed 4 × 107 cells/mL
with 93% polymorphs. The presence of Gram-positive
bacilli was noted, but Ziehl-Neelsen staining was negative.
A few hours post- endoscopy, a fever appeared (temperature up to 40°C) and three series of aerobic and anaerobic
blood cultures were done. Blood culture showed only
Gram-positive bacilli from the three aerobic bottles after
5 days which were identical to those identified in the
broncho-alveolar fluid grown at the same time.
A therapy associating imipenem and tobramycin led to a
significant clinical improvement, with a reduction in sputum volume, cough and apyrexa within 3 days. A cardiac
transesophagal echography was performed to rule out
endocarditis. The evolution was favorable with an important decrease in the inflammatory syndrome, the C-reactive proteins decreased from 103 to 9.3 mg/L.

Methods
With regard to the phenotypic identification, the isolate
grew aerobically on blood agar at 37°C forming colonies
with an unusual morphology. The colonies were rough
and yellowish, similar to fungal growth. Phenotypic identification of Gram-positive organisms was performed
employing the API Corynebacterium System (bioMérieux,
Marcy l'Eoile, France) and other biochemical tests, including detection of arylsulfatase, lysozyme growth, and
hydrolysis of casein, xanthine and tyrosine. They were all
interpreted using conventional methods. The isolate was
further examined using the GenoType Mycobacteria
Molecular Genetic Assay (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany); although both conjugate and universal controls
were positive, the isolate failed to hybridize with the 13
bacterial species targetted by the kit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using a diffusion
method. The strain was resistant to penicillin G, ampicillin, oxacillin, cefalotin, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam, erythromycin, spiramycin and pristinamycin but
was sensitive to imipenem, ertapenem, doxycycline, tigecycline, cotrimoxazol, rifampicin, vancomycin and linezolid. As identification based on this technology and the
biochemical profile was unsuccessful, we turned to genotyping.

sequence had a 97% identity in a 524 residue overlap,
thus confirming the 16S rRNA gene identification.

blood culture helped to determine the etiology of pulmonary disease.

The 16S rDNA and hsp65 sequences from the T. tyrosinosolvens Bx-62986 strain were submitted to GenBank and
assigned accession numbers FJ643548 and FJ643549,
respectively.

Sequence-based identification is an alternative method to
identify clinical isolates that are either slow growers or difficult to identify by biochemical profiling. The 16S rRNA
gene is the most frequent target used in clinical laboratories for molecular identification, but in some cases this
tool can only help to identify the genus and it is not discriminative enough for speciation within the genus.
Under such circumstances, sequences of essential genes
such as hsp have been shown to be useful for the identification.

A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the nucleotide
sequence of 16S rRNA gene, as well as on both the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the heat
shock protein (HSP) from the isolate Bx-62986 and from
other bacterial strains. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using the MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) software version 4
[13]. Nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA gene as well
as nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the HSP were
downloaded from GenBank databases (except for the Bx62986 isolate) and aligned using the multiple alignment
options in CLUSTAL followed by minor manual adjustments. Phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighborjoining method. Branching significance was estimated
using bootstrap confidence levels by randomly resampling the data 1000 times with the referred evolutionary
distance model. Both trees were similar. With regard to
HSP sequences, higher bootstrap values were obtained
with protein sequences than with nucleotide sequences
(data not shown). Both trees were highly similar and the
analysis placed most sequences into species-specific clusters (Figure 1). As expected, the isolate Bx-62986 was
closely related to T. tyrosinosolvens. Globally, the high
bootstrap values obtained with the HSP protein sequences
suggest that this protein could be useful for phylogenetic
analyses.

Conclusion
Human infections with T. tyrosinosolvens are very rare with
only six cases reported in the literature. In all of the cases,
this bacterium was isolated in immunocompromized
patients with gastric cancer [14] or chronic pulmonary
infections [6] and in patients who were carriers of cardiac
implants or intravascular catheters [15-17].
Tsukamurella species are strictly aerobic Gram-positive
rods which can be easily misidentified as Corynebacterium
species, Nocardia species or Mycobacteria species. The difficulties encountered in the identification of these bacteria
were previously reported by Almuzara et al [18] who
noted that the identification by the API Coryne bacterium
System is limited and by Stanley et al [19] who failed in
identifying them with GenoType. The difficulty in identifying the organism by phenotypic methods suggests that
T. tyrosinosolvens and related species may well be underdiagnosed as a cause of pulmonary infections. In our case,

This report finally highlights the difficulty in identifying
the genus Tsukamurella. There is currently no commercially available test for Gram-positive rods for the identification of Tsukamurella spp. Genotypic methods are
therefore the logical solution to identify certain bacterial
isolates. Unfortunately, they have not yet become routine
methods in the laboratory. Nevertheless, they may be useful for epidemiological characterization of unusual causal
agents of bacteremia in immunocompromized patients.
