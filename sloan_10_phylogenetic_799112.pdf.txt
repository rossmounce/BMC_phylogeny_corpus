Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial
substitution rate variation in the angiosperm
tribe Sileneae
Daniel B Sloan1, Bengt Oxelman2*, Anja Rautenberg3, Douglas R Taylor1
Correction
The published version of the article entitled “Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial substitution rate variation in the angiosperm tribe Sileneae” [1] contained an
error in the legend of Figure 2. The third sentence of
the legend should have read, “Values to the right of
each node show parsimony bootstrap support and Bayesian posterior probability (in that order) for the corresponding clade.” The authors regret the error and
apologize for any confusion it may have caused.
