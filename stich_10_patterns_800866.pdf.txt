Abstract
Background: The distribution area of pearl millet in West and Central Africa (WCA) harbours a wide range of
climatic and environmental conditions as well as diverse farmer preferences and pearl millet utilization habits
which have the potential to lead to local adaptation and thereby to population structure. The objectives of our
research were to (i) assess the geographical distribution of genetic diversity in pearl millet inbreds derived from
landraces, (ii) assess the population structure of pearl millet from WCA, and (iii) identify those geographical
parameters and environmental factors from the location at which landraces were sampled, as well as those
phenotypic traits that may have affected or led to this population structure. Our study was based on a set of 145
inbred lines derived from 122 different pearl millet landraces from WCA.
Results: Five sub-groups were detected within the entire germplasm set by STRUCTURE. We observed that the
phenotypic traits flowering time, relative response to photoperiod, and panicle length were significantly associated
with population structure but not the environmental factors which are expected to influence these traits in natural
populations such as latitude, temperature, or precipitation.
Conclusions: Our results suggested that for pearl millet natural selection is compared to artificial selection less
important in shaping populations.

Background
Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is an
annual, diploid, highly allogamous cereal with seven
chromosome pairs [1]. It can be grown in a vast range
of environmental conditions including environments
that are characterized by frequent drought events and
poor soil fertility [2]. This is one reason that pearl millet
is one of the most important staple food crops in West
and Central Africa (WCA) [3]. The other reason is that
pearl millet grain has relatively high nutritional values
for a cereal. Its grain has higher protein and fat content
than wheat or rice and its amino acid composition is

more appropriate for human nutrition than that of
wheat or polished rice [4-6].
Cultivated pearl millet displays tremendous phenotypic variability for traits such as flowering time, panicle
length, grain and stover characteristics, tolerance to
drought, pests, and diseases, as well as nutritional value
(e.g., [7]). Efficient and systematic exploitation of this
diversity is the key to any crop improvement program
[8]. This, however, requires in a first step the assessment
of genetic diversity and population structure of the species under consideration.
For pearl millet, several studies have examined these
issues. [9] determined the influence of farmer management on pearl millet landrace diversity in two villages in
North-Eastern Nigeria. [10] assessed the genetic diversity within and between ten Indian pearl millet landraces. The genetic diversity of 46 wild and 421

cultivated genotypes of pearl millet from Niger was analyzed by [11,12] examined the phylogeny and origin of
pearl millet. However, to our knowledge, no earlier
study examined the genetic diversity and population
structure of pearl millet across a wide geographic range
in WCA.
The distribution area of pearl millet in WCA harbours
a wide range of climatic and environmental conditions
as well as diverse farmer preferences and pearl millet
utilization habits (cf. [13]). This may lead to local adaptation and thereby to population structure. However, no
earlier study examined systematically the forces that
may have affected or led to the observed population
structure in pearl millet.
The objectives of our research were to (i) assess the
geographical distribution of genetic diversity, (ii) assess
the population structure of pearl millet from WCA, and
(iii) identify those geographical parameters and environmental factors from the location at which landraces
were sampled, as well as those phenotypic traits that
may have affected or led to this population structure.

Results
The heritabilities of the four phenotypic traits assessed
for the 145 pearl millet in-breds ranged from 0.64 for
SV to 0.93 for PL and was 0.80 for PH and 0.89 for FT.
The geographic and environmental parameters as well
as the phenotypic traits available for all pearl millet
inbreds showed a continous distribution (Figure 1). The
correlation between the geographic and environmental
parameters and examined phenotypic traits ranged from
-0.828 between latitude and precipitation to 0.667
between latitude and mean annual temperature.
For the 20 SSR markers examined in our study, the
number of alleles ranged from 9 to 28 (Table 1), with
an average of 16.4. Gene diversity D was lowest for markers PSMP2249 and PSMP2267 (0.49) and highest for
marker PSMP2063 (0.92). The average D value across
all pearl millet inbreds was 0.74.
The first two principal components, which explained
4.2 and 3.9% of the total genetic variation, revealed no
obvious clusters (Figure 2). The STRUCTURE analysis
resulted in five sub-groups and one admixed group.
These groups, which comprised between 14 and 40
inbreds (Table 2), were located in different sectors of
the PCA. The gene diversity D of the sub-groups ranged
from 0.62 (sub-group 1) to 0.72 (sub-group 4) and the
number of group-specific alleles varied between 15 (subgroup 3) and 44 (sub-group 4). The overall fixation
index Fst was 0.08. The number of alleles per locus of
the pearl millet subsets of size 5, 10, 15, ..., 40 which
maximize the gene diversity D ranged from 4.5 to 12.5,
where gene diversity D varied between 0.74 and 0.82
(Table 3).

The AMOVA with the country of origin as hierarchy
level revealed that most of the genetic variation was present between inbreds derived from landraces of the
same country as well as within landraces but only a
small proportion of the total genetic variation was attributable to countries (Additional file 1). The same trend
was observed with respect to the agro-ecological zone of
origin as hierarchy level (Additional file 1). Plotting the
STRUCTURE results on the geographic map revealed
no obvious association of sub-group membership probability and country of origin or agro-ecological zone of
origin (Figure 3).
The pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient between
MRD and the geographic or phenotypic trait-based distances was highest for SBD (0.220) and lowest for PH
(-0.028) (Table 4). The highest correlation with SBD
was observed for PL (0.077) and the lowest for annual
temperature (-0.023). The tests of association between
the Q matrix from STRUCTURE and geographic or
environmental parameters as well as phenotypic traits
were significant (a = 0.05) for FT, RRP, PL, and country
of origin.

Discussion
Genetic diversity of the examined pearl millet germplasm

Irrespective of the considered hierarchy level, the
AMOVA revealed that about four times more variation
was present between landraces than within landraces
(Additional file 1). Our finding is in good accordance
with the results of [10] who observed that about 2.5
times more variation was present between Indian pearl
millet landraces than within the landraces. Consequently,
we observed realistic estimates of within and between
landrace variation despite the fact that we examined
inbreds derived from landraces as well as that the average
number of inbreds per landrace was only 1.2.
Long-term selection gain requires genetic variability
[8]. Therefore, it was important to examine the genetic
diversity of the pearl millet inbreds analyzed in our
study. Since estimates of genetic diversity D are not
affected by differences in sample size, direct comparisons between different studies are possible. Across the
145 pearl millet inbreds examined, we observed a total
gene diversity D of 0.74 (Table 2). This value is higher
than the gene diversity estimates observed in the study
of [11] (0.49) for 421 genotypes of 140 allogamous cultivated pear millet landracs from Niger, based on SSR
marker. This difference might be explained by the fact
that in the latter study only genotypes from Niger were
examined, whereas the inbreds of our study were
derived from landraces from a much larger area of
WCA. Furthermore, we observed a higher D value than
[12] (0.60) for a pearl millet world collection. This finding might be due to the fact that we used a higher

proportion of di-nucleotide repeat SSR markers, which
tend to be more variable than SSRs with longer repeat
motifs (cf., [14]), than [12].
Our observation on D was supported by the results on
the average number of alleles per locus. Although our
population size was smaller than that of the other studies and we examined inbreds instead of heterozygous
genotypes, we observed a considerably higher number of
alleles per locus (16.4) (Table 2) than previously reported by [11] (6.2) and [12] (9.6). These findings on D
and the average number of alleles per locus suggested

that the pearl millet inbreds examined in this study is a
valuable resource for increasing the genetic diversity in
pearl millet breeding pro-grams.
Spatial distribution of genetic diversity

We observed differences between the genetic diversity
parameters gene diversity D, average number of alleles
per locus, and the number of group specific alleles A
between the pearl millet inbreds originating from different WCA countries (Table 2). However, these differences are to a large extent (data not shown) only due to

the fact that the number of inbreds originating from
each of the ten countries differed considerably. Furthermore, the AMOVA revealed that less than one percent
of the variation was found between countries (Additional file 1). This observation is in contrast to findings
of [15], who observed statistically different D values for
pearl millet genotypes from different countries. In addition, that study reported coefficients of differentiation
between the genotypes from different countries (0.070.23) that suggested the presence of considerable
variation between countries. These contrasting findings
compared to our results might be due to the fact that
our sampling was extremely unbalanced with respect to
the number of inbreds per country. Another explanation
might be that our study was based on SSR markers,
whereas [15] examined isozyme markers that may not
be selectively neutral and reveal only a low number of
alleles per locus.
In WCA, pearl millet is cultivated throughout three
agro-ecological zones [16]. The adaptation of pearl millet
to these different environments has the potential to lead
to genetic differentiation. However, AMOVA revealed
that almost none of the SSR genotype variation observed
could be attributed to differences between the agroecological zones (Additional file 1). Our observation suggested that establishing core-collections based on the
information of the agro-ecological zone of origin (e.g.,

[7]) might be sub-optimal. This was supported by our
observation that the three agro-ecological zones contributed different numbers of inbreds to the pearl millet subsets maximizing the gene diversity D (Table 3).
Our findings might be explained by the habit of farmers, especially in the sudano-sahelian and in the sudanian zones, to grow not only one landrace but several
(Bettina I.G. Haussmann, personal communication). In
order to fill the hungry period, an early maturing landrace is cultivated, and in addition a landrace with late
maturity that has a high yield potential in years with
good growing conditions but might fail in years with
severe terminal drought. Also the highly allogamous
behaviour of the crop combined with an overlapping
flowering time of early and late but photo-sensitive
landraces in certain years with late planting dates has
the potential to diluting differentiation between agroecological zones. Finally, our observation might be
explained by the fact that the environmental conditions
within each agro-ecological zone are too heterogeneous
(high inter-annual climate variability) to permit

Inference of population structure

Due to the fact that neither country nor agro-ecological
zone of origin revealed a clear sub-grouping of the pearl
millet inbreds examined in our study (Additional file 1).
we used the software STRUCTURE [17] to infer the
population structure. The results of this analysis indicated that the 145 pearl millet inbreds of our study
belong to five sub-groups (Additional file 2). The grouping of the pearl millet inbreds by STRUCTURE was in
fair accordance with the results of the PCA (Figure 2).
the five groups showed no distinct clusters but were
located in different sectors of the PCA. Our finding
together with an overall Fst value of 0.08 suggested that
the sub-groups of pearl millet are not as differentiated
as in maize (e.g., [18]).
Our finding of five sub-groups for pearl millet inbreds
from WCA was in the range of previously reported
numbers of sub-groups. [15] identified based on isozyme
markers two distinct sub-groups in pearl millet inbreds

from West Africa, whereas [19] reported three subgroups for pearl millet landraces from Niger. In
contrast, [1] identified based on phenotypic data of morphological and disease resistance traits ten clusters of
pearl millet landraces from Burkina Faso. These differences in the number of sub-groups compared to our
study, are most likely due to the fact that earlier studies
examined a lower number of accessions than we did. In
addition, the above mentioned studies were based either
on phenotypic data or a relatively low number of isozyme markers, while we used SSR markers to examine
pearl millet inbreds.
Association of population structure and geographical,
environmental, and phenotypic parameters

In the harshest production environments in WCA,
farmers rely in highly cross-pollinated pearl millet landraces with site-specific adaptation and good production
stability that are rarely outyielded by on-station-bred
improved cultivars [20]. Thereby, farmers, together with
the environmental factors, shape the pearl millet populations (cf. [9,21]). Identifying the variables that are correlated with population structure, thus, has the potential
to help identify adaptive traits as well as the environmental conditions which are the driving factors of
adaptation.
We observed that the phenotypic traits FT, PPR, and
PL were significantly associated with the Q matrix from
STRUCTURE (Table 4) using a multivariate linear

regression model. For FT, our observation is in accordance with observations in other plant species such as
maize [22,23] or Arabidopsis [24]. This finding can be
explained by the fact that FT is in most plant species
under divergent selection as it is the key adaptive trait
enabling plants to flower at the optimum time for pollination and seed development [25].
In WCA, the growing conditions of pearl millet are
characterized, among other hazards, by highly variable
beginnings of the rainy season [26]. Photoperiod-sensitive flowering, in our study measured as PPR, has the
potential to enhance adaptation to such environments.
This is due to the fact that it leads to simultaneous
flowering of genotypes in the target region, independent
of the individual date of sowing in different fields. This
in turn, is expected to lead to divergence and thereby
might explain why PPR is associated with population
stucture in pearl millet (Table 4).
Our finding that PL was significantly associated with
the Q matrix from STRUCTURE (Table 4) might be
explained by the fact that farmers preferences seem to
differ largely in different regions of WCA (cf. [27]). This
has the potential to lead to population stucture. The preference for a long panicle in certain regions of WCA is
mostly due to practical reasons. In these areas, the harvested pearl millet panicles are usually tied up into bundles for transport from the field to the grain store, and
this can be more easily done with long panicles, where
short panicles require usually a bag for transportation.
We observed that the phenotypic traits FT, RRP, and
PL were significantly associated with the Q matrix from
STRUCTURE, but not the environmental factors (Table
4) that are expected to influence these traits in natural
populations such as latitude, temperature, or precipitation (also not the monthly averages; data not shown).

This was also true, if the phenotypic traits were used as
cofactors when examining the environmental factors
(data not shown). Our results suggested that for pearl
millet landraces natural selection is less important than
human selection in shaping populations which in turn
can be explained by the fact that pearl millet landraces
are no natural populations.

Conclusions
Our findings of high D values as well as a high average
number of alleles per locus suggested that the pearl
millet inbreds examined in this study is a valuable
resource for increasing the genetic diversity in pearl
millet breeding programs. Furthermore, the results of
this study suggested that for pearl millet landraces natural selection is less important than human selection in
shaping populations.

traits were seedling vigor (SV, score from 1 to 5, 1 = best,
5 = worst), flowering time (FT, Julian days), plant height
(PH, cm), and panicle length (PL, cm). For each trait, the
adjusted entry mean across both sowing dates, where heterogeneous error variances were assumed, was calculated.
Heritability h2 was computed as:

Methods

where s2g is the genotypic variance and v 2 the mean
variance of a difference of two adjusted treatment means
[31]. Furthermore, for each inbred, the relative response
to photoperiod (RRP) was calculated as 1-(FT 2 /FT 1 )
[32], where FT1 and FT2 were the adjusted entry means
for FT (Julian days) observed in the first and second
experiment, respectively. This parameter is unit-less and
deviates from 0 for genotypes responding to
photoperiod.

Plant materials

A set of 145 inbred lines (14 inbreds in S3, 131 inbreds in
S4), derived from 122 different pearl millet landraces,
were used in this study (Additional file 3). Our study was
based on inbred lines derived from landraces as for this
type of germplasm phenotypic evaluation can be performed on the basis of several plants per genotype and,
thus, with higher heritability. Landraces were considered
as different, if they have a different local name or were
collected from different locations (cf. [9]). The number of
inbreds per landrace ranged from one to two and was on
average 1.2. The landraces had been assembled during
joint pearl millet collection missions involving the “Institut de la Recherche pour le Développement” (IRD) and
International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics (ICRISAT) in 1976 and 2003, and were obtained
by ICRISAT Niger in 2005 from IRD Montpellier. The
geographic origin of the landraces covered 117 villages
located in the following ten WCA countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad,
Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. From each
collection site, the geographic coordinates were recorded
using a GPS device.
Environmental parameters and phenotypic evaluation

For each collection site, mean annual precipitation and
mean annual temperature were calculated using the
gridded bivariate interpolation method [28] based on
more than 160 years of data available from ftp://ftp.
ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/v2/. Based on the mean
annual precipitation, each collection site was assigned to
one of three agro-ecological zones (sahelian, sudanosahelian, sudanian) [16]. In addition, the altitude of each
collection site was obtained by cross-referencing the
geographic coordinates with the WORLDCLIM database
[29] using DIVA-GIS software [30].
All 145 pearl millet inbreds were grown in 2007 on the
ICRISAT research station in Sadore (Niger) with two
sowing dates (15th June and 16th July). The two experiments were located next to each other. The design of
each experiment was an a-lattice with two replicates. As
experimental units, one-row plots with a length of 4.8 m
and with 0.75 m between rows, were used. The recorded

Molecular markers

Total genomic DNA was extracted from leaf tissue using
a modified CTAB protocol [33]. A total of 20 simple
sequence repeat markers (SSRs) [34-37] (Additional file
4) were used to genotype the 145 pearl millet inbreds.
The SSRs were grouped into multiplex sets of three,
where forward primers were labeled with fluorescent
dyes (6-FAM, HEX, and TET; Biomers GmbH, Germany), and amplicons were generated using an amplification program of 94°C/3 min, followed by 30 cycles of
94°C/45 s, optimum annealing temperature Topt/1 min
(Additional file 4) and 72°C/45 s, and a final extension
step of 72°C/10 min. PCR products were denatured and
size-fractioned using capillary electrophoresis on a
MegaBACE sequencer (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden).
The MegaBACE Fragment Profiler v1.2 (Amersham
Biosciences, Sweden) was applied to size peak patterns,
using internal ROX 400 HD for allele calling (Additional
file 5). Each of the 20 SSRs showed less than 25% missing values. The map positions of these markers were
extracted from the Gramene database.
Statistical analyses

Due to the genome-wide distribution of the SSR markers used in this study (Additional file 4) as well as the
rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium in pearl millet
[38], linkage disequilibrium between markers was
neglected for all statistical analyses described below. The
number of alleles per locus, the number of group-specific alleles A, and the gene diversity D [39] were determined. Modified Rogers distance (MRD) was calculated
according to [40] and an F st analysis was performed
according to [39] using the observed and expected

Stich et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:216

heterozygosities for the population under consideration.
Principal component analysis (PCA) of the 145 inbreds
based on the (i) SSR allele frequency matrix and (ii) geographical and environmental parameters as well as the
evaluated phenotypic traits (Additional file 6) was carried out. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA)
were performed using Arlequin [41].
In order to identify those r = 5, 10, 15, ..., 40 pearl
millet inbreds which maximize the gene diversity D, we
used an algorithm which is based on an iterative maximization procedure [42]. Briefly, a subset of r inbreds
was first chosen at random from the entire 145 pearl
millet inbreds. In step one, all the subsets of size (r - 1)
were examined. The subset having the highest level of D
was retained. In step two, among the remnant inbreds,
the inbred bringing the greatest increase in D was
added. These two steps were repeated until the gene
diversity D of the subset reached a maximum.
A model-based approach implemented in software
package STRUCTURE [17] was used to determine the
presence of population structure and assign pearl millet
inbred lines to sub-groups. In our investigations, the set
of 145 inbreds was analyzed by setting the number of
sub-groups from one to 20 with five repetitions. For
each run of STRUCTURE, the burn-in time as well as
the iteration number for the Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm was set to 100,000. We used the ad hoc criterion described by [43] to estimate the number of subgroups. From the five repetitions with the estimated
number of sub-groups, the one with the maximum likelihood was used to assign lines with membership probabilities of 0.80 or more to sub-groups. Inbreds with
membership probabilities less than 0.80 for all individual
sub-groups were assigned to an admixed group.
Pairwise geographic distances between all 145 pearl
millet inbreds were calculated from the geographic coordinates. Furthermore, for each geographic and environmental parameter, phenotypic trait, as well as for the Q
matrix from STRUCTURE (SBD), distances ED between
all pairs of pearl millet inbreds were calculated as:
−
⎛ t − t − t jk − t k

⎜ ik

where EDij is the distance between inbred i and j, n

tik and tjk the parameter values of the inbreds i and j for

Page 8 of 10

Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for all
combinations between MRD and the above mentioned
distances as well as between SBD and the above mentioned distances. In addition, we used the following
multivariate linear regression model:
Q il =  l + t i + e il ,

where Qil is the probability that the ith pearl millet
inbred belongs to the lth sub-group (i.e., the value of
the ith row in the lth column of the Q matrix from
STRUCTURE), μl the intercept term for the lth column
of the Q matrix from STRUCTURE, t i the parameter
value of the ith pearl millet inbred, and eil the residual.
We examined the geographic or environmental parameters as well as phenotypic traits with this model in
order to identify those parameterrs which explain best
the variation in the Q matrix from STRUCTURE.
If not stated differently, all analyses were performed
with the statistical software R [44].
