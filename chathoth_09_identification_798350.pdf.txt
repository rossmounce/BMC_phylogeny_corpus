Abstract
Background: Nucleolin is a major nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in various steps of
ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells. As nucleolin plays a significant role in ribosomal RNA
transcription we were interested in examining in detail the expression of nucleolin across different
stages of spermatogenesis and correlate with the transcription status of ribosomal DNA in germ
cells.
Results: By RT PCR and western blot analysis we found that nucleolin is strongly down regulated
in meiotic spermatocytes and haploid germ cells. We have identified a new nucleolin related
protein (NRP) gene in the rat genome, which is over expressed in the testis and is up regulated
several fold in meiotic spermatocytes and haploid germ cells. The NRP protein lacks the acidic
stretches in its N terminal domain, and it is encoded in rat chromosome 15 having a different
genomic organization as compared to nucleolin gene present on chromosome 9. We have also
found NRP genes encoded in genomes of other mammalian species. We performed run-on
transcription assay where we have observed that rDNA is transcribed at much lower level in
meiotic spermatocytes and haploid spermatids as compared to diploid cells. By siRNA knock down
experiments we could also demonstrate that NRP can support rDNA transcription in the absence
of nucleolin.
Conclusion: We have identified a new nucleolin variant over expressed in germ cells in rat and
analyzed its domain structure. We attribute that the transcriptional activity of rDNA genes in the
late spermatogenesis is due to the presence of this variant NRP. The expression of this variant in
the germ cells in the absence of nucleolin, could have additional functions in the mammalian
spermatogenesis which needs to be investigated further.

Background
In eukaryotic cells, the nucleolus is the site of ribosome
biogenesis, which includes transcription of ribosomal
DNA, processing of precursor rRNA and pre-ribosome
assembly [1-3]. The rate of synthesis of ribosomal RNA
varies depending upon the proliferative status of the cell

and hence is accentuated in cancer cells [4]. The ribosomal DNA (45S precursor including 18S, ETS, ITS and 28S
and 5.8S) is transcribed by RNA polymerase I and 5S
rRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III in the nucleolus. The ribosomal protein genes are transcribed by RNA
polymerase II in the nucleoplasm and after synthesis in

the cytoplasm are transported into the nucleolus for preribosome assembly. Several proteins and small nucleolar
RNAs are involved in various steps of ribosome biogenesis. Among these, nucleophosmin (B23) and Nucleolin
(C23) are the two most abundant non- ribosomal proteins whose critical functions are still being elucidated [57]. Both these proteins, especially nucleolin, also undergo
several modifications like phosphorylation [8,9] methylation [10] and ADP-ribosylation [11] for regulating their
functions.
The mammalian nucleolin is of 75–77 kDa showing an
apparent molecular mass of 100–110 kDa because of its
aberrant mobility in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The
nucleolin protein is made up of three structural domains.
The first N-terminal one third of the protein contains a
contiguous stretch of highly acidic amino acids interspersed with basic amino acids. This domain also contains several phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II
[12,13], p34cdc2 [14] and protein kinase C [15]. The central domain consists of four RNA binding domains called
RRM. It is generally believed that these four RRMs have
arisen by a duplication of the 2 RRM domains. The C-terminal domain is rich in glycine, arginine and phenylalanine residues, which is known as the GAR domain. The
function of this GAR domain is still not clear and it is
believed that this domain facilitates the interaction of
nucleolin with several other RNA binding proteins including ribosomal proteins in addition to rRNA itself [16].
Nucleolin is predominantly localized to fibrillar component around the fibrillar centers with a small proportion
also being present in the granular compartment of the
nucleolus [17]. Recently nucleolin has also been detected
on cell membranes [18]. Nucleolin can be classified under
multifunctional proteins having a variety of functions at
different steps of ribosome biogenesis. For example it has
been shown to have both stimulatory and repressive role
in rDNA transcription [19,20]. The N-terminal acidic
domain has been shown to be involved in pre-rRNA
processing [21] and histone chaperone activity [22].
Nucleolin is conserved in several species including plants
[23,24], Xenopus [25,26] and yeast [27] with a little variation in the N terminal domain, RRM motifs and in the
length of the RGG stretch at the C-terminus and they have
been termed as Nucleolin like proteins [28].
Mammalian spermatogenesis is a fascinating model of
cellular differentiation process encompassing several
rounds of mitotic division of spermatogonia, meiotic division and maturation of haploid spermatids during the
spermiogenesis process. The rate of ribosomal RNA synthesis dramatically changes during this long process of
one round of germ cell differentiation. Very early autoradiographic studies have shown that spermatogonia are
very active in rRNA synthesis, which peaks at the midpachytene level [29]. Using several cytological and immu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/64

nochemical techniques it has been shown that there is
also extensive morphological change in the nucleolar
structure during different stages of spermatogenesis [30].
Recently, a spermatogenesis specific variant of Drosophila
nucleolin, Modulo, has been described whose expression
preceeds the spermatid differentiation process [31]. Modulo also acts as a transcription factor regulating both the
meiotic arrest genes and the spermatid differentiation
genes. While analyzing the detailed expression pattern of
nucleolin during different stages of rat spermatogenesis,
we discovered a new germ cell specific nucleolin gene,
which is encoded in rat chromosome 15. The detailed
characteristics of this Nucleolin related protein (NRP) and
its role in rDNA transcription is reported in this communication.

Results
Nucleolin is down regulated in meiotic spermatocytes and
haploids
In one of our preliminary studies on the genome wide
gene expression pattern among gametic diploid, meiotic
spermatocytes and spermatid cells using UHN microarray
slides we observed that nucleolin is highly down regulated in meiotic spermatocytes and haploid spermatogenic cells (Sneha and M.R.S.Rao, unpublished data).
Nucleolin is a major non-ribosomal phosphoprotein
present in the nucleolus of a eukaryotic cell [32]. Its
expression pattern is well correlated with the Pol I mediated transcription of ribosomal RNA gene [20]. As nucleolin plays a significant role in ribosomal RNA
transcription we were interested in examining in detail the
expression of nucleolin across different stages of spermatogenesis and correlate with the transcription status of
ribosomal DNA in germ cells.

To begin with we carried out real time PCR analysis for
nucleolin messenger RNA in spermatogonial cells (2n),
meiotic spermatocytes (4n), and haploid spermatids (n).
The meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells were isolated using centrifugal elutriation technique and the relative purity of these cells as monitored by FACS analysis
were found to be 75% and 95% respectively as shown in
Figure 1A. It was evident that nucleolin was drastically
down regulated at RNA level both in meiotic spermatocytes as well as haploid germ cells (Figure 1B). The nucleolin transcript was however detected in actively dividing
gametic diploid spermatogonial cells. The absence of
nucleolin expression in meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells was further corroborated at the protein level by
carrying out western blotting analysis of total nuclear proteins probed with monoclonal anti-nucleolin antibodies
(Santa Cruz). As can be seen from Figure 1C, a band
around 110 kDa was detected in diploid germ cells but
not in meiotic spermatocytes and haploid spermatid cells.
We further confirmed the absence of nucleolin by indirect
immunoflourescence method using the monoclonal antiPage 2 of 15

nucleolin antibody. We used HeLa cells as one of the control where we observed nucleolin to be localized in the
dark nucleolar region (Figure 1D a–b) as expected. We
could also localize nucleolin in nucleolar structures in
nuclei of spermatogenic diploid cells (panel c-d). However, we could not see any nucleolin staining in both the
meiotic spermatocytes (panels e-f) and haploid germ cells
(panel g-h). Thus it was quite clear from the above observation that nucleolin, one of the major non-ribosomal
proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, was strongly
down regulated at both RNA and protein level in meiotic
as well as post meiotic germ cells.
Fibrillarin and UBF are expressed throughout
spermatogenesis
In addition to nucleolin two other proteins that are intimately involved in rDNA transcription and processing are
UBF and Fibrillarin. Fibrillarin is a 36 kDa protein that is
involved in rRNA maturation and assembly [33]. UBF is

an upstream binding factor of 108 kDa and is a major
transcription factor essential for the polymerase I dependent transcription [34]. We were curious to examine the
expression of these two proteins in the meiotic spermatocytes and spermatids cells. For this purpose we carried out
immunoflourescence assay using anti-fibrillarin and antiUBF antibodies (Santa Cruz) and the results are shown in
Figure 2. It was interesting to see that both Fibrillarin (Figure 2A) and UBF (Figure 2B) were detectable in meiotic
spermatocytes (panels e-f) as well as haploid germ cells
(panels g-h). Panels (a-b) and (c-d) show the localization
pattern of these proteins in HeLa and gametic diploid cells
respectively. In order to get a more quantitative picture of
the expression of these two proteins, we carried out real
time PCR analysis of Fibrillarin, UBF and also that of
nucleolin in these germ cells. The expression level of
Fibrillarin and UBF were reduced by approximately less
than one fold in meiotic spermatocytes and by two fold in
haploid cells as compared to gametic diploid cells while

nucleolin was strongly down regulated (Figure 2C). Above
results showed that unlike nucleolin other nucleolar proteins essential for RNA polymerase I transcription and
processing are present in the testicular germ cells irrespective of the stages of differentiation. However, a search of
the rat genome data base for fibrillarin identified a variant
of fibrillarin gene on rat chromosome 4. The expression of
this gene in testis or other somatic tissues is not known
and has to be investigated.
Transcription of rDNA in haploid spermatids
As mentioned in the introduction, Nucleolin plays a
major role in plethora of rRNA processing activities
including rDNA transcription, [35-38], we were interested
to study the rDNA transcription status in different germ
cells. For this purpose we initially carried out in vitro
nuclear run-on transcription in meiotic spermatocytes
and haploid cells using gametic diploid germ cells from
10-day-old rat as control. A run-on transcription assay was
carried out by labeling the nascent rRNA transcripts with
a32P UTP both in the presence as well as in the absence of
a-amanitin (100 mg/ml) to score specifically for Pol I
mediated transcription. The results of such an experiment
are shown in Figure 3A. The presence of run on transcripts
for ribosomal RNA (28S, 18S, ETS, and ITS) were detected
in both a-amanitin treated as well as untreated cells of 2n,
4n and n whereas transcripts of Pol II products such as b
actin and Nucleolin were detected only in the absence of
a-amanitin. In conformity with our observation made
above, nucleolin nascent transcript was observed only in
diploid cells but was absent in meiotic spermatocytes and
spermatid cells even in this run-on transcription assay. We
also examined the rate of transcription of ribosomal RNA
as calculated from the amount of radioactivity incorporated as a function of time which is graphically represented in Figure 3B. It is clear from the figure that rDNA
genes are indeed transcribed, showing a linear increase as
a function of time in all the three type of germ cells. However, it can be noticed that both the rate and the extent of
rDNA transcription in meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells are much lower than in gametic diploid cells.

In order to extend this observation further, an in situ runon transcription was carried out in meiotic spermatocytes
and spermatid cells by the incorporation of BrUTP in the
presence of a-amanitin followed by staining with monoclonal anti BrdU antibodies. Interestingly, fluorescent signal representing nascent rRNA transcripts were detected in
both meiotic spermatocytes (panel c-d) as well as in spermatid cells (panel e-f) confirming the results of in vitro
nuclear run-on transcription. As mentioned earlier UBF is
a polymerase I specific transcription factor and hence we
examined the colocalisation pattern of UBF with these
rDNA transcripts. As can be seen in Figure 3D, we did
observe the colocalisation of UBF protein with BrUTP signal, proving the authenticity of rDNA transcription that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/64

we were detecting in the meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells. Thus both the in vitro and in vivo run-on experiments proved unambiguously that rDNA transcription
does take place in the meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells where nucleolin was not detected.
A nucleolin related protein (NRP) is expressed in meiotic
and post meiotic germ cells
In the backdrop of the essentiality of nucleolin in rDNA
transcription [20], we were surprised to observe rDNA
transcription in both the meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells although at much reduced level. In all of our
experiments, described above, we had used monoclonal
antibodies against nucleolin (Santa Cruz). For curiosity
we then used polyclonal antibodies against nucleolin (a
gift from Dr. Philip Bouvet) and repeated the immunoflourescence analysis. To our surprise we did observe foci
lighted by polyclonal nucleolin antibody in both meiotic
spermatocytes and spermatid cells (Figure 4A). Subsequently we went ahead with western blot analysis of the
nuclear proteins with these polyclonal anti-nucleolin
antibodies. As can be seen in Figure 4B these antibodies
lighted up two polypeptide bands in gametic diploid cells
(2n) while only the bottom band was observed in meiotic
spermatocytes (4n) and spermatid (n) cells. The upper
band in the gametic diploid cells corresponds to 110 kDa
region and represents nucleolin, which is absent in meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells. The presence of a
lower band suggested to us the possible existence of a
nucleolin variant in the germ cells. To further verify this
possibility we amplified nucleolin mRNA from diploid
germ cells by using the ORF specific forward and reverse
primers (for primer sequences see additional file 1). The
analysis of PCR products shown in Figure 4C clearly show
that two amplicons were observed in gametic diploid cells
while only one amplicon of lower size of around 1.6 kb
was observed in meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid
cells. Each of these two bands was eluted and the DNA
sequence was determined. The sequence of the upper 2 kb
band exactly corresponded to nucleolin sequence and the
lower band of 1.6 kb corresponded to a new variant with
a sequence very similar to nucleolin which we refer here
as nucleolin related protein (NRP). The amino acid
sequence alignment of rat nucleolin and the NRP is
shown in Figure 5. The sequences are almost identical
(88%) except that the amino acid stretches (1)

gene in the rat genome database (Entrez GeneID:64556).
Since we observe the expression at protein level this gene
is now interpreted as expressed gene and has now been
named as nucleolin related protein (NRP) with Entrez
accession number: FJ817497.
For further validation, NRP gene of 3 kb and nucleolin
gene (1 kb spanning 3rd and 4th exon with an intron in
between) was amplified, gel eluted and sequenced (using
primer pairs (13) and (14) respectively as given in the
additional file 1). Both the genes were amplified from the

same genomic DNA template, thus experimentally proving the authenticity of their gene sequence present in the
database. A detailed analysis of the gene structure of this
new NRP gene resident on chromosome 15 revealed that
it consists of three exons and two introns as shown in Figure 6A as against the presence of 14 exons and 13 introns
of the nucleolin gene resident on chromosome 9. The
important features of the NRP gene in comparison with
the nucleolin gene are a) A small region of exon 1 and
complete exon 2 of nucleolin forms the exon 1 of NRP. b)
A region of exon 3 of nucleolin, 37 bp long, forms the

exon 2 of NRP. c) A portion of exon 3 of nucleolin and
complete exon 5 through 14 of nucleolin are fused in NRP
as one large 3rd exon. But the sequence spanning the
3'UTR of both the genes are identical. All together NRP
has acquired all the exons of nucleolin except the missing
sequences mentioned but no introns. The splice signal
(GU/AG) is found to be present in the exon/intron
boundary of the NRP variant as predicted in the database
except for one intron. It is predicted that the NRP has 3
introns and the 3rd intron, is supposed to be a single
nucleotide C, but we have found that C is a part of the
exon and it is present in the mRNA transcript of the variant. We have seen all the sequence characteristics of nucleolin in the variant NRP except the acidic stretch, we are
still unsure of the exact mRNA 5' and 3' nucleotide. However, the northern blot shows only a band of 1.6 kb in
length thus eliminating the possibility of the presence of
additional exons. The domain structure of nucleolin
encompasses an N-terminal domain (acidic stretch), four
RRM (RRM1, RRM2, RRM3 and RRM4) domains and Cterminal GAR domain rich in glycine and arginine as
depicted in (Figure 6A). The exon 3 of NRP together con-

stitutes both the GAR domain and the RNA binding
domains which are actually encoded by exons 5 through
14 in nucleolin. It is interesting to note that the monoclonal antibodies that we procured from Santa cruz was
raised against the long acidic stretch region which is
absent in the NRP and hence explains the inability of
detection of the NRP in our experiments using these monoclonal antibodies. In addition to the coding sequence,
we also looked into the 5' proximal promoter region of rat
nucleolin and NRP gene for possible conserved and also
divergent sequence elements by using the TF search and
promoter inspector programmes. Apart from the common
transcription factors that bind to the promoter region of
both NRP and nucleolin like HFH, SRY, CdxA, NFkB, AP1,
Oct-1, HNF-2 etc, a unique binding site for Sox 5 adjacent
to tandem repeats of SRY binding site is present in the
NRP promoter region, which is absent in the promoter
region of nucleolin. Sox 5 is reported to be a testis specific
transcription factor that acts cooperatively with SRY [39]
and therefore possibly explains the up regulation of NRP
in meiotic and post meiotic germ cells. We would also like
to point here that NRP gene is also expressed in gametic

Evolutionary relationship among mammalian nucleolin
and NRP
We then analyzed the published sequence database of
other mammalian species to see whether NRPs are also
encoded in their genome and also constructed a phylogenetic tree to understand the evolutionary relationship
among these nucleolin family members (Figure 6B). We
detected one novel NRP in the mouse genome, which is
identical to the rat NRP in addition to the regular nucleolin
gene on mouse chromosome 1. This NRP is reported as

pseudogene in the mouse genome database on chromosome 11 and chromosome 1. Sequencing of the nucleolin
and NRP amplified from RNA of mouse GC1-Spg cells
showed that the mouse NRP is almost 90% identical to rat
NRP sequence. However the nucleotide sequence did not
exactly correspond to the either of the pseudogenes of
mouse but was found to be identical to a predicted splice
variant of nucleolin mRNA itself present on chromosome
1. There is a complete absence of 3rd exon of nucleolin
mRNA in the case of mouse leading to the lack of the acidic
stretches, showing that the predicted nucleolin spice variant in mouse is actually expressed in mouse spermatogonial germ cells (data not shown). When we compared the

amino acid sequences of human NRP1 (QBQO2) and
NRP2 (Q6SZ99) on chromosome 2 with that of human
nucleolin on the same chromosome, we observed that NRP1
lacks a portion of N-terminal domain, complete RRM1
domain and a portion of RRM2 while NRP2 lacks a portion
of N-terminal domain but retains the RRM domains. The
Canis familaris genome also encodes 4 NRP genes. The
human nucleolin/NRP genes have separately evolved compared to the rodent nucleolin/NRP gene while the Canis familaris NRPs segregate separately. From above observations it
is obvious that NRPs do exist in different mammalian spe-

cies. The domain wise alignment of the nucleolin and NRP
from different species indicates that except for the acidic
stretch that is absent in the NRPs other major domains such
as RRM1–4 and the GAR domains are very well conserved
(Figure 6C)
NRP is over expressed in germ cells and localizes to
nucleolus
We were then interested to study the expression pattern of
the rat NRP gene across many other tissues. A northern
blot analysis of nucleolin and NRP was carried out in

major tissues of the rat using a Multiple Tissue Northern
blot obtained from Clonetech. nucleolin was specifically
probed using the probe that spans the 4th exon using
primer pairs (5) (see additional file 1), which is missing
in NRP. As seen from Figure 6D top panel, the nucleolin
specific signal of 2 kb was present in all the tissues including testis. A faint signal in the testis (total testicular RNA)
is due to the presence of RNA from diploid cells. Since the
sequence of NRP is very much similar to nucleolin it was
difficult to design specific primers for NRP. Therefore, a
common probe (full length nucleolin mRNA) was used
that can detect both nucleolin and NRP using primer pairs
(12) (see additional file 1) which showed the presence of
two bands in testis and 2 kb corresponding to the size of
nucleolin in other tissues (Figure 6D bottom panel).
However, a very faint signal in other tissues was also
detected. The functional significance of low level of
expression of NRP in somatic tissues and its up regulation
in meiotic and post meiotic germ cells remains to be
explored. It is quite likely that the presence of Sox 5 binding element in the promoter sequence determines the
higher level of NRP expression in testis in the absence of
nucleolin. We were curious to know whether NRP also
gets localized specifically to nucleolus. For this purpose
we cloned the rat NRP cDNA sequence in a pCMV vector
with a c-Myc epitope at its N-terminal end. After transfection in GC1-Spg cell line (derived from B type spermatogonial cells), the localization was detected by indirect
immunoflourescence assay using the monoclonal antimyc antibodies. As can be seen in Figure 6E the NRP also
specifically colocalises to nucleolus along with endogenous nucleolin probed with polyclonal anti-nucleolin
antibodies. Thus all these observations suggest that NRP is
over expressed in testis in the absence of nucleolin and it
is found to be localized in the nucleolus.
NRP supports rDNA transcription in the absence of
nucleolin
The experiment described above showed that rDNA is
transcribed in meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells
in the absence of nucleolin. One can argue that some
other proteins other than NRP may be responsible for the
rDNA transcription that we are detecting in meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells. In order to demonstrate
that NRP can support the rDNA transcription, we carried
out knock down experiment in GC1-Spg cell line (derived
from B type spermatogonial cell). We had to use these cell
lines but not the meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid
cells because the transfection technique for mammalian
germ cells is not available at present. We performed siRNA
mediated down regulation of nucleolin and NRP (smart
pool, Dharmacon) in mouse GC1-Spg and RAG-1 (Renal
adenocarcinoma) cell lines. As seen from the western blot
image (Figure 7A), a down regulation of nucleolin is seen
in a time dependent manner in RAG-1 cells which is a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/64

somatic cell line that does not express NRP. In GC1-Spg
cells siRNA mediated down regulation resulted in down
regulation of both nucleolin as well as NRP as probed by
a western blot analysis (The siRNA pools contain target
sequences spanning the entire length of nucleolin which
is also present in NRP). Further, we specifically knocked
down the expression of the nucleolin by using antisense
LNA oligos (oligo a and oligo b from Exiqon given in
additional file 1) that were designed against the fourth
exon region which is unique to nucleolin and absent in
NRP. Interestingly this down regulation resulted in
decreased intensity of nucleolin band in the western analysis whereas the intensity of the NRP band remained unaffected. This also confirms to our early observations that
the two proteins differ only in their 4th exon region. b
actin was used a loading control whose protein level
remained unchanged.
We then looked into the nucleolar morphology in siRNA
and antisense RNA transfected GC1-Spg cells. Immunoflouresence was performed using fibrillarin antibody after
60 hours of post transfection followed by Alexa conjugated secondary antibody (Figure 7). As can be seen from
the Figure 7B multiple micro nucleoli were observed in
siRNA silenced cells where both nucleolin and NRP levels
are down regulated. These observations are similar to
those reported by Ugrinova et al [40]. On the other hand
in antisense oligonucleotide treated cells (panel 2) the
nucleolar architecture remained more or less similar to
the control sets (panel 3).
We next tried to address the status of rDNA transcription
under these silenced conditions. Nuclear run-on transcription assays were carried out in both siRNA treated
cells (Figure 7C) and antisense oligonucleotide treated
GC1-Spg cells (Figure 7D). In siRNA treated cells where
both nucleolin and NRP levels are down regulated, the
rDNA transcription was also greatly reduced when compared to lipofectamine transfected control cells. b actin
remained constant both in control as well as siRNA transfected run-on experiments. Similar experiment carried out
in antisense oligonucleotide treated cells (Figure 7D)
showed that the rDNA transcription was similar to lipofectamine transfected control cells. The experiment above
thus suggests a possible role of the variant nucleolin in
rDNA transcription even in the absence of nucleolin.

Discussion
The spermiogenesis process in mammals involves extensive reorganization of nuclear morphology of haploid
spermatids generating highly condensed and transcriptionally inactive testicular spermatozoa. Transcriptional
activity of haploid spermatids is now fairly documented.
Some of the early observation based on ultra structural
studies and in situ labeling techniques have shown that

tein which is involved in various steps of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus (7).

although ribosomal RNA can be detected in round spermatids [41] there is a continuous nucleolar inactivation
during the spermiogenesis process [42]. Many protein
coding genes transcribed by RNA Pol II are stored as ribonucleoprotein particles which are subsequently activated
for translation during late stages of spermiogenesis [43].
Based on the circumstantial evidence it is generally
believed that preformed ribosomes which are passed on
from one meiotic prophase spermatocytes to haploid
round spermatids support protein synthesis of the newly
transcribed protein coding genes. However, there has
been no systematic molecular study on the status of ribosomal RNA synthesis and processing in the haploid germ
cells. The present study was initiated based on our preliminary observation that nucleolin is strongly down regulated in both meiotic spermatocytes and haploid round
spermatids. Nucleolin is a major nucleolar phosphopro-

A detailed study on the expression pattern of nucleolin
gene by real time PCR, immunofluoroscence and western
blot analysis has clearly demonstrated that nucleolin
expression is strongly reduced both in meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells. Interestingly we have discovered
the presence of a nucleolin related protein gene encoded
on rat chromosome 15 which is expressed only in testicular germ cells and is highly up regulated in meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells. The germ cell specific up
regulation of the NRP gene is probably determined by the
presence of Sox 5 binding element only in the 5' upstream
sequence of the NRP gene. Sox 5 is an important transcription factor determining the testis expression of a particular
gene [39].
Our experiment described here clearly demonstrated that
rDNA is transcribed both in meiotic spermatocytes and
spermatid cells although at 50% less compared to gametic
diploid spermatogonial cells. Based on our present understanding of the functional role of the different domains of
nucleolin we would like to interpret the findings reported
in the present communication as follows. The nucleolin
related protein (NRP) which is present in the meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells supports rDNA transcription in these cells. We confirmed this role of NRP by
carrying out knock down experiments as demonstrated in
(Figure 7). But the persistence of transcriptional activity of
rDNA in haploid spermatids although at lower level,
raises an important question on the role of this rDNA
transcriptional activity. It is quite plausible that this transcriptional activity may prevent any epigenetic modification at the rDNA locus of the germ cells during
differentiation and maturation in the testis.
Another major interesting observation we have made in
the present investigation is the genomic organization of
the NRP gene. In contrast to the nucleolin gene which has
14 exons and 13 introns, the NRP gene has only 3 exons
and 2 introns. There is a fusion of exons 5 through 14 of
nucleolin gene generating a long exon 3 in the NRP gene.
It is also interesting to note that the 3' UTR of both the
nucleolin and NRP gene is identical. A detailed bioinformatics analysis of other mammalian genomes revealed
that there are 2 additional NRP genes in addition to regular nucleolin gene in humans and 4 NRP genes in Canis
familiaris (Figure 6B). The existence of these NRPs in other
mammalian species as well, suggests that they might have
evolved to attain new functions that needs to be explored
further. The loss of N terminal acidic stretch the rat NRP
might have a unique function in terms of its interacting
partners compared to somatic nucleolin. The roles of
these additional NRP genes present in these other mammalian species in the rDNA transcription needs to be

BMC Molecular Biology 2009, 10:64

investigated further to understand the functional significance of NRPs.
In addition to possible role(s) of the NRPs in ribosome
biogenesis, it is quite likely that they may have completely
different biological roles which need to be discovered.
Thus our observations suggest that, other than supporting
some functions of nucleolin, this variant may have a more
specific role in meiotic prophase spermatocytes and haploid germ cells like Modulo, a Drosophila homologue of
nucleolin [31]. They have shown that a testis specific variant of Modulo regulates the expression of meiotic arrest
genes and is essential for transcription of spermatid differentiation genes. Surprisingly, we do find that the NRP
gene is upregulated by several fold both in the meiotic
spermatocytes and spermatid cells as compared to
gametic diploid cells. Therefore it remains to be seen
whether the mammalian nucleolin variant, NRP which is
dramatically up regulated post meiosis, in the absence of
nucleolin has a similar role as that of testis specific Modulo
of Drosophila regulating expression of a set of genes during
spermatogenesis. Further experiments are underway in
this direction.

Conclusion
In this report we identified a new variant of nucleolin
(NRP) in testicular germ cells. We found that nucleolin is
down regulated during spermatogenesis and this new variant has the potential to support rDNA transcription. We
expect that these findings will be useful to better understand not only the existing variants of nucleolin in different cell types but also for exploring the functional
significance of this new variant during spermatogenesis
other than rDNA transcription.

turer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized from RNA of 10
day old rat testis, meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid
cells using 2 mg of RNA (denatured and snap chilled),
oligo (dT) 23 primer (Sigma), RT-buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol], dNTPs (1 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP and dCTP)
and 200 U of AMV Reverse transcriptase (NEB) according
to the method as described in [45]. An aliquot of the RTproduct was used for realtime PCR analysis of various
genes using specific forward and reverse primers (given in
additional file 1). Expression of Naca 1 gene was used as
a normalizing control.
DNA sequence analysis
PCR amplification of full-length nucleolin from total testicular cDNA using specific 5' and 3' end primers generated two amplicons. Bands were gel eluted using Qiagen
gel elution kit, sequenced by ABI Prism 3100 sequencer
and analyzed. Similarly gene sequence (3 kb including the
500 bp upstream of 5'UTR) of NRP was also amplified
and sequenced.
Evolutionary analysis using bioinformatic tools
The gene sequence and the mRNA sequence of NRP was
analyzed for its conservation across Mouse and Rat using
NCBI and Ensemble database. BLAST search was used for
curating the sequences similar to NRP across the species.
Clustal W was used for the alignment of sequences similar
to NRP in different species for generating the dendrogram
and studying the phylogenetic relationship. Proximal promoter region and the regulatory elements of both the
nucleolin and NRP were analyzed using software Promoter

Methods
Preparation of testicular cells, RNA isolation and Real
time PCR
Diploids, meiotic spermatocytes and spermatid cells were
isolated from the total testicular cells by the method of
centrifugal elutriation as described previously by [44]
using the elutriation rotor (JE 5.0) in a Beckman coulter
centrifuge (Avanti J20-XP1). The collected cells were
washed with 1× DPBS (Dulbecco's phosphate buffer
saline). Aliquots of cellular fractions were fixed in 70%
ice-cold ethanol for analysis by FACS. Cells for FACS analysis were stained using staining buffer containing (EtBr 25
mg/ml, 0.3%NP40 and 50 mg/ml of RNase A). After incubation at 37°C for 45 minutes, the purity of fraction was
assessed using FACS (BD FACS calibur). Testicular cells
from 10 day old rats were used as a source of gametic diploid cells.

RNA was isolated from diploid, meiotic spermatocytes
and spermatid cells by the TRIzol reagent as per manufac-

Northern blot analysis
Northern blot was carried out using the MTN blot (Clontech) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Amplified full
length PCR product of nucleolin as well as a specific portion (spanning the acidic stretch of the N-terminal region)
of nucleolin was used for probe generation by Klenow
labelling with a32P dATP along with random primers.
Blots after washes were finally exposed to phosphor
imager.
Immunolocalisation and Immunoblotting of proteins
Total testicular cell smears were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 minutes followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Bovine serum
albumin (1%) in PBS was used for blocking. Mouse monoclonal anti-nucleolin, rabbit polyclonal anti-UBF, goat
polyclonal anti-fibrillarin (SantaCruz) were used for the
detection of nucleolin, UBF and fibrillarin respectively.
Colocalisation experiments were carried out by sequen-

tially incubating the slides with each of the antibodies of
nucleolin (rabbit polyclonal) or c-Myc (mouse monoclonal), BrUTP (mouse monoclonal) or UBF (rabbit polyclonal). Corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated
with Alexa fluor dyes were used in each of the above
experiments. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma).
Images were acquired in a Ziess confocal laser scanning
(LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss).
For western blot analysis, nuclear or cell lysates were
resolved in SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blocking was carried out
using 5% skim milk powder in PBS followed by incubating with the appropriate primary antibody for 1 hour. The
blot, after the washes was subsequently incubated with
corresponding secondary antibody conjugated to HRP for
1 hour. The membrane was then washed and after the
addition of substrate, chemiluminescence was captured
by autoradiography.
Nuclear run-on transcription and In situ run on
transcription
In vitro nuclear run on transcription was carried out
according to the method described [46] with minor modifications. Nuclei were isolated from the elutriated cells as
described earlier. The elutriated cell pellet was treated
with lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2,
10 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40) and incubated on ice for 15
minutes. The mixture was centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at 1000 g. The supernatant was discarded and the
nuclear pellet was resuspended in 120 ml glycerol buffer
(50 mM Tirs-HCl pH 8.3, 5 mM MgCl2, 40% glycerol)
and was mixed with equal volumes of 2× reaction buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 1
mM each of GTP, ATP, CTP and 80 mCi [m32P]UTP, 1 mM
DTT, 100 units of RNasin and 100 mg/ml of a-amanitin)
the reaction was carried out for 30 minutes at 30°C. RNA
was then isolated by using TRIzol reagent.

Dot blot for the run on transcription assay was prepared
by blotting 800 ng of precipitated PCR amplicon products
of 18S, 28S, ETS, ITS, Nucleolin and bActin were amplified using specific primer pairs (1–6) respectively (see
additional file 1). The membrane was then dried and
cross-linked under UV. The prehybridisation buffer (5×
Denhardt's reagent, 6× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml salmon
sperm DNA, and 50% formamide) was added to the
membrane and incubated at 42°C for 1–2 hours. The
labelled transcribed RNA was hybridized for 48 hours at
42°C, followed by washing twice in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS for
15 minutes, once in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes,
and once in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes. The blot
was then exposed to phosphor imager. The radioactivity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/64

incorporated in the blots was calculated densitometrically
using Fugi image analysis software.
For in situ run-on transcription cells were resuspended in
TBS (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM TrisCl (7.4), 5 mM MgCl2
containing 0.5% BSA), were washed twice with TBS and
glycerol buffer (20 mM TrisCl (7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 25%
glycerol, 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM EGTA) and permeabilised in glycerol buffer containing 0.05% TritonX-100 for
5–10 minutes at room temperature. Permeabilized cells
were washed once in TBS and run on transcription was
performed in transcription buffer (100 mM KCl, 50 mM
TrisCl (7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 25% glycerol, 5
U/ml RNasin, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM ATP, GTP, CTP, 0.5 mM
BrUTP and 100 mg/ml of a-amanitin) for 30 minutes at
37°C. TCA and BSA was used to stop the reaction after 30
minutes and kept on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then
pelleted down and smears were made on microscope
slides and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were again
permeabilised with 0.1% TritonX-100 for 5–10 minutes.
Smears were then blocked with 1% BSA for 45 minutes.
Appropriate dilution of anti-BrdU antibody (Santa Cruz)
was used as the primary antibody followed by incubation
with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 568 for 1
hour at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI
(1 mg/ml).
Cell culture and transfections
GC1 Spg cells derived from B type spermatogonial cells,
obtained from ATCC were cultured in DMEM (Sigma)
supplemented with 10% FBS and appropriate antibiotics
were used for all cellular assays. Cells were plated to 70%
confluence at the time of transfection. Transfection was
carried out using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per
manufactures protocol with plasmid construct (NRP
cloned in pCMV MYC vector). Cells were harvested at 48
or 60 hours post transfection and Immunoflourescence
was carried out as described previously. Nucleolin smart
pool siRNA was obtained from Dharmacon. GC1-Spg
cells were cultured in 6 well plate and transfection was carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleolin downregulated cells after transfection were then used
for further experiments. Specific down regulation of
nucleolin was carried out using antisense oligo's (oligo a
(aacttcttcctcagagtcatcttc) and oligo b (cctcctcctcggccacactcttgg) spanning the exon 4 of nucleolin). Immunolocalisation and run on experiments were carried out
after 60 hrs of transfection for the functional assays.
