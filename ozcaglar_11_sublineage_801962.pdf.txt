Abstract
Background: Strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) can be classified into major lineages based on
their genotype. Further subdivision of major lineages into sublineages requires multiple biomarkers along with
methods to combine and analyze multiple sources of information in one unsupervised learning model. Typically,
spacer oligonucleotide type (spoligotype) and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) are used for TB
genotyping and surveillance. Here, we examine the sublineage structure of MTBC strains with multiple biomarkers
simultaneously, by employing a tensor clustering framework (TCF) on multiple-biomarker tensors.
Results: Simultaneous analysis of the spoligotype and MIRU type of strains using TCF on multiple-biomarker
tensors leads to coherent sublineages of major lineages with clear and distinctive spoligotype and MIRU signatures.
Comparison of tensor sublineages with SpolDB4 families either supports tensor sublineages, or suggests
subdivision or merging of SpolDB4 families. High prediction accuracy of major lineage classification with supervised
tensor learning on multiple-biomarker tensors validates our unsupervised analysis of sublineages on multiplebiomarker tensors.
Conclusions: TCF on multiple-biomarker tensors achieves simultaneous analysis of multiple biomarkers and
suggest a new putative sublineage structure for each major lineage. Analysis of multiple-biomarker tensors gives
insight into the sublineage structure of MTBC at the genomic level.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), is a leading
cause of death worldwide. In the United States, isolates
from all TB patients are routinely genotyped by multiple
biomarkers. The biomarkers include Spacer Oligonucleotide Types (spoligotypes), Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units - Variable Number Tandem
Repeats (MIRU-VNTR), IS6110 Restriction Fragment
Length Polymorphisms (RFLP), Long Sequence Polymorphisms (LSPs), and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).

Genotyping of MTBC is used to identify and distinguish MTBC into distinct lineages and/or sublineages
that are quite useful for TB tracking, TB control, and
examining host-pathogen relationships [1]. The six main
major lineages of MTBC are M. africanum, M. bovis, M.
tuberculosis subgroup Indo-Oceanic, M. tuberculosis
subgroup Euro-American, M. tuberculosis subgroup East
Asian (Beijing) and M. tuberculosis subgroup EastAfrican Indian (CAS). Other major lineages exist such
as M. canettii and M. microti, but they do not commonly occur in the US, so we do not consider them
here. These major lineages can be definitively characterized using LSPs [2], but typically only spoligotypes and
MIRU are collected for the purpose of TB surveillance.
Classification, similarity search, and expert-rule based
methods have been developed to correctly map isolates

genotyped using MIRU and/or spoligotypes to the major
lineages [3-5].
While sublineages of MTBC are routinely used in the
TB literature, their exact definitions, names, and numbers have not been clearly established. The SpolDB4
database contains 39,295 strains and their spoligotypes
with the vast majority of them labeled and classified
into 62 sublineages [6], but many of these are considered to be “potentially phylogeographically-specific
MTBC genotype families”, rather than distinct phylogenetic sublineages with known biomarkers. Therefore,
further analysis is needed to confirm these sublineages.
The highly-curated MIRU-VNTRplus website, which
focuses primarily on MIRU, defines 22 sublineages.
New definitions of sublineages based on LSPs and
SNPs are being discovered; e.g. the RD724 polymorphism corresponds to the previously defined SpolDB4 T2
sublineage, also known as the Uganda strain in MIRUVNTRplus[7]. Now large databases using spoligotype,
MIRU patterns, and RFLP exist. The United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
gathered spoligotypes and MIRU isolates for over
37,000 patients. Well-defined TB sublineages based on
spoligotype and MIRU are critical for both TB control
and TB research.
The goal of this paper is to examine the sublineage
structure of MTBC on the basis of multiple biomarkers.
The proposed method reveals structure not captured in
SpolDB4 spoligotype families because SpolDB4 sublineage only take into account a single biomarker, spoligotypes. A spoligotype-only tool, SPOTCLUST, was used
to find MTBC sublineages using an unsupervised probabilistic model, reflecting spoligotype evolution [8]. A
key issue is to combine spoligotype and MIRU into a
single unsupervised learning model. When MIRU patterns are considered, SpolDB4 families that are well-supported by spoligotype signatures may become
ambiguous, or allow subdivision/merging of the families.
Existing phylogenetic methods can be readily applied to
MIRU patterns, but specialized methods are needed to
accurately capture how spoligotypes evolve. It is not
known how to best combine spoligotype and MIRU patterns to infer a phylogeny. The online tool www.MIRUVNTRplus.org determines lineages by using similarity
search to a labeled database. The user must select the
distance measure which is defined using spoligotypes
and/or MIRU patterns, possibly yielding different results.
In this study, we develop a tensor clustering framework to find the sublineage structure of MTBC strains
labeled by major lineages based on multiple biomarkers.
This is an unsupervised learning problem. We generate
multiple-biomarker tensors of MTBC strains for each
major lineage and apply multiway models for dimensionality reduction. The model accurately captures

spoligotype evolutionary dynamics using contiguous
deletions of spacers. The tensor transforms spoligotypes
and MIRU into a new representation, where traditional
clustering methods apply without users having to decide
a priori how to combine spoligotype and MIRU patterns. Strains are clustered based on the transformed
data without using any information from SpolDB4
families. Clustering results lead to the subdivision of
major lineages of MTBC into groups with clear and distinguishable spoligotype and MIRU signatures. Comparison of the tensor sublineages with SpolDB4 families
suggests dividing or merging some SpolDB4 families. As
a way of validating multiple-biomarker tensors, we use
them in a supervised learning model to predict major
lineages using spoligotype deletions and MIRU. We
compare the prediction accuracy of the multiple-biomarker tensor model created with N-PLS (N-way partial
least squares) with the 2-way PLS applied to matrix data
and an existing conformal Bayesian Network approach.
In the next section, we give a brief background on
clustering and multiway analysis of post-genomic data,
spoligotyping, and MIRU typing.
Clustering post-genomic data

Data clustering is a class of techniques for unsupervised
classification of data samples into groups of similar
behavior, function, or trait [9]. Clustering can be used in
post-genomic data analysis to group strains with similar
traits. It is common practice to use different clustering
methods and use a priori biological knowledge to interpret the clusters, but computational cluster validation is
needed to validate results without prior knowledge for
unsupervised classification. A great survey by Handl et
al. outlines the steps of computational cluster analysis
on post-genomic data [10]. An application of computational cluster validation on microarray data by Giancarlo
et al. compares the results of clusterings using various
cluster validation indices [11]. Eisen et al. clusters gene
expression data which groups genes of similar functions
[12]. Improved clustering techniques have been developed, but how to combine multiple sources of information in one clustering is an open question.
Application of multiway models to post-genomic
data clustering

Clustering on post-genomic data can be accomplished
based on multiple sources of ground truth. The ground
truth can be based on multiple biomarkers, host and
pathogen, or antigen and antibody. A survey by Kriegel
et al. outlines the methods for finding clusters in highdimensional data [13]. Analysis of multiway arrays for
data mining is frequently used today in various fields,
including bioinformatics, to use multiple sources of
prior information simultaneously [14]. Alter and Golub

use higher-order eigenvalue decomposition on a networks × genes × genes tensor and find significant subnetworks associated with independent pathways in a
genome-scale network of relations among all genes of
cellular systems [15]. Omberg et al. use higher-order
singular value decomposition on DNA microarray data,
obtaining the core tensor of eigenarrays × x-eigengenes
× y-eigengenes and finding correlation between genomes
in the subtensors of the core tensor [16]. Multiway analysis of EEG data identifies epileptic seizures [17]. Use
of common partitive and hierarchical clustering algorithms accompanied with multiway modeling of highdimensional data finds functionally related genes in
stem cells [18]. Similarly, multiple biomarkers of the
MTBC genome can be used to cluster MTBC strains.
Spoligotyping

Spoligotyping is a DNA fingerprinting method that
exploits the polymorphisms in the direct repeat (DR)
region of the MTBC genome. The DR region is a polymorphic locus in the genome of MTBC which consists
of direct repeats (36 bp), separated by unique spacer
sequences of 36 to 41 bp [19]. The method uses 43
spacers, thus a spoligotype is typically represented by a
43-bit binary sequence. Zeros and ones in the sequence
correspond to the absence and presence of spacers
respectively. Mutations in the DR region involve deletion of one or more contiguous spacers. To capture this
mechanism of mutation in our model, we find informative contiguous spacer deletions and represent spoligotype deletions as a binary vector, where one indicates
that a specific contiguous deletion occurs (i.e. a specified
contiguous set of spacers are all absent) and zero means
at least one spacer is present in that contiguous set of
spacers.
Large datasets of MTBC strains genotyped by spoligotype have been amassed such as SpolDB4 [6] and a
more extended online version SITVIT (http://www.pasteur-guadeloupe.fr:8081/SITVITDemo/index.jsp). Spoligotypes can be readily used to identify commonly
accepted major lineages of MTBC with high accuracy
[4]. SpolDB4 defined a set of phylogeographic sublineages or families based on expert derived rules that are
in common use in the TB community. In contrast to
the major lineages that have been validated by more
definitive markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms and long sequence polymorphism, the exact definition of MTBC sublineages and the accuracy of the
SpolDB4 families created only using spoligotypes remain
open questions.
MIRU-VNTR typing

MIRU is a homologous 46-100 bp DNA sequence dispersed within intergenic regions of MTBC, often as

Page 3 of 26

tandem repeats. MIRU-VNTR typing is based on the
number of tandem repeats of MIRUs at certain identified loci. Among these 41 identified mini-satellite
regions on the MTBC genome, different subsets of sizes
12, 15, and 24 are proposed for the standardization of
MIRU-VNTR typing [3]. In this study, we use 12 MIRU
loci for genotyping MTBC. Thus, the MIRU pattern is
represented as a vector of length 12, each entry representing the number of repeats in each MIRU locus.

Results
We used the tensor clustering framework to cluster
MTBC strains using multiple biomarkers, and compared
the clustering to SpolDB4 sublineages. Next, we used
supervised tensor learning and classified MTBC strains
into major lineages using spoligoype deletions and
MIRU patterns. We compared multiway and two-way
supervised learning methods based on their prediction
accuracy for major lineage classification. In the following
section, we introduce multiple-biomarker tensors and
present unsupervised and supervised learning experiments on multiple-biomarker tensors.
Multiple-biomarker tensor analysis of strain data

Multiple biomarkers of the MTBC genome in a relational database can be represented as a high-dimensional dataset for multiway analysis. The multiplebiomarker tensor is constructed this way, with one of
the modes representing strains and other modes representing biomarkers. In our experiments, we use this
multidimensional array or tensor with three modes
representing strains, spoligotype deletions, and MIRU
patterns. This multiple-biomarker tensor captures three
key properties of MTBC strains: spoligotype deletions,
number of repeats in MIRU loci, and coexistence of
spoligotype deletions with MIRU loci.
The strain dataset is arranged as a three-way array
with strains in the first mode, spoligotype deletions in
the second mode, and MIRU patterns in the third
mode. Each entry X(i, j, k) in the tensor corresponds to
the number of repeats in MIRU locus k of strain i with
spoligotype deletion j. If spoligotype deletion j does not
exist in strain i, then the tensor entry X(i,j,.) is 0. Thus,
strain datasets are formed as Strains × Spoligotype deletions × MIRU patterns tensors, as shown in Figure 1.
Mathematically, each strain is represented as the outer
product of the binary spoligotype deletion vector and
the MIRU pattern vector, which results in a biomarker
kernel matrix. Biomarker kernel matrices of the same
size for each strain form the multiple-biomarker tensor.
Generation of the multiple-biomarker tensor from
biomarkers of each strain is shown in Figure 2. We
represent spoligotype deletions with a binary vector ,
where s i Î {0,1}, i Î {1,‥,n}, and n is the number of

informative spoligotype deletions found using the feature selection algorithm, detailed in the methods section. We represent 12-loci MIRU with a digit vector ,
where mj Î {1,‥,9, > 9} and j Î {1,‥,12}. The entries of
the multiple-biomarker tensor which combines spoligotype and MIRU information can be formulated as:

where

 ij = ⎨
⎩ 1, if spoligotype deletion j occurs in strain i.

and rik is the number of repeats in MIRU locus k of
strain i. Multiple-biomarker tensors can be used for
both unsupervised and supervised learning. Next, we use

the unsupervised tensor clustering framework on multiple-biomarker tensors to subdivide major lineages of
MTBC into sublineages.
Subdivision of major lineages into sublineages

We subdivide each major lineage of MTBC into sublineages using multiple-biomarker tensors. For each
major lineage, we generated the multiple-biomarker tensor using spoligotypes and MIRU types and applied
multiway models to identify putative sublineages of each
major lineage. Two multiway analysis methods were
used: PARAFAC and Tucker3. Details of the methods
and how the model parameters or components were
selected can be found in the methods section. The validated multiway models with numbers of components
for each major lineage are shown in Table 1. To evaluate the resulting clusters, we compared them to the
published SpolDB4 families for each major lineage. The
results are summarized in Table 2. We used the F-measure to measure how well the tensor sublineages match
the SpolDB4 families with 1 indicating an exact match
and 0 indicating no match. The average best-match stability is used to assess certainty of tensor sublineages
respectively with 1 indicating highly stable clusters. For
each major lineage, results show that the tensor analysis
finds highly stable sublineages (the best-match stability
is ≥84%) and that the number of sublineages found
using tensors is close but not always identical to the
number of SpolDB4 families.
The F-measure values range from 53% to 88% indicating that the sublineages found by the tensors only partially overlap with those of SpolDB4. Recall that the
SpolDB4 families were created by expert analysis using
only spoligotypes and that analysis by alternative biomarkers such as SNP and LSP has led to alternative
definitions of MTBC sublineages. The tensor sublineages
are based on spoligotype and MIRU patterns, thus in
some cases the tensor divides SpolDB4 families due to
difference in MIRU patterns even if the spoligotypes
match. In other cases, the tensor analysis merges the
SpolDB4 families because the collective spoligotypes and

MIRU patterns are very close. In some cases, the tensor
analysis almost exactly reproduces a SpolDB4 family
providing strong support for the existence of these
families with no expert guidance. In addition, the MIRU
patterns provide additional evidence for the existence of
these distinct sublineages. Thus, multiway analysis of
MTBC strains of each major lineage with multiple biomarkers leads to new sublineages and reaffirms existing
ones. Further insight can be obtained by examining the
putative sublineages for each major lineage, which is
detailed next.
Sublineage structure of M. africanum The most
stable clusters were produced using PARAFAC and it
constructed four putative sublineages of M. africanum,
denoted MA1 to MA4. Table 3 gives the stability of
each sublineage and the correspondence between the
tensor sublineages and the SpolDB4 families. These four
putative sublineages are quite distinct as shown by the
stability of 1 for each sublineage and the clear separation of the four sublineages in the PCA plot in Figure 3.
Figure 4 shows heat maps representing the spoligotype
and MIRU signatures for each tensor sublineage, with
white indicating 0 probability and black indicating probability of 1.
The tensor sublineages strongly support the existence
of the SpolDB4 AFRI_1, AFRI_2 and AFRI_3 families
and show that the AFRI family is composed of these
three families. With an F-measure of 66%, the tensor
sublineages differ markedly from the SpolDB4 families
for the M. africanum lineage. The AFRI family results
largely explain this difference – AFRI is spread across
three tensor sublineages. Disregarding AFRI, sublineages
MA2 and MA3 match families AFRI_2 and AFRI_3
respectively. Interestingly, AFRI_1 is further subdivided
into sublineages MA1 and MA4. The spoligotypes in
MA1 and MA4 differ by only one contiguous deletion
of spacers 22 through 24, but their MIRU signatures
clearly distinguish them especially in MIRU loci 10, 16
and 40. The tensor indicates that the AFRI sublineage
classification defines somewhat generic M. africanum

strains that can be distinctly placed in the groups MA1
(part of AFRI_1), MA4 (other part of AFRI_1), MA2
(AFRI_2) and MA3 (AFRI_3).
The MIRU-VNTRplus labels, determined on the basis
of LSPs, indicate that there are two sublineages, West
African 1 and West African 2, within M. africanum.
Table 4 indicates the correspondence between the tensor sublineages and MIRU-VNTRplus labels. MA1 and
MA4 correspond to West African 2 and MA2 corresponds to West African 1. There is no data labeled by
MIRU-VNTRplus in MA3, but we speculate that it is
West African 1 since MA2 and MA3 have more closely
related MIRU and spoligotype signatures.
Sublineage structure of M. bovis PARAFAC generated the most stable clusters and constructed 3 sublineages for M. bovis, MB1, MB2, and MB3, while the dataset contains 5 SpolDB4 families, BOV, BOVIS1,
BOVIS1_BCG, BOVIS2, and BOVIS3. Table 5 gives the
correspondence between the tensor sublineages and the
SpolDB4 families. All clusters have perfect stability and
are well distinguished in the PCA plot in Figure 5.
Figure 6 shows heat maps representing the spoligotype
and MIRU type signatures of tensor sublineages. Much
like the M. africanum SpolDB4 AFRI family, the BOV
family defines a generic M. bovis sublineage that spreads
across all three tensor sublineages. Disregarding BOV,
MB3 consists of all of BOVIS1 and BOVIS1_BCG

strains. Since BOVIS1_BCG is the attenuated bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine strain, it is difficult to
distinguish it from BOVIS1 using only MIRU patterns
and spoligotypes. Therefore, the merger of BOVIS1 and
BOVIS1 BCG is expected given the genetic similarity
between the two groups of strains. Disregarding BOV,
the MB1 and MB2 sublineages exactly match the
SpolDB4 families BOVIS2 and BOVIS3 respectively.
Sublineage structure of East Asian (Beijing) The
most stable clusters are produced by Tucker3 and it
constructs six distinct sublineages of East Asian (Beijing), denoted B1 through B6. The variability in the spoligotypes of East Asian is limited to spacers 35 through
43 since all East Asian strains have spacers 1 to 34
absent. Since the SpolDB4 classification is based only on
spoligotypes, the limited variability allows only two
families, BEIJING and BEIJING-LIKE. Table 6 shows the
correspondence between tensor sublin-eages and the
SpolDB4 families. The clustering plot of tensor
sublineages is shown in Figure 7. Heat maps representing the spoligotype and MIRU type signatures of tensor
sublineages are shown in Figure 8. The tensor cleanly
subdivides BEIJING into three sublineages B1, B4 and
B6, all with stability 1. Spoligotype signatures of these
sublineages differ. B1 strains have spacers 35 through 43
present, whereas B4 strains lack spacer 37, and B6
strains lack spacer 40. MIRU signature of sublineage B4
is clearly distinct in MIRU locus 40, having 3 repeats for
most strains. The tensor subdivides the BEIJING-LIKE
into sublineages B2, B3 and B5, each with distinct spoligotype signature. They all lack spacers 35 through 36.
In addition, B2 strains lack spacer 37, and B3 strains
lack spacer 40. Thus, the tensor strongly supports the
existence of BEIJING and BEIJING-LIKE families, but
also suggests that they can be further subdivided.
Sublineage structure of East-African Indian (CAS)
Tucker3 generated the most stable clusters and it constructed four distinct sublineages for East-African Indian
(also known as CAS) denoted C1, C2, C3, and C4. The
strains are also labeled with four SpolDB4 lineages:
CAS, CAS1_DELHI, CAS1_KILI and CAS2. Table 7
shows the correspondence of tensor sublineages and

SpolDB4 families. Figure 9 shows the clustering plot of
tensor sublineages and Figure 10 shows spoligotype and
MIRU type signatures of tensor sublineages. All sublineages are highly stable with stability 1. Much like with
AFRI and BOV, the generic CAS family is divided across
all tensor sublineages. C3 only contains CAS strains.
Disregarding CAS, C1 contains most CAS1 DELHI
strains and all CAS2 strains. C4 contains all CAS1_KILI
strains. C2 contains 2 CAS1_DELHI strains, but the vast
majority (331 strains) of CAS1_DELHI strains fall in C1.
In addition to the common deletions of East-African
Indian (CAS) strains, C2 strains lack spacer 22, C3
strains lack spacers 20 through 22, and C4 strains lack
spacers 20 through 22 and spacer 35. Variabilities in
MIRU loci 10, 26, 31 and 40 are also key to defining differences in the sublineages. C2 and C3 strains differ by

variations in MIRU locus 10. C4 strains which include
all CAS1_KILI strains exhibit a very distinct MIRU signature compared to other tensor sublineages, especially
in MIRU locus 26.
Sublineage structure of Indo-Oceanic PARAFAC
found the most stable clusters and it constructs nine
distinct putative sublineages for Indo-Oceanic, denoted
IO1 to IO9, while the dataset has thirteen SpolDB4
lineages. Table 8 shows the correspondence of tensor
sublineages and SpolDB4 families. Figure 11 shows the
clustering plot of tensor sublineages and Figure 12
shows spoligotype and MIRU signatures of tensor sublineages. The EAI5 family acts much like the CAS, BOV,
and AFRI families, spreading across all the Indo-Oceanic
sublineages except IO4. The small MANU1 family also
spreads across four sublineages. The existence of the

supported by the tensor analysis. They may represent a
more generic sublineage that is further subdivided. Distinct patterns are observable in the spoligotype and
MIRU signatures for most of the tensor sublineages.

Strains belonging to families H2, H37Rv, LAM12_MAD1, T1 (Tuscany variant), T1_RUS2, T4, T5_MAD2,

the T1 family, an ancestor strain family, is distributed
across 25 tensor sublin-eages, with most T1 strains in

suggest either subdivision or merging of SpolDB4
families. For instance, tensor sublineages E2, E6, and
E32 include T1 strains only. In addition to common

which are all variations in spoligotype signatures of T1
strains. This sublineage classification further subdivides
the poorly-defined ancestor T1 family. Strains of LAM
families on the other hand are grouped in 17 tensor
sublineages. Prior studies have found that LAM Rio
strains identified by SNPs are found in multiple
SpolDB4 lineages [20]. Therefore, it is expected that the
use of multiple biomarkers leads to subdivision or merging of some SpolDB4 families.
Although most stable clusters of the Euro-American
strain dataset are found using best-match stability, the
DD-weighted gap statistic plot has multiple peaks. DDweighted gap statistic, detailed in the methods section,
is a cluster validity measure which is also used for
detecting hierarchical structure in the datasets. Multiple peaks in DD-weighted gap statistic plot suggest
that the Euro-American dataset may have a multilevel
hierarchical structure. Model order selection with randomized maps by Bertoni and Valentini can be used to
detect the hierarchical structure in the Euro-American
dataset [21].
We used the unsupervised tensor clustering framework to cluster MTBC strains of major lineages into
sublineages. Next, we turn our attention to supervised
tensor learning methods on multiple-biomarker tensors
to classify strains into major lineages.
Classification of MTBC strains into major lineages using
two-way and multiway supervised learning

Multiple-biomarker tensors can be used in supervised
classification models as well as in unsupervised models.

Six putative tensor sublineages, B1 to B6, are clearly distinct.

We use multiway partial least squares (N-PLS) on multiple-biomarker tensors to predict major MTBC
lineages [22]. In our experiments, we used spoligotype
and MIRU as biomarkers and predicted the six major
lineages using the same data as for the above unsupervised learning experiments combined into a single
dataset. More specifically, we used 12 spoligotype deletions found informative in major lineage classification
combined with 12-loci MIRU [23]. We predicted major
lineages with the N-PLS multiway method and compared it with standard two-way PLS and prior results
for conformal Bayesian Networks [4]. Table 9 shows
the average testing F-measure as estimated by 5-fold
cross-validation. We generate the multiple-biomarker
tensor using 12 spoligotype deletions and 12-loci
MIRU with one additional bit indicating whether the
at least one MIRU pattern includes letter rather than

number of repeats, and create a predictive model using
the N-PLS multiway method. The model for standard
2-way PLS is created by representing the data as a
matrix with columns corresponding to 12 spoligotype
deletions and 12-loci MIRU with the additional indicator bit, and rows corresponding to MTBC strains. The
number of latent variables for both N-PLS and PLS are
selected by inner 4-fold cross-validation of the training
set data only.
We compare N-PLS, standard PLS and Conformal
Bayes Network (CBN) methods by F-measure of major
lineage classification and see that they are accurate predictive models with no significant difference between
the approaches. Table 9 shows the F-measure values for
N-PLS, standard PLS and CBN. The average F-measure
of major lineage prediction on the same data using the
CBN is 0.9897 [4]. This shows that N-PLS and standard

Conclusions
This study investigates multiple-biomarker tensors and
illustrates how they can be used for both unsupervised
and supervised learning models. First, a novel clustering
framework is used to analyze the sublineage structure of
MTBC strains based on multiple biomarkers. We generated multiple-biomarker tensors to represent multiple
biomarkers of the MTBC genome and used multiway
models for dimensionality reduction. The multiway
representation determines a transformation of the data
that captures similarities and differences between strains
based on two distinct biomarkers. We clustered MTBC
strains based on the transformed data using improved
k-means clustering and validated clustering results. We
evaluated the sublineage structure of major lineages of
MTBC and found similarities and clear distinctions in
our subdivision of major lineages compared to
the SpolDB4 classification. Simultaneous analysis of

spoligotype and MIRU through multiple-biomarker tensors and clustering of MTBC strains leads to coherent
sublineages within major lineages with clear and distinctive spoligotype and MIRU signatures. Second, we
demonstrated how the multiple-biomarker tensor can be
used to predict major lineages with extremely high accuracy competitive with other approaches. We show that
3-way PLS, 2-way PLS and CBN models are accurate
major lineage predictors for MTBC strains.
The tensor clustering framework is flexible and can be
applied to any multidimensional strain data. The design
of the resulting tensor depends on the question to be
answered. In this study, multiple-biomarker tensors are
designed to find groups of MTBC strains. Thus, the
application of the tensor clustering framework on multiple-biomarker tensors leads to sublineages of MTBC

within major lineages. The multiple-biomarker tensor is
further validated by the fact that it can used to predict
known major lineages with high accuracy using N-PLS.
N-PLS with multiple-biomarker tensors can be used for
semi-supervised learning as well. This can be useful for
learning predictive models for sublineages in which only
part of the data is labeled with sublineages and the
other part of the data has no labels. This may result in
more reliable and accurate classifiers of MTBC sublineages, and the resulting sublineage classifiers would be
a significant enhancement to TB control, epidemiology
and research. We leave this to future work.
The tensor clustering framework used in this study
can be further extended to find subgroups of MTBC
strains based on other biomarkers such as RFLP and
SNPs. 15-loci MIRU and 24-loci MIRU patterns can

also be used to represent MTBC genomes with
multiple-biomarker tensors. Moreover, more than two
biomarkers can be used in the MTBC genome representation. But, ambiguity in the tensor entries is an open
question that needs to be solved in the tensor representation when more than two biomarkers are used. Addition of new biomarkers will increase the number of
modes of the multiple-biomarker tensor, but the multiway analysis methods will remain the same.
Other questions of interest can be addressed by
designing and analyzing host-pathogen tensors to

examine the relationship of the pathogen genotype
with host (or equivalent) attributes to examine
questions of interest. For example, since the MTBC
sublineages are known to be highly geographically
dependent, a tensor which combines the pathogen genotype with the country of birth of the host may reveal
additional sublineage structure and transmission patterns. A tensor combining MTBC genotype and host
disease phenotype such as site of infection and drug
resistance could be used to analyze MTBC genotype/
phenotype relations.

Clustering MTBC strains based on multiple-biomarker
tensors consists of a sequence of steps. First, we find
informative feature set of spoligotype deletions and generate a tensor. Second, we apply multiway models on
the tensor and get a score matrix for the strain mode.
Third, we use this score matrix to determine the similarity between strains, and cluster them using a stable
version of k-means. In the final step, we evaluate the
clustering results using cluster validity indices. This
stepwise clustering framework is outlined in Figure 16.
We describe the steps of the tensor clustering framework in this section.

The dataset comprises 6848 distinct MTBC strains as

with major lineages and SpolDB4 families. The strains
are mainly from the CDC dataset - a database collected by the CDC from 2004-2008 labeled with the

(http://tbinsight.cs.rpi.edu/) that was previously studied
in [4]. We also used the MIRU-VNTRplus dataset
from www.MIRUVNTRplus.org which is labeled with
SpolDB4 lineages and sublineages. The original
SpolDB4 labeled dataset provided in an online supplement [6] contains only spoligotypes. We found all
occurrences of these spoligotypes in the CDC and
MIRU-VNTRplus dataset and constructed a database
with spoligotype and MIRU patterns, with major
lineages as determined by CDC, and sublineages as
given in the SpolDB4 database [6]. The numbers of
strains for each major lineage in the resulting dataset
are shown in Table 10. We created 6 datasets from the
CDC+MIRU-VNTRplus dataset, one for each major
lineage. These same 6 major lineage datasets were

merged into one for the supervised learning
experiment.
Feature Selection and Tensor Generation

Feature Selection The spoligotype pattern captures the
variability in the DR locus of the MTBC genome. A
spoligotype consists of 43 spacers represented as a 43bit binary sequence, and according to the hidden parent assumption, one or more contiguous spacers can
be lost in a deletion event, but rarely gained [8,24].
Therefore, there are possible deletions of lengths varying from 1 to 43 in a spoligotype. Only subsets of spoligotypedeletions are required for effective
discrimination of MTBC strains. A set of 12 deletion
sequences of spoligotypes reported by Shabbeer et al.
have proven to be good discriminator spacer deletions

This insures that the results are not biased by a priori
selection of spoligotype deletions. Given a set of spoligotypes, we first calculate the frequency fi, i = 1,‥, 946,
of each possible deletion among the spoligotypes of
strains. If fi = 1, the deletion is a common deletion. If
0 ≤ fi <threshold, the deletion is a nonexistent deletion,
where threshold is data dependent and threshold =
0.05 is used by default. The deletions with frequency
fi such that threshold ≤ fi < 1 are uncommon deletions.
In the second step, we iterate through the set of
uncommon deletions U, and remove an uncommon
deletion u Î U, if there exists a common deletion c Î
C which is a substring of u. We assign the final set of
uncommon deletions as the feature set. Using the final
feature set, we determine spoligotype deletions that are
effective in discriminating the strains of the dataset.
Algorithm 1 summarizes the feature selection procedure. Numbers of spoligotype deletions for each major
lineage, found informative by the feature selection
algorithm, are given in Table 10.

sequences are used in the supervised learning study.
Another set of 81 deletion sequences of spoligotypes
reported by Brudey et al. have proven to be good discriminator spacer deletions for SpolDB4 sublineage
classification [6].
Within the TCF, we built a feature selection algorithm to find spacer deletions that are informative.

Tensor Generation We generated multiple-biomarker
tensors using two biomarkers, spoligotype deletions and
MIRU patterns, as explained earlier. The spoligotype
deletions found informative by the feature selection
algorithm are used in the generation of multiplebiomarker tensors. The multiple-biomarker tensor is of
the form Strains × Spoligotype deletions × MIRU
patterns. We used the tensor clustering framework on
multiple-biomarker tensors to cluster strains.
Multiway modeling

Multiway models are needed to fit a model to multiway
arrays. We used PARAFAC and Tucker3 techniques to
model the tensors. We determined the number of components for each model to ensure a bound on the
explained variance of data.
Multiway models We used PARAFAC and Tucker3
models to explain the tensor with high accuracy. Multiway modeling of tensors was carried out using the
n-wayToolbox of MATLAB by Bro et al. and the PLS
toolbox[25,26].

PARAFAC

PARAFAC is a generalization of singular value decomposition to multiway data [27,28]. A 3-way array X Î
ℝI×J×K is modeled by an R-component PARAFAC model
as follows:
R

X ijk =

∑G

rrr A ir B jr C kr

+ E ijk

r =1

where A Î ℝI×R, B Î ℝJ×R, C Î ℝK×R are component
matrices of first, second, and third mode. G Î ℝR×R×R is
the core array, and E Î ℝI×J×K is the residual term containing all unexplained variation. A description of the
PARAFAC model is shown in Figure 17.
The PARAFAC model is symmetric in all modes and
the number of components in each mode is the same
[29]. The PARAFAC model is a simple model, which
comes with a restriction of the equality on the number
of components in each mode which makes it difficult to
fit a data array with the PARAFAC model. One advantage of the PARAFAC model is its uniqueness: fitting
the PARAFAC model with the same number of components to a given multiway dataset returns the same
result.
Tucker3

Tucker3 is an extension of bilinear factor analysis to
multiway datasets [30]. A 3-way array X Î ℝ I×J×K is
modeled by a (P,Q,R)-component Tucker3 model as follows:

where A Î ℝI×P, B Î ℝJ×Q, C Î ℝK×R are the component matrices of first, second and third modes respectively. G Î ℝP×Q×R is the core array and E Î ℝI×J×K is
the residual term. A description of the Tucker3 model is
shown in Figure 18.
Tucker3 is a more flexible model compared to PARAFAC. This flexibility is due to the core array G, which
allows interaction of any factor in a mode with any
other factor in other modes [31]. Therefore, the number
of components for each mode can be different. This
results in indeterminacy of the Tucker3 model, since it
cannot determine the component matrices uniquely.
Model validation A multiway model is appropriate if
adding more components to any mode does not
improve the fit considerably. There is a tradeoff between

model also determines a suitable complexity for the
model. We used the core consistency diagnostic (CORCONDIA) to determine the number of components of
the PARAFAC model [32]. The core consistency diagnostic measures the similarity of the core array G of the
model and the superdiagonal array of ones. Core consistency is always less than or equal to 100% and may also
be negative. As a rule of thumb, Bro et al. suggests that
a core consistency above 90% implies a trilinear model
[32]. In our experiments, we kept core consistency
above 90%, while still explaining the variance of the data
as much as possible with a trilinear model. We determined the number of components of the Tucker3
model by rank reduction on the unfolded tensor along
each mode, and these components explain over 90% of
the variance of the data.
Clustering algorithm

We developed the kmeans_mtimes_seeded algorithm, a
modified version of the k-means algorithm, to group
MTBC strains based on the score matrices of the multi-

way models. K-means is a commonly used clustering
algorithm with two weaknesses: 1) Initial centroids are
chosen randomly, 2) The objective value of k-means,
measured as within-cluster sum of squares, may converge to local minima, rather than finding the global
minimum. We solve these problems with two improvements: 1) Initial centroids are chosen by careful seeding,
using a heuristic called kmeans++, suggested by Arthur
et al. [33]. Let D(x) represent the shortest Euclidean distance from data point x to the closest center already
chosen. kmeans++ chooses a new centroid at each step
such that the new centroid is furthest from all chosen
centroids. Algorithm 2 summarizes the kmeans++ procedure. 2) The local minima problem is partially solved
by repeating the k-means algorithm multiple times and
retrieving the run with the minimum objective value.
We repeated the algorithm m = 20 times. The
kmeans_mtimes_seeded algorithm combines these two
improvements, as summarized in algorithm 3. The
kmeans_mtimes seeded algorithm is more stable

Cluster Validation

Clustering results for the MTBC strains are evaluated to
determine the best choice for the number of clusters
and compare the chosen clustering with existing sublineages using cluster validity indices. We used the bestmatch stability to pick the most stable clusterings. In
case of a tie in average best-match stability, we used the
DD-weighted gap statistic for cluster validation [34]. We
compare our clusters to an existing classification using
the F-measure.
Best-Match Stability The stability of a clustering is
measured by the distribution of pairwise similarities
between clusterings of subsamples of the data. The
idea behind stability is that if we repeatedly sample
data points and apply the same clustering algorithm to
the subsample, then an effective clustering algorithm
applied to well separated data should produce clusterings that do not vary much for different subsamples
[35]. In such cases, the algorithm is stable independent
of input randomization. We use best-match stability as
suggested by Hopcroft et al. [36] to assess stability.
The algorithm clusters the same data multiple times,
and compares the reference cluster to model clusterings. We used 25 model clusterings to compare with
the reference cluster. The stability of each cluster is
calculated by finding the average best match between
this cluster and the clusters identified using other
model clusterings. High average best-match values
denote that the two clusters have many strains in common and are of roughly the same size [8]. We also calculate the average best-match of a clustering by
finding the average of best-match values for all clusters
in the reference clustering. Best-match stability of

match(C , C ’) =

|C ∩ C’|
max(| C |,| C ’ |)

and refCi is the set of items in reference cluster i.
DD-Weighted Gap Statistic (PC) Tibshirani et al.
proposed a cluster validity index called the gap statistic,
which is based on the within-cluster sum of squares
(WCSS) of a clustering [37]. Let the dataset be X Î
ℝn×p consisting of n data points with p dimensions. Let
dij be the Euclidean distance between data points i and
j. After clustering this dataset, suppose that we have
k clusters C1, ‥, Ck, where Ci denotes the indices of data
points in cluster i, of size ni =| Ci |. The sum of withincluster pairwise distances for cluster r is defined as:
Dr =

∑

i , j∈C r

d ij

and the within-cluster sum of squares for a clustering
is defined as:
k

Wk = ∑ D r
r =1

The idea of the gap statistic method is to compare Wk
and its expected value under a reference distribution of
the dataset. Therefore, the gap value is defined as:
Gap n (k) = E *{log(Wk )} − log(Wk )
n

Where E * represents the expected value under a
n
sample of size n based on a reference distribution. The
ˆ
optimal number of clusters is the value k for which
Gapn(k) is maximized. The selection of number of clusters via gap statistic is summarized in [37].
The reference distribution can be one of two choices:
uniform distribution (Gap/Unif), or a uniform distribution over a box aligned with the principal components
of the dataset (Gap/PC). Experiments by Tibshirani
et al. show that Gap/PC finds the number of clusters
more accurately, therefore we used Gap/PC in this
study [37].
The gap statistic is a powerful method for estimating
the number of clusters in a dataset. However, a study by
Dudoit et al. showed that the gap statistic does not

Ozcaglar et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12(Suppl 2):S1
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/S2/S1

estimate the correct number of clusters for every case
[38]. This may be because Wk increases as the number
of data points increases. Hierarchical structure of the
data may also cause problems. The data may be composed of nested clusters and the gap statistic will be
capturing only the minimum of these candidate numbers of clusters. Yan et al. suggested a 2-step improvement to the gap statistic, called the DD-weighted gap
statistic [39]. They defined average within-cluster pairwise distances for cluster r as follows:

Based on Wk ,the weighted gap statistic Gap n (k) is
defined as
Gap n (k) = E *{log(Wk )} − log(Wk )
n

Let DGap n (k) denote the difference in Gap n (k)
when the number of clusters is raised from k-1 to k.
DGap n (k) is defined as
DGap n (k) = Gap n (k) − Gap n (k − 1)
ˆ
DGap n (k) > 0 for k < k , and otherwise it will be
close to zero. Therefore, to find a “knee” point in the
plot, they introduce a second difference equation and
define D DGap n (k) as
D DGap n (k) = DGap n (k) − DGap n (k + 1)
= 2Gap n (k) − Gap n (k − 1) − Gap n (k + 1)
)
D DGap n (k) is maximized when k is equal to
the true number of clusters. The advantage of
D DGap n (k) over the gap statistic is that there may
be multiple peaks in the plot of D DGap n (k) and this
may indicate a hierarchical structure in the data. In
such cases, multilayer analysis should be used instead
of a single step procedure.
F-measure The F-measure is a weighted combination
of precision and recall of a clustering. Since the F-measure combines precision and recall of clustering results,
it has proven to be a successful metric. We use the Fmeasure to evaluate how similar the tensor sublineages
are to the SpolDB4 families. According to the

N-PLS is a multiway regression method where at least
one of the independent and dependent blocks has at
least three modes created by Bro et al. by generalizing
PLS to multiway data [22]. Consider independent variables in the X-block, X Î ℝ I×J×K, and dependent variables in the Y-block, Y Î ℝIxM. In our experiments, the
X-block is a three-way array and the Y-block is a twoway array. The multiway array X is decomposed using a
matricized version X Î ℝ I×JK as:
X=t(wK ⊗ wJ)’ + E (1)
and the two-way array Y is decomposed as:
Y = uq’ + F (2)
where t Î ℝI×1 and u Î ℝI×1 are score vectors of X
and Y. wJ Î ℝJ×1 and wK Î ℝK×1 are the loading vectors
(weights) of the second and third modes of X respectively. q Î ℝ M×1 is the loading vector of Y. E Î ℝIxJK
and F Î ℝIxM are the residuals of X and Y respectively.
Notice that the two-way array Y is decomposed into one
score and one loading vector, whereas the matricized
three-way array X is decomposed into one score and two
loading vectors, wJ and wK. This is the main difference
between N-PLS and PLS. At each iteration of N-PLS, a
new PLS component is added. If n PLS components are
used, X is decomposed into component matrices T Î
ℝI×n, WJ Î ℝJxn, WK Î ℝKxn, and Y is decomposed into
component matrices U Î ℝI×n, Q Î ℝM×n.
The aim of N-PLS is to maximize the covariance of X
and Y. For this purpose, we define an inner relation

Given X and its decomposition matrices, we can make
predictions for a new X-block, using equation 4. The
derivation of the full and closed predictions with N-PLS
has been presented by Smilde et al. [41]. Three alternative methods are proposed by De Jong et al. for derivation of training models via regression coefficients [42].
Bro et al. proposed an improved N-PLS method with
better fit of the independent data, keeping regression
coefficients and predictions the same [43].
The N-PLS model of a multiway array is a multilinear
model, like PARAFAC, which means that it has no rotational freedom. Therefore, the N-PLS model of a multiway array is unique. In this study, we used a 3-way
array as the X-block and a 2-way array as the Y-block,
therefore we are particularly working on the Tri-PLS2
version of N-PLS, which is summarized in Algorithm 4.
The term X(1) in the algorithm refers to X matricized
along the first mode. The X-block and Y-block are centered and scaled prior to application of the algorithm.
