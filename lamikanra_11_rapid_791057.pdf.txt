Abstract
Background: Antibiotic resistance has necessitated fluoroquinolone use but little is known about the selective
forces and resistance trajectory in malaria-endemic settings, where selection from the antimalarial chloroquine for
fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria has been proposed.
Methods: Antimicrobial resistance was studied in fecal Escherichia coli isolates in a Nigerian community.
Quinolone-resistance determining regions of gyrA and parC were sequenced in nalidixic acid resistant strains and
horizontally-transmitted quinolone-resistance genes were sought by PCR. Antimicrobial prescription practices were
compared with antimicrobial resistance rates over a period spanning three decades.
Results: Before 2005, quinolone resistance was limited to low-level nalixidic acid resistance in fewer than 4% of E.
coli isolates. In 2005, the proportion of isolates demonstrating low-level quinolone resistance due to elevated efflux
increased and high-level quinolone resistance and resistance to the fluoroquinolones appeared. Fluoroquinolone
resistance was attributable to single nucleotide polymorphisms in quinolone target genes gyrA and/or parC. By
2009, 35 (34.5%) of isolates were quinolone non-susceptible with nine carrying gyrA and parC SNPs and six bearing
identical qnrS1 alleles. The antimalarial chloroquine was heavily used throughout the entire period but E. coli with
quinolone-specific resistance mechanisms were only detected in the final half decade, immediately following the
introduction of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial ciprofloxacin.
Conclusions: Fluoroquinolones, and not chloroquine, appear to be the selective force for fluoroquinolone-resistant
fecal E. coli in this setting. Rapid evolution to resistance following fluoroquinolone introduction points the need to
implement resistant containment strategies when new antibacterials are introduced into resource-poor settings
with high infectious disease burdens.

1. Background
Chloroquine has been described as one of the most
important drugs ever used to treat an infection. This
cheap and effective drug was the primary antimalarial
worldwide until resistance emerged in the 1970s [1].
Multiple alleles of a chloroquine resistance transporter
gene, pfcrt, and a multidrug resistance transporter gene,

pfmdr1, are associated with chloroquine resistance in
Plasmodium falciparum. Resistant P. falciparum haplotypes that predominate in sub-Saharan Africa appear to
possess a fitness disadvantage, suggesting that they are
maintained by selective pressure from chloroquine,
which is still heavily used [2,3]. Davidson et al [4]
recently proposed that, in addition to the selective pressure for chloroquine-resistant plasmodia, chloroquine’s
weak antibacterial activity confers sufficient selective
advantage for fluoroquinolone resistant Escherichia coli
(FQREC), which emerged in rural Guyana in the

absence of antibacterial quinolone use. If this cheap
antimalarial selects for fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, justification for reintroduction-by combining it
with resistance-reversing chemicals [5] or by withdrawing it until susceptibility is returned and then reintroducing it in combination with other antimalarials [2]-could
decrease because of the great and growing need for
fluoroquinolones. However, little is known about resistance, drug consumption and selection in malaria-endemic Africa, where high levels of chloroquine and
fluoroquinolone use now occurs concurrently.
The quinolone antibacterial nalidixic acid was originally derived from a byproduct of chloroquine synthesis
and shares structural features with chloroquine [6]. Nalidixic acid and its more active derivatives, the fluoroquinolones, were rarely used in Africa before the late 1990s
because of their high cost. More recently, bacterial resistance to cheaper antibacterials has necessitated widespread fluoroquinolone use. Patents protecting
ciprofloxacin and perfloxacin have recently expired,
allowing for cheaper generics to be disseminated widely.
Fluoroquinolones are stable, orally administrable, and
now affordable. In the last decade, fluoroquinolones
have become first- and second-line antibacterials of
choice for acute respiratory, enteric and urinary tract
infections as well as serious systemic infections such as
bacteremia [7,8]. Fluoroquinolones are also employed in
combination with other antimicrobials to treat multidrug resistant tuberculosis [9,10]. Additionally, their use
and misuse in the informal sector, by unsanctioned providers and through self medication, is commonplace in
Nigeria and in many other parts of Africa [11].
Quinolones inhibit the activity of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase enzymes, which are essential for
replication [12]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the
quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDR) of
gyrA and parC, two of the genes that encode DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV respectively, can lead to conformational changes in these enzymes that prevent
quinolones from binding but still preserve their enzymatic function [13]. In E. coli and related Gram-negative
bacteria, DNA gyrase is the first target for fluoroquinolones. If gyrA has resistance-conferring mutations, the
primary target of fluoroquinolones switches from DNA
gyrase to topoisomerase IV [12,14,15]. Mutations in the
QRDRs of gyrA and parC are the most commonly documented quinolone resistance mechanisms, but resistance
is also known to be conferred by mutations in the second topoisomerase gene, parE [14]. Quinolone resistance can also be acquired horizontally through
transferable aac(6’)-Ib or quinolone resistance (qnr)
DNA. AAC(6’)-Ib encodes a ciprofloxacin acetylating
enzyme, while the product of qnr inhibits quinolones

binding to target proteins [16,17]. Another mechanism
of quinolone resistance relies on upregulation of efflux
pumps that export quinolones and other antimicrobials
out of the bacterial cell. For example, mutations in the
gene acrR, which encodes a repressor of the acrAB
pump genes, are associated with quinolone resistance
[18] Recently, qepA and oqxAB, which encode horizontally-transmitted efflux pumps have also been described
[17,19].
Low-level resistance to the quinolones often evolves
by acquisition of one resistance-conferring mutation or
gene. Subsequent genetic changes lead to higher levels
of resistance to the first generation quinolone nalidixic
acid and a broadening of the resistance spectrum to
include second-generation quinolones (first generation
fluoroquinolones) such as ciprofloxacin, followed by
newer second- and third-generation fluoroquinolones
that are yet to reach markets in Nigeria and most other
African countries [12,20]. Although multiple mechanisms of quinolone resistance have been reported from
other continents, there are very few data from subSaharan Africa on the molecular basis for quinolone
resistance. Prior to 2009, horizontally-acquired resistance had not been reported. If cross-selection from
chloroquine results in antibacterial resistance more
globally, then 1) FQREC should be commonplace in
equatorial Africa, which has seen the greatest pressure
from chloroquine, and 2) FQREC would have evolved
before the introduction of quinolone antibacterials. We
report quinolone susceptibility trends among commensal
E. coli isolated from apparently healthy undergraduate
students over three decades and antimicrobial use at the
University health center over that period. Quinolone
resistance emerged within the last decade and was coincident with the introduction of the fluoroquinolone
ciprofloxacin.

2. Methods
2.1. Bacterial isolates

Permission to conduct this study was provided by the
Institutional Review Board of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. E. coli isolates were recovered from
stool specimens collected from apparently healthy
undergraduates at Obafemi Awolowo University as
described previously [21]. Data from isolates collected in
1986-1998 has been described previously. For this study,
we collected and processed specimens in 2005 and 2009
using identical protocols. All volunteers submitting a
stool specimen gave informed consent. The identity of
colonies with a typical E. coli morphology on MacConkey agar was confirmed by biochemical testing. Colonies
from the same specimen with identical biochemical and
susceptibility profiles were treated as identical isolates.

2.2. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing

Each strain was tested for susceptibility to eight antimicrobials using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) disc diffusion method
[22]. Discs used contained ampicillin (10 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), trimethoprim (5 μg), tetracycline (30 μg),
nalidixic acid (30 μg), chloramphenicol (30 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg) and sulphonamide (300 μg) (Oxoid/Remel)
and E. coli ATCC 35218 was used as control strain. Inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance
with CLSI guidelines using WHONET software version
5.3 [23]. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to
nalidixic acid were measured using the agar dilution
technique on Mueller-Hinton agar as recommended by
the CLSI and using E. coli ATCC 35218 as control [24].
MICs to nalidixic acid were also measured in the presence of efflux pump inhibitor phe-arg b-naphthylamide.
2.3. Mutational analysis of the quinolone-resistance
determining regions of gyrA and parC

DNA was extracted from each quinolone-resistant isolate, using the Promega Wizard genomic extraction kit.
The quinolone-resistance determining regions of the
gyrA and parC genes were amplified from DNA templates by PCR using Platinum PCR supermix (Invitrogen) and the primer pairs listed in Additional file 1,
Table S1. PCR reactions began with a two-minute hot
start at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30s,
annealing temperature, 30s and 72°C for 30s. gyrA
amplifications were annealed at 58°C and parC reactions
were annealed at 52°C. E. coli K-12 MG1655 [25] was
used as a control. Amplicons were sequenced on both
strands and predicted peptide sequences were compared
to the corresponding gene from the MG1655 genome
[25] by pair-wise FASTA alignments.
2.4. Identification of horizontally-acquired quinoloneresistance genes

qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS were identified with PCR using
the primer pairs published by Wu et al [26]. The primers of Liu et al [27] were used to screen for the qepA
gene (Additional file 1, Table S1). Amplicons were
sequence-verified.
2.5. Organic solvent tolerance

The qualitative organic solvent tolerance test used by
Wang et al [18] was employed. Briefly 103-104 mid-log
phase bacteria were spotted onto glass plates of LB agar
and overlaid with hexane, cyclohexane or a 1:1 [vol:vol]
mixtures of these solvents. Strains were scored as producing no growth under any solvent (-), growth under all
solvents (+++) or some solvents (+ or ++). Pseudomonas
aeruginosa strain PA14 and E. coli MG1655 were used as
positive and negative controls respectively.

2.6. Determination of transcript levels by quantitative
real-time PCR

Total RNA was extracted from late log-phase cultures
using the Qiagen RNeasy Protect bacterial minikit. Following reverse transcription using the Taqman Reverse
Transcription Reagents and random hexamers (Applied
Biosystems), quantitative real-time PCR with SYBR
green was performed using primer pairs specific for
genes of the components of the efflux pumps or efflux
pump regulators using primers of Nishino et al. [28]
and Bohnert et al. [29] (Additional file 2, Table S2). The
reactions were run on the StepOne Real-time PCR system and performed according to manufacturers recommendations (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression
levels were compared to the control strain MG1655, and
analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method [30]. The rrsA gene
was used as the normalizing gene. Each reaction was
performed in quadruplicate.
2.7. Flagellin typing

fliC PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) typing was performed as described by Fields et
al [31]. The fliC gene of test E. coli strains was amplified
using the primers F-FLIC1 and R-FLIC2 (Additional file
1, Table S1). Amplicons were digested with RsaI and
restriction profiles were discriminated after electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gels.
2.8. Multi-locus sequence typing

PCR primers listed in Additional file 1, Table S1 were
used to amplify gene fragments from the adk, fumC,
gyrB, icd, mdh, purA and recA, as described by Wirth et
al [32]. Amplified DNA products were sequenced from
both ends. Allele assignments were made at the publicly
accessible E. coli MLST database accessible from http://
www.mlst.net/. Phylogenetic inferences about ancestral
allelic profiles and strain interrelatedness were made
using eBURSTv3 at http://eburst.mlst.net/ defining
sequence type (ST) complexes, that is clonal complexes,
based on groups sharing six identical alleles.
2.9. Prescription audit of antimicrobial use

Prescription sheets were obtained with permission from
the Obafemi Awolowo University Ile- Ife, Nigeria for
1984, 1985 and 1986; for 1994, 1995 and 1996 and for
2004, 2005 and 2006. Data from the prescription sheets
was collated into a spreadsheet anonymously and then
the prescription sheets were returned to the University
Health Centre. For each year that was evaluated, 300
prescriptions were randomly selected for each month,
permitting evaluation of 4-8% of the prescriptions that
were actually filled. Prescriptions for all oral and topical
antimicrobials, filled at the institution’s Pharmacy were
documented and units of measurement were

standardized to daily-defined doses were computed
using the AB Consumption Calculator tool [33].

3. Results
3.1. Emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance among
commensal E. coli from south-western Nigeria

Our previous studies which tracked resistance in fecal E.
coli isolates between 1986 and 1998 found uncommon
(0-3.2%) and, in all but one case, low-level resistance to
nalidixic acid and no fluoroquinolone resistance [21].
All but one of the nalidixic acid-resistant isolates identified before 1998 produced an inhibition zone diameter
of at least 10 mm (Nalidixic acid sensitive strains have
zone diameters > 18 mm. Resistant strains have zone
diameters < 14 mm). Due to repeated power cuts in
Nigeria, that strain archive is lost and none of those isolates are available for analysis. Employing an identical
protocol in 2005 we recovered nalidixic acid non-susceptible E. coli from 18 (21.7%) volunteers. Four isolates
exhibited high-level nalidixic acid resistance, producing
no inhibition zone and MICs of ≥ 4 μg ml-1, and one of
these was fluoroquinolone-resistant (Table 1). The
remaining isolates exhibited low-level nalidixic acid
resistance similar to that seen with earlier isolates
reported previously [21]. No 2005 isolate carried horizontally-transmitted qnr or qepA genes but the four
high-level nalidixic acid-resistant strains had mutations
in the quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDR)
of quinolone target gyrA and the single FQREC isolate
had an S80I substitution in ParC (Table 1).
In 2009, we recovered nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli
from 35 (34.5%) volunteers of which 11 isolates were
fluoroquinolone non-susceptible. Isolates obtained from
nine individuals in 2009 harbored one or more nonsynonymous mutations in gyrA and parC QRDRs and
six isolates from the same year carried the horizontally-

transmitted quinolone-resistance gene qnrS1 [34] (Table
1). Altogether, quinolone-specific mechanisms of resistance were identified in 16 isolates from 15 (17.4%) individuals in 2009, compared to 4 (4.8%) in 2005 (p < 0.05,
Chitest with Yates correction for small numbers). All
FQREC strains carried two or more QRDR mutations
and/or qnrS1 (Table 1).
3.2. Molecular basis for nalidixic acid resistance in isolates
obtained in 2005, during the transition to
fluoroquinolone resistance

We isolated 21 nalidixic-acid resistant E. coli strains
from 18 volunteers in Nigeria in 2005 and one of these
was resistant to the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. The
majority (17) showed low-level nalidixic acid resistance
and did not have mutations in gyrA or parC, nor did
they carry horizontally-transmitted quinolone resistance
qnr and qepA genes. Most of these isolates showed
undue tolerance to organic solvents, suggesting that
overactive efflux pumps may account for resistance
(Table 2). We measured nalidixic acid MICs by agar
dilution in the absence and presence of the RND-type
efflux pump inhibitor phe-arg b-naphthylamide. As
shown in Table 2 test strains showed an 8-fold or
greater reduction in the concentration of nalidixic acid
needed to inhibit growth in the presence of phe-arg bnaphthylamide, strongly suggesting a role for up-regulated efflux pumps. To confirm efflux pump upregulation, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to
measure transcription of 13 genes representing the
major known efflux systems in E. coli. Compared to E.
coli K-12 strain MG1655, sixteen isolates showed a twofold or greater upregulation in transcription of the
outer-membrane extrusion factor gene tolC. Seventeen
of the isolates showed two-fold or greater increases in
transcription of one or more other efflux genes and at

least half of the targets were upregulated in most isolates (Table 2). The acrA efflux pump gene and acrR,
encoding the gene’s transcriptional regulator, and their
promoters, were sequenced from five strains but none
contained nucleotide polymorphisms that could account
for increased efflux. We next examined transcription of
six genes encoding regulators of efflux genes, including
acrR, by qPCR and most strains showed upregulated
transcription of one or more of these genes (Table 2).
Of the three E. coli strains we employed as controls,
strains ATCC 25922 and MC4100 produced fold
changes for all genes ranging between 0.5 and 1.4 (compared to K-12 strain MG1655) for the different genes
but we saw a two-fold increase for NCTC 10418 for
nine efflux pump genes but none of the efflux regulators. Twelve of the QREC from Nigeria showed a fourfold or greater fold change in transcription of at least
one gene encoding an efflux pump component and all
but one of these strains had a two-fold of greater fold
upregulation of one or more regulators. Thus, elevated
efflux is the most likely explanation for low-level resistance seen in most of the 2005 isolates.
MLST of quinolone-resistant E. coli revealed a startling lack of diversity with the 21 strains representing
only 13 sequence types. Nine isolates belonging to
sequence type (ST) complex 10 and seven specifically
belonging to ST 10. ST452 (2 isolates) and its single
locus variant ST521, represented a second frequently
occurring clonal complex and we identified one ST156
strain, which along with ST10 has recently been identified among quinolone-resistant E. coli in Ghana (Table
2)[35].
3.3. Antimicrobial prescription trends at the University
Health center

As shown in Table 3, prescribing practices at the Health
Center were highly physician-specific in the 1980s but
by 2004-2006, had become more uniform. However,
with the increasing uniformity, we observed an overall
increase in the mean and median number of drugs per
prescription (Table 3). While only one of five physicians

averaged more than four drugs per prescription in 19841986, in 2004-2006, seven of nine physicians were prescribing an average of four drugs or more per patient.
In spite of the very small number of prescribing physicians, this difference approached statistical significance
(p = 0.06 Fishers exact test). Anti-infectives, the most
commonly prescribed medicines at the health center,
represented 49.3% of the drugs listed on prescriptions
between 1984 and 1986, 21.9% in 1994-1996 and 38.7%
in 2004-2006.
In the 1980s, chloroquine accounted for over 96% of
all antimalarials prescribed. Pyrimethamine alone was
prescribed in prophylactic doses only and sulphadoxinepyrimethamine, which is more expensive than chloroquine but much cheaper than other antimalarials, was
rarely prescribed during the first decade. In the second
decade of the study, this drug combination was prescribed for 5% of patients receiving an antimalarial and
by the 2000s, it was recommended for almost 40% (Figure 1). With the exception of Artemisinin Combination
Therapies (ACTs), use of which increased considerably
between 2004 and 2006, there were no significant
within-decade differences in prescription rates for each
antimalarial. However, antimalarial prescription choices
changed considerably from one decade to the next. Discounting combinations, the greatest diversity of antimalarial drugs was prescribed in the middle decade, 1990s
(Figure 1) and may have been prompted by emerging
resistance and the absence of a set antimalarial policy.
Amodiaquine and halofantrine represented a significant
proportion of prescriptions in the 1990s, but by the
2000s, all patients not receiving chloroquine or amodiaquine received ACTs [36]. A decline in chloroquine prescription from 45.4% to 25.1% occurred in parallel with
ACT roll out. However chloroquine prescription was
never discontinued and it remained the antimalarial of
choice for most patients with clinical malaria throughout the duration of the study (Figure 1).
Like antimalarial prescription, antibacterial prescription altered significantly over the study period (Figure
1). Chloramphenicol and tetracycline, drugs of choice in
the 1980s, were prescribed less in the following decades
as drugs that did not have toxicity concerns became
available and more affordable. Prescription of the aminopenicillins ampicillin and amoxicillin for example
increased eight-fold from between the first and last decade. As with antimalarials, with the exception of tetracycline, drugs that fell out of favor were never completely
discontinued so that selective pressure from them was
never removed. Ciprofloxacin was the only quionolone
prescribed at the health center and was introduced in
the 2000s, the decade in which E. coli with quinolonespecific resistance mechanisms were detected.

4. Discussion
This study allowed us to broach the almost untestable
question of population-level selective forces for quinolone resistance in bacteria within a malaria-endemic
area. The long duration of resistance monitoring offered
significant advantages in spite of unavoidable limitations.
We deemed it important to replicate the methodology
of earlier years, which means that we only examined a
small sample of the commensal E. coli population carried by each volunteer. Other limitations of this study
include the fact that our prescription audit did not sample the complete catalogue of selective pressure for
resistance. It is unlikely that patients who receive free
medications at the health center would have chosen to
purchase their prescriptions elsewhere, however, we cannot rule out the possibility that patients may have purchased other medicines to augment, or replace, those

offered at the health center. Prescriptions for parenteral
drugs are handled differently and records are not
retained long-term at the center and therefore injectables were not evaluated, even though it is well known
that many commonly used antimicrobials are administered intramuscularly in Nigeria [37].
The quinolone resistance rates and their association
with access to quinolones that we have recorded in this
study compare with those from reports from other parts
of Nigeria and West Africa, and all support the hypothesis that fluoroquinolone introduction immediately precedes the evolution of FQREC [38-42]. However, it is
difficult to draw even cautious conclusions across multiple studies and or from anecdotes. Therefore, in spite of
the aforementioned limitations, the present study provides coherent evidence to support the hypothesis
because it tracks resistance and use in a select area

Lamikanra et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:312

using simple but reproducible methodology. Our data
show that quinolone resistance emerged in commensal
E. coli after the 1990s in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, and that our
2005 isolate collection, largely but not entirely comprised of low-level resistors, appears to have been procured at a critical juncture-shortly after the evolution of
resistance. By 2009, 16 (46%) of quinolone-resistant isolates showed high-level quinolone resistance, and resistance to the fluoroquinolones, attributable to quinolonespecific resistance mechanisms that have commonly
been reported in other studies. Resistance-conferring
mutations in gyrA and parC were the most commonly
recorded of these resistance mechanisms. When horizontally-transmitted resistance evolved, qnrS1 was the
most frequently detected transmissible allele among
commensal E. coli from Vietnam and Ghana, where like
Nigeria antimicrobials are freely available and fecal-oral
transmission of bacteria is common [35,43]. Altogether,
we observed rapid, stepwise evolution of FQREC
between 2005 and 2009, from a very low baseline.
The predominance of ST10 among 2005 quinolone
resistant isolates may be due to the overall predominance of ECOR phylogenetic group A strains in West
Africa [44]. However, we have recently shown that this
lineage is overrepresented among quinolone-resistant
strains, as compared to sensitive strains in Ghana [35].
We performed in-depth analyses of the 2005 isolates
from this study to get a sense of how resistance might
have evolved and our data suggest that strains with
overactive efflux may have been the predecessors of
strains exhibiting quinolone-specific resistance mechanisms. The differences in efflux phenotypes, efflux genes
transcription profiles and flagellin types among most of
the strains belonging to the same ST suggest that the
low-level resistance we detect is not primarily due to
expansion of recently derived clones. Instead, the data
appear to suggest that elevated efflux is more likely to
be seen in specific lineages, likely those with overactive
efflux pumps. This in turn points to the idea that certain lineages may be primed to evolve more stable, less
costly resistance. Horizontally-transmitted qnr genes,
including qnrS1 identified in this study have recently
been implicated in providing low-level quinolone resistance that could provide strains with the opportunity to
acquire subsequent mutations in quinolone targets and
therefore higher-level stable resistance [45]. It is therefore worrisome that qnrS1 can now be commonly
detected among E. coli commensals in Nigeria. More
studies are needed to improve our understanding of the
evolution and dissemination of quinolone resistance. We
suggest that on-going and proposed studies tracking
resistance across Africa include a focus on quinolone
resistance at genetic as well as phenotypic levels and
that more work is done to elucidate the genetic context

Page 8 of 10

of successful horizontally transmitted quinolone resistance genes as they appear in African countries, similar
to work that has been done in Vietnam [43].
Rampant non-prescription use, informal supply chains
and a dearth of archival records make it challenging to
quantify drug use in Nigeria. However, the health center
at the University where we tracked resistance offers students and staff free health care and archives dispensed
prescriptions. This long-term study was thus conducted
in a setting that provided the rare opportunity to retrospectively study antimicrobial prescription patterns in an
equatorial Africa locality where resistance was also
tracked. We find that chloroquine prescription was inordinately high in the 1980s with 97% of patients visiting
the health center receiving this drug. Chloroquine prescription declined steadily thereafter but never dropped
below 500 daily-defined doses, with 25% of patients
receiving this drug in 2006 (Figure 2). In contrast to the
earlier report from Guyana [4], we do not find evidence
of selection for FQREC from heavy and long-running
chloroquine use in this setting. By contrast, quinolone
antibacterials were never used before the 2000s and
introduction of ciprofloxacin is temporally associated
with evolution, and rising rates, of FQREC carriage by
campus undergraduates. The significance of our findings
cannot be over-emphasized since current efforts to ‘bring
back’ chloroquine, an extremely effective and cheap antimalalarial, would be de-prioritized if there were adverse
consequences on resistance in other organisms.
The number of drugs prescribed per patient and the
common use of antimicrobial drugs we documented
compare with studies performed elsewhere in Nigeria
for the respective periods [46,47]. Overall antimicrobial

use was characterized by heavy dependence on three
drug classes or less and a shift in favored drug categories from one decade to another, without withdrawal
of earlier favorites. This drug use pattern, typified by the
antimalarial chloroquine, favors the emergence of stable
resistance [40,48,49].
Quinolones are drugs of last resort that are increasingly
employed in Nigeria and other African countries to manage common bacterial infections. In the face of high and
rising resistance to more affordable antimicrobials and
the unavailability of newer, patent protected antibacterials, there is currently no real alternative to their use in
West Africa. Evolution of resistance to the quinolones
among E. coli has important clinical implications because
resistance patterns in commensals typically mirror those
seen in pathogens exposed to similar selection. A recent
report from neighboring Cameroon suggests that quinolone resistance has emerged among Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhi there [50] and we have reported quinolone
resistance in epidemic Vibrio cholerae from Ghana [51].

Conclusion
This study charts the appearance of quinolone-resistant
E. coli in a Nigerian malaria endemic community, which
has seen heavy and long-term use of chloroquine. The
study demonstrates that quinolone resistance was not
temporally associated with chlrooquine use but appeared
shortly after fluoroquinolone introduction. The diversity
of quinolone-specific resistance mechanisms that
emerged following ciprofloxacin introduction points to
an urgent need for therapeutic alternatives and resistance containment. Our findings suggest that the useful
lifespan for newly introduced antimicrobials that have
been used extensively elsewhere can be short. High
prices of patent-protected drugs delay their introduction
to developing countries and strategies for ensuring early
but controlled access to novel antimicrobials may be
necessary to ensure medium- to long-term efficacy in
resource-limited settings.
