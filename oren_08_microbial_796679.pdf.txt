Abstract
Halophiles are found in all three domains of life. Within the Bacteria we know halophiles within the
phyla Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Bacteroidetes. Within
the Archaea the most salt-requiring microorganisms are found in the class Halobacteria.
Halobacterium and most of its relatives require over 100–150 g/l salt for growth and structural
stability. Also within the order Methanococci we encounter halophilic species. Halophiles and nonhalophilic relatives are often found together in the phylogenetic tree, and many genera, families and
orders have representatives with greatly different salt requirement and tolerance. A few
phylogenetically coherent groups consist of halophiles only: the order Halobacteriales, family
Halobacteriaceae (Euryarchaeota) and the anaerobic fermentative bacteria of the order
Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes). The family Halomonadaceae (Gammaproteobacteria) almost exclusively
contains halophiles. Halophilic microorganisms use two strategies to balance their cytoplasm
osmotically with their medium. The first involves accumulation of molar concentrations of KCl.
This strategy requires adaptation of the intracellular enzymatic machinery, as proteins should
maintain their proper conformation and activity at near-saturating salt concentrations. The
proteome of such organisms is highly acidic, and most proteins denature when suspended in low
salt. Such microorganisms generally cannot survive in low salt media. The second strategy is to
exclude salt from the cytoplasm and to synthesize and/or accumulate organic 'compatible' solutes
that do not interfere with enzymatic activity. Few adaptations of the cells' proteome are needed,
and organisms using the 'organic-solutes-in strategy' often adapt to a surprisingly broad salt
concentration range. Most halophilic Bacteria, but also the halophilic methanogenic Archaea use
such organic solutes. A variety of such solutes are known, including glycine betaine, ectoine and
other amino acid derivatives, sugars and sugar alcohols. The 'high-salt-in strategy' is not limited to
the Halobacteriaceae. The Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes) also accumulate salt rather than organic
solutes. A third, phylogenetically unrelated organism accumulates KCl: the red extremely halophilic
Salinibacter (Bacteroidetes), recently isolated from saltern crystallizer brines. Analysis of its genome
showed many points of resemblance with the Halobacteriaceae, probably resulting from extensive
horizontal gene transfer. The case of Salinibacter shows that more unusual types of halophiles may
be waiting to be discovered.

Introduction
At the symposium on 'General & Applied Aspects of Halophilic Microorganisms', held in Alicante, Spain in September 1989, Hans Trüper presented a lecture entitled:
"Halophily, taxonomy, phylogeny and nomenclature".
The talk summarized different aspects of the taxonomy of
halophilic microorganisms, the phylogenetic position of
the different types of halophiles within the microbial
world, and the physiology of the diverse groups of
extreme and moderate halophiles. An attempt was made
to detect consistent patterns and correlations between the
phylogeny of halophilic microorganisms and the ways
they cope with the high salt concentrations in the environment in which they live. A summary of this talk was published three years later in the proceedings volume of the
Alicante meeting [1], and there Prof. Trüper and his coworkers presented a critical analysis of the data. They noted
a few regular patterns that link the physiological properties of the halophilic organisms with their phylogenetic
position. Four such general observations were presented:
(1) "All eubacteria that gain energy from photosynthesis
or oxygen-respiration and are capable of haloadaptation,
are able to accumulate and/or produce compatible solutes."
(2) "Archaeobacteria and anaerobic fermenting eubacteria are incapable of synthesizing organic compatible solutes."
(3) "Most eubacteria that can grow in non-complex media
are capable of ectoine biosynthesis."
(4) "Extreme halophily in non-fermenting eubacteria is
usually accompanied by glycine betaine biosynthesis. The
complete de novo synthesis of betaine from carbon dioxide or simple organic carbon compounds has only been
proven for cyanobacteria, Ectothiorhodospira species and
Actinopolyspora halophila."
In the eighteen years that have passed since the Alicante
meeting our understanding of the salt-loving microbial
world has greatly increased. A large number of new halophilic organisms have been discovered and described,
including organisms phylogenetically unaffiliated to previously known halophilic or halotolerant microorganisms. We have also obtained a deeper insight into the
physiological mechanisms used by different types of halophiles to adapt to life in hypersaline environments.
Based on the key words in the title of Prof. Trüper's talk –
"halophily", "taxonomy", "phylogeny" and "nomenclature", this paper first presents an overview of the novel
information, followed by a reevaluation of the four
above-cited general observations made in 1989.

Halophily and the phylogenetic tree of life
Salt dependence and salt tolerance are phenotypic characteristics generally included in the 'polyphasic' characterization of newly discovered microorganisms toward their
description as new taxa with new names and the determination of their position within the microbial taxonomy.
There is no sharp definition of the term 'halophilic' – 'saltloving'. Some use the term for all organisms that require
some level of salt for growth, including concentrations
around 35 g/l as found in seawater. This is also reflected
in prokaryote nomenclature: there are quite a few bacteria
with the specific epithet 'halophilus' (-a, -um) that are of
marine origin and do not tolerate salt concentrations
much above those of seawater. Examples are Aestuariibacter halophilus, Algoriphagus halophilus (Hongiella halophila), Arcobacter halophilus, Microbacterium halophilum,
and Terribacillus halophilus. The use of the specific epithet
halophilus to describe marine microorganisms should be
discouraged, and it is recommended to reserve this name
for true halophiles adapted to life in hypersaline conditions.

A survey of the salt relationships – the minimum salt concentration required for growth, the salinity optimum, and
the upper salt limit tolerated – within the microbial world
shows a continuum of properties, which makes it nearly
impossible to define by sharp boundaries what a halophile is. Moreover, the minimum, optimum and maximum salt concentrations often depend on the medium
composition and growth temperature. The most widely
used definitions were formulated thirty years ago by
Donn Kushner [2] who distinguished different categories:
extreme halophiles (growing best in media containing
2.5–5.2 M salt), borderline extreme halophiles (growing
best is media containing 1.5–4.0 M salt), moderate halophiles (growing best in media containing 0.5–2.5 M salt),
and halotolerant microorganisms that do not show an
absolute requirement for salt for growth but grow well up
to often very high salt concentrations (considered
extremely halotolerant if the growth range extends above
2.5 M salt). These and similar definitions have proved valuable in the classification of microorganisms according to
their relationship to salt [3-5]. For the discussions below
a simpler operative definition of what a halophile is will
suffice: microorganisms that grow optimally at salt concentrations of 50 g/l (equivalent to 0.85 M NaCl) or
higher, and tolerate 100 g/l salt (equivalent to 1.7 M
NaCl) at least.
When examining the distribution of halophiles, as based
on the above definition, within the small subunit rRNA
sequence-based phylogenetic tree of life, it is clear that
halophiles are found in all three kingdoms: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (Fig. 1) [3,4,6]. The figure indicates
which groups of microorganisms contain halophilic rep-

halophilic microorganisms within the tree. Groups marked with blue boxes contain at least one halophilic representative
(e.g the Bacteroidetes, of which Salinibacter ruber is the sole halophilic member described to date); others such as the Halobacteriales consist entirely of halophiles. The tree is based on Fig. 11.16 in Madigan and Martinko, 2006 (78).

resentatives. Groups marked as such do not necessarily
consist solely of halophiles. The opposite is true: there are
only a few phylogenetically consistent groups that are
composed entirely of halophiles (see below). In most
cases halophiles and non-halophilic relatives are found
together in the phylogenetic tree, and many genera, families and orders have representatives with greatly different
salt requirement and tolerance. Within the Archaea we
find the most salt-requiring microorganisms in the order
Halobacteriales, which contains a single family, the Halobacteriaceae. Halobacterium and most of its relatives require
over 100–150 g/l salt for growth and structural stability.
Also within the class Methanothermea (Methanococci),
order Methanosarcinales we encounter halophilic or highly
halotolerant representatives (genera Methanohalophilus,
Methanohalobium). All these belong to the phylum Euryarchaeota; no halophilic representatives have yet been identified within the Crenarchaeota. Halophily is widespread
in the bacterial kingdom: we know halophiles within the
phyla Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, and Bacteroidetes.
With a few notable exceptions, the eukaryotic microorganisms form a sadly neglected group as far as the study of
their distribution in high-salt environments and their
physiological adaptation to life at high salt concentrations

is concerned. The unicellular green algae of the genus
Dunaliella have been investigated in-depth, as they are the
main or sole primary producers in many hypersaline environments, they have become a popular model system for
the study of salt adaptation by using organic osmotic
'compatible' solutes, and they have also found biotechnological applications [7]. The occurrence of the brine
shrimp (Artemia salina, Artemia franciscana) in salt lakes is
also well known, but the discussion of its biology is outside the scope of this review. The Fungi, long neglected in
halophile research, contain a number of representatives
that by all criteria are true halophiles, both by their absolute requirement for high salt and by their ability to grow
up to salt concentrations approaching saturation. Examples are the meristematic fungus Trimmatostroma salinum
[8] and the black yeast Hortaea werneckii [9], organisms
indigenous to saltern brines and other hypersaline environments. Even more severely neglected is the study of
flagellate, ciliate and amoeboid protozoa that live in highsalt environments. The existence of such organisms has
been documented already long ago [[10,11]; for an overview of the early literature see [12]), but only recently has
the study of truly halophilic heterotrophic nanoflagellates
taken off. Different types of halophilic flagellates were
found in Korean saltern ponds [13], and two species have
thus far been characterized in-depth. The first is Pleurosto-

mum flabellatum, an organism known already since the
1930s. An isolate from a saltern pond with 313 g/l salt has
its optimum at 300 g/l salt and does not grow below
150–200 g/l [14]. Another bacteriovorous heterotrophic
nanoflagellate isolated from a 300 g/l saltern pond is
Halocafetaria seosinensis, which grows optimally at 150 g/l
salt, does not grow below 75 g/l, and tolerates concentrations above 350 g/l total dissolved salts [15].
The Halobacteriales, the Halomonadaceae, and the
Halanaerobiales: three phylogenetically coherent groups
of halophiles
Within the small subunit rRNA gene sequence-based tree
of life we find three groups of prokaryotes that are both
phylogenetically and physiologically coherent and consist
entirely or almost entirely of halophiles. Within the Euryarchaeota we encounter the order Halobacteriales with a
single family, the Halobacteriaceae [16]. In the bacterial
kingdom, the family Halomonadaceae (class Gammaproteobacteria, order Oceanospirillales) predominantly contains
halophiles [17]. Members of the Halobacteriaceae and the
Halomonadaceae are aerobic heterotrophs, some of which
have a limited potential for anaerobic growth. The third
phylogenetically coherent group contains the anaerobic
fermentative bacteria of the order Halanaerobiales (Firmicutes, families Halanaerobiaceae and Halobacteroidaceae)
[18].

Our understanding of the phylogenetic and physiological
diversity within the Halobacteriaceae and the Halomonadaceae has greatly increased in the past two decades. Extensive programs aimed at the sampling of salt lakes and
other saline and hypersaline environments in different
countries have led to the characterization and taxonomic
description of many new species, so that the number of
species names within these two families has increased
exponentially. The 1974 edition of 'Bergey's Manual of
Determinative Bacteriology' listed 2 genera and 3 species
within the family Halobacteriaceae [19]. The next edition
of the handbook, published in 1989 under the new name
'Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology', already had
6 genera and 11 species [20]. The numbers of genera and
species increased to 14 and 34, respectively in the 2001
edition [21], and to date (March 2008) the names of no
less than 26 genera and 91 different species of Halobacteriaceae have been validly published under the rules of the
International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (Fig.
2, upper panel). With descriptions of eight additional new
species listed as 'in press' in the International Journal of
Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (as of March 2,
2008), the current trend is expected to continue at least for
some more time.
Most species of Halobacteriaceae are true extreme halophiles according to Kushner's definition [2]. However,

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2

analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified from environments
with salt concentrations below 100 g/l shows that the
lower salinity boundary that allows development of
archaeal halophiles may be substantially lower than that
of Halobacterium salinarum, Haloarcula marismortui, and
other well-studied members of the group [22]. Descriptions of isolates phylogenetically affiliated with the Halobacteriaceae but with a relatively low salt requirement also
started to appear in the literature. A saline spring in Oklahoma whose waters contain 7–10 g/l salt, a concentration
far too low to support growth of most members of the
Halobacteriaceae, recently yielded a novel species of Haloferax, Haloferax sulfurifontis [23] and two species belonging
to new genera:Haladaptatus paucihalophilus (the specific
epithet signifying its low salt requirement) [24] and
Halosarcina pallida [25]. The lower salinity boundary of
these species for growth is 60, 47, and 76 g/l, respectively,
but the optimal salt concentrations and the maximal
salinity tolerated by these isolates are within the high
ranges normally encountered for members of the family.
Halobacterium salinarum and most other species of Halobacteriaceae lyse when the salt concentration is lowered
below 100 g/l. However, some of its relatives have a
remarkable ability to withstand exposure to low salt concentrations. Out of 131 isolates of Halobacteriaceae
obtained from Spanish saltern ponds, 49 did not lyse in
20 g/l salt and 13 even survived exposure to 10 g/l salt
[26]. It was recently shown that isolates obtained from
Japanese salterns and affiliated with the genera Halococcus,
Halogeometricum and Haladaptatus may survive periods of
1–9 days in salt solutions of seawater concentration [27].
Haloferax sulfurifontis survived incubation for 24 h at
10–20 g/l salt and 72 h in 30 g/l salt [23], and Haladaptatus paucihalophilus cells even retained their viability after
having been suspended for two weeks in distilled water
[24]. The sediments of a British salt marsh yielded several
isolates of Halobacteriaceae, many of which closely related
to Haladaptatus paucihalophilus, which grow slowly at seawater salinity [28].
It must be realized that there is no well-based species concept for the prokaryotes, and the same is therefore true for
the halophilic Archaea. The above-presented statistics of
the number of species described are all based on some
more or less arbitrary ideas of how to define a species and
when to decide whether a new isolate may belong to an
already known species or should be described as a novel
one. A recent evaluation of a large number of isolates of
Halobacteriaceae from saltern ponds in Spain and Algeria
using multilocus sequence analysis shows that, although
clusters can be defined by concatenation of multiple
marker sequences, barriers to exchange between them are
leaky. No nonarbitrary way to circumscribe 'species' is
therefore likely to emerge for the Halobacteriaceae in the
near future [29].

A dramatic increase in the number of descriptions of new
species in recent years can also be observed for the second
phylogenetic group that consists (almost) entirely of halophiles: the family Halomonadaceae (Gammaproteobacteria).
When Halomonas elongata was isolated in 1980 [30], few
people predicted that it would be the first representative
of a very large group of metabolically versatile moderate
halophiles. The recognition that Halomonas and relatives
deserve to be classified in a separate family came in 1988
[31], and the number of species and genera has been rising steadily since ([5,32,33]; Fig. 2, middle panel).
Recently two new genera were added to the family, Halotalea and Modicisalibacter [34,35], bringing the census for
March 2008 to 7 genera with 63 species whose names
have been validly published. Out of these 63 species, 60
can be considered halophiles as based on the above definition. The three genera Zymomonas, Carnimonas, and
Cobetia each contain presently one non-halophilic or
marine species. As of March 2, 2008, four new species of
the genus Halomonas were listed as 'in press' in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology.
The third phylogenetically coherent group consisting
entirely of halophiles is the interesting but little studied
order Halanaerobiales, families Halanaerobiaceae and Halobacteroidaceae (Low G+C branch of the Firmicutes) [18].
This group consists of obligate anaerobes, and most live
by fermentation of sugars or (in a few cases only) amino
acids. That the study of this group has to some extent been
neglected in comparison with the other halophile
branches is obvious from the number of new species
described: the count for March 2008 was 11 genera and 24
species (Fig. 2, lower panel), the two most recently added
genera and species – Halonatronum saccharophilum and
Selenihalanaerobacter shriftii having been described in
2001. The latter species is of special interest as it makes a
living by anaerobic respiration rather than by fermentation [36]. The family Halanaerobiaceae also contains a
thermophilic representative: Halothermothrix orenii, an
organism isolated from a hypersaline lake in Tunisia that
combines anaerobic life at high salt (optimum 100 g/l,
tolerating up to 200 g/l salt) with a high temperature optimum (60°C, growing up to 68°C) [37].
Mechanisms of adaptation of halophilic microorganisms
to life at high salt
Trüper's four 'postulates', as presented at the Alicante symposium [1], deal with the presence, distribution and biosynthesis of organic osmotic solutes, and they mention
specific compounds such as ectoine and glycine betaine.

A basic property of all halophilic microorganisms is the
fact that their cytoplasm has to be at least isoosmotic with
their surrounding medium. Biological membranes are

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2

permeable to water, and active energy-dependent inward
transport of water to compensate for water lost by osmotic
processes is energetically not feasible. Moreover, cells that
keep a turgor need even to maintain their intracellular
osmotic pressure higher than that of their environment
[38,39].
There are two fundamentally different strategies used by
halophilic microorganisms to balance their cytoplasm
osmotically with their medium. The first involves accumulation of molar concentrations of potassium and chloride. This strategy requires extensive adaptation of the
intracellular enzymatic machinery to the presence of salt,
as the proteins should maintain their proper conformation and activity at near-saturating salt concentrations
[40]. The proteome of such organisms is highly acidic,
and most proteins denature when suspended in low salt.
Such 'high-salt-in strategy' microorganisms generally cannot survive in low salt media.
Although it can be calculated that the 'high-salt-in strategy' is energetically less costly to the cell than the biosynthesis of large amounts of organic osmotic solutes [41],
this strategy is not widely used among the different phylogenetic and physiological groups of halophiles (Fig. 3).
It is best known from the extremely halophilic Archaea of
the family Halobacteriaceae, and species such as Halobacterium salinarum and Haloarcula marismortui have become
popular model organisms to examine the implications
that the maintenance of high intracellular KCl concentrations has on the life of a cell. Our understanding of the
biology of the Halobacteriaceae has greatly increased in
recent years thanks to the elucidation and analysis of the
genome sequences of Halobacterium NRC-1 [42,43],
Haloarcula marismortui [44], Natronomonas pharaonis [45],
and Halquadratum walsbyi [46].
The strategy of salt adaptation is not limited to the aerobic
halophilic Archaea. The anaerobic fermentative Halanaerobiales (Bacteria, Firmicutes) also use KCl rather than
organic solutes to osmotically balance their cytoplasm,
and they also have adapted their intracellular machinery
to tolerate the presence of salt [18,47]. The third type of
organism, phylogenetically unrelated with the abovementioned two groups, in which the 'high-salt-in-strategy'
was recently identified to occur, is the aerobic red
extremely halophilic Salinibacter ruber (Bacteroidetes). The
properties of this intriguing organism are discussed below
in further depth.
Far more widespread in nature is the second strategy of
haloadaptation, based on the biosynthesis and/or accumulation of organic osmotic solutes. Cells that use this
strategy exclude salt from their cytoplasm as much as possible. The high concentrations of organic 'compatible' sol-

Figure 3
Distribution within the phylogenetic tree of microorganisms accumulating KCl as their sole or main osmotic
solute. Groups marked with purple boxes contain at least one halophilic representative (e.g. Salinibacter ruber within the
Bacteroidetes). The group of the Firmicutes contains both microorganisms that use KCl for osmotic balance (the order Halanaerobiales within the low G+C branch, consisting of anaerobic fermentative organisms) and different halophilic aerobes (Halobacillus spp. and others) that accumulate inorganic solutes. High intracellular KCl concentrations are also found in the
methanogenic halophiles, but these accumulate organic solutes as well.

utes do not greatly interfere with normal enzymatic
activity. Few adaptations of the cells' proteome are therefore needed. Such organisms can often adapt to a surprisingly broad salt concentration range [5]. The list of
organic compounds that have been shown to serve as
osmotic solutes in halophilic microorganisms – prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic – is extensive. Most compatible
solutes are based on amino acids and amino acid derivatives, sugars, or sugar alcohols [48-50]. Most are either
uncharged or zwitterionic (Fig. 4).
Use of the 'low-salt-in strategy' of haloadaptation with
accumulation of organic osmotic solutes is widespread in
the small subunit rRNA sequence-based phylogenetic tree
of life (Fig. 5). Not all groups of halophiles have yet been
examined for the occurrence and distribution of organic
solutes. For example, no information is available on the
composition and concentrations of intracellular solutes
within the recently characterized extremely halophilic
flagellate protozoa [14,15]. We do, however, have a quite
complete picture of the distribution of organic solutes in
most other groups of halophilic microorganisms. Glycerol and other polyols are widely used for osmotic adaptation in halophilic eukaryotic algae and fungi, but only

seldom in the the prokaryotes, the finding of mannitol in
Pseudomonas putida [51] being a notable exception. The
occurrence of certain other solutes in halophilic and halotolerant prokaryotes is also often correlated with their
position in the phylogenetic tree of life.
Within the domain Archaea we find a few solutes not yet
detected elsewhere within the tree [49]. Halophilic methanogens such as the Methanohalophilus species contain, in
addition to glycine betaine found widespread in nature, βamino acids and derivatives that are rarely found in other
groups: β-glutamine, β-glutamate, and Nε-acetyl-β-lysine
([49,52]; for a report on the occurrence of β-glutamate in
the domain Bacteria see [53]). Sulfotrehalose has thus far
been found only in a few alkaliphilic members of the
Halobacteriaceae; it is accumulated in substantial concentrations (up to 1 M) in addition to KCl which serves as the
main osmotic solute like in their neutrophilic relatives
[54].
In the kingdom Bacteria the largest diversity of organic
solutes is detected. Some compounds appear to be used
by a wide range of organisms. Glycine betaine is readily
used as osmotic solute by many different types [55], but

only when it can be taken up from the medium. Relatively
few prokaryotes are capable of de novo synthesis of the
compound. Notably these are different types of phototrophs: halophilic cyanobacteria as well as anoxygenic
phototrophs such as Halorhodospira spp. Occurrence of
glycine betaine biosynthesis in the heterotrophic Actinopolyspora halophila (Actinobacteria) has been established
long ago. In recent years the list of non-phototrophic
prokaryotes capable of de novo production of glycine
betaine as regulated by the extracellular salt concentration
has grown. The methanogenic archaeon Methanohalophilus portucalensis synthesizes glycine betaine by reductive
methylation of glycine that is generated from serine
[50,56-59]. In contrast, the far less halotolerant Methanosarcina mazei does not produce glycine betaine, but
accumulates the compound from the medium when
exposed to salt stress. Recently evidence was obtained for
de novo biosynthesis of glycine betaine also in the haloalkaliphilic chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing Proteobacteria Thioalkalibacter and Thioalkalivibrio [60,61], but no
information is as yet available about the biosynthetic
pathway used and its regulation.

derivatives ectoine and hydroxyectoine, originally discovered in anoxygenic phototrophs of the Ectothiorhodospira –
Halospira group [48]. Ectoine is now known to be synthesized by many aerobic heterotrophic bacteria [5,49].
Ectoine was also recently identified as a major osmotic
solute in halophilic methanotrophs and methylotrophs
[62,63].
The list of organic compatible solutes that have been identified is long, and Fig. 4 gives a representative selection
only. Some compounds are widespread along the phylogenetic tree, while others appear to be limited to selected
groups. For example, glucosylglycerol is almost exclusively found in moderately halophilic or highly halotolerant cyanobacteria, but has been detected in some
pseudomonads as well [64,65]; Nε-acetyl-α-lysine and
Nδ-acetylornithine have thus far been detected only in
aerobic members of the Firmicutes. Another compound of
interest is proline, found especially in the Firmicutes
[66,67], but also present in halophilic/halotolerant diatoms [68]. A special biosynthetic pathway for the production of proline for osmotic purposes has been detected in
Bacillus subtilis [69].

Far more abundant than glycine betaine as compatible
solute in the domain Bacteria are the cyclic amino acid

Use of organic osmotic solutes, whose intracellular concentrations can be regulated in accordance with the external salt concentration, provides microorganisms with a
large degree of flexibility and the possibility to adapt to a
wide range of salt concentrations [5,48]. However, energetically the production of massive amounts of such solutes can be costly. In addition, energy is still needed to
prevent salts from reaching the cytoplasm. The high
energy cost involved is especially relevant for microorganisms that obtain small amounts of energy from the dissimilatory processes they perform. A calorimetric study
with Halomonas elongata, a bacterium that produces
ectoine as its main compatible solute, shows that the
organism has optimized its metabolism to minimize the
energetic cost of osmotic adaptation [70]. It is well possible that the upper salinity at which different metabolic
types of prokaryotes are found in nature depends to a
large extent on the balance between the amount of energy
that is available to the cells and the cost of production of
organic solutes needed to provide osmotic balance [41].
The case of Salinibacter, a member of the Bacteria with
archaeal characteristics
Until recently it was generally accepted that halophilic
members of the bacterial domain use organic solutes for
osmotic balance. The sole exception known was that of
the Halanaerobiales, a group of fermentative halophiles
phylogenetically affiliated with the low G+C branch of the
Firmicutes. It was also clear why the 'high-salt-in strategy'
would be the preferred or possibly the only feasible mode
of haloadaptation in this group: only very little energy is
obtained in the fermentation pathways that provide ATP
to these organisms, and accordingly the production of
massive amounts of organic compatible solutes would
leave insufficient energy for other cellular functions [41].

The discovery of Salinibacter and the analysis of its properties (Table 1) now require a change in our views. Salinibacter ruber is a red extreme halophile, phylogenetically
belonging to the Bacteroidetes branch of the Bacteria, and
it coexists with Archaea of the family Halobacteriaceae in
NaCl-saturated saltern crystallizer ponds and in other

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/2

hypersaline environments at or approaching halite saturation. Its existence was first recognized in the late 1990s
based on the molecular characterization of the microbial
community in Spanish saltern crystallizer ponds [71]. The
isolation of the organism soon followed [72-74].
The affiliation of Salinibacter with the Bacteria appears not
only from the sequence of its 16S rRNA gene, but also
from the nature of the lipids in its membrane – bacterial
lipids, in part of an unusual type, but with conventional
fatty acids rather than the archaeal phytanyl-based hydrophobic chains [75]. The sensitivity of Salinibacter to antibiotics points to the presence of peptidoglycan in its cell
wall. It was therefore expected that, like all other known
halophilic and halotolerant aerobic Bacteria, Salinibacter
would contain an organic solute or a cocktail of such solutes. However, no significant concentrations of organic
solutes were detected. Instead, the cells contain molar
concentrations of KCl [76], and its proteome is highly
acidic, nearly as much so as the proteome of Halobacterium
[77]. Analysis of the genome of S. ruber showed many
additional common properties with the extremely halophilic Archaea. Extensive gene exchange may have
occurred between Salinibacter and the Halobacteriaceae,
which share the same environment and have been subject
to the same environmental stress factors throughout their
evolutionary history [77].
Final comments
Based on all the new information that has become available in the past two decades we can now reevaluate the four
'postulates' presented by Trüper at the Alicante 1989 halophile symposium [1]:

(1) "All eubacteria that gain energy from photosynthesis
or oxygen-respiration and are capable of haloadaptation,
are able to accumulate and/or produce compatible solutes."
For the Bacteria that lead an oxygenic or anoxygenic phototrophic life this statement is still true. However, the discovery of Salinibacter ruber, phylogenetically affiliated

with the Bacteroidetes but physiologically behaving like a
member of the Halobacteriaceae, shows that the 'high-saltin strategy' of osmotic adaptation, based on the accumulation of KCl and the adaptation of the entire intracellular
enzymatic machinery to the presence of high salt concentrations, also occurs in some oxygen-respiring members of
the domain Bacteria.
(2) "Archaeobacteria and anaerobic fermenting eubacteria are incapable of synthesizing organic compatible solutes."
No cases of anaerobic fermenting Bacteria that produce
organic osmotic solutes have yet been documented. However, compatible solutes have been detected in several
groups of halophilic Archaea. Methanogenic Archaea
(also the non-halophilic ones) contain high concentrations of KCl, but in the halophilic types such as Methanohalophilus spp. different organic solutes are known to
occur: glycine betaine, and β-amino acids and derivatives.
The intracellular concentrations of at least some of these
compounds are regulated in accordance with the salinity
of the environment. Another case of organic solutes discovered in Archaea is that of sulfotrehalose which,
together with KCl, appears to play a role in the osmotic
adaptation of some haloalkaliphilic members of the Halobacteriaceae.

between halophily, taxonomy, phylogeny and nomenclature. The halophilic microbial world is tremendously
diverse, and novel types of halophiles are being discovered at an ever-increasing rate. The case of Salinibacter
ruber shows that some of these newly described organisms
may necessitate us to revise our concepts on how the different physiological and phylogenetic groups of microorganisms have solved the problem how to cope with high
salt concentrations in their environment. Hypersaline
environments are extremely diverse, and so are the microorganisms that inhabit them.

(3) "Most eubacteria that can grow in non-complex media
are capable of ectoine biosynthesis."
Ectoine indeed appears to be the nearly universal organic
compatible solutes in the Bacteria, and its biosynthesis
has been documented in a wide variety of halophilic and
halotolerant species, and notably in species with simple
growth demands.

usually accompanied by glycine betaine biosynthesis. The
complete de novo synthesis of betaine from carbon dioxide or simple organic carbon compounds has only been
proven for cyanobacteria, Ectothiorhodospira species and
Actinopolyspora halophila."
The truly halophilic species within the genus Ectothiorhodospira have since been reclassified in the newly created
genus Halorhodospira. The finding of complete de novo
biosynthesis of glycine betaine in the methanogenic
archaeon Methanohalophilus portucalensis and in haloalkaliphilic bacterial chemolithotrophs shows that production of this simple solute may be more widespread than
previously assumed.
Summarizing all these new data, it becomes ever more difficult to formulate general trends to describe the relations
