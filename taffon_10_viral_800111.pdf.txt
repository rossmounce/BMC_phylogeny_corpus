Background
The genetic variability of hepatitis B virus in sera from
HBV-DNA positive patients, HBsAg negative and
antiHBc positive, coinfected with both HIV and HCV,
was studied, to describe the natural history of HBV
occult infections.
Methods
The follow-up sera, encompassing a six to nine years
period, from eight patients with triple coinfection (HIV,
HBV, HCV) were tested by a real time PCR HBV-DNA
assay. Four patients that were HBsAg negative and
HBV-DNA positive were classified as affected by occult
infection. The remaining four that were HBsAg positive
were used as controls. HBV-DNA was amplified by PCR
and the sequence of the whole HBV genome was characterized by phylogenetic analysis (Neighbor Joining
method, implemented by MEGA 3.1 software) and for
the presence of specific mutations.

Discussion
Mutations in the “a” determinant of the S protein could
be responsible for the absence of HBsAg detection. The
presence of stop codon in the pre-core region and of
mutations in the X region could, in part, explain the
reactivation of HBV viremia.

Results
Three out of four HBV patients with occult infection,
showed reactivation phases of HBV viremia. Different
mutations were observed, with differences between preand post-reactivation sera. HBV-DNA remained at low
levels during the entire study period also in absence of
specific anti-HBV therapy. The phylogenetic analysis
showed that, for each patient with HBV reactivation, all
the isolates were originated from a unique parental
virus. Specific mutations of PreS/S, Core and X regions
were observed.
