Isolation of xylose isomerases by sequence- and
function-based screening from a soil
metagenomic library
Nádia Skorupa Parachin1,2 and Marie F Gorwa-Grauslund1*

Abstract
Background: Xylose isomerase (XI) catalyses the isomerisation of xylose to xylulose in bacteria and some fungi.
Currently, only a limited number of XI genes have been functionally expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the
microorganism of choice for lignocellulosic ethanol production. The objective of the present study was to search
for novel XI genes in the vastly diverse microbial habitat present in soil. As the exploitation of microbial diversity is
impaired by the ability to cultivate soil microorganisms under standard laboratory conditions, a metagenomic
approach, consisting of total DNA extraction from a given environment followed by cloning of DNA into suitable
vectors, was undertaken.
Results: A soil metagenomic library was constructed and two screening methods based on protein sequence
similarity and enzyme activity were investigated to isolate novel XI encoding genes. These two screening
approaches identified the xym1 and xym2 genes, respectively. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that
the genes shared 67% similarity and belonged to different bacterial groups. When xym1 and xym2 were
overexpressed in a xylA-deficient Escherichia coli strain, similar growth rates to those in which the Piromyces XI gene
was expressed were obtained. However, expression in S. cerevisiae resulted in only one-fourth the growth rate of
that obtained for the strain expressing the Piromyces XI gene.
Conclusions: For the first time, the screening of a soil metagenomic library in E. coli resulted in the successful
isolation of two active XIs. However, the discrepancy between XI enzyme performance in E. coli and S. cerevisiae
suggests that future screening for XI activity from soil should be pursued directly using yeast as a host.

Background
The soil habitat is an immensely diverse environment.
One gram of soil may harbour up to ten billion bacteria
belonging to more than 4,000 to 7,000 different species
[1], although this value varies according to the soil type
[2]. However, only 1% of the soil bacterial flora can be
cultivated under standard laboratory conditions [3].
Metagenomics, which consists of the extraction, cloning
and analysis of the entire genetic material in a given
habitat [4,5], has emerged as a tool for assessing the
genetic information from uncultivable microorganisms.
Metagenomic libraries are a powerful source for discovering new biological activities and have already been

successfully used to isolate novel hydrolytic enzymes
such as amylases, cellulases and xylanases [6,7].
The screening of metagenomic libraries, which is a
critical step for the successful isolation of new and
improved biological activities, can be performed by
sequence homology or activity-based assays [8]. In
sequence-based screening, the isolation of novel proteins
is based on homology searches. Although it impedes the
discovery of entirely new gene sequences, it is an efficient method of isolating enzymes with different levels
of similarity from previously identified genes. For
instance, sequence-based screening from the metagenome of a hindgut microbiota of a wood-feeding higher
termite identified 700 domains with homology to the
glycoside-hydrolase catalytic site [9]. In activity-based
assays, metagenomic libraries are constructed in expression vectors to allow for the isolation of biological

activities from entirely new gene sequences that are also
successfully expressed in the chosen host.
Activity-based screening methods have been categorized into chromogenic, product detection and growth
test assays [10]. Chromogenic assays are commonly
used for the detection of hydrolases from metagenomic
libraries [6,7], whereas a product detection method has
been utilized for the identification of enzymes from a
soil metagenome producing porphyrin intermediates
[11]. Although it is a high-throughput method,
growth-based screening has not been frequently
described, as it may be difficult to develop and implement a selection protocol that clearly discriminates
growth from nongrowth.
Metagenomic libraries have not yet been utilized for
the isolation of novel genes involved in xylose catabolism. Xylose is the second most abundant sugar in nature, and the production of cost-efficient lignocellulosic
bioethanol requires its complete fermentation [12]. One
xylose catabolic pathway is found in naturally xylose-utilizing bacteria [13] and some fungi [14,15] and includes
the isomerisation of xylose to xylulose via xylose isomerase (XI). High ethanol yields from xylose have been
reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains harbouring
actively expressed XI genes [15-18].
In this study, the possibility of isolating xylose catabolic enzymes from a soil metagenomic library was evaluated. Both sequence-based and growth-based screening
were utilized. Each method resulted in the isolation of a
novel gene sequence coding for a XI. Restoration of
growth on xylose was verified in both Escherichia coli
and S. cerevisiae strains by overexpression of the isolated
genes in strains lacking the initial xylose catabolic pathway. The advantages and disadvantages of the two
screening methods are discussed.

Results
Isolation of XI genes from soil metagenome

A soil metagenomic library with an estimated size of
1.26 × 105 clones was constructed in plasmid pRSETB
(Table 1) using DNA extracted from garden compost
and screened for XI activity using either sequence analysis or growth assays.
For the sequence-based screening, degenerate primers
were designed based on the alignment of amino acid
sequences of known XIs from soil microorganisms such
as Streptomyces sp. and Rhizobium sp. Amino acid
sequences of XI genes whose expression has been
attempted in S. cerevisiae, such as the ones from Piromyces sp. [14] and E. coli [19], were also included
(Figure 1). The first polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was performed with primers DF1 and DR2 (Table 2)
and with the soil metagenomic library used as a template. A fragment of approximately 750 bp was

alignments of XI amino acid sequences. The microorganisms chosen, in presented order, are Piromyces sp., Streptomyces diastaticus, Escherichia
coli, Pseudomonas sp., Rhizobium sp., Streptomyces coelicolor, Saccharophagus sp., Enterobacter sp., Mesorhizobium loti and Clostridium sp.

complete gene sequence was then obtained by PCR utilizing the metagenomic library as the template and primers designed to the sequence of the known 350-bp
fragment and in plasmid pRSETB. The gene sequence
encoded a 443-amino acid protein with 83% identity
with Sorangium cellulosum XI and was designated xym1.
For the activity screening, the metagenomic library
was transferred to the host strain HB101 (Table 1) that
has a nonfunctional xylA, which allows selection for
growth on xylose. After bacterial transformation, cells
were plated in defined media supplemented with xylose
and incubated at 37°C for four to ten days. Positive
(pRSETB-Xi Piromyces) and negative (pRSETB) controls
were also transformed into the screening strain and plated in selective media to validate the screening method.
Plasmids were extracted and sequenced from colonies
that grew on the selective media. All extracted plasmids
contained identical inserted fragments with an insert
size of approximately 2.5 kb. Sequencing analysis
revealed a complete open reading frame that corresponded to a XI gene named xym2. xym2 encoded a

protein of 442 amino acids with 73% similarity to the XI
from Robiginitalea biformata and 67% identity with
xym1-encoded XI. A phylogenetic tree constructed
using MEGA4 software [20] and 22 different XI amino
acid sequences revealed that xym1-encoded XI was most
similar to XIs from the Proteobacteria, while xym2encoded XI was more similar to the XIs from members
of the Bacterioides phylum (Figure 2).
Growth evaluation in E. coli

The xym1 and xym2 genes and the positive control xylA
gene from Piromyces [14] were each cloned into the
multicopy vector pRSETB, generating plasmids pRSETBXym1, pRSETB-Xym2 and pRSETB-XiPiromyces (Table
1). Strain HB101 was transformed with each of the
three constructs, as well as the negative control
pRSETB, to generate the four strains: TMB2010 (negative control), TMB2011 (Piromyces xylA), TMB2012
(xym1) and TMB2013 (xym2).
Growth was evaluated for the four strains in SM3
liquid media with xylose. Growth with xylose as the sole

carbon source was reestablished for all strains overexpressing any of the XI-encoding genes (Figure 3). No
significant differences in growth rates and final Optical
density (OD) were observed between the positive control strain, TMB2011, and the strains overexpressing
xym1 and xym2 that were isolated from the metagenomic library (Figure 3).
Growth evaluation in S. cerevisiae

XI is a key enzyme for the construction of recombinant
S. cerevisiae strains for xylose conversion to ethanol.
However, despite many efforts [19,21-24], only a few XI
genes have been successfully expressed in S. cerevisiae at
sufficient levels to allow growth on xylose [15,16,25].
Therefore, xym1 and xym2 were overexpressed in S. cerevisiae to assess growth in a recombinant S. cerevisiae
strain lacking the initial xylose catabolic pathway. xym1,
xym2 and the xylA gene from Piromyces sp. (positive
control) were cloned in the multicopy vector p426TEF

to generate plasmids p246TEFXiPiromyces, p426TEFXym1 and p426TEF-Xym2 (Table 1). The S. cerevisiae
screening strain TMB3044 that has been optimised for
efficient pentose utilization, but which lacks the initial
conversion step from xylose to xylulose [26], was transformed with the three constructed plasmids in addition
to the empty plasmid to generate strains TMB3363
(empty plasmid), TMB3359(XiPiromyces), TMB3364
(xym1) and TMB3365 (xym2). No growth was observed
for the negative control. In contrast, overexpression of
both xym1 and xym2 enabled growth on xylose in S.
cerevisiae (Figure 4). However, the strains carrying either
xym1or xym2 grew at a lower growth rate (0.021 hour-1
for both strains) than the positive control harbouring
Piromyces sp XI (0.069 hour-1 ± 0.006) (Figure 4).

the same range as the ranges for the xym1-overexpressing strain and the positive control in E. coli. In contrast, the specific activity in the xym2-overexpressing
strain was at the level of the background activity in S.

were included for comparison with the strains overexpressing either xym1 or xym2.
In S. cerevisiae, the background activity measured in

high as that measured in E. coli (0.059 U/mg protein-1)
(Figure 5). Strains overexpressing the positive control or

Discussion
In this study, for the first time, two screening methods
were established in parallel for the isolation of novel XIencoding genes from a soil metagenomic library. The
sequence-based method using degenerate primers
deduced from the alignment of amino acid sequences of
several XIs from soil microorganisms rapidly resulted in
the isolation of the first XI-encoding gene xym1 from a
metagenomic library. Growth-based screening was also
used for the first time to isolate the XI-encoding gene
xym2 from soil metagenomic library using an E. coli
strain lacking XI activity. The two different methods
resulted in the isolation of two XI-encoding genes that
shared 67% identity at the protein level and could both
complement E. coli and S. cerevisiae strains lacking a
xylose catabolic enzyme.
Some examples where the sequence-based screening
method has already been used include (1) the identification of genes responsible for the hydrolytic dehalogenation of 4-chlorobenxoate from a metagenomic library
constructed from a denitrifying, degrading consortium
[27] and (2) the isolation of a polyketide synthase gene
from a metagenome constructed from marine sediment
in the East China Sea [28]. It is a high-throughput
screening method, but one disadvantage is that it selects
for gene sequences with close homology to those

utilized for the design of the degenerate primers. This
was notably exemplified by the isolation of closely
related chitinase genes from cultured and uncultured
marine bacteria [29].
In contrast, activity-based screening permits the identification of previously unknown gene sequences, as the
screening is based on the gene product only. One disadvantage, however, is that activity-based screening that
relies on chromogenic or fluorogenic assays often
require high-throughput equipment, such as colony
pickers, that transfer colonies from plates to the assay
system. When possible, it is therefore advisable to
develop a growth-based screening method because the
method is simple (each library can be plated on a limited number of plates, as very few clones will grow) and
enables high-throughput (only the clones displaying the
desired activity are able to grow). This method is limited
in that a host strain or an experimental setup must be
designed that does not enable the host to grow unless
the desired activity is present.
Screening by growth has previously been used to isolate genes from a soil metagenomic library conferring
Na+(Li+)/H+ antiporter activity to an antiporter-deficient
E. coli host strain [30]. Novel DNA polymerase activities
have also been isolated from glacial ice metagenomic
libraries using a cold-sensitive E. coli strain that harboured a mutation in the DNA polymerase domain generating lethality at temperatures below 20°C [31].
Finally, a novel D-3-hydroxybutyrate short-chain dehydrogenase with less than 35% similarity to known proteins with similar activity has been isolated from soil
metagenomic libraries using a mutant of Sinorhizobium
meliloti that was unable to synthesize D-3-hydroxybutyrate [32]. In the present study, xym1- and xym2-encoded
XIs displayed strong similarity in amino acid sequence,
although they were isolated by using different methodologies. This may be explained by the fact that most of

Page 6 of 10

the XI sequences that were used to identify homologous
regions for the sequence-based screening originated
from organisms that were know to be present in soil.
Screening for XI-encoding genes by growth versus
nongrowth was successfully implemented in E. coli,
since the expression of xym1 and xym2 genes could
restore growth in xylose minimal media with the same
growth rate observed for the positive control overexpressing the Piromyces XI gene. However, growth was
restored when the same genes were transferred to the
heterologous host S. cerevisiae, where the activity is
required for xylose fermentation to ethanol, the growth
rate was four times lower than that observed for Piromyces XI. Expression of XI-encoding genes in S. cerevisiae is a complex issue [33]. The first one to be
expressed at high levels in S. cerevisiae was Piromyces
XI [18], and it occurred after many unsuccessful
attempts and limited success with several other bacterial
and plant XIs [19,21-24]. Successful expression of XI in
S. cerevisiae and its growth rate on xylose are not always
correlated to sequence similarity or enzymatic activity
(Table 3). In our case, xym1-encoded XI had the same
XI activity as Piromyces sp XI, but the growth rate was
fourfold lower. In contrast, the specific activity of the
xym2-encoded XI was in the range of the background
activity, but the growth rate was identical to the strain
expressing xym1. The growth rate was also in the same
range when the Xanthomonas campestris XI gene was
expressed, although the reported activity range was
about 20 times lower than that for the xym1-overexpressing strain (Table 3). Finally, a high activity level and
growth rate were achieved when overexpressing a
codon-optimised XI gene from Clostridium phytofermentans that shared only 54% similarity with Piromyces
sp. at the protein level (Table 3) [16]. Differences in
kinetic properties may also explain the discrepancies
among all these results. For instance, the affinity for
xylose may be much higher in xym2- than in xym1encoded XI, so that the lower rate of conversion would
be compensated for by a higher affinity for the substrate.
Alternatively, the novel XI may be more inhibited by
xylitol than the one from Piromyces sp. or C. phytofermentans. We were not able to measure Km or Ki for the
new XIs, because the activities were below the detection
limit. Transport may also explain differences in behaviour between S. cerevisiae and E. coli, since active
xylose transporters are present in E. coli [34,35] but
missing in S. cerevisiae.
E. coli has been the preferred choice as the host for
screening metagenomic libraries [6] because numerous
molecular tools are available and E. coli genetics are
well elucidated. In our case, E. coli had the additional
advantage that it is naturally able to utilize xylose, allowing the isolation of the desired activity without any

other limitation up- or downstream of XI. The use of
only one host, however, may limit the exploitation of
microbial diversity for a given habitat due to, for
instance, differences in codon utilization and/or mRNA
and protein stability among different hosts. E. coli was,
for instance, estimated to express only 40% of genes
from diverse microbial origin [36]. In a previous study
where growth-based screening was utilized for the isolation of novel D-3-hydroxybutyrate short-chain dehydrogenases from the soil metagenomic library, 25 positive
clones were initially isolated when the library was
screened in Sinorhizobium melioti; however, only one
clone complemented the same phenotype in E. coli [32].
Screening of a soil metagenomic library performed in
six different bacterial hosts identified only one case
where the molecule-producing clone could be isolated
using two different hosts [37].
Further screening of the soil metagenomic library
described in this study should be performed in S. cerevisiae to investigate more suitable XIs for ethanol production from xylose. This is complicated by the fact that,
whereas in bacterial metagenomic libraries large fragments are cloned and theoretically all genes within the
fragment are transcribed and translated, only the closest
gene to the methylated cap on the 5’ terminus of the
mRNA is translated in yeast [38]. Construction of future
libraries for use in yeast will have to combine the

cloning of small fragments corresponding to single gene
size with an efficient transformation protocol to accommodate the larger colony numbers required to represent
the same soil population. Alternatively, construction and
screening of metagenomic cDNA libraries may be
attempted; however, neither of these strategies has yet

Conclusions
In the present study, a soil metagenomic library was
successfully constructed and screened for the first time
by using sequence- and growth-based methods to isolate
genes conferring xylose isomerase activity. It enabled
the isolation of xym1 and xym2 genes, respectively, that
shared 67% identity at the protein level. Both genes
could restore growth in E. coli and S. cerevisiae strains
lacking the initial xylose catabolic pathway. However,
the limited growth rates in S. cerevisiae highlight the
importance of screening for XI activity in this host
instead.
Methods
Plasmids and strains

Plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in
Table 1. Strains were stored as recommended by the
manufacturer or as 20% glycerol stocks in liquid media
at -80°C.

Cultivation conditions

E. coli strains were plated in Luria broth (LB) media
plates (10 g/L Tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract and 10 g/L
NaCl, agar 15 g/L) and grown at 37°C overnight. Antibiotics were added when necessary to a final concentration of 30 μg/mL kanamycin and 50 μg/mL ampicillin
and streptomycin. Single E. coli colonies were inoculated
in LB media (10 g/L Bacto Tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract
and 10 g/L NaCl) for approximately 12 hours at 37°C in
an incubator with constant agitation at 180 rpm (Boule
Medical AB, Stockholm, Sweden).
For the metagenomic library screening, cells were plated in defined SM3 media [39] supplemented with 11 g/
L xylose, 15 g/L agar, 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and 50 μg/ml ampicillin.
S. cerevisiae strains were grown on yeast nitrogen base
(YNB) media plates (6.7 g/L Difco YNB without amino
acids; Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) supplemented with 20 g/L glucose and 20 g/L agar.
For growth kinetics on xylose, E. coli recombinant
strains were pregrown in 20 mL of LB media at 180
rpm and 30°C until the end of the exponential phase.
Cells were washed in distilled water and transferred to
500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of SM3
media supplemented with 30 g/L xylose and 1 mM
IPTG at a starting OD620nm = 0.1.
S. cerevisiae strains were pregrown in 500-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of YNB medium supplemented with 20 g/L glucose at 180 rpm and 30°C for
approximately 12 hours. Cells were washed in distilled
water and inoculated at OD 620nm = 0.2 in 100 mL of
YNB medium supplemented with 50 g/L xylose in 1-L
Erlenmeyer flasks and grown at 180 rpm and 30°C.
Standard molecular procedures

Standard DNA manipulation techniques were used [40].
Restriction and ligation enzymes were purchased from
Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Primers were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). DNA extraction from agarose gels and
purification of PCR products were performed using the
QIAquick extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilder, Germany).
Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Bio-Rad Miniprep
Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed at Eurofins MWG Operon. If not otherwise stated, bacterial transformation was performed by heat
shock with competent cells prepared by using the Inoue
Method for Preparation and Transformation of Competent E. coli as previously described [41]. Yeast transformation was performed as previously described [42].
Construction of the soil metagenomic library

Soil DNA was extracted from the upper layer of a garden in Höör, southern Sweden, during Spring 2008.

DNA extraction was performed using the PowerSoil
DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Isolated
DNA was digested with BamHI and MboI. Agarose gel
electrophoresis was performed for purification of DNA
fragments ranging between 2.0 and 6.0 kb to generate a
small insert library with an average size of 4.0 kb. Vector pRSETB was digested with BamHI and treated with
alkaline phosphatase to prevent plasmid self-ligation.
DNA fragments were ligated into pRSETB. Bacterial
transformation was performed with ElectroTen-Blue
competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The library size
was estimated on the basis of the total number of E. coli
clones minus the ones with empty plasmid.
Cloning and expression of xym1, xym2 and XI from
Piromyces sp

The isolated isomerase genes were cloned both into E. coli
and S. cerevisiae expression vectors. The xym1 gene was
amplified with primers XYM1F and XYM1R, which contain restriction sites for BamHI and SalI, respectively
(Table 2). After PCR, both the amplified gene and plasmids pRSETB and p426TEF were digested. Plasmids with
inserts obtained after ligation and bacterial transformation
were sequenced and named pRSETB-Xym1 and p426TEFXym1, respectively (Table 1). Cloning of the xym2 gene
followed the same procedure as for xym1, with the exception that EcoRI and SalI restriction sites were used. xym1
and xym2 sequences will be publicly available when the
corresponding patent application is published.
A codon-optimised version of the XI-encoding gene
from Piromyces sp. was amplified by PCR utilizing plasmid YeplacHXT-XI as template [26]: forward primer 5’
GGAGGATCCATGGCTAAGGAATATTTTCCACAA
ATTC 3’ and reverse primer 5’ TTGGAATTCTTACTG
ATACATTGCAACAATAGCTTCG 3’. Restriction sites
for BamHI and EcoRI are underlined in the forward and
reverse primers, respectively. Plasmid p426TEF [43],
pRSETB (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the PCR
product were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then
ligated. Clones with inserts were sequenced prior to
yeast transformation.
Enzyme activities

S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YNB medium supplemented with 20 g/L glucose at 30°C to the early stationary phase. E. coli strains were pregrown in LB media
supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for about 5
hours. After that, cells were washed with water and
inoculated for an initial OD620 nm = 0.2 in SM3 medium
supplemented with 10 g/L glucose and 1 mM IPTG at
37°C overnight.
Yeast and bacteria strains were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 minutes and washed once with

Parachin and Gorwa-Grauslund Biotechnology for Biofuels 2011, 4:9

distilled water. Wet cells were suspended (0.5 mg/mL)
in Y-per yeast or B-per bacteria extraction protein
reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) in a
2-mL Eppendorf tube and incubated on a turning table
at room temperature for 50 minutes. Cell debris was
spun down for 5 minutes at 16,100 × g (Z160M table
centrifuge; HERMLE Labortechnik, Wehingen, Germany). Protein concentration was determined using
Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce Biotechnology). Bovine serum albumin was used to determine the
standard curve.
XI activity was determined at 30°C using sorbitol
dehydrogenase as previously described [18]. Assays were
performed in a U-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan). Enzyme assays were performed in three
biological replicates.
