Abstract
Background: Because "laws of nature" do not exist in ecology, much of the foundations of
community ecology rely on broad statistical generalisations. One of the strongest generalisations
is the positive relationship between density and distribution within a given taxonomic assemblage;
that is, locally abundant species are more widespread than locally sparse species. Several
mechanisms have been proposed to create this positive relationship, and the testing of these
mechanisms is attracting increasing attention.
Results: We report a strong, but counterintuitive, negative relationship between density and
distribution in the butterfly fauna of Finland. With an exceptionally comprehensive data set (data
includes all 95 resident species in Finland and over 1.5 million individuals), we have been able to
submit several of the mechanisms to powerful direct empirical testing. Without exception, we
failed to find evidence for the proposed mechanisms creating a positive density-distribution
relationship. On the contrary, we found that many of the mechanisms are equally able to generate
a negative relationship.
Conclusion: We suggest that one important determinant of density-distribution relationships is
the geographical location of the study: on the edge of a distribution range, suitable habitat patches
are likely to be more isolated than in the core of the range. In such a situation, only the largest and
best quality patches are likely to be occupied, and these by definition can support a relatively dense
population leading to a negative density-distribution relationship. Finally, we conclude that
generalizations about the positive density-distribution relationship should be made more
cautiously.

Background
Species that are locally abundant tend to be more widespread than species that are locally rare [1,2]. This positive

relationship between density and distribution of species
has been observed in a variety of species assemblages over
a spectrum of spatial scales, and it has been suggested that

it may be almost an universal pattern in ecology [3-6].
However, a few studies document a negative relationship
between density and distribution [7-14] (but see [15]).
Only recently Gaston et al. [5] encouraged ecologists to
pay more attention to the possibility of a negative
relationship.
Nine mechanisms have been proposed to explain the positive relationship between density and distribution
[2,3,14,16-25]. Of these, two are artefactual (sampling
artefact, phylogenetic non-independence) and seven are
ecological (pattern of aggregation, range position, niche
breadth, resource availability, density dependent habitat
selection, dispersal ability and vital rates). Negative relationship between density and distribution can be generated by similar mechanisms that give rise to a positive
relationship, but for substantially different circumstances
and parameter values [5,6]. Below we discuss briefly all of
the mechanisms that can possibly explain the positive
relationship between density and distribution, and evaluate whether they could also generate a negative
relationship.
Sampling artefact
Since low density species are less likely to be detected in
surveys, a positive density-distribution relationship may
result from systematic under-recording of the distribution
of species that occur at low density [2,3,20]. It follows logically that sampling artefact is not expected to generate a
negative density-distribution relationship [5]. However,
there is a possibility that rare species with limited, but
known, distribution face proportionally higher sampling
effort resulting in inflated estimates of their density. When
this is the case, a false negative relationship between density and distribution may be generated.
Phylogenetic non-independence
Both positive and negative density-distribution relationship may result from related species being considered as
independent data points [19,26,27]. However, phylogenetic non-independence may be the causative factor of a
density-distribution relationship only if species density
and distribution are determined by species specific life
history characteristics affected by the common ancestry,
and if there are differences between taxa in their density
and distribution. Phylogenetic non-independence has
been rejected as an explanation for the positive densitydistribution relationship in all previous studies that have
controlled its effects [5,14,25,28,29].
Patterns of aggregation
A positive density-distribution relationship may be generated as a result of an underlying theoretical spatial distribution of individuals. For a given level of aggregation, a
species with more individuals in a given area is expected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/5

to occur in more locations than a species with fewer individuals in the same area [20,24]. However, whether this
purely statistical mechanism can actually cause a positive
density-distribution relationship rather than serves as a
restatement of the relationship in another form, is questionable [29]. This mechanism is unable to generate a negative density – distribution relationship [5].
Range position
Empirical observations suggest that habitat occupancy
and the density of individuals decline when moving along
a gradient from the centre of the species geographical distribution range toward its edge [2,30-32]. Therefore, a
positive density-distribution relationship in any particular
region may result when species are at different positions
relative to the centre of their geographical range [16]. Gaston et al. [5] argued that this mechanism cannot generate
negative density-distribution relationship. More recently,
Hanski [33] has pointed out that if patches are more isolated toward range edges, only the largest or best quality
patches, i.e. those patches that are able to support the
most dense populations, will be occupied. We note that
this may lead into a negative density-distribution
relationship.
Niche breadth
Brown [2] hypothesized that a positive density-distribution relationship arises because species which have an
ability to use a broader range of resources are assumed to
be widespread and more abundant. However, while some
evidence exists that species with greater niche breadth are
more widespread [3,5,34-40], virtually all published studies fail to document a positive interspecific relationship
between niche breadth and abundance (see the reviews in
[5,25]). On the contrary, many species with wide niche
breadth are widely distributed but locally rare [5,25].
However, even if the relationship is commonly and
almost predominantly negative, it is not often significantly different from zero. Nevertheless, it seems that the
relationship between niche breadth and abundance may
in fact generate a negative rather than a positive densitydistribution relationship.
Resource availability
On the assumption that density and distribution of
resources determine the density and distribution of the
species utilizing them, a positive or a negative density-distribution relationship in the resource will generate the
same relationship in the consumer [3,22]. Most of the
density-distribution relationships of the resource are
reported to be positive [2,41].
Density dependent habitat selection
If a species tends to inhabit more habitats when density is
high and fewer when density is low, then locally abundant

Dispersal ability
Metapopulation theory may explain both positive and
negative density-distribution relationships [21]. A positive relationship may arise where a species that has high
density is less likely to go extinct in a given patch than a
species that has lower density, or where dispersal increases
with density, thereby promoting colonization of empty
patches [3,18]. Conversely, a negative relationship may
emerge when the species differ in dispersal ability, since
dispersal can reduce density but increase distribution
[21,33].
Vital rates
If a set of species differs only in respect to its mortality
rate, then species with higher mortality will have a lower
density. Moreover, the species will inhabit fewer patches
than a species with low mortality, leading to a positive
density-distribution [23]. Under rather restricted conditions, the vital rates mechanism could also generate a negative density-distribution relationship [23]; however, to
test this mechanism, population level data on densitydependent birth and death rates are necessary [5].

Here, we will examine the relationship between density
and distribution of Finnish butterflies (Hesperioidea and
Papilionoidea), and test the possible mechanisms affecting this relationship. The density-distribution patterns of
butterflies have been examined in many previous studies,
and if a relationship was found, it was generally positive
[3,14,25,38,45-47]. However, most of the studies were
conducted in the British Isles, thus representing a sort of
pseudoreplication in terms of range of environments and
selection of butterfly species studied. Using density and
distribution data from two extensive butterfly censuses,
we will assess which of the four mechanisms – phylogenetic non-independence, range position, niche breadth
and dispersal ability – are best at explaining the densitydistribution relationship of Finnish butterflies. We will
also discuss the effects of sampling artefact on the densitydistribution relationship.

Results
Density-distribution relationships
A strong negative relationship was detected between the
density and distribution of Finnish butterflies (linear
regression; F 1,93 = 229.97, P < 0.001, r2 = 0.71) (Fig. 1).

species will tend to occupy more habitats and have wider
distributions [17]. At present, there is little evidence for
positive density-dependent habitat selection [5,25].
Instead, some evidence exists for negative densitydependent habitat selection [42-44]. A negative densitydistribution relationship arises when a species has a wider
distribution, i.e. inhabits more habitats, when the density
is low.

Distribution of butterflies
To understand the effects of range position and dispersal
ability on the distribution of the butterflies, we analysed
the data using simple linear regression and with a multiple linear regression to even out correlated effects. In simple linear regressions, both variables had a significant
positive effect on butterfly distribution (Table 1). The
overall multiple linear regression was highly significant (F

2,76 = 121.90, P < 0.001, r = 0.76), and both of the predictor variables had an independent positive effect on the
distribution of the butterflies (Table 2). The relationship
between distribution of the butterflies and both of the
predictor variables are shown in figures 2 and 3.

To study the effect of niche breadth on the distribution of
the butterflies, we analysed the effects of larval specificity
and adult habitat breadth on butterfly distribution using
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. There was no significant interaction between
larval specificity and habitat breadth on butterfly distribution (ANOVA F 4,72 = 1.32, P = 0.270), and thus the interaction term was removed from the analysis. However,
both larval specificity and habitat breadth had a significant effect on butterfly distribution (F 2,76 = 8.20, P <
0.001 and F 2,76 = 12.53, P < 0.001, respectively). A

significant difference was found in the distribution of butterfly species with different habitat breadths. Specialist
butterfly species had smaller distribution than generalist
species (Tukey MD, mean difference = -2.03, SE = 0.40, P
< 0.001), and intermediate species had smaller distribution than generalist species (Tukey MD = -1.24, SE = 0.44,
P = 0.018). Specialist species tended to have smaller dis-

tributions than intermediate species, but the difference
was not significant (Tukey MD = -0.79, SE = 0.35, P =
0.063; Fig. 4). No significant difference was found in the
distribution of monophagous and oligophagous butterfly
species (MD = -0.441, SE = 0.46, P = 0.611). However, the
distribution of the polyphagous butterfly species was
greater than mono- or oligo-phagous species (Tukey MD
= 1.44, SE = 0.36, P < 0.001 and Tukey MD = 1.00, SE =
0.42, P = 0.051, respectively) (Fig. 5).

To study the effect of niche breadth on the density of the
butterflies, we analysed the effects of larval specificity and
adult habitat breadth by ANOVA and Tukey's multiple
comparisons test. No significant interaction was observed
between larval specificity and habitat breadth on butterfly
density (ANOVA F 4,72 = 0.84, P = 0.505), and thus the
interaction term was removed. However, habitat breadth
had a significant main effect on butterfly density (F 2,76 =
8.49, P < 0.001). Specialist species had a greater density
than intermediate (Tukey MD = 1.53, SE = 0.40, P <
0.001) or generalist species (Tukey MD = 1.62, SE = 0.49,
P = 0.003), but there was no significant difference
between intermediate and generalist species (Tukey MD =
0.09, SE = 0.52, P = 0.984; Fig. 8). Larval specificity also
had an overall effect on butterfly density (F 2,76 = 5.63, P =
0.005). Monophagous species had significantly greater
density than polyphagous species (Tukey MD = 1.54, SE =
0.40, P < 0.001). However, Tukey test detected no differences between monophagous and oligophagous, or
between oligophagous and polyphagous species (Tukey
MD = 1.03, SE = 0.52, P = 0.124 and Tukey MD = 0.51, SE
= 0.47, P = 0.526, respectively) (Fig. 9).
Phylogenetic non-independence
Controlling for the phylogenetic non-independence by
using the method of phylogenetically independent contrasts (CAIC) verified that none of the results reported
above were artefacts of treating species as independent
data points. The results with the phylogenetically independent contrasts have been tabulated in Table 5 and
clearly support the previous studies on distribution, abundance or distribution-abundance relationships in which
the phylogenetic non-independence not a causative factor
in any of the results [5,14,25,28,29,39,40,48].

Density of butterflies
In simple linear regressions, both range position and dispersal ability had significant negative effects on the
density of the butterflies (Table 3). The overall multiple
regression of the density of the butterflies on their range
position and dispersal ability was highly significant (F 2,76
= 38.84, P < 0.001; r2 = 0.51), and both the predictor variables had independently negative effects on butterfly
density (Table 4). The relationships between the density
and the predictor variables are depicted in Figures 6 and 7.

Discussion
Density and distribution of butterflies
A positive relationship between the density and distribution of species is expected to be an almost universal pattern in ecology [3-6]. In contrast to this, we found a strong
negative relationship between density and distribution in
Finnish butterflies. Here we will discuss three mechanisms-range position, niche breadth and dispersal ability

along this gradient [2,30]. If these two assumptions are
correct, a positive density-distribution relationship in any
particular region will result when species are at different
positions relative to the centre of their geographical ranges
[16]. However, there is little evidence for the latter of the
two assumptions [31,32]. Moreover, metapopulation
theory suggests that if patches are more isolated toward
range edges, only the largest or best quality patches will be
occupied, i.e. those patches that are able to support the

Range position
According to the range position hypothesis, species are
expected to inhabit increasingly fewer localities when
moving along a gradient from the centre of the species'
geographical distribution range toward the edges of the
range [2,31,32]. In addition, density should also decline

most dense populations [33]. If this is the case, a negative
density-distribution relationship will be observed. In our
study, we found a strong negative relationship between
range position and density indicating that species on the
edge of their geographical distribution are indeed more
abundant on the patches they occupy. To illustrate the
effect of this relationship on the density-distribution relationship, we divided the range position of the butterflies
into three classes (1155 km / 3 = 1 – 385 km, 386 – 770
km and 771 – 1155 km) and plotted these on top of the
density-distribution relationship (Fig. 10). Species on the
edge of their geographical distribution (stars) had the
smallest distribution and highest density, whereas the
species furthest from the edge of their geographical distribution (filled boxes) had the largest distribution and lowest density. Consequently, being at different positions
relative to the centre of the geographical ranges may
indeed cause a negative density-distribution relationship.

Niche breadth
The niche breadth hypothesis predicts that a positive density-distribution relationship arises because species that
are able to use a broader range of resources are widespread
and also have high density [2]. There is evidence of a positive relationship between niche breadth and distribution
[3,5,34-40], but it is difficult to see why wider niche
breadth should lead to higher density [5]. Many studies
have failed to document a positive interspecific relationship between niche breadth and density (see [5,25]. In
fact, most studies summarized in Gaston et al. [5] gave
negative (although not statistically significant)
relationships between niche breadth and density (see also
[25]. In our study, we analysed niche breadth with two
variables, adult habitat breadth and larval feeding specificity. We found that butterfly distribution was strongly
positively related to adult habitat breadth and to larval
feeding specificity, but more interestingly, both variables
were significantly negatively related to density. To illustrate how these relationships may affect the densitydistribution relationship, we plotted both habitat breadth
(Fig. 11) and larval feeding specificity (Fig. 12) on the
density-distribution relationship. These figures illustrate
that the negative density-distribution relationship may be
caused by differences in the niche breadth: habitat specialist species and monophagous species have higher abundance, but simultaneously have smaller distribution, than
habitat generalist or polyphagous species. Based on the
available empirical evidence, it seems that the relationship between distribution and niche breadth is generally
positive [3,5,34-40]. If we accept this to be the case, and
the density-distribution relationship is determined by
niche breadth, then the form of the relationship is caused
by the relationship between density and niche breadth.

According to the metapopulation theory, differences in
dispersal ability of species may generate negative densitydistribution relationships [3,21,33]. If, for any reason,
species differ in their dispersal ability and dispersal ability

on density, a negative density-distribution relationship
will result. We found a strong positive relationship

between dispersal ability and distribution and a strong
negative relationship between dispersal ability and density, which support earlier studies in butterflies
[14,25,40]. We divided the dispersal ability of the
butterflies into three classes (10/3 = 0 – 3.33, 3.34 – 6.66
and 6.67 – 10) and plotted the classes on the density-distribution relationship. Fig. 13 illustrates that species with
the lowest dispersal ability have the highest density but
lowest distribution, while species with the highest
dispersal ability have the lowest density and highest
distribution, leading into the observed negative relationship between density and distribution.

Our study area (Finland) is a long, northern country
extending more than 1100 km from south to north. Many
of the studied butterfly species meet the edge of their
distributional range in Finland. On the edge of a distribution range suitable habitat patches are likely to be more
isolated than in the core of the range. In such a case, only
the largest and best quality patches are likely to be occupied, but because these are the best quality patches, they
may support a relatively dense population [33], leading
into a negative density – distribution relationship. We
suggest that one important determinant of the densitydistribution relationships is the geographical position of
the study area and, therefore, future studies should place
greater emphasis on the comparison of the relationship in
different geographical areas.

relationship are also able to generate a negative relationship. Indeed, it is intriguing that many studies, which
have found a positive density – distribution relationship
have failed to find an ecological mechanism that would
explain the observed pattern. This may not be surprising if
the ecological mechanisms are more likely to generate a
negative rather than positive density – distribution relationship. In support of this view we found a strong negative density-distribution relationship but what is more
important also empirical support for ecological mechanisms that are able to explain the observed pattern.

Data set
Our data is predominantly based on published literature
[49,50] and the results of The National Butterfly Scheme
in Finland (NAFI). We included all 95 butterfly species
that are classified as resident or fluctuating in Finland [50]
and excluded 21 species classified as migratory, irruptive
or extinct [50].

Conclusion
We conclude that many of the ecological mechanisms
proposed to create a positive density-distribution

Distribution of butterflies
The distribution of butterfly species is based on the "Atlas
of Finnish Macrolepidoptera" [50]. This atlas contains
extensive and detailed distribution data of butterflies in
Finland, covering all reliable records and observations of
butterflies from 1747 to 1997 [50]. The data are compiled
from many different sources including c. 1500 literature
references and information extracted from several large
museum and private collections [50]. The distribution
data in the atlas are divided into old observations (before
1988) and new observations (1988 – 1997). We chose to
describe the distribution of butterflies by the new
observations, which represent the current distribution
more accurately and also correspond more favourably
with our density data. Moreover, there was a very strong
positive correlation between distribution of butterflies
based on old and new observations (Pearson correlation:
r = 0.966, n = 95, P < 0.001). We describe the distribution

for a given species as the number of 10 km × 10 km grid
squares on the Finnish national coordinate system from
which the species was recorded during the period 1988 –
1997 [50].
Density of butterflies
The National Butterfly Scheme in Finland (NAFI) is a formal study that was established in 1991 for the purpose of
monitoring the population trends of the butterflies across
the country [51,52]. Monitoring studies may be liable to
sampling biases [53], therefore explicit instructions were
drafted in order to avoid any bias in sampling or reporting
the abundance of butterflies [52]. NAFI provides quantitative abundance data including the 10 km × 10 km grid
square of the Finnish national coordinate system in which
the observation was made, the year, the number of
individuals of each species observed and the number of
observation days [52]. During the first ten-year period
(1991–2000) of NAFI, 432 lepidopterologists participated in the study, providing data on 1 523 989 individuals, representing a total of 106 butterfly species.

To obtain density for each butterfly species per 10 km × 10
km grid square, we divided the total number of individuals of each butterfly species by the number of 10 km × 10
km squares occupied by the species. Some rare butterfly
species with known occurrence sites may face
proportionally higher sampling effort than common
species [53]. To remove the effect of sampling effort on
density, we divided the density by the number of observation days. Note that observation days are the days when
the observer was observing at a given square, and thus
include also days when a given species was not observed.
The number of observation days for each species averaged
20 815, varying between 53 and 50 595 days.
It is possible that size confounds the density and distribution data if larger species are more visible and thus
reported more often than smaller species. We analysed the
possibility that the size of the butterfly species is a confounding factor. There is practically no dimorphism
between the sizes of male and female butterflies.
Therefore, as a size measure we used only the female wing
span reported in Marttila et al. [49], in which the mean of
a sample of 20 females was reported with an exception of
some rare species with fewer individuals measured. We
found no evidence of any size bias: there was no relationship between the female wing span and the density or distribution of the species (linear regression F 1,93 = 0.04; P =
0.835, r2 = 0.00 and F 1,93 = 0.99; P = 0.987, r2 = 0.00,
respectively).
Range position
To determine the range position, we measured the distance (km) between the northernmost distribution record

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/5

and the southernmost point (Hankoniemi) of Finland
from the maps in Huldén et al. (2000). Note that the longest possible range was 1155 km. In analysis including
range position, we only included species, the distribution
range of which begins from southern Finland [50]. Thus,
we excluded the species which occur only in Northern Finland (n = 14, [49]), and two species (Lycaena helle and
Clossiana thore) which do not range to southern Finland.
Niche breadth
We describe the niche breadth for each butterfly species
using two different measures: 1) larval host plant specificity, and 2) the number of habitat types occupied by the
adults. We excluded from this analysis the species which
occur only in Northern Finland (n = 14, [49]). This was
done because their larval host plants are unknown or are
not confirmed and because the habitat types of Northern
Finland are unique compared to other Finnish habitat
types.

The data on larval host plant specificity in Finland are
based on Huldén et al. [50] and Wahlberg [54]. We classified the larval host plant specificity into three classes: (1)
monophages, i.e. species that feed on a single plant species; (2) oligophages, i.e. species that are restricted to one
genus of food plants; and (3) polyphages, i.e., species that
feed on one or more than one family of food plants.
The main habitats that Finnish butterflies occupy have
been categorised into four types [49]: (1) uncultivable
lands (e.g. edge zones beside industrial area, harbour and
storage areas, loading places, uncropped fields, and other
unbuilt areas which have been exposed to human
impact), (2) meadows (many kinds of non-cultivated
open grasslands), (3) forest edges (e.g. road sides), and
(4) bogs. Adult niche breadth is the number of habitat
types in which the adults typically are found. As there
were only two species (Pieris napi and Gonepteryx rhamni)
that occupied all four main habitat types, habitat types
three and four were combined. Value one represents specialist species that are limited to one habitat type, value
two represents intermediate species that occur in two
habitat types, and value three represents generalist species
that occur in three or four habitat types.
Dispersal ability
Metapopulation theory predicts that species with greater
dispersal ability are likely to occupy more habitat patches
than species with lower dispersal ability [3]. To describe
the relative dispersal ability of butterfly species, we
adopted the method described in Cowley et al. [14]. We
sent a questionnaire to experienced lepidopterists in
Finland and asked them to give a "dispersal ability index"
(0–10) for each butterfly species. In the questionnaire, a
zero value indicates that a given butterfly species is

BMC Biology 2005, 3:5

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/3/5

extremely sedentary and a value of ten means that it is
extremely mobile. To obtain a relative dispersal ability for
each butterfly species, we calculated the average dispersal
ability from returned questionnaires (n = 13).
To ensure our measure of dispersal ability is reliable, we
compared our measure with the dispersal ability estimated previously by Bink [55] (nine dispersal ability
classes), Pollard and Yates [56] (three dispersal ability
classes based on mark-release-recapture studies), Cowley
et al. [14] (continuous variable based on questionnaires)
and Cook, Dennis & Hardy [57] (continuous variable
based on vagrancy in grids). The correlations between our
measure and those of Bink [55], Pollard and Yates [56],
Cowley et al. [14] and Cook et al. [57] were all strongly
positive and significant (Pearson correlation; r = 0.672, n
= 73, P < 0.001, ANOVA; F3,27 = 8.74, r = 0.567, P < 0.001,
Pearson correlation; r = 0.703, n = 31, P < 0.001 and Pearson correlation r = 0.602, n = 11, P = 0.050, respectively),
indicating that our dispersal ability is in line with other
independent estimates and thus reliable (see also [58]).
Phylogenetic non-independence
Lack of statistical independence among species for the
traits of interest was tested using the method of
phylogenetically independent contrasts [19] as implemented in the CAIC program [59]. Statistical control of
phylogenetic non-independence requires knowledge of
the phylogeny [19,27]. However, knowledge of the general phylogenetic relationships among butterfly species is
still in a state of flux [60], and there are no studies available that look explicitly at the relationships of species in
Finland. However, the recent surge of published studies
on various groups of butterflies allows us to compile a
likely phylogeny for Finnish butterflies (Fig. 14). We took
the relationships of the butterfly families from [60], the
relationships within Papilionidae from [61], and the
relationships within Nymphalidae from various sources
[62-65]. Relationships within Pieridae, Lycaenidae and
Hesperiidae are based on current taxonomy, with morphologically well-defined groups shown as monophyletic. In the analysis all branch length were assumed
equal because no estimate of evolutionary distance exist
for the entire data set. However this option is justified
under the assumption of punctuated evolution. Regression analysis was used to investigate the standardized
linear contrasts calculated by CAIC [19]. Note that the
regression lines must pass though the origin [66,67].
