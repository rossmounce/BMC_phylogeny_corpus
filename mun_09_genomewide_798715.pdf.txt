Abstract
Background: Brassica rapa is one of the most economically important vegetable crops worldwide.
Owing to its agronomic importance and phylogenetic position, B. rapa provides a crucial reference
to understand polyploidy-related crop genome evolution. The high degree of sequence identity and
remarkably conserved genome structure between Arabidopsis and Brassica genomes enables
comparative tiling sequencing using Arabidopsis sequences as references to select the counterpart
regions in B. rapa, which is a strong challenge of structural and comparative crop genomics.
Results: We assembled 65.8 megabase-pairs of non-redundant euchromatic sequence of B. rapa
and compared this sequence to the Arabidopsis genome to investigate chromosomal relationships,
macrosynteny blocks, and microsynteny within blocks. The triplicated B. rapa genome contains only
approximately twice the number of genes as in Arabidopsis because of genome shrinkage. Genome
comparisons suggest that B. rapa has a distinct organization of ancestral genome blocks as a result
of recent whole genome triplication followed by a unique diploidization process. A lack of the most
recent whole genome duplication (3R) event in the B. rapa genome, atypical of other Brassica
genomes, may account for the emergence of B. rapa from the Brassica progenitor around 8 million
years ago.

Conclusions: This work demonstrates the potential of using comparative tiling sequencing for
genome analysis of crop species. Based on a comparative analysis of the B. rapa sequences and the
Arabidopsis genome, it appears that polyploidy and chromosomal diploidization are ongoing
processes that collectively stabilize the B. rapa genome and facilitate its evolution.

Background

Flowering plants (angiosperms) have evolved in genome size
since their sudden appearance in the fossil records of the late
Jurassic/early Cretaceous period [1-4]. The genome expansion seen in angiosperms is mainly attributable to occasional
polyploidy. Estimation of polyploidy levels in angiosperms
indicates that the genomes of most (>90%) extant
angiosperms, including many crops and all the plant model
species sequenced thus far, have experienced one or more
episodes of genome doubling at some point in their evolutionary history [5,6]. The accumulation of transposable elements
(TEs) has been another prevalent factor in plant genome
expansion. Recent studies on maize, rice, legumes, and cotton
have demonstrated that the genome sizes of these crop species have increased significantly due to the accumulation
and/or retention of TEs (mainly long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs)) over the past few million years; the percentage of the genome made up of transposons is estimated to
be between 35% and 52% based on sequenced genomes [712]. However, genome expansion is not a one-way process in
plant genome evolution. Functional diversification or stochastic deletion of redundant genes by accumulation of mutations in polyploid genomes and removal of LTRs via
illegitimate or intra-strand recombination can result in
downsizing of the genome [13-15]. Nevertheless, neither of
the aforementioned mechanisms has been demonstrated to
occur frequently enough to balance genome size growth, and
plant genomes tend, therefore, to expand over time.
The progress in whole genome sequencing of model genomes
presents an important challenge in plant genomics: to apply
the knowledge gained from the study of model genomes to
biological and agronomical questions of importance in crop
species. Comparative structural genomics is a well-established strategy in applied agriculture in several plant families.
However, comparative analyses of modern angiosperm
genomes, which have experienced multiple rounds of polyploidy followed by differential loss of redundant sequences,
genome recombination, or invasion of LTRs, are characterized by interrupted synteny with only partial gene orthology
even between closely related species, such as cereals [16], legumes [17,18], and Brassica species [19,20]. Furthermore,
functional divergence of duplicated genes limits interpretation of function based on orthology, which complicates
knowledge transfer from model to crop plants. Thus, better
delimitation of comparative genome arrangements reflecting
evolutionary history will allow information obtained from
fully sequenced model genomes to be used to target syntenic
regions of interest and to infer parallel or convergent evolu-

tion of homologs important to biological and agronomical
questions in closely related crop genomes.
The mustard family (Brassicaceae or Cruciferae), the fifth
largest monophyletic angiosperm family, consists of 338 genera and approximately 3,700 species in 25 tribes [21], and is
fundamentally important to agriculture and the environment,
accounting for approximately 10% of the world's vegetable
crop produce and serving as a major source of edible oil and
biofuel [22]. Brassicaceae includes two important model systems: Arabidopsis thaliana (At), the most scientifically
important plant model system for which complete genome
sequence information is available, and the closely related,
agriculturally important Brassica complex - B. rapa (Br, A
genome), B. nigra (Bn, B genome), B. oleracea (Bo, C
genome), and their three allopolyploids, B. napus (Bna, AC
genome), B. juncea (Bj, AB genome), and B. carinata (Bc, BC
genome). Syntenic relationships and polyploidy history in
these two model systems have been investigated, although
details about macro- and microsyntenic relationships
between At and Brassica are limited and fragmented. Previous studies demonstrated broad-range chromosome correspondence between the At and Brassica genomes [23,24],
and a few studies have demonstrated specific cases of conservation of gene content and order with frequent disruption by
interspersed gene loss and genome recombination [19,20].
Although this issue is contentious, there is evidence that
Brassicaceae genomes have undergone three rounds of whole
genome duplication (WGD; hereafter referred to as 1R, 2R,
and 3R, which are equivalent to the γ, β, and α duplication
events) [5,25,26]. One profound finding from comparative
analyses is the triplicate nature of the Brassica genome, indicating the occurrence of a whole genome triplication event
(WGT, 4R) soon after divergence from the At lineage approximately 17 to 20 million years ago (MYA) [19,20,26]. This
result strongly suggests that comparative genomic analyses
using single gene-specific amplicons or those based on small
scale synteny comparisons will fail to identify all related
genome segments, and thus not be able to provide accurate
indications of orthology between the At and Brassica
genomes. However, obtaining sufficient sequence information from Brassica genomes to identify genome-wide orthologous relationships between the At and Brassica genomes is
a major challenge.
Br was recently chosen as a model species representing the
Brassica 'A' genome for genome sequencing [27,28]. This
species was selected because it has already proved a useful
model for studying polyploidy and because it has a relatively

small (approximately 529 megabase-pair (Mbp)) but compact
genome with genes concentrated in euchromatic spaces.
However, widespread repetitive sequences in the Br genome
hinder direct application of whole genome shotgun sequencing. Instead, targeted sequencing of specific regions of the Br
genome could be informed by the reference At genome by
selecting genomic clones based on sequence similarity; this
approach is referred to as comparative tiling [29]. Here, we
report sequencing of large-scale regions of the Br euchromatic genome, covering almost all of the At euchromatic
regions, obtained using the comparative tiling method. We
performed a genome-wide sequence comparison of Br and At
and analyzed the number of substitutions per synonymous
site (Ks) between the two genomes and among related
Brassica sequences to identify syntenic relationships and to
further refine our understanding of the evolution of polyploidy. We also investigated genome microstructure conservation between the two genomes. In this study, we provide a
foundation to reconstruct both the ancestral genome of the
Brassica progenitor and the evolutionary history of the
Brassica lineage, which we anticipate will provide a robust
model for Brassica genomic studies and facilitate the investigation of the genome evolution of domesticated crop species.

The genome coverage of the gene-rich Br sequences was estimated by representation in two different datasets: expressed
sequence tag (EST) sequences and conserved single-copy
genes. Based on a BLAT analysis of 32,395 Br unigenes (a set
of ESTs that appear to arise from the same transcription
locus) against the sequence contigs, the proportion of hits
recovered under stringent conditions (see Materials and
methods) was 29.2%. This result was largely consistent with
the proportion of rosid-conserved single-copy genes showing
matches to Br sequences. A TBLASTN comparison of 1,070
At-Medicago truncatula (Mt) conserved single-copy genes
against Br sequences revealed a 24.3% match. Both methods
indicate approximately 30% coverage of euchromatin in the
dataset analyzed; thus, the euchromatic region of Br is estimated to be approximately 220 Mbp, 42% of the whole
genome given that the genome size of Br is 529 Mbp [30].

Results
Generation of Br euchromatic sequence contigs and
genome coverage
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequence assembly
generated 410 Br sequence contigs (sequences composed of
more than one BAC sequence) covering 65.8 Mbp (Tables S1
and S2 in Additional data file 1). These sequence contigs span
75.3 Mbp of the At genome, representing 92.2% of the total At
euchromatic region (Figure 1 and Table 1). A total of 43.9 Mbp
remain as uncovered gaps: among these, 6.4 Mbp are attributable to euchromatin gaps, and the remaining 37.5 Mbp to
pericentromeric heterochromatin gaps.

Characteristics of the B. rapa gene space
Gene annotation was carried out using our specialized Br
annotation pipeline. Gene prediction of the Br sequence data
using a variety of ab initio, similarity-based, and EST/fulllength cDNA-based methods resulted in the construction of
15,762 gene models. Taken together with the genome coverage of Br sequences, the overall number of protein-coding
genes in the Br genome is at least 52,000 to 53,000, which is
higher than those of other plant genomes sequenced thus far,
including At [7], rice (Oryza sativa (Os)) [8], poplar (Populus
trichocarpa (Pt)) [9], grape [10], papaya [11], and sorghum
[12]. However, the estimated total number of genes in the Br
genome is only twice that of At. Details of the annotation are
available online at the URL cited in the 'Data used in this
study' section in the Materials and methods.
The gene structure and density statistics are shown in Table
2. The base composition of Br and At genes is very similar.
The average length of Br genes (ATG to stop codon) is 73%
that of At genes. This is consistent with previous reports on

Bo [19,20,26]. This difference appears to be due to one less
exon per gene and shorter exon and intron lengths in Br. The
average gene density of 1 per 4.2 kilobase-pairs (kbp) in Br is
slightly lower than that in At (1 per 3.8 kbp). Thus, the At/Br
ratio of gene density is 0.90, indicating slightly less compact
organization of Br euchromatin than At euchromatin. Moreover, the distance between the homologous block endpoints
in Br and At has an R2 of 0.63 with a dAt/dBr slope of 1.36
(Figure S1 in Additional data file 2). This result indicates that
gene-containing regions in At occupy approximately 30 to
40% more space than their Br counterparts. Based on these
data and the results mentioned above, we postulate that the
euchromatic genome of Br has shrunken by approximately
30% compared to its syntenic At counterpart. Most of the
genome shrinkage in Br could be explained by the deletion of
roughly one-third of the redundant proteome as well as TEs
in the euchromatic Br genome. Only 14% of the Br genes were
tandem duplicates compared with 27% of At genes in a 100kbp window interval. In addition, only 45 nucleotide binding
site-encoding genes were identified in Br, suggesting that the
total number of nucleotide binding site-encoding genes in the
Br genome is likely to be almost the same as that in At
(approximately 200) [31,32]. A database search revealed that
a total of 12,802 (81%) of the predicted Br genes have similarity (<E-10) to proteins in the non-redundant nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI); 2,960 (19%) are Br unique genes. To assess the putative function of the genes that recorded no hits to non-redundant proteins, we assigned functional categories to the Br
unique genes using gene ontology analysis; however, this
analysis could not identify a putative function for approximately 85% of the Br unique genes. Thus, we can conclude
that 16% of the proteome of Br has acquired a novel function
since the Br-At divergence.

using BLASTP analysis, and putative synteny blocks were
plotted using DiagHunter and GenoPix2D programs [36].
The non-redundant chromosome-ordered genome sequence
in the Br build was 62.5 Mbp. An additional 3.2 Mbp had not
yet been assigned to chromosomes and was therefore not
used for synteny analysis. We examined the synteny blocks at
three different levels: whole genome (Figure 2a), large-scale
synteny blocks in chromosome-to-chromosome windows
(Figure 2b; Additional data file 3), and microsynteny <2.5
Mbp (the synteny can be viewed at the URL cited in the 'Data
used in this study' section in the Materials and methods).
Although the Br genome build was partial and incomplete
with only approximately 30% of euchromatin represented
and some misordered contigs present, the level of synteny
between the genomes was prominent and distinct. The DiagHunter program detected 227 highly homologous syntenic
blocks with 72% of the sequenced and anchored Br sequence
assigned to synteny blocks in At and 72% of At euchromatic
sequence assigned to synteny blocks in Br when multiple
blocks overlapping the same region were counted (Figure 2a).
Considering the history of frequent genome duplication
events in Brassicaceae, this result strongly indicates the presence of secondary or tertiary blocks resulting from WGT.

Repetitive sequence analysis revealed that 6% of euchromatic
Br sequences are composed of TEs, a twofold greater amount
than identified in the counterpart At euchromatic genome,
presumably due to a greater number of LTRs and long interspersed elements (Table 3). In addition, low complexity
repetitive sequences are relatively abundant in the Br euchromatic region, indicating Br-specific expansion of repetitive
sequences. The distribution of repetitive sequences and TEs
along the chromosomes was not uneven (Figure S2 in Additional data file 2). It has previously been reported, based on
partial draft genome shotgun sequences, that Bo (approximately 696 Mbp) has a significantly higher proportion of both
class I and class II TEs sequences than At [33]. Taken
together with these previous reports [34,35], TEs appear to be
partly responsible for genome expansion in the Brassica lineage, and these TEs appear to accumulate predominantly in
the heterochromatic regions of Br.

Synteny between the B. rapa and A. thaliana genomes
To identify syntenic regions in the Br and At genomes, we
compared the whole proteome between the two genomes

Volume 10, Issue 10, Article R111

Mun et al. R111.4

The Br and At genomes share a minimum of 20 large-scale
synteny blocks with substantial microsynteny; these synteny
blocks extend the length of whole chromosome arms. At
shows synteny of chromosome arms with multiple chromosome blocks of Br, apparently corresponding to triplicated
remnants (Figure 2b). At1S (short arm), At2L (long arm),
At4L, and At5 have three long-range synteny counterparts in
three independent Br chromosomes. However, At1L and At3
have only one or two synteny blocks in the Br genome. Moreover, some genome regions of At, including a smaller section
of At2S and At4S, show no significant synteny with Br counterparts, indicating chromosome-level deletion of triplicated
segments. Incidentally, Br shows synteny with a major single
chromosome along almost the entire length (A1, A2, A4, and
A10) or fragments of multiple At chromosomes in a complicated mosaic pattern, indicating frequent recombination of
Br chromosomes. Notable regions of synteny are shown in
Figure 2b, and are At1S-A6/A8/A9, At1L-A7, At2L-A3/A4/
A5, At3S-A3/A5, At3L-A7/A9, At4L-A1/A3/A8, and At5-A2/
A3/A10 (synteny view available at the URL cited in the 'Data
used in this study' section in the Materials and methods.
Additional synteny blocks scattered throughout genome
regions, probably due to recombination, were also identified.
Within individual synteny blocks, microsynteny (conservation of gene content and order) was considerable. The average
degree of proteome conservation for all predicted synteny
blocks was 52 ± 13% in the blocks (Table S3 in Additional data
file 1). This value is almost the same as that of the Mt-Lotus
japonicus comparison in which an ancient WGD event at a
similar time period (Ks 0.7 to 0.9) as the Br-At WGD but earlier speciation (Ks 0.6) than Br-At was detected [18]. The

In silico allocation of 410 B. rapa BAC sequence contigs to A. thaliana chromosomes. BAC sequence contigs (blue bars) were aligned to At chromosomes
based on significant and directional matches of sequences using a BLASTZ cutoff of <E-6.

underestimated value reported here presumably reflects significant gene loss and rearrangement after WGT in the Br lineage resulting in genome shrinkage, based on the fact that
deletion events in syntenic blocks of the Br genome were twofold more frequent than in the At genome. Genes without corresponding homologs in syntenic regions contributed to 15 ±

7% of all genes from Br but 33 ± 13% from At (Table S3 in
Additional data file 1; Additional data file 3). Genes encoding
proteins involved in transcription or signal transduction were
not found to be significantly more retained in syntenic blocks
than those encoding proteins classified as having other func-

[23,37-39]. According to the At-AK relationship and pair
information of Br-At synteny blocks, we defined conserved
genome building blocks of AK on the Br genome build (Figure
3; Additional data file 4). The pattern of block boundaries on
Br chromosomes was similar to that reported pattern for Bna
'A' genome components, albeit more complicated (Figure S3
in Additional data file 2). Most of the block boundaries were
conserved between Br and the 'A' genome components of Bna
with the exception of several insertions/deletions; this is presumably due to limited sequence and marker information. In
addition, inversion or serial mismatched block boundaries
were found on A2, A7 and A9, respectively, suggesting recombination of homologous counterpart regions between the 'A'
and 'C' genomes in Bna.

Rearrangement of the B. rapa genome
Comparison of the genomes of Br and At allows insight into
the origin and evolution of the Brassica 'A' genome. Previous
comparative mapping studies have identified a putative
ancestral karyotype (AK) comprising 24 building blocks on 8
chromosomes from which the current Arabidopsis and
Brassica genomes have evolved via fusion/fission, rearrangement, and deletion of chromosomes followed by polyploidy

An examination of the Br genome from the perspective of
ancestral blocks reveals that three copies of the genome are
present, as predicted from the WGT (Figure 3). Although
there are several discontinuous matches due to gaps between
syntenic blocks, almost 50% of the ancestral blocks were triplicated in the Br genome, while others occurred only once or
twice, indicating loss of blocks during genome rearrangement. Blocks D, G, and M could not be found on the Br
genome. The Br genome is highly rearranged relative to At
compared with AK. Block R was localized together with block
W in triplicate regions (A2, A3, and A10). However, in At5,
blocks R and W were separated on the short arm and long
arm, respectively [38,39]. Similarly, blocks E and N were
adjacent and triplicated in Br but separated in At. Meanwhile,
blocks K and L, which are fused in AK but split in different
chromosomes of At, were adjacent (A6) or separated (A9) on
the same chromosomes of Br. However, we did not determine
precisely which copy of the replicated AK block family corresponds to the Br BACs because of the possibility that Br
sequences in the polyploid genome were not accurately positioned. Because several genetic markers originate from duplicate or triplicate regions of the Br genome, the true location
of the BACs could correspond to any of the amplified bands,
which could result in inaccurate mapping of the BAC
sequence. In this case, the resulting assignment of the BAC to
an incorrect linkage group on a specific AK block family member would also be flawed; however, we found that almost all
BAC sequences showed excellent correspondence to the correct family of AK blocks. Further analysis, including chromosome painting and additional genome sequencing, will allow
determination of the precise location of AK blocks in the Br
genome.

Loss of genes from the recent duplication event in the
B. rapa genome
To deduce the approximate time point of polyploidy and speciation, we compared the distribution of synonymous substitution (Ks) in homologous sequences identified by a
reciprocal best BLAST hit search between Br and the completely annotated sequences of At, Pt, Mt, and Os. As shown
in Figure 4a-c, Br shares a single ancient duplication event

Coverage was calculated as the gene number of an individual chromosome per sum of genes with BLASTP hits. Note that the overall coverage of an
individual chromosome for the counterpart genome can exceed 100% because multiple best BLAST hits over the same region are counted. (b)
Chromosome correspondence between B. rapa and A. thaliana represented by a dot-plot. Each dot represents a reciprocal best BLASTP match between
gene pairs at an E-value cutoff of <E-20. Red dots show regions of synteny with more than 50% gene conservation as identified by DiagHunter. Some Br
chromosome orientations have been flipped (A1f, A3f, A7f) to visually correspond to At orientations. Both Br and At have been scaled to occupy the same
lengths. Color bars on the upper and left margins of the dot plot indicate individual chromosomes of At and Br, respectively. Black dots on the At
chromosomes are centromeres. The color-shaded boxes in the dot plots represent long-range synteny blocks along chromosome pairs. Boxes with the

(1R) with Os, Pt, and Mt as illustrated by single peaks at Ks
modes of 2.5 to 2.6, 2.2 to 2.3, and 1.8 to 1.9, respectively,
indicating successive splitting of the Br lineage from monocots and eurosid I during the early and late Cretaceous period
around 60 to 120 MYA, depending on the neutral substitution
rate used [40]. The age distributions of At and Br yield clear
peaks corresponding to 2R at Ks = 1.7 to 1.8 and 1.8 to 1.9,
respectively, lower than that of the Br-Pt comparison but similar to that of the Br-Mt comparison (Figure 4e, f). This suggests that an ancient burst of gene duplications due to the 2R
event in At and Br must have occurred almost immediately
after divergence between eurosid I and eurosid II. Taken
together with recent studies of the Pt [9] and Mt genomes
[18], we conclude that genome duplication in rosids occurred
independently after the split from the last common rosid
ancestor, and that most polyploidy events (2R, 3R, and 4R) in
Brassicaceae postdate the eurosid I (Pt and Mt)-eurosid II (At
and Br) divergence.
The Ks distribution for At and Br orthologs displayed two
peaks at Ks = 0.3 to 0.4 and 2.0 to 2.1, corresponding to
shared duplication events (3R and 2R) and speciation
between the genomes at around 13 to 17 MYA (Figure 4d). As
reported before, the oldest duplication (1R) could not be seen
in the Ks distributions in both genomes. Surprisingly, a comparison of the Ks mode for the paralogs in At and Br identified
remarkable differences in the duplicated genes retained in the
two genomes. Furthermore, the At genome has two clear
peaks for 3R (mode Ks = 0.6 to 0.7) and 2R (mode Ks = 1.7 to
1.8). However, in the Br genome, two peaks representing 4R
(mode Ks = 0.2 to 0.3) and 2R (mode Ks = 1.8 to 1.9) are evident, but the 3R peak has collapsed (Figure 4e, f). The difference between the distributions for Br-Br versus Br-At (P =
1.65E-8) was significantly higher than that for At-At versus
Br-At (P = 0.001). Taken together, these findings suggest that
duplicated genes produced by the 3R event were widely lost in
the triplicated Br genome.
Because we used approximately 30% of the euchromatic
sequence of Br, we could have underestimated the 3R event
due to biased sampling. To test this possibility, we analyzed
the Ks distribution using ESTs. The age distribution of Br
based on approximately 120,000 ESTs showed a pattern
essentially identical to that obtained using the genome

sequence data, illustrating loss of the 3R peak (Figure 5a).
The additional peak for Ks = 0.10 to 0.15 may represent a very
recent segmental duplication event. Loss of the 3R event
appears to be specific to Br amongst Brassica genomes (Figure 5b-f); a Bo-Bo comparison yielded a Ks distribution different to that of Br-Br, with a clear peak corresponding to 3R
(mode Ks = 0.85 to 0.90). A similar pattern was observed in
the Bna-Bna comparison with underestimation of the peaks
for 3R. However, note that the Ks modes for ortholog comparison between Br and Bo, Bo and Bna, and Br and Bna showed
very similar Ks distribution with the two peaks for 4R and 2R
at similar Ks modes as those in Br-Br paralog analyses, but
loss of a peak for 3R. In particular, when the interval of Ks for
the Br-Bo comparison was magnified, one additional peak,
lying slightly below that for 4R at Ks = 0.34 to 0.36, was identified at Ks = 0.22 to 0.24; this indicates the genome split at
around 8 MYA (Figure 5g).
Detection of a peak reflecting 3R in the Bo and Bna genomes
but absence of this peak in the Br genome and between the
other Brassica genomes strongly supports the hypothesis
that duplicated genes from the 3R event were lost in the Br
genome due to gradual deletion or suppression, presumably
due to functional redundancy in the polyploid genome. To
further explore this hypothesis, we compared the degree of
conservation of duplicated genes in the sister blocks resulting
from 3R and 4R. We found that 33 and 18 sister block pairs
were selected for in the 3R and 4R events in the Br genome,
respectively (Table S4 in Additional data file 1). The degree of
conservation of duplicated genes for 4R was 44%, almost the
same as that of the triplicated FLC region [20], but only 20%
for 3R, a value approximately twofold lower than that of Bo
based on calculations from published data [19]. This suggests
greater deletion of duplicated genes in Br than Bo (Table 4;
Tables S4 and S5 in Additional data file 1).

Comparison of the genome structures of B. rapa and A. thaliana based on 24 ancestral karyotype genome building blocks. The genome structure of At was
based on the reports of Schranz et al. [37] and Lysak et al. [38]. The position of genome blocks in the Br chromosome was defined by a comparison of BrAt syntenic relationships and the At-AK mapping results. Br sequences were connected to form continuous sequences. Block boundaries, orientation, and
gaps between syntenic blocks are shown in Additional data file 4. Each color corresponds to a syntenic region between genomes. The Br genome is
triplicated and more thoroughly rearranged than the At genome.

nomically important crop plants (rice, poplar, grape, papaya,
and sorghum) have been published [8-12], and whole genome
sequencing projects are currently underway for only a few
selected crop species. One hurdle faced when sequencing a
crop genome is genome obesity due to polyploidy and repetitive DNA [41]. Therefore, a stepwise approach is required to
obtain genome-wide information from crop genomes, and
strategies for targeting gene-rich fractions are required. In
combination with EST sequencing, two approaches - methylation filtration [42] and Cot-based cloning and sequencing
[43] - were developed to capture euchromatic regions.
Although both methods enrich for gene-rich fractions, they

can exclude transcriptionally suppressed regions or euchromatic regions with abundant interspersed repetitive
sequences (tandem repeats). We applied a novel gene space
targeting method by allocating BAC clones to a closely related
model genome based on BAC end sequence (BES) matches;
this approach has not previously been reported in a genome
sequencing project. This method has several advantages.
First, gene-rich fractions of the crop genome can be obtained
successfully in silico without additional experiments. We collected approximately 30% of the euchromatic region of B.
rapa in this study. If a greater overlap between the clones and
target region is allowed, and additional information in the

form of genetic maps and physical contigs is used, the generich fraction recovered is likely to increase significantly. Second, clone-by-clone strategies used in genome sequencing
can benefit directly from this method because of selection of
gene-rich seed BACs as well as the alignment of sequence
scaffolds. Quick selection of a sufficient number of gene-rich
seed BACs and directed ordering of the sequence scaffold will
likely accelerate clone-based whole genome sequencing at
reduced cost. The BAC clones selected in this study can be
used as seed BACs for the ongoing clone-by-clone genome
sequencing of Br [27,28]. Third, this analysis allows investigation of syntenic relationships between wild and crop
genomes, thereby informing our understanding of crop evolution. Integration of genomes based on sequence level comparisons can offer a platform for the correlation between
specific genes and phenotypes, which is important for further
improvement of crops. We anticipate that application of our
method will accelerate knowledge spreading from nodal
model species to closely related taxa. For example, genome
sequencing of other Brassica crops, particularly the construction of sequence assemblies and scaffolds of Bna, can benefit
from the information obtained from the Br genome; this
holds true even for next-generation sequencing. Thus, we
anticipate that this study will make a significant contribution
to structural and comparative genomic studies of crop species.

Counterbalancing genome obesity after whole genome
triplication in B. rapa
A large-scale comparison of Br genomic sequences and the
whole euchromatic region of At demonstrated extensive synteny between the genomes, and provided clear evidence of a
recent WGT event in the Brassica lineage. Our results significantly expand on previous observations of synteny between
At and Br based on comparative genetic mapping [23] and

small-scale comparisons of homologous regions [20] by deciphering the start-end points of macrosynteny blocks and elucidating the fine-scale details of microsynteny within the
syntenic regions more accurately. Even though the Br
sequencing project is still underway and the sequences used
in this study are incomplete, the scale of synteny between the
two genomes at both the macro- and micro-levels is significant. As the Br sequencing project moves forward, the availability of nearly complete coverage of the euchromatin will
enable more precise definition of syntenic blocks between At
and Br, which can be used to reconstruct ancestral chromosome sequences of Brassica.
Despite the WGT event, the total number of genes in the Br
genome was estimated to be approximately 53,000, which is
only a twofold increase compared with that of At. The usual
fate of a duplicate-gene pair in a polyploid genome is nonfunctionalization or the deletion of one copy [44-46]. The
reduction in the overall number of genes in the triplicated Br
genome can be regarded as a result of a process that restores
the diploid state, thereby counterbalancing genome obesity.
This process seemed to be driven by the deletion of redundant
genome components at the level of both the chromosome and
the gene. A genome-wide synteny comparison between Br
and At revealed that some of the triplicated copies of Br segments were lost or reconstructed. In addition, microsynteny
analysis also indicated a relatively shrunken genome
throughout the entire euchromatic region of the Br genome,
with the Br gene space occupying a fraction 30% smaller than
that of At due to a higher frequency of deletion events in the
Br genome. A previous study reported that in the At genome,
genes with regulatory functions, such as those encoding transcription factors or genes involved in signal transduction,
were retained significantly more often than genes with other
molecular functions [5]. However, we did not find differential

retention of genes according to molecular function, which
suggests random deletion of redundant genes in triplicated
regions of the Br genome before functional diversification.

ancestor with a unique organization of the retracted AK,
which was different from that of At, by chromosomal rearrangement shortly after 3R but prior to 4R. This event might
have resulted in the divergence of the Arabidopsis and
Brassica lineages.

Several mechanisms responsible for post-polyploid changes
have been proposed. These include chromosome rearrangements caused by unequal crossing-over, homologous recombination, translocation, or other cytogenetic events [47-50]. A
tandem array with high sequence similarity would be a good
candidate for deletion, because it is more likely to recombine
and less likely to have a severe phenotype when one redundant gene is deleted. Fewer tandem duplicate genes in the Br
genome may, therefore, be attributable to an increase in the
rate of deletion. Incidentally, because polyploidy itself is a
form of genomic 'disturbance,' it might induce a cellular
response such as epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation,
which may be especially relevant to genome evolution [48].
As a result, the epigenetic response itself may accelerate the
rate of mutation, thereby causing rapid genomic change as
seen in Br. In addition, polyploidy could increase transposable element activity, causing the deletion of genes or even
chromosome segments. Illegitimate recombination of TEs
has been demonstrated to have the ability to remove large
blocks of DNA in Arabidopsis, rice, [15,49] and wheat [51].
We speculate that the twofold increase in transposon accumulation in the triplicated euchromatic regions of Br compared to the euchromatic counterpart regions of At might be
correlated with the deletion of duplicated genes.

Evolution of the Brassica 'A' genome
Multiple rounds of polyploidy are thought to have occurred
during angiosperm evolution, although the number and timing of polyploidy events vary between plant groups [5,52].
Thus, most modern plant genomes harbor evidence of multiple rounds of past polyploidization. The genome evolution of
Brassicaceae has been inferred mainly from studying Arabidopsis. There is evidence from several studies for one round
of genome duplication after the eudicot divergence and additional rounds of polyploidization following the divergence of
Arabidopsis from its common ancestor with cotton [5]. In
this study, we refined inferences of the number and timing of
polyploidy events, and we now discuss the impact of these
events on the structure and evolution of the Brassica 'A'
genome (Figure 6). Ks estimates suggest that the Brassica
genome shared two genome duplication events (2R and 3R)
with Arabidopsis postdating the eurosid I (Pt and Mt) and
eurosid II (At and Br) divergence. The third polyploidy event
(4R) was a Brassica lineage-specific whole genome triplication after the split of Brassica from the common ancestor of
Brassica and Arabidopsis. The 227 synteny blocks identified
between Br and At can serve as a basis for reconstruction of
the ancestral genome and chromosomes of the Br-At ancestor, although a more complete genome sequence and additional evidence are still required. The mapping of ancestral
chromosome building blocks to the Br genome strongly suggests that the Br genome evolved from a pre-triplicated

Volume 10, Issue 10, Article R111

Mun et al. R111.13

More importantly, differential gene loss following 4R in the
Brassica genome might be responsible for the diversification
of the genome, based on the finding that significantly more
genes duplicated as a result of 3R have been lost in Br than in
Bo. However, it is not clear if duplicated genes from the 3R
event that were retained in Bo have diverged functionally. It
appears that the split between Br and Bo happened rapidly
(0.1 Ks interval) compared to the At-Brassica split (0.3 Ks
interval), perhaps due to differential retention of duplicated
genes and genome recombination in the ancestral Brassica
genome. These observations, along with the independent
accumulation of repetitive sequences, may have facilitated
speciation within the tribe Brassiceae, which contains
approximately 240 highly diverse species. Further analysis
and cross-comparisons of diploid and allopolyploid genomes
of Brassica will enhance our understanding of the fate of
duplicated genes in the Brassica genome. It appears that, as
a counterbalance to genome obesity, there was higher selection pressure on redundant genes in the triplicated Brassica
ancestor, accelerating gene loss in this triplicated ancestor
compared to the Arabidopsis-Brassica common ancestor.
Alternatively, differences in the life cycles of Brassica progenitors might have resulted in the differential deletion of duplicated genes in Brassica genomes. Moreover, artificial
selection after domestication could also have had an impact
on differentiation of diploid Brassica genomes. Taken
together, the available evidence suggests that genome duplication and chromosomal diploidization are ongoing processes collectively driving the evolution of Brassica genomes.

Conclusions

Comparisons of large-scale genomic sequences of Br and the
whole euchromatic region of At revealed extensive synteny
between the genomes due to at least two shared genome
duplication events and a recent WGT event specific to the
Brassica lineage. The reduction of the number of genes in the
triplicated Br genome by approximately one-third can be
regarded to be the result of a process counterbalancing
genome obesity to regain the diploid state. Segmental loss of
triplicated genome blocks and differential deletion of duplicated genes in Br along with less accumulation of transposons
appear to have resulted in the small size of the Br genome
(approximately 529 Mbp) compared to its sibling species, Bo
(approximately 696 Mbp) and Bn (approximately 632 Mbp)
[30]. The events proposed here indicate that genome diploidization following polyploidy played an important role in
the radiation of Brassica. Our results clarify the orthology
between Br and At and establish a strong basis for the genome
evolution of Brassica. All the sequenced BAC clones investi-

of the gene matched in a TBLASTN [60] search at a cutoff of
<E-100. The assembled sequences were masked using RepeatMasker [61] using a dataset combining the plant repeat element database of the Munich Information Center for Protein
Sequence (MIPS) [62] and our specialized database of Br
repetitive sequences. Gene model prediction was performed
using EVidenceModeler [63]. Putative exons and open reading frames were predicted ab initio using FGENESH [64] and
AUGUSTUS [65] programs with the parameters trained using
the Br matrix. To predict consensus gene structures, Br ESTs
plus full-length cDNAs, plant transcripts, and plant protein
sequences were aligned to the predicted genes using PASA
[66] and AAT [67] packages. The predicted genes and evidence sequences were then assembled according to the
weight of each evidence type using EVidenceModeler. The
highest scoring set of connected exons, introns, and noncoding regions was selected as a consensus gene model. Proteins
encoded by gene models were searched against the Pfam
database [68] and automatically assigned a putative name
based on conserved domain hits or similarity with previously
identified proteins. Annotated gene models were also
searched against a database of plant transposon-encoded
proteins [69]. Predicted proteins with a top match to transposon-encoded proteins were excluded from the annotation and
gene counts.

Materials and methods
BAC selection, sequencing, and sequence contig
assembly
We previously published an efficient and novel clone selection method based on in silico BES matches to a model
genome, which we named the comparative tiling method
[29]. To select gene-rich Br BAC clones covering the entire At
euchromatic regions, a total of 92,000 BESs were allocated to
At chromosomes by using BLASTZ at a cutoff of <E-6 with
both end matches at 30 to 500 kbp intervals. A total of 4,647
BAC clones were allocated to 92 Mbp of At euchromatic
regions and 589 minimally overlapping BAC clones (292
overlapping clones with an average of 41 kbp overlaps and
297 singleton clones) were finally selected and sequenced
using an ABI 3730xl sequencer. The minimal sequence goal
was five phase 2 (fully oriented and ordered sequence with
some small gaps and low quality sequences) contigs, but 18
clones (3%) were sequenced as phase 1 due to large repetitive
sequences (Table S1 in Additional data file 1). To anchor
clones, a combination of sequence-based genetic mapping
[53], fingerprint contig data [54], and fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) was used (Table S2 in Additional data
file 1). The sequence contig assembly was created based on
overlapping sequences. BAC sequences were assembled into
big sequence contigs by first comparing paired BES matches
and BAC sequences sharing overlapping positions on the target At chromosomes using Pipmaker [55]. Then, sequence
contigs were assembled based on overlapping sequences
using Phred/Phrap/Consed programs [56-58]. The location
of sequence contigs or BAC singletons was determined primarily by genetic marker anchors with fingerprint contig information, paired BES, and FISH results providing additional
information about local contig and BAC ordering. Pseudochromosome sequences were created by connecting sequence
assemblies with 10-kbp additions of anonymous sequences.
All the Br sequences used in this study are available at NCBI
and the URL cited below in the 'Data used in this study' section and relevant reference sequence sources are listed in
Table S6 in Additional data file 1.

Estimation of genome coverage and genome
annotation
The sequence coverage of the Br genome by BACs was estimated by calculating the proportions of Br EST unigenes and
conserved single-copy rosid genes with strong matches. For
EST comparisons, we considered unigenes to have a genome
match if more than 90% of unigenes matched with at least
95% identity in a BLAT [59] analysis. For the single-copy
rosid gene comparison, we created a list of 1,070 single-copy
At and Mt genes not included in the Br EST collections. They
were considered to have a genome match in Br if at least 50%

Identification of syntenic blocks based on genome
comparisons
Syntenic regions of the genomes of Br and At were identified
by a proteome comparison based on BLASTP [60] analysis.
The entire proteomes of the two genomes were compared,
and only the top reciprocal BLASTP matches per chromosome pair were selected (minimum of 50% alignment coverage at a cutoff of <E-20). We chose to perform a BLASTP
similarity search because it is inherently more sensitive than
BLASTN [60]. Moreover, the BLASTP hit matrix contains
fewer BLAST hits that are due to repetitive nucleotide
sequences. Chromosome scale synteny blocks were inferred
by visual inspection of dot-plots using DiagHunter with
parameters as described in Cannon et al. [36]. Gene orientation, insertions/deletions, and inversions were considered,
and at least four genes with the same respective orientations
in both genomes were required to establish a primary candidate synteny block. To distinguish highly homologous real
synteny blocks from false positives due to multiple rounds of
polyploidy followed by genome rearrangement, we manually
checked all the primary candidate blocks. Previous studies
reported that the degree of gene conservation between At and
the Brassica genome in several selected syntenic regions was
>50%. Based on this result, 227 blocks showing a gene conservation index of >50% (twice the number of conserved
matches divided by the total number of non-redundant genes
in the blocks; tandem duplicated genes were collapsed to a
single homolog) were selected as real syntenic regions. For
microsynteny analysis, we manually broke the blocks if At
homologs of independent Br sequences in the syntenic blocks

distribution modes between the paralog gene pairs in the sister blocks.

Data used in this study
All the data used in this study can be accessed online at [73].

Ks analysis of homologous sequences
The timing of duplication events and the divergence of
homologous segments was estimated by calculating the
number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site
(Ks) between homologous genes. For the model genome comparisons, annotated gene models were used, whereas for the
comparison between the Brassica genomes, ESTs were analyzed, even though they are error-prone. One drawback associated with the analysis of paralogs derived from ESTs is that
multiple entries for the same gene can be included in the
dataset, leading to overestimation of redundant Ks measures
[5]. However, it is reasonable to assume that redundant Ks
measures are randomly distributed among all the Ks values;
thus. the effect of redundancy is likely to have been neutral.
Before comparing the Ks distribution for EST paralogs and
genome sequences of Br, we carefully checked the patterns of
Ks in the EST data; we did not find any significantly overestimated bulges or peaks. To identify orthologs and paralogs,
the protein sequences of the gene models or ESTs were
aligned using the all-against-all alignment and the resulting
alignment was used as a reference to align the nucleotide
sequences. After removing gaps, the Ks values from pairwise
alignments of homologous sequences were determined using
the maximum likelihood method implemented in the
CODEML [70] program of the PAML [71] package under the
F3×4 model, similar to the analysis described by Blanc et al.
[25]. We compared the mode rather than the mean of Ks distributions, because the mode is not affected by bias due to
incorrectly defined homolog pairs, which is partly responsible
for unexpected overestimation of Ks. Only gene pairs with a
Ks estimate of <5 were considered for further evaluation and
their Ks age distribution was calculated using the interval
0.02 to 0.1. Divergence time calculations were based on the
neutral substitution rate of 1.5 × 10-8 substitutions per site per
year for chalcone synthase (Chs) and alcohol dehydrogenase
(Adh) [40].

Gene conservation between sister blocks in the B. rapa
genome
Because Br BAC clones were selected to minimally overlap
the target At region, self comparison of Br sequences using
the DiagHunter program found few duplicated regions (Figure S4 in Additional data file 2). Instead, we manually identified sister blocks of duplication events by using synteny group
information between Br and At. Br sequence blocks were
defined as putative sister blocks of 3R if two different
sequence blocks showed high synteny with respect to At
regions known to be duplicated remnants of 3R [72], whereas
independent Br sequence blocks sharing the same syntenic
relationship with a single At region were selected as sister
blocks of 4R. For additional validation, we compared the Ks
