Abstract
Background: Microarray-based Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (CGH) has been used to
assess genetic variability between bacterial strains. Crucial for interpretation of microarray data is
the availability of a reference to compare signal intensities to reliably determine presence or
divergence each DNA fragment. However, the production of a good reference becomes unfeasible
when microarrays are based on pan-genomes.
When only a single strain is used as a reference for a multistrain array, the accessory gene pool will
be partially represented by reference DNA, although these genes represent the genomic
repertoire that can explain differences in virulence, pathogenicity or transmissibility between
strains. The lack of a reference makes interpretation of the data for these genes difficult and, if the
test signal is low, they are often deleted from the analysis. We aimed to develop novel methods to
determine the presence or divergence of genes in a Staphylococcus aureus multistrain PCR product
microarray-based CGH approach for which reference DNA was not available for some probes.
Results: In this study we have developed 6 new methods to predict divergence and presence of
all genes spotted on a multistrain Staphylococcus aureus DNA microarray, published previously,
including those gene spots that lack reference signals. When considering specificity and PPV (i.e.
the false-positive rate) as the most important criteria for evaluating these methods, the method
that defined gene presence based on a signal at least twice as high as the background and higher
than the reference signal (method 4) had the best test characteristics. For this method specificity
was 100% and 82% for MRSA252 (compared to the GACK method) and all spots (compared to
sequence data), respectively, and PPV were 100% and 76% for MRSA252 (compared to the GACK
method) and all spots (compared to sequence data), respectively.
Conclusion: A definition of gene presence based on signal at least twice as high as the background
and higher than the reference signal (method 4) had the best test characteristics, allowing the
analysis of 6-17% more of the genes not present in the reference strain. This method is
recommended to analyse microarray data that partially lack a reference signal.

Background
Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (CGH) microarray
studies are applied to identify genetic diversity in both
eukaryotes and prokaryotes [1-8]. In bacteria microarraybased CGH has been used in genome typing and comparative phylogenomic analyses to assess genomic regions or
genes involved in bacterial adaptation [9].
The relationship between the intensity of a hybridised
probe and the presence or divergence of a gene is crucial
in microarray-based CGH [10]. Features such as secondary
structure, melting temperature, and even target characteristics make it difficult to define a cut-off intensity for gene
presence [11,12]. In general, DNA from a test strain is cohybridised with differently labelled DNA from a reference
strain in order to sidestep these issues in microarray analysis. The use of a reference allows a comparison of signal
intensities and the determination, for each DNA fragment
in the reference strain, whether it is present or divergent in
the test strain [13]. The reference strain serves also as quality control for spots on microarray slides. In principle all
spots should yield a signal for the reference, as it contains
all genes. When a spot does not yield a signal with the
DNA of both the reference strain and the test strain, the
spot will be deleted from the analysis. The production of
a good reference becomes more difficult or even unfeasible when the probes present on the microarray are not
based on a single strain, but represent multiple genomes
or even the pan-genome of a species. It is to be expected
that the number of pan-genome arrays built from multiple strains will only increase with the rapid expansion of
available (bacterial) whole genome sequences [9].
There are already several methods to analyse microarrays,
which partly lack a reference [8,14-16]. However, in these
approaches spots without reference and lacking a test signal are flagged as poorly performing, and removed from
the analysis. Consequently, these genes cannot be classified with certainty as present or divergent. In this study we
developed novel methods to determine the presence or
divergence of all genes in a Staphylococcus aureus multistrain PCR product microarray-based CGH approach,
including those that lack a reference signal by using performance data from all the spots on the microarray.

Methods
Description of the DNA microarray and its use
All laboratory protocols have been described in detail by
Witney et al. [16] and are registered at BμG@Sbase http:/
/bugs.sgul.ac.uk/E-BUGS-30.

The S. aureus DNA microarray used in this study, which
consists of PCR-based probes for all open reading frames
(ORFs) of seven S. aureus strains, has been described and
validated previously and is summarised here [16]. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/522

short, all ORFs of MRSA252, which served as base strain,
were added to the microarray design followed by the addition of probes for genes from the other strains that are
absent in, or show significant divergence from the genes
of MRSA252 based on BLAST bit scores. The order in
which the probes for the genes of the strains were added
to the array was: MRSA252 (base strain), N315, Mu50,
COL, NCTC8325, MW2, and MSSA476 [16]. In total, the
microarray consisted of 3623 PCR products spotted in
duplicate representing every predicted open reading frame
of the seven strains [8,16]. Around 75% of the PCR products (n = 5478 in duplo) represent MRSA252, while
around 25% of the PCR products (n = 1768 in duplo)
were obtained from the other six strains.
All strains were cultured on tryptic soy agar sheep blood
plates at 37°C overnight. DNA of the reference strain and
the test strains was isolated using the QIAGEN genomictip 100/G column and an Edge Biosystems Bactererial
Genomic DNA purification kit (Edge Biosystems, Gateshead, United Kingdom).
DNA of all seven sequenced S. aureus strains, labelled with
Cy3, was hybridised in duplicate on an array, with DNA
of MRSA252, which was labelled with Cy5 as reference
signal. Labeling was performed as described previously
[8,16].
Microarray images were quantified with ImaGene software (Biodiscovery, http://www.biodiscovery.com, El
Segundo, California, United States). The two pictures per
slide, one for every dye, were analysed separately in
ImaGene. Fully annotated microarray data are deposited
in BμG@Sbase http://bugs.sgul.ac.uk/E-BUGS-30 and
have been retrieved for this study.
The background was calculated automatically and separately per colour and spot by ImaGene software.
Data-processing
Since a reference signal was available for 75% of the
microarray spots, only for this part hybridisation data
could be analysed using ratios of test, Cy3, and reference,
Cy5, signal. For this purpose the data were dissected into
two different data sets. The first data set consisted of the
hybridisation results of the MRSA252 specific spots (75%
of the spots in duplicate) containing a reference signal
(further indicated as MRSA252 spots). Hybridisation signals for these MRSA252 spots were analysed using GACK
(further referred to as GACK method), which is a welldocumented standard analysis method [4,17,18] and also
the new analysis methods developed in this study. The
second data set that includes all spots, i.e. both the nonMRSA252 spots that lack a reference signal and the
MRSA252 spots, were only analysed using the new devel-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/522

oped methods. The MRSA252 spots were also analysed
with the new analysis methods to compare the outcome
of the methods with that of the GACK method.

To analyse the second data set, which include the nonMRSA252 as well as the MRSA252 spots, all slides were
again normalised separately. This means that first the
intensities of Cy3 minus the Cy3 background signal for all
spots and Cy5 minus the Cy5 background Cy5 signal for
the MRSA252 spots were calculated. Because of the lack of
a reference signal, the non-MRSA252 spots could not be
normalised in the ratio dependent way or by auto-scale
normalisation since the latter will reduce differences in
the intensities, which compromises calculation of an
accurate cut-off for gene presence or divergence. For this
reason the second data set was analysed using different
newly developed methods (see below). Filtering of the
MRSA252 spots in this data set was performed identical as
in the first data set; by excluding the automatically flagged
spots by ImaGene and spots with a Cy5 signal intensity,
which is less than two times the Cy5 background signal.

The number of spots

In a first step only the MRSA252 spots on all slides were
analysed. For every array the bad spots were filtered. Filtering was applied to exclude spots for which the reference,
Cy5, signal was less than two times the background value
of that particular spot. Also the spots, which ImaGene
automatically defines as bad or empty spots, were
excluded from the data. Slides were then normalised per
array to correct for differences in labelling-efficiency,
hybridisation, scanning conditions, and slide quality. For
every particular spot the intensity of Cy3 minus the Cy3
background signal and Cy5 minus the Cy5 background
signal was calculated, after which Cy3 to Cy5 ratios were
calculated and log2-transformed. Per array the median
and standard deviation of all ratios were calculated. The
arrays were then subsequently normalised per spot, by
first subtracting the median ratio of that particular array
followed by dividing the resulting ratios per spot by the
specific standard deviation of all ratios for that array. This
specific normalisation is also called auto-scale normalisation. The estimated probability of presence of each gene
or DNA fragment was determined using a GACK-transformation http://falkow.stanford.edu/whatwedo/software/
software.html[19]. Using GACK transformation, it is possible to dynamically choose cut-offs for determining presence or divergence of genes or DNA fragments based on
the shape of the distribution. For this study data were
transformed to binary output using a threshold of 50%
estimated probability of being present (EPP) in order to
call genes present or divergent. To use GACK the data need
to be normally distributed, which was the case in this
study (Figure 1).

Distribution of the normalised ratio. Example of a histogram of one slide constructed using Matlab2006b showing
the distribution of the normalised signal intensities. Only the
MRSA252 spots were taken into account in the number of
spots and the flagged spots were filtered.

The results of the new analysis methods were validated by
comparing the hybridisation data of the seven sequenced
strains used in the array with the predicted presence and
divergence of genes based on the GACK method and on
the genome sequence data. Performance of the new
method was determined by calculating sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the new methods. Sensitivity is calculated by dividing the number of genes predicted to be
present in the control strains based on the new analysis
method, by the number of genes that are considered to be
present based on the annotation of Witney et al [16]. The
calculated sensitivity of an analysis method was only
based on the extra spots for each strain that were added to
the array. For MRSA252 this means around 75% of the
total of all spots on the array, since this strain was added
first on the array. So, if for instance only 148 of in total
176 NCTC8325-specific sequences were identified as
being present by an analysis method, the sensitivity of
that analysis method would be 84.09%.
Specificity is the proportion of the divergent sequences,
which are correctly identified as divergent sequences in an
analysis method. This means that for, e.g., strain
NCTC8325 all 170 probes spotted extra for strains MW2
and MSSA476 should be divergent in the NCTC8325
genes, since MW2 and MSSA476 were added after
NCTC8325. If, however, in this case only 119 sequences

were called divergent by an analysis method, the specificity would be 70%.

nal of that spot. In short: gene is present when Cy3 intensity > 2 × Cy3 background signal.

The positive predictive value (PPV) is the number of the
true positive sequences divided by the total number of
sequences that were indicated as positive (true and falsepositive) in the different analysis methods. This means
that if 104 of the 5484 probes that are called present for
MRSA252 by an analysis method are false-positive, the
PPV would be 98.10% (5380/5484)

2. Cut-off based on reference signal intensities
In the second approach the non-MRSA252 sequences
were considered present when the value of the Cy3 intensity of a particular spot was higher than the Cy5 signal of
that spot. Cy5 signals for non-MRSA252 spots are considered background noise in this approach, caused by,
among other things, cross-hybridisation. So, in this second method, we hypothesized that signal intensity of the
test strains for conserved sequences has to be at least
above the value of the reference signal. In short: A gene is
present when Cy3 intensity > Cy5 intensity.

The negative predictive value (NPV) is the number true
divergent sequences divided by the total number of
sequences indicated as divergent. So, in the case that only
902 of 922 sequences called divergent by an analysis
method are true divergent, the NPV would be 97.83%
(902/922).
For the MRSA252 spots, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value
(NPV) of the new methods were calculated and compared
with the values obtained with the GACK method.
In total six different approaches were used to analyse the
data. In the first method a cut-off per array and in the
other five methods a cut-off per spot was calculated.
Cut-off per array
To calculate the cut-off per array, log2 values of the intensities of the reference MRSA252, Cy5 signal, on the
MRSA252 and the non-MRSA252 spots were determined.
The cut-off is that intensity value where 95% of the
MRSA252 spots will be called positive and 95% of the
non-MRSA252 spots negative. Only the intensities of the
MRSA252 reference signal were included because for this
strain it is exactly known which sequences should be
present and which diverge; all MRSA252 probes have to
be present and all non-MRSA252 probes have to be divergent.
Cut-off per spot
Five different approaches were used to determine the cutoff value per spot for presence and divergence of the
sequences, which are explained below. All approaches
analysed the hybridisation signals for each spot separately
and generated a cut-off per spot to determine whether a
sequence was conserved or divergent. With the consequence that intensity above the cut-off means that a gene
is present. Using these cut-offs, sensitivities and specificities, PPV and NPV were calculated as described above.
1. Cut-off based on two times the background
In the first approach non-MRSA252 sequences were considered present when the value of the Cy3 intensity of a
particular spot was higher than twice the background sig-

3. Cut-off based on the minimal ratio of positivity
The first step in this third approach is to determine per
array the lowest test/reference (Cy3/Cy5) intensity ratio
for the MRSA252 spots, thus for spots for which a reference signal is available, and which were predicted to be
positive based on GACK analysis. Subsequently the reference intensity of every individual spot was multiplied
with the value of this lowest Cy3/Cy5 ratio. This way the
lowest Cy3 value per spot predicted to be present was calculated. The last step in the calculation is that Cy3 intensities, which were greater than the Cy5 value of that spot
multiplied by the lowest Cy3/Cy5 ratio, were considered
to represent sequence presence. In short: A gene is present
when Cy3 intensity > minimal ratio × Cy5 intensity.
4. Cut-off based on two times the background and reference signal
intensities
This approach consists of a combined calculation of the
first and second approach (see above). In this method
sequences were considered present when the value of the
Cy3 intensity of a particular spot was higher than twice
the background signal and when the Cy3 intensity was
higher than the Cy5 intensity of that spot. In short: A gene
is present when Cy3 intensity > (2 × Cy3 background signal) and > Cy5 intensity.
5. Cut-off based on two times the background and the minimal ratio
of positivity
This last approach is a combined calculation of the first
and the third approach. The first step in the last approach
is to determine per array the lowest Cy3/Cy5 ratio for
MRSA252 spots, as described above. Cy3 intensities, that
were twice the background and greater than the Cy5 value
of that spot multiplied by the lowest Cy3/Cy5 ratio were
considered to represent sequences presence. In short: A
gene is present when Cy3 intensity > (2 × Cy3 background
signal) and > (minimal ratio × Cy5 intensity).

Results
Fully annotated microarray data have been deposited in
BuG@Sbase (accession number E-BUGS-85; http://
bugs.sgul.ac.uk/E-BUGS-85) and also ArrayExpress
(accession number E-BUGS-85). From the fourteen control arrays, three (hybridised with MRSA252 (n = 1) and
MSSA476 (n = 2)) were excluded from further analysis,
because of poor hybridisations with low signal intensities
for the test strain.
Cut-off per array
Box plots, in which the log2 values of the intensities of the
reference MRSA252 (Cy5) signal for the MRSA252 and the
non-MRSA252 spots are presented, indicate highly variable intensities between different spots on the same microarray slide (Figure 2). Based on these results we concluded
that a single cut-off per array was not feasible and alternative methods were developed.
Cut-off per spot
Sensitivities, specificities, PPVs and NPVs of the different
approaches are described in Table 1. Specificities for all
spots ranged from 7.85% for method 3 (cut-off based on
the minimal ratio of positivity) to 81.61% for method 4

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/522

(cut-off based on two times the background and reference
signal intensities). Method 4 also had the highest PPV
(76.13%) for the second data set, including all spots.
Method 3 showed for the MRSA252 data set nearly the
same values as the GACK analysis (less than 2% probes
were misclassified in method 3 compared with the GACK
analysis).
As compared to method 4, methods 2 (cut-off based on
reference signal intensities) and 3, exhibited much lower
specificities (81.61% for method 4 and 19.79% and
7.85% for methods 2 and 3, respectively). In method 2 the
non-MRSA252 spots were considered present when the
value of the Cy3 test signal of a particular spot was higher
than the Cy5 signal of that spot. However, Cy5 signals for
the non-MRSA252 spots are extremely low and considered background noise, yielding a low cut-off for Cy3 test
signals and a relatively high degree of false-positive
results. Method 3 (cut-off based on the minimal ratio of
positivity) had the best sensitivity and specificity for the
MRSA252 spots, but a low specificity for the nonMRSA252 spots, from which we conclude that the Cy5
intensity, which is the only difference between the
MRSA252 spots and the non-MRSA252 spots, is much

(N315, MW2, Mu50, NCTC8325, COL and MSSA476), which are absent in the MRSA252 and so should not yield a Cy5 signal.
The box plots illustrate the log2 of the raw intensity of the reference (Cy5) channel for the MRSA252 and the non-MRSA252
spots separately. The horizontal line in the box denotes the median of the intensity. The log2 of the signal for 50% of the spots
falls within the boxes and the dots account for the upper and lower 5% of the spots. These pictures clearly show that height of
the raw intensity does not correlate with the presence or divergence of a gene. These box plots indicate highly variable intensities between different spots on the same microarray slide.

a Spots based on MRSA252 ORFs (75% of all spots on the array). Flagged spots of the MRSA252 data set were filtered from the calculations.
To validate the results of the different new analysis methods the MRSA252 spots were also analysed with the new methods and compared with the
results obtained with the GACK method and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the new
methods were calculated.

c To calculate sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the new methods, the hybridisation results of six sequenced strains used in the array design
were included with the exception of the results of MSSA476. The calculated sensitivity of an analysis method was only based on the specific spots
for each strain that were added to the array. So only the MRSA252 spots were taken into account for the sensitivity for the MRSA252 strain.
Specificity for a strain could only be calculated based on the strains that were added on the array after the specific strain. These genes have to be
divergent, since they were not present in the specific strain. This means that for strain NCTC8325 all 170 genes spotted extra for strains MW2 and
MSSA476 should be divergent in the NCTC8325 hybridisations, since MW2 and MSSA476 were added after NCTC8325.

lower for the non-MRSA252 spots than for the MRSA252
spots. This will give a very low cut-off, resulting in a low
specificity.

gene is truly divergent or that the spot has been badly
manufactured. For this reason we only considered specificity and PPV as important values.

Method 5 (cut-off based on two times the background
and the minimal ratio of positivity) had a lower specificity
and PPV (i.e. higher false-positive values) than method 4,
which can be explained by the fact that the Cy3/Cy5 ratio,
as used in method 3 (see above), results in too low cut-off
values, and, thus, a higher degree of false-positive results.

While there is a wealth of approaches to analyse microarray data with a reference [10,16,20-24], few methods are
available for the analysis of data from dual labelled slides
that are partly without a reference [14,16,20,25,26]. The
most common analysis for non-Affymetrics arrays (partly)
without reference includes the use of one external reference and one cut-off for all arrays [14,20,25,26] However,
such an approach appeared not optimal in this study as
the variation in signal intensities was too large between
and within arrays (Figure 2). The nature of the probes
probably explains the large degree of variation in signal
intensities, because these consisted of PCR fragments with
variable length (between the 100 and 800 base pairs)
[16], which were spotted with variable densities.

Discussion
The calculations for cut-off per spot described in this study
provide useful tools for data analysis of microarrays that
partially lack reference signals. For each of these methods,
however, conclusions about negative spots should be
drawn with considerable care. In the absence of a good
reference, a negative test signal can mean that a particular

Genes that share considerable sequence similarity, thus
scored presence based on the microarray hybridisation,
but were considered divergent (based on BLAST bit
scores) [16] can also explain the observed low specificities
and low PPVs for the second data set (including all the
spots). The BLAST bit score was used as a quality measure
for gene divergence, because it reflects the length as well
as the degree of sequence similarity. Although this gives in
general a reliable prediction of gene presence or divergence, it is possible that two genes with significant
stretches of sequence similarity will be classified as divergent based on bit-scores, e.g., when two genes differ in size
due to differences in repeat numbers. Additionally, gene
redundancy may also explain low PPVs. The S. aureus
genome has numerous well-documented examples of
multiple genes that show a significant level of sequence
similarity, which can give false-positive hybridisation
results.

in this study, it implied that we are now able to analyse 617% more of the genes not present in the reference strain
than in previous publications using the same array.

Interpreting presence or divergence of genes using a multistrain microarray in the absence of a reference for all
microarray spots is highly complex as illustrated in this
study. This is especially true when hybridisation signal
intensities fall into the marginal zone between clearly
present or clearly divergent. The most important advantage, of the newly developed methods, especially methods
4 and 5 (cut-off based on two times the background and
reference signal intensities and based on two times the
background and the minimal ratio of positivity, respectively) over previously published methods is that they predict divergence and presence of all genes spotted on a
microarray within a reasonable certainty, including the
spots that lack a reference and test signal. The fact that
spots, lacking a test and reference signal, are valued as
poorly performing, instead of potentially representing
divergent genes explains why previously reported specificities and sensitivities were slightly higher than the ones
we calculate in the current study[16]. Analysis of all differentially present genes is of utmost importance, since these
genes denote the accessory genome, which most likely
represents the genomic repertoire that explains for a large
part observed virulence, pathogenicity or transmission
differences between clones.

Conclusion
When considering specificity and PPV (i.e. the false-positive rate) as the most important criteria for evaluating new
approaches for analysing microarrays that partially lack
reference signals, a definition of sequence presence based
on a signal higher at least twice as high as the background
and higher than the reference signal (method 4) showed
the best test characteristics. For this method specificity was
100% and 82% for MRSA252 and all spots, respectively,
and PPV were 100% and 76% for MRSA252 and all spots,
respectively. For the S. aureus array, which was evaluated
