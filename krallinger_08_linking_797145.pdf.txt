Abstract
Efficient access to information contained in online scientific literature collections is essential for life
science research, playing a crucial role from the initial stage of experiment planning to the final
interpretation and communication of the results. The biological literature also constitutes the main
information source for manual literature curation used by expert-curated databases. Following the
increasing popularity of web-based applications for analyzing biological data, new text-mining and
information extraction strategies are being implemented. These systems exploit existing
regularities in natural language to extract biologically relevant information from electronic texts
automatically. The aim of the BioCreative challenge is to promote the development of such tools
and to provide insight into their performance. This review presents a general introduction to the
main characteristics and applications of currently available text-mining systems for life sciences in
terms of the following: the type of biological information demands being addressed; the level of
information granularity of both user queries and results; and the features and methods commonly
exploited by these applications. The current trend in biomedical text mining points toward an
increasing diversification in terms of application types and techniques, together with integration of
domain-specific resources such as ontologies. Additional descriptions of some of the systems
discussed here are available on the internet http://zope.bioinfo.cnio.es/bionlp_tools/.

Introduction

Life science research is characterized by the production of
large and heterogeneous collections of biological data, including protein and genomic sequence data, expression profiles,
and protein structure coordinates [1]. Although these data
types represent an important fraction of existing biological
information, they are often not amenable to direct human
interpretation. A significant amount of information is
encoded in the form of natural language, the main vehicle
through which humans transmit and exchange information
[2]. Most of the biological discoveries are communicated by
means of scientific publications, patents, or reports, with an

increasing number of them accessible via the worldwide web
as electronic texts. Natural language is used to communicate
information in a variety of other biological resources, including controlled vocabulary terms used for gene product annotations (for example, Gene Ontology [GO] terms) as well as in
database records, such as in UniProt, which contain comments, keywords, or descriptions [3].
Structured database entries are designed to enable efficient
data retrieval, exchange, and analysis. There has been a tendency to enrich annotation records of many of the existing
expert-curated databases with previously missing but

biologically relevant aspects by incorporating new fields or
extending the inventory of terms used to describe these
aspects. In parallel, new manually curated databases have
been developed that cover a range of previously neglected
biological entities, such as microRNAs or disease-associated
single nucleotide polymorphisms; other new databases focus
on highly specialized topics that are not sufficiently covered
in general expert-curated databases [4]. Although the importance of more extensive annotations is becoming apparent,
this is also associated with significant increase in curation
workload, which slows down the manual annotation process.
Even if general annotation databases such as UniProt - which
stores a set of annotations linked to over 134,000 literature
citations (February 2008) - are of great practical value, such
databases are generally only capable of covering a small fraction of the biological context information that can be encountered in the literature. Crucial details of experimental
conditions can still only be found in the underlying articles,
making direct pointers to evidence passages from the literature especially important for interpreting existing
annotations.

only in electronic format - the only limitation in terms of
number of accepted articles is the required effort involved in
the peer-review process.

The bottom line is that biological databases alone cannot capture the richness of scientific information and argumentation
contained in the literature; neither can databases provide
support for the novel ways in which scientists will interrogate
these databases. Even if curators of biological databases were
able to keep up with the ever increasing volume of literature,
biologists would still need text mining to link the database
entries to the evidence and the argumentation contained in
the literature.
The rapid accumulation of new publications, which must be
processed by human curators for extraction of both new discoveries and revision of existing ones, represents an additional challenge for keeping biological databases up to date
[5]. Traditional manual literature curation is only feasible for
a small number of articles and a fraction of journals. The set
of manual annotations derived from the literature also serves
as the basis for so-called 'electronic annotations', in which
functional information of curated entities is automatically
transferred to other biological entities (without direct human
curation) using computational sequence similarity methods
[3].
Online literature collections such as PubMed, with over 70
million queries every month and over 17 million publications,
are of crucial importance to both the experimental biologists
and biomedical researchers, as well as to specialized users
such as database curators. Centralized literature repositories
like PubMed face double-exponential growth rates [6], which
can be partially explained by inclusion of an increasing
number of new journals, special issues or conference proceedings, and previously unindexed publications. Additionally, some journals have also augmented the number of
articles included per issue, and - for those journals available

Efficient information retrieval (identification of relevant documents, given some search criteria) is essential to the biomedical research community [7], as large biomedical
literature databases are being used as a resource for clinical
decision support in evidence-based clinical practice, providing useful information for diagnostic aids [8]. Specific search
strategies have been devised for optimal retrieval of relevant
clinical studies to assist clinicians in performing efficient and
targeted literature searches for specific medical subdomains
[9,10]. Experimental biologists are making use of the scientific literature for multiple stages within the scientific discovery process. Knowledge extracted from previous publications
is used to define the biological question or to select the actual
target being studied, to extract information relevant for
experimental set up (for example, biological conditions,
parameters, and protocols), or to locate relevant resources
(for instance, methodological systems or data repositories).
After generating and analyzing the experimental results,
information derived from the literature is essential to understand and interpret the resulting data, in order to draw conclusions about new discoveries. Finally, the results are
communicated to the scientific community using publications in peer-reviewed journals.
For the pharmaceutical industry, text-mining systems are a
valuable resource as part of drug discovery and target selection systems, but also for identifying adverse drug effect
descriptions [11]. The pharmaceutical industry uses information technology applications to improve their competitive
intelligence and knowledge management strategies, typically
processing not just the scientific literature but also information contained in other textual data collections such as internal reports, patents, and newswire [12].
Modern biology is a dynamic, continually evolving research
discipline, in which existing research topics and trends
change rapidly over time [13]. For governmental institutions
it is crucial to have a global view of the current research state
and to monitor trends from the increasing number of scientific publications in order to ensure optimal resource allocation [14]. Publishers examine the literature to find domain
experts for specific topics for the peer-review process and to
ensure that their publications contain novel scientific discoveries, detecting potential cases of plagiarism. Tools such as
Déjà vu, which uses text similarity calculations to detect
duplicate citations from PubMed, can determine the novelty
of publications [15]. The biomedical literature can also serve
as a resource to build social networks of research collaborations using co-author citation analysis. Web-based applications such as PubNet are able to provide a graphical
visualization of co-author networks derived from citations
[16].

Overview of current literature data resources

PubMed Informer, a Web-based PubMed monitoring tool,
facilitates PDA downloads and RSS feeds [24].

Several efforts have been undertaken to provide access to
published medical and life science journal information, and
make this information electronically accessible to the public
through the worldwide web [17]. Most of these initiatives can
be classified into one of three main categories.
1. Centralized institutional (for example, PubMed) or academic (for instance, Highwire Press and Hollis) repositories
of peer-reviewed articles or article abstracts.
2. Article collection repositories hosted by publishers (for
example, BioMed Central and EMBASE).
3. Online access to indexed scholar articles retrieved through
web spiders and crawlers (for example, Google Scholar and
Scirus).
A number of scholarly and scientific literature databases can
be accessed online through search engines with simple query
interfaces using keywords. Falagas and coworkers [17] compiled a list of literature databases containing summaries of
articles of biomedical and life science journals with records
both in English as well as in other languages. The most important resource for text mining applications is currently the
PubMed database developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of
Medicine (NLM). Each of the citations contained in PubMed
has a unique identifier (PMID) and can be accessed using
Entrez, a text-based search and retrieval system. PubMed
[18] includes citations (containing title, abstract, authors, and
source information) submitted by participating publishers.
Entrez improves the basic keyword searches by translating
the user query to Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms, a
hierarchical set of controlled vocabulary terms predominantly from the medical domain but also including terms for
chemicals, genes, and proteins, used to index PubMed
records [19]. In addition to basic searches using the Entrez
retrieval system, PubMed also offers a more programmatic
access to its content through the Entrez Programming Utilities [18] and popular open source projects such as the BioPerl,
BioPython, and BioJava integrated libraries for retrieving
PubMed content by biologist programmers [20]. The NCBI
provides the My NCBI service [21] to periodically retrieve new
publications in PubMed matching a predefined user query;
the requester then receives a corresponding notification via
an e-mail alert system.
To build a local relational database containing all PubMed
citations [22], it is also possible to obtain a licensed copy of
the whole of PubMed containing XML-formatted citation
records from the NLM/NCBI. Some systems such as
Txt2MEDLINE have even been implemented to allow access
to PubMed using Short Message Service (SMS) queries, sending the users the results in text message format [23]; also

Alternative repositories and search engines to PubMed
include Highwire Press and Google Scholar [25]. Google
Scholar can recover not only peer-reviewed articles but also
other scholarly texts, such as theses, books, and preprint
repositories. A comparative study by Shultz [26] showed that
Google Scholar often returns larger retrieval sets, but a substantial number are link-outs to PubMed records. Google
Scholar currently also does not provide the advanced search
functions offered by PubMed. HighWire Press (an initiative of
Stanford University) represents another complementary
resource to PubMed for accessing peer-reviewed articles, providing a search interface to over 1,160 journals and 4.8 million full-text articles, with over 1.9 million articles available
free by Highwire partner publishers. A comparative evaluation of HighWire Press and PubMed in terms of search efficiency showed that although both share many search
characteristics, they also have unique features [27]. Highwire
Press has an option to provide a graphical visualization of the
article's citation map and allows the user to further specify
where to conduct the search (title, abstract, full text).
Although article abstracts contain short descriptions that
highlight the most relevant aspects of a given article, they
only cover a small fraction of the information contained in
full-text articles [28]. PubMed Central provides free online
access to a electronic archive containing full-text articles of
life sciences and biomedical journals. PubMed Central also
contains articles published before 1966 that have been digitized as part of the Back Issue Digitization project [6]. Publishers have also developed platforms of searchable article
repositories such as EMBASE or BioMed Central to improve
the access to their articles. Figure 1 provides an overview of
the main literature resources.

The structure of biomedical language

The diversification process of protein sequences during the
course of evolution is subjected to physical, chemical, structural, and historical constraints moulded by natural selection.
Therefore, a collection of homologous protein sequences
often shares a common structural fold and tends to exhibit a
similar function. Similarly, in the case of natural language, a
particular meaning may be expressed using different but
largely synonymous expressions, also moulded by a set of
structural constraints and historical events that shape languages, in this case English - the language of scientific communication. For example, the following three snippets of text
below capture equivalent information about the interaction
between the proteins VRK1 and c-JUN; these snippets illustrate some of the variations in word choice and syntax found
in the scientific literature: 'VRK1 protein phosphorylates cJun' (example 1); 'the phosphorylation of c-Jun by VRK1'
(example 2); and 'c-Jun is activated by VRK1' (example 3).

The techniques of natural language processing are used to
'decode' the information that is packaged in human language.
This is done by exploiting the regularities and constraints that
occur at multiple levels in human language. These levels
include the following:

1. Words: lexical entries (words) are the units of meaning and
the basic building blocks of language. A word is made up of a
root and possibly other morphemes (prefixes or suffixes); for
example, 'phosphorylates' in example 1 (above) consists of the
root 'phosphorylate' plus the third person singular present

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/S2/S8

Genome Biology 2008,

tense morpheme '-s'. Morphemes can also modify the meaning or change part of speech; for example, the suffix '-tion'
changes the verb ('phosphorylate') into the related noun
('phosphorylation'), and the prefix 'de-' can negate the meaning, as in 'deactivation'.

These layers of structure provide constraints, reduce ambiguity, limit redundancy, and enable efficient communication
(Figure 2 provides an example case illustrating these different
levels of language complexity). Also, much in the same way
that genomic sequences can be 'parsed' to identify specific
patterns such as genes, control regions, or - on a larger scale motifs, linguistic structure leads to regularities that can be
exploited by automatic text processing systems to learn the
statistical properties of human language and to decode the
information it contains - often using the same kinds of pattern recognition techniques that are used to analyze genomes
and proteomes.

2. Syntax: the syntax or grammar of a language controls how
words are grouped into meaningful phrases and eventually
into sentences. For example, in English, word order is used to
convey grammatical relations such as subject-verb-object. In
example 1 (above), the noun 'VRK-1' is the subject (and actor)
for the verb 'phosphorylate' in the sentence 'VRK1 phosphorylates c-Jun', whereas 'c-Jun' is the object (recipient of the
action). To aid in syntactic analysis, words can be associated
with part-of-speech (POS) tags, to distinguish nouns, verbs,
prepositions, and conjunctions. To link words to their grammatical function, each word can be assigned a 'part of speech',
indicating its role in the sentence, for instance a noun (name
of something), verb (an action or linking word), an adjective
(describing a quality), and so on. POS taggers are computer
programs that automatically assign each word its corresponding POS label. These systems are generally based on machine
learning algorithms such as hidden Markov models trained
on manually POS-labeled text collections (corpora). The biomedical literature shows a slightly different POS distribution
as compared to general English newswire texts, which has
motivated the implementation of specialized taggers optimized for the biomedical domain, such as the MedPost [29]
tagger or dTagger [30]. POS information can be useful to
detect textual patterns expressing protein interactions [31] or
to locate gene and protein mentions [32].
3. Semantics: semantic relations capture meaning; for
instance, example 3 (above) 'c-Jun is activated by VRK1' can
be represented as an operator (the verb 'activate) operating
on two arguments - 'activate (VRK1, c-Jun)' - in the same way
that a logical operator operates on its arguments. The semantic representation abstracts away from the details of the
underlying syntax (and specific words), to capture regularities. Thus, in this example, the semantics capture the fact that
VRK1 does the activation, and c-Jun is activated.
4. Pragmatics: pragmatic or discourse relations capture the
larger context and its contribution to meaning. Text-mining
tools often rely on sentences as the basic processing unit for
extracting associations between biological entities. However,
descriptions of these relations go beyond sentence boundaries and make use of referring expressions [33], as is the case
in the following two sentences from (PMID 15800059): (a)
'Dictyostelium LIS1 (DdLIS1) is a microtubule-associated
protein exhibiting 53% identity to human LIS1.' (b) 'It colocalizes with dynein at isolated, microtubule-free centrosomes, suggesting that both are integral centrosomal
components.'

Krallinger et al. S8.5

The presentation of biological information in the literature
interacts with the general linguistic structures described
above, but is also subject to peculiarities associated with the
specific domain (here, biomedicine). This specialized usage of
language in a domain is known as a sublanguage. The sublanguage(s) of science have been extensively studied by linguists
[34-36].
The understanding of sublanguage structure underlies much
of current text mining and natural language processing, as is
discussed in more detail in the next section. The literature of
a particular subfield (for example, molecular biology) has
characteristic terms (for instance, 'gene', 'protein', and 'phosphorylation') and characteristic collocations (co-occurrences
of terms used as phrases, such as 'cell membrane' or 'ion
channel'). Techniques for document search and clustering
make heavy use of profiles based on the distribution of single
words and multi-word phrases to find and rank documents
relevant to a particular search, as was required for the BioCreative protein-protein interaction task ('find all articles with
experimental evidence for protein-protein interaction'). In
addition, the sentence-level patterns of word occurrence are
used by entity recognition and entity normalization systems
to identify 'names' of types of entities, for example genes, proteins, or species. These systems make use of the word and
sentence context to detect kinds of entities; however, these
contexts are quite specific to the particular subfield and may
well evolve with time, as new experimental methods come
into use and new kinds of entities are discovered. Therefore,
the sublanguage associated with a subfield evolves over time
and must be constantly updated. In addition, another contributing factor derives from the fact that English is the language of scientific publication, but many authors have
different native languages that may influence their writing
style, including sentence length and word usage; this leads to
greater variability in these aspects when compared with texts
written by native English authors [37].
Like any subfield, biomedicine makes heavy use of domainspecific terminology and relies also on typographic and orthographic conventions to communicate certain kinds of information. This in turn affects 'tokenization', or the process of
identifying the strings of characters that make up words.

Figure 2
Main natural language processing levels, from word tokenization to semantics
Main natural language processing levels, from word tokenization to semantics. The different processing layers for a given example sentence are shown
here. This example is based on the output generated by the GENIA tagger: DT, determiner; IN, preposition or subordinating conjunction; JJ, adjective;
NN, Noun (singular or mass); NNS, Noun (plural); VBZ, Verb (third person singular present). The B/I/O terminology refers to begin phrase (B), internal
to phrase (I), and outside of phrase (O).

Fortunately, there are rich resources for biomedical terminology that can be used to build lexicons, to create linkages from
one set of resources to another, and to learn associations, for
example ontologies such as GO. These three topics are discussed in the following subsections.

Biological terminology
The biological literature is characterized by heavy use of
domain-specific terminology. There are estimates that more
than 12% of words found in biochemistry publications correspond to technical terms of that scientific discipline [38]. This
has motivated the development of strategies to recognize biomedical terms and their variations automatically [39].
There are two basic challenges in dealing with terminology;
the first is the constant formation of new terms and new 'short
forms' or abbreviations. This is related to the second problem
of ambiguity or polysemy (multiple meanings of a word).
Ambiguity results when an existing term is used to describe a
new concept (for instance, a new gene or protein), or when a
new abbreviation is coined that turns out to be identical to
another abbreviation. Selection of the correct meaning of a
polysemic word requires understanding of the context of
occurrence. For example, in the sentence 'The Drosophila

peanut gene is required for cytokinesis and encodes a protein
similar to yeast putative bud neck filament proteins' (PMID
8181057), 'peanut' corresponds to a fly gene name, whereas in
'Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) forms root nodules in a unique
process.' (PMID 18256023) it corresponds to the name of a
plant. Text-mining tools must be able to select the correct
sense of a word dependent on its context (word sense disambiguation). Disambiguation is particularly important in correctly associating genes mentioned in the literature with their
corresponding database entries. Gene names are a problem
because they are often shared across species, especially
between mouse and human. Chen and colleagues [40]
showed that general English words had a relative low ambiguity (0.57%) when compared with the greater ambiguity of
medical terms (1.01%) or the much greater ambiguity among
gene names (14.20%).
The biomedical and life science literature also relies on heavy
use of short forms (acronyms or abbreviations), leading to
further ambiguity [41]. For instance, the acronym APC can
correspond to one of the following expanded forms, depending on its context: antigen-presenting cells, adenomatous
polyposis coli, activated protein C, anaphase-promoting complex, and argon plasma coagulation (based on the output of

Genome Biology 2008, 9(Suppl 2):S8

Genome Biology 2008,

Acromine [42]). Accessible online search tools for acronymfull name pairs include ADAM [43], the Abbreviation Sever
[44], and AcroMine [42].

The tokenization process is related to morphological analysis
of the internal structure of the words. For example, the use of
suffixes to detect protein mentions in the literature has been
studied in detail [32]. The process of 'stemming' can be
viewed as a kind of (impoverished) morphological processing,
which maps words into their 'stems', thus reducing variability
and providing better clusters. The intuition is that the meaning is carried predominantly by the stem or root, and therefore it is appropriate to collapse variants into a single class.
Stemming is heavily used in document retrieval and clustering applications for building models of word distribution
across document collections. Most current applications use
general stemming strategies such as the Porter Stemmer algorithm [53], but also some recent efforts rely on specific biomedical stemmers [54].

As new biological discoveries are made, new experimental
methods are developed and novel gene names (or their synonyms) and functional terms are created [45]. Thus, existing
lexical resources and annotation databases must be constantly updated to integrate this new information. To add to
the problem, biologists often do not adhere to naming standards [46]. As a result, simple dictionary look-up based techniques are not effective in detecting novel names that are not
yet contained in a database; therefore, these names can not be
directly identified by pattern matching, but must be extracted
based on contextual information, such as occurrence before
the word 'gene', or because the term precedes the phrase '... is
transcribed'.

Tokenization and morphology: identifying words in
biological text
The first step in processing any text requires segmentation of
the string of characters into words. Normally, word boundaries (in English) are indicated by white space, and a sentence
boundary is indicated by '.' (period or full stop). However,
there are many complications, particularly in the scientific literature; examples include use of '.' in decimals ('1.09'), use of
'/' to link multiple gene names ('waf/cip-1'), or variable use of
white space in gene names, such as 'BRCA 2' versus 'BRCA-2'.
Tokenization typically requires typographical processing at
the character level, to handle special characters and white
space, upper case and lower case, superscripts and subscripts,
and equivalence of Roman, Greek, and numerical suffixes
('TNFa' versus 'TNF-alpha'). For example, in order to retrieve
all of the mentions of the BRCA2 gene in the literature, a gene
mention retrieval system would need to capture at least the
following typographical variants: Brca2, Brca-2, BRCA-2, and
BRCA 2. To improve tokenization of life science articles, the
JULIE (Jena University Language and Information Engineering) laboratory provides tools that can be used for detecting token and sentence boundaries [47].
This stage of processing is very important, particularly for
systems that identify gene mentions and link these mentions
to specific entries in biological resources (gene normalization); see [48] (especially Table 2 in that report) for a list of
techniques and resources used in the systems participating in
the BioCreative II gene mention task. Some of the teams that
participated in BioCreative II [49] explored the integration
and use of publicly available gene mention taggers, such as
the ABNER application [50] or the LingPipe system [51]. At
the data preprocessing stage, token segmentation also plays a
role in correctly normalizing (linking) gene mentions to database records, as was shown by participants of the BioCreative
II gene normalization task [52].

Lexical and semantic resources for biology
Functional descriptions of bio-entities, relevant biological
processes, or experimental techniques are often expressed in
scientific papers using domain-specific technical terms. Terminological repositories and dictionaries are important
resources to assist in the interpretation of scientific articles,
but also for building biomedical ontologies used for extracting biological annotations and to assist authors in consistent
use of domain specific terminology.
Fortunately, as part of the development of biological databases, biologists and database curators have made available
important resources cataloging and organizing the terms and
their synonyms used in these areas. In addition, there are an
increasing number of ontologies being developed for various
fields and subfields of biology, particularly the GO [55]. Biomedical ontologies, and especially GO, are widely used as
controlled vocabulary to describe biologically relevant
aspects of gene products. Although GO was primarily
designed for annotation purposes, it can also be used as a lexical resource for indexing and navigating the biomedical literature through the underlying network of concepts using the
GoPubMed application [52,56]. The GOAnnotator tool [57]
allows extraction of text-based GO annotations for a given
protein identifier (SwissProt accession number) by automatically mapping all of the protein names contained in the corresponding SwissProt record to PubMed abstracts. These
abstracts are then associated with GO terms based on text
similarity between the term and abstracts, using the GO hierarchy to improve the overall precision [58]. The GO annotation assignment task of BioCreative I showed that, in general,
the automatic detection of GO terms was more efficient in
case of short terms, and especially for terms corresponding to
the cellular component category [59].
In addition, as seen in both the first BioCreative and this
recent BioCreative, expert curated databases provide important 'gold standard' datasets that can be used in formal evaluations, such as BioCreative, or to explore new tasks.
Automatically linking information from life science literature

into structured representations was pioneered by Mark Craven [60].

Many current literature mining approaches rely on statistical
analysis of word occurrences, calculated over the whole
PubMed database and resulting in weighted associations
between biological entities. The underlying assumption of
these global strategies is that if two biological entities frequently co-occur together or appear in similar contexts (documents), then they should have some biological relationship.
These methods can provide 'high recall' systems that return
large numbers of possibly relevant documents. Such datasets
can be refined by use of more sophisticated (and time consuming) processors such as relation extraction systems that
examine single sentences. Such systems have the potential to
capture multi-document based relations that are currently
missing in curated biological databases.

At the word level, valuable resources include gene/protein
name dictionaries compiled from biological annotation databases such as SwissProt, as well as domain-specific ontologies
(for example, GO) and thesauri. For example, BioThesaurus
is a widely used resource [61] that has compiled gene and protein names from multiple sources. Such resources can be
used, for example, by dictionary look-up based strategies to
link articles to protein database records automatically [62], or
to develop controlled vocabularies of functional terms [56].
However, as discussed above, existing resources may not
cover all the genes and proteins and their many variations
and abbreviations; in addition, the more complete the
resource, the more likely it is to contain terms that have multiple meanings. For terminology development, the TerMine
system developed at the National Centre for Text Mining
(NaCTeM) integrates an automatic term recognition
approach using linguistic and statistical analysis of candidate
terms [63].

Biomedical literature processing applications

Statistical co-occurrence based relation extraction poses a
challenge in terms of human interpretation, because it lacks
semantic information on the type of biological association.
Systems such as the CoPub Mapper [65] provide online access
to ranked co-occurrence associations extracted from PubMed
between genes and biological terms (for instance, from GO or
disease names) and the PubGene system generates a graphical protein interaction network based on protein-protein literature co-occurrences [66].

(stems) and are an essential component of information
retrieval systems and search engines [67]. One common
shortcoming when using stemming algorithms is that they
sometimes collapse two semantically different words to a
common stem. Stemming has been used by systems to quantify the similarity between documents (for example, eTBlast
[68]) and by document categorization [69] or document clustering [70] approaches.

Biomedical literature processing tools provide access to information contained in scientific articles at various levels of
granularity, both in terms of the queries supported as well as
in terms of the results. We describe the building blocks for
biomedical text processing with reference to the general BioCreative tasks:

• Entity mention, which requires identification of mentions of
biological entities (for BioCreative I and II, specifically genes
or proteins) in text.
• Entity normalization, which links biological entities, such as
genes or proteins, to biological resources, such as SWISSPROT or Entrez Gene.

Document retrieval
Document retrieval requires the ability to process and index
massive volumes of data (for instance, the entire MEDLINE
collection). This means that techniques used to index the collection must be robust and efficient with respect to space and
time. For biomedical processing, the most obvious approximation [64] is to look for keywords that characterize a collection of papers, based on keyword frequency. This system
forms the basis of neighbor searches in MEDLINE, which is
the predecessor of eT-Blast and still the most heavily used
system. Many subsequent approaches have used alternative
strategies for collecting papers and obtaining statistics for
words or terms, with or without context.

At the document level, text processing applications like
CoPub [65] detect over-represented terms from multiabstract collections, a strategy which uses automatically generated document-gene links to provide biological context, to
assist in the interpretation of sets of genes resulting from
large scale experiments, such as gene expression microarrays.
Text similarity algorithms have been integrated into eTBlast
[68], an online application ranking the retrieved PubMed
records according to their similarity to a given input query
article. This kind of system represents a useful strategy for
authors to improve retrieval of relevant references when writing a scientific publication, as well as a practical system for
publishers to avoid plagiarism. Clustering algorithms have
been used to group genes according to their expression profiles in microarray experiments or to build phylogenetic trees
by examining similarities of biological sequences. For protein
sequences, a common strategy for measuring similarity uses
weighting of amino acids based on their substitution rates
[71]; similarly, for calculating document similarity, terms are
often weighted according the number of times a term occurs
in a given document (term frequency using local or within-

document information) and by the number of documents
containing this term (document frequency, using global, or
within-collection information) [72].

mention detection systems. Most of the current bio-entity
recognition systems, like GAPSCORE [80] or ABGENE [32],
can label text for protein or gene mentions; other applications, such as ABNER [50], also identify cell lines or cell
types. Other biological entities of interest include chemical
compound mentions, a crucial component for systems trying
to extract biological pathways, and enzyme-ligand associations. Oscar is an open source system for recognizing chemical entity mentions; it integrates a dictionary of compound
names, as well as using regular expressions, heuristics, and
certain word combinations to find chemical names in text
[81].

Document clustering approaches using document similarity
calculations have been used by PubClust [73] and McSyBi
[74] to structure further the collection of articles retrieved by
keyword searches. A recurrent challenge in both bioinformatics and text processing is the classification of a collection of
items into a set of predefined categories. The assignment of
labels to whole documents, sentences, or individual word
tokens given their context (sentence) has been addressed
using machine learning techniques for cases where suitable
manually labeled training text collections have been constructed. Some published systems use document classification strategies to detect whether a given article describes
biologically relevant aspects, such as protein interactions,
subcellular location information [75], or even enzyme kinetic
parameters [76].
For humans it is often more effective to retrieve specific
descriptive sentences or passages rather than to look at whole
documents or abstracts. Also, for information extraction tools
extracting relations between biological entities, the detection
of sentences potentially containing these associations can
improve performance [77]. Therefore, specific sentence classification strategies have been proposed both for genetic
interactions [77] and for protein interactions [33].

Gene mention and gene normalization
Biologists often search annotation databases using gene/protein names or symbols as queries. The names currently stored
in such resources have been manually extracted from the literature, a time-consuming task that generally is unable to
cover all of the synonyms or naming variants used by biologists for each gene and mentioned in the literature. Automatic
detection of protein and gene mentions from the literature is
not only useful to improve coverage of annotation databases
or to enable a semantically refined literature search, but also
constitutes a crucial initial step for other text-mining applications that extract relations or properties of these biological
entities. Detection of gene mentions is the focus of the BioCreative gene mention task; see [78] for a summary of the
approaches used in BioCreative II. The performance of gene
mention systems has increased from the first BioCreative,
and when multiple systems are combined the combined BioCreative II systems have achieved an estimated F measure
(harmonic mean of precision and recall) of over 90% (see
[78]). Because most entity mention tagging systems rely
heavily on machine learning and statistical methods, they
have benefited greatly from availability of large quantities of
training and test data. For BioCreative II, there were 15,000
training sentences and 5,000 blind test sentences.
Krallinger and Valencia [79] provide an overview of current
systems and discuss the main difficulties encountered by gene

Volume 9, Suppl 2, Article S8

Krallinger et al. S8.9

Finding mentions of species and taxonomic names is not only
important for the emerging field of biodiversity informatics
[82], but constitutes a crucial step in linking gene mentions to
their corresponding organism source. Therefore, systems
such as TaxonFinder (uBioRSS) [83] or TaxonGrab [84] that
tag taxonomic names in electronic literature can provide
improved access and integration of species-specific information contained in publications.
The detection of bio-entity mentions alone is often not
enough to retrieve informative sentences efficiently, especially when the resulting document collection is of considerable size. The BioIE system tries to detect, for a given query
keyword, only those sentences describing aspects related to
protein families, functions, structural characteristics as well
as associations to diseases [85]. Other applications such as
iHOP map a given gene or protein query name to its corresponding database identifier and then retrieve a collection of
sentences with definition information, highlighting co-occurring MeSH terms [86]. An alternative to providing term cooccurrence sentences is offered by EBIMed and FACTA,
which - for a given query protein - present a summary table of
co-occurring concepts based on PubMed abstracts. These
concepts include other proteins, GO terms, drugs, and species
mentions for EBIMed [87], and proteins, diseases, symptom,
drugs, and compounds in the case of FACTA. FABLE allows
retrieval of all the co-occurring gene and protein mentions for
a query keyword, applying a context-based disambiguation
strategy to determine whether a possible mention corresponds to a gene or not (also expanding gene searches with its
corresponding synonyms). Results retrieved from FABLE can
be downloaded in several formats, including XML and Excel.
When searching the literature for functional information for
gene products, it is not necessary to use gene names as queries. Instead of using gene names, searches can be conducted
using protein sequences through the METIS [88] or the MedBlast [89] systems. They integrate the intermediate step of
sequence similarity searches to link the query sequence to its
corresponding database record and then automatically
retrieve the associated literature, exploiting the corresponding gene names and citations provided in the database
records. Figure 3 provides an overview of the main user query

types and text mining applications relevant to the biomedical
domain.

Beyond BioCreative: advanced applications

The extraction of biological relations between bio-entities can
provide insights into their functional characteristics.
Attempts have been made by Rodriguez-Penagos and colleagues to automatically extract genetic interactions from
abstracts and full-text articles, in order to improve efficiency

of the manual curation effort of transcriptional regulatory
networks in the Escherichia coli database RegulonDB [90].
Other systems such as iHOP and InfoPubMed allow retrieval
of protein interaction sentences from PubMed. iHOP links
the interacting proteins to their corresponding database
records and allows navigation in the resulting network of cooccurring interaction proteins as well as building a graphical
interaction network. In the case of InfoPubMed, first an interaction summary is generated for a given query protein and

then, by dragging the selected interaction pair into a content
viewer, the evidence sentences are displayed. For finding supporting relationship evidence between two predefined entities of interest (genes, proteins, keywords), or even between
two lists of entities, the Chilibot application [91] can be used.
It also generates a graphical network summarizing the relationships, providing qualifiers for the type of relation (stimulative, inhibitory, neutral).

Conclusion

Recent text-mining applications have tackled the extraction
of specific biological attributes of genes or proteins, such as
their sequences, polymorphisms and mutations, residue
modifications (for example, phosphorylation), or even their
subcellular locations. MutationFinder [92], a rule-based system, can extract amino acid mutation mentions from large
text collections. Other approaches like MarkerInfoFinder try
to detect information related to sequence variants of human
genes, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms and other
types of genetic markers, and their association with diseases
[93]. To develop the PepBank database [94] containing a collection of peptide sequences, a text-mining system was used
that automatically detected and extracted peptide sequence
mentions from abstracts and full-text papers. The Phospho.ELM database [95] integrated a text-mining system in
order to automatically detect S/T/Y phosphorylation sites
from the literature.
Increasing interest in studying epigenetic modifications of
the human genome and its association with diseases such as
cancer motivated the development of two other online tools,
namely MeInfoText [96] and PubMeth [97], which use textmining to provide detailed information on gene methylation
and association with cancer. Knowledge about the subcellular
location of proteins can provide meaningful contextual information about potential interaction partners or protein function. The EpiLoc system [75] constitutes a text-based
subcellular location prediction tool, effectively complementing alternative sequence-based localization prediction
algorithms.
Mining the literature also offers an opportunity to extract
indirect associations or discover new relationships based on
the analysis of multi-document collections. High-throughput
experimental setups often result in large lists of candidate
genes that must be experimentally characterized in more
detail. To rank (prioritize) genes according to some co-occurring user-defined keyword, the PDQ Wizard [98] allows interactive filtering of results and display of publication
information to customize the ranking strategy. The literaturebased discovery system ARROWSMITH [99] supports
extraction of indirect relationships between two different topics or keywords by examining the commonalities (shared
words and phrases) between the two article collections mentioning to each topic.

Volume 9, Suppl 2, Article S8

Krallinger et al. S8.11

Existing biomedical literature processing applications cover
retrieval, ranking, or clustering of relevant articles for a particular topic or bio-entity. There are tools developed for the
extraction of biological associations such as protein interactions, gene regulation, or functional annotations, as well as
detection of biologically relevant properties for genes and
proteins such as sequence mutations or gene methylation
information. A collection of application descriptions and
links to the corresponding online systems, together with relevant references, can be found online [100]. To be of practical
value for the life science community, developers of text mining applications need to keep in mind some critical issues,
listed below.

Linking literature to experimental results
Linking text directly to unique database identifiers or
sequences is crucial, especially because protein and gene
names are often ambiguous. Modern biology is characterized
by experimental studies examining large collections of genes
or proteins; therefore, text-mining systems should support
retrieval of relevant information from the literature for gene/
protein lists, not just single gene queries. For experimental
sciences such as molecular biology, efficient access to experimental information is crucial. Thus, automatic extraction of
evidence qualifiers is crucial when automatically extracting
protein interaction relations or annotations of gene products
with functional concepts (for example, GO terms) from the
literature. Aspects of interest include experimental techniques supporting these relations, type of experimental set up
(in vivo/in vitro), and relevant contextual information such
as cell lines, tissues, or model organism systems.

Linking text mining to bioinformatics resources
Bioinformatics applications and biological databases frequently provide external references to other resources or
tools, which improve data integration and allow, for example,
navigation from functional annotation databases to protein
family or structure information. Biomedical literature
processing tools should improve both the connection to other
literature mining systems (for example, through meta-systems) as well as to existing biological annotation resources
and bioinformatics applications. Integration of additional
data types such as figures and also specific processing of
tables and references from full-text articles, patents, and ebooks will gain importance in the future because of the
increasing number of electronically available texts stored in
open access repositories. To allow robust integration of different systems, standards for commonly accepted text annotation formats and use of controlled vocabularies and
ontologies are essential aspects.

Accessibility, flexibility, update, and maintenance of
literature mining systems
Journal publications provide useful pointers to resources and
software, but usually only a subset of the corresponding URLs

are links to stable systems [101]. To be of practical value to
both users of the biology community and to text-mining
developers, there must be not only a detailed description of
algorithms and text-mining methods for a system, but also a
stable implementation of the corresponding system. Ideally,
the implementation of any published application should be
accessible through multiple strategies: as an online system,
enabling flexible navigation and visualization of extracted
information, with facilities for saving and exporting results in
various formats; as a web service for a more programmatic
access, providing predictions in standard formats such as
XML; and even as a package that can be installed locally and
customized for other specialized systems. Considering the
accelerating pace of new discoveries in molecular biology
reported in scientific articles, it is also crucial that text-mining systems be systematically maintained and updated, periodically including new publications. Literature processing
tools must be efficient enough to scale up, processing the
entire PubMed database as well as large collections of fulltext articles available in a range of different formats.

papers corresponding to different proteins that share the
same name or abbreviation).
Biologists and database curators often carry out repetitive
multi-step literature searches, using the output generated by
one literature search as input for the next one. Text-mining
workflows inspired by manual literature searches and curation pipelines might be useful in the future, but only if automatically generated text-based outputs are accurate enough
to produce meaningful results. With the increasing specialization in molecular biology research and the pressing need to
keep up with new scientific discoveries, there is also a clear
need for personalized literature recommender systems and
text-mining systems that can provide for each scientist the
information that he or she is particularly interested in [102].
Systems such as Mscanner, which classify the literature based
on a collection of user defined PubMed articles, constitute a
step in this direction [103].

Abbreviations
Comparative evaluation and user interaction
To determine the performance of literature processing tools,
meaningful system evaluations and comparative studies with
other methods are necessary. Initiatives such as the BioCreative challenges provide the opportunity for text-mining developers to participate in independent community assessment
studies, which are especially important, given the difficulty in
constructing suitable evaluation datasets. Current systems
could benefit from formal characterizations of the main end
user types, detecting their specific needs and allowing user
interaction and feedback to be taken into account for iterative
improvement of system usability. Efficient ranking and reliability scoring of results are helpful to improve retrieval of the
desired information, reducing the workload in terms of manual examination of the text mining output. Accurate documentation and clear examples of what a given system can
actually do and what it should be used for can bring literature
processing strategies closer to the end users. Most of the biological literature is currently published in English, but when
trying to bridge clinically relevant aspects, there is a clear
need for cross-language information extraction applications
to access articles published in other languages with functional
descriptions of biological entities.

Future challenges: personalized text mining and textmining workflows
Literature processing tools can go beyond the single document-based biological annotations that are currently stored
in biological databases by exploring the global collection of
available papers. Nevertheless, it remains difficult for
humans to interpret weighted relations based on multi-document collections. One of the potential sources of errors from
multi-document derived associations is related to incorrect
linking of articles to biological entities (for example, grouping
