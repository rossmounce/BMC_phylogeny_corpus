Abstract
DNA techniques, analytical methods and palaeoclimatic studies are greatly advancing our
knowledge of the global distribution of genetic diversity, and how it evolved. Such phylogeographic
studies are reviewed from Arctic, Temperate and Tropical regions, seeking commonalities of cause
in the resulting genetic patterns. The genetic diversity is differently patterned within and among
regions and biomes, and is related to their histories of climatic changes. This has major implications
for conservation science.

Introduction
Phylogeography, named by Avise et al in 1987 [1], is a
recent and rapidly developing field that concerns the geographical distribution of genealogical lineages. It grew
from the newly acquired technical ability to obtain DNA
sequence variation from individuals across a species
range, and from this to reconstruct phylogenies. These are
then plotted geographically to display their spatial relationships and deduce the evolutionary origins and history
of populations, subspecies and species [2,3]. Genetic relationships between species based on polytene chromosome banding patterns had been used earlier to deduce
the geographic history of colonization and speciation by
Drosophila of the Hawaiian Islands [4], and allozyme variation may still complement DNA information, but the
ready access to mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences
opened the door to most animal species and generated
this new field [5].
DNA methods
Whilst mtDNA has lead the way in animal phylogeography, other DNA sequences are used, most commonly

chloroplast (cp) in plants and non-coding nuclear (nc)
regions in both animals and plants. MtDNA has a relatively fast rate of nucleotide divergence, well suited to
examining events over the last few million years, but those
of cpDNA and ncDNA are an order of magnitude lower
and consequently less useful for such young divergences.
More slowly evolving sequences are required for deeper
phylogenetic history. For more recent events, like the last
10 thousand years, highly variable markers are needed,
such as microsatellites and AFLPs, but whilst useful for
population studies they suffer from homoplasy and produce equivocal genealogies [3].
Techniques for obtaining DNA sequence information are
still advancing rapidly, with whole genome sequences
being produced in a growing number of organisms. This
allows sequences and markers to be identified and developed for many types of investigation, and some will be
useful for phylogeographic studies. In particular, it is clear
that genealogical data is required from several independent nuclear loci to provide a fuller and more reliable history of the species [6]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms

(SNPs) are also becoming available across the genome,
which will produce comprehensive measures of genetic
diversity and allow the construction of better population
histories [7].
Analytical approaches
The advance in DNA technology is producing a wealth of
data for individuals, populations and species, and there
are concomitant developments in analytical methods to
divine demographic history and evolutionary relationships, and to test their significance. This progress in analysis is facilitated by access to increasingly powerful
desktop computers on which the increasingly sophisticated software can be used. Haplotype sequences of a particular DNA region can be ordered into a genealogical tree
or network, and hence produce their phylogeny. When
combined with their population frequency and geographic distribution, this provides a strong basis for inferences on the evolutionary history of the populations and
species. The usual phylogeographic approach is to build a
phylogeny from haplotype sequences using distance, parsimony and maximum likelihood methods and then represent the lineages geographically. There are several
approaches that are regularly used, such as DNA Distance
Phylogeography, Nested Clade Analysis, Haplotype Networks, Sequence Mismatch Distribution and Genetic and
Demographic Simulation, e.g. PAUP and GeoDis [8-10].
This last approach uses computers to explore broadly how
DNA markers evolve in specified molecular, spatial and
demographic conditions over history, and is being used
increasingly [11]. Recent developments seek to use the
genetic data to estimate the demographic history of a population, the dates of historical bottlenecks or expansions,
the size of ancestral populations, the location of refugial
areas, the dates of divergence, the extent of migration and
gene flow, the extent of fragmentation, and the sequence
of such events to produce the present geographic distribution of genotypes, e.g. [12-15]. We can expect further
developments to provide even more discriminating
analyses.

Each DNA sequence has its own genealogy and they may
evolve at different rates. Furthermore, the various methods of analysis probe different aspects of the molecular
and spatial history. Consequently, to reconstruct a species
phylogeographic history one would ideally like to use a
range of sequences (including nuclear, cytoplasmic, sexlinked, autosomal, conserved, neutral, high and low
mutation rate) and apply a suite of pertinent analyses.
This is not easy and often not possible with resources
available. However, technological advances for molecules
and computers have been explosive in the past decade,
making much more detailed analysis possible today than
only a few years ago, and this looks set to continue.

Paleoclimate and Paleobiology
The very different field of paleoclimatology is also experiencing great advances. The results of these are most pertinent to phylogeographic explanations, since they reveal
the past environmental conditions and changes that have
molded the evolutionary processes producing the present
genetic structure. They provide a framework in which the
phylogeny may be reconstructed. Past conditions can be
deduced from carbon and oxygen isotopes, radiolarian
skeletons, pollen grains and other residues from the sea
bed, lake bottoms and ice sheets [16]. Novel information
sources like insect exoskeletons, coral terraces and stalagmites are adding to this [17-20]. Such records show that
earth's climate has been cooling for some 60 my with periodic (21, 41 and 100 kyr) global oscillations producing
increasingly severe ice ages through the Quaternary (2.4
my). These involved greatly enlarged ice sheets and surrounding permafrost, and the lower temperatures and
reduced water availability caused great changes in the distribution of species as demonstrated by the fossil record
[16,21]. Nested within the major 100 kyr cycles are millennial scale oscillations, which can occur rapidly and are
often severe [22,23]. Changes of 7–15°C may occur in
decades and persist for centuries, as happened most
recently in the Younger Dryas (11 kya), where fossils
record shifts in the distributions of species.

These major changes in distributions of species occurred
latitudinally as the ice sheets advanced and retreated, altitudinally in major mountain regions, and also longitudinally where new dispersal routes became available, as for
example the Bering land bridge produced by the lowered
sea level. The demographic fluctuations and adaptive
challenges produced by such range changes would have
had both stochastic and selective effects on the genetic
variation and architecture, and the consequences of these
can be studied by genetic and phylogeographic
approaches. Thus the once distinct fields of paleobiology
and phylogeography are now being combined, and have
much to tell us about how present biodiversity was
structured.

Fossil and Genetic Signals of Range Changes
With some effort it is now possible to obtain DNA data
from specimens across the present range of a species, but
fossil data is often more limited or absent. The most useful fossil data are for Europe and North America, which
have extensive networks of pollen cores; a few span 3 ice
ages (400 kyr), several reach the last interglacial (125 kyr),
and a larger number cover back to the last glacial maximum (LGM 23-18 kyr) [21]. There are also some helpful
detailed series of beetle exoskeletons [24]; animal bones
and plant macrofossils tend to be localized and discontinuous, but are nonetheless useful markers of time and
place. Reconstructions of paleovegetation have been

made, e.g. [25], which are quite detailed from the LGM to
the present, and when coupled with other fossil evidence
indicate the extent and rapidity of changes in species
distributions.

lations and processes involved in colonization [30]; this
can also be combined with paleo-information to deduce
the intraspecific phylogeographic history.

Higher Latitudes – the Arctic
During the LGM the ice sheets and permafrost extended
towards lower latitudes, so that generally species distributions were compressed toward the equator. Boreal species
survived south of the ice in North America and Europe,
but large areas of the north eastern Palearctic and Beringia
remained ice free and some cold-hardy species appear to
have survived here. Temperate species survived further
south where habitats occurred to which they were each
adapted. In Europe the disjunct southern peninsulas of
Iberia, Italy and Balkans were particularly important,
while in North America many temperate locations
occurred around 40°N between the East and West coasts.
Nearer the equator the pollen record is not extensive, but
conditions were generally drier in the LGM and Tropical
habitats were reduced while desert and savanna increased.
As a consequence, the habitats of many Boreal, Temperate
and Tropical species were reduced and fragmented and
they survived in refugia; but for some their habitats
expanded, like those in the tundra and savanna. As the climate warmed after the LGM and the ice retreated, many
Boreal and Temperate species were able to expand their
ranges, as were some Tropical species. In some cases the
refugial populations died out, but particularly in mountainous regions they could survive by ascending with the
climate and their niche, as for example in the Alps, Andes,
Appalachians and Arusha mountains. Such refugial
regions allow the survival of species through several ice
age cycles by ascending and descending to track their habitat, e.g. [26].
Such events modify the genetic content and structure of
populations within species, and leave some traces for
which we may search. Populations, races and subspecies
that have been effectively separated for several glacial
cycles will show divergence through the accumulation of
neutral and possibly selected DNA changes. The extent of
this divergence will be proportional to the time of separation. The haplotype tree or network of an evolving DNA
sequence will reflect population expansions and contractions. Increasingly these effects can be analyzed, e.g. [27]
and placed in some order of occurrence. When the geographic positions of haplotypes are included, a further
range of deductions is possible. For example, recently
derived populations will contain a sample of the same
haplotypes as the parent populations, which combined
with paleo-information allows colonization routes to be
deduced [28,29]. The extent of distribution of younger
haplotypes compared with that of older ones in the tree
provides information on the past fragmentation of popu-

Most phylogeography has concerned Temperate biota
[2,26], but recently a number of species from higher latitudes have been analysed in sufficient detail across their
range to provide some first genetic insights into their biogeographic history. These include mammals, birds, fish,
crustaceans and plants adapted to such cold conditions
[31,32]. Table 1 contains some major studies of Holarctic
animal species complexes. During the LGM the greatly
extended Arctic ice sheets forced such species south, as evidenced by fossil records in Europe and North America. At
the same time, large areas of Northeast Asia and the NW
corner of North America were covered in permafrost but
not glaciated. Fossil evidence suggests that these also contained refugia, particularly Beringia [18,33,34] which with
lowered sea level joined Asia and America across the Bering Straits. The different range changes involved would be
expected to have various effects on the genetic diversity
that may have left marks of their occurrence and extent.
Distinct Parapatric Clades, Refugia and Range Changes
The phylogeographic structure, in terms of distinct
regional DNA clades, is very marked in some species like
the lemmings, voles and wren, moderate in the ptarmigan
and dunlin, and less in the more mobile waterflea, reindeer and herring gull. The extent of DNA divergence
between major clades in small mammals would suggest
effective separation of up to 1 Myr, some 5–10 full glacial
cycles, with further subdivision for shallower clades in
more recent ice ages. In the gull, ptarmigan and reindeer
the divergence among clades is low, indicating events
occurring in the last or penultimate glacial cycles. Such
recent structure would suggest that these species came
from or were reduced to a small ancestral population in
the late Pleistocene.

The deeper clades of the true and collared lemmings, the
root and field voles, and to some extent the shallow ones
of the ptarmigan and dunlin, are remarkably parapatric
and many contacts between them coincide around major
features like the Urals, Lena, Kolyma and MacKenzie Rivers (Fig 1) [32]. Regions where several subspecific and sister-specific boundaries coincide, called suture zones [35]
have been recorded in North America and Europe, and are
probably due to species having similar range changes and
refugial areas [29]. Thus these regional parapatric
genomes seem to have been diverging separately over a
number of ice ages, with distinct refugia from which they
colonized to fill their individual interglacial distributions.
The pattern of range changes may not be exactly the same
through each cycle, but there is no sign of genetic mixing

and refugia are likely to have been similar over the last few
ice ages. Other taxon contacts occur in these regions in
groups like birds and butterflies, and it will be informative
to investigate their phylogeographies to look for commonalties and causes.

for European and west Asian clades. An additional refugium in east Asia would account for the clades meeting in
the regions of the Lena and Kolyma Rivers, while fossils
for a number of species in Beringia indicate that it was
probably a significant refugium [32]. A recent detailed
examination of the phylogeography of the tundra vole in
Beringia [36] pinpoints the contact between the Central
Asian and Beringian clades on the Omolon River in the
Kolyma uplands, which formed a partially glaciated barrier during the last ice age. This would obviously affect
other species and provide the western boundary to many
Beringian distributions. The equivalent boundary of

caps and sheets are in white, and tundra is darker grey (I am grateful to Richard Abbott for the basic map).

Beringia in the east was formed by the North American ice
sheets which fringed Alaska from the MacKenzie River to
the Aleutian Ranges.
The contractions, expansions and distant colonizations
involved in these late Quaternary range changes would
have influenced the genetic diversity, and should have left
some signs. Low haplotype diversity and shallow clades
are expected when populations have been severely contracted, and the age of the subsequent expansion may be
gauged by mismatch analysis. The structure of haplotype
networks and nested clades also provide indications of

such events. Many of the populations and clades reported
show these features (Table 1 and references). For example,
tundra reindeer, herring gulls and rock ptarmigans have
shallow clades diverging in the recent ice ages and populations with mismatch analyses indicating postglacial
expansion and colonization of high Arctic regions. In
those species like the lemmings and voles where DNA lineage divergence goes back several ice ages to perhaps the
onset of more severe glaciations some 0.9 My, most clades
are shallow with low diversity, particularly those for Central Asia, suggesting extensive colonization from a much
reduced refugial source. This is an emerging feature of

some significance. It does seem that even for cold adapted
species life was hard in Central Asia during the ice age and
it provided few refugia.
Beringia – an Arctic Refugium
Beringia, which spans Eastern Siberia and Alaska, was
united and disjoined each Quaternary ice age by changes
in the sea level of some 120 m. It was only partly glaciated
and fossil evidence shows it supported a mixture of tundra
habitats, which allowed it to act as a causeway for continental migration between Asia and America for various
species, including humans. The history of Beringia is currently of interest and some of the lower parts now under
the Bering Sea probably had conditions suitable for mesic
tundra species even in colder times [18]. Several species
have a distinct genetic clade across Beringia and some of
these show higher diversity here than where previously
glaciated regions were colonized, supporting its role as a
glacial refugium [32]. A careful analysis of genetic diversity in the tundra, or root vole, Microtus oeconomus
through Beringia indicates that the Beringian voles probably expanded from a population with low genetic diversity, which had colonized from Central Asia in the
penultimate glacial cycle [36]. A broader phylogeographic
study on related taxa of red-backed voles, Clethrionomys,
demonstrated that North America has been colonized successfully from Asia at least twice, possibly three times in
the mid-Pleistocene, and C. rutilus reached Alaska quite
recently with the first Nearctic fossils in the Holocene
[37]. The phylogenies of a number of other species,
including Homo sapiens also indicate Beringia as a colonization corridor.

Analysis of the DNA differences among these Clethrionomys species reveals that they have been diverging from the
Early Pleistocene, whilst the divergence within the other
listed species is much younger (Table 1). An exception is
the winter wren, where there are six clades that appear to
have begun diverging some 1.6 Mya, suggesting possible
cryptic species [38]. These distinct clades contain low
diversity and signs of contraction and expansion. The species does not inhabit truly high Arctic habitats, reaching
down to more Temperate latitudes. It would seem that its
Holarctic range was progressively broken up by the
increasingly severe Pleistocene glaciations, with connection across the oceans, Beringia and the centres of the continents becoming more difficult or impossible as its more
Temperate range was forced south.

Mid Latitudes – Temperate Regions
So called Temperate species span a wide range of latitudes,
since the climate determinants like insolation, oceans and
altitude may produce suitable habitats between 20° and
60°. In Eurasia and North America those more cold hardy
species generally have more northerly distributions than

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/4

those better adapted to more southerly warmer climes,
and this will also be reflected in altitudinal range differences. This would also be true of distributions in glacial
periods, so that refugia for north Temperate species were
nearer to the ice and permafrost than those of more southerly ones. Fossil evidence is very important in properly
determining such Pleistocene range changes [39]. In the
Arctic species considered (Table 1), the winter wren and
field vole provide examples of low Arctic/north Temperate
species in what is a progression of adaptations, niches and
ranges on the cold to warm axis from pole to equator.
Refugia and Colonization in Europe and North America
Paleoclimate and phylogeography have been most
researched in Temperate Europe and North America, generating many particular examples and several more general conclusions [2,26]. In particular, the similarity
among DNA haplotypes across a species range allows the
deduction of which northern populations came from
which southern populations, and their likely postglacial
colonization routes. The fossil record underpins these
deductions, particularly for refugial areas and times of colonization [26,28]. Thus many species survived the LGM in
southern Europe, the centre and north being covered in
tundra and ice. Fossil and DNA evidence show that the
peninsulas of Iberia, Italy, Greece and the Balkans were
major refugia and contributed variously to the postglacial
recolonization of the north. Whilst a few mobile species
crossed from North Africa, the Mediterranean Sea appears
to have been a major barrier throughout the Quaternary.
For many species these southern refugial areas currently
contain much genetic diversity for haplotypes, lineages
and subspecific taxa. These southern parts of Europe are
also mountainous, so that species may survive by ascending and descending with climate changes. The extent of
genetic divergence among these peninsular populations
clearly indicates that for many species they have been
effectively separate for several to many ice ages. Importantly, this separate refugial survival is seen as a causative
factor in divergence and speciation [3,29]. It is possible to
deduce pathways of genetic divergence in a geographical
framework that has produced the continent's diversity of
populations, subspecies and species.

The fossil record, in particular that of pollen and beetles,
shows that postglacial colonization was to a large extent a
property of the individual species niche and the distribution of its habitat. Nonetheless, the patterns of DNA divergence within species have some common features, which
argue for common colonization processes and routes
[29]. Temperate species often show reduced haplotype
diversity in the north, which is considered to be the result
of rapid colonization with repeated founder events. This
is seen in many species in Europe and North America, e.g.
[28,40-46]. Furthermore the recolonized areas are often a

broad patchwork of distinct genomes that have emanated
from the different refugia, and which usually form hybrid
zones where they make contact. These hybrid zones in
different species often appear to be clustered together and
so may be considered to belong to suture zones [29,35].
In Europe the Balkan haplotypes and genomes provided
the main source for postglacial colonization for many species, while less came from Iberia and few came from Italy,
probably hindered by the ice-capped Pyrenees and Alps.
Species that exemplify these different patterns of colonization are the grasshopper, Chorthippus parallelus, the bear,
Ursus arctos, and the hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus/concolor [29]. Freshwater fishes like the chubb, Leuciscus ceph-

alus, often show colonization by different haplotypes up
the Danube and Dneiper Rivers from the Black Sea (Fig 2)
[32]. Many European species phylogeographies are
emerging and a considerable number broadly show these
distribution patterns and probably followed similar colonization routes despite differences in their niche, mobility
and life history. This apparent and remarkable commonality would seem to be a result of colonization following
postglacial climate change in Europe's particular geography of southern peninsulas, transverse mountain ranges
and northern plains. It demonstrates the explanatory

A particularly interesting consequence of these various
colonization routes is that northern regions like Scandinavia and the Pacific NW of America have biotas that are
mixtures of species whose genomes came from different
refugia [26]. Thus in Central Scandinavia the grasshopper
genome came from the Balkans, the bear from Iberia and
Russia, the hedgehog from Italy and the chubb from the
Black Sea. For the NW corner of America, where Alaska,
the Yukon and British Columbia meet, DNA evidence suggests that it has been colonized sequentially from four
directions; (1) initially from the south along the coast by
the long-tailed vole, dusky shrew, ermine and marten, (2)
then from the south by an inland route by all but the marten, (3) from Beringia by the ermine, and (4) from the
Appalachians by the marten, and possibly bears and
chickadees (Fig 2). Several plant species also colonized
probably along the two southern routes [32]. Such mixed
biotas carry a number of important implications. They
mean that the component species from different refugia
have not been evolving together during the previous glacial periods, so any close coadaptation must be either
postglacial, or possibly survive from when their distant
ancestors were sympatric. More general species-wide coadaptations may be maintained if the different species survive together in refugia. Where genomes from two or more
refugia come together, genetic diversity will be increased
by the presence of diverged lineages, as seen in hybrid and
suture zones. Two populations in the same region living
in similar habitats, but from different colonizing refugia
will possess very different alleles and genomes, while conversely two very distant populations in distinct habitats
may have the same refugial genome. This points to the
importance of population history in the process of post
glacial adaptation, and our understanding of it.
Mediterranean Latitudes – 30–40°N
The Mediterranean Sea, with Europe's refugial peninsulas
and mountains in the north and North Africa to the south
lies between roughly 30°N and 40°N, where at these latitudes in North America there are the Southern States
across the Appalachians and Rockies to California. While
in Europe the Scandinavian ice sheet came down to Warsaw about 52°N with extensive tundra to the south, the
Laurentide ice sheet reached near 40°N. below the Great
Lakes, with very little tundra and steppe. Such contrasts in
geography have produced differences in the phylogeography of species, but there are also similarities. Species in
these southern regions generally contain greater diversity
for alleles, populations and subspecies, which in several
form distinct geographic genomic patches. The divergence
among southern lineages and patches is often deeper than
further north, indicating a longer survival and probably in
the same region. This southern divergence is often estimated to be over many ice age cycles from the Early Pleistocene or even the Pliocene for some species [26]. The

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/4

best-studied regions in these latitudes are Iberia [47],
South Eastern USA [2] and West Coast USA [48-51].
Molecular phylogeography began in the SE USA [1] and
many terrestrial and aquatic species there have marked
genetic substructure with concordant genomic boundaries [52]. A number of recent studies in Iberia, covering a
range of organisms, e.g. beetles [53], lizards [54], salamanders [55], woodmice [45], rotifers [47], and several
plants, also show this intraspecific diversity and substructure, with lineages from as early as the Pliocene and often
in mountain regions. Likewise West Coast phylogeography for salamanders [56], woodrats [51], shrews [50],
frogs [57] and other species from California and the Cascades [49] reveals geographically structured lineages
diverging from the Pliocene and Pleistocene. This pattern
and divergence would seem to be a product of the geological and climate changes that have occurred, involving
major mountain building and Quaternary ice ages. Lineages and populations from the northern parts of such
southern regions, like the southern Appalachians, west
and central Iberia and the northern Cascades, appear to
have provided the main source for northward postglacial
colonization, while genomes to the south survived with
altitudinal shifts in broadly the same regions [32].
Species with distributions north and south of the Mediterranean Sea must have managed to cross this now major
barrier to terrestrial organisms at some stage before or
since the opening of the Gibraltar Straits some 5.3 Mya
after the Messinian crisis [58]. If this was before 5.3 My,
they are likely to have diverged to sister species if there has
been little gene flow. There are now phylogeographic
studies on a few species both terrestrial and volant. In terrestrial species of salamanders Salamandra spp and scorpions Buthus spp [59,60] the DNA data shows that the N
African/European divergence is old, before the opening of
the Gibraltar Straits. While in the woodmouse Apodemus
sylvaticus [45] the N African haplotypes appear recently
derived from southern Iberia, possibly transferred by
humans. Interestingly an old divergence in holm oak,
Quercus ilex, may also perhaps be due to humans [61].
Five flying species have been examined, of which the
chaffinch, bearded vulture and barbastelle bat [62-64]
have DNA phylogenies that indicate the Gibraltar Strait
has not been a major barrier. In dragonflies Calopteryx spp
[65] the North African genotypes are related to the Italian
ones, and in honey bees [66] some African mtDNA haplotypes are found in south Iberia and Sicily, but nuclear
markers indicate little migration. These latter two species
and the bearded vulture appear to have crossed the
Sicilian Channel, which was also narrow during the lowered sea level of the pleniglacials.

Lower Latitudes – Tropics and Savannah
Much of Africa, South America, South East Asia and North
Australia lie in the Tropics. They are rich in species
diversity, but with a few notable exceptions little is known
of their phylogeography or their paleobiology [26]. During the recent ice ages the climate was colder and drier in
the Tropics, with increased deserts and savannah and
reduced rain forests. The pollen record is unfortunately
poor, but it seems that forest species descended the mountains (~6°C lower LGM), while lowland forest species
may have survived in many local wet places and gullies
[16,67,68]. It would seem clear that even tropical biotas
have undergone repeated changes as a result of climatic
oscillations through the Quaternary [26,69].
Wet Tropics
Several phylogeographic studies from American and Australian rainforests and a few from Africa and Asia indicate
that there is great genetic diversity produced by a complex
history often diverging in the Pliocene [26,70]. A nice
example of this has been studied in the montane forests of
the central Divide of Costa Rica, where a North American

salamander Bolitoglossa has radiated into tropical Middle
America [71]. There are strong allozyme and mtDNA differences between several populations only a few kilometres apart (Dnei 0.18, cytb 4%), and 2 putative species
within 10 km (Dnei 0.45, cytb 9%). Such genetic distances indicate divergence from the late Pliocene through
the Pleistocene. This has involved several adaptations to
elevation zones that would have been amplified by local
topographic isolation and climatic oscillations. These
amphibians may have peculiar attributes, but phylogeographies of birds and freshwater fish in Middle America are
also complex with many lineages [72]. There are few studies yet, but it may be that the phylogeographic status of
Bolitoglossa is not so unusual. Recently over 100 species of
rhacophorine tree frog were described in Sri Lanka using
mtDNA in combination with exophenotypic measures,
when only 18 were previously known, and despite recent
extinctions by Man's activities [73]. This suggests that
tropical biotas are not only amazingly diverse but highly
structured genetically, both above and below the species
level.

Genetic studies in tropical rainforests of SW Amazonia
and NE Australia show phylogeographic divergence that is
geographically concordant across a number of taxa and
also originating in the Pliocene. The first set concern some
35 species of small mammals sampled along the Jurua
River, and where for the majority there is a deep phylogenetic divide coincident with the Iquitos Arch. This formed
as a bulge in front of the uplifting Andes in the Pliocene
creating two basins that filled with sediment. The depth of
mtDNA divergence between clades in these two basins
places their separation at this time [74]. The Iquitos Arch
is also implicated in the phylogeographic structure of the
dart-poison frog Epipedobates femoralis, which was also
sampled along the Jurua River traversing this ancient
ridge, and which also has coincident mtDNA divergence
(cytb 12%) dating to the Pliocene [75]. Interestingly, the
collection sites differed markedly for their haplotypes,
particularly in the headwaters region, again suggesting
considerable local genetic structure. There has been a multitude of hypotheses proffered to explain the structure of
Amazonian diversity, and such molecular phylogeographic approaches are beginning to distinguish amongst
them.
The second set of phylogeographic studies involves several birds, reptiles and frogs from the remnant strip of
tropical forest in NE Queensland [76]. This wet forest has
undergone contraction and fragmentation during the
drier colder stages and expanded in the interglacials.
These show concordant mtDNA divergence that possibly
dates back to the Late Pliocene. This is coincident with the
Black Mountain Corridor, a narrow region from which
rainforest disappeared in the Pleistocene ice ages producing main north and south refugia. The north and south
clusters of haplotypes have various structures, some of
which show low diversity probably due to population
contractions during the ice age, while others have retained
more haplotype diversity possibly by survival in local
patches of forest. The rainforest snail Gnarosophia bellendenkerensis also shows these main phylogeographic features, and with some finer subdivisions. Its distribution
from the LGM to the present has been modeled using current climate envelopes for this snail species mapped onto
reconstructed paleoclimate distributions [77]. There is
good agreement between the changes in the modeled
snail distribution from the LGM to the Holocene and the
signals from mtDNA data of refugial locations and expansions. Such an approach provides support for the deductions
of
both
paleoclimatic
modeling
and
phylogeography. Furthermore, the relationship between
particular paleoclimatic changes and genetic structure is
sharpened by studies on other species from this region
that are not adapted to rainforest, like grasshoppers and
frogs [78,79]. These species show genetic subdivision that
is coincident with other physical features that would pro-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/4

vide refugia and barriers commensurate with their lifestyle
and climatic history, such as the coastal humidity transition or Burdekin Gap.
The phylogeographic pattern demonstrated by amphibians, reptiles and small mammals, is also found in bird
species from tropical Africa and South America, which
show old Pliocene lineages in the lowland forest and
mixed old and recently diverged clusters in the mountains. This has lead to the proposal that such mountains
provided a relatively stable environment through the ice
ages and rising mountains, in which older lineages survived and new ones were created [80]. DNA divergence in
spinetails from the Andes [81] and greenbuls from East
Africa [82] provide evidence of montane speciation
through the Pleistocene. Such mountain ranges appear to
act as generators and reservoirs of lineages and species,
and this probably is a function of their low latitude and
topographic variety, which provide warm wet habitats
through climatic and altitudinal range changes. The
repeated small shifts in distribution driven by climate,
along with continued uplifting of these mountains would
provide conditions for contraction, selection, expansion
and speciation.
Dry Tropics
There have been a number of recent DNA studies of several larger mammals from Africa that provide some interesting insights into how Pleistocene climatic changes
modified their ranges and hence their genetic structure
and divergence (Table 2). Whilst sampling such species
across Africa is a major task, the threat posed by reductions in their numbers means that considerable efforts are
being made to assess their genetic makeup for management and conservation, and many have a useful fossil
record. They are not inhabitants of the wet forests, which
were reduced during the colder drier glacial periods, but
are found largely in the savannah grasslands and woodlands that had a different pattern of contraction and
expansion. These habitats increased with the onset of the
Pleistocene and its increasing glacial activity (3-2 Mya),
with periods of dominance recorded around 1.7 and 1.2
Mya. They show increasing prevalence from 0.6 Mya
through the Late Pleistocene, and fossils record the emergence of the associated mammal species and their subspecies since then (see references in Table 2). The DNA data,
although not an accurate measure over this time scale,
also indicates that these are recent events with most divergences in the last 0.4 My.

Most phylogeographies show some 3 major clades that
are associated with 3 main areas of Tropical Africa, the
west, east and south, indicating that these have been
major refugial areas for the development of this divergence through climatic cycles in the Late Pleistocene (Fig

3). Many have shallow clades, mismatch analyses and
star-like networks that are the expected result of contractions and expansions of these populations, and their phylogeographies indicate various colonizations between
these major regions. In three species, the wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, greater kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros and
the impala Aepyceros melampus, the data support colonization northwards to the east from refugia in the south of

Africa [83,84]. The greater kudu and impala have distinct
SW clades, which suggests isolation and survival there, as
well as central South Africa, where many species appear to
have had a refugium. Interestingly the first wildebeest fossils are from east Africa, so that the species seems to have
disappeared from this region and been recolonized
recently from the south.

On the other hand, the Cape buffalo Synercus caffer caffer
has younger haplotypes in the south, which along with
mismatch analyses suggest one or two recent colonizations from populations in eastern Africa. The DNA divergence of these from central African buffalo subspecies is
perhaps only 180-130 kyr, and roughly coincident with
the Cape buffalo's genetic expansion and evidence from
fossils [85]. The hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus and the
topi Damaliscus lunatus probably survived in a few places
in southern and eastern Africa from which they expanded
with better conditions [83,86]. The warthog Phacochoerus
africanus is now relatively widespread, but has 3 distinct
clades equivalent to subspecies, and with low divergence
within each one [87]. This points to strong isolation
through the last few ice ages with considerable recent population reduction followed by population expansion.
The mtDNA phylogeny of the African elephant is more
complexly structured, with haplotypes of the putative species of forest Loxodonta cyclotis and savannah L. africanus
elephants mixed together in several clades [88]. It suggests
successive production of clades from the early Pleistocene,
which involved colonization from the centre to the south
and east with increasing savannah habitats, loss of competitors and punctuated by climatic cycles. Such admixture of clades in regions and taxa is probably a reflection
of several such colonizations, and a recent invasion of
western Africa from central regions is also indicated by the
haplotype distribution. The African wild dog is very
mobile and populations over the middle part of its current
eastern through southern range show a mixture of haplotypes. There are 2 shallow but distinct mtDNA clades that
would have diverged perhaps 340 kya, with each coalescing about 70 kya [89]. The cause of this divergence is not
clear, but restriction in habitat by climatic oscillations,
and separate colonization of east and south from western
Africa are possible.
Whilst there are common features within and distinguishing ones between the wet and dry examples reviewed from
the Tropics, there are individualities to each species phylogeography; these reflect differences in biology and history that have produced differences in genetic structure.
The richness and diversity seen at the species level is multiplied by that within species, and more studies are
needed on biotas from such habitats to properly describe
and understand them. Little is known from the species
rich Tropics of SE Asia, or from the plains of S America
and the large areas of Temperate Asia. There are a number
of individual studies on a range of species, but one needs
several representatives from each community to look for
generalities. Given the species diversity in these areas,
such genetic and phylogeographic knowledge is particularly important to inform sensible decisions on management and conservation of these resources.

Lessons for Conservation from Phylogeography
Man is in the unique position to know and predict the
consequences for the environment and its biota of his
innate will to survive and reproduce. Our actions are
greatly modifying both of these, so we face the challenge
of managing this sensibly. But we must also think of these
natural and induced biotic changes in the light of future
major changes in the climate. It is clear that global oscillations, producing great climatic changes, have occurred
and will continue; in particular the increasingly severe
Quaternary ice ages, which are now well researched and
clearly demonstrated. Biotas have changed greatly due to
these, and will do so again. We are currently well into an
interglacial, the Holocene, and there is debate about how
soon it will end and how quick this will be. If the North
Atlantic conveyor is turned off, and Man may assist in this,
colder conditions may return very quickly. On the other
hand, in the shorter term global warming may continue,
and Man may assist this! What should we do about biodiversity, and how does phylogeography inform us for this?
The distribution of biodiversity across the world is largely
measured as species diversity – their numbers, proportions and distinctness. But within a species there are often
several geographic subspecies, and genetic studies have
added greatly to knowledge of subspecific diversity, with
some regions possessing more lineages and older divergence. Mountain ranges in warm Temperate and Tropical
regions are seen to be important because they harbour
much diversity at species, lineage and allelic levels. Phylogeographic studies reveal that this is likely a product of
species surviving through climatic oscillations by tracking
their habitat altitudinally and locally in a varied
topography in regions not so affected by the extremes of
climate change, e.g. [26]. The southern mountains of
Europe, the southern Appalachians and western mountains of USA have clearly been important as refugia and
provided most colonists for the vast north Temperate
regions today. DNA divergence argues that this has happened repeatedly and so will probably happen again. To
date there is little information on the patterns from Asia
or S America, and it is needed. Such regions of Temperate
refugial genetic diversity have accumulated lineages and
alleles through several ice ages and deserve particular
research and conservation.
The mountain regions in the wet Tropics of Africa and
South America are very rich in species; while phylogeographic studies reveal that these contain divergences often
into the Pliocene with subsequent diversification through
the Pleistocene. This retention of older diversity through
millions of years along with younger lineages argues that
they are both generators and reservoirs of divergence and
species [26,80]. Less is known about the Tropical regions
than Temperate ones, but the phylogeographic evidence

Page 12 of 16
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2004, 1:4

does suggest that they can contain greater diversity and
divergence in an area, as for example in the wet forests of
Costa Rica or Queensland [71,90]. One wonders just what
genetic diversity the species in the mountains of China
and SE Asia contain. However, tropical Asia is even less
studied than Africa and Central America, and with the
rapid anthropogenic changes there studies on their
phylogeography is urgent. With such information the
genetic value of particular regions will be clearer, however
their conservation and management involve complex and
difficult political matters.
Besides these more general issues, there are a number of
more particular lessons and questions. For example, it has
recently been noted in several butterflies that the lower
genetic diversity produced by postglacial colonization of
northern Europe is correlated with their recent decline, as
evidenced in national records. Moreover, different
deduced postglacial colonization patterns show the same
correlation of low genetic diversity and population
decline [91]. This suggests that the phylogeography of a
species may be used as a predictor of demographic threat
and loss. Clearly similar evidence from more species and
groups is required to substantiate this.
Another particular example is the genetic diversity created
by the formation of a hybrid zone as two genomes meet
with postglacial colonization, which is multiplied when
several species zones coincide as a suture zone, e.g. [26]. It
has been argued that such regions are important because
of their genetic diversity [92]. They may well allow the
generation of occasional hybrid species [93,94] and possibly reinforcement [95], but except perhaps for climatically
very stable locations in the wet Tropics they are transient,
and will disappear with each major climatic reversal. They
may reform in roughly the same place each cycle, but fossil evidence suggests that this is not necessarily the case
[29]. Furthermore, for most zones the diversity they contain is accumulated in their refugia over several cycles, and
hence these regions have greater long term value.
The demonstration that the extent of divergence among
lineages within and between sister species generally
increases from the High Arctic to the wet Tropics reflects
their evolutionary age. It can be argued that the richer
Tropical biotas are more valuable than the poorer temperate ones, both in terms of their present allelic, lineage and
species diversity, and their long term survival. However,
this overlooks the particular adaptations of Temperate
species and the vast highly productive biotas they produce. The agriculture of the Temperate regions also supports much of the world's population. The consideration
of regional diversity and adaptation raises a number of
related questions. How well coadapted are recently assembled Temperate ecosystems? Are north Temperate and

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/1/1/4

Arctic species particularly selected for colonization by
repeated range change? Are genetically richer genomes
more able to adapt to change? Do putative refugial regions
contain genetic variation that may be useful in agriculture? And there are many more such considerations.

Conclusion
The frequent major climatic oscillations in the last 2 My
caused repeated changes in the ranges of surviving taxa,
with extensive extinction and recolonization in higher latitudes and altitudinal shifts and complex refugia nearer
the tropics. As a result of these past dynamics, the genetic
diversity within species is highly structured spatially, with
a patchwork of genomes divided by often coincident
hybrid zones.
The extent of divergence among lineages within and
between sister species generally increases from the High
Arctic to the wet Tropics and reflects their evolutionary
age. Holarctic animal species show shallow but clear phylogeographic structure from the last or recent glaciations.
Clades of several species are parapatric near major geographic features like rivers and mountains, suggesting they
had similar range changes and refugial areas.
In Temperate regions like Europe and North America
there is much more diversity in the south, where it has
accumulated in refugia over many ice ages, and much less
in the north, where it was lost during postglacial colonization. These northern places have been colonized by
species from different southern refugia, and have had little
time to become closely coadapted. Furthermore, this loss
of diversity in the north is implicated in the present reduction of population abundance in some species. Mammals
from the Dry Tropics of Africa often show major clades in
the west, east and south indicating major refugial areas for
recent divergence through climatic cycles in the Late
Pleistocene.
Mountain ranges in warm Temperate and Tropical regions
would seem to be important for the survival of lineages
through climatic changes, and hence for genome divergence and speciation. Such understanding of the distribution of biodiversity carries serious implications for the
theory and practice of conservation.
