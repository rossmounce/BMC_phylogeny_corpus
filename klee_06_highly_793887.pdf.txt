Abstract
Background: Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium causing Q fever, is an obligate intracellular biosafety
level 3 agent. Detection and quantification of these bacteria with conventional methods is time
consuming and dangerous. During the last years, several PCR based diagnostic assays were
developed to detect C. burnetii DNA in cell cultures and clinical samples. We developed and
evaluated TaqMan-based real-time PCR assays that targeted the singular icd (isocitrate
dehydrogenase) gene and the transposase of the IS1111a element present in multiple copies in the
C. burnetii genome.
Results: To evaluate the precision of the icd and IS1111 real-time PCR assays, we performed
different PCR runs with independent DNA dilutions of the C. burnetii Nine Mile RSA493 strain. The
results showed very low variability, indicating efficient reproducibility of both assays. Using probit
analysis, we determined that the minimal number of genome equivalents per reaction that could be
detected with a 95% probability was 10 for the icd marker and 6.5 for the IS marker. Plasmid
standards with cloned icd and IS1111 fragments were used to establish standard curves which were
linear over a range from 10 to 107 starting plasmid copy numbers. We were able to quantify cell
numbers of a diluted, heat-inactivated Coxiella isolate with a detection limit of 17 C. burnetii particles
per reaction. Real-time PCR targeting both markers was performed with DNA of 75 different C.
burnetii isolates originating from all over the world. Using this approach, the number of IS1111
elements in the genome of the Nine Mile strain was determined to be 23, close to 20, the number
revealed by genome sequencing. In other isolates, the number of IS1111 elements varied widely
(between seven and 110) and seemed to be very high in some isolates.
Conclusion: We validated TaqMan-based real-time PCR assays targeting the icd and IS1111
markers of C. burnetii. The assays were shown to be specific, highly sensitive and efficiently
reproducible. Cell numbers in dilutions of a C. burnetii isolate were reliably quantified. PCR
quantification suggested a high variability of the number of IS1111 elements in different C. burnetii
isolates, which may be useful for further phylogenetic studies.

Background
Coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of Q fever, a zoonosis that occurs worldwide and infects a variety of different
animals, including domestic mammals like cattle and
sheep. Whereas animals in general show no clinical signs
of infection except occasional abortions, C. burnetii can
cause serious illness in humans, where infections usually
occur via aerosols. Acute disease often presents as a selflimiting influenza-like illness with fever and headaches,
but severe cases with atypical pneumonia or hepatitis may
occur. The disease can become chronic with life-threatening endocarditis as the most frequent clinical manifestation that requires long lasting antibiotic treatment [1].
Although an obligate intracellular organsim, the bacterium is very resistant to environmental conditions due to
extracellular spore-like forms, and even a single organism
can produce disease. Because of its widespread availability, environmental stability and low infective dose, C. burnetii is considered a potential bioterrorist agent and is
classified as a group B agent by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, USA [2].

evaluated with relatively small numbers of characterized
isolates or with uncharacterized clinical samples, though
it should be noted that most importance was attached on
sensitivity of the assay, whereas the suitability of the
assays for a great panel of different isolates was less relevant.
The icd gene for the isocitrate dehydrogenase was
sequenced in 19 strains and shown to be conserved [20].
We used a fragment of this gene as target for real-time TaqMan PCR based on TaqMan chemistry. In addition, we
performed a real-time PCR assay based on a fragment of
the transposase gene of the IS element IS1111a. Both
assays were validated for specificity and sensitivity, and
suitability of the icd assay for the quantification of Coxiella
cell numbers was shown. As the exact number of IS elements is only known for the sequenced genome of the
Nine Mile strain, we examined the number of IS1111 elements per genome, or per icd copy, respectively, in a large
panel of Coxiella isolates of worldwide origin.

Results and discussion
C. burnetii is a slow growing bacterium that can be cultivated in embryonated eggs or eukaryotic cell culture,
which is time consuming and must be performed in
biosafety level 3 laboratories. Antigen detection of bacteria by capture ELISA or direct immunofluorescence is difficult and has relatively high detection limits. Therefore,
diagnosis is still mainly based on serological methods like
indirect immunofluorescence, complement fixation or
ELISA, with the disadvantage of delayed diagnosis because
specific antibodies appear only one to two weeks after
infection [3].
During the last years, several PCR based diagnostic assays
were developed to detect C. burnetii DNA in cell cultures
and clinical samples. These assays used conventional PCR
[4-8], nested PCR [9-12] or real-time PCR conditions with
LightCycler [13-15], SYBR Green [16] or TaqMan chemistry [17]. The target sequences of the assays originated from
singular chromosomal genes like com1 or htpB, on plasmids (QpH1, QpRS) or on the transposase gene of insertion element IS1111 [18] that is present in 20 copies in the
genome of the C. burnetii Nine Mile RSA493 strain [19].
Due to the multicopy number of the IS1111 element, the
corresponding PCR is very sensitive. However, quantification of cells cannot be performed based on PCR of the IS
element, because the numbers of IS1111 elements present
in different Coxiella isolates are not known.
The prerequisite for a diagnostic PCR is a target sequence
that is specific for C. burnetii to exclude false positive
results with other organisms and that is conserved and
present in all C. burnetii isolates to prevent false negative
reactions. The PCR assays mentioned before were usually

Evaluation of the specificity of the real-time PCR assays
To determine whether false positive reactions occurred in
real-time PCR assays with the icd and IS1111 markers,
PCR was performed with DNA of the bacterial species
listed in the Methods section. Based on the sequence of its
16S rRNA, C. burnetii is classified into the order Legionellales, with Legionella spp. and Francisella spp. as nearest
phylogenetic neighbours [1]. Both for these related species and for all other species tested, the PCR was negative,
confirming the specificity of both targets.
Determination of precision and detection limit of the
assays
Based on the measured DNA concentration (29 ng/µl)
and the length of the published sequence of the C. burnetii
Nine Mile genome (1,995,275 bp), the theoretical
number of genome equivalents (GE) was calculated to be
1.3 × 107 GE per µl. This corresponds to 2.6 × 108 IS1111
elements per µl for the Nine Mile strain (20 per genome).
To determine the precision of the icd and IS real-time PCR
assays, Ct (threshold cycle) values for eight replicates of
tenfold dilutions of purified C. burnetii Nine Mile
genomic DNA were measured (Table 2). The results represent independent dilution series and different PCR runs.
The mean Ct values, standard deviation, and percent CV
(coefficient of variation) were calculated for each dilution.
The results showed low variability, with CVs ranging from
1.3 to 1.9 % for the icd target and 1.1 to 1.6 % for the IS
target, indicating efficient reproducibility of both assays.
Standard curves drawn from the copy numbers and mean
Ct values shown in Table 2 had slopes of -3.687 for the icd
curve and -3.527 for the IS curve (data not shown), indicating PCR efficiencies of approximately 90 % for both

the slope of the standard curve).
Determination of the detection limit by probit analysis
was performed with DNA of the C. burnetii Nine Mile
strain. For the singular icd marker, detection of 100 to
0.75 GE/reaction was tested by PCR. For the IS1111
marker, where 20 copies are expected per genome, lower
concentrations from 25 to 0.2 GE/reaction, or 500 to 4
copies of the IS1111 element, respectively, were tested.
Each PCR was repeated three times with eight replicates
for each concentration. The minimal number of genome
equivalents per reaction that could be detected with a 95
% probability by real-time PCR was 10 when the icd
marker was used (Fig. 1). With the IS1111 marker, 6.5
genome equivalents per reaction were detected with 95 %
probability (Fig. 1), corresponding to 130 copies of the
target gene. Detection of lower IS1111 copy numbers was
possible, as mentioned below for plasmid standards, but
less reproducible. PCR products of the icd and IS1111
assays were analysed on agarose gels and showed the
expected single bands of 76 bp and 295 bp, respectively.

Quantification using plasmid standard curves
Tenfold serial dilutions of plasmids with cloned icd and
IS1111 fragments were used to establish standard curves
for each PCR run. For both markers, the quantification
was linear over a range of 10 to 107 starting plasmid copy
numbers, and the detection limit was ten copies per reaction (data not shown).

To assess whether the number of icd and IS1111 copies per
genome could be sufficiently calculated by using standard
curves derived from plasmid standards, PCR assays for
both targets were performed with tenfold serial dilutions
of C. burnetii Nine Mile DNA and plasmid standards. The
results are shown in Table 3. Especially for lower DNA
concentrations, the theoretical numbers of icd and IS1111
copies (calculated from genome size and DNA concentration as shown before) corresponded quite well to the
respective copy numbers determined experimentally.
Determination of Coxiella cell numbers by real-time PCR
The cell numbers of purified Coxiella isolates can be determined by Gimenez stain. To assess whether the cell densities quanitified by real-time PCR were comparable, we

performed PCR reactions of heat inactivated isolates targeting the icd marker without previous DNA extraction.
An exponential dilution series was made from heat inactivated particles of the Nine Mile isolate containing 4.2 ×
109 particles per ml, and 1 µl of each dilution was applied
per PCR reaction. Cell numbers were quantified using
standard curves derived from diluted plasmid standards.
The results are shown in Table 4. Given that only one copy
of the chromosome is present per bacterial cell, which can
be expected for a slow growing bacterium like Coxiella, the
number of genome equivalents based on icd quantification should be comparable to the number of bacteria.
Indeed, the icd quantity correlated well with the numbers
of coxiellae determined microscopically. The detection
limit for real-time PCR was 17 particles per reaction,
which is in good agreement with the detection limit for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/2

purified Coxiella DNA and far below the particle number
that can be quantified microscopically.
Determination of the number of IS elements in 75 different
Coxiella isolates
Although the measured icd and IS1111 copy numbers
shown in Table 3 exceeded the calculated numbers in
some cases, the number of IS1111 elements per genome
(i.e., per icd copy) varied between 13 and 17 for different
DNA concentrations, which is close to the published
number of 20 IS1111 elements for the Nine Mile isolate.
Therefore, with this assay, DNA samples of 75 isolates of
C. burnetii from all over the world were assessed for presence of the icd and IS markers and the numbers of IS1111
elements per genome were calculated. Quantification of
icd and IS markers was based on standard curves obtained
from diluted plasmids. Each DNA sample was tested in
duplicate in three independent PCR runs targeting both
markers except for DNA from the Nine Mile isolate, where
six runs were performed.

In a recent study where Q fever patients were examined 12
years after infection, the IS1111 element could not be
amplified, whereas PCR for other targets was positive
[21]. Our results indicated that all isolates contained both
the icd and the IS1111 markers. Different PCR runs
resulted in discrepancies of the measured quantities and
accordingly, different values and standard deviations for
the number of IS1111 elements per genome equivalent
were obtained (data not shown). For the Nine Mile
RSA493 strain the number of IS elements was determined
to be 23 (± 3.43), which is in good agreement with the
number revealed by sequencing. The mean number of
IS1111 elements per genome varied between seven (isolate J 3) and 110 (isolate Z2534), and between 10 and 30
for the majority of isolates. In French isolates of the
related restriction groups 12 to 16 (Table 1), however, the
number of IS1111 elements was found to be above 30,
being highest in strain "Raphael" (around 95). All isolates
of restriction group I had numbers below 30 insertion elements, so that for these isolates a correlation of the
number of IS1111 elements with the restriction group
seems likely. In other restriction groups, however, the
number of IS1111 elements was highly variable. Although
the standard deviations were very high for some values,
our data suggest that the number of IS1111 elements can
vary widely between different C. burnetii isolates and
some isolates seem to contain a very high number of
IS1111 elements. To further confirm our real-time PCR
based quantification, Southern blot analyses should be
performed.
Insertion sequences play a major role in determining
band pattern differences between isolates produced by
methods such as PFGE (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis)

in many bacterial species [22]. C. burnetii expresses a low
degree of genetic heterogeneity among strains by DNADNA hybridization. However, Not I restriction of total
DNA followed by PFGE resulted in the characterization of
20 restriction groups among 80 C. burnetii isolates collected worldwide, as indicated in Table 1[1,23,24]. Typing
C. burnetii based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the locations of the IS1111 element, like published for the insertion sequence IS100 of Yersinia pestis
[25], may add to the elucidation of the phylogenetic relationship of Coxiella isolates. Moreover, the insertion sites
of IS1111 could be examined by inverse PCR or by a
recently described technique, the so called vectorette PCR
[26].
So far, our data are too incomplete for judgements on
clinical outcome, namely, to find any correlation between
the number of IS1111 elements and the virulence of an
isolate. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that an
increased number of IS elements in the genome of an isolate could have a deteriorating effect on its fitness, because
essential genes might be interrupted by the insertion
sequences.

Conclusion
We validated TaqMan-based real-time PCR assays targeting the singular icd gene and the transposase of the
IS1111a element present in multiple copies in the genome
of C. burnetii. The assays were evaluated with a variety of
other bacterial species and shown to be specific for C. burnetii. Dilution series of C. burnetii DNA and of plasmids
with cloned icd and IS1111 inserts demonstrated the sensitivity of the assays. Less than 10 genome equivalents per
reaction were reproducibly detected. Using the icd marker,
cell numbers of C. burnetii isolates were quantified also at
very low cell concentrations. As a first approximation, the
combination of both assays was useful to assess the numbers of IS1111 elements in 75 C. burnetii isolates from all
over the world. Our data indicate that the numbers of this
insertion element in the different isolates seem to be
highly variable. The differences in the content of IS1111
elements might be of importance for further phylogentic
analyses of C. burnetii isolates.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
The C. burnetii isolates used in this study are shown in
Table 1. C. burnetii bacteria were grown in Buffalo green
monkey cell cultures and isolated as described [7]. To
determine bacterial concentrations, a defined volume of a
diluted suspension was fixed on a slide and stained by the
Gimenez method. Bacteria were counted and the concentration of the suspension was calculated.

The following DNA samples from other bacterial species
were used as negative controls for PCR: Legionella pneumophila (ATCC 33152, JR32 and 130b), Francisella tularensis ssp. novicida (ATCC 15482) and ssp. tularensis (Schu4),

All sequences are given in 5'-3' orientation. Primers and
probes were designed using the Primer Express software
(Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and purchased from TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany).
Preparation of plasmid standards
The target sequences were amplified by conventional PCR
using DNA from C. burnetii Nine Mile RSA493 strain as
template and with the same primers as for real-time PCR
in the case of the IS1111 marker and with primers icd418F (5'-TATGTTTGCCTTAGGCCCGT) and icd-818R (5'AAGGGCTTTGCTCCAAATTC) in the case of the icd
marker, for which a 401 bp long amplicon was obtained.
Plasmid standards with cloned (TOPO TA Cloning System, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and sequenced
inserts were generated by GenExpress (Berlin, Germany).
Plasmid preparations were quantified spectrophotometrically, and plasmid copy numbers were calculated. Dilutions of the plasmids were used in real-time PCR reactions
to prepare standard curves for quantification of the initial
copy numbers.
PCR assay conditions
Real-time PCR reaction mix consisted of 6.25 µl of Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) containing dNUTPs, MgCl2, reaction buffer and
AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, 300 nM of each primer
and 100 nM of fluorescence-labeled TaqMan probe. For
most assays, water was added to a final volume of 24 µl,
and 1 µl of purified template DNA or heat inactivated C.
burnetii isolate was used as template. For determination of
the IS1111 copy numbers in the 75 C. burnetii isolates,
water was added to a final volume of 15 µl, and 10 µl of
10-fold dilutions of the DNA were used as templates to
minimise pipetting errors. All real-time PCR reactions
were performed in duplicate in a 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as follows: 2 min at
50°C, 10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles at 15 s 95°C and 30 s at
60°C. Data were analyzed with the corresponding software.
Probit analysis
The number of C. burnetii Nine Mile genome equivalents
(GE) with a genome size of 1,995,275 bp in a DNA preparation with a concentration of 29 ng/µl was calculated to
be 1.3 × 107 GE/µl. To determine the number of GE that
can be detected with a probability of 95 %, eight replicates
of serial DNA dilutions from 100 GE/reaction to 0.75 GE/
reaction for icd or 25 GE/reaction to 0.2 GE/reaction for

IS1111 were tested in independent PCR reactions performed by different persons. The reaction volume was 1
µl. Each PCR gave a positive or negative result at the concentration tested. The detection probability was obtained
by plotting the proportion of positive PCRs observed
against the genome equivalents. Statistical analysis was
performed using the SAS version 9.1 software.
