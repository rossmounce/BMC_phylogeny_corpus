Abstract
Background: Chaetognaths, or arrow worms, are small marine, bilaterally symmetrical
metazoans. The objective of this study was to analyse ribosomal protein (RP) coding sequences
from a published collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a chaetognath (Spadella
cephaloptera) and to use them in phylogenetic studies.
Results: This analysis has allowed us to determine the complete primary structures of 23 out of
32 RPs from the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) and 32 out of 47 RPs from the large ribosomal
subunit (LSU). Ten proteins are partially determined and 14 proteins are missing. Phylogenetic
analyses of concatenated RPs from six animals (chaetognath, echinoderm, mammalian, insect,
mollusc and sponge) and one fungal taxa do not resolve the chaetognath phylogenetic position,
although each mega-sequence comprises approximately 5,000 amino acid residues. This is probably
due to the extremely biased base composition and to the high evolutionary rates in chaetognaths.
However, the analysis of chaetognath RP genes revealed three unique features in the animal
Kingdom. First, whereas generally in animals one RP appeared to have a single type of mRNA, two
or more genes are generally transcribed for one RP type in chaetognath. Second, cDNAs with
complete 5'-ends encoding a given protein sequence can be divided in two sub-groups according
to a short region in their 5'-ends: two novel and highly conserved elements have been identified
(5'-TAATTGAGTAGTTT-3' and 5'-TATTAAGTACTAC-3') which could correspond to different
transcription factor binding sites on paralog RP genes. And, third, the overall number of deduced
paralogous RPs is very high compared to those published for other animals.
Conclusion: These results suggest that in chaetognaths the deleterious effects of the presence of
paralogous RPs, such as apoptosis or cancer are avoided, and also that in each protein family, some
of the members could have tissue-specific and extra-ribosomal functions. These results are
congruent with the hypotheses of an allopolyploid origin of this phylum and of a ribosome
heterogeneity.

Background
Chaetognaths are a small marine phylum, only comprising about 120 species; they live in various habitats, but
most of them are planktonic [1]. They play a key role in
marine food webs and are considered to be the second
phylum, after copepods in terms of plankton biomass [2].
Thus, they can be considered as a successful phylum.
Moreover, Casanova et al. [3], based on more than 20
years of research on the phylum, consider chaetognaths as
a model animal. One of us (JPC) described about a quarter of the known species and reported many original
observations, such as the progressive stages of acquisition
of one pair of appendages on the posterior half of the tail
by modifying a part of their balancing fins [4]. He also
reported astonishing variations of the secondary muscle,
one of the locomotory muscles [5], exhibiting two forms;
one is unique in the animal Kingdom (alternation of two
sarcomere types) and the other, found only in more or less
benthic species, functions by supercontraction.
The phylogenetic position of chaetognaths is always
debated. As soon as 1844, Darwin [6] wrote they are
"remarkable for the obscurity of their affinities." Since then,
they have been related to most of the phyla. Nevertheless,
for a long time, they were commonly said to be deuterostomes [7,8]. On the basis of anatomical observations on a
new "archaic" deep living species he described, Casanova
[9] pointed out affinities with molluscs (protostomes).
This was an impulsion for new researches. Since a few
years, numerous molecular analysis as well as embryological data rejected the relationships with deuterostomes
and placed the chaetognath ancestor either at the base of
the coelomate Metazoa, just before the splitting protostomes/deuterostomes, or near the protostomes and even
as part as protostomes [10-22]. Classical phylogenetic
molecular markers such as nuclear rRNA sequences, but
also other molecular markers used more recently did not
convincingly help to define the Chaetognatha affinities,
due to the long branch attraction (LBA) artefact. Mitochondrial investigations using, independent, gene
sequences for Paraspadella gotoi Casanova, 1990 [16] or
Spadella cephaloptera Busch, 1851 [15] have both shown
close relationships with the protostomes, whereas phylogenetic analyses of these two complete chaetognath mitochondrial genomes in combination have placed
chaetognaths either within the Lophotrochozoa or as sister to this clade [21]. Comparisons of mitochondrial gene
arrangements also suggested phylogenetic relationships
between chaetognaths and Lophotrochozoa [19]. Moreover, recent studies using analyses of expressed sequence
tags (EST) encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) from
Spadella cephaloptera and (mainly RPs from) Flaccisagitta
enflata Grassi, 1881 respectively, positioned chaetognaths
among protostomes, likely as a sister-group of all other
protostome phyla [20] and supported a lophotrochozoan

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/146

relationship [21]. Fossil evidence suggests that chaetognaths were widespread and diverse in the earliest Cambrian and the difficulties of the phylogenetic position of
this phylum is probably partly due to its divergence at an
early stage from the primitive ancestor of the Bilateria
[22].
The study of molecular evolution requires a battery of
genes that are optimally informative at overlapping taxonomic levels [23,24]; for this reason EST analyses and
principally RP datasets are particularly useful [20,21].
Ribosomes are the ribonucleoprotein particles responsible for peptide synthesis in all living organisms. As being
present in the last universal common ancestor, their basic
structural and functional features have been preserved in
all diverse descendants. So, the macromolecular components of the ribosome have been useful for evolutionary
studies. During translation, the eukaryotic cytosolic ribosome is composed of two subunits: small ribosomal subunit (SSU) and large ribosomal subunit (LSU) consisting of
four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules and over 70 associated RPs. The number of cytosolic RPs is around 79 in
Eukaryotes and varies very slightly within this clade
[25,26]. Moreover, it is widely recognized that in animals
a single gene encodes each RP, although most if not all of
the RP genes have a number of processed pseudogenes
located elsewhere in the genome [27,28]. Contrarily, multiple (often more than two) functional genes encoding
each RP are found in plants [29], and in the baker yeast
cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the 78RPs are encoded by
137 genes and 59 of the genes are duplicated [26]. Interestingly, most of the plants are polyploids [30] and the
baker yeast has arisen from ancient whole-genome duplication [31]; it has been suggested that the two divergent
classes of both 18S and 28S rRNA genes found in all the
extant chaetognaths [32,33] could have arisen from an
allopolyploid event (genome combination after species
hybridization) [34] which allow us to hypothesize possible presence of RP paralogs in this taxon and ribosome
heterogeneity. Moreover, if numerous RP paralog genes
are found in chaetognath EST database, this may have
consequences for phylogenetic analyses as the use of one
form or the other may affect phylogenetic results.
The aim of this study was to analyse RP coding sequences
from sequences from a publicly available collection of
ESTs from a chaetognath (S. cephaloptera) [20] making
them available for phylogenetic analysis in bilaterians. As
part of our chaetognath genome research concerning
genome structure, organization and evolution, here we
report 55 complete sequences of cytosolic RPs and data
concerning the expression and evolutionary analysis of
the corresponding mRNAs.

Results
Analysis of the various ribosomal protein multigene
families
On the 2396 clones representing putative transcripts
encoding proteins, 452 clones (18.9%) were identified as
representatives of small cytosolic RPs and 511 clones
(21.4%) as representatives of large cytosolic RPs. The
nomenclature of RPs in different organisms is quite confusing because of many synonyms for the same gene in
different organisms; to avoid further confusion, we have
followed the nomenclature of the rat [35]. For instance,
the SA RP was also known as the 40 kDa RP; RP S3a was
also termed v-Fos transformation effector; and S27a and
S30 were derived from ubiquitin fusion proteins. The
genes were annotated using identity comparisons with the
rat RP gene sequences. Bioinformatic analysis of the chaetognath RP cDNAs (DNA complementary to RNA)
sequences revealed the candidate clones for 28 SSU RP
genes and for 37 LSU RP genes, with respectively between
1 to 45 clones and between 1 to 42 clones for each of the
RP gene family (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Eukaryotic RP genes appear to belong to multigene families. However, contrarily to fungi or plants, in animals,
only one gene from each family is usually transcriptionally active; almost all the remainders of the genes are inactive pseudogenes [27,28]. Surprisingly, in the chaetognath
EST database, at least half of the RPs appeared to have
two, or sometimes more, types of mRNA (isoforms in Figure 1). Within a gene family, the percentage of identity of
the various members at the nucleotide level varies from 61
to 88 % (data not shown). In addition, one type of mRNA
is almost always overrepresented compared to the
other(s). In approximately half of the cases, for a RP gene
family (for example S15), several mRNAs are found in this
EST database, these mRNAs can be divided in two or more
types and each type encodes the same isoform (in this case
: S15 isoform 1 for S15 mRNAs of the type 1 and S15 isoform 2 for S15 mRNAs of the type 2); moreover, generally,
within each type, the mRNA sequences can be divided in
two subtypes, which differ principally by a short sequence
in their 5'-ends ("TTT" and "TAC" sites in Figures 1 and 2).
Indeed, in the clones containing a putative entire mRNA
leader sequence, most of them bear the region 5'-TAATTGAGTAGTTT-3' (named TTT) or a region highly homologous (74.5% and 74.8 % of the clones for, respectively,
SSU and LSU RP genes) while the others bear the region
5'-TATTAAGTACTAC-3' (named TAC) or a region highly
homologous (25.5% and 25.2% of the clones for respectively, SSU and LSU RP genes) (Table 2). According to us,
these two regions, which have 10 nucleotides after the
potential transcriptional initiation base, could contain
binding site(s) for transcription factor(s). Indeed, in some
genes, DNA binding site(s) have been identified in the
downstream region of the transcriptional start site

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/146

[36,37]. In addition, it is well known that most RP genes
have common promoters and are therefore assumed to
have a unified gene expression control mechanism [38].
For these two reasons, we have scrutinized the 5'-ends of
the RP mRNAs for potential transcription factor binding
sites using two prediction programs (ConSite,
TFSEARCH). Although no strict consensus sequence can
be identified, the bioinformatic analyses reveal an interesting feature, i.e., the 5' part of the regions described
above could constitute a binding site for a member of the
Tinman-Nkx2.5-Csx homeodomain factor family [39]
(Figure 2). Interestingly, one of the putative binding site
(TAC) is more similar to the consensus binding site than
the other (TTT) and increasing evidence indicates that
individual Nkx factors are critical regulators of whole
organ development [40], suggesting a putative role of
these regions in development. On another hand, the 3'
parts of TTT and TAC regions exhibit great nucleotidic differences after the putative Tinman site (i.e, TT and AC
respectively), suggesting that these sequences could also
bind some specific protein factors, but our bioinformatic
analyses do not allow to identify putative candidates.
Moreover, in only one case, mRNA subtypes [mRNA
sequences which differ principally by the 5' untranslated
region (5'UTR)] belonging to the same type do not encode
exactly the same amino acid sequence; L39 isoform-3 differs from the L39 isoform-1 by only one amino acid, but
however, only one EST encoding the isoform-3 has been
found (Figure 1 and Table 3).
Spadella cephaloptera ribosomal proteins from the small
(SSU) and large (LSU) subunits
SSU of eukaryotic ribosomes contain generally 32 proteins [27]. We have identified ESTs encoding complete
open reading frames (ORFs) for 23 on 32 SSU RPs in the
chaetognath database. Unfortunately, sequences of S2, S3,
S3a and S6 proteins are incomplete; due to frameshifts,
the sequence of SA protein can not be obtained and no
ESTs encoding for S5, S10, S27a and S30-ubiquitin-like
proteins have been found.

Generally 47 different proteins, including 2 short
polypeptides, are present in LSU of eukaryotic ribosomes,
but in some taxa this number can reach 50. We have identified ESTs encoding complete ORFs for 32 on 47 LSU proteins in chaetognath EST database. Four sequence proteins
are incomplete (L2/L8, L3, L5, L10e/P0); due to
frameshifts, the sequence of L6 protein cannot be
obtained and ESTs encoding for P0-like, P2, L4(L1), L7a,
L12, L13a, L19, L23a, L24-like and L41 proteins are missing. For the L41 mRNA, it is probably due to its short
length, since the polypeptide is only 25 amino acids long
in rat. Numerous characteristics of S. cephaloptera RPs are
given in Table 1: number of amino acids, calculated
molecular weight (Mr) and calculated isoelectric point

Alignment of the two consensus 5'-ends of the S. cephaloptera ribosomal protein genes
Figure 2
Alignment of the two consensus 5'-ends of the S. cephaloptera ribosomal protein genes. The 28 nucleotides region
named n°2 has been found in 249 ESTs putatively encoding for 28 different SSU RPs, and in 319 ESTs putatively encoding for 37
different LSU RPs. The 28 nucleotides region of the sequence n°1 has been found in 75 ESTs putatively encoding for 25 different SSU RPs and in 96 ESTs putatively encoding for 29 different LSU RPs. The stars (*) indicate nucleotides which are conserved between these two sequences. The nucleotide regions which differ between these two sequences have been underlined
and have named respectively TAC consensus site and TTT consensus site. The nucleotides which are conserved between
these two consensus sites and Tinman/Nkx2.5 binding consensus sites are indicated in bold letters; K representing T or G.
(pI).Comparative analysis of the isoforms of ribosomal
proteins
Interestingly, generally in the chaetognath EST database,
when two or more types of mRNA putatively encode a RP,
their deduced amino acid sequences differ (Figure 1 and
Table 3). In addition, in approximately half of the cases,
the number of deduced amino acids between two isoforms belonging to the same RP family is different (third
column in Table 3). Moreover, no alternatively spliced
transcripts have been identified. On the other hand, these
isoforms are probably not due to cloning, PCR and/or
sequencing artefacts, because, generally for a RP type,
numerous cDNA sequences are strictly similar and when
nucleotide differences are found, the integrity of the ORF
and of the TTT or TAC regions are generally conserved; in
more than half of the cases, within a same RP family, for
each proteic member, the number of corresponding
mRNA types is higher than three. In addition, for 9 RP
families, the isoforms shared less than 90% identity at the
amino acid level (column 5 in Table 3). Indeed, for all the
RP families, the biologically significant sites were predicted in the deduced amino acid sequences using the
program PROSITE. Interestingly, according to these criteria, most of the isoforms exhibit one or more differences
suggesting various putative physiological roles (column 5
in Table 3).
PCR evidence of paralogous genes
As the EST library has been constructed using several individuals [20], inter-individual variations could not be
excluded. Using specific PCR primers of all the members
of 4 RP gene families, we have evidenced that most of the
paralogous genes could be isolated even from single individual DNA preparations (Table 4). Similarly, PCR using
primers in the putative transcription factor binding sites

show that both classes of genes are present in the chaetognath genome. Some PCR amplifications gave negative
results; these concern, except for S8 isoform 3, cases where
no EST has been found in the S. cephaloptera library. On
the other hand, numerous paralogous genes for which no
ESTs have been obtained in S. cephaloptera library are
present in the chaetognath genome; this principally concerns the genes bearing the putative TAC transcription
binding sites which were probably under-expressed in the
juvenile chaetognaths used for the library construction.
Phylogenetic trees of ribosomal proteins
Phylogenetic trees from the multiple alignments of 7
amino acid mega-sequences constructed using the MP,
ML, NJ and Fitch methods are in Figure 3a, b, c. All four
methods applied on the seven taxa datasets differ only by
the position of protostomian and chaetognath sequences
which are never strongly supported, but all topologies
show chaetognaths belonging to protostomes, however,
this is not statistically supported (the best bootstrap value,
76 %, is for the Fitch analyses). The monophyly of Bilateria is well supported in all the analyses (bootstrap values
> 91%). The monophyly of Deuterostomia is always
recovered with bootstrap values > 68%.

More advanced ML analyses were investigated on a nucleotide dataset from 6 taxa, and the best model selected by
MrAIC, on first and second codon positions, is in Figure
3d. In these analyses where the sponge was the outgroup,
we consistently found a clade joining the chaetognath and
Drosophila (Arthropoda), generally with very high bootstrap values (from 83 to 100%), embedded within a larger
clade including the mollusc sequences, and we also generally found a deuterostomian clade joining the rat and the
echinoderm. The changes observed among the distinct
codon position partitions only slightly affected bootstrap

values, not topology. The use of codon models also
yielded the same topology, as well as the use of the non
stationary model allowing G+C contents to vary among
lineages. Relative rate tests with respect to the sponge outgroup revealed that the chaetognath and the mollusc had
very significantly distinct evolutionary rates, suggesting
that the union of the fast-evolving Drosophila and the
fast-evolving chaetognaths may be an LBA artefact (see
Figure 3d). Base composition also appears biased and susceptible to artefactually join the chaetognath and the Drosophila sequences which are the most G-C rich, with G+C
levels for second and third codon positions, of 79.1% –
58.3% for Drosophila, 71.3 % – 54.9% for the chaetognath, 68.7% – 54.1% for the echinoderm, 55.2% – 47.8%
for the mollusc, 60.9% – 51% for the rat, and 47.5% –
46.3% for the sponge. The best model of evolution

selected by MrAIC and used for subsequent ML analyses
was the most parameter rich and general one, GTR-IGGeneral Time Reversible model with some invariant sites,
and variation of evolutionary rates among sites. The selection of such a parameter rich model is not surprising given
the high number of sites. The input of a user tree, where
we placed the chaetognath at the base of a protostomian
clade did not result in a different topology or branch support than when a starting tree is inferred via BIONJ (for
PhyML analyses).
For bayesian analyses on amino-acid sequences, the phylogenies inferred with the GTR and CAT models differ in
the placement of the chaetognath, and in the estimated
posterior supports of clades (Figure 3e, f). Under GTR, the
chaetognath and the sponge sequences cluster together

Phylogenetic trees of the selected ribosomal proteins sequences (see Table 2 and Methods). The trees A, B and C
were obtained using respectively Neighbor Joining (NJ), Fitch, Maximum Parsimony (MP), and Maximum Likehood (ML) methods on an amino acid dataset. The trees constructed using Fitch and MP methods have a similar topology. In D, the ML tree
using the first two codon positions and the model selected by MrAIC, GTRIG, ML estimated base frequency, a gamma (2) distribution for site substitution rates, and an estimated proportion of invariant sites. Similar topologies were obtained with ML
using codon models and with a non homogeneous non stationary ML method allowing G+C equilibrium frequency to vary (see
text). Trees E and F were obtained using respectively the GTR model with a MCMC bayesian method and the CAT mixture

with a strong support (Figure 3e, but posterior bayesian
probabilities are often strong), whereas under CAT, it clusters with Protostomia (Figure 3f). In spite of displaying
low support for clades, the CAT topology is identical to
that previously found by Marletaz et al. [20], using more
species and focusing on the chaetognath phylogeny. Both
models obtained the deuterostomian monophyly by
grouping together rat and echinoderm but with a low posterior support in CAT analyses (46%).

Discussion
Generally, in EST databases, multiple sequences encoding
the same RP have been found, because RPs are well
expressed and their mRNAs are abundant and over-represented in the cDNA library. In addition, random sequencing of cDNAs on a large scale always results in high

number of sequences encoding RPs [41]. As expected, in
the S. cephaloptera EST database, in spite of the relatively
low number of clones which represent transcripts encoding proteins (only 2396), we were able to deduce complete amino acid sequences of 55 RPs, probably because
a) in this cDNA library, inserts with a size greater than 800
bp have been selected, b) although only the 5'-ends of the
clones from this library has been sequenced, the generally
short length of the RP mRNAs allow to obtain complete
sequences, c) 40.3% of the clones encoding proteins are
RP mRNAs, and d) most of the RP genes (61%) were
indeed found on EST clusters composed of 4 or more
sequences. The two extreme examples are S9 and L44/
L36a proteins, which were respectively encoded on 45 and
42 ESTs (Table 2). However, we have found only 1 EST for
SA, S2, S3a and L2/L8, and if the ORF contains

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:146

frameshift(s) and/or if it is partial, it becomes impossible
to obtain the complete protein sequence. In addition,
ESTs encoding for 14 RPs are missing. It is not surprising
for two of these proteins, P0-like which is missing in rat
and L24-like which is probably not associated with ribosome; for the others, it is probably due to a bias in the EST
database. The reason for the huge disproportion in numbers of ESTs encoding the different RPs in S. cephaloptera
database could also be just the consequence events such as
mRNAs stability/instability, differences in efficiencies of
mRNAs copying and insertions of cDNAs in the Lambdaphage.
Eukaryotic RP genes appear to belong to multigene families [27,28]; however, great differences have been found
between the different Kingdoms. In the yeast cell, where
approximately half of the RP genes are duplicated [26], in
all cases, both gene copies are transcribed although their
expression levels often differ considerably [42]; moreover,
the proteins encoded by duplicated genes have identical
or virtually identical sequences and are functionally indistinguishable. In plants, multiple functional RP isoforms
could be produced [43]. In contrast, generally, in animals
only a single gene encodes each RP, the other members of
each gene family are pseudogenes [27]. Consequently,
analyses of animal EST databases reveal that RP appeared
to have only one type of mRNA; the exceptions are rare,
for example, in the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)
EST analysis has revealed, except for three protein types,
that each other RP type is encoded by only one type of
mRNA [44,45]. Surprisingly, analysis of S. cephaloptera
EST database reveals a more complicated pattern; almost
each isoform could be encoded by two mRNA subtypes
which only differ by a short region in their 5'-end
sequences; moreover, in approximately half of the RP
gene families, deduced isoforms have been found and the
generally relatively high number of clones suggest that the
corresponding mRNAs are probably translated and the
proteins functional. These two events complicate the comprehension of the molecular evolutionary history of chaetognaths. Moreover, PCR experiments have evidenced
that at least for 4 ribosomal gene families, the various
genes variations are intraindividual variations (Table 4).
Within a mRNA type, generally, the sequences could be
divided in two subtypes (named TTT and TAC) which differ by a short region in the 5'-UTR. These regions could
correspond to two different transcription factor binding
sites. In S. cephaloptera, as each of the many entire RP
cDNAs has only one of the putative binding sites, this
means that the two subtypes could have differential transcription patterns, whereas in other taxa, this feature is
restricted to a low number of RP genes. As differences in
promoters generally correspond to diverse RP gene expression control in specific tissues [38], our results suggest

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/146

that one of the putative promoter site (probably TTT,
which yields more mRNA) plays certainly a role during
housekeeping conditions, whereas the other site (TAC,
which yields less mRNA) would allow an expression of
RPs when a very large quantity of RPs would be essential
in specific tissues and/or in the most crucial development
stages. In addition, almost all the RP genes contain one of
the two putative binding sites. Two other elements are in
favour of this hypothesis; one is that two subtypes for a
given gene family encode identical proteins except in one
case; the second element is that bioinformatic prediction
suggests that one of the 5'-end region could constitute a
binding site for members of an homeobox factor family
members which are tissue-specific transcription factors
and are critical regulators of whole organ development
[40].
The analysis of the chaetognath EST database has also
revealed a relatively great number of RP paralogs. If some
of them, with a low number of ESTs, could be artefacts,
the others, with a higher number of ESTs (Table 3), could
have a physiological significance. Indeed, the identical or
similar sizes of the paralogous members of each protein
families added to cDNA analyses evidenced that these isoforms are not due to expression of differentially spliced
mRNAs. Moreover, bioinformatical analyses suggest that
most of the isoforms exhibit differences in their biologically significant sites (column 5 in Table 3). RP isoforms
have been found in other animal taxa. However, the numbers of paralogs is lower; for example, in the channel catfish, if exclude alternative spliced transcripts which
concern only the S3 family, paralogs have been found for
only two types of RPs (S26 and S27) and one paralog pair
has a high percentage of amino acid similarity with 94.8%
identity, whereas the other paralog pair only differs by
one amino acid [44,45]. In human, two RP genes on the
sex chromosomes, one on the Y and one on the X, are
both widely transcribed in human tissues and encode two
isoforms of S4 RP which differ at 19 of the 263 amino
acids [46]. In addition, two genes encoding different L39
proteins have also been evidenced in human [47]. In rat,
two functional genes are reported for S27; multiple transcripts encode each isoform and exhibit different tissue
expression patterns [48]. Moreover, in sponge (Suberites
domuncula), no RP isoforms have been evidenced [41]. To
our knowledge, except chaetognaths, the presence of
numerous RP isoforms has only been evidenced in plants
([43] and references therein). For example, due to the
extensive segmental duplication of the Arabidopsis
genome, all its RP genes have between two and several
paralogs; and assessing RP gene expression by the presence of an EST showed that at least 77% of RP genes (not
including the 21 genes with incomplete ORFs) are
expressed at a level detectable by an EST [49].

The roles of multiple functional RP isoforms in plants
remain unclear although it has been proposed that expression of multiple RP genes from a single family may be necessary to accommodate high – or specific – translational
needs in growing plant tissue; thus, RP genes copies under
development regulation may be required in addition to
those gene copies that are constitutively expressed
[29,49]. For example, Arabidopsis RP gene L16 is present as
two copies in the genome, with one isoform expressed in
proliferating tissues and the other expressed in more specific tissues [50]; similarly, differential transcriptional regulation of the two RP L23A genes has also been reported
[51]. Moreover, differential expression of homeologous
(genes duplicated by polyploidy) 18S-5.8S-26S rRNA
genes has been shown in plant allopolyploids [52] and
expression of multiple genes in a RP gene family may be
indicative of ribosome heterogeneity [53]. Surprisingly,
chaetognaths exhibit numerous molecular analogies with
plants; two classes of paralogs of 18S-28S rRNA have been
reported [32,33], which could be the result of an allopolyploid event in the ancestor of all the extant chaetognaths
[34]. Moreover, in S. cephaloptera, one of the 18S class
plays a ubiquitous role whereas the other is specific to
oocytes [54]. The great number of RP paralogs in this species could be the result of the allopolyploidy and we
hypothesize that two populations of ribosome could exist
in chaetognath cells; one of them contains the housekeeping rRNA (Class I) and the isoforms for which numerous
mRNA have been found in the EST database and which
give relatively short branches in phylogenetic reconstructions (data not shown); the other contains the class II
rRNAs with the other isoforms. Moreover, a preliminary
observation suggests that, in chaetognaths, the positive or
negative selection of RP families which contain paralogs
has probably some functional reasons. Indeed, in
Escherichia coli, it has been evidenced that most RP genes
are crucial for ribosome assembly or functionality, such as
proteins implicated in the early assembling proteins (S4,
S7, S8, S15, S17, L2, L3, L4, L5, L15, L18), the bridges
between two subunits (S13, S15, S19, L2, L5, L14), contact with tRNA (S7, S9, S12, S13, L1, L5), and the surrounding polypeptide exit channel (L22, L24, L29) [55].
It is interesting to compare this list of proteins to those
given for the chaetognath putative isoforms (Table 3);
only S7, S8, S15, S17, L15 and L22 are present in the two
lists (i.e., have isoforms and fit the above functions). In
addition, for S7, L15 and L22, a paralog is encoded by
only a unique clone (EST = 1 in Table 3), suggesting possible sequencing artefacts, and the two S15 paralogous
proteins have 100 % of similarity. Therefore, we hypothesize that paralogs for "crucial RPs" could be strongly unfavourable. If RP paralogs which exhibit various non
ribosomal functions were to interact with the ribosome,
this could induce an inactivation of the translation mech-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/146

anism. Contrarily, if this event occurs with other non crucial RPs, it could be selectively neutral.
Alternatively, expression of multiple gene family members may also be indicative of multiple functions for RPs
from any given gene family, with some members having
ribosomal functions and other extraribosomal roles. It is
well known that many RPs perform additional extraribosomal functions in cells. In mammalian, where the
number of RP paralogs is very low, RPs also exhibit various secondary functions in DNA repair, apoptosis, drug
resistance and proliferation. They are involved in different
cellular processes, from replication and regulation of cell
growth to apoptosis and malignant transformation
[56,57]; and consequently the expression of their genes
could vary considerably [58,59]. In addition, zebrafish
carrying heterozygous mutations in a number of RPs are
predisposed to cancer [60]. According to us, probably
when two or more paralogous RPs exhibit several differences in their primary sequences, one of the paralog plays
its "conventional role" as component of ribosome, while
the other(s) perform(s) extra-ribosomal functions. Moreover, it has been proposed that gnathostomes had undergone two events of polyploidization leading to octaploidy
[61] and in this clade, in each RP gene family, generally a
single gene is functional, suggesting that in each RP gene
family, all the paralogs but one are subject to strong counter-selection; this is not the case in chaetognaths, putatively allopolyploids, which could have overcome the
deleterious effects of paralog RPs. Interestingly, in S.
cephaloptera, in more half of the RP paralog families, the
percentage of identity between the members of each family is less than 93% (Table 3); this could correspond to a
subfunctionalization, after ploidy, the homoeolog copies
specialize to perform complementary functions [62,63]. A
great number of RP paralogs generate another problem;
indeed, the ribosome is an intricate ribonucleoprotein
complex with a multitude of protein constituents present
in equimolar amounts. Coordination of the synthesis of
these RPs presents a major challenge to the cell and is a
result of the sum total of all regulatory mechanisms, i.e.,
transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational, posttranslational, on each RP gene. The presence of multiple
(often more than two) functional genes encoding each RP
substantially make more complex coordinated expression
[29]. Chaetognaths, which seem to date unique among
animals in carrying multiple paralogous RP functional
genes, contradict the current knowledge regarding coordinated systems of RP gene expression in animals. This is
probably another prove of the uniqueness of this phylum
among animals, as already focused at the anatomical and
histological levels. In the future, comparison of chaetognaths versus other animals RP genes regulation will provide fruitful data.

In spite the use of several methods, the phylogenetic relationship of chaetognath is not resolved by the present
study. Two biases appear likely to affect our reconstructions, the LBA artefact, and the composition artefact, evidenced by contrasting G+C levels on least constrained
third codon positions. Such artefacts may lead to wrong
clades with strong branch support and we suspect this is
the case for the chaetognath and Drosophila "clade".
However, for the second type of bias, the ML non stationary analyses which allow G+C content to vary, still groups
the chaetognath with Drosophila, which are long branch
species. Furthermore, the second codon position and
amino-acid datasets should be much less susceptible to
the composition bias but yield the same group. The fact
that the non homogeneous amino-acid model CAT,
shown to be the most robust method against LBA [64],
although at the cost of lower posterior support values
[65], yielded a topology that did not join chaetognath and
Drosophila suggests that LBA are more important biases
than composition artefacts to infer chaetognath phylogenetic relationships. This analysis, which does not group
"long branch" species with similar base compositions
(chaetognath and Drosophila), is also in agreement with
previous works such as Marletaz et al. [20], although the
posterior supports are very low, as expected with this
method [65]. Therefore, the LBA artefact seems to affect
our phylogenetic reconstruction more than the base composition bias, since the methods which are supposed to
"correct" for GC-content variation among lineages do not
change the topology obtained with more standard methods, while the method supposed to correct for LBA does
change it.
Marletaz et al. [20] building a dataset of S. cephaloptera RP
genes concatenated for 17 taxa, recovered the deuterostomian clade with high bootstrap support, whereas the chaetognaths clustered strongly with protostomes (bootstrap
98%) and their position as a sister group to all other protostomes was supported by weak bootstrap values (51%).
As we analysed the paralogy for all the RP gene families
and used, after preliminary phylogenetic analyses, only
the paralogs with the shorter branches, we hoped to
obtain similar topology but with strongly supported
nodes, this is not case probably illustrating that the
number of taxa plays a significant role and is of major
importance when LBA artefacts are into play. Our thorough phylogenetic analyses, using non homogeneous and
non stationary models as well as the CAT mixture model
for the first time on that data set, helped to identify and
correct specific sources of artefactual branch attraction.
We can now predict that improvements to infer phylogenetic relationship of the chaetognath phylum will rely on
using the PhyloBayes program with the CAT model on a
wider taxonomic dataset than the one we used in the
present study, such as that of Marletaz et al. [20]. Moreo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/146

ver, versus this last study, we also had the advantages of
choosing only the most conserved RP paralogs (by discarding the divergent ones), however, in spite of these various improvements, present results confirm the difficulty
of finding the exact phylogenetic relationships of chaetognaths.

Conclusion
The analysis of chaetognath RP genes has revealed several
interesting and original features. However, it has been
impossible to relate the presence of two subtypes of
mRNA which differ by their 5' UTR region and the great
number of paralogs in a coherent molecular evolution
pattern. In the future, footprinting and band shift assays
will be carried out to investigate the factor(s) which could
bind on the 5' UTR region of the RP genes. In addition,
using in situ hybridization, putative differential tissue
expression of paralogous mRNA will be investigated. As
our study has shown that the genome of one individual
could contain several functional paralogous genes, this
suggests that in this taxon, some unknown mechanisms
could avoid the deleterious effects of the presence of paralogous ribosomal proteins such as apoptosis or cancer.
Probably each paralogous protein has specific functions,
one of the paralogs play its role in the ribosome, while the
other could have specific extra-ribosomal functions in
cells; however, a ribosome heterogeneity where each
ribosome is constituted by a class of rRNA associated with
a class of RP paralogs could not be excluded, and even the
two mechanisms could co-existed.

Methods
Spadella cephaloptera database of expressed sequence
tags
For this study, we have analysed a collection of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) from the chaetognath S. cephaloptera,
a collection previously assembled by Marletaz et al. [20].
Briefly, cDNA library was made from mRNAs isolated
from various embryonic stages of this chaetognath species
(from 0 to 48 hours after hatching) using the Lambda-triplex 2 vector. The 5'-ends of 11,254 clones from this
library have been sequenced and after annotation analyses, the homology relations have been assigned to 2396
clones corresponding to the transcripts of 792 different
genes. Annotated sequences have been submitted by Marletaz et al. [20] on the EMBL website and available online
under the accession numbers CR940385 to CR954140.
Transcription factor binding sites
Potential transcription factor binding sites within the
leader mRNA sequences were identified using two prediction programs. The option allowing analysis of orthologous pairs of sequences within ConSite [66] was used to
scrutinize numerous aligned chaetognath regions which
are homologous in their 5'-ends. All transcription factor

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:146

binding sites indicated were confirmed against the databases held in ConSite and TFSEARCH [67].
SSU and LSU ribosomal proteins
Amino acid sequences of RP from rat (Rattus norvegicus),
fly (Drosophila melanogaster), sponge (Suberites domuncula)
and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were extracted from
corresponding databases. Concerning mammalian, RPs
from rat and human are highly conserved and are nearly
identical; however, rat, instead of human RPs, were used
for comparison, because rat has been the mammalian
model organism for the study of RPs for the last 30 years
(for review [35]) and human RP sequences are mostly by
products of the human genome project. In addition, to
date, the complete set of RPs is unknown for any species
of molluscs and echinoderms; however, multiple
sequences for most RPs belonging to various species are
known and we have used RPs from molluscs (mostly two
bivalve species: Crassostrea gigas and Argopecten irradians)
and echinoderms (mostly Strongylocentrotus purpuratus)
that showed highest percentage of aa identity with their
homologues from rat. Thus, a total of 38 types of homologous proteins have been obtained, although some of
them are partial. EMBL accession numbers of all the complete chaetognath RPs and of the other taxa are in separate
tables (Table 1) and [see Additional file 1] respectively.
Concatenation of ribosomal protein sequences
Sequences of RPs from 6 metazoan species and/or taxa, as
well as yeast RPs, were concatenated into 7 respective
mega-sequences in the same relative order of proteins.
From S. cephaloptera, R. norvegicus, echinoderms, molluscs, D. melanogaster, S. domuncula and S. cerevisiae,
respectively, 1/the mega-sequences of RPs consisted of
5923, 7175, 6012, 5802, 7291, 6962 and 6748 amino
acids; 2/the RPs mega-sequences from SSU comprise
3348, 3534, 3528, 3298, 3515, 3519 and 3419 residues,
and the LSU are 2575, 3641, 2484, 2504, 3776, 3443 and
3329 amino acid long.
Sequence analysis
TBLASTN (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) was used
to identify single ESTs or EST clusters encoding homologues of rat RPs in S. cephaloptera database. ESTs encoding RPs were translated and analyzed using Translate and
ProtParam tools at ExPASy proteomics server [68]. Chaetognath RPs were further analyzed by NCBI CD search of
Conserved Domain Database (CDD) with Reverse Position Specific BLAST. Searches for the occurrence of patterns, profiles and motifs in RPs were performed by
Prosite at ExPASy [70]. Multiple alignments of individual
RPs or mega-sequences of SSU, LSU and all RPs were
obtained using a multiple sequence alignment editor
BioEdit version 7 [69]. Statistical data were extracted from
GeneDoc [71].

DNA extraction and amplification of ribosomal genes
Adult specimens of the benthic species S. cephaloptera have
been caught during spring and summer 2006 in a marine
meadows east of Marseilles (Brusc lagoon, France). In the
laboratory, samples were kept in aquaria containing natural sea water and placed in a constant temperature at 21 ±
1°C where they were maintained under natural light
cycle. DNAs from 3 adult individuals have been extracted
separately using CTAB method [72]. Then, ribosomal paralogous genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers (Table 4). The 25 µl PCR
reaction mix contained 100 ng template DNA, 2.5 µl Taq
DNA polymerase buffer 10×, 1 µl dNTP mix (50 µM), 1 µl
of each primer (20 µM), and 1U Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega). Samples were amplified during 30 cycles
under the following regime: 94°C for 1 min, 45 to 61°C
for 30 sec (according the couple of primers), and 72°C for
30 sec. The forward primer sequences for genes bearing
the putative TTT and TAC sites are respectively TTT: 5'GGAAGCTTATAATTGAGTAGTTT-3' and TAC: 5'GGAAGCTTATTATTAAGTACTAC-3'. The sequences of the
reverse primers were: S8-1R: 5'-CCGCTTCGCTCAATTTGGCGC-3', S8-2R: 5'-CGGCTTCGCTCAATTTAGAAC-3',
S8-3R: 5'-CGGCTTCACTCAGTTTGGTTG-3', S25-1R: 5'CGGCATCTTCAAATTCCGAAACG-3',
S25-2R:
5'CTCAAGCTTGGACGAGTAAG-3', S25-3R: 5'-CGCCGGCCGCCTTGGGTGGC-3', L15-1R: 5'-CCCATAGTGATAATCCTGACC-3',
L15-2R:
5'ACACGGGTGAAGCCCCCC-3', L27a-1R: 5'-GCTGTCCTTTCGACATCTTTAC-3', L27a-2R: 5'-GGGCTTCAACTTGGACATG-3'.
Phylogenetic analyses
In each S. cephaloptera RP family, in order to to minimize
the artifact of LBA, when several paralogs have been
found, only the sequences giving the shortest branch in
phylogenetic analyses were chosen; these paralogs which
have been named isoform 1 are also the closest to the animal consensus sequences.

Firstly, using seven taxa dataset, RP DNA sequences were
translated into amino acid sequences to overcome the
problem of GC content differences [73]. Phylogenetic
trees based on amino acid sequences were constructed by
four methods, all from the Phylip package: Prodist [using
two distance methods: Fitch and Neighbor-joining (NJ)],
Protpars [maximum parsimony (MP)], Proml [maximum
likelihood (ML)] [74]; all parameters were set to default
values. Bootstrap analysis on 1000 replicates was performed with Seqboot from the same software package.
This dataset contained 5412 amino acids, with a limited
number of missing data. For tree construction, positions
with gaps in one or more sequences were excluded.

In a second approach, we restricted the analysis to animals, to limit the biases generated by too divergent outgroups, and eliminating all the sites containing missing
data. The addition of more divergent outgroups to a given
dataset already containing an outgroup is known to
decrease the reliability of phylogenetic reconstruction,
rather than increasing it. This is due to a phenomenon
analogous to the LBA artefact. Therefore, since the outgroup status of sponges is not dubious (and confirmed by
our 7 species dataset analyses) it is better not to use the
yeast in more refined analyses. This resulted in a 4638
amino-acid dataset for 6 species with sponges as the outgroup. This dataset was analysed by a range of methods
including the most recent ones; they are presented below,
with their relative advantages and susceptibility to artefacts, and either using the amino-acid or the nucleotide
sequence data, and in the last case, either using codon
models, or nucleotide models with different partitions of
codon positions. From that combination of analyses we
will identify which are the most important artefacts and
which are the solutions.
We first used a homogeneous stationary Maximum likelihood method implemented by PhyML [75]. On the
amino-acid data set, we used the WAG empirical model of
evolution, estimating the proportion of invariant sites by
maximising the likelihood, and assuming a gamma shape
distribution of rates of substitution among sites with a
value of 2 for the gamma parameter. The corresponding
13914 nucleotide sequence alignments were also analysed with PhyML. We used several codon position partitions (first and second positions, second position only,
and all three positions) for most types of analyses. MrAIC
[76] was used to determine the best model of nucleotide
evolution using Akaike criteria. The best model selected
was then used to obtain a consensus tree from 100 bootstraps of PhyML analyses, and we computed approximate
likelihood ratio test branch supports for this model using
aLRT-PhyML [77]. PhyML uses a starting tree to explore
the space of possible trees: we used both the BIONJ starting tree option (in which the starting tree is inferred by
BIONJ) and a "user defined starting tree", where the chaetognath was at the base of a protostome clade, to possibly
avoid a bias of LBA at this step since BIONJ is sensible to
LBA (see results and discussion). ML trees were also reconstructed assuming codon models of substitution, which
combine the information at the amino-acid level (non
synonymous changes, less saturation) and nucleotide
level (compositional biases, codon preference) using the
HyPHY package [78].
Non ML methods were also used on these data sets using
MEGA version 3.1 [79], parsimony, and Neighbour Joining with the LogDet distance, in an attempt to overcome
the problem of mutual attraction of the branches which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/146

have the same compositional bias. In effect, even the most
rich parameter models of classical available ML methods
are stationary and homogeneous (i.e., they assume that
the same matrix of substitution applies to all branches of
the tree and all sites, therefore compositional biases may
lead to wrong topology with high bootstrap and high
aLRT branch support). Using MEGA, we computed the
base composition of each taxon, and performed relative
tests of evolutionary rate among taxa, allowing to identify
taxa susceptible to be artefactually joined because of similar nucleotide composition or evolutionary rates (long
branch attraction).
A non stationary ML method allowing to to relax the
assumption of identical substitution processes among
branches was used: This method takes into account variable G+C levels [80] and was implemented using the program nhPhyml [81] with three starting trees
corresponding to the three possible topologies obtained
within the Protostoma + chaetognath group, assuming
Deuterostoma (rat and echinoderm sequences) form a
distinct clade, considering the second position of the
codons only, or the first and second positions.
Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of the amino acid dataset
were performed using softwares MrBayes version 3.1.1
[82] and PhyloBayes version 2.1 [65]. We used the GTR
(General Time Reversible) model of MrBayes, chains were
run for 1,000,000 cycle long, saving a sample each 100
cycles. A burnin period of 2,000 samples was discarded
and the remaining 8,000 samples were used for the consensus topology computation. We moreover used the
mixture model CAT implemented in PhyloBayes, which
allows a mixture of processes of substitution to be distributed across sites and does not make the assumption of the
same amino-acid substitution process across sites. This
model has been shown to be very efficient against LBA
artefacts [65]. Chains were run for a default length of 1100
cycles, each cycle yielding a sufficiently decorrelated sample. The first 100 samples were discarded as burnin and
the consensus topology was extract from the 1000 remaining samples. Both experiments, under GTR and CAT, used
four discrete categories of rates across sites and were run
twice in order to check chains' convergence.
