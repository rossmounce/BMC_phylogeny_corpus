Abstract
Background: Extreme acidic environments are characterized by their high metal content and lack of nutrients
(oligotrophy). Macroscopic biofilms and filaments usually grow on the water-air interface or under the stream attached
to solid substrates (streamers). In the Río Tinto (Spain), brown filaments develop under the water stream where the
Gram-negative iron-oxidizing bacteria Leptospirillum spp. (L. ferrooxidans and L. ferriphilum) and Acidithiobacillus
ferrooxidans are abundant. These microorganisms play a critical role in bioleaching processes for industrial (biominery)
and environmental applications (acid mine drainage, bioremediation). The aim of this study was to investigate the
physiological differences between the free living (planktonic) and the sessile (biofilm associated) lifestyles of
Leptospirillum spp. as part of its natural extremely acidophilic community.
Results: Total RNA extracted from environmental samples was used to determine the composition of the metabolically
active members of the microbial community and then to compare the biofilm and planktonic environmental
transcriptomes by hybridizing to a genomic microarray of L. ferrooxidans. Genes up-regulated in the filamentous
biofilm are involved in cellular functions related to biofilm formation and maintenance, such as: motility and quorum
sensing (mqsR, cheAY, fliA, motAB), synthesis of cell wall structures (lnt, murA, murB), specific proteases (clpX/clpP), stress
response chaperons (clpB, clpC, grpE-dnaKJ, groESL), etc. Additionally, genes involved in mixed acid fermentation (poxB,
ackA) were up-regulated in the biofilm. This result, together with the presence of small organic acids like acetate and
formate (1.36 mM and 0.06 mM respectively) in the acidic (pH 1.8) water stream, suggests that either L. ferrooxidans or
other member of the microbial community are producing acetate in the acidophilic biofilm under microaerophilic
conditions.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the acidophilic filaments are dynamic structures in which different mechanisms
for biofilm formation/dispersion are operating. Specific transcriptomic fingerprints can be inferred for both planktonic
and sessile cells, having the former a more active TCA cycle, while the mixed acid fermentation process dominate in the
latter. The excretion of acetate may play a relevant ecological role as a source of electron donor for heterotrophic Fe3+
reducers like some Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacterium spp. and Sulfobacillus spp., also present in the biofilm.
Additionally, acetate may have a negative effect on bioleaching by inhibiting the growth of chemolithotrophic
bacteria.

Background
The prokaryotic diversity of the extremely acidic waters
of the Río Tinto (southwestern Spain) has been studied
for many years and is well characterized [1-4]. Among the
most abundant microorganisms are the Gram-negative
iron oxidizing bacteria Leptospirillum ferrooxidans and
Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, both accounting for more
than 70% of the prokaryotic population in the water column [2]. These bacteria have special relevance for the
biomining industry because they are used to extract metals through the bioleaching of sulfide ores, and may produce acidification of mine drainages [5,6]. In addition,
due to their very limited nutrient requirements and their
association with iron and sulfur minerals, they are good
models for the study of the origin, evolution and adaptation of life on Earth and elsewhere, particularly Mars [710]. The acidophile prokaryotic communities play a critical ecological role because they are responsible for maintaining the low pH and, as a consequence, other
physicochemical conditions of the ecosystem, like the elevated heavy metal concentration. They are also critical
for the existence of fully operative iron and sulfur cycles
in the Río Tinto ecosystem [10].
We previously reported the environmental transcriptomic fingerprint of L. ferrooxidans in its natural planktonic microbial community under high iron and sulfur
content (20 and 80 g L-1 respectively), as well as high oxidative stress [11]. The cell density in the water column is
relatively low (104-106 cells mL-1), however, there are several types of macroscopic filaments (floating and submerged, streamers) in the river or attached to solid
substrates forming true biofilms with similar prokaryotic
diversity as that found in the water column [3].
Many bacterial species live predominantly in biofilms
in both natural and artificial environments [12,13]. Biofilms can be defined as matrix-enclosed bacterial populations [12], dynamic structures in which transitions
between the planktonic and biofilm modes of growth
occur as a response to different environmental signals.
Biofilms constitute habitats where microorganisms
exhibit physiological heterogeneity and behavioral characteristics that makes them different of those with a free
living lifestyle [14,15].
It has been reported that ore bioleaching requires the
formation of biofilms as the mode for bacterium-mineral
interaction [16]. Extracellular polymeric substances from
biofilms seem to mediate in the attachment of cells to the
solid substrates (metals, ores, etc.) and the electrochemical reactions operating in biocorrosion and bioleaching
processes [17]. Among the factors affecting the biofilm
formation and maintenance is the so called quorum sensing, by which microorganisms communicate via the
secretion of chemical signaling molecules like acyl homoserine lactone, principally used by Gram-negative bacte-

Page 2 of 14

ria [18]. Up to two different acyl homoserine lactone
production systems have been identified in A. ferrooxidans [19], however very little is known about quorum
sensing in Leptospirillum spp. Metaproteomic [20] and
metagenomic [21] studies in acidic biofilms dominated by
Leptospirillum ferriphilum reported the presence of the
luxRI-like genes, involved in quorum sensing through
acyl homoserine lactone. Due to the important role of
extremely acidophilic biofilms, both in microbial ecology
and in industrial bioleaching, the aim of this work was to
gain insights into the physiological differences between
the planktonic (the free "swimming" cells) and sessile (in
filamentous biofilms) modes of life through the analysis
of the Leptospirillum spp. environmental transcriptomes.

Results
Physicochemical and microbiological characterization of
sampling sites

Biomass was collected from water and filamentous biofilms (Fig. 1). The sampling site was mainly characterized
by a high metal (10 to 20 g/L of Fe and 1.5 to 4.0 g/L of Al)
and salt (>80 g/L of sulfate) content (Table 1). However,
differences in some parameters could be observed
between the two sampling times. In general, the 2005
samples contained higher concentrations of iron, sulfate,
Al, Cu, Mg, Mn or Zn, while they had a lower amount of
K+ and acetate (not detected) than the 2004 ones (Tables
1 and Additional file Table S1). Significant concentrations
of acetate in water were also determined in other campaigns: 3.54 mM in June 2006, or 0.34 mM in July 2008.
We estimated the microbial community composition by
two color simultaneous hybridization of total RNA (from
biofilm and water, the same used for gene expression
studies, see below) to a prokaryotic acidophile microarray
(PAM) already tested and validated with this type of samples [4,22]. The PAM analysis (Fig. 1BC) indicated the
predominance of A. ferrooxidans (Gammaproteobacteria) and Leptospirillum spp. (L. ferrooxidans and L. ferriphilum, from Nitrospira phylum), both in water and in
filaments along the two sampling times. Other groups of
the microbial community with significant representation
were the Firmicutes, some Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria, Acidimicrobium spp., and some eukaryotes (only in
the 2005 biofilm). In addition, the PAM analysis allowed
us to estimate the relative proportion of the RNA of each
strain between the plankton and biofilm (Fig. 1C), which
was considered for normalization purposes (see methods). The composition of the free-living and the sessile
prokaryotic communities was very similar in 2004, while
it showed clear differences in 2005, when some groups
like Firmicutes (specially Sulfobacillus spp.), Alpha and
Betaproteobacteria, and Acidomicrobium predominated
in plankton, while Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum was
only detected in the biofilm.

We assume that other Leptospirillum spp. (L. ferriphilum and ferrodiazotrophum) present in the biofilm (Fig.
1) may be contributing to the microarray hybridization,
as deduced from comparative genome hybridization
(CGH) of L. ferriphilum using the L. ferrooxidans
microarray (Additional file 1 Figure S1). By comparing
the genome sequences of L. ferrooxidans to that of L.
rubarum and L. ferrodiazotrophum (NCBI Project IDs
18795 and 37907 respectively ), we estimated a degree of
sequence identity around 70-75%. This level of sequence
identity has, in fact, allowed us to perform transcriptome
studies of L. ferriphilum using the L. ferrooxidans
microarray [23]. We hybridized at a temperature 5°C
lower than that used for L. ferrooxidans transcriptome
studies and the environmental transcriptome reported
herein. Finally, the possible interference on the transcriptome studies by the other major component of the microbial community, the A. ferrooxidans group, was
considered negligible following the CGH results (Additional file 1 Figure S1).
Comparing the Leptospirillum spp. environmental biofilm
and planktonic transcriptomes

Total amplified RNA from plankton and biofilm was fluorescently labeled (Cy3 for plankton and Cy5 for biofilm),
mixed and set to hybridize with the genomic L. ferrooxidans DNA microarray. The signal intensities and the
quality of the microarrays assayed with the samples collected in 2004 were higher than those of 2005, probably
due to a better quality of the extracted RNA or to a higher
metabolic activity in the 2004 samples (Additional file 1
Figure S2A). As expected, most of the probes on the
microarray showed a Log2 ratio (biofilm/planktonic)
between -1 and +1 in the experiments with samples from
the two campaigns (the microarray data were deposited

on Gene Expression Omnibus-GEO database with No.
GSE20267 [25]). More than 50 probes bearing the L. ferrooxidans 16S rRNA gene showed strong reproducible
signals and Log2 ratios between -0.8 and + 0.8 from the
2004 and 2005 microarrays after normalization. These
consistent results suggested the absence of RNA amplification bias in any of the samples, although we cannot
exclude the possibility of some preference in the amplification of particular genes or regions. We selected 2524
different clone probes (out of 5348 of the whole microarray) having a significant intensity (more than a factor of 3
over the background signal) in at least one of the microarrays for further analysis. Then, up to 173 probes were
selected having a biofilm vs plankton ratio higher than 2
in both campaign experiments, suggesting that the upregulation of these genes was tightly related to the biofilm
architecture and organization processes, rather than to
differences in the environmental conditions (Additional
file 1 Figure S2 B).
In previous works [11,24,26], those spots showing special up or down-regulation were selected and the corresponding clones were sequenced from both ends. We
identified different open reading frames preferentially
expressed in biofilm, others preferentially expressed in
free living cells, and others with high expression levels in
both sites (Additional file 1 Table S2, and summarized in
Fig. 2). Many of them were assigned to already known
genes and some corresponded to hypothetical conserved
proteins of unknown function. As expected, the genes
whose transcription was induced in biofilm corresponded preferentially to several functional categories
related to biofilm formation and maintenance or key
steps of central metabolism: (i) Cell envelope biogenesis
and exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis; (ii) quorum-sens-

acid fermentation (poxB, ackA, acsA). On the other hand,
the functional categories up-regulated in free living cells
were related to: (i) ion transport, like PO4= and K+; (ii)
amino acids (His) and fatty acids biosynthesis; and (iii)
Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes (pta, idh encoding an ICDH-NAD+ -dependent).
Some of the more relevant up-regulated genes were
also checked by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR using total ampli-

fied RNA from biofilm and planktonic cells from the 2004
campaign. The preferential transcription detected by
genome microarray experiments of mqsR, sirA-like, poxB,
acsA, pta, clpX, rpfG-like, ackA and the unknown orf
ygiT-like (downstream of mqsR), was confirmed by RTPCR (Fig. 3). The qRT-PCR results further confirmed the
induction of mqsR (4.1 fold), sirA-like (2.1 fold) and poxB
(7.9 fold) in the biofilm, and porA (3.5 fold) and pta (2
fold) in planktonic cells.
Effect of monosaccharides and small organic acids on the
growth of L. ferrooxidans

The toxic effect of small organic acids (acetate, formate,
etc) and other organic compounds on the growth of acidophile chemolithoautotrophs is well known [27]. The

presence of significant amounts of acetate (up 3.54 mM
on June 2006) in the acidic water of the Río Tinto spring
suggested that Leptospirillum spp. were able either to
grow or at least to tolerate this relatively high concentrations. Additionally, the induction of genes like poxB,
ackA, or acsA also suggested that L. ferrooxidans and/or
other Leptospirillum spp. are capable to produce acetate
by mixed acid fermentation (Fig. 4). Acetate may be produced from the hexoses and pentoses in the biofilm
matrix to render pyruvate via the Embden-MeyerhofParnas pathway and then to produce acetyl phosphate
(acP) and acetate through reactions catalyzed by PoxB
and AckA, as it was described in Lactobacillus plantarum
[28]. To check whether the presence of hexoses and pentoses as well as organic acids were toxic, we cultivated our
L. ferrooxidans strain under different concentrations of
glucose, arabinose, pyruvate and acetate. The results
showed a concentration-dependent growth on glucose

and arabinose (0.1% w/vol allowed growth but not 0. 5%
w/vol), as monitored by following the iron oxidation and
cell counting (Fig. 5). No growth was detected in media
containing pyruvate (0.25 mM) or acetate (1 mM).

Discussion
Transcriptomic fingerprints in extremely acidophilic
biofilms

The analysis of the environmental transcriptomes of the
Leptospirillum spp. in planktonic and biofilm natural
communities resulted in the detection of several genes
preferentially up-regulated in the biofilm. Most of them
are related to functional categories and mechanisms
known to be involved in biofilm formation and maintenance in other bacteria. In addition, genes involved in
mixed acid fermentation were also induced in the biofilm.
Some of these genes and their functional categories are
discussed below and in Additional file.

Genes involved in biofilm production and maintenance

Several small size genes encoding hypothetical proteins
were highly up-regulated in the streamers (Fig. 2 and
Additional file 1 Table S2). A sirA-like gene that may be
part of a two-component regulatory system was induced
in the biofilm. In several species, SirA/BarA orthologues
are required for virulence gene expression, exoenzyme
and antibiotic production, motility, and biofilm formation [29]. A bdlA-like gene is highly expressed both in
biofilm and plankton. This gene is involved in regulating
chemotaxis and biofilm dispersion in Pseudomonas
aeruginosa [30]. The authors proposed a model by which
the BdlA protein acts as a sensor of environmental cues

and controls both biofilm formation and biofilm dispersion/detachment by modulating the enzymatic activity of
c-di-GMP-forming and hydrolyzing GGDEF/EAL diguanylate cyclase containing domains. Similarly, an rpfGrpfC two-component system is being expressed in both
lifestyles, with a slight preference for biofilm. The rpfGC
operon is involved in the positive regulation of the synthesis of extracellular enzymes and polysaccharides [31],
in the regulation of the formation and dispersal of biofilms, and is required for full virulence in Xanthomonas
campestris [32]. Several proteins containing GGDEF or
GGDEF/EAL domains are being expressed (Additional

Figure 4 Transcriptional evidence for metabolic differences between sessile (biofilm) and swimming (planktonic) modes of life. Genes encoding mixed acid fermentation enzymes are up-regulated in the biofilm (bottom part). As a result, two metabolites can be produced: acetyl-phosphate (acP) and acetate. The former can be used as a phospho-donor intermediate, while the later can be transformed to acetyl-CoA or released to
the medium. They could be produced by fermentation of sugars via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway to pyruvate, then to acetyl phosphate
(acP) by pyruvate oxidase (PoxB), and finally to acetate by AckA. In contrast, genes encoding key TCA cycle enzymes are up-regulated in the swimming
(planktonic) cells (top part; see also text for explanations). Circles indicate the name of the enzymes whose genes are being expressed in the Río Tinto
samples (red, preferentially induced in biofilm; green, in planktonic cells; and yellow transcribed in both places). All of them have been identified in the

file 1 Table S2), some of them preferentially in the biofilm,
and others in both lifestyles.
Genes for quorum sensing and motility

We identified a putative mqsR (ygiU)/mqsA (ygiT) -like
operon [33,34] and both genes were highly up-regulated
in the biofilm (Figs. 2, 3 and Additional file 1 Table S2).
The MqsR-like protein shares 60% identity to the E. coli
homologue, while MqsA (YgiT) has 45% identity to that
of E. coli (Swissprot accession number Q46864.1). MqsR
(motility and quorum sensing regulator) is directly associated with biofilm development and is linked to the
development of persister cells [33,34]. In addition, and
relevant for the streamer biofilms, deletion of mqsR leads

to a reduction in biomass, substratum coverage, and
changes the biofilm architecture when cultured in flow
cell devices. MqsR transcriptionally regulates expression
of genes necessary for motility, like fliA or motA. Very
recently, Kim et al. [35] have reported that MqsR and
MqsA (YgiT) are in fact a toxin/antitoxin (TA) pair which
regulates additional loci besides its own. The system may
be additionally regulated through the degradation of
MqsA by ClpX/P and Lon proteases [35]. The genes
encoding these proteases are also up-regulated in the Rio
Tinto biofilm (see Additional file 1 Additional discussion). In our study, the L. ferrooxidans MqsR-like protein
might be the responsible for more than two-fold upregu-

sp. are non-flagellate at 42°C. However, it has not been so
far associated to biofilm formation or maintenance.
Genes encoding key enzymes for the peptidoglycan synthesis are also up-regulated in biofilm, like murB,
involved in the first committed step in the biosynthesis of
the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan [38]. Additionally, a
slt-like gene, encoding a soluble lytic murein transglycosylase for recycling of muropeptides during cell elongation and/or cell division is also up-regulated. Several
putative glycosyl transferases involved in EPS and lipoplysaccharide biosynthesis as well as cell wall biogenesis
are being expressed both in biofilm and planktonic cells
(not shown), some of them with slight preference for biofilm, like an O antigen polymerase and a putative lipoplysaccharide biosynthesis protein, and others with more
than two fold induction in streamer biofilm (not shown).
Genes involved in mixed acid fermentation
Figure 5 L. ferrooxidans cultivated in the presence of glucose, arabinose and acetate. L. ferrooxidans was cultivated in Mckintosh medium with 2% (w/v) iron sulfate (closed diamonds ?), or 2% iron sulfate
supplemented with 0.1% glucose (open circles ᭺), 0.1% arabinose
(closed circles ᭹), or 1 mM acetate (closed triangles Њ), and the growth
monitored by measuring iron oxidation at OD410 nm. All the cultures
were inoculated with 1.9 × 105 cells ml-1. After 48 h, the cell number
clearly increased (dashed lines) with respect to the starting inoculums
(1.9 × 105 cells ml-1).

lation of a chemotaxis and motility operon consisting of
fliA-cheY-cheA-orf-mcp-cheW-motA-motB, where fliA is
a sigma 28-like encoding gene (Fig. 2). A flagellar motor
switch fliM-like gene, located downstream of a methylaccepting chemotaxis gene bdlA (involved in biofilm dispersion) is also induced in biofilm streamers. On the contrary, a putative operon encoding a sigma-54 like factor
followed by flgB-flgC-fliE-fliFG-orf is preferentially
expressed in plankton, which may indicate different
peculiarities in motility between both lifestyles: "swimming motility" in plankton and "swarming motility" in
biofilm. A bioinformatic search of mqsR-like genes in
public Leptospirillum spp. genome sequences (NCBI) was
unsuccessful, so it seems to be only present in our L. ferrooxidans strain.
Genes for the synthesis of cell wall structures

Among the highest up-regulated genes was lnt, encoding
an apolipoprotein N-acyltransferase. This enzyme is
involved in lipoprotein biosynthesis by transferring the
acyl group to the apolipoproteins. Lipoproteins are integral membrane proteins that bind to specific enzymes or
transport proteins across the cell membrane. The Lnt
protein is essential in E. coli, and its depletion causes mislocalization of outer membrane lipoproteins [36]. Lipoproteins are involved in functions like cell wall synthesis,
secretion, or flagellar assembly and motility in Salmonella sp. [37]. Thermosensitive lnt mutants in Salmonella

Some genes involved in mixed acid fermentation showed
up-regulation patterns as determined by microarray
hybridization, RT-PCR and q-RT-PCR analysis (Figs. 2
and 3, Additional file 1 Table S2). This is the case for the
genes poxB, pta and ackA encoding a pyruvate oxidase,
phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase enzymes,
respectively. The pta gene is up-regulated in planktonic
cells, while poxB and ackA are preferentially expressed in
biofilm. These enzymes are critical for the control of the
acetate, acetyl-phosphate (acP) and acetyl-CoA levels
(Fig. 4). Wolfe et al. [39] showed evidence for an important role of acP as a global signal during the first steps of
biofilm formation. The pta and ackA mutants showed
aberrant biofilms and affected the expression of other
genes involved in flagella, pili and fimbriae synthesis,
stress proteins or colanic acid biosynthesis. Very recently,
Gueriri et al. [40] reported that acP is an efficient phosphodonor for the response regulator DegU in Listeria
monocytogenes, and that a double pta-ackA mutant
unable to synthesize acP was strongly affected in chemotaxis, motility and biofilm formation.
The high induction of poxB in the biofilm (both by
microarrays and q-RT-PCR), may be the responsible for
the significant amounts of acetate measured in the water
stream (Table 1). No poxB genes have been identified in
other Leptospirillum genomes sequenced so far. The L.
ferrooxidans PoxB protein (best BLAST e-values: 9e-85
with E. coli PoxB, and 1e-120 to that of Oceanobacter sp.
RED65) is also very similar to other putative PoxB proteins from the Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes
groups, like Lactobacillus plantarum (Additional file 1
Figure S5). The location of poxB and mqsR close to each
other, next to transposase coding genes and at the end of
a contig (Additional file 1 Figure S4), suggests that both
genes may have been acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event from another microorganism.

The oxygen concentration drops drastically in the water
column, so most of the submerged streamers are
microaerophilic. Under these conditions, the primary fermenters (Fungi, Actinobacteria, some Firmicutes) in the
biofilm community can use the structural components of
the biofilm (e.g. polysaccharides, hexoses, etc) to produce
pyruvate via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway.
Then, the same or other bacteria (Firmicutes, Alphaproteobacteria, L. ferrooxidans) may oxidize and phosphorilate pyruvate by PoxB (pyruvate oxidase) to
acetylphosphate (AcP) which, in turn, can be transformed
to acetate by AckA (Fig. 4). A recent work reported the
high hexose content in the extremely acidophilic biofilms
from Río Tinto [41], which indicates that sugars from the
same biofilm can be a primary source of fermentable
material. It is known that acetic acid is toxic to chemolithoautotrophs like A. ferrooxidans [42] and L. ferrooxidans (see Results and below), however it can also be
assimilated, like in A. caldus [43], or consumed by heterotrophic iron reducer microorganisms present in the
community (e. g. Acidobacterium spp., some Alphaproteobacteria, Sulfobacillus spp.). A recent work by Nancucheo and Johnson [44] reported the presence of
glycolic acid as an exudate in actively growing cultures of
three chemolithotrophic acidophiles (L. ferriphilum, A.
ferrooxidans, and A. caldus). The glycolic acid showed
similar toxicity as acetic acid with 21 strains of acidophiles screened (among them L. ferriphilum), while only
members of the Firmicutes group (essentially Sulfobacillus spp.) were capable to metabolize it. Similarly, the acetic acid we detected in the river's water can be consumed
by Sulfobacillus spp. or other Firmicutes (Fig. 6). We did
not detect glycolic acid nor acetic acid production in the
culture media of L. ferrooxidans even when it was cultivated in the presence of 0.1% glucose or arabinose. This
result, together with the environmental transcriptomic
studies shown herein suggest that only sessile L. ferrooxidans cells in the biofilm are capable to produce acetate.
The transcriptomic fingerprint of L. ferrooxidans planktonic
cells

The highest induced gene (more than 20 fold) in planktonic cells was that encoding a NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase that we reported previously [11].
The upregulation of this gene and other TCA genes could
be explained by increased expression of genes involved in
carbon fixation in the planktonic phase using the pyruvate oxido-reductase pathway (POR) and the reductive
TCA cycle, as we suggested previously [11], and also proposed for another Leptospirillum species [45] (see above
and Fig. 4). The next most up-regulated genes in planktonic cells corresponded to ABC transport systems for
potassium (kdpBAC) and phosphate (pstSCAB). The
induction of kdpBAC may be a consequence of the high

Page 9 of 14

salt concentration (more than 70 g/L of SO4=) in the
water, which could be compensated by the accumulation
of intracellular K+ that would play a role as osmoregulator, as in the halophilic bacteria Halomonas elongata [46].
This would imply that biofilm structures are playing a
protective role against salinity that renders unnecessary
the intracellular accumulation of K+ as osmoprotectant.
Alternatively, a lower concentration of intracellular K+ in
biofilm streamers may favor cellular aggregation, as it has
been reported very recently in B. subtilis, where some
natural products that caused potassium leakage triggered
multicellularity [47]. In addition, Ueda and Wood [48]
reported that potassium and sodium transporters regulate cellular adhesion and virulence to barley in P. aeruginosa. In this scenario, the role of K+ as osmoprotectant
may be replaced by the compatible solute trehalose in the
sessile cells, in which the trehalose synthase gene (treS) is
up-regulated more than 6 fold (Additional file Table S2).
The pstSCAB operon, encoding the specific phosphate
ABC transporter, is also preferentially expressed in planktonic cells. In E. coli, transcription of the pst operon is
induced under phosphate starvation and the full-length
mRNA is rapidly processed post-transcriptionally [49].
The high amounts of Fe3+ and Al3+ ions in the Río Tinto
samples may favor phosphate precipitation [50], so that
this nutrient is limited for planktonic cells. In vitro experiments with P. aeruginosa demonstrated that acute phosphate depletion resulted in increased expression of PstS
and biofilm production [51]. Moreover, depletion of
intestinal phosphate after operative injury activates the
virulence of P. aeruginosa, causing lethal gut-derived sepsis. The Río Tinto planktonic cells may be in similar situation: the continuous phosphate deficiency and high levels
of PstS shifts towards a biofilm producing phenotype and,
once the biofilm is well established, the pstSCAB operon
is repressed.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that the main mechanisms governing
biofilm formation and dispersion are operating in natural
extremely acidophilic filamentous biofilms. The identified genes corresponded to others known to be involved
in different stages of biofilm formation in other bacteria
[52]. Therefore, we conclude that the acidophilic biofilm
streamers are dynamic structures in which mechanisms
like quorum sensing, motility and chemotaxis, swarming
and biofilm dispersion/formation are all operating (Fig.
6). Specific transcriptomic fingerprints inferred for both
planktonic and sessile cells showed metabolic differences,
having the former a more active TCA cycle, while the
mixed acid fermentation process dominated in the latter.
The up-regulation of the mixed acid fermentation
genes suggests that the acetate detected in the extremely

Figure 6 Extremely acidophilic streamer filaments are dynamic biofilms and a source of small organic acids. (A) Scheme showing the main
functions related to biofilm formation, dispersion and maintenance that have been detected by environmental transcriptomic studies. In addition,
two different metabolic states can be inferred: 1) under microaerophilic conditions in the biofilm, cells activate the fermentative pathways with a net
production of acetate, and 2) free living cells under aerophilic conditions showed a high active TCA cycle for energetic metabolism. Dashed arrows,
quorum sensing activities; dots, metabolites (acetate, formate, etc.). Long arrows indicate the water stream. (B) Role of acetate in the extremely acidophilic microbial community. The microorganisms identified by PAM (Fig. 1) are located as a function of their key metabolic role. Sugars from the biofilm
(shadowed and hatched area) and other complex organic matter are decomposed by heterotrophs like Fungae and Actinobacteria. Secondary fermenters could render acetate that can be used by iron reducers to produce Fe2+ which, in turn, is the energy source for iron oxidizers. The released
acetate may inhibit the growth of chemolitotrophs like Leptospirillum spp. and Acidithiobacillus spp. (-), while it can be used by Firmicutes, Sulfobacillus
spp., Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria as nutrient.

acidic water of the sampling site (up to 3.54 mM in June
2006) may be a consequence of acetic acid production by
the acidophilic biofilms (Fig. 4). The excreted acetate
could play an ecological role by controlling the growth of
chemolithoautotrophs and as a source of electrons for
heterotrophic Fe3+ reducers like some Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacterium spp. and Sulfobacillus spp., all
detected with the PAM microarray (Fig. 1). The newly
produced Fe2+ could be used as energy source for iron
oxidizers like L. ferrooxidans and A. ferrooxidans, closing
the iron cycle (Fig. 6B).

Methods
Sample collection

Samples used in this study were collected from a permanent spring running under a pile of pyrite-containing
rocks accumulated by mining activities. Sampling was
performed in October 2004 and 2005, after dry summers
and before any autumn rainfall in the area. Biomass from
4 liters of water was recovered by filtration through nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm of pore diameter, Millipore Co.) and filters were immediately placed in 5 ml of
RNAlater solution (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Up to 2 g of filament samples growing in
the same sampling site were collected in 10 ml of RNAlater solution. All samples were frozen on dry ice and kept
at -20°C until use.
Determination of physicochemical parameters in the
sampling sites

The pH, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen and
redox potential were measured in situ with a Multi197i
multiprobe device (WTW GmbH, Weilheim, Germany).
The elemental composition and concentration (Table 1)
was determined by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP), with an Optima 3300 DV instrument (Perkin
Elmer) by the Centro de Espectrometría Atómica, Departamento de Análisis Químico Elemental (UCM, Madrid).
Total iron, Fe3+ and Fe2+ were determined by colorimetric
methods [53]. Sulfate (SO4=) was determined by atomic
absorption spectroscopy with a Perkin-Elmer 3030
instrument by the Centro de Espectrometría Atómica,
Departamento de Análisis Químico Elemental (UCM,
Madrid). Small organic acids (acetate, formate) were
determined by ion chromatography with a Metrohm 861
Advanced Compact Ion Chromatographer IC (Metrohm
AG, Herisau, Switzerland). Appropriate controls were
run to discriminate between acetate and glycolate anions
(not shown).

nose, pyruvate or acetate. The growth was monitored by
iron oxidation and cell counting by using a Newbauer
chamber under an optical microscope as previously
reported [26].
Environmental RNA extraction and amplification

Samples preserved in RNAlater (Ambion) were centrifuged at 10.000 × g for 10 min and washed in acid water
(0.1 M sulfuric acid) for subsequent RNA isolation. Total
environmental RNA was extracted and amplified through
a method based on T7 RNA polymerase linear amplification as described previously [24,11]
Estimation of biodiversity by using a prokaryotic
acidophile microarray

The prokaryotic diversity was determined by a prokaryotic acidophile microarray (PAM) as reported previously
[4] ], and also used to monitor the prokaryotic diversity in
industrial bioleaching [22]. The PAM was developed to
monitor the prokaryotic diversity in extremely acidophilic environments with oligonucleotide probes targeting most known acidophilic microorganisms, including
members of the Alpha, Beta, and Gammaproteobacteria,
the Nitrospira phylum, acidobacteria, sulfur reducing
bacteria, Actinobacteria, the low G+C Firmicutes group,
and Archaea from the Ferroplasma and Thermoplasma
genera. The biodiversity was analyzed using fluorescently-labeled total environmental RNA from the same
samples used for transcriptomic analysis. PAM microarrays hybridizations were carried out at 50°C from 6 to 12
hours as described [4].
Genomic microarrays, environmental RNA labeling and
hybridization

A shotgun genomic DNA library from an environmental
isolate of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans (Strain RT32a,
renamed from the initially L3.2) was printed on a
microarray for transcriptomic analysis [26]. Because the
microarray had 2-3 fold genome coverage, most genes
were redundantly represented by several overlapping
probes (see also Figs. S5 to S7). Up to 2.5 μg of amplified
total environmental RNA (metatranscriptome) from
planktonic cells and from biofilms collected in two different campaigns (October 2004 and October 2005) were
labeled by cDNA synthesis and hybridized with the L. ferrooxidans microarray as described [11]. Since our interest
was to identify genes differentially expressed in planktonic or biofilm cells, we considered both campaigns as
experimental replicates. In addition, technical replicates
were carried out with the 2005 samples.

Strain and culture conditions

Scanning and Data Analysis

Leptospirillum ferrooxidans RT32a, a natural isolate from
Río Tinto was cultivated in Mckintosh medium [54] in
the presence of different concentrations of glucose, arabi-

Hybridized slides were scanned for Cy3 and Cy5 dyes in a
GenePix 4100A Scanner and the images were analyzed
with Genepix pro 6.0 software (Axon Instruments). The

Moreno-Paz et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:404
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/404

microarray hybridization results were analyzed using
AlmaZen system v.2.1 software (Bioalma, Madrid, Spain)
and normalized by applying the locally weighted scatter
plot smoothing (LOWESS) algorithm [55]. Additionally,
data were also normalized by taking into account the relative proportion of the strain used for whole transcriptomic analysis (L. ferrooxidans RT32a, probe LEP439 in
the PAM microarray) between the biofilm and plankton.
This proportion was nearly the same in plankton and biofilm in 2004, while it was twice in the 2005 biofilm when
compared to the water stream (Fig. 1B, C). The criteria
for selecting induced spots were: a signal intensity more
than 3 times the background in at least one of the channels (Cy5 or Cy3), and an a minimal induction ratio of 2
in one of the two campaigns. In some well justified cases,
such as genes that are part of well known pathways,
induction ratio values between 1.5 to 2 were also considered. FASTA software was used to search for similarities
against the non-redundant protein and DNA sequence
databases of the National Center for Biotechnology
(NCBI).
RT-PCR and real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis

The relative abundances of a set of up-regulated genes
were determined in biofilm and planktonic cells by RTPCR and real-time PCR. Specific primers for the genes of
interest were designed (Additional file 1 Table S3) for
amplifying products of 80 to 110 bp, having GC content
and Tm of about 50% and 55°C, respectively. RNA samples were treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion) at 37°C for
30 min before applying RT-PCR protocols. Equal
amounts of environmental DNase I-treated RNA samples
were used to synthesize cDNA with Superscript II
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies) at
42°C for 50 min. The reactions were treated for 15 min at
70°C to inactivate the enzyme. To remove RNA complementary to the cDNA, 2 units of RNase H (Invitrogen
Life Technologies) were added and incubated at 37°C for
20 min before RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR experiments were
performed. RT-PCR for several genes was performed at
54°C (annealing temperature) and the amplicon products
analyzed on agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.
The qRT-PCR quantifications were performed on the
cDNA obtained using 25 μl volumes in 96 well PCR plate
format. The reactions were carried out with iQ™ SYBR®
Green Supermix according to the manufacturer's instructions with 0.4 μM primer concentration. Termocycling
was conducted using a MyiQ™ Single-Colour Real-Time
PCR Detection System (BioRad Laboratories). Cycling
parameters were initially 5 min at 95°C followed by 40
cycles of 94°C 30 s, 60°C 30 s and 72°C 30 s. Each run was
completed with a melting curve analysis to confirm the
specificity of amplification and lack of primer dimers.
Amplification plot and predicted threshold cycle (Ct) val-

ues were obtained with the IQ5 optical system v. 2.0. Software (BioRad Laboratories). The experiments were
performed using triplicate dilution series for each gene
and cDNA preparations (biofilm and planktonic cells) by
the comparative threshold cycle method. PCR efficiencies
were calculated using the standard curve method [56].
Fold-change and SD values were calculated by efficiencycorrected ΔCt method using the 16S rRNA gene as reference.
DNA Sequencing and Analysis

Sequencing reactions were performed from plasmid
minipreps extracted by the automated pipetting system
epMotion 5075 VAC (Eppendorf ). Sequencing was made
using dye terminator cycle sequencing reactions and run
in an ABI Prism 3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequences were analyzed and assembled using SeqMan
(DNASTAR package software, LASERGENE Madison,
WI) and Phred-Phrap-Consed [57]. Annotations were
generated by an automatic pipeline that used Glimmer
3.03 [58] to predict genes and a combination of BLAST
searches against the NCBI and Swissprot non redundant
protein databases to identify putative functions. In addition, sequences were also analyzed by using RPSBLAST
(NCBI) to assign the predicted gene products to protein
families according to the schemes of the COG, PFAM,
SMART and PRK databases. We have now sequenced the
whole microarray clone library and we have generated an
annotated genome sequence draft from L. ferrooxidans
(to be published elsewhere). By mapping the clones onto
the genome draft we can easily identify gene annotations
associated with each probe on the microarray (Additional
file 1 Figure S3).
