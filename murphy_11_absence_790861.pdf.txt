Absence of a serum melatonin rhythm under
acutely extended darkness in the horse
Barbara A Murphy1*, Ann-Marie Martin1, Penney Furney1 and Jeffrey A Elliott2

Abstract
Background: In contrast to studies showing gradual adaptation of melatonin (MT) rhythms to an advanced
photoperiod in humans and rodents, we previously demonstrated that equine MT rhythms complete a 6-h light/
dark (LD) phase advance on the first post-shift day. This suggested the possibility that melatonin secretion in the
horse may be more strongly light-driven as opposed to endogenously rhythmic and light entrained. The present
study investigates whether equine melatonin is endogenously rhythmic in extended darkness (DD).
Methods: Six healthy, young mares were maintained in a lightproof barn under an LD cycle that mimicked the
ambient natural photoperiod outside. Blood samples were collected at 2-h intervals for 48 consecutive h: 24-h in
LD, followed by 24-h in extended dark (DD). Serum was harvested and stored at -20°C until melatonin and cortisol
were measured by commercial RIA kits.
Results: Two-way repeated measures ANOVA (n = 6/time point) revealed a significant circadian time (CT) x
lighting condition interaction (p < .0001) for melatonin with levels non-rhythmic and consistently high during DD
(CT 0-24). In contrast, cortisol displayed significant clock-time variation throughout LD and DD (p = .0009) with no
CT x light treatment interaction (p = .4018). Cosinor analysis confirmed a significant 24-h temporal variation for
melatonin in LD (p = .0002) that was absent in DD (p = .51), while there was an apparent circadian component in
cortisol, which approached significance in LD (p = .076), and was highly significant in DD (p = .0059).
Conclusions: The present finding of no 24 h oscillation in melatonin in DD is the first evidence indicating that
melatonin is not gated by a self-sustained circadian process in the horse. Melatonin is therefore not a suitable
marker of circadian phase in this species. In conjunction with recent similar findings in reindeer, it appears that
biosynthesis of melatonin in the pineal glands of some ungulates is strongly driven by the environmental light
cycle with little input from the circadian oscillator known to reside in the SCN of the mammalian hypothalamus.

Background
In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the
hypothalamus drives circadian (~24 h) rhythms in a
variety of behavioural and physiological processes,
including the sleep-activity cycle, hormone secretion,
metabolism and body temperature (for recent reviews
see [1,2]). Circadian rhythms are thus controlled by an
endogenous oscillator that enables organisms to anticipate rhythmic environmental changes (e.g. temperature,
food availability and predation pressure) and tailor their

behavioural and physiological states to the most appropriate time of solar day [3,4]. Light is the primary stimulus for synchronisation of the circadian system with the
24-h period of the earth’s rotation [5]. The SCN receives
photic information via the retino-hypothalamic tract and
subsequently transmits timing signals to peripheral
tissues throughout the body [6].
As functional timing of the neural clock cannot be
directly monitored in free-moving mammals, marker
rhythms that reflect SCN output are used to measure circadian phase position. The nightly rise of melatonin secretion from the pineal gland is considered one of the most
stable outputs from the circadian clock [7] and is thought
to represent one of the best characterized mammalian

adaptations to life on a rotating planet. Melatonin is
synthesized and secreted primarily during the dark period
of the light/dark (LD) cycle, thereby encoding the duration
of darkness and reflecting seasonal change in the length of
day and night. In doing so it provides a neuroendocrine
signal (from clock to body) that conveys seasonal timing
and regulates reproduction in seasonal breeding animals
[8,9]. Plasma levels of melatonin, cortisol, and core body
temperature have historically been used as markers of circadian phase position [7,10,11]. In diurnal mammals, there
exists an inverse relationship between plasma melatonin
and cortisol circadian rhythms with the start of the quiescent period of cortisol production phase locked approximately to the onset of melatonin production [12]. In
humans, melatonin secretion is highest during the hours
of darkness, declines in the early morning and stays low
during the daytime. In contrast, the 24-h pattern of plasma
cortisol concentration peaks in the early morning, declines
in the afternoon and remains low most of the night displaying a diurnal rhythm in humans [10] and horses
[13-16] that provides temporal regulation of mammalian
immune parameters through powerful immuno-suppressant activity [17].
In humans, deleterious disruption of the circadian system occurs in response to rotational shift work and
transmeridian travel [18]. Rapid air travel across multiple time zones results in a disruption of synchronisation
such that the previously entrained phase timing of the
biological clock leads to temporal conflict with the new
cycle of light and dark (LD). This phenomenon is
known as jet lag, and is characterised by fatigue, disturbed sleep, depression, gastrointestinal disturbance,
reduced cognitive capacity and physical performance
deficits [19-22]. These symptoms, which can persist for
days until the circadian system adjusts to the new environmental conditions, are of particular concern for athletes competing at international destinations. An initial
investigation into the severity and longevity of jet lag in
the equine athlete examined re-entrainment rates of
plasma melatonin and core body temperature following
an abrupt 6-h phase advance of the LD cycle [23]. In
contrast to studies that demonstrate a gradual adaptation of melatonin rhythms to an advanced photoperiod
[24-28], we found instead that equine melatonin
rhythms were re-entrained to a 6-h LD phase advance
on the first post-shift day. This surprising result led to
the present study.
A 24-h rhythm can only be defined as circadian when
it persists in constant conditions, such as constant darkness (DD), or constant light (LL). This continuance of
~24 h oscillations in a physiological or behavioural variable under constant conditions indicates that the
observed rhythm is endogenously controlled, and not
merely a driven response to environmental time cues.

Although the 24-h rhythm of equine core body temperature has demonstrated robust circadian regulation
under LL [29], the circadian rhythms of melatonin and
cortisol in the horse have not previously been examined
under constant conditions. The aim of the current study
was to determine the temporal pattern of melatonin and
cortisol in the horse under the constant lighting condition of extended darkness (DD). Establishing the
expected circadian regulation of these hormones would
validate their continued use as physiologically relevant
markers of circadian phase in future studies investigating the effects of jet lag on equine athletes.

Methods
All animal procedures were approved by the University
College Dublin Animal Research Ethics Committee. Six
healthy mares aged between 5 and 11 years and of
mixed light horse breed were used in this study. Mares
were maintained outdoors under natural photoperiod
for one month prior to the experiment (longitude W6.8,
latitude N53.2, County Kildare, Ireland), which was conducted at a time of year (Sept 2nd - Sept 4th, 2008) corresponding approximately to a 13.5 h light and 10.5 h
dark (LD 13.5:10.5) artificial light cycle. Barn lighting
reflected the timing of ambient dawn and dusk with
lights on at 06:38 h and lights off at 20:08 h. The light
intensity in the barn was measured using a LUXmeter
(LX-1010 B Digital Lux Meter) as 200 - 250 Lux at the
horses’ eye level. The day before initiation of sampling
mares were housed in individual stalls in a lightproof
barn (DD = < .5 Lux) and the left jugular furrow of
each mare was clipped and surgically prepared for placement of indwelling jugular catheters (MILA International, Florence, KY). The jugular catheter was secured
in place with suture (3 metric Monosof® nylon, Gosport,
UK) and bandage. Blood samples were collected for 24 h
while mares remained under the LD cycle and, without
turning lights on the following morning, for a further 22
h under constant darkness (DD). Blood sampling commenced at 07:00 h, here designated Zeitgeber Time
(ZT) 0 and continued at 2-h intervals, first for 24-h
under LD (ZT 0 - ZT 24), and then for 24-h of
extended dark under DD (CT 0 - CT 24), with the last
sample at 05:00 h (CT 22) of the second sampling day
(where ZT 24 = CT 0). Hay and water were provided ad
libitum throughout the trial and were topped up at 4-h
intervals to avoid a conspicuous 24-h temporal cue [29].
Temperature inside the barn remained relatively constant for the duration of the trial, ranging from 16-18°C.
Blood samples (6 ml; n = 6 per time point) were collected into heparinized blood tubes (BD Vacutainer Systems, Plymouth, UK). Patency of catheters was
maintained using heparinized saline flush. Blood samples were stored at ambient temperature for 2 h and

Murphy et al. Journal of Circadian Rhythms 2011, 9:3
http://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/content/9/1/3

kept overnight at 4°C. The next day, samples were centrifuged at 1600 × g for 20 min, serum was decanted
and was immediately stored at -20°C until subsequent
analysis. Samples were collected throughout the hours
of darkness with the aid of dim red flashlights (< 5 Lux).
At each time point, samples were collected from the
mares in the same order (requiring ~15 min), and care
was taken to ensure mares were only minimally disturbed by the procedure.
Melatonin radioimmunoassay (RIA)

Melatonin was measured using a Bühlmann melatonin
RIA kit (RK-MEL2, ALPCO Diagnostics, Windham,
NH). Serum aliquots (500 μl) were column extracted
according to the directions of the manufacturer and
reconstituted in 500 μl of incubation buffer solution
provided with the kit. Aliquots of the reconstituted
extracted samples (200 μl) were assayed in duplicate in
a single assay which also included kit low and high controls that confirmed assay performance (averaging 2.28
and 17.63 pg/ml respectively). As documented by the
manufacturer, the efficiency of the extraction method is
> 90%, while the assay has an estimated functional sensitivity (CV = 10%) of 0.9 pg/ml and an estimated analytical sensitivity of 0.3 pg/ml. This assay has been used
previously to examine MT levels in equine serum [23].
Cortisol radioimmunoassay (RIA)

Cortisol was measured using a Coat a Count assay kit
(Siemens, LA, USA). 25 μl of serum samples, QC samples (at three levels) and calibration standards (0-50 μg/
dl) were aliquoted in duplicate into cortisol antibody
coated tubes. 1.0 mL of 125I cortisol tracer was added
to each tube and the tubes were incubated in a waterbath at 37°C for 45 minutes. After this time, the tubes
were decanted thoroughly and counted using the
Wizard 1470 gamma counter (Perkin Elmer/Wallac,
Turku, Finland). The sensitivity of the assay was 0.2 μg/
dl. The CV% for the Quality Control samples at low,
medium and high levels were 16.5, 10.9 and 8.1%,
respectively.
Data Analysis

Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) (LD/DD cycle × Time) was used to assess
differences in MT and cortisol between 24-h LD and
DD sample collections. Bonferroni post-hoc tests were
used to evaluate differences between time points where
appropriate. Data was analyzed using GraphPad Prism
Version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA), and are presented as time point means ±
SE (Figure 1). A value of p < .05 was considered significant. The presence of circadian (24-h) temporal variation for the group means was evaluated using the

Cosinor programme of Refinetti et al (2007) [30] based
on the least squares cosine fit method of Halberg et al
(1967) [31] and also by separately computing cosine fits
to the hormone values for each mare over the first 24 h
(LD) and the final 24 h (DD) (n = 12 data points/series).

Results
Two-way repeated measures ANOVA (n = 6/time point)
of hormone levels revealed a significant circadian time
(ZT/CT) x light treatment interaction (p < .0001) for
melatonin with mean levels remaining consistently high
during DD, and thus elevated relative to LD throughout
the subjective day (i.e. at CT 2,4,6,8 and 10, Figure 1A).
In contrast there was no difference between the cortisol
profiles in LD and DD however, a significant variation
over time was observed (p = .0009) (Figure 1B). Observing substantial individual differences in the amplitude
and pattern of temporal variation of melatonin in horse
serum (pg/ml) (Figure 2A), we normalized the individual
data by expressing the value at each time point as a percentage of the ZT16-ZT22 mean, an elevation representing the nocturnal LD peak (i.e. peak average set to
100%). Viewing the data in this way (Figure 2B-C)
revealed two distinguishable patterns. In 3 mares (Figure
2B), MT rose rapidly between ZT12-ZT16, thereafter
remaining elevated, but with notable fluctuations in
Mare # 6. In the other 3 mares (Figure 2C), the initial
evening rise was followed eventually by a notable
decline, either between ZT22 and CT8 (Mare #2), or
not until the last few hours (h 28-32) of extended dark
at subjective circadian times CT16-CT22 (Mares # 4,5).
Cosinor analysis of group mean data confirmed a significant circadian component for melatonin in LD (p =
.0002) that was absent in DD (p = .51). In contrast, by
cosine analysis of group mean values, cortisol was
clearly circadian in DD (p = .0059) but the 24-h cosine
fit was shy of significance in LD (p = .076) (Table 1).
The p values for cosine fits to the LD and DD time series (12 points each) of each individual mare are also
reported in Table 1 while corresponding raw data curves
appear in Figure 2D.
Discussion
In accordance with previous studies, [16,23,32]our
results demonstrate a robust 24-h rhythm in equine
plasma MT values under an LD cycle. Surprisingly, this
rhythmicity disappeared when mares were maintained in
extended darkness (DD), providing no direct evidence
for circadian regulation of this important internal temporal cue in the horse. Specifically, following normally
scheduled lights out in the barn (~ ZT 13.5) mean melatonin levels rose rapidly, achieving expected night time
values within 2.5 h (ZT 16). Thereafter, through 32 h of
extended darkness (DD), mean MT values remained

low during hours of light (L) in LD but not during the corresponding times (subjective day, CT2-CT10) in DD. A 24-h MT rhythm is evident under

high. Furthermore, throughout this exposure to
extended dark, no individual mare showed either the
expected decline in serum MT beginning 10-12 h into
continuous dark (e.g. around expected dawn at CT 0),
or a subsequent rise coincident with subjective dusk (~
CT 14) after 24 h in continuous dark. These findings
suggest that under natural conditions, melatonin inhibition in the horse occurs in response to light and not
through an endogenous mechanism. It is worth noting
that a non-significant decline in group mean MT levels
appeared in the last 6 h of darkness (CT 18-22) as a
result of a reduction in serum MT values for 3 of the 6
mares. A plausible explanation could be exhaustion of
pineal synthetic activity after some 28-30 h of continuous activity in extended darkness. Alternatively, these
observations could be interpreted as consistent with the
emergence of an initially masked circadian signal that
could have potentially become more apparent had the
duration under DD not been limited to 32 h. However,
this would imply that the underlying circadian period
differs widely from 24 h, as the observed decline in MT
began late, at about CT6 in one mare, and at about CT

14 to CT 20 in the other two. This interpretation, which
postulates extremely variable circadian periods in DD, is
also not supported by the cortisol data presented here,
or by previously reported ~ 24 h circadian rhythms in
activity and gene expression observed in these same
horses under identical conditions [33].
Thus, for melatonin, the straight forward interpretation is that under 32 h of continuous darkness (DD),
neither group mean nor individual MT values demonstrate circadian regulation. In contrast, mean cortisol
levels showed 24-h rhythmicity in both LD and DD,
with group cosinor analysis demonstrating a more
robust circadian (24 h) component in DD. The greater
strength of the 24-h variation in DD compared to LD is
also evidenced by higher p values for individual cosine
fits in four of the mares in DD compared to LD. The
relatively high variance in the cortisol time point means
throughout LD and DD (Figure 1B) and irregular ups
and downs in the individual profiles (Figure 2D) may
relate to studies showing that minor perturbations in
the environment can eliminate the cortisol rhythm in
horses [34]. Thus visual stimulation during the

photophase combined with human activity throughout
LD and DD may have increased arousal at sampling and
feeding times, thereby resulting in increases in the overall level and variation in cortisol secretion.
Previously, plasma MT was measured in four mares at
different times of the year, namely the summer and winter solstices, and the spring and autumn equinoxes [32].
Blood samples were collected for 24 h from mares individually housed under natural photoperiod conditions,
and for a further 24 h from mares exposed to acutely
extended darkness (total darkness for 3-4 h before and
after the natural sunrise and sunset). The authors

reported a 24-h rhythm in MT secretion at each season
under an LD cycle, whereby MT elevation corresponded
to the night length. Accordingly, the mean duration of
elevated MT varied at each season, with the longest
duration observed in winter and the shortest observed
in summer. In extended darkness, the elevations in MT
were higher than those measured under natural photoperiod at all seasons except summer. Furthermore, the
rise and fall of nocturnal MT elevations occurred before
and after comparable onset/offset times measured under
natural photoperiod, instead mirroring the acutely
extended darkness of the artificial LD cycle to which the
animals were exposed. Observing this phenomenon at
each season led the authors to suggest that in horses,
natural environmental light, both at dawn and dusk,
gates the full expression of the SCN neural signal. The
SCN, in turn, regulates the daily pattern of MT secretion [32]. However, an alternative explanation supported
by the data presented here is that equine daily MT
rhythms are directly driven by the environmental photoperiod, rather than via circadian pacemaker control.
These ideas appear consistent with the observed
immediate resynchronization of the MT rhythm in
horses following an abrupt 6 h advance of the LD cycle
[23]. Additionally, the rapid 6-h phase advance of MT
that we observed contrasts starkly with previous

Murphy et al. Journal of Circadian Rhythms 2011, 9:3
http://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/content/9/1/3

observations of a gradual advance in melatonin onset
when human subjects are exposed to a comparable 6 h
phase advance of the LD cycle [26,35] and highlights the
need for improved understanding of species differences
in the photic and circadian regulation of melatonin
synthesis and secretion.
The surprising absence of a circadian MT rhythm in
DD is consistent with the conclusion that there is no
endogenous circadian regulation of MT synthesis in the
horse, at least under classic free-running conditions of
continuous darkness. Data opposing this conclusion
have been demonstrated in hamsters, primates and
sheep [36-38] where levels of MT were shown to rise
spontaneously during subjective nights. Ours is clearly
an unexpected finding but the simultaneous demonstration here of a cortisol circadian rhythm in DD, and previously, that in constant conditions horses display other
circadian rhythms, including those in body temperature
[27], peripheral clock gene expression and locomotor
activity [33] implies that horses, like other vertebrates,
possess a fully competent, self sustained circadian pacemaker presumably in their SCN. Thus, the intriguing
questions are: How and why is it that the equine melatonin rhythm fails to persist as a circadian rhythm in
continuous darkness? Has MT synthesis become totally
uncoupled from circadian (SCN) regulation? Alternatively, are the circadian oscillators regulating melatonin
secretion in the horse highly dampened? Whatever the
mechanism, is circadian regulation absent at all times,
or is the absence restricted to a particular season, or set
of experimental conditions? Such questions can only be
answered by further study.
It is worth highlighting the known differences in regulation of melatonin production between rodents and
ungulates. In contrast to rodents, the nocturnal rise of
melatonin arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT)
in sheep is not accompanied by a similar rise in AANAT mRNA expression [39], such that the biosynthesis
of MT is primarily gated by post-translational control
[40]. Johnston et al (2004) have extended these findings
of interspecies differences by demonstrating that the
ovine pineal also differs from that of the rodent by the
absence of rhythmic expression of inducible cyclic AMP
early repressor (ICER) and Cryptochrome 1 and the
authors suggest that this may reflect evidence of differences in evolutionary divergence between ruminants and
rodents [41]. It is possible that as yet unrevealed differences in melatonin regulation may exist between ruminants and non-ruminant ungulates such as the horse,
that in turn reflect the evolutionary timeline since the
phylogenetic split between Artiodactyls and Perissodactyls and the emergence of differences in their adaptive
lifestyles.

A lack of rhythmicity in production of the MT hormone has also been observed in reindeer [42]. Similar to
the results obtained in the current study, reindeer displayed robust MT rhythmicity when housed under an
LD cycle. However when animals were placed in DD for
72 h, their MT levels increased and remained significantly higher than daytime levels for about 24 h, fell to
baseline for about 12 h, and then rose again expressing
a second ~ 24 h elevation, thus oscillating in DD (with
a period of about 36 h) but also failing to demonstrate a
~24-h circadian rhythm. Stokkan et al. (2007) postulate
that to maintain precise seasonal timing in an extreme
environment, MT secretion in reindeer, and also perhaps in other Arctic animals, is driven directly by
changes in photoperiod and not by circadian machinery
[42]. A more recent study in reindeer showed acute daytime elevations of melatonin in short (2.5 h) intervals of
darkness experienced during the ambient photophase
(in a single 2.5D:2.5L:2.5D cycle) and that, in contrast to
rat [43], cultured fibroblast cells from this species do
not exhibit robust circadian rhythms in clock gene
expression [44]. In this regard, horses are less exceptional as robust clock gene rhythmicity has been demonstrated both in cultured fibroblasts and in peripheral
tissue biopsies [33,45]. Reindeer are similar to horses in
that they are large seasonal breeding (albeit short-day
breeding) ungulates. Lu et al (2010) speculate that
entrainment of annual reproductive cycles in reindeer
may depend on informative melatonin signals confined
to specific times of year. Similarly in the horse, it is
appealing to consider whether the amplitude of the MT
rhythm, the strength of its photoperiodic/SCN regulation, or the ability to display a circadian rhythm in continuous darkness, may vary with season or time of year.
These are questions ripe for future study. In particular,
it will be interesting to investigate the pattern of MT
secretion under continuous dim illumination (of an
intensity equivalent to natural starlight and/or moonlight) at different seasons, particularly in advance of the
onset of the mare’s natural breeding season (April May).

Conclusions
This study has revealed the unexpected failure of the
daily rhythm of equine MT to persist as a circadian
rhythm in DD, implying that MT is not a suitable marker of circadian phase in horses. In contrast, the less
robust daily rhythm in cortisol persisted as a circadian
rhythm in DD. Additionally, the present findings alter
the implications of a jet lag study in which we reported
rapid re-entrainment of the equine MT rhythm following a 6-h phase advance of the LD cycle. That is, the
present finding of an absence of circadian variation in
MT in continuous darkness, suggests that this rapid

Murphy et al. Journal of Circadian Rhythms 2011, 9:3
http://www.jcircadianrhythms.com/content/9/1/3

realignment of the MT rhythm should instead be viewed
as further evidence that in the horse the MT rhythm is
largely driven by the LD cycle, rather than entrained by
it in circadian fashion. Because the 24 h melatonin
rhythm is a recognized internal temporal signal in mammals, and is able to contribute to resetting and entrainment of the SCN clock [27,46], it’s rapid adjustment to
the external LD cycle may have important consequences
for the broader temporal adjustment of the equine circadian system following transmeridian travel, even though
MT itself, may not qualify as a good marker of SCN
phase. Further, the present results provide impetus for
new studies to identify additional robust markers of circadian phase in the horse so that we may better understand the effects of transmeridian travel on temporal
aspects of equine physiology and behaviour.
