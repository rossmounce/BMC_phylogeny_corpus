Abstract
Background: Divergence of bacterial populations into distinct subpopulations is often the result of ecological
isolation. While some studies have suggested the existence of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica subclades,
evidence for these subdivisions has been ambiguous. Here we used a comparative genomics approach to define
the population structure of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, and identify clade-specific genes that may be the
result of ecological specialization.
Results: Multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data for 16 newly
sequenced and 30 publicly available genomes showed an unambiguous subdivision of S. enterica subsp. enterica
into at least two subpopulations, which we refer to as clade A and clade B. Clade B strains contain several cladespecific genes or operons, including a b-glucuronidase operon, a S-fimbrial operon, and cell surface related genes,
which strongly suggests niche specialization of this subpopulation. An additional set of 123 isolates was assigned
to clades A and B by using qPCR assays targeting subpopulation-specific SNPs and genes of interest. Among 98
serovars examined, approximately 20% belonged to clade B. All clade B isolates contained two pathogenicity
related genomic islands, SPI-18 and a cytolethal distending toxin islet; a combination of these two islands was
previously thought to be exclusive to serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A. Presence of b-glucuronidase in clade B
isolates specifically suggests an adaptation of this clade to the vertebrate gastrointestinal environment.
Conclusions: S. enterica subsp. enterica consists of at least two subpopulations that differ specifically in genes
involved in host and tissue tropism, utilization of host specific carbon and nitrogen sources and are therefore likely
to differ in ecology and transmission characteristics.

Background
Salmonella is a human and animal pathogen that causes
considerable disease burden worldwide. The genus contains two species, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella
enterica. S. enterica can be further subdivided into six
subspecies. Of the six subspecies, Salmonella enterica
subspecies enterica is most commonly associated with

disease and has undergone the most diversification, as
this subspecies comprises approximately 60% of all currently described > 2600 Salmonella serovars [1]. In the
United States an estimated 11% of the foodborne illnesses are caused by Salmonella, which makes it the
most prevalent non-viral foodborne pathogen [2]. The
two most common disease manifestations of human Salmonella infections are gastroenteritis and typhoid fever.
Many Salmonella serovars can cause a self-limiting gastroenteritis, yet a limited number of Salmonella serovars
(so-called typhoid serovars), most commonly S. Typhi

and S. Paratyphi A, can cause typhoid fever, a more
severe systemic disease [3].
Because of the severity and often fatal consequences of
typhoid fever, these serovars have been the subject of
comparative genomic and population genetic studies,
which indicate that S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A are clonal pathogens, and that S. Typhi emerged only recently
(between 10,000 and 43,000 years ago) [4]. These serovars are only very closely related over 20% of their genome, which is indicative of convergent evolution [5].
They share several pathogenicity islands including SPI18, a genomic islet encoding the invasion associated
TaiA protein and the intracellularly expressed poreforming hemolysin HlyE [6], and a genomic islet encoding a tripartite cytolethal distending toxin [7].
While serotyping according to the White-KauffmannLe Minor scheme (formerly the Kauffman-White
scheme [1]) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis are still
the subtyping methods of choice in outbreak investigations [8], several approaches have been applied over the
last two decades to elucidate the population structure of
S. enterica subsp. enterica, such as multilocus enzyme
electrophoresis [9], microarray based gene content
assessment [10], amplified fragment length polymorphism [11] and multilocus sequence analysis [12,13]. These
studies have greatly improved our understanding of the
evolution of Salmonella, and, in particular, have shown
that while the majority of serovars represent single evolutionary lineages, some serovars (such as Saintpaul [9]
Newport, and Kentucky [14,15]), actually occur in several unrelated phylogenetic lineages. None of these studies however demonstrated an unambiguous subdivision
of subsp. enterica into distinct lineages; for instance
Falush et al. [13] found two main lineages (clade A and
B) in S. enterica subsp. enterica, however doubted the
biological significance of these lineages due to low bootstrap support and extensive allele sharing. A recent
study by Parsons et al. [16] showed that the subdivision
found by Falush et al. has biological significance, as the
two lineages seem to differ in b-glucuronidase activity,
the presence of virulence associated genes and host
specificity.
In this report we used a comparative population genomic approach to (i) assess population divergence within
S. enterica subsp. enterica, and (ii) search for differences
in gene content putatively associated with ecological
divergence of these subpopulations. Additionally we
used genomic and PCR-based approaches to (i) map the
distribution of SPI-18 and the cytolethal distending
toxin islet (called the CdtB-islet from here on) within
the S. enterica subsp. enterica population, and (ii) to
investigate the evolutionary relationships between SPI18 and the CdtB-islet found in non-typoid serovars and
typhoid serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A.

Results and Discussion
S. enterica subsp. enterica consists of at least two
divergent subpopulations

Phylogenetic analysis of 93 randomly selected core genome loci (see Methods) in 16 newly sequenced and 30
publicly available S. enterica subsp. enterica genomes
(additional file 1) as well as one publicly available S.
enterica subsp. arizonae genome revealed two divergent
subpopulations of subsp. enterica, called clade A and
clade B hereafter (Figure 1). The division into two distinct clades is also well supported by a maximum likelihood phylogeny, and a split decomposition phylogenetic
network based on all core SNPs in the pan genome
(additional file 2), which indicates that phylogenetic signal that supports subdivision of S. enterica subsp. enterica is not limited to the 93 randomly selected loci, but
instead is present genome-wide. Clade B seems to largely overlap with division F identified in a previous
multi locus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) study [9].
While the subdivision of S. enterica subsp. enterica into
two clades was previously suggested by Falush et al.
[13], using a traditional seven gene MLST, this subdivision did not achieve strong bootstrap support in this
previous analysis due to extensive allele sharing. While
this paper was under review, Didelot et al. [17] published a population genetic study of S. enterica subsp.
enterica using approximately 300 kbp of sequence data
of the core genome for 114 isolates. They identified five
well-supported lineages in subsp. enterica, of which one
(lineage 3) coincides with clade B presented here, while
the other four lineages appear as subclades in clade A.
Our study, as well as the Didelot et al. [17] study, shows
that extensive sequence data sets (such as full genome
sequence data) are needed to improve our understanding of the evolution of S. enterica.
Clade A consists of three highly supported (posterior
probability > 0.99) subclades; (i) a subclade consisting of
serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Mississippi and Adelaide
(the Typhi clade), (ii) a subclade consisting of serovars
Kentucky, Tennessee, Senftenberg, Weltevreden and
Agona (the Agona clade), and (iii) a subclade containing
the remainder of the clade A serovars (see Figure 1 and
additional file 2). The fact that S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi
A are found in a well supported subclade, suggests that
similarity in gene content between these serovars can
not only be attributed to convergent evolution due to
adaptation to the human host, as suggested by Didelot
et al. [5], but also reflects shared recent common
ancestry.
Although the split of clade B from within S. enterica
subsp. enterica is well supported by a high posterior
probabilities (1.0) and high bootstrap values (Figure 1;
additional file 2), ancestry analysis [18] of the 93 core
genome loci (Figure 1) suggests that allele sharing

through horizontal gene transfer and homologous
recombination between the clades has occurred, but not
to the extent that divergence between the two clades
has been eliminated. A similar pattern of divergent
lineages in the face of high recombination rates has
been observed in Escherichia coli [19], which suggests
that this may be a common pattern in enteric bacteria
related to host niche specialization. Isolates representing
some clade A serovars (i.e., Senftenberg, Kentucky,
Agona, Tennessee, Weltevreden) possess a high proportion (between 21 and 32%) genetic material from clade
B, suggesting that they represent intermediate genotypes, an interpretation that is also supported by SNPbased phylogenies (additional file 2). As our population
genetic analysis suggested that most members of the
Typhi clade (except Adelaide) may share a considerable
amount of genetic material (between 5 and 9%) with S.

enterica subsp. arizonae, pairwise comparisons between
S. Typhi and S. enterica subsp. arizonae genomes were
performed. Among 2,241 shared ORFs, only 23 showed
pairwise nucleotide divergence < 1%, providing no evidence for a significant proportion of highly conserved
genes. This suggests that members of the Typhi clade
received genetic material from S. enterica subspecies
other than subsp. arizonae. Genome sequencing of additional S. enterica subspecies will be necessary to test this
hypothesis.
Clade-specific genes suggest differences in adhesion,
colonization properties, and metabolic capabilities
between S. enterica subsp. enterica clades

Genes that are differentially maintained in bacterial subpopulations are likely to reveal differential selective pressures acting on these subpopulations [20]. To identify

Figure 2 Heatmap of gene presence (red) and absence (white) of genes enriched in their presence in clade A or clade B. The cluster
diagram on the left is based on the presence/absence data of the enriched genes. Genes were ordered according to their position in the
reference genomes. Fimbrial operons are indicated with their standard locus names; sta, tcf, sfa and K88 for clade B, and stf and lpf for clade A.

putative differentially maintained genes we searched for
genes that were either clade A or clade B enriched (see
Methods section and Figure 2). The most abundant
group of genes that were enriched in either clade were
genes associated with fimbrial operons. We found two
fimbrial operons (stf and lpf) to be conserved among
clade A genomes, and absent among clade B genomes,
while we found one clade B specific fimbrial operon
(sfa), and three fimbrial operons (sta, tcf, and a K88-like
fimbrial operon) that were clade B enriched. This differential distribution of fimbrial operons suggests that the
two clades differ in their adhesion abilities.
Another gene indicative of putative niche differentiation between the two clades encodes a putative metalloprotease with homology to Bacterial and Baculoviridae
enhancins; this gene is present in all clade B genomes,
but found in only 2/36 clade A genomes. This protein
not only increases infectivity of Baculoviridae by degrading the peritrophic membrane of insect midguts [21],
but a homolog of this enhancin has also been found in

the genome of Yersinia pestis [22], which survives in
both mammals and insect host. The presence of this
gene therefore suggests that insects may play a role as
alternate hosts for clade B strains.
We further found differences among clade A and
clade B in the presence of two genomic regions involved
in nitrogen and carbon metabolism, the b-glucuronidase
operon in clade B and the allantoin catabolism island in
clade A. The b-glucuronidase operon is exclusively
found in clade B genomes and enables the organism to
use glucuronides as an additional carbon source.
Because glucuronides are typically found in the gall
bladder [23] and gut environment of vertebrate hosts
[24,25], b-glucuronidase-positive strains may have a fitness advantage in the vertebrate gastrointestinal environment. To prove this fitness advantage, additional
competition experiments involving the comparison of
the fitness of wild type strains and b-glucuronidase deletion mutants in a vertebrate host are necessary. Phenotypic screening for b-glucuronidase activity using a

fluorogenic substrate indicated that this locus is functional in all clade B strains (Figure 3).
The allantoin catabolism island confers the ability to
use allantoin as the sole carbon and nitrogen source
[26], and is found to be present, in its entirety, in 73%
of the clade A genomes, and absent in clade B, with the
exception of the genome of the Montevideo strain we
sequenced. This is putatively an adaptation to the mammalian host, as allantoin is the end-product of the

purine catabolic pathway of most mammals, with the
exception of Hominoids [27]. In Hominoids, birds and
most reptiles the end-product of the purine catabolic
pathway is uric acid. As pointed out by Kingsley et al.
[28], the allantoin catabolism island is non-functional
due to gene degradation in some genomes of human
(Typhi and Paratyphi A) and bird (Gallinarum)
restricted serovars, possibly due to it being obsolete for
survival in non-allantoin producing hosts. Conversely,

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:425
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/425

the allantoin catabolism cluster may be conserved in
genomes of serovars that are adapted to allantoin-producing hosts, such as S. Dublin, a serovar adapted to
bovine hosts [29]. Gene degradation is observed in the
allantoin catabolism cluster in two strains of S. Typhimurium (D23580 [28] and DT104) and may therefore
indicate that these strains may have shifted from a
broad host range associated with S. Typhimurium [29]
or cattle adapted [30] as in S. Typhimurium DT104, to
being more (human) host specific. However, this correlation of gene degradation in the allantoin catabolism
cluster and host specificity does not seem to be a general rule. The genomes of human host specific serovars
such as Paratyphi B and Paratyphi C have a full allantoin catabolism cluster, while gene degradation within
the cluster is observed in S. Cholerasuis, a serovar predominantly associated with pigs [29], which are allantoin
producing hosts [31].
Several typhoid-associated pathogenicity islands are also
conserved in clade B serovars

Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) and islets are
horizontally acquired genomic islands that encode virulence factors and other proteins important for pathogenesis, persistence in the host, and host specificity [32].
The distribution of SPIs may be indicative of potential
differences in niche specialization among different Salmonella strains. In total, eight SPIs/islets (SPI-1, SPI-2,
SPI-4, SPI-5, SPI-9, SPI-11, SPI-12 and CS54) were
found to be present in all sequenced serovars. On the
opposite end of the spectrum, four SPIs were restricted
to a single sequenced serovar; such as SPI-7 and SPI-15
(only found in S. Typhi), and SPIs 20-21 (only found in
S. enterica subsp. arizonae). Another four SPIs (SPI-8,
10, 17 and 19) were found to have limited presence and
were identified in only two to eight (< 18%) of
sequenced serovars. Interestingly, among these 8 serovar
restricted and limited SPIs, five (SPI-7, 8, 10, 15, and
17) were associated with human-specific typhoid causing
serovars, i.e., S. Paratyphi A and/or S. Typhi, while two
(20, and 21) were associated with S. enterica subsp. arizonae. The remaining 8 SPIs/islets were observed to
have a mixed pattern of distribution, being present in at
least six serovars.
Further analysis of the 8 SPIs with mixed distribution
patterns identified three pathogenicity islands (SPI-18,
the CdtB-islet, and GICT18/1) that were present in all
clade B isolates as well as S. Typhi, and S. Paratyphi A,
but absent from all other clade A isolates. SPI-18
encodes two genes important for pathogenesis including
hlyE, encoding an intracellularly expressed pore-forming
hemolysin, and taiA, encoding an invasion associated
protein [6]. The CdtB-islet or typhoid toxin islet that
was previously described by Spano et al. [7], encodes a

Page 6 of 11

tripartite toxin consisting of a cytolethal distending
toxin subunit B (CdtB) and two pertussis-like toxin subunits (PltA and PltB). In S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A and
clade B strains the CdtB-islet is found in SPI-11. A
divergent CdtB-islet was also found in S. Inverness
(where it is on a putative mobile element) and S. enterica subsp. arizonae; in both of these strains the CdtBislet was in a different chromosomal location as compared to the clade B strains and S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. A search in the SEED-viewer (http://seed-viewer.
theseed.org) also revealed a divergent CdtB-islet in S.
bongori (GenBank accession number FR877557;
SBG_1077 - SBG_1081). In almost all examined strains
the GICT18/1 islet is inserted in the sapABCDF operon;
this insertion has previously been shown to disrupt antimicrobial peptide resistance [33]. GICT18/1 harbors
another two-subunit pertussis-like toxin, encoded by
artA and artB [33], which have 59 and 73% nucleotide
sequence identity, respectively, to pltA and pltB in the
CdtB-islet [34]. S. Inverness carries the artAB locus, but
on a putative prophage, much like the artAB islet previously reported in S. Typhimurium DT104 [34].
In addition to the virulence islands described above,
we also found a cluster of four putative membrane and
exported proteins (S. Typhi genes STY3343 - STY3346)
that was present in all clade B serovars as well as S.
Typhi, S. Paratyphi A and S. Weltevreden, but absent
from other clade A serovars. The functional relevance of
this gene cluster is unknown, but the fact that its distribution mirrors that of SPI-18, the CdtB-islet, and to a
large extent GICT18/1 suggests that these genes may
also play a role in the virulence of clade B, S. Typhi, and
S. Paratyphi A.
Distribution of clade B isolates and typhoid-associated
pathogenicity islands among S. enterica subsp. enterica
serovars

To further investigate the distribution, among the S.
enterica subsp. enterica population, of SPIs and islets
shared between clade B, S. Typhi, and S. Paratyphi A,
targeted screening was performed against a panel of 123
isolates, expanding the number total number of characterized serovars to 98. Clade membership was assessed
using a set of three genotyping assays targeting clade B
specific SNPs, while TaqMan assays targeting hlyE (SPI18), cdtB, pltA, and pltB (the CtdB-islet), and artA
(GICT18/1) were used to screen for the presence of
three islands (Methods). In addition, strains were
screened for b-glucuronidase activity, a clade B-specific
phenotype linked to the presence of the b-glucuronidase
operon (see above). Isolates representing 24 serovars
(including the nine already classified into clade B based
on full genome sequence data; see Figure 1) had two or
three clade B specific SNP alleles and were therefore

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:425
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/425

considered to be members of clade B (Figure 3). The
hlyE, cdtB, pltA, and pltB loci were present in 95% of
isolates classified into clade B, the only exception being
a S. Nyanza isolate, which did not yield a cdtB or pltA
PCR amplicon and may thus harbor an incomplete
CtdB-islet. While artA was not detected in five clade B
isolates (Figure 3), all of these isolates were positive for
b-glucuronidase activity.
Isolates representing 41 serovars (in addition to the 28
already classified in Figure 1) had three clade A SNP
alleles and were b-glucuronidase negative, indicating
putative membership in clade A. artA was found in a
few isolates classified as clade A; the irregular presence
of the artAB toxin locus in both clades A and B may be
due to the fact that this locus can be found on prophages [34]. While the majority of clade A isolates (108/
123) did not encode SPI-18 and the CtdB-islet, 10 of the
clade A isolates in our panel were positive for both of
these pathogenicity islets (Figure 3). These isolates
included, as expected, serovars Paratyphi A and Typhi,
but surprisingly also included serovars Mississippi and
Wandsworth, two serovars for which the sequenced isolates did not harbor SPI-18 or the CtdB-islet. Independent MLST data (obtained from http://mlst.ucc.ie/mlst/
dbs/Senterica) for three S. Mississippi isolates are consistent with the existence of two clonal complexes, with
one isolate differing from the other two at six of the
seven loci; we thus propose that the Mississippi strains
in the screening panel and the sequenced strain may
represent two distinct clonal groups. As only a single S.
Wandsworth isolate is present in the MLST database,
we could not further confirm that this serovar is also
polyphyletic. Additional clade A serovars that harbor
SPI-18 and the CdtB-islet are Corvallis, Cubana, Georgia, Indiana, Kiambu, and Kintambo (Figure 3). As
sequence information is sparse or non-existent for these
serovars, determining their phylogenetic relationship to
S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A will require additional
sequence data. None of these clade A SPI-18 and CdtBislet positive serovars has been linked to a large number
of disease cases; among these, the serovar most frequently associated with human disease cases in the US
(based on 1996 to 2006 data) was Kiambu with a total
of 409 cases (of 390,767 total cases) (http://www.cdc.
gov/ncidod/dbmd/phlisdata/salmonella.htm). While this
suggests that the presence of SPI-18 and CdtB-islet in a
clade A strain is not necessarily associated with
increased virulence, we did observe a striking correlation
between the presence of SPI-18 and the presence of
CdtB-islet across clades A and B (Figure 3). All 54 isolates (representing 38 serovars; see Figure 3) that carried
a full CdtB-islet (as indicated by positive PCR assays for
cdtB, pltA and pltB) also have the SPI-18 gene hlyE;
only two of the 56 strains with the hlyE locus lack a full

Page 7 of 11

CdtB-islet. Future experimental work will be needed to
clarify if these two loci may be functionally co-dependent, particularly in non-typhoid serovars.
Isolates representing 6 serovars had one clade B and
two clade A SNP alleles, indicating ambiguous clade
membership. One of these isolates, a S. Senftenberg
strain unrelated to the sequenced strain, did not harbor
SPI-18 (hlyE) or the CdtB-islet (cdtB, pltA and pltB).
Three isolates representing S. Panama, S. Oranienburg
and S. Arechavaleta were positive for SPI-18, the CdtBislet and exhibited b-glucuronidase activity, while S.
Agbeni and S. Poona were positive for SPI-18 and the
CdtB-islet, but did not exhibit b-glucuronidase activity
(Figure 3). This supports that a small proportion of the
S. enterica subsp. enterica population may be of mixed
clade A and clade B origin.
Serovar Reading included two isolates, one each classified into clade B (three clade B SNPs, SPI-18, CdtB-islet,
and b-glucuronidase positive) and clade A (three clade
A SNPs, SPI-18, CdtB-islet, and b-glucuronidase negative). We propose that this serovar may be polyphyletic,
as has been previously observed for S. Saintpaul and S.
Newport [15], further indicating that isolates with identical serovars may not always represent the same clonal
group.
We found that among 98 serovars examined, approximately 25% belonged to clade B. This may be explained
by the fact that we examined isolates that were almost
entirely derived from human clinical cases. Parson et al.
[16] found that clade A was the prevalent clade among
isolates from mammals (67% of the isolates), while clade
B was significantly overrepresented (80%) among isolates
from reptiles. The high prevalence of clade A isolates in
our study is most likely an effect of differences in host
specificity of clade A and clade B.
Typhi virulence gene repertoire consists of a unique
combination of ancestral and newly acquired genes

Horizontal gene transfer is known to have contributed
to the evolution of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A [5].
Over 20% of the genome of these two serovars is nearly
identical, indicating recent, extensive gene sharing [5].
Furthermore, the Vi capsular operon of S. Typhi is
99.88% identical to that of S. Paratyphi C, which is only
distantly related, though the direction of this putative
transfer is unknown [35]. The presence of SPI-18, the
CdtB-islet, and GICT18/1 in only a small subset of
clade A strains, including S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A,
suggests that these loci may have been horizontally
transferred from a clade B strain into those strains. Evidence for recombination breakpoints was found in all
three islands and therefore the phylogeny for each nonrecombinant block within the islands was analyzed independently. The SPI-18 phylogeny, omitting the first 494

den Bakker et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:425
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/425

nt, which are upstream of hlyE and taiA, shows a deep
split between clade B and the Typhi and Paratyphi A
clade (additional file 3). A similar topology is observed
for the artAB toxins in GICT18/1, and most of the
CdtB-islet, with the exception of pltB (see below). The
deep branching between clade B and the Typhi and
Paratyphi A clade indicates that these islands have not
been transferred between the clades, at least not subsequent to the diversification of clade B.
In order to probe for evidence for large scale horizontal gene transfer between clade B strains and S. Typhi,
pairwise comparisons of gene similarities between nine
clade B genomes and S. Typhi were computed, and
nucleotide divergence histograms were plotted (additional file 4). Didelot, et al. [5] previously used a similar
approach to probe for large scale horizontal gene transfer in S. Typhi and Paratyphi A, but at the time, no
clade B genomes were available for comparison. Our
analyses did not reveal a class of genes that were highly
conserved between clade B genomes and Typhi (additional file 4), indicating that extensive recent allele sharing has not occurred between any of these clade B
strains and S. Typhi. As further evidence against recent
horizontal transfer of the SPI-18, the CdtB-islet, and
GICT18/1 genomic islands, these loci are more divergent between clades than the average gene. For example,
nucleotide divergence values of SPI-18, the CdtB-islet,
and GICT18/1 between S. Schwarzengrund (clade B)
and S. Typhi are 3.4%, 3.0%, and 2.6%, respectively, all
much higher than the genome-wide average divergence
of 1.3%. None of these islands are among the 20% of the
genome that has been recently exchanged between S.
Typhi and S. Paratyphi A [5]. Based on these results, it
is likely that these islands have been vertically inherited
from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of
clades A and B. However, horizontal transfer from an
ancient clade B ancestor to the S. Typhi clade cannot be
ruled out. Though most of the sequence in these islands
appears not to have been horizontally transferred, a 488
nt fragment of GICT18/1 encoding an integrase, and a
728 nt fragment of the pltB gene in the CdtB-islet have
phylogenies consistent with horizontal transfer from a
clade B strain to S. Paratyphi A (additional file 3). Overall, our data thus suggests that the unusual virulence
phenotype of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A can be attributed to a unique combination of recently acquired virulence factors, such as the mobile Vi capsular operon in
S. Typhi, and ancestral conserved virulence factors such
as SPI-18 and the CdtB-islet.

Conclusions
In this study we provide further evidence that Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica represents two evolutionary clades with distinct genome characteristics,

Page 8 of 11

including different virulence gene repertoires, suggesting
that transmission characteristics and ecology are distinct
between these groups. This study will provide a population genetic framework for future studies on the evolution of virulence and transmission characteristics in
Salmonella enterica. As the commonly studied nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars (i.e., Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Newport), all represent clade A strains, our
study specifically suggests a need to include a clade B
strain in future studies of Salmonella pathogenesis and
virulence.

Methods
Bacterial isolates

A total of 16 isolates representing different Salmonella
serovars (i.e., Montevideo, Inverness, Rubislaw, Give,
Mississippi, Urbana, Uganda, Senftenberg, Gaminara,
Baildon, Minnesota, Hvittingfoss, Adelaide, Alachua,
Wandsworth, and Johannesburg; additional file 1) were
selected for full genome sequencing.
DNA sequencing and assembly

DNA sequencing and de novo assembly was performed
using the Applied Biosystems SOLiD™ system as previously described [36], using the complete genomes of S.
Enteritidis P125109 (GenBank accession NC_011294)
and S. Typhimurium 14028S (CP001363) as reference
for scaffolding of the de novo assembled contigs. Pseudogenomes were prepared and submitted to RAST [37]
for automatic annotations (http://rast.nmpdr.org/). After
automatic annotation of the genomes, the annotations
were manually curated with an emphasis on mobile elements and pathogenicity related genes. GenBank accession numbers are provided in additional file 1; assembly
statistics are given in additional file 5. ORFs from each
strain were compared to the GenBank non-redundant
protein database by BLASTX, and when two adjacent
ORFs, separated by a sequence gap, were found to
match adjacent fragments of the same subject protein,
the ORF sequences were merged, in frame, for downstream analyses. The SOLiD™ system is intended for
research use only and is not intended for animal or
human therapeutic or diagnostic use.
Genome comparison, identification of unique genomic
regions and clade enriched genes

Sequences unique to groups of genomes were identified
using the MUMmer software package [38] to compare
inclusion and exclusion genomes to a single reference
sequence. A custom Perl script identified sequences of
at least 100 nt that are at least 95% identical in all inclusion strains, and that do not match any exclusion strains
with greater than 80% identity. Orthologous genes in the
genomes were found using a all-against-all BLAST

approach as implemented in R [39] scripts of L. Snipen
[40]. The pangenome matrix resulting from these scripts
was used for the enrichment analysis. A clade gene
enrichment statistic was computed for each group of
orthologous genes. This statistic is as follows: Cs = (nA/
A)-(nB/B), where Cs is the clade gene enrichment statistic, n A is the number of clade A genomes in which a
certain ortholog is present, A is the total number of
clade A genomes, nB is the number of clade B genomes
in which this ortholog is present and B is the total number of clade B genomes. This statistic is -1 when a certain ortholog is only present in clade B and 1 when a
certain ortholog is only present in clade A. The cutoff
value of Cs was chosen to obtain the lowest 0.5% and
the highest 0.5%. These orthologs were manually annotated and checked for putative artifacts resulting from
the use of draft genomes. An overview of the ORFs
found in this analysis can be found in additional file 6.

performed to find the optimal K- value. The K-value for
which the highest likelihood of observing data was found
(K = 4) was used for three runs of 50,000 pre-burn-in
and 100,000 post burn-in generations. The results of the
run with the highest likelihood score of observing the
data are shown in Figure 1.
SNPs were identified using the MUMmer software
package [38] and core SNPs (those in chromosomal
regions that are present in all S. enterica subsp. enterica
genomes) were compiled using Perl scripts. Maximum
likelihood SNP trees were inferred with RaxML 7.0.4
[47] using the rapid bootstrap procedure to infer nonparametric bootstrap values.
Recombination/breakpoint analyses for SPI-18, the
CdtB-islet and GICT18/1 were performed by using
GARD [48]. Maximum likelihood phylogenies for the
individual fragments between breakpoints were inferred
with PAUP* 4.010b [49].

Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses

Quantitative PCR analyses

For the construction of an intraspecific phylogeny, 100
loci were initially selected from a randomized list of
genes found in the core genome of 30 S. enterica subspecies enterica strains and one subsp. arizonae strain.
Genes that were previously shown be under positive
selection and/or recombination [41], or were part of a
multicopy gene family or highly fragmented due to
assembly artifacts were excluded from this selection.
Seven loci were excluded from the analyses because they
were not present in some of the 16 draft genomes that
were added to the analysis in a later stage of the study.
Initial sequence alignments of the individual genes were
created in RAST using CLUSTAL W version 1.8.3 [42].
These alignments were all individually inspected and
trimmed to match the length of the shortest ORF in the
alignment. Large insertion deletion regions were
excluded from the alignments. The XMFA formatted file
of the alignments can be found in additional file 7. A
phylogeny based on these 93 loci (representing 73,761 nt
in total) was inferred using Clonalframe version 1.2 [43];
six individual runs of 50,000 generations pre-burn-in and
250,000 generations post-burn-in were performed with
the scaled mutational rate θ set equal to Watterson’s
moment estimator and the mean tract length of imported
sequence fragments fixed to 1,268 nt for all runs. Two
runs were discarded because of improper convergence,
and the trees of the four properly converged runs (as
determined by the Gelman-Rubin test [44]) were combined to produce a summary tree using TreeAnnotator
(part of the BEAST package [45]). Mixture of ancestry as
inferred from the 93 loci data set by STRUCTURE version 2.3.3 [46], using the linkage model [18]. Initially five
individual runs with a K value of 2 to 6, and with 10,000
pre-burn-in and 20,000 post burn-in generations were

Primers and probes used for the quantitative PCR based
population screen can be found in additional file 8.
SNPs were detected using TaqMan® genotyping assays,
which have one dye-labeled probe targeting each of the
two alleles. Endpoint results of SNP assays were evaluated using TaqMan® Genotyper software (Applied Biosystems), which calls genotypes based on the relative
intensity of the two fluorescent dyes.
Phenotypic analyses

b-glucuronidase activity was determined by growing the
isolates in EC MUG broth (EMD Chemicals Inc., Gibbstown NJ) for 16 hours, after which the presence of the
fluorogenic product 4-methylumbelliferone was quantified using a Packard fusion instrument (Perkin-Elmer).
