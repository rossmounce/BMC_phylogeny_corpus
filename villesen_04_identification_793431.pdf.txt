Abstract
Background: Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) comprise a large class of repetitive
retroelements. Most HERVs are ancient and invaded our genome at least 25 million years ago,
except for the evolutionary young HERV-K group. The far majority of the encoded genes are
degenerate due to mutational decay and only a few non-HERV-K loci are known to retain intact
reading frames. Additional intact HERV genes may exist, since retroviral reading frames have not
been systematically annotated on a genome-wide scale.
Results: By clustering of hits from multiple BLAST searches using known retroviral sequences we
have mapped 1.1% of the human genome as retrovirus related. The coding potential of all identified
HERV regions were analyzed by annotating viral open reading frames (vORFs) and we report 7836
loci as verified by protein homology criteria. Among 59 intact or almost-intact viral polyproteins
scattered around the human genome we have found 29 envelope genes including two novel
gammaretroviral types. One encodes a protein similar to a recently discovered zebrafish retrovirus
(ZFERV) while another shows partial, C-terminal, homology to Syncytin (HERV-W/FRD).
Conclusions: This compilation of HERV sequences and their coding potential provide a useful tool
for pursuing functional analysis such as RNA expression profiling and effects of viral proteins, which
may, in turn, reveal a role for HERVs in human health and disease. All data are publicly available
through a database at http://www.retrosearch.dk.

Background
It has become evident that the human genome harbors a
fairly small number of genes, and exons account for little
over 1% of our DNA. This stands in stark contrast to various types of repetitive DNA, and it has been estimated
that transposable elements alone take up almost half of
our genome [1]. Among such multi-copy elements are
human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). These represent stably inherited copies of integrated retroviral

genomes (so-called provirus structures) that have entered
our ancestors' genome. It has been estimated that HERVs
and related sequences such as solitary long terminal
repeat structures (solo-LTRs) and retrotransposon-like
(env-deficient) elements constitute approximately 8% of
the human genome [1].
Phylogenetic analysis of the retroviral polymerase gene
(pol) [2] and envelope genes (env) [3] have identified at

least 26 distinct HERV groups. However, less well-defined
sequence comparisons suggest that there may be well over
100 different HERV groups [4,5]. Within the family of Retroviridae most of the seven genera are represented by
endogenous members, and HERVs are divided into class I,
II and III depending on sequence relatedness to gammaretroviruses, betaretroviruses or spumaviruses, respectively.
Many HERVs are named according to tRNA usage (i.e.
HERV-K has a primer binding site that matches a lysine
tRNA), while others have been more or less provisionally
named by their discoverer. It seems increasingly clear that
the nomenclature for endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)
needs to be revised to accommodate such wide diversity.
Furthermore, it is evident that many more ERVs are yet to
be discovered as retroviral elements are present in most, if
not all, vertebrates and even in some invertebrates [6,7].
With a single exception (HERV-K) all HERV groups are
ancient (i.e. entered the genome prior to human speciation) and entered our genome at least 25 million years
ago [6,8,9] presumably as an infection of the germ-line.
Alternatively, it is possible that ERVs have evolved from
pre-existing genomic elements such as LTR-retrotransposons [10]. After colonization most HERV groups have
spread within the genome either by re-infection or intracellular transposition [11,12] and have reached copy numbers ranging from a few to several hundreds [13]. The vast
majority of these provirus copies are non-functional due
to the accumulation of debilitating mutations. Indeed, no
replication-competent HERVs have yet been described,
although fully intact members of the HERV-K group have
been reported [14]. Other mammalian species such as
mouse, cat and pig harbor modern replication-competent
ERVs that to a large extent may interact with related exogenous viruses [15,16].
The presence of endogenous retroviral sequences in our
genome has several possible implications: i) replication
and (random) insertion of new proviral structures, ii)
effect on adjacent cellular genes, iii) long range genomic
effects and iv) expression of viral proteins (or RNA). Since
the majority of HERVs are highly defective no de novo
insertions have been observed and presumably HERV
mobilization very rarely results in spontaneous genetic
disorders or gene knock-outs as seen with other active retrotransposons such as L1 elements [17]. However, existing HERV loci have been shown to alter gene expression
by providing alternative transcription initiation, new
splice sites or premature polyadenylation sites [18]. Moreover, the presence of enhancers and hormone-responsive
elements in the LTR structure of existing HERVs may upor down-regulate the transcription of flanking cellular
genes. It has been speculated that transcription initiation
from HERVs/solo-LTRs into neighboring genes in the antisense orientation might interfere with gene expression.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/32

Alternatively, gene transcripts encompassing antisense
viral sequences could down-regulate HERV expression.
The human C4 gene may provide an example of the latter,
where antisense HERV-K sequences are generated and display an effect on a heterologous target [19]. Such effects
may possibly rely on formation of dsRNA and RNA interference. On a genome scale the presence of closely related
sequences may trigger events of ectopic recombination
and hence lead to chromosomal rearrangements.
Sequence analysis of provirus flanking-DNA suggests that
this has occurred during primate evolution [20]. The frequency and significance of such events in human disorders are not clear at present. Finally, HERVs may express
viral proteins. The common retroviral genes, gag, (pro), pol
and env lead to expression of 3 viral polyproteins (Gag,
Gag-Pol and Env) that are processed by a viral or host protease into the active structural and enzymatic subunits.
Although most HERV genes are no longer intact, a small
fraction has escaped mutational decay. For a subgroup of
HERV-K (HDTV) all proteins can apparently be expressed
and particle formation has been detected in teratocarcinoma cell lines [13]. Furthermore, HERV-K (HDTV) also
directs expression of a small accessory protein Rec (formerly cORF) that up-regulates nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of unspliced viral RNA [21,22]. Loci from other
HERV groups have maintained a single intact open reading frame, such as the env genes from HERV-H [23],
HERV-W [24] and HERV-R (ERV3) [25]. Conservation of
an open reading frame during primate evolution clearly
suggests some biological function. Animal studies have
demonstrated that ERV proteins may in fact serve a useful
role for the host either by preventing new retroviral infection or by adopting a physiological role. Syncytin, an Envderived protein that mediates cell-cell fusion during
human placenta formation, provides a striking example of
the latter [26,27]. Recently, a second Env protein, dubbed
Syncytin 2, proposed to have a similar cell-fusion role [28]
was identified. Env proteins may also inhibit cell entry of
related exogenous retroviruses that use a common surface
receptor, and a Gag-derived protein restricts incoming retroviruses in mice [29].
In the literature, expression of HERVs has frequently been
linked with human disease including various cancers and
a number of autoimmune disorders [30]. While causal
links between disease and HERV activity have yet to be
established, it is clear from animal models that expression
of endogenous retroviral proteins can affect cell proliferation and invoke or modulate immune responses. A few
recent examples include i) the possible association of Rec
(HERV-K) with germ-cell tumors [31], ii) the immunosuppressive abilities of HERV-H Env in a murine cancer
model resulting in disturbed tumor clearance [32] and iii)
the possible superantigenic (SAg) properties of envelopes
from HERV-K and HERV-W [33,34] and the increased

activity of such proviruses in multiple sclerosis [34], rheumatoid arthritis [35], schizophrenia [36] and type-1 diabetes [33]. SAg expression from the HERV-K18 locus may
furthermore be induced by INF-α and thus viral infection
such as Epstein-Barr virus [37,38]. One major problem in
verifying putative disease association is the multi-copy
nature of HERVs and the ambiguous assignment to individual provirus; a problem that can be solved by properly
annotating the human genome.
Among Env-associated effects the mechanism of SAg-like
activity is believed to involve true epitope-independent
stimulation of T-cells, while the mechanism of action of
the immunosuppressive CKS-17-like domain is still
unknown. This immunosuppressive peptide region maps
to the envelope gene [39] and may significantly alter the
pathogenic properties of retrovirus and even enhance cancer development. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that a
CKS17-like motif arose early in the evolution of retrovirus
and is widespread in many current HERV lineages [3],
thus identification of novel envelope genes attracts particular attention.
Computer-assisted identification of HERV loci has previously been reported. These include searching conserved
amino-acid motifs within the pol gene [2,40] and env gene
[3], detection of full-length env genes by nucleotide similarity [41] and compiling of LTR- or ERV-classified repeats
as reported by RepeatMasker analysis [4,5,42]. Currently
only Paces et al. [5,42] provide a searchable database
where individual loci are mapped as chromosomal coordinates [43]. However, except for detection of 16 fulllength env genes in a recent survey by de Parseval et al [41]
and a detailed analysis of intactness of HERV-H- related
proviruses [40], no one has systematically detected HERV
regions and scanned them for content of viral open reading frames. In this paper we report mapping of 7836
regions in the human genome that show sequence resemblance to known retroviral genomes which cover the
majority of large proviral structures or HERV loci, and,
importantly, provide a detailed annotation of all viral
open reading frames.

Results
In order to screen the human genome for HERV-related
sequences we have performed multiple nucleotide BLAST
searches and subsequently clustered neighboring hits into
larger regions up to about 10 kb in size (Figure 1A/1B).
The query sequences cover all known retroviral genera
and include both endogenous and exogenous strains from
various host organisms. To avoid detection of solo-LTR
structures we used the coding regions as query (Figure
1A). The corresponding DNA sequences were scanned for
the presence of all viral open reading frames (vORFs, here
defined as a stop codon to stop codon fragment above 62

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/32

codons) with significant homology to known retroviral
proteins (E<0.0005) and annotated as Gag, Pol or Env.
From our initial BLAST-identified regions we detect 7836
genuine HERV-related regions in which at least one,
mostly several vORF can be detected. The majority of
these HERV regions correspond quite well to the internal
parts of a provirus locus. However, the insertion of other
repetitive elements inside a provirus will produce a
mosaic structure that is less well-defined. In terms of our
HERV regions this may lead to either "partition" of a provirus into two or more consecutive HERV regions (as illustrated by the "provirus into provirus" insertion depicted
in Figure 1B) or enclosure of minor stretches of non-retroviral DNA (such as Alu elements or small microsatellites)
within the sequences of some HERV regions. Hence, the
precise boundaries of the retrovirus-related DNA (as often
defined by nucleotide similarity alone) must be manually
inspected and the flanking LTRs must be identified in
order to deduce the exact proviral structure. To assist in
LTR determination we have scanned for flanking direct
repeats and included LTR elements as identified by
RepeatMasker analysis [4]. Due to these exceptions we
shall refer to our data as "HERV regions" although they in
most cases correspond to individual HERV loci.
The average region size is 4300 nucleotides and the ~7800
HERV regions cover ~1.1% of the human genome. All
data are publicly available as a searchable database at
http://www.retrosearch.dk Our data include i) chromosomal coordinates and sequence information of the 7836
HERV regions, ii) annotation of ~38000 retroviral ORFs
within these regions and iii) graphical visualization of
individual HERV regions (Figure 1C) or larger chromosomal window. All DNA and predicted vORF sequences
can be retrieved and is linked to external genome browsers
for further analysis.
Skewed chromosomal distribution and few intragenic
HERVs
The 7836 HERV regions (~2.7 per Mb) are not uniformly
distributed among the 22+2 chromosomes (χ2 test, P~0).
Table 1 summarizes the genome distribution statistics,
from which it is clear that chromosomes 2, 7, 9, 10, 15,
16, 17, 20 and 22 are less densely populated, while chromosomes 4, 19, X and Y have higher density than
expected from a random distribution. In particular, the Y
chromosome stands out with more than 14 HERVs per
Mb. The distribution of HERVs per Mb along each of the
chromosomes is also not uniform, perhaps except at chromosome 21 (Table 1). Furthermore, we observe local
"hotspots", most prominent for chromosomes 19, X and
Y. For instance, a 5 Mb window in chromosome Y (position 18–23 Mb) encompasses 120 HERV regions. Moreover, there are a number of cases where HERVs have
presumably been inserted right next to or even into an

existing locus. HERV ID 5715 provides a nice example of
the latter, where a HERV-K member presumably has integrated into an existing HERV-K (Figure 1B). We also detect
the perfect HERV-K tandem repeat previously reported
[44]. However, in contrast to Reus et al. [44] we find a single in-frame stop codon within both gag genes (HERV ID
26658–9. W). We also find other examples of closely situated HERV loci as for instance HERV ID 44313 that is
composed of two proviruses of distinct origin (HERV-K
and a γ-retrovirus-like sequence) both severely
degenerated.
The number of HERV regions that are located within
(non-HERV) genes are significantly reduced as compared
to a random distribution (χ2 test, P < 10-300), and only
13% of our 7836 HERV regions are situated inside a gene,
despite that 33% of the genome is spanned by genes (Figure 2). In total 813 genes (see Additional file 1) carry one
or more HERV regions within their predicted boundaries
and as such provide a valuable set of genes that may show
altered expression due to the presence of internally

located proviruses. There is a strong bias (χ2 test, P < 1052) for intragenic HERVs to be orientated antisense relative
to the gene (Figure 2). HERV sequences located between
genes are equally distributed between the two strands, and
the orientation does not depend on the distance from the
gene (data not shown).
Limited number of intact viral open reading frames
Of the ~38000 retroviral ORFs 25% are classified as Gag,
7% as Pro, 55% as Pol and 13% as Env proteins. This correlates well with the expected size of the gag, pro, pol and
env genes, although Pol may be slightly overrepresented.
The far majority of the vORFs (stop to stop) are short
(Table 2) and presumably do not encode any functional
proteins, although a role in cellular processes cannot be
excluded. Long vORFs on the other hand may still retain
their original viral function. In total 42 HERV regions
encompass either a Gag or an Env ORF above 500 codons
or a Pol ORF above 700 codons (which approach the size
of intact viral proteins) and together they count 17 Gag,
13 Pol and 29 Env proteins (Table 2 and Figure 3). Only

two HERV-K related loci (HERV ID 13983 and 29013)
carry long reading frames for all viral genes. However,
none of them are completely intact. In fact, 41 of the
above 59 long vORFs, are all betaretroviral and stem from
the HERV-K group. Interestingly, 15 of the remaining 18
non-betaretroviral ORFs are envelope proteins (see below).
Our method only detects a single non-betaretroviral Gag
ORF above 500 codons (which is located in a gammaretroviral structure, HERV ID 44200–1), while two long Pol
ORFs are both present in full-length HERV-Fc and HERVH elements (HERV ID 1178 and 10816) that also harbour
intact env genes [41,45].

If one extends the search criteria and scans the human
genome for retroviral genes where a single mutation (one
nucleotide insertion, deletion or substitution) either
removes premature termination or restores the correct
reading frame, the number of long Gag, Pol and Env proteins increases two-fold to 27, 23 and 43, respectively (Figure 3).
Novel envelope genes identified
Our method detects 29 Env ORFs (stop to stop) above 500
codons (Table 3), which comprise a few seemingly intact
or almost-intact env genes in the human genome not
previously reported. One particularly interesting locus
(HERV ID 40701) shows similarity to a recently reported

full-length endogenous retrovirus from Zebrafish (Danio
rerio), dubbed ZFERV [46]. A phylogenetic analysis of the
Zebrafish ERV suggested that it is distinct from existing
retrovirus genera being most similar to gammaretroviruses
[46]. An analysis of a short Gag and Pol ORF upstream of
the Env gene (HERV ID 40701) confirms the relatedness
to gammaretroviruses (weak similarity to Feline leukemia
virus). Also, two loci (HERV ID 44200–1 and 44204–5)
harbor novel Env-like ORFs that C-terminally show homology to Env from HERV-W/syncytin-1 [26,27] and

HERV-RFD/syncytin-2 [28], while the N-terminal
sequences show no clear homology. The identified ORFs
are highly similar (96% aa identities) except for a small Cterminal truncation and both genes are located within a
narrow 40 kb region at chromosome 19 (Table 3). Interestingly, both these loci are positive in our EST mapping
analysis (see below). Furthermore, among the 29 Env
ORFs, five turned out to carry a specific 292 bp deletion
(indicative for type 1 HERV-K-HML-2) that fuses the pol
and env reading frames. The same deletion is present in

the HERV-K18 Env locus that has been reported to have
SAg-like activity [37].
EST matching to HERV regions with long ORFs
We mapped 265 ESTs to one of the 42 HERV regions that
encode a long Gag, Pol or Env ORF (Figure 3). The EST
GenBank accession number, the matching HERV ID and
the source organ and tissue type are provided as supplementary material (see Additional file 2). Briefly, 20 of the
42 HERV regions were found to have matching ESTs suggesting transcriptional activity. For the long envelope
genes we have included the number of EST matches in
Table 3. Our analysis reveals that besides "activity" of
members of the HERV-K group, only HERV-Fc(2), HERVR (Erv3) and a few HERV-W/FRD members (including
Syncytin-1 and -2) have unambiguous EST matches. By
far, Syncytin-1, dominates with 100 EST matches, followed by Syncytin-2 and HERV-R. Syncytin-1 and Syncytin-2 were predominantly found in placental EST libraries
(see Additional file 2), which is also true for 5 of 17 HERVR ESTs. Interestingly, among the two (partial) HERV-W/
FRD-like env genes four of 6 ESTs are also derived from
placental tissues.

Discussion
We report a mapping of 7836 loci in the human genome
that show nucleotide sequence similarity to retroviral
genomes and importantly, we provide a detailed analysis
of their coding potential by annotation of all viral ORFs
(stop-codon to stop-codon fragments longer than 62).
This compilation of HERV regions and their corresponding viral ORFs is available as a searchable database [47]. A
graphical example is provided in Figure 1C. In total our
HERV regions (which exclude flanking LTRs) amount to
1.1 % of the human genome, a number that agrees well
with previous reports [1,42].
The vast majority of the mapped HERV regions contain
several frame-shift mutations or in-frame stop codons that
truncate the viral ORFs and thus testify to their old association with the human genome. In fact, we detect only 42
proviruses that have retained Gag, Pol or Env ORFs in the
size range that approach full-length proteins (Figure 3 and
Table 2). As expected the majority are part of the evolutionary young HERV-K (HML-2) group. Neither of these
HERV-K loci are completely intact, although one potential
replication-competent locus (HERV-K113, polymorphic
for humans and not present in the NCBI34 genome) has
been reported [14]. Alternatively, complementation
among HERV-K loci may open up for infectious particle
formation, and clearly defines interesting candidates to
investigate experimentally. Moreover, assuming a high
error-rate during transcription or retrotransposition, one
cannot exclude that almost-intact loci may occasionally
revert to their original functional state and become repli-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/32

cation-competent. Based on our data about 34 gag, pol or
env genes can be restored by a single point mutation or a
single insertion-deletion event.
Within our list of intact or almost-intact viral ORFs in the
human genome, we detect only a single gag gene and two
pol genes that are not from the HERV-K group. However,
among the 29 long envelope genes 15 are gammaretroviral
(Table 3). The fragmented, pseudogene nature of the gag
and pol genes (small ORFs) in several of these provirus loci
strongly suggests that selection has preserved the env
genes. In case of syncytin-1 and -2 (HERV-W and HERVFRD members, respectively) evolutionary conservation
can be understood in functional terms, since the encoded
envelope proteins have been suggested to play an essential
role in placental development by causing trophoblast syncytia formation [28,48]. Compelling evolutionary evidence for purifying selection in these genes has recently
been gathered to support this hypothesis [28,49,50].
Concerning other ancient loci such as HERV-R (erv3) no
evidence for a physiological role has yet been established
despite a remarkable conservation and expression of the
env gene. Potential cellular roles for envelope genes that
may drive purifying selection include i) protection from
infection by related retroviruses by receptor interference
as demonstrated for the murine fv4 locus [51], ii) mediator of organized cell-cell fusion like the syncytin genes [2628] and iii) a hypothesized role in preventing the immune
response against the developing embryo by means of the
immunosuppressive domain [52].
Two seemingly intact env genes not detected in the recent
survey of intact human envelope genes [41] are equally
interesting in terms of possible functional conservation.
One is located on chromosome 14q32.12 and this novel
gene shows low but significant similarity to a recently
reported endogenous retrovirus from Zebrafish (ZFERV
[46]). BLAST analysis of the protein coding regions suggests that this HERV group belong to the gammaretroviral
genera. Whether this gene is still active or whether the
encoded protein still maintains function and/or plays a
cellular role is yet to be established. Although we were
unable to detect any unambiguous EST matches to this
gene (Table 3), RT-PCR analysis indicates low RNA abundance in a few human tissues including placenta (Kjeldbjerg AL, Aagaard L, Villesen P and Pedersen FS,
unpublished). A second seemingly intact novel env gene is
found on chromosome 19q13.41, and interestingly a Cterminal truncated "twin" gene is located just 40 kb away.
Both genes appear to be active as judged by EST data
(Table 3) mostly in placental tissue (see Additional file 2).
We have been able to confirm this by RT-PCR analysis
(unpublished), and ongoing expression analysis aims at
clarifying the activity and function of these novel genes.

Among the long betaretroviral env genes five turned out to
carry a specific 292 bp deletion that fuses the pol and env
reading frames. This deletion variant of the HERV-K
(HML-2) group is indicative of the type 1 genomes [53]
that despite the lack of functional proteins have been
mobilized quite efficiently. Alternatively, recombination
or gene conversion may have conserved this HERV-K
deletion variant [11,54]. It is noteworthy that the Env protein from one of these Ä292-genes, HERV-K18, is reported
to have SAg-like activity [37], and a similar function of the
other four K18 SAg-like genes is an open question.
Although our analysis is extensive it is most likely not
exhaustive. The sensitivity is obviously limited by our
query sequences, and some ancient HERVs may have suffered from the mutational decay to a degree which makes
is impossible to detect them by homology. For instance,
the ZFERV-related env gene reported by us was only
detected due to inclusion of the ZFERV sequence [46], and
although available data such as HERVd [43] also points to
this region it is reported as a number of incomplete
HERVs. Similarly, nucleotide based searches (as RepeatMasker and BLAST detection) only partially detect the
novel HERV-W/RFD-like envelope genes and the intact
envelope genes among HERV-Fc family even though these
proviruses are fairly intact as suggested by a recent mobilization of HERV-Fc in the primate lineage [45]. Thus,
inclusion of more retroviral query sequences as our vORF
validated HERV data may likely improve detection methods in an iterative manner ("phylogenetic walking") as
previously applied by Tristem [2]. Finally, screening the
human genome in silico does not guarantee detection of
polymorphic HERV loci in which the empty pre-integration site is still segregating in the human population.
Indeed, an experimental survey has recently detected two
such polymorphic loci in the human population (HERVK113 and 115 [14]), and like HERV-K113 other recently
acquired proviruses may escape our attention.
In general, our analysis of the genomic positions of our
~7800 HERV regions revealed three distinct patterns,
which all confirm earlier reported results: i) there is an
unequal distribution of HERVs between chromosomes
and along the genome. In particular the Y chromosome
stands out with a five-fold excess of our vORF positive
(internal) HERV sequences (Table 1), and it has thus been
dubbed "a chromosomal graveyard" [55]. This agrees well
with previous genome surveys of LTR/ERV-related elements and the phenomenon may likely be associated with
the high level of heterochromatin and low levels of
recombination [55-58]. ii) HERVs are underrepresented
within genes and iii) HERVs found in introns are predominantly orientated in the antisense direction (Figure 2).
This pattern is well known [56,58] and expected due to
selection against gene disruption or interference by retro-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/1/1/32

viral regulatory elements such as promoters, splice sites
and polyadenylation signals. This selection may have
counteracted a preference for proviral integration (and
retrotransposition) near or inside genes as suggested by
recent studies for several retroviral genera [59,60].

Conclusion
Initially, HERV discovery was driven by the search for replication-competent viruses and their possible association
with human cancers as established in other species.
Recent research has demonstrated that the presence of
endogenous retroviral sequences in our genome has a
number of complex functional and evolutionary consequences and cannot simply be regarded as "junk" DNA.
The increased complexity and diversity of HERVs as testified by the identification of two novel env genes in this
survey make expression analysis and functional assessment a difficult task. To aid this process our genome-wide
HERV data as well as predictions of Gag, Pol and Env reading frames in these loci are a useful resource and our data
can be searched and visualized at http://www.retrose
arch.dk Clearly, the 42 HERVs encompassing intact or
near-intact gag, pol and env genes as described here are
interesting experimental objects, although less intact viral
proteins may also hold biological activity. In the near
future use of comparative genomics and mapping of allele
polymorphisms will most certainly enhance identification of endogenous retroviruses and reveal selection patterns that may eventually decipher a role for these genes
in human health and/or disease.

Methods
In order to identify HERV regions in the human genome
we performed BLAST searches using sensitive parameters.
BLAST hits were saved in a database and subsequently
clustered into putative HERV loci. These putative loci were
then scanned for viral Open Reading Frames (vORFs) and
the presence of flanking direct repeat sequences (putative
LTRs). Subsequently, ORFs were categorized based on a
library of known retroviral proteins and non-retroviral
proteins.
Identifying HERV regions
In order to cover as many different HERV families as possible we compiled a query set of 237 publicly available
sequences from Genbank, published papers and Repbase
sequences [4]. These sequences cover all known retroviral
genera and include both endogenous and exogenous
strains from various host organisms (the query set is available upon request). Each query sequence was manually
edited, removing LTR elements in order to avoid detection
of solo LTRs. BLAST searches against contigs from the
NCBI release 34 of the human genome were performed
using WU-BLAST (Gish, W. (1996–2003) http://
blast.wustl.edu), with default parameters except for W = 8,

Retrovirology 2004, 1:32

E = 0.001, V = 1000000, B = 1000000. Search results were
stored in a MySql database and mapped to chromosomal
positions using Ensembl Bioperl packages [61].
Overlapping BLAST hits were clustered into putative
HERV regions allowing a gap of 500 nucleotides between
hits. A region-score was calculated based on the sum of evalue weighted hitlengths divided by region length. Only
regions longer than 300 nucleotides and a region-score >
3.0 (threshold based on empirical tests) were kept, resulting in 45658 putative HERV region.
Detection of direct flanking repeats (putative LTRs) were
done by comparing a window before and after the HERV
region.
ORF finding and categorization
For the 45658 putative HERV loci, we scanned the DNA
sequence (including 1000 bases flanking the locus) for
forward open reading frames (stop-codon to stop-codon)
of lengths > 62 aminoacids (aa). Stop-codon-to-stopcodon fragments were chosen to accommodate the use of
non-conventional translational initiation by retroviruses
at the internal pro and pol genes (by means of ribosomal
frame-shifting and terminations suppression). Therefore
the predicted proteins in particular for gag and env genes
may contain incorrect N-terminal regions that must be
removed by looking for appropriate start codons. ORF
lengths below 63 aa were discarded as the probability of
finding ORFs less than 63 aa in a random sequence
increases to more than 0.05 (assuming equal codon
frequencies).

All ORFs were then assigned to a category by FASTA
searching against a library of known retroviral proteins
(RV) and known non-retroviral proteins (NON_RV). RV
proteins were downloaded from NCBI and categorized
into either GAG, POL, PRO, ENV, ACC (accessory protein) or UNWANTED (for unwanted or unknown proteins). NON_RV proteins consists of all human SwissProt
proteins of length 400–700 aa not including the words
"endogenous, virus, envelope, env-, env, gag-, gag, pol-,
pol, reverse". The final library consisted of 6260 records
(3454 RV proteins + 2806 NON_RV proteins). ORF was
assigned to the same category as the highest scoring hit.
All loci with a significant RV ORF (vORF) were flagged as
HERVs (E < 0.0005) – this data set consists of 7836 loci.
Manual inspection of long ORF above 400 codons
revealed that two envelope ORFs (ORF ID 86185 and
312172) were (mis)categorized as non-significant (NonS)
due to low sequence similarity to our retroviral protein
library.

EST matching to individual proviruses
In order to match the human ESTs to the vORF positive
HERV regions we first performed an all against all search
using NCBI MegaBLAST [62]. The output was filtered so
that only the best matching pairs (HERV-EST) were kept
and put into a database. The ESTs that matched the HERV
regions encompassing a long ORF were subsequently
assigned to a human genomic region using EST mapping
data from UCSC Genome Browser [63]. ESTs that unambiguously mapped to the same genomic region as the
HERV regions of interest were counted as positive EST
matches.
