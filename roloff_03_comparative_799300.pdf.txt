Abstract
Background: Methylation at CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA is a fundamental epigenetic
mechanism of gene expression control in vertebrates. Proteins with a methyl-CpG-binding domain
(MBD) can bind to single methylated CpGs and most of them are involved in transcription control.
So far, five vertebrate MBD proteins have been described as MBD family members: MBD1, MBD2,
MBD3, MBD4 and MECP2.
Results: We performed database searches for new proteins containing an MBD and identified six
amino acid sequences which are different from the previously described ones. Here we present a
comparison of their MBD sequences, additional protein motifs and the expression of the encoding
genes. A calculated unrooted dendrogram indicates the existence of at least four different groups
of MBDs within these proteins. Two of these polypeptides, KIAA1461 and KIAA1887, were only
present as predicted amino acid sequences based on a partial human cDNA. We investigated their
expression by Northern blot analysis and found transcripts of ~8 kb and ~5 kb respectively, in all
eight normal tissues studied.
Conclusions: Eleven polypeptides with a MBD could be identified in mouse and man. The analysis
of protein domains suggests a role in transcriptional regulation for most of them. The knowledge
of additional existing MBD proteins and their expression pattern is important in the context of Rett
syndrome.

Background
Methylation at CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA is a
fundamental epigenetic mechanism of gene expression
control in vertebrates [1–3]. Strong evidence exists for a
correlation between DNA hypermethylation, hypoacetylation of histones, tightly packed chromatin, and
transcriptional repression. Effects of DNA methylation are
mediated through proteins which bind to symmetrically
methylated CpGs. Such proteins contain a specific domain, the methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) which
consists of ~70 residues in an α/β-sandwich fold built of
three to four β-twisted sheets and a helix with a characteristic hairpin loop in the opposite layer [4–7]. Recently, a

transcriptional repressor protein, Kaiso, lacking an MBD,
has also been shown to bind to methylated CpG dinucleotides. This binding is mediated through zinc finger motifs [8,9]. Members of the MBD protein family are found
in different animal species. So far, five vertebrate MBD
proteins have been identified as members of the MBD
protein family: MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, MBD4 and MECP2
(for review, see: [6,10]). Except for MBD4, all of them are
associated with histone deacetylases (HDAC), and a transcriptional repression mechanism mediated by the recruitment of HDACs has been shown for MECP2, MBD1
and MBD2 [11–13].

MBDs. Columns are colored by conservation and property [50]. Residue conservation above each column indicates: "*" completely conserved; ":" favored substitutions; "." weakly favored substitutions. A quality graph is depicted below the alignment.

One of these five MBD proteins, MECP2, is implicated in
a human neurological disorder called Rett syndrome
[14,15]. Symptoms of this syndrome are mental retardation, loss of speech and purposeful hand use, autism, ataxia, and stereotypic hand movements. The similar
phenotype of conditional Mecp2 knockout mice and in vitro studies of functional consequences of MECP2 mutations indicate that the disorder is due to a loss of MECP2
function in the nervous system [16–21]. It remains unknown, why these patients present with a neurological
phenotype, although MECP2 is ubiquitously expressed. It
has been proposed that MECP2 is complemented by other
MBD proteins in non-neural tissues and this hypothesis
was tested for MBD2 by crossing Mecp2 knockout mice
with Mbd2 knockout mice [19]. However, no evidence for
functional redundancy of these two genes could be found
in this way.
Here we report two new polypeptide sequences with an
MBD as well as four MBD proteins in man and mouse that
had not been mentioned as MBD protein family members
up to date. Analysis of their amino acid sequence revealed
additional domains associated with chromatin and point
to a function in transcription control.

Results and Discussion
Human MBD proteins
We used a bioinformatics approach with the MBD of human MECP2 as query sequence to search for new members of the MBD protein family. Initial standard BLAST
searches of the NCBI, Celera and SwissProt databases resulted only in five MBD proteins (MECP2, MBD1, MBD2,
MBD3 and MBD4) which had previously been described
and studied intensively. However the search of protein

domain family databases (NCBI, Pfam, Smart and
Prosite) revealed similarities to the MBD of MECP2 for
four additional proteins, i.e. BAZ2A/TIP5, BAZ2B, CLLD8
and SETDB1 and for two cDNAs, KIAA1461 and
KIAA1887. These databases use Hidden Markov Models
(HMM) to detect motifs in amino acid sequences. An
MBD has been described in CLLD8, SETDB1 and BAZ2A/
TIP5 so far [22–24].
Nine of the eleven MBD-containing protein sequences
could also be detected by screening the Sequence Similarity DataBase (SSDB) [25] at GenomeNet. The cDNAs for
KIAA1461 and KIAA1887 were not found in the KEGG database that underlies the SSDB. These results are summarized in Tab 1. MBD amino acid sequences of the five
previously published and the six newly described human
polypeptides were aligned (Fig. 1). A sequence logo derived from the alignment of all eleven sequences is shown
in Fig. 2. These analyses implicate a small number of highly conserved and apparently essential amino acids within
the domain. At three positions identical amino acids are
present and five positions with conservative substitutions
can be found.
A phylogenetic tree of the MBD amino acid sequences of
all eleven polypeptides is shown in Fig. 3. Four major
MBD subsets are indicated there. The MBDs of the originally described proteins (MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, MBD4
and MECP2) are found as one group besides a second
(BAZ2A/TIP5, BAZ2B) and third subset (CLLL8 and
SETDB1) which are joined by a very short branch.
KIAA1461 and KIAA1887 appear in a fourth branch.
MBDs of the original five proteins are more similar to
each other than to the novel ones, which explains why

The MBD of MECP2, MBD1, MBD2, MBD4 and BAZ2A/
TIP5 mediates binding to DNA, in case of MECP2, MBD1
and MBD2 preferentially to methylated CpG [13,24,26–
28]. MBD4 has a special role acting as a DNA repair enzyme that reverses spontaneous CpG to TpG base exchanges, thereby maintaining methylated CpG motifs. It
binds preferably to m5CpG/GpT mismatches [29,30].
In case of human MBD3 and SETDB1 the MBD has been
shown to mediate protein-protein interactions [23,31].
Xenopus MBD3 is exceptional in its binding to methylated
CpG which can be explained by the difference of an amino acid residue within the MBD (Lys30) important for
DNA binding [31]. It remains to be determined whether
the MBDs of BAZ2B, CLLD8, KIAA1461 and KIAA1887
mediate DNA binding or protein-protein interactions. Additional domains found in seven of the eleven polypeptides indicate that they are associated with chromatin and
function in epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation.
Some of the proteins are already known to be involved in
transcriptional repression, and the domains of the remainder strongly suggest a comparable function.
MECP2 recruits the Sin3A co-repressor complex and
MBD2 the NuRD co-repressor complex, which itself contains MBD3. Both complexes contain HDACs, and MBD1
is also associated with HDAC activity although the identity of the deacetylase remains unknown [13]. Within the
C-terminal part of MECP2, a histidine and proline-rich region is present which is conserved in certain neural-specific transcription factors [32].
BAZ2A/TIP5 is part of the NoRC, nucleolar remodeling
complex, which represses rDNA transcription by recruiting histone methyltransferases, HDACs and DNA methyltransferases [33].
BAZ2B has a domain structure similar to BAZ2A/TIP5,
both contain a DDT (DNA binding homeobox and Different Transcription factors) and a tandem PHD-bromodomain. The PHD domain is a C4HC3 zinc-finger-like motif
and the bromodomain consists of 110 amino acids and is
found in many chromatin-associated proteins that can
interact specifically with acetylated lysine. Tandem PHDbromodomains have been found in several transcriptional co-repressors [34]. The DDT domain is exclusively associated with nuclear domains in other proteins and was
found in different transcription and chromatin remodeling factors [35]. An AT_hook motif (which allows binding to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA regions) was
found in BAZ2A/TIP5 but not in BAZ2B.
SETDB1 is a H3-K9 histone methyltransferase [23], its
mouse homologue, ESET, has furthermore been shown to
interact with the mSin3A/B co-repressor complex [36].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/4/1

The SET domain is a signature motif for lysine-specific histone methyltransferases [37,38]. This domain is also
present in CLLD8 to which no function has yet been
assigned.
The predicted protein sequence of KIAA1461 harbors a
PWWP motif [39] named after the conserved amino acids
Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro. It was first described in the WHSC1 protein, encoded by a gene within the Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome critical region. The PWWP domain of Dnmt3b, a
DNA methyltransferase, has been recently shown to bind
to DNA. A common feature of PWWP containing proteins
is the presence of additional domains known to be associated with chromatin [40]. Furthermore KIAA1461 has
been shown to interact with the KIAA1549 protein in a
yeast-two-hybrid experiment (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/
huge/ppi). This interaction partner has not been studied
in detail so far, but contains a serine-rich stretch as well as
a helix-turn-helix motif (PS00622, LuxR family) according to Prosite (http://www.expasy.org/prosite). Helixturn-helix motifs can be found in many transcription regulation proteins.
In the predicted protein sequence of KIAA1887, only a
proline-rich extension (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro)
but no protein motif as such could be found.
The co-existence of MBDs and domains involved in chromatin modification, present in many of the identified
polypeptides, could also point to a connection between
the latter mechanism and methylated DNA. Interestingly,
a very recent study [41] has shown that Mecp2 is associated with a H3-K9 methyltransferase activity, indicating a
link between DNA methylation and histone methylation.
MBD proteins in other species
In the mouse, homologues were found for all human
MBD proteins. Sequence identity scores range from 63.8%
to 94.0% (Tab. 2) indicating a conserved function in both
species. Human and mouse MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, MBD4
and MECP2 are curated orthologues [27,42–44].

Homology searches in the ENSEMBL database revealed
the following murine homologues of BAZ2B, CLLD8,
KIAA1461 protein and KIAA1887 protein. The mouse
homologue of BAZ2B, the ENSEMBL protein
ENSMUSP00000028367 (gene ENSMUSG00000026987)
shows a 82.6 % amino acid sequence identity. The predicted mouse gene ENSMUSG00000021980 coding for
ENSEMBL protein ENSMUSP00000022552 has a 65.2 %
amino acid sequence identity to the human CLLD8. We

gene sequence ENSMUSG00000025409 (ENSEMBL protein ENSMUSP00000026476) with 91.1 % sequence
identity was present in the database. The latter database
entry however consists of only 101 amino acids. The
existence of translated proteins remains to be determined
for all four mouse genes.
DNA methylation as a mechanism of gene expression regulation exists also in plants. In our database searches we
detected plant MBD proteins as well. The Pfam database
contains polypeptides from Arabidopsis thaliana and Triticum aestivum. BLAST analyses revealed additional proteins
in Zea Mays, Hordeum vulgare and Lycopersicon esculetum.
Entries for MBD containing proteins from plants over C.
elegans to mouse and human are present in Pfam.
Expression patterns of MBD genes
Expression analyses had been carried out previously for all
genes of the mouse/human MBD family except for
KIAA1461 and KIAA1887 (only the abundance of
KIAA1887 ESTs in different tissues has been reported
[45]). The results of published Northern blot experiments
are summarized in Tab. 3. Since expression levels of
MBD4 were too low to be detected by Northern blots,
only results of RT-PCR studies in three tissues are shown.
However the presence of MBD4 EST sequences from numerous tissues points to a ubiquitous expression (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene).

We performed Northern blot analyses for KIAA1461 and
KIAA1887. Strong signals of ~8 kb were detected for
KIAA1461 in skeletal muscle, heart, pancreas, kidney and
placenta. A faint band could be detected in brain, lung
and liver. For KIAA1887 a strong band of ~5 kb was
present in heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, placenta

and pancreas, weaker signals could be seen for brain and
lung tissue (Fig. 4).
Taken together, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3 and MECP2 as well
as SETDB1, CLLL8, BAZ2A, KIAA1461 and KIAA1887
show a broad tissue distribution. The expression of BAZ2B
is more restricted according to northern blot results [46].
It is of note that CLLL8, BAZ2A, KIAA1461 and KIAA1887
show a very low expression in brain.

Conclusions
In this study we present additional four proteins and two
cDNAs with a methyl-CpG-binding domain in mouse and
man. Transcripts of SETDB1, BAZ2A, CLLL8, KIAA1461
and KIAA1887 are found in all adult tissues studied.
Among the six proteins described here as new members of
the MBD protein family, CLLL8, BAZ2B, KIAA1461 and
KIAA1887 show a low expression in brain. MECP2 is
found preferentially in mature neurons of the brain
[47,48], and the cell types that express CLLD8, BAZ2A/
TIP5, SETDB1 as well as the predicted KIAA1461 and
KIAA1887 in brain are not known.
Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in MECP2. Even
though MECP2 is ubiquitously expressed, the phenotype
of the syndrome is restricted to the brain. This could be explained by a greater need of long lived, non-dividing neuronal cells for a special chromatin state that involves
MECP2 and tightly suppresses transcription of undesired
genes. Another explanation would be that the loss of function of MECP2 in non-neural tissues is compensated by
another protein with similar properties. MBD2 has been
studied in this respect, but no evidence for a genetic interaction of the two genes was found by combining Mbd2and Mecp2-null mice [19]. Based on gene expression studies of Mecp2 knockout mice and biochemical evidence, it

has been suggested that the essential function of Mecp2 in
the brain might not be transcriptional [49]. In view of this
aspect and the protein-protein interaction property of the
methyl-CpG-binding domain of human MBD3 and
SETDB1, functional compensation would not necessarily
require a DNA binding property.
Almost all presented polypeptides are known or predicted
to be involved in mechanisms of gene expression regulation. In order to understand the higher-order interplay of
MBD proteins and associated complexes, it will be a major
task to identify interacting proteins as well as regulated
targets of all components. This will help to solve the question whether some of the polypeptides can functionally
complement MECP2 in tissues other than the brain.
