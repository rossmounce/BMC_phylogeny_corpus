Abstract
Background: We describe the distribution of indels in the 44 Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
(ENCODE) regions (about 1% of the human genome) and evaluate the potential contributions of
small insertion and deletion polymorphisms (indels) to human genetic variation. We relate indels
to known genomic annotation features and measures of evolutionary constraint.
Results: Indel rates are observed to be reduced approximately 20-fold to 60-fold in exonic
regions, 5-fold to 10-fold in sequence that exhibits high evolutionary constraint in mammals, and
up to 2-fold in some classes of regulatory elements (for instance, formaldehyde assisted isolation
of regulatory elements [FAIRE] and hypersensitive sites). In addition, some noncoding transcription
and other chromatin mediated regulatory sites also have reduced indel rates. Overall indel rates
for these data are estimated to be smaller than single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates by a
factor of approximately 2, with both rates measured as base pairs per 100 kilobases to facilitate
comparison.
Conclusion: Indel rates exhibit a broadly similar distribution across genomic features compared
with SNP density rates, with a reduction in rates in coding transcription and evolutionarily
constrained sequence. However, unlike indels, SNP rates do not appear to be reduced in some
noncoding functional sequences, such as pseudo-exons, and FAIRE and hypersensitive sites. We
conclude that indel rates are greatly reduced in transcribed and evolutionarily constrained DNA,
and discuss why indel (but not SNP) rates appear to be constrained at some regulatory sites.

Background

Insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) have to date
received less attention in the study of sequence variation than

have single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), despite their
frequency (estimated at approximately 16% to 25% of all
sequence polymorphism events) and their potential

functional importance [1]. 5' Untranslated regions (UTRs)
and gene coding regions have previously been observed to
have lower indel rates compared with other regions, suggesting that the constraint may have arisen because of negative
selection [2]. In general, indels that give rise to frame shifts in
coding sequence are more disruptive than non frame-shifts
and single point mutations, because of third base degeneracy
[3]. As a result, coding sequence indels tend to have lengths
that are multiples of three, whereas regulatory sequences
tend to have more frequent indels that occur in distinct blocks
[4]. The majority of indels are di-allelic and small, with allele
length differences of relatively few (one to four) nucleotides
[2,5,6]. Given their frequency, small indels could play an
important role in contributing to phenotypic differences in
humans, including susceptibility to diseases. It is therefore of
interest to characterize indel distribution across the human
genome, and to integrate indels into SNP marker maps in
order to aid in the identification of natural genetic variation.
Recent theoretical work has considered the distribution of
indels under neutrality and exploited the evolutionary
imprint of sequence indels in order to pinpoint functional
DNA regions that are subject to purifying selection [7]. Snir
and Pachter [8] used Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
(ENCODE) data and multiple primate sequences to study
indel events between species. This work suggests that indel
rates genome wide are not uniform and that indel events are
not neutral; in particular, the work has identified indel
hotspots in the human genome. A minority of insertions and
deletions may also have plausibly played a major role in speciation events, including human-chimpanzee phenotypic differences [9,10]. An investigation of 2,000 human di-allelic
indels found that the majority were monomorphic in chimpanzees and gorillas, indicating that most indels have arisen
after the most recent common primate ancestor [6] and are
lineage specific [5].
We used the small insertion and deletion ENCODE data [11]
to address four questions. First, do the 14 manually selected
regions have lower insertion and deletion rates compared
with the 30 randomly selected regions? This might be
expected to be the case if the selection process [12] for the
manually selected ENCODE regions of interest were biased
toward regions with greater density of genes or genes of evolutionary importance, with greater functional and evolutionary constraints. Second, do indel rates vary by genomic
annotation feature (in turn reflecting varying levels of functional constraint)? Indels that arise in coding sequence are
more likely to be deleterious and therefore subject to purifying selection. As a result, DNA sequences that encode proteins might be expected to have some of the lowest genomic
indel rates, followed by a wide variety of functional features
that are believed to regulate gene expression via an increasing
number of previously unrecognized mechanisms [13-17].

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R180

Third, are indel rates negatively correlated with measures of
evolutionary constraint? We expect indel rates to be negatively associated with evolutionary constraint scores (see
Materials and methods, below) where DNA sequences are
subject to purifying selection. To address this question, we
also correlated indel rates with ancestral repeat (AR)
sequence. AR sequences are mobile elements that inserted
before the common ancestor of most mammals and have subsequently become inactive [18]. ARs are considered to be predominantly neutral sequences (not subject to purifying
selection) and hence we would anticipate indels to accumulate in AR sequence regions with relatively little or no constraint. Based on the assumption that new indels have arisen
in AR regions in the past at the same rate as elsewhere in the
genome, observed indel rates might be expected to be positively correlated with AR sequence rates.
The fourth question we consider is how do ENCODE indel
rates compare with SNP rates across genomic features and
evolutionary constrained sequence?
Here we describe the distribution of small indels (ranging
from 1 to 20 base pairs [bp]) in the manually and randomly
selected ENCODE regions, their distribution in relation to
genomic annotation features, and their relationship with
measures of evolutionary constraint.

Results

All identified small indels (n = 4486) in the ENCODE regions
were mapped onto physical coordinates for ENCODE functional features. The average indel length of identified small
indels is 2.8 bp, ranging from 1 to 20 bp. The overall density
is on average 15 indels per 100 kilobases (kb; 99% confidence
interval [CI] 13.4 to 16.7) or, in terms of total indel length,
43.4 bp per 100 kb (99% CI 38.3 to 49.1). All results in Tables
1 to 3 are presented in two ways: as numbers of indel events
(indels per 100 kb) and total indel length (indel bp per 100
kb). In the interests of brevity, indel rates are referred to in
the text to as indel bp per 100 kb unless stated otherwise. This
also facilitates comparison with SNP rates.
There are no substantial differences in indel or gene density
between manually and randomly selected regions (Table 1).
The indel rates in manual regions are similarly variable
(sdnum/100 kb = 5.0 number of indels per 100 kb; sdbp/100 kb =
14.7 indel bp per 100 kb, where sdnum/100 kb and sdbp/100 kb refer
to the standard deviation for number of indels and indel bp
per 100 kb, respectively) to those in random regions (sdnum/
100 kb = 4.0; sdbp/100 kb = 14.0), with no significant differences
in the summary data (F[13,29] = 1.52, P = 0.34).
We observed a reduction in indel rates for coding sequence
and annotation features that are believed to play a regulatory
role in gene expression (Table 2). Compared with the overall
mean (43.4 bp per 100 kb), ENCODE coding sequences all

reduced indel rates. DHS are short regions of DNA that are
relatively easily cleaved by DNAse I.
Acetylated histones are usually associated with transcriptionally active chromatin and deacetylated histones with inactive
chromatin. Hence, histone modified regions often signify regulatory sites. Selected histone modifications and binding sites
for RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factor
TAF250 were assayed for the ENCODE regions (see ENCODE

Project Consortium [19] and Table 4 for details). These sites
show modestly reduced indel rates (HisPolTAF: 32.4 bp per

previously unrecognized UTRs

TARs/transfrags

Transcriptionally active regions/transcribed fragments as determined
by analyses of cellular RNA (polyA or total) hybridizations to multiple

also showed unexpectedly reduced indel rates. Cell cycle replicating segments (MidRepSeg: 43.2 bp per 100 kb) show no
relationship with indel rates.
Figures 1 to 3 show the relationship between indel base pairs
per 100 kb and measures of mammalian evolutionary constraint, human-primate evolutionary constraint, and AR
rates, with each data point representing a summary score for
each ENCODE region. The Pearson correlation coefficients
relating to Figures 1 to 3 are statistically insignificant when all
of the ENCODE region summary data points are considered.
However, when outlying data points are identified and
excluded using standard regression diagnostics, the correlations are of marginal statistical significance. Indel rates are
(nonsignificantly) inversely correlated with mammalian MCS
score (Figure 1; r = -0.25, P = 0.11 with outlier ENCODE
region 10 excluded), and negatively associated with the primate genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) score and
GERP squared using multiple regression (Figure 2; multiple
correlation coefficient: R = 0.32, P = 0.04). Indel rates are
also observed to be marginally and negatively correlated with
AR rates and AR squared (Figure 3; multiple correlation coefficient: R = -0.30, P = 0.06 with regions 8 and 15 identified as
outliers).
AR rates (bp per 100 kb) are strongly inversely correlated
with MCS (Figure 4; r = -0.46, P < 0.002), but exhibit no relation with either human-primate or human-mammal GERP
scores (plots not shown; GERP primate: r = 0.02, P = 0.91;
GERP mammal: r = -0.03, P = 0.8). MCS and GERP con-

AR rates also exhibit a strong negative correlation with local
GC content (Figure 6; r = -0.55, P = 0.001). Indel rates show
an overall positive correlation with GC content for the
ENCODE regions (Figure 7), which illustrates that indel rates
may be confounded by local GC content. In order to check the
effect of GC content on indel rates, we recalculated the results
presented in Table 2 including GC content as a confounder.
For example, although indel events per 100 kb in AR
sequence is observed to be about 7.9 (99% CI 6.7 to 9.2; see
Table 2), the mean rates are about 4.7 (99% CI 3.5 to 6.4) and
about 10.4 (99% CI 8.6 to 12.4) for AR sequence with GC content above 50% and GC content below 50%, respectively.
However, the mean indel rates presented in Table 2 are not
significantly altered when adjusted for local GC content at
each annotational feature (data not presented).
Table 3 compares the distribution of indel and validated SNP
rates by experimental feature. In general, indel rates are
lower than SNP rates, with a ratio of validated SNPs to indel
event rates of 6.7 (102.4/15), or 2.4 (102.4/43.4) for validated
SNPs:indel bp. The pattern of indel rates across genomic fea-

tures is broadly similar to SNP density. For example, as a percentage of their respective overall means, the indel rates for
MCS evolutionary constraints of strict, moderate, and loose
are 10%, 26% and 61%, compared with 29%, 43% and 55% for
SNP rates. Similarly, the indel and SNP rates are reduced for
many transcribed sequences (CDS, TSS, and RACEfrags).
For some features, however, the pattern of constraint for
indel and SNP rates differ quite markedly (Table 3). Although
indel rates are constrained in chromatin mediated transcription regulatory sites (FAIRE: 23.8 bp per 100 kb; DHS: 19.7
to 27.0 bp per 100 kb), SNP rates are not constrained for these
features (FAIRE: 90 SNPs per 100 kb; DHS: 90 to 96 SNPs
per 100 kb) as compared with the overall mean (102.4 SNPs
per 100 kb).
Table 5 compares indel rates by functional annotation for
these data and the data presented by Bhangale and coworkers
[20]. The overall indel rates are very similar for indel events
(15 per 100 kb versus 13.8 per 100 kb for the data presented
by Bhangale and coworkers [20]) and indel bp (43.4 bp per
100 kb versus 39.4 bp per 100 kb). The indel rates presented
by Bhangale and coworkers [20] are also greatly reduced for
coding DNA but not pseudo-exons or UTR sequence. Open
chromatin indel rates are reduced in both datasets.

Discussion

This work represents the first systematic description of small
insertion/deletion human polymorphism data in relation to

Volume 8, Issue 9, Article R180

Clark et al. R180.9

functional and evolutionary annotation, which complements
larger scale structural variation data across the genome [2,2124]. In order to understand the potential contribution made
by indels to human genetic variation, we contrasted small
indel rate variation by type of ENCODE region (manual or
random selection), indel rates by functional annotation
features, and indel rates by evolutionary constraint scores
and neutral (AR) sequence; finally, we compared indel and
SNP rates and their relative pattern of distribution across
genomic features.
Overall, indel rates do not vary significantly between manual
and randomly selected regions, suggesting that the ENCODE
selection criteria for manual regions (the presence of well
studied genes and availability of substantial comparative
sequence) do not preclude similar genomic profiles for manual and random regions, with stratified randomly selected
regions designed to be representative of a broad range of the
genome [11].
Small indels are common and constitute approximately 15
insertions/deletions every 100 kb or, in terms of sequence
length, 43 bp per 100 kb of the genome. The number of validated common SNPs is observed to be about seven times the
number of small indels (indels per 100 kb) or twice the
observed indel bp rate (bp per 100 kb). Indel rates are greatly
reduced in regions associated with known functionality
(largely coding DNA) and under evolutionary constraint.
Compared with the overall mean, indel event rates are
reduced by factors of about 20 for exon coding regions, about
5 for strict MCS sequence, and about 2 for measures of chromatin mediated regulatory sites. These observations are
consistent with estimates from other studies [1,2,8]. The corresponding reduction in indel rates for these data compared
with bulk DNA and when measured as indel bp per 100 kb
rather than indel events, about 60 (CDS), about 10 (strict
MCS), and about 2 (FAIRE and DHS).
Approximately 5% of the ENCODE sequence is estimated to
be subject to moderate evolutionary constraint across mammalian species (Table 2), but only a minority of these constrained sequences are estimated to overlap with known
protein coding exons and their associated UTRs (about 40%).
The majority either overlap with known noncoding functional
features (20%) or are suspected to be associated with previously unrecognized (40%) noncoding transcription [25].
As expected, coding (CDS, TSS, and RACEfrags) and constrained sequence (MCS) show the most constrained indel
rates, followed by noncoding transcripts (transcriptionally
active regions/transcribed fragments) and regulatory features (FAIRE sites, DHS, and HisPolTaf). To the extent that
indels arise in functional sequence, in general indels appear
to be subject to purifying selection, with indel rates negatively
correlated with past evolutionary constraint across mammal

and primate sequences (MCS human-mammal and GERP
human-primate scores; Figures 1 and 2).
An apparent exception to the negative relationship between
indel rates and constraint score is the HOXA cluster

(ENCODE region 10), which runs counter to this trend. This
region simultaneously exhibits the highest evolutionary constraint in the comparison of mammalian sequence (MCS) and
the third highest indel rate for all the ENCODE regions (Figure 1). However, the HOXA cluster is in the centre of the

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R180

Genome Biology 2007,

region and is surrounded by gene deserts with limited evidence of evolutionary constraint. Hence, the explanation for
this potentially counterintuitive observation is probably that
the indel polymorphisms are largely confined to the gene
deserts, whereas the constrained sequence is confined to the
central portion of the HOXA cluster.
AR sequence rates are negatively correlated with mammalian
sequence constraint (MCS; Figure 5), which is expected
because AR sequence is neutral and not subject to natural
selection. However, AR is not associated with GERP humanprimate and GERP human-mammal scores (data not shown),
because AR sequence was defined and identified in relation to
broad mammalian sequence comparisons and not specifically
primate sequence.
Multi-species constrained scores for mammals (MCS modest)
and GERP for human-primate comparisons are strongly negatively correlated (Figure 6). The nonlinear relationship also
reflects the fact that relatively recent (human-primate)
sequence constraint comparisons fail to discriminate
between the shared, more highly conserved sequences, which
are only observed using broader phylogenetic comparisons.
Indel and SNP rates do not vary by the timing of DNA
sequence replication during S-phase (the synthesis of DNA in
preparation for mitosis) when classified as early, mid, and
late S-phase replication timing [19].
Based upon two assumptions, we anticipated AR sequence
rates to be positively correlated with indel rates across the
ENCODE regions. What we in fact observe is a negative correlation between AR and indel rates (Figure 3). This unexpected result initially suggests that one or both of the
assumptions may be false. The first assumption is that AR
sequence is effectively functionless (and therefore neutral
sequence), and the second is that indel mutations arise at the
same rate in AR sequence as elsewhere in the genome.
Although there is evidence that interspersed repeats in mammalian genomes may acquire functional roles as both proteincoding and transcriptional regulatory regions, only about 5%
of the total amount of nonexonic constrained sequence
(GERP) in the ENCODE regions is estimated to overlap with
AR sequence [26]. This indicates that most AR sequence is
still likely to be neutral and, for the most part, is unlikely to be
subject to selection. By contrast, a lack of uniform indel mutation rates across the genome is more plausible [8]. Just as
nucleotide point mutation rates [27] and segmental duplications [28] vary widely across the genome, it has been shown
that the rate (and perhaps mechanism) of indel generation
also varies widely across the genome [8].
Alternatively, the observed reduction in AR indel rates could
in part arise from confounding caused by local GC content or
experimental ascertainment bias. We observed AR rates to be
negatively correlated with GC content (Figure 6; r = -0.55, P

Volume 8, Issue 9, Article R180

Clark et al. R180.11

= 0.001) and ENCODE indel rates to be positively correlated
with GC content (Figure 7). The overall indel event rate when
adjusted for mean centered GC content remains unaltered, at
15 events per 100 kb (99% CI 13.4 to 16.7), whereas AR indel
rates are about 4.7 events (99% CI 3.5 to 6.4) and about 10.4
events (99% CI 8.6 - 12.4) for sequence with GC content above
50% and GC content below 50%, respectively. However,
although indel rates are associated with local GC content, the
latter only partly accounts for reduced AR indel rates, because
the indel rate for AR with reduced GC content (10.4 per 100
kb for sequence with <50% GC content) is still lower than
indel rates for bulk DNA (15 per 100 kb).
One final possibility for the observed indel rate reduction for
these data in AR regions, could also be an artefact of the data
generation process. Ascertainment bias could arise against
AR sequence with common indels because of the nature of
identifying ancestral repeats common to mammalian species.
Indels arising in AR sequence would reduce the alignment
score used to identify ancestral repeats, so that true AR containing indels would be less likely to be identified as AR. The
problem could be exacerbated if indel rates are elevated in
regions that have also experienced increased rates of indel
changes throughout mammalian evolution (which is likely to
be the case because lineage-specific rates of indel divergence
between mammals are strongly correlated with genomic
region). Both of these mechanisms would give rise to experimental artefact and apparent reduction in AR indel rates.
Some of the annotation features that show significantly
reduced indel rates in this analysis also show reduced levels of
nucleotide substitutions (for example, CDS, TSS, RACEfrags,
and MCS), indicating that selective constraint is acting to
both reduce SNP as well as indel density. However, other categories such as noncoding transcription sites (transcriptionally active regions/transcribed fragments, pseudo-exons) and
chromatin regulatory elements, as assessed by DHS (activated cis-regulatory elements in mammalian genomes) and
FAIRE sites, appear to show reduced indel rates, but not
reduced SNP density. This observation is consistent with
experimental data that show DNA regulation of nucleosome
stability to be diffuse, cumulative across base pairs, and
apparently on the scale of a single nucleosome, at about 200
bp [14]. In this context, indels may have important implications for understanding genome function and variation,
because chromatin composition plays a central role in regulating all DNA templated processes, including transcription,
recombination, repair, and replication.
There are two potential limitations of the present study. The
first relates to the completeness and accuracy of the indel and
genomic annotation data [19], ensuring which is a continuing
exercise for coding and noncoding transcript features [29].
Although the complete accuracy of annotations is essential to
the future success of genomic and complex trait research
[30], in this study we have deliberately taken a conservative

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R180

R180.12 Genome Biology 2007,

Clark et al.

statistical approach to investigating the distribution of indels
in relation to annotation features, in order to account for
inherent uncertainty, both in terms of biology and experimental measurement error. We also used independent data
from Bhangale and coworkers [20] to compare indel rates by
functional annotation and evolutionary constraint. Table 5
shows similar overall rates and reduction in indel rates for
coding sequence (CDS, TSS, and RACEfrags), but not for
pseudo-exons or UTRs. The data from Bhangale and coworkers also show reduced rates for open chromatin features
(FAIRE and hypersensitive sites).
The second potential limitation is that, for most of our analyses, we have used summary measures for each ENCODE
region, and it is likely that some effects of interest in small
sequences will therefore be overlooked. Nevertheless, relatively crude summary measures by region and annotation feature still reveal clear trends between indel rates and indirect
(experimental and computational) measures of functional
and evolutionary constraint. We assessed the robustness of
our results to various potential biases by conducting several
sensitivity analyses. For instance, some of the encode regions
(ENm010, ENm013, ENm014, ENr112, ENr113, ENr123,
ENr131, ENr213, ENr232, and ENr321) were genotyped more
intensively than others, but we found no evidence that these
regions yielded substantially different results in our analyses.
Indels are predominantly (58%) 1 bp in length, and we
repeated analyses with only those indels with lengths in
excess of 1 bp, and found that the trends in our analysis do not
substantially alter (data not shown). We also repeated the
analyses for insertions and deletions separately and reached
the same conclusions.

Conclusion

Small indels that arise in functional sequence are likely to be
subject to negative selection, as shown by the reduced indel
rates in transcribed DNA, evolutionarily constrained
sequence, and - to a lesser extent - regulatory elements.
Although reduced indel and SNP rates are both clearly related
to coding sequence constraints, constrained indel rates in
regulatory regions may reflect that indels are more likely than
SNPs to moderate the structural function of regulatory elements. Indels may play a more important role than SNPs in
contributing to natural genetic variation at regulatory sites,
and hence they could be an important source of variation in
gene expression levels.

Materials and methods

The ENCODE project aims to identify and catalog all functional elements, including coding sequences of genes and
noncoding DNA, in the human genome. A pilot study phase
considered 44 discrete regions that encompass 30 megabases, or about 1% of the human genome, with 14 of these
regions (about 15 megabases) selected manually and the

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R180

remainder randomly [11]. Small indels in the ENCODE
regions were called from shotgun re-sequencing reads and
traces of the SNP discovery efforts from both the SNP consortium and the HapMap (see the report from the ENCODE
Project Consortium [19] for details of discovery and validation procedures). The shotgun technology used identified
indels with a maximum length of 20 bp. Whole genome
sequence data were generated totalling onefold coverage of
the human genome from DNA derived from a pool of cell lines
from eight unrelated adult African Americans (four male and
four female) enrolled in Houston, Texas, USA [31]. The SSAHADIP software package, a modification of SSAHASNP [32],
was used to align these reads to build 35 of the human reference sequence, generating polymorphism calls, while keeping
track of the total bases aligned for each read. In brief, the
neighbourhood quality standard base alignment method was
adapted to identify indels by requiring the inserted/deleted
bases and the flanking five bases on either side of the indel to
exceed a minimum Phred quality score of 22. If these minima
were not met, then the indel was not reported.
For this study, indels and SNPs were called using the eight
Baylor samples in order to facilitate comparison. Only validated SNPs (those with heterozygosity scores) were used.
As part of the HapMap project [33], ten ENCODE regions had
in-depth SNP discovery by polymerase chain reaction resequencing on 48 individuals in four populations; this dataset
represents the deepest multi-megabase resequencing data
currently available and is about three times as dense as
phases I and II of the HapMap project. Experimental data,
sequence conservation, and feature definitions were obtained
from the three experimental groups of the ENCODE Consortium and the multiple sequence analysis group [19]. All data
used in our work are available at the ENCODE project at University of California, Santa Cruz [34] and are available from
the corresponding author. The full set of ENCODE indels can
be downloaded directly [35].
To evaluate the potential contributions of insertion and deletion events to functional variation, we calculated indel density
as a percentage of nucleotides for each ENCODE region and
classification feature. Genomic coordinates for features and
ENCODE regions were used to estimate two summary measures of indel density: the number of indels per 100 kb of the
region length or total feature, and the number of indel bp per
100 kb for the region length or total feature. The densities
were analyzed using a negative binomial model with the
number of indels or base pairs as the response, the lengths of
sequence as an offset, and data aggregated to the region level
[36]. This approach allowed us to calculate 99% confidence
intervals for indel and SNP densities, compensated for potential over-dispersion, and provided a conservative framework
for testing for differences between manually and randomly
selected regions and genomic features. Comparisons across
genomic features are also likely to be conservative, because

confidence intervals were generated using aggregate summary measures across ENCODE regions, rather than raw
data. The SNP densities correspond to a measure of heterozygosity (1 SNP per 100 kb, corresponds to a heterozygosity of 1
× 10-5).
Comparative sequence analysis has become a key bioinformatics tool for identifying noncoding functional DNA [37].
We use two derived scores that attempt to measure the relative evolutionary constraint of DNA sequences: the lengths of
MCSs determined from the multiple sequence alignments
comparing human with 13 species of mammal [25], and
rejected substitution or GERP scores from comparisons
between humans and primates [26].
Evolutionarily constrained sequences were identified using
three independent sequence conservation constraint programs (binCons, phastCons, and GERP) for three different
multiple sequence alignments generated using TBA, MLAGAN, and MAVID for 14 mammalian species [25]. Each alignment used human sequence as the reference. Three levels of
MCS were defined: strict, in which sequences are constrained
in all alignment/conservation combinations; moderate, in
which sequences are constrained in at least two of three alignments, and from two of three conservation programs; and
loose, in which sequences are constrained in at least one
alignment/conservation combination. We found results did
not alter qualitatively between use of the three scores and we
present results using moderate MCS in this report. Note that
we refer to 'constrained' rather than 'conserved' sequence
because conservation per se does not imply function, whereas
constraint does. GERP identifies regions at high resolution
that exhibit nucleotide substitution deficits, and measures
these deficits as 'rejected substitutions'. Rejected substitutions reflect the intensity of past purifying selection and are
used to rank and characterize constrained elements. GERP
scores are positive in constrained regions and negative in
neutral DNA [26], and MCS scores are high in constrained
regions and low in neutral DNA [25].
To illustrate potential relationships between indel rates and
constraint scores, summary data for the 44 ENCODE regions
were plotted using cubic smoothing splines and robust linear
regression using an M estimator [36]. The latter approach is
robust to potential outliers but conservative. Potential outliers were also identified using standard regression leverageresidual diagnostics [36], and we assessed the sensitivity of
results to outlier removal using Pearson product moment
correlation coefficients (r) and adjusted linear R2 statistics
(multiple correlation coefficient R).
