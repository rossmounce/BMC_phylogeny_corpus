Purine biosynthesis in archaea: variations on a
theme
Anne M Brown1,2, Samantha L Hoopes1,3, Robert H White2 and Catherine A Sarisky1*

Abstract
Background: The ability to perform de novo biosynthesis of purines is present in organisms in all three domains of
life, reflecting the essentiality of these molecules to life. Although the pathway is quite similar in eukaryotes and
bacteria, the archaeal pathway is more variable. A careful manual curation of genes in this pathway demonstrates
the value of manual curation in archaea, even in pathways that have been well-studied in other domains.
Results: We searched the Integrated Microbial Genome system (IMG) for the 17 distinct genes involved in the 11
steps of de novo purine biosynthesis in 65 sequenced archaea, finding 738 predicted proteins with sequence
similarity to known purine biosynthesis enzymes. Each sequence was manually inspected for the presence of active
site residues and other residues known or suspected to be required for function.
Many apparently purine-biosynthesizing archaea lack evidence for a single enzyme, either glycinamide
ribonucleotide formyltransferase or inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase, suggesting that there are at least two
more gene variants in the purine biosynthetic pathway to discover. Variations in domain arrangement of
formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthetase and substantial problems in aminoimidazole carboxamide
ribonucleotide formyltransferase and inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase assignments were also identified.
Manual curation revealed some overly specific annotations in the IMG gene product name, with predicted proteins
without essential active site residues assigned product names implying enzymatic activity (21 proteins, 2.8% of
proteins inspected) or Enzyme Commission (E. C.) numbers (57 proteins, 7.7%). There were also 57 proteins (7.7%)
assigned overly generic names and 78 proteins (10.6%) without E.C. numbers as part of the assigned name when a
specific enzyme name and E. C. number were well-justified.
Conclusions: The patchy distribution of purine biosynthetic genes in archaea is consistent with a pathway that has
been shaped by horizontal gene transfer, duplication, and gene loss. Our results indicate that manual curation can
improve upon automated annotation for a small number of automatically-annotated proteins and can reveal a
need to identify further pathway components even in well-studied pathways.

Koonin), and Dr. Michael Galperin.

Background
Purines are key components of all living cells on earth,
required for energy metabolism and biosynthesis of
RNA and DNA. Purine biosynthesis pathways were first
described in the 1950’s and 1960’s [1-3] and represented
a central force in the development of the field of biochemistry. For decades, the story of purine biosynthesis
seemed mostly complete, with only a few new enzymes
added to the pathway [4-6]. However, with increased

study of archaea and the availability of archaeal genomes, it became clear that the purine biosynthesis pathway in many archaea included several unique enzymes
[7,8].
The accepted purine biosynthesis pathway (with
known variations) is shown in Figure 1. There is complete conservation of the intermediates of purine biosynthesis from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to
5-phospho-b-D-ribosylamine (PRA), with the exception
of N5-CAIR (N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide),
which is bypassed in eukaryotes. The enzymes catalyzing
each step, however, are more variable, with four

common nonhomologous enzyme substitutions known
across the three domains. Intriguingly, the archaea manifest all four of the known nonhomologous substitutions
in this pathway, with evidence (discussed in this paper)
for an additional two substitutions still to be identified.
The de novo purine biosynthesis pathway from PRPP
to IMP includes one branch, to thiamine biosynthesis,
and one alternate input, from histidine biosynthesis.
Thiamine biosynthesis uses AIR (aminoimidazole ribotide) as a substrate. Thus, the first four enzymatic steps
of the pathway are not truly committed to purine biosynthesis, but serve both purine biosynthesis and thiamine biosynthesis. The interaction between the histidine
pathway and purine biosynthesis is less easily diagrammed. ATP (an end-product of purine biosynthesis
or obtained by salvage) reacts with PRPP, followed by a
ring-opening reaction that opens the purine ring, leading to production of aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), which can be formylated and then
cyclized to re-form the purine ring. Thus, provided that
the final two steps of the de novo purine biosynthesis
pathway are functional, histidine biosynthesis will result
in no net loss or gain in purines. Due to the desirability
of reclaiming the AICAR, we expect to find at least the

final two steps of the de novo purine pathway present
whenever the histidine biosynthesis pathway is present.
The availability of full genome sequence data for
numerous archaeal species allows the comparative study
of the enzymes involved in de novo purine biosynthesis.
We used the Integrated Microbial Genome system
(IMG) to curate open reading frames (ORFs) on the
basis of high similarity to an experimentally characterized gene or enzyme in another species (ideally as a
bidirectional best hit [9]). The presence of nearby gene
candidates for the same biochemical pathway supported
the annotations through “guilt by association” [10].
Although several metabolic pathway reconstructions are
available elsewhere [11,12], a genomic analysis of the
purine biosynthesis pathway of the archaea in the depth
and breadth presented here is not otherwise available.
Below, we describe our findings upon inspection of each
genome and discuss these findings in the context of previous experimental data.
The ever-increasing pace of genome sequencing
means that genomes will increasingly be annotated by
automated or semi-automated processes. This paper
serves as a case study of the errors possible in the largely automated gene annotations present in IMG. As

eleven steps in the pathway. Redundancy was especially
common in the AICAR formyltransferase assignments.
Only in the case of the purB and purM genes could we
assign exactly one gene from each purine biosynthesizing organism to the necessary function. Specific findings
for each biosynthetic step are discussed below.

purine biosynthesis is relatively well-understood, our
findings represent a best-case scenario, with increased
likelihood of problem annotations in pathways that have
been less well-studied.

Results and Discussion
We identified a complete or nearly complete set of the
genes necessary for purine biosynthesis in 58 of the 65
species studied. However, 25 of these suspected purine
biosynthesizing species lacked a gene candidate for
either glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) formyltransferase or inosine 5’-monophosphate (IMP) cyclohydrolase.
As each of these 25 species lacked just one gene in the
pathway, we believe that these species do synthesize
purines, and that further work will reveal novel pathway
variants. The gene candidates for each of the purine biosynthetic steps are listed in Additional File 1, with a
summary of findings in Figures 2 and 3.
We identified at least one organism with apparent
redundancy (either two similar copies of the same gene
or two different genes for the same step) in five out of

Korarchaea. A schematic, taxonomy-based phylogenetic tree is provided, along with order names within the Crenarchaota. The typically bifunctional PurH protein appears twice, as PurH1 (the C-terminal AICAR formyltransferase domain) and PurH2 (the N-terminal IMP cyclohydrolase
domain). Additional File 1 contains gene locus tags for each candidate gene. Symbols used: ■ denotes a gene that is a good match. □ denotes
a match with some problems, as described in more detail in the text. ▲ is used to represent a cluster II PurP protein. [■] indicates that the
expected gene is split into two adjacent loci. ■- ■ denotes a protein with a domain duplication. Where a “?” appears, a gene is necessary for an
otherwise complete purine biosynthesis pathway to be functional, but no gene candidate could be identified with the data available.

biosynthesis genes has occurred multiple times. These
organisms entirely lack the genes required for de novo
purine biosynthesis enzymes, with only minor exceptions, described below.
Where available, the growth conditions of these nonpurine biosynthesizing organisms are consistent with a
requirement for purines. Aeropyrum pernix requires
adenine in its growth medium, consistent with an inability to synthesize purines de novo [13]. Korarchaeum
cryptofilum has not been grown in pure culture [14].
Hyperthermus butylicus [15] and Staphylothermus marinus [16] (both sulfur-reducing peptide fermenters) grow
with tryptone or peptone in the growth medium

(respectively), either of which would provide a purine
source. Similarly, Thermofilum pendens, believed to be
adapted to growth in nutrient-rich environments,
requires tryptone or yeast extract for culture [17]. The
parasitic Nanoarchaeum equitans must rely on Ignicoccus hospitalis to supply its purine requirement [18].
In T. onnurineus, which grows in rich media that
could meet the organism’s apparent purine requirement
[19], only a purB-like gene is present, probably involved
in purine interconversion. (We also found the purine
interconversion genes guaA, guaB, and purA, not
shown.) Although Lee and coworkers have proposed
that T. onnurineus obtains purines through its histidine

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/63

biosynthesis pathway [19], de novo histidine biosynthesis
provides no net creation of purines due to use of the
purine ring of ATP as a substrate, as described above.
Additionally, there is no genomic evidence of a PurP or
PurH enzyme that could convert the aminoimidazole
carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) produced by histidine biosynthesis back into a purine. If T. onnurineus
truly lacks a means to convert the AICAR produced by
histidine biosynthesis back to a purine, biosynthesis of
histidine will in fact result in a net loss of purines and
accumulation of AICAR in this organism. Thus, we suspect that T. onnurineus is auxotrophic for purines, with
higher need for purines (and accumulation of AICAR)
in the absence of environmental histidine.
In the case of K. cryptofilum, which has been enriched
only in complex media (in which purines would be present) and is thought to use peptides as an energy source
[14], we identified a pair of purP-like genes, along with
purB. As PurB functions in purine interconversion as
well as de novo biosynthesis, we do not consider its presence indicative of de novo purine synthesis. The role of
PurP-like enzymes, however, is not entirely clear in this
organism, as will be discussed in further detail below.
Glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate
amidotransferase (EC 2.4.2.14, GPATase, PurF)

The purF gene product, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (GPATase, PurF), catalyzes
the first step in biosynthesis of purines, conversion of
phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to 5-phospho-bD-ribosylamine (PRA). The Escherichia coli PurF
enzyme has also been demonstrated to have low-level
promiscuity for phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase
activity (normally encoded by trpF), as demonstrated by
complementation studies [20].
A conserved N-terminal cysteine residue forms a catalytic triad with histidine and aspartate in the glutamine
amidotransfer domain. In Bacillus subtilis, this is
accomplished by cleavage of a short peptide from the

Page 5 of 21

N-terminus [21]. In E. coli, the cysteine is N-terminal
after removal of the initial methionine. In E. coli, the Nterminal cysteine is required for use of glutamine as the
nitrogen source, with no detectable activity when the
cysteine is replaced with alanine or serine, although
ammonia can still serve as the nitrogen source [22]. We
thus expect any archaeal purF gene should encode a
cysteine at or near the N-terminus if glutamine is the
nitrogen source.
We identified a gene encoding a protein similar to
PurF in all of the purine biosynthesizing archaeal species
studied, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Out of the Euryarchaeota studied, only Methanocorpusculum labreanum’s genome includes two candidate sequences,
Mlab_0202 and Mlab_0150. As Mlab_0150’s predicted
protein has a serine in place of the active site cysteine,
we suspect that Mlab_0150 does not encode a glutamine
phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, and that
Mlab_0202 is the actual purF gene. Mlab_150 appears to
be a relatively recent duplication of Mlab_0202, as it is
most similar to Mlab_0202 and the putative purFs in
closely related species.
The most promising PurF candidates in Methanosaeta
thermophila, Desulfurococcus kamchatkensis, and Cenarchaeum symbiosum initially appeared to be lacking
the active site cysteine, but when we inspected the 5’
DNA sequence, we found that a cysteine was present if
we proposed an earlier translation initiation site, as
shown in Figure 4. Some archaeal PurF candidates
require cleavage of several residues to reveal the Nterminal cysteine and others require only removal of the
N-terminal methionine. Although experimental data is
required to verify these translation initiation sites, our
findings are consistent with at least 5% error rate (3/58)
for initiation site determination in these purF genes.
Alignment and phylogenetic tree generation for the
two PurF-like proteins in each of the Crenarchaeota
revealed that two distinct clusters (Additional Files 1
and 2), with each Crenarchaeon having one gene in

Figure 4 N-terminal sequences from selected PurF candidates. Start sites in IMG are underlined, with protein sequences for our proposed
earlier start sites shown for DKAM_0523, Mthe_0230, and CENSYa_1910. The cysteine nucleophile is in bold.

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63

each cluster. One cluster contained proteins with the
expected active-site N-terminal cysteine, and we believe
these are the actual PurF enzymes. The proteins in the
second cluster, which we call PurF’, lacked the N-terminal cysteine necessary for glutaminase activity. Many
PurF’ proteins had alanine or valine, which could not
substitute as the nucleophile required for glutaminase
activity. These purF’ gene loci are enclosed in parentheses in Additional File 1 and denoted with “□” in Figures
2 and 3 to indicate the missing active site feature. The
genes purF and purF’ are close to each other and to
other purine biosynthesis genes in these genomes; thus,
gene clustering supports the role of both PurF and
PurF’ in purine biosynthesis. Many of the Crenarchaeota
have other ORFs that are bidirectional best hits for the
similar amidotransferases AsnB and GlmS, so we do not
believe that either of these purF-like genes is actually
asnB or glmS [23]. As both PurF and AsnB exhibit a
loss of function when the equivalent cysteine residue is
replaced with alanine or serine [24], the PurF’ proteins
are unlikely to be functional amidotransferases with any
substrate. One possibility is that PurF’ acts an ammoniadependent phosphoribosylpyrophosphate aminotransferase, a hypothesis that will require experimental testing.
We identified an additional C-terminal domain in
Methanospirillum hungatei’s PurF. This C-terminal
domain is a HEPN-type domain, which might be
involved in nucleotide binding. This feature was unique
to M. hungatei, and its specific function in this PurF
candidate is unclear.
Glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase (EC 6.3.4.13, GARS,
PurD)

Glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase, PurD, is an
ATP-grasp protein, responsible for conversion of 5phospho-b-D-ribosylamine (PRA) to 5-phosphoribosylglycinamide (GAR), with incorporation of glycine and
hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. Transfer of the unstable
PurD substrate, PRA, from PurF is believed to occur
through a transient interaction between these two
enzymes [25]. Studies of PurF and PurD from Aquifex
aolicus indicated that coupling occurs, but the measured
in vitro efficiency was too low to be biologically useful,
suggesting that another protein or small molecule may
be required to reconstitute a functional assembly [26].
A gene encoding a protein similar to PurD was identified in all purine-synthesizing archaea. Two candidates
for PurD were present in Haloarcula marismortui
(rrnAC1109 and rrnAC0307) and Halorubrum lacusprofundi (Hlac_1295 and Hlac_1553). We suspect
rrnAC1109 and Hlac_1295 encode the functional PurD
enzymes, based on problems with Hlac_1553 and
rrnAC0307, including missing Pfam GARS_N sequences
and Mg 2+ binding sites. These two “extra” PurD-like

Page 6 of 21

proteins were the only PurD-like sequences we identified in which a highly conserved aspartate in the R[LF]
GDPEx[EQIM] motif (Prosite PS00184, corresponding
to amino acids 290-298 in the E. coli PurD) was not
conserved [27]. Similarly, the N-terminal P-loop region
is quite divergent in Hlac_1553 and rrnAC0307 compared to the other archaeal PurD-like proteins. We conclude that these “extra” proteins are not actual
glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetases, despite their
annotations.
Formate-dependent GAR formyltransferase (EC 6.3.4.-,
PurT) and GAR formyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.2, PurN)

Conversion of GAR to formyl glycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) may be catalyzed by either of two distinct
formyltransferases. The first, PurN, transfers a formyl
group from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to GAR. The second, PurT, uses formate as the one-carbon source for
formylation of GAR, with coupled hydrolysis of ATP. In
those archaea that use only methanopterin-related coenzymes as C-1 carriers, with no 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
present [28], a purN gene is not expected, as PurN
requires 10-formyltetrahydrofolate as the one-carbon
donor. Although superficially similar to 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, N10-formyltetrahydromethanopterin is not
believed to be functional as a formyl group donor [29].
GAR formyltransferase activity appears to be provided
by PurN in the Thaumarchaeota, Thermoplasmata,
Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales, Thermoproteales, and Halobacteriales. The residues involved in catalysis in the E. coli enzyme (His108 and Asp144 [30])
are conserved in each of these archaeal enzymes. Methanosarcina barkeri has been previously determined to
contain tetrahydrofolates [31], which would be required
for PurN activity. Tetrahydrofolates are expected to be
present in all PurN-containing organisms. The incorporation of labeled acetate at C8 of purine synthesized
in M. hungatei and M. barkeri is consistent with this
formyl group being transferred from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate by a PurN-type GAR formyltransferase [32],
consistent with the presence of purN in the genomes of
these organisms.
The nine species of Halobacteria studied have a PurNlike enzyme fused to a PurH1-like domain (which would
also require tetrahydrofolates). Some of these organisms
have previously been shown experimentally to contain
tetrahydrofolates [33]. H. walsbyi has both the purNpurH1 fusion and a purT-like gene. It is unknown
whether both genes encode functional enzymes, providing H. walsbyi with two alternatives depending on
growth conditions (as occurs in E. coli), or whether one
gene is non-functional. The purT gene seems likely to
be a recent acquisition by horizontal gene transfer, as H.
walsbyi’s closest relatives have only PurN for GAR

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/63

formyltransferase activity, and the H. walsbyi PurT
sequence is more closely related to bacterial PurTs than
to other archaeal PurT sequences. In our consensus
phylogenetic tree for PurT (Additional File 2), the H.
walsbyi protein was a deep branch near the center of
the unrooted tree.
The PurT enzyme (previously identified in bacteria
[4]) provides GAR formyltransferase activity in archaea
that have no tetrahydrofolates, including as Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Methanococcus maripaludis, and
Pyrococcus spp. A purT-like gene is also present in the
Sulfolobales, which are believed to have very low levels
of tetrahydrofolates [33] along with a folate analogue
with characteristics of both tetrahydrofolate and methanopterin [34]. The active site residues of the putative
archaeal PurT enzymes are identical to those identified
in E. coli, with complete conservation at positions 114,
155, 160, 162, 195, 203, 267, 279, 286, 355, 362, and 363
(E. coli numbering) [35].
In E. coli, the function of PurT for purine biosynthesis
requires the presence of formyltetrahydrofolate hydrolase, PurU, to provide PurT with formate from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. Thus, E. coli deletion mutants purN
purT and purN purU were unable to convert GAR to
FGAR, while single gene deletions did not block production of FGAR [36]. In E. coli, both GAR formyltransferase variants – the PurN-catalyzed reaction using 10formyltetrahydrofolate and the PurT-catalyzed reaction
using formate from PurU – require 10-formyltetrahydrofolate. In those archaea with only archaeal folate analogues (such as methanopterin), purine biosynthesis
must proceed differently. Although a PurT enzyme may
be functional in these organisms, its formate cannot be
supplied by PurU.
A PurU homologue is absent from nearly all of the
PurT-utilizing archaea. These archaea apparently have
enough formate present not to require channeling from
a PurU enzyme. We did identify a PurU-like protein in
each of the Halobacteria and Thaumarchaeota, with
conserved catalytic residues His 106 and Asp 142
(human numbering) [37]. The presence of PurU in these
species, given that only Haloquadratum walsbyi has a
candidate for PurT, was surprising. This PurU-like protein may regulate levels of folates, as proposed for E.
coli [38], or may produce formate for another purpose
in these archaea. A purine-related role is suggested by
the genomic location of the purU-like gene in some of
the Halobacteria, where it was found in a gene cluster
with purS, purQ, and purC. The two Thaumarchaeota
may be using PurU to produce formate for PurP (discussed below), but the Halobacteria do not contain
PurP, and thus there is no clear reason for a formateproducing enzyme’s gene to cluster with purine biosynthesis genes in the Halobacteria.

Page 7 of 21

We could not identify a GAR formyltransferase (purN/
purT) gene in seven species of Archaea that appear to
have otherwise intact purine biosynthesis pathways. The
two Archaeoglobi, four Methanomicrobiales, and
Methanopyrus kandleri have no genes with high similarity to known purT or purN genes despite otherwise
complete or near-complete purine biosynthesis pathways. Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Methanothermobacter
thermoautotrophicus are known to contain methanopterin-related folate analogues rather than tetrahydrofolates, so the unidentified enzymes might use formate as
a carbon source (as in PurT), or may use an alternate
non-folate carbon source other than methanopterin, as
discussed above. Although Methanosphaera stadtmanae,
Methanobrevibacter smithii, and Methanobrevibacter
ruminantium are intestinal commensals and thus might
rely on an environmental source of purines (despite the
presence of an otherwise complete pathway), M. thermoautotrophicus is an established purine prototroph [39]
and so must have some means to catalyze the GAR formyltransferase reaction. Labeling studies are inconsistent
as to the substrate of the missing GAR formyltransferase
in the Methanomicrobiales. In the presence of formate,
M. stadtmanae has been shown to derive C8 from C2
of acetate (most consistent with the use of a tetrahydrofolate C1 carrier), while closely related M. smithii does
not derive C8 from acetate [32].
Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthetase (EC
6.3.5.3, PurL, PurS, PurQ)

Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthetase (FGAM
synthetase or FGAR aminotransferase) catalyzes the
synthesis of FGAM from FGAR, glutamine, and ATP.
FGAM synthetase has been observed to occur as either
a single multidomain enzyme (lgPurL) or as a multiprotein complex composed of a shorter PurL (smPurL) corresponding to the central domain of lgPurL and two
other proteins: PurQ, a glutaminase similar to the Cterminal glutaminase domain in lgPurL, and PurS,
which is structurally similar to the N-terminal domain
of lgPurL [40-42]. The PurS protein is required for purine biosynthesis in B. subtilis [5] and presumably in
other organisms with smPurL. PurS has been proposed
to be a “protein-protein interaction module” [43], but
there is disagreement in the literature about its physiologically relevant form [40]. Most of the purine-biosynthesizing archaea we studied had genes encoding
smPurL, PurQ, and PurS, similar to the situation in
Gram-positive bacteria.
In M. labreanum, a large gene encoding a protein
similar to lgPurL, Mlab_0300, is present. This gene is
more closely related to the lgpurL genes in Clostridia
and other bacterial species than it is to any gene in the
sequenced archaea. Separate genes for purS and purQ

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/63

are not present in M. labreanum, as would be expected
for an organism with a lgPurL. This result is consistent
with the gene being horizontally transferred from Clostridia after divergence of M. labreanum from its nearest
sequenced relatives. We found Mlab_0300 alternately
annoted as “carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, large subunit” or FGAM synthase in the databases consulted. We
did not see compelling evidence for a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase assignment for this gene.
Methanospirillum hungatei, Methanoculleus marisnigri,
Methanocella sp. RC-I, Methanoregula boonei, Methanococcus vannielii, and Methanococcus maripaludis encode a
form of PurL that is longer than the other smPurLs seen
in most archaeal species. The larger gene product (which
we call mdPurL) has approximately 200 additional amino
acids at the N-terminus, where a PurS-like domain would
occur in lgPurL. In these species, the N-terminal sequence
shares only low sequence identity with the similar portion
of lgPurL or PurS, but we suspect that this domain serves
a similar structural function to PurS or the N-terminal
portion of lgPurL. Five of the six organisms with mdPurL
lack a purS gene, supporting this supposition. M. marisnigri has both mdpurL and a purS gene candidate, in what
may be an example of redundancy. The pattern of distribution of mdpurL versus smpurL plus purS is patchy, with
closely related species having different purL lengths.
The catalytic triad [41] of the glutaminase (PurQ, or the
corresponding domain of lgPurL) is present, with the
cysteine and glutamate fully conserved, and conservation of
histidine in all sequences except the two Thaumarchaeota,
where an asparagine is present. We also identified an additional PurQ-like protein in M. marisnigri, Memar_1841.
This putative protein lacks roughly 150 residues, including
the all three residues in the catalytic triad. Memar_1841 is
clustered with the candidate genes for purS and purC,
while the full-length purQ, Mmar_1628, is adjacent to the
gene encoding the mdPurL candidate. We suspect a duplication event or horizontal gene transfer (HGT) followed by
gene decay, which would serve to explain both the extra
fractional purQ and an unexpected purS gene.
PurS proteins are typically less than 100 amino acids
in length. We had problems with earlier versions of several databases with finding PurS-like ORFs, which
necessitated searching for missed ORFs with TBLASTN
(data not shown). The problem of unidentified ORFs
appears to be resolved for PurS, but serves to illustrate
the danger of using arbitrary minimum lengths as a cutoff in coding sequence identification. We may be missing additional small but important proteins.
Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine cyclo-ligase (AIR
synthetase, 6.3.3.1, PurM)

PurM, aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) synthetase,
catalyzes the conversion of FGAM to AIR, with

Page 8 of 21

hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. PurM is structurally and
mechanistically related to the central domain of PurL
(smPurL), the enzyme in the previous step of purine
biosynthesis [44,45]. We identified one candidate gene
for purM in each of the purine-biosynthesizing organisms studied, with bidirectional best hits on E. coli
PurM. Three previously proposed [46] active site residues, His190, Asp65, and Asp94 (E. coli numbering), are
100% conserved in the species studied, while replacement of His 247 with asparagine occurs in Caldivirga
maquilingensis, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Picrophilus
torridus, and Thermoplasma volcanium. As there is no
other obvious candidate for PurM in these species, we
suspect that the H247N change does not significantly
impair the ability of this enzyme to catalyze the reaction.
Conversion of AIR to CAIR (AIR carboxylase, 4.1.1.21, class
II PurE; NCAIR synthetase, 6.3.4.18, PurK; and NCAIR
mutase, 5.4.99.18, class I PurE)

In eukaryotes, a class II PurE enzyme effects formation
of 5-amino-4-imidazole-carboxylic acid ribonucleotide
(CAIR) directly from AIR by addition of CO2 [47], with
no ATP requirement. However, the conversion of AIR
to CAIR in bacteria requires two enzymes, PurK and
class I PurE. The PurK enzyme uses AIR, bicarbonate,
and ATP to produce the unstable 5-carboxyamino-1-(5phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole (N 5-CAIR) intermediate
and ADP. The N5-CAIR is then converted to CAIR by a
class I PurE enzyme. Although N 5 -CAIR is unstable,
PurE and PurK have not been shown to associate in
vitro [6].
While a purE gene candidate is present in all purine
biosynthesizing archaea studied, the distribution of purK
is patchy, as shown in Tables 1, 2, with purK present in
most Crenarchaeota, in the Halobacteria, in some Thermococci, and in the Thermoplasmatales. The absence of
purK from the methanogens, Ignicoccus hospitalis, and
D. kamchatkensis is consistent with high availability of
CO 2 in these species’ environments. For those organisms that do contain a PurK enzyme, we found the
active site residues identified by Thoden and coworkers
[48] to be well conserved. Lys 120 (E. coli numbering),
which contacts the adenine ring of ATP, is 100% conserved in archaeal PurK. Glu 153, another adenine-contacting position, is fully conserved except for two cases
where it is substituted with glutamine and one case with
aspartate, both fairly conservative substitutions. Arg 80,
which contacts the ATP phosphates, is present in the
Crenarchaeota, but conservatively substituted with lysine
in Thaumarchaeota and PurK-containing Euryarchaeota.
Gln 11, proposed to contact the AIR substrate, is fully
conserved after correcting for an incorrect translation
initiation site in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. An insertion
in the Crenarchaeota and generally low homology in the

The three gene products share an EC number.
Naming of PurE is problematic. Some PurEs are not clearly class I or class II, and some organisms lack a PurK, making a class II type name more appropriate
even when PurE appears class I. We counted either a class I or class II-type name as correct in this analysis.

Halobacteria fusions of PurN and PurH1 are counted under PurN.

Separate counts were maintained for PurP-like proteins in cluster II. We preferred generic names and no EC number, given a lack of demonstrated function for

region of Glu 49, thought to make contacts to the ribose
ring of AIR, prevented us from making a definitive
determination about conservation of this residue. Lys
307, Arg 313, and Lys 314, postulated to contact AIR,
and Asp 127, postulated to act as a base during the
reaction, were fully conserved.
There may be an evolutionary advantage for the use of
class II PurE or non-enzymatic production of N5-CAIR,
with avoidance of ATP hydrolysis by PurK, but only in
the context of a sufficiently high concentration of CO2 to
give a reasonable rate of CAIR synthesis. E. coli PurE has
been shown to catalyze conversion of AIR to CAIR (without PurK) in the presence of high concentrations of
bicarbonate [6]. It has been suggested that PurK may not
be required for hyperthermophilic organisms growing at
high CO2 concentrations, where the non-enzymatic conversion of AIR to N5-CAIR may be sufficient [49]. Patrick
et al. have demonstrated complementation of the Keio
collection E. coli purK deletion with over-expression of
plasmid-encoded PurE, which they suggest helps shift the
equilibrium position of the non-enzymatic reaction, compensating for lack of PurK [50]. We thus do not consider
the absence of purK to be an indication that an unknown
gene is involved in the pathway, so much as a reflection
of a variety of strategies for production of CAIR depending on carbon dioxide availability.
Archaeoglobus profundus and A. fulgidus have a class
II-like PurE and no PurK. These PurEs from the
Archaeoglobi have the six conserved distinguishing residues for class II enzymes as proposed by Matthews et

al. [51], as previously described for the A. fulgidus protein. The purE genes appear to have been horizontally
transferred from a eukaryote, with loss of the ancestral
organism’s class I purE, as the present genes encode
proteins more closely related to eukaryotic PurEs than
to any other archaeal PurEs.
The four Methanobacteria (M. smithii, M. thermoautotrophicus, M. ruminantium, and M. stadtmanae) have
a gene encoding two fused PurE-like domains, but no
purK gene. The M. thermoautotrophicus and M. smithii
purE-purE’ genes complement both purE and purK deletions in E. coli [52], suggesting that a purK gene is not
necessary in M. thermoautotrophicus or M. smithii. The
first domain (PurE) has been characterized as class I
based on amino acid sequence [51]. Intriguingly, a deletion in the second half of M. smithii gene (the purE’
region) removed the ability of that gene to complement
either purE or purK deletions in E. coli [52], suggesting
that it may actually be the PurE’ that is involved in catalysis of both steps of this reaction, despite lower similarity of this second domain to known PurE enzymes.
Alternately, the PurE’ domain might be structural in
nature but strictly required for subunit assembly.
Regardless of which domain is responsible for the catalysis, we conclude that all four of these double-length
PurE-like proteins effect the AIR carboxylase reaction
alone on the basis of the complementation results with
the M. smithii and M. thermoautotrophicus genes.
The other methanogens, the Desulfurococcales, and
some of the Thermococci have a class I-like PurE and

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/63

no PurK. With the exception of a methionine at position
14 (E. coli numbering), which is not conserved in
archaea, the other conserved positions in our PurE candidates match those identified by Mathews and coworkers [51]. These class I-like PurE enzymes are either
using high concentrations of carbon dioxide and AIR as
substrates, are using N5-CAIR produced from non-enzymatic reactions, or have an alternate enzyme involved in
N5-CAIR production.
The Halobacteria studied have a PurE-like protein that
we could not unambiguously assign to either class I or
class II. An insertion after the first helix (relative to the E.
coli structure), a lysine at position 73, and poor alignment
in the otherwise conserved region at the end of helix 4
result in no match to the consensus sequence of class I
or class II. As these organisms have a separate purK-like
gene, these PurE enzymes only need to perform the class
I function, which we expect based on these organisms’
occurrence in cool, aerobic environments.
Except for the Desulfurococcales, the Crenarchaeota
have a class I PurE accompanied by PurK. Experimental
support for this assignment is available in Sulfolobus solfataricus, in which the purE and purK genes have each
been previously shown to complement E. coli with the
corresponding deletion, with no ability of the S. solfataricus purE gene to complement E. coli purK deletions or
vice versa [53]. High temperature alone thus does not
appear sufficient to remove the utility of purK in the
absence of high carbon dioxide levels.
Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide
synthetase (EC 6.3.2.6, SAICAR synthetase, PurC)

The purC gene product, SAICAR synthetase, catalyzes
the conversion of L-aspartate, ATP, and CAIR into
phosphoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide
(SAICAR), ADP, and phosphate. PurC is structurally
and mechanistically related to adenylsuccinate synthase
(PurA), which converts IMP, L-aspartate and GTP to
adenylsuccinate, GDP, and phosphate [54]. E. coli PurC
has been kinetically characterized [54], and structures of
PurCs from several species have been reported [55-57]
or deposited (MJ1592).
We identified at least one purC-like gene in all purine-synthesizing archaeal species. Conservation of the
substrate-contacting residues identified by Ginder and
coworkers [57] for the E. coli crystal structure with
bound CAIR and ADP is high. Glu 179, which contacts
ADP, and Ser 100, Arg 94, Arg 199, and Asp 175, which
contact CAIR, are fully conserved. However, Lys 11 and
Lys 13, which make contacts to CAIR, are not present
in the Halobacteria or in the Archaeoglobi. Gln 69 is
not conserved in the archaea, but a highly conserved
histidine is present at the corresponding position in the
archaeal proteins. CAIR-contacting residue Arg 215 is

Page 10 of 21

conserved or conservatively replaced with Lys, except in
Thermococcus gammatolerans (TGAM_1268), Thermococcus kodakaraensis (TK0432), and M. labreanum
(Mlab_0676), where the predicted coding sequence ends
before this position. Interestingly, the two Thermococci
have two purC-like genes, so it is possible that the truncated purC-like gene does not encode active enzyme. M.
labreanum’s Mlab_0676, however, is the organism’s only
apparent purC, suggesting that SAICAR synthetase
activity may be possible even when PurC is truncated.
We built a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree for
the predicted PurC-like proteins, including a selection of
eukaryal and bacterial sequences, based only on wellaligned regions (Additional File 2). Bootstrap values
were low, thus interpretation of the results merits caution. Neither the Crenarchaeota nor Euryarchaeota were
monophyletic in our analysis, nor were the selected
eukaryal and bacterial sequences. Within the limitations
of the trees built, the history of purC does not seem to
match the history of the organisms examined. This
could be caused by numerous horizontal transfers or by
distinctly different selective pressures on these genes,
such as if some proteins are not actually SAICAR
synthetases or have a second activity in addition to SAICAR synthetase. At least two closely related reactions,
conversion of IMP to adenylosuccinate (catalyzed by
PurA) and synthesis of b-RFSA-P (4-(b-D-ribofuranosyl)-N-succinylaminobenzene 5’-phosphate) from phosphorylated
b-RFH-P
(4-(b-D-ribofuranosyl)
hydroxybenzene 5’-phosphate) [58] require very similar
chemistry and may be the proposed additional or alternate functions for some of the proposed PurC proteins.
The predicted PurC protein in M. hungatei
(Mhun_1253) is unusual, in that it includes an N-terminal radical SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) binding
domain similar to CofG [59] (49% identical to M. jannaschii CofG, 60% identical to a suspected FO synthetase subunit I in M. labreanum), in addition to a Cterminal PurC-like domain. While we did not find this
fusion in other archaeal species, the purC-like genes in
Methanosphaerula palustris, M. boonei, M. labreanum,
M. barkeri (Mbar_A3291), M. marisnigri, T. kodakaraensis (TK0432), and T. gammatolerans (TGAM_1268),
each have a gene with a radical SAM-like motif immediately preceding them on the same strand. We also found
a nearby gene on the opposite strand with a radical
SAM-like motif (sometimes annotated as cofH) in several of the Halobacteria. Although the involvement of Sadenosylmethionine in purine biosynthesis has not been
proposed, S-adenosylmethionine is required for thiamine
biosynthesis, which uses the purine biosynthetic intermediate AIR. S-adenosylmethione is also required for
the conversion of GTP to the FO cofactor. Thus, this
radical SAM-binding motif might represent a regulatory

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/63

domain for the PurC enzyme, or might code for an
enzyme required for one of these other biosynthetic
processes but co-regulated with PurC due to the need
for purines for cofactor biosynthesis.
We observed apparent duplications of the purC gene
in Methanococcus aeolicus, M. barkeri, T. gammatolerans, and T. kodakaraensis. Neither of the M. aeolicus
genes is close to other purine biosynthesis gene candidates in the genome. Based on 74% sequence identity
and well-conserved (82% BV) phylogenetic grouping of
the two M. aeolicus proteins, we concluded that this is a
relatively recent duplication. In M. barkeri, one purC
candidate, which is split into two adjacent loci
(Mbar_A0530 and Mbar_A0531) is near the purL gene,
while the second (Mbar_A3291) is not clustered with
other purine biosynthesis genes and is ambiguously
annotated as “Phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, phosphoribosylaminoribosylaminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase.” This second M. barkeri
protein and the only PurC protein from Methanocella
sp. RC-I are sister proteins on the phylogenetic tree,
with closer relationships to the PurC proteins in eukaryotes than to other archaeal PurC proteins. We did not
find any evidence that M. barkeri gene encodes a protein with PurE character, so we concluded that this is a
misannotation probably resulting from incorrect transfer
of the annotation of a fused PurCE protein (common in
eukaryotes). In T. kodakaraensis and T. gammatolerans,
one gene candidate for purC is near purM, purT, and
purF, while the other, which shows some evidence for
HGT based on our phylogenetic tree, is near purO and
one of the purP candidates, suggesting that both purClike genes are associated with purine biosynthesis.
Adenylosuccinate lyase (EC 4.3.2.2, PurB)

Adenylosuccinate lyase (PurB) plays a dual role in purine biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes two different beliminations, accomplishing conversion of SAICAR to
AICAR and of adenylosuccinate to AMP. Both reactions
produce fumarate. Structural studies reveal that a single
active site catalyzes both reactions [60], consistent with
the very similar chemistry involved. Given the participation of PurB in purine interconversion, we expect to
find a purB gene in some organisms that lack the de
novo biosynthesis pathway but are capable of purine
interconversion.
We identified one gene candidate for purB in each of
the purine biosynthesizing archaea. Among the active
site residues previously identified [60], His 143 is completely conserved among the archaeal species studied, as
are Glu 275, Asn 270, Gln 216, and His 72. M. jannaschii PurB was recently confirmed to have the ability
to convert adenylosuccinate to AMP in addition to catalyzing the conversion of 4-(b-D-ribofuranosyl)-N-

Page 11 of 21

succinyl-aminobenzene 5’-phosphate (b-RFSA-P) to 4(b-D-ribofuranosyl)aminobenzene 5’-phosphate (b-RFAP) in the biosynthesis of the arylamine of methanopterin
[58]. It is not yet known whether all PurBs from methanopterin-utilizing organisms also participate in the
synthesis of b-RFA-P.
A phylogenetic tree of well-conserved regions of the
PurB sequences contained mostly the expected organization at the order level and below, although bootstrap
values near the putative root were low. With one exception, the Crenarchaeota were monophyletic. Our consensus tree had all of the halobacterial PurB candidates
and the PurB candidate from Caldivirga maquilingensis
in a cluster with eukaryal and bacterial PurBs, with the
closest relationship being with Chloroflexus. The tree
structure could have been caused by two horizontal
gene transfers, an ancient one in the last halobacterial
ancestor, and a more recent one from a halobacterium
to Caldivirga maquiligensis. The observed tree structure
could also be caused by the incorrect assignment of all
of these proteins to the PurB function. Characterization
of archaeal PurBs has been limited to the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii enzyme, which as described above,
has had an additional “moonlighting” activity demonstrated in addition to one of the two canonical PurB
activities. Some of the unusual relationships in our phylogenetic tree may be caused by differences in substrate
specificity.
The purB gene is clustered with the fused purH1N
gene in the Halobacteria and with the two purP candidate genes (discussed below) in the Sulfolobales and
Caldivirga maquilingensis. In both cases, the purB gene
is in the opposite orientation from the purP or purH1N
gene, suggesting bidirectional transcription from a
shared promoter site between the two genes. The similar gene arrangement is surprising, given that the Sulfolobales and Halobacteria are not closely related and that
the AICAR formyltransferases PurP and PurH1 are
structurally and mechanistically unrelated despite effecting the same biosynthetic step.
In their crystal structure of the Pyrobaculum aerophilum PurB, Toth and coworkers identified three intrachain disulfide bonds that stabilize the enzyme [60].
These disulfide bonds are present only in the genus Pyrobaculum and are not a general feature of archaeal or
thermophile PurB. Although the methanogens and
Thermococci have cysteine-rich PurBs, these cysteines
are not aligned with those of P. aerophilum PurB. The
M. jannaschii PurB has eight cysteines, only some of
which appear to form one or more disulfides, as a result
of air oxidation during purification. This oxidation
greatly reduces enzymatic activity. (White, unpublished
results). The reason for the enzyme having so many
cysteines remains to be elucidated.

Aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide
formyltransferase (folate-dependent AICAR
formyltransferase, EC 2.1.2.3, PurH1 or formatedependent AICAR formyltransferase, EC 6.3.4.-, PurP) and
IMP cyclohydrolase (EC 3.5.4.10, PurH2/PurO)

In eukaryotes and bacteria, aminoimidazole carboxamide
ribonucleotide (AICAR) formyltransferase and IMP
cyclohydrolase activities occur as the bifunctional
enzyme PurH. Deletion studies on the avian gene
revealed that PurH has two separate catalytic sites and
that each half of the enzyme catalyzes one step in isolation [61]. Except in the archaea, the two domains commonly occur fused as a single bifunctional enzyme,
alternately called PurH or PurHJ (with “PurJ” representing the N-terminal IMP cyclohydrolase domain) [46].
To avoid confusion over varying usage of “PurH”, in this
manuscript we have used the term “PurH1” for the Cterminal AICAR formyltransferase (which occurs first in
the pathway) and “PurH2” for the N-terminal IMP
cyclohydrolase.
The PurH1 AICAR formyltransferase domain uses 10formyltetrahydrofolate to transfer a formyl group to
AICAR, producing FAICAR. The IMP cyclohydrolase
(PurH2) domain of PurH catalyzes the cyclization of
FAICAR to IMP, with loss of water. Given the requirement for 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (and not an archaeal
folate analogue), a different enzyme must participate in
the conversion of AICAR to FAICAR in non-folate-containing archaea. The search for AICAR formyltransferase
activity in these archaea led to the discovery that the
archaeal signature purP gene product served this function in some archaeal species, using formate as a carbon
source [8].
The PurO enzyme, from the archaeal signature purO
gene, has been shown to catalyze the IMP cyclohydrolase reaction in M. jannaschii and presumably also in
related organisms [7]. Although the catalytic mechanism
of PurO appears to be similar to that of PurH2, the protein structures and sequences are unrelated [62].
Together, PurP and PurO can act as a replacement for
full-length PurH in M. jannaschii, requiring ATP and
formate in place of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate.
There is a great deal of biosynthetic diversity among
the archaea in the final two steps of the de novo pathway. We found all possible combinations of the AICAR
formyltransferases PurH1 and PurP with the IMP cyclohydrolases PurH2 or PurO, along with instances of both
apparent redundancy in the AICAR formyltransferase
step and missing genes for the IMP cyclohydrolase step.
The Methanomicrobiales studied have a full length
purH-like gene (encoding both PurH1 and PurH2
domains) and no genomic evidence for purP or purO.
Except for Methanosaeta thermophila, the Methanosarcinales also have a full-length purH-like gene, in

Page 12 of 21

addition to multiple genes (typically two) encoding a
protein similar to the well-characterized M. jannaschii
PurP [8]. It is unclear whether these PurP-like proteins
are functional in these species, or whether the PurH-like
protein catalyzes the necessary conversions alone. Given
the presence of a purN gene and experimental determination that M. barkeri uses both folates and archaeal
folate analogs [31], all evidence indicates that use of 10formyltetrahydrofolate as a source of formyl units is
possible in these organisms, consistent with a functional
PurH1 domain. Label incorporations studies in M. barkeri and M. hungatei are consistent with catalysis of the
formyltransferase reaction by PurH1, with the formyl
group derived from a tetrahydrofolate carrier [32],
although the low levels of label incorporation in M. barkeri do not preclude activity of a PurP enzyme as well.
Active site residues in both PurH1 and PurH2 were
typically conserved in the archaea that contain these
domains. The residues identified as being important to
the IMP cyclohydrolase domain of human PurH (Lys 66,
Tyr 104, Asp 125, and Lys 137 [63]) are fully conserved
in the fourteen archaea containing a PurH2 domain. In
the PurH1 domain, the residues contacting AICAR (Arg
208, Tyr 209, Lys 267, His 268, Asn 342, Arg 352, Phe
342, and Arg 589, human numbers [64]) are fully conserved, while Asp 340 has been replaced by Glu in all
archaea containing a PurH1 domain.
M. thermophila’s PurH-like protein (Mthe_1511) does
not have the expected N-terminal PurH2 domain, but
instead has 130 residues N-terminal to the PurH1
domain that have no evident homology to an ORF in
any other sequenced genome. A region of gene duplication occurs immediately upstream of the Mthe_1511
ORF (locus tags Mthe_1512-1532). The event that
caused this duplication may also have removed purH2.
A purO gene, which could serve as a replacement for
the missing purH2 is present in M. thermophila but not
in closely related species. The remaining (PurH1-like)
protein encoded by Mthe_1511, however, is not particularly similar to the PurH1 domain from other Methanosarcinales, being more similar to several bacterial
species, which may indicate a more complex gene heritage than a simple domain loss.
Although the avian PurH1 and PurH2 domains exhibit
activity when expressed separately, only in the Archaea
do we find isolated PurH domains frequently occurring.
In the Halobacteria, only the PurH1 domain is present,
as a fusion to PurN. The presence of PurH1 is consistent with the experimentally established existence of tetrahydrofolates in some of these organisms [33]. In these
species, a purO-like gene is present, whose gene product
we expect to catalyze the necessary IMP cyclohydrolase
reaction based on similarity to the M. jannaschii PurO
enzyme. In the Archaeoglobi, the situation is reversed.

Archaeal PurP-like proteins are present, along with a
gene encoding a PurH2-like protein. Here, PurH2 performs the IMP cyclohydrolase activity (Hunter, Plymale,
and Sarisky, unpublished results), with a PurP protein
suspected to provide folate-independent formyltransferase activity. A PurH1-domain could not be functional in
A. fulgidus, as non-archaeal tetrahydrofolates are not
present [65].
Many archaeal genomes contain two purP-like genes.
Phylogenetic trees constructed using all studied PurP-

like archaeal proteins revealed clusters of protein
sequences, shown in Figure 5. Cluster Ia was monophyletic in all of our analyses, and included the experimentally characterized M. jannaschii PurP enzyme, the
single PurP-like protein from each of the Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales, and Methanocella sp. RC-I,
and one of the PurP-like proteins (MCP_2462) from
Methanocella paludicola. As each of these organisms
(except for M. paludicola) has a single PurP with high
similarity to M. jannaschii PurP and no PurH1, all are

presumed to have the expected formate-dependent
AICAR formyltransferase (PurP) activity. Cluster Ib contains a more divergent group of proteins. In some analyses, cluster Ib was monophyletic, but in others the
consensus tree placed cluster Ia as a subtree of the cluster Ib region. Cluster Ib contains predicted PurP-like
proteins from the purine-biosynthesizing Thermococci,
Crenarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Archaeoglobi, and
Methanosarcinales. Most of these organisms have one
PurP-like protein in this cluster. Methanosarcina mazei
has two closely related proteins in cluster Ib, while T.
kodakaraensis and T. gammatolerans each have one
protein closely related to the cluster Ib proteins of other
Thermococci and one protein (TK0431 and the split
TK1267 and TK1266) that is only distantly related to
other PurP proteins in cluster I. The “extra” T. kodakaraensis gene product has been crystallized without substrates (PDB code:2pbz) but awaits enzymatic
characterization. Cluster II contains exactly one protein
each from the species with a representative in cluster Ib.
While the cluster Ia/b and cluster II subtrees each are
similar to accepted phylogenetic trees, the combined
consensus tree is consistent with gene duplication and
divergence of these purP-like genes pre-dating the divergence of these archaea from a common ancestor. Thus,
we propose that both cluster Ia/b and cluster II-type
purP genes were present in the last archaeal common
ancestor, with patchy loss of one or both purP-like
genes in some of the Euryarchaeota.
In inspecting the sequence alignment for the PurP-like
proteins in both clusters, we found 100% conservation
of Arg 314 and His 27 (M. jannaschii numbering),
which make contacts to the formyl group in the MJ0136
crystal structure [66]. Residues contacting the 5’ monophosphate of AICAR were largely conserved, although
we found conservative substitution with Thr at Ser 94.
Ser 94 was not conserved in Kcr_0401, while Ser 266
was not conserved in Kcr_400. Asn 258, which contacts
the carboxamide of AICAR, was completely conserved
in cluster Ia/b and but was always histidine in the cluster II.
In cluster Ia/b, a P-loop, suspected to bind ATP [66],
with consensus sequence (K/R)GG(K/R)G is present. In
cluster II, the aligned loop sequence is two residues
longer. Most members of this cluster have several positively-charged residues in this loop region, but only one
of the four glycines in the cluster Ia/b P-loop is somewhat conserved. Sequence logos for both loop regions
are shown in Figure 6. The sequence difference at position 258 (described above) is entirely correlated with
sequence and length of the loop from 161-165 for all
the archaea studied. In this regard, the divergent
sequences TK0431 and TGAM_1266-7 are members of
cluster I.

(top) and corresponding cluster II loop region (bottom).

At this time, only a few gene products in the PurP-like
family have been experimentally characterized. M. jannaschii MJ0136, in cluster Ia, is the formate-dependent
AICAR formyltransferase originally designated PurP [8].
Pyrococcus furiosus PF1517, in cluster Ib, and PF0421, in
cluster II, have been reported to have no AICAR formyltransferase activity previously [66], although activity
under different conditions or with different substrates
cannot be ruled out. Crude cell extracts of S. solfataricus
have been demonstrated to incorporate labeled formate
in the conversion of ZMP to IMP [28], suggesting that a
PurP-like activity is present in this organism, although
we cannot identify the specific enzyme responsible from
these experiments.
To establish that both cluster Ib and cluster II purPlike genes are involved in purine biosynthesis, we considered the identities of nearby genes. The “extra” T.
kodakaraensis purP gene (TK0431) in cluster I is adjacent to an apparent IMP cyclohydrolase gene (purO)
and SAICAR synthase gene (purC), suggesting that
TK0431 is involved in purine biosynthesis as well,
despite low similarity to other genes in cluster I, and the
apparent redundancy of having two purP-like genes
from T. kodakaraensis in cluster I. The cluster Ib and II
genes in the Sulfolobales are adjacent and share a translation start site with the purB gene. Additional gene
clusters also support assignment of both purP-like genes
to purine biosynthesis. The A. fulgidus cluster II purPlike gene (AF0256) is clustered with guaA1 (not shown),
while the cluster Ib gene has no apparent linkage to
purine biosynthesis. Pyrococcus abyssi and P. furiosus’
purP-like genes are both near other purine biosynthesis
genes. In Pyrobaculum islandicum, both purP-like genes
are adjacent to each other and also close to the large

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/63

cluster of purine biosynthesis genes. Based on the available genomic data and sparse experimental data, it is
reasonable to expect that both PurP-like proteins are
associated with purine biosynthesis, although it is premature to draw any conclusions about the specific function of the proteins outside of cluster Ia at this time.
Although K. cryptofilum has been previously described
as having no purine biosynthesis pathway [14], we
found two adjacent purP-like genes, corresponding to
cluster Ib and cluster II, similar to the arrangement
seen in the Crenarchaeota. K. cryptofilum lacks other
purine biosynthesis genes (along with histidine biosynthesis genes), but it could be obtaining AICAR
through some unidentified salvage pathway or from a
component in the environment. This organism also
lacks evidence for an IMP cyclohydrolase, similar to the
situation with the Crenarchaeota. We did find genes for
a full set of enzymes for the conversion of IMP to GMP
and AMP (data not shown), suggesting that the organism may be capable of conversion of AICAR into GMP
and AMP.
Genes encoding PurO, the archaeal IMP cyclohydrolase, are largely limited to a subset of the methanogens
and the Halobacteria. We inspected a sequence alignment of 25 putative PurO enzymes, especially at the
positions identified by Kang and colleagues [62] as being
important for contacts to the substrate. Twelve of the 13
substrate-contacting residues are fully conserved in all of
the putative PurO protein sequences, while residue 54 is
conserved in 23 of 25 sequences, with the two Methanocellales having a serine in place of the consensus asparagine. The consensus phylogenetic tree for PurO
(Additional File 2) reproduced the order-level groupings
for the organisms, although bootstrap values are low
near the center of the tree. The pattern observed is consistent with either the invention of purO in the last euryarchaeal common ancestor followed by extensive loss
early in the divergence of the Euryarchaea, or by later
invention of purO followed by several horizontal gene
transfers between euryarchaeal ancestors.
The Pyrococci, some Thermococci, and all of the Crenarchaea studied do not have an identifiable purO or
purH2 gene. In the case of Sulfolobus solfataricus, it has
been previously demonstrated that AICAR to IMP activity is present in cell extracts [28], thus if one of the two
PurP-like proteins is a functional formate-dependent
AICAR formyltransferase, an unidentified IMP cyclohydrolase should be present. There is some correspondence between the organisms having duplicate purP-like
genes and those lacking a purO or purH2 gene, suggesting that one of the two PurP-like proteins might in fact
catalyze the IMP cyclohydrolase reaction, but the phyletic pattern is imperfect and thus far this speculation
has not yielded to experimental testing.

Page 15 of 21

Unexpectedly, we identified purO-like genes in Thermococcus kodakaraensis and T. gammatolerans. No
purO-like genes were found, however, in Thermococcus
sibiricus or in any of the Pyrococcus species examined.
Thus, in these seven Thermococcales, there are two closely related organisms with an apparent PurO, four
apparently purine-biosynthesizing organisms (three Pyrococci and T. sibiricus) with no evidence of any known
IMP cyclohydrolase gene, and one organism not performing purine biosynthesis. We considered the possibility that the PurO-like protein might be non-functional
or have an alternate function in T. kodakaraensis and T.
gammatolerans, as the absence of PurO in closest neighbors might suggest that some unidentified IMP cyclohydrolase is functioning in this role instead. In both T.
kodakaraensis and T. gammatolerans, the unexpected
purO-like gene is next to the rather divergent cluster I
purP-like gene (discussed above) and a second copy of a
purC-like gene. The ancestor of these two Thermococci
may have acquired this cluster of “extra” genes via horizontal gene transfer. Supporting this hypothesis, T.
kodakaraensis’ purO and extra purP are within a cluster
of atypical genes according to Cortez et al. [67] and do
not match the mode for codon usage [68] in T. kodakaraensis. An evolutionary advantage to having this extra
gene cluster is not readily apparent, although it may be
that this PurO-like protein is a more efficient IMP
cyclohydrolase than the unidentified IMP cyclohydrolase
that we suspect is present in the Pyrococci and the Crenarchaeota. Activity of the T. kodakaraensis PurO
(TK0430) has recently been experimentally confirmed in
vitro [C. A. Hunter, N. I. Plymale, and C. A. Sarisky,
unpublished results].
Part of the difficulty in detecting a gene encoding IMP
cyclohydrolase activity on the basis of genome gazing is
that the IMP cyclohydrolase enzyme has a relatively
modest role to play in the catalysis. It only needs to
hold its substrate in the appropriate orientation for
intramolecular nucleophilic attack and perhaps provide
some general acid/base-capable side chains in the vicinity. Thus, almost any enzyme with a nucleotide monophosphate binding site is a potential IMP
cyclohydrolase. One of us (CAS) is pursuing a knockout-complementation approach to identify the missing
IMP cyclohydrolase, as well as experimental characterization of proteins encoded by purP-like genes from both
clusters.

Conclusions
Although we were able to identify a candidate gene for
most of the necessary biosynthetic steps in the purine
biosynthesis pathway in most of the organisms studied,
a number of questions remain. An IMP cyclohydrolase
enzyme has not been identified for any of the

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/63

Crenarchaeota nor for a subset of the Thermococcales.
A GAR formyltransferase is similarly missing in seven of
the Euryarchaeota studied.
A number of duplicate genes (especially purF and
purP) have been identified, but a biochemical or regulatory explanation for these duplications has not been
established. Widespread duplication implies some selective advantage, particularly when it appears in organisms
with relatively small genomes. Although an isolated case
of duplication in closely related species (such as purN in
M. barkeri and M. acetivorans) may be a random occurrence, gene duplications that occur across a range of
less-related species merit further investigation, as they
presumably serve a specific function in the organisms
that have retained them.
We generally observed the same pattern of gene distribution across sequenced organisms in the same order,
but more distantly related organisms exhibit phylogenetic patterns not entirely consistent with accepted
archaeal phylogeny. For instance, we observe orders
within both the Euryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeota
that have purT and others orders that use purN. Likewise, within the Euryarchaeota, we have orders that
have purO and purP, bifunctional purH, a single
domains of purH with either purO or purP, and those
that have purP but neither purH2 nor purO. If we
accept that the archaeal phylogeny is largely correct, the
implication of this distribution pattern is that the last
archaeal common ancestor contained a complete purine
biosynthesis pathway, with numerous gene loss or gene
transfer events occurring. The distribution of genes is
largely consistent with Makarova and coworkers’ conservative estimate of the gene content of the last archaeal
common ancestor [69], although we suspect that the
last archaeal common ancestor had at least one GAR
formyltransferase (PurN and/or PurT), with patchy loss
or gain to produce the pattern presently observed in the
Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota.
Finally, we must ask: Can humans improve upon automated annotations? As shown in Table 1, the majority
of gene product names and E. C. numbers assigned in
IMG for predicted proteins involved in purine biosynthesis are correct, despite many having been assigned by
automated or semi-automated processes. However, there
is room for improvement, especially in the case of multiple-domain proteins, which were susceptible to underannotation, with the protein assigned the name and E.
C. number for only a single domain, and over-annotation, with some proteins assigned names and E. C. numbers for domains that were not present.
We also detected problems with names and E. C.
numbers assigned to predicted proteins that were similar to known enzymes but that lacked the active site
residues believed to be required for function. These

Page 16 of 21

annotations were especially suspect in organisms containing two candidates for a particular enzyme, with
both candidates typically being assigned the same
enzyme name. Assignment of a highly specific enzyme
name to a predicted protein that neither contains the
expected active site nor is the bidirectional best hit for
that enzyme is questionable at best. Assignment of specific functions based on low quality evidence carries the
risk that future annotations will propagate that name to
an entire subclass of proteins without the named activity. We believe that the subsystems approach [12], with
expert annotators (whether computers or humans)
working on specific pathways across a number of genomes can substantially improve the quality of gene
annotations.

Methods
Organisms

Fully sequenced, non-draft archaeal genomes available in
IMG (as of May 2010) were considered. Organisms studied are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Gene codes used in
Additional File 1 and throughout the paper are the
locus tags available through IMG [70]. The analysis was
further limited to the single M. maripaludis, Sulfolobus
islandicus, and S. solfataricus cultivars listed in Figures
2, 3 and Additional File 1.
Identification of gene candidates

Except where otherwise noted, gene candidates were
identified using the BLAST search tool provided
through the Joint Genome Institute’s IMG site http://
img.jgi.doe.gov, with results limited to the selected fullysequenced archaea. Known purine biosynthesis enzymes
from E. coli, B. subtilis, or characterized archaeal
enzymes (such as M. jannaschii PurP and PurO) were
used as input sequences for the BLAST searches. Where
the archaeal sequences were only distantly related to the
starting enzyme sequences, sequential BLAST searching
was performed to identify additional gene candidates.
Sequence alignments produced with IMG’s built-in
Clustal tool or with ClustalX, version 2.0.12 [71], were
inspected manually for added or missing domains and
conserved residues.
The DNA sequences flanking the purF-like genes
Mthe_0230 and CENSYa_1910 were retrieved from the
UCSC Archaeal Genome Browser [72] and translated
after problems with the predicted protein sequence
available through both this source and IMG were
detected.
Phylogenetic trees

The amino acid sequence of MJ0136 was used to identify PurP-like sequences using IMG’s BLAST tool, as
described above. Sequences were aligned with ClustalX,

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/63

version 2.0.12 [71], followed by removal of regions of
low sequence conservation and dubious alignment using
SeaView [73]. Phylogenetic trees were generated from
the aligned sequences using PhyML [74,75] with the
JTT substitution model, an estimated proportion of
invariable sites, and an estimated gamma distribution
parameter. Bootstrapping was performed using 100 data
sets, generated with the same parameters. Phylogenetic
trees were drawn from the PhyML output using Dendroscope [76]. Phylogenetic trees are provided in Additional File 2. Sequence logos were created with
WebLogo [77].
Error analysis

We evaluated the “Gene Product Name” as exported
from IMG’s gene cart and any E. C. number exported as
part of the gene product name for discrepancies
between these assignments and our manual curation.
We classified a Gene Product Name as erroneous when
it clearly applied to a different enzymatic reaction.
Minor typographical errors were not considered errors
in this analysis. Gene symbols were evaluated when they
were not blank and did not duplicate the locus tags.
Because it was not possible to distinguish between typographical errors and true errors in the gene symbol field
or E.C. number, any discrepancy in these fields was
counted as an error. Other fields containing enzyme
names and E. C. numbers available in IMG were not
considered in the error analysis. Additional details of
the error analysis are available in Table 3.

Reviewer comments
Reviewer #1: Dr. Céline Brochier-Armanet, Aix-Marseille Université, France
In their paper, Brown et al. present an exhaustive and
in-depth investigation of the purine biosynthesis pathway in Archaea. Starting from experimentally-characterised enzymes they identified homologues in 65
archaeal genomes using best-reciprocal blast hits and a
“guilty by association” strategy. The authors show that
58 archaea harbour a nearly complete purine biosynthesis pathway suggesting that only slight variations
occurred from a canonical pathway that was present in
the ancestor of Archaea. Moreover, they highlight the
absence of important enzymes in some genomes harbouring a nearly complete purine biosynthesis pathway
suggesting that some enzymes have been replaced in
some genomes by non-homologous enzymes or that
some steps of the pathway are bypassed. Based on this
analysis the authors have re-annotated some genes and
identified new putative enzymes.
I think that this contribution is of great interest to the
community working on the archaea and more generally
to microbiologists. However, I have a few general

Page 17 of 21

comments on the manuscript. My main concern is that
the paper is not easy to read because of the important
amount of information/data presented. Unfortunately
this may discourage non-specialist readers despite the
interest of the subject.
For instance, the paper would have benefited from a
longer introduction presenting current knowledge on
purine biosynthesis in the three domains of life and its
connection with histidine biosynthesis. In the current
version of the manuscript the pathway is only presented
progressively along the result/discussion section. In fact,
without minimal starting information about the pathway
the reading of the results section is very hard. Moreover
a brief overview of the archaeal phylogeny (illustrated by
a reference phylogenetic tree) must be provided to the
readers that are not familiar with the archaeal domain
(Tables 1 and 2 are not sufficient).
Author’s response

We thank the reviewer for these helpful comments. We
have expanded the introduction, hopefully improving the
accessibility of the manuscript to non-specialist readers.
We have also added a taxonomy-based phylogenetic tree
to Figures 2, 3, to give the reader some indication of the
relationships between these organisms.
Second, I think that systematic phylogenetic investigation of each enzyme would have been of great interest.
Indeed, if the presence of each enzyme in most archaeal
genomes may suggest a vertical inheritance of this pathway from the last common ancestor of this domain, it
would have been interesting to have a better picture of
the duplication, loss and horizontal gene transfer events
that have affected the evolutionary history of these
genes. For instance, this would allow discriminating
between the two types of purE, determining if purO and
purP have been co-transferred with purC in the two
thermococci that harbour two copies of purC, determining precisely the origin of purU in Halobacteriales and
Thaumarchaeota, etc. Therefore I encourage the authors
to provide phylogenetic trees of the mainly discussed
enzymes as figures and to provide other phylogenetic
trees as supplementary material. This would provide a
more precise picture of the evolution of this pathway
and greatly increase our knowledge of archaeal
evolution.
Author’s response

We have added phylogenetic trees for all proteins in
Additional File 2, along with some further discussion of
these trees in the manuscript body.
Third, the paper lacks of a few illustrations summarizing the main results. For instance, the authors should
map the identified enzymes on a reference archaeal phylogeny in order to provide a synthetic overview of their

Brown et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:63

Page 18 of 21

results. Similarly, a figure showing the genomic organisation of genes involved in purine biosynthesis would
surely be appreciated by the reader (see for instance
(Desmond et al. 2007)).

mentioning the constantly changing status of the knowledge in the field. Thus in this respect the whole part of
the paper concerning these errors can be only considered as an opinion.

Author’s response

Author’s response

We have made the recommended addition of a phylogenetic tree to Figures 2, 3. We have not produced figures
showing genomic organization due to the difficulty of
showing up to 18 genes (many not located in operons) for
65 organisms in any printable format.
Reviewer #2: Dr. Kira S. Makarova, NIH, NLM (nominated by Dr Eugene Koonin, NIH, NLM)
This paper presents a detailed description of proteins
involved or thought to be involved in purine biosynthesis in archaea. After reading the paper I have an
impression that this is meant to be a guideline for annotation of these proteins in archaeal genomes. This
guideline comes from one of the most competent group
of researchers in the field of archaeal biochemistry and
therefore their description of these proteins is absolutely
accurate and the paper will be very helpful for correction of automatic pipelines for protein annotation. This
being said I would rather suggest the authors instead of
writing a separate paper for a particular pathway to
develop and maintain a database of the enzymes
involved or implicated in archaeal central metabolism
(and publish it in a NAR database issue). Such a database could be directly linked to the annotation pipelines
and considerably improve the future genome annotation
or reannotation of the previously submitted genomes.

We agree that there is some opinion in determining what
is an error in the absence of experimental characterization. We have added more explicit information to the
manuscript about what we counted as an error. Even in
the presence of experimental characterization, there is
the question of what to do with negative results. Is the
enzyme inactive because it is being tested for the wrong
function, or simply because it needs another protein
partner to exhibit measurable activity? We believe that
the presence of obvious errors in a major database on a
“well-understood” pathway merits further discussion,
even if differences in error calling will of course result in
different percentages.
I also had a hard time to understand from the abstract
what was exactly the focus (if any) of the paper or do
authors believe that they report results of any original
research (if so what it is?). Since I consider this paper as
an annotation guideline I am hesitant to ask authors to
justify scientifically (meaning the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees for all the genes in question and comparison of maximum likelihood estimates of alternative
evolutionary scenarios) some conclusions from the
abstract like, for example: “The patchy distribution of
purine biosynthesis in archaea is consistent with a pathway that has been shaped by horizontal transfer, duplication, and gene loss”, which I would do for a paper
reporting an original research result.

Author’s response

We thank the reviewer for her kind comments about our
accuracy and for additional very helpful comments that
have improved this manuscript. A database focused on
archaeal metabolic pathways is an interesting alternative, although a database just for purines strikes us a bit
too specialized to be generally useful. To some extent, the
proposed database would duplicate the information
already available, such as in SEED and NMPDR. One of
us (CAS) is working to get our new and corrected annotations into IMG.
I do not find useful the report about the number of
errors in the enzyme annotation - it is a well-known
problem. As the understanding, that the best annotations are produced manually by experts. On the other
hand it is quite hard to find a formal approach to analyze and compare scientifically the number of errors
since there is no common rules for genomes annotation,
no widely-accepted “golden standard” to compare with
and the fact that even the results of manual annotation
still depend on the parameters of sequence similarity
detection procedure and a database content, not even

Author’s response

As described above, we have provided more information
on the phylogeny of these proteins as Additional File 2.
We hope you will agree that careful (re-)annotation of a
pathway of this size and with this level of variability is a
substantial undertaking. This work is, indeed, more
descriptive than most manuscripts. We hope it will serve
the community by identifying parts of the pathway that
merit experimental characterization and also enzymes
whose annotation is not well-supported and thus might
be reasonably tested for novel functions for which an
enzyme candidate has not been proposed.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Spreadsheet with gene locus tags for all purine
biosynthesizing genes identified. This Excel spreadsheet contains full
organism names and taxonomies, IMG taxon IDs, and gene locus tags for
all purine biosynthesizing genes identified, corresponding to the locus
tags available in IMG. Locus tags are in parentheses when significant
features (such as expected active site residues or expected domains) are
absent from the predicted protein. The designation “PurH1” is used for
the typically C-terminal AICAR formyltransferase domain, while the
designation “PurH2” is used for the typically N-terminal IMP
cyclohydrolase domain of full-length PurH. For other predicted proteins,
the locus tags were separated by a + when two adjacent ORFs appeared
to each encode part of full-length expected protein. The designations
“(in purL)” and “(in purE)” were used to denote cases where the expected
function appeared to be provided by the PurL or PurE protein, as
described further in the text.
