Abstract
Background: Assembly of stable light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) in the chloroplast of green
algae and plants requires synthesis of chlorophyll (Chl) b, a reaction that involves oxygenation of
the 7-methyl group of Chl a to a formyl group. This reaction uses molecular oxygen and is catalyzed
by chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO). The amino acid sequence of CAO predicts mononuclear
iron and Rieske iron-sulfur centers in the protein. The mechanism of synthesis of Chl b and
localization of this reaction in the chloroplast are essential steps toward understanding LHC
assembly.
Results: Fluorescence of a CAO-GFP fusion protein, transiently expressed in young pea leaves,
was found at the periphery of mature chloroplasts and on thylakoid membranes by confocal
fluorescence microscopy. However, when membranes from partially degreened cells of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cw15 were resolved on sucrose gradients, full-length CAO was detected
by immunoblot analysis only on the chloroplast envelope inner membrane. The electron
paramagnetic resonance spectrum of CAO included a resonance at g = 4.3, assigned to the
predicted mononuclear iron center. Instead of a spectrum of the predicted Rieske iron-sulfur
center, a nearly symmetrical, approximately 100 Gauss peak-to-trough signal was observed at g =
2.057, with a sensitivity to temperature characteristic of an iron-sulfur center. A remarkably stable
radical in the protein was revealed by an isotropic, 9 Gauss peak-to-trough signal at g = 2.0042.
Fragmentation of the protein after incorporation of 125I- identified a conserved tyrosine residue
(Tyr-422 in Chlamydomonas and Tyr-518 in Arabidopsis) as the radical species. The radical was
quenched by chlorophyll a, an indication that it may be involved in the enzymatic reaction.
Conclusion: CAO was found on the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membranes in mature
chloroplasts but only on the envelope inner membrane in dark-grown C. reinhardtii cells. Such
localization provides further support for the envelope membranes as the initial site of Chl b
synthesis and assembly of LHCs during chloroplast development. Identification of a tyrosine radical
in the protein provides insight into the mechanism of Chl b synthesis.

Background
Development of the chloroplast, whether from a proplastid or an etioplast, involves assembly of the abundant
thylakoid membrane system, a complex but highly coordinated process that requires chlorophyll (Chl) [1,2].
Within thylakoid membranes, the reactions of photosynthesis are driven by light energy absorbed predominantly
by light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). LHCs in plants and
green algae contain nearly equal amounts of Chl a and
Chl b associated with a family of proteins (Lhcb1 to Lhcb6
for photosystem II and Lhca1 to Lhca4 for photosystem I)
that range from about 20 kDa to 30 kDa in mass [3]. These
proteins are encoded in the nuclear genome, synthesized
on cytosolic ribosomes as precursors with an N-terminal
targeting extension, and imported into the plastid [1]. The
prototypic apoprotein (Lhcb1) of the major complex,
LHCII, binds 3 xanthophyll molecules and 14 Chl molecules, 8 of Chl a and 6 of Chl b [4-7].
Chl b is derived from Chl a by oxygenation of the 7methyl group to a formyl group [8]. An extensive amount
of evidence has been gathered on the requirement of Chl
b for accumulation of stable LHCs. For example, Chl b-less
strains lack most if not all of the major LHC apoproteins
[9-11]. In contrast, over-expression of chlorophyllide
(Chlide) a oxygenase (CAO), the enzyme that catalyzes
synthesis of Chlide b, in Arabidopsis increased the size of
the light-harvesting antenna [12], an indication that the
amount of LHCs in plants is controlled by synthesis of
Chl b. Eggink et al. [13] proposed that the additional electronegative oxygen atom in Chl b causes further redistribution of the chlorin π electron system towards the
periphery of the molecule, thereby increasing the positive
point charge on the central Mg atom, which results in an
increase in its Lewis acid strength. Stability of LHCs may
thus result from strengthening of the coordination bonds
between Chl b and electronegative, oxygen-containing ligands because of additional Coulombic attraction. Several
of the Chl b molecules are also hydrogen-bonded to
amino acid sidechains, which further strengthens the
interaction with the protein [7].
The gene and cDNA encoding CAO were isolated and
characterized from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [14]. Subsequently, CAO cDNA was cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana
[11], several other plants and algae, and the photosynthetic prokaryotic organisms, Prochloron and Prochlorothrix
[15]. Although extant CAO genes vary in sequence and
length, the deduced amino acid sequences predict conserved non-heme, mononuclear iron and Rieske iron-sulfur centers [12,15]. The phylogeny of CAO gene
sequences, coupled with genetic evidence [11,14,16],
indicated that CAO is a single-copy gene and that the ability of photosynthetic systems to synthesize Chl b arose
only one time, an important event in the evolution of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/5

plants. The absence of Chl b in plants with mutations in
the cao locus suggests that orthologous proteins, such as
Tic55 and lethal leaf spot (LLS1) proteins [17], do not
have CAO activity, although the second-site suppressor
mutations found with the Chl b-less mutant strains of C.
reinhardtii [18] suggested that similar proteins can possibly acquire CAO activity (see Discussion). To further
understand the reaction catalyzed by CAO, we initiated a
study of the enzyme. We confirmed that CAO is a membrane-bound protein and determined its intracellular
localization. The catalytic subunit, encoded by Arabidopsis
CAO cDNA, was expressed in Escherichia coli. During EPR
spectroscopic analysis of the recombinant protein, the
existence of a stable radical was discovered that is possibly
involved in the reaction mechanism.

Results
Intracellular location of CAO
To determine localization of CAO in chloroplasts, leaves
of young pea plants were biolistically transformed with
the CAO coding sequence fused in frame at the 3' end to
the coding sequence of GFP. Twenty-four hours after transient expression from the CaMV35S promoter, green fluorescence of GFP was localized quantitatively to
chloroplasts, and appeared throughout the chloroplast
(Figure 1A), including thylakoid membranes, which were
indicated by red fluorescence of Chl (Figure 1B). As
shown by the overlay in Figure 1C, direct correspondence
of green and red fluorescence was not found. Particularly
at the periphery of the plastids, the green fluorescence of
GFP seemed predominant (arrows) while the fluorescence
of Chl was predominant within the chloroplast (asterisks).
This experiment indicated that CAO was located on envelope and thylakoid membranes in developed chloroplasts, although the relative enrichment seemed greater in
the envelope as compared with thylakoid membranes.

To localize CAO by a biochemical approach, homogenized Arabidopsis leaves or broken Chlamydomonas cells
were centrifuged to separate membrane and soluble proteins. Immunoblot analysis after electrophoresis of proteins in these cell fractions showed that CAO was
recovered quantitatively with membranes and was not
released when membranes were washed with 1 M NaCl
(not shown). Membranes from cells of C. reinhardtii cw15
were resolved on sucrose gradients, followed by immunoblot analysis after electrophoresis of proteins in fractions
from the gradients. CAO was recovered in membranes
with buoyant densities characteristic of envelope membranes (ρ = 1.10 to 1.13 g cm-3; 0.8 to 1.0 M sucrose) and
in thylakoid membranes (ρ ≈ 1.17 g cm-3; about 1.3 M
sucrose) [19], consistent with results shown in Figure 1.
Because we found previously that the thylakoid marker
LHCP was detected in the low-density region of the gradient [20], regions containing envelope were possibly

against LHCP, which were recovered in fractions 6–9.
Intact CAO was not detected in these latter fractions.
A low level of mature-sized LHCP was detected in the
mid-region and also near the top of the gradient, at a
buoyant density of envelope outer membranes [19,20].
Previous work [13,21] showed by immunoelectron
microscopy that LHCPs were incorporated initially into
membranes of the envelope during chloroplast development, assembled into LHCs, and then transferred to their
major site of accumulation, the thylakoid membrane.
These results are similar to the small amount of maturesized LHCP recovered with purified envelope membranes
by Bovet et al. [22,23], which was phosphorylated by a
membrane-bound kinase and may represent LHCP transiently associated with the envelope during import.

grown 3 days in the dark at 28°C were layered on the top of
0.4 to 1.5 M linear sucrose gradients. After centrifugation as
described in Methods, fractions were collected, and the proteins in each were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and resolved by electrophoresis. A blot of the gel was

contaminated with thylakoid membranes. Thus advantage was taken of the ability to grow C. reinhardtii cw15
cells in the dark to reduce the amount of thylakoid membranes and determine more clearly whether CAO is
present in envelope membranes. When samples from cells
grown in the dark for 3 days were applied to sucrose gradients, a yellow, slightly turbid band with a density (ρ ≈
1.12 g cm-3) typical of the inner envelope membrane was
resolved in the middle of the gradient (Figure 2, fractions
3–6). The only immunoreactive polypeptide detected in
these fractions with antiserum against CAO was 51 kDa in
mass, the size predicted for the CAO gene product [14].
These immunoreactive membranes were clearly separated
from residual thylakoid membranes, indicated by their
content of Chl and by immunostaining with antibodies

EPR spectrum of recombinant CAO expressed in E. coli
Expression of Arabidopsis CAO cDNA was induced in E.
coli at 20°C to maximize recovery of correctly folded
enzyme [24]. The initial EPR spectrum of a membrane
fraction measured at 125 K revealed the presence of several distinct paramagnetic species (Figure 3A, upper trace).
A narrow signal at g = 4.3 was assigned to high-spin, nonheme Fe3+ in a near-maximally rhombic environment (E/
D ≈ 1/3). A sextet of small peaks in the region between
3000 and 3600 Gauss was attributed to a low level of contaminating Mn2+. In subsequent experiments, the Mn2+
signals were eliminated by a wash of membranes with 0.1
mM EDTA (Figure 3B). Although the g = 4.3 signal often
results from adventitious Fe3+, this signal was not diminished significantly by the wash with EDTA, nor was the
signal decreased by addition of reductants such as dithiothreitol or ascorbate (not shown), which should reduce
free iron to the EPR-silent Fe2+. Thus the g = 4.3 signal
appeared to indicate assembly of the predicted mononuclear iron center, which was possibly protected from the
environment or stabilized by the surrounding protein
structure. (This conclusion is reinforced by data shown
below for membranes solubilized with detergents.)

The most striking feature of the spectrum was a signal at g
= 2.0042 characteristic of an organic radical species (Figure 3A, upper trace, and Figure 3B). Addition of Chl a to
the sample quenched the radical (Figure 3A, lower trace),
which suggested that the radical species resided in CAO
and is likely involved in catalytic activity. The isotropic
feature of the radical spectrum, with a 9 Gauss peak-totrough linewidth, is shown on an expanded scale in Figure
4A for a sample washed with 0.1 mM EDTA. Free radical
species are present in E. coli membranes [25,26], and thus
it was important to achieve sufficient over-expression of
CAO to facilitate analysis of the EPR spectrum of CAO
without interference from endogenous signals. We
observed an endogenous radical in the spectrum of

membrane samples from uninduced E. coli cells that was
approximately equal in amplitude to a strong, endogenous high-spin, Fe3+ signal at g ≈ 6, possibly from a cytochrome [27] (not shown). The g ≈ 6 signal, and by
implication that from the endogenous radical, was below
detection in samples of over-expressed CAO (Figures 3A
and 3B). Electrophoresis of samples used for EPR spectroscopy revealed a 54 kDa polypeptide, the mass
expected of the recombinant CAO (see below), that was
prominent in fractions from cells in which CAO expression was induced but absent in samples from uninduced
cells (see below).
When the temperature at which EPR spectra were measured was lowered below 15 K, a broad signal appeared at
g = 2.057 (Figure 3B). The nearly symmetrical nature of
this signal, with a peak-to-trough linewidth of about 100
Gauss, is shown in Figure 4B after addition of Chl to
quench the radical. This signal weakened dramatically as
the temperature was increased above 20 K (not shown).
Interestingly, the addition of reducing agents such as
dithiothreitol or dithionite to the ambient-oxidized samples did not significantly affect the intensity of this signal.
However, the signal disappeared after addition of mercaptoethanol (Figure 4C). We have no obvious explanation
for the differing effects of reducing agents other than the
possibility that the EPR-active center was more accessible
to the smaller, less polar mercaptoethanol. Although the
shape and position of this signal is similar to the EPR
spectrum of Cu2+ [28-30], its sensitivity to temperature
and resistance to reductants, except for mercaptoethanol,
did not support this assignment. The large stability constant of Cu2+ with EDTA [31] also argues against the metal
being retained after the sample was washed with EDTA.
EPR spectrum of immunopurified CAO
To determine whether the spectrum of the recombinant
protein was the same as the native enzyme, proteins were
obtained by immunoprecipitation with antiserum raised
against a C-terminal fragment of CAO. This region of the
protein was selected as antigen to avoid cross-reaction
with other redox active proteins that contain conserved
Rieske or mononuclear iron domains. The EPR spectrum
of CAO recovered from detergent-solubilized extracts
from Arabidopsis leaves (Figure 5A) was similar to that
obtained with the recombinant protein. Strong signals
were found at g = 4.3 for the mononuclear iron center and
at g = 2.057, which overlapped the spectrum of the radical. We did not detect a signal predicted for a Rieske ironsulfur center up-field from the radical spectrum after addition of dithionite or ascorbate. The spectrum was not significantly different in shape when the microwave power
used for the measurement was raised from 2 mW to 100
mW at 7 K (not shown). Immunoprecipitated CAO from
C. reinhardtii cw15 cells (Figure 5B) provided a spectrum

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/5

similar to that obtained with the sample from Arabidopsis.
Preparations from Chlamydomonas cells were often contaminated with Mn2+ (not shown), but as illustrated in
Figure 5B, samples washed with 0.1 mM EDTA prior to the
analysis lacked Mn2+ signals. The treatment with EDTA
did not significantly affect the magnitude of the g = 4.3
signal, which indicated that the latter did not arise from
contaminating Fe3+. Iron has a slightly higher stability
constant with EDTA than manganese [31], which supports this treatment as an appropriate control for adventitious transition metals. Furthermore, these samples were
prepared from detergent-solubilized membranes, which
should preclude simply trapping iron within a membrane
pellet.
A control sample prepared with preimmune serum and
washed with 0.1 mM EDTA lacked the radical spectrum at
g = 2.0042 and the g = 4.3 signal (Figure 5C). The preimmune control in some experiments contained a low
amplitude signal that overlapped the g = 2.057 signal, but
the background structure did not match the peak-totrough positions of signals in the immunopurified CAO,
nor was it present in other samples (see Figure 4C). Analysis of immunoprecipitates from Chlamydomonas by electrophoresis revealed the heavy and light chains of IgG and
three additional polypeptides between 14 kDa and 20
kDa in mass (not shown). These polypeptides were possibly functionally associated with the enzyme but did not
react with antibodies against CAO. Preliminary evidence
obtained by mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments provided a tentative identification of the 14 kDa component
as a thioredoxin, while the analysis suggested that the 20
kDa polypeptide was a minor Lhcb. CAO migrated near
the heavy chain of IgG.
Reaction with iodide
The isotropic g = 2.0042 signal indicated the existence of
a stable radical in the protein, characteristic of the phenolate radical of tyrosine. To confirm that the radical
occurred on an amino acid residue, membrane fractions
from E. coli, Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas were incubated with Na125I, which was reported to react specifically
with tyrosine radicals [32,33], and the proteins were
resolved by electrophoresis. Radioautographic analysis of
the dried gel revealed labeling of a protein, 51 kDa in
membranes from Chlamydomonas (Figure 6A, lanes 1 and
2) and 56 kDa from Arabidopsis membranes (Figure 6A,
lanes 3 and 4). Other proteins also became labeled, in particular a 32 kDa protein, probably the reaction center protein D2, whose tyrosine radical is known to react with
iodide [32].

sample (Figure 6A, lanes 5 and 6) or after purification

Lys-51. The smaller, labeled polypeptide in lane 6, 26 kDa
in mass (marked with an asterisk), was a C-terminal fragment of CAO beginning at Pro-298. This fragment possibly resulted from a trypsin-like cleavage at Lys-296 and
removal of the subsequent N-terminal Met-297. The Nterminal sequences of the other two major polypeptides

cells was immunopurified and 125I-labeled. The sample
was digested with trypsin and the mixture was subjected
to successive cycles of N-terminal degradation. Most of
the radioactivity was released in cycle 1 (Figure 6B). The
amount of radioactivity in cycle 2 was likely the result of
incomplete transfer of the sample from the reaction vial to
the fraction collector. Essentially the same result was
obtained with CAO prepared from light-grown cells (Figure 6C). Only Tyr-422 in CAO from C. reinhardtii cw15
should be N-terminal after trypsin digestion. Similar
results were obtained with immunopurified CAO from
Arabidopsis (Figure 6D), with Tyr-518 as the corresponding residue. When the Arabidopsis CAO expressed in E. coli
was analyzed, data similar to those in Figure 6D were
obtained (not shown). The low levels of radioactivity
released in remaining cycles indicated that labeling with
125I- was highly specific and digestion with trypsin was
essentially complete.

Discussion
Role of Chl b in LHC assembly
Assembly of thylakoid membranes, and in particular of
LHCII, has been studied during initiation of membrane
formation in strains of the alga C. reinhardtii that are unable to synthesize Chl in the dark. The ability to deplete the
chloroplast of thylakoid membranes by growth in the
dark, with subsequent synthesis of Chl a and Chl b and
formation of these complexes at linear rates when cells are
exposed to light, are major advantages of this system [3436]. Results from these experiments showed that thylakoid membranes emanated from the chloroplast envelope, with generation of small vesicles [34]. Extensive
evidence for invagination and vesiculation of the inner
membrane of the envelope during chloroplast development has also been obtained with other systems [2,3739]. LHCPs, the major proteins of the membrane, were
initially detected – within minutes after initiation of chloroplast development by exposure of dark-grown cells to
light – on envelope-associated membranes by immunoelectron microscopy [21]. Transfer of energy from Chl b to
Chl a indicated assembly of LHCII during this time [21].
In the absence of Chl synthesis, LHCPs were detected in
the cytosol but not in the chloroplast by immunoelectron
microscopy [40]. This information, coupled with the
requirement of Chl b for accumulation of LHCPs [9-11],
led to the conclusion that initial events required for
import of LHCPs and assembly of LHCII occur in the
chloroplast envelope.
Localization of CAO
CAO was recovered from dark-grown Chlamydomonas cells
in membranes with a buoyant density less than that of
thylakoid membranes (Figure 2), characteristic of the
envelope inner membrane [19,41]. The mass of the CAO
protein in Chlamydomonas, estimated by electrophoresis,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/5

was the value predicted from the DNA sequence [14].
Thus, CAO seems not to be processed after integration of
the protein into the envelope membrane in the alga,
which is supported by the lack of similarity of the N-terminal sequence to a typical transit sequence such as
encoded by the gene in Arabdopsis. These results indicate
that synthesis of Chl b, an important step in LHC assembly, occurs in the envelope during the first few minutes of
greening of these cells [34,35]. This conclusion is consistent with the requirement of Chl, and in particular Chl b,
for retention of LHCPs in the chloroplast [1]. Reinbothe
et al. [42] also reported a CAO ortholog on the inner
membrane of barley etiochloroplast envelopes. Additional support for envelope localization was the EPR spectrum of purified chloroplast envelope membranes
reported by Jäger-Vottero et al. [43], which was essentially
identical to the EPR spectrum of recombinant CAO and of
CAO recovered from Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas cells
with antibodies (Figures 3, 4 and 5). Other mononuclear
iron/iron-sulfur proteins, such as Tic55, occur in the inner
envelope [44,45], which may provide the Rieske center
detected by Jäger-Vottero et al. [43] with whole envelope
membranes. A western blot of C. reinhardtii cw15 proteins
with antibodies to Tic55 did not stain a protein near the
expected size of this protein (55 kDa) but instead stained
polypeptides of about 42 and 35 kDa (not shown). The
Tic55 antibodies possibly cross-react with other iron-sulfur proteins in Chlamydomonas.
The presence of CAO in thylakoid membranes of mature
chloroplasts, as indicated by the fluorescence of the GFPfusion protein (Figure 1) suggested that CAO is
incorporated into envelope membranes after synthesis in
the cytosol and subsequently transferred to thylakoid
membranes along with other material as membrane vesicles [2,34,37,38]. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of the CAO-GFP fusion protein in
thylakoid membranes is the result of mislocalization
caused by over-expression from the CaMV35S promoter.
Other enzymes involved in Chl biosynthesis, such as Sadenosyl-L-methionine:Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase, show a dual distribution in mature chloroplasts [46,47]. These enzymes have higher specific
activities in envelope than thylakoid membranes, and vesicle traffic from envelope to thylakoid would provide a
simple explanation for these locations.
The EPR spectrum of CAO
Jäger-Vottero et al. [43] detected a g = 2.057 signal in the
spectrum of envelope membranes and showed that it disappeared as the temperature was raised to 40 K, an observation that we confirmed in our work. The g = 2.057 signal
apparently was not caused by Cu2+ in the sample,
although similar, because in contrast to the signal in the
EPR spectrum of CAO, Cu2+ can be measured at room

temperature. Moreover, the wash with EDTA should have
removed Cu2+. Jäger-Vottero et al. [43] suggested that the
sensitivity of the g = 2.057 signal to temperature was
indicative of an unusual iron-sulfur center, which may be
a modified Rieske center. The identity of this signal
remains to be confirmed.
Jäger-Vottero et al. [43] also detected a remarkably stable
radical in envelope membranes. In their experiments, the
amplitude of the radical was decreased by NADPH under
argon but increased several-fold by oxygenation of the
sample, which led to the conclusion that the radical
resulted from oxidation of a quinol cofactor to the semiquinone form. The incorporation of 125I- into the protein in
our experiments (Figure 6) instead demonstrated that the
signal emanated from the protein itself. Likely candidates
for bearing a radical are tyrosine and tryptophan residues
[48]. We attempted to identify the specific residue by its
distance from a trypsin cleavage site within the protein. As
shown in Figures 6B, 6C and 6D, most radioactivity was
released from the tryptic digest in cycle 1 with the protein
sequencer. The only tyrosine residue that should be
released in cycle 1 is Tyr-422 in the Chlamydomonas CAO
(Tyr-518 in Arabidopsis), which resides within an argininerich sequence that is conserved from the prokaryotic Protochlorothrix hollandica to higher plants (Figure 7A). The
sequence downstream of the conserved region appears
random, which highlights the apparent importance of the
tyrosine and surrounding residues. The Pro0890 gene in
the Chl b-containing prokaryote Prochlorococcus marinus
SS120 encodes a protein with predicted non-heme iron
and Rieske domains [49] that is distantly related to genes
in the CAO clade [Figure 7B]. Although this protein has
low homology to CAO in plants and algae, a tyrosine-containing sequence – R308VIVRHYRKFMKNK321-, rich in
basic amino acids, occurs C-terminal to the mononuclear
iron center and possibly has properties similar to that
indicated in Figure 7A. Putative CAO proteins in Prochlorococcus marinus MED4 and MIT9313 are phylogenetically
more related to CAO than to Tic55 [50].
The stability of the radical is impressive and does not
seem to require substrate for its formation. The relative
magnitude of the radical signal with the protein expressed
in E. coli was greater than that found with immunoprecipitated CAO from Chlamydomonas or Arabidopsis. Moreover,
CAO eluted from a gel after electrophoresis and subjected
to conditions for reconstitution of iron-sulfur centers
[51,52] generated a small radical signal (not shown). The
location of the putative radical-bearing Tyr-422 within a
sequence remarkably rich in arginine residues suggests
that the highly positively charged environment may be a
factor in stabilization of the radical. Orthologous proteins
such as Tic55 contain the conserved tyrosine but have an
adjacent acidic glutamate, while the lethal leaf spot pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/5

tein LLS1 has the tyrosine residue replaced with phenylalanine [see ref. [17] and Figure 7B]. Second-site revertants
of Chl b-less mutants of C. reinhardtii [18] raise the possibility that these proteins could attain CAO activity by
mutations in this region.
Specificity of antiserum
Antigen used for preparation of the antiserum against Arabidopsis CAO was a gel-purified, C-terminal fragment from
Ser-361 to the C-terminal Gly-536 (see Methods). The
Rieske and mononuclear iron domains, which are conserved among orthologous proteins and other redox proteins, are in the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein and
were excluded from this fragment in order to prevent
cross-reaction with these other proteins. Immunoblots of
E. coli in which CAO cDNA was expressed revealed reaction only with full-length CAO and, when present, the 26
kDa fragment of CAO shown in Figure 6A. Blots with
intact or broken chloroplasts from Arabidopsis yielded a
single band corresponding to the expected size of mature,
full-length CAO (not shown). Immunoblots of fractions
from sucrose gradients that contained envelope inner
membranes from Chlamydomonas also provided a single
immunoreactive protein (Figure 2). When used as a preparative tool, the EPR spectra of the immunoprecipitated
proteins were essentially the same as the spectrum of CAO
expressed in E. coli, which was prepared without use of the
antiserum. Also, the 125I-labeling pattern of immunoprecipitated proteins was the same as that of the protein
expressed from CAO cDNA in E. coli. These data indicate
that the antiserum used in these experiments is specific for
CAO.
Enzymatic activity of CAO
Bednarik and Hoober [53] observed conversion of Pchlide
a to Chlide b in the presence of NADPH and phenanthroline with membranes from yellow cells of C. reinhardtii y1.
An explanation for the requirement of phenanthroline in
this reaction has not been found. Pchlide b was detected
in green plants [54] and in etiolated barley seedlings when
a 7-formyl reductase activity was inhibited [55]. Pchlide b
and Chl b were also detected in Synechocystis cells after
transformation with CAO cDNA [56]. Oster et al. [57]
reported that Chlide b is synthesized from Chlide a rather
than from Pchlide, with 7-hydroxymethyl Chlide as an
intermediate, in a reaction catalyzed in vitro by recombinant CAO. However, further work is required to
establish optimal conditions for an assay in vitro and the
active substrate for CAO in vivo.

As indicated by disappearance of the radical signal upon
addition of Chl a (Figure 3A), the radical species in CAO
possibly abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate.
This type of reaction is well-known with free radicals and
is thought to initiate P450-catalyzed monooxygenation

[58]. A tyrosine radical (Em = 0.94 V) [48] would establish
a sufficiently strong redox center at the catalytic site for
oxidation of Chl(ide) a (E1 = 0.86 V) [59]. The resulting
Chl radical might then react with an oxygen complex at
the mononuclear iron center to generate the 7hydroxymethyl Chl intermediate. We have been unable to
detect sustained activity with the recombinant protein,
which suggested that it may be unable to perform more
than a single-turnover event and that essential subunits
for catalytic activity were missing. Oxygenases, whether
they contain a heme, diiron or mononuclear iron in the
catalytic center, are generally multi-subunit complexes
that contain additional proteins for transfer of electrons

from a reductant such as NADPH to the site of reaction
[e.g., references [60-62]]. In this respect, our tentative
identification of a thioredoxin and a minor Lhcb species
in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies against
CAO suggests possible avenues to achieve catalytic activity
in vitro. The possible association of Lhcb is particularly
interesting, because Chl b did not accumulate when synthesis of LHCPs was inhibited [35]. Experiments in
progress include developing an assay based on our EPR
data to understand the mechanism of this reaction.

Conclusions
Previous immunoelectron microscopic localization of initial integration of LHCPs into membranes, and the kinetics of LHC assembly, identified envelope membranes as
the site of these processes during initiation of chloroplast
development. Localization of CAO on the envelope inner
membrane provides further support for the envelope as
the primary site for LHC assembly and thylakoid biogenesis. Discovery of a stable tyrosine radical in this enzyme,
which is quenched by Chl a, suggests that synthesis of Chl
b is initiated by a radical-mediated reaction. The inability
of recombinant CAO to demonstrate significant activity
suggests that additional accessory proteins are required for
optimal catalytic oxygenase activity. These novel observations provide a foundation on which further investigations of these processes can be based.

Methods
cDNA and organisms
The Arabidopsis CAO cDNA [14] was ligated into pQE70
and expressed in E. coli strain M15/pREp4, as described by
Oster et al. [57]. Cells in 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5,
were broken by passage two times through a French pressure cell at 15 k psi. Cells of C. reinhardtii cw15, a cell-wallless strain that does not synthesize Chl in the dark, were
grown as described previously [63]. Primary leaves of twoweek old Arabidopsis thaliana (var. Col-0) were chopped
with razor blades, homogenized with a Waring blender
and filtered through cheesecloth. Samples were centrifuged at 3 kgav and supernatant fractions were centrifuged
at 200 kgav for 30 min to obtain membrane pellets.
Transient expression system and confocal microscopy
CaMV35S promoter, TMV Omega sequence and AtCAOGFP gene were introduced into the multi-cloning site of
pGreenII0029. For transient expression in pea guard cells,
25 µl of gold particles (1 µm diameter, 30 mg ml-1 in 50%
glycerol) were mixed with 5 µl of plasmid DNA (~5 µg).
After addition of 25 µl of 2.5 M CaCl2 and 10 µl of 0.1 M
spermidine, the DNA was precipitated on the gold particles at room temperature for 3 min with continuous shaking. The gold pellet was washed once in 70% ethanol
before being suspended in 30 µl of 100% ethanol. Aliquots of gold were spotted on macrocarriers and used to
transform pea guard cells at 1.3 k psi using a PDS 1000HE
biolistic device (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The
bombarded leaf was mounted on a plastic plate 24 h after
transformation and fluorescence images were recorded on
a MRC 1024 system (Bio-Rad) and an Axioplan fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped
with a Plan-Fluar100 × objective lens. A krypton-argon
laser was used as excitation source at 488 nm and fluorescence intensities at 522 and 680 nm were recorded.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/4/5

Sucrose gradient centrifugation
Membrane pellets from Chlamydomonas were suspended
in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and applied to linear sucrose
gradients, 0.4 to 1.5 M containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5,
and 1 mM EDTA. Gradients in a Beckman SW41 rotor
were centrifuged at 250 kgav for 15 h. Fractions were
collected from gradients, and after electrophoresis on 10
to 20% polyacrylamide gradient gels [64], proteins were
transblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore,
Bedford, MA) and immunostained as described previously [21].
Preparation of antibodies
Antiserum was produced against a fragment of Arabidopsis
CAO that had been fused to the maltose binding protein
using the pMAL fusion system (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA). A partial CAO cDNA clone (103D24) was
amplified with the following primers, 5'-GGAATTCAGTGTCCCAAGTTTGGTGAA-3'
and
5'-GCTCTAGATTAGCCGGAGAAAGGTAGTTT-3', which cover the region
spanning Ser-381 to the C-terminal Gly-536. The PCR
product was ligated into the pMAL-c2 vector using XbaI
and EcoRI, and the resulting plasmid insert was
sequenced. The recombinant protein (4.3 mg) was purified according to manufacturer's instructions, cleaved
with Factor Xa, and the antigen fragment was purified by
SDS-PAGE. Coomassie blue-stained gel slices were used to
produce polyclonal antiserum in rabbits by Antibodies
Inc., Davis, CA.
Immunoprecipitation
Arabidopsis leaves (10 g) were homogenized in 50 mM
Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, and filtered through cheese cloth. nDodecyl-β-D-maltoside was added to 2% (w/v) and the
sample was centrifuged at 3 kgav for 5 min to remove particulate material. The supernatant fraction (30 ml) was
incubated with 0.5 ml of antiserum against CAO for 90
min with gentle shaking. Sufficient protein A-agarose
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added to bind
all IgG in the antiserum, and the immunocomplex was
recovered after incubation for an additional 90 min by
centrifugation at 3 kgav for 5 min. An immunocomplex
was also obtained from broken, log-phase cells of C. reinhardtii cw15 as described for Arabidopsis leaves. The precipitates were washed 3 times with 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH
7.5, and one time with 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, which was
necessary to remove adventitious Mn2+.
EPR spectroscopy
Continuous wave EPR spectra were obtained with a
Bruker E580 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford
ESR900 liquid helium flow cryostat and Bruker TE102 rectangular standard cavity, at temperatures from 6 to 14 K.
Other typical measurement conditions were: magnetic

frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 5 mW for Figures
3 and 4 and 2 mW for Figure 5; microwave frequency,
9.40 GHz; horizontal resolution, 1024 points; total signal
averaging time per spectrum, about 22 min; gain, 60 dB;
time constant, 0.082 seconds. Chl a was purified from acetone extracts of Chlamydomonas cells by preparative HPLC
with methanol as the elution solvent [35], evaporated to
dryness with a stream of N2 and dissolved in a small volume of ethanol. Immediately prior to EPR analysis, samples were mixed at room temperature and then frozen in
liquid N2.
Reaction with iodide
Membrane pellets (3 to 5 mg protein) from E. coli, C. reinhardtii and A. thaliana were suspended in 50 mM Hepes,
pH 7.5, containing 50 mM NaCl, incubated with 55 kBq
carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway,
NJ) for 20 min at 25°C (50 µl final volume). Proteins
were precipitated by addition of 10 volumes of acetone,
washed 2 times with acetone, and resolved by electrophoresis [64]. Gels were dried between sheets of
BioDesignGelWrap™ (BioDesign, Inc., New York, NY) and
radioautograms were obtained with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Piscataway, NJ).
Immunoprecipitates prepared as described above from
Chlamydomonas and Arabidopsis were suspended in 200 to
400 µl 50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 50 mM NaCl,
and incubated with 3 MBq Na125I for 15 min at 25°C.
Samples were then precipitated by adding 5 vol acetone
and washed two times with acetone. Protein was recovered from agarose beads by extraction with 1% SDS in 50
mM Hepes, pH 8.0, for 1 min in a boiling water bath followed by 5 washes with buffer. Protein was recovered by
precipitation with 5 volumes of acetone and dried under
a stream of N2. Approximately 1 mg protein in 200 to 300
µl 20 mM NH4HCO3 was digested with 200 µg trypsin
(Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) for 20 h at 38°C, dried at
50°C and subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation
with a gas phase protein sequencer (model 2090, Beckman/Porton, Fullerton, CA). The amino acid derivatives
released in each sequencing cycle were collected, spotted
onto Whatman 3 MM paper, and quantitated with the
Phosphorimager and ImageQuant software (Molecular
Dynamics).
