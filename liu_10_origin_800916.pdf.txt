Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent and lethal
of the malaria parasites infecting humans, yet the origin
and evolutionary history of this important pathogen
remain controversial. Here, we used single genome
amplification (SGA) strategies to show that wild-living
African apes are naturally infected with at least nine
Plasmodium species, including one that is the direct
precursor of P.falciparum. Among nearly 3,000 ape fecal
specimens collected from 57 field sites throughout central Africa, we found Plasmodium spp. infection in
chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), but not in eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei)
or bonobos (Panpaniscus). Ape plasmodial infections
were highly prevalent, widely distributed, and almost
always made up of mixed parasite species. To obtain
Plasmodium sequences not confounded by in vitro
recombination, we used SGA to amplify fragments of
the mitochondrial (956bp of the cytochrome b gene;
3.4kb and 3.3kb half-genome fragments), apicoplast
(390bp of the caseinolytic protease C gene) and nuclear
(772bp of the lactate dehydrogenase gene) genomes.
Among more than 1,100 such sequences from 80 chimpanzee and 55 gorilla samples, we found nine that were
related to P. malariae, P. ovale or P. vivax. All others
grouped within one of six chimpanzee- or gorilla-specific
lineages representing distinct Plasmodium species within
the Laverania subgenus. One of these from western gorillas was comprised of parasites that were nearly identical
to P. falciparum. In phylogenetic trees of full-length
mitochondrial sequences, human P. falciparum formed a

monophyletic lineage within the gorilla parasite radiation.
These findings indicate that P. falciparum is of gorilla
origin and not of chimpanzee, bonobo or ancient human
origin, and that all known human strains appear to have
resulted from a single cross-species transmission event.
