Abstract
Background: Brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are phylogenetically distant from red and green algae and an
important component of the coastal ecosystem. They have developed unique mechanisms that allow them
to inhabit the intertidal zone, an environment with high levels of abiotic stress. Ectocarpus siliculosus is being
established as a genetic and genomic model for the brown algal lineage, but little is known about its
response to abiotic stress.
Results: Here we examine the transcriptomic changes that occur during the short-term acclimation of E.
siliculosus to three different abiotic stress conditions (hyposaline, hypersaline and oxidative stress). Our
results show that almost 70% of the expressed genes are regulated in response to at least one of these
stressors. Although there are several common elements with terrestrial plants, such as repression of
growth-related genes, switching from primary production to protein and nutrient recycling processes, and
induction of genes involved in vesicular trafficking, many of the stress-regulated genes are either not
known to respond to stress in other organisms or are have been found exclusively in E. siliculosus.
Conclusions: This first large-scale transcriptomic study of a brown alga demonstrates that, unlike
terrestrial plants, E. siliculosus undergoes extensive reprogramming of its transcriptome during the
acclimation to mild abiotic stress. We identify several new genes and pathways with a putative function in
the stress response and thus pave the way for more detailed investigations of the mechanisms underlying
the stress tolerance ofbrown algae.

Background

The brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are photosynthetic organisms, derived from a secondary endosymbiosis [1], that have
evolved complex multicellularity independently of other
major groups such as animals, green plants, fungi, and red
algae. They belong to the heterokont lineage, together with
diatoms and oomycetes, and are hence very distant phylogenetically, not only from land plants, animals, and fungi, but
also from red and green algae [2]. Many brown algae inhabit
the intertidal zone, an environment of rapidly changing physical conditions due to the turning tides. Others form kelp forests in cold and temperate waters as well as in deep-waters of
tropical regions [3,4]. Brown algae, in terms of biomass, are
the primary organisms in such ecosystems and, as such, represent important habitats for a wide variety of other organisms. As sessile organisms, brown algae require high levels of
tolerance to various abiotic stressors such as osmotic pressure, temperature, and light. They differ from most terrestrial
plants in many aspects of their biology, such as their ability to
accumulate iodine [5], the fact that they are capable of synthesizing both C18 and C20 oxylipins [6], their use of laminarin as a storage polysaccharide [7], the original
composition of their cell walls, and the associated cell wall
synthesis pathways [8-10]. Many aspects of brown algal biology, however, remain poorly explored, presenting a high
potential for new discoveries.
In order to fill this knowledge gap, Ectocarpus siliculosus, a
small, cosmopolitan, filamentous brown alga (see [11] for a
recent review) has been chosen as a model [12], mainly
because it can complete its life cycle rapidly under laboratory
conditions, is sexual and highly fertile, and possesses a relatively small genome (200 Mbp). Several genomic resources
have been developed for this organism, such as the complete
sequence of its genome and a large collection of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs). Although Ectocarpus is used as a
model for developmental studies [13,14], no molecular studies have been undertaken so far to study how this alga deals
with the high levels of abiotic stress that are a part of its natural environment. This is also true for intertidal seaweeds in
general, where very few studies have addressed this question.
In the 1960s and 1970s several studies (reviewed in [15])
examined the effects of abiotic stressors such as light, temperature, pH, osmolarity and mechanical stress on algal growth
and photosynthesis. However, only a few of the mechanisms
underlying the response to these stressors - for example, the
role of mannitol as an osmolyte in brown algae [16,17] - have
been investigated so far. Developing and applying molecular
and biochemical tools will help us to further our knowledge
about these mechanisms - an approach that was suggested 12
years ago by Davison and Pearson [18]. Nevertheless, it was
only recently that the first transcriptomic approaches were
undertaken to investigate stress tolerance in intertidal seaweeds. Using a cDNA microarray representing 1,295 genes,
Collén et al. [19,20] obtained data demonstrating the up-reg-

ulation of stress-response genes in the red alga Chondrus
crispus after treatment with methyl jasmonate [19] and suggesting that hypersaline and hyposaline stress are similar to
important stressors in natural environments [20]. Furthermore, in the brown alga Laminaria digitata, Roeder et al.
[21] performed a comparison of two EST libraries (sporophyte and protoplasts) and identified several genes that are
potentially involved in the stress response, including the
brown alga-specific vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases
and mannuronan-C5-epimerases, which are thought to play a
role in cell wall modification and assembly. These studies
have provided valuable information about the mechanisms
and pathways involved in algal stress responses, but they
were nevertheless limited by the availability of sequence
information for the studied organisms at the time.
With the tools and sequences available for the emerging
brown algal model E. siliculosus, we are now in a position to
study the stress response of this alga on the level of the whole
transcriptome. For this, we have developed an EST-based
microarray along with several tools and annotations (available on our Ectocarpus transcriptomics homepage [22]), and
used this array to study the transcriptomic response of E.
siliculosus to three forms of abiotic stress: hyposaline, hypersaline, and oxidative stress. Hypersaline stress is a stress
experienced by intertidal seaweeds - for example, in rockpools at low tide (due to evaporation) or due to anthropogenic
influences - and is comparable to desiccation stress. Hyposaline stress is also common in the intertidal zone, and can
arise, for example, due to rain. Furthermore, organisms with
a high tolerance to saline stress can inhabit a wide range of
habitats. E. siliculosus strains have been isolated from locations covering a wide range of salinity. A specimen was found
in a highly salt-polluted area of the Werra river in Germany,
where chloride concentrations at times reached 52.5 grams
per liter [23]. At the same time, E. siliculosus can be found in
estuaries, in the Baltic sea, and one strain of E. siliculosus was
isolated from freshwater [24]. Oxidative stress is commonly
experienced by living organisms. Reactive oxygen species
(ROSs) are produced intracellularly in response to various
stressors due to malfunctioning of cellular components, and
have been implicated in many different signaling cascades in
plants [25]. In algae, several studies have demonstrated the
production of ROSs in response to biotic stress (reviewed in
[26]). Therefore, protection against these molecules is at the
basis of every stress response and has been well studied in
many organisms. We simulated this stress by the addition of
hydrogen peroxide to the culture medium.

Results
Determination of sub-lethal stress conditions
The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms that
allow short-term acclimation to abiotic stress. To be sure to
monitor the short-term response to stress rather than just cell
death, the intensity of the different stresses needed to be cho-

sen carefully. Using a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer (see Materials and methods), we measured the effects of
different stress intensities on photosynthesis. Figure 1 shows
the change in quantum yield of photosynthesis in response to
different intensities of the different stresses, where values of
over 0.5 indicate low stress. The quantum yield can vary during the course of the day even under controlled conditions, as
changes in light have a strong impact on this parameter.
Stress conditions were chosen to have a clear effect on the
photosynthesis rate, but to be sub-lethal, allowing the alga to
acclimate and recover. The conditions that corresponded best
to these criteria were 1.47 M NaCl (hypersaline condition,

12.5% seawater, and 1 mM H2O2 (oxidative stress condition),
although, for this last stressor, we can assume that the H2O2
concentration in the medium decreases over the course of the
experiment. Each stress was applied for 6 hours because this
corresponds to the time span between high and low tide. In
addition, experiments carried out on land plants [27] and red
algae [19] have indicated that the application of stress for 6
hours induces the most marked changes in transcription.
Initially, we had considered a fourth stress condition, 2 M
sorbitol in artificial sea water (ASW), to imitate the osmotic
pressure of the hypersaline treatment without the possible
effects of the salts. However, this treatment was not included
in the final experiment because cultures did not survive this
treatment for 6 hours. For the other stresses, we observed
100% recovery of photosynthesis after about 6 days, even
after 24 hours of stress (Additional data file 1).

Apart from the photosynthetic activity, we also measured
intracellular osmolarity and Na+ concentrations (Figure 2).
After 6 hours of exposure to different salinities, the intracellular osmolarity was always about 500 mOsm higher than
that of the extracellular medium. The intracellular Na+ concentration was about 500 mM lower than in the extracellular
medium under hypersaline stress, 60 mM lower under control conditions, and the same under hyposaline stress. Oxidative stress had no detectable effect on the intracellular ion
composition or osmolarity (data not shown).

red (1,470 mM NaCl, 12.5% seawater, and 1 mM H2O2) were the
conditions chosen for the microarray analysis.

The E. siliculosus microarray represents 17,119
sequences
We designed a microarray based on 90,637 ESTs obtained by
sequencing clones from 6 different cDNA libraries: immature
sporophyte (normalized and non-normalized), mature sporophyte, immature gametophyte, mature gametophyte, and
stress (sporophyte). Cleaning and assembly resulted in the
generation of 8,165 contigs and 8,874 singletons. In addition,
21 genomic sequences and 231 E. siliculosus Virus 1 (EsV-1)
genes were included. The array design file has been deposited
under the accession number [ArrayExpress:A-MEXP-1445]
and is also available on our Ectocarpus transcriptomics
homepage [22].
Of the 17,119 genes represented on the array, 12,250 gave a
significant signal over background in our experiments and
were considered to be expressed under the conditions tested.
The analysis focused on these 12,250 genes (see Materials and
methods). A first comparison with the data obtained from a
tiling experiment with E. siliculosus (MP Samanta and JM
Cock, personal communication), where 12,600 genes were
considered strongly expressed, demonstrates that our array
offers a rather complete coverage of at least the highly transcribed parts of the E. siliculosus genome, suggesting that we
are working at the whole genome scale.

cDNA synthesis and amplification provided consistent
results with both mRNA and total RNA samples
For reasons as yet unknown, cDNA synthesis reactions with
E. siliculosus are inhibited at high concentrations of RNA.
Therefore, we decided to synthesize cDNAs from a small
quantity of total RNA or mRNA, and to include a PCR amplification step in the protocol to obtain sufficient doublestranded cDNA (4 μg) for each hybridization. A comparison
of the four four-fold replicates synthesized from 30 ng of
mRNA and the single four-fold replicate synthesized from
100 ng total RNA showed that these two protocols yielded
similar results. All total RNA replicates clustered with the
mRNA replicates of the same stress (data not shown). Nevertheless, at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, 163 transcripts
gave significantly different results with the two types of sample. These transcripts represented mainly constituents of the
ribosome, as revealed by a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) Orthology Based Annotation System
(KOBAS) analysis and by an analysis of overrepresented GO
terms (Additional data file 2).

Validation of microarray results using quantitative
PCR
Nineteen genes that exhibited significant changes in their
expression patterns in the microarray analysis were analyzed
by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Eighteen of these
had similar expression profiles in both the microarray experiment and the RT-qPCR experiment (correlation coefficient r
of between 0.57 and 0.99; Table 1). Only one gene, which
codes for a microsomal glutathione S-transferase, displayed a
different pattern in the two experiments (r = -0.48). Furthermore, the seven most stable 'housekeeping genes' as identified by qPCR in a previous report [28] showed only
statistically non-significant relative changes of <1.5-fold
(log2-ratio <0.58) in the microarray experiment (Table 2).
This demonstrated that the protocol for cDNA amplification
provided reliable measures of the relative transcript abundances. Although this method has been successfully applied
in several small-scale expression studies [29-35], to our

knowledge, the use of this technique has not been reported
with commercial photolithographically synthesized arrays.

Ribosomal protein genes are among those whose
transcript abundances are least affected by stress
The 100 most stably expressed genes in these microarray
experiments included 51 genes with unknown functions.
Nineteen genes code for ribosomal proteins, and 21 genes are
known housekeeping genes with functions related to protein
turnover (transcription, 4 genes; translation, 3 genes; degradation, 3 genes), energy production (6 genes), and the
cytoskeleton (5 genes). For a detailed list of these most stably
expressed genes, please see Additional data file 3.

Classification of stress response genes using automatic
annotations
Overall, 8,474 genes were identified as being differentially
expressed in at least one of the conditions compared to the
control, allowing a FDR of 10% (5,812 were labeled significant
at an FDR of 5%). As can be seen in Figure 3, the relative
change for these genes ranged from 1.2-fold (log2-ratio ≈0.3)
to more than 32-fold (log2-ratio >5). Of these 8,474 genes,
2,569 (30%) could be automatically annotated with GO terms
using the GO-term Prediction and Evaluation Tool (GOPET)
[36] and 1,602 (19%) with KEGG orthology annotations using
the KOBAS software [37]. These automatic annotations were
analyzed for each stress condition individually, to identify GO
categories and KEGG pathways that were significantly overrepresented.
The KOBAS results (Figure 4; Additional data file 4) indicated
that under hyposaline and hypersaline stresses most of the
changes involved down-regulation of the synthesis and
metabolism of amino acids. More precisely, genes involved in
the synthesis of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, as well as that
of the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan), and arginine and proline metabolism were affected.
This effect on amino acid synthesis was less marked for oxidative stress, where glutamate metabolism was the only

amino acid metabolism affected. Under hypersaline conditions, there was also an increase in transcripts coding for
enzymes that metabolize valine, leucine, and isoleucine. In
addition, photosynthesis and vesicular transport seemed to
be altered by both hyposaline and oxidative stress. Pathways
that appeared to be specifically affected by one stress
included the up-regulation of fatty acid metabolism and
down-regulation of translation factors under hypersaline
stress, the up-regulation of the proteasome and down-regulation of nitrogen metabolism under hyposaline stress, and an
increase in glycerophospholipid metabolism under oxidative
stress (Figure 4). A complete list of the pathways identified is
available in Additional data file 4, with possible artifacts arising from the automatic annotation marked in grey.
The GOPET analysis (Table 3; Additional data file 5) was
focused on the molecular function of the individual genes
rather than their role in a specific pathway. Only three GO
terms were identified as being over-represented among the
up-regulated genes: arginase and agmatinase activity under
hypersaline conditions, and microtubule motor activity under
oxidative stress. Most GO terms were found to be significantly

over-represented among the down-regulated genes. In agreement with the down-regulation of amino acid metabolism
identified by the KOBAS analysis, we observed a decrease in
the abundance of transcripts encoding aminoacyl-tRNA
ligases in hypersaline and hyposaline conditions using the
GOPET annotations. Also, under hypersaline stress, we
observed down-regulation of genes associated with the GO
terms RNA binding and translation factor activity, which corresponds to the KEGG category translation factors, and
down-regulation of transcripts coding for proteins with a CTP
synthase activity, which are involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism. Under hyposaline stress, we observed that
NAD(P)+ transhydrogenases, a number of transferases and
oxidoreductases involved in amino acid metabolism, as well

pathways 'photosynthesis-antenna proteins' identified by
KOBAS. Under oxidative stress, using the GOPET annotations, we detected down-regulation of several different categories of transferases, nitrate transporters, oxidoreductases
involved in steroid metabolism, and 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase-like enzymes that are involved in amino acid metab-

significantly up- or down-regulated pathways. Also in contrast to the KOBAS results, no GO terms were significantly
over-represented among the genes identified as being up- or
down-regulated in both oxidative and hypersaline stresses, or
in all three stresses at the same time.

Manual classification of stress response genes with the
most significant changes in expression
To identify the most important mechanisms involved in the
stress response, we manually classified and examined in
detail 966 genes that exhibited the most significant changes
in one of the stress conditions compared to the control (that
is, genes that meet both criteria: significance at an FDR <1%
and a relative change in expression of more than two-fold). A
complete list of these genes, including their putative function,
assigned manually based on sequence homology of the corre-

sponding genome sequence to public protein databases, can
be found in Additional data file 3.
We identified 519 genes (53.7%) with no homologues in either
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
databases or other heterokont genomes (e-value > 1e-10). An
additional 122 genes (12.6%) code for conserved genes with
unknown function. Of these 122 conserved genes, 23 (18.9%)
are conserved only within the heterokont lineage. The
remaining 325 genes (33.6%) were divided into 12 groups
according to their putative functions in amino acid metabolism, DNA replication and protein synthesis, protein turnover, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis-related
processes, fatty acid metabolism, transporters, vesicular trafficking and cytoskeleton, classical stress response pathways,
autophagy, signaling, and other processes. The following sec-

tion gives a brief overview of the different groups of genes
identified among the most significantly regulated genes.
Among genes involved in amino acid metabolism, we found a
total of 32 down-regulated genes related to the metabolism of
all 20 standard amino acids except aspartic acid. In contrast,
nine genes were induced in at least one abiotic stress condition. These were involved in the metabolism of proline,
arginine, cysteine, alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Highly regulated
genes involved in the different steps of DNA replication and
protein synthesis coded for proteins, including helicases,
DNA polymerases and related enzymes, proteins involved in
purine and pyrimidine synthesis, DNA repair proteins, transcription factors, RNA processing enzymes, proteins involved
in translation, ribosomal proteins, and proteins for tRNA synthesis and ligation. Most of these genes were down-regulated
in all stress conditions, but some genes were up-regulated in
response to abiotic stress. These genes include some helicases, transcription factors, and DNA repair proteins. We also
found seven genes related to protein turnover to be down-regulated and six to be up-regulated in one or more of the stress
conditions. Among the up-regulated genes, there were two
ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, which play a potential role in
targeting damaged proteins to the proteasome, or control the
stability, function, or subcellular localization of proteins.
The situation was similar for genes involved in carbohydrate
metabolism, where we found both glycolysis- and citric acid
cycle-related genes to be strongly down-regulated under all
the stresses tested (six and seven genes down-regulated,
respectively). However, four genes, encoding a gluconolactonase, a xylulokinase, a phosphoglycerate kinase, and an isocitrate lyase, were up-regulated. In particular, an isocitrate
lyase gene was 19- to 212-fold up-regulated under the different stress conditions. Photosynthesis-related genes that were

regulated in response to abiotic stress included eight chlorophyll a/c binding proteins as well as genes responsible for the
assembly of photosystem 2, electron transport, light sensing,
and carotenoid synthesis. Many of these genes were strongly
affected in the hypersaline condition, with the majority being
down-regulated (17 versus 11 that were up-regulated). There
was at least one gene that was up-regulated under one or
more stress condition in every group. Genes with roles in fatty
acid metabolism altered their expression patterns in a similar
way under all stress conditions. We were able to distinguish
between two groups: three genes involved in the synthesis of
fatty acids, which were down-regulated; and genes functioning in the degradation of fatty acids, among which five of six
genes were up-regulated. We further observed that three
genes involved in lipid synthesis were up-regulated, and
genes involved in inositol metabolism were also affected.
With respect to transporters, we identified five genes encoding nitrogen transporters (all down-regulated) as well as
three genes encoding sugar transporters (all up-regulated).
Genes coding for ion transporters were also mainly down-regulated under hypersaline and hyposaline conditions,
although two potassium and magnesium transporter genes
were up-regulated under hypersaline stress. Among genes
responsible for the transport of solutes and proteins to the
mitochondrion, we observed an up-regulation mainly in the
hyposaline stress condition. Regarding genes related to vesicular trafficking and the cytoskeleton, we identified 13 up- and
6 down-regulated genes, many of these genes containing an
ankyrin repeat domain and showing strongest changes in
transcription under hyposaline and oxidative stress conditions.
We further found several classical stress response genes to be
up-regulated. Four genes coding for heat shock proteins
(HSPs) were up-regulated mainly under hyposaline and oxi-

Genome Biology 2009,

dative stress, but there were also two genes coding for a chaperonin cpn60 and a prefoldin, each of which was downregulated. In addition, we found genes involved in protection
against oxidative stress to be induced. These include a glutaredoxin (oxidative stress), a methionine sulfoxide reductase
(hyposaline stress), and three glutathione peroxidases
(mainly hypersaline stress). At the same time, however, a catalase-coding gene was down-regulated in all stress conditions, most strongly under hyposaline stress.
Two genes involved in autophagy, one of which is represented
by two sequences on the microarray, were up-regulated in all
stress conditions and several genes with putative signaling
functions were affected. Six protein kinases were among the
most significantly up-regulated genes: three equally under all
stress conditions, and one each specifically under hyposaline,
hypersaline and oxidative stress. Furthermore, one protein
kinase and one WD-40 domain containing gene were downregulated under hyper- and hyposaline stress, respectively.
Several other genes are not mentioned here, either because
only a very vague prediction of their function was possible, or
because they are difficult to put into categories with other
genes. More detailed information about these genes can be
found in Additional data file 3.

Stress response genes with unknown functions
All unknown and conserved unknown genes present among
the most significantly regulated genes were sorted into
groups according to their sequence similarity (Additional
data file 6). Among the groups with three or more members,
there were three (I to III) that had no known homologs in species other than E. siliculosus, and three (IV to VI) for which
we were able to find homologs in other lineages for most of
the sequences. A more detailed description of all of the
unknown and unknown conserved stress response genes,
including an analysis of conserved protein and transmembrane domains, is available in Additional data file 6.

Known brown algal stress genes
Many of the brown alga-specific stress response genes identified in L. digitata by Roeder et al. [21] were not among the
most regulated genes identified in this study. Nevertheless,
we decided to examine their expression patterns in more
detail. The array used in this study contained probes for one
vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase (CL83Contig2), but
this gene was not strongly regulated under the different stress
conditions (1.06-fold to 1.4-fold induced, P = 0.75). Twentyfour C5-epimerases were represented, but none of these
genes were among the most significantly regulated loci,
although several of them were either induced or repressed
under the different stress conditions. A detailed list of these
genes, including their expression profiles, can be found in
Additional data file 7. Finally, we decided to consider genes
involved in the synthesis of mannitol, a well-known osmolyte
in brown algae [16,17]. Only one enzyme specific to the syn-

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R66

Dittami et al. R66.10

thesis of this polyol could be clearly identified based on
sequence homology: mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase
(see [38] for a description of the mannitol synthesis pathway
in brown algae). Our array contains probes for two genes
identified as potential mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenases: one (CL200Contig2 corresponding to Esi0017_0062
in the Ectocarpus genome), which was among the most significantly regulated genes and six-fold down-regulated in
hyposaline condition, and one (CL2843Contig corresponding
to Esi0020_0181), which was generally expressed at a very
low level but was up-regulated approximately five-fold under
hypersaline stress (P = 0.066).

Clusters of genes with similar expression patterns
Based on a figure of merit (FOM) graph, we decided to divide
the set of expressed genes into seven different clusters (A to
G). These clusters, along with the GO terms and KEGG pathways that are over-represented among each of them, are
shown in Figure 5. We identified one cluster (A) representing
the stably expressed genes, three clusters included mainly upregulated genes (B-D), and the remaining three clusters
included mainly down-regulated genes (E-G). Among both
the up- and down-regulated clusters, we found one cluster
each that was equally affected by all stress conditions (B and
E), one each where gene expression was affected only by
hyposaline and oxidative stress conditions (C and G), and one
cluster each where gene expression was affected mainly by
hypersaline stress (D and F). Most of the principal functions
identified for each cluster by GOPET and KOBAS fit well with
the results from our earlier analysis of the up- and down-regulated genes.

Discussion

This study presents the first global gene expression analysis
of a brown alga. Our goal was to determine the transcriptomic
changes in response to short-term hypersaline, hyposaline
and oxidative stress - three stresses that play an important
role in the natural habitat of many brown algae, the intertidal
zone [20,26]. Our results show that almost 70% of the
expressed genes had a modified expression pattern in at least
one of the examined stress conditions. This is in contrast to
what has been observed in flowering plants, where the proportion of significantly regulated genes generally ranges from
1% to 30%, depending on types of abiotic stress examined,
their number, and the statistical treatment applied (see
[27,39,40] for some examples). Our findings demonstrate
that, rather than relying on a few specific stress response proteins, E. siliculosus responds to abiotic stress by extensive
reprogramming of its transcriptome.
A more detailed analysis of the manual annotation of the 966
most significantly regulated genes and the results for the
GOPET and KOBAS analysis for all three stress conditions,
reveals two major themes concerning the short-term stress
response of E. siliculosus: down-regulation of primary

metabolism and growth processes; and activation of energy
stores and of genes and pathways involved in 'stress management'. These findings are summarized in Figure 6. In the following sections we will first discuss the differences observed
between the different stress conditions that were tested, and
then highlight some of the general trends that emerged from
our data.

Comparison of stress conditions
We have compared each stress condition to the control condition, and analyzed these results using KOBAS and GOPET.
Due to the necessity to control the FDR with multiple testing,
the chance of beta-errors (that is, the chance of falsely labeling a gene or a pathway as not significantly regulated) greatly
increased, making a direct comparison of the genes and
groups of genes identified as being up- or down-regulated
under the different stress conditions prone to false conclusions. Therefore, we based our comparison of the different

stresses on the cluster analysis and the results from the manually analyzed 966 most significantly changing genes.
The first and most apparent observation from the clustering
was that the changes in gene expression induced by hyposaline and oxidative stress were more similar to each other than
to those observed under hypersaline stress. One explanation
for this might be that hypersaline stress, although it is a common stressor in the natural habitat of brown algae, is not
likely to occur at the same intensity in the field as that used for
our laboratory experiments (about three times the concentration of normal seawater). Even though we did not observe a
strong difference in the efficiency of photosynthesis under the
different stress conditions, it is possible that hypersaline
stress, at the intensities applied in our experiments, represents a condition the alga is less able to adjust to. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that in cluster F (down-regulated
in hypersaline conditions) cell cycle-related genes were overrepresented, indicating that growth was most strongly

affected under hypersaline stress conditions. Furthermore,
other classical stress responses, such as the up-regulation of
SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor)-related genes, which are important for cellular transport of vesicles and their fusion with membranes and
play a role in plant development and abiotic stress response
[41], were observed mainly under oxidative and hyposaline
stress.
There are also several smaller differences between oxidative
and hyposaline stress, such as the induction of a glutaredoxin
gene (Additional data file 2) under oxidative stress conditions. Glutaredoxins are known to play a central role in the
protection against oxidative damage [42], as they can be oxidized by diverse substrates, including ROSs, and are reduced
by glutathione. Other genes did not change expression under
oxidative stress, but were specifically regulated under saline
stress. Such examples are given in the following paragraphs.

Down-regulation of growth and primary metabolism
Many genes involved in several pathways related to growth
and primary metabolism were identified to be down-regulated by more than one of our analyses (GOPET, KOBAS, kmeans clustering, and manual analysis). We observed a
decrease in the abundance of transcripts of genes that are
important in the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and, correspondingly, of several genes responsible for
the replication of DNA. This function is essential for cell division, a process affected in all of the stress conditions examined.
A reduction in growth implies a reduction in the requirements for primary metabolites necessary to fuel this growth.
Within our dataset, we found widespread evidence for downregulation of processes involved in primary metabolism. This
was most pronounced in the case of protein synthesis. Several
genes encoding enzymes involved in this and related proc-

esses (the synthesis of amino acids, their ligation with the
appropriate tRNAs, the production of mRNA (that is, transcription), and the actual assembly of polypeptide chains
(that is, translation)) were down-regulated under stress conditions. Furthermore, genes responsible for the uptake of
nitrogen, which is used mainly for the synthesis of amino
acids, were also down-regulated. Together, this provides a
strong indication that the overall rate of protein synthesis was
reduced under the stress conditions examined.

bohydrates when non-lipid-derived storage reserves are
depleted. Corresponding to this and the up-regulation of
autophagy-related genes, we observed an up-regulation of
three genes coding for sugar transporters in all stress conditions and of genes coding for mitochondrial exchange proteins under the hyposaline and oxidative stress conditions.
These transporters may direct recycled sugars and nutrients
to the mitochondrion, where they can be used for energy production.

However, there were additional primary metabolic processes
that were at least partially affected by the stress treatments.
These included the synthesis of fatty acids, photosynthesis
and pigment synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism. Again,
these changes probably reflected a decreased need for metabolites for growth.

Recently, additional roles of autophagy have been discovered
in higher plants, including the degradation and removal of
oxidized or damaged proteins during stress [47]. To a certain
degree, these roles overlap with the role of the proteasome.
Although we found some genes involved in protein turnover
to be down-regulated, the KEGG pathway 'proteasome' was
identified as up-regulated in the hyposaline stress condition
and we identified two genes involved in ubiquitination among
the most significantly up-regulated genes under all stress
conditions. Ubiquitination is a process in which proteins are
labeled with a small polypeptide (ubiquitin) [48], thereby
modifying their stability, function, or subcellular localization.
This could serve regulatory purposes (for example, by targeting transcription factors or other regulatory proteins for degradation by the proteasome), accelerate translation of the
large-scale transcriptomic changes into changes in protein
abundance, and/or, just like autophagy, facilitate nitrogen
recycling [49].

One possible explanation for the observed down-regulation of
genes involved in growth and primary metabolism can be
found in the results of our pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer experiment: we observed that the efficiency of photosynthesis decreased almost immediately after the application
of the stress treatments. Photosynthesis is strongly affected
by environmental stress [43]. A decrease in photosynthetic
efficiency is synonymous with a decrease in energy production, and we can assume that reducing all of these aspects of
primary metabolism might represent a means of conserving
energy. This phenomenon is known in higher plants, where
Kovtun et al. [44] have reported cross-talk between oxidative
stress and auxin signaling, auxin being a major growth hormone in higher plants. Most likely, this cross-talk allows
plants to shift their energy from growth-related processes to
stress protection and survival. This might also be true for E.
siliculosus, where the observed down-regulation of growthand primary metabolism-related genes might represent a way
of compensating for reduced energy production under stress
conditions and redirecting energy to specific stress response
processes.

Activation of protein degradation, energy stores, and
nutrient recycling
We observed an up-regulation of two genes involved in
autophagy in all three of the stresses examined. Under nutrient-limited and under stress conditions, this process has been
shown to play a role in the re-allocation of sugar and nutrients
to essential biological processes in several organisms [45].
The activation of autophagy-related genes might, therefore,
just like the down-regulation of growth-related processes,
represent a mechanism of compensating for reduced energy
production under stress conditions and provide sugars and
nutrients for both core biological processes and synthesis of
stress proteins. This coincides with the strong up-regulation
of an isocitrate lyase gene under all stress conditions. Isocitrate lyases are enzymes located in the glyoxysome and catalyze a rate-controlling step in the glyoxylate cycle (reviewed in
[46]), one function of which is the conversion of lipids to car-

Activation of signaling pathways
Large-scale transcriptomic reprogramming as observed in
our dataset most certainly requires a large number of signals
for coordination. We have already discussed a possible regulatory role of ubiquitination in the previous paragraph. This,
however, is not the only regulatory mechanism highlighted by
the transcriptomic changes in our dataset. We found several
other genes that might play roles in orchestrating the abiotic
stress response of E. siliculosus. For example, three protein
kinases with a potential role in cell signaling were strongly
up-regulated under all stress conditions, while three other
members of this large family appeared each to be specific to
one particular stress. Furthermore, several potential transcription factors were strongly regulated under different
stress conditions. Since there is still very little known about
the molecules and proteins involved in the stress sensing signaling cascades of brown algae, these genes provide particularly interesting candidates for more targeted experiments
such as targeted mutagenesis and chromatin immunoprecipitation in the case of the putative transcription factors.
In addition to transcription factors and protein kinases, we
detected an up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid
metabolism, and more specifically fatty acid catabolism. Fatty
acid derivates such as oxylipins have been shown to function
in signaling in both terrestrial plants [50] and marine algae
[51]. Thus, we can conclude that our data show an up-regula-

tion of genes putatively involved in several different signaling
pathways.

Synthesis of 'classical' stress response proteins
The only medium throughput transcriptomic analysis of the
abiotic stress response in brown algae so far [21], conducted
with protoplasts of L. digitata, reported the transcriptional
activation of vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases and
C5-epimerases. Neither of these genes was regulated in our
study. While in L. digitata vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidases (enzymes implicated in the synthesis of halogenated
organic compounds associated with defense of seaweeds
against biotic stressors [52]) comprise a multigenic family
[21], the E. siliculosus genome contains only a single copy of
a vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase, indicating a possibly different or subordinate role in this organism. Regarding
C5-epimerases, which are enzymes responsible for the modification of brown algal cell walls [10] highly represented in the
Ectocarpus genome, we observed differences in regulation
between the study of Roeder et al. [21] and our study. This can
be explained by the nature of the stress (generation of protoplasts (that is, removal of the cell wall) in [21] versus milder
saline or oxidative stress in our study).
Generally, only a few 'classical' stress response genes changed
expression in our experiments. In most organisms, up-regulation of genes coding for HSPs and other chaperones has
been observed under abiotic stress conditions. These molecules stabilize proteins and membranes, and have been
shown to play a vital role in protecting against stress by reestablishing normal protein conformation and, thus, cellular
homeostasis [53]. In E. siliculosus, we observed four HSPs or
chaperones to be among the most significantly up-regulated
genes in hyposaline and oxidative stress conditions. However, this was not the case under hypersaline stress conditions. Moreover, two chaperone-like proteins were downregulated under all stress conditions. The situation was similar for genes coding for proteins with antioxidant activity.
Three genes coding for glutathione peroxidases were up-regulated under hypersaline and oxidative stress, and one glutaredoxin under hyposaline stress. At the same time, two genes
encoding a glutathione S-transferase and a catalase were
among the most significantly down-regulated in all stress
conditions. Consequently, the GO term 'antioxidant activity'
was significantly over-represented among the most downregulated genes in the hyposaline condition. In flowering
plants all of these proteins are known to carry out important
functions in the protection against reactive oxygen species
[25]. Our finding that these genes were not induced was, at
first, surprising, but is in accordance with a transcriptomic
analysis of the abiotic stress response of the intertidal red alga
C. crispus. Collén et al. [20] have reported that the average
expression of HSP-coding genes was only moderately elevated (approximately 1.3-fold) under hypersaline and
hyposaline conditions. Furthermore, in E. siliculosus, the
average expression of genes coding for proteins with antioxi-

dant activity was slightly repressed (1.17-fold) under hyposaline stress conditions and slightly induced under hypersaline
stress conditions (1.15-fold). One possible explanation for this
might lie in the fact that transcriptional regulation is not the
most important mechanism regulating the activity of these
enzymes. This hypothesis would be compatible with an earlier
study by Collén and Davison [54], who found that the cellular
activity of ROS scavenging enzymes correlated with vertical
zonation of different species of the brown algal order Fucales
in the intertidal zone. To our knowledge, it is currently not
known whether the activity of the ROS scavengers that were
examined also changes upon exposure to abiotic stress. Such
studies could greatly aid our understanding of the role of
these enzymes in the brown algal stress response.
An alternative or additional explanation to that of non-transcriptional mechanisms regulating the activity of ROS scavenging enzymes could be that other, yet unknown proteins
and mechanisms play more important roles in the defense
against ROS in brown algae. One candidate for this kind of
protein could be the chlorophyll a/c binding proteins. Thirty
chlorophyll a/c binding proteins were represented on our
microarray, most of them being down-regulated mainly
under hyposaline and oxidative stress conditions. As chlorophyll a/c binding proteins serve as light-harvesting antennae,
this down-regulation is likely to represent a response to the
reduced photosynthesis efficiency (quantum yield) under
stress conditions. Reducing the amount of energy that
reaches the photosynthetic reaction center would also reduce
the need for non-photochemical quenching and decrease the
risk of the formation of ROS. However, there were also three
genes coding for chlorophyll a/c binding proteins among the
most significantly up-regulated genes under hyposaline and
hypersaline stresses. A similar observation was made by
Hwang et al. [55] in the Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros
neogracile, where heat stress induced the up-regulation of
five and the down-regulation of ten genes coding for chlorophyll a/c binding proteins. It is possible that these up-regulated chlorophyll a/c binding proteins, in spite of their high
sequence similarity with the other transitionally down-regulated ones, have evolved or are evolving to serve different
functions within the heterokont lineage.

Ions and potential osmolytes
In parallel to the induction of 'classical' stress response genes,
we observed the transcriptional regulation of several genes
involved in the synthesis or degradation of potential organic
osmolytes and the transport of ions under saline stress.
Under hypersaline stress, changes in the extracellular salt
concentration as well as cell volume are likely to cause imbalances in ion concentrations, explaining the need for transporters to maintain homeostasis. Two genes coding for a
magnesium and a potassium transporter were up-regulated
specifically under hypersaline stress. Interestingly, we did not
observe transcriptional activation of sodium transporter
genes under salt stress, although many glycophytes (non- or

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R66

moderately salt tolerant terrestrial plants) use these transporters to exclude NaCl from their cytosol, allowing a certain
degree of salt tolerance [56]. The latter observation suggests
that the large quantities of NaCl accumulated upon exposure
to saline stress (Figure 2) are stored within the cytoplasm
rather than in the vacuole. A similar observation was made by
Miyama and Tada [57] in the Burma mangrove. In this tree,
exposure to sub-lethal NaCl stress did not cause an activation
of Na transporters but led to a slow increase of the NaCl concentration in the leaves. One possible explanation for this, as
proposed by Miyama and Tada [57], is that NaCl itself could
serve as an osmolyte within the cells of the Burma mangrove.
This may also be true for brown algae - a hypothesis that is
strengthened by the observation that, in Ectocarpus as well as
in Lamninaria [58] and the Burma mangrove [57], sorbitol,
added at the same osmolarity as NaCl, had irreversible toxic
effects.
While there is no evidence of the synthesis of additional compatible osmolytes in the Burma mangrove, we observed an
increasing difference between intracellular osmolarity and
intracellular Na+ concentration with rising salinity in E. siliculosus, demonstrating the accumulation of other osmotically
active substances in the cell. Mannitol has frequently been
suggested to be a compatible osmolyte in brown alga [16,17],
and indeed, one of the two mannitol 1-phosphate-dehydogenases in E. siliculosus was down-regulated in hyposaline
stress, and the other up-regulated in hypersaline stress
(though with a weak P-value of 0.066). In addition, under
hyposaline conditions, we observed a strong up-regulation of
a proline dehydrogenase gene (Additional data file 3), an
enzyme responsible for the degradation of proline, which is
known as a compatible osmolyte in higher plants [59] and
diatoms [60]. Degrading proline under conditions of low
salinity might help E. siliculosus to reduce the osmotic pressure between the intracellular and extracellular medium.
Finally, a possible role of urea as a compatible osmolyte was
suggested in diatoms [61]. E. siliculosus possesses the complete urea cycle and genes encoding arginases were up-regulated in hypersaline conditions. As arginases catalyze the last
reaction of this cycle - that is, the degradation of arginine to
ornithine and urea - their up-regulation supports the hypothesis of urea as a compatible osmolyte in heterokonts. There
are, however, other or additional possible roles of arginases:
in higher plants, for example, arginases have been shown to
play a regulatory role in nitric oxide metabolism, increasing
both the synthesis of proline and polyamines [62], both of
which, in turn, are part of their osmotic stress response [59].
Additional experiments addressing the question of the possible compatible osmolytes in brown algae - for example,
metabolite profiling - are now required to further test these
hypotheses.

Stress response genes with unknown functions
Although our study has revealed several major themes underlying the abiotic stress response of E. siliculosus, we should

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R66

Dittami et al. R66.15

not forget that this analysis was based on only a subset of the
genes that actually changed expression. Our manual analysis
of the 966 of the most significantly regulated genes has shown
that 53.7% of these genes, to date, have no known homologs
in current databases, including diatoms, and for another
12.6% there is no indication of their function, even though
homologs exist in other organisms. This demonstrates both
the discovery potential working with E. siliculosus and the
amount of work that lies ahead for the phycological community.

Conclusions

In this study, which presents the first large-scale transcriptomic study within the brown algal lineage, we have developed and compiled the tools and protocols necessary to
perform microarray experiments in the emerging model
brown alga E. siliculosus, and used these tools to study the
transcriptional response to three different stresses. Our
results show that E. siliculosus undergoes large-scale transcriptomic reprogramming during the short-term acclimation to abiotic stress. The observed changes include several
modifications to transcription, translation, amino acid
metabolism, protein turnover, and photosynthesis, and indicate a shift from primary production to protein and nutrient
recycling.
Although E. siliculosus shares many stress responses with
flowering plants, for example, the induction of genes involved
in vesicular trafficking, some classical stress responses, such
as the induction of several ROS scavengers, could not be
observed. On the other hand, our data highlighted many
novel reactions such as the up-regulation of several genes
coding for chlorophyll a/c binding proteins or the regulation
of a large percentage of unknown genes, many of which are
unique to E. siliculosus. In particular, the latter result, that is,
that the functions of two-thirds of the regulated genes are
unknown, underlines the fact that many of the molecular
mechanisms underlying the acclimation to environmental
stresses in brown algae are still entirely unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is a challenge that will still
require much research, and our study provides a valuable
starting point to approach this task.

Materials and methods
Growth conditions, stress treatments, and
measurements of osmolarity and Na+ concentration
E. siliculosus (Dillwyn) Lyngbye (Ectocarpales, Phaeophyceae) unialgal strain 32 (accession CCAP 1310/4, origin San
Juan de Marcona, Peru) was cultivated in 10-liter plastic
flasks in a culture room at 14°C using filtered and autoclaved
natural seawater enriched in Provasoli nutrients [63]. Light
was provided by Philips daylight fluorescence tubes at a photon flux density of 40 μmol m-2 s-1 for 14 h per day. Cultures
were bubbled with filtered (0.22 μm) compressed air to avoid

CO2 depletion. Ten days before the stress experiments, tissues
were transferred to ASW with the following ion composition:
450 mM Na+, 532 mM Cl-, 10 mM K+, 6 mM Ca2+, 46 mM
Mg2+, 16 mM SO42-.
Three different stress media were prepared based on ASW.
For hyposaline stress, ASW was diluted to 12.5% of its original
concentration with distilled water, resulting in a final NaCl
concentration of 56 mM. For hypersaline stress, ASW with a
final concentration of 1.47 M NaCl was used. For oxidative
stress, H2O2 (30% w/w; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
was added to the ASW immediately before beginning the
stress experiment at a final concentration of 1 mM. Identical
quantities of Provasoli nutrients were added in each of these
media.
In order to monitor the intensity of a stress, we measured the
quantum yield, a fluorometric marker for the photosynthetic
efficiency, using a Walz Phyto-pulse amplitude modulation
fluorometer (Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany) and default parameters (actinic light intensity 3, approximately 90 μE m-2 s-1;
saturation pulse intensity 10, approximately 2,000 μE m-2 s-1,
200 ms) before harvesting the cultures.
The stress experiment was started by filtering 20 liters of
ASW-acclimated E. siliculosus and transferring approximately 4 g of tissue each to 20 flasks (5 replicates per condition) containing 1 liter of one of the three stress media or the
control medium (ASW with Provasoli nutrients). After 6 h the
content of each flask was harvested by filtration, dried with a
paper towel, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Immediately after harvesting, about 300 mg (wet weight) of
sample were thoroughly ground at room temperature (RT)
and centrifuged for 1 minute at 16,000 g. Both the supernatant and a sample of the culture medium were then used to
measure the concentration of osmolytes employing a freezing
point depression osmometer (Osmometer Type 15, Löser
Messtechnik, Berlin, Germany), and to determine the intracellular concentration of Na+ with a FLM3 flame photometer
(Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Sequence preparation and array design
The 90,637 EST sequences used for the microarray design
were cleaned using Phred [64] (trim-cutoff 0.05) and SeqClean and assembled using TGICL [65] and default parameters. Forty-one sequences that had been removed by Phred
were re-included in the dataset, because they had significant
BLAST hits with known eukaryotic proteins. In addition, 231
E. siliculosus virus 1 (Es-V1) sequences and 21 genomic intron
sequences were included in the design. All assembled
sequences are available directly from our homepage [22] and
the ESTs have been deposited in public databases [EMBL:
FP245546-FP312611]. Relevant accession numbers are listed
in Additional data file 8.

Volume 10, Issue 6, Article R66

Dittami et al. R66.16

Four 60-mere probes were designed for 17,119 of the 17,332
sequences (132 genes are not represented on the array) by
Roche NimbleGen (Madison, WI, USA) and synthesized on 4plex arrays with 72,000 features per hybridization zone.
Roche NimbleGen also carried out cDNA labeling and hybridization as part of their gene expression array service.

Automatic annotation and correspondence table
All sequences were automatically annotated with KEGG
orthology (KO) numbers using KOBAS [37] and with GO
terms [66] using GOPET [36]. Protein sequences corresponding to the assembled EST sequences were then predicted
using ORF predictor [67]. The automatic annotation of these
sequences yielded 2,383 and 3,148 annotated sequences,
respectively. As 37.5% of the cDNA sequences that were represented on the array contained mainly, or exclusively, 3'
untranslated region sequence, their function could not be
assessed directly. In these cases the corresponding genome
sequence was annotated, yielding an additional 1,047 KO and
2,743 GO annotations. The correspondence table used to
relate the assembled ESTs to supercontigs was generated by
blasting all of the assembled EST sequences against the full E.
siliculosus genome (coding and non-coding sequences) and
selecting the best hit (best identity, longest alignments).
Wherever this best hit was part of a predicted coding
sequence (CDS), the corresponding CDS was chosen. In cases
where the hit region was upstream of only one CDS, this CDS
was chosen. In some cases the best hit was located upstream
of two CDSs on opposite strands. Here the closest CDS was
selected, if the distance to the closer CDS was half as long as
or shorter than that to the other CDS. Otherwise no corresponding genome sequence was selected. In total, 3,430
(20%) of all represented genes were annotated with KEGG
and 5,891 (34%) were annotated with GO terms.

Sample preparation, hybridization and verification
RNA was extracted from approximately 100 mg (wet weight)
of tissue following Apt et al. [68] with modifications as
described by Le Bail et al. [28], using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based buffer and subsequent phenolchloroform purification, LiCl-precipitation, and DNAse
(Turbo DNAse, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) steps. RNA quality
and quantity was then verified on 1.5% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide and a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop products, Wilmington, DE, USA).
For four of the five flasks, mRNA was isolated from the total
RNA using the PolyATtract® mRNA Isolation System III
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). These samples were concentrated in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant, Ramsy, MN, USA)
and again quantified using the NanoDrop. One replicate was
used to verify if our procedure would directly work from total
RNA.
Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized and amplified with
the SMART cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech, Mountain View,
CA, USA) and the M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes,

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R66

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/6/R66

Genome Biology 2009,

Espoo, Finland) starting from 30 ng of mRNA or 100 ng of
total RNA. In this kit, the first strand of cDNA is synthesized
using an oligo(dT) primer with an attached SMART priming
site. The terminal C-transferase activity of the reverse transcriptase will create an oligo(dC) tail at the 5' end of each
mRNA, which is used to add a second SMART priming site.
The two priming sites are then used to produce the second
strand of the cDNA and to amplify it by PCR according to the
Clontech protocol, using the Advantage2 polymerase (Clontech). The optimal number of amplification cycles was determined by semi-quantitative PCR, and ranged between 20 and
25 for our samples.
The PCR reactions were purified by first vortexing with one
volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), then
by precipitating the aqueous phase with 0.5 volume of 7.5 M
NH4OH, 6 μg of nuclease-free Glycogen (Ambion), and 2.4
volumes of ethanol. After centrifugation at RT (20 minutes at
14,000 g), the pellet was washed with 70% EtOH, centrifuged
(10 minutes at 14,000 g and RT) and resuspended in 14 μl of
H2O. To finish, cDNAs were once more quantified and
checked on an agarose gel to ensure that they met the requirements of Roche NimbleGen for hybridization (concentration
>250 μg l-1, A260/280 ≥ 1.7, A260/230 ≥ 1.5, median size ≥ 400
bp).
RT-qPCR validation of the microarray was performed as
described by Le Bail et al. [28].

Statistical analysis
Expression values were generated by Roche NimbleGen using
quantile normalization [69], and the Robust Multichip Average algorithm [70,71].
To increase the power of subsequent statistical tests, nonexpressed genes were removed from the dataset. This was
done by comparing the raw expression values of each gene
with those of the random probes included in the array design
by Roche NimbleGen. Most of the random probes (>99.66%)
had raw expression values inferior to 450, so all genes that
had raw expression values over 450 in one of the replicates of
the different experimental conditions were considered
expressed. The probability p' of labeling a non-expressed
gene as being expressed can be calculated according to the
laws of a binomial distribution. Since 16 hybridizations were
considered, for our dataset p' equals 5.3%, meaning that we
have theoretically removed 94.7% of all genes without detectable expression.
The most stable genes were defined by ranking the genes
according to the sum of squares of the log2-ratios of all stress
conditions with the control. Differentially expressed genes
were identified in the reduced dataset by t-test using
TigrMEV 4.1 [72] with subsequent calculation of the FDR
according to Benjamini and Hochberg [73]. Clustering was
performed on the log2-ratios of all expressed genes with the

control, considering all mRNA replicates using TigrMEV 4.1.
A k-means algorithm [74], 'Euclidian distance', and 'average
linkage' were selected. The ideal number of clusters for our
dataset (k = 7) was determined using a figure of merit graph
[75]. After clustering, the different replicates were averaged
to generate the expression graphs. Both the clusters and the
over-expressed and repressed genes identified by the t-test
(FDR 10%) were analyzed to identify over-represented groups
of genes. Over-expressed KEGG categories were identified
using the KOBAS web-site [37] and a binomial test. Over-represented GO terms were identified using the GO Local Exploration Map (GOLEM) software (version 2.1) [76] and the
Benjamini and Yekutieli algorithm to determine the FDR
[77]. Additionally, the 966 genes that showed the most significant changes in expression (that is, genes that meet both criteria: significance at an FDR <1% and a relative change in
expression compared to the control of more than twofold)
were annotated and grouped manually.

Stress response genes with unknown functions
Genes were considered unknown stress response genes if they
significantly changed expression in at least one stress treatment compared to the control (FDR <1%, more than twofold
change compared to the control) and when, for both the
assembled EST sequence itself and for the corresponding
genome sequence, no BLAST hits were found in either the
NCBI databases or among the known heterokont genomes
(Phytophthora sojae, P. ramosum, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and Phaeodactylum tricornutum). Where homologs
(e-value < 1e-10) were found, but these homologs had no
functional annotations, genes were considered conserved
unknown stress response genes. To group these genes, all
unknown stress response genes and conserved unknown
stress response genes were blasted against themselves using
the NCBI BLAST program (version 2.2.18) [78] and a cut-off
e-value of 1e-10. If there were several alignments between two
genes, only the alignment with the lowest e-value was considered. Self-hits were removed. All groups of genes with
homologs among the (conserved) unknown stress response
genes in E. siliculosus were then visualized using Cytoscape
2.6.0 [79]. Their subcellular localizations were identified
using HECTAR [80] and transmembrane domains were
searched for using TMAP [81].
