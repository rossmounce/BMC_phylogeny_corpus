Abstract
Background: The family Camelidae that evolved in North America during the Eocene survived with two
distinct tribes, Camelini and Lamini. To investigate the evolutionary relationship between them and to
further understand the evolutionary history of this family, we determined the complete mitochondrial
genome sequence of the wild two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus ferus), the only wild survivor of the
Old World camel.
Results: The mitochondrial genome sequence (16,680 bp) from C. bactrianus ferus contains 13 proteincoding, two rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes as well as a typical control region; this basic structure is shared by
all metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Its protein-coding region exhibits codon usage common to all
mammals and possesses the three cryptic stop codons shared by all vertebrates. C. bactrianus ferus
together with the rest of mammalian species do not share a triplet nucleotide insertion (GCC) that
encodes a proline residue found only in the nd1 gene of the New World camelid Lama pacos. This lineagespecific insertion in the L. pacos mtDNA occurred after the split between the Old and New World
camelids suggests that it may have functional implication since a proline insertion in a protein backbone
usually alters protein conformation significantly, and nd1 gene has not been seen as polymorphic as the
rest of ND family genes among camelids. Our phylogenetic study based on complete mitochondrial
genomes excluding the control region suggested that the divergence of the two tribes may occur in the
early Miocene; it is much earlier than what was deduced from the fossil record (11 million years). An
evolutionary history reconstructed for the family Camelidae based on cytb sequences suggested that the
split of bactrian camel and dromedary may have occurred in North America before the tribe Camelini
migrated from North America to Asia.
Conclusion: Molecular clock analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes from C. bactrianus ferus and L.
pacos suggested that the two tribes diverged from their common ancestor about 25 million years ago,
much earlier than what was predicted based on fossil records.

Background
The family Camelidae has two Old World (tribe
Camelina) species, bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus)
and dromedary (C. dromedaries), and four New World
(tribe Lamini) species, guanaco (Lama guanicoe), llama (L.
glama), alpaca (L. pacos) and vicuna (L. vicugna or Vicugna
vicugna) at present time [1,2]. The wild bactrian camel (C.
bactrianus ferus) appears to be the only wild survivor of the
Old World camel. According to the fossil record, Camelidae evolved in North America during the Eocene, approximately 40–45 million years ago [2], and the division
between Camelini and Lamini occurred in North America
about 11 million years ago [3,4]. In the late Tertiary (the
epoch Pliocene) the species of Camelini and Lamini
migrated from North America to South America and Asia
separately, and their ancestors became extinct in North
America subsequently. However, there have been very few
molecular studies due to difficulties in either obtaining
enough DNA samples or acquiring enough sequence
information. Previous molecular studies, mainly focusing
on the sequence of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, have
made significant contributions to understanding the evolutionary history of Camelidae [2], and yet there has not
been any significant comparative studies on the evolutionary relationship between Camelini and Lamini.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been proven useful for
studying evolutionary relationships among animal species, due to its conservativeness in protein-coding
sequences, high substitution rate in its non-coding
sequences, and lack of genetic recombination [5,6]. To
investigate the evolutionary relationship between
Camelini and Lamini, we have made an unprecedented
effort to obtain adequate samples from the wild twohumped camel, sequenced its mitochondrial genome
completely, and carried out detailed sequence and evolutionary analyses.

that of L. pacos. The minor length variation mainly
occurred in the tandem repeat (ACGTAC)n of the control
region. The gene order and content are identical to those
of other mammals (Figure 1); it harbors 13 protein-coding genes (three subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase,
seven subunits of the NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase
complex, one subunit of the ubiquinol cytochrome b oxidoreductase complex, and two subunits of ATP synthases), the small and large ribosomal RNA genes, and 22
tRNA genes (Table 2). The replication origin of the light
strand within a tRNA gene cluster was also unambiguously identified.
Protein-coding genes
We carefully annotated 13 protein-coding genes (Table 2),
including start and stop codons (ten ATGs, three ATAs,
seven TAAs, two TAGs, and one AGA). Three of them,
cox3,nd3, and nd4, do not have normal stop codons but
have the cryptic components, T, TA, and T, respectively.
The possession of such noncanonical start and stop
codons is shared by most of the vertebrate mitochondrial
genomes. These T or TA stop codon components are supplemented via posttranscriptional polyadenylation later
in the cellular translation process [7]. Another common
feature among vertebrate mitochondrial genomes is the
existence of overlapping genes; for instance, ATP6 and
ATP8 share a 42-bp sequence.

The mitochondrial genome of the wild camel shares its
genetic code with other vertebrates (Table 3). In this
mtDNA, the codon CTA for leucine is the most frequently
used (277 times) and the codon CGT for arginine is the
least frequently found (7 times) even though both amino
acids are separately encoded by six and four codons in the
canonical genetic code. The codons ending with A or T are
used more frequently than those ending with G or C since
it has a high A+T (57.9%) content similar to what have
been found among other mammals.

Results
Genome organization
Since mammalian mitochondrial genome sequences are
very similar, we designed a set of PCR primers based on
highly conserved sequences of an alignment with fulllength mitochondrial genomes from the available public
data, including those of cow, deer, sheep, pig, and lama
(Table 1). We sequenced some of the PCR-amplified DNA
segments first to obtain as much authentic sequences as
possible from the wild two-humped camel, and subsequently designed new primers according to the newly
acquired sequences. We collected 119 raw sequence traces
with an average length of 521 bp at a quality value of Q20,
which cover the entire genome four folds.

The full-length mitochondrial genome is 16,680 bp in
length [GenBank: EF212038], which is 28 bp longer than

Transfer RNA genes
We identified 22 tRNA genes in mtDNA of the wild camel;
21 of them were predicted capable of folding into the cloverleaf structure and possess anticodons that match the
vertebrate mitochondrial genetic code (Figure 2A). Only
one of them, tRNAser lacks the appropriate sequence elements for forming an orthodox cloverleaf structure as well
as both dihydrouridine loop and the anticodon (Figure
2B). Although it has been predicted that this tRNAser gene
(for AGN) may be a pseudogene as observed among other
metazoan mitochondrial genomes and some of them
were proven inactive [8], efforts have been made to
uncover underlying molecular details as to how serine residues are actually added into peptide chains with this
"bizarre" tRNA [9].

Non-coding sequences
Among vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, most of the
non-coding sequences are part of the control region,
about 700–1,300 bp in length, responsible for the regulation of replication and transcription [10]. The control
region shows extensive variability across taxonomic
groups and even among related species, but its sequence
elements related to regulatory functions are known to be

highly conserved. We annotated the 1,247-bp control
region and regulatory domains; at the 5' end, we found
termination-associated sequence (TAS) motifs that act as
a signal for terminating synthesis of the D-loop strand
[11,12]. The sequence between bactrian camel and alpaca
showed less similarity as expected (Figure 3). We also discovered all eight putative conserved sequence blocks
(CSB1-3 and B-F) that are important to the regulation of
mtDNA replication [12]; among them, CSB1 and CSBC-F
are conserved among mammals, whereas CSB2 and CSB3
are absent from some of them.
Mitochondrial DNA variations in camelidae
To investigate mitochondrial DNA variations in Camelidae, we compared the two complete sequences from the
wild camel and alpaca; the comparison yielded 1,522
transitions and 389 transversions when excluding the
highly variable control region. We also identified 26 single nucleotide indels (insertions or deletions) from noncoding RNA sequences. The most striking observation was
a codon indel (GCC) encodes proline residue found in the
nd1 gene between C. bactrianus ferus and L. pacos. This
indel, upon further scrutiny, is actually an insertion in the
L. pacos mtDNA but absolutely absent in the rest of mammalian mtDNA collection. In other words, it is lineagespecific to the New World L. pacos, suggesting that an
insertion event occurred after the Old and New World
Camelidae split. Furthermore, our comparative analyses
showed a relatively lower ratio of nonsynonymous substitution (Ka) to synonymous substitution (Ks) in cox1, cox2,
cox3, and cytb genes (Table 4), whereas a large number of

H and L refer to heavy and light strains of the mitochondrial genome, respectively.

nonsynonymous substitutions were observed in nd2, nd3,
nd4, nd4L, and atp6 gene sequences, especially in the atp8
gene. This result indicates that the ND family and ATP
synthase genes may evolve faster than other genes among
the 13 protein-coding ones. This pattern is not universal
among all mammalian mitochondrial genomes and suggests its functional relevance for mitochondrial biology.
To our surprise, the nd1 gene that harbors the codon insertion in L. pacos does not appear to have higher mutation
rate as compared to other ND family genes in its mtDNA.
Phylogenetic analyses
To date the divergence time between Camelini and Lamini, we aligned complete mtDNA sequences of the wild
camel and alpaca as well as other selected mammals. We

then constructed a phylogenetic tree from these aligned
sequences by using those of rat and mouse as outgroup
(Figure 4). Since the control region of mtDNA has a high
incidence of homoplasy [5,13], we excluded it for this
analysis. Similar topology was obtained with both neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. Bootstrap
values and Bayesian posterior probabilities were showed
for all clades.
Estimating divergence time can be done with or without
assuming a constant rate evolutionary rate among all
compared clades. Since evolutionary rate of Camelidae
mitochondrial genomes has not been well-studied, we
tested the rate constancy in Camelidae using mtDNA
excluding the control region. We first performed Tajima's

relative rate test, using cow as an outgroup. Molecular
clock analyses are highly sensitive to evolutionary distance between main clades and the choice of an outgroup
is of importance [14]. The result rejected the assumption
of a constant rate of change among the camelid mitochondrial genomes (p < 0.01, unpublished data). To further
confirm this conclusion, we used likelihood ratio method
for a similar test (Materials and Methods), and showed
obvious differences in the evolutionary rate between the
two tribes (without rate constancy LnL1 = 38557.259972; with rate constancy LnL2 = 38550.07554; P < 0.01).
Since these studies pointed out that the assumption of
rate constancy might not be appropriate for estimating
divergence time between Camelini and Lamini, we used a
heuristic rate smoothing procedure for ML-based estimates [15], which takes into account evolutionary rates
among different branches of the tree. We used two calibration points, 65 and 14 million years, which were the esti-

mated timing for the divergence of cow-pig (artiodactyl
calibration) and mouse-rat (outgroup calibration),
respectively [16,17]. Average rates for the wild camel and
alpaca were 1.2% per million years and 0.9% per million
years, respectively. Therefore, the divergence time
between Camelini and Lamini was estimated to be 25 million years, significantly earlier than what was estimated
based on fossil records (11 million years). This result suggested that the divergence of the two tribes might occur in
the early Miocene [2,4].
We also constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the cytb
gene sequences from the wild camel and other camelids,
and looked into other possibilities (Figure 5). Similarly,
we used the two calibration points, 65 and 14 million
years, and performed a maximum likelihood procedure to
estimate divergence time. In tribe Camelini, the divergence time of bactrian camel and dromedary was estimated as 8 million years, whereas in tribe Lamini, alpaca
diverged from the other three species about 10 million

ago.

Discussion

between bactrian camel and other mammals (Table 5).
The difference within a taxonomic group is as significant
as among groups. For example, the rate for bactrian camel
is significantly different from that for alpaca, so does the
rate between bactrian camel and cow.

Although the mitochondrial genome of the wild twohumped camel is highly similar to those of other mammals, there are substantial differences in the mtDNA evolutionary rate for different taxonomic groups. Relative rate
tests demonstrated the evolutionary rate also varies

The divergence time for Camelini and Lamini was estimated to be 25 million years or in the early Miocene. This
estimate is significantly earlier than what were suggested
based on the fossil record in North America [2,4]. In tribe

an older lineage that evolved to become the current species about 10 million years ago. In contrast, guanaco and
llama diverged from their common ancestor much later,
about 1.4 million years ago in the early Pleistocene; this
divergence occurred after Lamini species migrated from
North America to South America [2,4].

All nodes were supported by the bootstrap value (1000 replications) and posterior probability on the nodes (above the

Camelini, we estimated that speciation of bactrian camel
and dromedary may have begun 8 million years ago. If the
time of the camel migrating from North America to Asia
estimated based on the fossil material is correct (3 million
years) [2,4], the speciation of the genus Camelus may

The mtDNA of C. bactrianus ferus is very similar to that of
other mammals. It contains 13 protein-coding, two rRNA,
and 22 tRNA genes as well as a typical control region.
Molecular clock analyses on complete mitochondrial
genomes from C. bactrianus ferus and Lama pacos suggested
that the two tribes diverged from their common ancestor
about 25 million years ago, much earlier than what were
suggested based on fossil record. The evolutionary history
of Camelidae, reconstructed by using cytb sequences, suggested that the speciation of bactrian camel and dromedary may have occurred in North America before they
migrated to South America and subsequently left the continent.

Methods
Specimens, DNA amplification, and sequencing
The samples (ear punches) from the wild two-humped
camel were collected in the Gobi area (the Trans-Altai
Gobi of Mongolia as described by Sanduin 2002) of Mongolia in 2006. Genomic DNA was extracted according to
the proteinase K/phenol extraction method. A PCR-Based
approach for mitochondrial genome sequencing was used
([18]. The PCR primers used for initial amplification were
designed based on conserved known mammalian
sequences from the public databases, and new primers
were also designed according to the newly generated
sequence data for finishing the entire genome.

The standard PCR was conducted in a 25 μl reaction volume that contains 1–2 U Taq DNA polymerase, 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 0.25 mM dNTPs, 0.2–2 mM BSA, 1.5–
2.5 mM MgCl2, 20 pM of each primer, and about 10 ng
camel genome DNA. The PCR reaction conditions were
set as: 94°C for the first 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of
94°C denaturation for 30s, 50°C annealing for 30s, and
72°C extension for 45s. The PCR were accompanied by
negative controls containing the reaction solutions without DNA.

Phylogeny of the cytb sequences
Phylogeny of the Camelidae species based on maximum likelihood analysis of cytb sequences. To estimate the divergence
time, pairwise comparisons of cow-pig and mouse-rat were
taken as the ingroup and outgroup calibration points, respectively. All nodes were supported by the bootstrap value
(1000 replications) on the nodes.

The thermo-cycling sequencing reaction was performed in
a final volume of 24 μl containing 16 μl DYEnamic ET Terminator Sequencing Kit premix, 10 pM sequencing primers, and 500 μg DNA. The reaction conditions were 95°C
for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C denaturation for
15s, 50°C annealing for 15s, and 60°C extension for 90s.
The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced on ABI-

3730 DNA sequencer. The primers for PCR reaction were
used for sequencing. DNA sequences were assembled by
using the software package phred/phrap/consed/[19,20]
on a PC/UNIX platform. The mitochondrial sequences
were annotated with BLAST tools, and tRNA genes and
their secondary structures were identified according to
tRNAscan-SE [21].

phylogenetic analysis and other mammals used for comparison and PCR primer designs were obtained from the
NCBI database. Multiple alignments were performed with
the CLUSTAL W [22]. Alignments of all protein-coding
genes were used to estimate variation rates at synonymous
(dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) sites with a maximum
likelihood (ML) method [15] implemented in
Ka_Ks_Calculator [23].

The phylogenic trees were reconstructed separately
according to the neighbor-joining method implemented
in MEGA [24] and the maximum likelihood method
implemented in PHYLIP [25]. The reliability of the
branches was assessed by bootstrap analysis (1000 replications). Bayesian posterior probability of phylogeny was
done with MrBayes (mcmc ngen = 1000000) [26]. Two
different prior models were used: the General Time
Reversible model and the HKY model.
Rate constancy was tested with the Tajima's [27] and likelihood ratio tests. The likelihood ratio test was done with
the baseml program in PAML. Two parameters of no
molecular (clock = 0 in baseml) and the local clock (clock

= 2 in baseml) were used to test molecular clock. When
bactrian camel and alpaca were tested, cow was used as
outgroup. To estimate the divergence time, a heuristic rate
smoothing procedure for ML estimates was used as implemented in PAML [15]
