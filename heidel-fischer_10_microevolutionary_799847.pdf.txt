Microevolutionary dynamics of a
macroevolutionary key innovation in a
Lepidopteran herbivore

Abstract
Background: A molecular population genetics understanding is central to the study of ecological and evolutionary
functional genomics. Population genetics identifies genetic variation and its distribution within and among
populations, it reveals the demographic history of the populations studied, and can provide indirect insights into
historical selection dynamics. Here we use this approach to examine the demographic and selective dynamics
acting of a candidate gene involved in plant-insect interactions. Previous work documents the macroevolutionary
and historical ecological importance of the nitrile-specifier protein (Nsp), which facilitated the host shift of Pieridae
butterflies onto Brassicales host plants ~80 Myr ago.
Results: Here we assess the microevolutionary dynamics of the Nsp gene by studying the within and amongpopulation variation at Nsp and reference genes in the butterfly Pieris rapae (Small Cabbage White). Nsp exhibits
unexpectedly high amounts of amino acid polymorphism, unequally distributed across the gene. The vast majority
of genetic variation exists within populations, with little to no genetic differentiation among four populations on
two continents. A comparison of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in 70 randomly chosen genes
among P. rapae and its close relative Pieris brassicae (Large Cabbage White) finds Nsp to have a significantly relaxed
functional constraint compared to housekeeping genes. We find strong evidence for a recent population
expansion and no role for strong purifying or directional selection upon the Nsp gene.
Conclusions: The microevolutionary dynamics of the Nsp gene in P. rapae are dominated by recent population
expansion and variation in functional constraint across the repeated domains of the Nsp gene. While the high
amounts of amino acid diversity suggest there may be significant functional differences among allelic variants
segregating within populations, indirect tests of selection could not conclusively identify a signature of historical
selection. The importance of using this information for planning future studies of potential performance and fitness
consequences of the observed variation is discussed.

Background
Studying plant-insect interactions provides an opportunity to investigate the coevolution of species on a molecular, ecological, and evolutionary level. While ecologists
are interested in the overall dynamics and interactions
between plants and their insect herbivores, biochemical
and molecular level studies focus on the genes and gene
products that actually interact between these species
groups [1]. Ecological and evolutionary functional genomics (EEFG) combines these approaches in an

evolutionary framework, integrating the study of gene
function and the fitness consequences of genetic variation [2]. A molecular population genetics understanding
is central to EEFG study, as it identifies genetic variation
and its distribution within and among populations,
reveals the demographic history of the populations studied, and can provide indirect insights into historical
selection dynamics. Here we use this approach to obtain
conclusions regarding the demographic and selective
dynamics acting upon a candidate gene involved in plant
insect interactions. We then discuss how this understanding is critical to designing future studies of potential
fitness consequences due to candidate gene variation.

Our previous research identified a novel gene used by
butterflies to detoxify their otherwise toxic host plants,
called nitrile-specifier protein (Nsp) [3]. Macroevolutionary study indicates that the evolution of Nsp was a coevolutionary key innovation in plant insect interactions
[4]. In order to extend these insights down to a microevolutionary level where we can eventually directly examine ongoing selection dynamics, here we present the
results of a molecular population genetic study of Nsp
in Pieris rapae (small cabbage white) butterflies (Pieridae, Lepidoptera) which feed upon flowering host plants
in the Angiosperm order Brassicales.
Brassicales plants present a formidable anti-herbivore
defense system, where the enzyme myrosinase upon tissue damage catalyzes the hydrolysis of its glucosinolate
substrates to toxic end products [5-7]. Thorough studies
of Brassicales plants, most notably on the model species
Arabidopsis thaliana and relatives, have identified a
complex array of molecules involved in this activated
chemical defense system [5,8]. A diversity of myrosinases exist in some Brassicales plants [6], which can be
accompanied by a variety of cofactors and coenzymes,
resulting in the hydrolysis of glucosinolates to variable
end products which can influence feeding behavior
[9-11]. Additionally, myrosinase concentration in a
given plant tissue has been shown to affect herbivore
feeding [8,11]. Glucosinolate diversity is also an important factor driving adaptive evolution. Methylthioalkylmalate synthases (Mam), encoded by the Mam gene
cluster, control an early step in the synthesis of glucosinolates and are responsible for a major part of the glucosinolate diversity in the Brassicaceae family by
controlling side chain elongation [12-16]. Within the
Mam gene family, gene duplication, neofunctionalization and positive selection drive biochemical diversification [12]. Recent study documents the increase in
glucosinolate complexity along the Brassicales

phylogeny, suggesting that chemical defense complexity
increased over time [17] (and unpublished data from
Wheat et al.)
While our understanding of the plant side of this
plant-insect interaction is well developed, we lack a
similar depth of knowledge on the insect side. However,
the identification of the Nsp gene that enables Pieridae
butterfly larvae to circumvent the activated chemical
defense of Brassicales plants has begun to provide
important insights [3]. Nsp is expressed in the midgut of
the caterpillars and promotes the formation of nitriles
rather than toxic isothiocyanates upon the hydrolysis of
glucosinolates. Nsp is a unique detoxifying gene that
shows no homology to any known detoxifying enzyme
[18]. Macroevolutionary studies identified Nsp as a key
biochemical innovation in the Pieridae family, with a
single evolutionary origin likely < 10 million years after
the appearance of the Brassicales plants (~90 million
years ago) which corresponds to a significantly increased
speciation rate of Pieridae lineages which feed upon
Brassicales [4].
Nsp has a distinct three-domain structure (Fig. 1) and
its enzyme activity is only found in Brassicales feeding
Pieridae species [4]. It belongs to an insect specific gene
family designated the Nsp-like gene family, with members having varying numbers of domain structure
repeats [18]. Recent research has found the Nsp-like
gene family to have complex birth-death dynamics, with
Nsp paralogs differing in their biochemical activity,
genomic location, and copy number within and among
species. Additionally, of 5 Pierinae genera surveyed, 4
independent gene duplications of Nsp-like genes have
been identified. When Nsp duplication is placed within
the temporal context of increasing glucosinolate complexity of the Brassicales, Nsp diversification appears to
be an important component of the evolution of this
detoxification gene family.

Thus, although previous macroevolutionary study indicates that the first appearance of Nsp was a key event in
the host shift of pierid butterfly ancestors from Fabaceae
to Brassicales feeding [4], and that Nsp continued to
evolve along with glucosinolate complexity (and unpublished data from Wheat et al.), we know nothing about
the modern day, population level dynamics of Nsp with
respect to the highly variable and complex activated
plant defense system of the Brassicales. Here, we begin
to address microevolutionary questions by conducting a
molecular population genetic study in P. rapae, from
which we originally identified the Nsp gene.
P. rapae is a highly abundant species native to Europe
with up to four generations per year in temperate zones.
A high dispersal ability coupled with feeding on common agricultural plants (e.g. rape seed and cabbage) has
enabled it to spread rapidly and successfully colonize
Australia, New Zealand and North America within the
last 120 years [19-21]. P. rapae caterpillars have over 17
reported host plants within the Brassicales, and in particular Brassicacaeae, and thus encounter a high diversity
of glucosinolate-myrosinase systems which vary in all
the previously discussed components.
Several hypotheses emerge when considering the possible microevolutionary dynamics and patterns of diversity at the Nsp gene. For comparative purposes, Nsp and
a set of reference genes (likely to be experiencing normal purifying selection and reflecting demographic
effects) were sequenced from the same individuals: four
nuclear coding enzymes, as well as a mitochondrial
gene, from ten individuals from each of four populations
(Italy, France, Germany, and North America). Additionally, the divergence between P. rapae and P. brassicae
(large cabbage white) among 70 randomly chosen genes
was compared with the divergence at Nsp. These datasets allow us assess patterns of genetic diversity at Nsp,
the demographic history of these populations, and the
relative support for alternative hypotheses of historical
selection at the P. rapae Nsp locus (Table 1).
Our alternative hypotheses of selection begin with a
working null hypothesis that assumes no historical
selective differences among Nsp variants, with current
patterns of genetic variation at Nsp solely reflecting
demographic effects such as population structure or

Page 3 of 14

historical population expansion (H0-demography).
Hypothesis one (H1-local adaptation) expects the P.
rapae Nsp locus to be involved in local host plant adaptation, showing unique alleles in each population with
greater variation among than within populations.
Hypothesis two (H2-diversifying/balancing selection)
proposes a high diversity of the P. rapae Nsp locus
across all populations due to P. rapae being a highly dispersive generalist, encountering a diverse spectrum of
host plants across its range. This hypothesis thus predicts a greater diversity within populations than among
them. A further hypothesis (H3-directional selection)
assumes low diversity in the P. rapae Nsp locus both
within and across populations, due to strong purifying
selection on the P. rapae Nsp locus coupled with selective sweeps since diverging from a recent ancestor.

Methods
Biological material

Ten P. rapae adults were collected in the wild at each of
three different locations in Europe in the summer of
2002. In Germany (DE) samples were taken 1 km north
of Jena, in France (FR) from 50 km northeast from
Lyon, and in Italy (IT) from 15 km south of Modena.
An additional ten P. rapae adults were collected in
Ithaca, New York, USA (US) in the summer of 2007.
Thus, a total of 40 butterflies were kept at -20Â°C until
their DNA was isolated.
DNA Extraction and PCR

Abdomens of the adult butterflies were homogenized
with a TissueLyser (Eppendorf) in the buffer system
provided by the genomic DNA extraction kit (Qiagen),
and the genomic DNA isolated using genomic tip 20/G
columns and the genomic DNA extraction Kit following
the manufacturerâs protocol (Qiagen). The Eppendorf
Master Mix (Eppendorf) was used for the amplification
of the desired gene. The PCR products were extracted
using a DNA purification kit following the manufacturerâs protocol (Zymogen). PCR amplicons were cloned
into the pCR II TOPO vector (Invitrogen) with six
clones picked per individual and sequenced for all genes
with the exception of Arginine KInase and Wingless,
where the PCR amplicons were directly sequenced.

Amplified genes

The study species P. rapae only posseses one Nsp locus,
designated as Pra Nsp. Two segments of the Pra Nsp
gene located adjacent to each other were amplified from
genomic DNA, here referred to Pra Nsp-D2 and Pra
Nsp-D3 (Fig. 1). The five reference gene regions studied
did not contain introns: isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh),
Glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (Ga3pdh), Cytochrome
oxidase I (COI), Wingless (Wingless) and Arginine
Kinase (ArgKinase).
Primer sequences were as follows in 5â -3â direction:

Sequencing

Plasmid minipreparation from bacterial colonies grown
in 96 deep-well plates was performed using the 96 robot
plasmid isolation kit (Eppendorf) on a Tecan Evo Freedom 150 robotic platform (Tecan). Each plasmid prep
was sequenced in both directions, for a minimum of 2
reads for each clone, of which there were 6 per individual, for 40 individuals, for the two Nsp gene regions.
This required 960 sequencing reactions for the Nsp
gene and all reference genes; with the exception of ArgK
and Wingless, for which the amplicons were directly
sequenced in both directions without cloning.
Single-pass sequencing of the 5â termini of cDNA
libraries was carried out on an ABI 3730 xl automatic
DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequences
have been deposited in Genbank under the following
Accession numbers (GU215458-GU215936).
Data analysis

Vector clipping, quality trimming and sequence assembly were done using the Lasergene software package
(DNAStar Inc.). The obtained contig assemblies were
aligned using the Clustal W [22] program as implemented in the freeware BioEdit program and corrected by
eye. Standard measures of DNA polymorphism, demographic analysis and selection, as well as the G-test,
were calculated using DnaSP version 4.50.2 [23] including nucleotide diversity (Ï) [24], nonsysnonymous and
silent site substitutions ns/nn [24] within P. rapae as
well as across species (Ï) [25], number of segregating
sites (S), theta per site from S (Î¸; defined as 4NeÎ¼) [25],
Tajimaâs D [26], the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) Test
[27] as well as Fay and Wuâs H [28] and Fu and Liâs D
with and without outgroup [29]. For outgroup analysis

Page 4 of 14

Pieris brassicae sequence information was used. P-values
were determined using coalescent simulations (10,000
runs) of a standard neutral model as implemented in
DnaSP. Finally, multilocus tests of selection used the
maximum-likelihood-ratio Hudson-Kreitman-AguadÃ©
test (ML-HKA-test) [30]. Simulations found that
100,000 chains were sufficient for convergence and the
starting value of divergence time for the Markov chain
(T) was obtained using a standard HKA test for the
reference genes, implemented in DnaSP.
For the following calculations the Arlequin Software
package was used [31]. Population genetic structure in
P. rapae populations was examined using an analysis of
molecular variance (AMOVA) [32,33], with samples
classified by populations and groups (USA vs Europe)
and molecular variation was tested within populations,
among populations and between groups. Significance
was determined by 10,100 permutations. Population
pairwise Fst was estimated by the AMOVA [34]. The
significance of the estimated Fst was determined via
Markov chain analysis [35] using 10,000 permutations.
For Fst estimation, population samples were compared
in all pairwise combinations with a sequential Bonferroni adjustment applied to control for Type I errors
[36]. Migration rate (m) [37], and from m the absolute
number of migrants exchanged between two populations
(M), were computed. An exact test for population differentiation was also computed and is equivalent to the
Fisherâs exact test, which tests the null hypothesis of
identical allelic distribution across all populations. Significance was determined via Markov chain analysis
with 400,000 steps and 100,000 dememorization steps,
again applying Bonferroni adjustment when screening
for significant values.
Demographic history analysis

Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) analysis [38]
was used to infer the demographic parameters of a simple population expansion model for P. rapae as implemented in the software package ABCreg [39]. Given a
set of prior demographic parameters used in a coalescence simulation program (ms) to generate population
datasets from which summary statistics are calculated,
this method uses a linear regression to estimate the posterior distribution of these parameters based upon their
similarity to a set of summary statistics obtained from
observed data. Our model has three parameters, modern
theta (Î¸0), the time of the beginning of expansion from
refugia (tb), and growth rate of the expansion (g). We
used a two step approach, beginning with a broad range
of prior conditions, which was followed by a more
focused range of prior conditions based on the outcome
of the first analysis. For both runs, posterior parameter
determination was conditional upon Î¸, Ï, and R2 from

Heidel-Fischer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:60
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/60

our pooled reference gene dataset (IDH, Ga3pdh, Wingless), which had a minimum of 132 chromosomes
sampled. R2 is a statistic that is very sensitive to population expansion [40] and robust to recombination effects
[41]. Recombination effects are very important considerations in our dataset. For although other methods for
detecting demographic change, such as Fuâs Fs and mismatch distributions, are highly significant for our genes
and show distributions of pairwise differences consistent
with population expansions, these are highly sensitive to
recombination effects. Although recombination rates in
our reference genes are low, we cannot accurately estimate their upper limits, which then brings these latter
results into question. Thus, we have chosen the ABC
method to model our demographic changes using summary statistics robust to recombination effects as a conservative approach. ArgKinase was excluded from this
analysis as it harbors very little genetic variation and
appears to be an outlier given its significantly negative
Tajimaâs D values. Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene
population size assumptions are based on the likely
population size to persist through the Pleistocene and
an expansion size that is an order of magnitude larger
(but an order smaller, the assumed effective population
size of D. melanogaster (roughly 1 Ã 106)).
Tests for diversifying selection

A comparison between the nonsynonymous (dN) and
synonymous (dS) substitutions rates across a gene sample can be used to assess the historical action of positive
or negative selection, with dN < dS indicative of purifying selection and dN > dS suggestive of diversifying
selection. Given the recent controversy over which
methods perform better in detecting negative (purifying)
and positive (diversifying) selection at the codon level
[42-46], we implemented a counting method (singlelikelihood ancestor counting, SLAC), a random effect
likelihood (REL) method, a fixed effects likelihood (FEL)
method [47], as well as a fixed effects likelihood analysis
that only tests for selection along internal (IFEL)
branches of the sample phylogeny and is recommended
for detecting older selection events in the history of the
sample [48]. For population level samples such as the
ones we are analyzing here, recombination must be
accounted for and incorporated into analyses [49]. We
used a genetic algorithm for recombination detection
(GARD) method, which shows excellent performance
compared to other recombination detection methods
[50,51], and used the resulting inferred, non-recombinant partitions for all analyses. All 4 methods are able
to utilize these data partitions, as well as DNA substitution models calculated for a given dataset, which we
estimated using the Model selection option on the Datamonkey webserver [52]. We used this approach of

Page 5 of 14

determining optimal DNA substitution model, testing
for recombination, and using the resulting DNA substitution model and partitioned dataset (when recombination was detected) as inputs for the four codon based
tests of selection.
P. rapae vs. P. brassicae EST comparison

Random sequencing of cDNA libraries made from P.
rapae and P. brassicae gut tissue and the Pbr Nsp
sequence of P. brassicae have been described elsewhere
[18]. 2593 unique EST contigs were identified for P.
rapae from 8153 sequencing reads, while only 973 were
found among 2560 reads of P. brassicae. The reciprocal
best blast hits between each of these two cDNA libraries
to the predicted genes of Bombyx mori was used to
identify homologous genes in both Pieris EST collections. A random sample of 70 such homologous pairs
was chosen for further analysis. Identified sequences
were aligned by Clustal X [22] and each visually
inspected for regions of high quality sequence and alignment. End regions of alignments were trimmed such
that reading frame (i.e. amino acid sequence) was identical for 3 consecutive codons. Degenerate base pair calls
were included. Maximum likelihood estimates of the
number of pairwise dN and dS substitutions were performed using codeml of the PAML software package
[53], with the estimates of codon frequencies set as free
parameters (option F3 Ã 4). Statistical analyses of dS,
dN, and dN/dS (Ï) distributions were performed with
Jmp 5.0 (SAS Inc.). Non-normal distributions were -log
transformed to achieve normality for subsequent determination of significance, but all confidence intervals are
reported for the untransformed distributions to keep
values in a relevant scale for comparison.

Results
Molecular variation

We examined variation in two segments of the Pra Nsp
gene (Pra Nsp-D2 and Pra Nsp-D3), covering Nsp
domains 2 and 3, as well as the exons of five reference
genes: isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idh), glyceraldehyde
dehydrogenase (Ga3pdh), arginine kinase (ArgKinase),
Wingless and a portion of the mitochondrially-encoded
Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. All genes in all populations harbored genetic variation. Nucleotide diversity
(Ï) was roughly 2 to 3 times higher in Pra Nsp-D2 compared to the reference genes with the exception of
Wingless which showed a similar nucleotide diversity to
Pra Nsp-D2. Pra Nsp- D3 Ï was nearly double the reference genes again with the exception of Wingess which
exceeds the nucleotide diversity of Pra Nsp-D3 (Table
2). Î¸W showed similar patterns of diversity as Ï. Synonymous diversity (Ïss) is the highest in Wingless, followed
by Nsp-D2 and COX, which have about 50% higher

different haplotypes in all populations. Wingless and Arg
Kinase were sequenced directly, therefore we could not
distinguish between different haplotypes between individuals for these two loci.
The location of amino acid polymorphisms varied
across the sequenced domains of Pra Nsp. Each domain
is composed of three exons, with codon lengths of 66, 23
and 112 and 118 respectively (Fig. 1) [18]. The 10 amino
acid polymorphisms in Pra Nsp domain 2 are only found
in its terminal exon (exon five), while 11 of the 14 amino

diversity than the rest of the nuclear genes. Nonsynonymous diversity (Ïns) is highest in Pra Nsp-D2, followed
by Pra Nsp-D3, followed by the reference genes which
have much lower levels of amino acid variation
(Table 2). Pra Nsp-D2 and Pra Nsp-D3 have a Ïns/Ïss
that is over twice that of Idh and more than 20 times
that of Ga3pdh and Wingless (Table 2). In total we identified 37 different haplotypes for Pra Nsp-D2 and Pra
Nsp-D3 and 15 different haplotypes for COX and IDH
in all four populations. For Ga3pdh we could identify 16

with reference to first sequence is depicted for each unique allele, with shared alleles across populations highlighted with same color. Bars

acid polymorphism in Pra Nsp domain 3 are also found
in its terminal exon; the other three are in the first exon
of the domain 3 (exon 5; Figs. 1, 2). The distribution of
nonsynonymous polymorphisms across these domains
significantly departs from a random distribution based
on the size of the exons, with a paucity of amino acid
polymorphism observed in the first and second exons,
and an excess in the terminal exons, of both domains (G
value = 5.99, P = 0.014; Additional file 1 Figure S1). Analyses of synonymous variation does not show such an
uneven distribution (Additional file 1 Figure S1). The distribution of synonymous polymorphisms does not show
this trend (G value = 0.43, P = 0.512). There was also variation among genes in the number of time a haplotype
appeared in a population and in the distribution of haplotypes across populations (Fig. 2). Populations contained
both distinct haplotypes as well as some haplotypes that
were shared across populations (Fig. 2a, b).
Population genetic structure

We used AMOVA to partition genetic variance among
different levels of population structure for the coding

region of all seven gene fragments. Results indicated significant sources of variation within populations for both
Nsp domains as well as Idh and Ga3pdh, and among
populations within continents for the latter two genes
(Table 3). Overall, populations contained the highest
percentage of variation compared to variation within
and between continents (Table 3). Fst values show an
overall low differentiation between populations (Table
4), as most of the variation is located within them
(Table 3). After Bonferroni correction of the Fst pvalues
we detected significant differences between populations
only for comparisons of Pra Nsp-D3 between Germany
and both France and the USA and in Ga3pdh between
France and the german, italien and USA populations.
COI shows Germany and the USA to be differentiated
(Table 4). Similarly, across all genes and many population comparisons, the migration rate is high and in
many cases indicative of unrestricted gene flow.
Exact tests for population differentiation reveal
roughly the same low level population structure
observed in the Fst analysis (Table 4). First, analysis of
Nsp-D3 finds the same pairwise comparisons significant

Our investigation of the demographic history of these
samples began with determining the posterior distribution of demographic parameters for a broad set of prior
conditions. Given the Quaternary history of Europe and
the phylogeographic structure of many species [54], we
estimate the mid-Pleistocene Ne of P. rapae to be
10,000 which expanded to a modern size of 100,000. In
our first run we tested this hypothesis by drawing prior
conditions from a wide uniform distribution where the
onset of population expansion, tb, was between 0 and
100,000 years ago. Population growth rate, g, assuming
an expansion to a modern N0 of 100,000 from a size of
10,000 is 11.5. With this in mind, we drew priors from a
broad uniform distribution around this ideal, with g ranging from 0 to 20. A liberal tolerance for acceptance
(0.01 of priors) was used to screen through 1,000,000
prior simulations, with acceptance contingent upon
similarity to a set of summary statistics (Î¸, Ï, and R2)
from our reference gene dataset (Wingless, IDH,
Ga3pdh). This first run returned a mean g of 1.7 (lower
and upper values = 1.35 - 2.31) and tb of 7,881 generations before present (2,947 - 13,692). Our second run
used a more narrow acceptance criteria (0.001) and a
more focused range of prior values based upon 2 times

as in the Fst analysis. This is also observed at Ga3pdh,
although only the largest of the three significant Fst
comparisons is significant in the exact tests. Second,
breaking with this pattern is Nsp-D2, where only the
extact test finds differences between France and both
Germany and the USA. While Fst analyses use the number of genetic differences between haplotypes to assess
structure, the exact test uses the haplotype identities
themselves and is thus more sensitive to recombinant
haplotypes. Thus these observations likely derive from
differences in the distribution of recombinant haplotypes
and thus indicate population structure at a much finer

above and below the observed means from the first run
(prior ranges: g = 0 - 5.103; tb = 0 - 24,000 generations).
Second run results returned posterior estimates of mean
g being 2.85 (lower and upper values = 0.72 - 4.27) and
t b being 9,420 generations before present (3,717 18,102).
Tests for selection

We employed molecular tests of selection based on the
null hypothesis of the standard neutral model. Tajimaâs
D is not significant for any of the tested gene regions
with the exception of the German population sample of
ArgKinase (Tajimaâs D = -1.83, P < 0.05). The most
positive values of Tajimaâs D are found in Pra Nsp-D2
while all the other genes have negative values or are
close to zero (Additional file 1 Table S1). Tajimaâs D for
Nsp-D2 and -D3 combined was -0.44. Fu and Liâs D also
found no significant genes other than ArgKinase in the
German population (Fu and Liâs D = -2.23, P < 0.05),
either with or without P. brassicae as an outgroup
(Additional file 1 Table S1). Analysis of the relationship
of non-synonymous vs. synonymous polymorphism
within species to non-synonymous vs. synonymous
divergence between species used the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test with P. brassicae as an outgroup (Additional file 1 Table S2). Results for all genes are not
significant, although the number of nonsynonymous
fixed substitutions was highest in Pra Nsp (n = 48). This
is more than an order of magnitude higher than the
next highest reference gene (n = 3, Idh), while COI had
the highest number of synonymous substitutions (n =
73) followed by Nsp (n = 45; Additional file 1 Table S2).
Removing low frequency haplotypes in the Nsp datasets,
with an occurrence of two or less, also results in nonsignificant MK tests (not shown). The multilocus HKA
tests on either of the Pra Nsp regions (Pra Nsp-D2 and
Pra Nsp-D3), tested individually against the reference
genes and in combination, showed no significant divergence from the neutral expectations. Analyses conducted on pooled population samples also found no
significant departures from neutral expectations (results
not shown).
We also implemented molecular tests of selection that
were focused on detecting diversifying selection at the
codon level, in the presence of recombination, while
making no assumptions about the demographic history
of the underlying sample.
Genetic algorithm analysis detected a recombination
breakpoint (P < 0.01) at bp 264 in the Pra Nsp-D2 gene
dataset, but not in other datasets. Therefore a partitioned dataset of the Pra Nsp-D2 dataset was used in all
subsequent analyses (provided as output from the
GARD analysis and available in Additional file 1 GARD
tree file). Previous simulation study of the Type I and

Page 9 of 14

Type II error rates of the SLAC, FEL, and REL methods
recommends using a P-value cutoff of 0.25 for the first
two methods and a focus upon sites that are identified
as under selection by more than one method [47].
Focusing upon sites that have a P-value less than 0.15
and are shared by at least two of these three different
methods, we found one positively selected site in both
Nsp domain 2 and 3, as well as many negatively selected
sites in both domains (Fig. 1, Table 5). Of these three
methods (SLAC, FEL, and REL), SLAC returned the
least significant P-values while the posterior probabilities
of the REL method are usually very significant. The
IFEL method identified several sites that have changed
in selection pressures over evolutionary time, identifying
negatively selected sites in both domains (Table 5), as
well as the positively selected site in Nsp domain 2
(codon 112, P = 0.021). No similar evidence for positive
selection was found in the other genes. However, all
genes showed evidence for negatively selected sites (i.e.
sites under purifying selection), ranging from 1 in arginine kinase to 21 in cytochrome oxidase I (COI).
Interspecific divergence and dN/dS

P. rapae and its congener P. brassicae diverged approximately 11.75 Myr ago, based on temporal calibration of
sequence divergence in the EF-1a gene as previously
applied to Pieridae [4]. To compare the pattern of divergence at Nsp with a random genomic sample of genes,
70 homologous gene pairs were identified in EST collections of these two species. These ranged from a length
of 183 to 792 bp, with a mean of 520.9 bps (std. dev. =
144) and 75% of sequences being > 430 bp long. This
translates into a mean of 130 synonymous and 390 nonsynonymous sites per gene pair respectively (std. dev.
40.7 and 108 respectively). There was a range of
between 5 to 71 bp differences between sequence pairs,
with a mean of 27.2 bp (std. dev. = 13.2 bp).
Maximum-likelihood analysis of dS and dN divergence
between these Pieris species across these 70 genes finds
substantial divergence, with the average dS = 0.189 (std.
dev. = 0.073) and dN = 0.018 (std. dev. 0.018). However,
these genes are, as expected, experiencing a fair amount
of purifying selection with a mean dN/dS (Ï) = 0.097
(std. dev. = 0.091), with a range from 0 to 0.38.
The divergence and Ï values at Nsp between these
species are significantly greater than the 95% confidence interval of the observed genomic mean estimate
from the 70 randomly chosen genes. The mean dS and
dN across Nsp domains 2 & 3 is dS = 0.269 (std. dev.
= 0.010) and dN = 0.071 (std. dev. = 0.002). Their
range (dS: 0.26 - 0.31; dN: 0.07 - 0.8) is greater than
the 95% confidence intervals for the dS and dN values
of the random genes (dS: 0.176 - 0.213; dN: 0.016 0.025). The combined Nsp domains 2 & 3 have a mean

Discussion
Our interest in the Nsp gene originates from its central
role in hostplant detoxification and the macroevolutionary consequences of this function [3,4]. Like many evolutionary ecology studies that have identified a candidate
gene with ecologically relevant function, we wish to
know more about the microevolutionary dynamics of its
genetic variation. By focusing at the population level
within one species, we have conducted a battery of

analyses to help discriminate among alternative adaptive
hypotheses and uncover the segregating genetic variation upon which future ecological studies should focus
(Table 1).
Four alternative hypotheses were developed to assess
the microevolutionary dynamics at Pra Nsp in the
sampled P. rapae populations (Table 1). Two of these
can be soundly rejected based on our results. First, H1
posits that local adaptation causes a greater level of
genetic diversity among than within populations. This
hypothesis is rejected by the high diversity of Pra Nsp
amino acid alleles in all populations and with many
alleles shared among populations (Fig. 2). Formally, the
Pra Nsp loci have low Fst values and high migration rates

Figure 3 Frequency distribution of dN/dS ratios (x-axis) from
interspecific comparisons among 70 random genes between
Pieris rapae and P. brassicae. The number of genes in each bin of
a given ratio range are shown on the y-axis. The range of dN/dS
across all pairwise comparisons of Pra Nsp domain 2 & 3 combined
with Pbr Nsp domain 2 & 3 sequence is shown right of the
histogram as a grey box. Analyses of domains 2 & 3 separately
showed little difference from the combined analysis, and thus the
latter was presented for greater figure clarity.

(Table 4), non-significant Tajimaâs D and related tests
(Additional file 1 Table S1), and AMOVA results that
indicated greater variation within than among populations (Table 3). While the exact tests of population differentiation in both Pra Nsp-D2 and D3 do give some hint
at population structure (Table 4), this test is sensitive to
the unique recombinant haplotypes found in populations
that are at low frequency (e.g. Fig. 2). Thus, H1-local
adaptation is rejected. Second, H3 posited directional
selection or strong purifying selection upon an optimal
genotype, both of which would result in little variation
within and among populations. The high levels of within
population amino acid polymorphism at Pra Nsp (Fig. 2),
as well as the non-significant MK tests (Additional file 1
Table S2), argue conclusively against H3.
The results for the two remaining hypotheses, H0demography and H2-diversifying/balancing selection, are
more complicated. Much of the last decade has been
focused upon developing methods to tease apart the
effects of selection from demography on the patterns of
DNA within populations (the site frequency spectrum).
While in some cases this is possible in model genomic
species, for non-model species with limited genomic
insight, teasing these relative effects apart is very difficult. This is especially true for the case of potential
diversifying/balancing selection where molecular tests of
selection have very low power [55,56]. While the
AMOVA results are consistent with H2-diversifying
selection, where Pra Nsp diversity is expected to be
higher within than among populations (Table 3), these

Page 11 of 14

patterns are also seen at two of our reference genes (Idh
and Ga3pdh), the latter of which also shows significant
exact test and Fst results in pairwise population comparisons. This suggests that much if not all of our genetic
variation is influenced by the recent demographic history of P. rapae.
Our null hypothesis, H0-demography, expected
genetic variation within and among samples at the reference genes to solely reflect demographic history. Young
P. rapae females are known to migrate long distances
before egg laying [19] and this natural dispersal ability is
likely augmented and scrambled due to the long-distance transport of crop plants bearing eggs and larvae
[57]. In accordance with the high dispersal of P. rapae
we find a general pattern of greater genetic diversity
within vs. among populations in all genes (Table 3). In
addition, the North American sample shows no clear
distinction from the European populations, which may
be indicative of recent and ongoing movement of
P. rapae into the Americas instead of one historical
introduction. Modeling of the demographic history
based solely upon our reference genes indicates a population expansion 9,420 generations before present. The
mean to lower range of our estimates (3,717 - 18,102)
are consistent with the demographic history of most
species in Europe [54] and the known expansion of this
species [20,21]. Thus, the patterns of molecular variation
at Pra Nsp suggest that H0-demography cannot be
rejected; Nsp genetic variation is strongly influenced by
recent population expansion.
One means of circumventing the confounding effects
of demography and selection on the site frequency spectrum is to use analyses that are robust to demographic
history. We implemented two such tests. First, we used
the MK test and found no significant results (Additional
file 1 Table S2). This is entirely consistent with the
absence of directional selection within our populations
(i.e. a rejection of H3). In the context of H2- diversifying/balancing selection, the MK test is not an appropriate test. Hughes [58] has argued that tests of neutrality,
and the MK test in particular, only provide an appropriate test for very specific types of selection. Stated
another way, no single test is a general test for all types
of selection. Thus, what the MK test results tell us is
that there does not appear to be an excess of repeated
selective sweeps at different codons in any of our genes,
since P. rapae diverged from their common ancestor
with P. brassicae (i.e. rejection of H3).
Our second test was a codon based test of selection
that looked for both positive (diversifying) and negative
(purifying) selection while making no assumptions
regarding demographic history and incorporating
recombination effects [47]. Such tests have recently
been the focus of a vigorous debate in the literature

Heidel-Fischer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:60
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/60

regarding their assumptions and relative performance
[42-47], and whether such methods are fundamentally
flawed [59]. Thus, rather than picking among these
methods we cautiously employed several codon based
tests of selection which covered the range of fundamental methodological assumptions, presented a full disclosure of their findings, and identified only codons which
found some support across these methods (Table 5).
This approach avoids the possible false positives inherent in any one method, but does not get around the
multiple testing issues and other problems inherent to
these methods [59].
This approach does find evidence in the Pr Nsp
domains for both negative (purifying) selection and positive (diversifying) selection (Fig. 1, Table 5). While a discussion of the fundamentally different assumptions
employed by these methods is beyond the scope of this
paper, they are known to differ in their sensitivity and
false positive rate [47]. While there is certainly purifying
selection acting on certain regions of the Nsp gene, the
findings of positive selection should be viewed with caution and are not conclusive enough to warrant rejection
of H0-demography in favor of H2-diversifying/balancing
selection. Ultimately, determination of the evolutionary
consequence of any of the observed amino acid variation
necessitates functional assessment.
Our final consideration focuses upon the amount and
distribution of amino acid diversity within Pra Nsp,
which cannot solely be accounted for by demographic
effects alone. The observed number of amino acid polymorphisms in Prap Nsp are greater than the well studied Pgi gene in Colias butterflies, which may be the
most diverse gene known from Insecta in having 15 segregating amino acid sites spread across 556 codons [60].
Combining the information we have for Pra Nsp
domains 2 and 3, we have identified 24 segregating
amino acid polymorphisms across 346 codons (Fig. 1).
Considering that we have not even surveyed the first
domain of Pra Nsp, it is very likely that the Pra Nsp
gene could harbor over 30 amino acid polymorphisms
within populations across its 618 codons (a level that is
twice that seen at Pgi in Colias). In sum, Nsp appears to
be one of the most polymorphic coding genes known in
Insecta. Higher polymorphic levels can be found in the
sex-determination gene, complementary sex determination, of honey bees that exhibits trans specific balancing
selection [61].
Some of the increased amino acid diversity is certainly
due to relaxation of purifying selection at specific
regions of the enzyme. There is a well documented gradient of increasing amino acid diversity and divergence
with greater solvent exposure of codons in enzyme
structures (e.g. [62,63]). This arises due to strong functional constraints on the folding of the enzyme, which is

Page 12 of 14

relaxed in enzyme surface regions. Comparing the dN/
dS value of P. rapae Nsp vs P. brassicae Nsp with an
average of 70 randomly chosen genes between those
two species shows that Nsp has a significantly higher
dN/dS ratio and more divergence. Given that we were
only using a consensus sequence derived from a small
number of individuals, we have likely inflated our estimations of divergence with polymorphic differences.
Such inflation makes our comparison with Nsp divergence more conservative. However, this set of 70 genes,
given their shared identification from separate EST
libraries, is likely to be enriched for genes having a
moderate to high level of expression even though the
libraries were normalized. As such, this set of genes
likely represents a biased set of genes having housekeeping functions and experiencing moderate to strong purifying selection. Thus, the observation of Nsp having a
higher dN/dS ratio than these genes only tells us that
Nsp is under less constraint compared to 70 random
housekeeping genes. Importantly, this reduced constraint is not large as NSP only shows a 0.2 higher dN/
dS ratio than the gene average, indicating ongoing purifying selection for the gene function. However these
values are gene averages, therefore a more detailed
assessment is needed.
Detailed examination of the distribution of amino acid
variation across the sequenced domain regions shows
functional constraint acting on specific regions of the
enzyme coupled with an unexpectedly high amount of
amino acid polymorphism concentrated in specific
domain regions (Fig. 1, Table 5, Additional file 1 Figure
S1). Although further study is necessary to fully document this observation, as data from the first domain and
all of the second domain are needed; such patterns indicate substantial variation in functional constraint across
the gene. These results suggest that greater knowledge
of the structure-function relationships of the Nsp protein will be necessary in order to understand the
observed excess amino acid variation. In sum, while
regions of relaxed constraint certainly harbor more variation, this does not mean such variation is neutral.
Indeed, much of the known amino acid variation affecting the kinetics of metabolic enzymes is located upon
the surface of enzymes (e.g. [60,62-64]).

Conclusion
The microevolutionary dynamics at the Nsp gene appear
to be a mixture of demographic effects (population
expansion and high migration) coupled with variation in
functional constraint across the gene. Patterns of
nucleotide diversity and indirect molecular tests for historical selection reject strong local adaptation, as well as
directional and strong purifying selection. Rather than
taking the absence of clear signatures of historical

Heidel-Fischer et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:60
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/60

selection upon the Nsp gene as conclusive evidence for
no fitness variation among alleles, we recognize the limitation of such indirect approaches and remain curious
as to the functional effects of the extremely high
amount of amino acid diversity. Thus, this study provides a foundation for the design and insightful use of
molecular markers for genetic variants whose ecological
performance and fitness can be characterized in the
field (e.g. [65]).
We now know that there is an exceptional amount of
amino acid variation within nearly every population of
P. rapae. If this allelic variation has functional consequences, the effects are likely to be environmentally
dependent and potentially small. As such, future studies
will need very large sample sizes for many families
across a range of potentially relevant conditions.
Families can be sampled from the field as ovipositing
females and will contain sufficient diversity for study. In
addition, individuals will need to be sampled during larval stages in order to provide access to the cDNA of the
Nsp gene, as the entire coding sequence must be
sequenced for no single polymorphic site will suffice to
characterize Nsp allelic variation. Only with functional
study of the identified genetic variation can we begin to
conclusively assess the extent to which the observed variation at Nsp plays an ongoing role in the microevolutionary dynamics of P. rapae and its interaction with the
highly variable chemical defense system of their Brassicales hostplants.
