Abstract
HIV-1 Rev protein regulates the expression of HIV-1 transcripts by binding to a highly structured stem loop
structure called the Rev Responsive Element (RRE) present in the genomic and partially spliced RNAs. Genetic
variation in this structure is likely to affect binding of Rev protein and ultimately overall gene expression and
replication. We characterized RRE sequences from 13 HIV-1 infected individuals from North India which also
included two mother-child pairs following vertical transmission. We observed high degree of conservation of
sequences, including the 9-nt (CACUAUGGG) long sequence in stem-loop B, required for efficient binding of Rev
protein. All of our 13 RRE sequences possessed G to A (position 66) mutation located in the critical branchedstem-loop B which is not present in consensus C or B sequence. We derived a consensus RRE structure which
showed interesting changes in the stem-loop structures including the stem-loop B. Mother-Child RRE sequences
showed conservation of unique polymorphisms as well as some new mutations in child RRE sequences. Despite
these changes, the ability to form multiple essential stem-loop structures required for Rev binding was conserved. RRE RNA derived from one of the samples, VT5, retained the ability to bind Rev protein under in vitro
conditions although it showed alternate secondary structure. This is the first study from India describing the
structural and possible functional implications due to very unique RRE sequence heterogeneity and its possible
role in vertical transmission and gene expression.
Introduction
HIV-1 displays very high genetic diversity and has been
classified into various subtypes and recombinant forms.
While subtype B predominates in US and UK, it is subtype C that is predominant in India, China and South
Africa. Most of the changes are observed in the Envelope region but other region like p24-Gag is relatively
conserved among subtypes and has been exploited to
develop ELISA for diagnostic purposes. HIV-1 exploits
the splicing machinery very efficiently by using the Rev
protein which binds with high affinity and specificity to
highly structured cis-acting RNA element present within
the coding region of HIV-1 Envelope gene [1] called
Rev Responsive Element (RRE). This RRE element folds
into 4 well defined stem-loop structures (A to D) and

stem-loop B (stem-bulge-stem structure) is critically
important for efficient binding with Rev Protein [2].
Natural variations in the RRE sequences can potentially
impact on the secondary structure which might modulate the efficiency of Rev binding. Several studies have
earlier suggested that the major Rev protein binding site
resides in the predicted second branched stem-loop
region [1,3] and other regions of the full-length RRE
may influence the binding of Rev protein [4]. Rev - RRE
interaction is crucial for efficient late gene expression
and replication and efforts are being made to develop
novel antiviral approaches that interfere with this interaction. RevM10, a transdominant negative Rev protein,
was earlier shown to interfere with HIV-1 replication in
T-cell lines and also in primary T-cells [5]. RRE element
has been exploited as decoy for specific targeting of
HIV-1 gene expression and replication [6].

RRE variants are produced when cells are treated with
this protein [7]. Very recently resistant mutants were
identified due to altered RRE structures in presence of
RevM10 protein [8]. These two studies strongly suggest
that sequences in RRE can change under pressure that
can have great functional implications. Earlier, Ramakrishnan & Ahmad, 2007 [9] carried out genetic and
structural studies of the RRE sequences among motherchild pairs from USA where subtype-B is predominant.
The extent and nature of genetic variation and its implication on the secondary structures on its known functions in India is lacking where the epidemic is largely
driven by subtype C. Studying sequence variation in the
mother-infant pairs will provide insights into the evolution and selection pressures exerted.
The interaction of HIV-1 Rev with RRE is critical for
viral gene expression and replication of the virus. Data
from various geographic location and subtypes would
help us to develop strategies in combating HIV infection. As per our knowledge there is no data available on
HIV-1 subtype C RRE genetic and functional characteristics. In the present study, we present in-depth genetic
and functional analysis of RRE sequences from a cohort
of 13 HIV-1 infected individuals from North-India. The
sequences were compared with the Indian consensus C
and consensus B along with earlier published subtype C
RRE sequences from India. A unique region specific
conservation along with Subtype C and B specific mutations were observed in all of the stem-loop structures.
We further show that RRE sequences derived from one
of the samples (VT5) retained the ability to bind to Rev
protein under in vitro conditions, though the in silico
analysis detects an alternate secondary structure. This

study is first of its kind to characterize HIV-1 subtype C
RRE sequences both genetically and functionally.

Methods
Patient description

Detailed sequence analysis was carried out from HIV-1
infected individuals from Chandigarh-Punjab region as
described in our recent HIV-1 LTR related paper [10].
They were monitored at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh by Dr
A Wanchu (Clinician and one of the authors) after obtaining all requisite ethical clearances. The clinical features of
all the 13 HIV-1 infected individuals are shown in table 1.
Genomic DNA isolation and analysis of RRE secondary
structures

The genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood
lymphocytes as described by us earlier [11] and subjected to polymerase chain reaction with RRE specific
primers. 247 nt long RRE genes were amplified using
specific primers common for both subtypes B and C
and placed them under CMV/T7 promoter of the
expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Promega Biotech.) that
was digested with Hind III and Bam H1. Following primers were used:
1. Forward: 5′- GGC aagctt GAGCAGTGGGAATA
GGAGCTTTG
2. Reverse: 5′- GGC ggatcc AGGAGCTGTTGATC
CTTTAGGTATCT
The sequence information was generated using T7specific primers. Indian specific Consensus C sequences

were created as describes previously [12]. Sequences
were compared with Indian Consensus C and consensus
B and Indian RRE subtype C sequences downloaded
from Los Alamos Database http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/.
The secondary structures were obtained using RNAalifold program of Vienna RNA package that uses the
Zuker algorithm as recently reported [13]. At least 4
independent clones were analyzed for each sample to
rule out Taq polymerase mediated mis-incorporation of
nucleotides. A consensus RRE secondary structure was
created by using the program described by Gruber
et. al., 2008 (website http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at) [13]. All
the 4 clones derived from a single individual showed
complete similarity among them. Mother-child samples
were processed separately to avoid potential cross
contamination.
Rev cloning, purification, in vitro synthesis of RRE RNA
and EMSA

Towards this end, we amplified Rev B using pNL4-3
[14] and Rev C using 93IN905 [15] genetic clones, as
described above and purified it to homogeneity as
GST-fusion proteins after placing them in bacterial
expression vector (pGEX4T-2, Amersham Bioscience)
following the earlier described protocol [16]. Prior to
cloning in the bacterial expression vector, both the
exons of the Rev genes were precisely fused using the
fusion technology described by us recently [17]. We also
amplified 247 nt long RRE fragment using specific primers and placed it under CMV/T7 promoter of the
expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Promega Biotech.) that
was digested with Hind III and Bam H1. Hind III and
Bam H1 restriction sites were engineered at the beginning of forward and reverse primers respectively (small
case) to facilitate cloning in the expression vector as
described above. 32P labeled RRE RNA was generated
using T7 RNA polymerase and fixed amounts of it was
incubated with varying amounts of Rev protein and subjected to EMSA as described earlier [18].

Results and discussion
Analysis of RRE nucleotide sequences

83 sequences of subtype B (from USA, Japan, Mayanmar, France and Brazil) and 83 sequences of Indian subtype C, were downloaded from Los Almos data base
(Accessed on 13th May 2010). The mean intra-species
identity of Subtype B RRE sequences was 95.3% (range
90 -100) and Indian subtype C strains was 95.03%
(Range 89-100). The identity between consensus B and
C (downloaded from Los Alamos Database) was 94%.
Thus RRE region is one of the most conserved regions
in the genomic RNA between HIV-1 subtypes B and C
and with probably other subtypes as well. The analysis
of intra-subtype divergence (genetic distance from

Page 3 of 8

Indian consensus sequence) and diversity (intra-subtype
genetic variability of North Indian isolates) of these
strains showed significant difference (0.105 vs. 0.011,
p < 0.00011), thus it is tempting to speculate that North
Indian HIV-1 subtype C RRE sequences are highly conserved and the phylogenetic analysis showed a monophyletic clade indicating epidemiological linkage of these
samples (data not shown).
When the sequences were compared with the consensus Indian subtype C and consensus B RRE sequences,
all the four stem loops (C, D, E and A) showed nucleotide changes that were common with the latter with
some unique region specific mutations. In stem loop A,
G21A. A208G unique mutation observed in our cohort
sequences. It is noteworthy that all of our 13 RRE
sequences possessed G66A substitution located in the
critical branched-stem-loop B which is neither present
in the consensus C nor in Consensus B (Figure 1). In
the same region, a unique G110A mutation was
observed in North Indian strains. This region is critically
involved with the binding of Rev protein. A120G mutation was observed in stem loop C and G192A substitution was in stem loop E.
Mother- Child transmission of RRE sequences

Two mother child pair samples namely, VT1 (mother)
and VT2 (child) and VT5 (mother) and VT6 (child)
were analyzed for the evolution or conservation of
sequences. All of the stem-loop structures were retained
with minor genetic changes that were different in the
pair. For example, G123C mutation was observed only
in stem-loop C of the mother. On the other hand,
G94A unique mutation in stem-loop B was conserved
both in mother and child (VT5 & VT6). The critically
important 9 nt sequence involved in high affinity binding with Rev protein, was however, completely conserved (figure 1).
Secondary structure prediction of RRE sequences

A consensus RRE structure was generated using previously published subtype C (figure 2 panel A), subtype
B (figure 2 panel B) and all of our 13 RRE sequences
(consensus NII-PGI) (figure 2 panel C) and subjected
them to multiple sequence alignment program (Vienna
RNA conservation coloring). RRE sequence consisted of
four stem-loop structures. When the individual RRE
sequences were subjected to the RNA folding program,
minor variations (in the length or in the size of the
minor stem-loops) in the vicinity of well-defined stemloop structures were observed (figure 3). This secondary
structure exhibited an additional stem-loop (as in the
case of stem-loop C with E3, a common short stemloop between stem-loop C and D as in the case of S1
and VT1. Remarkably, gross changes (particularly D and

and subtype B (pNL4-3) [14]. Five stem loop regions are shown at the top of the sequence. Samples (S1 to E3) were analyzed in this study and
compared with other known RRE sequences (with their accession numbers) from India published earlier. Periods indicate similarity and - indicate
a deletion. VT1/VT2 and VT5 and VT6 form mother child pairs. Accession numbers FJ649319 to FJ649331 were obtained for all our 13 samples
(S1 to E3- sequentially).

Figure 2 Predicted consensus secondary RRE structure: A consensus secondary structure of our RRE sequences were generated from, 20
subtype C (panel A) and B (panel B) and 13 RRE sequences from this study (panel C) which uses multiple sequence alignment program using
RNA fold program in the Vienna RNA package (Zuker algorithm) as described in the text. Five (A to E) well defined stem-loop structures
including the branched stem-lop B critical for binding Rev protein were identified. In this program the pale colors indicate that a base-pair
cannot be formed in some sequences of the alignment.

E stem loop structures) in the secondary structures were
observed between VT5 (mother) and child VT6 (child)
(figure 3).
Our RRE sequence analysis of HIV-1 infected individuals (including mother -child pair samples) suggest that
despite heterogeneity, four major stem-loop structures
were conserved. This is important for Rev-RRE interaction which governs HIV-1 splicing and replication. Nine
nucleotide long sequence (CACUAUGGG) present in
stem-loop B was totally conserved in all our 12 samples
and also among the early isolates from India (Data not
shown). The most important observation was the presence of G to A (66th position) mutation present in the
2nd stem-loop region which was unique to our samples
(not observed in Consensus B or C sequences) and
argues strongly in favor of selective forces responsible for
selection of this mutation. Mutations were observed in
other stem-loop regions (A, C, D & E) also. Most of these
nucleotide changes are also observed in consensus subtype B RRE sequence. Thus, most of our RRE sequences
show similarity with either consensus B or C but the
polymorphisms observed show similarity with consensus
RRE B sequences. It is tempting to speculate that structural constraints may allow the generation of RRE
sequences that are either subtype B or C-specific in this

region. It must be pointed out that consensus RRE B and
C sequences used here for comparison showed about
94% similarity between each other. Although we have
carried out sequence analysis from 4 independent clones,
it may still be argued that these mutations are due to
mis-incorporation of nucleotides by the Taq polymerase.
It is noteworthy that we used high fidelity Taq polymerase (Platinum Taq, Invitrogen). To further rule out this
possibility, we isolated HIV-1 genomic RNA from the
plasma of HIV-1 infected individuals from two samples
(VT5 & VT6) and sequence information generated after
PCR matched perfectly with the sequence generated
from the DNA clones.
VT5 RRE binds to Rev B protein efficiently

RRE - B was derived from pNL4-3 [11] and cloned
under T7 promoter in pCDNA3.1 (Promega) to generate
RRE B RNA. RNA (fixed amounts) and Rev protein
(varying amounts) interaction was monitored by EMSA
as described earlier [18] and briefly described in the
legend to figure # 4. As evident from figure 4, VT5 32P
labeled RRE RNA was just as efficient in its ability to
interact with Rev protein as RRE- B RNA with Rev protein. We conclude that VT5 derived RRE sequence is
functionally relevant and competent though it shows

these structures display five well defined stem-loop structures (A to E) but show unique changes (described in the text).

alternate secondary structure. This also suggests that G
to A transition (position 66) observed in VT5 RNA did
not affect its binding ability to Rev protein. When RRE
from VT5 was incubated with Rev C protein (derived
from 93IN905), similar observation was made (data not
shown).
Majority of HIV-1 infections among infants is due to
vertical transmission from mother. It is, therefore,
important to characterize various HIV-1 genes with
respect to sequence variation or conservation. Our
sequence & predicted structural analysis of mother
(VT5) and child (VT6) pair indicate that stem-loop D
and E have undergone some changes. These kinds of
changes in the total number or the length of stem-loop
structures in the RRE were reported earlier also [9], in a
vertical transmission study carried out between mother
and infant pairs. It must be pointed out that the nature

of polymorphisms observed in our studies is significantly
different than what was observed by Ramakrishnan and
Ahmad [9] for subtype-B-specific genes. Despite this
kind of heterogeneity, the domains required for Rev protein binding or host protein interaction with RRE was
conserved which is crucially important for viral gene
expression and replication.
Another remarkable common feature of this study and
studies carried out about 9 to 10 years ago [14] was the
conserved C to T in stem-loop B, A to G and G to A in
stem-loop D and some partially conserved nucleotide
changes (G to A) in stem-loop E. Although precise
mechanism for this conservation is not known, it is
tempting to speculate that certain mutations are
uniquely selected in our region. Host factors, besides
other factors may potentially influence these changes.
This is not surprising because several host factors are

Figure 4 32 P labeled RNA was made using T7 RNA polymerase after linearizing the vector as described by the manufacturer
(Promega) and as described earlier [19]. Increasing amounts of purified GST-Rev B or C (0.1 to 0.7 μM) was mixed with fixed amounts of
labeled RRE in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.6, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 20% (V/V) glycerol, 3.2
μg E. coli t-RNA) and subjected to EMSA under exactly identical conditions as described before [18].

known to interact with RRE structures and modulate the
splicing ability of Rev protein.
In summary, we genetically characterized the nature of
heterogeneity in the RRE sequences from HIV-1
infected individuals from North India along with its
impact on the formation of multiple stem-loop structures. These structures show significant differences with
respect to either the length or number of stem-loop
structures when compared with prototype B and C RRE
sequences. Transmission studies with mother-child pair
revealed some conserved and new mutations but the
ability to form stem-loop structures was retained. RRE
derived from one of our samples (VT5) was fully capable of binding the Rev protein with equal efficiency as
that of RRE B derived from subtype B (pNL4-3).
How these changes in the secondary structures of RRE
RNA affect Rev protein binding in mammalian cells (or
host factors), splicing and virus replication may be
important for the virus replication.
