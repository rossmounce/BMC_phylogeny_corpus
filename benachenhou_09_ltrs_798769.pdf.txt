Retroviral LTRs, paired or single, are plastic structures
which contribute profoundly to genomic and transcriptional diversity. Some genomes are studded with LTRs.
However, detection and alignment of single LTRs is a bioinformatic challenge.

single LTRs, with 10-90% sensitivity, in human, fungal
and insect genomes. The specificity ranged from 30 to
90%, depending on how a ''true'' positive was defined. It
is likely that a substantial part of host genomes consists of
remnants of LTR retrotransposons which are hard to
detect, but which are partially recognized by the HMMs.

Materials and methods

Conclusion

LTRs found by RetroTector [1,2], and from RepBase, from
vertebrate, insect and plant genomes. Profile Hidden
Markov models (HMMs) [3].

Besides providing a better understanding of LTR retrotransposons and their phylogeny, the more precise knowledge of LTR structure now at hand should be useful for
optimization of gene therapeutic vectors, and for design
of LTR-targeted drugs.

Background

Results
Representatives of all known LTR containing genetic elements and viruses were analyzed using HMMs. Nine more
or less specialized HMMs (Vertebrate, Human MMTVlike, Gamma-retroviruslike, Betaretroviruslike, Lentivirus,
Spumaretroviruslike, gypsy, copia and BEL) yielded Viterbi
alignments, allowing detection of common consensus
structures (match states). The match states of the nine
HMMs could be arranged into modules with small internal and longer intermodule insert states stretches, revealing a common conserved LTR structure. An LTR-based
phylogenetic tree covering all known LTR retrotransposons came out with a similar branch pattern as a reverse
transcriptase-based tree. All LTRs started with TG and
ended with CA. R-U5 was most conserved, AATAAA being
the most conserved motif. The high degree of LTR structural conservation in LTR retrotransposons indicates that
they all have a common origin, and a common mode of
function, which thus should have originated billions of
years ago. The HMMs could also be used for detection of
