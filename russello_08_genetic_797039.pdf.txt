Abstract
Background: Severe ecological and economic impacts caused by some invasive species make it
imperative to understand the attributes that permit them to spread. A notorious crop pest across
its native range in South America, the monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) has become established
on four other continents, including growing populations in the United States. As a critical first step
to studying mechanisms of invasion success in this species, here we elucidated the geographical and
taxonomic history of the North American invasions of the monk parakeet. Specifically, we
conducted a genetic assessment of current monk parakeet taxonomy based on mitochondrial DNA
control region sequences from 73 museum specimens. These data supported comparative analyses
of mtDNA lineage diversity in the native and naturalized ranges of the monk parakeet and allowed
for identification of putative source populations.
Results: There was no molecular character support for the M. m. calita, M. m. cotorra, and M. m.
monachus subspecies, while the Bolivian M. m. luchsi was monophyletic and diagnosably distinct.
Three haplotypes sampled in the native range were detected within invasive populations in Florida,
Connecticut, New Jersey and Rhode Island, the two most common of which were unique to M. m.
monachus samples from eastern Argentina and bordering areas in Brazil and Uruguay.
Conclusion: The lack of discrete morphological character differences in tandem with the results
presented here suggest that M. m. calita, M. m. cotorra and M. m. monachus are in need of formal
taxonomic revision. The genetic distinctiveness of M. m. luchsi is consistent with previous
recommendations of allospecies status for this taxon. The geographic origins of haplotypes sampled
in the four U.S. populations are concordant with trapping records from the mid-20th century and
suggest that propagule pressure exerted by the international pet bird trade contributed to the
establishment of invasive populations in the United States.

Background
The introduction of exotic species into native ecosystems
has modified habitats, reduced species diversity and
adversely altered ecosystem functioning across the globe
[1]. In the United States only habitat degradation poses a
higher threat to endangered taxa [2]. In other regions
around the world, however, as many as 80% of endangered species are threatened due to pressures from nonnative species [3]. From an economic perspective, the
environmental damage caused by the approximately
50,000 alien-invasive species in the United States, coupled with the costs of controlling these species, exceeds
$120 billion per year [1]. The severe ecological and economic impacts of invasive species render it imperative to
understand the attributes that permit them to establish
and spread within their expanded ranges.
The monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus) is one of the
most successful parrot invaders [4]. It has been historically regarded as an agricultural pest in its native range in
South America, as noted by Charles Darwin during his
voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle:
"A small green parrot (Conurus murinus; early synonym of M. monachus), with a grey breast, appears to
prefer the tall trees on the islands to any other situation for its building-place. A number of nests are
placed so close together as to form one great mass of
sticks. These parrots always live in flocks, and commit
great ravages on the corn-fields. I was told that near
Colonia 2500 were killed in the course of one year."
[[5], Chapter VII, p. 101]
Over the past century, the widespread introduction of
Eucalyptus has facilitated the expansion of M. monachus
populations in its native range [6-8]. In Argentina, this
rapid increase in native population sizes has been implicated in the loss of 2–15% of sunflower and corn yields,
crop damages estimated by some sources to be as high as
US$1 billion per year [9,10]. In addition to rapid population growth within their endemic range, monk parakeets
have become broadly established on four other continents, presumably due to their widespread presence in the
international pet bird trade. Despite the rapid spread of
monk parakeets around the globe and their potential as
an agricultural pest, little is known about the geographical
history of the invasions. Such information may provide
important insights into the mechanisms of invasion success and potential for future range expansions.
The monk parakeet is distributed in its native range across
the lowlands of South America, east of the Andes from
Bolivia to Patagonia [[11], Figure 1]. Four subspecies are
currently recognized based on geographical variation in
wing length, bill size, body mass and plumage coloration

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/217

[12]. The nominate, M. m. monachus, is the largest of the
four subspecies and is found in extreme southeast Brazil
(Rio Grande do Sul), Uruguay and northeastern Argentina
(provinces of Entre Rios, Santa Fe, Córdoba, south to
northern Rio Negro). M. m. calita is distributed in western
Argentina from Salta province south to Rio Negro and
described as having bluer wings and a darker gray head.
M. m. cotorra is distributed in southeast Bolivia (department of Tarija), Paraguay, southern Brazil (Mato Grosso
do Sul), south to northern Argentina (provinces of Formosa and Chaco). M. m. cotorra has been reported as
brighter green on the upper parts and less yellowish on
the abdomen than M. m. calita [13], yet their general lack
of distinctiveness in these characters and their similarity
in size has brought their status as separate taxonomic entities into question [13]. Lastly, M. m. luchsi is geographically and altitudinally isolated from the other subspecies,
restricted to the arid, intermontane valleys of the east
Andes in Bolivia, from southern Cochabamba to northern
Chuquisaca [11]. In addition, M. m. luchsi exhibits distinctive plumage coloration, reported as generally brighter
than the other subspecies, with a bright yellow lower
breast, paler underwings, a dark area at the base of the
upper mandible, and a breast entirely pale grey without
the barred effect observed in the other three subspecies
[11]. In contrast to the colonial, tree-nesting behavior of
all other monk parakeets, M. m. luchsi build single-chambered nests on cliffs. These behavioral and morphological
differences led del Hoyo [14] to elevate this group to
allospecies status (Myiopsitta luchsi), a designation that is
not widely recognized.
In addition to the South American populations, naturalized breeding populations of M. monachus have been
established in such disparate regions as the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico, Kenya, Japan, Spain, Italy, Belgium,
Czech Republic, and throughout the United States including growing populations in Florida, Texas and Connecticut [4,15-18]. The origin of initial invaders in the U.S. has
been traced back to purposeful and accidental releases of
individuals from the pet trade for which approximately
64,225 monk parakeets were imported between
1968–1972 alone [4]. In general, U.S. naturalized populations are a collection of disjunct colonies, most common
in southern and coastal regions, with an estimated 6,000
to 200,000 individuals in residence nationally [19]. Once
feared as a potentially devastating crop pest, M. monachus
is still generally considered a moderate threat as populations continue to grow exponentially [15,19]. A less publicized impact of the monk parakeet invasion has been
their preference for power structures as nesting substrates.
In 2001, an estimated 1,027 power outages in south Florida were attributed to monk parakeet activities at an
approximate cost of $585,000 [20]. Moreover, the cost of
nest removal alone in south Florida was estimated at $1.3

mtDNA haplotype diversity in invasive populations in
Florida, Connecticut, New Jersey and Rhode Island. Our
results suggest that these invasive populations are derived
from a localized area in eastern Argentina and bordering
areas in Brazil and Uruguay within the described range of
M. m. monachus, the most commonly exported subspecies
for the international pet trade.

The objectives of this study were to identify the taxonomic
and geographic source(s) of the invasive populations
along the eastern seaboard of the United States. As the
accuracy of monk parakeet taxonomy has been questioned, we initially conducted a genetic assessment of the
biological validity of the four currently recognized subspecies of M. monachus by way of historical DNA analysis
from museum specimens collected throughout the native
range. This broad sampling of mitochondrial DNA lineage diversity in the endemic range provides a reference
database by which to infer the origin and extent of

Methods
Sampling
Toepad tissue was obtained from 73 museum specimens
of Myiopsitta monachus representing all four subspecies
(M. m. calita, n = 9; M. m. cotorra, n = 16; M. m. luchsi, n =
14; M. m. monachus, n = 38) courtesy of the American
Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Blood samples
from four individuals of M. m. monachus collected in Entre
Rios, Argentina were also included in the sampling. In
addition, feather or tissue samples were obtained from 64
individuals from four localities across the naturalized

range of M. monachus in the eastern United States. Specifically, muscle tissue was obtained from individuals culled
in Miami, Florida (n = 43) as part of a management program by the local electric utility company. Feathers were
obtained from colonies sampled from different trees and
areas in Bridgeport, Connecticut (n = 9) and Edgewater,
New Jersey (n = 11). In addition, we sampled a single
museum specimen collected in Kent County, Rhode
Island (AMNH832643). Table 1 includes detailed collection information for all samples while Figure 1 plots the
individual sampling localities within the native range of
M. monachus.
Data collection
DNA was extracted from blood, tissue, and feather samples using the DNeasy Tissue kit and manufacturer protocols (Qiagen, Inc.). Museum specimens were handled in a
dedicated ancient DNA facility using a modified Qiagen
DNeasy Tissue kit protocol [23]. Other necessary precautions were taken to prevent and detect contamination by
contemporary specimens, including use of extraction and
PCR negative controls, PCR amplification of short, overlapping fragments (see below), and confirmation of all
unique haplotype sequences by way of cloning [24].

A 558 basepair segment of the mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) control region (CR) was amplified as a single
fragment using external primers LGlu and CR522Rb [25]
for the DNA extractions from blood and feather samples
or, in the case of the DNA extractions from museum spec-

imens, as a set of four overlapping fragments not exceeding 180 basepairs in length each [Lglu/MyiopCR1B
(TGCCAATGGTTGCCCTAATAA); MyiopCR2A (GACATTGCATGCTCGTCCTA)/MyiopCR2B (TGGAATTGGAGAGGAGTGTTTT);
MyiopCR3A
(AGCAACTAAACCGAATGATCC)/MyiopCR3B
(TGGGCCTGAAGCTAGTAACG); MyiopCR4A (CCACTCACGAGAAACCATCA)/CR522Rb]. All PCR reactions
were carried out on an MJ Research DNA Engine thermal
cycler in 25 μl reactions containing: ~20–50 ng of DNA,
10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
200 μM dNTPs, 0.5 μM of each primer and 0.5 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems).
Cycling conditions for all primer pairs consisted of 95°C
for 10 minutes, 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 50°C for
30 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds, and a final extension of
72°C for 7 minutes. Double-stranded PCR products were
sequenced using Big Dye 3.1 terminators on an ABI 3730
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Population genetic analyses
Previous work revealed duplication and concerted evolution of the control region in Amazona and Pionus parrots
[25]. Subsequent surveys of mtDNA gene order across the
entire order of parrots via PCR across selected gene junctions has revealed that this duplication is absent in many
parrot species, including M. monachus (Schirtzinger E,
Gonzalez L, Eberhard JR, Graves G, Wright TF, unpublished data). Furthermore, long-range PCR followed by
sequencing of the entire mtDNA genome of M. monachus

indicate incorrect taxonomic assignment.

Results
Haplotypic (h) [26] and nucleotide (π) [26] diversity estimates were calculated based on mtDNA CR sequences as
executed in ARLEQUIN [27]. Pairwise genetic distances
were calculated in PAUP*4.0b10 [28] assuming the
HKY+G model of nucleotide substitution as selected
according to the Akaike information criterion as implemented in Modeltest [29]. Levels of genetic divergence
between samples were calculated with the fixation index
(PhiST) [30] as executed in ARLEQUIN [27]. Because the
HKY model is not implemented in ARLEQUIN the more
inclusive Tamura-Nei (TrN) [31] model with the same
parameters for ti/tv rate and α was used. Significance of
PhiST for all possible pairwise population comparisons
was assessed using 2,000 permutations. Tests for significant geographic structure among subspecies sampled
across the native range were conducted using analysis of
molecular variance (AMOVA) [30]. MtDNA CR sequence
alignments for all four subspecies were further employed
to identify diagnostic nucleotide sites by means of population aggregation analysis [32]. The presence of characters fixed within and differing among populations was
used as evidence to diagnose distinct units.
Network and phylogenetic analyses
Sequences were unambiguously aligned in Clustal X [33]
employing default settings for gap opening and extension
costs. Genealogical relationships among all sampled haplotypes throughout the native range were reconstructed as
a haplotype network using the statistical parsimony
method of Templeton et al. [34] as implemented in TCS,
version 1.06 [35]. Gaps were treated as a 5th character
state. Networks are especially appropriate for inferring
intraspecific gene genealogies because of the potential for
extant ancestral nodes and multifurcating relationships
[29].

A Bayesian haplotype tree was reconstructed using
MrBayes 3.1 [36] assuming the HKY+G model of nucleotide substitution as selected by Modeltest [29] as
described above. The orange-chinned parakeet (Brotogeris
jugularis) was used as an outgroup to root the tree, as previous phylogenetic studies have revealed species from this
genus to be sister to M. monachus [37,38]. The Bayesian
phylogenetic analysis ran four simultaneous chains for
2.0 × 106 total generations, each using a random tree as a
starting point, the default heating scheme, and saving a
tree every 100 generations for a total 20,000 trees. The first
2,000 trees were discarded as burn-in samples and the
remaining 18,000 trees were used to construct a majorityrule consensus tree and derive posterior probability val-

Within subspecies variation
A total of 17 mtDNA CR haplotypes were recovered
among the 77 individuals sampled from across the native
range of the four described subspecies of M. monachus
(GenBank Accession No. EU545521-EU545537). The
number of haplotypes identified ranged from four (M. m.
calita) to eight (M. m. monachus), with levels of haplotypic
and nucleotide diversity relatively consistent across the
subspecies (Table 2). Of the 17 detected haplotypes, three
were shared among a combination of M. m. calita, M. m.
cotorra, and M. m. monachus. One shared haplotype was
widely distributed, sampled in individuals from all three
of these subspecies in disparate localities ranging from
northern (Tucumán province) and central (Entre Rios and
Mendoza provinces) Argentina, to Concepción, Paraguay
and Mato Grosso, Brazil. All five haplotypes recovered for
M. m. luchsi in Bolivia were unique to that subspecies.
Overall, sequence divergence among M. monachus haplotypes recovered from the four subspecies ranged from
0.20% to 1.66% (luchsi01/calita02) based on HKY+G distances.
Among subspecies differentiation
Genetic variation across the samples was highly structured
with significant levels of genetic variation distributed
among, rather than within, the four M. monachus subspecies (p < 0.0001; Table 3a). When the Bolivian M. m. luchsi
was removed from the AMOVA, the results were reversed,
with the vast majority of variation distributed within
(96.41%) rather than among (3.59) subspecies (Table
3b). A similar pattern was revealed by the fixation indices,

highly significant (Table 3c). None of the pairwise comparisons of M. m. calita, M. m. cotorra and M. m. monachus
approached significance. Likewise, M. m. luchsi was diagnosably distinct from each of the other three subspecies,
with the number of diagnostic characters detected ranging
from three (M. m. cotorra, M. m. monachus) to five (M. m.
calita) across the 558 basepairs of the mtDNA CR (Table
3c).
Genealogical relationships
A single haplotype network was reconstructed within
which all haplotypes had a 95% probability of being parsimoniously connected (Figure 2). Overall, the network
was characterized by reticulation and little structure to the
recovered relationships (Figure 2). The only distinct clustering was of the four M. m. luchsi haplotypes sampled in
Bolivia, which were three to four steps different than the
nearest M. m. monachus or M. m. cotorra haplotypes (Figure 2). The remaining haplotypes constituted a mixed
assemblage, exhibiting neither geographic structure nor
clustering patterns consistent with currently described
subspecies boundaries. Results of a Bayesian phylogenetic
analysis mirrored those of the haplotype network, reconstructing a well-supported (posterior probability = 90; Figure 3), monophyletic M. m. luchsi with the remaining
three subspecies forming a paraphyletic assemblage.

Origin of naturalized populations
Three haplotypes were recovered from the 64 individuals
sampled in populations in the eastern United States, all of
which were identical to haplotypes detected in the native
range of M. monachus. The most common haplotype,
detected in the naturalized range at a frequency of 0.63,
was one previously found unique to M. m. monachus
(monachus01; Figure 3). Initially sampled in Entre Rios,
Argentina and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, this haplotype
was fixed in the Bridgeport, CT (n = 9) and Kent County,
RI (n = 1) samplings and was likewise detected at high frequencies in the Miami, FL (0.56) and Edgewater, NJ
(0.55) populations. A second high frequency haplotype
unique to the M. m. monachus subspecies (monachus02;
Figure 3) was found in the Miami, FL (0.40) and Edgewater, NJ (0.45) populations. In the native range, the
monachus02 haplotype was recovered over a wide geographic area, found in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, Soriano,
Uruguay, and throughout sampling localities in northern
and central Argentina (Figure 3). Lastly, a haplotype
shared by M. m. monachus, M. m. calita and M. m. cotorra
in the native range (shared01; Figure 3) was also found at
very low frequency in the Miami, FL population (0.03).

Discussion and conclusion
In this study we employed extensive geographic sampling
and historical DNA analysis to describe patterns of genetic
variation among subspecies of the invasive monk parakeet
in its native range, assess current taxonomic designations,

Myiopsitta monachus taxonomy
The biological relevance of subspecies has been widely
debated since the 1950s [39]. Ernst Mayr, who wrote the
most influential book on speciation analysis [40], also

grappled with the concept of subspecies. Although in early
writings he clearly assigned evolutionary status to subspecies [40], later work directly acknowledged the subjectivity
associated with this level of taxonomic classification,
explicitly stating that subspecies are not units of evolution
[41]. Continentally distributed avian subspecies are a

Bayesian haplotype tree depicting relationships among sampled Myiopsitta monachus haplotypes relative to
their geographic and taxonomic distributions. The names of each haplotype are as in Figure 2. Bayesian posterior probabilities (> 50%) are indicated above the branches. Each column in the associated table is a locality sorted by country with
abbreviations following Table 1. Each row is a haplotype according to its placement in the tree on the left; the number of individuals at that sampling locality exhibiting that particular haplotype is indicated in each cell. Shading represents the subspecies
designation for the distribution of haplotypes according to Figure 1. Bolded italicized numbers indicate the distribution of individuals collected in the naturalized range in the United States. Total number of sampled individuals exhibiting each haplotype
(N) is denoted in the last column. For illustration purposes, accurate branch lengths leading to the outgroup are not shown
(indicated by dashed line).

the population genetic structure indicative of historically
independent units [42].
We share the view of many that an accurate taxonomy
should reflect evolutionary history. The phylogenetic species concept (PSC) offers such an approach, directly linking patterns of evolution with species status [43]. Under
the PSC sensu Cracraft [43], a species is the smallest diagnosable cluster of individual organisms within which

there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent. Applied
to the monk parakeets, three (M. m. calita, M. m. cotorra,
M. m. monachus) of four M. monachus subspecies lacked
diagnostic character support and violated a criterion of
monophyly. The absence of genetic distinctiveness of
these three taxa reflects the uncertainty surrounding the
differences in size and plumage characteristics upon
which they were initially described [11,13]. The lack of
discrete morphological character differences in tandem

with the results presented here suggest that M. m. calita,
M. m. cotorra and M. m. monachus are in need of formal
taxonomic revision.
In contrast to the uncertainty associated with the descriptions of the other three subspecies, the controversy surrounding M. m. luchsi has been related to its relative
distinctiveness, and proposed elevation to allospecies status [14]. Restricted to the intermontane valleys in Bolivia,
M. m. luchsi is morphologically distinct from the other
subspecies [11], including M. m. cotorra, despite the fact
that their known ranges come within 175 km of each
other [44]. Moreover, M. m. luchsi is altitudinally distributed between 1300–3000 m, in sharp contrast to other
monk parakeet taxa, which are routinely found below
1000 m. Another unique characteristic involves the cliffnesting behavior of M. m. luchsi, which contrasts with the
colonial, tree-nesting exhibited across the remainder of
the range of M. monachus. This assorted evidence has been
used to elevate M. luchsi to allospecies status, forming a
superspecies with the remaining taxa of M. monachus [14].
Although this taxonomic revision is not generally recognized, the results of the current study further highlight the
uniqueness of this taxon. In addition to displaying
between three and five diagnostic molecular characters
relative to M. m. calita, M. m. cotorra, and M. m. monachus
(Table 2), the Bolivian luchsi formed a well-supported,
monophyletic group based on the mtDNA control region
sequence data (Figure 3). Collectively, the morphological,
behavioral and genetic data support M. luchsi as a distinct,
phylogenetic species [32,43] and suggest that a formal taxonomic revision is in order.
Origin of North American populations
Over the past 35 years, monk parakeets have been
recorded on U.S. Christmas Bird Counts in 14 states: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington D.C./Virginia [13].
Other states where monk parakeet nesting has been
observed include Alabama [45], California [46], Louisiana [18], North Carolina [47], South Carolina [48], and
Rhode Island [49]. The United States Fish and Wildlife
Service conducted an eradication campaign from 1970 to
1975 that effectively eliminated populations in California
and reduced the naturalized range of monk parakeets in
the U.S. to seven localities in five states [50]. Since 1975,
M. monachus populations in the U.S. grew exponentially
and spread throughout the country to its present distribution [19]. Currently, two of the largest naturalized populations of M. monachus reside in Florida and southern
Connecticut. Both appear to be expanding in size and geographic distribution. The Florida population, in particular, continues to increase at an exponential rate, with a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/217

recent study by Pruett-Jones et al. [51] estimating a
statewide population size of 18,025 to 32,044.
Despite multiple introductions and the widespread distribution of M. monachus in the U.S., we detected a low level
of haplotype diversity across four sampling localities in
Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey and Rhode Island. Only
three different haplotypes were recovered, the most common of which (monachus01; 0.63) was found in all four
localities and was identical to a haplotype sampled from
M. m. monachus in a localized area in eastern Argentina in
Entre Rios to Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil on the Uruguayan
border. The other high-frequency haplotype in the naturalized range (monachus02; 0.34) was also specific to M.
m. monachus and was likewise sampled in Rio Grande do
Sul, Brazil, Soriano, Uruguay and a number of localities in
central and northern Argentina. These results are consistent with preliminary morphometric analyses (M. Avery,
unpublished) as well as trapping records that indicate that
the vast majority of birds captured for the pet trade were
M. m. monachus exported from eastern Argentina and Uruguay [13]. The concordance between the trapping records
and our genetic results support the idea that the invasion
of monk parakeets has been facilitated, at least initially, by
their widespread presence in the international pet bird
trade. As a likely source of large and repeated release
events, the international trade in parrots may have historically exerted significant propagule pressure, generally a
key determinant of invasion success in birds and other
taxa [52,53]. Nuclear data and additional geographical
sampling may provide important sources of historical
information for further testing this hypothesis.
The Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 prohibits the
importation of monk parakeets into the United States,
reducing the chances of future introductions of wildcaught individuals [54]. However, monk parakeets,
known as Quaker parakeets in the pet trade, remain one
of the most popular cage birds and are widely bred and
sold by aviculturists in the U.S. At the state level, local
laws vary, with some states banning the possession of
monk parakeets while others placing no restrictions on
them. Nevertheless, this domestic trade in monk parakeets remains the most likely source of introductions into
states not currently reporting self-sustaining breeding
populations [22].
By and large, it is likely that non-native populations of
monk parakeets will continue to grow. One reason is that
the popularity of monk parakeets has in recent years
extended to introduced populations. Efforts to remove
birds and nests from electric utility structures in Connecticut, Illinois, Florida, Washington and New Jersey have
often met with substantial resistance by a vocal subset of
the local communities. In addition, current control strate-

gies have not effectively prevented the establishment and
continued growth of naturalized populations in the U.S.
and Western Europe, most notably in Spain [17]. Unlike
other psittacines, monk parakeets are not constrained by
the availability of nesting cavities. Rather, they construct
nests of sticks and branches and they tend to select manmade structures as nesting substrates [55]. Furthermore,
by exploiting feeding opportunities provided by humans,
monk parakeets persist in even cold temperate winters
[56]. Population growth and expansion seems assured, as
impractically large management efforts would be needed
to reverse the trend [57]. Consequently, broader understanding of the mechanisms of monk parakeet invasion
success and local adaptation constitute important areas
for future basic and applied research.
