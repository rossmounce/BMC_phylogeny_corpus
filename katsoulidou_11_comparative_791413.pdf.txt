Abstract
Background: HIV-1 is characterized by increased genetic heterogeneity which tends to hinder the reliability of
detection and accuracy of HIV-1 RNA quantitation assays.
Methods: In this study, the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 (Abbott RealTime) assay was compared to the Roche Cobas
TaqMan HIV-1 (Cobas TaqMan) and the Siemens Versant HIV-1 RNA 3.0 (bDNA 3.0) assays, using clinical samples of
various viral load levels and subtypes from Greece, where the recent epidemiology of HIV-1 infection has been
characterized by increasing genetic diversity and a marked increase in subtype A genetic strains among newly
diagnosed infections.
Results: A high correlation was observed between the quantitative results obtained by the Abbott RealTime and
the Cobas TaqMan assays. Viral load values quantified by the Abbott RealTime were on average lower than those
obtained by the Cobas TaqMan, with a mean (SD) difference of -0.206 (0.298) log10 copies/ml. The mean
differences according to HIV-1 subtypes between the two techniques for samples of subtype A, B, and non-A/nonB were 0.089, -0.262, and -0.298 log10 copies/ml, respectively. Overall, differences were less than 0.5 log10 for 85%
of the samples, and >1 log10 in only one subtype B sample. Similarly, Abbott RealTime and bDNA 3.0 assays
yielded a very good correlation of quantitative results, whereas viral load values assessed by the Abbott RealTime
were on average higher (mean (SD) difference: 0.160 (0.287) log10 copies/ml). The mean differences according to
HIV-1 subtypes between the two techniques for subtype A, B and non-A/non-B samples were 0.438, 0.105 and
0.191 log10 copies/ml, respectively. Overall, the majority of samples (86%) differed by less than 0.5 log10, while none
of the samples showed a deviation of more than 1.0 log10.
Conclusions: In an area of changing HIV-1 subtype pattern, the Abbott RealTime assay showed a high correlation
and good agreement of results when compared both to the Cobas TaqMan and bDNA 3.0 assays, for all HIV-1
subtypes tested. All three assays could determine viral load from samples of different HIV-1 subtypes adequately.
However, assay variation should be taken into account when viral load monitoring of the same individual is
assessed by different systems.

Background
Quantitative measurement of plasma viral load provides
a great insight into the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection
and constitutes an essential parameter of infection prognosis and optimal management of clinical patients [1-4].
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) results in
a sharp decline of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels in patients
and therefore initiation as well as treatment changes
rely on correct determination of viral load levels
[5,6]. Given the significance of accurate viral load measurements for optimal management of patients, the
requirement for ultra-sensitive assays is crucial. A variety of commercial assays, are available for viral RNA
levels quantification utilizing target or signal amplification technologies [7-12]. A major innovation of target
amplification techniques is the development of assays
that monitor accumulation of products in real-time,
which are characterized by increased sensitivity,
expanded dynamic range, diminished risk of contamination and high throughput [13,14].
HIV-1 shows a high level of genetic heterogeneity.
Group M viruses are responsible for the majority of
HIV-1 infections globally and according to the HIV
nomenclature proposal, they are subdivided into nine
subtypes (A-D, F-H, J and K), sub-subtypes (e.g. A1, A2,
F1, F2), several circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)
and unique recombinants http://hiv.lanl.gov [15,16]. In
Greece increasing genetic diversity of HIV-1 has been
documented and specifically an increase over time of
the prevalence of non-B subtypes, particularly subtype A
infections, has been reported [17].
Nucleic acid or signal amplification assays rely on the
use of sequence specific primers and/or probes. HIV-1
increased heterogeneity may affect assay performance as
the presence of natural polymorphisms in the target
regions may reduce or inhibit hybridization thus compromising the reliability of viral load quantitation
[18-20]. Virus subtype could therefore have a direct
influence on assay performance.
The objective of this study was to compare the performance of the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 assay (referred to
as the Abbott RealTime) (Abbott Laboratories, Wiesbaden, Germany) with the Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 Test
(referred to as the Cobas TaqMan) (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Manheim, Germany), and the Versant HIV-1
RNA 3.0 assay (referred to as the bDNA 3.0) (Siemens,
Tarrytown, N.Y.) in order to determine the effect of
viral heterogeneity on quantification of viral load.
Methods
Subjects and specimens

Whole blood was collected in sterile tubes with K 3
EDTA as anticoagulant.

Page 2 of 11

Within 4 h of drawing the blood, tubes were centrifuged at 1200× g for 12 min at room temperature. After
centrifugation, aliquots of plasma were prepared and
immediately frozen at -70°C until tested on the first
thaw. This study was performed in compliance with regulations concerning human subject research and was
approved by the Athens University Medical School
Ethics Committee.
Study design

The performance of the Abbott RealTime was compared to the performance of two pre-existing methods
for viral load quantification routinely used in our
laboratory. Two different sets of clinical samples from
patients with established HIV-1 infection with or without antiviral therapy, previously assessed either by the
Cobas TaqMan or the bDNA 3.0, were retrospectively
chosen.
Comparison of Abbott RealTime and Cobas TaqMan

A total of 149 plasma samples derived from HIV-1 positive patients of various viral load levels were retrospectively selected for testing with Abbott RealTime. Viral
load levels of the same samples had been previously
determined by the Cobas TaqMan by which 17 samples
were found to have HIV-1 RNA values of <40 copies/
ml, 21 samples had values ranging from 40 to 500
copies/ml and 111 samples had a viral load of >500
copies/ml (Table 1).
Comparison of Abbott RealTime and bDNA 3.0

A total of 161 plasma patient samples the viral load of
which had been previously determined by the bDNA 3.0
were selected for testing with Abbott RealTime. bDNA
HIV-1 RNA values were <50 copies/ml for 12 samples,
32 samples had viral load measurements ranging from
50 to 500 copies/ml and 117 samples were found with a
viral load of >500 copies/ml (Table 1).

Abbott RealTime assay

The assay uses reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) technology with homogeneous realtime fluorescent detection [21]. Sample preparation was
performed manually according to the manufacturer’s
specifications (Sample Preparation SystemDNA, Promega
Madison, WI, USA). RNA was extracted from 0.6 ml of
plasma using magnetic microparticle technology and the
HIV-1 RNA quantification range of the assay in the current protocol was 40-10,000,000 copies/ml. Isolated
RNA was added manually to the prepared master mix,
followed by real-time PCR amplification. Reverse transcription, PCR amplification, and detection/quantitation
reactions, were performed on the Abbott m2000rt platform. Detection of PCR product in real time is based on
a partially double-stranded probe which targets the integrase (IN) region of the polymerase (pol) gene [21]. The
probe consists of two DNA fragments of different
lengths: the longer fragment is complementary to the
target DNA and is bound to a fluorescent marker, while
the shorter fragment holds the quencher molecule.
When the target DNA is not present, the long probe
binds to the quencher probe and no fluorescence is
detected; when the target DNA is present, the long
probe preferentially binds to the target DNA and is able
to fluoresce giving a quantifiable signal [21-23].
Cobas TaqMan Test (for use with the High Pure System)

Cobas TaqMan is a competitive real-time RT-PCR based
assay [24-26] and uses a dual labeled fluorogenic probe
(TaqMan probe) targeting a highly conserved region of
the HIV-1 gag gene. Sample preparation was performed
manually using the High Pure System Viral Nucleic
Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Manheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s specifications
from 0.5 ml of plasma sample. The Cobas TaqMan 48
Analyzer was used for automated real-time RT-PCR and
detection of PCR products [27-30]. Results calculations
were performed based on parameters defined in the
Test Definition File (TDF), in combination with AMPLILINK 3.0.1 software. HIV-1 RNA quantification range of
the assay was 40-10,000,000 copies/ml according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
bDNA 3.0 assay

HIV-RNA was extracted manually from 1.0 ml of
plasma sample. The bDNA 3.0 has a sandwich nucleic
acid hybridization format and relies on signal amplification technology. Briefly, HIV-1 RNA is hybridized to a
series of oligonucleotide probes complementary to
highly conserved regions of the HIV-1 pol gene [7,31].
Hybridization and detection are carried out in a
semiautomated system 340 bDNA analyzer (Siemens
Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY), which

Page 3 of 11

automatically performs all incubations, washing steps,
readings, and data processing. The assay has a dynamic
range of 50 to 500,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml.
All three assays were carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Subtyping

HIV-1 subtype classification was performed on all samples, by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.
Specifically, the sequences of protease (PR) and partial
reverse transcriptase (RT) genes, used for HIV drug
resistance routine testing, were determined either by the
TrueGene HIV-1 Genotyping kit (Bayer Healthcare,
LLC, Tarrytown, NY, USA) or the ViroSeq™ HIV-1
Genotyping System (Abbott Molecular Diagnostics, IL,
USA). HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants were determined by phylogenetic analyses using a set of reference
sequences including all previously described subtypes
and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) available
from http://hiv-web.lanl.gov. Phylogenetic analysis of
HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants was performed using
Neighbor-joining (NJ) method with a HKY model of
nucleotide substitution, as implemented in PAUP*4.0b10
[32]. Unclassified sequences were further examined for
any evidence of recombination using bootscanning analysis, as implemented in Simplot 3.2 http://sray.med.
som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware/. Putative recombination pattern was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis in
each individual fragment with a distinct subtype
assignment.
Statistical analysis

Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to assess the
strength of linear association between the log transformed values of Abbott RealTime and other methods.
As the correlation coefficient provides information on
the correlation but not on the agreement of the two
methods, we further employed Deming regression [33]
and Bland-Altman analysis [34,35]. Specifically, the fitted
regression line, obtained using Deming regression for
each comparison (Abbott RealTime versus Cobas TaqMan, and Abbott RealTime versus bDNA 3.0), was compared to the line of equality by testing the two-tailed
hypothesis of slope = 1 and intercept = 0. Deming
regression is similar to ordinary least-squares regression
but it takes into account that viral load levels are measured with error by both methods. In the Bland-Altman
analysis, the differences between the methods were
plotted against their mean. The lack of agreement was
then summarized by calculating the bias estimated by
−
the mean difference d and the standard deviation of
the differences (SD). The limits of agreement were then
−
estimated as d ± 1.96 * SD .

Results
Comparison of Abbott RealTime and Cobas TaqMan

The comparative performance of the Abbott RealTime
and the Cobas TaqMan was assessed on 149 specimens.
HIV-1 subtype information was available for 126 of
them, with the following subtype distribution: 20 samples were characterized as subtype A, 90 as subtype B,
seven samples as subtype C, one sample as subtype
D, three samples as subtype F1, one sample as subtype
G, two samples were found to be intersubtype recombinant strains A/B and two samples were characterized as
CRF04_cpx Subtype determination was not possible for
23 samples either because of the low viral load or
because of sample exhaustion (Table 2).
Of the 149 samples 127 (85.2%) had a detectable viral
load by both assays, 17 (11.4%) were undetectable by
both assays and five (3.4%) samples were quantified only
by Cobas TaqMan at 43.4, 50.8, 65.5, 257 and 843
copies/ml, respectively whereas the same five samples
were reported as having HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/ml by
the Abbott RealTime. Thus, the detection rate of Abbott
RealTime was 127/149 (85.2%) versus 132/149 (88.6%)
of the Cobas TaqMan. Retesting of the discrepant samples by both assays revealed that only one sample characterized as subtype B (previously quantified at 843
copies/ml) was repeatedly reactive by Cobas TaqMan
(674 copies/ml at retesting), while it was repeatedly
non-reactive by Abbott RealTime. The remaining four
samples were undetectable by both assays at following
retesting (Table 3).
The two assays showed a high degree of correlation
(Figure 1), and the linear regression equation was
log 10 (Abbott RealTime copies/ml) = -0.408 + 1.05 ×
log 10 (Cobas TaqMan copies/ml), (correlation coefficient: r = 0.960, p < 0.001).

Agreement between the two methods was calculated
by the method of Bland Altman by plotting differences
(log10 Abbott RealTime - log10 Cobas TaqMan) against
the mean obtained by the two assays (Figure 2). On
average, the Abbott RealTime gave values of 0.206 log10
copies/ml (SD:0.298, 95% limits of agreement, -0.790 to
0.379) lower than those obtained with the Cobas TaqMan assay. When differences were analyzed according
to HIV-1 subtypes (classified in three groups) the mean
differences (95% limits of agreement) between the two
techniques for samples of subtype A, subtype B, subtype
non-A/non-B were 0.089 (-0.602, 0.779), -0.262 (-0.739,
0.215), and -0.298 (-0.971, 0.375) log 10 copies/ml,
respectively.
Among the 127 patient samples in which viral load
levels were determined by both assays, 108 samples (85%)
differed less than 0.5 log10 copies/ml. A total of 18 samples (14.1%) differed from 0.5 log10 to 1.0 log10 copies/
ml, with the following HIV-1 subtype distribution: two
samples were of subtype A, 10 were found as subtype B,
three as subtype C, two as subtype F1, and one as CRF04.
Finally a viral load value difference between the Abbott
RealTime and the Cobas TaqMan of >1.0 log10 copies/ml
was observed for one subtype B sample (0.8%) with
Abbott RealTime reporting the lowest value.
Comparison of Abbott RealTime and bDNA 3.0

The comparative performance of the Abbott RealTime
and the bDNA 3.0 was assessed on 161 specimens.
HIV-1 subtype information was available for 134 of
them, with the following subtype distribution: 20 samples were characterized as subtype A, 103 sample as
subtype B, one sample as subtype C, three samples
as subtype D, one sample as subtype F1, one sample as
subtype G, one sample as subtype H, one sample was
found to be an intersubtype recombinant strain A/B,
two were CRF02_AG and one CRF04. HIV-1 subtype
could not be determined for the remaining 27 samples,
because of insufficient RNA levels or a lack of sample
availability (Table 2).
Among the tested samples 142 (88.2%) had a detectable
viral load by both assays, 10 (6.2%) were undetectable by

both assays and nine (5.6%) showed discordant results.
Specifically, discrepant results were observed for seven
samples the viral load levels of which were reported at 54,
62, 66, 74, 76, 337 and 674 copies/ml by the bDNA 3.0.
The same samples were found to have a viral load of <40
by the Abbott RealTime. Furthermore, two samples with
viral load levels determined by the Abbott RealTime at 50
and 143 copies/ml, were reported to have a viral load of
<50 copies/ml by the bDNA 3.0. The detection rate of
Abbott RealTime, therefore, was 144/161 (89.4%) versus
149/161 (92.5%) of the bDNA 3.0. However, at the
repeated testing of the seven samples detected only, six
samples were reported to have viral load values of <50
copies/ml by the bDNA 3.0 and only one (previously
quantified at 337 copies/ml) was quantified at 152 copies/
ml (Table 4), whereas all were reported to have viral load
levels of <40 copies/ml by Abbott RealTime. Finally,
repeated testing of the two samples detected only by the
Abbott RealTime was not possible because sufficient sample quantities were not available for further investigation.

Figure 3 shows the scatter plot of log10 HIV-1 RNA
copies/ml determined by the bDNA 3.0 and the Abbott
RealTime assays, using specimens with detectable RNA
levels by both assays. The fitted regression line was
described by the equation: log 10 (Abbott RealTime
copies/ml) = -0.103 + 1.07 × log10 (bDNA 3.0 copies/
ml), (correlation coefficient: r = 0.961, p < 0.001).
Agreement between the two methods was calculated
by the method of Bland Altman by plotting differences
(log10 Abbott RealTime - log10 bDNA 3.0) against the
mean obtained by the two assays (Figure 4). Viral loads
values obtained by the two assays differed on average by
0.160 log 10 copies/ml (SD:0,287, 95% limits of agreement:-0.402, 0.721). The mean differences (95% limits of
agreement) between the two techniques for samples of
subtype A, subtype B and subtype non-A/non-B were
0.438 (-0.097, 0.973), 0.105 (-0. 395, 0.604) and 0.191
(-0.418, 0.800), log10 copies/ml, respectively.
Among the 142 samples with a detectable viral load by
both assays, 122 samples (86%) differed by less than

Discussion
Real-time RT-PCR assays for HIV-1 viral load measurements offer the potential of increased sensitivity,
expanded dynamic range, diminished risk of contamination and high through-put. Given the importance of
accurate viral load measurement for evaluating the efficacy of therapies and monitoring disease progression,
and taking into account the vast genetic heterogeneity
of HIV-1, it was our objective to compare the performance of the Abbott RealTime assay with the Cobas
TaqMan and the bDNA 3.0 assays, using clinical samples from Greece. The recent epidemiology of HIV-1
infection in Greece has been characterized by increasing
genetic diversity and a marked increase in subtype A
genetic strains. Notably, subtype A infections have been
found at similar frequency to subtype B among the

recently infected individuals [17]. Due to the importance
of HIV-1 RNA levels as a marker for HAART initiation
and clinical management of HIV-infected individuals,
the performance of the Abbott RealTime assay was
questioned on a set of viral isolates including subtype A
variants which have been shown to circulate in the form
of a monophyletic clade in Greece. Since all these
strains share a recent common ancestor, potential natural polymorphisms accumulating in regions targeted by
Abbott RealTime could have caused discrepancies in the
quantification of HIV-1 RNA that may also affect clinical practice.
Recently, Abbott RealTime with manual sample preparation was compared to the Roche Cobas Ampliprep/
Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor v1.5 [36]. In the present
study, Abbott RealTime with manual sample preparation
was compared to two other ultra-sensitive assays, the
Cobas TaqMan and the bDNA 3.0, in a routine setting
of an AIDS reference laboratory, focusing on the inclusion of clinical samples of various viral load levels and
various HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs. In all three assays

the HIV-1 RNA extraction was performed manually, as
that was the available protocol in Greece at the time.
A panel of 149 clinical samples previously tested with
the Cobas TaqMan was also tested with the Abbott
RealTime. Overall, the viral load results obtained with
the two assays had a good correlation (r = 0.96). Correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.96 have been
reported previously [19,37-39].
All unquantifiable by Cobas TaqMan samples were
also unquantifiable by Abbott RealTime. However, five
samples previously quantified by Cobas TaqMan were
undetectable by Abbott RealTime (Table 3). The possibility of contamination for these five samples was
excluded. It should be noted that these five samples
were selected according to their previous Cobas TaqMan result and three of them had marginally positive
values (43.3 to 65.5 copies/ml). In order to determine
whether the discordance between the two assays
was reproducible, the five samples were retested by
both assays, in which case all but one samples were
found undetectable by both assays. One sample which

previously quantified at 843 copies/ml was repeatedly
reactive by Cobas TaqMan at 674 copies/ml (Table 3).
The differences between the retesting values obtained by
Cobas TaqMan could possibly be explained by the fact
that the samples had a very low viral load. Measurements at such low levels are influenced by the inherent
variability of assay technology, since the coefficient of
variation for all these assays is greatest near the limits of
their dynamic ranges. Indeed, increased variability in the
lower viral load range (log2) seems to be typical for
most viral load assays [22,23] and has been observed in
previous comparative studies [26,31].
Other factors encountered that may have affected the
reproducibility of HIV-1 RNA quantification include
operator performance, test lot and the long-term storage
of frozen plasma. In fact, because of the long period of
time between assays we were unable to control for operator variability or test lot. Furthermore, although optimal
storage conditions for HIV-1 RNA quantification have

been followed [40], prolonged storage (12 months) of frozen plasma could possibly influence the values obtained
at retesting especially in samples of such low viral load
[40,41]. Interestingly, one subtype B sample repeatedly
reactive by Cobas TaqMan at 843 copies/ml and 674
copies/ml could not be detected by Abbott RealTime at
repeating the assay. This could possibly be explained by
the presence of mismatches within primer/probe binding
sites of the assay.
The viral load values assessed by Abbott RealTime in
this study were on average lower (-0.206 log10 copies/
ml) than those of Cobas TaqMan. This finding is in
accordance with earlier studies where lower viral load
values were also observed by the Abbott RealTime compared to the Cobas TaqMan [37-39,42], with the mean
difference ranging from -0.34 to -0.20 log10 copies/ml.
On the contrary, Gueudin et al., found an underestimation of viral load values by the Cobas TaqMan compared with the Abbott RealTime [19]. Moreover, in a

Katsoulidou et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:10
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/10

recent study by Scott et al [23], a mean difference of
0.125 log10 copies/ml between the Abbott RealTime and
the Cobas TaqMan has been reported in HIV-1 patients
of subtype C. In the present study, differences between
the two measurements exceeded 0.5 log10 copies/ml for
14% of the samples. Previously published studies
reported differences of more than 0.5 log 10 copies/ml
(10.4% to 36.8%) in paired results between the two
assays [19,23,38].
Interestingly, a more substantial difference (>1.0 log10)
was observed for one subtype B sample for which lower
viral load values were detected by the Abbott RealTime.
The reason for this misquantification is unclear and
needs to be further investigated. One likely explanation
for this difference in HIV-1 RNA quantification is the
existence of mismatches within primer- or probebinding sites that can have a significant impact on
detection and accuracy of quantitation, although Abbott
RealTime targets a highly conserved region of the HIV1 genome, and reagents, cycling conditions, and probe
design have been optimized for mismatch tolerance
[21,22,43]. In earlier comparative studies between the
two assays, viral load misquantifications of more than
1.0 log 10 copies/ml have involved non-B subtypes
(mainly CRF02_AG strains) with the Abbott RealTime
generating higher viral load values compared to the
Cobas TaqMan [19,23,44]. The genomic variability of
HIV hinders the development of universal primers and
probes for genomic hybridization. This holds for all HIV
strains of different subtypes [45]. Most genomes available in sequence banks for primer and probe selection
are mainly subtype B, with non-B strains representing a
minority. Therefore, the risk of mismatches at primer
and probe target sites is higher for non-B subtypes.
However, even within subtype B, a simple synonymous
mutation may reduce hybridization efficiency resulting
in failed detection or inaccurate quantitation [19].
The Abbott RealTime was compared to bDNA 3.0
using 161 clinical plasma samples of various viral load
levels and subtypes and a high correlation (r = 0.96) of
the viral load results obtained by both assays was
observed. Similar correlations of these two assays have
been reported in the literature [22,46].
The Abbott RealTime could quantify two, undetected
by bDNA 3.0, samples (viral load values 50 and 143
copies/ml). The assay could not be repeated for the
two samples because of insufficient sample. Furthermore, a discrepancy between the two assays was initially observed for seven samples with detectable viral
load levels by bDNA 3.0 (viral load values ranging
from 55 to 674 copies/ml) and undetectable viral load
levels by the Abbott RealTime. However, retesting of
the samples by both assays, reported all but one

Page 9 of 11

samples undetectable by both assays (Table 4). The
sample which previously quantified at 337 copies/ml
was repeatedly reactive by bDNA 3.0 at a lower value
of 152 copies/ml (Table 4). The possibility of contamination for these seven samples was excluded. As discussed previously, the differences between the retesting
values obtained by bDNA 3.0 could be a result of very
low viral load titers and prolonged sample storage.
Finally, the sample which could not be detected by
Abbott RealTime was of undetermined subtype. The
presence of mismatches within primer/probe binding
sites of the assay could possibly account for this
discrepancy.
The viral load values assessed by the Abbott RealTime in
this study were on average higher (0.160 log10 copies/ml)
than those obtained by the bDNA 3.0, and this observation was consistent for all subtypes and in particular for
subtype A. Between the two assays mean differences ranging from -0.14 to -0.01 log 10 copies/ml have been
reported previously [43,47,48]. In accordance with previous data [46], the majority of samples with a detectable
viremia (86%) did not differ more than 0.5 log10 copies/
ml among paired results. Notably, none of the samples
differed more than 1.0 log10 copies/ml among the two
assays.
Overall, the properties of the assays used for diagnostic purposes, such as the ones utilized in this study, in
terms of how laborious, time consuming and cost effective they may be, vary. The overall turnaround time of
the Abbott RealTime and Cobas TaqMan assays is significantly shorter than that of the bDNA 3.0 assay (5 h
15 min and ~24 h, respectively) as the latter involves a
longer preparation process and a 16-18 hours incubation, whereas the two real-time assays require a two
hour nucleic acid extraction step and a fully automated
amplification and detection step. The assay sample
throughput of Abbott RealTime as well as Cobas Taqman assays is 42 samples each in a full working day,
whereas bDNA 3.0 assay has sample throughput of 84
samples per working day (plus the 16-18 h incubation).
Although in this study the nucleic acid extraction step
of Abbott RealTime and Cobas Taqman assays were
performed manually, it is important to consider that
both assays have options for increased testing scales
with continuous sample loading on the automated
extractor systems, which are not yet available in our lab.
In that case, both assays can perform 96 samples/run
with the m2000sp/m2000rt and COBAS Ampliprep/
COBAS Taqman respectively. Furthermore, the two
real-time assays require an initial volume of 0.5 and
0.6 ml, in contrast to the bDNA 3.0 assay that needs
1 ml, which may be a significant advantage where availability of sample volume is a matter.

Conclusions
In this study, subtype-related variability in Abbott RealTime performance was evaluated by using samples from
patients infected with HIV-1 subtype Α, Β and non-A/
non-B (including circulating recombinant forms) strains.
Specimens were quantified by Abbott RealTime with
comparable viral load measurements to the other two
assays. The viral loads obtained showed variations, with
mean differences of -0.298 to 0.089 log10 copies/ml and
0.105 to 0.438 log10 copies/ml, depending on the subtype and the assay of choice. Thus, Abbott RealTime
with manual extraction is an acceptable alternative to
the conventional Cobas TaqMan and bDNA 3.0 assays
for quantification of HIV-1 RNA in daily clinical routine
and can be used for monitoring disease progression and
the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy. Despite the strong
correlation and good agreement observed between the
Abbott RealTime and the other two assays, ongoing vigilance is recommended to evaluate assay performance
with existing and emerging divergent strains. Furthermore, care is necessary when monitoring of viral load is
performed with different assays, due to assay variability
which may increase the risk of over- or underestimation
of results. Finally, in accordance with relevant studies
[44,49], in cases of discrepancy between viral load and
CD4 count or clinical observations, measurement of
plasma HIV-1 RNA with an alternative assay in order to
highlight underestimation is reccmmended.
