Abstract
Background: Traditional comparative morphological analyses and subsequent three-dimensional
reconstructions suffer from a number of drawbacks. This is particularly evident in the case of soft
tissue studies that are technically demanding, time-consuming, and often prone to produce
artefacts. These problems can partly be overcome by employing non-invasive, destruction-free
imaging techniques, in particular micro-computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.
Results: Here, we employed high-field magnetic resonance imaging techniques to gather
numerous data from members of a major marine invertebrate taxon, the sea urchins (Echinoidea).
For this model study, 13 of the 14 currently recognized high-ranking subtaxa (orders) of this group
of animals were analyzed. Based on the acquired datasets, interactive three-dimensional models
were assembled. Our analyses reveal that selected soft tissue characters can even be used for
phylogenetic inferences in sea urchins, as exemplified by differences in the size and shape of the
gastric caecum found in the Irregularia.
Conclusion: The main focus of our investigation was to explore the possibility to systematically
visualize the internal anatomy of echinoids obtained from various museum collections. We show
that, in contrast to classical preparative procedures, magnetic resonance imaging can give rapid,
destruction-free access to morphological data from numerous specimens, thus extending the range
of techniques available for comparative studies of invertebrate morphology.

Background
For centuries, comparative zoomorphological analyses
have formed the backbone of phylogenetic inferences.
Data on the external and internal morphology of specimens were obtained by dissecting and sectioning selected

representative species. These traditional procedures are
technically demanding as well as time-consuming and
irretrievably alter or even destroy the specimen. Further
complications arise from the difficult three-dimensional
(3D) reconstruction of the structures observed. Artefacts,

for example deformation or compression of histological
slices, and the problematic alignment of sections make
3D reconstructions a laborious and often highly subjective procedure. The problems encountered are further
aggravated by the logistic challenges that arise when comparative studies on selected species of a whole taxon are to
be carried out. For example, in case of sea urchins (Echinoidea, Echinodermata), some species are deep-sea dwellers or confined to remote regions of the world. It is
therefore a considerable problem to obtain these animals
in a freshly fixed state. Understandably, the desirable use
of specimens from museum collections is usually not permitted for invasive and destructive analyses.
The application of non-invasive imaging techniques such
as micro-computed tomography (μCT; see, for example,
[1-8]) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; see below)
has substantially increased in basic morphological
research. Whereas μCT is mainly used to display hard tissue such as bone or calcite structures, MRI provides
images depicting primarily soft tissue anatomy. MRI is
based on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and is predominantly used to measure the distribution of hydrogen protons within a sample. Image contrast is achieved due to the different physical properties of
tissues. Both μCT and MRI produce standardized digital
data, principally permitting an interactive access through
virtual collections or voxel libraries as envisaged previously [9,10]. This data represents the unaltered structural
composition of the specimen, in contrast to classical histological or dissection techniques and apart from fixation.
In the light of these and other recent technological
advances, Budd and Olsson [11] refer to the renaissance
of morphology, calling for a more extensive use of noninvasive and non-destructive imaging techniques and 3D
applications. Since many of the specimens in natural history collections are conserved in alcohol, forming the socalled wet collections, non-invasive imaging techniques
might be employed to reveal the internal and external
anatomy of preserved, scientifically irreplaceable specimens. This extended use of museum specimens for comparative anatomical studies would allow for a substantial
increase in taxon sampling on one hand, and on the other
would minimize the ecological impact of such analyses.
The feasibility of MRI studies to reveal soft tissue characteristics of invertebrates was demonstrated by studies on
crabs [12,13], squid [14], crayfish [15,16], oysters [17,18],
spiders [19], demosponges [20], and insects [21-29] (see
also the review by Hart et al. [30]). Ziegler and Angenstein
[31] used living and freshly fixed specimens of the sea
urchin Psammechinus miliaris (Müller, 1771) and showed
that members of this taxon are likely to be suitable for
detailed MRI studies. These studies yielded imaging
results comparable to manual dissection and were corre-

lated with histological data. To achieve better resolved
images of the complex internal anatomy of sea urchins,
the application of higher magnetic field strengths was proposed [32]. However, all of the studies mentioned above
were restricted to the analysis of single specimens or species in a non-systematic context.
For systematic analyses, however, sea urchins appear particularly suitable. Like sea stars or sea cucumbers, they are
part of a major deuterostome taxon, the Echinodermata,
which shares a common ancestor with diverse groups
such as acorn worms (Enteropneusta), tunicates (Tunicata), and vertebrates (Vertebrata) [33]. Owing to the calcified skeleton found in sea urchins, palaeontologists
have access to a rich fossil record permitting thorough
ground-truthing of phylogenetic hypotheses that are
based upon molecular or morphological datasets [34,35].
Recently, the importance of these animals for evolutionary and developmental inferences has been further
emphasized by results obtained through the sequencing
of the genome of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus (Stimpson, 1857) [36].
Sea urchins are spherical, oval or flattened free-moving
echinoderms covered with spines. Their soft tissue anatomy is characterized by a dominant digestive tract, a varying number of gonads, and the highly specialized water
vascular system with its external appendages, the tube or
ambulacral feet. The space between the major organ systems is composed of the main body cavities (the so-called
perivisceral coeloms) that are filled with coelomic fluid
[37]. Therefore, echinoids possess several of the internal
structures encountered in most other taxa, although a
number of highly specialized organs are present as well.
This taxon can thus serve as a model for analyses using
non-invasive imaging techniques on a broad systematic
scale.
The purpose of our study was to explore the possibility of
generating high-resolution 3D MRI datasets from selected
specimens of a major invertebrate taxon. For the first time,
a non-invasive imaging technique is employed for systematic comparative analyses. We show that MRI permits the
rapid acquisition of digitized morphological data on a
broad scale and the construction of 3D models that can be
made interactively accessible on the Web. In addition, our
approach can be employed to compare the internal anatomy of sea urchins to evaluate such datasets for evolutionary inferences.

and contrasting protocols for broader systematic analyses.
Living specimens of P. miliaris were made available
through the Biologische Anstalt Helgoland, Germany
(BAH). Several dozen sea urchins were kept in the aquarium facilities of the Institut für Biologie, Freie Universität
Berlin, Germany, for subsequent scanning and contrasting
experiments.
The first set of analyses was conducted to compare different specimens of freshly fixed sea urchins. Imaging was
performed initially at a resolution of (81 μm)3 using different imaging protocols with specimens of almost identical size. This analysis showed that although slight
differences in anatomical makeup did occur, localization,
arrangement and overall shape of the internal organs did
not differ significantly. In the specimens depicted (Figure
1A and 1B), this is exemplified by the almost identical
shapes of both Aristotle's lanterns and the localization
and shape of the digestive tract components. The structure
of the wall of the sea urchin lower gut loop (also termed
the stomach) was undulated in both specimens, whereas
the horizontal sections of the upper gut loop (also termed
the intestine) showed a smooth structure. The digestive
tract of one specimen was partly filled (Figure 1A), while
the digestive tract of the other specimen was empty, apart
from tiny objects (Figure 1B). Another striking similarity
was the almost exactly identical location of the inner and
outer marginal sinus of the haemal system in both specimens. However, some differences were discernable, for
example the distinct shapes of the ampullae and the thickness of the interpyramidal muscles, indicating that, ideally, several specimens of a given species should be
scanned. Similar comparative experiments were performed on a total of 18 echinoid species (data not
shown). In all cases, the overall internal architecture of
two specimens of a given species resembled each other
more closely than that of other species.
The next set of experiments served to assess the effects of
a gadolinium-based contrast agent (Magnevist, a standard
in clinical and pre-clinical MRI studies) on image quality.
Using the same specimen of P. miliaris and the same imaging protocol, we found that the application of the contrast
agent resulted in enhanced contrast, although some thinwalled structures, such as the ampullae or the oesophagus,
became less visible (Figure 1C and 1D). Another advantage of the use of this contrast agent was that some of the
artefacts caused by paramagnetic gut content were
reduced due to the stronger water signal. Therefore, most
specimens were scanned both before and after the application of the contrast agent (see Additional file 1 for
details).
The final set of experiments for establishing a standard set
of imaging conditions was designed to compare imaging

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/33

results obtained from freshly fixed and museum specimens of the same species. Prior to the present MRI studies,
several museum specimens from the wet collection of the
Systematische Zoologie am Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin, Germany (ZMB) were dissected in order to assess the
state of preservation after decades or even more than a
century of alcohol conservation (Strongylocentrotus dröbachiensis (Müller, 1776), Sphaerechinus granularis
(Lamarck, 1816), Schizaster lacunosus (Linnaeus, 1758),
and Brissopsis lyrifera (Forbes, 1841)). Their state of preservation was surprisingly good and seemed mainly to
depend on the mode of collection, the fixation mode, and
the subsequent preservation in alcohol. Following the dissections, MRI experiments using freshly fixed and
museum specimens of P. miliaris were carried out. Structures visible in the freshly fixed specimen (Figure 1E) were
recognizable also in the 135-year-old museum specimen
(Figure 1F). The size and location of the anatomical features varied slightly, but this had been observed among
different specimens of freshly fixed animals as well.
Despite these differences, the results confirmed our
assumption that museum material, even if more than a
hundred years old, can be used for systematic MRI studies.
Scanning of selected members of high-ranking echinoid
subtaxa
After an initial assessment of the suitability (that is, size,
state of preservation, and availability) of specimens in
natural history collections worldwide, MRI studies were
carried out using selected species of the 14 currently recognized echinoid subtaxa (orders). In three cases, freshly
fixed animals were employed for the analysis (see Additional file 2 for details).

The full datasets from two 'regular' sea urchins (Eucidaris
metularia (Lamarck, 1816) and P. miliaris) as well as two
irregular sea urchins (Echinoneus cyclostomus (Leske, 1778)
and Echinocyamus pusillus (Müller, 1776)) are presented
here as interactive videos (Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6; Figure
2 shows images of selected sections). The four image datasets range in spatial resolution from 20 × 18 × 18 μm3 to
(86 μm)3 and represent the current state-of-the-art in
high-field MRI at a field of view of up to (3.3 cm)3. In E.
metularia (Figure 2A) and P. miliaris (Figure 2B), the pentameric symmetry of echinoderms becomes easily visible
when looking at the five gonads or the lantern muscles
that form a five-tipped star. Moving down from the aboral
to the oral side, the following internal and external structures can be identified, amongst others (Additional files 3,
4, 5, 6): madreporic plate, gonads, spines, intestine, compass elevator muscles, Aristotle's lantern with corresponding muscles, and the stomach. Some parts of the gut of P.
miliaris were filled with paramagnetic sediment of
unknown composition (possibly iron or manganese resi-

dues) that caused artefacts by altering the homogeneity of
the magnetic field inside the MRI instrument.
In E. cyclostomus (Figure 2C) and E. pusillus (Figure 2D),
the secondarily developed bilateral symmetry found in
the Irregularia is obvious when looking at the gonads
(reduced to four). The digestive tract of E. cyclostomus is
characterized by a dominant gastric caecum, localized at
the beginning of the stomach, and a long rectum, leading
down to the anus which is situated at the oral side of the
animal. E. pusillus, in common with all members of the
Clypeasteroida, the so-called sand dollars, possesses a
modified Aristotle's lantern. Other structures that can be
identified in the irregular species include relatively small
spines, one dominant (E. pusillus) or two huge (E. cyclostomus) gut loops, filled with debris and detritus, and an
axial complex running straight down from the madreporic
plate to the adoral part of the oesophagus (E. cyclostomus). In addition to soft tissues, the delineation of calcareous structures caused by the signal-providing
surrounding fluids and tissues adds some information on
hard-part anatomy to the virtual sections as well.
Although several specimens of the echinoid taxon missing
in our study, the Echinothurioida (or leather urchins),
were found in museum collections, their shape prevented
successful soft tissue imaging. These sea urchins possess a
flexible calcite endoskeleton as well as specialized internal
muscles that contract when the animal is fixed, resulting
in a pancake-like shape of the organism. For a reliable
comparison of internal structures it would be necessary to
scan specimens prior to contraction of these powerful
muscles.
3D reconstruction of selected internal organs
The 3D reconstructions presented here are limited to the
major soft tissue structures identifiable in all datasets, if
present in the respective species (Figure 3C–E and 4C–E):
digestive tract, Stewart's organs, axial complex, siphon,
gonads, buccal sacs (or 'gills') and gastric caecum.

Two of the immediately recognizable features are size and
shape of the gonads. Both differ substantially between the
analyzed species and usually constitute a character set of
high intraspecific variability. This becomes evident from
the analysis of animals from a given species in distinct
developmental stages (data not shown). The specimen of
Stomopneustes variolaris (Lamarck, 1816) (Figure 3) shown
here was fixed before gonad maturation. In the case of the
highly branched gonads found in E. pusillus (Figure 4),
depicted here for the first time, the advantages offered by
the digitized reconstruction of morphological structures
become obvious: a 3D reconstruction of such complex
structures would be particularly demanding using traditional techniques. In contrast to the gonads, clearly dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/33

tinct shapes are revealed when the guts of 'regular' (Figure
3) and irregular (Figure 4) sea urchin specimens are compared. After the scanning process, a digital photograph
was taken of every specimen selected for this study (Figures 3B and 4B).
MRI also revealed a striking difference regarding the architecture of the gastric caecum. Except for the two clypeasteroid subtaxa Laganina and Scutellina, this structure can
be found in all irregular taxa (Figure 4C–E), located at the
beginning of the stomach. Its presence correlates with the
feeding habits of this group of sea urchins: most of these
animals are partially or completely covered by sediment
which they ingest to filter out organic material. Although
the precise function of the gastric caecum is still a matter
of discussion, it appears to have a major role in digestion
(see, for example, [38,39]). In specimens of comparable
size, substantial differences in its size and shape were
found (Figure 5). The highly reduced gastric caecum consisting of numerous smaller blindly ending sacs that can
be observed in Echinolampas depressa Gray, 1851 (Figure
5B) appears to be a common characteristic which sets the
Cassiduloida apart from other taxa (Figure 5A,C and 5D)
of the Irregularia. This is emphasized by the presence of a
similar, highly reduced gastric caecum in the cassiduloid
species Cassidulus caribearum Lamarck, 1801 (data not
shown; as described also by Gladfelter [40]) and Rhyncholampas pacificus Agassiz, 1863 (as shown in [41]). A
comprehensive description and comparative analysis of
sea urchin internal anatomy will be published elsewhere
(Ziegler et al., publication in preparation).
Interactive viewing of selected species in three dimensions
To illustrate the opportunities offered by digitized reconstructions, Figure 6A–C shows different views of the 3D
model of a member of the Cidaroida (or pencil urchins),
E. metularia. This widely distributed Indo-Pacific species
possesses a moderately thick calcite endoskeleton, large
primary and short secondary spines. Its internal organization is characterized by the presence of five bushy Stewart's organs, five stalked gonads and a short intestine. The
drawing presented in Figure 6D was made by Stewart [42]
from a closely related species, Cidaris cidaris (= Dorocidaris
papillata) (Linnaeus, 1758), where he depicts the newly
discovered organs that were later named after him. A comparison of his drawing with the digital model in Figure 6C
demonstrates that modern imaging protocols in combination with 3D capability may serve as a valuable substitute
for laborious and subjective traditional dissection and visualization techniques. The interactive 3D model of E. metularia (accessible through a click onto Figure 6 in the 3D
PDF version of this article: Additional file 7) permits,
apart from standard operations such as zoom and drag,
the selection of the numerous reconstructed structures.
These elements can individually be made transparent for

Discussion
Methodology
The initial phase of our study served to determine the
proper imaging conditions using high-field MRI instruments. In order to achieve resolutions below (100 μm)3,
we employed 7 T and 17.6 T small animal scanners. We
were able to obtain resolutions ranging from 20 × 18 × 18
μm3 to (86 μm)3 with specimens ranging from 5 mm to

3.4 cm in size. Therefore, in terms of resolution, our data
is comparable to results derived from manual dissection
techniques in combination with stereomicroscopic observation. Susceptibility artefacts were primarily seen in the
sediment-feeding irregular species, with the gut content
being the source of these artefacts (see, for example, Additional file 6, Echinocyamus pusillus (Müller, 1776)). What
sediment component is causing which type of artefact
needs to be determined in mineralogical studies on
freshly fixed specimens. The effects of the contrast agent
made it possible to reduce the negative effects of these
artefacts in some cases (Figure 1C and 1D), but a thorough investigation of the potential of selective and nonselective contrast agents [44] is essential for their future
application in invertebrate morphology. Other major
sources for artefacts were the tendency of spatangoid sea
urchins to accumulate ferric iron phosphate in the connective tissues of their digestive tracts [45], and the digestive tract diverticula of scutelline sand dollars known to
harbour magnetite [46]. However, the scanning of several
specimens of a given species and the matching of their
internal structures did in some cases help to overcome
these problems.
One of the big advantages of MRI techniques is the
extremely simple preparation of fixed specimens, being
limited to the watering of the specimens (possibly in the

presence of a contrast agent) and later putting them back
into alcohol for storage. No detrimental effects of this procedure were noted during our studies. Apart from morphological studies on fixed specimens, MRI can also be
used for in vivo analyses of invertebrates where, in contrast
to μCT techniques that are based on X-rays, the living
specimen is not harmed during the scanning process.
Extensive morphological or developmental studies can
thus be carried out, although anaesthetic substances may
have to be applied to reduce movement artefacts during
the long scanning times that are needed for high-resolution datasets and 3D reconstructions. Another very important advantage of non-invasive imaging techniques in
general is the fact that the digitally acquired image stacks
do not have to be manually aligned, as is the case with digital pictures from histological or electronmicroscopical
sections. Although these datasets can be used to generate
highly resolved digitized 3D models of invertebrates as
well (see, for example, [47,48]), these analyses are
extremely demanding in terms of specimen preparation,
slice alignment and 3D reconstruction. In comparison,
3D reconstruction of MRI data is simple and highly accurate, but the segmentation process carried out for the
present work is still subjective and our primary hypotheses regarding organ designation had to be evaluated
against the information available from classical histological literature. However, user-friendly semi-automatic seg-

mentation [49] as well as artefact and noise reduction [50]
algorithms have recently become available, and may further simplify the task of 3D reconstruction. The highly
demanding step of obtaining a completely automated segmentation and reconstruction of an entire animal would
be very desirable and appears technically feasible,
although it is not yet available for comparative morphological studies.
In spite of the many positive features, a number of negative aspects are currently inherent to morphological stud-

ies of small animals using MRI. The achievable resolution
is comparatively low, and results derived from the reconstruction of internal structures are currently comparable
only to manual dissection. Furthermore, an exact outline
of how future experiments on other invertebrate taxa
should be performed can only be partially derived from
our study, since imaging results of fixed specimens
depend on several factors, some of them still not fully
understood (for example, susceptibility artefacts or
changes to organ systems after fixation). Another drawback is the fact that only limited in vitro staining possibil-

substances (for example manganese) can be used for in
vivo staining [28]. A further disadvantage of MRI is that
specimens cannot currently be scanned in alcohol, since
this would require spectroscopic imaging techniques
resulting in much longer scanning times at the desirable
resolutions below (100 μm)3. In addition, in the case of
sea urchins, the 3D models generated (see, for example,
Figure 6) are practically useless for taxonomic purposes
since sea urchin taxonomy is currently based entirely on
hard parts. Resolutions well below (10 μm)3 would be
necessary to differentiate between the often miniscule
characters of the sea urchin skeleton. However, using μCT,
these datasets can potentially be gathered, as demonstrated by μCT scans of two sea urchin species, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Stimpson, 1857) [51] and Encope
michelini Agassiz, 1841 [52], presented on the Digital
Morphology Library (DigiMorph) website [53].
On the other hand, the access to MRI instruments does
not appear to be a limiting factor. There are currently
more than 1000 experimental small animal MRI instruments worldwide available for pre-clinical imaging. Since
all high-field MRI scanners consist of super-conducting
electromagnets, overnight and weekend scans as performed during this study would permit an optimal use of
this resource.
Internal morphology of sea urchins
Despite the existence of extensive fossil, morphological
and molecular datasets for this taxon, comparatively little
systematic knowledge has been gathered on the internal
anatomy of sea urchins. However, some authors have
greatly extended our knowledge about the internal anatomy of selected, readily available sea urchin species such
as Cidaris cidaris (Linnaeus, 1758) [54], Arbacia punctulata
(Lamarck, 1816) [55], Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck,
1816) [56,57], Echinus esculentus Linnaeus, 1758 [58],
Sphaerechinus granularis (Lamarck, 1816) [57,59], Spatangus purpureus Müller, 1776 [57] or Echinocardium cordatum
(Pennant, 1777) [38], not to mention the extensive works
of Alexander E Agassiz, Hubert L Clark and Theodor J
Mortensen. A common drawback of these studies is that a
given author rarely dissected and analysed several species
of a single taxon using one consistent method. Only in
very few cases have histological sections, dissected specimens and so on, been preserved. The conclusions drawn
from the original data can therefore not always be scrutinized.

Furthermore, the results were sometimes biased by prevailing morphological hypotheses. For example, recent
histological studies [60] as well as our findings (Figure 3)
indicate that the siphon, a canal bypassing the sea urchin
stomach that was believed not to be found in the Diade-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/33

matoida (see, for example, [61]), is indeed also present in
this group of animals. Distinct features of internal sea
urchin anatomy may extend to the sizes and shapes of
digestive tract, gonads, ampullae and muscles. A thorough
revision of internal structures in the light of recent technological advances will therefore almost certainly change
our view of facts that, for years, were taken for granted.
Scanning of sea urchins has so far been performed by us
on more than 50 species (Ziegler et al., publication in
preparation).
The feasibility of comparative morphological studies
using MRI is further exemplified by our description of the
highly variable shape and size of the gastric caecum found
in the Irregularia (Figure 5). Our findings were correlated
with the little information available on this structure; the
combined data led us to assume that a reduced gastric caecum consisting of several smaller blindly ending sacs
might constitute a soft tissue character common to all cassiduloid sea urchins. We therefore predict the presence of
a similarly shaped structure in all species of the Echinolampadidae and Cassidulidae. Furthermore, it would
be of interest to extend our analyses to members of the
Apatopygidae and Neolampadidae, the other two extant
families currently assigned to the Cassiduloida.
Although for some organs high intraspecific variability
was detected, in particular in the case of organs with a
development-dependent size and shape such as the
gonads (Figure 1E and 1F), shape and localization of
other organs (for example the digestive tract) did not differ significantly among specimens from a given echinoid
species, allowing comparison on various taxic levels (Figures 3 and 4). However, intraspecific variability of internal
organs can also be observed in other taxa, for example gastropods (sinistral freak) or humans (situs inversus viscerum). Therefore, like larval and hard-part morphology,
which are continuously updated [62,63], morphological
character sets derived from internal organs of sea urchins
will serve as a useful systematic reference for future studies.
Non-invasive imaging techniques other than MRI
A number of imaging techniques allow for non-invasive
morphological studies on whole specimens. However,
only a few of them are able to achieve resolutions that permit detailed morphological analyses in small animals.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), in combination with the autofluorescence of the crustacean or insect
cuticula, can be used for 3D reconstructions of minuscule
body parts or whole specimens [64-66]. The potential of
this promising technique must not be underestimated,
since the achievable resolutions permit taxonomic studies
(based, for example, on chaetotaxy) as well as large-scale
systematic morphological analyses. However, this proce-

BMC Biology 2008, 6:33

dure reveals internal structures only in rare cases and is
limited to tiny objects.
In contrast to CLSM, μCT has already become a standard
tool for detailed non-invasive studies of whole specimens,
especially in studies on fossils [67]. It is based on the analysis of a sample by means of X-rays and can primarily be
used to reveal hard tissue structures such as bone or calcite. Moreover, recent studies using more advanced techniques such as X-ray synchrotron microtomography and a
new setup called very-high-resolution X-ray computed
tomography have been employed to display soft tissues,
in vitro as well as in vivo [6,7,68-70] (see also the review by
Attwood [4]). Using μCT, isotropic resolutions of less
than (5 μm)3 have been achieved on whole specimens,
although, technically, resolutions in the nanometre scale
are within reach. However, whether these new μCT methods can compete with the ability of MRI to display soft tissue at high resolutions still needs to be evaluated. Our
own preliminary studies to generate images of internal
organs performed on several sea urchin museum specimens (Echinoneus cyclostomus Leske, 1778, Psammechinus
miliaris (Müller, 1771), Mespilia globulus (Linnaeus,
1758), and Moira atropos (Lamarck, 1816)) using a desktop high-resolution μCT scanner (Skyscan 1172, Skyscan,
Kontich, Belgium) at the Max-Planck-Institut für evolutionäre Anthropologie, Leipzig, Germany were not successful, although these μCT datasets can be used for the
reconstruction of hard tissue structures. 3D models based
on this data will be made available on the DigiMorph
website [53].
These results demonstrate that complementary imaging
techniques should ideally be used for comparative morphological analyses, an approach commonly referred to as
multimodality.

Conclusion
Our results extend the use of MRI in invertebrate morphology to a systematic approach using museum specimens of a major marine invertebrate taxon, the sea
urchins (Echinoidea). MRI can be employed for the rapid,
non-destructive and unbiased acquisition of digital morphological data, and the creation of interactive 3D models
accessible both within a publication and via the Web. The
revelation of the internal anatomy of echinoid museum
specimens at a resolution comparable with manual dissection extends our knowledge of soft tissue characters,
permitting phylogenetic inferences.

Methods
Specimen preparation
All specimens analyzed belong to the taxon Echinoidea
(sea urchins), one of the five subtaxa of the Echinodermata (marine spiny-skinned animals). The museum spec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/33

imens were mostly fixed in formalin and all were
conserved in alcohol, although in some cases the exact
mode of fixation could not be determined. For MR scanning, the museum specimens had to be lowered down to
distilled water in a gradual alcohol series. Specimens that
were obtained in living state were fixed in a 7% formaldehyde solution. For MR scanning, the freshly fixed specimens were kept in this solution. Results derived from
specimens scanned in alcohol and formalin did not
appear to differ significantly.
The specimens where placed either inside a custom-built
Plexiglas chamber (Berlin), inside a 50 ml Falcon tube
(Berlin), or inside NMR tubes with diameters between 5
and 20 mm (Würzburg), depending on the size of the
specimen. On some specimens spines had to be dressed
for tight fit inside the tubes. Magnevist(Bayer-Schering,
Berlin, Germany), a gadolinium-based non-selective contrast agent, was added at a final concentration of 2 mM.
This concentration had been employed successfully in
preliminary studies (results not shown). The addition of
the contrast agent to the museum specimens was discussed beforehand with the curators who judged the risk
to the specimens' integrity as negligible. Prior to scanning,
samples were degassed at 50 mbar. The freshly fixed specimens used in this study will be deposited as voucher
material at the ZMB. Museum specimens will be stored in
separate jars for potential later re-scanning. Table 2 lists
detailed information on every museum and freshly fixed
specimen used in this study.
Specimen scanning and photography
Berlin
Experiments were conducted at the Berlin NeuroImaging
Center, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany
on a 7 T Pharmascan 70/16 AS rodent scanner with a 1Hresonance frequency of 300 MHz (Bruker Biospin GmbH,
Ettlingen, Germany). The system consisted of a 160 mm
horizontal bore magnet, a shielded gradient set with an
inner diameter of 90 mm, and a maximum gradient
strength of 300 mT/m. A 1H-radio frequency linear transmit/receive birdcage resonator with an inner diameter of
38 mm was used for excitation and signal detection. The
images described here were acquired at around 18°C.
Data acquisition and image processing were carried out
with Paravision 4.0.
Würzburg
Experiments were conducted at the Physikalisches Institut, Würzburg, Germany at 17.6 T with a 1H-resonance frequency of 750 MHz on a Bruker Avance 750WB NMR
spectrometer (Bruker Biospin GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany). The system consisted of an 89 mm vertical bore
magnet, a shielded gradient set with an inner diameter of
40 mm, and a maximum gradient strength of 1 T/m. A 20

mm linear birdcage resonator and a 5 mm linear bird cage
resonator were used. The images described here were
acquired at around 18°C. Image processing was carried
out with Paravision 3.0.2 and involved zero filling to a
(512)3 matrix prior to Fourier transformation.
Scanning protocols employed a 3D gradient echo imaging
sequence (FLASH) with parameters depending on the
specimen size (see Additional file 2 for details). Almost all
scans resulted in datasets with isotropic spatial resolution.
The photos of museum and freshly fixed specimens were
made using a digital camera (Casio Exilim) with 7.2 Megapixels. The acquired images were processed using Adobe
Photoshop CS2 9.0.
3D visualization
3D image reconstruction and visualization were performed by converting the generated MRI data (DICOM
standard) into an 8-bit TIFF image sequence (ImageJ
1.38w) and by using 3D imaging software (amira 3.0.2,
Mercury Computer Systems, Berlin, Germany). Segmentation was carried out manually by using the brush tool in
the amira Image Segmentation Editor. In some cases structures on every other slice were labelled, with subsequent
'interpolation' of structures on intervening slices, followed by a check and correction of segmentation results if
necessary. Detection of borderlines and organ designations were performed based on literature, our own histological data and previously acquired MRI data [31,32].

Operations were carried out on a desktop PC (CPU: Intel
Core 2 Duo, 2.67 GHz; graphics card: NVIDIA GeForce
8600 GT; operating system: Windows XP; display:
WACOM Cintiq 21UX Pen Display). Image processing
was performed using Adobe Photoshop CS2 9.0 and
Adobe Illustrator CS2 12.0.1. The movies were produced
using the ImageJ 1.38w QuickTime export function. The
individual 3D structures were saved as Wavefront files and
imported into Adobe 3D Toolkit 8.1.0, where they were
reassembled and transformed into an interactive 3D PDF.
The 3D model was embedded into this publication using
the Adobe 3D Toolkit according to the procedures
described in [71].
