Abstract
Background: For millennia, the southern part of the Mesopotamia has been a wetland region generated by the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers before flowing into the Gulf. This area has been occupied by human communities since
ancient times and the present-day inhabitants, the Marsh Arabs, are considered the population with the strongest
link to ancient Sumerians. Popular tradition, however, considers the Marsh Arabs as a foreign group, of unknown
origin, which arrived in the marshlands when the rearing of water buffalo was introduced to the region.
Results: To shed some light on the paternal and maternal origin of this population, Y chromosome and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation was surveyed in 143 Marsh Arabs and in a large sample of Iraqi controls.
Analyses of the haplogroups and sub-haplogroups observed in the Marsh Arabs revealed a prevalent
autochthonous Middle Eastern component for both male and female gene pools, with weak South-West Asian and
African contributions, more evident in mtDNA. A higher male than female homogeneity is characteristic of the
Marsh Arab gene pool, likely due to a strong male genetic drift determined by socio-cultural factors (patrilocality,
polygamy, unequal male and female migration rates).
Conclusions: Evidence of genetic stratification ascribable to the Sumerian development was provided by the Ychromosome data where the J1-Page08 branch reveals a local expansion, almost contemporary with the Sumerian
City State period that characterized Southern Mesopotamia. On the other hand, a more ancient background shared
with Northern Mesopotamia is revealed by the less represented Y-chromosome lineage J1-M267*. Overall our
results indicate that the introduction of water buffalo breeding and rice farming, most likely from the Indian subcontinent, only marginally affected the gene pool of autochthonous people of the region. Furthermore, a prevalent
Middle Eastern ancestry of the modern population of the marshes of southern Iraq implies that if the Marsh Arabs
are descendants of the ancient Sumerians, also the Sumerians were most likely autochthonous and not of Indian
or South Asian ancestry.

Background
The Near East is well known for its important role in
human history, particularly as a theatre for great historical events that changed the face of the world during the
Neolithic period. The temperate climate and fertile soil
brought by the continuous flooding of the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers, made the Mesopotamian region ideal

for early revolutions in agriculture and farming. In particular, the southern part of Mesopotamia (the delta
between the two rivers in the present day southern Iraq)
has been historically known as the Garden of Eden (biblical name) or Sumer Land, the land of Abraham.
The Mesopotamian civilization originated around the
4th millennium BC in the low course of the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers. This alluvial territory, which emerged
progressively by soil sedimentation, attracted different
populations from the northern and eastern mountains
but, whereas traces of their culture are present in the

territory, as documented by the Ubaid-Eridu pottery,
nothing is available for their identification. Only two
groups of populations arrived later and in larger number
leaved historical records: Sumerian and Semitic groups.
The Sumerians, who spoke an isolated language not correlated to any linguistic family, are the most ancient
group living in the region for which we have historical
evidence. They occupied the delta between the two rivers in the southern part of the present Iraq, one of the
oldest inhabited wetland environments. The Semitic
groups were semi-nomadic people who spoke a Semitic
language and lived in the northern area of the Syro-Arabian desert breeding small animals. From here, they
reached Mesopotamia where they settled among the
pre-existing populations. The Semitic people, more
numerous in the north, and the Sumerians, more represented in the south, after having adsorbed the pre-existing populations, melted their cultures laying the basis of
the western civilization [1].
Mesopotamia Marshes

The Mesopotamian marshes are among the oldest and,
until twenty years ago, the largest wetland environments
in Southwest Asia, including three main areas (Figure
1): the northern Al-Hawizah, the southern Al-Hammar
and the so-called Central Marshes all rich in both natural resources and biodiversity [2,3]. However, during
the last decades of the past century, a systematic plan of
water diversion and draining drastically reduced the

extension of the Iraqi marshes, and by the year 2000
only the northern portion of Al-Hawizah (about 10% of
its original extension) remained as functioning marshland whereas the Central and Al-Hammar marshes were
completely destroyed. This ecological catastrophe constrained Marsh Arabs of the drained zones to leave their
niche: some of them moved to the dry land next to the
marshes and others went in diaspora. However, due to
the attachment to their lifestyle, Marsh Arabs have been
returned to their land as soon as the restoration of
marshes began (2003) [4].
The ancient inhabitants of the marsh areas were
Sumerians, who were the first to develop an urban civilization some 5,000 years ago. Although footprints of
their great civilization are still evident in prominent
archaeological sites lying on the edges of the marshes,
such as the ancient Sumerian cities of Lagash, Ur, Uruk,
Eridu and Larsa, the origin of Sumerians is still a matter
of debate [5]. With respect to this question, two main
scenarios have been proposed: according to the first, the
original Sumerians were a group of populations who
had migrated from “the Southeast” (India region) and
took the seashore route through Arabian Gulf before
settling down in the southern marshes of Iraq [6]. The
second hypothesis posits that the advancement of the
Sumerian civilization was the result of human migrations from the mountainous area of Northeastern Mesopotamia to the southern marshes of Iraq [7], with
ensuing assimilation of the previous populations.
Over time, the many historical and archaeological
expeditions that have been conducted in the marshes
have consistently reported numerous parallelisms
between the modern and ancient life styles of the marsh
people [8,9]. Details such as home architecture (particular arched reed buildings), food gathering (grazing water
buffalos, trapping birds and spearing fish, rice cultivation), and means of transportation (slender bitumencovered wooden boats, called “Tarada”) are documented
as still being practiced by the indigenous population
locally named “Ma’dan” or “Marsh Arabs” [10,11]. This
village life-style, which has remained unchanged for
seven millennia, suggests a possible link between the
present-day marsh inhabitants and ancient Sumerians.
However, popular tradition considers the Marsh Arabs
as a foreign group, of unknown origin, which arrived in
the marshlands when the rearing of water buffalo was
introduced to the region.
In order to shed some light on the origin of the
ancient and modern Mesopotamian marsh populations,
which remains ambiguous in spite of all the above mentioned theories, the genetic variation of a sample of
“Marsh Arabs” has been investigated both for the maternally transmitted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the
Male Specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY).

Methods

Marsh Arabs Iraqis

The sample

The sample consists of 143 healthy unrelated males,
mainly from the Al-Hawizah Marshes (the only not
drained South Iraqi marsh area[4] (Figure 1). For each
subject the “Marsh Arab” ancestry (at least for last four
generations) was ascertained by interview after having
obtained the informed consent. The collection (5-10 ml
of blood each, in EDTA) was carried out in different villages during a field expedition. DNA was extracted from
whole blood by using a standard phenol/chloroform
protocol. For comparison, a sample of 154 Iraqi subjects
representative of the general Iraqi population and therefore referred throughout the text as “Iraqi” was investigated for both mtDNA and Y-chromosome markers.
This sample, previously analysed at low resolution [12]
is mainly composed of Arabs, living along the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers. In addition, the distribution of the Ychromosome haplogroup (Hg) J1 sub-clades was also
investigated in four samples from Kuwait (N = 53),
Palestine (N = 15), Israeli Druze (N = 37) and Khuzestan (South West Iran, N = 47) as well as in more than
3,700 subjects from 39 populations, mainly from Europe
and the Mediterranean area but also from Africa and
Asia [13,14].
This research was approved by the Ethics Committee
for Clinical Experimentation at the University of Pavia
(Board minutes of October 5, 2010).

Y-chromosome haplogroup affiliation was determined
according to the most recently updated phylogeny
[15,16] by genotyping, in hierarchical order, 46 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (see the phylogeny in
Figure 2 of the Result section). The nomenclature was
according to the Y chromosome Consortium rules
[17-19].
Mutations were detected either as RFLPs or by
DHPLC of pertinent fragments amplified by PCR [Additional file 1]. When necessary, results were verified by
sequencing.
J1-M267 Y chromosomes were analysed for a panel of
eight Y-chromosome microsatellite loci (DYS19,
YCAIIa/b, DYS389I/II, DYS390, DYS391 and DYS392)
by using multiplex reactions according to the STR DNA
Internet Data Base [20] and fragment analysis by capillary electrophoresis on ABI PRISM ® 3100 Genetic

Haplogroups are labelled according to the Y Chromosome
Consortium [17,18] and the International Society of Genetic
Genealogy [16]. Differently from previously reported [19], the M365
mutation was observed in two J1-Page08 Y-chromosomes (Marsh
Arabs). In these two subjects, M365 was observed in association
with the new mutation L267.2 discovered while typing the M365
marker. It consists of an A to G transition at nucleotide position 159.
The markers P37, M253, M223 of haplogroup I, M81 and M293 of
haplogroups E, and M367, M368 and M369 of haplogroup J1 were
typed but not observed. A star (*) indicates a paragroup: a group of

(20 July 2011) [22].

Sequence analysis of the control region was performed
by using primers F15973 (5’- AACTCCACCATTAGCACCCA-3’) and R263 (5’-TGGCTGTGCAGACATTCAAT-3’) on amplicons obtained by using the primers
F15877 (5’-CAAATGGGCCTGTCCTTGTA-3’) and
R468 (5’-GGAGTGGGAGGGGAAAATAA-3’) [23]. All
the samples were sequenced starting from primer
F15973. Samples showing potential heteroplasmies or
ambiguities were also sequenced with primer R263.
Statistical analysis

Haplogroup diversity (H) was computed by using the
standard method of Nei [24]. Principal component (PC)
analysis was performed on haplogroup frequencies using
Excel software implemented by XLstat. The relative
amount of accumulated diversity, as a function of geography, was evaluated through the mean microsatellite
variance estimated on at least five individuals. Haplogroup frequency and variance maps were generated by
using Surfer software [25], following the Kriging procedure. Median-Joining (MJ) networks [26] were constructed by the Network 4.5.0.0 program [27]. MtDNA
and Y-chromosome networks were obtained by the MJ
method, with ε = 0 and weighting markers according to
their relative stability (Y-chromosome: microsatellite loci
were weighted proportionally to the inverse of the
repeat variance of each haplogroup. MtDNA: coding
region was weighted as four; control region as one - see
Additional file 2) and after having processed the data
with the reduced-median method. The age of microsatellite variation within haplogroups was evaluated
according to Zhivotovsky et al. [28] and Sengupta et al.
[29] and through the BATWING procedure (Bayesian
Analysis of Trees With Internal Node Generation) [30].
Batwing runs used a model assuming an initial constant
population size followed by expansion at time b with a
growth rate of a. Alfa and beta parameters were as in
Tofanelli et al. [31]. For both methods the effective
mutation rate and a generation time of 25 years [28]
were used.

Results
Y-chromosome variation

The screening of 45 SNPs, plus one identified in this
survey, in Marsh Arabs and Iraqis identified 28 haplogroups, 14 in the marsh sample and 22 in the control
Iraqis. Only eight haplogroups were shared by both
groups. Their phylogenetic relationships and frequencies
are shown in Figure 2. More than 90% of both Y-chromosome gene pools can be traced back to Western Eurasian components: the Middle Eastern Hg J-M304, the
Near Eastern Hgs G-M201, E-M78 and E-M123, while
the Eurasian Hgs I-M170 and R-M207 are scarce and
less common in the Marsh Arabs than in the control

sample. Contributions from eastern Asia, India and
Pakistan, represented by Hgs L-M76, Q-M378 and R2M124, are detected in the Marsh Arabs, but at a very
low frequency.
Haplogroup J accounts for 55.1% of the Iraqi sample
reaching 84.6% in the Marsh Arabs, one of the highest
frequencies reported so far. Unlike the Iraqi sample,
which displays a roughly equal proportion of J1-M267
(56.4%) and J2-M172 (43.6%), almost all Marsh Arab J
chromosomes (96%) belongs to the J1-M267 clade and,
in particular, to sub-Hg J1-Page08. Haplogroup E,
which characterizes 6.3% of Marsh Arabs and 13.6% of
Iraqis, is represented by E-M123 in both groups, and EM78 mainly in the Iraqis. Haplogroup R1 is present at
a significantly lower frequency in the Marsh Arabs than
in the Iraqi sample (2.8% vs 19.4%; P < 0.001), and is
present only as R1-L23. Conversely the Iraqis are distributed in all the three R1 sub-groups (R1-L23, R1M17 and R1-M412) found in this survey at frequencies
of 9.1%, 8.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Other haplogroups
encountered at low frequencies among the Marsh Arabs
are Q (2.8%), G (1.4%), L (0.7%) and R2 (1.4%).
MtDNA variation

A total of 233 haplotypes [Additional file 2] and 77 subhaplogroups (Table 1) have been identified in this survey. Only 26 of the observed sub-haplogroups are
shared between the two populations, and most of the
remaining are represented by singletons. According to
their known or supposed geographic/ethnic origin
[32-34], in addition to a strong West Eurasian component (77.8% and 84.1% in the Marsh Arabs and Iraqis,
respectively), it is possible to recognize contributions
from North/East and Sub-Saharan Africa and from East
and South Asia.
West Eurasian mtDNAs observed in this study are
approximately equally distributed into macro-Hgs R0,
KU, and JT, although with haplogroup and sub-haplogroup differences between the two Iraqi samples. In
the Marsh Arabs Hg J prevails (15.2%) followed by Hgs
H (12.4%), U (9.7%) and T (7.6%). Conversely, in the
control group, the most frequent is Hg H (17.0%) followed by Hgs U (14.8%), T (12.6%) and J (11.9%). Both
the less represented N1 and W haplogroups show
higher frequencies (marginally significant) in Marsh
Arabs. The most frequent macro-Hg R0 includes molecules R0a ((preHV)I), more represented among the
Marsh Arabs (6.9% vs 4.0%), HV, observed mainly as
HV*, but especially H mtDNAs. Although the majority
of the H mtDNAs (7.6% in Marsh Arabs vs 10.8% in Iraqis) did not fall into any of the tested sub-haplogroups,
a limited number of H subsets (H1, H5, H6, and H14)
have been observed. In particular, while H5 (3.4% vs
2.8%), H1 (0.7% vs 1.7%) and H14 (0.7% vs 1.1%) were

found in both groups, H6 was observed only in one subject of the control group.
Almost all the main U sub-haplogroups and the
nested K branch were found in the Iraqi sample, but
only a sub-set of them (K1, U3, U4, U5, in addition to
the South West Asian U7) were observed in the Marsh
Arabs. The nested Hg K, mainly K1, was observed at a
comparable frequency in both groups (6.2% in the
marshes vs 4.6%). The situation of macro-Hg JT is more
complex. Significant differences (P < 0.05) emerged in
the distribution of J1 and J2 sub-clades, with the latter
much more frequent in the marshes (6.2% vs 1.7%). By
contrast, Hg T displayed a lower frequency in the
marshes (7.6% vs 12.6%) due to a significant lower incidence of its T2 sub-clade (2.1% vs 6.9%, P < 0.05). On
the other hand, Hgs N1 (8.2%) and W (4.8%), were both
present in the marshes at a three-fold higher frequency
than in Iraqis. Haplogroup X was detected as X2 with a
frequency lower than 2% in both population samples.
African haplogroups are of North/East and subSaharan African origin and represent minor components
in both groups. The North/East African contribution is
mainly represented by Hg M1 which accounts for 2.8%
of Marsh Arabs and 1.2% of the Iraqi sample, the latter
displaying also 0.6% of Hg U6. The sub-Saharan African
component comprised Hgs L0, L1, L2 and L3 and
accounted for 4.9% in the marshes and 9.1% of the control sample. Out of the twelve African sub-haplogroups
identified in this survey, six in the marshes and seven in
the control sample, only one (L2a1) was shared between
the two Iraqi groups.
The Asian contribution was significantly higher (P <
0.01) in the Marsh Arabs than in the control sample
(11.8% vs 5.2%). It includes mtDNAs belonging to the
Southern Asian Hgs M (M*, M33, M37e) and R2 in
Marsh Arabs, and R5a and U2d in the control sample.
Haplogroup U7, frequent in Southwest Asia, was
observed in both groups. The East Asian haplogroup B4
was detected at a very low frequency in both Iraqi
groups.

PC analyses

In order to visualize the relationship linking Marsh
Arabs with other Iraqis and surrounding neighbours
[Additional files 3 and 4], principal component analyses
of Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplogroups were carried out and the two PCs are illustrated in Figure 3.
For the Y-chromosome, the first two components,
although accounting for only a quarter of the total variance, gather Marsh Arabs with almost all Arab populations and separate them along the first PC from western
Eurasians, along the second PC from the African groups
and by both components from South Asian populations.
When the PCA was based on mtDNA haplogroup frequencies, Marsh Arabs occupied, together with Iraqi
and Saudi Arabian populations, a position in the middle
of the plot among three distinct groupings: the first
included western Eurasian, the second embraced all the
South Asian groups while the third represented the
North Africa and South Arabian Peninsula peoples.
For both systems, the longitudinal separation operated
by the first PC is mainly due to the East-West decreasing frequency of East Asian haplogroups (see for example: Y-chromosome Hgs R2-M124, C-RPS4Y and HM69; mtDNA Hgs A, F, D and G) and the increasing
frequencies of the African haplogroups (see for example:
Y-chromosome Hgs A-M13, B-M60, E-M35; mtDNA
Hgs L1, L2 and L3) while the latitudinal separation
operated by the second PC is mainly ascribable to the
different distribution of haplogroups most frequent in
West Eurasian (Y-chromosome Hgs J-M172, M267 and
mtDNA Hgs H and U5), and the African-specific haplogroups (Y-chromosome Hgs A-M13, B-M60, E-M35
and mtDNA Hgs L0-3).
Network analyses

Y-STR diversity at eight informative loci [Additional
file 5] was used to evaluate the internal variation and
phylogenetic relationships of J1-M267 Marsh Arab
samples in comparison with neighbouring populations.

scarce structure, suggestive of a still heterogeneous
clade, the J1-Page08 network displays a star-like shape
centred around the most frequent haplotype of Marsh
Arabs, which is shared with the majority of the Middle
Eastern Arab groups. Signs of expansion were revealed

by both networks but, in particular by that of J1Page08 which, besides the central haplotype, includes
at least three one-step derivatives overrepresented by
Marsh Arab chromosomes. This expansion event of
haplogroup J1-Page08 has a minor impact on the Iraqi
control sample and the other Middle Eastern Arab
populations.

groups or other populations, for instance those of the
Indian sub-continent. Thus, in order to shed some light
on this question Marsh Arab population was investigated for mtDNA and Y chromosome markers. Due to
their characteristics (uniparental transmission and
absence of recombination) and their wide datasets, they
are, at present, among the best genetic systems for
detecting signs of ancient migration events and to evaluate socio-cultural behaviours [35,36].

Figure 5 illustrates the network of the control-region
mtDNA haplotypes associated with each haplogroup
found in this survey [Additional file 2]. The majority of
haplogroups were present in both population samples
although with scarce sub-haplogroup and haplotype
overlapping. In addition, differently from the control
sample, a number of Marsh Arab haplotypes were
shared between two or more subjects.

Discussion
Two hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of
Marsh Arabs: (i) they could be aboriginal inhabitants of
Mesopotamia, correlated to the old Sumerians; (ii) they
could be foreign people of unknown origin. Although
the origin of Sumerians has yet to be clarified [5], the
two main scenarios, autochthonous vs foreign ancestry,
may have produced different genetic outcomes with
Marsh Arabs being genetically closer to Middle Eastern

Evidence of a Middle Eastern origin of the Marsh Iraqi
Arabs comes mainly from the Y chromosome

Although different Western European mtDNA haplogroups were present in the Middle East in Palaeolithic
times, they cannot always be interpreted as markers of
Middle Eastern origin. For example, even if the mtDNA
haplogroup H evolved in the Middle East ~18,00015,000 years ago [34], different H sub-groups observed

in this region, albeit at a rather low frequency, such as
H1, arose outside and are most likely the result of gene
flow from Europe [34,37].
Y-chromosome variation, like that of mtDNA, is
highly geographically structured [34,38,39]. However,
Middle Eastern haplogroup J, which accounts for the
great majority of paternal lineages of this region and
marks different migration events toward Europe, Africa
and Asia, does not display, at present, evidence of back
migrations.
A common ancestral origin of Marsh Arabs and Southern
Arabian peoples

Haplogroup J, with its two branches J1-M267 and J2M172, is a Y-chromosome lineage dating to about 30,000
years ago. Its place of origin is still under discussion, but
it is considered a landmark geographically linked to the
Near Eastern region where the agricultural revolution

Page 10 of 15

and animal domestication appeared for the first time
[34]. Accordingly, the frequency distribution of Hg J
[13,40] shows radial decreasing clines toward the Levant
area, Central Asia, the Caucasus, North Africa, and Europe from focal points of high frequency in the Near East
[12,40,41]. Although both clades (J1-M267 and J2-M172)
evolved in situ and participated in the Neolithic revolution, their different geographic distributions suggest two
distinct histories. While J2-M172 has been linked to the
development and expansion of agriculture in the wetter
northern zone and is also considered the Y-chromosome
marker for the spread of farming into South East Europe,
J1-M267 has been associated with pastoralism in the
semi-arid area of the Arabian Peninsula [42,43]. Despite
this purported initial association, no evidence of pastoralism has been reported in the marsh area where one of
the J1-M267 highest values (81.1%) has been observed
(Additional file 6, Figure 6).

Recent expansions shape the present Marsh Arab Ychromosome landscape

When the two J1-M267 sub-clades, J1-M267* and J1Page08 are considered (Figure 6), differential frequency
trends emerge. The less represented J1-M267* primarily
diffuses towards North East Mesopotamia and shows its
highest incidence in the Assyrians of northern Iraq, and
Turkey. By contrast, J1-Page08 accounts for the great
majority of the J1 distribution in South Western Mesopotamia, reaching its highest value (74.1%) in the marsh
area. By considering the STR haplotypes associated with
the two branches, the highest values of variance are
localized in northern Mesopotamia (North Iraq/South
East Turkey) (Figure 6, Additional files 7, 8 and 9). For
the J1-Page08 lineage, high variance values were also
observed in Ethiopia, Oman and South Eastern Italy
(Table 2). Although present data are not adequate to

define the homeland of the J1-Page08 sub-clade, some
useful information can be obtained from the haplotype
network analysis (Figure 4). Thus, the pheripheric position of the Ethiopian and South Eastern Italian (European) haplotypes suggests that the high values of
variance registered in these regions likely reflect the
stratification of different migratory events, some of
which occurred before the expansion and diffusion of
the lineage outside the Middle Eastern area. As previously reported [31,41], also the value of variance in
the Omani is affected by the concomitant presence of
both pheripheric and centrally expanded haplotypes. In
this context, the low variance (0.118) observed in the
Marsh Arabs underlines a recent expansion involving
few haplotypes, all of which occupying a central position
in the J1-Page08 network (Figure 4). In the less frequent
J1-M267* clade, only marginally affected by events of

expansion, Marsh Arabs shared haplotypes with other
Iraqi and Assyrian samples, supporting a common local
background (Figure 4).
Minor genetic influences in Marsh Arabs

Only a small proportion of the Marsh Arab gene pool
derives from gene flow from neighbouring regions. On
the paternal side, our phylogeographic data highlight
some southwest Asian specific contributions as testified
to by Hgs Q, L and R2, known as South Asian Y-chromosome lineages, primarily observed in India and Pakistan [29,44-47]. Different from the Iraqi control sample,
the Marsh Arab gene pool displays a very scarce input
from the northern Middle East (Hgs J2-M172 and derivatives, G-M201 and E-M123), virtually lacks western
Eurasian (Hgs R1-M17, R1-M412 and R1-L23) and subSaharan African (Hg E-M2) contributions. On the other
hand, the absence in both Iraqi groups of the North
African E-M81 branch [13,48-50], speaks against substantial patrilineal gene flow from this region.
On the maternal side, a significant (East/Southwest)
Asian component (11.8%) is present among Marsh Arabs
as testified to by Hgs B4, M, R2 and U7. The B4 mtDNAs
carry control-region motifs observed in Iran, Kirghizstan,
Western Siberia, Vietnam, Korea [51-53] attesting to
contact with Central and East Asia. This observation is
likely due to recent gene flow, although it is worth noting
that the ancient Silk Road passed through the Iraqi
region from Basra to Baghdad. On the other hand, the
majority of M, R2 and U7 mtDNAs display controlregion motifs observed in South West Asian and in particular in India [47,54-57]. Additional evidence of the multiple relationships with South West Asia derives from the
presence of one M33 mtDNA, which was completely
sequenced, (GenBank accession number: JN540042).
This mtDNA belongs to the M33a2a clade and clusters
with three sequences, from Uttar Pradesh, Saudi Arabia
[58] and Egypt [47], respectively. On the other hand, the
presence in Iraq of Hgs M1 (in both Iraqi groups) and
U6 (in the control sample) of North/East African origin
[59] is indicative of some limited gene flow from that
area. The sub-Saharan contribution is instead represented by haplogroups L0, L1, L2 and L3. It reaches
values (~8%) in line with those reported for other Middle
Eastern Arab populations [60,61].
Gender differences in the Marsh Arab gene pool

In comparison with the control sample, representative of
the general Iraqi population, Marsh Arabs are characterized by an important lower Y-chromosome heterogeneity
(HY = 0.461 vs 0.887) whereas similar values of heterogeneity were observed for mtDNA (H mtDNA = 0.963 vs
0.957). This is due to the presence of one prevalent Ychromosome haplogroup, the J1-M267, which alone

Page 12 of 15

characterizes more than 80% of the Marsh Y-chromosome
gene pool. Although patterns of lower male than female
heterogeneity have been reported in many populations
and usually ascribed to patrilocal residence [62-64], such a
scenario can explain only part of the large difference
observed in the geographically isolated marsh population.
Among the different factors (e.g. polygamy, unequal male
and female migration rates and selective processes) that
can differently affect the extent of mtDNA and Y-chromosome heterogeneity, nonrandom-mating practices, common in the area, in association with cultural beliefs that
support polygamy, may have contributed to cause the difference observed in the Marsh Arabs.

Conclusions
The analyses carried out on the mtDNA and Y chromosome of the Iraqi Marsh Arabs, a population living in
the Tigris-Euphrates marshlands, have shown: (i) a prevalent autochthonous Middle Eastern component both
in male and female gene pools; (ii) weak South-West
Asian and African heritages, more evident for mtDNA;
(iii) a higher male than female homogeneity, mainly
determined by the co-occurrence of socio-cultural and
genetic factors; (iv) a genetic stratification not only
ascribable to recent events. The last point is well illustrated by Y-chromosome data where the less represented J1-M267* lineage indicates Northern
Mesopotamia contributions, whereas the most frequent
J1-Page08 branch reveals a local recent expansion about
4,000 years ago (Table 2). Although the Y-chromosome
age estimates deserve caution, particularly when samples
are small and standard errors large, it is interesting to
note that these estimates overlap the City State period
which characterised Southern Mesopotamia, and is testified to by numerous ancient Sumerian cities (Lagash,
Ur, Uruk, Eridu and Larsa).
In conclusion, our data show that the modern Marsh
Arabs of Iraq harbour mtDNAs and Y chromosomes
that are predominantly of Middle Eastern origin. Therefore, certain cultural features of the area such as water
buffalo breeding and rice farming, which were most
likely introduced from the Indian sub-continent, only
marginally affected the gene pool of the autochthonous
people of the region. Moreover, a Middle Eastern ancestral origin of the modern population of the marshes of
southern Iraq implies that, if the Marsh Arabs are descendants of the ancient Sumerians, also Sumerians were
not of Indian or Southern Asian ancestry.
