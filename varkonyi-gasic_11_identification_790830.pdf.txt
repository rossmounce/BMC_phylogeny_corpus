Abstract
Background: Flower development in kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) is initiated in the first growing season, when
undifferentiated primordia are established in latent shoot buds. These primordia can differentiate into flowers in
the second growing season, after the winter dormancy period and upon accumulation of adequate winter chilling.
Kiwifruit is an important horticultural crop, yet little is known about the molecular regulation of flower
development.
Results: To study kiwifruit flower development, nine MADS-box genes were identified and functionally
characterized. Protein sequence alignment, phenotypes obtained upon overexpression in Arabidopsis and
expression patterns suggest that the identified genes are required for floral meristem and floral organ specification.
Their role during budbreak and flower development was studied. A spontaneous kiwifruit mutant was utilized to
correlate the extended expression domains of these flowering genes with abnormal floral development.
Conclusions: This study provides a description of flower development in kiwifruit at the molecular level. It has
identified markers for flower development, and candidates for manipulation of kiwifruit growth, phase change and
time of flowering. The expression in normal and aberrant flowers provided a model for kiwifruit flower
development.

Background
Over the past decades, kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) has
developed into an important horticultural crop. The
genus Actinidia belongs to the family Actinidiaceae
within the Ericales order, contains 76 species originating
mainly in China [1] and consists of perennial, climbing
or straggling, deciduous plants. All members of Actinidia genus are functionally dioecious, with male and
female flowers carried on different plants, typically at
the basal end of the shoot [2]. Female flowers undergo
androecial development but lack functional pollen and
male flowers cease gynoecial development upon initiation of stigma. The reproductive cycles of kiwifruit commence after a juvenile period required for establishment
of flowering competence. In mature kiwifruit plants,

growth and flowering are spread over two growing seasons. During the first growing season, a number of phytomers and axillary meristems are initiated in latent
shoot buds at the distal end of the shoot, which enter a
dormant state and develop into inflorescence-bearing
shoots early in the second growing season, at spring
budbreak [3-7]. Kiwifruit inflorescences are compound
dichasia, but lateral flowers in most female cultivars
cease development soon after their initiation and only
terminal flowers develop [8].
Conflicting reports are available on the timing of floral
commitment, ranging from the spring of the first growing season [4,5,9] or late summer of the first growing
season [10], to the spring of the second growing season,
immediately before flower differentiation [11]. In addition, flower development during the second growing
season depends on environmental conditions, most
importantly winter chilling; insufficient chilling results
in unsynchronized budbreak, low flower numbers and

subsequent low fruit yields. Actinidia species differ significantly in their timing of budbreak, winter-chilling
requirements, lengths and numbers of nodes per shoot,
indicating a genetic control of shoot growth and
flowering.
Current research on kiwifruit is mainly focused
around consumer-driven traits such as fruit flavour and
fragrance, appearance, healthful components and convenience [12], but the knowledge of the genetic regulation
of growth and development, flowering and sex-determination is very scarce, yet essential to accelerate breeding
and aid our understanding of flowering control in kiwifruit and woody perennial species in general.
Molecular and genetic regulation of flower development has been subject to detailed analysis in various
plant species. Specification of floral organ identity in
model plants Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum has been
explained by the classical ABC model [13,14]. Identity of
floral organs is determined by three classes of function,
A, B and C, each consisting of one or more genes
[15-27]. Further research resulted in the revised ABC(D)
E model [28-34]. In addition, the A class gene APETALA1 (AP1), together with other members of the AP1/
FUL-like gene family and SEP gene family, have a role
in specification of floral meristem identity [35,36];
another A class gene APETALA2 (AP2) is also implicated in the control of floral transition [25], seed size
[37] and maintenance of the stem cell niche in the
shoot meristem [38]. With the exception of AP2, all the
floral organ identity genes are members of the MADSbox family [reviewed in 39]. They all belong to the
plant-specific MIKC type MADS-box genes [40], orthologs from different plant species generally belong to the
same MADS-box gene subfamilies [41-50] and their
function is well correlated with expression patterns [51].
In general, the ABC and ABCE models are widely
applicable to non-model plants, with a few caveats.
Whereas the B, C and E functions are regarded to be
broadly conserved, the A function in specification of the
perianth is not widely observed and questioned in Antirrhinum [52,53], as well as other plants [54]. In addition,
this model fails to explain floral diversity seen within
flowering plants, and additional models have been proposed [55-57]. Evolutionary developmental biology of
MADS box genes in a range of angiosperms has been
instrumental in the development and testing of these
models [reviewed in 58] and further broad comparative
studies, including normal and aberrant flowers in a
range of species, will aid understanding of the mechanisms underlying the variation in angiosperm floral
morphology.
The objective of this study was to functionally characterize genes required for development of kiwifruit flowers. Specifically, this study aimed to: (i) identify genes

Page 2 of 15

that specify floral meristem and floral organ fates in
kiwifruit; (ii) identify if specific expression patterns may
have led to the aberrant morphology of some kiwifruit
flowers; and (iii) develop molecular markers to monitor
kiwifruit floral development. Nine MADS-box genes
highly similar to class A, B, C, and E function genes
were identified and further characterized using cultivars
of the closely related kiwifruit species, A. chinensis and
A. deliciosa and an A. deliciosa spontaneous mutant
‘Pukekohe dwarf’ with an abnormal floral phenotype.
We discuss kiwifruit flower development in the light of
the existing flowering models.

Results
Identification of kiwifruit candidate genes

Nine non-redundant kiwifruit MADS-box genes were
identified on the basis of similarity to Arabidopsis floral
MADS-box genes, and named Actinidia FUL-like, FUL,
AP3-1, AP3-2, PI, AG, SEP1, SEP3 and SEP4 (Table 1).
For some genes, multiple near-identical sequences were
recovered reflecting alleles, sequences from different
genomes within polyploid genomes or orthologs from
different kiwifruit species (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that the identified floral MADS-box genes belong to appropriate
MADS-box gene families and subfamilies (Figure 1). All
the predicted protein sequences of kiwifruit MADS-box
genes contain the conserved MIK domains and a variable C-terminal region with conserved C-terminal motifs
(Table 2). None of the identified MADS-box genes has
the carboxyl-terminal CFAT/A farnesylation motif characteristic of euAP1 proteins. The predicted AG protein
was clustered in the C lineage of the angiosperm AG
subfamily (Figure 1), but the C and the D lineages are
closely related and often difficult to distinguish. PCR
amplification of the genomic DNA identified an intron
located in the last codon (Additional file 1), which is
characteristic of the C but not the D lineage [59].
Overexrpession phenotypes of kiwifruit flowering genes

To establish the potential role of identified genes in regulation of flowering, their cDNAs were ectopically
expressed in wild type Arabidopsis. Among the minimum of 10 kanamycin-resistant lines per each construct,
three or more were chosen for detailed analysis. In general, two of the chosen lines displayed strong phenotypes and one line was chosen that displayed a weak to
moderate phenotype (Table 3; Figure 2A).
Kiwifruit FUL-like, when over-expressed in Arabidopsis Col-1 under the 35S promoter, promoted floral transition both in inductive long-day (LD) conditions and in
non-inductive short-day (SD) conditions (Table 3;
Figure 2B). High levels of transgene expression resulted
in the terminal flower phenotype (Figure 2C). No

homeotic transformation of floral whorls was detected
in transgenic plants.
Kiwifruit FUL, when over-expressed in Arabidopsis
Col-1 under the 35S promoter, promoted flowering but
less efficiently than FUL-like and the flowers were indistinguishable from the wild type (Figure 2D). The ability
of this construct to induce precocious flowering was
dependent on day length conditions (Table 3). Constitutive over-expression of kiwifruit SEP4 also promoted
floral transition (Table 3; Figure 2E-F). In addition,
many of the plants had small and curled leaves (Figure
2F). Plants grown in short days often reverted to vegetative growth, producing aerial rosettes (data not shown).
Constitutive overexpression of kiwifruit SEP3 had only a
mild effect on the timing of floral transition in inductive
LD conditions (data not shown). Ectopic expression of
kiwifruit PI and AP3-1 produced plants indistinguishable
from the wild type (data not shown). Constitutive overexpression of kiwifruit AG resulted in plants with
reduced height and curled leaves, which flowered significantly earlier than the wild type in non-inductive SD
conditions (Figure 2G). These plants displayed loss of
inflorescence indeterminacy and homeotic modifications
that resembled the phenotype of transgenic plants ectopically expressing Arabidopsis AG [60].
To confirm that the identified kiwifruit genes encode
proteins capable of forming complexes between each
other as predicted for floral MADS-box genes [28,32], a
yeast-two hybrid analysis was performed. It established
interactions between B class proteins AP3-1 and PI, as
well as FUL and SEP4; weaker interactions were
detected between AG and SEP4 and SEP3 and SEP4. No
interactions were identified with FUL-like and SEP1
(Figure 2H).
Expression patterns in vegetative and reproductive
organs

MADS-box gene functions are well correlated with the
expression patterns in a variety of plant species. To
establish the role of identified genes in kiwifruit, their

expression patterns in various vegetative and reproductive organs was interrogated by reverse transcription
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), using two closely related
kiwifruit species, a diploid A. chinensis and a hexaploid
A. deliciosa, which exhibit differences in fruit characteristics, vine morphology, timing of budbreak and requirement for winter chilling. With the exception of FUL-like
and FUL, expression of kiwifruit flowering genes was
confined to flower and fruit tissues of both species chosen for analysis. Kiwifruit AP3-1, AG, SEP1, SEP3 and
SEP4 were detected both in the flower and fruit tissue
and PI was detected exclusively in flowers. Kiwifruit
FUL-like was detected in leaf and flower tissues and was
relatively highly expressed in the root. FUL was not
detected in the root, but was detectable in vegetative
shoot organs (stem and leaf) and was highly expressed
in flower and particularly fruit. In general, the expression levels were relatively high compared with those of
kiwifruit ACTIN, with the exception of FUL-like and AG
(Figure 3).
Expression domains in normal and aberrant flowers

To further investigate the role of identified genes in specification of floral organ fate in kiwifruit, floral organs of
normal and aberrant A. deliciosa flowers were analysed
by RT-qPCR. A. deliciosa pistillate (female) flowers consist of well separated whorls, with 5-6 ovate-oblong
brown sepals, 5-6 convolute white petals (Figure 4A),
stamens that appear fully developed and a sub-globose,
hairy ovary with numerous styles and ovules (Figure
4B). The pedicel carries two small lateral bracts (Figure
4A) that arise at very early stages of inflorescence development [61]. In some cases, lateral flowers can initiate
and develop in the axils of these bracts. The staminate
(male) flower is similar except for the stamens with
longer filaments and larger anthers and underdeveloped
ovary, which lacks styles and ovules (Figure 4C, D).
In a A. deliciosa mutant ‘Pukekohe dwarf’, which bares
staminate but sterile flowers, floral organs are characterized by a transition from bracts to outer and inner

perianth and underdeveloped reproductive whorls. Most
severely affected flowers have multiple, spirally arranged
bract and perianth whorls (Figure 4E), including intermediate floral organs (bract-like sepals, sepaloid petals).
No reproductive organs are apparent and a new indeterminate flower is initiated instead (Figure 4F). Moderately affected flowers consist of better separated whorls,
including bracts, sepals, petals, underdeveloped stamens
and filamentous pistils (Figure 4G, H), as well as intermediate organs between each whorl, such as sepaloid
outer petals (Figure 4I) and anther structures fused to
the upper part of inner petals (Figure 4J). Because of the
lack of sharp boundaries between ‘Pukekohe dwarf’
floral organs, the samples collected were bracts, sepals,
sepaloid petals, petals, stamens with petaloid characteristics and the pistil-like structure (Figure 4K). Leaf tissue
was also included in the analysis.
The expression patterns are presented in Figure 5. In
normal flowers, FUL-like was expressed to high level in
sepals, and moderate level in the leaf tissue. Low levels
of expression were detected in other flower organs. FUL
transcript accumulated in all tissues, but the highest
accumulation was detected in the pistil tissue. AP3-1
was expressed in all floral organs, with higher accumulation detected in petal and stamen tissues, and PI was
exclusively expressed in petals and stamens. AG accumulated in the reproductive flower organs, stamen and
pistil. SEP1 and SEP3 were detected in all floral organs
and SEP4 accumulated in sepals and pistils, with low
levels of transcript detected in stamens and almost no
transcript detected in petals. No major differences were
apparent between male and female flowers, with the
exception of female stamen tissue that accumulated
higher levels of AP3-1, PI, AG and SEP1 than those
detected in male stamen tissues. Similar expression
domains of kiwifruit flowering genes were detected in A.
chinensis flowers (data not shown).
In aberrant ‘Pukekohe dwarf’ flowers, the accumulation of kiwifruit flowering transcripts was similar to that

in normal flowers, with some exceptions. FUL-like transcript was particularly abundant in bracts. FUL also
accumulated in bracts to similar levels to those detected
in leaves, sepals and stamens, but lower than pistil. PI
expression domain extended across all flower organs,
while being restricted to petals and stamens in normal
flowers. AG expression was mainly confined to stamen
and pistil tissue, with relative accumulation between
that detected in male and female normal flowers. SEP1
and SEP3 accumulated from sepals to pistils but were
absent from the leaf and bract tissue. On the other
hand, SEP4 accumulated in the bract tissue and was also
abundant in aberrant flower pistils.
Expressions in kiwifruit emerging shoots

Expression of kiwifruit floral genes was further analysed in emerging shoots to address their role during
budbreak and early stages of inflorescence and flower
development. The timing and anatomical and morphological changes during shoot development are well
described [4,8,61,62] and the collected samples

(Figure 6A) represented developmental stages as
described using light and scanning electron microscopy by Polito and Grant [61]. Kiwifruit FUL-like,
FUL and SEP4 transcripts accumulated rapidly at the
time of emergence of pubescent bud scales (Figure
6B), a stage corresponding to early inflorescence
development, when axillary meristem elongates and
lateral bracts are initiated [61]. An increasing accumulation of PI and AG were detected from the bud
scale emergence and leaf emergence stage, respectively (Figure 6B), during rapid sequential floral organ
development [61]. The accumulation of PI and AG
was confined to the basal part of the emerging shoot
where floral differentiation takes place, and was not
detected in the vegetative shoot tip (Figure 6C-E).
The timing of FUL-like and FUL accumulation in the
field-grown plants corresponded with initial stages of
bud outgrowth in A. chinensis and A. deliciosa (Figure
6F) and was similar to the accumulation pattern of a
cell cycle gene CDKB1, used as a marker of cell divisions [63].

Discussion
Kiwifruit flowering genes specify floral meristem and
floral organ fates

A kiwifruit flower belongs to the regular eudicot flower
type in which the floral organ identity is determined by
expression and interaction of floral organ identity genes.
Thus, a candidate gene approach was chosen for

molecular analysis of kiwifruit flowering. Putative orthologs of genes controlling flower development were isolated and characterized from the EST collection
comprising transcripts from a variety of tissues of several Actinidia species, including flower, developing buds
and fruit [12]. The EST collection is biased towards fruit
transcripts and many of the ESTs for floral organ

identity were identified in fruit libraries: kiwifruit FUL,
AP3, AG, SEP1, SEP3 and SEP4 were all represented
with at least one sequence in a library derived from fruit
transcripts (Table 1). All these genes have been confirmed as expressed in the fruit, in addition to the
flower. FUL-like was identified from the leaf library and
the presence of only one sequence correlated with its
low expression levels as compared to ACTIN. Phylogenetic analysis and phenotypes obtained upon ectopic
expression in Arabidopsis suggested evolutionary and
functional conservation of kiwifruit flowering genes.
These data taken together with expression patterns in
normal and aberrant kiwifruit flowers confirmed that
the identified B-, C- and E-class genes have a role in
specification of kiwifruit floral organs. The floral promotion obtained upon overexpression in Arabidopsis, elevated expression in ‘Pukekohe dwarf’ bracts and
accumulation at the earliest stages of bud development
strongly suggested a role for kiwifruit FUL-like, FUL and
SEP4 in floral meristem specification. The mechanism of
kiwifruit FUL-like and FUL action is unknown, but
might be related to promotion or maintenance of

cellular expansion and differentiation, as reported for
FUL in Arabidopsis [64]. Expression in vegetative tissues
would support the role for FUL-like and FUL genes in
general cellular function. While kiwifruit SEP4 might
perform a similar general function, it marks the inflorescence, flower and fruit development, based on the transcript absence from vegetative tissues. The increasing
accumulation during shoot emergence and expression
confined to reproductive organs suggested PI and AG as
markers of flower differentiation.
Is there an AP1-like gene in kiwifruit?

It is unclear if an AP1 orthologous gene exists in the
kiwifruit genome. None of the candidate genes mined
from the EST database or described previously [5] contained the carboxyl-terminal CFAT/A farnesylation
motif characteristic of euAP1 proteins [65]. It is therefore possible that an unidentified kiwifruit euAP1 protein is required for sepal and petal identity. On the
other hand, the role of euAP1 genes in specification of
sepal and petal identity in plants other than Arabidopsis
is unclear and the concept of the A function in flower

organ identity may not be universal [52,53]. In general,
the role of A function genes in organ identity might
simply be the result of their meristem identity function
and the mutant floral organ phenotypes could be
explained by incomplete transition to a floral meristem
[54]. In addition, the numerous duplication events that
gave rise to the angiosperm AP1/FUL-like gene family
[44,66-68] make it difficult to identify the true orthologs
across plant taxa. FUL genes also perform the floral
meristem identity function [36,69-71] and possibly the
A function [72-74], and the AP1 conserved motif and

protein modification may not be necessary [75]. A possibility exists that kiwifruit FUL-like may have a role in
sepal specification, based on its expression pattern in
flowers. However, expression of FUL-like failed to rescue
the ap1-1 organ identity phenotype (data not shown)
and a yeast-two-hybrid assay failed to identify an interaction between FUL-like and any of the kiwifruit SEP
proteins, that would have been predicted from the quartet model [28,32]. Taken together with expression in
vegetative kiwifruit organs, these data suggest against
the A function of kiwifruit FUL-like.

A. deliciosa ’Pukekohe dwarf’ mutant - a tool to study
kiwifruit flower development

Functional characterization of a gene typically includes
analysis of phenotypes resulting from a mutation or
ectopic expression of the gene. In kiwifruit, artificially
generated mutations are difficult to generate and screen
and genetic transformation is a difficult and lengthy
process. However, natural genetic variants exist with
altered floral development and morphology that can be
utilized as a genetic tool to identify and characterize
genes involved in flowering. A. deliciosa ’Pukekohe
dwarf’ flower is characterized by numerous bracts preceding sepals. Given the position on the pedicel, spiral
phyllotaxis and morphology significantly different from
that of both leaves and sepals, bracts can be seen as
modified leaves produced during the early stages of the
floral transition, that arise as a result of increasing activity of floral-promoting genes. Thus, the significant upregulation of kiwifruit FUL-like, FUL and SEP4 in bracts
further suggests their role in establishment of floral fate,
consistent with floral promotion seen upon expression
of these genes in Arabidopsis. The other unusual feature
of ‘Pukekohe dwarf’ flowers is the presence of multiple
perianth whorls with gradual transition between floral
organs and the presence of intermediate organs with
combined sepal and petal or petal and anther identity.
Accordingly, kiwifruit PI expression domain in ‘Pukekohe dwarf’ is extended and resembles the ‘fading border’ model of floral gene expression [57].
The molecular mechanisms involved in the generation
of the mutation and the target genes affected in ‘Pukekohe dwarf’ are unknown. ‘Pukekohe dwarf’ is impaired
in the specification of stamen/anther and pistil/carpel
identity, but not in development of perianth organs,
resembling the loss-of-function mutation in class C gene
AG [13,22]. However, no major differences were detected
in the expression pattern or sequence of kiwifruit AG
between normal and aberrant flowers (Additional file 2),
suggesting that a different mechanism might underlie the
‘Pukekohe dwarf’ phenotype. Given that the mutation
likely occurs in one copy of the target gene, it is highly
probable that the phenotype is the result of a gain-offunction rather than loss-of-function mutation.
A model for kiwifruit floral organ identity

Based on the relative accumulation of kiwifruit MADSbox gene transcripts in the wild-type male and female
flowers and ‘Pukekohe dwarf’ mutant flowers, a model
of kiwifruit floral organ specification was proposed
(Figure 7). Sharp gene expression boundaries combined
with gradients of gene expression within the expression
domains are responsible for the (A)BCE-like floral organ
identity in the wild type, regular, four-whorled kiwifruit
flower. The A function may require a yet unidentified

specification in Actinidia. Fm, floral meristem; Se, sepal; Pe, petal;
St, stamen; Pi, pistil; F, fruit.

AP1-like protein, or is derived from floral meristem specifying factors, e.g. FUL-like, FUL and SEP4 proteins;
their accumulation is sufficient to promote bracts as
intermediates between leaves and sepals, but additional
SEP proteins (SEP1 or SEP3) are required for true sepalidentity. Extended PI expression in the mutant is the
likely reason for extended petaloid features and multiple
petal whorls.

Conclusions
Over the past decades, kiwifruit has developed into an
important horticultural crop, firstly in New Zealand and
subsequently in other countries. Current research on
kiwifruit is mainly focused around consumer-driven
traits such as fruit flavour and fragrance, appearance,
healthful components and convenience, but the knowledge of the genetic regulation of flowering is very scarce.
This report provides a description of flower development in kiwifruit at the molecular level. It has identified
genes that will be utilized as genetic markers for inflorescence and flower development and candidates that are
expected to have an impact on kiwifruit growth, phase
change and time of flowering.
Methods
Plant materials

The majority of the plant material used in this study
was collected from two female cultivars that are grown
commercially in New Zealand: ‘Hort16A’ (A. chinensis
Planch.) and’Hayward’ (A. deliciosa (A. Chev.) C.F.
Liang et A.R. Ferguson). For expression studies in
mature flowers, in addition to female A. deliciosa ’Hayward’ normal flowers, male A. deliciosa ’Chieftain’ normal flowers and A. deliciosa ’Pukekohe dwarf’ aberrant
flowers were used. All kiwifruit plants were grown in
the orchard under natural climatic conditions. The vines
were trained on a T-bar training system and underwent
pruning according to standard orchard management

practice. All studies were carried out on tissue collected
from at least six individual plants, with the exception of
‘Pukekohe dwarf’, where only one plant was available.
Root, stem, leaf, flower, and fruit tissue collection was
carried out on A. chinensis ‘Hort16A’ and A. deliciosa
‘Hayward’ vines growing at the Plant & Food Research
orchard near Kerikeri, New Zealand, during the spring
and summer season of 2005-06. Mature flower organ
tissues were collected from A. deliciosa ’Hayward’,
‘Chieftain’ and ‘Pukekohe dwarf’ growing in the research
orchard near Te Puke, New Zealand, during the season
of 2006-2007.
For expression analysis during early shoot development, kiwifruit vines (canes) were collected from A. chinensis ’Hort16A’ grown in the research orchard near Te
Puke, New Zealand in autumn 2010. The canes were
stored at 4°C for three weeks. Excised canes are frequently used in budbreak and flowering studies and
cold storage is a standard practice that maintains buds
at dormant state [76]. Bud development was initiated
upon immersion of lower side of the cane in water and
maintenance in 24°C and natural light. Whole dormant
buds and emerging shoots were collected. For analysis
in the fragments of the emerging shoot, unfolding leaves
were removed prior to collection of the basal (flowerbearing), medial and apical fragments.
For seasonal expression analysis, samples were collected from autumn to late spring at monthly intervals
from A. chinensis ’Hort16A’ and A. deliciosa ’Hayward’
vines growing in the research orchard near Te Puke,
New Zealand, during the season of 2006-2007. Shoot
primordia were dissected from axillary buds from the
second, third and fourth node distal to the most distal
fruit and represented the same developmental unit,
starting as latent buds established during the first season that were dormant over the winter months and
resumed development and outgrowth in the spring.
The last two samples collected corresponded to emergence of pubescent bud scales and leaf emergence,
respectively.
Arabidopsis thaliana ’Columbia’ (Col-0) ecotype
plants were grown in the greenhouse under a long day
(21°C, 14/10 h light/dark) or short day regime (21°C, 8/
16 h light/dark).
Phylogeny

The Actinidia EST database [12] was interrogated using
BLAST analysis [77]. Kiwifruit EST sequences were
uploaded to Vector NTI version 9.0.0 http://www.invitrogen.com. Sequence alignment was performed using
Vector NTI Clustal W (opening 15, extension penalty
0.3). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA
version 3.1 [78] using a minimum evolution phylogeny
test and 1000 bootstrap replicates.

Gene isolation and vector construction

Clones containing full-length cDNA of FUL-like, FUL,
AP3, PI, SEP3 and SEP4 were obtained from the Plant &
Food Research Actinidia EST library [12]. cDNA of
FUL-like, FUL and SEP3 were cloned as SpeI-XhoI fragments into the corresponding sites of pSAK778 binary
vector [79]. cDNA of SEP4 was cloned as an Asp718XbaI fragment into the corresponding sites of pART277
binary vector, produced by cloning the pART7 NotI
CaMV35S-mcs-ocs3’cassette into the NotI site of
pART27 [80]. cDNAs of AP3 and PI, flanked by the
attB1 and attB2 sequences in pCMV-SPORT6 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corp.), were transferred to the
Gateway-adapted pHEX2 destination binary vector [81],
via the pDONR221 intermediate vector, using Gateway
recombination cloning, with all reactions performed as
recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Fulllength cDNA copy of AG was isolated from A. chinensis
flower cDNA using PCR amplification (primer
sequences listed in Additional file 3), cloned into
pGEM-T Easy (Promega) for sequencing purposes and
further cloned as SpeI-XbaI fragment into corresponding sites of pSAK778 binary vector [79]. Construction of
these plant transformation vectors placed each fulllength cDNA between the CaMV 35S promoter and ocs
3’ transcriptional terminator. The resulting plasmids
were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain
GV3101 by the electroporation method.
Arabidopsis transformation

Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated plant transformation was performed by the floral dipping method [82].
Seeds of transgenic plants were selected on 1/2 MS
medium supplemented with kanamycin and placed in a
growth room under appropriate day-length conditions.
RNA extraction and expression studies

Total RNA was isolated from kiwifruit tissue as described
by Gasic et al [83]. The concentration of RNA was determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Reverse
transcription (RT) was performed using RNA treated
with DNase I (Invitrogen), an oligo(dT) primer and the
SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantifications
using real-time PCR were performed with the FastStart
DNA Master SYBR Green I reaction mix (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany) using the Lightcycler 1.5
instrument and the LightCycler Software version 4
(Roche Diagnostics). Primers were designed to produce
amplification products within the range of 160-260
nucleotides. Primer sequences are listed in Additional file
3. The specificity of primer pairs was confirmed by melting curve analysis of PCR products and agarose gel

Varkonyi-Gasic et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:72
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/72

electrophoresis followed by sequencing. Reactions were
performed in triplicates and a negative water control was
included in each run. Products were quantified against
the standard curve using dilutions of a sample with the
highest expression and the expression was normalized to
kiwifruit ACTIN (GenBank accession number
FG403300). Error bars shown in the qPCR data represent
the standard error (SE) of three replicate PCR reactions.
Yeast-two-hybrid assays

Full-length open reading frames of Actinidia MADS-box
genes were amplified using a two-step adapter PCR
strategy which incorporated the complete attB sequence
(Additional file 3). The PCR fragment was recombined
in the Gateway™ pDONR221 vector, resulting in an
entry clone. All entry clones were verified using
sequence analysis before cloning in the yeast two-hybrid
GAL4 binding domain vector pDEST32 (bait) and
GAL4 activating domain vector pDEST22 (prey). Bait
vectors were transformed into yeast strain PJ69-4a
(MATa;[84]) and prey vectors into strain PJ69-4a
(MATa;[84]) and selected on SC plates lacking Leu and
Trp, respectively. The baits and preys were systematically mated by spotting 5 μL droplets on top of each
other on SC complete plates. After overnight incubation
at 30°C, the yeast was transferred to SC plates lacking
Leu and Trp to select for diploid yeast containing both
plasmids, and incubated at 30°C for 2 days. This transfer
was performed once more, after which the yeast was
transferred to separate selection plates containing SC
medium lacking Trp, Leu and His and supplemented
with 0, 1, 3 or 5 mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Plates were
incubated for four days at 20°C and scored for growth.
The screening was performed in duplicate.

Additional material
Additional file 1: Intron characteristic of AG C lineage, An intron
located in the last codon of predicted Actinidia AG gene was
amplified from A. deliciosa ’Hayward’ and A. chinensis “Hort16A’.
The presence of this intron is characteristic for the C but not the D
lineage of the angiosperm AG subfamily. Three types of intron
sequences were obtained from a hexaploid ‘Hayward’ (one 95 bp and
two 188 bp in length) and one type was amplified from a diploid
‘Hort16A’ (193 bp).
Additional file 2: Nucleotide sequence alignment of Actinidia AG
cDNA. cDNA was amplified from A. chinensis ’Hort16A’, A. deliciosa
’Hayward’ and A. deliciosa ’Pukekohe dwarf’ flower cDNA. The A. arguta
AG sequence was obtained from the Actinidia EST database.
Additional file 3: Nucleotide sequence of oligonucleotides used in
this study.
