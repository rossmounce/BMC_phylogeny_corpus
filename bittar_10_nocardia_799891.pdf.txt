Abstract
Introduction: Respiratory tract infections are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic
fibrosis. Nocardia are rarely implicated in these infections and few reports of the involvement of this species are
found in the literature.
Case presentation: We describe a case of lung infection followed by chronic colonization of trimethoprim and
sulfamethoxazole resistant Nocardia farcinica in a patient with cystic fibrosis. The chronic colonization of this
uncommon bacterium in patients with cystic fibrosis was proved using a newly developed real-time polymerase
chain reaction assay, which indicates that this bacterium, despite treatment, is difficult to eradicate.
Conclusion: Our case report confirms that this organism can be recovered in persons with cystic fibrosis. Its
eradication is necessary especially if the patient is to undergo lung transplantation.

Introduction
Since the early description of cystic fibrosis (CF), pulmonary infection has been recognized as having the
greatest role in morbidity and mortality leading to premature death in 90% of patients reported [1,2]. It has
been demonstrated that accurate antimicrobial treatment is of great importance in avoiding the rapid
destruction of the lung function of patients and in the
spread of multidrug-resistant and/or highly virulent
pathogens [1].
Case presentation
In February 2007, a 15-year-old Caucasian French boy
with CF (ΔF508, M1V heterozygote genotyping pattern)
was admitted to the CF center in Marseille, France. He
presented with fever (39°C), fatigue, haemoptysis, bronchial syndrome, and respiratory decompensation. His
chest X-ray showed multiple bilateral bronchial thickening. He has had a history of persistent colonization of the
respiratory tract since childhood with Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. He also had a primary

colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the age of
10 and with Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans
at the age of 13. Our patient received inhaled fluticasone
(1500 μg/day) on several occasions in 2006.
On admission, his laboratory tests showed a white
blood cell count of 25.63 × 109/L with 87% polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). His C-reactive protein (CRP) was
at 92 mg/L. A direct Gram-staining of his sputum taken
at the time of his admission showed the presence of
many polymorphonuclear leukocytes without squamous
cells. The presence of Gram-positive branching filamentous bacilli and Gram-positive cocci was also noted. A
standard culture and conventional identification of his
sputum sample yielded 10 4 CFU/ml of S. aureus,
10 4 CFU/ml of Nocardia sp. that was isolated from
Columbia colistin-nalidixic acid (CNA) agar (BioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) after three days of incubation. Accurate identification at species level was
achieved after 16S rDNA amplification and sequencing
[3] leading to the discovery of N. farcinica (GenBank
accession number AB162795, 100%). The sequence of
our isolate has been deposited in GenBank under accession number EU861514. The phylogenetic position of
N. farcinica (strain 7400458) among closely related bacteria is presented in Figure 1. Using the disk diffusion
method we found out that the isolate was resistant to

rifampicin, erythromycin, gentamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Meanwhile, we found it susceptible to amoxicillin, imipenem
and ciprofloxacin.
Our patient subsequently received a three-week course
of intravenous ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. One month later, his leukocyte
count decreased to 6.4 × 109/L (50% PMNs), the culture
was found negative, and our patient was declared clinically cured. During a follow-up examination after one
year, N. farcinica was cultured four, six and nine
months later and was not cultured at two and three
months and one year later.

In December 2007, our patient was started on a
six-month course of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (160/800 mg, 1.5 tablets, b.i.d.) and nebulized
amikacin (500 mg, b.i.d., one month/two during six
months) in order to eradicate the bacterium. However, because of the difficulty in isolating Nocardia
species in sputum samples, as well as the poor sensitivity of the culture method, we decided to investigate
retrospectively all sputum samples available for our
patient using a more sensitive assay (molecular detection). For this purpose we used a specific putative
non-ribosomal peptide synthetase sequence [4,5] to
develop an original real-time PCR assay with

Taqman* probe. The primers designed for this RT
PCR were as follows: NFF1 (5’-ACCGATCCGCCGT
CAAATC-3’) and NFR1 (5’-TCGGTCGTCCGGTG
TGGA-3’) that amplified a 147 bp of this gene with a
probe of NFP1 (5’-CACATACCCCAACGCCAGC
TGA-3’). The DNA from his sputa was extracted in a
MagNa Pure LC instrument (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Using our PCR assay, all investigated negative and
positive N. farcinica culture sputa were positive in PCR
even in sputa recovered one year before the first culture
detection (Figure 2). Retrospectively, our patient’s medical record was rechecked as his clinical condition,
including cough, haemoptysis, purulent mucoid expectoration, and elevated CRP and leukocytes (> 80%
PMNs) worsened at that stage.

Discussion
N. farcinica is a Gram-positive branching filamentous
bacillus causing many localized and disseminated
infections in humans, including pulmonary and wound
infections, brain abscesses, and bacteremia [6]. Immunocompromised hosts and patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapies are more commonly affected by
this bacterium [6], but the isolation of N. farcinica from
the respiratory tract of patients with CF is rare. Only

three reports described the isolation of this bacillus in
patients with CF: the case of a 31-year-old woman with
deteriorated clinical parameters [7], the case of an
8-year-old boy who presented with fever and worsened
chronic cough and who had previously received corticosteroid for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
treatment [8], and the case of a 28-year-old woman with
cough, dyspnea, fever, and hemoptysis and who had previously received corticosteroid [9]. Interestingly, our
patient had a corticosteroid treatment history before the
Nocardia isolation. Meanwhile, other Nocardia species
have been reported in patients with CF, including N.
asteroides, N. asiatica, N. elegans, and N. transvalensis
[9,10].
Nocardiae are ubiquitous in the environment and can
be found worldwide in fresh and salt water, in a variety
of soil types, dust, decaying vegetation, and decaying
fecal deposits from animals [6]. Dasgupta et al.
described a patient who was an active gardener [7].
Interestingly, our patient also worked as a gardener,
which led us to conclude that he might have acquired
the infection in his job.
The first isolation of N. farcinica in our case was associated with clinical symptoms including fever, haemoptysis, bronchial syndrome, and multiple bilateral
bronchial thickening and radiographic change. Our
patient was then chronically colonized with this bacillus

as proven by our new real-time PCR that appears more
sensitive than culture (Figure 2). In the case reports of
Isabel Barrio et al., [9], six of 9 patients (67%) with
Nocardia species isolations had clinical manifestations,
while the Nocardia species were repeatedly isolated 3
patients. After a mean follow-up at 48 ± 33 months,
however, the cultures were negative for all of the
patients studied.
N. farcinica infections are potentially life-threatening
[6,11]. The complete genome sequence of a clinical
isolate (N. farcinica IFM 10152) revealed the presence
of many candidate genes for virulence and antibiotic
resistance [5]. After conducting a genomic analysis, the
authors suggested that this bacterium can survive not
only in soil environment but also in animal tissues,
thus resulting in human disease [5]. It is now known
N. farcinica is a multidrug-resistant bacterium that is
susceptible mainly to amikacin, imipenem, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin [6]. Isolates
from our patient were resistant to trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole.
Cases involving N. farcinica that is resistant to
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole have been described
previously [5,12]. Chronic lung colonization in our
patient, which was demonstrated by his positive PCR
assay, indicates that antibiotic treatment does
efficiently and completely eradicate the bacterium. In
two recent case reports, the authors indicate that the
need for Nocardia treatment should be evaluated on
an individual basis and in the context of a clinical
picture [9,10]. We believe that Nocardia eradication
is needed in patients with CF, especially if they are
due to undergo lung transplantation. The reason for
this is that the immunosuppressive regimen during
the pre- and/or post-operative period is a wellestablished risk factor for serious cases of nocardiosis
and disseminated disease that leads to high rate of
mortality [13].
The impact of the presence of multiresistant pathogens on the survival of patients with CF after lung transplantation remains controversial [14,15]. In the case of
nocardiosis in patients with CF, no recommendations or
data appear in the literature.

Conclusion
We reported a case of lung infection followed by
chronic colonization of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
resistant N. farcinica in a patient with CF. Our case
report confirms that this infrequent organism can be
recovered in such a population. We think that this
unusual bacterium could be the cause of major clinical
concern for patients with CF when immunosuppressive
treatment is needed in cases requiring lung
transplantation.
