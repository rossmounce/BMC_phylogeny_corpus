Molecular evolution of the LNX gene family
Michael Flynn†, Orthis Saha† and Paul Young*

Abstract
Background: LNX (Ligand of Numb Protein-X) proteins typically contain an amino-terminal RING domain adjacent
to either two or four PDZ domains - a domain architecture that is unique to the LNX family. LNX proteins function
as E3 ubiquitin ligases and their domain organisation suggests that their ubiquitin ligase activity may be targeted
to specific substrates or subcellular locations by PDZ domain-mediated interactions. Indeed, numerous interaction
partners for LNX proteins have been identified, but the in vivo functions of most family members remain largely
unclear.
Results: To gain insights into their function we examined the phylogenetic origins and evolution of the LNX gene
family. We find that a LNX1/LNX2-like gene arose in an early metazoan lineage by gene duplication and fusion
events that combined a RING domain with four PDZ domains. These PDZ domains are closely related to the four
carboxy-terminal domains from multiple PDZ domain containing protein-1 (MUPP1). Duplication of the LNX1/LNX2like gene and subsequent loss of PDZ domains appears to have generated a gene encoding a LNX3/LNX4-like
protein, with just two PDZ domains. This protein has novel carboxy-terminal sequences that include a potential
modular LNX3 homology domain. The two ancestral LNX genes are present in some, but not all, invertebrate
lineages. They were, however, maintained in the vertebrate lineage, with further duplication events giving rise to
five LNX family members in most mammals. In addition, we identify novel interactions of LNX1 and LNX2 with
three known MUPP1 ligands using yeast two-hybrid asssays. This demonstrates conservation of binding specificity
between LNX and MUPP1 PDZ domains.
Conclusions: The LNX gene family has an early metazoan origin with a LNX1/LNX2-like protein likely giving rise to
a LNX3/LNX4-like protein through the loss of PDZ domains. The absence of LNX orthologs in some lineages
indicates that LNX proteins are not essential in invertebrates. In contrast, the maintenance of both ancestral LNX
genes in the vertebrate lineage suggests the acquisition of essential vertebrate specific functions. The revelation
that the LNX PDZ domains are phylogenetically related to domains in MUPP1, and have common binding
specificities, suggests that LNX and MUPP1 may have similarities in their cellular functions.

Background
In most mammals the LNX (Ligand of Numb Protein-X)
or PDZRN (PDZ and RING) family of proteins consists
of five members that, in the interest of clarity, we shall
refer to hereafter as LNX1 - LNX5. These proteins are
characterized by the presence of a RING domain (Really
Interesting New Gene) followed by between one and
four PDZ domains (PSD-95, DlgA, ZO-1). Within the
LNX family, LNX1 and LNX2 are closely related and
share an identical domain structure consisting of one

RING and four PDZ domains (Figure 1)[1]. LNX3 and
LNX4 (PDZRN3 and PDZRN4) typically have a RING
domain and two PDZ domains; they are very similar to
each other but more distantly related to LNX1 and
LNX2 [2]. Although LNX5 (PDZK4, PDZRN4L) lacks
the RING domain, it is clearly a member of the family
based on high sequence homology to LNX3 and LNX4
[3,4]. Within vertebrates, the presence of RING and
PDZ domains in one protein is unique to the LNX
family. RING domains function as the catalytic component of E3 ubiquitin ligases - enzymes that catalyze the
final step in the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate
proteins and are believed to confer specificity to the

Figure 1 Domain structures of mammalian LNX proteins. LNX1
and LNX2 share an identical domain structure, as do LNX3 and
LNX4. LNX5 resembles LNX3 and 4 but lacks the RING and one PDZ
domain. The regions of LNX3, 4 and 5 carboxy-terminal to the PDZ
domains show significant sequence similarity, particularly in the last
150 amino acids that we define here as the LNX3 homology
(LNX3H) domain. The number of amino acids (aa) in the murine
LNX proteins are indicated. Isoforms of LNX1, 3 and 4 resulting from
alternative splicing and alternative promoter usage are not shown.

ubiquitination process [5]. PDZ domains are an important and abundant class of protein-protein interaction
domains that often bind to the carboxy-terminus of
their ligands [6,7]. The combination of RING and PDZ
domains in the LNX family proteins suggests that the
ubiquitin ligase activity of these proteins may be targeted to specific substrate proteins by PDZ domainmediated interactions.
LNX1 was identified as a protein that interacts with
Numb and named Ligand of Numb protein X [8]. Numb
is a component of the Notch signaling pathway that functions in the specification of cell fates during development
and is known to control cell numbers during neurogenesis
in vertebrates [9]. LNX1 can ubiquitinate Numb, thereby
targeting Numb to proteasomal degradation [8,10]. The
Numb-LNX interaction involves a four amino acid NPAY
motif in LNX1 binding to a phosphotyrosine-binding
domain in Numb [8,10,11]. Subsequent to the characterisation of LNX1, the highly homologous LNX2 protein was
identified and shown to interact via its NPAF motif with
Numb, as well as with its paralog Numblike [1]. While the
ability of LNX1, and likely LNX2, to ubiquitinate Numb
and thereby modulate Notch signaling in cultured cells is
very clear [10,11], this function has not yet been demonstrated for LNX proteins in vivo during development.
Apart from Numb, several other interaction partners
of LNX1 and LNX2 have been identified. These include

signaling proteins such as the ErbB2, RhoC and c-Src,
the presynaptic protein CAST, the melanoma/cancertestis antigen MAGEB18 and several proteins associated
with cell junctions such as claudin-1, JAM4 and the
Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR)[12-19].
Of these only c-Src and claudin-1 were shown to be
LNX1 substrates [16,17]. Ubiquitination by LNX1 targets c-Src for proteasomal degradation, whereas claudin1 is endocytosed and trafficked to lysosomes [16,17].
The interactions with claudin-1, JAM4 and CAR suggest
a possible role for LNX in the formation or remodeling
of cell-cell junctions. In agreement with this, ectopic
expression of LNX1 can remove claudins from cell junctions and can enhance TGFb-induced epithelial to
mesenchymal transition in epithelial cells [16,20]. However, the in vivo relevance of any of the aforementioned
LNX1 or LNX2 interactions has yet to be demonstrated
definitively. This is probably due to the fact that LNX1
and LNX2 proteins are expressed at exceedingly low
levels in cell lines and in vivo[18,20]. Despite widespread
mRNA distribution [1], reports on LNX1 or LNX2 protein expression are limited. LNX1 protein was found to
localize very specifically within perisynaptic Schwann
cells at neuromuscular junctions [18]. Both LNX1 and
LNX2 proteins are present in spermatozoa, and LNX2
expression was reported in a subset of blood vessels
during embryonic development [18,21,22]. However, the
in vivo function of LNX1 and LNX2 proteins, in either
these or other contexts, remain largely uncertain.
LNX3 (PDZRN3, SEMCAP3) was first identified based
on its interaction in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a
Semaphorin (Sema4C)[23]. A similar approach identified
PDZ domain-mediated interactions of LNX3 with neuroligin1, ephrin-B2 and the GluR2 glutamate receptor
subunit, but none of these interactions have been characterized further [24]. It was Ko et al (2006) who provided the first detailed description of LNX3 function
[25]. They reported that LNX3 mRNA is most highly
expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and that LNX3
was required for the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts
into myotubes. The same group subsequently described
a role for LNX3 in the BMP-2 -induced differentiation
of C2C12 cells into osteoblasts [26]. In this context
LNX3 acts as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation by inhibiting Wnt-b-catenin signaling. A distinct
role for LNX3 in neuromuscular junction formation has
also been reported [27]. Here LNX3 was found to interact with and ubiquitinate the muscle specific tyrosine
kinase (MuSK), thereby promoting its endocytosis and
negatively regulating the cell surface expression of this
key regulator of postsynaptic assembly. In agreement
with this, transgenic overexpression of LNX3 was found
to perturb neuromuscular junction formation in vivo
[27]. Overall LNX3 appears to play distinct roles in the

development and differentiation of both muscle and
osteoblasts and is the best characterized of the mammalian LNX proteins.
LNX4 (PDZRN4/PDZRN4S) and LNX5 (PDZRN4L/
PDZK4) were identified in silico based on homology to
LNX3 [2,3]. LNX4 is almost completely uncharacterized
apart from a report that it is down regulated in the
hypothalamus of Sim1 knockout mice [28]. LNX5 was
identified as a gene up-regulated in synovial sarcomas
and was found to promote proliferation of synovial sarcoma cells [4]. In normal tissues LNX5 mRNA expression is largely confined to the brain, but its physiological
function here is unknown [4].
In the present study, we take advantage of the availability of complete genome sequences for diverse
metazoan species to examine the evolution of the LNX
gene family for the first time. In particular, we focus on
the phylogenetic origins of the family and the evolutionary relationship between LNX1/2-like and LNX3/4-like
proteins. Our analysis traces the ancestral LNX gene to
the earliest metazoan lineage. We characterize what may
be a novel, modular protein domain present in LNX3,
-4 and -5. We also reveal a close phylogenetic relationship between the LNX and MUPP1 protein families.
Based on this relationship, we identify novel LNX1- and
LNX2-interacting proteins.

Results
Identification of LNX1/LNX2 orthologs

LNX1 and LNX2 share exactly the same domain architecture (Figure 1) and display 50% amino acid sequence
identity. Orthologs of both LNX1 and LNX2 are found
in virtually all vertebrates for which complete genome
sequences are available. In addition, fish, marsupial,
amphibian and bird genomes have a third LNX1/2-like
gene that has been termed LNX-like or LNX2b in zebra
fish [29,30] and confusingly called LNX3 in chicken and
marsupials [31]. We suggest that this paralog be called
LNX2b to reflect the fact that it encodes a protein that
is most similar to LNX2. Eutherian mammals have only
two LNX1/2-like genes with the loss of LNX2b occuring
when it underwent pseudogenization and contributed
several exons to the non-coding Xist RNA that controls
X-chromosome inactivation [31].
Database searches for invertebrate LNX1 or LNX2
orthologs identified a single LNX gene, most similar to
LNX2, in representative species of some, but not all
non-vertebrate bilaterian lineages (Figure 2). Thus a
clear LNX1/2 ortholog was identified in the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae and in the platyhelminth Schistosoma mansoni, but not in the
urochordates, arthropods, nematodes or molluscs (represented by Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila melanogaster,
Caenorhabditis elegans and Aplysia californica). LNX1/

Page 3 of 14

2-related proteins that lack the RING domain were
identified in the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii
and the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus pupuratus.
Examining more basal metazoan lineages, we did not
find LNX1/2 orthologs in cnidaria or placozoa, but a
LNX1/2 ortholog is found in the poriferan Amphimedon
queenslandica[32,33]. No LNX1/2 ortholog was found in
choanoflagellates or any other non-metazoan species.
Thus the ancestral LNX1/2-like gene appears to have an
early metazoan origin prior to the divergence of porifera
(sponges) from other metazoans, but has subsequently
been lost from several lineages. This gene is likely to
have been duplicated in the vertebrate ancestor, giving
rise to vertebrate LNX1, LNX2 and LNX2b.
LNX1/LNX2 and Multiple PDZ Protein1 (MUPP1/MPP1/
MPDZ1) share a common ancestor

In searching for LNX1/2 orthologs we noticed a high
degree of sequence similarity between the LNX1/2 PDZ
domains and the carboxy-terminal PDZ domains from
MUPP1 and its paralog INADL/PATJ. MUPP1 contains
an amino terminal L27 domain and 13 PDZ domains,
while INADL/PATJ has the same architecture but has
just 10 PDZ domains. To examine this relationship
more closely, we generated a phylogenetic tree to compare the vertebrate LNX2 PDZ domains with all the
PDZ domains from human and T. adhaerens MUPP1
proteins as well as those from A. queenslandica LNX2
(Figure 3). The tree reveals a close relationship between
PDZ domains 1-4 of LNX2 and domains 10-13 respectively of MUPP1. Examination of splice junctions within
the PDZ domains confirmed this relationship with
domains 10, 11 and12 of MUPP1 having splice junctions
at exactly the same positions as domains 1, 2 and 3
respectively of LNX2 (Additional File 1). This relationship suggests that the LNX1/2 PDZ domains and the
four carboxy-terminal domains of MUPP1 are derived
from a common ancestor. The choanoflagellate, Monsiga
brevicollis, lacks a LNX1/2 ortholog but has a MUPP1like protein with 6 PDZ domains. MUPP1 and LNX2
proteins are thus likely to be derived from a MUPP1like protein in the ancestral metazoan lineage.
Identification of LNX3/LNX4/LNX5 orthologs

LNX3 and LNX4 proteins show close to 60% amino acid
identity. The sequence similarity spans the amino terminal RING and two PDZ domains, as well as extensive
regions in the non-modular carboxy-terminal half of the
protein. Although LNX5 lacks a RING domain and has
only one PDZ domain, it is 50% identical to LNX3 and
LNX4 and contains the conserved carboxy-terminal
regions, confirming it as a true paralog. Most vertebrate
genomes encode both a LNX3 and LNX4 ortholog,
though a few species lack one or the other gene (but

phylogenetic tree of metazoans. Domain structures of predicted proteins from a representative species in each lineage are indicated. Proteins
are classified as being orthologs of vertebrate LNX1 and LNX2 (LNX1/2) or vertebrate LNX3 and LNX4 (LNX3/4). LNX3/4 orthologs were identified
based on the presence of both a RING and PDZ domain, or the presence of the LNX3H domain. The C. intestinalis and S. pupuratus LNX3/4
sequences are incomplete.

not both). Specifically, Canis familiaris (dog) and
Ornithorhynchus anatinus (platypus) appear to lack
LNX3, while no LNX4 homolog is found in Monodelphis
domestica (opossum). LNX5 is found in most amphibian, fish and mammalian species but seems to be
absent from birds. Invertebrate orthologs of LNX3/
LNX4 containing RING and PDZ domains are found in
some metazoan lineages including hemichordates (S.
kowalevskii) and echinoderms(S. pupuratus), cnidarians
(Hydra magnipapillata) and placozoans (Trichoplax
adhaerens) (Figure 2). All of these invertebrate LNX3
orthologs contain two PDZ domains with the exception
of T. adhaerens in which the second PDZ is not discernible. No PDZ domain-containing LNX3 homolog is
found in the draft assembly of the poriferan A. queenslandica genome [33], nor was an ortholog found in the
choanoflagellate M brevicollis. A LNX3/4-like protein
can thus be traced back to the common ancestor of

cnidarians, placozoans and bilaterians. Duplications of
the ancestral LNX3/4-like gene gave rise to LNX3, LNX4
and LNX5 in vertebrates with LNX5 losing the exons
encoding the RING and one PDZ domain.
Characterisation of a LNX3 homology domain

The carboxy-terminal half of LNX3 lacks any identifiable domains annotated in the Pfam, SMART or InterPro databases [34-36], yet this region is highly
conserved in LNX4 and LNX5 and in all invertebrate
LNX3/4 orthologs with the exception of T. adhaerens.
Within this region, the last 150 amino acids are particularly similar and the degree of cross-species sequence
identity is as high as that for the PDZ and RING
domains. In fact, many invertebrate lineages have
LNX3/4-like proteins that contain this highly conserved
carboxy-terminal region, but lack the characteristic
RING domain and may also be missing one or both of

melanogaster Slip1 (CG1783). With the availability of
sequences from other species, we can better define this
conserved region that we term the LNX3 homology
(LNX3H) domain. Figure 4 shows a multiple sequence
alignment of the carboxy-terminal regions of vertebrate
LNX3, 4 and 5 and selected invertebrate LNX3 orthologs. The high degree of sequence conservation between
diverse species within this region is apparent and indeed
automated domain detection methods identify this
region as a potential domain (Prodomain family
PD140124, ADDA family 37421)[37,38]. Such conservation is not seen in the rest of the sequence (full alignment available in Additional file 2). Notably the D.
melanogaster Slip1 is shorter than all other sequences
examined including several other arthropods, thus the
consensus LNX3 homology region is more extensive
than that previously identified [3].
We used the multiple sequence alignment to generate a
protein secondary structure prediction for the LNX3H
domain on the Jpred 3 server [39]. The Jpred algorithim
predicts several alpha-helical regions with a high degree of
confidence as well as some potential beta sheets or regions
with an extended confirmation (Figure 4). The conservation of this region across diverse species and secondary
structure prediction are consistent with this 150 amino
acid region being a modular folded domain with functions
independent of the RING and PDZ domains.
Phylogenetic relationship between LNX1/2 and LNX3/4

LNX2 and MUPP1. LNX2 PDZ domain sequences from A.
queenslandica and a consensus vertebrate sequence, as well as PDZ
domains from H. sapiens and T. adhaerens MUPP1 protein were
analyzed. For each protein PDZ domains are numbered
consecutively (#1, #2 etc). Using the Neighbor-Joining method, a
bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from 1000 replicates and is
taken to represent the evolutionary history of the sequences
analyzed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated
domains clustered together in the bootstrap test is shown next to
the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the
same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the
phylogenetic tree. Clustering of the four LNX PDZ domains with the
last four domains of MUPP1 is highlighted in the shaded boxes.

the PDZ domains (Figure 2). Lineages that have such
“RING-less” or “RING and PDZ-less” LNX3/4 relatives
include arthropods (Slip1 in D. melanogaster), nematodes (C. elegans) and cephalochordates (B. floridae).
Katoh and Katoh (2004) had previously identified conserved sequences shared by LNX3/4 and D.

The combination of an amino terminal RING domain
with carboxy-terminal PDZ domains (RING-PDZ n )
appears to be unique to the LNX family. In principle,
however, the common domain architecture of LNX1/2like and LNX3/4-like proteins may have arisen independently. PDZ and RING domains are abundant in
metazoan genomes and so the independent evolution of
a RING-PDZn architecture more than once is plausible.
Indeed, in arthropods this domain combination does
seem to have arisen independently, but in the reverse
order (PDZ-RING). Since LNX1/2 and LNX3/4 have
only limited sequence homology in non-modular regions
we examined the relationships between the RING and
PDZ domains of LNX1-4. Using a BLASTP search, we
find that the most similar protein sequences to the
RING domain of human LNX1 are the RING domains
of LNX2, LNX4 and LNX3 respectively (79%, 46% and
45% identity). To examine relationships between the
PDZ domains, we have generated a phylogenetic tree
from an alignment of all human PDZ domains (Additional file 3). We find that PDZ2 of LNX1 and LNX2
clusters very tightly with PDZ2 of LNX3 and LNX4,
while the PDZ1 domains from all four proteins are likewise closely related. These close relationships between
both the RING and PDZ domains of LNX1/2 and

LNX3/4 as compared to any other sequences in the
human genome argue strongly that they did indeed arise
from a single evolutionary event that combined an
amino-terminal RING domain with PDZ domains at the
carboxy-terminal side.

Our analysis indicates that LNX1/2 and LNX3/4 did
share a common ancestor and that the two PDZ
domains in LNX3/4 correspond to PDZ domains 1 and
2 of LNX1/2. This suggests two possible scenarios for
the evolution of the LNX family: 1) a LNX1/2-like

Flynn et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:235
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/235

protein with four PDZ domains might have arisen from
a LNX3/4 like ancestor through acquisition/duplication
of PDZ domains; 2) a LNX3/4-like protein with two
PDZ domain may have arisen from a LNX1/2-like
ancestor protein through loss of two PDZ domains. The
poriferan A. queenslandica has a LNX2 ortholog with
four PDZ domains. The most basal lineages with a clear
LNX3/4 homolog are placozoans and cnidarians. While
the A. queenslandica genome is not completely
assembled, it appears that a LNX1/2-like protein predates the evolution of LNX3/4. Our analysis of LNX2
PDZ domains indicates that they are closely related to
the most carboxy-terminal PDZ domains of MUPP1 and
are derived from a common ancestor (Figure 3). A.
queenslandica has a MUPP1 ortholog indicating that
LNX2 and MUPP derived from a common multiple
PDZ domain-containing protein in the ancestor of
metazoans. We propose a model for the evolution of the
LNX family in which an ancestral LNX2-like protein in
the earliest metazoans gave rise to a LNX3/4-like protein with two PDZ domains (Figure 5). The highly

Page 7 of 14

conserved LNX3H domain is found in most lineages
from cnidarians onward suggesting that it arose in
LNX3/4 subsequent to the loss of the carboxy-terminal
PDZ domains. LNX2 was lost in many metazoan
lineages but retained in vertebrates. LNX3/4 orthologs
are found in most metazoans; but in many lineages
these orthologs have lost the RING domain and in some
cases the PDZ domains, leaving the LNX3H domain as
the most defining characteristic of this branch of the
LNX family. In vertebrates, duplications of the ancestral
LNX1/2-like gene gave rise to LNX1, LNX2 and LNX2b
and likewise gene duplication generated LNX3, LNX4
and LNX5 from the LNX3/4-like ancestral gene.
Identification of common LNX1/2 and MUPP1 interaction
partners

The shared phylogenetic origins of the LNX2 and
MUPP1 PDZ domains prompted us to examine whether
the two proteins share any interacting proteins. Proteins
that interact with PDZ domains 10-13 of MUPP1, or
the equivalent domains from INADL/PATJ (PDZ

Figure 5 A model of the molecular phylogeny of the LNX family. A LNX1/2-like protein is likely to have arisen through genomic
rearrangements in a very early metazoan that combined a RING domain with four PDZ domains. The LNX PDZ domains are derived from PDZ
domains encoded by an ancestral gene that also gave rise to the four carboxy-terminal PDZ domains of MUPP1 (PDZ 10-13). LNX3/4-like
proteins resulted from the loss of two PDZ domains and the acquisition or evolution of a novel carboxy-terminal region including what we
define here as a LNX3 homology domain. Gene duplications of both of these invertebrate LNX genes gave rise to the LNX1/LNX2/LNX2b and
LNX3/LNX4/LNX5 subfamilies in vertebrates. A loss of exons encoding the RING and one PDZ domain occurred to give rise to LNX5.

domains 8-10), were identified by searching the primary
literature and protein interaction databases. Among
these proteins, Claudin-1 and CAR, have been independently reported to interact with LNX1 and/or LNX2
[15,16,40,41], while four common ligands of MUPP1
and LNX1 were reported in a large-scale analysis of
PDZ domain interactions using protein microarrays
(Cftr, EphA7, PKC and SSTR2)[42]. We reasoned that
novel ligands for LNX PDZ domains might be identified
among known MUPP1 or INADL/PATJ interactors.
Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we tested whether
the carboxy-terminal peptides from three known
MUPP1 interactors, HTR2C (Serotonin receptor 2C
subunit [43]), SynGAP1 (synaptic GTPase activating
protein [44]) and TAPP1 (tandem pleckstrin homologydomain containing-protein-1 [45]), could also bind to
LNX1 or LNX2. In addition, we examined the previously
reported LNX1 and MUPP1 ligand, EphA7 in order to
confirm these interactions in an independent assay [42].
All four proteins interacted with MUPP1-PDZ10-13 as
judged by activation of both the His3 and bgal reporter
genes (Table 1). This serves as a positive control for the
expression and functionality of the bait constructs. To
test for interactions with LNX1 we used constructs lacking either the RING domain (NPAY-PDZ4) or the 3rd
and 4 th PDZ domains (RING-PDZ2) as prey. These
truncated constructs were used because, in contrast to
LNX2, full-length LNX1 protein was not functional in
the yeast two-hybrid system. HTR2C did not show any
evidence of an interaction with LNX1 constructs and
showed only moderate expression of one reporter gene
when binding to LNX2 was assessed (Table 1). In contrast, SynGAP1, TAPP1 and EphA7 all showed an interaction with LNX1 and/or LNX2, as judged by activation
of both reporter genes. Some LNX1 interactions were
only observed using the carboxy-terminal truncated
RING-PDZ2 construct. This may be because PDZ1 of
LNX1 can bind its own carboxy-terminus, thereby preventing other proteins from binding efficiently to this
domain [1]. To demonstrate the specificity of these

interactions, the ability of carboxy-terminal peptides
from SynGAP1, TAPP1 and EphA7 to bind to unrelated
PDZ domains was assessed. No interactions were
observed with the PDZ domains of either ERBB2IP or
Nos1, while only SynGAP1 showed an interaction with
the PDZ domain-containing protein Dlg2 (Table 1).
This interaction is expected based on the previously
reported interaction of SynGAP1 with Dlg4 [46,47].
Overall these observations indicate that the interactions
of SynGAP1, TAPP1 and EphA7 with LNX proteins are
very specific.
Our strategy of screening known MUPP1 interacting
proteins was thus successful in identifying three novel
ligands for the LNX1 and LNX2 PDZ domains. We also
confirmed the common interaction of LNX1, LNX2 and
MUPP1 with EphA7 and show that EphA7 can bind,
not only to an isolated LNX1 PDZ domain [42], but
also to full-length LNX2 and near full-length LNX1 proteins. To evaluate the scope for other shared interactions, we examined some of the key ligand-binding
residues within the PDZ domains of LNX1, LNX2 and
MUPP1 [48]. For the most part these residues are highly
conserved in all three proteins (Additional file 4). In
agreement with this, a recent computational analysis of
PDZ domain interactions [49] predicts numerous common ligands for MUPP1-PDZ10-13 and the LNX1/
LNX2 PDZ domains (Additional file 5). Many of these
interactions are mediated by equivalent PDZ domains
from both proteins - in agreement with their common
phylogenetic origins.

Discussion
We have undertaken the current phylogenetic analysis
with a view to gleaning some insights into the functions
of the poorly characterized LNX protein family. We find
that the sponge A. queenslandica has a LNX1/2 ortholog. Thus the ancestral LNX1/2 gene would have
evolved in very primitive metazoans, that likely consisted of layers of cells but lacked distinct tissues. This
suggests that the original LNX1/2 protein probably had

The ability of carboxyl terminal sequences from the indicated MUPP1 interacting proteins (baits) to interact with LNX1 and LNX2 (preys) was tested using the
yeast two-hybrid system. An empty prey vector and a MUPP1 prey were included as negative and positive controls respectively. Interactions with unrelated PDZ
domain-containing proteins (ERBB2IP, Nos1 and Dlg2) were assessed to demonstrate the specificity of binding to LNX proteins. Interactions between bait and
prey were indicated by expression of two reporter genes - His3 and LacZ coding for b-galactosidase (b-gal). Truncated LNX1 constructs were used because the
full-length protein was not functional in the yeast two-hybrid system. n/d = not determined.

a general cellular function, one that perhaps related to
the development of multicellular metazoans but was not
specific to a particular tissue type or organ system. It
remains to be seen whether the function of the LNX1/2
ortholog in present day poriferans is closely related to
its ancestral function and whether studying LNX1/2 in
poriferans could provide clues as to the roles of LNX1/2
orthologs in other lineages.
Whatever the role of the ancestral LNX1/2 protein
was, it is apparent that this function is not essential in
invertebrates since many lineages, such as arthropods
and nematodes, lack a LNX1/2-like protein. Nevertheless the LNX1/2 gene was maintained in the lineage
leading to vertebrates and duplicated to give rise to the
paralogous LNX1, LNX2 and LNX2b genes in vertebrates. The duplication of the ancestral LNX1/2 gene
was probably a result of the two rounds (2R hypothesis)
of large-scale gene or whole-genome duplication that
are thought to have occurred early in the vertebrate
lineage [50,51]. The loss of LNX-2b through pseudogenization in eutherian mammals is indicative of some
redundancy of function between the LNX1/2 paralogs,
but the maintenance of at least two paralogs in all vertebrates is suggestive of an essential function for LNX1/2like proteins in vertebrates [31]. LNX1 was first
described as a ligand of Numb - an interaction that is
mediated by an NPAY motif in LNX1 and the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Numb [8,11]. LNX2 has an
NPAF motif that can also bind Numb [1]. It is noteworthy that the invertebrate LNX1/2 orthologs lack
such a motif; therefore, they would not be expected to
bind Numb or modulate Notch signaling via degradation
of Numb. It is possible that the ability to interact with
and regulate Numb is an essential vertebrate specific
function that explains the presence of LNX1/2 orthologs
in all vertebrates. This remains speculative however
until the in vivo significance of this interaction is clarified by loss of function studies. During zebra fish
embryogenesis, LNX-2b functions in the establishment
of the dorso-ventral axis by modulating the activity of
the transcriptional repressor Bozozok [29,30]. Whether
LNX-2b in amphibians or birds, or LNX2 in mammals,
has a similar function is unclear, since there does not
appear to be a clear Bozozok homolog in these lineages.
Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the original LNX1/2
protein shared a common ancestor with MUPP1 and
INADL/PATJ - proteins that are found at tight junctions
in epithelial cells [41,52]. LNX1 has been shown to
interact with the cell junction associated proteins JAM4,
claudin-1 and CAR and shares the latter two interactions with MUPP1 [14-16]. Taken together these observations, along with the evolution of the ancestral LNX1/
2 gene in early multicellular metazoans, support a possible function for LNX1/2 at cell-cell junctions. While

Page 9 of 14

endogenous LNX1 and LNX2 have not been localized to
cell junctions, roles for LNX1 in the modulation of cell
junctions have been suggested from studies using exogenously expressed proteins [16,20]. It is possible that
low expression levels and a transient association with
cell junction proteins might preclude the detection of
endogenous LNX proteins at these structures. Interestingly, endogenous LNX2 and MUPP1 have been localized to the acrosomal region of mammalian
spermatozoa where CAR is also found [21,53]. This is
suggestive of related functions for LNX2 and MUPP1 in
this context.
In addition to common interactions with claudin-1
and CAR, we have identified two known MUPP1
ligands, TAPP1 and SynGAP1 as novel interaction partners for LNX1and/or LNX2. Furthermore, we have confirmed a common interaction of MUPP1 and LNX1/
LNX2 with EphA7. Full length LNX2 shows convincing
interactions with EphA7 and SynGAP, while full length
LNX1 interacts with EphA7. By contrast strong evidence
for interactions of TAPP1 and SynGAP with LNX1 is
only observed using the carboxy-terminal truncated
RING-PDZ2 construct. This may be because PDZ1 of
LNX1 can bind its own carboxy-terminus, thereby preventing other proteins from binding efficiently to this
domain [1]. While LNX2 is also thought to bind its own
C terminus in the same way as LNX1 [1], it may be that
in the case of LNX2 the affinity of this interaction is
lower than the affinity for SynGAP1 and TAPP1. The
binding of LNX1/LNX2 to their own carboxy-termini
might serve to regulate their interactions with such
ligands.
TAPP1 is a phosphatidylinositol (3,4) bisphosphate
binding protein that appears to function as a negative
regulator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling [54].
SynGAP1 is a synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein
that regulates synapse development and synaptic plasticity [55,56]. EphA7 functions in axon guidance and in
the regulation of apoptosis in neural progenitors [57,58].
Confirmation and further investigation of these interactions may reveal novel roles for LNX1 and LNX2 in cell
signaling and nervous system development. Overall, an
appreciation of the phylogenetic relationship between
the PDZ domains of LNX1/2 and MUPP1/INADL/PATJ
will be important in elucidating the cellular functions of
both of these poorly understood protein families.
Our model for the evolution of the LNX family indicates that an invertebrate LNX3/4 ortholog arose from
the ancestral LNX1/2-like protein through loss of two
PDZ domains. The most basal species with a LNX3/4
ortholog is the placozoan T. adhaerens. This protein,
which has a RING and one PDZ domain, may represent
an intermediate step in the evolution of LNX3/4. If this
is the case, then the ancestral LNX1/2 would, in fact,

Flynn et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:235
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/235

have lost three PDZ domains and the single remaining
PDZ domain might have duplicated to generate the two
PDZ domains found in other LNX3/4 orthologs. Supporting this idea, an analysis of splicing junctions shows
that both PDZ domains in LNX3 and in LNX4 and the
single domain in LNX5 have a splice site at the same
position as PDZ1 of LNX1/2 (Additional File 1). However, the relationships between these domains in a phylogenetic tree of all PDZ domains don’t agree with this
hypothesis (Additional File 3). Therefore, it seems
equally possible that the ancestral LNX3/4 gene originally encoded two PDZ domains, one of which was subsequently lost in T. adhaerens. The T. adhaerens
protein also lacks the LNX3H domain or any significant
homology to other LNX3/4 orthologs in the region carboxy-terminal to the PDZ domains. Again this may
represent an intermediate step in which a non modular
sequence replaced some of the four LNX1/2 PDZ
domains prior to the evolution of the LNX3H domain
and other conserved regions.
During evolution rearrangements of existing protein
domains give rise to novel domain combinations and
architectures that facilitate functional diversification of
proteins without the need to invent new protein modules [59]. Increased rates of domain rearrangements and
the appearance of novel domain combinations are associated with major lineage diversification events, particularly the emergence of metazoans [60,61]. In addition,
diversity of domains architectures increases with organismal complexity [61]. The evolution of the LNX
family through the combination of RING and PDZ
domains appears to be a part of this metazoan diversification of domain architectures. The addition of domains
involved in binding to those with catalytic activity via
fusion events has been noted to occur with a high frequency during domain rearrangements [62]. Thus a role
for the LNX PDZ domains in targeting/modulating the
ubiquitin ligase activity of a RING domain would be in
keeping with a larger evolutionary trend. Our observation that a unique fusion event likely gave rise to the
RING-PDZn architecture is in keeping with the prevalence of fusion events during domain rearrangements,
and the findings that domain additions occur most frequently at the ends of proteins and that most domain
architectures have a single evolutionary origin
[59,62-65]. However, the evolution of the reversed
(PDZ-RING) domain arrangement in arthropods does
seem to have occurred independently. While in principal
this domain order could arise through circular permutation of the LNX architecture, such events are relatively
rare [66,67], and the PDZ and RING domains in arthropod PDZ-RING proteins are not closely related to those
in the LNX family arguing against this possibility. Our
model of LNX protein evolution proposes that

Page 10 of 14

duplication of a LNX1/2-like (RING-PDZ 4 ) ancestor
gave rise to a LNX3/4-like (RING-PDZ2 ) protein. We
cannot be certain of the evolutionary mechanisms
underlying the loss of the two C-terminal PDZ domains
and appearance of the LNX3H domain and other conserved region in LNX3/4/5. A duplication-degeneration
mechanism [68] followed by de novo evolution of the
putative LNX3H domain is one possibility, but a fusion
event that inserted the LNX3 homology-encoding region
from an existing gene into the ancestral LNX gene is
also plausible. Sequencing of LNX homologs from additional basal metazoan lineages may resolve these
possibilities.
Apart from T. adhaerens, all invertebrate and vertebrate LNX3/4 orthologs contain the highly conserved
carboxy-terminal region of 150 amino acids that we
define here as the LNX3H domain. A previous comparison of LNX3 and the D. melanogaster LNX3/4-like protein Slip1 had identified two conserved regions apart
from the PDZ domains [2]. By analyzing a more diverse
set of invertebrate species, we find that only one of
these, the LNX3H domain located at the carboxy-terminal, is widely conserved. Furthermore, Slip1 is truncated
relative to all other LNX3/4-like sequences examined,
including those in a variety of other arthropods. The D.
melanogaster sequence is thus anomalous and the
region of highly conserved sequence in LNX3/4-like
proteins is about 60 amino acids longer than previously
described. Secondary structure prediction for the
LNX3H region indicates a high helical content, while an
examination of amino acid composition reveals a very
high proportion of charged amino acids, especially positively charged lysines and arginines (25%). These observations are consistent with this region folding as a
globular domain, but biophysical and structural
approaches must now be applied to determine this
definitively.
Cnidarians make up the most basal lineage that have
the LNX3H domain, and representative organisms in all
bilaterian lineages examined encode a protein in which
this domain is present. The basic LNX3/4 domain architecture seen in cnidaria has been maintained in vertebrates, yet in many invertebrate lineages, the RING and
in some cases the PDZ domains have been lost. The
LNX3H domain is thus more conserved across diverse
invertebrate lineages than the RING and PDZ domains.
Some species such as C. elegans have a protein that contains the LNX3H domain in the absence of any other
recognizable domains. Together, these observations suggest that the LNX3H domain has functions that are
independent of the RING and PDZ domains and that
may be more important than the functions of the other
domains, at least in invertebrates. To date, however, the
function of the LNX3H domain in any species is

Flynn et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:235
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/235

completely unclear. Since the LNX3H domain is conserved in LNX5, its presence in a protein may be a better way of defining the LNX3/4/5 subfamily than the
presence of both a RING and PDZ domain.

Conclusions
This study represents the first, thorough examination of
the molecular evolution of the LNX gene family. Based
on our findings an exploration of common interactions
and cellular functions of LNX1/2 and MUPP1 is merited. Structural and functional characterization of the
LNX3H domain should also provide insights into the
LNX3/4/5 subfamily. Our analysis thus provides a useful
framework for the further characterization of the enigmatic LNX proteins.
Methods
Retrieval and validation of sequences for LNX orthologs

Several approaches were used to retrieve a comprehensive set of both vertebrate and invertebrate LNX protein
sequences. Initially, a search was carried out within the
NCBI Protein Database using the following keywords as
a query; “Ligand of numb protein X 1”, “Ligand of
numb protein X 2”, “Ligand of numb protein X 3”,
“Ligand of numb protein X 4”, “LNX1”, “LNX2”,
“LNX3”, “LNX4”, “PDZRN3”, “PDZRN4”, “PDZD4”,
“SEMACAP3” and “Semaphorin cytoplasmic domainassociated protein 3”. Sequences were retrieved and
each of these sequences was used to query the NCBI
Protein Database using BLASTp [69] to identify closely
related sequences.
To complement the above approach the Conserved
Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART) was also
used [70]. A list of all sequences which contain both a
RING and PDZ domain was generated. This list was
searched for sequences that were not found during the
Entrez and BLAST searches. Finally to retrieve
sequences that may not be fully or correctly annotated,
translated BLAST (tBLASTN) searches were performed
against any assembled RefSeq genome sequences for
which LNX orthologs had not been found using the previous approaches. The number of sequences retrieved
using each of these approaches were as follows: keyword
queries - 62 sequences, pBlast - 18 sequences, CDART
-13 sequences, tBLASTN - 159 sequences. The LNX1/2
sequence from A. queenslandica was initially obtained
from Sakarya et al., who assembled sequences of proteins containing PDZ domains from EST and genomic
trace data [32]. The protein sequences were downloaded
from the supplemental material accompanying this
paper and scrutinised to identify LNX homologs. In the
latest version of the A. queenslandica genome the
LNX1/2 sequence is identified as transcript
Aqu1.226425 http://www.metazome.net/amphimedon.

Page 11 of 14

tBLASTN searches of this draft sequence did not reveal
any LNX3/4 ortholog.
Alignments of all retrieved seqeuences were generated
using ClustalX and visually inspected to verify that
sequences were indeed LNX homologs and to distinguish which LNX protein each sequence represented, as
many automatically generated annotations were incorrect. Domain architectures for all identified LNX homologs were determined using SMART [71]. The number
of PDZ domains and presence or absence of the RING
domain was noted for each sequence. Accession numbers of LNX homologs identified or referred to in this
study are provided as supplemental material online
(Additional file 6).
Alignment and generation of phylogenetic trees for
individual PDZ domains

Sequences of all human PDZ (PF00595) domains were
retrieved from the Pfam database [72]. Duplicate
sequences resulting from multiple isoforms of the same
protein were removed. An alignment for all human PDZ
domains was generated using MUSCLE [73,74]. A phylogenetic tree for all human PDZ domains was generated using the maximum likelihood method in PhyML
[75]. The Jones-Taylor -Thornton substitution model
was used [76].
A phylogenetic tree for LNX2 and MUPP1 PDZ
domains from vertebrate and early metazoan was generated as follows. An alignment of the Homo sapiens, Mus
musculus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus tropicalis and Danio
rerio LNX2 sequences was generated using MUSCLE
[73,74]. A consensus LNX2 sequence for vertebrates was
derived from this alginment using Jalview [77]).
Sequences of individual PDZ domains were then
extracted from the vertebrate consensus sequence as
well as from A. queenslandica LNX2 and H. sapiens and
T. adhaerens MUPP1. Domain boundries were identified
by searching against the PFAM database. An alignment
of the extracted PDZ domains was first generated in
MUSCLE [73,74]. Phylogeny was inferred using the
Neighbour Joining method in MEGA4 [78,79]. 1000
bootstrap samples were chosen and the Jones-TaylorThronton substitution model was used [76]. The evolutionary distances are in the units of the number of
amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the
dataset. There were a total of 69 positions in the final
dataset. Graphical rendering of phylogenetic trees was
performed using FigTree [80].
Sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction for
LNX3/4/5-like proteins

M. musculus LNX3, LNX4, LNX5 and various invertebrate LNX3 and LNX3-like orthologs were aligned using

Flynn et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:235
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/235

ClustalX [81]. To identify protein domains within these
orthologs, both full length protein sequences as well as
the conserved carboxy terminal LNX3H regions alone,
were used to search the Pfam, SMART and InterPro
databases [34-36]. Searches of Pfam domains were performed using an E-value cutoff of 1 and did not retrieve
any significant matches in either the Pfam A or B databases for the regions carboxy terminal to the PDZ
domains in LNX3/4/5 orthologs. Even raising the Evalue threshold did not identify any Pfam domains in
these regions. Searches of the SMART and InterPro
databases were performed using default parameters and
likewise did not identify domains in the carboxy terminal regions of LNX3/4/5 orthologs. To determine if the
conserved carboxy terminal regions of LNX3/4/5 were
identified as potential domains using automated domain
detection methods, searches of the ProDom and ADDA
database was performed. M. musculus LNX3 was used
as input sequence. For ProDom searches the blastp and
multiple alignment options and an expect value of 0.01
were selected. The ADDA database was searched using
default parameters.
Secondary structure analysis for the LNX3H region of
M. musculus LNX3 was performed using the Jpred3 secondary structure prediction server [39]. Secondary structure prediction was performed using the last 160 amino
acids of the multiple sequence alignment described
above. A second prediction performed using just LNX3
as an input sequence and an alignment generated by the
Jpred server gave very similar results. The secondary
structure prediction was manually plotted onto the multiple sequence alignment in Adobe Illustrator.
Yeast two-hybrid protein interaction analysis

Oligonucleotides coding for the carboxy-terminal ten
amino acids of murine HTR2C, TAPP1, SynGAP1 and
EphA7 were cloned into the pLex bait vector [82].
cDNAs sequences encoding murine MUPP1 (amino
acids 1600-2058), LNX1 (amino acids 132-728 or amino
acids 1-491), LNX2 (amino acids 1-687), Nos1 (amino
acids 2-100), rat Dlg2 (amino acids 1-851) and human
ERBB2IP (amino acids 1254-1371) were amplified by
polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pGAD10
prey vector (Clontech). Bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40
reporter strain and grown on selection agar plates lacking leucine and tryptophan to select for plasmids. His3reporter gene activation was monitored by restreaking
multiple colonies onto plates that also lacked histidine.
Filter assays for b galactosidase activity were performed
as described in the Clontech manual, using X-gal (5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside) as
color substrate. Briefly, yeast cells were transferred to
nylon membranes (GE Healthcare) and frozen twice in

Page 12 of 14

liquid nitrogen to lyse cells. The membrane was then
placed on a filter paper soaked in Z buffer (130 mM
Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM
MgSO47H20, 0.001% b mercaptoethanol, 0.85 mg/ml Xgal) and incubated for 6-12 hours at 37°C.
