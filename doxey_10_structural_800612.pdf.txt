Structural motif screening reveals a novel,
conserved carbohydrate-binding surface in the
pathogenesis-related protein PR-5d
Andrew C Doxey1,2, Zhenyu Cheng1, Barbara A Moffatt1, Brendan J McConkey1*

Abstract
Background: Aromatic amino acids play a critical role in protein-glycan interactions. Clusters of surface aromatic
residues and their features may therefore be useful in distinguishing glycan-binding sites as well as predicting
novel glycan-binding proteins. In this work, a structural bioinformatics approach was used to screen the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) for coplanar aromatic motifs similar to those found in known glycan-binding proteins.
Results: The proteins identified in the screen were significantly associated with carbohydrate-related functions
according to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, and predicted motifs were found frequently within novel
folds and glycan-binding sites not included in the training set. In addition to numerous binding sites predicted in
structural genomics proteins of unknown function, one novel prediction was a surface motif (W34/W36/W192) in
the tobacco pathogenesis-related protein, PR-5d. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the surface motif is exclusive
to a subfamily of PR-5 proteins from the Solanaceae family of plants, and is absent completely in more distant
homologs. To confirm PR-5d’s insoluble-polysaccharide binding activity, a cellulose-pulldown assay of tobacco
proteins was performed and PR-5d was identified in the cellulose-binding fraction by mass spectrometry.
Conclusions: Based on the combined results, we propose that the putative binding site in PR-5d may be an
evolutionary adaptation of Solanaceae plants including potato, tomato, and tobacco, towards defense against
cellulose-containing pathogens such as species of the deadly oomycete genus, Phytophthora. More generally, the
results demonstrate that coplanar aromatic clusters on protein surfaces are a structural signature of glycan-binding
proteins, and can be used to computationally predict novel glycan-binding proteins from 3 D structure.

Background
Carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBPs) are highly diverse
in terms of their sequences, structures, binding sites,
and evolutionary histories [1]. Sequence-based classifications (e.g., as used in the CAZy database [2]) are an
attempt to organize this diversity, and do so by grouping
CBPs into evolutionarily related families and subfamilies.
Many of these families have a common function and
mechanism, while in others functions have diversified
[2]. Prediction of novel CBPs with unique binding sites
and mechanisms that are unrelated to known cases is a
more difficult task, as there is no single sequence profile
or pattern that defines a carbohydrate-binding site.

Thus, while sequence-based carbohydrate-binding site
prediction methods have been shown to be moderately
successful, structural information will be key to achieve
higher prediction accuracies [3].
Structure-based algorithms are a promising approach
for prediction and analysis of binding sites in proteins
from first principles. Just as sequence profiles and patterns can be used to infer function in uncharacterized
sequences, the existence of specific structural patterns
in incompletely characterized structures may provide
clues into their functions [4,5]. As binding site residues
and other functional motifs may be close in 3 D space
but be non-contiguous in the amino acid sequence,
structural patterns are inherently better at representing
proteins functions than primary sequence alone. A number of structure-based approaches have been applied to
carbohydrate-binding site prediction, and have achieved

reasonable prediction accuracy [6-8]. However, even
using structural information, not all carbohydrate-binding sites can be correctly predicted (e.g., false negative
rates are roughly 30%). Structure-based prediction of
CBPs with novel folds and binding sites has also not
been performed and validated experimentally. Given
their enormous potential in biotechnological applications [9], computational prediction of novel CBPs is a
worthwhile goal.
It is unlikely that general feature-detection approaches
will be able to identify all types of carbohydrate-binding
sites. Carbohydrate ligands are diverse in size, geometry
and other physicochemical characteristics [2], and this
diversity is mirrored in the features of carbohydratebinding sites in proteins. A few recent studies have
developed more targeted approaches that apply structure-based methods to specific classes of CBPs [10,11].
At a cost of lower generality, approaches that focus on
structural motifs of particular functional classes of CBPs
may achieve predictions with better ligand specificities
and greater overall accuracies.
A useful structural and functional classification of
CBPs is described by Boraston et al. [1]. Carbohydratebinding modules (CBMs) were divided into three main
types (type A, B and C) based on their structural and
functional characteristics, where members of each class
are not necessarily related and do not share a common
sequence pattern. Type A CBMs, which bind insoluble
carbohydrates, possess a unique structural signature of
three surface aromatic residues whose side-chains are
arranged in a coplanar orientation to dock to a crystalline carbohydrate surface. In the binding sites of type B
(glycan-chain binding) CBMs, there are typically two
coplanar aromatic residues which form a “sandwich” or
“clamp” around the glycan ligand. Through hydrophobic
stacking (CH-Π) interactions [12,13], aromatic sidechains of Type A and B CBMs bind to their respective
glycan ligands, which are polysaccharides or oligosaccharides. Smaller monosaccharides, however, are the targets of type C CBMs, which do not necessarily possess
coplanar aromatic motifs. The use of aromatic motifs as
structural signatures of CBPs is consistent with computational and experimental analyses of carbohydrate-binding sites. Malik et al. [3], who scored amino acid
propensities in known carbohydrate-binding sites, found
that Trp is extremely overrepresented (331%). Mutations
of aromatic residues such as Trp have also been shown
to significantly decrease carbohydrate-binding activities
[14-17]. Ultimately, these studies indicate that Trp and
Tyr are highly prevalent in carbohydrate-binding sites,
while Phe and His are found less frequently. The abundance of Trp is partially due to it having the largest surface area of all amino acids for potential hydrophobic
interactions. The relative abundance of Tyr over Phe is

Page 2 of 12

explained by the ability of Tyr to form additional
H-bonds and electrostatic interactions because of its
hydroxyl group. Thus, even within aromatic residues,
subtle sidechain differences have the potential to affect
carbohydrate-recognition.
While binding sites like those found in type C CBMs
may be more structurally diverse and thus harder to
identify using a structural signature, aromatic motifs
found in type A and B CBM binding have the potential
to be used as 3 D motifs in structural database screening to identify novel carbohydrate-binding sites [10]. In
this work, we expand on a previous 3D-motif approach
[10] to perform a comprehensive PDB-wide screen for
coplanar aromatic surface motifs. The primary goal is to
determine whether such motifs are significantly enriched
in carbohydrate-related proteins and can be used to
identify novel CBPs and binding sites not found in existing CBP families. A novel prediction (pathogenesisrelated protein, PR-5d) is then analyzed computationally
and tested experimentally.
PR-5d refers to the tobacco pathogenesis-related protein, which is a member of the larger PR-5 family,
including the proteins thaumatin and osmotin. Anti-fungal activity has been demonstrated for PR-5d [18] and
related PR-5 proteins [19,20], but the structural basis of
this activity is still unclear. Membrane pore-formation
has been suggested as one possible anti-fungal mechanism [18]. Carbohydrate-binding and hydrolytic functions
have also been observed for a number of PR-5 proteins
(e.g., ß-1, 3-glucan interactions in thaumatin-like proteins [21,22]). Carbohydrate interactions are consistent
with structural modelling studies of PR-5 proteins,
which have demonstrated that PR-5 proteins contain
highly acidic clefts suitable for carbohydrate hydrolytic
function [22,23]. This suggests that the mechanism may
involve interactions between PR- 5 proteins and pathogen cell wall carbohydrates. The PR-5d surface motif
predicted in this study is therefore of particular interest
because pathogen-specific insoluble-carbohydrate binding may represent a previously unknown mechanism by
which PR-5d acts on specific pathogens of tobacco and
related species. Furthermore, the results of this work
highlight a critical surface region on which subtle mutations may underlie important functional novelties in the
PR-5 family. In a broader sense, this study highlights the
potential of structural motif screening approaches to
predict novel functions using large-scale structural data.

aromatic motifs occurring in structures of known glycanbinding proteins. Positive cases used in training included
26 pairs of glycan-binding aromatic residues in known
type A and B CBM binding sites from 18 different structures (Figure 1). Negative cases used in training included
140,383 random pairs from the Nh3d reference dataset
[24], further filtered to 7,830 pairs by selecting only those
whose features were no worse than the worst-case values
found in the positive cases (see thresholding section in
Methods). This conservative approach is intended to
identify and separate putative carbohydrate binding

surfaces.
Based on coplanarity of aromatic sidechains, solvent
accessibility, residue type, and distance, LDA was able to
effectively separate the two classes based on the input
features (Figure 2). Twenty out of 26 (77%) of the positive cases scored greater than 95% of background scores,
and 24 out of 26 (92%) scored greater than 90% of the
background scores.

Figure 2 LDA-based discrimination of selected aromatic pair motifs in known type A and B CBMs, and reference aromatic pairs from
the Nh3d dataset passing the initial thresholds. Four features (distance, ASA, coplanarity, and residue type) were used in the discrimination.
Parameter means and LDA statistics are listed on the right.

signs of each coefficient are as expected; the distance
parameter is negative indicating a preference for aromatic
pairs in closer proximity; solvent accessibility (asaavg) is
positive indicating a preference for greater surface exposure; and theta is negative indicating that lower angles
(higher coplanarity) is preferred. The residue-type parameter resscore was the strongest discriminating variable
between aromatic motifs found in glycan-binding sites
and random, aromatic surface motifs.
PDB screening reveals a significant association between
aromatic surface motifs and carbohydrate related
functions

After parameter fitting, the algorithm was applied to
15,970 non-redundant structures from the nrPDB dataset, with an initial 229,919 aromatic pairs from 15,047
different structures that passed the parameter thresholds. These were screened for pairs that received a raw
LDA score greater than the 99th percentile score
(~3.40) of all sites analyzed in the initial training set.
This resulted in 1,304 high-scoring aromatic pairs from
a total of 994 unique structures.
To determine whether the proteins identified by
screening are enriched in carbohydrate-related functions, GO terms for all structures were retrieved using
the GOA database [25], and GO terms for proteins
identified in the screen (which excluded structures from
the training set) were assessed for statistical enrichment
using the binomial test (see Methods). Out of 501 total
GO associations for proteins in the set of 994 structures
identified in the screen, 14 significantly enriched GO
terms were detected according to the binomial test with
a false-discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple
testing [26] and conservative FDR cutoff of 0.05 (Table
1). Nine of these are associated with carbohydrate-

related functions (Table 1). For example, out of 380
structures in the nrPDB annotated with GO: 0005975
(“carbohydrate metabolic process”), 95 of these were
identified in the screen. Thus, a quarter of the structures
with this annotation contain an aromatic pair motif that
scores higher than the 99th percentile. Of 48 structures
in the nrPDB that contain the term GO: 0030246 (carbohydrate-binding), 17 of these were identified. This is
equivalent to a four-fold enrichment (p ~ 1.57e-29), and
over five-fold enrichment (p ~ 1.9e-08) in carbohydrate
metabolism and binding functions, respectively. When
the screening threshold score is lowered, a larger proportion of structures from these GO categories are identified, but at the expense of more false positives. For
example, 40, 31, and 24 of the 48 carbohydrate-binding
structures were identified when searching for motifs
scoring greater than the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentile
scores, respectively. This demonstrates that many carbohydrate-binding proteins not identified in the top 99th
percentile screen also possess similar aromatic motifs
that are simply lower-scoring.
For some apparently enriched terms not directly
related to carbohydrate-binding (e.g., ‘cation-binding’),
these terms are commonly linked with carbohydraterelated enzymes and thus exhibit significant enrichment
in the dataset. For example, 1LWJ (T. Maritima 4alpha-glucanotransferase/acarbose complex), is tagged
with GO: 0005975 (carbohydrate metabolic process) as
well as GO: 0003824 (catalytic activity), and GO:
0043169 (cation binding). All three of these terms
showed significant enrichment (Table 1).

training set are shown in Figure 3 (top panel). In the
selected structures, predicted aromatic motifs with raw
LDA scores > 99 th percentile have been highlighted
along with their corresponding bound glycan. Each predicted binding site and most of the folds are unique,
and the aromatic motifs have in these cases have arisen
independently through convergent evolution.
Also shown are 17 predicted aromatic-motif binding
sites occurring in structural genomics proteins whose
functions are incompletely characterized or unknown
(Figure 3, bottom panel). While carbohydrates/glycans
are likely targets of the predicted motifs, they may also
be binding sites for other ligands (e.g., some nucleotidebinding sites also consist of an aromatic sandwich
motif).
The detected motifs are similar to those found in type
A and B CBMs, and are predominantly Trp-rich coplanar strip or sandwich motifs. All examples shown in
Figure 3 contain Trp/Trp motifs, as this was the most
highly scored residue combination and thus occurs most
frequently in the top percentile of scoring. All of the
structural genomics proteins shown have different folds
from the structures in the training set, with one exception. PDB ID 3hnm (a domain from a putative
chitobiase) structurally aligned well with the CBM 22
xylan-binding domain (1dyo) according to VAST (Evalue = 0.0453) [27], but has very a low sequence identity (5.2%) to this protein.
In several of these cases, sequence or structural similarities also support the possibility of carbohydrate-binding functions. PDB ID 1u9c is in the same SCOP
superfamily (’Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like’) as
A4 beta-galactosidase middle domain (PDB ID 1kwk). A
BLAST search of 2i9i detected similarity to “neuraminyllactose-binding hemagglutinin” proteins (e.g., PDB ID
3bgh). PDB ID 2b06 has a nudix fold also found in

FDR cutoff

GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase NudD (e.g., PDB ID
1rya). PDB ID 1pbj has a CBS-domain pair fold, and a
similar site in PDB ID 2rif binds AMP. Lastly, 3cbw is a
structure of beta-mannanase BsMan26A from Bacillus
subtilis [28].
The motifs shown in Figure 3 were identified using an
LDA score threshold equivalent to the 99th percentile
score. However, it is important to note that other
known and candidate carbohydrate-binding structures
had motifs scoring below this threshold. For example,
the structural genomics proteins, PDB ID 3e5z (a putative gluconolactonase; predicted residues: W29, Y135)
and PDB ID 3dsm (B. uniformis surface layer protein;
predicted residues: W117, W162, Y207, W240, Y284,
Y303) are likely to interact with carbohydrates and had
predicted binding sites scoring highly (>95% score) but
below the threshold.
A high-scoring aromatic motif on the surface of
pathogenesis-related protein, PR-5d

One of the top predictions was a surface motif in the
pathogenesis-related protein PR-5d from tobacco. The
putative binding site in PR-5d received a raw LDA score
of ~3.80 (99.6 th percentile) for the W34/W36 pair,
~3.69 (99.5th percentile) for the W36/W196 pair, and
~3.15 (98.6th percentile) for the W34/W196 pair. Thus,
the motifs in PR-5d received extremely high scores,
scoring higher than many of the glycan-binding sites
from the training set. Compared to all proteins in the
nrPDB analyzed in screening, this putative binding site
had scores greater than 99.7% of cases.
The crystal structure of tobacco PR-5d (PDB ID 1aun)
is shown in Figure 4A. The predicted binding site in
PR-5d comprises three Trp residues (W34, W36,
W196), which form a highly coplanar and accessible
surface region reminiscent of coplanar aromatic surface

motifs found in the binding sites of type A CBMs
(Figure 1). It forms a separate and distinct surface patch
from the putative active site cleft (Figure 4A).
In addition to PR-5d, only 51 other structures out of
15,970 (< 0.3%) were found to contain type A CBM-like
triplets with scores greater or equal to that of PR-5d. Such
binding sites composed of three or more coplanar aromatic
motifs were identified by grouping together pairs of highscoring coplanar aromatics that share a common residue.
Given previous associations between the hydrolytic
cleft and glycan binding [21-23], it is possible that
motifs within or near the hydrolytic cleft of PR-5d also
contribute to cellulose binding. In addition to W34/
W36/W196, a weaker scoring pair was detected near the
hydrolytic cleft (F91 and F96). This site received an
LDA score of 0.505, placing it in the 86th percentile of
all scores. Though this site and other motifs in the

hydrolytic cleft are suitable for binding glycan chains,
they do not possess the common pattern of type
A CBM binding sites, and are much less likely to be
capable of binding to a crystalline-cellulose surface.
An insoluble cellulose-pulldown assay of tobacco proteins
identifies PR-5d

The structural analysis indicates that PR-5d possesses a
significant structural signature of carbohydrate-binding
proteins, the W34/W36/W196 motif that is similar to
insoluble-carbohydrate binding motifs found in known
type A CBMs. Thus, the binding activity of PR-5d
towards insoluble cellulose was tested experimentally
using a cellulose pulldown assay of tobacco (Nicotiana
tabacam) proteins, followed by mass spectrometry. A
similar experiment performed with insoluble chitin was
also performed in a previous study, which identified a

Doxey et al. BMC Structural Biology 2010, 10:23
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/10/23

chitinase CBM but not PR-5d [10]. Tobacco plants were
first treated with salt in order to cause an ethyleneinduced stress response in order to induce PR-5d gene
expression (previously shown in Sato et al. [29]) and
obtain a larger PR-5d yield than that expected under
normal conditions. In the cellulose-pulldown assay,
tobacco protein extract was mixed with insoluble cellulose, and the mixture was washed stringently in order to
remove non-cellulose-binding proteins and purify only
proteins with strong binding activity towards insoluble
cellulose. The cellulose-binding fraction was then analyzed with SDS-PAGE, stained with both coomassie and
silver stain, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The
stringent conditions resulted in several faint bands on
the coomassie stained gel, which were more easily visualized using silver stain (Figure 4B). A band at the
expected size (~23 kDa) of PR-5d was present, which
was then excised and identified by mass spectrometry
(MS). MS analysis identified two peptides, which were
identified as the top-scoring match to the sequence of
the tobacco PR-5d protein (Figure 4B). The identification of PR-5d in the cellulose-binding fraction demonstrates that PR-5d has insoluble-cellulose-binding
activity and validates the computational prediction.
Phylogenetic analysis of the PR-5d W34/W36/W196 motif

To further support the functional importance of the cellulose-binding motif, patterns of residue conservation
across species were investigated. Close homologs of PR5d were retrieved via a BLAST search of the NCBI nr
protein database and a multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree was constructed. The predicted aromatic
motif residues and corresponding residues from other
related PR-5 proteins were then mapped onto the phylogeny in order to phylogenetically trace the origin of the
W34/W36/W196 motif in PR-5d.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PR-5d is a member
of a highly conserved clade of PR-5 proteins exclusive to
the Solanaceae family of plants including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), potato (S. tuberosum), chili pepper
(Capsicum annuum), and several species of tobacco
(N. tabacum) (Figure 5). This clade of PR-5d proteins,
extremely well supported by a bootstrap value of 98/
100, all share the W34/W36/W196 motif, which is not
present anywhere else in the phylogeny (Figure 5). The
100% conservation indicates the functional importance
of this clade-defining motif, and suggests it may be a
potential evolutionary and functional determinant of
this group of Solanaceae PR-5 proteins.
A proposed function of the Solanaceae specific PR-5d
subfamily

Solanaceae plants are common targets of the deadly
plant pathogen, Phytophthora (Greek for “plant-

Page 8 of 12

destroyer”). The clade-defining, putative binding site
towards insoluble-polysaccharides in the plant-defense
protein, PR-5d, may be an evolutionary adaptation
towards defense against Phytophthora. Unlike fungi,
which are commonly studied targets of PR-5 proteins, a
distinguishing feature of Phytophthora infestans and
other oomycetes is that they possess a cell wall containing insoluble cellulose [30,31]. Previous studies have
shown that PR-5 related proteins such as tobacco osmotin are active against Phytophthora infestans [19,32].
According to the tree, tobacco osmotin and related
osmotin-like proteins are indeed the most closely related
sequences to the PR-5d subfamily (several of these proteins are labelled in Figure 5). The occurrence of the
W34/W36/W196 motif may therefore represent a functional innovation in response to Phytophthora invasion
and infection, providing additional indirect support for
the mechanistic importance of this motif.

Conclusion
Through this work, it has been shown that key features
of surface aromatic motifs (residue type, distance, solvent-accessibility, and coplanarity) can be used to structurally distinguish known and novel glycan-binding
proteins and their binding sites from random protein
structures. This provides further support for approaches
that use physicochemical and geometric features of protein surfaces to analyze and predict specific protein
functions [33-35]. By performing a large-scale screen of
the PDB using the 3 D pattern, existing carbohydratebinding sites were correctly predicted as well as novel
motifs in structural genomics proteins of unknown
function. In addition, aromatic surface motifs were
found to be significantly associated with carbohydraterelated functions. A high-scoring prediction (PR-5d) was
studied structurally, phylogenetically and experimentally.
The combined results suggest that the W34/W36/W196
surface motif in PR-5d may function as an insolublepolysaccharide binding site that targets polysaccharides
such as cellulose in pathogen cell walls. A likely target is
the major plant pathogen, Phytophthora, which has a
cell wall made of cellulose, and which commonly infects
the Solanaceae species in which the PR-5d W34/W36/
W196 motif is present.
Methods
Structural dataset construction

Type A and B CBMs: Representative structures of six
type A CBMs and 12 type B CBMs were retrieved from
the Protein Data Bank (PDB), yielding a total of 17
diverse carbohydrate-binding structures. All structures
have distinct folds or low pairwise sequence identity
(BLASTp E-values greater than 0.01). Type A CBMs
included 1cbh (CBM1), 1exg (CBM2), 1nbc (CBM3),

subtree from a larger neighbor-joining tree of PR-5 related proteins. Bootstrap values are indicated for two key clades. The residues in alignment
positions 34, 36, and 196 (relative to the PR-5d sequence) have been mapped onto the tree, and demonstrate that the conserved putative

solved structure of a bacterial expansin with similarity
to plant beta-expansins (group 1 grass pollen allergens).
This structure also has a binding site and activity analogous to type A CBMs [36]. Type B CBMs included 2xbd
(CBM2), 1gui (CBM4), 1uxx (CBM6), 1gny (CBM15),
1j84 (CBM17), 1ac0 (CBM20), 1dyo (CBM22), 1of4
(CBM27), 1uww (CBM28), 1gwk (CBM29), 1uh2
(CBM34), and 1ux7 (CBM36). These structures were
selected based on the scheme presented in Boraston
et al. [1], a comprehensive review on CBMs.

Nh3d reference dataset: The Nh3d version 3.0 dataset
[24] was retrieved for use as the reference dataset. This
dataset contains 806 structurally dissimilar protein
chains from the PDB, and was built using the hierarchical CATH database classification. Nh3d was chosen
because it was carefully constructed to contain structurally dissimilar protein chains without recognizable common ancestry, and so it lends itself to statistical,
structural analysis. In addition, none of the proteins in
this dataset are closely related (as determined through
BLAST searches) to the sequences in the type A and B

CBM dataset. nrPDB: For the purposes of screening, a
large non-redundant database of 15,970 PDB structures
was generated by retrieving a precomputed list of structures from the PISCES server [37]. The percentage identity cutoff was 90%, the resolution cutoff was 3.0 Å, and
all R-factors were allowed. Homologs of the type A and
B CBM structures were not included in this dataset.
Structural motif analysis and screening

Aromatic residue pairs were selected within known
structures from the type A and B CBM dataset based on
previous literature and manual inspection (aromatic
pairs listed in Figure 1). For type B CBMs, one pair of
aromatic residues was used to describe a single ligandbinding site, and for type A CBMs composed of three
aromatic residues, the two pairs with the shortest interresidue distance were used. As a comparison reference
dataset containing random protein structures, the Nh3D
dataset was used. All aromatic pairs passing initial parameter thresholds (identical to those later described in
Screening) were selected, and assumed as non-bindingsites for algorithm training.
Four key features (coplanarity, residue type, solventaccessibility, and distance) were computed for all pairs
of aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr, Phe, His) and used in a
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in an attempt to discriminate the known sites from the random sites (background). LDA generated a scoring function based on a
linear combination of the input variables, that best separates the two classes of data. The linear discriminant
function can be represented as:
D i = ß1Z i1 + ß 2Z i 2 +  + ß p Z ip

Here, Zip are the values of the discriminating variables;
B p are the coefficients; and D i is the score for the i th
data point (in this case, putative binding site). We used
the raw LDA score in subsequent searches for novel
binding sites. The following features were used to train
the parameters in LDA:
Coplanarity: measured as the angle (0 to 90 degrees)
between the normal vectors of both aromatic rings).
Residue type: The score of each residue pair was set to
the frequency of the pair plus a pseudocount of 0.5
(except for Phe because Phe was not observed at all).
The scores for each residue pair were divided by the
sum of total scores, resulting in (Trp/Trp = 0.431; Trp/
Tyr = 0.293; Tyr/Tyr = 0.155; Trp/His = 0.052; His/
His = 0.017; Any/Phe = 0).
Distance: the Euclidean distance, sqrt[(x2-x1)2+(y2-y1)2
+(z2-z1)2], between the centroids [(x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,
z2)] of each aromatic ring.
Solvent accessibility: the solvent accessible surface area
(ASA) was calculated from a Voronoi tessellation [38].

Page 10 of 12

To account for differences in inherent sidechain solvent
accessibility between different aromatic residues, each
value was divided by the maximum observed in the
background dataset for that residue. The average relative
ASA value of the two aromatic sidechains was then used
as a final feature.
Screening: In the screening phase, a separate database
of 15,970 non-redundant structures (nrPDB) was
screened for potentially novel binding glycan-binding
sites and other binding-sites not included in the training
set. This involved two steps:
1) Thresholding: aromatic pairs with feature values
outside the allowed range were removed. The allowed
range was simply defined based on the minimum and/or
maximum values observed for known binding sites in
the training set (6.03 Å ≤ Distance ≤ 21.03 Å, Fractional
solvent-accessibility relative to residue type ≥ 0.21,
Coplanarity ≤ 83.55 degrees). The ASA cutoff, for
instance, removed internal aromatic residues incapable
of forming external interactions.
2) Scoring: The LDA scoring function was used to
score all remaining candidate binding sites. The score of
any aromatic pair can be compared to the “background”
distribution of scores, which reflects its potential for
being a glycan- or other type of ligand-binding site.
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis

PDB GO annotations were downloaded from the Gene
Ontology Annotation (GOA) database of the European
Bioinformatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA. For
structures identified by screening, GO term enrichment
was tested for all GO categories associated with the
identified structures. Binomial exact tests were used to
compute the probabilities P k of observing k or more
instances of a particular GO term in the screen (n =
994). Assuming that the background probability p of
observing a particular GO term is (total # occurrences/
total # structures), the probability Pk is:

∑

n

⎛n⎞ i
n −i
⎜ ⎟ p (1 − p)
i⎠

i=k ⎝

Since this test was done for all N = 501 GO terms, we
used false-discovery rates to correct for multiple statistical tests. The 501 P-values were first ranked in increasing order, and significant p-values were those for which
the raw p-value is less than (rank × alpha/N) [26]. An
FDR alpha value of 0.05 was used. The fold enrichment
(fraction of GO term observed in the screen/fraction of
GO terms in all structures) is also reported in Table 1.
Cellulose pulldown assay

Ten grams of root tissues from 3-week old tobacco plants
were ground with liquid nitrogen and homogenized with

Doxey et al. BMC Structural Biology 2010, 10:23

10 mL of extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 0.5 M
NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton-X100). The
suspension was sonicated 3 × 30 seconds with 30-second
pauses between pulses at 200-300 W. The cell lysate was
centrifuged at 10000 × g at 4°C for 10 minutes. A protein
concentration of 1 μg/μL was determined using the Bradford assay. 0.5 grams of Avicel® microcrystalline cellulose
(~1 mL) that was purified from fibrous plants (FMC Corporation, Newark, DE) was equilibrated with 10 mL of
extraction buffer. The whole 10 mL of lysate was then
mixed with the equilibrated cellulose and incubated at
4°C for 3 hours. The mixture was applied to a Poly-Prep®
chromatography column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Loosely bound proteins were removed by
washing with 30 mL (~30 column volumes) of extraction
buffer. The cellulose-binding proteins were eluted with 4
× 1 mL of 0.1% SDS, and the eluate was collected as the
cellulose-binding fraction.
The cellulose-binding fraction was separated by 12%
SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie blue G-250
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The strongest
bands were excised and digested with trypsin as previously described [39]. The peptides were extracted
from gel pieces by vortexing and dried in a SpeedVac
(Instruments Inc., Hicksville, NY). The peptides were
resuspended in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid.
Mass spectrometry was performed on an Applied Biosystems Q-TRAP system. Peak lists were generated and
processed using Analyst software version 1.4.1 (Applied
Biosystems). The protein was identified using PEAKS
version 4.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo,
ON). The parental and fragment mass error are 0.2 Da
and 0.1 Da, respectively. Fragments were predicted
based on digestion with trypsin (one missed cleavage
site allowed) and carbamidomethylation and methionine
oxidation as fixed and variable modifications,
respectively.
As the Coomassie gel produced faint bands, a second
SDS-PAGE gel was prepared and silver stained. The silver staining procedure was followed by the instruction
of the PlusOne Protein Silver Staining Kit from GE
Healthcare (cat # 17-1150-01).
Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of PR-5d

A BLAST search of tobacco PR-5d (PDB ID 1aun) was
used to identify related sequences. All sequences with E
< 0.001 that aligned to the query with sequence coverage > 90% were used to build a second alignment using
MUSCLE [40]. Conserved regions of the alignment were
used to generate a midpoint-rooted neighbor-joining
tree using Seaview [41]. A major clade of PR-5d proteins
containing the PR-5d subclade was then selected for
further analysis.
