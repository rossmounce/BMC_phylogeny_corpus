Abstract
Background: Transgressive segregation describes the occurrence of novel phenotypes in hybrids
with extreme trait values not observed in either parental species. A previously experimentally
untested prediction is that the amount of transgression increases with the genetic distance between
hybridizing species. This follows from QTL studies suggesting that transgression is most commonly
due to complementary gene action or epistasis, which become more frequent at larger genetic
distances. This is because the number of QTLs fixed for alleles with opposing signs in different
species should increase with time since speciation provided that speciation is not driven by
disruptive selection. We measured the amount of transgression occurring in hybrids of cichlid fish
bred from species pairs with gradually increasing genetic distances and varying phenotypic
similarity. Transgression in multi-trait shape phenotypes was quantified using landmark-based
geometric morphometric methods.
Results: We found that genetic distance explained 52% and 78% of the variation in transgression
frequency in F1 and F2 hybrids, respectively. Confirming theoretical predictions, transgression
when measured in F2 hybrids, increased linearly with genetic distance between hybridizing species.
Phenotypic similarity of species on the other hand was not related to the amount of transgression.
Conclusion: The commonness and ease with which novel phenotypes are produced in cichlid
hybrids between unrelated species has important implications for the interaction of hybridization
with adaptation and speciation. Hybridization may generate new genotypes with adaptive potential
that did not reside as standing genetic variation in either parental population, potentially enhancing
a population's responsiveness to selection. Our results make it conceivable that hybridization
contributed to the rapid rates of phenotypic evolution in the large and rapid adaptive radiations of
haplochromine cichlids.

Background
Interspecific hybridization as an evolutionary force has a
mixed chronicle in the literature. Despite important early
work [1-6], the image of hybridization in evolutionary literature has only recently changed from that of a predominantly destructive force to a more balanced view, giving
due credit to hybridization as a potential catalyst of phenotypic evolution and indeed diversification. Not only
have cases of hybrid speciation been demonstrated conclusively both in plants and animals [7-11], but hybridization is now implicated in the generation of whole
adaptive radiations in plants [12,13], animals [14-16] and
prokaryotes [17] (reviewed in [18,19]). Besides the general surge of genetic variation ensuing from the admixture
of divergent genomes [20], and the acquisition of specific
adaptive traits through lateral gene transfer [17,21] and
introgression [22-24], another potential outcome of
hybridization that may facilitate adaptive diversification
into new directions is the occurrence of qualitatively or
quantitatively novel phenotypes referred to as transgressive segregation. Transgression describes the phenomenon that segregation variance in hybrid offspring can
result in phenotypes with extreme trait values exceeding
the range of parental trait values in either the positive or
negative direction [25,26]. Agricultural breeding programs have long benefited from transgressive phenotypes
as a means to improve cultivars but studying the adaptive
potential of transgression in evolutionary research is only
a recent development. Transgression can in principle
affect any quantitative trait and has been demonstrated
for morphological traits (skull morphology of cichlid fish:
[27]), physiological traits (salt tolerance in Helianthus
sunflowers: [28]), life history traits (flowering time in Arabidopsis: [29]), and behavioural traits (mating behaviour
of Drosophila: [30]). For instance, Parnell et al. [31]
recently described a mechanism whereby hybridizing
cichlid species with different morphologies but similar
functions are likely to produce functionally transgressive
progeny.
Previous work on the genetic basis of transgression indicates that it is most often caused by the action of complementary genes between QTL loci that carry alleles of
opposite signs in the parents but sum up to larger or
smaller trait values compared to the parents when combined in a hybrid genome [22,29,32-39]. One interesting
prediction emerging from this, especially put forward by
Rieseberg et al. [25], is that the amount of transgression
should increase as a function of the genetic distance
between the parental lines. This is because the number of
loci for which the parents have fixed alleles with opposite
effects should increase with time since isolation during
the divergence of species, which would thus result more
frequently in complementary gene action.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/283

Besides genetic distance, transgression is predicted to also
be affected by the phenotypic similarity of the parents
[25]. Transgression and phenotypic differentiation have
been suggested to be inversely correlated such that phenotypically similar species produce more transgressive
hybrid offspring than phenotypically dissimilar parents
[22,33,36,40]. This is because large phenotypic differences between two species may often result from divergent directional selection, a process expected to eventually
lead to the fixation of alleles with the same sign across all
QTL within a species, and mostly opposite signs between
the species. This would produce F1 offspring heterozygous at most of these loci. Although some F2 progeny
may then have QTL combinations that could exhibit complementary gene action, this will unlikely produce transgressive trait values. In other words, during evolution
under divergent selection, opportunity for transgression
decreases due to a loss of the required kind of genetic variation. Conversely, if the parents show rather similar phenotypes, despite considerable genetic distance, this
indicates the action of stabilizing selection. The genetic
basis for transgression is then more likely given because
stabilizing selection leads to alternating fixation of alleles
with negative and positive trait values, and the sequence
of fixation of alleles with either sign at different QTLs will
by chance be different between isolated populations. In
agreement with this prediction, a study on transgression
in hybrids between two cichlid fish species revealed novel
phenotypes only in traits with a selection history other
than consistent directional selection [27]. To the extent
that phenotypic and genetic divergence between species
are correlated, the effects of phenotypic differentiation
can potentially confound or cancel out the predicted relationship between genetic distance and transgression
[25,40].
Despite the knowledge of the genetic basis of transgression, tests on the effects of genetic and phenotypic distance on transgressive segregation remain inconclusive
[41-43], mostly because the few existing studies covered
only small or unknown ranges of genetic distance and
were not designed to test the two predictions introduced
above. Only recently, a comparative study [40] using data
on plant and animal hybrids found evidence that distantly related species more often produce hybrids with
extreme trait values than closely related species.
Here, we produced seven interspecific crosses using African haplochromine cichlid fish covering a wide range of
pairwise genetic distances and phenotypic distances. We
set out to test 1) if transgression occurred in F1 and F2
hybrids, 2) if the amount of transgression was predictable
from genetic distance between the parental species, and 3)
if transgression was predictable from the phenotypic differentiation between the parental species. We raised F1

hybrids, F2 hybrids, and the corresponding homospecific
control crosses until sexual maturity under controlled laboratory conditions. The amount of transgressive segregation per cross type was quantified using landmark-based
geometric morphometric methods and a thin-plate spline
procedure. Genetic distances between parental species
were estimated using mitochondrial D-loop sequences
from GenBank and three different molecular clocks were
applied to convert distances into absolute divergence
time. Multi-trait phenotypic distances between the parental species were estimated using Mahalanobis distances
calculated from geometric morphometric data.

Results
Transgressive segregation in hybrids
Thirty F1 hybrid families from seven different cross types
and three families of each of the nine homospecific
crosses were obtained (see Table 1 for number of families
and number of individuals per cross type). Transgressive
phenotypes were found in all hybrid cross types (Additional file 1) albeit not in every family (Table 2). On average, F1 hybrids exceeded the phenotypic range of the
parental species by 14% Â± 13% (Â± standard deviation).
This average was calculated across all cross types and
across all axes of shape variation, weighted by the percent
variance each axis explained.

Forty-one F2 hybrid families from six different cross types
were obtained (Table 1). Transgression was observed in

all cross types (Figure 1) albeit not in every family (Table
2). F2 hybrids exceeded the phenotypic range of the
parental species on average by 21% Â± 12%. The amount of
transgression and variance explained by each PC axis for
both F1 and F2 hybrids is shown in detail in Additional
file 2.
In all F1 and F2 hybrid cross types, there were significant
differences between families in the distribution of phenotypes in morphospace. MANOVAs with family as factor
and all relevant PCs as response variables suggested that
within each cross type, at least one hybrid family was significantly different from another family along at least one
axis of shape variation (all test results including the
number of PCs used per MANOVA are shown in Additional file 3). However, transgression analysis revealed
that on average 75% of all F1 families (2-5 families per
cross type) and 84% of all F2 families (3-7 families per
cross type) contained transgressive phenotypes demonstrating that transgressive segregation was not caused by
single-family effects (Table 2).
Transgressive segregation as a function of genetic distance
Uncorrected pairwise p-distances between species pairs,
calculated from D-loop sequences, ranged from 0.007 to
0.055. Depending on the molecular clock used, this translates into a range of absolute time since speciation from
several thousand years to 2.7/3.8/7.4 million years (internal/fossil record/Gondwana fragmentation calibration;

The total amount of transgression (Ttotal) occurring on the major axes of phenotypic shape variation is shown separately for F1 and F2 hybrids. Also reported is the proportion of transgressive
families obtained per cross type (i.e. the number of families containing transgressive phenotypes divided by the total number of families of that cross type).
1Note that these distance estimates are likely overestimates of genetic distance between species. Distances are based on sequence differences between mitochondrial D-loop haplotypes, but
these species have highly incomplete haplotype lineage sorting. Hence any distance obtained from a small sample of sequences is likely to overestimate species distance

Results 1
Results of principal component analyses using geometric morphometrics data to quantify the amount of transgression in shape of interspecific hybrids of haplochromine cichlids. Graphs show the distribution in morphospace of
six different F2 hybrid crosses and the corresponding homospecific crosses of species pairs with increasing genetic distance
from smallest (a, b) to largest distance (f). Abbreviations of species names correspond to Table 1. Every data point represents
one individual. Filled symbols indicate parental species, triangles indicate F2 hybrids. Blue squares encompass the phenotype
range of the combined parental species; red squares represent the phenotype range of F2 hybrids. The percentage of variance
explained by principal component 1 and 2 are shown in brackets. Note that the visualization of transgression is restricted to
the first two axes of shape variation here, which is not (or not entirely) representative of the total amount of transgression
found per cross type.

We further tested if phenotypic and genetic divergence
between the parental species were correlated. Although we
found a positive trend, the relationship was not significant (logarithmic regression: R2 = 0.22, F1,6 = 1.45; p =
0.28) due to one outlying data point (P. nyererei Ã A. calliptera, cross 7; the exclusion of this outlier resulted in a
strong positive correlation: R2 = 0.81, F1,5 = 17.32; p =
0.014).

from here on results of the three clocks will be reported in
this order, see also Table 2).
In F1 hybrids, testing genetic distance as a predictor for
the total amount of transgression (Ttotal) resulted in a ushaped relationship although this was not significant
(quadratic regression: R2 (adjusted) = 0.52, F2,6 = 4.21, p =
0.104; Figure 2a). Large amounts of transgression were
observed in hybrids between both closely and distantly
related crosses (13-33% in closely related crosses, 14% in
distant crosses) with a near absence of transgression (0.16%) in crosses of intermediate genetic distance.

Discussion and Conclusion
Studies on interspecific animal and plant hybrids have
demonstrated that hybridization frequently gives rise to
phenotypic novelty. One source of such novelty that may
facilitate adaptive evolution is transgressive segregation
which refers to the occurrence of hybrid phenotypes that
express trait values exceeding the phenotypic range of
both parental species combined [25,26]. Evidence supporting the notion that transgressive ecomorphological
and ecophysiological trait values can generate functional
novelty that permits colonizing previously underutilized
peaks on a fitness landscape comes from detailed work on
Helianthus sunflowers. This work conclusively demonstrated how transgression in key ecological traits can allow
hybrids to invade an ecologically and spatially distinct
niche and in turn escape the homogenizing effects of gene
flow from parental species [10,13,44,45].

In F2 hybrids, transgression significantly increased with
genetic distance (linear regression: R2 = 0.78, F1,5 = 12.29,
p = 0.025; Figure 2b) with a minimum of 6% transgression in closely related crosses and a maximum of 39%
transgression in distant crosses.
Transgressive segregation as a function of phenotypic
differentiation
According to our prediction, transgression should
decrease as a function of phenotypic dissimilarity between
the parental species. Testing phenotypic distance (calculated as Mahalanobis distance) as a predictor for the
amount of transgression (Ttotal) did not result in a significant relationship in F1 hybrids (linear regression: R2 =
0.38, F1,6 = 3.06, p = 0.140; Figure 3a) nor in F2 hybrids
(linear regression: R2 = 0.05, F1,5 = 0.21, p = 0.674; Figure
3b).

(A. calliptera, A. burtoni) to test if the amount of transgression in interspecific hybrids increased as a function of
genetic distance between species. We made seven different
cross types from different species combinations representing five different genetic distances, covering absolute
divergence times of between a few thousand years to 2.7/
3.8/7.4 million years depending on the molecular clock
used (see Table 2). One of these crosses (A. calliptera Ã A.
burtoni) was between two riverine species of the genus that
was ancestral to the two large African radiations. Using
geometric morphometrics on the multi-trait phenotypes
we quantified and compared shape variation in F1 and F2
generation hybrids and in the two corresponding homospecific control crosses.
We predicted to observe an increase of transgression with
increasing genetic crossing distance in both F1 and F2
hybrids. In F1 hybrids, the increase may be predicted to be
less steep than in F2 hybrids because (besides epistatic
interactions) only dominant genetic effects can contribute
to complementary gene action, while in F2 hybrids, additive genetic effects also contribute. We found that transgressive segregation was frequent and that extreme trait
values were produced in each F1 and F2 cross type. The
amount of transgression observed in F2 hybrids increased
linearly with time since speciation (Figure 2b) confirming
our prediction. However, in the F1 hybrids, large amounts
of transgression were expressed in hybrids between both
closely and distantly related species but transgression was

nearly absent in hybrids of parents with intermediate
genetic distances, resulting in a u-shaped relationship
between transgression and divergence time (Figure 2a).
While the increase of transgression in F1 hybrids of distant crosses can be explained by a higher frequency of epistatic interactions and dominant genetic effects, the large
amount of transgression observed in F1 hybrids of closely
related species was unexpected. Models of complementary gene action in transgressive segregation usually
assume that parental species are fixed for QTL alleles. It is
possible that the closely related species in our experiment
produced transgressive F1 progeny because the parents
were heterozygous at some QTL. This is possible because
all our closely related species had sympatric distribution
ranges within Lake Victoria where interspecific hybridization may occasionally occur [46]. Alternatively, overall
increased hybrid vigour, accompanying increased average
heterozygosity in the F1 hybrid generation, may have led
to larger and hence transgressive trait values in more vigorous individuals of crosses between closely related species. Generally, the relationship between offspring vigour
and the genetic distance between their parents is predicted
to be dome-shaped (with a left-shifted mode) confirmed
by both experimental [47-52] and theoretical work
[53,54]. This is thought to be due to the effects of inbreeding depression at small distances and the effects of genetic
incompatibilities, the break-up of co-adapted gene complexes, epistatic interactions and underdominance (heter-

ozygote disadvantage) at larger distances. Hence, the
fitness peak will typically reside in the region representing
intraspecific between-population matings. If, however,
speciation was recent - as in the case of rapidly radiating
species flocks - the intrinsically determined fitness peak
(disregarding extrinsic, ecologically-determined fitness)
may well be shifted to overlap with the interspecific
region. On this note, it would be useful to determine the
genetic distance where the increasing effects of genetic
incompatibilities and the decreasing heterosis effects typically cancel out, to assess if this may have caused the
depression in the amount of transgression at intermediate
genetic distances in F1 hybrids observed in our experiment.
We further found that the degree of phenotypic differentiation of the parental species in our experiment was not
predicted by genetic distance. This is in agreement with a
recent comparative genomic analysis of Lake Malawi cichlids showing that cichlid species can be phenotypically
and behaviorally diverse while showing levels of genomewide differentiation not larger than typically observed
between subdivided populations of the same species [55].
Because phenotypic distance, in contrast to genetic distance, is predicted to have a negative effect on the occurrence of transgression, the effects of both variables can
theoretically cancel out. We thus tested if transgression
was also a function of the increasing phenotypic dissimilarity between species. Contrary to our prediction, the
amount of transgression in both F1 and F2 hybrids was
independent of phenotypic differentiation (Figure 3). It is
hence unlikely that the counteracting effects of phenotypic divergence in our experiment compromised the
effect of genetic distance.
Except for the three species crosses representing the lowest
end of the genetic distance gradient in our experiment,
most of the species we used are allopatric in the wild
(crosses 4-7, Table 1; note that even though A. calliptera
occurs in the same lake with P. taeniolatus and M. estherae
it has little habitat overlap with either). They presumably
acquired divergent phenotypes as a result different selection regimes in different environments, with perhaps contributions of drift, rather than due to consistent and
strong disruptive selection on the same traits, which
would have purged many of the antagonistic allelic effects
within QTLs. It is hence likely that alleles of opposing
signs were preserved during the divergence of even the
phenotypically most divergent species in our experiment,
resulting in frequent opportunity for complementary gene
action in their hybrids. The latter may explain why the
amount of transgression is not a function of phenotypic
divergence in our data set. Our experimental design is not
suitable to test the effect of a gradually increasing disruptive selection coefficient on the amount of transgression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/283

but this relationship is certainly worthwhile to be investigated in future experiments.
All factors considered it seems plausible that the observed
increase in transgression with genetic distance in F2
hybrids is mainly the result of an increasing opportunity
for complementary gene action and epistasis in hybrids
between genetically more distant lineages. This is probably due to an increasing number of QTLs for which the
diverging species fix alleles with opposite signs, providing
more frequent opportunity for transgression in interspecific hybrids (note that we do not refer here to consistent
directional selection which would fix positive signs across
all QTLs in one species and all negative signs in the other
species).
Implications of the observed positive relationship
between genetic distance and transgression are particularly interesting where hybridization between distantly
related lineages has taken place at the onset of rapid adaptive radiations. Traces of ancient hybridization in phylogenetic reconstructions of several plants and animal
radiations suggest that genetic exchange between at least
two distantly related lineages occurred at the onset of radiations, and may have acted as a catalyst for the rapid phenotypic diversification of these groups [15,17,19,56,57].
The largest genetic distance between species in our experiment represents similar divergence times (2.7/3.8/7.4
my) to those estimated for the hypothesized, anciently
hybridized ancestors of two major cichlid radiations (Lake
paleo-Makgadikgadi [15], Lake Victoria [16]). In fact, the
Astatotilapia calliptera Ã A. burtoni cross could be considered a simulation of what effect hybridization between
the ancestors of these radiations would have had on phenotypic variation. These two species are phenotypically
and ecologically very similar to the putative ancestors of
the Lake Victoria region adaptive radiation [16].
It is worth mentioning that many of the hybrids we
obtained phenotypically resemble other species known
from the cichlid radiations, an observation made before
on other cichlid hybrid phenotypes generated in the laboratory [27,58]. For example, hybrids between P. chilotes
and P. nyererei resembled the Lake Victoria species Haplochromis sp. "thickskin" in overall body and head morphology, whereas hybrids between A. calliptera and P. nyererei
resembled another Lake Victoria species (Pundamlia sp.
"yellow azurea") in coloration and body shape. These
observations make it indeed plausible that hybridization
between divergent genomes has contributed to the unusually rapid rates of phenotypic evolution in haplochromine
cichlids. Transgressive segregation potentially increases
the working surface for selection well beyond that provided by standing genetic variation within just two generations. It can thus provide rapid momentum to the

adaptive diversification of a group under multifarious
selection by cutting the waiting time to new mutations.
Some hybrid species have indeed been shown to establish
in new ecological niches in very few generations [28,59].
If transgressive segregation was an important contributor
to the volume and extent of phenotypic diversification
during adaptive radiations [19,27,60], variation in the
genetic architecture between lineages (which can be either
conducive or obstructive to complementary gene action)
might cause variation in the rates of adaptive radiation
observed between lineages. This hypothesis is speculative
at this moment and awaits rigorous testing.

Methods
Producing hybrids
Crosses used nine species of haplochromine cichlids from
Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi and East African rivers (Table
1), representing different, ecologically specialized groups.
Among them were a rock-dwelling planktivore (Pundamilia nyererei), an insect larvae picker (Paralabidochromis chilotes), two trophic generalists (Pundamilia pundamilia,
Paralabidochromis rockkribensis), rock-dwelling algae scrapers (Neochromis omnicaeruleus, Metriaclima estherae), algae
suckers (Protomelas taeniolatus), and two habitat generalists (Astatotilapia calliptera, Astatotilapia burtoni) [61,62].
All species are female mouthbrooders and inhabit shallow
waters (1-10 m in depth).

Measuring transgressive shape segregation using geometric
morphometrics
All hybrids and the corresponding homospecific individuals were photographed at the age of 180 (Â± 1) days. Pictures were taken of the left side of the live fish in a
transparent photo cuvette with a scale for size calibration.
Geometric morphometric analysis was performed on the
x-y coordinates of 15 landmarks placed on the photographs (Figure 4) using tpsDig version 2.10, [64]. To
reduce noise introduced through variation in position,
orientation and size, this non-shape variation was mathematically removed using generalized procrustes analysis
(GPA) [65,66]. GPA superimposes landmark configurations in that it minimizes the sum of squared distances
between corresponding landmarks by scaling, translating
and rotating specimens onto a mean consensus configuration calculated from all specimens. Thin-plate spline
(TPS) procedure was then applied to obtain partial warps
using tpsRelw version 1.45 [67]. Partial warps estimate the
minimum bending energy needed to deform an infinitely
thin metal plate (i.e. the landmark configuration of an
individual fish) to adopt the shape of another landmark
configuration (i.e. the consensus configuration among all
the fish) while being constrained at particular points (i.e
the landmarks). The total deformation of the spline can
be broken down into geometrically orthogonal components in a Cartesian coordinate system (i.e. the partial
warps) to describe the amount of stretching, bending and

All parental individuals used for making hybrid crosses
were derived from laboratory populations bred from fish
collected in Lake Victoria and Lake Malawi and maintained in the large fish breeding facility at EAWAG, Switzerland.
Seven different F1 hybrid cross types were obtained by
populating aquaria (100 Ã 40 Ã 40 cm) with five to twenty
females of one species and one heterospecific male. Subsequently, F2 hybrids were bred from different males and
females of six different F1 hybrid cross types (one F1 cross
type, P.rockkribensis Ã P.pundamilia, could not be bred further due to space constraints. However, the genetic distance of this pair is represented by two other cross types in
the experiment; Table 2). No fish was used to produce
more than one hybrid family.
Experimental tanks were part of a large water recirculation
system, light regime was 12L:12D and water temperature
was kept constant at 24 - 26Â°C. All animals were fed the
same food (dry food every day, and a blend of shrimps,
peas and Spirulina powder two times a week) allocated in
equal amounts every day, and were raised to 180 days in
age. At 180 days almost all individuals had reached sexual
maturity. Further information regarding breeding and
maintenance is given elsewhere [63].

twisting necessary to superimpose the coordinates of all
specimens onto the consensus shape. Each individual
then has a weight for the x- and y- components of each
partial warp.
All subsequent analyses were performed in JMP 7.0 [68].
Partial warp weights were regressed against size and residuals of these were used for all further analysis to remove
potential allometric size effects. Residuals were entered
into principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the
major axes of shape variation, which is also referred to as
relative warp analysis [69]. We extracted all principal components that explained more than 5% of the variance in
the data set (between 4 and 6 components, the number of
PCs used per cross type is shown in Additional file 3).
The amount of transgression (TPCi) occurring along a principal component axis (PCi) was calculated as

T PCi =

( rangetotal â range homospecific ) ,

(1)

range homospecific

where rangetotal is the total phenotypic range between the
largest and smallest observation of all hybrid and homospecific individuals of a particular cross type, and rangehomospecific represents the phenotypic range including only
homospecific individuals of that cross type. The numerator hence stands for the transgressive portion of the hybrid
range (rangetrans; for a schematic drawing of the variables
see Figure 5). We then calculated the sum of transgression

found along all PCs to obtain the total amount of transgression (Ttotal which can be larger than 100%). This was
done in a weighted averaging procedure, where TPCi was
multiplied with the percentage variance explained by that
PC.
To test the effect of increasing genetic distance on the
amount of transgression (Ttotal) we regressed Ttotal against
genetic distance using linear regression models. Normal
distribution of variables was confirmed with ShapiroWilk tests.
To test whether families within cross types differed in their
phenotype distribution, we used MANOVA with family as
factor and all relevant PCs as response variables. This analysis was performed on both hybrids and homospecific
crosses.
Measuring genetic distance and divergence time
Genetic distances were estimated for every species pair
used for making hybrid crosses by calculating uncorrected
p-distances from D-loop sequences downloaded from
NCBI GenBank (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/;
accession numbers of all sequences can be found in Additional file 4). All available sequences of every species were
included for calculating genetic distances. For six species
no sequences were available (P. pundamilia, P. nyererei, N.
omnicaeruleus, P. rockkribensis, P. chilotes, M. estherae). In
these cases we used sequences from a very closely related
species. This was in all cases justified because both species
(experimental and substitute) belonged to the same clade
within which mitochondrial DNA haplotype sorting is
highly incomplete (i.e. the radiation of Lake Victoria and
a clade of the Lake Malawi Mbuna). Sequences were
aligned in ClustalW [70] using the pairwise alignment
algorithm and alignments were manually controlled and
improved locally. Genetic distances were calculated in
MEGA 4 [71]. Where multiple sequences were available,
we took the average of all possible pairwise interspecific pdistances (e.g. [72,73]. To correct comparisons between
species for the variation occurring within species, mean
intraspecific genetic distances (the mean of the two species means) were subtracted from mean interspecific distances [73,74].

Genetic distances were converted into absolute times of
divergence using two different non-linear relaxed molecular clocks (one calibrated using the cichlid fossil record
and recent geological events and the other using the fragmentation of Gondwanaland and recent geological events
[75]). In addition, we used an internally calibrated linear
clock that has been widely used in cichlid phylogeography
[76]. We note that there is increasingly wide support for
the Gondwana fragmentation clock [77].

Measuring phenotypic shape divergence
Phenotypic shape divergence was quantified by measuring the mean of all Mahalanobis distances between individuals of any two species. As variables we used all
principal components (from a PCA including both parental species) that explained more than 5% of the variance.
Distances were then averaged to obtain a measure of the
overall phenotypic dissimilarity of any two parental species. To correct comparisons between species for the variation occurring within species, mean intraspecific
phenotypic distances (the mean of the two species means)
were subtracted from mean interspecific distances.
