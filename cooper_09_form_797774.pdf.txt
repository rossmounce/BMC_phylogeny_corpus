Abstract
Background: Damselfishes (Perciformes, Pomacentridae) are a major component of coral reef
communities, and the functional diversity of their trophic anatomy is an important constituent of
the ecological morphology of these systems. Using shape analyses, biomechanical modelling, and
phylogenetically based comparative methods, we examined the anatomy of damselfish feeding
among all genera and trophic groups. Coordinate based shape analyses of anatomical landmarks
were used to describe patterns of morphological diversity and determine positions of functional
groups in a skull morphospace. These landmarks define the lever and linkage structures of the
damselfish feeding system, and biomechanical analyses of this data were performed using the
software program JawsModel4 in order to calculate the simple mechanical advantage (MA)
employed by different skull elements during feeding, and to compute kinematic transmission
coefficients (KT) that describe the efficiency with which angular motion is transferred through the
complex linkages of damselfish skulls.
Results: Our results indicate that pomacentrid planktivores are significantly different from other
damselfishes, that biting MA values and protrusion KT ratios are correlated with pomacentrid
trophic groups more tightly than KT scores associated with maxillary rotation and gape angle, and
that the MAs employed by their three biting muscles have evolved independently. Most of the
biomechanical parameters examined have experienced low levels of phylogenetic constraint, which
suggests that they have evolved quickly.
Conclusion: Joint morphological and biomechanical analyses of the same anatomical data provided
two reciprocally illuminating arrays of information. Both analyses showed that the evolution of
planktivory has involved important changes in pomacentrid functional morphology, and that the
mechanics of upper jaw kinesis have been of great importance to the evolution of damselfish
feeding. Our data support a tight and biomechanically defined link between structure and the
functional ecology of fish skulls, and indicate that certain mechanisms for transmitting motion
through their jaw linkages may require particular anatomical configurations, a conclusion that
contravenes the concept of "many-to-one mapping" for fish jaw mechanics. Damselfish trophic
evolution is characterized by rapid and repeated shifts between a small number of ecomorphological states, an evolutionary pattern that we describe as reticulate adaptive radiation.

Background
Studies of functional morphology permit us to describe
the connection between anatomical and ecological diversity in terms of biomechanical ability [1,2]. By examining
the trophic anatomy of a lineage using both morphometric and biomechanical analyses, we can improve our
understanding of how the diversification of head morphology is linked to ecological divergence via changes in
feeding performance [3]. Further details about patterns of
functional diversification can be obtained by performing
these studies within a comparative, phylogenetic context
[4,5]. Such an approach can be used to indicate which
aspects of trophic biomechanics tend to be correlated,
whether they have evolved rapidly or exhibit evidence of
constraint, and whether there are significant biomechanical differences between the related members of separate
trophic groups.
The damselfishes represent one of the most successful
radiations of coral reef fishes [6-9], containing nearly 300
species that are associated with coral communities [10].
Pomacentrids are ubiquitous on coral reefs [6], and they
have been present within these ecosystems for at least 50
million years [9,11]. Damselfishes are also widely distributed among the nearshore rocky reef communities of both
tropical and temperate regions, although they play less
dominant roles in these ecosystems [10]. By studying the
functional morphology of the Pomacentridae we can
describe the radiation of a successful vertebrate lineage in
both anatomical and mechanical terms [12,13], and such
work has strong implications for understanding the evolutionary history of important ocean ecosystems, particularly coral reefs.

(1) perform dissections on the heads of specimens representing all damselfish genera and trophic classes, (2) collect coordinate data for anatomical landmarks of
functional importance to damselfish feeding from digital
images of these dissections, (3) use this data to describe
and quantify the shape diversity of damselfish heads
using geometric morphometric techniques, (4) use a computer model to predict the biomechanical potential of
damselfish skulls based on the relative positions of these
landmarks, and (5) use phylogenetic comparative techniques to examine patterns in the evolution of damselfish
trophic biomechanics.

Methods
Damselfish specimens were primarily selected from the
fish collection of the Field Museum of Natural History,
and additional specimens were provided by the Australian
Museum, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the
United States National Museum of Natural History in the
Smithsonian Institution. At least one species from each of
the 28 damselfish genera (until recently 29) was examined [10,23,24], and in almost all cases we examined 3
specimens of each species (Additional file 1). Most of the
specimens were collected by the authors and their collaborators during Field Museum expeditions to the Philippines, Australia and Cape Verde. Fishes were killed using
spears and the ichthyocide rotenone in accordance with
the permits issued by the governmental agencies of these
countries.

Here we describe damselfish head shape diversity in a
manner that explicitly links morphology to ecology via
biomechanics. The field of functional morphology has
seen a recent increase in the number of studies that combine shape analyses with biomechanical analyses [e.g.,
[4,5,14-20]], and some of these authors have utilized the
advantages that geometric, or coordinate based, morphometric techniques provide when engaging in this work
[e.g., [15,16,18,19]]. Coordinate based shape analyses
require fewer assumptions regarding the relative importance of individual variables than do traditional (measurement based) shape analyses, they facilitate the
detection of morphological patterns that are not specified
a priori, and they permit the reliable removal of size and
orientation differences from an anatomical dataset
[15,16,18,19,21,22].

Dissections were performed on the right side of fish heads
in order to expose morphological landmarks of functional
importance for fish feeding (Figure 1). Except in the case
of Altrichthys curatus, where only juveniles were available,
all specimens were adults. Dissected heads were photographed in lateral view from a position directly perpendicular to the plane described by the landmarks on the side
of each fish's head. Since identical positioning of moveable elements is necessary when performing geometric
morphometric analyses, all fishes were photographed
with their mouths closed and their operculae and hyoid
arches adducted. A scale bar was included in each photograph. Most specimens were photographed using a Leica
digital camera interfaced with a dissecting microscope.
Larger species were photographed using a Nikon coolpix
4300 digital camera. Nineteen morphological landmarks
(LM; Figure 1) were plotted on each image using the software program tpsDig [25], which was also used to determine the Cartesian coordinates of each landmark and to
establish the scale of all images.

We used a combination of geometric morphometrics, biomechanical computer models, and phylogenetic comparative techniques to examine patterns of trophic diversity
among the Pomacentridae. The goals of this study were to:

forces are applied); 13 = Most posterio-ventral point of the eye socket; 14 = Dorsal-most tip of the supraoccipital crest on the

from all specimens of each species were performed using
the program CoordGen (species were analysed individually). This procedure transforms the data so as to reduce or
eliminate differences in landmark configurations that are
due to the size of the specimens or their positions when
photographed, and does so without distorting shape
information. Landmark configurations are translated,
scaled and rotated so as to minimize the squared,
summed distances between the corresponding landmarks
of each individual and the mean [26]. The average shape
of each species was determined by calculating the mean of
each coordinate from the Procrustes transformed data
from all specimens of that species using the program Excel
(Microsoft, Corp.).
One-way MANOVA analyses were conducted in order to
determine it there were significant skull shape differences
between damselfish trophic groups. Analyses were per-

formed using the Procrustes mean shape of each species,
with every species except Cheiloprion labiatus assigned to
one of three trophic groups (Additional file 1). C. labiatus
was excluded from these analyses since it was the only
member of its trophic category. Two different MANOVA
test statistics were used to determine if there was trophic
information in the morphological data: Wilk's Lambda
(using the program CVAGen6o), and Goodall's F (using
the program MANOVAboard). Pairwise one-way
MANOVA analyses (Goodall's F test) were performed
using the program Twogroup6h in order to determine if
pairs of trophic groups (including a planktivore vs. omnivore + herbivore comparison) possess significantly different skull shapes. CoordGen, CVAGen6o, MANOVAboard,
and Twogroup6h are part of the Integrated Morphometrics Programs (IMP), and compiled stand-alone versions
that run in Windows are freely available at http://

A canonical variates (CV) analysis of the Procrustes means
of each species (except C. labiatus) was also performed
using the program CVAGen6o. The results of this analysis
were used to determine how many types of independent
shape variation (CV axes) were present in the data, to
depict patterns of damselfish skull shape variation, and to
assess the reliability with which CV axes could be used to
assign a species to the appropriate trophic group based on
its mean Procrustes coordinate configuration.
Partial warp scores were calculated for the specimens
(CVAGen6o), and these scores were used to find the set of
axes that allows for the greatest possible ability to discriminate between two or more groups. The number of distinct
CV axes were determined at a p = 0.05 level of significance, and the canonical variates scores of all the specimens were computed. We used these scores to plot the
location of each species on CV axes in order to depict
shape differences among the damselfish species in the
three trophic groups examined. A jackknife resampling
analysis (1,000 iterations) was also performed using
CVAGen6o in order to determine how reliably the CV axes
could be used to assign specimens to trophic groups. This
procedure leaves out one specimen (in this case the Procrustes mean for a species) at a time and then assigns that
species to a group based on the CV axes.
A relative warp (RW) analysis was also used to depict head
shape variation among the specimens. The software program tpsRelw [27] was used to perform a Procrustes
sumperimposition of the coordinate data (all specimens)
generated using tpsDig [25], followed by a RW analysis of
the transformed coordinates. The RW scores of each specimen were used to map their location on RW axes, and 2dimensional views of this "shape space" were inspected in
order to determine the relative shape differences among
individual skulls. We chose to examine damselfish head
shape distributions along those initial RW axes that, when
taken together, summarized at least 70% of the variation
in the data
Biomechanical analyses
The mechanical properties of damselfish jaw linkages, as
well as predictions of their kinetic potential, were modelled using the computer program JawsModel4 (available
from Mark Westneat upon request). The multiple mobile
bones in most perciform fish skulls form a connected
series of levers and linkages whose properties can be
described in mechanical terms [28-32]. JawsModel4 uses
engineering principals to describe and predict the biomechanics of the anterior jaw linkages during fish feeding
[30]. The anatomical linkages in damselfish skulls that
were modelled using JawsModel4 can be seen in Figure 1.
Only data from adult specimens were used as input, so
there are no calculations for Altrichthys curatus.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/24

JawsModel4 was used to calculate two sets of mechanical
parameters for particular sub-divisions of damselfish
trophic anatomy: 1) simple mechanical advantage (MA);
and 2) kinematic transmission coefficients (KT). MA
describes the length ratio of two levers connected to the
same fulcrum: an input lever (inlever), or effort arm, and
an output lever (outlever), or resistance arm (MA = input
lever length/output lever length).
In most fishes the jaws are closed by the adductor mandibulae (AM) muscle, and in many perciform fishes, including the damselfishes, this muscle is sub-divided into three
parts (the A1, A2, A3) that insert at different locations on
the lower jaw (Figure 1). The distances between the insertion points of the 3 AM sub-divisions and the center of the
lower jaw joint (the quadrate-articular joint) form three
inlevers, while the distance from this joint to the tip of the
anterior-most tooth in the lower jaw was defined as the
outlever. High mechanical advantages (relatively long
inlevers) allow for a multiplication of the force produced
by the jaw muscles during its transfer to the lower jaw and
the teeth. Low mechanical advantages (relatively long outlevers) allow for a faster bite, as a relatively small retraction of the input lever is translated into a much wider
sweep of the lower jaw in the same amount of time.
Kinematic transmissions coefficients (KTs) describe the
ratio of output rotation to input rotation (KT = output
rotation/input rotation) when motion is transmitted
through a set of connected linkages [30]. JawsModel4 calculates the transmission of rotational motion through
independent four-bar linkages, or through a series of connected four-bars, and calculates KT values for each action.
High KT values indicate high levels of velocity transfer
through a linkage system, with a low KT signifying greater
force transmission. Four mechanical advantage and three
KT parameters were estimated for each specimen: the jaw
opening MA, the MAs employed during biting by the three
biting muscles (A1MA, A2MA, A3MA) and the KTs for the
rotation of the maxilla (maxillary KT), the production of
gape or mouth opening (gape KT), and the protrusion of
the premaxilla (i.e., upper jaw protrusion; protrusion KT),
using the protocol originally outlined by Westneat [30].
Phylogenetics
In order to account for the influence of common descent
on the pattern of damselfish biomechanical diversity, it
was necessary to perform comparative analyses within a
phylogenetic context. We used the topology and branch
lengths from a well-supported Bayesian consensus tree in
all phylogenetic comparative analyses [24]. Three of the
species examined here were not included in the phylogenetic study: Abudefduf saxatilis, Amphiprion akindynos and
Stegastes flavilatus. The phylogenetic locations of Abudefduf
vaigiensis, Amphiprion peridarion and S. partitus were there-

fore substituted for their congeners. The DNA from members of the genera Nexilosus (which is monotypic) and
Altrichthys (two species) were amplified from dried skeletal remains several decades old, and from formalin fixed
tissues, respectively. The limited amount of sequence data
obtained, while indicating tentative positions for these
species within the damselfish tree [24], did not yield adequate branch length information for comparative analyses. The biomechanical data for Nexilosus latifrons and was
therefore excluded from the comparative analyses along
with that of Altrichthys curatus. The phylogenetic relationships of the species examined, and their substitutes, are
presented in Figure 2.

pared using the program Regressionv2.m [37]: an
ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression model,
which assumes a star phylogeny (i.e., equal levels of interrelatedness among all members of a clade); and a phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) linear regression
model that incorporates phylogenetic information via a
branch length matrix. Both ln likelihood values (ln ML)
and Akaike information criterion values (AIC) were used
to compare the fit of the two models to the data. A better
fit is indicated by higher ln ML values and lower AIC values. A better fit of the PGLS model is interpreted as an
indication of the presence of significant phylogenetic signal for the character being examined [37].

Phylogenetic comparative analyses and statistical tests
Phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC) analyses
were performed using the programs PDAP 1.09 [33] and
Mesquite 1.12 [34] in order to search for significant correlations between the biomechanical parameters calculated
by JawsModel4. This method was used to reduce the effect
of common descent on patterns of correlation between
biomechanical variables [35]. PIC calculates contrasts
between pairs of branches descended from a common
ancestor, and these contrasts may be used in regression
analyses [35]. The biomechanical parameter values for
each species were determined by calculating a mean value
for each parameter from all specimens of that species, and
these species means were used in all phylogenetic comparative analyses.

Regressionv2.m can also be used to weight mean character
values in order to account for phylogenetic effects. In cases
of
significant
levels
of
phylogenetic
signal,
Regressionv2.m was used to perform analyses of variance
(ANOVA), which it does using OLS regression, in order to
determine whether the adjusted mean parameter values of
the three major damselfish trophic groups were significantly different. Data from those parameters that did not
exhibit a significant level of phylogenetic signal were analyzed using the computer program SAS (SAS Institute,
Inc.) to calculate pairwise ANOVAs in order to test for biomechanical differences between trophic groups. Gabriel's
test, the Studentized maximum modulus test, and Bonferroni t-tests were all used to test for significance when making multiple comparisons. A stepwise discriminant
function analysis (DFA) of all biomechanical data
(untransformed by phylogenetic correction) was also performed using SAS in order to determine which parameters
best distinguished between trophic groups. A nominal
alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine significance
among the results of all statistical tests.

Two fundamentally different methods were used to test
for the presence of phylogenetic signal (a tendency for
related species to resemble each other) among the patterns presented by each biomechanical parameter. The
basic assumption in both cases was that slowly evolving
characters will be most similar in closely related species
(i.e., the data will display a phylogenetic pattern), while
rapidly evolving characters will display a more random
pattern. Both of the programs used to perform these analyses are Matlab modules (The mathworks, Inc.).
A randomization procedure was performed using the program PHYSIG.M [36] in order to determine whether a
given tree (topology and branch lengths) has a better fit to
tip data (in this case values for a specific biomechanical
parameter for each species) in comparison to when the
data have been randomly permuted across the tips of the
tree. A significantly greater fit of the tree to the original
data configuration is interpreted as evidence for the presence of significant phylogenetic signal, which suggests
that the character (e.g., biomechanical parameter) in
question has not evolved rapidly [36].
The fit of two types of linear regression models to the biomechanical data (the JawsModel4 predictions) were com-

Results
Summary
The main results of this study are: (1) MANOVA, CV and
RW analyses effectively distinguished between the cranial
morphologies of primarily planktivorous damselfishes
and those that consume algae (both herbivores and omnivores), while the skull and jaw muscle anatomy of herbivores and omnivores displayed a great deal of overlap; (2)
damselfishes that are primarily planktivorous are strongly
distinguished from other pomacentrids by their cranial
biomenchanics; (3) damselfish cranial biomechanics
have evolved under low levels of phylogenetic constraint;
(4) the MA values employed by the three biting muscles
have not evolved in a correlated manner, while there has
been a considerable degree of correlated evolution among
the KT values associated with damselfish jaw linkages; and
(5) of the biomechanical parameters examined, the MA
values and protrusion KT were associated with damselfish

trophic groups to a greater degree than the remaining KT
parameters.
Shape analyses
The results of the one-way MANOVA analyses that examined all species indicated the presence of significant
trophic signal in the morphological data (Table 1). Pairwise MANOVA results revealed that damselfish planktivores possess head shapes that are significantly different
from both herbivores and omnivores, considered both
separately and together (Table 1). Members of these two
later groups could not be reliably distinguished from each
other by their head anatomy (Table 1).

Only the first CV axis was found to significantly distinguish between damselfish trophic groups, and plotting
the CV scores of the species examined onto CV axes 1 and
2 revealed that planktivores were strongly distinguished
from both herbivores and omnivores by CV 1, but that
some omnivores were more similar to planktivores than
any of the herbivores (Figure 3). There was strong overlap
between the head shapes of herbivores and omnivores
(Figure 3). The vector and deformation plot in figure 3
demonstrates that CV1 describes differences in head
length, head height, the length of the lower jaw, the length
of the ascending process of the premaxilla, the size of the
eyes, the size of all jaw adducting muscles, the height of
the supraoccipital crest, and the anterior-posterior positioning of the posterior margin of this crest (Figure 3). The
use of jackknifing to assign individual species to trophic
groups based on the CV axes resulted in the false classification of 3 of the 10 planktivorous species as omnivores,
4 of the 13 omnivores as herbivores, and 3 of the 6 herbivores as omnivores (65.52% accuracy). Planktivores were
never classified as herbivores and vice versa.
The first four RW axes accounted for a combined total of
71.74% of the variance in our coordinate data: RW1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/24

(35.18%), RW2 (18.36%), RW3 (11.01%), RW4 (7.19%).
The head shape differences associated with RW1 are
nearly identical with those that are associated with CV1
(see above), and the groupings of the individual damselfish specimens from each species on this axis are therefore
extremely similar to those found for the Procrustes mean
of each species on CV1. The RW scores of specimens from
all trophic groups overlap to a large degree on RW 2–4.
RW2 describes variation in the vertical positions of the
posterio-dorsal edge of the A1 and A3 muscles, as well as
the vertical position of the eyes (Figure 4). RW3 describes
variation in the angle of the mouth relative to the long
axis of the body (Figure 4). It distinguishes between those
fishes whose lower jaws are parallel with their main body
axis when the mouth is closed, and those fishes with
upturned mouths (i.e., fishes whose jaw lengths contribute relatively less to their overall body length). RW4
describes variation in the bluntness of the head profile
(Figure 4).
The RW1 vs. RW2 score plot displayed a distribution pattern that was nearly identical to that in the CV1 vs. CV2
score plot, and this RW information was therefore used to
estimate the location of Cheiloprion labiatus in Figure 3. C.
labiatus always fell within the herbivore/omnivore clusters
on RW 1–4. Due to the redundancy between many of the
CV and RW score plots, we do not present this information for the RW results. RW analyses do, however, permit
the description of the major types of uncorrelated shape
variation in morphological data, and are therefore useful
for describing damselfish skull shape diversity. We therefore provide figure 4, which displays pictorial descriptions
of the shape differences that are associated with each RW
axis using pair-wise comparisons of pomacentrid species
whose head shapes are strongly differentiated by one axis,
but which are otherwise similar (i.e., they have similar
scores on all other RW axes).

The results of the PIC analyses indicate that the evolution
of each of the KT parameters examined has been correlated with that of at least two other biomechanical parameters (protrusion KT was significantly correlated with
three), while none of the individual MA parameters exhibited evidence of correlated evolution with more than one
other parameter, and there was no evidence for correlated
evolution between jaw opening MA and any other parameters (Figure 5). There was no evidence for correlated evolution between any of the three biting MA parameters
examined (Figure 5).

Biomechanics and phylogenetic comparative analyses
Pomacentrid planktivores were, in general, well distinguished from other damselfishes by their jaw mechanics.
Azurina hirundo, Chromis punctipinnis, Lepidozygus tapeinosoma, Pristotis obtusirostris, and Teixeirichthys jordani had
especially low A1MA and A2MA values combined with
high protrusion KT values (Additional files 2 and 3),
which indicates that they can bite quickly and protrude
their upper jaws with a high degree of efficiency. These
three parameters best distinguished between damselfish
tropic groups (Additional files 4 and 5), and these five
species also had some of the most distinct head shapes
(Figure 3). Pomacentrid herbivores and omnivores,
although possessing generally higher A1MA and A2MA
values and lower protrusion KT values than most planktivores, did not show as high a degree of association
between their scores for these three parameters (Additional files 2, 3, 4).

The PHYSIG results indicated that only one biomechanical parameter, gape KT, showed significantly more phylogenetic signal than would be expected from
unconstrained evolution, but the Regressionv2.m results
indicated that the fit of the gape KT data to the OLS and
PGLS models was similar (Additional file 6). The
Regressionv2.m results clearly support the fit of the data
from the other six biomechanical parameters to an OLS
model (i.e., no significant phylogenetic signal; Additional
file 5). The ANOVA results generated by Regressionv2.m
for phylogenetically corrected parameter values showed
no significant differences between trophic groups for gape
KT.
The ANOVA results (Additional file 4) showed significant
differences between damselfish trophic groups for three of
the four MA parameters (jaw opening MA, A1MA, and
A2MA), and one KT parameter (protrusion KT). The
results of Gabriel's test, the Studentized maximum modulus test, and Bonferroni t tests all concurred in their indications of which pairwise comparisons of trophic groups
were significant for these parameters, and of the seven significant comparisons, six included planktivores (Additional file 4). The results of the stepwise discriminant
function analysis indicated that the scores for the biomechanical parameters A1MA, A2MA and protrusion KT,
tend to distinguish damselfish trophic groups from each
other (Additional file 4).
Planktivorous damselfishes employ low mechanical
advantages when using their A1 muscles to close their
mouths, and they protrude their upper jaws (premaxillae)
with high efficiency (Additional file 4). Omnivores have
high MA values associated with their A2 muscles (Additional file 4). Herbivores are never distinguished from
both omnivores and planktivores by any biomechanical
parameter, but in comparison to planktivores they have
higher MA scores for both jaw opening and the A1 muscle,
and lower scores for the efficiency with which they protrude their premaxillae (Additional file 4). When compared to omnivores, they employ lower MA values when
contracting the A2 (Additional file 4).

Some species have very different MA rankings for different
biting muscles (Additional file 2). The planktivores Azurina hirundo, Teixeirichthys jordani and Lepidozygus tapeinosoma have low MA scores for the A1 and A2 muscles, while
possessing high scores for the A3 (Additional file 2). A.
hirundo has the highest A3MA score and the lowest A1MA
score (Additional file 2). A different pattern is exhibited
by the omnivores Abudefduf saxatilis and Similiparma hermani, which have the highest A1MA and A2MA scores,
respectively, while possessing low A3MA scores (Additional file 2).
Although the minimum MA scores calculated for the three
biting muscles were similar, their ranges and maximum
values were very different. Approximately 80% of the species examined had A1MA values that were higher than
both the maximum A2MA and A3MA values, and the
maximum A1MA value was 4.6 times higher than the
maximum A2MA score, and 6.1 times higher than the
maximum A3MA score (Additional file 2). The single
coral eating damselfish species examined, Cheiloprion
labiatus, has high jaw opening MA and A2MA scores, but
is not otherwise greatly distinguished from other damselfishes by its jaw biomechanics.
Two species have very different KT rankings for the rotation of different jaw linkage elements (Additional file 3).
Teixeirichthys jordani has the lowest gape KT score, the
highest protrusion KT score, and the second highest maxillary KT score (Additional file 3). Chromis punctipinnis has
the second lowest maxillary KT score (along with Mecaenichthys immaculatus), the second lowest gape KT score
(along with Similiparma hermani), and a high protrusion
KT score (Additional file 3). Microspathodon dorsalis exhibits a pattern of consistently low KT values, and has the
lowest maxillary KT score, the lowest protrusion KT score,
and along with Amblypomacentrus clarus, it has the third
lowest gape KT score (which is only marginally different
from the second lowest score; Additional file 3).

Discussion
The results of both the morphological and biomechanical
analyses clearly indicate that the evolution of planktivory
has involved important changes in pomacentrid functional morphology. The shape differences that separate
planktivores and non-planktivores account for the greatest degree of damselfish skull shape variation (Figure 3),
and of those biomechanical parameters that most clearly
distinguish between trophic groups, planktivores exhibit
different values compared to non-planktivores in most
cases (Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5). These aspects of damselfish trophic biomechanics have also experienced relatively
high rates of evolution (i.e., they have experienced low
levels of phylogenetic constraint; Additional file 6).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/24

Damselfish planktivory can be described as particulate
feeding in that they attack individual plankters that they
select visually [38-40]. The possession of relatively large
eyes should increase these fishes' ability to find and target
planktonic prey (Figure 4), and the mechanical arrangements of their head anatomies should allow them to rapidly pick plankton from the water column. The longer
jaws of pomacentrid planktivores increase the length of
the outlever during jaw opening and closing (Figures 3
and 4), a configuration that lends itself to the production
of fast mouth movements, and both the A1 and A2 biting
muscles tend to have low MA values (Additional files 2
and 4), which further contribute to the generation of fast
bites.
Compared to non-planktivorous damselfishes, pomacentrid planktivores can protrude their upper jaws greater distances with higher efficiency of movement (Figures 3, 4, 5;
Additional files 3 and 4). The longer ascending processes
on the premaxillae of planktivores (Figures 3 and 4)
allows for a greater degree of jaw protrusion, an action
that rapidly closes the distance between a fish and its prey
during a feeding strike. The lower jaws of perciform fishes
are indirectly linked to their premaxillae by means of a
movable, toothless maxilla that does not form part of the
bite [2,30,41]. When the lower jaw is abducted, the maxilla transfers this motion to the premaxilla in such a way
that it is protruded, and the protrusion distance that can
be achieved without the premaxilla becoming disassociated from the neurocranium is determined by the length
of its ascending process. The importance of premaxillary
protrusion for damselfish planktivory is supported by the
efficiency with which they produce this movement (Additional files 3 and 4). Nearly all of the planktivorous species examined had high protrusion KT scores (Additional
file 3), and this was the only KT parameter where the
mean scores of individual species distinguished between
damselfish tropic groups (Additional files 4 and 5).
Although herbivores are morphologically and biomechanically different from most planktivores, the differences between herbivores and omnivores are far less
pronounced. Only the mechanical advantages employed
by their A2 muscles significantly distinguish these two
groups (Additional file 4), and there is a high degree of
overlap in the types of head morphologies that they possess (Figure 3). The overlapping shape and functional distributions of herbivores and omnivores may indicate that
there are certain requirements for damselfishes that take
in benthic algae as an important component of their diet,
regardless of whether or not they are highly herbivorous.
Any algae that is consumed must be bitten through or
scraped from the substrate, and the production of some
minimal amount of force will be required in order to
accomplish this.

Trophic evolution and mechanical advantage
The possession of multiple jaw closing muscles allows for
the possibility of having some insertion points that are
well situated for efficiently transferring force, and others
that generate speed. Such arrangements could permit the
exploitation of a broader diet, or allow for one AM division to become highly specialized for either speed or
force, while other divisions maintain a necessary force/
speed balance during biting. That individual species
exhibit strong differences in the comparative rank of the
MA scores associated with their three biting muscles
(Additional file 2) reinforces arguments that the structural
division of jaw muscles may allow for functional diversification [28,42-44]. This possibility is strongly supported
by the observations that the evolution of the mechanical
advantages employed by the A1, A2, and A3 have not been
significantly correlated during the damselfish radiation
(Figure 5), and that none have experienced significant levels of phylogenetic constraint (Additional file 6). The lack
of correlated evolution among the MA values employed
by these muscles has implications for evolutionary-developmental studies of the functional anatomy of fish feeding, since recent work suggests that independently
functioning divisions of fish biting muscles can develop
from a single larval jaw adductor [45]. Our preliminary
inspections of larval damselfish skulls (unpublished) also
indicate that pomacentrid jaw adductors develop from a
single muscle.

The bite force exerted by a muscle is determined by both
its mass and the mechanical advantage it employs during
contraction. We have demonstrated that the evolution of
the simple mechanical advantages employed by the three
damselfish biting muscles have not been correlated, but
Hulsey et al. [46] determined that the evolution of the
muscle masses of these same elements has been highly
correlated in the cichlid fishes (Perciformes, Cichlidae) of
Lake Malawi in East Africa, a lineage that is closely related
to the damselfishes [47-49]. These studies have examined
different components of the same biting mechanism in
two different fish clades of markedly different ages [the
Lake Malawi cichlid radiation is only 1–2 my old; [50]].
Whether or not the evolution of the bite forces generated
by the different AM muscles of these lineages have experienced correlated evolution within either clade is
unknown, and invites further investigation.
Jaw opening MA values are generally low and they have
the narrowest range compared to the other MA parameters
calculated (Additional file 2). The scores for this parameter do, however, show some ability to differentiate
between trophic groups (Additional file 4). The correlation between lower jaw length and CV 1 and RW1 (Figures
3 and 4), the fact that herbivores and planktivores tend to
cluster separately on this axis, and the significantly different jaw opening MA scores of these two groups (Addi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/24

tional file 4), support the conclusion that the trophic
differences associated with changes in jaw opening MA
values are caused primarily by variation in lower jaw
length (outlever), as opposed to differences in the size of
the angular process of the lower jaw (the jaw opening
inlever).
Trophic evolution and kinematic transmission
Damselfish KT values exhibited a higher frequency of correlated evolution than did their MA values (Figure 5), and
except for protrusion KT, a lower connection with damselfish trophic evolution than most of the MA values
(Additional file 4). That protrusion KT was determined to
be an important, and quickly evolving (low level of phylogenetic signal), aspect of damselfish jaw kinesis supports
the idea that that the advantages conferred by the development of highly kinetic jaws are chiefly embodied within
the utility of having protrusible premaxillae. Functional
variability in the efficiency with which motion is transmitted through the jaw linkages of damselfishes may be predominantly directed at jaw protrusion, whereas selection
may be able to individually target the MA parameters
examined here due to a higher level of evolutionary independence.

Previous descriptions and simulations of jaw mechanics
in wrasses (Perciformes, Labridae) have demonstrated
that specific maxillary KT values may be associated with a
range of fish jaw morphologies [14,20,51]. This is seen in
our damselfish data as well (Figure 3 and Additional file
3), but in contrast to previous work with labrids [5,52], we
do not find that maxillary KT values are significantly correlated with trophic ecology in pomacentrids (Additional
files 3 and 4). The fact that the same maxillary KT value
can be associated with multiple morphologies has been
interpreted as support for the idea that morphological
diversity may not always be an accurate predictor of biomechanical diversity, or in other words, that there may be
a "many-to-one" relationship between form and function
[14,51,53-55]. We disagree with this approach and do not
interpret our results as support for this concept. Maxillary
rotation in the perciform jaw linkage contributes to
mouth opening and produces upper jaw protrusion, yet
the timing, direction, force and speed of these actions are
also determined by many additional anatomical features,
and the use of KT ratios to determine functional equivalence has a number of important problems.
One issue with examining convergence (a more traditional name for many-to-one-mapping) using KT values is
the fact that the variable is a ratio, and so by definition
will assume a similar value with multiple (indeed infinite)
combinations of numerator and denominator. So for KT
ratio, a many to one relationship is part of the definition
of the variable. It is important to recognize that the use of
ratios can result in analytical issues such as spurious corPage 12 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:24

relation [51-56], and that such concerns might also apply
to our analyses of kinematic parameters due to the fact
that the lower jaw rotation angle and lower jaw length are
the denominators in all KT and MA calculations, respectively. However, if the use of KT and MA ratios are used as
heuristics of feeding performance, rather than assessing
more complex biomechanical trends such as functional
equivalence, then we suggest that their use is justified.
The recent application of many-to-one mapping using
four-bar linkages extrapolates biomechanical similarity
between disparate organisms, but does this by focusing on
only a small part of the integrated and complex system of
movements and structures that are employed during perciform fish feeding. We suggest that this is not appropriate, as similar maxillary KT values do not confer
functional equivalence between different jaw morphologies, because differences in jaw adductor anatomy, tooth
shape, premaxillary structure, and overall body size, to
name but a few features, combine with particular maxillary KT values so as to produce the trophic morphology
and behaviour of a perciform fish. The many-to-one concept may have something to offer students of functional
morphology, but we suggest that it can only be usefully
applied to integrated systems as a whole, and that its
application to isolated functional components such as a
KT ratio of a linkage system has limited utility in evolutionary studies of biomechanics.
The significant association of high protrusion KT values
with planktivory (Additional files 3 and 4), and the clear
connection between those planktivores with the highest
values for this parameter and a particular type of skull
morphology that has evolved independently multiple
times (A. hirundo, C. punctipinnis, L. tapeinosoma, P. obtusirostris, and T. jordani; Additional file 3, Figures 2 and 3),
suggest that certain mechanisms for transmitting motion
through jaw linkages may require, or at least tend to
employ, particular anatomical configurations. Our data
indicate that there is a tight and biomechanically defined
link between structure and the functional ecology of fish
jaws, and that maxillary KT plays an important but not
uniquely determinant role in this association. More
detailed structural and functional analyses of the primary
kinematic variables involved in fish biting (e.g., jaw bone
rotations, the production of gape and upper jaw protrusion), combined with the heuristic predictions of speed
and motion tracking that modelling provides, and direct
performance measures such as kinematic feeding studies,
are required to assess levels of convergence and phylogenetic independence among these key traits across a wide
range of taxa.
Jaw kinesis and trophic diversification
Changes in the biomechanics of the maxilla and premaxilla have been a major component of the trophic diversifi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/24

cation of the Pomacentridae. The A1 muscle retracts the
maxilla, and the MA values associated with its insertion
point have the largest maximum value and the greatest
range of values of the three biting muscles (Additional file
2). The movement of the maxilla controls the protrusion
or retraction of the upper jaw via a ligamentous connection to the dentigerous arm of the premaxilla, and the efficiency of premaxillary protrusion was the only kinetic
parameter that distinguished among damselfish trophic
groups. Differences in the length of the ascending arm of
the premaxilla (i.e., the potential for upper jaw protrusion) are also associated with CV1 and RW1, the axes significantly distinguish between trophic groups and explain
the greatest amount of pomacentrid skull shape variation
and which (Figures 3 and 4).
This important association of maxillary and premaxillary
kinesis with the functional and morphological diversity of
the Pomacentridae reflects a much broader pattern in the
evolution of fish feeding. The highly kinetic linkages
within the jaws of many fishes are derived from much
more static anatomical configurations. The maxilla and
premaxilla were formerly fused within an upper jaw that
moved as a single unit, and which was not protrusible
[56,57]. Instead of acting as a linkage that transmits
motion from the lower jaw to the premaxilla, the maxilla
formerly participated directly in biting. This continues to
be its function within the skulls of many osteichthyans,
including the tetrapods and a large number of fish lineages, especially those that are most basal [58]. A more
mobile maxilla whose rotation plays an important role in
jaw protrusion has arisen more than once among the
ancestors of successful teleost fish groups [59]. These
include fishes within two very successful lineages: the
extremely large and loosely defined Perciformes (the
perch-like fishes), and the Cypriniformes [carps and minnows; [59]].
Both of these radiations display extraordinary levels of
diversity, incorporating several thousand species, and
they have both undergone massive radiations in trophic
ecology [43,58-61], a portion of which is seen within the
perciform damselfishes. Morphological changes have produced an important degree of diversification in the biomechanics of damselfish maxillae and premaxillae, and
these alterations constitute a major component of the biomechanical changes that are clearly associated with differences in their trophic ecology (Additional files 4 and 5).
Morphological and biomechanical studies of another fish
group, the Labridae (wrasses), have demonstrated that the
biomechanics of the maxilla and premaxilla have also
been of great importance during the extensive trophic
radiation of this diverse lineage [4,5]. It seems probable
that the expanding body of work focused on the evolution
of fish jaw biomechanics will determine that changes in

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:24

upper jaw kinesis will have strongly influenced the success
of many fish lineages that possess highly mobile jaws.
The damselfishes as an example of a reticulate adaptive
radiation
Although the evolution of multiple aspects of damselfish
jaw biomechanics has progressed under low levels of constraint, most of the members of this lineage occupy one of
only three major feeding niches [Additional file 1; [10]].
Almost all damselfishes have been classified as either herbivores, planktivores, or omnivores that consume both
filamentous algae and small animal prey that are not
highly elusive. Examples of the prey taken by omnivorous
damselfishes include fish eggs (both demersal and planktonic), zooplankton (including fish and crustacean larvae), and small invertebrates such as polycheate worms,
amphipods, hydroids, anthozoans (their polyps and tentacles), tunicates, and the occasional fish ectoparasite
[10,62-65]. There are a small number of exceptions to this
general pattern. Cheiloprion labiatus and Plectroglyphidodon
johnstonianus feed almost exclusively upon scleractinian
coral polyps, although they do not excavate the skeletons
[62], Abudefduf septemfasciatus and Nexilosus latifrons will
both take in some degree of hard shelled prey [63,66], and
some highly territorial species that have been described as
herbivores have been shown to take in large amounts of
detritus [67]. These known exceptions account for < 2.0%
of the damselfish diversity [10]. There are no piscivorous
damselfishes, nor do they specialize on any other elusive
prey larger than zooplankton. There are no explicitly
durophagous pomacentrids, no adult damselfishes feed
extensively on fish ectoparasites, and none are known to
nip scales, fins, mucus or pieces of flesh from other animals. Damselfishes rarely feed upon organisms that
require any subjugation, and they have a very limited
capacity to puncture or crush their prey.

Blomberg et al. [36] suggested that the presence of a low
level of phylogenetic signal among the characters of a lineage may indicate an adaptive radiation, but if this is true
in the case of the damselfishes, then we have a relatively
old (at least 50 my) adaptive radiation whose crown
group has progressed in only three primary ecological
directions. The solution to this apparent contradiction lies
in examining how frequently damselfishes switch trophic
habits. Character mapping indicates that all three of the
major pomacentrid trophic groups contain members of
several different damselfish lineages that have evolved
these habits independently [68,69]. Among the Pomacentridae, herbivory and omnivory have both arisen seven
times, planktivory four times, and feeding on scleractinian coral polyps twice [68,69]. Part of this pattern can be
seen in Figure 2, although this schematic shows only a
portion of the 104 species examined by Cooper [68,69].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/24

We find that damselfishes are readily able to evolve their
head morphology and jaw biomechanics so that they can
shift their feeding habits between herbivory, planktivory,
and a limited type of omnivory, but that they have demonstrated little ability to invade other feeding niches. Questions regarding the evolution of damselfish skull
biomechanics must therefore be directed at two different
aspects of this process: rate and direction. Our evidence
indicates that the damselfishes have experienced a low level
of constraint on the speed with which they have repeatedly
converged on only three primary ecological states.
Have the damselfishes undergone an adaptive radiation?
This term is typically used to refer to a lineage that has
diverged so as to produce descendant species that occupy
a wide variety of ecological niches [70,71]. Classic examples of these amongst the vertebrates would include the
cichlid fishes of the East African rift lakes [50], Darwin's
finches in the Galapagos Islands [72], and the Anolis lizards of the Caribbean [73-75].
The Caribbean Anolis lineage, whose more than 300 species have repeatedly evolved only 4 primary ecotypes over
30–40 million years [73-75], represent a case where
repeated evolutionary convergence on a limited number
of trophic states has been considered to represent an adaptive radiation despite limited ecological divergence. There
appear to be two different classes of adaptive radiations,
the classic example, where morphological divergence at
speciation has produced a wide range of anatomical and
ecological diversity (e.g., Darwin's finches, East African rift
lake cichlids), and cases in which morphological divergence at speciation has been associated with the repeated
convergence on a limited number of ecotypes (e.g., Caribbean Anolis, damselfishes). We apply the term reticulate
adaptive radiation to describe the second class, and use it to
refer to lineages whose evolutionary patterns are characterized by rapid and repeated shifts between a limited
number of eco-morphological states. Determination of
the factors that cause a rapidly evolving and successful lineage to produce a reticulate pattern of adaptive radiation,
as opposed to a steadily increasing their eco-morphological diversity, clearly invites further study.

Conclusion
The use of a single set of homologous coordinates to analyze both the anatomical and mechanical aspects of the
functional morphology of damselfish feeding provided
two useful and reciprocally illuminating arrays of information. The results of both types of analysis indicate that
the morphological and biomechanical adaptations associated with damselfish planktivory represent a major component of their trophic diversification. Whereas plankton
is estimated to form a large percentage of the diets of
approximately one third of all pomacentrid species [10],

Page 14 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:24

the description of planktivorous damselfish head anatomy and biomechanics is of strong importance for understanding the ecology of both the Pomacentridae and the
reefs that they occupy.
The independent evolution of the MA parameters associated with the different damselfish biting muscles, the
finding that, in several damselfish species, these separate
muscles employ very different MAs during jaw adduction,
and the pattern of rapid divergence that is pervasive in history of damselfish trophic evolution, all suggest that the
division of the single, ancestral adductor mandibulae has
promoted functional diversification. Changes in jaw kinesis have likewise been of fundamental importance to the
evolution of damselfish feeding, particularly those
changes that are associated with the efficiency of jaw protrusion. We found a tight correspondence between skull
morphology and jaw biomechanics, and no support for
functional equivalence between multiple anatomical configurations among the Pomacentridae. It is our hope that
further evolutionary studies of perciform bite mechanics
will rigorously test the alternative hypotheses of "manyto-one mapping" and the functional uniqueness of different skull morphologies.
The trophic evolution of the damselfishes is characterized
by rapid and repeated shifts between a small number of
trophic niches, and we use the term reticulate adaptive
radiation to describe this pattern. We suggest that the
rapid eco-morphological evolution of a lineage need not
be coupled with a rapid expansion into an increasingly
greater number of niches. It is our belief that investigation
into the factors that either link or decouple the rapid evolution of eco-morphological characters with/from the
ecological expansion of a clade will be a productive area
of future investigation.
The Pomacentridae represent only a small component of
the tremendous perciform radiation, an incredibly diverse
lineage of roughly twelve thousand species that dominates many of the worlds aquatic systems, and which represents one of the most successful branches of the
vertebrata. The accumulation of knowledge about the
functional morphology of feeding within this group has
seen a dramatic increase in recent years [e.g.,
[4,5,12,13,20,52,76-84]], and broad patterns of evolution
are beginning to emerge. Further work will allow us to
determine which modes of evolution have been prevalent
during the expansion of the Perciformes. Phylogenetic
comparative analyses of morphological and biomechanical data constitute a powerful approach to studying evolution, and future endeavours that combine these
techniques show great promise for determining the means
by which specific anatomical changes have generated ecological diversity via functional divergence.
