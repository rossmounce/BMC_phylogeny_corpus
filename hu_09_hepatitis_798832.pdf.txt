Abstract
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is prevalent in China and screening of blood donors is mandatory. Up to
now, ELISA has been universally used by the China blood bank. However, this strategy has
sometimes failed due to the high frequency of nucleoside acid mutations. Understanding HBV
evolution and strain diversity could help devise a better screening system for blood donors.
However, this kind of information in China, especially in the northwest region, is lacking. In the
present study, serological markers and the HBV DNA load of 11 samples from blood donor
candidates from northwest China were determined. The HBV strains were most clustered into B
and C genotypes and could not be clustered into similar types from reference sequences.
Subsequent testing showed liver function impairment and increasing virus load in the positive
donors. This HBV evolutionary data for China will allow for better ELISA and NAT screening
efficiency in the blood bank of China, especially in the northwest region.

Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) poses a great threat to humans,
with serious consequences including liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and polyarteritis nodosa [1]. This
infection is prevalent in Asia, Africa, Southern Europe and
Latin America [2]. Roughly 2 billion people, one-third of
the world's population, have serological evidence of past
or ongoing infection with HBV. Approximately 5-10% of
infected adults and 80-90% of children become chronic
carriers of HBV [3,4]. China has been heavily affected over
a considerable period of time; consequently about 10% of
the population are carriers or sufferers [5].

Because of the high prevalence of HBV, the blood bank of
China must screen donors for HBV infection [6]. All samples from blood donors are tested for HBV surface antigen
(HBsAg) and alanine amino transferase (ALT). HBsAg is
currently identified by ELISA, and ALT is tested for using
dynamic enzyme methods. Undoubtedly, such screening
is instrumental in reducing the risk of HBV transmission
through blood transfusion [7]. However, as mutations can
occur in different viral stains, ELISA occasionally fails to
detect HBV-infected donors [8-11].

DNA tests have revealed that HBV strains from blood
donors vary in different geographical areas. Occult HBV
infection, which threatens the safety of blood transfusion,
is linked at least in part to the genetic distance of the viral
strains [12]. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HBV in a large
number of blood donors has identified HBV DNA-positive but HBsAg-negative donors, providing a unique
opportunity to investigate HBV infection in more detail
[13,14].
Although the DNA test is superior to ELISA and can overcome some of its disadvantages, in China the higher cost
and imperfect protocols have prevented widespread use.
Consequently, until now, ELISA has remained the major
testing method in China. To improve HBsAg testing, it is
necessary to probe HBV virus evolution, because evolutionary analysis will help to promote ELISA innovations
[15]. However, data about HBV evolution in Chinese
donors, especially in the northwest region of China, is not
yet available, creating a hurdle for the development of
more efficient testing.
Here we reported that 11 HBV strains from northwest
China blood donor candidates were mostly clustered into
B and C genotypes. These pathogens, which appear to
have developed from a common parent, could not be
clustered into similar genotypes from the reference
sequences. This points to a high mutation frequency of
HBV. Follow-up testing showed liver function impairment and increased virus load in these positive donors.
Our research has supplied HBV evolution data and will
pave the way for improving ELISA and NAT screening in
the blood bank of China.

and run through an automatic biochemistry analyzer
(Hitachi, Japan) using Kit (Shanghai Fousun Long March
Medical Scince.Co.Ltd. China).
2.3 DNA analysis
NAT was adapted for the current study as previously
described [16]. Briefly, 120 donor blood samples were
divided into 10 pools with 12 samples each pool. DNA
from the blood samples was extracted according the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Germany) and mixed [16].
Real-time PCR was used to detect HBV in each pool, following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germany). If a positive reaction was observed, the pool was
divided into 6 samples and real-time PCR was repeated. If
there was a second positive test, each individual sample
was tested. After that, quantitive PCR was employed for to
quantify viral load.

As Katsoulidou et al. described [17], positive samples were
genotyped using nest-PCR. Briefly, the first-round PCR
primers (outer primer pairs) and second-round PCR primers (inner primer pairs) were designed on the basis of the
conserved nature of nucleotide sequences in the regions of
the pre-S1 through S genes. At the end, agar electrophoresis was employed to discern genotype.
11 HBV DNA reactive samples were randomly picked out
(hereafter referred to as donors 1 to 11). From these samples, HBV DNA was extracted from 1.0 mL of serum using
a kit (Qiagen GmbH, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, sequence analysis, beginning
from the S region of HBV genome, was performed by an
external company (Sunbiotech. Ltd China) using an ABI
sequencing system.

Materials and methods
Blood donor recruitment and sample collection
120 donors, negative for anti-HCV and anti-HIV antibodies, were analyzed. All recruited donors were unremunerated volunteers from either urban or rural areas. They
were medically assessed and via a questionnaire denied
any known risk factors for viral infection. Donors found
to be HBV carriers were also asked to give follow-up blood
samples for further study. The study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Fourth Military Medical University
and written informed consent was obtained from the participants.
HBV serological marker determination
Testing for HBV serological markers, including HBs, antiHBs, anti-HBe, HBe and anti-HBs, were performed by
ELISA using an automatic enzyme detection system
(Tecan, Swiss) and a commercial kit (InTec Products,
China) according to the manufacturers' protocols. For the
quantitative detection of the markers, serum from blood
donors was applied to AXSYM MEIA (Abbott Diagnostics,
Germany). To measure the ALT level, serum was separated

Phylogenetic analysis
HBV genome phylogenetic analysis was performed by
multiple sequence alignment using the ClustalW v1.83
program [18]. For this purpose, HBV sequences from the
donors and reference sequences from the GenBank database http://www.ncbi.nih.gov were aligned.

Results
NAT screening of 11 HBV-infected donors
To screen the HBV-infected donors, NAT was employed
based on real-time PCR. In the first round of screening,
there were 6 positive pools (Fig. 1A, 60%). A single positive HBV sample was eventually identified by repeat realtime PCR. There were 12 reactive blood donors, representing about 9% of all the recruited donors.

Next, HBV DNA load in the positive donors was measured. As shown in Figures 1B and 1C, donors 3, 4, 5 and
7 had several hundred virus copies, while donors
1,2,6,8,9,10 and 11 had lower virus loads.

Figure 1
NAT screening of 11 reactive samples from 120 blood donors
NAT screening of 11 reactive samples from 120 blood donors. To screen the HBV infected donors, NAT was
employed. 120 donor blood samples were divided into 10 pools with 12 samples in each pool. Real-time PCR was used on each
pool. If a positive reaction was observed, the pool was narrowed until a single reactive sample was detected. Quantitive PCR
was then performed against positive samples. A, reactive sample counts of each pool in the first round of detection; blank represents HBV-reactive sample counts and black is the total sample counts in the pool; B, lower HBV DNA copies of reactive
samples in the NAT-reactive samples; C higher HBV DNA copies of reactive samples in the NAT-reactive samples.

The serological and personal data of the HBV DNA-reactive donors are noted in Tables 1 and 2. Consistent with
virus load, donors 3, 4, 5 and 7 had higher ALT levels
(Table 1 and Fig. 1C), which were all beyond the upper
limit (20 IU.L-1) for blood donors formulated by China.
On the other hand, serological marker analysis of HBV in
the samples showed that donors 3 and 4 were more contagiousness, as they were HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBc
positive (Table 2). Although HBsAg in donor 6 was nega-

tive (Table 2), HBV DNA testing proved there were few
virus copies (Fig. 1B).
The major HBV strains in local donors were B and C
genotypes
HBV strains vary in different regions and different strains
may contribute to ELISA test failure. To further discern the
HBV type in the infected samples, all 11 positive samples

underwent HBV genotyping by PCR (Fig. 2A). 9 virus
strains, from approximately 81% of all the positive samples, belonged to the B or C group, but 2 D genotype
strains (19%) were also observed (Fig. 2B). Furthermore,
the HBV DNA load in cases with the C subtype was higher
than that in the B or D genotypes (Fig. 1B and 1C).
HBV strains from local donors evolved from common
parents
HBV has evolved in recent years. This evolution has
resulted in blood transfusion transmission because of
ELISA test failures. Since most of the HBV strains in the
current study belonged to the B or C genotypes, we further
sequenced the HBV-DNA positive samples to make a phylogenetic appraisal. Fortunately, all the strains were successfully sequenced. Then, a phylogenetic tree was made,
joined by reference sequence from GeneBank using Clustal W 1.83 software. According to the tree, the 2 donor
samples belonging to the D genotypes (donors 2 and 10)
were highly homogenic, while the 4 C strains (donors 3,
4, 5 and 7) came from a common 'parent' (Fig. 3). With
the 5 B strains, the situation was more complex. Although
they derived from the same root, two evolutionary directions were identified. As shown in Figure 3, the virus strain
from donors 1 and 8 was clustered, while the strain from
donors 6, 9 and 11 belonged to another group.

Infection of HBV-positive donors worsened in the following
3 years
To monitor HBV infection after the preliminary analysis,
we tracked the positive blood donors in the following
years. Two years later, donor 6, who was negative reaction
in the preliminary serological test, became reactive against
HBsAg, while the other donors displayed increased positive markers of infection (Table 3). Repeat ALT testing
showed that the liver function of these donors was, at least
partly, impaired (Table 4). We noted that the level of ALT
in donor 3 decreased because she received anti-viral therapy (Table 4). Virus load was serially quantitated by realtime PCR. As shown in Table 5, the number of virus copies
increased in all reactive donors, except donor 3 (who was
being treated). Once again, several hundred HBV copies
were detected in donor 6.

Discussion
NAT has been globally adopted in blood banks to detect
infectious pathogens, especially in developed nations
[16]. With a proper pool size, it can detect several virus
copies in a sample. In this way, the testing window period
of pathogens, which is one of the most important risk factor in transfusion medicine, can be overcome. However,

On the whole, however, the strains could not be clustered
into a similar subtype using reference sequences, which
proves the high mutation rate of HBV.

due to lower numbers of virus copies during early stages
of infection, NAT sometimes produces false negative
results. Consequently, pool size becomes a key factor in
interpreting NAT. In the current study, our NAT system
could detect 10 copies of HBV. This sensitivity was enough
to detect the virus in a 6-sample pool.
Other disadvantages have prevented the wider uptake of
NAT [19]. One complex issue is how to determine the
appropriate blood donor pool size [20,21]. We screened
11 reactive samples from 120 blood donors using NAT.
The samples were divided into 10 pools and each pool
contained 12 samples. In effect, 3 real-time PCRs were run
before the single reactive sample was found. If we made
larger pools, perhaps more real-time PCRs would have
been performed, given the high prevalence of HBV in
China. We found that the test results from NAT were
almost perfectly consistent with ELISA testing (9.16% V.S
8.33%, P > 0.05), although the latter failed in donor 6 due
to lower HBV virus copy numbers. We therefore agree

with earlier authors that ELISA can be used as the first
round test and NAT in the second round analysis [22].
In 1988, Okamoto et al. categorized HBV into A, B, C and
D types according the genome sequence diversity [23].
There are now 8 known genotypes of HBV, from A to H,
with a genome difference greater than 8% [24,25]. Genotypes A, B, C and D are all observed in China. Consistent
with other reports, we confirmed that the B and C genotypes are the most common in China [26]. Genotype of
HBV is significant to prognosis and test strategy [27]. We
found that blood donors with the C genotype had higher
virus loads and more serious liver impairment in the following years, which is consistent with the findings of
other researchers [28].
According to our serological data, the 11 positive samples
could be divided into two major groups: 6 subjects
(54.5%) were anti-HBc positive without detectable antibodies to surface antigen, whereas 3 (27.2%) were posi-

tive for both anti-HBc and anti-HBs. These results indicate
that occult HBV infection can occur in blood donors
[29,30]. It has been reported that occult HBV infection
without anti-HBs is more dangerous because cases of
transmission by donations carrying anti-HBc without
anti-HBs have been documented, while no evidence of
transmission has been found when donors were both
anti-HBc and anti-HBs reactive [31,32].
Phylogenetic analysis is a method commonly used to trace
virus evolution [33]. With HBV, an evolutionary tree can
be drawn from a partial sequence or the whole genome
[34]. We made a genome tree and, surprisingly, found that
the strains in our region could not be clustered into similar types using reference sequences. The reason may be the
high mutation rate of HBV, for which there is considerable
supporting evidence [35,36]. However, virus subtypes B
or C, which were found in the present study, are clues suggesting different evolutionary roots. We likewise did not
detect recombinant HBV strains, which have occasionally
been reported as intertypes [37,38]. Recombinant HBV
strains, if present, might contribute to the diverse phylogenetic profile in our region. On the other hand, the virus
strains we detected that were of the same type had clearly
developed from the same progenitors, which suggested
that local HBV evolution had specific characteristics. This
phenomenon is relevant for both ELISA and NAT
improvement.
In summary, the 11 HBV strains from northwest China
blood donor candidates which we identified were mostly
clustered into B and C genotypes. These organisms could
not be clustered into similar types using reference
sequences. Follow-up testing showed liver function
impairment and increasing virus load in the positive
donors. The study provides evolutionary data about HBV

in China and could lead to improvements in ELISA and
NAT screening efficiency in the blood bank of China.
