Abstract
Background: The mitochondrial genomes of plants generally encode 30-40 identified proteincoding genes and a large number of lineage-specific ORFs. The lack of wide conservation for most
ORFs suggests they are unlikely to be functional. However, an ORF, termed orf-bryo1, was recently
found to be conserved among bryophytes suggesting that it might indeed encode a functional
mitochondrial protein.
Results: From a broad survey of land plants, we have found that the orf-bryo1 gene is also
conserved in the mitochondria of vascular plants and charophycean green algae. This gene is
actively transcribed and RNA edited in many flowering plants. Comparative sequence analysis and
distribution of editing suggests that it encodes ribosomal protein L10 of the large subunit of the
ribosome. In several lineages, such as crucifers and grasses, where the rpl10 gene has been lost from
the mitochondrion, we suggest that a copy of the nucleus-encoded chloroplast-derived rpl10 gene
may serve as a functional replacement.
Conclusion: Despite the fact that there are now over 20 mitochondrial genome sequences for
land plants and green algae, this gene has remained unidentified and largely undetected until now
because of the unlikely coincidence that most of the earlier sequences were from the few lineages
that lack the intact gene. These results illustrate the power of comparative sequencing to identify
novel genomic features.

Background
The mitochondrial proteome consists of at least 1000 different proteins. The genes encoding many of these proteins were initially encoded within the original respiring
endosymbiont but have undergone intracellular transfer
to the nucleus over evolutionary time, so that the proteins
must be targeted back to the mitochondrion to perform
their function. The number of retained mitochondrial
protein-coding genes varies widely among eukaryotes,

from 67 in the jakobid Reclinomonas americana [1] to only
3 in apicomplexans such as Plasmodium falciparum [2].
Genes retained in the mitochondrion encode proteins
involved in fundamental mitochondrial processes such as
electron transport, ATP synthesis, gene expression, and
protein maturation/import. In Reclinomonas mitochondria, genes for the translational machinery comprise the
largest single category, with 27 ribosomal protein genes
[1].

In streptophytes (vascular plants, bryophytes, and charophycean green algae), the mitochondrial genome typically
contains about 30 to 40 protein-coding genes of identified
function. Approximately 20 of these genes are universally
present, whereas the others (or a subset thereof) have
been lost from various plant groups [3]. Genes encoding
ribosomal proteins and subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase complex are most commonly absent [3],
although loss or pseudogenization of other genes, such as
cox2 [4,5], nad7 [6,7], atp8 [7], and cytochrome c biogenesis subunits [7,8] has occurred as well. Typically, a gene
is deleted from the plant mitochondrial genome only after
successful transfer of a copy to the nucleus, although
examples exist where loss is correlated with functional
replacement of a "native" mitochondrial ribosomal protein by a nucleus-encoded plastid or cytosolic homolog
[9,10]. The timing of migration of mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes to the nucleus during eukaryotic evolution can be followed by comparative analysis [11,12].
The mitochondrial genomes of seed plants are particularly
large and recombinogenic. They contain many potential
unknown open reading frames (ORFs) which have often
been annotated as such in genomic sequencing projects
when longer than 100 codons. However, most of these
ORFs are not broadly conserved, which has brought into
question their potential functionality. Moreover, it is not
uncommon for plant mitochondrial DNA rearrangements
to give rise to novel chimeric ORFs in specific lineages,
and in certain instances such ORFs are correlated with
mitochondrial dysfunction in the form of cytoplasmic
male sterility [13]. On the other hand, a few ORFs have
shown conservation among plants, and over recent years
these have been upgraded to known mitochondrial genes.
This list includes atp4 [14,15], atp8 [15-17] and mttB (or
tatC) [18,19], which previously were denoted as orf25,
orfB, and orfX, respectively. Within the three complete
non-vascular plant mitochondrial genomes, there is
another unidentified conserved ORF, named orf-bryo1 in
the hornwort Megaceros aenigmaticus [7], orf187 in the
moss Physcomitrella patens [20], and orf168 in the liverwort
Marchantia polymorpha [21], suggesting that it may in fact
code for a functional mitochondrial product in plants.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/265

unnamed predicted protein from cDNA analysis
(XP_002332837) was also identified from Populus trichocarpa. Interestingly, the moss orf187 shows weak similarity to ribosomal protein L10 from several bacteria,
including Rickettsia prowazekii and other members of the
alpha-proteobacteria, the lineage from which mitochondria originated [25], as well as to mitochondrial L10 from
the jakobid Reclinomonas americana, a protist that possesses the most "primitive" and gene-rich of all mitochondrial genomes [1]. These observations suggested that the
moss orf187 (and its homologs) might encode mitochondrial L10 in plants. Indeed, annotated L10 domains can
be found in the GenPept records for Physcomitrella orf187
(BAE93086) and Chlorokybus orf295 (ABO15139).
A variety of computational and experimental approaches
were used to determine the distribution of mitochondrial
rpl10-like sequences among streptophytes, and the results
are summarized in Figure 1. To extend the database
search, tblastn queries were conducted against the nucleotide nr and EST-others databases at GenBank. Indeed,
homologous unannotated ORFs are present within the
complete mitochondrial genomes of the charophyte
Chara vulgaris, [26], the gymnosperm Cycas taitungensis
[27], and the angiosperm Carica papaya (EU431224) as
well as in partial mitochondrial genome entries for the
angiosperms Solanum lycopersicum and Helianthus annuus.
In addition, several truncated and/or frameshifted
sequences were identified in the mitochondrial genomes
of Brassica napus, Oryza sativa, and Bambusa oldhamii, suggestive of recent erosion of the rpl10-like gene. Searches of
the EST-others database also revealed numerous
homologs from a wide range of angiosperms as well as
two gymnosperms, Picea glauca and Welwitschia mirabilis.
Their high nucleotide similarity to counterparts identified
in completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes of other
seed plants suggests that these are in fact encoded in the
mitochondrial genome, unless there has been extremely
recent gene transfer to the nucleus. One exception is a
divergent rpl10-like sequence from the fern Adiantum
capillus-veneris (DK949045) that has an amino-terminal
extension of 25 residues with a weak predicted mitochondrial targeting signal, and might therefore be nuclearlocated.

Results and Discussion
Mitochondrial orf-bryo1 is conserved across streptophytes
To determine whether this bryophyte mitochondrial ORF
might be more widespread among plants, blastp searches
were performed using these three protein sequences to
query the NCBI protein database. A homolog was found
in the completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes of
the angiosperms Nicotiana tabacum (orf159b) [22] and
Vitis vinifera (orf159) [23] and, albeit with low sequence
similarity, in the charophytes Chaetosphaeridium globosum
(orf126) [8] and Chlorokybus atmophyticus (orf295) [24]. An

To determine how widely this mitochondrial rpl10-like
gene is represented in seed plants and to gain more insight
into the prevalence and timing of apparent pseudogenization in certain lineages, a PCR survey was undertaken
using primers designed from the angiosperm and gymnosperm sequences identified above. Sequencing revealed
the presence of this gene in another 24 seed plants, of
which 5 were pseudogenes (Figure 1). Overall, these
results show that homologs to the orf-bryo1 gene can be
found across virtually all major streptophyte lineages,

Figure 1 of mitochondrial rpl10-like sequences in streptophytes
Distribution
Distribution of mitochondrial rpl10-like sequences in streptophytes. Functional genes, pseudogenes, and genes lost
from the mitochondrion are shown as filled squares, open squares, and open circles, respectively. Genes with evidence for
expression as determined by RNA editing status are marked with a plus symbol. The 'nuc?' note next to the Adiantum sequence
indicates that it may be encoded in the nucleus. The origin of each sequence is given in parentheses using the following abbreviations: E - EST sequence from GenBank; G - genome sequence from GenBank; N - nucleotide sequence from GenBank; P PCR product generated during this study; R - RT-PCR product generated during this study. Phylogenetic relationships are
taken from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website [55].

We have also established that the mitochondrial rpl10-like
gene is expressed and edited in angiosperms (Table 2).
The cDNA sequences obtained from four angiosperm species (Aristolochia, Artemisia, Breynia and Ceropegia) all
showed C-to-U RNA editing at between 5 and 8 sites,
which verifies that they were derived from RNA template
rather than contaminating mitochondrial DNA. In addition, 7 edit sites were identified for Citrus by comparison
of its EST and gene sequences. Editing in all 5 plants predominantly alters the encoded amino acids, with each
coding sequence having only one silent editing event. Furthermore, these non-synonymous editing events improve
protein similarity of the angiosperm sequences to one

Angiosperm orf-bryo1 homologs are transcribed, edited
and likely encode a functional mitochondrial L10
At the DNA level, the mitochondrial rpl10-like gene
appears to be functional in a very wide range of streptophytes, and the derived amino acid sequence alignments
for selected species are shown in Figure 2. Amino acid
conservation is higher in the amino-terminal region than
at the carboxy-terminus, and the latter also shows variation in length, in keeping with features also common to
L10 proteins in non-plants (see below). The initiation
codons for Cycas and Megaceros are predicted to be generated by C-to-U RNA editing of ACG to AUG. Within the
Megaceros coding sequence, three potential stop codons
are presumably removed by U-to-C RNA editing prior to
translation, as previously postulated for many Megaceros

mitochondrial transcripts including orf-bryo1 [7]. To
assess whether the coding sequences are under functional
constraint, the ratio (ω) of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) divergence was calculated for all pairwise
sequence comparisons between 6 representative streptophytes (Table 1). In all 15 cases, ω was less than 1 consistent with purifying selection acting to maintain the protein
sequences. The average over all tests was 0.39 with a high
of 0.62 between Marchantia and Cycas and a low of 0.19
between Chara and Cycas.

although it should be noted that lycophytes are not represented in this data set and no homologous sequences were
detected in the mitochondrial data recently presented for
Isoetes engelmannii [28]. Notably, the rpl10-like gene
appears to have been independently lost at least five times
during angiosperm history: from the asterid Pentas, from
the caryophyllid Beta, from the crucifers Arabidopsis and
Brassica, from monocots, and from the conifer Podocarpus.

In Figure 2, the amino acid alignment of plant and charophycean green algal mitochondrial orf-bryo1 homologs
also includes the Reclinomonas americana mitochondrionencoded L10 protein and homologs from the eubacteria
Escherichia coli, Rickettsia prowazekii, and Thermotoga maritima. The L10 ribosomal protein is universally present in
the ribosomes of eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, and
the crystal structure of L10-L7/L12 stalk has been determined [34]. It is worth noting that the amino-terminal
domain is more highly conserved than the carboxy-terminal half. For example, the Rickettsia prowazekii and E. coli
L10 proteins share only about 26% amino acid identity
over their full length, whereas the beta-1 to alpha-5 region
(of 85 amino acids) within the amino-terminal half
shows ~35% identity. It is the amino-terminal domain of
L10 (or more specifically, the alpha-1 to alpha-3 region)
that binds directly to the large subunit ribosomal RNA,
whereas the carboxy-terminal domain of L10 (and alpha8 in particular) interacts with the L7/L12 stalk; together
with L11, this complex plays a key role in recruiting translation factors to the ribosome and stimulating GTP
hydrolysis [34,35]. The flowering plant mitochondrial
L10 proteins share about 23% amino acid identity with
the Rickettsia L10 homolog over the amino-terminal beta1 to alpha-5 region of 85 amino acids, compared to 2728% identity seen between Rickettsia L10 and the comparable region of the Physcomitrella or Reclinomonas mitochondrial counterparts. Of particular note are several
highly conserved blocks that are believed to be important
for protein structure [34]. They contain Gly (and Pro) residues for beta-turns between beta1-alpha2 and alpha4beta3 in L10 proteins of eubacteria and archaea. Interestingly, 7 of 8 positions of RNA editing lie within conserved

Cha.

another and to species that are known to have infrequent
editing, such as Physcomitrella [29], or no editing, as for
Marchantia [21] and Chara [26]. This pattern of editing is
characteristic for functional plant mitochondrial genes
but not necessarily for pseudogenes [30], and most
unconserved ORFs are not edited at all [31-33]. The rpl10like EST sequences provided further evidence of transcription, although in the absence of accompanying DNA
sequence information the evidence is less certain. The EST
sequences from Petunia, Theobroma, and Zinnia generally
have T at confirmed edit positions and therefore likely
derive from genuine RNA rather than mitochondrial DNA
contamination, although it cannot be excluded that some
of these T residues are already encoded in the genome. In
contrast, homologs based on EST data from additional
plants lack several expected edits and reflect either mitochondrial DNA contamination or partially edited transcripts (data not shown). In total, rpl10-like sequences
from 8 distantly-related angiosperms provide strong evidence for appropriate expression at the RNA level (Figure
1).

blocks, consistent with their functional importance, a
hallmark of RNA editing in plant mitochondria [36].
In bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic cytosolic ribosomes,
the amino terminal domain of the L10 protein is known
to bind specifically to helices H42, H43, and H44 of the
large subunit rRNA [34,35], and in plant mitochondria,
this helical region of the 26S rRNA has retained the correct
structure for L10 binding and is very highly conserved
among streptophytes (Figure 3). Indeed this stretch of 80
nt is identical in sequence among most seed plants and
there has been only one nucleotide substitution relative to
either the Physcomitrella or Marchantia homolog, that is,
during a period of about 400 million years. Thus, it seems
likely that a conventional L10 protein (or at least for the
amino-terminal portion) will be present in plant mitochondrial ribosomes.
Status of mitochondrial L10 in grasses and crucifers
For the reasons discussed above, one might expect that all
seed plants would possess a mitochondrial-type rpl10
gene either within the mitochondrion or alternatively

within the nucleus since the simplest explanation for cases
of gene loss from the mitochondrion (see Figure 1) is that
successful gene transfer to the nucleus has occurred. Curiously, no mitochondrial-type L10 protein sequences were
detected in tblastn searches of the completely sequenced
nuclear genomes of Arabidopsis [37] or rice [38,39].
However, both these genomes do contain duplicated copies of the chloroplast-derived rpl10 gene (data not
shown). In land plants, the chloroplast rpl10 gene is
located in the nucleus, and proteomic analysis of spinach
chloroplast ribosomes has established its precise protein
content [40]. The chloroplast L10 orthologs in Arabidopsis (NP_196855) and rice (NP_001049761) share about
70% amino acid identity (excluding the acquired N-terminal targeting extensions). In contrast, the second chloroplast-type L10-related copy shows only ~41% amino acid
identity between the Arabidopsis (NP_187843) and rice
(NP_001054498) counterparts, and these proteins are
predicted to be localized in the mitochondrion based on
targeting programs such as TargetP [41], PSort [42], and
Predotar [43] Interestingly, the two Arabidopsis chloroplast-derived L10 paralogs are more closely related to each
other (~58% identity) than are two rice ones (~46% identity), suggesting a more recent duplication event in the
crucifer lineage. This would also be consistent with their
independent recruitment as functional substitutes for the
mitochondrial L10 protein at different times during
angiosperm evolution, although it cannot be formally
excluded that gene conversion events in the Arabidopsis
lineage contribute to the higher sequence similarity.

Figure 3
to L10 ribosomal protein
Sequence and structure of the LSU rRNA region that binds
Sequence and structure of the LSU rRNA region that
binds to L10 ribosomal protein. Shown are helices H42,
H43 and H44 of the LSU rRNA. The primary sequence
shown is a consensus of this mitochondrial 26S rRNA region
from Marchantia, Physcomitrella, and numerous seed plants,
with differences shown in red. Positions that differ between
plant mitochondria and bacteria (represented by E. coli) are
shaded in gray. Yellow shading indicates compensatory
changes in E. coli that maintain base pairing in stem regions.
Nucleotide coordinates are shown for Triticum aestivum
mitochondrial 26s rRNA [56] and in parentheses for E. coli
23s rRNA [34,35].

Although the duplicated chloroplast-type L10-related
gene is an attractive candidate to serve as a replacement in
the mitochondrial ribosome for those plants which lack
the "native" mitochondrial rpl10 gene, these proteins in
Arabidopsis and rice lack a number of the expected conserved residues, ones that are observed in the plant mitochondrion-encoded genes. Alternative possibilities are
that the chloroplast L10 might be dual targeted to both
the plastid and the mitochondrion or that the cytosolic
ribosomal protein L10 counterpart (called L10e or P0)
has been recruited. It is perhaps even possible that plants
such as rice and Brassica, which possess what appear to be
remnant pseudogene fragments in the mitochondrion,
actually have several short genes (mitochondrial or
nuclear) that generate a discontinuous L10 protein structure, a phenomenon observed for the mitochondrial rpl2
gene in certain flowering plants [44]. Finally, it is worth
noting that non-homologous proteins have been known
to perform molecular mimicry in the evolution of the
large ribosomal subunit among eubacteria and archaea
[45].

Conclusion
In summary, these observations provide strong evidence
that a functional rpl10 gene exists in the mitochondrion of
many streptophytes. Despite the fact that there are now
over 20 streptophytes with complete mitochondrial
genome sequences, this gene has been missed until now
due to the unlikely coincidence that most of the plant
mitochondrial genomes that were first completely
sequenced - the crucifers Arabidopsis thaliana [46] and
Brassica napus [33]; the grasses Oryza sativa [32], Zea mays
[47] and Triticum aestivum [48]; and the sugar beet Beta
vulgaris [49] - are from lineages where this gene has been
lost or pseudogenized. Only with the more recent
sequence data from diverse streptophytes such as Cycas
taitungensis [27], Physcomitrella patens [20] and Megaceros
aenigmaticus [7] does the general pattern emerge that this
gene is in fact widely present. Indeed, the bryophyte orfbryo1 sequences were particularly informative in bridging
the evolutionary distance between mitochondrial L10
gene homologs in seed plants and those of charophycean
green algae/protists, which nicely illustrates the power of
obtaining sequence information from diverse organisms
in order to reconstruct events related to gene and genome
history.

Methods
Total genomic DNAs and RNAs were isolated using the
DNeasy and RNeasy Plant Mini Kits (QIAGEN) from leaf
tissue available in the living collection of the Beadle
Center Greenhouse (University of Nebraska). To prepare
first-strand cDNA, RNAs were treated with DNase I (Fermentas) to remove contaminating DNA and then reverse
transcribed using M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas) and random hexamers (Fermentas) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Sequences for rpl10 were amplified from DNA or cDNA by
polymerase chain reaction using GoTaq DNA Polymerase
(Promega) and forward primer F1 (5'-ATGCCATTCGGAAGAAGTMT) with reverse primer R159 (5'-TTAGGTGGTATYCCGAGATYGA)
or
R148
(5'GGAACACACGAAASAAAGATATRAAC). Each reaction
was run on a DNA Engine Dyad (Bio-Rad) for 35 cycles
(30 sec at 94°C, 1 min at 48°C, 2 min at 72°C), with an
initial step of 3 min at 94°C and a final step of 10 min at
72°C. Amplified products were sequenced on both
strands at the High-Throughput Genomics Unit (University of Washington). Sequences generated in this study
were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
GQ402491-GQ402514; additional sequences used in the
comparative analysis were downloaded from GenBank
(Table 3).

fied by comparison of DNA sequences with cDNA and/or
EST sequences. To examine levels of functional constraint,
poorly-aligned regions were first identified and removed
using Gblocks 0.91b [52], then pairwise dN and dS were
computed in MEGA 4.0.2 [53] using the Nei-Gojobori
Model with a Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple hits.

Note added in proof
Another group has independently discovered the rpl10
gene in the mitochondrial genome of plants [54]. Similar
to our study, Kubo and Arimura find that the mitochondrial gene is widely distributed among plants, is transcribed and RNA edited in multiple species, and has been
lost from several lineages, including Arabidopsis and rice.
These authors suggest, as we do, that a duplicated copy of
the nucleus-encoded chloroplast rpl10 gene has functionally replaced the lost mitochondrial rpl10 gene independently in Arabidopsis and rice. For both species, they
experimentally show that these putative mitochondriallyfunctioning L10 proteins have targeting signals that
indeed induce localization to the mitochondrion, and
also the chloroplast.

Authors' contributions
JPM conceived of the study, performed experimental and
computational work, analyzed results, prepared figures
and tables, and drafted the manuscript. LB also performed
computational analyses, analyzed results, and helped
draft the manuscript. Both authors read and approved the
final manuscript.
