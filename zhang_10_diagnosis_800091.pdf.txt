Abstract
Background: Orf virus (ORFV) is the etiological agent of contagious pustular dermatitis and is the prototype of the
genus Parapoxvirus (PPV). It causes a severe exanthematous dermatitis that afflicts domestic and wild small ruminants.
Case presentation: In the present study, an outbreak of proliferative dermatitis in farmed goats. The presence of ORFV
in tissue scrapings from the lips was confirmed by B2L gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The
molecular characterization of the ORFV was performed using PCR amplification, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis of the B2L gene.
Conclusion: The results of this investigation indicated that the outbreak was caused by infection with an ORFV that
was closely related genetically to Nantou (DQ934351), which was isolated from the Tai wan province of China and
Hoping (EU935106), which originated from South Korea in 2008. This is the first report of the phylogenetic analysis of
ORFV from goats in China.
Background
The ORFV is the prototype member of the genus
Parapoxvirus, which also includes pseudocowpox virus
(PCPV) in cattle, bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV)
in cattle, squirrel parapoxvirus (SPPV) and parapoxvirus
of red deer in New Zealand (PVNZ) [1,2]. Contagious
pustular dermatitis is a common viral skin disease that
occurs in a range of species, not only in wild ruminants
[3] but also in humans [4-6]. Humans with immunodeficiency diseases, in particular, can develop serious infections [7]. The diseases caused by ORFV have worldwide
distribution and have been reported from many countries
[1].
The disease not only has an economic impact on farmers worldwide but also has a considerable negative effect
on animal welfare. Infected animals are sickly, fail to
thrive, and are more susceptible to adventitious bacterial
infections [8]. The typical progress of orf in goats and
sheep moves from erythema, via vesicle formation, to
pustules and then to scabs. Characteristic of the disease

are proliferative and often self-limiting lesions on the skin
of the lips, on the oral mucosa and around the nostrils.
Lesions can also be found occasionally on the teats of
nursing animals and rarely on other organs[9]. Depending on the location of the lesions, animals may be unwilling to nurse, eat, or walk [10]. Primary lesions usually
resolve spontaneously within 3-4 weeks [11]. The mortality rate related to orf is usually low, but it may be very
high in small ruminants, especially when bacterial or fungal secondary infections occur [12,13]. The ORFV
genome consists of linear double-stranded DNA (134139 kb) [14]. The envelope gene (B2L) of the ORFV
encodes for a highly immunogenic envelope protein of
about 42 kDa [15]. A conventional PCR method that is
based on the amplification of the B2L gene has been used
for the detection of ORFV by PCR [1,16,17]. Molecular
characterization and phylogenetic analysis [1,18,19] have
been based on the complete sequence of the B2L gene.
In recent years, outbreaks of orf have occurred worldwide [1]. Although outbreaks of orf have occurred in
China and have been confirmed, there are few reports
available of the detailed molecular characteristics and
phylogenetic analysis of the viruses involved. We report
an outbreak of ORFV infection in goats from the Hubei
province of the People's Republic of China in which the
ORFV was verified by PCR of the full-length B2L gene.

Comparative sequence analysis of the B2L gene from this
outbreak of orf was carried out, and the phylogenetic
relationship of the virus with other ORFV sequences
available in GenBank was determined. This is the first
report of the phylogenetic analysis of an ORFV in China
in comparison with other isolates from other regions.

Case presentation
The outbreak reported in this study originated on a goat
farm (114.52° E, 29.6° N) in the Hubei province of the
People's Republic of China. On 23 March 2009, the
farmer bought 655 goats from free-ranging herds and
transported them a distance of about 800 km to the farm.
On the third day, two goats presented with nodular
lesions on the lips, tongue and around the mouth; there
were 30 goats showed tubercular lesions three days later.
To 31 July 2009, the incidence was approaching 60% and
the mortality rate was 24.7% (162/655), although antiviral and antibiotic medicines were administered in the
drinking water, by intramuscular injection or orally.
Two goats with typical clinical signs were selected and
euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium.
Complete post mortem examinations were performed
and the macroscopic changes were recorded. Small samples of diseased tissue, about 6-8 mm3, were removed
carefully from the nodular lesions using a sterile scalpel
and stored in a sealed plastic tube with 50% glycerin
Phosphate Buffered Saline(PBS) at 20°C until analysis.
Primers designed for the amplification of the full length
of the B2L gene [20,21] were synthesized (Takara dalian
Co., Ltd). Tissue scrapings collected from the infected
goats were triturated in 0.1 M PBS (1:10 V/V) and freezethawed twice between -20°C and 37°C, then placed at 4°C
overnight. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min at
4°C, DNA was isolated from the clarified supernatant
using a Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega) and
used as template in the PCR procedures. Tissue scrapings
of healthy goat were treated with the same procedures
and used as negative control.
Comparison of the B2L sequences with those available
in the GenBank database was performed using the online
BLAST programs. The sequence identities of nucleotides
and amino acids were analyzed by the ClustalW method
[22]. A phylogenetic tree based on the deduced amino
acid sequences was constructed by the neighbor-joining
method with 1000 bootstrap replicates using MEGA version 4.0 [23].
Discussion and Conclusion
The clinical signs seen in the goats included: multifocal to
coalescing papillary, verrucose, proliferative, and ulcerated lesions in the epidermis of the muzzle and lips (Fig.
1). No visible lesions were found in other locations.

The orthodox methods of diagnosis that depend on
pathologic examinations and clinical signs are inaccurate,
virus isolation is thought to be a gold standard but it's
time-consuming[14]. With the development of molecular
biology, the PCR technique has become widely used to
amplify the desired genomic fragments from tissue specimens, and it has become a powerful tool in molecular
diagnosis. The PCR method is able to diagnose ORFV
infection in field specimens from affected animals [2]. To
confirm whether the causative agent was present in skin
scrapings, PCR of the complete B2L gene was used in this
study. The expected PCR fragments, approximately 1137
bp in length, were obtained from DNA which had been
extracted from tissue scrapings; no fragments were
obtained from the negative control (Fig. 2). To ensure the
validity of the sequence as far as possible, DNA probest
Taq enzyme was used in the PCR, and the PCR products
were amplified directly from the skin scrapings. To gain
further information about the virus, we sequenced the
PCR product. The results showed that the B2L gene was
1137 bp in length and encoded 379 amino acids. The
G+C ratio was 63.3%, which is consistent with the whole
genome of the virus [1,24]. Sequences of the B2L gene of
the virus were submitted to NCBI GenBank and assigned
the accession number GU320351.
Using nucleotide sequences of the complete B2L gene
stored in GenBank (Table 1), the phylogenetic relationships were explored using the neighbor-joining method
and bootstrap analysis (Fig. 3). The results demonstrated

analysis was performed with 1000 trials. All sequences were collected
from GenBank. The red spot indicates CHINA ORFV, isolated in this
study.

that the CHINA/Goat/2009 isolate obtained from this
outbreak was closest to the Nantou (DQ934351) isolate
obtained from the Tai wan province of China in 2006 and
the Hoping (EU935106) isolate, which originated from
South Korea in 2008 (Fig. 3). The percent identities and
diversities of the deduced amino acid sequence of the B2L
gene among the different strains of ORFV were calculated (Table 2) using the MegAlign function of DNASTAR software. The sequence analysis revealed high
nucleotide and amino acid identity among the isolates
from different countries; they shared 95.3%-99.7%
sequence identity at the amino acid level. This is consistent with the fact that the central region of Parapoxviruses is generally conserved.
Orf is endemic in China, although a vaccination program has been performed to control the disease. Between
1980s and 1990s, orf occurred in eight provinces of China
including Qinghai, Gansu, Tibet, Xinjiang, Liaoning,
Jiangxi, Heilongjiang and Hebei. In recent years orf happened in the following provinces Innermongolia

(Jun.2005), Guangxi (Mar.2005), Shanxi (Apr.2005),
Fujian (Aug.2005), Jilin (Mar.2006), Jiangsu(Nov.2006)
and Beijing city (Apr.2006). More seriously, in 2005 there
were seven women and four men were infected by ORFV
in Fujian province. So, orf is a national zoonoses in China.
In this study, we diagnosed an outbreak of orf in Chinese
goats and determined its phylogenetic characteristics on
the basis of the complete gene sequence of the major
envelope protein (B2L). We conclude that the Chinese
ORFV involved in this outbreak was closely related phylogenetically to Nantou (DQ934351) and Hoping
(EU935106). This is the first report to provide phylogenetic information about an ORFV strain in China, which
will be of use for prospective studies in public health.
