by multilocus sequence typing

Abstract
Background: Although many strain typing methods exist for pathogenic Escherichia coli, most have drawbacks in
terms of resolving power, interpretability, or scalability. For this reason, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is an
appealing alternative especially when applied to the typing of temporal and spatially separated isolates. This
method relies on an unambiguous DNA sequence analysis of nucleotide polymorphisms in housekeeping genes
and has shown a high degree of intraspecies discriminatory power for bacterial and fungal pathogens.
Results: Here we used the MLST method to study the genetic diversity among E. coli O157 isolates collected from
humans from two different locations of USA over a period of several years (2000-2008). MLST analysis of 33 E. coli
O157 patient isolates using the eBurst algorithm distinguished 26 different sequence types (STs), which were
clustered into two clonal groups and 11 singletons. The predominant ST was ST2, which consisted of 5 isolates
(14.28%) followed by ST1 (11.42%). All the isolates under clonal group I exhibited a virtually similar virulence profile
except for two strains, which tested negative for the presence of stx genes. The isolates that were assigned to
clonal group II in addition to the 11 singletons were found to be phylogenetically distant from clonal group I.
Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between the virulence profile of the isolates and their clonal
origin.
Conclusions: Our data suggests the presence of genetic diversity among E. coli O157 isolates from humans shows
no measurable correlation to the geographic origin of the isolates.

Background
Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O157 has emerged
as a public health threat following its initial identification as a pathogen in a 1982 outbreak of illness associated with the consumption of undercooked ground
beef [1]. Specifically, E. coli O157:H7 and O157:NM
(nonmotile) are recognized as major etiologic agents in
hemorrhagic colitis (HC) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. This enteric organism is able
to secrete Shiga toxin, a binary toxin that affects the
endothelium of the kidney, gut and brain that can result
in glomerular vascular damage, bloody diarrhea, and
brain edema, distinguishing it from other pathogenic
strains of E. coli. STEC has been implicated as the
source of numerous outbreaks and sporadic cases stemming predominantly from consumption of bovine food

products. Transmission has also been linked to unpasteurized milk and cider, contaminated drinking and
swimming water, fresh vegetables and secondarily
through person-to-person contact. Infection due to
E. coli O157:H7 or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is
typically characterized by diarrhea, abdominal cramping
and hemorrhagic colitis. Hemolytic uremic syndrome
and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are less
common, but severe sequelae of infection.
The public health impact of EHEC infections is high
because of systemic complications from infections, such
as HUS (an important cause of acute renal failure in
childhood), late post-infection sequelae[2] and the ability
of STEC to cause large outbreaks. To date, EHEC O157:
H7 has caused hundreds of outbreaks worldwide [3].
The largest known outbreak on record occurred in
Japan, in Sakai City, in 1996[4], where thousands, mostly
school children, were affected. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that E. coli O157:
H7 causes approximately 73,400 illnesses and 60 deaths

each year in the United States[5]. Cattle are a major
reservoir of E. coli O157:H7[6], but additional potential
reservoirs of this pathogen include sheep, goats, pigs,
horses, dogs, poultry, and deer[7-10].
The ability to identify accurately and track the strains
of infectious agents that cause disease is central to epidemiological surveillance and public health decisions,
but there are no wholly satisfactory methods of achieving this goal[11]. All of the numerous methods that are
currently used suffer from one or more significant drawbacks, including inadequate discrimination, limited availability of reagents, poor reproducibility within and
between laboratories, and ability to quantitatively define
genetic relationships between isolates. However, perhaps
the most important limitation of current typing methods
is the difficulty of comparing the results achieved by different laboratories.
Molecular typing methods are used to address two
very different kinds of problems. First, for short-term or
local epidemiology, the isolates recovered from a localized outbreak of disease need to be accurately grouped
using previously characterized isolates as benchmarks.
Second, for long-term or global epidemiology, pathogenic strains collected over relatively long time periods
and/or from disparate geographic regions must be correctly classified as related or not to those isolated
world-wide. Different methods may be appropriate for
investigating local and global epidemiology, but in both
cases they should be discriminatory enough so that isolates can be classified.
High specificity levels of isolate strain identity can be
achieved in two different ways. In one approach, individual loci, or uncharacterized and dispersed regions of
the genome, that are highly variable within the bacterial
population are identified. For bacterial pathogens, several methods based on this approach are currently popular, e.g., ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE), and PCR with repetitive element primers, or
arbitrary primers [11]. For these methods, restriction
enzymes (or PCR primers) are chosen that yield maximal variation within the population; consequently, the
variation that is indexed is evolving very rapidly, usually
for reasons that are not clear. The second approach,
typified by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE),
is to use variation that accumulates very slowly in the
population and is likely to be selectively neutral.
Although only a small number of alleles can be identified within the population by using this type of variation, high levels of discrimination are achieved by
analyzing multiple loci.
Methods that index rapidly evolving variations are
useful for short term epidemiology but may generate
misleading results when applied in a global epidemiological survey. Several studies have shown that techniques

Page 2 of 11

such as PFGE resolve isolates that are indistinguishable
by MLEE. For example, MLEE studies of populations of
Salmonella enterica have shown that isolates of serovar
Typhi from typhoid fever belong to one of two closely
related electrophoretic types (ETs)[12]. In contrast, isolates of serovar Typhi are relatively diverse according to
PFGE[13]. PFGE is therefore useful for studying individual outbreaks of typhoid fever because, unlike MLEE, it
identifies the microvariation (some of which is caused
by transient or unstable genetic elements or regions i.e.
phages, transposons, genetic rearrangements, repetitive
elements etc) that is needed to distinguish between
strains circulating within a given geographic area. However, this technique is not well suited for long term
epidemiology (and occasionally for short term epidemiology for reasons described above) because it does
not indicate that isolates that cause typhoid fever are
members of a single globally distributed clonal lineage
of S. enterica. Metaphorically, PFGE and other similar
methods may cause epidemiologists not to see the forest
for the trees.
The best current techniques for long term epidemiology, and for the identification of lineages that have an
increased propensity to cause disease, is undoubtedly
MLEE. This approach also has contributed greatly to
our understanding of the global epidemiology and population structure of infectious agents. For many pathogens, MLEE successfully has identified clusters of closely
related strains (clones or clonal complexes) that are particularly liable to cause disease[11]. However, a major
problem with MLEE, and virtually all other current (gelbased) typing methods, is that the results obtained in
different laboratories are difficult to compare.
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) uses nucleotide
sequences of internal fragments of selected genes as the
unit of comparison and, therefore, does not suffer from
the drawbacks of gel-based fingerprinting methods.
Sequence data are unambiguous, more easily comparable, and transferable between laboratories and are
highly reproducible[11]. Furthermore, the digital format
of MLST data has facilitated the establishment of global,
web-accessible databases for a variety of organisms and
is rapidly contributing to our understanding of the clonal distribution of infectious disease agents. The most
commonly used MLST schemes index the nearly neutral
genetic variation in housekeeping genes, which are
believed to evolve slowly because they are for the most
part, under stabilizing, selective pressure. MLST is thus
a powerful tool for global and long-term surveillance.
Various authors [13-16] have reported the use of
MLST methodology for the study of E. coli, particularly
the serogroup O157. These authors have reported use of
various house keeping genes for analysis of E. coli O157
strains by MLST. The development of an effective

Rajkhowa et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:343
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/343

MLST scheme for subtyping E. coli O157:H7 has been
hindered in the past due to lack of sequence variation
found within analyzed housekeeping and virulence
genes. A recent study suggested that rhs genes are
under strong positive selection pressure and therefore,
may be useful markers for phylogenetic analysis of
E. coli O157:H7 [15-17]. EHEC differ from EPEC in that
they produce Shiga toxins but not bundle-forming pili.
The same authors also reported that E. coli with the
O157 O antigen are not always EHEC but may belong
to other pathotypes. They also described two serogroups
of O157 E. coli strains from Brazilian infants with diarrhea and shown with variety of assays that those strains
belonged to the enteropathogenic, not the enterohaemorrhagic pathotype. The putative virulence factors of
O157:H7 strains, the ability to produce Shiga-like toxins
and adhere to epithelial cells, also exist in other groups
of E. coli [18].
In this study we have performed MLST on a set of
E. coli O157 clinical isolates obtained from two different
locations of USA to determine whether (or not) any
genetic diversity exists among the isolates.

Results
Multilocus sequence analysis

Nucleotide sequence analysis of unlinked housekeeping
genes (multilocus sequence typing) is widely used for
evolutionary and population analysis, and also for epidemiological investigations. Since differences in the
sequences of essential housekeeping genes are thought
to display long-term genetic changes, we used this technique to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of
E. coli O157 clinical isolates obtained from New York
State and Pennsylvania State of USA. DNA sequences of
corresponding housekeeping genes from the O157:H7
strains EDL933 (accession no. NC_002655) and Sakai
(accession no. NC_002695) were compiled from the
respective published genome sequences and used as
reference strains for this study. Sequence data from
each isolate, including the two published strains, was
then garnered from each of the nine loci. Forward and
reverse sequence reads from each locus were aligned
and edited.
Analogous to other MLST schemes, we assigned the
allele numbers to each unique allele sequence for each
of the nine loci investigated. The number of alleles identified for the 33 E. coli O157 isolates varied from 3 to 14
per gene; ompA generated the least number of alleles
(3 alleles), while pgm generated the most (15 alleles).
The combinations of allele numbers for all isolates are
shown in Table 1. Each unique combination of allele
numbers represents one sequence type (profile). The
allelic diversity found at the nine loci resulted in 26
unique ST for the 33 isolates. Five (14.28%) of these

showed MLST profile 2, four isolates (11.42%) showed
MLST profile 1 and the remaining 24 strains fell into
MLST profile 3 to 26.
Figure 1 shows a dendrogram drawn by using Tree
drawing, a web-based software used for displaying phylogenies in the form of tree dendrograms. From the
dendrogram it has been observed that the isolates in 12
profiles (ST1, ST2, ST5, ST6, ST7, ST10, ST13, ST14,
ST15, ST16, ST25 and ST26) are found to be closely
related to the reference strains EDL933 and Sakai in
comparison to rest of the isolates in the study. Isolates
no. 27 and 28 (ST21 and ST22) are also closely related
to each other.
Analysis by eBurst revealed two non-overlapping
groups or clonal complexes, consisting of related isolates
sharing identical alleles at eight out of the nine loci with
at least one other member of the group (Figure 2). The
relatedness among the 33 E. coli O157 isolates was also
analyzed with SplitsTree, an alternative algorithm for
the analysis and visualization of evolutionary data that is
not always best represented by a standard tree. The
SplitsTree graph (Figure 3) showed a clustering of
strains highly similar to those obtained with both the
eBurst algorithm and dendrogram (based on Neighbor
Joining Method).
Analysis of virulence markers

All E. coli O157 isolates were investigated for the presence of virulence genes associated with EHEC (Table
2). All isolates were also screened for the presence of
bfpA gene (which is associated with typical EPEC),
because of the growing evidence that some EHEC share
common genes with EPEC. All isolates except for two
(isolate no. N6 and N9) were positive for at least one of

the Shiga toxin genes (either stx1 or stx2 or combination of both). eaeA and hlyA genes were carried by
78.78% and 60.60% of the isolates, respectively. None of
the isolates were found to be positive for bfpA.

Discussion
Molecular epidemiology is largely descriptive and characterizes bacteria based on their natural genetic variation. A number of molecular methods have been
employed to determine this variation, which may be due
to mutation or horizontal gene transfer events. Basically

two branches of molecular epidemiology can be distinguished, classification and typing. Classification can
illustrate evolutionary relationships and groups species
into clonal groups or complexes, whereas typing is used
more often for differentiation of clinical or environmental isolates. Long-term epidemiology may require classification, whereas short-term local epidemiology is more
often performed by high resolution typing methods.
While the most prominent methods for molecular classification are MLST and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis[11], PFGE or PCR-based methods such as randomly

amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR, AFLP or virulence
gene characterization, have been used frequently for typing approaches[19]. In our study, we used MLST in
combination with PCR detection of selective virulence
genes for classification of pathotypes and for phylogenetic analysis of E. coli O157 isolates. The isolates were
collected from patients over a period of several years
(2000-2008) from two different states of the United
States of America., Some of these isolates were associated with outbreak cases.
In our study, MLST analysis of nine genes (seven
housekeeping genes and two membrane protein coding
genes) revealed 26 profiles from 33 E. coli O157 isolates.
Analysis by eBurst revealed two clonal groups or clonal
complexes (clonal group I and II). All the isolates in clonal group I were closely related to reference strains
EDL933 and Sakai. It has also been observed that the
leading markers of clonal group I are the presence of
stx1 and/or stx2 genes, eaeA gene and hlyA gene, characterizing them as typical STEC. The only difference
was that the isolate N29 and N32 were negative for the
presence of the hlyA and eaeA genes, respectively. We

also observed that, of the nine loci investigated, the pgm
gene generated the highest number of alleles, which
could be due to use of a larger DNA fragment for
amplification of the pgm gene in the study.
One surprising finding of our study is that although
the isolates N6 and N9 were negative for stx genes still
they belonged to the same clonal group along with the
EDL933 and Sakai strains. It is possible that these
strains might have lost the phage-borne stx genes upon
subculture as reported for other STEC[20,21]. Spontaneous loss of both stx1 and stx2 genes in vitro has also
been described in E. coli O157:H7 clinical isolate[22].
The timing of the stool sample collection is also very
important for finding Stx producing strains in patients
with HUS. Tarr et al. demonstrated that if the stool
samples of patients with HUS were cultured within
6 days after onset of diarrhea for EHEC O157:H7, the
recovery rate was nearly 100% [23]. This rate decreased
to 33.3% in stool samples collected >6 days after the
onset of diarrhea. Mellmann et al. also demonstrated
that EHEC are difficult to identify in patient’s feces at
late stages in illness[24].

Friedrich et al. has proposed two possible explanations
for the findings of stx-negative E. coli O157 strains
related to sporadic cases of diarrhea and HUS and to
outbreaks[25]. First, stx-negative E. coli O157 strains are
thought to have evolved from stx-positive E. coli O157
of an original infection by loss of stx genes during the

course of infection. Alternatively, E. coli O157 strains
that are inherently stx-negative from the beginning
might be responsible for the disease in these cases.
Maintaining the Stx-encoding phage may adversely
affect or be lethal to the bacterium when changes occur
in normal environmental conditions or may become so

when in the human host during the course of infection.
Survival might be favored by loss of the phage, since
stx- progeny of stx+ progenitors are less prone to lysis.
Mammalian host signals such as those initiated by exposure to hydrogen, can perhaps induce Stx-encoding prophages to become lytic[26]. By generating stx- mutants,
a strain can survive without automatically lysing
(because it no longer carries the lysogenic phage or the
phage-encoded toxin). The loss of stx-encoding phage
can thus offer a selective advantage.
The finding of stx-negative E. coli O157 isolates has clinical significance and is important from a diagnostic standpoint because in such cases, stx- and Stx-independent
procedures are required to detect strains that might have
lost their stx genes. Our study indicates that routine testing of stools for either Stx by ELISA or the stx genes by
PCR or merely relying on the results from culturing E. coli
O157 on sorbitol MacConkey agar, may not identify all
potentially important factors that are associated with diarrhea and HUS. The same observation was made during
recent outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the United States.
Recently Bielaszewska et al.[24] also reported that at the
time of microbiological analysis, ~5% of HUS patients no
longer shed the causative EHEC, but excrete stx-negative
derivatives of EHEC that have lost stx during the course of
infection. In such patients, the EHEC etiology of HUS is
missed using current methods, which rely solely on detecting stx or Shiga toxin which can hamper epidemiological
investigations and lead to inappropriate clinical management. Therefore, it is suggested that Stx- and stx genebased detection methods should be complemented by
additional methods for the identification of stx-negative
E. coli O157 in microbiologic evaluations.
We observed in our study that the clonal group II
consisted of only two isolates (N27 and N28) both of
which share a similar virulence profile yet their virulence profile was different from the majority of the isolates under clonal group I. We have also observed that
11 isolates did not belong to any clonal group and
instead, each isolate exhibited a different sequence type
(profile). These isolates are only distantly related phylogenetically to clonal group I. The reasons for this can
not be explained with MLST data alone; this points to
towards the need of whole genome sequencing of larger
number O157 strains. However, our present findings are
in agreement with the findings of Ogura et al. who
observed a high level of genetic diversity among E. coli
O157 strains from human isolates[27]. The greater
genetic diversity observed among E. coli O157 isolates
in our study could be due to several factors like
(i) inter-species transfer of strains to humans from farm
animals/pets, (ii) contaminated food sources
(iii) increased international travel and (iv) longer span of
sample collection period (2000-2008).

Conclusions
Our study shows that all the methods compared here
(dendrogram based on Neighbor Joining Method, eBurst
algorithm and SplitsTree) exhibited a high degree of
concordance showing a highly similar clustering pattern
for the strains thereby indicating that the sequence data
were reliable and were accurately represented by these
algorithms. Infections with EHEC O157 may involve
asymptomatic carriage or uncomplicated diarrhea, but
other outcomes include haemorrhagic colitis and HUS.
This poses considerable challenges both clinically and
for disease control measures, because the disease is not
yet treatable and colonization of humans can occur with
only a few organisms. Although there are reports on
clonal diversity and pathogenic properties of E. coli
O157 strains, the present study extends our knowledge
about the virulence spectrum and genetic relationships
of E. coli O157 isolates that were collected only from
one host (humans) over a period of several years (20002008). Phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated genetic
diversity among E. coli O157 isolates collected from
humans and thereby warrants further in-depth studies
involving a larger number of samples so that more
information about their diversity can be obtained.
Materials and methods
Bacterial isolates

A total of 33 Escherichia coli O157 isolates (23 from the
Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of
Health, Albany, New York, USA and 10 from Pennsylvania State, USA) were used in the study. The samples
were collected from the patients with HUS, diarrhea or
asymptomatic. Age group of the patients varied from
1 year to 42 years. The characteristics of the isolates
used are shown in Table 3. Reference strains used in
this study were EDL933 (accession no. NC_002655) and
Sakai (accession no.NC_002695).
Examination of virulence genes

The virulence genes were investigated by PCR as listed
in Table 2.
Selection of genes

The following seven housekeeping genes were included
in the study: arcA (aerobic respiratory control protein),
aroE (shikimate dehydrogenase), dnaE (DNA polymerase III, alpha subunit), mdh (melate dehydrogenase), gnd
(6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase), gapA (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and pgm (phosphoglucomutase). In addition to these genes, two membrane
protein coding genes espA (E. coli secreting protein A)
and ompA (outer membrane protein A) were also
included. The seven selected housekeeping genes were
chosen for their potential sequence diversity. Three of

the genes, aroE, arcA and mdh have been used to determine the evolution of pathogenic bacteria[28]. Two
genes, dnaE and pgm were chosen because they were
found to be informative for Salmonella and Vibrio cholerae[29]. The last two housekeeping genes, gapA and
gnd were chosen because they were transferred into the
O157 genome at different evolutionary times. Finally,
the two membrane proteins were chosen as being
potential targets of the immune system and presumably,
under balancing selective pressure. The primers for
these genes were from Noller et al[13] except for genes

pgm and espA. The primers for these two genes were
designed based on the published sequences from Genbank (Table 4).
DNA Isolation

E. coli isolates were obtained from a collection of strains
stored in 15% glycerol at -80°C. Isolates were incubated at
37°C on LB agar plates overnight. Single colonies were
picked and inoculated into 2 ml LB media and further
incubated in a shaking incubator for 12-15 h at 37°C. A 1
ml suspension of bacteria was centrifuged, and DNA was

extracted from the bacterial pellet with the QIAGEN
DNeasy blood and tissue kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).
PCR

Amplifications were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl
with 2 μl of template DNA (50-100 ng), 1 μl of each
20 mM primer, 5 μl 10× Accuprime PCR buffer II (Invitrogen) and 1 μl of Accuprime Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System
9700 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Primers were synthesized
by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, Iowa).
PCR conditions depended on the different target genes
and primer sequences used are depicted in Table 4.
Sequencing

PCR products were purified for sequencing with the
QIAGEN QIAquick PCR purification kit. Both the forward and reverse strands were sequenced with the PCR
primer set. Sequencing was performed at Cornell University Life Sciences Core Laboratories Centre using the
Applied Biosystems automated 3730 DNA analyzer
using big dye terminator chemistry and AmpliTaq-FS
DNA polymerase.

fragment, distinct alleles were identified and numbered by
using the non-redundant databases (NRDB) program
http://pubmlst.org/analysis/. When combined, the allele
numbers assigned to each of the nine loci constituted a
strain’s allelic profile or sequence type (ST). Thus, each
distinct allelic profile was considered a unique sequence
type. A dendrogram (based on Neighbor Joining Method)
was constructed by using the web-based data analysis tool
“Tree drawing” http://pubmlst.org/analysis/ which uses
the PHYLIP suite of programmes to generate neighborjoining and UPGMA trees from allelic profile data. eBurst,
a noncommercial algorithm previously designed for MLST
of bacterial pathogens, was used to divide the 33 E. coli
isolates into clusters of genetically related strains. The
eBurst algorithm groups strains according to their allelic
profiles by employing a user-specified group definition,
which is the number of alleles that the isolates need to
have in common to belong to the same group http://www.
mlst.net/. The relatedness among the 33 E. coli isolates
was also assessed by SplitsTree analysis[31], an alternative
algorithm for the analysis and visualization of evolutionary
data that is not always best represented by a standard tree.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

Phylogenetic analysis

Following sequencing of forward and reverse strands, the
sequences were edited and aligned using Bioedit version
4.8.10 [30] and converted into FASTA files. For each gene

The nucleotide sequences obtained by sequencing of the
PCR products of each allele of all genes have been
entered into the GenBank databases under different
accession numbers which are shown in Table 5.
