Abstract
Background: Transcriptome sequences provide a complement to structural genomic information
and provide snapshots of an organism's transcriptional profile. Such sequences also represent an
alternative method for characterizing neglected species that are not expected to undergo wholegenome sequencing. One difficulty for transcriptome sequencing of these organisms is the low
quality of reads and incomplete coverage of transcripts, both of which compromise further
bioinformatics analyses. Another complicating factor is the lack of known protein homologs, which
frustrates searches against established protein databases. This lack of homologs may be caused by
divergence from well-characterized and over-represented model organisms. Another explanation
is that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) may be caught during sequencing. NcRNAs are RNA sequences
that, unlike messenger RNAs, do not code for protein products and instead perform unique
functions by folding into higher order structural conformations. There is ncRNA screening
software available that is specific for transcriptome sequences, but their analyses are optimized for
those transcriptomes that are well represented in protein databases, and also assume that input
ESTs are full-length and high quality.
Results: We propose an algorithm called PORTRAIT, which is suitable for ncRNA analysis of
transcriptomes from poorly characterized species. Sequences are translated by software that is
resistant to sequencing errors, and the predicted putative proteins, along with their source
transcripts, are evaluated for coding potential by a support vector machine (SVM). Either of two
SVM models may be employed: if a putative protein is found, a protein-dependent SVM model is
used; if it is not found, a protein-independent SVM model is used instead. Only ab initio features are
extracted, so that no homology information is needed. We illustrate the use of PORTRAIT by
predicting ncRNAs from the transcriptome of the pathogenic fungus Paracoccidoides brasiliensis and
five other related fungi.

Conclusion: PORTRAIT can be integrated into pipelines, and provides a low computational cost
solution for ncRNA detection in transcriptome sequencing projects.

Background
Proteins are recognized as the most important players in
cell homeostasis. Due to their importance and relatively
straightforward characterization, it is expected that the
main focus of transcriptome projects will be transcripts
that code for proteins. To meet this demand, several specific computational tools have been created, both for
absolute characterization and comparative analysis of
these molecules. Only recently has attention begun to
turn to those transcripts ignored or rejected by proteinoriented software packages: the so-called non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs). Classical, textbook examples of ncRNAs
include ribosomal and transfer RNAs. More recently,
other classes have been unveiled, such as microRNAs, siRNAs, piRNAs, asRNAs and the long, mRNA-like ncRNAs,
widespread among all Domains, with evidence of ubiquitous tissue expression in plants and animals [1,2].
Demand is now arising for specific tools for working with
these molecules. A combination of new computational
tools and advances in biological knowledge allowed for
development of specific software for this purpose [3]. Currently, it is not difficult to find software designed for the
identification and characterization of individual ncRNA
classes (as we will discuss later). However, the task is still
considered complex and remains an open topic in bioinformatics.
Machine learning algorithms represent a solution for
highly accurate detection and characterization of ncRNA
patterns, and more improvements are expected as ncRNA
biological properties are determined by biochemical and
molecular experiments. Successful implementations have
been reported for siRNA [4] and miRNA [5]. The mRNAlike ncRNA, on the other hand, is arguably a class which
is harder to identify due to its resemblance to mRNA molecules: they may be capped, may undergo splicing, and
even harbor polyadenylation and ORF signals [6]. Screening of mRNA-like ncRNA is possible on prokaryotic
genomes using RNAGENiE [7]. For transcriptome contexts, there are two notable implementations: CONC [8]
and CPC [9]. Both algorithms – CONC and CPC – can distinguish mRNA from ncRNA with high accuracy. CONC
showed that putative proteins from ncRNA are distinguishable from those translated from mRNA, and CPC
improved this idea by heavily focusing on homology
information. However, their high accuracy relies on the
quality of homology information (especially CPC), and
both expect full-length sequences given the ORF translation schemes employed (especially CONC). These two

assumptions hinder the use of these programs for analysis
of transcriptomes from poorly characterized organisms
because many of their sequences lack known protein
homologs and are commonly built from low-quality, single-pass reads. Such drawbacks require special procedures
to be employed for accurate analysis because canonical
translation signals are often missing. The result is a bias
toward false negatives when the input consists of low
quality sequences because most transcripts code for unusual or truncated (but functional) proteins. Moreover,
despite advances reported on CPC, the required computational processing power and running time remain prohibitive for labs with limited budgets.
In summary, these programs may be inappropriate for
transcriptomes from neglected species. We propose new
Support Vector Machine-based software to overcome
these obstacles. EST sequencing errors, frameshifts and
truncations are taken into account and corrected by a specially designed program, and a shunt is imposed on
sequences without a predicted ORF, which are then analyzed separately. Database representation bias is eliminated by avoiding homology information and using only
ab initio features. Also, only computationally light programs were chosen for calculation of features so as to
allow pipelining from transcriptome sequencing projects
with less demands on computational processing power.

Implementation
Putative EST translation
The ANGLE software package [10] was chosen for translation of ESTs because it focuses on sequencing errors of the
input sequences and has superior performance when dealing with small sequences. ANGLE implements a hybrid
method composed of a sliding window CDS classifier
using a weak learner, a hidden Markov model coupled to
dynamic programming for determining optimal ORF path
and a frameshift detector. The dynamic programming
(DP) algorithm evaluates and punctuates putative proteins translated from the six frames; among all alternatives, the putative ORF with highest DP score is taken as
the protein product coded by the transcript. Transcripts
are separated into two groups: those with translated proteins and those that lack any putative ORF. A user-friendly
interface for ANGLE was developed in PERL and is available from the authors upon request.
Support Vector Machines settings

machine learning algorithm developed from a solid statis-

tical basis [11]. SVMs have been shown to be successful
and useful in Bioinformatics [12] and several other fields
[11].
We used the LIBSVM v2.84 implementation [13] with
Radial Basis Function kernel, which was shown to be the
best kernel to deal with this task (Liu et al, 2006), set as CSVM and binary classification problem, with the two
classes being coding (positive set) and non-coding (negative set) RNA. Optimization of parameters (C and
gamma) occurred in two runs using the accompanying
grid.py script with 20,000 randomly selected instances
from the main training set. Two models were induced separately: a protein-dependent one induced with dbTR_OP
as training data, and a nucleotide-only using dbTR_OA for
training [see Additional file 1].
Compared programs settings
PORTRAIT was benchmarked against two other classification programs: Naïve Bayes and CPC. Naïve Bayes (nB) is
a machine learning algorithm used when a wealth of
examples (or instances, or realizations) of a random variable is available, and it is desired to induce a model that
is able to explain the distribution of this data. This
induced model may be used to classify data yet unseen by
the classifier. Although very simplistic, nB is also known
to be fast and reliable, sometimes even surpassing more
sophisticated machine learning algorithms [11].

Bayesian models were induced using the software package
BC [14] with default parameters. Training was done with
the same sets, features and normalization schemes used
for SVM.
CPC [9] was installed locally and always executed with
default parameters. CPC comes pre-installed with a classification model developed by its authors, which was developed using the database created by the authors of CONC
[8].
Efficiency measures
Efficiency formulas, points for plotting ROC curves and
area under ROC curves were calculated both by using
PERL scripts and the PERF software [15].

Cross-validation is a traditional machine learning technique for estimating classifier performance by splitting
the training set into n equally-sized datasets, without element repositioning. Afterwards, each subset is trained
once and the model is evaluated on the n-1 remaining
subsets. This process is repeated n times so that each subset is used for training exactly once. We used ten-fold
cross-validation, which was carried out using LIBSVM for
SVM, and a custom PERL script for naïve Bayes.

Fungal sequences
EST sequences of organisms phylogenetically related to P.
brasiliensis (Ajellomyces capsulatus, Aspergillus niger, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans) were downloaded from
the Entrez Nucleotide Database [16] and stored as FASTAformatted files. After filtering transcripts shorter than 80
and longer than 65,335 letters, these sequences composed
the dbFG set, comprising 137,629 entries.

Results and discussion
Training set construction
Seeking to discriminate between ncRNA and mRNA, we
used Support Vector Machines (SVM) for induction of a
classification model. SVM is a supervised machine learning method, and as such, it requires previously labeled
data – the training set – for model induction (see Methods
for details). In this work, mRNAs (the positive set) and
ncRNAs (the negative set) compose the SVM training set,
called dbTR (TRaining DataBase).
Protein-coding transcripts
This set was built from the SwissProt sequences file [17]
downloaded in October 2006 (release 50.8), containing
234,112 protein sequences with high quality annotations.
Redundancy was eliminated by using CD-HIT [18] with
parameter c = 0.7. Unique accession codes were parsed
and used to retrieve corresponding cross-referenced
mRNA accession codes from EMBL [19], when present.
Parsed IDs were screened to remove repeated entries, references to whole genomes/chromosomes or invalid
entries, and subsequently used to retrieve corresponding
FASTA sequences through the EBI Dbfetch service [20].
Sequences longer than 65,535 or shorter than 80 letters
were excluded to avoid software incompatibility. Also,
this size filter eliminates many of the so-called structural
ncRNAs, like siRNAs, miRNAs, among others. Closely
related nucleotide sequences were clustered using BLASTCLUST [21] with parameters S = 0.5, L = 0.5 and W = 18.
Clustering at both amino acid and nucleotide levels is an
attempt to eliminate over-representation of frequent
homologs and protein families. Protein prediction was
carried out with ANGLE software [10]. Transcripts harboring a predicted ORF and their respective protein products
were assembled in the dbTR_OP training set, comprising
a total of 55,372 sequences. Those transcripts lacking
ORFs were assembled in the dbTR_OA set. The whole
process of positive set construction is illustrated in the
leftmost part of Figure 1.
Non-protein-coding transcripts
Files containing sequences from RNAdb [22], NONCODE
[23] and Rfam [24], currently the three most comprehensive ncRNA databases, were downloaded in October

Construction of the training database (dbTR). The dbTR comprises both negative and positive instances, and was subdivided as transcripts having identified ORFs (dbTR_OP) and transcripts lacking ORFs (dbTR_OA). Each of these subsets harbor

while dbTR_OA training subset generated the protein-independent SVM model.
2006, comprising a total of 213,849 sequences. Nucleotide redundancy removal was done using BLASTCLUST
with L = 0.5, S = 0.5 and W = 18. ORF prediction and
redundancy elimination was carried out in the same way
as in the positive set. The resulting 70,667 transcripts with
ORFs and corresponding proteins integrated the
dbTR_OP set, while remaining transcripts were merged
into the dbTR_OA set. This process is shown on the rightmost part of Figure 1.
Feature vectors
Training and testing sets must be input as numerical values to the SVM. Properties, or features, which represent
sequences as values are collectively called the feature vector. Qualitative properties are quantified, and all properties are individually normalized to real (continuous)

numbers in the range (0, 1). All features were obtained
using locally written Perl scripts, except for compositional
entropy. Normalization procedures, the number of allocated variables and references supporting each feature's
discrimination potential [25-31] are shown in Table 1 [see
Additional file 2].
SVM optimization, training and testing
dbTR_OP and dbTR_OA were further randomly subdivided on optimization, training and testing subsets,
comprising, respectively, 20,000, 30,000 and 23,976
instances for dbTR_OP, and 10,000, 20,000 and 22,002
instances for dbTR_OA. Optimization set was used to
obtain the best pair of values for two crucial SVM Radial
Basis Function (RBF) Kernel parameters, the gamma and
C, determined from a 10-fold cross-validation grid search.

**Used only on protein-independent models.
§ Used only on protein-dependent models.

Training sets were used to induce SVM models, and test
sets (from now on called dbTS_OP and dbTS_OA) were
used to estimate performances of induced models.
Efficiency measures
Estimations of model performance are evaluated by traditional methods, such as efficiency formulae, cross-validation, ROC curves and running time comparison between
related programs.
Efficiency formulas and runtime comparisons
For estimation of classifier accuracy, we used cross-validation (CV) with dbTR_OP and dbTR_OA as training/testing sets. Figures obtained for PORTRAIT and naïve Bayes
(nB) were compared to those reported in the literature for
CPC.

When only the protein-dependent model is used, PORTRAIT presents a CV accuracy of 93.3%, while the CV
accuracy for PORTRAIT using solely the protein-independent model is 90.9% (results not shown). Looking at
the CV results from PORTRAIT running with both models,
however, it had slightly worse accuracy than CPC (Table 2
– see "CV acc."). On the other hand, PORTRAIT performs
comparably to CPC (see F-measure) when used for prediction of dbTS_OP and dbTS_OA (Table 2 – see measures

other than "CV acc."). CPC has higher accuracy for identification of mRNAs (sensitivity), while PORTRAIT correctly identifies a greater amount of ncRNAs (higher
specificity). The lightweight programs used by PORTRAIT
result in a considerable speed improvement, as can be
seen in Table 2. As expected, the nB classifier had worse
performance but yielded a speed advantage over the SVMbased classifiers (PORTRAIT and CPC).
ROC curves
ROC curves (Figure 2) estimated from prediction of
dbTS_OP and dbTS_OA corroborate PORTRAIT's superior
performance when compared to nB. The area under curve
(AUC), an efficiency measure calculated from ROC curves
ranging from 0 (minimum accuracy) to 1.0 (maximum
accuracy), is 0.96 for PORTRAIT, 0.78 for naïve Bayes and
0.50 for Random classifier. CPC and CONC were
excluded from ROC analysis because of output score normalization issues and the long time taken for processing
dbTS sets, respectively.
Test sets
Induced classifiers were used to evaluate the coding
potential of transcripts from three test sets. The first one is
dbRD, comprising 3,000 randomly generated transcripts
with lengths varying from 80 to 3,000 nt. Another set is

The number of transcript sequences from the test sets predicted to be ncRNA by the classifiers is shown in Table 3.
Analysis of dbPB transcripts classified as ncRNA
Next we examined among the 6,022 transcripts from the
P. brasiliensis assembled ESTs those which were classified
as non-coding by nB, PORTRAIT and CPC, all with default
parameters. The dbPB set already has annotations attributed to its sequences, which were determined during a

project that sequenced its transcriptome [32]. During
assembly phase, transcripts assembled from more than
one EST were regarded as contigs, but if no consensus was
generated from the sequence, it was named singleton. We
assessed whether this set of potential ncRNAs was
enriched for specific annotation terms, as well as contigs
or singletons. Figure 3 shows that all classifiers tend to

Figure 3 of P. brasiliensis transcript sequences classified as ncRNA by several classifiers as a function of specific annotations
by Felipe et al. (2005)
Distribution
Distribution of P. brasiliensis transcript sequences classified as ncRNA by several classifiers as a function of specific annotations by Felipe et al. (2005). Annotations of the 6,022 transcripts [32] were considered only after classifier
prediction, so even transcripts previously manually annotated as proteins were evaluated for coding potential. A "Confident
annotation" refers to a transcript description which lacks the words: "putative", "probable" and "hypothetical". The numbers of
transcripts classified as ncRNA are shown in the legend (except for dbPB, which shows the total of Pb transcripts).

select as ncRNA those transcripts without annotation, and
that those with annotations possess terms that may question the correctness of their descriptions. These terms
were: "putative", "probable" and "hypothetical". Moreover,
the majority of these sequences are singletons.
Using the dbPB EST, PORTRAIT classified 16% as potential ncRNAs, 83% of those being unannotated sequences,
thus presenting parallel evidence that those transcripts
may not indeed code for proteins [see also Additional file
3]. It is important to note that this result corroborates
non-coding status as an independent diagnostic only for
PORTRAIT and nB, because these are the only ab initio
classifiers. Additionally, 81% of the transcripts predicted
as ncRNAs were singletons, corroborating evidence that
ncRNAs are expressed at levels lower than mRNAs and
thus tend to be assembled as singletons [1].

Conclusion
In this work we report an algorithm for identifying noncoding RNAs in a transcriptome context. The distinguishing characteristic of our approach is the focus on nonmodel organisms: by using an ORF translation program
sensitive to low-quality EST sequences, and also by choosing only ab initio features. Even if the input sequence has
been disrupted by frameshifts or indels to an extent where
ORF identification is compromised, still the query transcript may be classified as protein-coding by the protein-

independent SVM model of PORTRAIT. Therefore, our
predictions are not biased to classify as ncRNA transcripts
that may actually code for novel proteins, rare or even
absent in the databases. This may be a factor contributing
to the high specificity of PORTRAIT (Table 2). Also, our
training set includes several recent ncRNAs and mRNAs
from all life Domains, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences. These factors make our program ideal for
analysis of neglected or poorly characterized species.
Differences from the ab initio approach also show up in
the number of transcripts predicted to be non-coding in
comparison to the other classifiers (Table 3). Compared
to SVM, the nB algorithm is notably less complex and less
robust to inconsistencies in the training set. Thus, when
looking at the number of predicted ncRNAs in the dbPB
and dbFG sets, one may infer that the rules derived by this
algorithm for identifying ncRNAs are far too simple, leading a significant amount of ncRNAs to be misclassified as
mRNA (too many false positives). On the other hand,
CPC classifies all transcripts from dbRD as being non-coding. At a glance, this result seems consistent; however,
some of these randomly generated sequences could be
"real" mRNA transcripts encoding for novel proteins not
found in the databases (false negatives). This scenario is
plausible for sequences from the transcriptomes of
neglected organisms, for which very little is known and
where there is the potential for novelty. Taking this

hypothesis into account, CPC may not be suitable for this
situation because it may be biased for classifying as noncoding those transcripts lacking good hits from protein
databases. PORTRAIT emerges as a compromise between
nB and CPC: it predicts as ncRNA a reasonable number of
the transcripts from dbPB and dbFG, and also classifies
some dbRD transcripts as mRNA, despite not having
come into contact with similar sequences in the training
phase.

We propose PORTRAIT, a software for ncRNA screening in
transcriptomes. Our method is tailored to the analysis of
neglected organisms: 1) we use a 6-frame translation
scheme that takes into account sequencing errors and is
optimized for small or truncated sequences; 2) no homology information is used; 3) only lightweight programs are
used, so the method is suitable for less powerful computers. The output of the program may also provide insights
or a second opinion about the coding status of known
protein-coding transcripts. Subsequent homology analyses are up to the researcher and constitute an independent, parallel experiment.
