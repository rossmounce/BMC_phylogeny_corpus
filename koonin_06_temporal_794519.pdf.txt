Abstract
Background: The core enzymes of the DNA replication systems show striking diversity among cellular life forms and
more so among viruses. In particular, and counter-intuitively, given the central role of DNA in all cells and the mechanistic
uniformity of replication, the core enzymes of the replication systems of bacteria and archaea (as well as eukaryotes) are
unrelated or extremely distantly related. Viruses and plasmids, in addition, possess at least two unique DNA replication
systems, namely, the protein-primed and rolling circle modalities of replication. This unexpected diversity makes the
origin and evolution of DNA replication systems a particularly challenging and intriguing problem in evolutionary biology.
Results: I propose a specific succession for the emergence of different DNA replication systems, drawing argument from
the differences in their representation among viruses and other selfish replicating elements. In a striking pattern, the DNA
replication systems of viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes are dominated by the archaeal-type B-family DNA
polymerase (PolB) whereas the bacterial replicative DNA polymerase (PolC) is present only in a handful of bacteriophage
genomes. There is no apparent mechanistic impediment to the involvement of the bacterial-type replication machinery
in viral DNA replication. Therefore, I hypothesize that the observed, markedly unequal distribution of the replicative
DNA polymerases among the known cellular and viral replication systems has a historical explanation. I propose that,
among the two types of DNA replication machineries that are found in extant life forms, the archaeal-type, PolB-based
system evolved first and had already given rise to a variety of diverse viruses and other selfish elements before the advent
of the bacterial, PolC-based machinery. Conceivably, at that stage of evolution, the niches for DNA-viral reproduction
have been already filled with viruses replicating with the help of the archaeal system, and viruses with the bacterial system
never took off. I further suggest that the two other systems of DNA replication, the rolling circle mechanism and the
protein-primed mechanism, which are represented in diverse selfish elements, also evolved prior to the emergence of
the bacterial replication system. This hypothesis is compatible with the distinct structural affinities of PolB, which has the
palm-domain fold shared with reverse transcriptases and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and PolC that has a distinct,
unrelated nucleotidyltransferase fold. I propose that PolB is a descendant of polymerases that were involved in the
replication of genetic elements in the RNA-protein world, prior to the emergence of DNA replication. By contrast, PolC
might have evolved from an ancient non-templated polymerase, e.g., polyA polymerase. The proposed temporal
succession of the evolving DNA replication systems does not depend on the specific scenario adopted for the evolution
of cells and viruses, i.e., whether viruses are derived from cells or virus-like elements are thought to originate from a
primordial gene pool. However, arguments are presented in favor of the latter scenario as the most parsimonious
explanation of the evolution of DNA replication systems.
Conclusion: Comparative analysis of the diversity of genomic strategies and organizations of viruses and cellular life
forms has the potential to open windows into the deep past of life's evolution, especially, with the regard to the origin
of genome replication systems. When complemented with information on the evolution of the relevant protein folds,
this comparative approach can yield credible scenarios for very early steps of evolution that otherwise appear to be out
of reach.

Background
DNA replication is central to the reproduction of all cellular life forms and many viruses. Indeed, inasmuch as accurate DNA replication is strictly required for the faithful
transmission of the information stored in the genomes of
all known cellular life forms, it can be legitimately viewed
as the quintessential biological process, the crucial manifestation of the proverbial double helix. Furthermore,
mechanistically, the DNA replication processes in all cells,
indeed, appear to be very similar [1]. Thus, it came as an
extraordinary surprise when comparative genomics ushered in the realization that the protein components of
DNA replication systems are not at all universally conserved [2-5], in a sharp contrast to the core parts of the
translation and transcription systems that are, indeed,
shared by all cellular life [6,7]. Notably, this dramatic disparity of DNA replication systems has been predicted in
the seminal early work of Woese and Fox in the context of
their concept of the Last Universal Common Ancestor
(LUCA) of modern cellular life forms as a primitive entity,
the progenote [8].
The DNA replication systems of bacteria, on the one hand,
and archaea and eukaryotes, on the other hand, are a
peculiar mix of conserved and unrelated proteins. Notably, the central parts of the machinery, in particular, the
polymerases that are responsible for DNA chain elongation, primer formation, and gap filling after primer
removal, and replicative helicases, are either unrelated or
distantly related and are thought to derive independently
from proteins with other functions [5,9]. The conclusion
that the main replicative polymerases and primases of
archaea (and eukaryotes) and bacteria are unrelated was,
originally, reached through exhaustive protein sequence
analysis [5]. Subsequently, this conclusion received crucial support from the solution of the crystal structures of
the bacterial and archaeal primases [10-13] and replicative polymerases [14-17]. The comparison of the respective structures unequivocally demonstrated that they,
indeed, have unrelated folds. The distinction between the
archaeal and bacterial DNA replication systems is additionally emphasized by the discovery of a unique DNA
polymerase that is involved in replication in euryarchaea
[18,19]. However, several ancillary components, such as
the sliding clamp (the proliferating cell nuclear antigen,
PCNA, and its homologs), the clamp loader ATPase, and
RNAse H are represented by well-conserved orthologs in
bacteria and archaea (eukaryotes) [5].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

This unexpected divergence of cellular DNA replication
systems is, in principle, compatible with at least three distinct evolutionary scenarios each of which takes as the
focal point the nature of the replication system that is
inferred for the LUCA [5,20]. These three views of LUCA's
genome replication go as follows: i) LUCA had no DNA
replication per se but instead had a retrovirus-like replication cycle, with segments of genomic RNA reverse-transcribed into a DNA provirus, which is transcribed back
into RNA; the existence of a DNA stage would explain the
conservation of some proteins involved in DNA replication [5], ii) LUCA had one of the two of the modern types
of DNA replication systems, either (proto)archaeal or
(proto)bacterial; subsequent non-orthologous gene displacement of the key components in one of the primary
lines of descent, possibly, via a virus vector, resulted in the
current dichotomy[4,21], and iii) LUCA had both DNA
replication systems (with one, possibly, involved in
repair), with subsequent differential loss of the central
components in the respective common ancestors of
archaea and bacteria [2,4,21].
The notion of a possible contribution of DNA-containing
viruses to the evolution of the DNA replication systems of
cellular life forms has been presented in a series of publications by Forterre [21-24]. Recently, this line of thought
has been further developed in two more general treatises
each of which emphasized the integral connection
between the evolutionary histories of cells and selfish
genetic elements. The first of these studies posited that
LUCA was a cell with an RNA genome, and the transition
to the modern-type DNA replication system occurred after
the divergence of the three primary lines of descent of cellular life forms, the progenitors of bacteria, archaea, and
eukaryotes [25]. The second study laid out the argument
for a non-cellular, although complex and compartmentalized LUCA, envisaged as a stage of evolution at which the
progenitors of the main lineages of extant viruses already
coexisted with elements that gave rise to bacterial and
archaeal genomes [26]. Here I employ comparative
genomics of viruses and cellular life forms to address a
specific aspect of the evolution of DNA replication systems, namely, the temporal order of their emergence, and
discuss the conclusions in conjunction with the general
views on the nature of LUCA.

Results
The hypothesis: inferring the temporal order of the origin
of DNA replication systems from comparison of viral and
cellular genomes
Viruses possess a remarkable collection of diverse genome
replication and expression strategies, in a sharp opposition to the uniformity of the cellular genetic cycle [27,28].
Since the subject of this article is origin and evolution of
DNA replication systems, I concern myself only with

those viruses that possess DNA genomes; most, though
not all, of these viruses encode their own core replication
proteins. There are three basic types of viral DNA replication, one of which is, essentially, the same as the replication mode of cellular life forms (some interesting
variations in viruses notwithstanding) whereas the
remaining two â the protein-primed and the rolling circle
replication (RCR) systems â seem to be unique to viruses
and other selfish genetic elements (Table 1). A remarkable
aspect of viral DNA replication that, to my knowledge, has
never been interpreted in evolutionary terms, is that the
vast majority of viruses with the "cell-like", RNA-primed,
and terminal-protein-primed replication strategies
encode the archaeal-type B-family DNA polymerase
(hereinafter PolB) [29,30]. A series of exhaustive, iterative
PSI-BLAST [31,32] searches of the viral subset of the nonredundant protein sequence database (NCBI, NIH,
Bethesda) with bacterial PolC sequences as queries
yielded only 8 bacteriophage PolC homologs (Table 1), in
a sharp contrast to the thousands of viruses that possess
PolB homologs (Table 1 and data not shown). The
remaining viruses either have the A-family polymerase
(hereinafter PolA) that performs, mostly, repair-related
functions in bacteria (Table 1) or no DNA polymerase at
all. No virus-encoded homologs of the unique euryarchaeal polymerase (hereinafter PolD) were identified. The
other genes involved in viral DNA replication are a complex mix of homologs of bacterial and archaeal replicative
proteins and virus-specific proteins [26,33,34] but the
decidedly non-uniform distribution of polymerases is
striking.
There is hardly any mechanistic impediment to the
involvement of PolC in viral DNA replication as evidenced, in particular, by the presence of the gene for the
PolC homolog in 8 phage genomes (Table 1). Additionally, a variety of bacteriophages, such as temperate phages
of the family Siphoviridae, successfully recruit bacterial
PolC for their replication but not the polC gene to their
genomes. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the catalytic efficiencies of the three DNA polymerases of E. coli,
PolA, PolB, and PolC, shows that PolC has a much greater
turnover rate than the other two, i.e., is a substantially
more efficient enzyme ([35,36]; and see Table 5-I in [1]).
Thus, inasmuch as mechanistic causes for the dominance
of PolB among viruses and the near absence of PolC are
unlikely to exist, I propose a historical explanation (Fig.
1). I hypothesize that PolB is the most ancient replicative
DNA polymerase and, accordingly, the archaeal-type DNA
replication system centered around this polymerase was
the first to have evolved among the two known cellular
replication systems. Moreover, there was a time interval
after the emergence of the PolB-centered, archaeal-type
DNA replication system and before the advent of the bacterial, PolC-centered one, during which several lineages of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

selfish genetic elements with diverse life styles have
emerged. In particular, the divergence between the RNAprimed and protein-primed branches of the PolB family
of polymerases, each of which spans a broad range of
viruses and other selfish elements [30,37], can be confidently assigned to this early stage of evolution. Perhaps,
along with RCR elements, which also display remarkable
diversity [38] and are likely to be of ancient origin, these
viruses and virus-like entities have occupied the major
existing biological niches and thus prevented any significant diversification of selfish elements carrying PolC. The
presence of PolC in several bacteriophages (Table 1)
might be the result of relatively late non-orthologous gene
displacement, a phenomenon that seems to have occurred
on several occasions during the evolution of DNA
polymerases [30]. Indeed, the phage PolC sequences did
not appear to be closely related to each other but instead
showed the closest similarity to different bacterial
polymerases (data not shown).
Complications and caveats
Several compounding factors merit consideration in connection with this hypothesis. Firstly, and probably, most
importantly, the current sampling of the "virosphere" is
obviously incomplete. Only four major bacterial lineages
(Proteobacteria, Cyanoabacteria, low-GC Gram-positive
bacteria), two lineages of archaea (Sulfolobales and Halobacteria), and animals among the eukaryotes (as far as
DNA viruses with large genomes are concerned) have
been extensively sampled by viral genomics; there are
only a few sequenced genomes of viruses infecting organisms outside these taxa. However, despite this limited
sampling, the diversity of viruses with sequenced
genomes is substantial by any criterion, be it replication
strategy, genome size, gene repertoire, or virion structure.
Therefore, it seems unlikely (although, certainly, not
impossible) that sequencing of viruses from other lineages will radically change the distribution of DNA
polymerases among viruses by revealing a dominant presence of PolC. Interestingly, in a recent study on viral
metagenomics, a claim has been made that PolC is one of
the dominant viral enzymes in three distant and diverse
habitats [39]. However, examination of the lists of other
enzymes that appeared to dominate these "viromes" indicates that these are uncharacteristic of viruses and, at lest
in some case, unlikely to be present in a virus given their
well-characterized functions (see the Author Response to
Forterre below for additional details). Thus, these metagenomic results, mostly likely, reflect contamination of the
analyzed viral samples with bacterial DNA and do not
point to hidden diversity of viruses replicated by PolC
appears unlikely.

The second complication for the present hypothesis is that
many DNA viruses of archaea and bacteria encode no

DNA polymerase of their own and employ the respective
host enzymes. Among bacteriophages, the forms with and
without virus-encoded replicative enzymes are interspersed within the same viral families which is best compatible with the latter having been derived by
degenerative evolution. However, the case of the viruses
of hyperthermophilic crenarchaea is truly mysterious.
None of these viruses encode their own polymerase, and
mostly, they do not possess any other viral hallmark genes
either, with the exception of a single group that has the
widespread icosahedral capsid protein [40,41]. The provenance of these viruses remains unclear: they might be
ultimate derivatives of the virus world that have lost all its
hallmarks (the more likely possibility in the context of the
virus world concept [26]), or else, they might have
evolved anew via assembly of genes derived from the host.
Whichever of these scenarios turns out to be correct, these
viruses do not possess PolC but, instead, are replicated by
the host PolB. Thus, their unique gene repertoire might
pose a challenge to the virus world concept but hardly
undermines the present hypothesis.
The third problem is the relevance (or lack thereof) of the
eukaryotic DNA viruses, which account for a good part of
the overall viral diversity, and in particular, the preponderance of PolB in the replication systems (Table 1), for
the problem of the ultimate origins of those systems.
Indeed, origin of eukaryotes via the archaeal-bacterial
symbiosis which, I believe, is, by far, the most likely scenario [42,43], implies that eukaryotic viruses are much
younger than the viruses of archaea and bacteria. How-

ever, that does not automatically mean that the gene composition of eukaryotic viruses tell us nothing about the
earliest stages of the evolution of genome replication.
Indeed, considering the accumulating evidence that sampling of genes from bacterial and archaeal viruses was the
primary route of origin of eukaryotic viruses [26], the gene
repertoire of eukaryotic viruses would reflect the composition of the gene pool of archaeal and bacterial viruses at
the time of eukaryogenesis, perhaps, ~2 billion years ago.
Hence, the predominance of PolB in eukaryotic viruses
suggests that the this was the primary viral DNA polymerase at that stage of evolution.
Finally, from the most general standpoint, the approach
employed here is an extension of the traditional logic of
the argument from diversity that is common, e.g., in phylogeography. Under this view, the area with the greatest
diversity of representatives from a given taxon is considered to be the birthplace of the group (e.g., [44]). This is,
essentially, a parsimony-type argument that might fail
under special circumstances, such as a sweep of the entire
habitat by a particularly fit form leading to the obliteration of the ancestral diversity and followed by a new diversification. Applied to the evolution of the replication
systems, this would translate into the sweep of the virus
world by PolB via extensive horizontal gene transfer
(HGT), at a relatively late stage of evolution. It has been
demonstrated that HGT is common in the evolution of
DNA polymerases including the B family [30]. However,
as discussed above, it is hard to think of a selective advantage of PolB that would trigger a massive sweep. The alter-

native possibility of a major bottleneck in the evolution of
viruses followed by a non-selective takeover by PolB is not
supported by any concrete evidence either. Thus, although
it is impossible to formally rule out the possibility of a
PolB sweep, this scenario appears unlikely.
Support from the evolutionary relationships between DNA
and RNA polymerases
The order of emergence of the replication systems proposed here seems to get support from the homologous
relationships between DNA and RNA polymerases
inferred from structural and sequence comparisons. The
catalytic domain of PolB has the widespread palm-andfingers fold [14,45] various modifications of which are
also found in PolA [46] and in RNA-dependent RNA
polymerases (RdRp) of RNA viruses and reverse transcriptases [47]. Notably, the key protein of rolling circle
replication, the initiation endonuclease (RCRE), has a
derived form of the same fold [48,49]. By contrast, the
core domain of PolC [16,17] belongs to the unrelated fold

of the polÎ² family that includes a variety of non-replicative nucleotidyltransferases, such as polyA polymerases
[50]. The prevailing current scenario for the early evolution of life has DNA replication evolving from within a
RNA-protein world where only RNA replication occurred,
with reverse transcription being a likely intermediate stage
of evolution [5,23,25,26]. Under this scenario, it appears
most likely that PolB, PolA, and RCRE evolved from the
ancient replicative enzymes (RdRp or, more likely, reverse
transcriptase). In contrast, the ancestor of PolC, probably,
originated as a non-specific, non-replicative polymerase,
such as a polyA polymerase, and was recruited for the bacterial-type replication system at a later stage of evolution
(Figure 1).

Discussion and Conclusion
The hypothesis on the temporal order of the emergence of
DNA replication systems proposed here is drawn directly
from the data on the remarkably non-uniform distribution of DNA polymerases among viruses and virus-like

elements and, accordingly, is not tightly linked to any specific model of the origin of cells and viruses. It is, nevertheless, interesting to consider how this hypothesis plays
out in the context of two classes of such models. The first
view which, conceivably, represents the orthodoxy, holds
that the main classes of viruses emerged from already
formed cells, probably, at early stages of evolution. Under
this model, the present hypothesis implies that LUCA had
the archaeal-type system of DNA replication, whereas the
displacement of this ancestral system in bacteria, possibly,
mediated by a virus [21,24], was a relatively late event
(Figure 2).
The alternative scenario [26] derives both virus-like elements and cells directly from a primordial gene pool (Figure 3). Under this view, LUCA did not have a cellular
organization at all but instead consisted of a population
of genetic elements that replicated and expressed proteins
within networks of inorganic compartments[51,52]. This
model stems from the lack of homology between the core
components of the DNA replication systems and membrane biogenesis pathways in archaea and bacteria [5,53].
Accordingly, it is proposed that proto-archaeal and protobacterial cells escaped from these networks independently, following the evolution of the corresponding distinct versions of the membrane biogenesis machinery
[51,52]. In conjunction with this model, the concept of
the ancient virus world has been recently developed,
according to which the major classes of viruses (more precisely, virus-like elements inasmuch as a pre-cellular stage
of evolution is concerned) evolved already in the primordial gene pool, and distinct complements of viruses were
captured by the escaping proto-archaeal and proto-bacterial cells [26]. Under this scenario, the present hypothesis
implies that genetic elements encoding PolB as well as
those with the RCR mode of replication have evolved considerable diversity prior to the emergence of cells. By contrast, the bacterial replication system was "invented" later
and was recruited by a very limited range of bacteriophages, possibly, at much later stages of evolution. The
evolutionary status of the PolA-based replication system,
which is found in a limited range of bacteriophages (Table
1) and is centered around a polymerase that is involved in
gap-filling during replication and in repair in all bacteria[1], is less clear. A progenitor of the PolA-replicated
phages might have evolved already at an early, perhaps,
pre-cellular stage of evolution (Figure 3) but, alternatively, it is hard to rule out that the presence of PolA in
some phages is the result of a relatively late non-orthologous gene displacement.
It might not be possible to come up with decisive arguments rejecting one of the above scenarios, at least, at
present. However, as already argued in some detail elsewhere [26], the primordial pool hypothesis (Figure 3) is

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

simple, connects the origin of viruses and cells into one
coherent scenario that is also linked to earlier stages of
life's evolution, and seems to be best compatible with several lines of evidence. Perhaps, the most compelling of
these is the existence of several "viral hallmark genes" that
are shared by numerous, extremely diverse groups of
viruses but are not found in any sequenced genomes of
cellular life forms [26]. The primordial gene pool appears
to be the natural source of the hallmark genes. Logically,
the evolutionary succession of the DNA replication systems that is inferred here from comparative-genomic evidence also seems to be better compatible with this
scenario for the early evolution of life. Indeed, under this
scenario, the origin of the bacterial replication system is
seen as evolution of a genetic element with a novel DNA
polymerase that had limited success in an environment
already inhabited by numerous elements with other,
older replication systems, and gave rise to a single surviving line of descent, the bacteria. By contrast, the "protoarchaeal-LUCA" scenario (Figure 2) includes an additional, non-trivial step, the displacement of the ancestral
replication with a new one in bacteria. This step appears
to be all the less likely considering the paucity of PolCbased replication systems among modern viruses (Table
1) and their probable absence from ancient viruses: a virus
to displace the archaeal-type replication system in the
LUCA might not have been readily available. The primordial gene set scenario faces its own difficulties that, primarily, have to do with the conservation of several key
membrane proteins in archaea and bacteria [54]. Ideas on
the possibility of the evolution of such proteins in the
context of intermediate stages of membrane evolution
have been proposed [51,52,55] but remain to be developed into a coherent scheme. It should be noticed that,
under this scenario, the emergence and diversification of
PolB-base replication systems prior to the recruitment of
PolC for the replicative function does not necessarily
imply that proto-archaeal cells escaped from the networks
of inorganic compartments earlier than proto-bacterial
cells. Indeed, the capture of replication systems by emerging cells and their subsequent escape are likely to be
uncoupled from the evolution of diverse replicons that
might have reached considerable complexity during the
pre-cellular stage of life's history.
The recent progress in comparative genomics of viruses
has triggered a number of conceptual endeavors into the
crucial links between origins and evolution of cells and
viruses [23-26,56,57]. The (sometimes substantial) differences in the proposed evolutionary scenarios notwithstanding, these studies converge on the notion that
"viruses take center stage in cellular evolution" [57]. The
analysis presented here follows along the same lines by
showing that a joint survey of viral and cellular genomes,
in this particular case, for the presence of different

enzymes of DNA replication, complemented by the comparative analysis of the respective protein folds, allows
one to propose a provisional order for ancient evolutionary events (in this case, the origin of the archaeal-type and
bacterial-type DNA replication systems) that otherwise
appeared to be undecipherable. The hypothesis will be
falsified if and when multiple and diverse groups of
viruses are discovered that use bacterial PolC for their
DNA replication; as discussed above, there is. presently,
no indication of the existence of such a hidden continent
of the virus world.
Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Eric Bapteste, Dalhousie University

Eugene V. Koonin's contributions to the field of evolutionary biology have been numerous although quite dif-

ferent in nature. This author (and his team) have provided
rigorous scientific explanations for biological phenomena
as well as contributed more prospective works, which
point out important issues rather than propose robust
answers. Such prospective works are important because
they can indicate future directions for biological research.
I consider the present manuscript to be of this second
kind and to be meant to provide us with a hint of deeper
evolution analyses still to come.
That is to say the reader should not consider the present
manuscript as the last word on the question of the temporal order of evolution of the DNA replication systems, but
as a good opportunity to think about it again. There could
be and likely will be more to be said on this issue. If he
wanted, and I think he could (thus maybe should),
Eugene Koonin himself could contribute further and

more decisive analyses on this topic in a slightly revised
version of this manuscript.
Before I suggest some of the additional studies that could
help test and maybe strengthen E. Koonin's current claim,
I would like to stress an interesting perspective this paper
could contribute to put forward. I take it to be the general
and quite elegant idea, that "comparisons of viral
genomes with the genomes of cellular life forms might
provide windows into the deep past of life's evolution".
This mine of genetic information is indeed not systematically explored in evolutionary analyses of cellular life
forms, although, because it broadens the portion of the
metagenome investigated, it would be certainly capable of
highlighting the dynamics of cellular genome evolution.
However, presenting a strong case for the use of the phyl-

ogenetic information stored in the DNA of viral communities remains challenging. In this regard, I am still
unconvinced by the robustness of the claim of the present
manuscript, although the temporal order of evolution of
DNA replication systems presented here might be absolutely correct.
In this paper, Koonin presents a striking observation
regarding the distribution of polymerases in viruses: the
archaeal type (polB) is almost ubiquitous, the bacterial
type (polC) is very rare. He thus legitimately looks for an
explanation of this fact.
Several possibilities could a priori be considered:

Page 8 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:39

(i) PolB is more broadly distributed because its fitness is
better than polC fitness, and it invades viral genomes
more efficiently: polB then replaces polC. One could not
exclude that polB is a succesfull newcomer.
(ii) PolC is a newcomer in viral genomes, which was never
able to successfully replace the efficient polB because polB
is ancient and sucessful.
(iii) The present distribution does not really tell us much
about which of these two polymerases appeared first,
because we lack essential knowledge regarding the
dynamic and mode of inheritance of polymerases within
viral genomes. PolB and polC, in that regard, might well
be equally ancient (and their present, highly unbalanced
distribution could reflect the stochastic result of a very
ancient competition between these two forms in the
smallest first LUCAn population). Agnosticism is a scienfitic answer too.
In my view, a phylogeny of the viral polB to decide
between these three options is currently lacking. Phylogenetic analysis of polB could test the presence of signs of
high mobility and a tendency to spread across viral
genomes. I would encourage Eugene Koonin to build such
a phylogenetic tree of viral polB and to comment on it in
a revised version of the manuscript.
Author response: As noted by Bapteste himself, this is a discussion/hypothesis paper not a full-scale phylogenetic analysis.
Given the huge number of sequences of polymerases and other
replicative proteins that are currently available, the latter is a
hard task. More importantly, the results are very difficult to
interpret when viral and cellular sequences are mixed in the
same tree because of the high and non-uniform rates of evolution that is typical of viruses and the inevitable long-branch
problems associated with this pattern. These problems are quite
apparent in recent phylogenetic analyses of diverse viral proteins including the B family polymerases. Surely, a variety of
approaches can be used to cope with long-branch artifacts but
that would be a different paper altogether. Of course, I cite the
available phylogenies (refs. [30,37]) that, even as they suffer
from the aforementioned problems, do provide some important
indications, such as the apparent monophyly of PolB enzymes
in the protein-primed replication systems.
Furthermore, it would be interesting to test the congruence between the phylogeny of this marker and those of
the other components of the replication systems. Congruence within the latter trees but disagreement with the
former would suggest that polB has a tendency to be
highly mobile, and capable of replacing native polymerases.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

Author response: Again, this suggestion certainly makes
sense in principle; I am not at all denying the importance of
phylogenetic analyses. There are, however, two reasons that
compel me not to include any of these here. First, this is a large
scale analysis that goes beyond the scope of this paper. Second,
it is extremely hard to obtain reliable trees when viral sequences
are analyzed jointly with homologs from cellular life forms.
Information on phyletic patterns that is primarily used here,
while limited in scope, is far more trustable.
If this is not the case, I would be more inclined to accept
Koonin's claim that maybe the poor distribution of polC
reflects the relative recency of this polymerase (although I
suspect the causes for such an extreme distribution could
easily involve more than old historical causation alone).
So far, I feel that the best argument presented in this manuscript in favor of polB ancestrality is not recorded in
viruses DNA but rather in PolB structure. According to the
author, PolB structure would be compatible with the RNA
world hypothesis (and evolved from ancestral RdRp replicatives enzymes), while PolC structure would not be so,
hence would be a secondary aquisition. I have no problem with this argument, except that then Eugene Koonin's
point about the important role to be played by viral
genomes content in ancient evolutionary analyses appear
less important that I had hoped.
Author response: I believe it is, exactly, the congruence of the
two lines of argument that make the hypothesis on the primacy
of PolB in the evolution of DNA replication worth a serious consideration. In the revised manuscript, I have modified the wording in the Abstract and in the Conclusions to emphasize this.
The manuscript could also contain a more in depth biochemical presentation of PolB and PolC (structures,
length, stability properties, etc.), which would help in the
discussion of which polymerases has a higher chance of
being carried/recruited by viral mosaic genomes, because
some slight physico-chemical differences could not
explain the predominance of one marker versus the other.
Author response: I strongly believe there is no reason to think
PolB is intrinsically "better" than PolC. Additional information
and references on the catalytic efficiency of each enzyme family
have been included in the revision.
Finally, in all naivety, I am curious to know if some viral
genomes investigated by Eugene Koonin happened to lack
any of the currently known polymerases. If yes, does that
mean that there are alternate replication systems, which
could put the problem considered here in a different perspective by putting more attention on intermediary stages
in the evolution of replication system, where neither polB
nor polC were the decisive elements: after all in the eggor-chicken-first controversy, the answer is a third term...Is

Page 9 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:39

it conceivable that there are even more polymerases (or
proteins playing their role in an older replication system)
to be discovered?
Author response: Yes, quite a few viral genomes including
some bacteriophages and archaeal viruses with reasonably large
genomes and the eukaryotic polydnaviruses lack polymerases or
other proteins involved in replication. In some cases (e.g., the
classic phage Î»), it has been directly demonstrated and, for
other viruses in this category, it is assumed that the host replication machinery is recruited to replicate the viral genome. This
was mentioned in the original manuscript but discussion of
these "ultra-parasitic" viruses is expanded in the revision. I also
argue why I do not believe in a "third path", i.e., the primacy
of the ultimate dependence on the hosts in viral evolution, with
subsequent acquisition of replicative genes, as the main route of
viral evolution. In a nutshell, there are two reasons to prefer the
scenario under which the first DNA viruses with large genomes
encoded polymerases and other replicative proteins. First,
viruses devoid of replicative proteins are relatively few and far
between and, in the case of bacteriophages, are embedded
within families that do encode their own replication machinery.
Second, as extensively argued elsewhere (Ref. [26]), the wide
spread of "viral hallmark genes", several of which encode replicative proteins, across all kinds of viruses stands as evidence of
the prominence of idiosyncratic replication systems among
ancient viruses. Admittedly, the viruses of hyperthermophilic
crenarahaeota challenge both arguments, and this is also discussed in the revised version of the paper, in the special new section on Complications and Caveats.
Minor questions:
- Could you please comment on the likely "age" of/relationships between the 8 phages genomes with a polC
homologue? Does it look like polC was gained independently multiple times?
Author response: Yes, this is addressed in the revision. Again
and again, phylogeny of viral genes, in particular, an apparent
lack of monophyly, should be treated with utmost caution. Nevertheless, at the face of it, it certainly looks like the polC gene
might have been captured more than once.
- All along the manuscript and in your figures, you refer to
primitive life forms as bacteria or archaea. Do you really
mean this? It would seem more correct to me to talk about
cenancestor of bacteria/archaea (or populations of
cenancestors of bacteria/archaea). To me bacteria is a label
associated with extant lineages, but it is unclear wether we
could identify such a bacteria in the past. When you use
this term, do you have in mind a series of characters (bacterial synapomorphies) that made them a bona fide bacteria back then or are these bacteria and archaea of the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

past not that similar to our present ones (and maybe
would deserve another name then)?
Author response: A very curious and not so minor point that
goes somewhat beyond the scope of the present manuscript. I
have inserted "proto-archaea" and "proto-bacteria" here and
there, to clarify the meaning. I could argue, however, that the
actual reconstruction of the ancestral archaeal and bacterial
genomes suggests that the last common ancestors of each of
these domains of life, most likely, closely resembled relatively
simple modern forms, i.e., they already were...archaea and bacteria. Perhaps, this is a subject to pick up on a future occasion.
Reviewer's report 2
Patrick Forterre, Institut Pasteur

Eugene Koonin suggests in this paper to use information
from the viral world to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the DNA replication apparatus. I completely agree
with his conclusion that "comparisons of viral genomes with
the cellular life forms might provide windows into the deep past
of lifes's evolution that appear to be out of reach for other
approaches". Here, Koonin specifically proposes that DNA
polymerases of the B family (Pol B) originated before
those of the C family (Pol C). His argument is that Pol B
are much more widespread in different groups of organisms (cellular and viral) compared to Pol C (which is
restricted to Bacteria and a few bacterial viruses). He suggests that "the earlier diversification of viruses and virus-like
entities using DNA Pol B occupied the major existing biological
niches and thus prevented any significant diversification of selfish elements carrying Pol C".
Author response: Before proceeding with specifics, I must
express my highest appreciation. Patrick Forterre's contribution
to the study of DNA replication and its evolution and, more
generally, to the field of early evolution of life and the evolutionary importance of viruses have been fundamental at many levels. I am honored and delighted to address these comments that,
I believe, greatly add to the paper.
The non-uniform distribution of the different DNA
polymerases is indeed striking and requires an explanation. The merit of this paper is to focus for the first time
on this point. However, the more general question is why
Pol B are much more widespread in databases than DNA
polymerases of any other families, since DNA Pol A, D, E,
X and Y also exhibit a much more restricted distribution
than DNA Pol B (FilÃ©e et al., 2002). If we apply the logic
proposed by Koonin, the conclusion would be that Pol B
originated first, followed by Pol A (universal in bacteria
and widespread in their viruses, but also present in
eukarya), Pol C, Pol D (only in euryarchaea) and Pol E
(only in a few archaeal and bacterial plasmid). An enzyme
such as the Topo V of Methanopyrus kandleri should be very

Page 10 of 18

Biology Direct 2006, 1:39

recent since it has only been discovered in this archaeon
(Forterre, 2006)! Such view would be quite simplistic and
the real history has been certainly more complex.
Author response: I have to state my disagreement. That very
logic, simple as it might be, provides a reasonable null
hypothesis on the succession of the evolutionary events, and
moreover, when it comes to the most fundamental features of
life, this might be the only way to come up with such a hypothesis. And, yes, the (relatively) recent origin of Topo V is an
implication, and I do not think it is untenable. The resulting
evolutionary scenario needs not to be simplistic inasmuch as it
does not contradict the complexity brought about by horizontal
gene transfer (which is the main point of FilÃ©e et al., 2002).
Certainly, HGT events have been plentiful in evolution, including the evolution of DNA polymerases. The problem is not with
HGT per se but with the possibility of HGT-driven sweeps obliterating the previous history and hence overturning the argument from diversity. Such sweeps are possible but I believe they
should be pitted against the aforementioned null hypothesis,
and the burden of proof is on those claiming a sweep (more on
this below). I have included a brief discussion of this issue in
the revised manuscript.
The restricted distribution of a particular product of life
evolution does not imply per se a more recent origin. For
instance, when Neanderthals were still present in a corner
of southern Europe, it would have been wrong (in the
absence of fossil record) to conclude that Homo sapiens
sapiens appeared first and occupied the major existing biological niches, thus prevented any significant diversification of more recent Homo sapiens neanderthalis! A protein
with a restricted distribution thus could simply be an
ancestral enzyme which has been later on displaced by a
more successful functional analogue in the majority of
lineages. It can be also a protein which was once widely
distributed, but mainly in lineages without descendent
today. The distribution of various proteins should be
influenced by many factors, including their respective
contribution to the fitness of the organisms in which they
operate and the respective evolutionary success of the
organisms bearing these proteins (two factors that can be
either related or completely independent).
Author response: There are several aspects of the human evolution analogy that are of interest. Under what circumstances
would one arrive to the erroneous conclusion about the antiquity of H. sapiens and the late arrival of Homo sapiens neanderthalensis? I believe only if we had no knowledge of the
spread of hominids outside Europe; no access to fossils; and no
source of sequence or other genetic data. In other words, if our
information was woefully incomplete. As soon as we got hold of
any of these additional sources of information, we would see the
distribution of humans in Europe for what it was, i.e., the H.
sapiens sapiens population rapidly migrating to occupy most of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

Europe and the population heading toward extinction in the
South. It should be noted that it is only a very superficial argument from diversity, namely, the diversity of geographical
niches occupied by H. sapiens sapiens as opposed to H. sapiens
neanderthalensis?, that would support the idea of Neanderthals
being a recent offshoot of the human lineage. If there was a way
to assess either the genetic diversity of the populations or the
diversity of the fossil records, the fallacy of this hypothesis would
quickly become apparent. Considering another, more fundamental issue in human evolution, the geographic origin of
humans, the argument from diversity (of fossils and modern
populations as well) has worked beautifully, being fully compatible with phylogeny and confidently pointing to the African cradle of humanity. Thus, to distinguish between "bad" and
"good" arguments from diversity, additional evidence is important. Coming back to DNA polymerases, I think this is the exact
situation with the hypothesis presented in the paper Firstly, the
argument for the primacy of PolB is, truly, an argument from
diversity (of genome layout and the organization of replication
systems that center around PolB) not one from mere abundance. Secondly, this argument is congruent with a completely
different line of evolutionary evidence, on based on the homology of PolB with other palm-domain polymerases.
Finally, I would like to point out a substantial difference
between the evolution of species (like humans) and evolution of
genes. Notwithstanding all the prominence of HGT in the latter, I do not believe it is possible to argue that it occurs as often
and as readily as migration of organisms. This makes the analogy less pertinent and suggests that the argument from diversity
might work better for genes than for species.
A brief discussion of the argument from diversity were added to
the Complications and Caveats section.
Coming back to DNA polymerases, the occurrence of Pol
B and C in the three cellular domains cannot tell us much
about their history, since we don't know the relative order
of appearance of these domains (for instance, even if we
were sure of the rooting of the universal tree in the "bacterial branch" the last common ancestor of bacteria might
have existed either before or after the last common ancestors of the other two). We should then focus entirely on
the viral world to try answering the question, why DNA
Pol B are so abundant compared to others DNA polymerases ? This can be explained a priori by several non exclusive hypotheses beside the explanation proposed by
Koonin:
1Â°) Pol B are more efficient than all the others, and thus
many non-orthologous displacement occurred in which
PolB displaced other DNA polymerases.
2Â°) there is a strong sampling bias in favour of viruses
(plasmids) encoding Pol B in current databases

Page 11 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:39

3Â°) the cellular hosts of viruses (plasmids) encoding Pol
B have been preferentially selected in the game of evolution (for reasons having eventually nothing to do with
their DNA polymerases).
I agree with Koonin that there is no reason to believe that
Pol B are more efficient for processive DNA replication
than Pol A or Pol C. Some Pol A are very efficient (for
instance T7 DNA polymerase) and Pol C (at least in the
presence of PCNA and other replication factors) can replicate bacterial chromosomes at an extremely high speed.
However, the two other explanations (bias sampling and/
or disappearance of ancient hosts) should be seriously
taken into consideration. Koonin argues against the idea
of a sampling bias because "the sequenced viral genomes
already encompass a staggering diversity of gene repertoire and
infect hosts from all main division of cellular life". I quite disagree on this point. Most known bacterial viruses infect
some groups of proteobacteria, some groups of Gram positive bacteria (firmicutes and mycobacteria) and cyanobacteria, i.e. 4 out of more than 30 bacterial divisions.
More than half of the bacterial divisions detected by environmental PCR have no cultivable representative, thus no
genome (cellular or viral) are available for these groups.
Similarly, only a few archaeal lineages (mostly Sulfolobales and Halobacteriales) have been screened for viruses.
In eukaryotes too, most superphyla have not been
screened for the presence of viruses. We mainly know
viruses of a few animals, plants and green algae.
A glimpse of the hidden virosphere can be obtained by
looking at the ORFans in bacterial genomes. These
ORFans are probably of viral or plasmid origin (Daubin
and Ochman, Genome Res., 2004). However, in a recent
analysis, Yin and Fisher (2006) found that only 2.8% of
110,186 bacterial ORFans have viral homologues. Their
result suggests to me that we vastly underestimate the
diversity of the modern virosphere. One therefore cannot
exclude that viruses encoding Pol D or Topo V still exist,
or that viruses encoding Pol C are abundant in bacterial,
archeal or eukaryotic divisions which have not been studied.
Author response: Of course, sampling biases are possible,
moreover, inevitable, and no one can argue that a complete census of viruses existing in the biosphere is years ahead of us. Nevertheless, I think that the existing sampling is not negligibly
small anymore and provides for detecting some credible trends,
even as caution is always due. Is it likely that viruses in other
bacterial divisions will be radically different from those in the
four divisions that have been sampled? I think that likelihood is
rather small, especially, given the interconnectedness of different "viromes", at least, in the sea (see references in the "virus
world" paper; ref. [26]).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

ORFans, I believe, provide a very biased glimpse of the virosphere, if any. Firstly, the viral/plasmid origin of ORFans,
while an attractive hypothesis, is far from being supported by
much hard evidence (see the paper of Yin and Fischer cited by
Forterre). Secondly, more or less, by definition, ORFans are fast
evolving proteins, so one would not expect to see many homologs
in viruses unless the ORFan recently originated from a
sequenced virus. I slightly expanded the discussion of potential
effects of the sampling bias and added some extra words of caution in the revised manuscript.
A recent metagenomic analysis by Rohwer and colleagues
(Angly et al. 2006) even suggests that Pol C might be in
fact even more widespread than Pol B in viruses infecting
bacteria. Indeed, these authors found polC genes among
the five most abundant enzyme-coding genes in three out
of four oceanic viral metagenomes analyzed, whereas they
never recovered genes encoding Pol B! Interestingly, they
only recover genes encoding the alpha subunit of Pol C,
suggesting that in viruses, this enzyme can be very processive alone. The existence of a large reservoir of polC genes
in viruses supports the hypothesis that this bacterial replicase was initially recruited from a virus before the diversification of the bacterial domain (Forterre, 1999).
Author response: The results of the metagenomic analysis of
Rohwer and coworkers would present a very serious problem,
perhaps, an actual falsification for the hypothesis that is put forward in this paper...if only these results could be taken at face
value. However, a quick examination of Table 2 in Angly et al.
shows that this is not the case. Indeed, in 3 out of the 4 explored
metagenomic samples, PolC was among the most abundant
"viral" enzymes. But what about the other enzymes that cooccur with PolC in those lists? These are a ribonucleotide
reductase subunit, a formate dehydrogenase subunit, a carbamoyl-phosphate synthase subunit, a cytochrome oxidase subunit, 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxylase, isoleucyltRNA synthetase, and methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase carboxyl
transferase subunit. I deliberately listed those enzymes to convey
the entire picture as one can glean it from the paper of Angly et
al. Other than PolC, the list of the abundant enzymes includes
only one found in some known viruses (not many), ribonucleotide reductase. The rest are typical bacterial proteins whose
presence in viruses is both unprecedented and unlikely on biological considerations (very unlikely for some, e.g. cytochrome
oxidase, an integral component of the membrane electron
transfer chain). To me, examination of this list of abundant
"viral enzymes" suggest an unequivocal, even if disturbing,
even rather shocking conclusion: these enzymes are not viral but
rather come from contaminating bacterial DNA. Thus, there is,
at this point, still no defendable evidence of "a large reservoir of
polC genes in viruses". Given the importance of this matter, I
included a brief paragraph to this effect in the revised discussion
section.

Beside the sampling bias, one cannot exclude the historical bias. Viruses encoding Pol C polymerases might have
existed for a very long time (predating or not those with
PolB) but most of them might have disappeared with their
hosts (except those infecting bacteria). The concept of lost
lineages is presently neglected by Koonin and others evolutionists who base their argumentation on the principle
of parsimony (see discussion with the reviewers in
Koonin et al., 2006). Koonin put forward several time the
argument of simplicity in favor of his hypotheses, he tell
us that his general view of life history is attractively simple.
I think that the path of history is precisely never so simple
but usually extremely rich and complex. I would suggest
that Koonin and others with similar views are using in fact
an extreme form of "actualism", i.e. they want to explain
all life evolution from its very beginning to the present
state by only considering modern molecules and organisms (either cells or viruses). The combination of archaea
and bacteria to produce eucaryotes is characteristic of this
viewpoint. Incidentally, if Eukaryotes indeed originated
from the association of a bacterium and an archaeon (as
supported by Koonin) this paper would have no raison
d'Ãªtre, since all viruses and plasmids from eukaryotes
encoding Pol B should be removed from Table 1 (being of
archaeal origin). In that case (only two primary domains
left), one cannot say that Pol B was prevalent in the
ancient living world (before the origin of eukaryotes)
since PolC is largely dominant in Bacteria (and probably
in their viruses, considering the metagenomic previously
discussed). The remaining question then would be, why
Pol C (and Pol D) disappeared in Eukaryotes and their
viruses?
Author response: There are two very different, important
issues brought up in this comment, the general (to some extent,
philosophical) criticism of parsimony and actualism, and the
relevance of eukaryotic viruses, and I address them separately.
The point about parsimony, indeed, recapitulates the debate
around the "virus world" paper but I find the issue to be so central to all historical sciences that it might be worth revisiting,
even if briefly. The poverty of parsimony as a guiding principle
in the reconstruction of history is obvious, and yet, I think the
idea that "the path of history is precisely never so simple
but usually extremely rich and complex", while not, exactly,
wrong in itself, is going nowhere (or, worse, heading for disaster) as an epistemological principle. Yes, life is (staggeringly)
complex but that does not mean that we should not proceed
toward the reconstruction of its history by first constructing the
simplest scenarios that are compatible with the available data
and then rejecting them and replacing with more complex ones
as soon as evidence of such extra complexity is obtained. I
strongly believe that this is the only realistic path to progress in
the study of evolution. "Occam all the way down", basically.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

Regarding the problem of extinct lineages (this thread goes
throughout Forterre's comments; I am trying to address it here
all in one place). Of course, we are all well aware of the fact
that most of the (eukaryotic) life forms that inhabited this
planet throughout its history are not extant but extinct (I also
like Gould's "Wonderful Life" quoted by Forterre below â of
course, not at all the first recognition of the preponderance of
extinct lineages but a beautiful expose). However, this is unequivocally true only for multicellular eukaryotes; we do not have
a good idea at all just how many lineages of bacteria or archaea
might have gone extinct. Of course, this is, largely, due to the
near lack of fossil record although geochemical data might suggest the existence of such lineages. Actually, a combination of
geochemistry and comparative genomic has recently led to the
proposal of one such group, cyanobacteria-like organisms with
anoxygenic photosynthesis (Mulkidjanian et al. Proc Natl
Acad Sci U S A. 2006;103:13126-31). In general, however,
the extent and role of extinction of major lineages in the evolution of prokaryotes is just not known.
Even in the case of eukaryotes, extinction is overwhelming only
when relatively small twigs (species, genera, families) of the
eukaryotic evolutionary tree are considered. For most of the evolutionary history of animals and plants, the spectrum of the
phyla in existence remained the same. Apparently, during transition periods, like the Cambrian explosion, there have been
considerable flourish of diverse animal phyla that, however,
went extinct rather promptly. It stands to reason that early
emergence of fundamentally diverse forms is, indeed, a general
pattern in such transitional periods of life's evolution, including
the origin of cells themselves. Most of these have been shortlived, so I see no reason to seriously doubt that, in the last 3 billion years or so, the only domains of life have been archaea and
bacteria, and then, their derivative, the eukaryotes. In any case,
Forterre's point is not just that there have been many extinct life
forms but that their genetic heritage made substantial contributions to the genetic composition of the extant life forms. I think
for this we need concrete evidence, and I maintain that such
evidence is currently lacking. Specifically, with regard to
eukaryotes, I just do not think there is any credible evidence of
a contribution from a 3rd domain; some more discussion of this
issue can be found in another paper of mine recently published
in Biology Direct (Koonin, Biol Direct. 2006;1:22) and a little
more to follow below but a definitive study remains to be performed and described. The interesting and important issue of
actualism is addressed in another comment below.
Here I must touch upon the issue of the relevance of eukaryotic
viruses (those of them that have a DNA polymerase all encode
PolB) to the raison d'Ãªtre of the hypothesis presented in this
paper. Indeed, at this point, I strongly support the concept of the
origin of eukaryotes from an archaeal-bacterial symbiosis, without any contribution from a third, extinct domain (see more
about this below). However, this does not automatically mean
that the eukaryotic viruses that evolved in the wake of this sym-

Page 13 of 18

Biology Direct 2006, 1:39

biosis are entirely irrelevant for the problem of the temporal
order of the origin of different replication systems. Considering
that eukaryotic DNA viruses with large genomes definitely possess many genes of viral origin and likely evolved, primarily, via
the sampling of the bacterial and archaeal viral pools (see Ref.
[26]for discussion and references), the gene repertoire of
eukaryotic viruses should reflect the gene composition of that
ancient viral world. Under this scenario, the dominance of PolB
among eukaryotic viruses seems to tell us that this was the primary choice of DNA polymerase available in the viral gene at
the time of the emergence of eukaryotes, two billion years ago
or so. I make it clear in the revised version of the manuscript
that this is the context in which eukaryotic viruses are relevant
for the present discussion.
I don't want to argue here in detail with Koonin about the
Martin and Russell hypothesis that life from the very origin to the emergence of Bacteria and Archaea originated
and evolved in a single chimney. I would only mention
that for me, this hypothesis is another example of extreme
actualism (and simplification). Actualism means that you
try to explain the past only with your knowledge about the
present. This principle has been very powerful to fight the
remnants of religious conceptions, especially in geology.
However, the use of actualism in historical sciences is
always delicate! In my opinion, the correct use of actualism in the present situation is to consider that known evolutionary patterns that occurred "recently" in the history
of modern species also occurred much earlier in early life
evolution. For example, we know that many lineages have
been extinct during the evolution leading from the first
animals to the modern fauna. Similarly, many Homo species have disappeared during the evolution leading from
the ancestor of all Homo species to modern Homo sapiens.
We can thus suppose, from the principle of actualism, that
many cellular lineages also disappeared both during the
evolution from the first cells to LUCA or from LUCA to the
modern cellular world. In my opinion, an example of
such lineages was probably the proto-eukaryotic lineages
(urkaryote, sensu Woese), which were subsequently eliminated by modern eukaryotes harboring mitochondria
(Kurland et al., 2006). Other lineages of ancient cells
might have given birth to viruses in the RNA world (Forterre, 2006a). The existence of lost lineages would nicely
explain the existence of the viral hallmark genes mentioned by Koonin, i.e. viral genes that are not present in
modern cells.
This notion of lost lineages has been clearly depicted by
Stephen Jay Gould in his book "Wonderful Life" in which
he emphasized the notion of bottleneck, i.e. the fact that
at several occasion in the course of evolution, massive
extinctions occurred which specifically eliminate the
majority of lineages present at that time on our planet.
The emergence of Homo sapiens has produced such a bot-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

tleneck for the genus Homo by eliminating all other species that previously existed. As a consequence, all future
Homo will be descendants of H. sapiens. Similarly, the
emergence of LUCA should have produced a major bottleneck in the history of life, since all present cellular organisms originated from this ancestor. Three other
bottlenecks probably also occurred at the origin of the
three cellular domains.
Author response: I agree on some basic points, namely, that,
historically, actualism (and, more generally, uniformitarianism) has played an important and, to a large extent, positive
role in affirming rational approaches to historical study, and
also, that the application and implications of this principle are
delicate. I also agree with Forterre's view of what is the appropriate use of actualism, i.e., trying to explain the past via causes
now in operation (this is the principle that the same Stephen Jay
Gould termed "methodological uniformitarianism" in a seminal early paper: Is uniformitarianism necessary? American
Journal of Science, 1965, 263: 223â28). Somewhat ironically, however, should one apply uniformitarian thinking to the
patterns of extinction, one would, of course, conclude that
numerous lineages have gone extinct in the distant past, but
should be very cautious, even skeptical about extinction of
major taxa inasmuch as this is not commonly observable in the
recent past (see above). A very different principle is what Gould
called "substantive uniformitarianism": this is the notion, coming directly from Lyell, that not only the types of processes but
also their rates and material conditions etc have been the same
in the past as they are now. I will not say anything non-trivial
by stating my belief that, while "methodological uniformitarianism" is correct and, basically, is the only reasonable way to
do research in historical sciences, "substantive uniformitarianism" is, in the very least, overly restrictive and, effectively,
wrong. However, I do not think I relied on substantive uniformitarianism as an assumption here or in previous papers. In particular, it has never been an assumption that extinct cell types
did not contribute to the genetic composition of the modern cellular life forms and/or viruses. I cannot avoid using the "no
extinct cellular lineages" as the null hypothesis but it is easy to
imagine evidence that would falsify this hypothesis. In particular, if a 3rd, eukaryote-specific genetic system was decipherable
from comparative-genomic data, I would readily entertain the
idea of a third cellular lineage sensu Forterre. However, this is,
demonstrably, not the case. Those genes that come across as
eukaryote-specific (typically, with distant homologs in archaea
or bacteria) belong to eukaryote-specific functions, such as
cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton. This pattern is most economically
explained by acceleration of evolution triggered by the functional shift, the latter, in turn, caused by the mitochondrial
endosymbiosis.
To finish the discussion on actualism/uniformitarianism
(although this is not the central subject of the present paper), I
must submit that the non-cellular LUCA models actually repre-

Biology Direct 2006, 1:39

sent a departure form substantive and, to some extent, even
from methodological uniformitarianism. Indeed, these models
picture the cenancestor of all modern cells as a non-cellular
entity â an obvious departure from uniformitarian thinking, a
more radical one, I believe, than ideas on displacement of membranes and membrane biogenesis pathways. I should also note
that, when considering the earliest stages of life's evolution, in
particular, the origin of translation and the genetic code, a
break from any version of uniformitarianism is inevitable.
Thus, the status of actualism/uniformitarianism in evolutionary studies is, indeed, delicate and complex but I do not believe
that the evolutionary scenarios discussed here rely on substantive uniformitarianism, not even implicitly. It is a completely
different (and trivial) matter that we must relay on comparisons of extant genomes and organisms to make inferences about
the past; we simply do not have other sources. The question is:
is our data already sufficiently representative for the conclusions from comparative analyses to be credible at all. I try to
argue here that, yes, that threshold has been crossed already
(see above).
In summary, I think that we cannot presently really define
the order of appearance of Pol B and Pol C because we
have still not enough data to correctly estimate the sample
bias. Furthermore, our answer to this question will remain
speculative forever since we will never be able to fully
reconstruct the history of lost lineages.
Author response: It is hard to deny that an element of speculation will remain in inferences on very early evolutionary
events, perhaps, "forever". Nevertheless, as already argued, I
believe that the time is ripe to start seriously considering such
scenarios, of course, not forgetting that corrections, perhaps,
substantial ones will be required once we have more complete
data.
It is my hope that the new section on Complications and Caveats makes this clear.
The notion of lost lineages explains several puzzling
observations, including the existence of hallmark viral
genes of the combination of "orthologous" and non
homologous proteins in the core of the DNA replication
apparatus. Koonin and his colleagues explain this combination by the presence of DNA (but no DNA replication)
in LUCA. Alternatively, I have suggested that the homologous DNA replication proteins present in the universal
protein set were not present in LUCA but delivered by two
or three different viruses at the onset of the three domains
(Forterre, 2006b).
A final argument proposed by Koonin to suggest that Pol
B appeared before Pol C is that the superfamily including
Pol B includes the reverse transcriptase and cellular RNA

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

polymerases (likely direct ancestor of cellular DNA
polymerases) whereas the superfamily including Pol C
includes nucleotidyl transferases (Bailey et al., 2006).
However, the superfamily that includes Pol C also
includes, beside Pol X and PolE, the PolyA polymerases
(template independent RNA polymerase) and CCA adding enzymes (maturation of tRNA). The two superfamilies
thus appear to be very old and were probably already
diversified in the RNA world (with possibly some yet
unknown RNA polymerases in both). Several DNA
polymerases have probably originated independently in
these two superfamilies from enzymes used in the RNA
world.
Author response: I do not much doubt that the enzymes of
the polÎ² family have diversified already in the RNA world. The
point is different, namely, that all these enzymes are non-replicative, typically, template-independent polymerases or nucleotidyltransferases, so it stands to reason that the origin of a DNA
replication enzyme (PolC) from within this family is a late
event.
Although Koonin is still one of the rare evolutionists who
fully recognizes the role played by viruses in early evolution (even suggesting that they originated before cells!), I
have the feeling that he remains somewhat biased in this
paper toward a cellular view of the world. Furthermore,
this view is itself strongly biased toward his favourite scenario of cellular evolution. For instance, he divides the
DNA replication mechanisms based on either Pol A or Pol
C in two families, the "Archaeal-type B family DNA polymerase (either viral or cellular)" and the "Bacterial-type C family DNA polymerase" (especially in Table 1). In my
opinion, these are not good expressions. The eukaryotic
DNA replication mechanisms should not be labelled
"Archaeal-type", since they include topoisomerases (Topo
IB, Topo IIA) which have no orthologues in Archaea
(Gadelle et al., 2003), several Pol B very distantly related
to archaeal ones (FilÃ©e et al., 2002.) and several proteins
involved in the initiation step which have no homologues
in Archaea.
Why use the term Archaeal-type instead of eukaryotic
type? This came clearly from a gradist view of evolution
supported by Koonin and others in which eukaryotes
derived from prokaryotes. Another consequence of the
emphasis given to the procaryote/eukaryote dichotomy
can be see in the expression "prokaryotic and eukaryotic
viruses" used in the abstract). This formulation mixes
archaeal and bacterial viruses (bacteriophages). As a consequence, archaeal viruses (grouped with bacteriophages)
are presented under the headline "bacterial viruses" in the
last edition of the viral taxonomy handbook (Fauquet et
al., 2005). I suggest to Koonin and others to replace such

Page 15 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2006, 1:39

expression by "viruses infecting archaea, bacteria and
eukaryotes".
In the same vein, I found misleading to characterize a viral
system by a cellular one and to talk about "viruses replicating with the help of the archaeal system". This reinforces the
old conception in which viruses derived their proteins
from modern cells. Also strange for me is the sentence
"distinct complements of viruses were captured by escaping
archaeal and bacterial cells". This formulation gives the
active role to the cells, whereas it should be given to the
viruses. Here is very helpful the very important advice of
Jean-Michel Claverie to focus on the viral factory rather
than on the virion, forcing us to consider that viruses are
real living organisms which, beside cells, also have an
active role in life evolution (Claverie, 2006).
Author response: I edited the paper, modifying the wording
in places, to avoid the impression that I stick to the old concept
under which "viruses derived their proteins from modern cells";
obviously, I do not support this view (although some of them,
like the NCLDV, indeed have derived a whole lot). However, I
do not quite agree with the criticism of the phrases such as
"prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses", "viruses replicating
with the help of the archaeal system". Description of these
replication systems by the name of the respective cellular
domain is succinct and unequivocal, and does not at all imply
"primacy" of cells in evolution (of course, Forterre and I fully
agree that there is not such primacy â see Refs. [24-26]). Furthermore, I believe that the distinction between the viruses of
prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria) and those of eukaryotes is
meaningful inasmuch as the entirely real and substantial differences in cellular organizations between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes affects many aspects of virus-cell interaction. Of
course, this is an issue of biology (life style) not of taxonomy,
and the position of the ICTV that lumps archaeal viruses with
bacteriophages in the current taxonomic scheme is disingenuous. Finally, I should note that the notion of the derivation of
eukaryotes from prokaryotes (via endosymbiosis) has nothing to
do with gradism or any other pre-conceived "ism". From my
point of view, it is, simply, the most economical explanation for
the origin of the eukaryotic cell we can think of today. Of
course, one can be swayed by philosophical pre-conceptions
unwittingly and subconsciously but I strongly doubt it is the case
for this particular conundrum.
Finally, I have one historical remark. In the Background
section, lane 6. Koonin writes that "it came as an extraordinary surprise when comparative genomics ushered in the realization that the protein components of the DNA replication
systems are not universally conserved".
Interestingly, this was in fact predicted by Carl Woese and
George Fox in 1977 in their very important paper on "The
concept of cellular evolution". These two authors quote that

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/39

"certain enzymes involved in DNA replication should appear
quite dissimilar in the two cases (eukaryotes and bacteria)
because they predicted that their common ancestor (the
progenote) was still a member of the RNA world. The big
divide between the two systems became apparent as soon
as the genes encoding E. coli DNA Pol III and eukaryotic
DNA Pol Î±, Î´ or Îµ became available (see Forterre et al.,
1994). However, it is true is that the problem remained
largely ignored until the Mushegian, Koonin's PNAS
paper of 1996.
Author response: I am pleased to restore the historical precision. The text has been modified accordingly, and both Woese
and Fox (1977) and Forterre et al. (1994) are now cited.

Referee comments on Koonin, Temporal order of evolution of distinct DNA replication systems inferred by comparison of cellular and viral DNA polymerases
This paper outlines a scenario for the emergence of DNA
replication systems. The scenario is built primarily on the
distribution of different DNA polymerases among organisms and viruses, but gains support from mechanistic and
protein-fold data. The argument contributes to the current
tendency to bring viruses closer to "centre stage in cellular
evolution".
My only significant concern â not only about this paper â
is that this line of argument relies significantly on the
assumption that present-day viruses are representative of
viral lineages that extend back to the beginnings of cellular evolution. Of course we routinely make such assumptions about cellular organisms: early archaea almost
certainly had the same archaeal-type PolB polymerases,
distinctive membrane lipids and so on that are uniformly
distributed among today's archaea. Even so, there is compelling evidence that individual genes have been
acquired, duplicated, broken up, shuffled about and lost
over time. But as viruses are much simpler, and particularly as some are agents of genetic transfer, with what confidence can we infer unbroken lineages of viral descent,
