Abstract
The nitrogen cycle (N-cycle), principally supported by prokaryotes, involves different redox
reactions mainly focused on assimilatory purposes or respiratory processes for energy
conservation. As the N-cycle has important environmental implications, this biogeochemical cycle
has become a major research topic during the last few years. However, although N-cycle metabolic
pathways have been studied extensively in Bacteria or Eukarya, relatively little is known in the
Archaea. Halophilic Archaea are the predominant microorganisms in hot and hypersaline
environments such as salted lakes, hot springs or salted ponds. Consequently, the denitrifying
haloarchaea that sustain the nitrogen cycle under these conditions have emerged as an important
target for research aimed at understanding microbial life in these extreme environments.
The haloarchaeon Haloferax mediterranei was isolated 20 years ago from Santa Pola salted ponds
(Alicante, Spain). It was described as a denitrifier and it is also able to grow using NO3-, NO2- or
NH4+ as inorganic nitrogen sources. This review summarizes the advances that have been made in
understanding the N-cycle in halophilic archaea using Hfx mediterranei as a haloarchaeal model. The
results obtained show that this microorganism could be very attractive for bioremediation
applications in those areas where high salt, nitrate and nitrite concentrations are found in ground
waters and soils.

Background
Nitrogen (N) is a major element in all organisms. It
accounts for approximately 6% of their dry mass on average and thus in nature its assimilation is a key process of
the N-cycle carried out by higher plants [1], algae [2],
yeast [3], and bacteria [4]. In the environment, N can be
found in different redox states from +5 (as nitrate) to -3
(as ammonia), but in biological compounds it is almost
exclusively present in the most reduced form as a component of the two pre-eminent biological macromolecules:

proteins and nucleic acids [5]. The reactions of the global
biogeochemical N-cycle makes possible the interconvertions of nitrogen compounds and it includes both reductive and oxidative processes, in which prokaryotes play a
predominant role (Fig. 1).
The assimilatory pathways of the N-cycle (N2 fixation and
nitrate assimilation) generate ammonium that is then
incorporated into the carbon skeletons to produce amino
acids. However, whereas N2 fixation is carried out by free-

N-cycle scheme. NO3- is used as nitrogen source for growth under aerobic conditions using an assimilatory NO3- reductase,
while it acts as an electron acceptor to eliminate excess of reductant power through dissimilatory NO3- reduction. Dissimilatory
NO3- reduction, NO3- respiration or denitrification are often used equivalently in the literature. However, dissimilatory pathway
makes reference to non-assimilatory reactions that are not directly coupled to generation of proton-motive force. In some
Enterobacteriaceae, NO2- is reduced to NH4+ which is then excreted; this process is known as NO3-/NO2- ammonification. Specialised organisms are able to oxidize either NH4+ or NO2- by using a pathway called nitrification, while other organisms such as
some planctomycetes oxidize NH4+ and utilize NO2- as respiratory electron acceptor in a pathway named anammox. Finally,
(di)nitrogen fixation allows several bacteria and archaea to reduce N2 to NH4+ to provide N-requirements.

living or symbiotic diazotrophic prokaryotes, assimilatory
nitrate reduction is a property of many species of bacteria,
fungi, algae, higher plants and Archaea. Nitrification and
denitrification are redox processes involving nitrogen compounds to obtain metabolic energy. Nitrification consists
of the oxidative conversion of ammonia to nitrite via
hydroxylamine, and further oxidation of nitrite to nitrate
[6]. On the other hand denitrification is a respiratory
process (under anaerobic conditions) whereby nitrate is
reduced to nitrite, NO, N2O and N2. Ammonification is the
dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonia that does
not serve the purpose of nitrogen autotrophy [7]. Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) is a reaction that produces N2 by reducing nitrite and oxidizing ammonium.
This process, recently described, seems to be of ecological
importance in marine environments [8].
Some of the compounds produced thanks to N-cycle reactions could affect life in different ways. Related to this,

nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) have impact
on the atmosphere: i) N2O is a more potent greenhouse
gas than CO2 contributing to global warming, ii) in the
stratosphere, N2O and NO destroy the ozone layer that
protects organisms against UV light, iii) NO can be chemically oxidized to NO2, which is further hydrated to HNO2
and HNO3 (components of the acid rain). Besides, it is
very important to note that when fertilizers are used at
high concentrations or are not used by plants or microorganisms, products such as NO3- or NO2- can enter the
aquifers [9,10]. The consumption of drinking water containing high NO3- and NO2- concentrations causes human
health concerns because NO2- interacts with haemoglobin. This results in the inhibition of the oxygen transport through the human body which is known as
metahemoglobinemia. It has also been demonstrated that
different kinds of gastric cancer are associated with the
consumption of water with high nitrate and nitrite concentrations [11].

Although the N-cycle is well characterised in bacteria from
physiological, biochemical and genetic points of view,
there are few studies centred on this metabolic pathway in
halophilic archaea. These studies, carried out with several
Haloferax, Haloarcula and Halobacterium species, are
mainly focused on denitrification [12-17]. Related to this,
Hfx mediterranei is the only halophilic archaeon from
which assimilatory pathway has been analysed in detail
[18-22]. Recent studies on the respiratory nitrate pathway
have revealed that respiratory nitrate reductases from Hfx
mediterranei or Har marismortui are facing on the positive
face of the membrane, instead of having the active site facing the cytoplasm as it has been reported for most of the
bacterial nitrate reductases [16,23]. This review covers the
current knowledge on N-cycle in Hfx mediterranei with the
objective to shed light on the haloarchaeal nitrogen
metabolism and its implications on several environmental issues.
Assimilatory nitrate reduction in Hfx mediterranei
Nitrate assimilation is one of the main processes of the Ncycle, and it allows the use of NO3- as N source for growth.
In silico studies have revealed that genes encoding the proteins involved in nitrate assimilation have been found in
the genomes of the two major Archaea subgroups: crenarchaeota and euryarchaeota [24]. However, physiological
and biochemical characterisation of NO3- assimilation
have been performed only in Hfx mediterranei at the time
of writing this review.

In the assimilatory nitrate reduction, first NO3- is incorporated into the cells by high-affinity transporters and further reduced to NH4+, via NO2-, by two sequential
reduction reactions catalysed by assimilatory nitrate
reductase (Nas; EC 1.6.6.2) and assimilatory nitrite
reductase (Nir; EC 1.7.7.1). The NH4+ produced is incorporated into carbon skeletons by the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway (GS-GOGAT; EC
6.3.1.2, EC 1.4.7.1, respectively) or via glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; EC 1.4.1.2). The GS/GOGAT pathway is
particularly important because it allows ammonia assimilation into L-Glu at low intracellular ammonia concentrations and it seems that it efficiently substitutes the other
glutamate biosynthetic reaction (GDH) in these conditions. Nevertheless, in some bacteria it has been found
that GDH is not significantly affected by the type or the
concentration of the nitrogen source supplied [25].
NO3- uptake
In bacteria, the genes coding for the regulatory and structural proteins required for NO3- uptake and reduction are,
in most cases, clustered [26] and frequently NO3- is transported into the cells by an active system. Two types of
nitrate transporters are involved in prokaryotic assimilatory nitrate reduction: ATP-dependent ABC transporters

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/9

(composed of an integral membrane subunit, a cytoplasmic ATP-binding component and a periplasmic substratebinding protein) and the monomeric NarK-type transporters belonging to the major facilitator superfamily
(MFS-type permease), which depend on proton-motive
force. ABC transporters form a widespread protein family
present in Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya. In the haloarchaeal Hfx volcanii, three genomic regions containing
genes coding for ABC transporters subunits involved in
nitrate respiration were characterised [27], but there is not
any evidence of its participation in the assimilatory process. These genes have been characterised from genomic
libraries contructed using several nitrate respiration-deficient Hfx volcanii mutants. Most archaea with putative
ABC nitrate transporters seem to contain respiratory
nitrate reductases rather than assimilatory nitrate reductases.
Within the bacterial NarK-like transporters there are two
subgroups: NarK1 (proton: nitrate symporter that allows
initiation of nitrate respiration) and NarK2 (nitrate:
nitrite antiporter required for maintenance of a steadystate rate) [28]. Some of these proteins are involved in
NO3-/NO2- exchange rather than simply in the uptake of
one of these anions, but the mechanism of the transport
has not been determined for any of these bacterial MFS
importers. It has been suggested that bacterial nitrate
assimilation usually requires ATP-dependent ABC nitrate
transporters whereas nitrate respiration is associated with
proton-motive-force driven NarK transporters [28].
Database comparisons of the genes involved in the assimilation of nitrate in Hfx mediterranei revealed that nasB
gene (Q703N4) encodes a NO3- transporter with a molecular mass around 46.1 kDa. This transporter is a membrane protein with 12 potential α helices and is most
closely related with the NarK1 type of transporters. The
best fits of nasB gene were with bacterial homologues,
such as Thermus thermophilus, Paracoccus halodenitrificans
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [20]. nasB from Hfx mediterranei is the first NarK transporter reported to date in
Archaea, which suggests that the NarK group could be
involved in the assimilatory process and it is not exclusive
to Bacteria and Eukarya as it had originally been suggested.
Nitrate and nitrite assimilation
When nitrate is imported into Hfx mediterranei cells, it is
reduced to nitrite by the ferredoxin dependent assimilatory nitrate reductase (Nas). In general, Nas are cytoplasmic enzymes that catalyse the two-electron reduction of
NO3- to NO2-. They are repressed by ammonium and use
either NADH or ferredoxin as physiological electron
donors, although some use flavodoxin instead of ferredoxin. Fd-Nas are usually monomeric enzymes while
NADH-dependent Nas have been described as het-

erodimeric proteins [29]. Both of them are structurally
and functionally different from the dissimilatory periplasmic nitrate reductases (Nap; EC 1.7.99.4) and the respiratory membrane-bound nitrate reductases (Nar; EC
1.7.99.4) present in many prokaryotes. On the basis of the
gene sequence and the UV-Vis spectra, Hfx mediterranei
ferredoxin-dependent Nas (Q703N5) contains a Mo-bismolybdopterin guanine dinucleotide cofactor (Mo-bisMGD) and one [4Fe-4S] cluster [19,20]. In this case, the
electrons probably flow from the [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing ferredoxin (which is a negative redox potential electron donor) to the [4Fe-4S] cluster and from this centre to
the Mo-cofactor for the reduction of NO3- (Fig. 2). Hfx
mediterranei Nas was first described as a dimeric enzyme
[19]. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed that this
enzyme is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass
around 75 kDa and it is most closely related with monomeric bacterial ferredoxin-dependent Nas proteins [20].
The highest similarity scores were to the Nas proteins of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Xanthomonas campestris and Synechococcus elongates [20]. The comparison with the products
of the putative assimilatory nitrate reductase genes from
other archaea showed that there was only a low overall
similarity between these and assimilatory nitrate reductase from Hfx mediterranei, with conserved residues pre-

dominantly being associated with the cofactor binding
sites. Nas kinetic parameters have been obtained that suggest that the Km for nitrate is around 0.95 mM and the
enzyme has maximum activity at 80°C in 3.1 M NaCl, but
60°C in 1.3 M NaCl. Nas can receive electron from methylviologen and benzylviologen but not NAD(P)H. Nas
activity is induced by nitrate and repressed by ammonium, as described for bacterial Nas [20,22]. Up to now,
this is the only Nas purified and characterised from a biochemical and genetical point of view from haloarchaea.
Nitrite produced by Nas is reduced to ammonium by
ferredoxin dependent assimilatory nitrite reductase
(Q703N2) that catalyses the six-electron reduction of
NO2-. As it has been described above for Nas, assimilatory
nitrite reductases are classified into two groups according
to the electron donor specificity: Fd-dependent Nir
(described from eukaryotic and prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms) and NAD(P)H-dependent Nir (present
in fungi and most heterotrophic bacteria). Fd-Nirs are
cytoplasmic monomeric proteins with molecular mass
around 55 kDa. They contain a siroheme and a [4Fe-4S]
cluster as redox centres. The electrons flow from ferredoxin to Nir in a similar way to that described for Nas
(electrons from the [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing ferredoxin

are transferred to the [4Fe-4S] cluster and from this centre
to the siroheme for the reduction of nitrite). On the other
hand, NADH-Nirs consist of two subunits, and contain
non covalently bound FAD, a [4Fe-4S] cluster, and siroheme as prosthetic groups. The assimilatory nitrite reductase purified from Hfx mediterranei, the first one purified
from this kind of microorganisms, is a 66 kDa monomer
that shows a strong sequence similarity with known ferredoxin-dependent nitrite reductases, such as those of Synechocystis sp., Plectonema boryanum and Synechococcus
elongatus. Some of its biochemical properties have been
analysed in detail showing that it has a Km for nitrite of 8.6
mM, and maximal activity at 60°C in presence of 3.3 M
NaCl. Like most of the bacterial assimilatory nitrite
reductases described so far, the Hfx mediterranei Nir contains siroheme and Fe-S centres [18,20].
The Hfx mediterranei ferredoxin involved in the electron
transfer to Nas or Nir is a small protein (Mr ≈ 21 kDa on
SDS-PAGE) [30,31] that shows UV-Vis, NMR and EPR
spectra similar to those described from plant and bacteria
ferredoxins containing one [2Fe-2S] cluster. The electron
paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the reduced form of
the protein displayed a rhombic signal, with gx = 1.91, gy
= 1.98, gz = 2.07. UV-visible spectropotentiometric analysis determined a midpoint redox potential for the [2Fe2S]2+/1+ transition of around -285 mV vs. SHE that was
independent of salt concentration. Significantly, this
ferredoxin was shown to be a highly thermostable protein. It was stable up to 60°C in a low-salt (0.2 M)
medium and this increased to 80°C in a high-salt (4 M)
medium. Ferredoxins from other halophilic archaea such
as Hbt halobium [32], Har marismortui [33], and Har
japonica [34] have been purified and characterised and in
all cases they contain a [2Fe-2S] cluster. However,
although all of them belong to the plant type differences
between these two groups have been emphasised [32].
Ammonium transport and assimilation
When ammonium is the nitrogen source for growth, the
first step is its across biological membranes facilitated by
the ammonium transporter (Amt). Amt transporters are
integral membrane proteins that allow the ammonium
and methylammonium uptake. This kind of transporter is
well characterised in Bacteria and Eukarya domains, however it still remains quite unknown in Archaea, in fact only
the Amt from Archaeoglobus fulgidus [35] has been studied
to date from the Archaea domain. Recent structural information on two prokaryotic Amt proteins has significantly
contributed to our understanding of these transporters
[36]. The mechanisms involved in the ammonium uptake
in Hfx mediterranei are unknown at the time of writing this
paper. However, the processes related to the assimilation
of ammonium produced by Nir in this archaea have been
recently described in our group [22].

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/9

Glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase (GS-GOGAT)
and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) are the main pathways for ammonium assimilation in several microorganisms including Hfx mediterranei. The first pathway requires
ATP but has high affinity for ammonium, whereas GDH
does not consume ATP but is less effective in cells growing
in N-limited conditions. These enzymes are present in all
three domains of life.
Glutamine synthetase (GS), the first enzyme of the GS/
GOGAT pathway, has been extensively studied at both
biochemical and molecular levels in prokaryotes, mammals and some methanogenic and hyperthermophilic
archaea [37,38]. This enzyme plays a dual role by providing glutamine for biosynthesis and by assimilating
ammonium in collaboration with glutamate synthase. In
summary, three types of GS have been described based on
the molecular size and the number of subunits. GSI is a
dodecameric protein with subunit ranging between 44
and 60 kDa, and is usually found among several groups of
bacteria and archaea [39,40]. GSII is common in eukaryotes and a few soil-dwelling bacteria as an octameric
enzyme composed of subunits ranging between 35 and 50
kDa [41]. Finally, GSIII has been characterised from
cyanobacteria and two anaerobic bacteria as a hexameric
enzyme composed of a 75 kDa subunits [42].
Few analyses have been carried out with GS from members of Archaea, and just two are from GS from haloarchaea [21,43]; these enzymes, purified from Hfx
mediterranei and Hbt salinarium are octamers belonging to
the GS type II [21,43]. However, a few GSs described from
methanogenic or hyperthermophilic archaea are
dodecamers of about 600 kDa. So, GS from haloarchaea
exhibits typical properties of GS from eukaryotes and soil
bacteria species. This fact supports the hypothesis that
some members of Archaea are quite like eukaryotic organisms because both of them share similar properties at
physiological and metabolic levels [44]. The results
obtained from Hfx mediterranei suggest that GS from this
haloarchaea could allow the assimilation of the ammonium produced by assimilatory nitrite reductase [21,22],
while GDH would allow the assimilation of ammonium
when this nitrogen source is present in the culture media
at high concentrations. The biochemical characterisation
of Hfx mediterranei GS shows an optimum pH value for
activity around 8. Either in the presence of NaCl or KCl,
the maximum stability was found at the highest salt concentration described by us (3.5 M and 2.5 M, respectively). The Km value for ADP could not be calculated for
the transferase activity, as all concentrations analysed produced similar results (Km around 3.10 ± 0.5 mM). The
apparent Km for NH2OH, Gln, ATP and Glu were 10.5 ±
3.5, 25 ± 1.8, 0.30 ± 0.08 and 4.9 ± 1.5 mM, respectively.
These values are similar to those described in Hbt sali-

narium GS and are in the range described for GS from different cyanobacteria [45] and Archaea [46]. GS activity
decreased substantially in the presence of MSX (an irreversible inhibitor of bacterial GS) as it was described from
other prokaryotic GS [22]. Studies about the effectiveness
of different metal ions on the activity assay revealed that
Mn2+ was the most effective ion for transferase activity as
it was expected due to its essential role as a cofactor.
Glutamate synthase, the second enzyme of the GS/
GOGAT cycle, is an NADPH dependent enzyme in most
of bacteria and it has two dissimilar enzyme subunits α
and β that forms the αβ active protomer which contains
one FAD, one FMN, and three different [Fe-S] centres: one
[3Fe-4S] cluster and two [4Fe-4S] centres [47]. The plant
type GOGAT is dependent on reduced ferredoxin as physiological electron donor and it is formed by a single
polypeptide chain similar in sequence and cofactor content (one FMN, and one [3Fe-4S] cluster) to the α subunit
of the bacterial enzyme.
Whether Archaea contain a bacterial type, a plant type or a
fourth class still needs to be verified. Methanococcus jannaschii genome sequencing first revealed the presence of
one ORF encoding a 490 residues polypeptide that
appears to be formed by an N-terminal domain containing the Cys-signature typical of two bacterial ferredoxins
[4Fe-4S] clusters followed by a polypeptide mapping on
the synthase domain of NADPH-GltS α subunit [47]. A
similar ORF has been found in A fulgidus and appears to
be conserved in other Archaea and in Thermatogales as the
result of lateral gene transfer. It has also been proposed
that a fifth type of glutamate synthase may exist. An ORF
encoding a 50 kDa protein of Pyrococcus sp. KOD1 with
significant sequence similarity to NADPH-GltS β subunit
has been found and it was assigned the gene name of gltA
[47]. The analysis of the halophilic archaeal genomes
sequenced suggested that in Har marismortui, Natronomonas pharaonis and Haloquadratum walsbyi there are open
reading frames of about 1500 residues similar in sequence
to the plant type ferredoxin dependent glutamate synthase and to the bacterial NADPH glutamate synthase α
subunit, but there is not evidence of the presence of an
open reading frame corresponding to a polypeptide similar to the bacterial NADPH glutamate synthase β subunit.
In Hfx mediterranei, we have detected activity of glutamate
synthase with methylviologen as reducing agent in
extracts from cells grown with ammonium starvation
(data not published). Analysis of the gene sequence
revealed a high degree of homology with ORFs of
sequenced genomes of Fd-dependent glutamate synthases. The classification of archaeal glutamate synthase
and particularly of haloarchaeal glutamate synthase stills
needs to be verified by biochemical characterization.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/9

As it has been cited before, Hfx mediterranei is able to
assimilate ammonium via glutamate dehydrogenase
(GDH) [48]. This is an important enzyme because it catalyses the interconvertion between 2-oxoglutarate and Lglutamate reversibly and plays a key role since it provides
a link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Several
studies have demonstrated that under nitrogen-sufficient
conditions, GDH mainly catalyses glutamate production
from 2-oxoglutarate and ammonium. However, under
nitrogen-starvation conditions, GS produces glutamine
from glutamate and ammonium, and glutamine is then
converted to glutamate by GOGAT. The GS-GOGAT pathway is the major route for utilization of ammonium when
ammonium is deficient [49] because GS has a much lower
Km for ammonium than does GDH. However, in some
bacteria it has been found that GDH is active under low
ammonium conditions [25].
GDHs are classified into three groups according to their
coenzyme specificity: NAD or NADP-specific and
NAD(P)-non specific dependent GDH. Hfx mediterranei
has at least two different GDHs: NADP-GDH and NADGDH [48,50].
Assimilatory nitrate pathway regulation in Hfx
mediterranei
In Hfx mediterranei a 6,720 bp genomic fragment was
sequenced containing homologues of the nitrate assimilation genes nasABC and D, which code for assimilatory
nitrate reductase (nasA, Q703N5), a nitrate transporter
belonging to NarK group (nasB, Q703N4), cited above, a
molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide biosynthesis protein (nasC, Q703N3) and an assimilatory nitrite reductase
(nasD, Q703N2). RT-PCR studies demonstrated [21] that
nasABC are cotranscribed but nasD is transcribed as a
monocistronic messenger which is a novel organization in
comparison with bacterial nas operons where, in general,
bacterial nitrite reductase gene is found within the nitrate
reductase gene operon [51]. The location of Hfx mediterranei nitrite reductase gene outside of nas operon raises
interesting questions regarding the regulation of nasABC
and nasD in relation to the cellular demand for nitrogen
assimilation. Both promoters show a good match to the
archaeal consensus TATA box, and transcription factor B
responsive element. Moreover, palindromic regions were
identified that may be implicated in regulation. Taken
together, both promoters could be controlled by common
and different modulators.

In ammonium medium, transcription of nasABC or nasD
was not detected, but in minimal medium with nitrate
both were transcribed, indicating that these genes were
coding for a nitrate assimilation system. Moreover, nasABC mRNA was detected in minimal medium supplemented with nitrite, suggesting that the absence of

Saline Systems 2008, 4:9

ammonium was the effector of expression. The results
obtained from physiological experiments were in agreement with those obtained from the analysis of the expression of nasA and nasD genes, i.e, ammonium repressed
the expression of the assimilatory genes. However, in the
presence of nitrate or nitrite as nitrogen sources, nasA and
nasD expression levels increased under different culture
conditions. This mechanism is a general control, which
responds to the availability of the preferred nitrogen
source: ammonium.
In addition to the short-term inhibitory effect of ammonium on nitrate uptake, ammonium can exert a negative
effect on nitrate assimilation by affecting the activity levels
of the enzymes involved in the assimilatory pathway. This
ammonium effect, which was described many years
before in bacteria and cyanobacteria [52], requires a more
prolonged time scale to be expressed. Results obtained
from Hfx mediterranei suggest that ammonium also causes
the same long-term effect on both assimilatory activities,
Nas and NiR. In cyanobacteria, the simultaneous presence
in the medium of nitrate and ammonium is equivalent to
that of ammonium alone [52]. So, the regulatory pattern
of the assimilatory pathway in Hfx mediterranei is similar
to those described for halotolerant bacteria [49], bacteria
[4] and cyanobacteria [52], i.e., ammonium represses nas
gene expression and inhibits the nitrate assimilation pathway, wheras nitrate is an inducer of gene expression.
Accordingly, it has been observed that in the presence of
ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrite, ammonium is
preferentially consumed by Hfx mediterranei cells.
New strategies should be addressed in the next few years
in order to elucidate the mechanisms and the proteins
involved in the regulation of the assimilatory metabolic
pathway in Hfx mediterranei.
Denitrification
Denitrification, the biological production of NO, N2O
and N2 gases from NO3- under anoxic conditions, is a key
process that contributes to the nitrogen cycle of the Earth
[53]. In this pathway, nitrate may be reduced to N2 thanks
to the reactions catalysed by respiratory nitrate reductase,
respiratory nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase and
nitrous oxide reductase. Each of these enzymes is coupled
to energy-conserving electron-transport pathways [54].
Denitrifying microorganisms are distributed among the
three domains of the life: Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya
and are able to respire oxygen, indicating a close evolutionary relationship between the two processes, where
denitrification has been considered so far the ancestor of
aerobic respiration [55,56]. The ability to use nitrate as a
terminal electron acceptor in energy metabolism is found
in several halophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea:
many of them can perform the entire denitrification proc-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/9

ess. However this process has only been partially
described from biochemical or genetically point of views
from some haloarchaea species (Halobacterium sp., Hfx
mediterranei, Hfx denitrificans and Har marismortui).
Nitrate reduction
Membrane-bound nitrate reductase (Nar) is the enzyme
involved in anaerobic nitrate respiration and denitrification, being negatively regulated by O2 and unaffected by
ammonium. These enzymes are composed of a catalytic
subunit that binds a complex organic cofactor [the bismolybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis-MGD) cofactor] (NarG) and an electron-transfer subunit with four
iron-sulphur centres (NarH). In most of bacteria, this
complex bound to a membrane dihaem b quinol-oxidizing component (NarI). Nar enzymes have been purified
from several denitrifying haloarchaea belonging to Haloferax and Haloarcula genera. In some cases such us Hfx denitrificans, Har marismortui and Hfx mediterranei, the
enzyme has been purified as a heterodimeric protein composed of two subunits with molecular masses around 116,
117, or 112 kDa (Nar G) and 60, 47 or 61 kDa (NarH),
respectively [15]. In other species such as Hfx denitrificans
[14] or Hfx volcanii [13], Nar has been described as a heterotrimeric (100, 61 and 31 kDa) protein. In Hfx mediterranei two different nitrate reductases involved in nonassimilatory processes have been reported: Nar (characterised in our group) and a dissimilatory nitrate reductase
studied by Alvarez-Ossorio et al [12]. The last one seems
to be a protein with higher molecular mass and most of its
enzymatic properties are different to those described from
the enzyme characterised in our laboratory [15], so it is
possible to think that the enzyme purified by Alvarez,
described as a dissimilatory protein, allows the dissipation of reducing power for redox balancing. This possible
role should be addressed by physiological analysis.

The N-terminal region of Har marismortui and Hfx mediterranei NarG includes a typical twin-arginine signal peptide
for protein translocation across the membrane by TAT
export pathway (twin arginine-dependent translocase)
[23], and both enzymes have activity in situ with both,
membrane permeable benzylviologen and membraneimpermeable methylviologen, suggesting that the catalytic site is located on the outside of the membrane.
Therefore, based on subunit composition, subcellular
location of the active site and nar gene organization, it can
be concluded that archaeal Nars are a new type of enzyme
with the active site facing the outside and anchored to the
membrane by a cytochrome b (as it has been proposed for
Hfx mediterranei system) or stabilized by the lipid environment in the membrane as described for the P. aerophilum
Nar [57]. This system could be an ancient respiratory
nitrate reductase, although the nitrite formed could also

be assimilated. The outside location of the catalytic site of
NarG in the halophilic archaeal Nar has important bioenergetic implications because to be energy-conserving
require the coupling of this process to a proton-motive
complex [23], instead of the typical redox-loop mechanisms, the NarI subunit described in bacteria. On the
other hand, it seems that an active nitrate-uptake system
would not be required for respiratory nitrate reduction in
archaea, thus increasing the energetic yield of the nitrate
reduction process (Fig 3).
Nitrite reduction
Nitrite produced by Nar is reduced to NO by the respiratory nitrite reductases. This reaction also takes place under
anoxic conditions and it is not as well known as nitrate
respiration in haloarchaea. In bacteria two different respiratory nitrite reductases have been reported: the homotrimeric copper-containing enzyme (encoded by nirK) and
the homodimeric cytochrome cd1-nitrite reductase
(encoded by nirS). The haem-containing enzyme seems to
be more common in prokarya members and it has been
described from different bacteria such as many Pseudomonas and Paracoccus species. The enzymes containing
Cu and haem never coexist within the same bacterial species [58]. Up to now, only two respiratory nitrite reductases have been characterised from a haloarchaea member;
these are the enzymes from Har marismortui and Hfx deni-

trificans, which contain two Cu centres, and in both cases,
the protein is encoded by the nirK gene. It has been suggested that the physiological electron donor for this protein could be halocyanin, a blue Cu-protein present in
some Archaea [59]. This issue should be also addressed in
Hfx mediterranei.
NO, N2O, N2 production
Nitric oxide (NO), the product of the respiratory nitrite
reductases, is a toxic compound that is reduced to N2O by
nitric oxide reductases (Nor) immediately after it has been
generated. Different Nor enzymes from fungal denitrifiers
and denitrifying bacteria have been analysed. In some
cases, Nor is a soluble monomeric enzyme belonging to
the cytochrome P-450 family [60]. In other microorganisms, Nor has been described as a membrane complex of
a 17 kDa cytochrome c and a 38 kDa cytochrome b with
12 transmembrane regions. This enzyme is known such as
cNor. It is not clear which class of Nor evolved first and it
would thus be informative to characterise some Nors from
denitrifying Archaea [54]. With regard to halophilic
archaea, there is evidence for the presence of Nor (from
physiological and biochemical studies) only in Har marismortui and Hfx denitrificans [24].

The last step of denitrification, the reduction of N2O to
N2, is of great environmental importance because it closes

the N-cycle. N2O is less toxic than NO or nitrite and the
vast majority of microorganisms could manage without
converting N2O into N2. However, most denitrifying bacteria contain nitrous oxide reductases (Nos) encoded by
nosZ gene which reduced N2O into N2. These enzymes are
soluble periplasmic multicopper homodimers that receive
electrons from cythorome c or pseudoaurin [7].

Operon structure of denitrification genes in Hfx
mediterranei
Denitrification and other anaerobic respiratory processes
are alternative metabolic pathways developed by facultative microorganisms to obtain energy for growth under
anoxic conditions, and therefore they are usually
repressed by oxygen [63]. The control of the genes
involved in this pathway is well studied in denitrifying
bacteria. Although, the molecular basis of the regulatory
networks of denitrification is beginning to emerge in
halophilic archaea, they are still not well resolved. Molecules such us O2, NO3-, NO2- and NO, act as signals to
induce the regulation of this pathway. Related to this,
more than one type of regulatory protein is involved in
sensing the molecules cited above in bacteria: i) oxygen
sensors (FixL and FNR) [64]; ii) nitrate and nitrite sensors
(NarXL, NarPQ and NarR) [65]; iii) nitric oxide sensors
(NNR and NoR); iv) redox sensors (Reg regulon) [66] and
v) NiR and NosR proteins (essential proteins for expression and transcription of the nos and nir gene cluster)
[67,68].

In some halophilic archaea, such as Haloarcula it was
described that the predominant gas species produced by
denitrification is N2O [61]. However, a few years later,
other studies suggested that, nitrite and N2 were produced
during exponential growth. When Har marismortui culture
enters stationary phase, dinitrogen production ceases, the
concentration of nitrite in the medium rapidly decreases
and nitrous oxide is accumulated. Other haloarchaea such
as Hfx denitrificans are able to reduce N2O to N2, having a
complete denitrification pathway [62].
The first of this kind of physiological experiment developed with Hfx mediterranei suggested that it produces dinitrogen during exponential growth accompanied of the
accumulation of low quantities of nitrite and did not produce nitrous oxide [17]. However, recently, the production of N2O has been quantified from Hfx mediterranei
cultures (Fig 4).

There are only few in silico studies which reveal that potential regulators involved in bacterial nitrate reduction
(cited above) are not present in the few archaeal genomes
sequenced to date. This fact suggests that a novel regulatory system could operate in archaea. Some studies in
methanogenic archaea demonstrated that Mo also regulates the expression of the genes required for archaeal
molybdoproteins [69].

In general, bacterial and archaeal respiratory nitrate systems also differ in the organization of the genes [70]. The
main narGHJI operon organization is conserved in most
bacteria; nevertheless halophilic archaea nar genes do not
conserve this organization. In Har marismortui, for example, two small ORFs and a NarJ homologue are located
downstream from the narGH genes, and putative genes
encoding an iron-sulphur protein and a cytochrome b are
located upstream from narGH [16]. Similar organization
has been found in Hfx mediterranei Nar system. In this
case, the nar operon encodes eight open reading frames
(ORF1, narB, narC, ORF4, narG, narH, ORF7 and narJ).
ORF1 (Q703I0), ORF4 (Q703H7) and ORF7 (Q703H3)
are open reading frames showing similarity with small
proteins (molecular mass around 20 kDa) involved in
electron transport. narB (Q703H9) codes for a 219amino-acid-residue Rieske iron-sulfur protein. The ORF 1,
4 and 7 and NarB are predicted to form a quinol-dependent electron transfer system that could be coupled to free
energy transduction by a Q-cycle mechanism. narC
(Q703H8) encodes a protein of 486 amino acid residues
identified by databases searches as cytochrome-b (narC).
The narG (Q703H6) gene encodes a protein with 983
amino acid residues and is identified as a respiratory
nitrate reductase catalytic subunit (narG). NarH protein
has been identified as an electron transfer respiratory
nitrate reductase subunit (narH, Q703H5)). The last ORF
encodes a chaperonin-like protein (narJ, Q703H4) of 242
amino acid residues [15].
As the nar genes were present before the phylogenetic
divergence of bacteria and archaea, it can be assumed that
respiratory nitrate reductase played a key role in energy
metabolism during pre-oxic times.
We used RT-PCR to determine the effect of anaerobic conditions and nitrate in the expression of the nar operon in
Hfx mediterranei. In summary, regulation of nar genes
occurs at transcriptional level, and is influenced by oxygen-limiting conditions and the presence of nitrate. No
regulatory protein could be identified in the vicinity of the
nar operon, but the presence of a set of palindromic
sequences in the promoter suggests that the transcriptional regulation occurs via protein binding. No known
regulatory sequence patterns have been identified, indicating that this transcriptional regulation could be novel
in the denitrifier organisms.
Hfx mediterranei role in bioremediation processes
Denitrification is important process in agriculture where it
results in the loss of nitrate fertilizers from fields and in
waste-treatment processes where nitrate must be removed
from waste waters before release into the environment.
Nitrate and nitrite have important agricultural, environmental, and public health implications [4]. The manufac-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/9

turing of chemicals compounds (pesticides, herbicides,
explosives, etc.) usually generates effluents containing
complex mixtures of salts and nitrate or nitrite. The capacity of microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants is
severely limited by their ability to survive or proliferate in
these waste waters [71]. The increase of salinity and
nitrate/nitrite concentrations in soils and ground waters
in the last few decades has focused much attention on the
physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in
salt-stress tolerance and nitrate metabolism by microorganisms [72]. Microorganisms are in general sensitive to
low nitrate and nitrite concentrations. The inhibitory
effect of these nitrogen compounds is due to the extreme
toxicity of nitrite and nitric oxide produced upon nitrate
reduction as it has been mentioned before.
Physiological studies carried out with Hfx mediterranei
have revealed that it is resistant to very high nitrate (up to
2 M) and nitrite (up to 50 mM) concentrations (unpublished data). The nitrite concentration present in the cultures employed is one of the highest yet described for a
prokaryotic microorganism. The nitrite present in the culture medium was removed during the growth of Hfx mediterranei; in fact, at the final of the stationary phase of
growth (OD = 2.2), only 20% of the nitrite present in the
culture was still present in media in which the initial concentration was around 50 mM. So it is possible to envisage
that this haloarchaeon could be applied in water bioremediation processes with the purpose to repair the damage
caused by the excessive use of fertilizers in agricultural
activities. This application could be beneficial in regions
such as Comunidad Valencia or Murcia (Spain), where the
water tables contain high nitrate and nitrite concentrations due to fertilization practices [73].
