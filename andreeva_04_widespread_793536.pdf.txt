Abstract
Background: In eukaryotes, PPP (protein phosphatase P) family is one of the two known protein
phosphatase families specific for Ser and Thr. The role of PPP phosphatases in multiple signaling
pathways in eukaryotic cell has been extensively studied. Unlike eukaryotic PPP phosphatases,
bacterial members of the family have broad substrate specificity or may even be Tyr-specific.
Moreover, one group of bacterial PPPs are diadenosine tetraphosphatases, indicating that bacterial
PPP phosphatases may not necessarily function as protein phosphatases.
Results: We describe the presence in eukaryotes of three groups of expressed genes encoding
"non-conventional" phosphatases of the PPP family. These enzymes are more closely related to
bacterial PPP phosphatases than to the known eukaryotic members of the family. One group, found
exclusively in land plants, is most closely related to PPP phosphatases from some α-Proteobacteria,
including Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales and Rhodospirillaceae. This group is therefore termed
Rhizobiales / Rhodobacterales / Rhodospirillaceae-like phosphatases, or Rhilphs. Phosphatases of the
other group are found in Viridiplantae, Rhodophyta, Trypanosomatidae, Plasmodium and some fungi.
They are structurally related to phosphatases from psychrophilic bacteria Shewanella and Colwellia,
and are termed Shewanella-like phosphatases, or Shelphs. Phosphatases of the third group are
distantly related to ApaH, bacterial diadenosine tetraphosphatases, and are termed ApaH-like
phosphatases, or Alphs. Patchy distribution of Alphs in animals, plants, fungi, diatoms and
kinetoplasts suggests that these phosphatases were present in the common ancestor of eukaryotes
but were independently lost in many lineages. Rhilphs, Shelphs and Alphs form PPP clades, as
divergent from "conventional" eukaryotic PPP phosphatases as they are from each other and from
major bacterial clades. In addition, comparison of primary structures revealed a previously
unrecognised (I/L/V)D(S/T)G motif, conserved in all bacterial and "bacterial-like" eukaryotic PPPs,
but not in "conventional" eukaryotic and archaeal PPPs.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that many eukaryotes possess diverse "bacterial-like" PPP
phosphatases, the enzymatic characteristics, physiological roles and precise evolutionary history of
which have yet to be determined.

Background
Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a ubiquitous
mechanism, indispensable for regulation of virtually any
cellular function. Therefore, protein kinases and phosphatases are of paramount importance for normal functioning of all metabolic and signalling pathways. In
eukaryotes, PPP family is one of the two known protein
phosphatase families specific for Ser and Thr [1-4]. Unlike
eukaryotic (and archaeal [5]) PPP phosphatases, bacterial
members of the family have broad substrate specificity [6]
or may even be Tyr-specific [7-9]. Moreover, one group of
bacterial PPPs are diadenosine tetraphosphatases [10,11].
Unlike eukaryotes, in prokaryotes PPP phosphatases
appear to be facultative, since entirely sequenced genomes
of some bacteria and archaea do not encode them [5,12].
Nevertheless, when present, they appear to play essential
roles [13-15].
Three motifs (GDXHG, GDXXDRG and GNH(E/D)),
highly conserved in the N-terminal subdomains of the
catalytic domains of all PPP phosphatases [10,11], contain most residues which coordinate metal ions in the
active centre [16] and are considered as the signature of
the PPP family.
In a previous work [17] we identified an unusual cDNA
fragment from a moss Physcomitrella patens, showing no
similarities to the known PPP phosphatases beyond the
presence of the GDXHG and GDXXDRG motifs. Detection of homologous cDNA sequences from Arabidopsis
and rice suggested the presence of an unknown PPP group
in plants, distinct from "conventional" eukaryotic PPP
phosphatases [17].
We have now taken advantage of a much greater representation (as compared to 1999) of sequence databases for
various species to further explore this initial observation.
We present the evidence for the existence in eukaryotes of
three "non-conventional" branches of the PPP family. We
also identify a previously unrecognised conserved motif
in the PPP catalytic domain, which can be used as a signature of "bacterial"-type PPP phosphatases.

Results
"Rhizobiales / Rhodobacterales / Rhodospirillaceae – like"
PPP phosphatases in plants
Two Arabidopsis sequences, At3g09960 and At3g09970,
were retrieved using the P. patens fragment [17] as a query
in TBlastN searches. They share 85% identity with each
other at the protein level (see Figure 1). Both genes are
transcribed, since full-length cDNAs have been detected in
a large-scale transcription study [18]. They are arranged
on chromosome 3 in tandem, suggesting their origin by a
recent duplication. A number of ESTs from other plant
species (but none from non-plant eukaryotes) were also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/47

detected by TBlastN searches, which in most cases provide
no evidence for the existence of more than one isoform.
Among prokaryotes, related sequences were detected in
some α-Proteobacteria, the closest matches being with
Rhizobiales, Rhodobacterales and Rhodospirillaceae. Therefore, we designate this group as Rhizobiales / Rhodobacterales / Rhodospirillaceae-like phosphatases, or Rhilphs
(Figure 1; see also Table 1 and Figure 4), and the two Arabidopsis genes products At3g09960 and At3g09970 as
"Rhizobiales-like" phosphatases 1 (RLP1) and 2 (RLP2),
respectively.
Structural features of Rhilphs
All residues that are expected to bind metal ions in the catalytic centre are conserved in Rhilphs (Figure 1). Rhilphs
do not have N- or C-terminal extensions beyond their catalytic domains, which in many PPP phosphatases have
regulatory function and / or interact with regulatory proteins / subunits. Instead, they have characteristic inserts
between the conserved motifs GNH(E/D) and HAG (corresponding to HGG in "conventional" eukaryotic PPPs,
see Figure 1). Notably, much shorter inserts are found at a
similar position in α-proteobacterial phosphatases (group
I in Figure 1). Inserts in both plant Rhilphs and α-proteobacterial phosphatases contain a conserved motif LXXAXPXXH (Figure 1). Similarly to bacteriophage
λphosphatase (λPP [19]), Rhilphs lack a region corresponding to β8, β9 and α9 of eukaryotic PPPs [20-22].
Like bacterial PPP phosphatases, Rhilphs do not have a
SAPNY motif, conserved in the β12-β13 loop of eukaryotic PPPs. Analysis of Rhilph sequences did not reveal targeting or signal peptides.

While this work was in progress, a phosphatase encoded
by an Arabidopsis gene At1g07010 was reported in an independent study [4].
"Shewanella-like" PPP phosphatases in plants, red algae,
fungi and unicellular parasites
We undertook further TBlastN searches using full-length
Arabidopsis RLP2 as a query to see whether Arabidopsis
genome encodes additional "bacterial-like" PPPs. These
searches identified two more genes for putative PPP phosphatases, only distantly related to Rhilphs and to any
other members of the family (Figure 2).

One of these genes is At1g070101. At least three different
predicted products of this gene could be found in protein
databases. On the basis of comparison with EST
sequences, we consider as the correct structure that of
Q8RY10 with Asp and Gly at positions 109 and 208,
respectively (see Figure 2). The other detected gene,
At1g18480, is also represented in the databases by three

distinct deduced proteins. Comparison with A. thaliana
ESTs confirms Q944L7 as the correct structure.
Genomic and EST database searches provided ample evidence for the presence of related phosphatases in a
number of green plants, including multiple angiosperm
species, pine and a unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii (Figure 2; see also Table 1 and Figure 4).
Related sequences were also identified in some fungi (several basidiomycetes and an ascomycete Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but not other ascomycetes), in Apicomplexa,
Trypanosomatidae, and in a red alga Porphyra yezoensis (for
available sequence from the latter species, see Figure 5).
The most closely related prokaryotic phosphatases were
detected in Myxococcus xanthus (δ-Proteobacteria) and psychrophilic bacteria Alteromonadales (γ-Proteobacteria):
uncharacterised phosphatases from Shewanella oneidensis
and Colwellia psychrerythraea and a Tyr-specific phosphatase PPI from Shewanella sp. [8]. Therefore, we designate this phosphatase group as "Shewanella-like"
phosphatases, or Shelphs, and the products of the two
prototype Arabidopsis genes At1g07010 and At1g18480 as
"Shewanella-like" phosphatases 1 (SLP1) and 2 (SLP2),
respectively.
Structural features of Shelphs
Like in Rhilphs, all residues that are expected to bind
metal ions in the catalytic centre are conserved in Shelphs
(see Figure 1). Another feature common with Rhilphs is
the presence of inserts (as compared to "conventional"
eukaryotic PPPs) between the GNHE and H(A/G)G motifs
(Figure 1), which are especially long in plant Shelphs.
However, these inserts share no sequence similarity
between Rhilphs and Shelphs and probably appeared in
the two phosphatase groups independently. Like in
Rhilphs, a region corresponding to β8, β9 and α9 of
eukaryotic PPPs is absent in Shelphs, and the primary
structure of the region corresponding to the β12-β13 loop

is similar to that of typical bacterial PPPs. A.thaliana SLP1
and corresponding Shelph isoform from rice have chloroplast targeting sequence, which could not be detected in
A.thaliana SLP2 and corresponding isoform from Medicago truncatula.
Eukaryotic PPPs distantly related to bacterial diadenosine
tetraphosphatases
Identification of Rhilphs and Shelphs prompted us to perform extensive searches of eukaryotic sequence databases.
These searches revealed the existence of other "bacteriallike" PPP phosphatases throughout eukaryotes.
Sequences only distantly related to Rhilphs, Shelphs or
any other PPP phosphatases were detected in several fungi
(including a putative S. cerevisiae phosphatase reported
previously [23]), in Trypanosomatidae, a tick Amblyomma,
an ascidian Ciona, Chlamydomonas, pine and diatoms Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Blast
searches using these sequences revealed that all of them
share higher similarity to bacterial diadenosine tetraphosphatases (ApaH) than to other PPP groups. Therefore, we
tentatively designate them as ApaH-like phosphatases, or
Alphs (Figures 3 and 4; Table 1; partial sequences available for pine and diatoms are shown in Figure 5).

Alphs share a distinctive common structural feature. In
the GDXXDRG motif, absolutely conserved in other PPPs,
the second Asp (which stabilises the protonation of a His
that directly participates in catalysis [20]) is replaced by a
neutral amino acid, and the Arg residue (which coordinates phosphate [24]) is replaced, with one exception, by
Lys (Figure 3). The former of these replacements is also
found in ApaH, while the latter is unique to Alphs. While
higher overall sequence similarity and a common alteration in the GDXXDRG motif are compatible with closer
relatedness of Alphs to bacterial diadenosine tetraphosphatases, phylogenetic analysis using full length
sequences failed to produce a robust tree due to high
sequence diversity (not shown).

Relationship of novel eukaryotic PPP groups to known PPP
phosphatases
In order to better understand the relationship of "bacterial-like" PPP phosphatases in eukaryotes to each other
and to bacterial PPPs, we attempted to extend our previous phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic PPP phosphatases
[25] by including PPP sequences from a number of bacteria and archaea. Primary structures of bacterial PPP phosphatases are extremely diverse and, outside the relatively
conserved N-terminal subdomain of about 100 amino
acids containing the GDXHG, GDXXDRG and GNH(E/D)
motifs, they share only a few conserved residues. Moreover, many of the sequences have long insertions at different positions. This leads to the failure to produce
informative alignments of full-length catalytic domains.
Therefore, we aligned more conserved N-terminal subdomains only, an approach applied previously by Kennelly [6] to a much smaller set of PPP sequences available
at that time. Phylogenetic reconstruction was attempted
with either neighbor-joining (as implemented in PHYLIP
[26] or SplitsTree [27]) or maximum likelihood analysis
using quartet puzzling (TreePuzzle [28]); in the latter case
a smaller dataset consisting of with consisting of 32 representative sequences was analyzed due to the inability of
the algorithm to handle large datasets. Due to the relatively short length of the sequences and their high diversity, some of the major clades did not receive significant
bootstrap support and were different depending on the
method used, although most major clades, including

To circumvent the ambiguity of the results, we used
Neighbor-Net [29], a neighbor-joining based method that
constructs phylogenetic networks rather than trees and
thus represents conflicting signals and visualises feasible
trees in a single plot (Figure 4; for a high-resolution
image, see Additional file 1). The Neighbor-Net analysis
accurately identified the major clades such as eukaryotic
and archaeal phosphatases, as well as their closer relationship to each other than to bacterial PPPs [6]. Separation of
"conventional" eukaryotic PPPs into two branches, suggested previously from the analysis of the full-length catalytic domains [25], was also recovered. As it was suggested
by initial sequence similarity searches, Rhilphs, Shelphs
and Alphs represent distinct major clades of the PPP
family, as divergent from "conventional" eukaryotic and
archaeal PPP phosphatases as they are from major bacterial clades (Figure 4; Additional file 1).
Common structural elements in all "bacterial-like" PPP
phosphatases from eukaryotes and bacterial phosphatases
C-terminal regions of the catalytic domain of all "conventional" eukaryotic PPP phosphatases share a highly conserved (with minor variations) SAPNY motif, located in
the β12-β13 loop. This loop and the Tyr residue of the
SAPNY motif in particular are implicated in interaction
with regulators and inhibitors [21,30-32]. β strands (β9
and β10) corresponding to β12 and β13 are conserved in
λPP [19]. However, the sequence on the C-terminal side
of β9 is dissimilar to SAPNY in λPP and in bacterial PPPs.
A conservative replacement of the first Ser of SAPNY by
Thr is found in many bacterial sequences (this Thr is
however only moderately conserved and is replaced by
Glu or Gln in all Rhilphs and by Val or Phe in most
Shelphs). The two adjacent positions are occupied by
highly conserved Asp and Gly residues, respectively, thus
defining a previously unrecognised motif (I/L/V)D(S/T)G.
This motif is present in all examined bacterial PPPs, as
well as in all "bacterial-like" phosphatases from eukaryotes described above (Figure 5; see also Additional file 2 for
a more complete alignment).

In addition, we note the presence of another characteristic
feature of bacterial and "bacterial-like" PPPs: the His residue (H248 in PP1; H186 in λPP) coordinating one of the
metal ions in the catalytic centre is preceded by an absolutely conserved Gly; this residue is conserved in some
archaeal but not in "conventional" eukaryotic PPPs (Figure 5; Additional file 2).

Discussion
In this report, we have documented the presence in different eukaryotic lineages of the genes that encode PPP
phosphatases resembling those of bacterial origin, rather
than "conventional" eukaryotic members of the family.
Catalytic domains of these "bacterial-like" phosphatases
are characterised by relatively conserved structure of the
N-terminal subdomains, but very diverse organisation of
the C-terminal subdomains, where conserved motifs and

residues forming the active centre are separated by
sequences of various length that share little or no similarity between different clades (Figure 6). In most cases, corresponding EST sequences could be detected, which
confirms that these genes are expressed.
The most conspicuous presence of "bacterial-like" PPPs
has been detected in plants. Plants possess phosphatases
from all three novel groups described in this work.

Distinct and
Distinct conserved motifs in the C-termini of bacterial and "bacterial-like" PPP phosphatases from eukaryotes
as opposed to archaeal and eukaryotic PPP phosphatases. A His residue directly binding a metal ion in the catalytic
centre (marked with asterisk), and the elements of secondary structure are shown for bacteriophage λ phosphatase and for
human PP1 according to ref. [20] and [19], respectively. The (I/L/V)D(S/T)G motif, highly conserved in bacterial and "bacteriallike" phosphatases, is highlighted. An expanded version of this alignment can be viewed as the Additional File 2.

Rhilphs are most closely related to PPP phosphatases
from a number of α-proteobacteria, including purple
photosynthetic bacteria and Rhizobiales. The absence of
related sequences in eukaryotes other than land plants
suggests that Rhilphs may have been acquired after plants
started colonising land. Although bacterial lineage that
could be the source for plant Rhilphs could not be unambiguously identified by phylogenetic reconstruction,
Rhizobiales (or purple photosynthetic bacteria from which
Rhizobiales are thought to have originated [33,34]) appear
to be likely candidates. Indeed, Rhizobiales have transmissible chromosomal elements and some, like Agrobacterium, are able to integrate their plasmid genes into plant
genome [35] or even transform animal cells [36], a situation that would be ideally suited for a horizontal gene
transfer to occur. Interestingly, the presence of genes of
rhizobial origin has been detected in plant parasitic nematodes [37]. Possible origin of plant Rhilphs from α-proteobacterial phosphatases is also supported by the

presence in the enzymes of both groups of characteristic
inserts in similar positions, which share some sequence
similarity (see Results).
Phosphatases of another group, designated as Shelphs, are
found in green plants, in a red alga, in Apicomplexa,
Trypanosomatidae, as well as in some fungi. The similarity
between proteins from Apicomplexa and Trypanosomatidae
and those from plants is well documented. Trypanosomatidae are related to photosynthetic euglenoids and are
thought to have lost plastids secondarily [38]. Apicomplexan parasites have a relict plastid, originated from the
engulfment of a red alga [39]. Thus, the presence of phosphatases shared by plants, red algae, Apicomplexa and
Trypanosomatidae is not surprising and probably reflects
the presence of Shelphs in a common ancestor of photosynthetic eukaryotes. The presence of chloroplast targeting sequence in SLP1 suggests a possible origin of Shelphs
from a bacterial precursor of the chloroplast (however it

should be noted that Shelphs are absent from cyanobacteria); alternatively, this sequence may have appeared secondarily.

dephosphorylation is essential for regulation of photosynthesis, and unidentified okadaic acid-insensitive protein phosphatases in chloroplasts have been reported
[40,41]. SLP1 appears to be a good candidate for such a
phosphatase.
The origin of fungal Shelphs is unclear. Curiously, they are
found in basidiomycetes and in an ascomycete S. pombe,
but not in a number of other ascomycetes, whose
genomes have been completed. Current data do not permit to discriminate between (i) the presence of Shelphs in
a common ancestor of eukaryotes and their loss in such
lineages as animals and many fungi, and (ii) independent
acquisition of Shelphs from bacteria by an ancestor of
photosynthetic eukaryotes and by fungi. Further
sequencing of eukaryotic genomes may shed light on the
evolutionary history of this PPP group.

The third group of "bacterial-like" phosphatases detected
in eukaryotes, designated here as Alphs, appears to be distantly related to bacterial diadenosine tetraphosphatases
ApaH. Patchy distribution in several eukaryotic kingdoms
suggests that Alphs were probably present in the common
ancestor of eukaryotes, but were independently lost in
many lineages, including insects, vertebrates and flowering plants. A characteristic modification of the conserved
GDXXDRG motif shared only with ApaH further supports
a suggestion that Alphs may represent a divergent branch
of diadenosine tetraphosphatases, rather than protein
phosphatases. However, relatedness of eukaryotic Alphs
to bacterial diadenosine tetraphosphatases remains hypothetical, since Alph sequences are too divergent from
ApaH, as well as from each other, to permit a reliable phylogenetic reconstruction.
Diadenosine oligophosphates are considered as emerging
signalling molecules in both intra- and intercellular
signalling in eukaryotes [42,43]. In particular, human

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/47

diadenosine oligophosphate hydrolase FHIT has been
identified as a tumor suppressor [44]. It seems plausible
that appearance of eukaryotic diadenosine oligophosphate hydrolases (structurally unrelated to the PPP phosphatases) may have made bacterial-type diadenosine
tetraphosphatases redundant, leading to their loss in
many eukaryotic lineages. It would be interesting to test
experimentally whether Alphs are indeed diadenosine
oligophosphatases.

tant. The crystal structure of bacteriophage λ phosphatase
(PPλ; [19]) shows that the Asp residue of (I/L/V)D(S/T)G
(Asp202) is just downstream of the β9 strand, which
corresponds to the β12 strand in mammalian PP1. In PPλ,
Asp202 is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule coordinated to one of the metal ions in the catalytic centre,
which probably accounts for its conservation. In eukaryotic or archaeal PPPs, corresponding position is occupied
by neutral residues (see Figure 5).

More generally, an important implication of our findings
is that many eukaryotes possess PPP phosphatases with
yet undetermined substrate specificity. Eukaryotic PPP
phosphatases are generally considered as Ser/Thr specific
in vivo, although they may be able to dephosphorylate
phosphoTyr-containing substrates in vitro (e.g. [45,46]).
This is probably true for archaeal PPPs as well [5]. However, Ser/Thr specificity is not a feature of bacterial PPP
phosphatases [7-9,13,47-49]. Thus, it would not be possible to predict substrate specificity of uncharacterised "bacterial-like" PPP phosphatases without experimental
evidence. In particular, since Shewanella PPI is Tyr-specific
[8], it would be interesting to determine substrate specificity of eukaryotic Shelphs. It is also worth noting that
interest in tyrosine phosphorylation in plants has recently
been stimulated by identification of plant Tyr phosphatase genes and by the finding that Tyr phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of stomatal movement
(reviewed by Luan [50]).

It would be tempting to speculate that this difference in
the region just downstream of the β9 (β12) may be
responsible for a feature that is common to all "bacterial"type but not to eukaryotic / archaeal PPPs. One such feature is the Ser/Thr specificity of the latter group. The Tyr
residue of the SAPNY motif has been suggested to provide
a bulky phenol ring in the β12-β13 loop, sufficient to sterically block access of phosphoTyr-containing substrates to
the active site [32]. However this is unlikely to be the sole
determinant of Ser/Thr specificity, since residues containing bulky aromatic rings (Tyr, Phe or Trp) are found in the
same or adjacent positions in many bacterial phosphatases (Figure 5). Since the (I/L/V)D(S/T)G motif,
absent in eukaryotic and archaeal PPPs, is involved in
organisation of the catalytic centre [19], it is possible that
this difference in the catalytic centre organisation may be
one of the determinants of broad substrate specificity vs.
Ser/Thr specificity.

Conclusions
Three motifs, GDXHG, GDXXDRG and GNH(E/D) form
the diagnostic signature of all PPP phosphatases [10,11].
We detected a (I/L/V)D(S/T)G motif, which appears to be
a characteristic signature of "bacterial"-type PPPs. The
existence of such a motif is striking per se, taking into
account extreme structural diversity of bacterial PPP phosphatases. It indicates that (I/L/V)D(S/T)G was probably
present as the fourth "universal" signature motif in the
common ancestor of PPP phosphatases, and was lost in
the common lineage of archaeal and "conventional"
eukaryotic PPPs. An alternative possibility could be that
the (I/L/V)D(S/T)G motif was acquired by a bacterium
and propagated by lateral gene transfer, replacing the
ancestral SAPNY-related motif. However this scenario
seems less likely, since the (I/L/V)D(S/T)G motif is
present, with minor variations, in virtually all bacterial
phosphatases, despite their great diversity, and is replaced
by SAPNY-related sequences only in archaeal and "conventional" eukaryotic PPPs.
The Asp residue in the 2nd position of (I/L/V)D(S/T)G is
highly conserved and can only be replaced by Glu, indicating that the negative charge is essential. The presence of
a highly conserved Gly in the 4th position indicates that
flexibility of the polypeptide chain is likely to be impor-

So far, eukaryotic PPP phosphatases were considered as a
well-defined monophyletic group of enzymes, specifically
dephosphorylating phosphoSer and phosphoThr, while a
much more structurally and enzymatically diverse PPP
phosphatases were known to be present in prokaryotes.
Our findings demonstrate that, in addition to "conventional" eukaryotic PPP Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatases, many eukaryotes possess very diverse "bacteriallike" PPP phosphatases. Enzymatic characteristics,
physiological roles and evolutionary history of these
phosphatases have yet to be revealed.

Methods
Detection of PPP phosphatase-coding sequences
Sequence similarity searches were conducted using BlastP
or TBlastN [51] at NCBI [52] in the following databases:
"non-redundant" (NR), "expressed sequence tags" (EST),
"genomic sequence survey" (GSS) and "high-throughput
genomic sequences" (HTGS). Additional Blast searches of
the following databases were performed: finished and
unfinished genomes of eukaryotes at the NCBI [53]; fungal genomes at the Broad Institute [54]; plant genomes at
The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) [55]; Gene
Index databases of tentative consensus sequences (EST
assemblies) at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)

[56]; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii draft genome [57]. In all
cases, reciprocal searches were used, i.e. hits retrieved by
Blast searches were in their turn used as queries in the following Blast searches. Accuracy of gene prediction was
examined by comparison of the retrieved sequences with
translations of corresponding EST entries. In the absence
of available ESTs, closely related sequences from other
species were used. Taxonomy of the species from which
the phosphatase sequences is given according to the NCBI
taxonomy web site [58].

Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments were generated using CLUSTAL W
[59] at Kyoto University Bioinformatics Centre [60] and
edited manually. During manual editing, particular attention was paid to correct alignment of the PPP family signature motifs and other conserved residues known to
constitute the catalytic site of PPP phosphatases. Phylogenetic tree construction by the neighbor-joining method
[61] and bootstrap analysis were performed using the
PHYLIP package, version 3.573 [26]. Maximum likelihood analysis was performed using TreePuzzle [28]. Possible alternative neighbor-joining based phylogenies were
visualised using Neighbor-Net [29] as implemented in
SplitsTree, version 4.β10 [62]
Analysis of the primary structure
The presence of signal peptides and targeting sequences
