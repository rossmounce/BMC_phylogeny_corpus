Abstract

information

Genome projects are accelerating research on splicing. For
example, with the majority of splicing-related genes already

known in human and budding yeast, these gene sequences
were used to query the Drosophila and fission yeast genomes
in an effort to identify potential homologs [4,5]. Most of the
known genes were found to have homologs in both Drosophila and fission yeast. The availability of the near-complete genome of Arabidopsis thaliana [6] provides the
foundation for the simultaneous study of all the genes
involved in particular plant structures or physiological processes. For example, Barakat et al. [7] identified and mapped
249 genes encoding ribosomal proteins and analyzed gene
number, chromosomal location, evolutionary history (including large-scale chromosomal duplications) and expression of
those genes. Beisson et al. [8] catalogued all genes involved in
acyl lipid metabolism. Wang et al. [9] surveyed more than
1,000 Arabidopsis protein kinases and computationally compared derived protein clusters with established gene families
in budding yeast. Previous surveys of Arabidopsis gene families that contain some splicing-related genes include the
DEAD box RNA helicase family [10] and RNA-recognition
motif (RRM)-containing proteins [11]. At present, the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) links to more than 850
such expert-maintained collections of gene families [12].

interactions

Most eukaryotic genes contain introns that are spliced from
the precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA). The correct interpretation
of splicing signals is essential to generate authentic mature
mRNAs that yield correct translation products. As an important post-transcriptional mechanism, gene function can be
controlled at the level of splicing through the production of
different mRNAs from a single pre-mRNA (reviewed in [1]).
The general mechanism of splicing has been well studied in
human and yeast systems and is largely conserved between
these organisms. Plant RNA splicing mechanisms remain
comparatively poorly understood, due in part to the lack of an
in vitro plant splicing system. Although the splicing mechanisms in plants and animals appear to be similar overall,
incorrect splicing of plant pre-mRNAs in mammalian systems (and vice versa) suggests that there are plant-specific
characteristics, resulting from coevolution of splicing factors
with the signals they recognize or from the requirement for
additional splicing factors (reviewed in [2,3]).

Rationale

deposited research

A total of 74 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes and 395 genes encoding splicing-related proteins
were identified in the Arabidopsis genome by sequence comparison and motif searches, including
the previously elusive U4atac snRNA gene. Most of the genes have not been studied
experimentally. Classification of these genes and detailed information on gene structure, alternative
splicing, gene duplications and phylogenetic relationships are made accessible as a comprehensive
database of Arabidospis Splicing Related Genes (ASRG) on our website.

Wang and Brendel

Here we present the results of computational identification of
potentially all or nearly all Arabidopsis genes involved in premRNA splicing. Recent mass spectrometry analyses revealed
more than 200 proteins associated with human spliceosomes
([13-17], reviewed in [18]). By extensive sequence comparisons using known plant and animal splicing-related proteins
as queries, we have identified 74 small nuclear RNA (snRNA)
genes and 395 protein-coding genes in the Arabidopsis
genome that are likely to be homologs of animal splicingrelated genes. About half of the genes occur in multiple copies
in the genome and appear to have been derived both from
chromosomal duplication events and from duplication of
individual genes. All genes were classified into gene families,
named and annotated with respect to their inferred gene
structure, predicted protein domain structure and presumed
function. The classification and analysis results are available
as an integrated web resource, the database of Arabidopsis
Splicing Related Genes (ASRG), which should facilitate
genome-wide studies of pre-mRNA splicing in plants.

ASRG: a database of Arabidopsis splicing-related
genes

Our up-to-date web-accessible database comprising the Arabidopsis splicing-related genes and associated information is
available at [19]. The web pages display gene structure, alternative splicing patterns, protein domain structure and potential gene duplication origins in tabular format. Chromosomal
locations and spliced alignment of cognate cDNAs and
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are viewable via links to the
Arabidopsis genome database AtGDB [20], which also provides other associated information for these genes and links
to other databases. Text-search functions are accessible from
all the web pages. Sequence-analysis tools including BLAST
[21] and CLUSTAL W [22] are integrated and facilitate comparison of splicing-related genes and proteins across various
species.

Arabidopsis snRNA genes

A total of 15 major snRNA and two minor snRNA genes were
previously identified experimentally in Arabidopsis [23-28].
These genes were used as queries to search the Arabidopsis
genome for other snRNA genes. A total of 70 major snRNAs
and three minor snRNAs were identified by this method. In
addition, a single U4atac snRNA gene was identified by
sequence motif search. We assigned tentative gene names
and gene models as shown in Table 1, together with chromosome locations and similarity scores relative to a representative query sequence. The original names for known snRNAs
were preserved, following the convention atUx.y, where x
indicates the U snRNA type and y the gene number. Computationally identified snRNAs were named similarly, but with
a hyphen instead of a period separating type from gene
number (atUx-y). Putative pseudogenes were indicated with a
'p' following the gene name. Pseudogene status was assigned

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/12/R102

to gene models for which sequence similarity to known genes
was low, otherwise conserved transcription signals are missing and the gene cannot fold into typical secondary structure.
A recent experimental study of small non-messenger RNAs
identified 14 tentative snRNAs in Arabidopsis by cDNA cloning ([29], GenBank accessions 22293580 to 22293592 and
22293600, Table 1). All these newly identified snRNAs were
found in the set of our computationally predicted genes.

Conservation of major snRNA genes
As shown in Table 1, each of five major snRNA genes (U1, U2,
U4, U5 and U6) exists in more than 10 copies in the Arabidopsis genome. U2 snRNA has the largest copy number, with
a total of 18 putative homologs identified. Both U1 and U5
snRNAs have 14 copies, U6 snRNA has 13 copies, and U4
snRNA has only 11 copies. Sequence comparisons within Arabidopsis snRNA gene families showed that the U6 snRNA
genes are the most similar, and the U1 snRNA genes are the
most divergent. Eight active U6 snRNA copies are more than
93% identical to each other in the genic region, whereas active
U1 snRNAs are on average only 87% identical. The U2 and U4
snRNAs are also highly conserved within each type, with
more than 92% identity among the active genes. Details about
the individual snRNAs and the respective sequence alignments are displayed at [30].
Previous studies identified two conserved transcription signals in most major snRNA gene promoters: USE (upstream
sequence element, RTCCACATCG (where R is either A or G)
and TATA box [24-27]. All 14 U5 snRNAs have the USE and
TATA box. Furthermore, their predicted secondary structures
are similar to the known structure of their counterparts in
human, indicating that all these genes are active and functional (structure data not shown; for a review of the structures
of human snRNAs, see [31]). Similarly, we identified 17 U2, 10
U1, nine U4, and nine U6 snRNA genes as likely active genes,
with a few additional genes more likely to be pseudogenes
because of various deletions. U4-10 and U6-7 do not have the
conserved USE in the promoter region, but their U4-U6 interaction regions (stem I and stem II) are fairly well conserved.
U2-16 is also missing the USE but has a secondary structure
similar to other U2 snRNAs. These genes may be active, but
differences in promoter motifs suggest that their expression
may be under different control compared with other snRNAs
homologs. The U2-17 snRNA has all conserved transcription
signals, but 20 nucleotides are missing from its 3' end. The
predicted secondary structure of U2-17 is similar to that of
other U2 snRNAs, with a significantly shorter stem-loop in
the 3' end as a result of the deletion. We are not sure if the U217 snRNA is functional, but the conserved transcription signals imply that it may be active.
Other conserved transcription signals were also identified in
most active snRNAs, including the sequence element
CAANTC (where N is either A, C, G or T) in U2 snRNAs
(located at -6 to -1) [23], and the termination signal CAN3-

Chromosomal locations were determined by conducting BLAST searches against the Arabidopsis genome (Release 5.0). *The gene used for query in
the BLAST search; †atU12 and atU6atac sequences, which were experimentally identified [28]. Their sequences were compiled manually from the
cited paper. The GenBank gi numbers for the chromosome sequences used are as follows: chromosome 1, 42592260; chromosome 2, 30698031;
chromosome 3, 30698537; chromosome 4, 30698542; chromosome 5, 30698605.

10AGTNNAA in U snRNAs (U1, U2, U4 and U5) transcribed
by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) [23,24,32]. The previously
identified monocot-specific promoter element (MSP,
RGCCCR, located upstream of USE) in U6.1 and U6.26 [33] is
also found in five other U6 snRNA genes (U6.29, U6-2, U6-3,
U6-4, U6-5). In all seven U6 snRNAs the consensus MSP
sequence extends by two thymine nucleotides to RGCCCRTT.
Although the MSP does not contribute significantly to U6
snRNA transcription initiation in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia
protoplasts [33], the extended consensus may imply a role in
gene expression regulation in Arabidopsis.

Low copy number of minor snRNA genes
The minor snRNAs are functional in the splicing of U12-type
(AT-AC) introns. Four types of minor snRNAs, which correspond to four types of major snRNAs, exist in mammals. U11
is the analog of U1, U12 is the analog of U2, U4atac is the analog of U4, and U6atac is the analog of U6. The U5 snRNA
seems to function in both the major and minor spliceosome
[34]. Two minor snRNAs (atU12 and atU6atac) were experimentally identified in Arabidopsis [28]. Both have the conserved USE and TATA box in the promoter region. We
identified another U6atac gene (atU6atac-2) by sequence
mapping. This gene has a USE and a TATA box in the promoter region. The atU6atac-2 gene is more than 90% similar
to atU6atac in both its 5' and 3' ends, with a 10-nucletotide
deletion in the central region. The putative U4atac-U6atac

interaction region in atU6atac-2 is 100% conserved with the
interaction region previously identified in atU6atac [28,35].
U11 and U4atac have not been experimentally identified in
Arabidopsis. BLAST searches using the human U11 and
U4atac homologs as queries against the Arabidopsis genome
failed to find any significant hits, indicating divergence of the
minor snRNAs in plants and mammals. Using the strategy
described below, we successfully identified a putative Arabidopsis U4atac gene. It is a single-copy gene containing all
conserved functional domains. We also found a single candidate U11 snRNA gene (chromosome 5, from 17,492,101 to
17,492,600) that has the USE and TATA box in the promoter
region. This gene also contains a putative binding site fr Sm
protein and a region that could pair with the 5' splice site of
the U12-type intron.

Identification of an Arabidopsis U4atac snRNA gene
Like U4 snRNA and U6 snRNA, human U4atac and U6atac
snRNAs interact with each other through base pairing [36].
The same interaction is expected to exist between the Arabidopsis homologs. Therefore, we deduced the tentative
AtU4atac stem II sequence (CCCGTCTCTGTCAGAGGAG)
from AtU6atac snRNA and searched for matching sequences
in the Arabidopsis genome. Hit regions together with flanking regions 500 base-pairs (bp) upstream and 500 bp downstream were retrieved and screened for transcription signals

and At4g16070 on chromosome 4.

Tandem arrays of snRNAs genes
Some snRNAs genes exist as small groups on the Arabidopsis
chromosomes [6]. We identified 10 snRNA gene clusters:
seven U1-U4 snRNA clusters, one U2-U5 snRNA cluster, and
a tandem duplication for both U2 snRNA (U2-10) and U5
snRNA (U5.1) (Figure 2). All seven Arabidopsis U1-U4 clusters have the U1 snRNA gene located upstream of the U4
snRNA gene, with a 180-300-nucleotide intergenic region.
Five of the U1-U4 arrays are located on chromosome 5 (U1a/
U4.1, U1-4/U4-5, U1-8/U4-7, U1-9/U4-8, and U1-13p/
U4.3p), and the remaining two on chromosome 1 (U1-10/U4-

The tentative U4atac snRNA gene contains not only the stem
II sequence, but also the stem I sequence that presumably
base-pairs with U6atac snRNA stem I. Furthermore, a highly
conserved Sm-protein-binding region exists at the 3' end. The
predicted secondary structure is nearly identical to hsU4atac,
with a relative longer single-stranded region (data not
shown). With the highly conserved transcriptional signals,
functional domains and secondary structure, this candidate
gene is likely to be a real U4atac snRNA homolog. We named
it AtU4atac and assigned At4g16065 as its tentative gene

Arabidopsis splicing-related protein-coding genes

Most of the proteins involved in splicing in mammals and
Drosophila are known [4,37,38]. In addition, recent proteomics studies revealed many novel proteins associated with
human spliceosomes (reviewed in [18]). Using all these animal proteins as query sequences, we identified a total of 395
tentative homologs in Arabidopsis. Sequence-similarity
scores and comparison of gene structure and protein domain
structure were used to assign the genes to families. Each gene
was assigned a tentative name based on the name of its
respective animal homolog. Different homologs within a gene
family were labeled by adding an Arabic number (1, 2, and so
on) to the name. Close family members with similar gene
structure were indicated by adding -a, -b, and -c to the name.
The 395 genes were classified into five different categories
according to the presumed function of their products. Ninetyone encode small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP)
proteins, 109 encode splicing factors, and 60 encode potential
splicing regulators. Details of EST evidence, alternative splicing patterns, duplication sources and domain structure of
these genes are listed in Table 2. We also identified 84 Arabidopsis proteins corresponding to 54 human spliceosomeassociated proteins. The remaining 51 genes encode proteins
with domains or sequences similar to known splicing factors,
but without enough similarity to allow unambiguous classification. These two categories are not discussed in detail here,
but information about these genes is available at our ASRG
site [39].

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/12/R102

The majority of snRNP proteins are conserved in
Arabidopsis
There are five snRNPs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6) involved in
the formation of the major spliceosome, corresponding to five
snRNAs. Five snRNPs (U1 snRNP, U2 snRNP, U5 snRNP,
U4/U6 snRNP and U4.U6/U5 tri-snRNP) have been isolated
experimentally in yeast or human [40-45]. Each snRNP contains the snRNA, a group of core proteins, and some snRNPspecific proteins. Most of these proteins are conserved in Arabidopsis. All U snRNPs except U6 snRNP contain seven common core proteins bound to snRNAs. These core proteins all
have an Sm domain and have been called Sm proteins. The U6
snRNP contains seven LSM proteins ('like Sm' proteins).
Another LSM protein (LSM1) is not involved in binding
snRNA (reviewed in [46]).
As shown in Table 2, all Sm and LSM proteins have homologs
in Arabidopsis, and eight of them are duplicated. It is likely
that these genes existed as single copies in the ancestor of animals and plants, but duplicated within the plant lineage. Only
one of the 24 genes (LSM5, At5g48870) has been characterized experimentally in Arabidopsis. The LSM5 gene was
cloned from a mutant supersensitive to ABA (abscisic acid)
and drought (SAD1 [47]). LSM5 is expressed at low levels in
all tissues and its transcription is not altered by drought stress
[47]. cDNA and EST evidence exist for all other core protein
genes, indicating that all 24 genes are active.
There are 63 Arabidopsis proteins corresponding to the 35
snRNP-specific proteins used as queries in our genome mapping. Very few of them have been characterized experimentally, including U1-70K, U1A and a tandem duplication pair of
SAP130 [48-50]. U1-70K was reported as a single-copy essential gene. Expression of U1-70K antisense transcript under
the APETALA3 promoter suppressed the development of
sepals and petals [51]. We identified an additional homolog of
U1-70K (At2g43370) and named it U1-70K2. The U1-70K2
proteins showed 48% similarity to the U1-70K protein
according to Blast2 results. Both genes retain the sixth intron
in some transcripts, a situation which would produce truncated proteins [48]. Interestingly, we found that five of the 10
Arabidopsis U1 snRNP proteins, including the U1-70K-coding genes, may undergo alternative splicing.
Several genes in U2, U5, U4/U6 and U4.U6/U5 snRNPs, but
none in U1 snRNP, occur in more than three copies in the
Arabidopsis genome. The atSAP114 family has five members,
including two that occur in tandem (atSAP114-1a and
atSAP114-1b). Three members have EST/cDNA evidence
(Table 2). Interestingly, the predicted atSAP114p
(At4g15580) protein contains a RNase H domain at the
amino-terminal end, and thus atSAP114p shares similarity to
At5g06805, a gene annotated as encoding a non-LTR retroelement reverse transcriptase-like protein. It is likely that the
atSAP114p gene is a pseudogene that originated by retroelement insertion. There are three copies of the gene for the tri-

Arabidopsis splicing-related proteins

Gene names were kept consistent with names used in previous publications or derived from the names of the respective homologs (yeast names are
given in the S.c. column, where available). The Tnb column gives the numbers of cognate cDNAs and ESTs supporting the gene structure. The AltS
column indicates evidence for alternative splicing, including alternative donor site (AltD), alternative acceptor site (AltA), alternative position (AltP,
both acceptor and donor sites are different), exon skipping (ExonS), and intron retention (IntronR). Chromosomal duplication indicates a known
chromosome duplication region. Functional groups of proteins are separated by long lines spanning all columns. Different members in the group are
separated by short lines starting at the Arabidopsis gene name. Genes duplicated in Arabidopsis are clustered together with no line between them. Dash

snRNP 65 kilodalton (kDa) subunit, which are clustered on
chromosome 4. Both the U4/U6 90 kDa protein and the U4/
U6 15.5 kDa protein also have three gene copies, and the 116
kDa and 200 kDa subunits in U5 snRNP have four copies
apiece.
The yeast U1 snRNP contains several specific proteins that
are not present in mammalian U1 snRNPs [52]. As in mammals, Arabidopsis also lacks homologs of Prp42, a
component of U1 snRNP in yeast [53]. However, Arabidopsis
has two copies of the gene for Prp39, which are similar to
Prp42. Furthermore, atPrp39a can produce a shorter protein
isoform with a novel amino-terminal sequence by exon
skipping. It is possible that the duplicates and alternative
isoforms of plant U1 snRNP proteins are functional homologs
of the yeast-specific proteins.
Several proteins specific to the minor spliceosome are also
conserved in Arabidopsis. The human 18S U11/U12 snRNP
contains several proteins found in U2 snRNP as well as seven
novel proteins [14]. Four of the seven U11/U12-specific
proteins (U11/U12-35K, 25K, 65K and 31K) are conserved in
Arabidopsis, while the remaining three (59K, 48K and 20K)
have no clear homologs. Interestingly, all four Arabidopsis
genes are single copy in the genome, and three of them are
apparently alternatively spliced (Table 2).

Splicing factors are slightly different in Arabidopsis than
in other organisms
We divided the splicing factors into eight subgroups according to recent human spliceosome studies [13,14,16,18]: splicesite selection proteins; SR proteins; 17S U2 associated proteins; 35S U5 associated proteins; proteins specific to the
B∆U1 complex; exon junction complex (EJC) proteins; second-step splicing factors and other known splicing factors.
We focused our analysis on the first two subgroups because
their functions in splicing are well established. A total of 109
proteins in Arabidopsis were identified, corresponding to 67
human queries from all eight subgroups. Most of the proteins
are conserved among eukaryotes, but some human proteins
have no obvious homologs in the Arabidopsis genome, and
some novel splicing factors appear to exist in Arabidopsis.
About 43% of genes encoding splicing factors are duplicated
in the genome, whereas some proteins, such as SF1/BBP
(branchpoint-binding protein, which facilitates U2 snRNP
binding in fission yeast [54]) and cap-binding proteins
(CBP20 and CBP80, possibly involved in cap proximal intron
splicing [55]), derive from single-copy genes [56]. These single-copy gene products may work with all pre-mRNAs,
including the ones with U12-type introns. Surprisingly, mutation of CBP80 (ABH1) is not lethal and is non-pleiotropic. The
abh1 plants show ABA-hypersensitive closure of stomata and
reduced wilting during drought [57].

Arabidopsis also lacks an SMN protein complex. In human,
the SMN protein (survival of motor neurons) can interact
with a series of proteins including Gemin2, Gemin3 (a helicase), Gemin4, Gemin5 and Gemin6 to form an SMN complex, which has important roles in the biogenesis of snRNPs
and the assembly of the spliceosome through direct interactions with Sm proteins and snRNA [73]. Although the SMN
protein exists in the fission yeast genome (GenBank accession
CAA91173), no SMN complex members can be identified in
the Arabidopsis genome.

deposited research

The atRSp31 family (atRSp31, atRSp32, atRSp40 and
atRSp41) belongs to a novel plant SR family and has no clear
animal ortholog. Other families include the SC35 (or SRrp/
TASR2) family, SF2/ASF family, and the 9G8 family. Arabidopsis has a single copy of the SC35 ortholog and four SC35like proteins (atSR33, atSCL30a, atSCL30 and atSCL28),
which appear to have diverged significantly from SC35. It
seems that this divergence predates the split of plants and
animals because a similar SC35-like gene family exists in the
human genome (SRrp35 and SRrp40). The SRrp35 and

Proteins in other subgroups, such as 17S U2 snRNP-associated proteins, 35S U5 snRNP-associated proteins, and protein specific to the B∆U1 complex, are also conserved in
Arabidopsis. The B∆U1 complex is the spliceosome complex
captured immediately before catalytic activation. Most proteins in the 35S U5 snRNP are absent in the B∆U1 complex
but present in the active B complex, indicating the important
roles of 35S U5 snRNP-associated proteins in spliceosome
activation [13]. Conservation of these proteins in Arabidopsis
revealed the same pathway of spliceosome activation in
plants. A subcomplex named Prp19 complex in 35S U5
snRNP has a critical role in spliceosome activation [13,72]. All
proteins in the human Prp19 complex have homologs in Arabidopsis, including a chromosomal duplication pair of Prp19
genes and a single copy of the CDC5 gene. For the B∆U1 complex, six human genes have homologs, and five of them are
single copy in Arabidopsis. Two genes (NPW38BP/SNP70
and p220(NPAT)) in the human B∆U1 complex have no
apparent Arabidopsis homologs.

reports

The additional SR protein belongs to the atRSp31 family and
was named atRSp32 (At2g46610). It shares 70% identity and
78% similarity with atRSp31. The protein is 250 amino acids
in length and contains two RRMs and some RS dipeptides in
the carboxy-terminal region. The gene structure of atRSp32
is similar to that of atRSp31. Two other genes (atRSp40 and
atRSp41) are in the same family and also have similar exon
and intron sizes (see gene structure information at [70]). Similarly to the previous classification of 18 SR proteins [61], the
19 SR proteins (including SR45) can be grouped into four
large families of four to five members according to sequence
similarity, gene structure and protein domain structure.

SRrp40 were found to antagonize other SR proteins in vitro
and function in 5' splice-site selection [71]. SF2/ASF has four
copies (atSR1/SRp34, atSRp30, atSRp34a and atSRp34b)
with similar gene structures and domains. Human 9G8 protein has five homologs in Arabidopsis, with three (atRSZp21,
atRSZp22 and atRSZp22a) containing one CCHC-type zinc
finger and two (atRSZ33, atRSZ32) containing two CCHCtype zinc fingers in addition to an RRM and an RS domain.
Interestingly, several SR proteins (atRSZp21, atRSZp22,
SR45 and SCL33) were found to interact with atU1-70K, and
some SR proteins can interact with each other, thus forming
a complicated interaction network to facilitate splice-site
selection and spliceosome assembly [3,61-63]. atSR45 was
initially regarded as a novel plant SR protein [63], but by virtue of sequence-similarity scores it actually may be the
ortholog of the human RNPS1 gene, which encodes an EJC
protein. Other human SR proteins (SRp20, SRp30c, SRp40,
SRp54, SRp55 and SRp75) lack clear orthologs in Arabidopsis. We conclude that SR protein families evolved differently
in animals and plants from three to four common ancestors,
including SC35, SF2/ASF and 9G8/RSZ. The SRrp (SC35-like
in plants) family may not be classical SR proteins but they
play important roles in splice-site selection.

reviews

We also identified a homolog related to atU2AF65
(At2g33440) and an additional SR protein (At2g46610). The
U2AF65-related protein (atULrp, At2g33440) has 247 amino
acids and shares over 40% similarity with the carboxy terminal region of the two atU2AF65 homologs. Only one RRM can
be identified in atULrp, in contrast to three RRMs and one
amino-terminal RS domain in atU2AF65 proteins, and there is
no apparent RS domain in atULrp. No animal homolog of
atULrp could be identified. The function of this one-RRM
U2AF65-related protein is not clear. As it lacks other functional motifs, it might act as a competitor of U2AF65. A twoRRM U2AF65 protein can be produced through alternative
splicing. The 11th intron of atU2AF65a can be retained (see
RAFL full-length cDNA, gi:19310596) to produce a truncated
protein with only the first two RRMs. Interestingly, the last
RRM in atU2AF65a contains several amino-acid variations
from the consensus pattern such that it could not be detected
by InterPro and NCBI-CDD searches using default values,
also suggesting that perhaps only the first two RRMs are
essential.

Wang and Brendel R102.15

comment

Many splicing factors have been identified previously in Arabidopsis, including two U2AF65, two U2AF35, and 18 SR proteins [58-67]. The U2AF35-related protein atUrp, which
could interact with U2AF65 and position RS-domain-containing splicing factors [68], is also present in the Arabidopsis genome. Although the Urp gene is expressed ubiquitously
in human tissues, no ESTs from this gene were found in Arabidopsis. Three copies of PTB/hnRNP-I genes were identified
in Arabidopsis. The PTB protein competes for the poly-pyrimidine tract with the U2AF large subunit, thus negatively regulating splicing [69].

Splicing regulators are expanded in Arabidopsis
Splicing regulators are proteins that can either modify splicing factors or compete with splicing factors for their binding
site. Important splicing regulators are hnRNP proteins and
SR protein kinases. The exact role of phosphorylation of SR
proteins in splicing is not yet clear, but SR protein kinases are
well conserved and exist as multiple copies in Arabidopsis. A
total of eight SR protein kinases were identified in Arabidopsis, including three Lammer/CLK kinases (AFC1, AFC2 and
AFC3), two SRPK1 homologs, and three SPRK2 homologs.
The three Lammer/CLK kinases were identified previously,
and AFC2 was shown to phosphorylate SR protein in vitro
[63,74]. Overexpression of tobacco AFC2 homolog PK12 in
Arabidopsis changed the alternative splice patterns of several
genes, including atSRp30, atSR1/atSRp34 and U1-70K [75],
indicating that these SR proteins may function to modulate
splicing in plants.
The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs)
bind to splice sites and to binding sites for splicing factors on
nascent pre-mRNAs, thus competing with splicing factors to
negatively control splicing (reviewed in [76]). Humans have
about 20 hnRNP proteins, many of which function in splicing.
A total of 35 potential hnRNP proteins possibly related to
splicing was found in Arabidopsis by sequence-similarity
searches, including a superfamily of glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins. This family contains 21 members similar to
human hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2/B1. It can be further
divided into two subfamilies. One includes eight proteins containing one RRM, and another has 13 members with two
RRMs. 12 of these proteins were identified previously, including AtGRP7, AtGRP8, UBA2a, UBA2b, UBA2c and AtRNPA/
B1-6 [11,77,78]. AtGRP7 was found to be able to influence
alternative splicing of its own transcripts as well as AtGRP8
transcripts [79]. UBA2 proteins can interact with UBP1 and
UBA1 proteins, which have three RRMs and one RRM respectively, to recognize U-rich sequences in the 3' untranslated
region (UTR) and stabilize mRNA [78]. Although the overexpression of UBA2 did not stimulate splicing of a reporter gene
in tobacco protoplasts [78], we cannot rule out the possibility
that it could be involved in splicing of other genes.
Other human hnRNPs related to splicing also have homologs
in Arabidopsis. BLAST searches of the human (CUG)n triplet
repeat RNA-binding protein (CUG-BP) against all Arabidopsis proteins revealed three putative homologs, including
atFCA. atFCA and CUG-BP share similarity within the RRMs
and a region approximately 40 amino acids in length. An
additional protein (At2g47310) related to FCA was identified
and named FCA2, as it shares about 50% similarity with FCA.
The FCA proteins have two RRMs and a WW domain, which
interact with the FY protein, a homolog of yeast polyadenylation factor Psf2p [80,81]. The FCA-FY complex negatively
regulates the FCA protein by favoring a polyadenylation site
from the third intron of FCA pre-mRNA [80,82]. FCA may be
a multifunctional protein involved in mRNA processing, as

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/12/R102

human CUG-BP can function in both alternative splicing and
deadenylation [83]. We also list 15 previously identified
hnRNP-like proteins and two additional homologs as possible
splicing regulators. The UBP1 proteins can strongly enhance
splicing of some introns in protoplasts [84], whereas UBA1,
RBP45 and RBP47 proteins have no similar function [78,85].

Unclassified splicing protein candidates
In addition to the 260 proteins in the above three categories,
there are also 84 Arabidopsis proteins corresponding to
human spliceosome-associated proteins identified in recent
proteomic studies [15-18]. Some of these proteins function in
other processes, such as transcription, polyadenylation and
even translation. Their association with spliceosomes provides evidence for the coupling of splicing and other
processes. Other proteins have no known functions. Only
35.8% of the proteins in this category are duplicated in Arabidopsis. We also identified a total of 51 Arabidopsis proteincoding genes similar to known splicing proteins. They have
conserved domains and some level of sequence similarity to
known splicing factors. We did not include these two categories in Table 2, but detailed information about them is available at ASRG [39].

Distribution and duplication of Arabidopsis
splicing-related genes

The distribution of Arabidopsis snRNA and splicing-related
proteins across the genome is shown in Figure 2 and at the
ASRG website. Overall, the genes appear evenly distributed
on the chromosomes, with several small gene clusters. Only
four snRNA genes are located on chromosome 2, three of
which are U2 snRNA genes. No U4 snRNA gene is located on
chromosome 4. For the protein-coding genes, most functional categories have members located on each chromosome. The only exception is the SR protein kinase family,
which has no member on chromosome 1. Interestingly, chromosome 1 contains the most snRNP proteins and splicing factors, but has the fewest splicing regulators. Several gene
clusters encoding splicing-related proteins were also identified. Some clusters, such as tandemly duplicated gene pairs,
include genes from the same category. One cluster located on
chromosome 4 includes four genes encoding tri-snRNP proteins (atTri65a, atTri65b, atTri65c and atTri15.5c, homologs
of tri-snRNP 65-KD protein and 15.5 KD protein). Two other
clusters, atU2A-atCdc5 and atCUG-BP1-atU1C, include
genes from different functional categories. No clear clusters
of genes for snRNA-splicing-related proteins were identified.
Although about one third of snRNA genes are located near
other protein-coding genes, none of their neighboring genes
is related to splicing. As a caveat, we should point out that our
snRNA gene determination strongly suggests annotation
errors in overlapping protein-coding gene models. Thus,

Among different types of alternative splicing, intron retention
is the most abundant of the alternative transcripts identified
for the 260 classified splicing-related genes. As shown in
Table 4, 44 of the total 80 alternative splicing genes (about
55%) involve intron retention, 28 (35%) involve alternative
acceptor-site selection and 15 (18.7%) are due to exon skipping. Compared with the corresponding ratio in all Arabidopsis alternative splicing events (55.3% intron retention, 23.4%
alternative acceptor-site selection and 6.3% exon skipping;
B.-B.W. and V.B., unpublished work), the ratio of intron
retention in splicing-related genes is similar and the ratio of
exon skipping is higher. Interestingly, only one of the 20
splicing regulator genes processed by alternative splicing
(about 5%) shows exon skipping, indicating that exon skip-

Chromosomal duplication rather than individual gene duplication appears to be the predominant mode of amplification

SR protein genes include eight duplication pairs, six of which

According to EST/cDNA alignments, 80 of the 260 protein
coding genes show 66 alternative splicing events. This rate
(30.8%) is much higher than the overall frequency of alternative splicing in Arabidopsis, which is about 13% using the
same criteria (2,747 genes out of 20,446 genes with EST/
cDNA evidence; B.-B.W. and V.B., unpublished work). As
shown in Table 4, the snRNP protein-coding genes have the
lowest alternative splicing ratio (24.2%), whereas the ratios
for splicing factor and splicing regulator genes are both over
33%. More than half of the genes encoding EJC proteins, proteins specific for the B∆U1 complex, SR proteins, U11/U12
snRNP-specific proteins and U1 snRNP proteins undergo
alternative splicing.

deposited research

At least 130 duplication events are required to yield the 260
proteins from 130 families given one single-copy ancestor per
family. Thirty-three duplication events (about a quarter of the
total) are likely to be the result of chromosome duplications.
The chromosomal duplication ratio is 18.9-27.5% among the
three groups (see Table 3). Some snRNA genes pairs, such as
U2-14/U2-10, U5-3/U5-5 and (U6.1 U6.26)/(U6-8p U6-9p),
may also have been produced by chromosome duplication.
The C.D.2-3 region (chromosome duplication region between
chromosomes 2 and 3, see [87]) has the most splicing-related
gene pairs. Six genes in this region on chromosome 2 were
duplicated in the same order on chromosome 3. EST evidence
shows that all these genes are expressed. Three U5 snRNA
genes (U5.1, U5.1b and U5-4) and four U2 snRNA genes
(U2.2, U2.3, U2.4 and U2.6) also are located in the same
region on chromosome 3. No U5 and U2 homologs exist in the
corresponding region on chromosome 2, suggesting that the
snRNA duplication events in that region may have happened
after the chromosome duplication event, or that the snRNA
duplicates were lost subsequent to chromosome duplication.

The 260 proteins in the first three categories could be
grouped into 130 families, 66 of which consist of multiple
members. The duplication rate is over 50%, which is higher
than the 44% duplication rate of Arabidopsis transcription
factors [86]. As shown in Table 3, about 50% of genes encoding snRNP proteins, 43% of splicing factors, and 78% of splicing regulators have duplications. The much higher
duplication rate of splicing regulators may reflect diversification in splicing control.

are probably the results of chromosomal duplications. At
least five chromosomal duplication events contributed to the
superfamily of 21 hnRNP glycine-rich RBD and A/B genes. It
is not clear why these functional categories have high chromosomal duplication ratios. It is possible that chromosomal
duplication could create positive selection to maintain similar
copy numbers of other genes encoding proteins that interact
with the products of already duplicated genes.

Discussion

Previous studies had determined 30 snRNA genes and 46
protein-coding genes related to splicing in Arabidopsis (see
Tables 1 and 2). In this study, we have computationally identified an additional 44 snRNA genes (Table 1) and 349 protein-coding genes (Table 2) that also may be involved in
splicing. Among the five types of U snRNAs, U6 is the most
conserved and U1 is the least conserved. We identified seven
U1-U4 snRNA gene clusters. We were surprised to see so
many U1-U4 clusters in Arabidopsis. In Drosophila, four
snRNA clusters were reported [4], but none of them includes
U1-U4 gene pairs. It is likely that a U1-U4 snRNA cluster
existed in a progenitor of the current Arabidopsis genome,
which was duplicated several times to form the extant seven
clusters. The non-clustered U1 and U4 snRNA genes may
have arisen by individual gene duplication or gene loss in
duplicated clusters.
Among the proteins involved in splicing, most animal
homologs are conserved in plants, indicating an ancient,
monophylytic origin for the splicing mechanism. A striking
feature of plant splicing-related genes is their duplication
ratio. Fifty percent of the splicing genes are duplicated in Arabidopsis. The duplication ratio of the splicing-related genes
increases from genes encoding snRNP proteins to genes
encoding splicing regulators. These data strongly suggest that
the general splicing mechanism is conserved, but that the
control of splicing may be more diverse in plants.
The high duplication ratio of Arabidopsis splicing-related
genes could be the result of evolutionary selection. Unlike
animals, which can move around to maintain more homogeneous physiological conditions, plants are exposed to a larger
range of stress conditions such as heat and cold. The duplicates will more probably be maintained in the genome as their
functions become diversified, and potentially plant-specific,

to ensure the fidelity of splicing under such varied conditions.
Chromosome duplication has produced several Sm proteins,
SR proteins and hnRNP proteins in Arabidopsis, which in
turn could create positive selective pressures influencing the
rate of duplication for functionally related genes. Because
chromosome duplication occurred differentially within each
plant lineage, we would expect different duplication patterns
of these genes in, for example, monocots and dicots.
To confirm the above hypothesis, we searched the recently
sequenced rice genome using the five Arabidopsis SC35 and
SC35-like proteins as probes. Eight distinct genome loci were
found to encode SC35 and SC35-like proteins, including three

A large number of Arabidopsis splicing-related genes were
computationally identified in this study by means of sequence
comparisons and motif searches, including a tentative
U4atac snRNA gene containing all conserved motifs, a new
SR protein-coding gene (atRSp32) belonging to the atRSp31
family, and several genes related to genes encoding known
splicing-related proteins (atULrp and atFCA2). A web-accessible database containing all the Arabidopsis splicing related
genes has been constructed and will be expanded to other
organisms in the near future. This compilation should provide a good foundation to study the splicing process in more
detail and to determine to what extent these genes are conserved across the entire plant kingdom. Our data show that
about 50% of the splicing-related genes are duplicated in Arabidopsis. The duplication ratios for splicing regulators are
even higher, indicating that the splicing mechanism is generally conserved among plants, but that the regulation of splicing may be more variable and flexible, thus enabling plants to
respond to their specific environments.

refereed research

It is interesting to note that the overall alternative splicing
frequency in splicing related genes is much higher than the
frequency averaged over all Arabidopsis genes. More than
half of SR proteins and U1 snRNP proteins show alternative
splicing. Alternative splicing might increase protein diversity
derived from splicing-related genes, which would further add
flexibility to the splicing mechanism. The high frequency of
alternative transcripts from splicing related genes raises
another interesting question - how is splicing regulated in
these splicing-related genes? One possible answer is that

some splicing-related genes may be autoregulated. Accumulation of one transcript would feed back to inhibit/promote
other isoforms. Several splicing-related genes have been
reported to be regulated in this way. For example, AtGRP7
(hnRNP A/B superfamily) is a circadian clock-regulated protein which negatively autoregulates its expression [79]. When
the AtGRP7 protein accumulates over the circadian cycle, it
promotes production of alternative transcripts which use a
cryptic 5' splice site. As a result of message instability, the
alternative transcripts contain pre-mature stop codons and
do not accumulate to high levels, thus decreasing the level of
AtGRP7 protein [79]. atSRp30 has similar effects on its own
transcripts [65]. Another possible answer is that some splicing-related genes might regulate the splicing of other splicing-related genes. For example, overexpression of AtGRP7
and atSRp30 is known to affect the splicing of AtGRP8 and
atSR1, respectively [65,79]. A third possibility is that the environment could affect the alternative splicing pattern. A good
example is the SR1 gene. The ratio of two transcripts from the
SR1 gene (SR1B/SR1) increases in a temperature-dependent
manner [67]. Generally, heat or cold stress could cause intron
retention in some splicing regulators, which could further
alter the splicing pattern of other genes. The fourth possible
regulators are intronless genes. Combining all these possibilities, a pathway to regulate splicing could be inferred as follows: environmental changes → splicing pattern changes in
some specific splicing-related genes and/or intronless genes
→ expression pattern changes (including splicing pattern
changes) in general splicing related genes → changes in splicing patterns for specific genes.

reviews

As introns evolve rapidly, the mechanism to recognize and
splice them should either evolve correspondingly or be flexible enough to accommodate the changes. It seems that plants
deploy the most economic and practical way by keeping a
largely conserved splicing mechanism and a very flexible recognition and control mechanism. Direct evidence comes from
the presence of plant-specific splicing proteins, such as the
novel SR protein family and the superfamily of hnRNP A/B.
The absence of SMN complex and some yeast U1 snRNP proteins in Arabidopsis indicates that other organisms also have
integrated new proteins or pathways into the splicing mechanism over the course of evolution relative to other eukaryotes.
Other evidence supporting the conserved splicing but flexible
regulating mechanism include differential conservation
among U snRNAs (U1 snRNAs are less conserved than U6
snRNAs) and high alternative splicing frequency in U1 snRNP
proteins, SR proteins and hnRNP proteins. The SR proteins
and U1 snRNP proteins are involved in early steps of splicing
and 5' and 3' splice-site selection; multiple isoforms of these
proteins may be functionally significant in the control of
splicing.

homologs of atSC35, two homologs of atSR33/SCL33 and
atSCL30a, two homologs of atSCL30, and one homolog of
atSCL28. Five of the eight rice genes are currently annotated
in GenBank with accession numbers BAC79909 (osSC35a),
BAD09319 (osSC35b), AAP46199 (osSR33-1), BAC799901
(osSCL30a/osSR33-2), and BAD19168 (osSCL30-1). As
shown in the phylogenetic tree displayed in Figure 3, the two
rice SC35 genes and atSC35 are likely to be orthologs of the
animal SC35 gene. The other sequences cluster in SC35-like
(SRrp/TASR) clades, indicating that the SC35 and SRrp/
TASR genes diverged before the divergence of monocot and
dicot plants (the divergence presumably happened even
before the divergence of animals and plants, as described earlier). In addition, there are species-specific duplications.
Thus, the Arabidopsis chromosomal duplication pair atSR33
- atSCL30a forms a clade, while their rice copies (osSR33-1
and osSCL30a) form another clade. Also there are additional
duplications for the rice SC35 and SCL30 genes. We are currently working to identify all rice splicing related genes. The
complete sets of these genes in two plant species should provide a good foundation for assessing similarities and differences in splicing mechanisms used by monocot and dicot
plants.

Materials and methods
Search for Arabidopsis snRNAs
Sequences of the 15 experimentally identified major snRNAs
were downloaded from GenBank. The two minor snRNAs
sequences were compiled from the literature [28]. These
genes were used to search against the Arabidopsis genome at
the AtGDB BLAST server [88] and at the SALK T-DNA
Express web server [89]. Our initial analysis was based on
Release 3.0 of the Arabidopsis genome (GenBank accession
numbers NC_003070.4, NC_003071.3, NC_003074.4,
NC_003075.3, and NC_003076.4). Local BLAST [21] was
used to derive the locations of the snRNA homologs from
more recently sequenced regions of the genome. Criteria used
for local BLAST were 'e 1 -F F -W 7' (cutoff eval is 1, dust filter
on, with a minimum word size of 7). Human and maize
snRNAs were also included as query sequences, and all hits
with e-values less than 10-5 were regarded as possible
homologs. A total of 70 major snRNAs and three minor
snRNAs were identified by this method. Each major snRNA
type has 10-18 copies in the genome. A tentative gene name
and gene model were assigned to each snRNA gene after comparison with the snRNAs identified in MATDB [90].
Sequence-similarity values were based on BLAST alignments.

Search for Arabidopsis splicing-related proteins
A three-round BLAST search strategy was used to identify
Arabidopsis splicing related protein-coding genes. First,
sequences of splicing-related proteins from human and Drosophila were downloaded from GenBank according to several
recent proteomic studies [15-18] and the website compilation
of Stephen Mount's group available at [91]. Human hnRNP
proteins identified in a recent review [76] were downloaded
from GenBank. All these sequences were used as queries in a
local BLAST search against Arabidopsis annotated proteins
(obtained from TIGR at [92]). All hits with an e-value less
than 10-10 were collected as candidates. Many of these candidates had highly significant e-values (usually 10-30 or below
and much lower than other hits). These candidates were
regarded as true homologs.
In the second step, all identified true homologs were used to
query the Arabidopsis protein set again. An e-value of 10-20
was used as a cutoff value to find possible paralogs of the true
homologs. Sequences identified in both rounds of BLAST hits
were regarded as main candidates for splicing related
proteins.
Finally, the main candidates were queried against GenPept
and all annotated human proteins (obtained from Ensembl
[93]). All candidates with significant similarity to proteins
unrelated to splicing were removed from the main candidate
list, and all candidates with significant similarity to proteins
related to splicing were regarded as true splicing-related
genes and were promoted to the status of true homologs. The
remaining candidates were regarded as unclassified splicingrelated proteins. BLAST results were initially analyzed by

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/12/R102

MuSeqBox [94]). Two custom scripts were written to read
MuSeqBox output files, largely automating the search
procedure.

Gene structure and chromosomal locations
The gene structure and chromosomal locations for the genes
encoding splicing-related proteins were retrieved from
AtGDB [95]. The chromosomal locations of the snRNA genes
were inferred from the BLAST results. The location maps
(Figure 1) were generated using the AtGDB advanced search
function [96]. Spliced alignments of ESTs and cDNAs generated by GeneSeqer [97] were used to verify gene models. Gene
structure information was used as an important criteria to
group homologs into gene families.

Protein domains
InterProScan 3.3 was downloaded from [98] and was subsequently used to search protein domain databases using
default parameters [99]. A Perl script was written to process
the text results from InterProScan. Protein domain information was used in comparisons of homologs from different species. The search of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information Conserved Domain Database (NCBI-CDD) [100]
was conducted manually for certain genes to confirm the
InterPro results.

Duplication source
The gene families with multiple copies were inspected to
determine whether they were likely to have derived from
chromosome-duplication events. Gene models of the duplicated gene were searched against the gene list of each chromosome redundancy region at MATDB [101]. If the gene and
its duplicate were both in the list, they were regarded as a
chromosome duplication pair. Otherwise, they were assumed
to be produced by random gene duplication.

Identification of alternative splicing
All Arabidopsis ESTs and cDNAs were aligned against the
genome using the spliced alignment program GeneSeqer as
made available through AtGDB [102]. We retrieved the intron
and exon coordinates of the reliable cognate alignments from
the database. Scripts were written to identify introns that
overlap with other introns or exons. We defined the alternative splicing cases as follows: alternative donor (AltD): an
intron has the same 3'-end coordinate but different 5'-end
coordinate as another overlapping intron; alternative acceptor (AltA): an intron has the same 5'-end coordinate but different 3'-end coordinate as another intron; alternative
position (AltP): an intron has different 5'-end and 3'-end
coordinates as another overlapping intron; exon skipping
(ExonS): an annotated intron completely contains an alternatively identified exon in the same transcription direction;
intron retention (IntronR): an annotated intron is completely
contained by an alternatively identified exon.
