equine H3N8 influenza viruses from Greece
(2003 and 2007): Evidence for reassortment
between evolutionary lineages

Abstract
Background: For first time in Greece equine influenza virus infection was confirmed, by isolation and molecular
analysis, as the cause of clinical respiratory disease among unvaccinated horses during 2003 and 2007 outbreaks.
Methods: Equine influenza virus (EIV) H3N8 was isolated in MDCK cells from 30 nasal swabs from horses with
acute respiratory disease, which were tested positive by Directigen Flu A. Isolation was confirmed by
haemagglutination assay and RT-PCR assay of the M, HA and NA gene.
Results: HA sequences of the Greek isolates appeared to be more closely related to viruses isolated in early 1990s
in Europe. These results suggested that viruses with fewer changes than those on the main evolutionary lineage
may continue to circulate. On the other hand, analysis of deduced NA amino acid sequences were more closely
related to viruses isolated in outbreaks in Europe and Asia during 2003-2007. Phylogenetic analysis characterized
the Greek isolates as a member of the Eurasian lineage by the haemagglutinin (HA) protein alignment, but
appeared to be a member of the Florida sublineage clade 2 by the neuraminidase (NA) protein sequence
suggesting that reassortment might be a possible explanation.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the Greek strains represent an example of “frozen evolution” and probably
reassortment between genetically distinct co-circulated strains. Therefore expanding current equine influenza
surveillance efforts is a necessity.

1 Background
Equine influenza viruses (EIVs) are the etiologic agents
of severe epidemic respiratory disease in horses. Antigenically they are classified as influenza type A viruses
belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae containing 8
single stranded RNA molecules of negative polarity.
Influenza infections are frequently followed by secondary bacterial disease, with serious and sometimes lifethreatening consequences for the horses. The rapidly
spreading signs include high pyrexia, dyspnoea, coughing, myalgia, anorexia and swelling of regional lymph
nodes [1].

The first EIV to be isolated was influenza A/equine/
Prague/56 (H7N7) in 1956 [2]. However, the H7N7 subtype has not been isolated from horses for over 20 years
and is presumed not to circulate at present [3]. A second subtype of the virus, A/equine/Miami/63 (H3N8),
was isolated during a major epizootic of respiratory disease in the U.S.A in 1963 [4]. The H3N8 subtype is
responsible for widespread outbreaks in vaccinated and
unvaccinated horses. Neither of the subtypes crossreacts immunologically and therefore natural infection
or vaccination with one subtype will not protect against
infection by the other [5].
In 1996, Daly and co-workers, demonstrated that in
1989 a divergent evolution of American and European
isolates had occurred resulting in two genetically and
antigenically distinct lineages. The Eurasian, included

stains circulating mostly in the European continent and
the prototypes are A/equine/Newmarket/2/93 and A/
equine/Suffolk/89, and the American lineage included
stains detected prevalently in the American continent
and the prototype is A/eq/Newmarket/1/93, while the
oldest H3N8 strains, circulating in the ‘70s and ‘80s are
now apparently extinct [6]. The American lineage was
further distinguished in Argentina, Kentucky and Florida
sub-lineage, and the last has been divided in clade 1 and
2 [7]. Clade 1 includes the A/eq/Wisconsin/03-like
viruses while clade 2 is represented by the A/eq/Newmarket/5/03-like viruses [8]. At present, viruses of the
two lineages co-circulate in horse populations, therefore
it was suggested that vaccines contain strains representative of those currently circulating in the field [9]. During 2003-2007 widespread outbreaks of EIV have been
reported not only in many countries of Europe and in
USA, but also in regions that rarely report EI outbreaks
[10-12]. Even, Australia, a country previously free of
equine influenza, suffered an outbreak in 2007 [13].
In addition to the linear evolution of HA, the segmented nature of the influenza virus genome allows reassortment to take place resulting in rapid virus evolution
[14]. Reassortment is significant if it occurs between distinct co-circulating viral strains. Nucleotide analysis of
H3N8 viruses have shown reassortment of RNA segments encoding NP [15,16], PB2 [17] and PA [18]
between the equine H7N7 and H3N8 subtypes and of
segments of HA and NS between distinct strains of
H3N8 strains [11].
Here, we describe for first time the successful isolation
and characterization of EIV from horses in Greece from
two outbreaks (in 2003 and 2007). Moreover our report
includes information on sequencing analysis and phylogenetic relationship of HA and NA proteins of the
Greek isolates.

affected animals. During the 2007 outbreak there was
none of the 2003-outbreak affected animals still in the
farm.
2.2 Virus isolation

All samples were placed in virus transport medium and
brought on ice within one hour from the time of sampling to the laboratory. Nasal secretions were centrifuged and stored at -80°C. After thawing, 100 μl of each
filtered swab was used for inoculation of 5 × 104 MDCK
cells/per well in 6-well plates. After 48-72 h incubation
at 37°C (under 5% v/v CO 2 humidified conditions) a
blind passage of each passage was performed. In total,
three successive passages per sample were conducted
and cell cultures were checked daily for the presence of
cytopathic effect (CPE).
Cell viability was determined at 72 h at each passage
using a Trypan blue (0.4% w/v) exclusion assay. Cell viability was counted using a hemocytometer, and
expressed as the percentage of live cells in the infected
cell cultures in comparison to the control (uninfected)
cell culture (no of live cells in infected cell culture/live
cells in control cell culture × 100%).
Quantification assays to determine the TCID50 were
carried out at the third passage of the isolated samples
[19].
2.3 Antigenic characterisation of equine influenza virus
isolates

Haemagglutination inhibition was carried out as
described previously [5] against 3 post infection ferret
antisera treated with periodates and heated to remove
non specific haemagglutination inhibitors. The ferret
antisera used were against Newmarket/1/93 (H3N8),
Newmarket/2/93 (H3N8) and Newmarket/77 (H7N7).
The strain Newmarket/1/93 was used as positive control
virus in all assays

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Outbreak description - Sampling

In June 2003 and in May 2007, an acute respiratory disease was reported in the same stud farm in Attiki,
Greece. 20 (in June 2003) and 10 horses (in May 2007)
were affected and had pyrexia, nasal discharge, anorexia,
dyspnoea, cough, myalgia and general depression. Signs
lasted 5-10 days. The age of the infected animals varied
from 6 months to 2 years. Symptomatic treatment with
antibiotics, antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) had limited results. All infected
horses were unvaccinated against equine influenza virus.
Nasal swabs were collected from the 30 affected animals,
between the 3rd and 4th day after the onset of clinical
signs. All nasal swabs collected were Directigen Flu A
positive when tested on the spot at the time of sampling. No serum samples were submitted from the

2.4 RNA extraction, RT-PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic
analysis

Viral RNA was isolated from nasal swabs and cell culture supernatant using the QIAampViral RNA mini kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Genes of interest were amplified using the SuperScript
One-Step RT-PCR Platinum Taq (Invitrogen S.R.L.)
with 10 μl of template RNA using the gene specific primers M52C and M253R described by Fouchier et al,
2000 for Matrix gene [20], primers H3HA1/RT and
H3HA1/2 described by Newton et al. 2006 for HA1 [21]
and primers NA25 and NA703 described by Ito et al.,
2008 for NA gene (position 25-703) [10] at a final concentration of 0.2 μM. The cycling conditions used were
the same as described previously [10,20,21]. Although,
previous reports have used GeneAmp PCR kit (Applied

Bountouri et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:350
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/350

Biosystems) for the nested PCR, during this study
another second (nested) PCR was carried out for HA
gene using HotStartTaq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen) kit.
2.5 μl of the product of the first RT-PCR step were
amplified in a final volume of 50 μl containing, 0,2 μM
each of sense (H3HA1/3) and antisense (H3HA1/4) primers. The mixture was heated at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30s, 50°C for 1 min and
72°C for 1 min, and finally 7 min at 72°C.
PCR products were analysed on a 1% agarose gel
stained with ethidium bromide and purified using the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR products of each
gene specific PCR assay were sequenced using DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing on an AB37710xl
Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were
assembled using Bioedit software package version 3.1
[22] and compared to cognate sequences in the genetic
databases using BLAST web-based program http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. Nucleotides as well as deduced
amino acid sequences of HA and NA genes were aligned
by using Clustal W method and unrooted phylogenetic
trees were generated using the MEGA software version
4.0 [23] Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the
NJ method and the aminoacid sequences. The statistical
analysis of the trees was assessed by bootstrap resampling (1000 data sets) of the multiple alignments.

3 Results
A total of 30 nasal swabs were received from the two
outbreaks, which were tested positive with immunoassay
Directigen Flu A; 16 of these were isolated in MDCK
cells, 15 of these showed haemagglutination activity and
18 clinical specimens were positive in RT-PCR reaction
of the M, HA and NA gene.
3.1 Isolation and antigenic characterisation

Influenza A virus was isolated from nasal swabs collected from 11 out of 20 and 5 out of 10 affected animals in the 2003 and 2007 outbreak, respectively.
MDCK cells showed cytopathic effects (CPE). There
was no or slight apoptosis after the first passage. Two
successive passages followed and apoptosis was observed
at 48 h and 72 h post -infection. Figure 1 shows CPE
effects of infected MDCK cells and Figure 2 shows the
results of the trypan blue assay.
Although, influenza virus was propagated in the
MDCK cell line, the strains showed low haemagglutination (HA) titres following three passages. The results of
the virus isolation, of titration (TCID50) and of haemmaglutination of the isolates are summarised in Table 1.
The haemagglutination titre increased by each passage
in most of the samples, but in some specimens there
was no HA titre increase between the passages.

Page 3 of 9

Specimen 2003/9, was the only which showed no haemagglutination, although CPE was observed and PCR
assay (on the 3rd passage) was positive. HI titres were
obtained only with Newmarket/2/93.
3.2 Molecular Analysis

2003 samples: equine influenza virus was detected by
RT-PCR assay (a band of 244 bp) in 11 out of 20 swab
extracts and from all 11 cell culture extracts after 3 passages in MDCK cells.
2007 samples: equine influenza virus was detected by
RT-PCR assay in 7 out of 10 swab extracts and from all
5 cell extracts after 3 passages in MDCK cells.
Moreover the RT-PCR for the detection of HA3 and
NA8 equine influenza A subtype amplified a band of
884 bp and a band of 678 bp, respectively in the same
samples from both outbreaks.
During our experiments incompatibility was found
between SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR Platinum Taq
(Invitrogen S.R.L.) (used at the RT-PCR for HA gene)
and GeneAmp PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) (used at
the nested PCR for HA gene). There were no results by
using GeneAmp PCR kit (Applied Biosystems), not even
for the positive control.
The detailed analysis of the sequences of HA and NA
genes obtained of both outbreaks were deposited in
GenBank (accession nos. NCBI:HM164058, NCBI:
HM164059, NCBI:FJ605181, NCBI:FJ605182 and NCBI:
HM164056, NCBI:HM164057, NCBI:HM164055, NCBI:
HM164054 respectively) and revealed 100% similarity
between them. BLAST analysis of the partial sequence
of HA and NA genes confirmed the H3N8 subtype of
the isolate. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of the
Greek isolates with published equine influenza virus
sequences using BLAST is showed in details in Table 2.
HA gene alignment analysis of the Greek isolates
showed no nucleotide substitution among them and in
comparison with A/equine/Newmarket/2/93 strain.
When the amino acid sequences of our isolates were
aligned with a virus isolated in Switzerland in 2007 six
amino acid substitutions (positions 43D-V, 100G-R,
123G-E, 209M-T, 238L-P, 265I-V) were seen.
To define amino acid differences within NA, multiple
alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of
Greek strains and representative H3N8 strains including
vaccine strains was performed. Although Gansu/08, was
defined as most similar strain to ours using BLAST,
they had two nucleotide point mutations which lead to
two amino acid differences, 209I ® V and 229C ® R.
Multiple alignment revealed three nucleotide mutations
and three animo acid differences between our strains
and Huabei/07 (209I ® V, 218E ® A, 229C ® R).
There were observed 6 amino acid substitutions
between Newmarket/5/03 and Greek isolate in positions

equine/Spain/1/2007 and A/equine/Spain/1/2009) when
nucleotide sequences were compared and three (R150Q,
T180A, R229C) and two (N29P, R229C) aminoacid substitutions respectively
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA protein of our isolates
clustered the virus among the Eurasian lineages, but by
the NA protein appeared to be a member of the American lineages and in particular the Florida sub-lineage
clade II. Phylogenetic trees constructed with NJ method
using the HA and NA amino acid sequences are shown
in Figure 3 and Figure 4. The topology of the maximum-likehood tree for both HA and NA sequences
showed four clades corresponding to the Pre-diverge,
American, Eurasian and Florida lineage viruses. The
Greek isolates were well supported within the Eurasian
clade, as seen for the HA protein with bootstrap value

90% and 99% within the Florida sublineage clade II for
the NA protein.

4 Discussion
The objective of our study was to isolate and characterize the influenza virus causing respiratory disease outbreaks in unvaccinated horses, which were Directigen
Flu A positive, in Athens during 2003 and 2007 outbreaks. The results from all assays revealed that the causative agent of the outbreaks was an equine H3N8
influenza virus. This is the first report of molecular and
phylogenetic analysis of the virus in Greece.
Equine influenza virus was isolated in MDCK continuous cell line from 16 samples (out of 18 RT-PCR positive samples) from both outbreaks. This is a
comparatively high percentage (89%) as Morley et al.
(1995) [24] reported 7% influenza virus isolations from
nasal swab extracts obtained from horses with acute
respiratory disease during influenza epidemics.

and cells culture extracts which resulted in a homogenous preparation with respect to the HA gene. This was
not in agreement with previous studies which support
the use of embryonated eggs duo to lack of selection of
changes in the HA compared to their propagation in
cells [25,26]. On the other hand, the propagation of the
virus in cell lines and not in embryonated eggs may be
responsible for the low haemagglutination titres.
The Greek isolates were classified as members of the
Eurasian lineage analysing the HA sequences and Florida sub-lineage member viruses seen with the NA
sequence. Reassortment between a Eurasian and a Florida sub lineage clade II strain might be responsible for
this. Our findings are with compliance with previous

reports of reassortment between genes of district
lineages. Bryant et al., referred that A/equine/Lincolnshire.1/06 obtained an European-like NS gene and a
Florida Clade II- like HA gene [11]. It was suggested
that circulating Florida sub-lineage virus strains may be
able to acquire gene segments from a simultaneously
circulating Eurasian strain, potentially resulting in
changes in pathogenicity [11]. Differences in pathogenicity have been observed between Eurasian and American
lineage viruses in experimental infection of ponies
[27,28].
One possible explanation of the Eurasian lineage-like
HA gene is that the virus isolated from the two outbreaks in Greece is an example of “frozen evolution”.

Endo et al (1992) [29] was the first who described this
phenomenon, which refers to viruses that appear to date
from earlier isolates. A/eq/Switzerland/07, the latest isolate being characterized as a Eurasian lineage virus is an
example of “frozen evolution”. A/equine/Cheshire/1/06,
which showed 100% similarity to the prototype strain A/
equine/Newmarket/1/93, was another evidence of frozen
evolution as it was characterised as a member of the
American lineage [11]. This may result from a reduced
amount of antigenic drift compared to the majority of
circulating EIVs.
Another possible explanation for isolation of viruses
that are similar to virus reference strains, is laboratory
contamination or vaccine origin as suggested previously

[30]. Laboratory contamination was unlikely in our case,
as none of the strains to which the A/equine/Athens
viruses are most closely related are handled in our
laboratory. In addition to this, the two set of isolates
from 2003 and 2007, were inoculated in MDCK cells
and tested by RT-PCR assay with two years difference.
It is worthwhile to refer that all the horses in our study
were unvaccinated as in most of previous reports of frozen evolution [11,29,31-33] isolates were from unvaccinated animals or animals with uncertain vaccination
history. One possible explanation of the small number
of isolates belonging to this lineage may be that these
viruses are circulating among unvaccinated animals or
the Eurasian lineage may be dying out. However, Tu et

Bountouri et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:350
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/350

al., demonstrated that an H3N8 equine influenza strain
member of the European strain transmitted to pigs in
China in 2005 and 2006 [34]. The sequencing analysis
of the eight gene segments of the swine isolates revealed
that they were more closely related to European equine
influenza viruses from the early 1990s. This is evidence
that the horse may not be the dead-end host. Thus,
members of this lineage continue to circulate among
equine populations or periodically reintroduced into
horse populations from an unknown source [34].
The precedent for co-circulation of multiple lineages
of EIVs over a number of years without one replacing
the other, reinforce the possibility of reassortment
reported here. Co-circulation of EIVs led to concerns
that in future viruses that show evolution stasis may reemerge from unvaccinated populatios and threaten vaccinated populations [33].
In order to clarify whether this was only a sporadic
phenomenon, and to determine the origin of the reassorted strains further sequencing analysis of the genome
H3N8 viruses needs to be performed.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study is the first report of the
successful isolation and genetic characterization of an
H3N8 equine influenza virus that were causing respiratory disease in un-vaccinated horses in Greece. Strains
isolated from both outbreaks in 2003 and 2007 were
more closely related to older European lineage H3N8
subtype strains according to their HA sequences, indicating that older viruses may continue to circulate perhaps in unvaccinated horses. However, Greek strains
appeared to be members of the Florida sublineage clade
II by the NA gene sequencing. One possible explanation
would be that the strains were derived by reassortment
of co-circulated strains. Increased international movement of horses for breeding and competition purposes
constitutes an important factor in the spread of equine
pathogens throughout the world [12]. The circulation,
spread and reassortment of genetically distinct strains is
therefore not surprising. Further study is needed to
determine the circulation dynamics of H3N8 influenza
virus.
