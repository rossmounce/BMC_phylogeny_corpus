Abstract
Background: The zebrafish intestine is a simple tapered tube that is folded into three sections. However, whether the
intestine is functionally similar along its length remains unknown. Thus, a systematic structural and functional
characterization of the zebrafish intestine is desirable for future studies of the digestive tract and the intestinal biology
and development.
Results: To characterize the structure and function of the adult zebrafish intestine, we divided the intestine into seven
roughly equal-length segments, S1-S7, and systematically examined the morphology of the mucosal lining, histology
of the epithelium, and molecular signatures from transcriptome analysis. Prominent morphological features are
circumferentially-oriented villar ridges in segments S1-S6 and the absence of crypts. Molecular characterization of the
transcriptome from each segment shows that segments S1-S5 are very similar while S6 and S7 unique. Gene ontology
analyses reveal that S1-S5 express genes whose functions involve metabolism of carbohydrates, transport of lipids and
energy generation, while the last two segments display relatively limited function. Based on comparative Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis, the first five segments share strong similarity with human and mouse small intestine while S6
shows similarity with human cecum and rectum, and S7 with human rectum. The intestinal tract does not display the
anatomical, morphological, and molecular signatures of a stomach and thus we conclude that this organ is absent
from the zebrafish digestive system.
Conclusions: Our genome-wide gene expression data indicate that, despite the lack of crypts, the rostral, mid, and
caudal portions of the zebrafish intestine have distinct functions analogous to the mammalian small and large
intestine, respectively. Organization of ridge structures represents a unique feature of zebrafish intestine, though they
produce similar cross sections to mammalian intestines. Evolutionary lack of stomach, crypts, Paneth cells and
submucosal glands has shaped the zebrafish intestine into a simpler but unique organ in vertebrate intestinal biology.
Background
The surface of the intestine epithelium is the site where
nutrients are absorbed into the body. This absorption
function is aided by expanding the surface area of the gut
into villi at the tissue level and microvilli at the cellular
level. Consequently, the mouse and human intestine has

become a model for studying how this large surface
develops during embryogenesis, the role of stem cells in
the renewal of the epithelium, and development of colorectal cancer [1-3]. However, these complex problems
can be studied in a simpler system, the zebrafish (Danio
rerio), which has emerged as an important vertebrate
model for study of not only human development but also
diseases [4-6].
So far, morphological development of zebrafish intestine has been relatively well characterized in embryos and
larvae [7-11], However, the organization and physiology
of digestive tract has not been specifically documented

for adult zebrafish although several books are available
for description of general fish intestine anatomy [12-14].
Zebrafish, like many fish, lacks a morphologically and
functionally distinct stomach and does not express genes
that encode specific gastric functions [9-12]. Sections of
intact zebrafish embryos and juveniles from whole animal
serial sections and microCT tomography reveal the
digestive tract from pharynx and esophagus to the three
sections of the folded intestine and anus [15-17]. Previous
studies have described the zebrafish intestine as a tapered
tube that begins at the esophageal junction and is folded
into three sections, the large diameter rostral intestinal
bulb, the mid-intestine, and the small diameter caudal
intestine [9]. However, it is not known whether these
regions are functionally distinct or whether their functions correspond to the mammalian stomach, small intestine or large intestine. In this study, we characterized the
anterior-posterior axis of adult zebrafish intestine at tissue, cellular and molecular levels. By comparing the morphological and molecular characteristics, we identified
structurally and functionally distinct areas that correspond to the small intestine and large intestine but not
stomach.

Results
Architectural differences along the zebrafish intestinal tract

The anterior-posterior axis of the digestive tract has been
previously described for embryonic and juvenile
zebrafish [7] and cyprinids [15,16]. In summary, the adult
digestive tract consists of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, intestine, and anus (Additional file 1). However, the
zebrafish belongs to the group of stomach-less fishes in
which the intestine transits directly from esophagus. In
adult fish, it is folded into three sections: the rostral intestinal bulb, mid-intestine and caudal intestine (Figure 1A),
as previously reported by Wallance et al [9]. When dissected from the animal and freed of the surrounding mesentery, the intestine remains folded by two turns into
three straight regions that correspond anatomically to the
three portions as observed in vivo (Figure 1B). Their
diameters decrease along the anterior-posterior axis (Figure 1B).
To characterize intestinal function, we subdivided the
intestinal bulb, mid-intestine, and caudal sections into
seven segments, S1-S7 (Figure 1B) and examined their
architecture under a light microscope. We observe that
the zebrafish intestine surface in segments S1-S6 is covered by ridges that are oriented circumferentially across
the intestine axis (Figure 1C-1I, as previously reported
[9]. The ridges are densely packed and highly branched.
In segment S6 the ridges are shorter and broader than the
anterior segments. Segment S7 is morphologically distinguished from the other six segments by a smooth surface
devoid of any folds or villus-type structures (Figure 1I).

Cross-sections of the intestinal segments reveal a simple architecture for the zebrafish digestive tract of a
mucosa, muscularis externa and serosa layer (Figure 2).
The intestinal mucosa consists obviously of columnarshaped enterocytes and mucous-secreting goblet cells.
Other types of cells such as enteroendocrine cells may be
identified by special staining or GFP transgenic labelling
[8-10]. An underlying lamina propria contains blood capillaries, lymphatic vessels, muscle fibres and mesenchymal cells. The general architecture of zebrfish intestine,
as revealed through cross-sections, resembles that of the
mammalian intestine as described previously [9]. The
mucosal layer is directly ensheathed by circular and longitudinal smooth muscle tiers of the muscularis externa
within which are embedded the plexus of myenteric neurons as reported previously [8,9]. In the mammalian duodenum, a typical submucosal layer contains Brunner's
glands, the branched tubular or branched tubuloalveolar
glands that produce alkaline secretions to neutralize the
acidic chime entering the duodenum [17]. However, in
the zebrafish intestine the submucosa layer and Brunner's
glands are absent (Figure 2).
Consistent with our earlier observations of intestinal
ridges in segments S1 to S6 and absence of ridges in S7,
these ridges in cross-section resemble the spatially separate villi in the mouse or human small intestine (Figure 2).
In contrast to the mammalian intestine, crypts are absent
from the base of the ridges and specialized crypt cells
such as Paneth cells are not observed [9]. The villar ridges
are comparable in height from segments S1 to S5 (Figure
2, shorten and broaden in segment S6 (Figure 2F), and
absent in segment S7 (Figure 2G). Segments S5-S7 often
contain compact excretions that are ensheathed by a
mucous layer (stained blue by Alcian Blue in Figure 2G).
In addition to the absence of villi, segment S7 is distinguished by its lining of abundant goblet cells that are
interspersed by absorptive epithelial cells (Figure 2G).
The muscularis externa is apparent, but the mucosa layer,
in general, appears very thin compared with other segments of the intestine. Thus, based on histology and
architecture, the intestinal lining is divided into three
morphologically distinct regions, segments S1-5, S6, and
S7.
Distinct molecular signatures along the zebrafish intestinal
tract

Based on gross morphology, segments S1-S5 are similar
while segments S6 and S7 are different. These differences
in structure suggest that there should be inherent differences in function. To test this idea, we examined and
compared the molecular signatures of each segment by
profiling their transcriptional activity. Using a standard
Bonferroni corrected p-value < 0.1 (adjusted for false discovery) applied to results from a one-way ANOVA analy-

sis, we identified 2,558 genes that were differentially
expressed in at least one of the seven segments and organized the genes by hierarchical clustering analysis [18]
(Figure 3A) for similarities in patterns of gene expression.
This analysis sorted the seven segments in their anatomical sequence, S1-S7 with S1-S5 more similar to each other
than to segments, S6 and S7.
To understand the significance of the clusters, we then
applied a threshold of 2.0 fold against pooled RNA
extracted from whole adult zebrafish to the set of 2,558
genes from the ANOVA analysis. This analysis shows the
numbers of genes that are abundantly expressed in each
individual segment are: 830 (S1), 801 (S2), 820 (S3), 818
(S4), 825 (S5), 950 (S6) and 1023 (S7). To determine the
extent to which genes are commonly expressed along the

intestinal tract, we determined the overlap in gene sets
between pairs of adjacent segments (Figure 3B). Consistent with the clustering results in Figure 3A, significant
intersection was found between segments S1-S5 [more
than 700 genes (or ≥89.9%) for each overlap, Figure 3B].
However, segments S6 and S7 express quite different sets
of genes than the anterior segments. S5 and S6 overlap in
12.3% genes while S6 and S7 share only 45.2% genes in
common. Similar results were also observed from analysis of down-regulated genes (Additional file 2).
To confirm these patterns of overlap, we identified a
number of genes that were either highly expressed in segments S1-S5 (e.g. gdpd1, chchd7, zgc:11410, hbl3, etc) or
in segments S6 and S7 (e.g. trp, ctsl1, ctsc, gnb3, gsbp1,
ppp2r2 d, etc), suggesting a comprehensive functional

transition along the zebrafish intestine (Figure 4A). The
expression patterns of vil1l (Figure 4B), fabp2 (Figure 4C),
apoa1 (Figure 4D), apoa4 (Figure 4E), cfl1 (Figure 4F),
zgc:110410 (Figure 4G), typ (Figure 4H) and ctsl1 (Figure
4I) were confirmed by real time RT-PCR. Thus, based on
the molecular analyses, the zebrafish intestine can be
divided into three molecularly distinct regions as represented by segments S1-S5, S6, S7, respectively.
Molecular features of the small and large intestine-like
functions

Having shown the intestine can be subdivided into three
regions, S1-S5, S6, and S7, based on similarities in
expressed genes, we investigated whether the identity of
the genes gives insight into intestine function and thus we
selected several intestinal marker genes for more detailed
analysis.
The functions of the mouse and human small intestine
have been characterized by well known molecular markers including fabp2 [19], vil1l [20-22], apoa1 and apoa4
[23-25]. All of these genes were detected in S1-S5 in our
microarray analyses by their higher levels of expression
compared with total RNAs from whole fish (Figure 4A)

and confirmed by real time RT-PCR analyses (Figure 4BE). Intestinal fabp2 gene encodes a fatty acid binding protein that is specifically involved in the intracellular transport of fatty acids in the small intestine [19,26,27]. This
gene is highly conserved in teleosts, amphibians, avians
and mammals [28]. Previously, an RFP transgenic
zebrafish line under the intestinal fabp2 promoter,
Tg(fabp2:RFP), has been generated and RFP reporter
gene is specifically expressed in the intestine [29]. To further verify the expression of intestinal fabp2, we isolated
an intestine from a 3-month-old Tg(fabp2:RFP) transgenic zebrafish and found that RFP fluorescence was high
in segments S1-S4, but quickly diminished around the
second turn of the intestine (Additional file 3, Panel B).
This expression pattern was also confirmed by direct
detection of endogenous fabp2 mRNA expression by in
situ hybridization (Additional file 3, Panel C). Closely
resembling the pattern of fabp2 expression, villin expression is also restricted to the mammalian gastrointestinal
tracts where it is highly expressed in the small intestine
[21]. Our microarray data show that zebrafish villin gene
(vil1l) is highly expressed in segments S1-S5 and its
expression is reduced in segments S6 and S7. This finding

is further validated by real time RT-PCR (Figure 4C),
where the expression of vil1l decreases in segment S5 and
to a negligible level in segments S6 and S7. In further support that segments S1-S4 possess features of a small
intestine, another two conserved markers, apoa1 and
apoa4, also showed similar expression pattern to fabp2
and vil1l genes along the anterior-posterior axis of
zebrafish intestine. These two genes can also be consid-

ered to be reliable molecular markers for small intestine
because in 36 human tissues and 45 mouse tissues examined, expression of mammalian Apoa1 and Apoa4 are
highly restricted to the digestive organs including small
intestine and liver (GSE2361 and GDS182, GEO database,
NCBI). These patterns of small intestine markers
together with the transcriptome data suggest that the

small intestine comprises segments S1-S4 and transition
into a different function occurs in segment S5.
If segments S1-S4 are small intestine-like, then we
investigated whether S5-S7 expresses gene markers for
the large intestine. Two genes, cfl1 (cofilin1) and aqp3
(aquaporin 3), distinguish segments S5-S7 from S1-S4.
Cfl1 belongs to a family of actin-binding proteins and
mediates dynamic stabilization of actin filaments [30].
Our microarray and real time RT-PCR data (Figure 4A, F)
indicate that cfl1 is primarily expressed in segments S5S7, but down-regulated in the first four segments. Analysis of rat EST database suggests that cfl1 is expressed in
the large intestine but not in the small intestine (Unigene's EST profile viewer, Unigene Rn.11675, NCBI).
Similarly, our microarray data indicated increased
expression of Aqp3, an osomoregulatory channel protein
on membrane of epithelial cells [31], particularly in the
large intestine of mammals [32] and mucus cells of the
posterior intestine of teleost eel [33], in segments S6 and
S7 (Figure 4A, Dr.76207). Aquaporins are water channel
proteins that facilitate water movement, hence increase
water permeability, across cell membrane and the
increase expression of Aqp3 is therefore important for
absorption of water in the intestine, in particular, for the
faecal dehydration in the large intestine. In line with this,
the mammalian aquaporin 3 is expressed along the gastrointestinal tract, with its highest expression in the colon
[31,32]. Thus, while segments S1-S5 possess molecular
features of small intestine, segments S6 and S7 have
molecular features of large intestine with segment S5 as a
transitional region).
Analysis of gene ontology (GO) along the anterior-posterior
axis

To infer the functions of the intestinal segments, 2-fold
up-regulated genes against the whole fish reference RNA
were extracted for the three groups, S1-S5 (891 genes), S6
(1147 genes), and S7 (1107 genes). We envision that these
significantly up-regulated genes should better represent
specific functions of different intestinal segments and
thus gene ontology analyses were carried out for these
genes using GOTree Machine [34]. Significantly enriched
(p-value < 0.01) categories in each region are shown in
Additional file 4.
As expected from a major metabolic organ, the intestine of zebrafish harbours a rich collection of genes
involved in metabolism, molecular transport and localization, catalytic activities among others. However, major
differences were found between the three groups of S1S5, S6 and S7. There are 56 categories that were statistically enriched in S1-S5, but only 6 categories in S6 and 8
categories in S7. Among these enriched categories, upregulated genes in S1-S5 are involved in a wide range of
metabolic processes, including metabolism of fatty acid,

Page 7 of 13

organic acid, lipid, vitamin, heme, alcohol, glucose,
hexose, monosacchride, carbohydrate, etc. (Additional
file 4). They also play important roles in energy generation and homeostasis of ion, iron and cations. Notably, a
group of genes are associated with catalytic activities
such as hydrolase activity and transferase activity, which
are important for the absorptive function of the small
intestine. The variety of GO categories in the S1-S5 group
supports the multiple functions of this part of zebrafish
intestine with features of the small intestine (to be discussed below).
The S6 and S7 groups, on the other hand, only show a
few statistically enriched categories. For example, genes
from S6 are involved in oxidoreductase activities while
genes from S7 are enriched in biosynthesis of vitamin and
pyridine nucleotide (Additional file 4). They are also
involved in intracellular signaling and pentosyl/phosphoribosyl transferase activity. It seems that segments S6 and
S7 represent two regions of zebrafish intestine that perform tasks apparently different from those of S1-S5.
Cross-species Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
indicates the segments S1-S5 to be multi-functional

An independent approach to confirm the identity of the
intestine sections as small and large intestine is by taking
the three gene set pools from S1-S5, S6, and S7 and comparing them by GSEA analysis against the whole transcriptomes of the mouse and human stomach, small
intestine and large intestine (GDS182 and GSE2361, GEO
database, NCBI). Results, summarized in Table 1, show
segments S1-S5 closely resemble the small intestines of
mouse and human with highly significant FDR values
(<0.001). Segments S1-S5 show little resemblance to
stomach (mouse FDR = 0.06; human FDR = 0.68) and no
resemblance to the human cecum. Gene ontology analysis shows that majority of the genes corresponding to the
leading edge of the GSEA curve are involved in the
metabolism of lipid, fatty acid, cholesterol and glycerolipid, or involved in peptidase, oxidoreductase activity,
reminiscent of the activities of the mammalian small
intestine (data not shown).
In contrast to segments S1-S5, segment S6 closely
resembles the cecum and rectum of the human large
intestine (FDR < 0.001), while segment S7 resembles
human rectum only (FDR = 0.003). Gene ontology analysis shows that S6 resembles human cecum in glycolysis,
oxidoreductase activity, metabolism of amino acid, amine
derivative, organic acid, carboxylic acid and alcohol.
While in S7, metabolism of membrane lipid was found to
be enriched. Water retention is a common function in
mammalian large intestine. Consistent with this, several
aquaporin genes, including aquaporins 1, 3 and 10 are
highly expressed in S6/S7. In particular, Aquaporin 3 is
well known a key component of faecal dehydration in

mammalian colon [31,32]. Interestingly, although S1-S5
most closely resembles the small intestine, we detected
some significant similarity with functions found in the
human colon and rectum (Table 1), suggesting that the
zebrafish segments S1-S5 may have broader functions.
This phenomena may reflect the less specialized and differentiated features of fish intestine as a primitive species
of vertebrates. This is particularly true for fish "small
intestine" (S1-S5) as it constitutes more than two thirds of
the length of the intestine.
In summary, GSEA analysis supports that segments S1S5 of zebrafish intestine possess features of a mammalian
small intestine, while segments S6 and S7 possess features
of a mammalian large intestine (with S7 resembling rectum in particular).
Stomach-like functions of the intestine

A striking feature of the zebrafish anatomy is the absence
of stomach [9,35]. To understand whether the gut carries
out a cryptic gastric function, we examined the zebrafish
genes encoding enzymes including pepsin and some
digestive proteases with implications of functions of a
stomach. Mammalian pepsinogens are classified into
three major groups and two minor groups [36,37], however, a pepsinogen gene in zebrafish has never been
reported. We searched for potential pepsinogen

sequences in the zebrafish genome. First, we conducted a
BLAST search against the Ensembl genome database
http://www.ensembl.org using sequences of human PGC
(PEPSINOGEN C) and PGA (PEPSINOGEN A) but did
not detect any significant hits relevant to the pepsinogen
gene. Then in a more specific TBLASTN search [38]
using the pfam00026 domain that is well conserved
across all aspartic proteases in vertebrates, we identified
pepsinogen genes as well as some aspartic protease genes
in human, mouse, Xenopus and Fugu fish, together with a
few zebrafish aspartic protease genes and a putative gene
sequence encoding a hypothetical protein NP956325.1.
To determine whether these zebrafish sequences could
represent a pepsinogen gene, relevant amino acid
sequences were aligned, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using quartet puzzling algorithm implemented
in the Tree-Puzzle program [39], and the result was visualized by TreeViewX [40]. Our analysis suggests that the
zebrafish has genes coding for rennin, nothepsin and several members of cathepsins (Figure 5). However, none of
these zebrafish genes resemble the mammalian pepsinogen genes. The genome search results and phylogeny
analysis results together suggest that the pepsinogen gene
locus is not present in the zebrafish genome.
Whereas pepsinogen is not encoded in the zebrafish
genome, other stomach markers may be expressed by the

intestine. For example, lipf is a gastric lipase gene encoding an acidophilic lipase known to be secreted by mammalian gastric chief cells [41,42]. Its expression in human
is restricted to esophagus, stomach and several other tissues, but not in the intestine (Unigene's EST profile
viewer, UniGene Hs.523130, NCBI database). In contrast,
lipf is expressed in all seven segments of the zebrafish
intestine and not restricted to any particular segment
(Figure 4A).

Discussion
For comparison of similarity between zebrafish fragments, we used differentially expressed genes generated
by ANOVA (Figure 2 and Additional file 2). For GO
(Additional file 4) and GSEA (Table 1) analyses, we
selected 2-fold up-regulated genes against the reference
RNA (total whole adult fish RNA) and this selection was

independent of the initial set of differentially expressed
genes selected by ANOVA for similarity analyses. Our
approach would filter out ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes. Abundantly expressed intestine-specific
or enriched transcripts will be retained by the 2-fold
selection as their concentrations in the total fish RNA
pool would be diluted much more than 2 fold. We have
also tried 1.5-fold selection, basically the same GSEA
results were obtained (data not shown).
The results in this study document that the zebrafish
intestine is regionally segmented into a small intestine
and large intestine. This conclusion is supported by morphology and three lines of independent analysis of gene
expression profiles from seven segments of the intestine.
Clustering analysis reveals a general similarity between
S1-S5 and differences between S6 and S7 and the degree
of similarity is measured by the degree of overlap in gene

sets expressed in neighboring segments. Second, we
showed that well-known markers of the mammalian
small and large intestine such as villin, fabp2, and cof1 are
differentially expressed along the anterior-posterior axis.
Finally by ontologies of genes expressed in the segments
are consistent with small and large intestine function and
confirmed by whole transcriptome comparisons with
human and mouse small and large intestine gene sets.
Based on these findings, we suggest that the intestinal
bulb, mid-intestine, and the anterior third of the caudal
intestine corresponds to the small intestine of the mammalian gut while the remaining posterior portion of the
caudal intestine corresponds to the large intestine terminating with the rectum.
In comparison with the mammalian intestine, the
zebrafish intestine has a simple architecture with the
intestinal lining folded into villar ridges rather than distinct finger-shaped villi of the mammalian small intestine.
In cross section, a ridge appears identical to a villus and
thus may be an evolutionary precursor to discrete villi. In
support of this idea, an intermediate stage (from D8D8.5) in the morphogenesis of the chick intestine
includes the initial formation of longitudinally oriented
previllous ridges that buckle into a zig-zag pattern and
eventually form villi in adult intestine. Thus, in birds,
ridges are embryological precursors to villi [43].
In addition to the lack of well-defined villi, the zebrafish
intestine lacks well-defined crypts, infoldings of the intestinal surface where stem cells and proliferating cells are
located [8,9]. Intestinal crypts are normally found at the
base of the villus or lining the colon of the large intestine.
In the zebrafish intestine, mitosis is restricted to the base
of the villar ridges ([9,10] and our unpublished data), suggesting that the Crypts of Lieberkuhn are specializations
of the mammalian intestine. This arrangement also raises
questions about the dynamics of epithelial renewal
because cell proliferation in the intestine is balanced by
apoptosis at the villus tips. Location of apoptosis in the
adult zebrafish intestine is rarely reported but we find
most cell death occurs in the distal portion of the villar
ridges and apoptosis is much more active when compared
with mammalian intestines (our unpublished data). In
contrast, apoptosis in the embryonic and larval zebrafish
intestine goes undetectable until morphogenesis has
completed [8,9], while apoptosis occurs throughout the
development of the mouse duodenum [44] but is reduced
to a few cells per villus during adulthood [45].
Like many other fish including cyprinids and others
[46], the zebrafish has evolved into a stomachless fish [9].
The absence of a functional pepsinogen gene from the
digestive tract is not unique to zebrafish but also occurrs
in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) and other stomach-less
fishes. Interestingly, the expression of pepsinogen gene in
another stomchless fish, the puffer fish (Takifugu rubi-

Page 10 of 13

pes), is restricted to its skin tissue, adopting different
functions [35]. Without a stomach, digestion and absorption must begin as early as possible in the limited length
of the zebrafish digestive tract. Ingested food is temporarily stored in the rostral intestinal bulb that bulges like
an elastic sac, where food starts to be broken down in the
absence of a stomach [47] and the entire length of the
intestine may serve to degrade food.
Based on analysis in larval zebrafish and other cyprinids, previous reports raised that the posterior zebrafish
intestine may be analogous to the mammalian colon
[48,49]. This has also been proposed in a recent study
based on histological data and molecular markers [9].
Here our transcriptome data provide more solid evidence
that this part of intestine in adult zebrafish resembles
mammalian colon and rectum and moreover, segments
S6 and S7 distinguish themselves from each other.

Conclusions
In the present study, the entire intestine of adult zebrafish
was systematically examined at the levels of anatomy, histology and transcriptome. Despite the lack of crypts and
evident structural distinction throughout most of the
length of intestine, our genome-wide gene expression
data have shown that the rostral, mid, and caudal portions of the zebrafish intestine have distinct functions
analogous to the mammalian small and large intestine,
respectively. Organization of ridge structures represents a
unique feature of zebrafish intestine, though they produce similar cross sections to mammalian intestines. Evolutionary lack of stomach, crypts, Paneth cells and
submucosal glands has shaped the zebrafish intestine into
a simpler but unique organ in vertebrate intestinal biology. This scenario may represent an evolutionary primitive feature of the digestive tract, where functional
regionalization precedes morphological regionalization
in a low vertebrate.
Methods
Maintenance of zebrafish and dissection of zebrafish
intestine

Danio rerio of about one year old were maintained following established protocols [50] and in compliance with
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
guidelines. Zebrafish were euthanized by 0.1% 2-phnoxyethanol and their intestines were isolated and cut into
seven segments along the anterior and posterior axis, as
shown in Figure 1B. The seven segments were labeled S1,
S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7, respectively.
Paraffin sectioning of zebrafish intestine

Intestinal segments were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate buffered saline at room temperature overnight. Then the intestine samples were dehydrated in 70%

Wang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:392
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/392

ethanol overnight and further dehydrated in ethanol with
increasing gradients (75%, 90%, 95% and 100%). The samples were cleared in 100% Histoclear II (National Diagnostics, US) for 30 min twice, embedded in liquid paraffin
at 58°C for 30 min, then changed into fresh paraffin for
final embedding at 58°C overnight. Finally, the samples
were sectioned at 7 μm on a Reichert-Jung 2030 microtome (Leica, Germany) and collected onto Fisher SuperFrost slides. The slides were left on a heating block at
42°C overnight before further assays were conducted.
Hematoxylin & Eosin & Alcian blue staining

Tissue sections were stained by Meyer's hematoxylin for
10 min, rinsed in tap water, stained by eosin for 1 min,
followed by dips in acidic ethanol and rinse in tap water.
They were stained by alcian blue (Biogenex, US) for 10
min and rinsed in tap water. Finally, the slides were dehydrated in ethanol of increasing gradients (75%, 90%, 95%
and 100%), cleared by HistoClear II (National Diagnostics, US), mounted with DePeX (EMS, US) mounting
medium and covered by coverslips. Images were taken
using a Zeiss Axiovert imaging system.
Quantitative real-time PCR

Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out in 96-well
plates on a LightCycler 480 system (Roche, Swiss). The
PCR reaction was set up according to the manufacturer's
protocol with optimization of primer-specific annealing
temperature and extension time. PCR products were
labeled by SYBR Green dye. All gene expression levels
were measured and normalized against the level of
house-keeping gene bactin1 expression.
Microarray experiments

Intestines were isolated from male adult zebrafish,
quickly rinsed in 1× phosphate buffered saline/diethylpyrocarbonate, and cut into seven segments according to
Figure 1B. To maintain a more homogenous molecular
background, only male fish were used for microarray
analyses. The same segments from every 10 fish were
pooled as one biological replicate and they were kept in
liquid nitrogen till extraction of RNA. RNA was doubleextracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA). A total of five
replicates were prepared for each segment. For each replicate, 10 μg RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA
with incorporation of aminoallyl-dUTPs. Later the samples were hybridized onto in-house spotted microarray
chips with labeling by Cy5 as described previously [51].
RNAs from whole fish were used as reference for all
experiments and labelled by Cy3. The arrays contained 22
K oligonucleotide probes where 16.4 K probes were
designed by Compugen (USA) [51] and the remaining
probes were in-house designed by the bioinformatics
group in Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). The complete list of gene probes has been submitted to GEO data-

Page 11 of 13

base with the access number GSE20884. For each gene
probe, one 65-mer oligonucleotide probe was designed
from the 3' untranslated region for maximizing gene
specificity. 172 copies of the beta-actin gene probe were
included in each array as calibration spots. All of the oligonucleotide probes were synthesized from Sigma and
spotted on glass slides using the Genemachine robotic
spotter/arrayer (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA) housed at GIS [52]. After hybridization, the
microarray chips were scanned and graded, and raw data
went through two rounds of normalization: They were
first normalized within each single array and second normalized across the whole collection of arrays, using
LOWESS method implemented in Gene Cluster 3.0 during the pre-processing stage.
Identification of differentially expressed genes from the
microarray data

Pre-processed microarray data were visualized and subjected to one-way ANOVA test using MeV MultiExperiment Viewer software [18]. One-way ANOVA test was
performed using a critical p-value of 0.1 with standard
Bonferroni correction for all seven intestinal segments.
The selected genes were used for clustering and expression pattern analysis to compare the similarity and differences in the seven segments.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis by GO Tree Machine

Up-regulated genes were selected for each individual segment based on the fold changes of their expression levels
(at least two told up against the RNA of pooled adult
zebrafish and FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05). Gene ontology was carried out using GOTree Machine, which is a
web-based tool developed by the Vanderbilt University to
analyze gene ontology for a given set of genes [34]. It
compares the distribution of genes in the gene set of
interest in each GO category to those in the reference
gene set, i.e. the transcriptome of zebrafish in our case.
Gene information was retrieved from GeneKeyDB, a
database that integrates gene information from Ensembl,
Swiss-Prot, HomoloGene, Unigene, Gene Ontology Consortium and Affymetrix etc. Statistical tests were used for
the assessment of enrichment of each gene category.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

GSEA is a computational method that determines
whether a priori defined set of genes shows statistically
significant, concordant differences between two biological samples; it calculates an enrichment score using a
running-sum statistic through a ranked list of gene
expression data set [53]. In this work, the software
GSEA2.0 developed by the Broad Institute [53] was used.
The statistical significance of the enrichment score was
estimated by using an empirical phenotype-based permu-

tation test procedure. A false discovery rate was provided
by introducing adjustment of multiple hypothesis testing.
