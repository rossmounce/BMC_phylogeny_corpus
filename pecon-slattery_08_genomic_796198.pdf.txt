Abstract
Background: Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) naturally infects multiple species of cat and is related
to human immunodeficiency virus in humans. FIV infection causes AIDS-like disease and mortality in the
domestic cat (Felis catus) and serves as a natural model for HIV infection in humans. In African lions
(Panthera leo) and other exotic felid species, disease etiology introduced by FIV infection are less clear, but
recent studies indicate that FIV causes moderate to severe CD4 depletion.
Results: In this study, comparative genomic methods are used to evaluate the full proviral genome of two
geographically distinct FIV subtypes isolated from free-ranging lions. Genome organization of FIVPle subtype
B (9891 bp) from lions in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and FIVPle subtype E (9899 bp) isolated
from lions in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, both resemble FIV genome sequence from puma, Pallas cat
and domestic cat across 5' LTR, gag, pol, vif, orfA, env, rev and 3'LTR regions. Comparative analyses of
available full-length FIV consisting of subtypes A, B and C from FIVFca, Pallas cat FIVOma and two puma FIVPco
subtypes A and B recapitulate the species-specific monophyly of FIV marked by high levels of genetic
diversity both within and between species. Across all FIVPle gene regions except env, lion subtypes B and E
are monophyletic, and marginally more similar to Pallas cat FIVOma than to other FIV. Sequence analyses
indicate the SU and TM regions of env vary substantially between subtypes, with FIVPle subtype E more
related to domestic cat FIVFca than to FIVPle subtype B and FIVOma likely reflecting recombination between
strains in the wild.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates the necessity of whole-genome analysis to complement population/
gene-based studies, which are of limited utility in uncovering complex events such as recombination that
may lead to functional differences in virulence and pathogenicity. These full-length lion lentiviruses are
integral to the advancement of comparative genomics of human pathogens, as well as emerging disease in
wild populations of endangered species.

Background
Feline immunodefiency viruses (FIV) naturally infect cat
species in the wild and are related to other lentiviruses
known to infect primates (human and simian immunodeficiency viruses, HIV and SIV), sheep and goats (caprine
arthritis encephalitis virus -CAEV), horse (equine infectious anemia virus-EIAV), and cattle (bovine immunodeficiency virus-BIV). FIV is endemic in Felidae species [112], many of which are considered endangered or threatened with extinction [13]. A recent comprehensive survey
of serum and lymphocyte specimens from 3055 individuals affirm that at least 11 free-ranging and, if captive animals are included, as many as 31 species of cat are infected
with FIV [4]. Phylogenetic analyses of the pol-RT region
sequenced from six of these felid species, plus spotted
hyaena, Crocuta crocuta, affirm the high level of speciesspecificity worldwide [4,11,14-17]. Each species specific
FIV forms a distinct monophyletic lineage, separated by
substantial genetic divergence that suggests virus-host
adaptation and rare episodes of interspecies transmission
in the wild [4,18].
The effects of FIV infection and disease are well described
in domestic cat (Felis catus) but less so in exotic felids.
FIVFca infection in domestic cat is analogous to HIV infection of humans causing early flu-like symptoms, followed
by severe weight loss, chronic wasting disease, and
increased susceptibility to rare cancers and opportunistic
disease, neurologic disease and death [19,20]. Captive
and wild populations of two species, the African lion
(Panthera leo) infected with FIVPle and the puma (Puma
concolor), infected with FIVPco exhibit less severe disease
associations. However, infected lions show a dramatic
decline in CD4+ subsets, a reduction of the CD4+/CD8+
ratio, reduction of CD8+βhigh cells, and expansion of the
CD8+βlow subset relative to uninfected lions [21-23]. Further, FIVPco infected puma display a more generalized
response of lymphopenia expressed as a significant
decline in total lymphocytes, CD5+ T-cells, and CD5lymphocytes as well as a significant reduction in CD4+ Tcells [23]. Like lions, seropositive pumas have a significant decline in CD8+βhigh cells but differ by not showing
compensatory expansion of CD8+βlow cells relative to
controls [23]. The results observed with FIV-infected lion
and puma parallels human (HIV) and Asian monkey
(SIV) CD4+ diminution, and suggests there may be an
immunological cost of FIV infection in these two species
of large cats.
Identification of genetic correlates of FIV virulence, infectivity, and pathogenicity in different cat species is limited
due to a paucity of complete genome sequence. Only subtypes A, B and C from domestic cat FIVFca [24-26], subtypes A and B from puma FIVPco[14,27] and a single strain
(FIVOma) from Pallas cat (Otocolobus manul) [16] have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/66

been sequenced in entirety. Here we present full-length
provirus sequenced from FIVPle subtype B isolated from
lions in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and FIVPle
subtype E from lions dwelling in the Okavango Delta in
Botswana. These two FIVPle subtypes exhibit a range in
sequence divergence throughout the genome, share
motifs unique to this lion-specific lentivirus, yet also
exhibit unusual and significant differences in the env gene.

Results and Discussion
Genomic Organization and Sequence Divergence of FIVPle
Subtypes
FIVPle subtypes B (accession number EU117991) and E
(accession number EU117992) share a similar genome
organization with other FIV which consists of LTR, gag,
pol, vif, orfA, env, and additional small ORFs that may represent accessory genes including rev (Table 1). The total
proviral genome size was conserved between FIVPle subtype B (9899 bp) and subtype E (9891 bp) (Table 1). FIVPle gag encodes three putative structural proteins of matrix,
capsid and nucleocapsid. Pol is conserved and encodes key
viral enzymes of protease, reverse transcriptase, RNAase,
dUTPase and integrase. FIVPle vif, an accessory protein
essential for viral replication, resembles that of FIVFca.
OrfA in FIVPle is similar to FIVFca and likely corresponds to
HIV tat, which targets transcription factors in the LTR. FIVPle env encodes the putative leader, surface (SU), and transmembrane (TM) regions of the envelope glycoprotein,
essential components for viral binding to and entry into
the host cell. FIVPle rev is similar to HIV/FIV rev, and is
thought to be critical in viral replication. FIVPle rev appears
to be encoded by splicing two exons: the first in the leader
region of env, the second located near the 3' region adjacent to env (Table 1).

The LTR of FIVPle contains transcription and regulatory elements common to other FIV. These include the direct 2 bp
repeat (IR) defining the 5' and 3' termini of LTR, AP-4,
Aml-1 (EPB20), AP-1, TATA box, Poly A, and the cap transcription initiation site (Figure 1). FIVPle subtypes have
additional transcription factors characteristic of FIV, but
placed in alternate locations within the LTR U3 including
NF-AT and CREBP-1/c-Jun. These and other motifs were
determined by homology search with a threshold value of
85% with the Motif Search database [28] [see Additional
file 1]. Overall, lion LTRs are not identical between subtypes B and E, differing by 15% in nucleotide substitutions, comparable to that observed between FIVFca
subtypes A, B and C (Figure 1, Figure 2A).
Deep genetic divergence between FIV strains from different cat species made alignments problematic. For coding
regions, we first translated each gene into amino acid residues, which are less divergent as changes occur at a lower
rate of substitution, to serve as a "scaffold" for alignment

of nucleotides using the program RevTrans [29]. Our
results indicate that pol (3657 bp) is the most conserved
gene across FIV, albeit exhibiting substantial average pairwise genetic distances of 60% and 54% for nucleotide and
amino acid data, respectively (Table 2). Gag sequences
(1551 bp) differed by an average pairwise genetic distance
of 65.8% for nucleotides, a 53.2% amino acids (Table 2).
However, vif (870 bp), orfA (351 bp), and env (2958 bp)
were highly divergent. For these genes, sufficient homology existed to both identify the gene, and to create a multiple sequence alignment across all FIV yet, phylogenetic
models for patterns of substitution at variable sites were
saturated resulting in an average genetic distance of 100%
for both nucleotide and amino acid data (Table 2). Such
differences in rates of evolution between viral genes corroborate previous findings describing functional con-

straints for gag and pol [7,8,17], while also demonstrating
that vif, orfA, and env rapidly evolve in each host species.
Phylogenetic Analyses of FIVPle Subtypes
The evolution of FIVPle subtypes is defined by separate
phylogenetic analyses of each viral gene as well as combined data of concatenated sequences representing the
entire coding region of FIV. LTR, gag, pol, vif and orfA
affirm the species-specificity of FIV both in individual
gene analyses (Figure 2A–E) and in the combined concatenated data phylogeny excluding env (Figure 2F). The
three subtypes of FIVFca from the domestic cat exhibit the
least amount of genetic divergence within each viral gene
phylogeny. Sharing a monophyletic lineage with distantly
related FIVOma, the FIVPle subtypes B and E have intermediate levels of genetic distance with each viral gene exam-

ined. Subtypes A and B of FIVPco are the most divergent
and have substantial differences across the viral genome.
Thus, the hierarchical pattern of genetic divergence
among full-length genomic analyses of FIVFca, FIVPle and
FIVPco recapitulates earlier evolutionary studies based on
portions of pol-RT and gag [4,7,8,10-12,17,30,31].
The relative differences in genetic diversity among FIV
strains may be correlated with the amount of time since
the virus entered modern felids and therefore, can be
interpreted in the context of the evolutionary and phylogeographic history of each host species. The domestic cat
evolved as a unique felid lineage only around 10,000 year
ago [32] from subspecies of wildcat Felis silvestris inhabiting Near East Asia [33]. Preliminary results from limited
seroprevalence studies, indicate that FIV appears to be
absent from nearly all of the close relatives of domestic cat
[(genus Felis after [34]] except for French European wildcat F. silvestris [4,35]. Thus, the pattern of FIVFca divergence
may represent recent emergence combined with rapid
viral diversification within the domestic cat world-wide.
In contrast, the puma is one of the oldest species within
Felidae, sharing an evolutionary lineage with the African
cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and the New World jaguarundi
(Puma yagouaroundi) and arose approximately 4.5 MYA
[34]. The extreme divergence between subtypes A and B

within the FIVPco lineage suggests an ancient origin of FIV
infection of puma, a result consistent with the published
pol-RT phylogeny marked by high levels of intra-subtype
divergence of FIVPco subtypes from throughout the host
species range [4,8,11]. Lastly, the African lion species
arose approximately 2 MYA and spread throughout Africa,
Asia and the Americas [34]. However, due to episodes of
population reduction followed by expansion from East
Africa and recolonization, genomic diversity in modern
lion populations coalesces to approximately 325,000
years ago and is confined the African continent [36].
FIVOma is found in wild populations of the Eurasian Pallas
cat [4], a species that arose during the late Pleistocene
[34]. The monophyletic lineage of Pallas cat FIVOma and
African lion FIVPle observed here suggest more ancient
inter-species transmission as the last time lions and Pallas
cats were in geographic contact was during the Pleistocene
when lion ranges spread throughout Asia, providing a
possible opportunity for FIV transmission between these
species [37].

gene. Phylogenetic analyses of the entire concatenated
coding region (9391 bp) and separate analysis of the env
gene (2958 bp) show the two FIVPle subtypes are no longer
monophyletic (Figure 3A and 3B). A closer examination
of the env gene shows only two shared regions of homology between FIVPle subtypes. The first spans the sites 1–
519 of env, containing exon 1 of rev (Table 1), within the
leader region exhibiting 80% nucleotide and 68% amino
acid homology between FIVPle subtypes. The second
region occurs at the terminal 3' region of env (sites 2506–
2958) with 87% and 71% genetic identity for nucleotides
and amino acid, respectively. Based on comparison with
FIVFca, this region of FIVPle may be the rev responsive element (RRE), which is critical for targeting rev to the nucleolus of the cell [38]. As rev is conserved between lion
subtypes, it is likely that RRE must remain conserved as
well.

By contrast, the SU and TM regions of env differ substantially between FIVPle subtypes (Figure 4). A contiguous
region of env, from amino acid sites 181 through 931
(green in Figure 4), shows that FIVPle subtype E is more
similar to FIVFca than to FIVPle subtype B. Further, env of
FIVPle subtype B, concordant with results from other gene
trees (Figure 2A–E), shares more homology with FIVOma
(blue in Figure 4). Moreover, the lack of monophyly
between FIVPle subtype B and FIVOma (Figure 3) is a consequence of the recombinant env of FIVPle subtype E, as
exclusion of this subtype from the analyses (data not
shown) recovered the monophyletic relationship
observed with other genome regions (Figure 2A–E).
The predicted env protein from both FIVPle strains were
compared to other published FIV strains with respect to
inferred structural elements, with particular focus on
regions known to be important for receptor binding. Con-

Figure sequence alignment of Oma
Multiple4
Multiple sequence alignment of amino acids of env from FIVPle subtypes B and E compared with FIVFca subtypes A, B and C,
FIVPco subtypes A and B, and FIVOma. Significant structures within the env gene inferred from Smirnova et al. 2005 are indicated
in colored boxes. Putative regions include: conserved amino acids (white box), variable regions V1-V9 (red box); epitope binding sites (orange box); conserved cysteine (red highlight); N glycosylation sites (yellow highlight). Homologous region shared
between FIVPle subtypes B and E are highlighted in grey. Amino acid sites 1–176 contain the first exon of rev (see Table 1) in lion
FIVPle subtypes B and E. The portion of env proposed to be a result of recombination in FIVPle subtype E is highlighted in green.
The corresponding region of env thought to represent FIVPle without recombination, as it is more homologous to FIVOma, is
highlighted in blue. Amino acids sites 931–978 (grey) likely contain the RRE element shared by lion FIVPle subtypes B and E.

served (white in Figure 4) and variable regions (red in Figure 4) and epitope binding sites (orange in Figure 4) were
identified based on their locations in the domestic cat FIV
sequences [39]. The V3-V5 regions shared least homology
between the two strains. In FIVFca, this region has been

shown to contain the CXCR4 binding site [40], neutralizing antibody binding sites [41-43] and several epitopes
important for cell tropism and cell line adaptation [4446]. Within the V3-V5 region, several biochemical differences have been noted between domestic and non-

domestic cat lentiviruses [39]. FIVPle subtype B demonstrated properties more similar to other non-domestic cat
lentiviruses including a negative charge and fewer cysteine
residues within this region. Conversely, FIVPle subtype E
had a positive charge and more cysteines in V3-V5, more
similar to the domestic cat lentiviruses. Both lion FIVs had
similar numbers of predicted N-glycosylation sites (10
and 11 for B and E, respectively) and these numbers are
intermediate to the domestic cat FIVs (8–10) and the
other non-domestic FIVs (13–14). A similar trend of
lower charge and more cysteine residues in B than E was
noted in V3, the region implicated as receptor binding
domain for FIV [44,46,47]. In contrast, the more conserved regions flanking V3-V5 were more positively
charged in FIVPle subtype B than in FIVPle subtype E, but
contained similar numbers of cysteine residues and putative N-glycosylation sites. Such differences suggest that
substantial divergence may occur in secondary and tertiary structures at the receptor-binding region of these two
lion lentiviruses.
Recombination in lentiviruses is not uncommon. In the
ongoing global HIV pandemic, at least 34 circulating
recombinant forms from HIV-1 subtypes have been so far
described in patients world-wide [48]. SIV full genome
sequence comparisons increasingly depict extant primate
lentiviruses with mosaic structures indicative of multiple
recombination events over time [49-54]. In FIVFca, recombination in the V3-V5 region of env was detected between
subtypes A and B in feral cats [7], and different recombination frequencies occur between large regions of FIVPco
subtype B in domestic cat experimentally infected with
FIVPco B [31]. Whereas the frequency of FIVPle recombination is not yet known, our studies show that over 40% of
Serengeti lions in Tanzania are multiply infected with FIVPle subtypes A, B and C, which circulate freely within this
large population [6] and thus offer opportunities for
recombination.
The recombination of env in FIV infected lions has interesting evolutionary significance because the divergence in
this region is extensive between the two subtypes. Therefore, subtype E recombination may represent an ancient
event of recombination followed by a long period of
divergence, or a more recent recombination with a highly
divergent but as yet unsequenced strain either from lions
or another African felid species. Although FIVPle subtype E
env is more similar to FIVFca than to any other known FIV
the extent of genetic divergence is still quite substantial,
i.e. 64.4% nucleotide relative to FIVFca subtype C (Table
2), suggesting that if recombination has occurred recently,
it is likely to have been with strain that has not yet been
sequenced for the env gene. This recombination event may
also have functional implications, as FIVPle subtype E env
has structural features more similar to pathogenic FIVFca.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/66

Further investigation into complete genome analyses of
FIVPle subtypes A, C, D and F as well as FIV from other
seropositive African felids, will likely provide new insights
into the role of recombination in env in the wild. Clinical
studies will help to clarify the significance of these recombination events.

Conclusion
Ongoing efforts to sequence full genome FIV from all
seropositive exotic cat species will be essential to understanding the evolutionary trajectory of these viruses
including the origin and frequency of recombination
within FIV. This study demonstrates the necessity of
whole-genome analysis to compliment population/genebased studies, which are of limited utility in uncovering
complex events such as recombination that may lead to
functional differences in virulence and pathogenicity. The
changes observed in the env gene as a consequence of
recombination in FIVPle will provide important clues to
the natural history of these viruses and their hosts, and
may lead to insights into genetic determinants of pathogenicity and virulence differences between domestic cat
and lion FIV; findings with important implications for
HIV pathogenesis in humans and virus attenuation in
wild populations of endangered species.

Methods
Cell Culture of FIVPle Subtype E Botswana lion Ple-1027
FIVPle subtype E was isolated from PBMCs (whole blood
with EDTA) collected from wild lions in the Okavango
Delta in Botswana, viably frozen under field conditions
[23] and stored in liquid nitrogen. In preparation for cell
culture, viably frozen PBMCs from Ple-1027 were thawed
at 37°C, washed twice in LBT media (RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen Life Sciences, Carlsbad, Calif.) containing 20% fetal
bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, Ga.), 1%
Glutamax I, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential
amino acids, 5 × 10-5 M β-2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U of
penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, (all from Invitrogen Life Sciences), and 9 g of glucose (Sigma)/liter), and
resuspended at a final concentration of 1–1.5 × 106 cells/
ml in LBT + interleukin-2 at 100 U/ml (Invitrogen Life Sciences).

Domestic cat Mya-1 naïve feeder cells [55] were prepared
for co-culture by cultivation in LBT + IL-2, plated in MEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin,
100 ug of streptomycin/ml, and 1% glutamax, and dispensed at 2 × 10^6 cells/ml in appropriate media in a 24
well plate. Reconstituted lion PBMCs were then added to
Mya-1 cells at a volume of 400 ul (4–6 × 105 cells).
Media was collected biweekly and subjected to microtiter
reverse transcriptase assay as follows. Briefly, 15 μl of culture supernatant in triplicate was incubated with 50 μl of

0.05 M Tris (pH 7.8) with 75 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5
mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 5 nM oligo(dT), 0.05%
NP-40, poly(A) at 50 μg/ml, and 32P at 20 μCi/ml for 90
to 120 minutes at 37°C. Aliquots of 2.5 μl of each reaction mixture were spotted onto a nylon filter (Wallac,
Turku, Finland) and allowed to dry. Un-incorporated
label was washed away with five 10 to 60 minute washes
with 0.03 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0, in 0.3 M sodium chloride (SSC) buffer, and the membrane was then fixed in
100% ethanol. Counts per minute were measured using a
Microbeta Counter (Wallac).
Starting on day 34 post co-culture, supernatant from lion
PBMC cocultures with Mya-1 cells had reverse transcriptase (RT) values approximately 3 to 10 times naïve
supernatant levels, indicating productive lentiviral replication. RT activity was not detected in any other control
supernatants through 49 days of culture.
RNA was extracted from 200 μl of supernatant from positive cultures using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN)
and reversed transcribed to cDNA with Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR
was then performed to amplify a diagnostic region of pol
as previously described [4]. Amplicons were sequenced to
confirm the presence of a Botswana strain of FIV (FIVPle
subtype E). One ml aliquots of supernatant were frozen at
-70°C. Aliquots were then thawed and used to inoculate
3 × 106 Mya-1 cells, which were grown 14 days to achieve
positive RT values as above. Cells were supplemented with
fresh media weekly and grown to 1 × 107 cells at which
point cells were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets were frozen at -70°C.
Cell Culture of FIVPle Subtype B: Serengeti lion Ple-458
Isolation and culture methods for FIVPle Subtype B are
similar to the methods described for Subtype E (above)
with the following exceptions. FIVPle Subtype B was isolated from PBMCs from a wild, sero-positive lion (Ple458, Serengeti National Park), separated from
heparinized whole blood by sucrose gradient centrifugation using Histopaque (Sigma). Cells were mixed with
10% DMSO with 90% fetal calf serum and viably frozen
in nitrogen vapor in aliquots of ~106 cells per ml. Postfreezing, thawed PBMCs (106 cells) from the wild lion
were co-cultivated with an equal number of lion donor
cells (Ple-73, captive, National Zoological Park, Wash.,
D.C.; this lion was sero-positive but had repeatedly tested
negative for virus isolation). All PBMCs were mitogen
stimulated with concanavalin A (5 ug/ml) for 72 hrs. Cocultures were propagated in RPMI 1640 with 10% bovine
serum and 10% human interleukin-2 (Gibco-BRL). Fresh
media was added every 72 hours and new donor cells (106
cells) were added every 14 days. Replicating virus was confirmed in the supernatant by demonstrating both positive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/66

Mg2+ – dependent reverse transcriptase (RT) and the presence of typical lentiviral particles seen by electron microscopy [10]. Virus rich supernatants were clarified by slow
speed centrifugation and stored in liquid nitrogen freezers.
In order to expand the culture sufficiently to harvest viral
supernatant for Western blot assays and to conduct the
genetic analysis, 1 ml RT positive supernatant (LLV-2, SV
lab) was used to inoculate 3201 cells (5 ml at 2 × 106/ml),
FeLV negative lymphosarcoma cells [56]. Cells were maintained in equal parts Leibovitz's L-15 media and RPMI
1640 with 20% fetal calf serum with glutamine (2x) and
penicillin/streptomycin (1x). Initially, this culture was
difficult to maintain in 3201 cells because it caused rapid
cell death thus, in order to keep the culture alive, fresh
media and naive 3201 cells had to be added every 3–4
days. After 21 days post infection (dPI), fresh media continued to be added to the culture every 3–4 days, but the
addition of naïve 3201 cells was stopped and the % viability was allowed to decline (in the hope that a cell adapted
virus could emerge that would enhance our ability to grow
up viral stocks for use in Western blot assays). From dPI
28 to 49 the culture viability hovered between 18–24%,
but after dPI 52 it was clear that both the viability and cell
numbers began to improve (viability from 46 to 86%). By
dPI 71 the cell viability was holding at >90% and the culture was growing at 40–50% per day. Infected cells for
DNA extraction and genetic analysis of subtype B virus
were harvested on dPI 88, centrifuged, and the pellets frozen at -70C.
DNA extraction, Cloning and Sequencing of
FIVPleSubtypes B and E
DNA was extracted and purified from frozen cell culture
pellets following the manufacturer's protocols established
for blood products (Quiagen). Following extraction, DNA
quality was checked by gel electrophoresis, and quantified
by spectrophotometer (NanoDrop).

FIVPle proviral DNA was amplified using long PCR to generate overlapping proviral genome regions of approximately 5 kb (Roche's Expand PCR kit). For FIVPle subtype
B, three over-lapping regions were amplified using the followoing primer pairs: FSHltr2F and FIVpol6R (LTR-pol);
FIVgag2aF and FIVpol5R (gag-pol); and FIVpol5F and
FIVltr4R (pol-LTR) (see Additional file 2). For subtype E,
two over-lapping regions were amplified using the two
primer pairs FSHltr2F and FIVpol5R (LTR-pol), and
FIVgag2aF and FIVltr4R (gag-LTR) (see Additional file 2).
PCR reactions used 0.2–2.0 ug DNA with the following
thermocycling conditions: 94°C for 2 minutes; ten cycles
of 94°C for 10 seconds, 52°C for 30 seconds and 68°C
for 4 minutes; 25 cycles of 94°C for 10 seconds, 52°C for
30 seconds and 68°C for 4 minutes and 20 seconds, with

each having an extension time 20 seconds longer than the
one before it; followed by 68°C for 7 minutes and 4°C
hold. Additional "internal" primers were developed to fill
in sequence gaps within each subtype (see Additional file
2) using the same PCR conditions listed above. Biometra
T1 thermocyclers were used for all PCR reactions and
amplicons were visualized on a 1% agarose gel.
The PCR products were cloned using TOPO TA XL cloning
kits (Invitrogen). The resultant colonies were grown on LB
agar plates with kanamycin and mini-prepped using Qiagen's REAL Prep 96. A restriction digest with EcoRI was
performed to confirm successful cloning. The ends of the
inserted PCR product were sequenced using the primers
provided with the cloning kit for additional verification of
FIVPle cloned products.
The final full-length sequence for each over-lapping long
PCR product generated for each FIVPle subtype was
obtained using transposon bombing [GPS-1 kit (New
England BioLabs)]. In this method, transposons were randomly inserted into one of the successfully transformed
plasmids for each primer combination for each sample.
The results were used to transform OneShot Chemically
Competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen) and grown on LB agar
plates with kanamycin and chloramphenicol and were
mini-prepped for DNA extraction using REAL Prep 96
(Quiagen). Restriction digest with EcoRI was performed
to confirm successful insertion of the transposon. Using
sequencing primers provided in the GPS-1 kit, 48 transposon fragments/PCR reaction were sequenced using an
automated sequencer model ABI 3730.
Sequences (average read was approximately 600 bp) randomly generated by transposon bombing of individual
clones defined multiple overlapping regions and were
assembled into the full-length viral genome using
Sequencher version 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation) and
submitted to GenBank [accession number EU117991
(Subtype B) and EU117992 (Subtype E)].
Genetic and Phylogenetic Analyses of FIVPleSubtypes B and
E
Gene annotation of gag, pol, env, orfA, vif and rev from
open reading frames in lion subtypes B and E used translation into amino acids and comparison with existing fulllength FIV strains. The following sequences were used
from GenBank: for FIVPco Subtype B in pumas strain PLV1695 accession number DQ192583[27]; for FIVPco Subtype A in pumas strain PLV-14 accession number
U03982[14]; for FIVOma in Pallas cat accession number
AY713445[16]; for FIVFca subtype C in domestic cat strain
C36 accession number AY600517[24]; for FIVFca subtype
B, strain usil2489, accession number U11820; for FIVFca
[57]; Subtype A, strain PPR accession number M36968

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/66

and
strain
Petaluma
accession
number
M25381[15,25,58]. Open reading frames were determined and regions of homology between FIVPle with other
FIV strains using pair-wise comparisons implemented by
BLAST of two sequences [59]. The boundaries of both the
5'LTR and 3'LTR regions were identified by the conserved
polypurine tract (PPT) shared by all FIV [60] and the
primer binding site (PBS) which mark the boundary
between the 3'LTR and the 5'LTR, respectively.
The genome of lion FIVPle was compared with existing fulllength FIV by multiple sequence alignments of each viral
gene. LTR regions were aligned using Clustal X [61] and
verified and edited by eye using Se-Al ver 2.0 [62]. Due to
large genetic divergence between FIV from different species, alignment for coding regions of FIV used the program
REVTRANS ver 1.4 [29] which takes a multiple sequence
file, translates that file into amino acid residues, aligns the
amino acids, and uses this alignment as the scaffold for
nucleotide alignment. Aligned multiple sequence files
were imported into Modeltest ver 3.7 [63] and the optimal model of nucleotide substitution was selected using
the AIC criterion (see Additional file 3).
Viral genes were analyzed separately, as well as combined,
for genome comparison and phylogenetic reconstruction.
Phylogenetic trees based on nucleotide data were
obtained using a heuristic search with three different optimality criteria of maximum likelihood (ML), minimum
evolution (ME) and maximum parsimony (MP) as implemented in PAUP* ver 4.0b10 [64]. Conditions for the ML
analysis included starting trees obtained by stepwise addition, and branch swapping using the tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) algorithm. Specific conditions for the ME
search included starting trees obtained by neighbor – joining, TBR branch-swapping algorithm, and no collapsing
of zero-length branches. The MP analyses coded gaps as
"missing", with step-wise addition of taxa and TBR branch
swapping. Support for nodes within the phylogeny used
bootstrap analysis with identical settings established for
each method of phylogenetic reconstruction and retention of node bootstrap values greater than 50%. The
number of bootstrap iterations consisted of 1000 for ME
and MP methods and 100 for ML. Additional analyses
were conducted on FIV coding sequences after translation
into amino acids. Genetic distances between strains were
derived using the Pam-Dayhoff model of amino acid substitution as implemented in MEGA verson 3.1 [65] with
gamma-correction (alpha = 2.5) and pairwise deletion of
missing data.
