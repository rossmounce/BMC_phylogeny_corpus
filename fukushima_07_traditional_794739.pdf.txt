Abstract
Background: Most of the haloarchaeal strains have been isolated from hypersaline environments
such as solar evaporation ponds, salt lakes, or salt deposits, and they, with some exceptions, lyse
or lose viability in very low-salt concentrations. There are no salty environments suitable for the
growth of haloarchaea in Japan. Although Natrialba asiatica and Haloarcula japonica were isolated
many years ago, the question, "Are haloarchaea really thriving in natural environments of Japan?"
has remained unanswered.
Results: Ten strains were isolated from a traditional Japanese-style salt field at Nie, Noto
Peninsula, Japan by plating out the soil samples directly on agar plates containing 30% (w/v) salts
and 0.5% yeast extract. They were most closely related to strains of three genera, Haladaptatus,
Halococcus, and Halogeometricum. Survival rates in 3% and 0.5% SW (Salt Water, solutions
containing salts in approximately the same proportions as found in seawater) solutions at 37°C
differed considerably depending on the strains. Two strains belonging to Halogeometricum as well
as the type strain Hgm. borinquense died and lysed immediately after suspension. Five strains that
belonged to Halococcus and a strain that may be a member of Halogeometricum survived for 1–2
days in 0.5% SW solution. Two strains most closely related to Haladaptatus possessed
extraordinary strong tolerance to low salt conditions. About 20 to 34% of the cells remained viable
in 0.5% SW after 9 days incubation.
Conclusion: In this study we have demonstrated that haloarchaea are really thriving in the soil of
Japanese-style salt field. The haloarchaeal cells, particularly the fragile strains are suggested to
survive in the micropores of smaller size silt fraction, one of the components of soil. The inside of
the silt particles is filled with concentrated salt solution and kept intact even upon suspension in
rainwater. Possible origins of the haloarchaea isolated in this study are discussed.

Background
Salt, sodium chloride, has played a predominant role in
human history. Hypersaline lakes and salt deposits have

been natural resources of salt. People in hot and arid areas
have also developed procedures to extract the salt from
seawater using solar salterns. Seawater is concentrated

gradually during flowing through increasingly concentrated pools until to crystallizer ponds. Japan is surrounded by sea, but there are no solar evaporation ponds,
no salt lakes, or salt deposits. Japanese people have satisfied the need for salt by extracting salt from sea water
using special methods through historic period until 1958
[1]. Since then, industrial salt production has been performed by concentrating sodium and chloride ions from
seawater using the ion-exchange membrane electro-dialysis method, followed by boiling down of sodium chloride
with vacuum evaporation apparatus (see the homepage of
The Salt Industry Center of Japan [2]). Japan is still one of
the largest importers of solar salt, mostly used in soda
industry.
Haloarchaea, halophilic aerobic archaea, inhabit the
hypersaline environments distributed throughout the
world [3,4]. It was long thought that haloarchaea were not
living in natural environments in Japan. As of January 17,
2007, 79 species have been validly published in the family
Halobacteriaceae. In general, haloarchaeal strains require
high salt concentration for growth and cell integrity. They,
with some exceptions, lyse or lose viability in low-salt
concentrations or distilled water, and water sensitivity or
lysis-resistence has been a key differentiation criterion
between halococci and other haloarchaea [5]. The most
well known haloarchaea Halobacterium salinarum, for
example, requires at least 2.5 M NaCl for growth and cells
lose their morphological integrity instantaneously at less
than 1 M NaCl [6]. Another representative, Halococcus
morrhuae does not lyse in distilled water [5].
The first report on the isolation of haloarchaea in Japan
appeared in 1980. A non-pigmented extreme halophile,
strain 172, was isolated by enrichment culture of a sand
sample with salt attached, collected on seashore in Japan
[7,8]. This halophile was later designated as Natrialba asiatica [9]. The cells lysed in distilled water as in the case of
most other haloarchaea.
In October 1985, scientists Horikoshi and Grant visited a
salt field at Nie (Fig. 1) located on the coast of the Sea of
Japan 3 km east of Sosogi of Noto Peninsula (see Fig. 2).
They collected five soil samples from the salt field, and
isolated seven strains on agar plates of a complex medium
containing 4 M NaCl. Only one strain was shown to be
extremely halophilic requiring at least 15% NaCl for
growth [10]. It was reported that the cells of strain TR-1,
designated as Haloarcula japonica [11], lysed upon suspension in 5% NaCl solution [12]. Although exact figures are
not available for the Nie area, the statistics by Japan Meteorological Agency tell us that annual rainfall of Wajima
City, only 22 kilometers west of Nie salt field, ranged from
1976 to 2560 mm during the last five years (2002–2006)
with a mean of 2200 mm, compared to 1295 to1854 mm

of Tokyo. It is known that the west coast of Australia,
where solar salterns are operated, is arid with annual rainfall less than 300 mm (Bureau of Meteorology of Australian Government). In rainy season, the soil layer is
sometimes flooded with heavy rainfall. Since 1986, however, no reports were published on the isolation of other
haloarchaeal strains from natural environment in Japan.
The question "Are haloarchaea really thriving in regions of
Japan?" has not been answered yet.
The present study was designed in 2005, 19 years after the
report by Horikoshi and Grant [12]. In this paper, the
authors collected soil samples from the same salt field,
and found that all soil samples taken from inside of the
field contained haloarchaeal cells. We isolated 10 strains,
analyzed their phylogenetic positions, and characterized
their survival rates at low salt concentrations.

Results
Isolation of haloarchaea, growth patterns and Gram
staining
We plated out each sample directly onto 30% SW agar
plates containing 30% salts and 0.5% yeast extract, spread
the soil particles evenly on the surface of the plate with a
spatula, and incubated at 37°C. After 8 days, many pink
colonies appeared around soil particles on plates of sample No.7 and No.12 (Fig. 3A) and a few colonies on plate
of No.11 (Fig. 3B). Further incubation up to 30 days
resulted in formation of pink to red colonies on plates of
all soil samples, at least a few per plate, that were taken
inside of the field. Sample No.12 gave extraordinarily
high numbers of colonies and most colonies seem not
associated with black soil particles visible with naked
eyes. A few white to beige colonies appeared on sand sample No.5 taken at seashore. No colonies appeared from
three seawater samples. After repeated transfers on fresh
medium, 10 strains were isolated and subjected to the following characterizations.

The 10 strains were cultivated in 25% SW liquid medium,
and their growth patterns were observed at 37°C. Strains
10-1 and 14-1 grew very slowly, only after 2–3 days lag
periods. On the other hand, strains 7-1, 7-2, 11-1, and 142 grew fast, with slight growth even after overnight culture. The final cell densities of the strain 7-1 and 7-2, however, were low, about one fifth of those of other 8 strains.
The 10 strains were pre-cultured in 25% SW liquid
medium and streaked on agar plates of 25, 3, and 0.5%
SW agar media, and incubated at 37°C for 10 days. No
growth was observed on 3 and 0.5% SW agar plates.
Gram staining was done on stationary cells grown in 25%
SW liquid medium. Strains 7-1, 7-2, 10-1, 10-2, and 11-2
stained negative, while strains 11-1, 13, 14-1, 14-2 were

cells of the strain 12 stained gram positive.

SW solution for 9 days. Survival rates in 3% and 0.5% SW,
however, varied considerably depending on the strains.

Phylogenetic analysis
The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strains 7-1, 7-2, and 12
showed highest similarities to that of Halogeometricum
borinquense, 97.1, 97.0, and 94.6%, respectively. The
sequences of strains 10-1, 10-2, 11-2, 13, and 14-1 were
very close to that of Halococcus hamelinensis with 98.9–
99.5% similarities. Strains 11-1 and 14-2 were most
closely related to Haladaptatus paucihalophilus, with similarities of 97.5 and 97.6%, respectively. A phylogenetic
tree reproduced by neighbor-joining method is shown in
figure 4. We are in the process of fully characterizing these
strains.

Two strains 7-1 and 7-2 died instantaneously upon suspension in 3% and 0.5% SW solutions, and the cells lysed
leaving transparent solutions. Two reference strains, Halogeometricum borinquense JCM 10706T and Halococcus morrhuae JCM 8876T (= ATCC 17082T) also died instantly
even in 3% SW solution. The cells of Hgm. borinquense
lysed in 3 and 0.5% SW solutions, but the cell suspension
of Hcc. morrhuae remained turbid (although red pigments
had faded away), with even higher turbidity compared to
the cell suspension in 30% SW. Microscopic observation
of Hcc. morrhuae confirmed that the cells remained coccoid in 0.5% SW solution.

Survival rates in low salt solutions
In order to observe if the strains isolated from the salt field
are tolerant to hypotonic solutions, three pellets of each
strain cultivated in 25% SW liquid medium were suspended in sterile 30%, 3%, and 0.5% SW solutions,
respectively, incubated at 37°C, and surviving cell numbers were measured every day. As shown in Fig. 5, at least
50% of the cells of all strains maintained viability in 30%

Viable cell numbers of strains 10-2 and 11-2 in 3% SW
decreased to one tenth after 5 days, and cells died in 0.5%
SW within a day. Strains 10-1, 12, 13, and 14-1 were
slightly more resistant to 0.5% SW and maintained viabilities to some extents in 3% SW up to 9 days. The cell suspension of these strains in 3% and 0.5% SW remained
turbid as in the case of Hcc. morrhuae, as was confirmed by
microscopic observation.

Figure rates of the 10 strains in SW solutions
Survival 5
Survival rates of the 10 strains in SW solutions. The cells were suspended in the SW solutions containing 30% (●), 3%
(❍), and 0.5% (▲) salts, kept at 37°C, and viable cell numbers were counted every day. X-axis refers to days, and Y-axis refers
to viable cell numbers. Note that the initial cell numbers vary depending on the strains.

Strains 11-1 and 14-2 possessed extraordinary strong tolerance to low salt conditions. About 20 and 34% of the
cells, respectively, remained viable in 0.5% SW after 9
days incubation at 37°C. These cell suspensions again
remained turbid, and no morphological change such as
cell aggregation was observed.

Discussion
A question raised by the isolation of N. asiatica and H.
japonica in Japan
Natrialba asiatica 172, a non-pigmented extreme halophile, was isolated from sands on seashore [7]. At that
time, and even nowadays, most scientists involved in
research on extreme halophiles had tacit agreement that
haloarchaea live only in highly saline environments and
cells lyse instantaneously upon exposure to hypotonic

solution in nature. In fact, scientists used to extract the
purple membrane from Halobacterium salinarum or other
haloarchaea by simply suspending cell pellets in distilled
water or by dialyzing cell suspension against distilled
water [13]. The cells of the strain 172 did lyse in distilled
water. To our regret, the student who collected the sand
sample did not record the sampling site, thus trials to isolate similar strains, and experiments on how many haloarchaeal cells were living there, and how the cells survived
attack by rainfall were not possible. A red pigmented
Haloarcula japonica TR-1 isolated from a soil sample of the
salt field of Nie [10,14] was reported to lyse upon suspension in 5% NaCl solution [12]. A question that was raised
naturally was "How did they survive in the soil of salt field
that is attacked by heavy rainfall in summer and snowfall
in winter?"

Suggested presence of haloarchaea in low salinity
environments
For many years, analyses of environmental DNA samples
have suggested the presence of haloarchaea in non-saline
environments. Jurgens et al. [15] amplified 16S rRNA
genes from DNA extracted from Finnish forest soil, and
detected sequences very closely related to that of Halobacterium salinarum (X96686, X96687). Diverse 16S rRNA
gene sequences related to many genera of Halobacteriaceae were recovered from tidal marine and salt marsh
sediments [16]. Rölleke et al. isolated DNA fragments
encoding a gene of Halobacterium spp. from a biodegraded
wall painting of 13th century in Austria [17]. More
recently, the same group detected clones of 16S rRNA
genes closely related to those of Halococcus morrhuae,
Natronobacterium innermongoliae etc. [18]. It has been
argued that weathering of stone and masonry results from
physical, chemical, and biological processes, and practically all porous building materials subjected to rainwater
and rising damp contain soluble salts, dispersed within
the porous materials or locally concentrated. This results
in the formation of deposits of crystallized salts, which
may support growth of haloarchaea. The authors of the
present paper believe that there may be a possibility that
haloarchaeal cells have been carried to the deteriorated
wall painting by either wind or feathers of waterfowls
from salt lakes and salterns, for example those of southern
Spain or Tunisia. The cells themselves may lyse and die,
but their DNA molecules may remain within the porous
materials for many years.
Halobacterial strains recently isolated from low-salt
environments
The design of this study was triggered by the following
two interesting papers published in 2004. One paper was
on isolation of haloarchaea from sediment samples of
Colne salt marshes (Essex, UK) with pore-water of 3.2%
salinity [19]. Another paper was on haloarchaea from
microbial mats of the sulfide- and sulfur-rich Zodletone
Spring (Oklahoma, USA) with a stream water salinity of
0.7 to 1.0% [20]. An isolate M6 was designated as Haloferax sulfurifontis, but strangely enough, the cells lysed
within 24 hours in 1% NaCl [21]. These two papers stated
that "a diverse community of haloarchaea exists in coastal
salt marsh sediments" [19], and that "members of the
Halobacteriales are not restricted to their typical high-salt
habitats" [20]. Quite recently, a novel haloarchaea, Haladaptatus paucihalophilus was isolated from the Zodletone
Spring, but from different part of the spring [22].
Relatives of the Nie strains
In this study we have demonstrated that considerably
high numbers of haloarchaea are thriving in the salt field,
although further investigations on the diversity and seasonal fluctuation, etc. are needed. Phylogenetic analysis of

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/3/1/2

the 10 strains showed that they were accommodated into
3 groups.
Strains 11-1 and 14-2, most closely related to Haladaptatus
paucihalophilus, were extraordinary in their very strong tolerance of low salt conditions. Interestingly enough, pinkpigmented cells of H. paucihalophilus DX253T isolated
from soil samples of the Zodletone Spring mentioned
above, remained viable in distilled water for up to 2
weeks, although quantitative survival rate was not shown
[22]. Another strain W1 isolated from the Wareham salt
marsh, Norfolk [19] is also closely related to H. paucihalophilus. This strain also did not lyse and remained viable in
distilled water [23] (quantitative data not presented), and
showed growth in an artificial seawater medium containing from 3.5% up to only 12% NaCl [23]. Strain 11-1,
strain 14-2, and H. paucihalophilus gave good growth in
media containing 23% or higher NaCl concentration, suggesting they constitute different species in the genus Haladaptatus.
Viabilities of strains 10-1, 10-2, 11-2, 13, and 14-1 in 3%
SW decreased gradually, and cells suspended in 0.5% SW
died more rapidly. The closest relative of these 5 strains
Halococcus hamelinensis was isolated from stromatolites
collected in Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Western Australia
[24]. The salinity of the surface water in Hamelin Pool was
twice that of normal seawater. It has been recognized that
cells of Halococcus spp. are resistant to lysis in hypotonic
solutions. The cells of type strain of Halococcus morrhuae,
JCM 8876T, did not show morphological changes, but lost
viabilities instantaneously upon suspension in 0.5 or 3%
SW.
Strains 7-1 and 7-2 were most closely related to Halogeometricum borinquense ATCC 700274T = JCM 10706T isolated from a solar saltern of Puerto Rico. Although no
description is given on the viability in hypotonic solution
of the type strain, it requires at least 8% NaCl to grow [25].
Strains 5Sa3 and PalaeII were isolated from Maras saltern
in Peruvian Andes [26] and the Crete Island, Greece,
respectively, but their characterizations have not been
published. Strain 12 that stained Gram positive, the only
exception in the 10 strains, with the highest similarity to
Halogeometricum borinquense (94.6%) may represent a
novel taxon.
Although a few white to beige colonies appeared on sand
sample No.5 taken at seashore, we believe they were those
of halophilic strains of the family Bacillaceae as were isolated by Echigo et al. [27] from ordinary field soil samples
and seashore sand samples.

How do they survive in the salt field soil when attacked by
heavy rainfall?
It is easy to assume that strains 11-1 and 14-2 are able to
survive attacks by rainfall even if they are living as free
cells, but how do strains 7-1 and 7-2 survive? Soil is made
up of three components: solid particles, air, and water.
The particles are classified by size as clay (less than 2 μm),
silt (4 to 63 μm), sand (0.063 to 2 μm), gravel (2 to 64
mm), etc. Studies on field soil have demonstrated that cell
numbers and microbial biomass were most concentrated
in the smaller size silt and clay fractions, and microbial
biomass is also mainly present in micropores (5 to 30
μm) [28]. A schematic illustration of soil particle is given
in [29]. The numerous numbers of pink to red colonies
observed on agar plate of sample No.12 (Fig. 3A) may be
explained by assuming that the sample is composed of
many numbers of silt particles hardly visible when covered with colonies originating from a few cells inside. It
may be reasonable to speculate that the fragile strains 7-1
and 7-2 are surviving in the micropores of smaller size silt
fractions, the inside of which is filled with concentrated
salt solution and kept intact even upon suspension in
rainwater. It is well known that methanogenic archaeal
strains are strict anaerobes, and they die immediately
when the colonies on agar slopes are exposed to air. The
methanogens, however, survive in a paddy field soil samples broken mechanically and passed through stainless
steel sieves of 100 μm mesh size. Once the soil particles,
dried in air for several months were put into anoxic distilled water, initiation of methane production was
observed [30]. This fact suggests that soil particles as small
as 100 μm serve as good habitat for the fastidious
microbes, including haloarchaea.
Where did the Nie haloarchaea come from?
A frequent question concerns the source of the haloarchaea in solar salterns, man-made hypersaline environments. A Spanish group has reported that coccoid extreme
halophiles were isolated from Mediterranean seawater
samples collected 5 km offshore from Alicante where salterns have been operated [31]. A representative isolate survived in seawater for at least a month at room
temperature. The authors [31] pointed out a possibility
that the haloarchaea originated from the salterns. Another
paper, however reported that Halococcus representatives
were present in seawater samples in area where salterns or
other hypersaline habits were not available [32]. In this
context, it should be pointed out that many multi-pond
solar salterns are operated commercially in the west and
south-west coast of Korea confronting Yellow Sea, from
which many halophilic bacteria have been isolated (for
example, see [33]). Although the distance from the west
coast of Korea to Noto Peninsula is more than 1000 km,
a surface oceanic current, Tsushima Current, is running
along the west coast of Japan. The Current is the north-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/3/1/2

eastward-flowing branch of the Kuroshio (Japan Current)
entering the Sea of Japan through the Tsushima-Korea
Strait. Recent studies by tracking the tracer particles placed
on estuary of west coast of Korea demonstrated that a
number of the particles passed through the Strait and
spread through the Sea of Japan in months (Tetsuo Yanagi, Kyushu University, Japan [34]). It may be speculated
that some haloarchaea similar to the strains 11-1, 14-2
isolated in this study migrate from the solar salterns on
the west coast of Korea, their original habitat, to the coast
of Nie. The salt field at Nie has been operated for 400
years, and a huge volume of seawater has been sprayed
over the soil. A similar but more difficult question has
long been raised, "Where did the haloarchaea of the Dead
Sea or the Great Salt Lake, for instance, come from?" The
Lisan Lake, the precursor of the Dead Sea, existed between
70,000 and 15,000 years ago [35,36], very young in a geological and microbial evolution scale.
Echigo et al. [27] reported that many endospore-forming
halophilic bacteria that were able to grow in the presence
of 20% NaCl were inhabiting non-saline environments
such as ordinary garden soils, yards, fields, and roadways
in the area surrounding Tokyo. They discussed that those
halophilic bacteria have been kept transported by Asian
dust storm to Japan for thousands of years from the indigenous highly saline environments, such as salt lakes and
the surrounding saline soils in Inner Mongolia, China.
Why didn't they detect any haloarchaea or other halophilic bacteria of other families? Echigo speculated that
cells of these halophiles would die sooner or later after
they arrived at non-saline environments because of the
hypotonic conditions caused by rainfall [27]. The authors
of the present paper believe that there is a possibility that
haloarchaeal cells trapped inside of silt particles, rather
than as naked cells, are transported by the Asian dust
storm and arrive at the Nie salt field, although in fairly low
frequencies, and have survived and grown somehow in
the soil particles. Attempts to trap haloarchaea from Asian
dust are needed, as well as model experiments to investigate the fate of the individual fragile strains isolated in this
study.

Methods
Outline of the salt field
The salt field at Nie of Noto Peninsula, Ishikawa Prefecture (Fig. 1 &2) was built in 1596. This is the only remnant
of traditional salt fields that prospered throughout Japan
until 60 years ago, and was registered as an Intangible
Folk Cultural Property of Ishikawa Prefecture in 1992. A
terrace of 13 m × 25 m was made by flattening the ground
and hardening the base with clay of 15–20 cm thick. The
terrace was located about 14 meters away from the beach
of the Sea of Japan and about 3.5 meters above the sea
level. In the morning of a hot and windy day in summer

Saline Systems 2007, 3:2

(from May to September), the terrace is covered manually
with a layer of soil, with a thickness of 1.5 to 2 cm. Average diameter of soil particles is roughly 0.3 mm. About
450 liters of seawater carried in buckets from the Sea of
Japan is sprayed over the layer of soil. By leaving for several hours with occasional mixing of the soil with a rake,
water evaporates by sunlight and high wind, leaving soil
granules incrusted with salts. The soil is then collected
with a special rake to a wooden extractor well, into which
seawater is poured to dissolve the incrusting salts. Seawater contains about 3.5% (by weight) dissolved minerals:
2.7% sodium chloride and 0.8% calcium, magnesium and
sulfate ions (Salt Institute [37]). A concentrated salt solution (more than four times concentrated than seawater)
drained from the bottom of the extractor well is put into
a shallow pan and boiled by heating to obtain crystals of
sodium chloride (see the homepage of The Salt Industry
Center of Japan [2]). The soil in the concentrator is recovered and used repeatedly.
The salt concentration of aqueous part of the salt field,
thus, fluctuates within a day from 3.5% of seawater to saturation just before water is evaporated completely. The
concentration decreases to almost zero when attacked by
heavy rainfall. A video of the actual field labor in the field
is available [38] (the talks are in Japanese).
Collection of samples and isolation of haloarchaeal strains
We visited the salt field on November 17th, 2005. At this
season, the field was out of work, and most of the soil was
already gathered to the center of the field and covered
with a plastic sheet to prevent run-out by rain and snow
fall during winter time. First of all, as controls, three samples (No. 1–3) of seawater left on hollows of rocks a few
meters away from beach, and three sand samples (No. 4–
6) of seashore were taken directly into sterile screwcapped 2 ml tubes. Eight soil samples (No. 7–14) were
collected from different spots inside of the salt field. All
samples were kept at 5°C until used.

The agar plates for the isolation of haloarchaea were prepared as follows; 2.0 g yeast extract (Difco) was dissolved
in 4 ml of water in 500 ml medium bottle, 396 ml of 30%
SW (Salt Water, prepared separately) and 8 g of Bacto agar
(Difco) added, boiled for 15 to 20 min to melt the agar as
completely as possible, and autoclaved. The composition
of the 30% SW was as follows (per liter); 0.8 g NaBr, 0.2 g
NaHCO3, 6.0 g KCl, 59.4 g MgSO4·7H2O, 41.5 g
MgCl2·6H2O, 234 g NaCl, and 1.45 g CaCl2·2H2O, pH
6.5 (not adjusted). The CaCl2·2H2O was dissolved in
small volume of water and added to the solution of all
other ingredients with continuous stirring, and filled up
to 1 liter. The proportions of salts are approximately the
same as found in seawater, but ten times more concentrated.

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/3/1/2

About 0.5 g of the soil or sand samples was taken with a
sterile micro-spatula and spread evenly on the agar plates
with the spatula, while three drops of sea water samples
were placed on agar plate and spread with a sterile
spreader. The plates were incubated at 37°C in a plastic
container to prevent desiccation. After incubation for 30
days, colonies separated enough from adjacent ones were
picked up randomly and purified by serial dilution and
plating out on fresh agar plates. Finally 10 strains, 7-1, 72, 10-1, 10-2, 11-1, 11-2, 12, 13, 14-1, and 14-2 were subjected to further characterization. The strains are now kept
on agar slopes at 5°C and at -20°C in L-dried ampoules.
Measurement of survival cell numbers in hypotonic
solutions
The 10 strains and 2 reference strains, Halogeometricum
borinquense JCM 10706T and Halococcus morrhuae JCM
8876T, were inoculated into 150 ml Erlenmeyer flasks
containing 20 ml of 25% SW medium, and shaken at
37°C for 9 days. Three aliquots of 1.5 ml of each culture
were centrifuged at 15,000 × g and supernatants were discarded. Each cell pellet was suspended gently in 1.0 ml of
30%, 3% and 0.5% sterile SW solution (for example, 3%
SW, approximately the same concentration as seawater,
was prepared by diluting the 30% SW tenfold with distilled water), respectively, with a micro tip and incubated
at 37°C for 9 days. Every day, 10 μl of each suspension
was taken and diluted 10-4 with SW solution of the same
concentration, and 20 μl aliquot was spread on agar plates
of 25% SW medium and incubated at 37°C. The agar
plates used every day were prepared a day before. The
numbers of colonies were counted after 1 to 3 weeks
depending on the strains (see Results).
PCR amplification of 16S rRNA encoding genes and
sequencing
16S rRNA encoding genes of the 10 isolates were amplified by PCR with the following forward and reverse primers: 5'-ATTCCGGTTGATCCTGCCGG (positions 6–25 in
E. coli numbering) and 5'-AGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCAG
(positions 1540-1521). DNA polymerase was Platinum
Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen). The PCR was done by 25
cycles, each of which consisted of denaturation for 20 s at
96°C, annealing for 15 s at 55°C, and polymerization for
2 min at 72°C. The amplified genes were cloned into
pCR2.1 T-vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using the Big
Dye Sequencing Kit Ver. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) by the
ABI 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing primers used were 5'-ATTCCGGTTGATCCTGCCGG
(positions 6–25 in E. coli numbering), 5'AGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCAG (positions 1540-1521), 5'ATTGGGCCTAAAGCGTCCGTA (positions 563–585), -20: 5'GGAAACAGCTATGACCATG (vector side's primer) and
Rev: 5'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT (vector side's primer).

Phylogenetic analysis
The 16S rRNA gene sequences of type strains of type species of all haloarchaeal genera that have been validly published (as of January 17, 2007) were obtained from DNA
Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). The sequences were aligned
by using CLUSTAL X Multiple Sequence Alignment Program. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by neighbor-joining method [39] and was evaluated by 1000
bootstrap samplings.
