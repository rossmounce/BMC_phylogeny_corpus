Abstract
Background: The highly aggressive pathogenic fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi continues to be a serious threat to
the American elm (Ulmus americana) in North America. Extensive studies have been conducted in North America
to understand the mechanisms of virulence of this introduced pathogen and its evolving population structure,
with a view to identifying potential strategies for the control of Dutch elm disease. As part of a larger study to
examine the genomes of economically important Ophiostoma spp. and the genetic basis of virulence, we have
constructed an expressed sequence tag (EST) library using total RNA extracted from the yeast-like growth phase of
O. novo-ulmi (isolate H327).
Results: A total of 4,386 readable EST sequences were annotated by determining their closest matches to known
or theoretical sequences in public databases by BLASTX analysis. Searches matched 2,093 sequences to entries
found in Genbank, including 1,761 matches with known proteins and 332 matches with unknown (hypothetical/
predicted) proteins. Known proteins included a collection of 880 unique transcripts which were categorized to
obtain a functional profile of the transcriptome and to evaluate physiological function. These assignments yielded
20 primary functional categories (FunCat), the largest including Metabolism (FunCat 01, 20.28% of total), Subcellular localization (70, 10.23%), Protein synthesis (12, 10.14%), Transcription (11, 8.27%), Biogenesis of cellular
components (42, 8.15%), Cellular transport, facilitation and routes (20, 6.08%), Classification unresolved (98, 5.80%),
Cell rescue, defence and virulence (32, 5.31%) and the unclassified category, or known sequences of unknown
metabolic function (99, 7.5%). A list of specific transcripts of interest was compiled to initiate an evaluation of their
impact upon strain virulence in subsequent studies.
Conclusions: This is the first large-scale study of the O. novo-ulmi transcriptome. The expression profile obtained
from the yeast-like growth phase of this species will facilitate a multigenic approach to gene expression studies
to assess their role in the determination of pathogenicity for this species. The identification and evaluation of
gene targets in such studies will be a prerequisite to the development of biological control strategies for this
pathogen.

Background
Throughout the twentieth century, the American elm
(Ulmus americana) has been a favoured urban tree for
planners and landscape architects in many North American cities, providing shade along innumerable streets
and boulevards. The elm is a particularly popular choice
in northern climates because of its resistance to
extremes of weather and harsh urban growing conditions, while its abundant crown foliage is large enough
to span a city street [1]. Unfortunately, populations of
this urban tree have been decimated by Dutch elm disease. The disease in North America can be attributed to
two separate introduction events: the early epidemic
caused by the non-aggressive sub-group O. ulmi and the
later, more severe epidemic, caused by the highly pathogenic aggressive sub-group of O. novo-ulmi, which continues to threaten elm populations of Western Canada.
Genomic fingerprinting methods are useful for resolving phylogenetic relationships among closely related
populations and species [2] and for the reconstruction
of population histories, especially for a species introduction, where there can be rapid population development
[3]. Isolates of O. novo-ulmi sampled across Saskatchewan and Manitoba were analyzed using both nuclear
and mitochondrial genetic markers and only limited
genetic variability was detected. All of the isolates represented the aggressive sub-group and included only two
distinct nuclear and four mitochondrial genotypes [4].
The vast majority of isolates were of a single genotype,
suggesting that one genetic individual dominated the
sample area. Later analysis in the same region compared
isolates collected in 1993 and 2002, using both RAPD
markers and an evaluation of vegetative compatibility
(vc) [5]. It was hypothesized that new vc types would
develop quickly after the disease front had passed
through the region [6,7]. Compatibility tests confirmed a
single vc group, demonstrating that a genetically uniform population persists in western Canada. In contrast,
a much greater diversity of vc types has been documented in the Eurasian aggressive (EAN) race of O. novoulmi, as compared to populations of the North American aggressive (NAN) race [6]; the EAN and NAN subpopulations of O. novo-ulmi have since been redesignated as subspecies novo-ulmi and americana,
respectively [8]. A low diversity of vc types for the americana subspecies appears to be concentrated in the
southern Great Lakes, which is consistent with its initial
detection in this region; areas colonized more recently,
including western Canada, display very limited vc diversity [6,8,9]. In areas of Europe experiencing a well established epidemic of subspecies novo-ulmi that was
initially characterized by a uniformity of vc types, vegetative incompatibilities have been reported within six to
ten years [9]. In contrast, the comparatively low diversity

Page 2 of 12

of vc groups observed for the subspecies americana is
atypical of an established pathogen epidemic, although
rapidly expanding pathogen populations have previously
been reported to exhibit low genetic diversity [10].
Factors influencing the development of vc groups and
increased genetic diversity in subspecies novo-ulmi must
therefore be significantly different from those encountered by subspecies americana. There is no clear explanation for the limited genetic variability observed in the
O. novo-ulmi subspecies americana population in western Canada. The report of only two nuclear genotypes,
and no transitional genotypes, suggests that sexual
events are rare and that its propagation has been predominantly by asexual means within the time frame of this
epidemic [4,5]. In a previous study of North America
populations of this species, two possible factors contributing to low vc diversity were suggested: the infrequent
occurrence of deleterious d-factor viruses in populations
provide a low level of selection for new vc types and the
frequent predominance of single vc clones on a host
substrate does not favour the establishment of novel vc
types [9]. The role of host genetic diversity has not been
evaluated to any extent in studies of Dutch elm disease
and it should be noted that surveys of elm populations
in western Canada have been conducted primarily in
urban environments and may thus have favoured
planted nursery stocks of this species. This may represent a more limited diversity compared to wild U. americana trees.
From a perspective of disease management, the
genetic uniformity of the subspecies americana population could be exploited as a target for the control of
Dutch elm disease in western Canada through the use
of fungal hypoviruses and related genetic tools to reduce
pathogen virulence [6]. The presence of double-stranded
RNA (dsRNA) viruses in isolates of O. novo-ulmi has
been well-documented [5,11,12] and may play a role in
strain fitness and the genetic diversity of the pathogen,
including the diversity of vc types [9,13,14]. Extensive
studies have been done to understand the mechanisms
of virus-determined hypovirulence observed in the causal agent of chestnut blight, Cryphonectria parasitica,
and to establish its utility as a method of disease control
for the North American tree species American chestnut
(Castanea dentata)[15-17]. Similarly, the introduced
ascomycete O. novo-ulmi has become a serious pathogen of a major tree species and represents a good candidate for virus-mediated control.
Until recently, there has been little work on profiling
gene expression in O. novo-ulmi. A study focused on
the transcriptome represents an opportunity for extensive gene discovery. The primary benefit of this
approach is the detection and assessment of genes
potentially implicated in pathogenicity and parasitic

fitness. Wound pathogens, such as O. novo-ulmi, directly
enter the host through a pre-existing wound. Ophiostoma novo-ulmi is a dimorphic fungus, alternating
between a budding yeast-like growth form and a filamentous growth form, and this morphology switch
appears to have great significance to pathogenicity [18].
The yeast phase has been proposed to be involved in
dissemination of the pathogen from tree to tree by the
insect vector as well as translocation of the infection
within the host tree [19]. The mycelial form is required
to penetrate from one vessel to another and may thus
be considered the invasive form [18]. The yeast - hyphal
transition is regulated by environmental factors and
occurs in the homokaryotic (haploid) state [19]. The cataloguing and functional categorization of a library of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the yeast form of
this fungus provides a means of identifying genes integral to the first stages of infection. A more complete
understanding of the genetic basis of pathogenicity
could provide targets for gene regulation, leading to
methods of disease control The recent demonstration of
targeted gene disruption in O. novo-ulmi by RNA interference [20], combined with knowledge about specific
target genes as detected by EST analysis, makes this
goal more readily achievable.
The Canadian Ophiostoma Genome Project was first
initiated in 2001 as a collaborative effort with the general
objective of the large-scale collection and analysis of genome data for species of this genus [21]. Longer-term studies will include the examination of specific genes that are
differentially expressed, especially those that relate to
mechanisms of pathogenicity in these species. The objectives of the current study were to (i) construct a lowredundancy EST library using total RNA extracted from
the yeast-like growth phase of isolate H327 of Ophiostoma
novo-ulmi, (ii) annotate the EST information by determining their closest matches to known or theoretical
sequences in public databases, and (iii) categorize the
known EST collection to obtain a functional profile of the
O. novo-ulmi genome, as expressed under these conditions
of growth. This work will eventually be assisted by the
construction of an EST microarray or RNA Seq analysis to
facilitate genome-level studies of gene expression.

Results
Sequencing of library and BLASTX analysis

Analysis of novel sequence data typically begins with the
assignment of putative identities based on alignments
with derived proteins in public databases [20]. Recent
genome sequencing projects have resulted in the deposition of hundreds of thousands of theoretical proteins,
predicted by analysis of sequenced genomes. Theoretical
proteins frequently match with novel ESTs at a high

Page 3 of 12

alignment score, but are of little consequence if they do
not assign function or identity to the EST. A protein of
known function or identity will provide more meaningful information, even at a lesser alignment score. While
automated alignment and annotation algorithms serve
to provide a good approximation of most EST identities,
manual scrutiny and annotation is necessary to improve
fidelity. With these constraints in mind, we began an
analysis of the expressed sequences of the Dutch elm
pathogen O. novo-ulmi.
The DNA sequence was determined for 5,760 clones
of a library that was estimated to contain a total of
22,000 clones. The proportion of unique sequences
identified in the entire yeast LMW library gradually
declined as sequencing progressed, but remained above
30% of all sequences read within the final 96-well cell
culture plate. This suggests that there still remains a sizable resource of unique O. novo-ulmi sequences in the
cDNA library.
Library data is summarized in Table 1. Of the 5,760
EST clones sequenced, 4,386 gave readable sequence
information (~ 76%) and included inserts ranging from
133 to 690 bp with an average insert size of 498 bp. A
total of 2,093 of the 4,386 readable sequences matched
entries described in NCBI and GenBank public databases, as determined by BLASTX analysis [22]. These
included 1,761 matches with known proteins and 332
matches with unknown (hypothetical/predicted) proteins. Matches with known proteins included 880
unique transcripts corresponding to 49.97% of the EST
sequences in this category. Applying this same ratio to
the category of unknown proteins would generate an
additional 166 unique transcripts among this group, for
a total of 1,046 single matched sequences.
A total of 2,293 of the 4,386 readable sequences drew
no matches by BLASTX analysis. It may be assumed
that 20% of these clones contained non-authentic
sequences, due to the ligation of random fragments of
DNA into vectors during the creation of the EST library,
thus reducing the total to 1,835 sequences without a
match. Based on the results for matched readable
sequences, it was estimated that approximately 50% of
unmatched EST sequences were unique, thus yielding
an additional 917 sequences that are at present unidentified. The total number of unique sequences from all
categories is therefore estimated to be 1,963 (880 known
proteins, 166 unknown proteins and 917 unmatched
sequences). Given that the O. novo-ulmi genome is estimated to contain 8,000 - 10,000 genes [23,24], the total
number of unique sequences in this library is estimated
to represent about 22% of this genome. Additional
sequencing of EST library clones will add further depth
to this analysis.

Functional assignment of ESTs

Functional assignment of expressed sequences requires a
consideration of the metabolic pathway in which a gene
product is likely to be active. In some instances, the presence of a characteristic functional group or structural
domain indicates the probable molecular mechanism of
a protein, but offers no insight into the physiological
function that protein serves [25,26]. While the specific
molecular mechanism of a specific protein may be
known, inferences regarding the physiological role of
similar proteins can be made based on their conservation of consensus sequences [25]. Sequences involved in
target-ligand interactions are often similar among
related proteins and provide a means of deducing their
putative physiological role by comparison with previously categorized proteins bearing similar consensus
sequences. The 880 matched unique transcripts were
selected as a subset of the 5,760 EST fragments and
subjected to further BLAST analysis to obtain the three
highest scoring alignments. These data were manually
scrutinized and each EST was manually annotated using
the FunCat system. A summary of results for the unique
transcripts is provided in Additional File 1.
Functional assignment of O. novo-ulmi yeast LMW ESTs
to primary categories

The assignment of the O. novo-ulmi Yeast LMW ESTs
with known identities (n = 880) into functionally related
groups yielded 20 primary functional categories (Table 2).
The unclassified category (99, 7.5% of total) represented
ESTs for which a protein identity could be assigned based
upon an alignment with known sequences, but the metabolic function of that sequence remained unknown. The
largest categories for the functional assignment of ESTs of
known function included (in order of decreasing importance) Metabolism (01, 20.28%), Protein synthesis (12,
10.14%), Sub-cellular localization (70, 10.23%), Biogenesis

917
1,963

of cellular components (42, 8.15%) and Transcription (11,
8.27%). Individual categories that represented less than
1.0% of total assignments included Protein fate (14,
0.85%), Protein activity regulation, (18, 0.82%), Cell cycle
and DNA processing (10, 0.7%), Transposable elements,
viral and plasmid proteins (38, 0.34%), Interaction with the
environment (36, 0.25%), Cell fate (40, 0.23%) and Cell
type differentiation (43, 0.11%).
Functional assignment of O. novo-ulmi yeast LMW ESTs
to subcategories

Each of the eight primary functional categories that
represented more than 4.5% of all identified ESTs were
categorized to the secondary level within each category
(Table 3). The subcategories represented in each group
exhibited a wide variation in both the number detected
and in the proportional distribution among these subcategories. FunCat 99 (Unclassified proteins, 7.5%) represented 66 standardized functional assignments of ESTs.
The FunCat 01 (Metabolism) was comprised of 178.5
standardized functional assignments of identified ESTs,
making it the most highly represented functional category. Within this primary category, eight subcategories
relating to metabolism were represented. Expressed
sequence tags associated with carbon compound metabolism (01.05) were the most highly represented, comprising 29.83% of FunCat 01. Enzymes implicated in the
metabolism of fatty acids (01.06) and amino acids
(01.01) were also highly represented, comprising 23.53%
and 19.61%, respectively, of these subcategories. The
functional assignment of ESTs associated with nucleotide metabolism (01.03) were also important (11.76%).
The remaining subcategories represented the metabolism of nitrogen and sulphur (01.02), phosphate (01.04),
vitamins, cofactors and prosthetic groups (01.07), and
secondary metabolism (01.20), each of which comprised
5.6% or less of all subcategories.

A total of 39.5 standardized functional assignments
and seven subcategories were represented within FunCat
02 (Energy), with the vast majority of ESTs occurring in
the respiration (02.13) category (60.38%), followed by
fermentation (02.16, 11.32%) and energy conversion and
regeneration (02.45, 10.69%). The TCA cycle (02.10) was
also well-represented (9.43%). Those subcategories exhibiting the least representation within FunCat 02
included ESTs classified within metabolism of energy
reserves (02.19, 5.03%), electron transport and membrane-associated energy conservation (02.11, 2.52%), and
the pentose-phosphate pathway (02.07, 0.63%).

Of the eight primary functional categories examined at
the secondary level, FunCat 11 (Transcription) exhibited
the least complexity, with 72.75 standardized functional
assignments of ESTs in three subcategories, primarily
RNA synthesis (11.02, 86.25%), RNA processing (11.04,
11.00%) and RNA modification (11.06, 2.75%).
The expression profile for FunCat 12 (Protein synthesis) had a similar distribution of functional assignments, with ribosome biogenesis representing the largest
subcategory (12.01, 77.31%), followed by translation
(12.04, 20.45%) and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (12.10,
2.24%), with a total of 89.25 standardized functional
assignments. Genes in the largest subcategory were
dominated by 40S and 60S ribosomal proteins.
The assignment of ESTs to subcategories within FunCat 20 (Cellular transport) included 53.5 standardized
functional assignments. This category was comprised of
three subcategories, two of which were highly represented, transport routes (20.09, 49.32%), transported
compounds (substrates) (20.01, 39.27%) and transport
facilitation (20.03, 11.42%).
Within FunCat 32 (Cell rescue, defence and virulence)
a total of 46.75 standardized functional assignments
were made in three subcategories. The assignment of
ESTs associated with stress response (32.01) and detoxification (32.07) were almost equally represented at
43.32% and 41.18%, respectively, followed by the subcategory of disease, virulence and defence (32.05, 15.51%).
Those ESTs associated with stress response were represented by inducible gene products sensitive to environmental stimuli, such as UV irradiation, desiccation and
heat shock.
The greatest number of subcategories was observed
for FunCat 42 (Biogenesis of cellular components). A
total of 71.75 standardized functional assignments were
distributed among ten subcategories. Those ESTs associated with cytoplasm biogenesis represented the largest
subcategory (42.03, 40.77%) and included a number of
chitin synthase (42.03) proteins, of importance to cell
wall biogenesis [27]. The cell wall subcategory was the
next largest group (42.01, 29.97%) and included genes
coding for beta-glucanase/beta-glucan synthetase
(42.01), stomatin, mucin, and cell wall surface anchor
family protein. Subcategories with fewer assignments
included mitochondrion (42.16, 9.76%) and cytoskeleton
(42.04, 7.67%) biogenesis. The six remaining subcategories, totalling 11.84%, included peroxisome (42.19,
3.83%), nucleus (42.10, 3.14%), vacuole or lysosome
(42.25, 1.74%), extracellular/secretion proteins (42.27,
1.39%), plasma membrane (42.02, 1.39%), and endoplasmic reticulum (42.07, 0.35%) biogenesis. In the peroxisome subcategory, the Woronin body major protein
(42.19) was identified and is known to be important to
cellular integrity during growth [28].

that were distributed among seven subcategories. The
greatest proportion of ESTs were associated with cytoplasm localization (70.03, 30.90%). Other main

subcategories included ESTs associated with endoplasmic reticulum localization (70.07, 23.88%) and plasma
membrane/membrane attached subcellular localization
(70.02, 20.51%). The subcategories of cell wall (70.01,

The O. novo-ulmi unique transcript collection was

that may be placed in these gene families of importance
to ascomycetous pathogens (Table 4). Genes of interest
included those relevant to cell wall biogenesis, pathogen
defense mechanisms during infection and the host infection process.

conditions, it will be possible to study whole organism
gene expression as it relates to pathogenicity. The multigenic character of fungal pathogenicity can thence be
more effectively assessed by this approach. Past efforts
focused on single genes have attained limited success
and have only confirmed the complex nature of fungal
pathogenicity in O. novo-ulmi [29]. Information gained
from future studies will be of benefit to understanding
the elm pathogen, as well as other fungal pathogens of
woody plant species.
Comparision with other Ophiostoma species

Discussion
Understanding pathogenicity in O. novo-ulmi

The construction of an EST library provides an initial
gene expression profile for the yeast phase of a highly
aggressive strain of the elm pathogen O. novo-ulmi. This
EST library will be the first step in elucidating the complex mechanisms determining fungal pathogenicity,
through the study of multiple candidate genes that are
potentially implicated in the infection process. Historically, studies of pathogenicity were limited to one or a
small number of candidate loci. With the creation of an
EST library and the eventual use of microarray analysis
to evaluate the expression of many genes under defined

The EST library will also serve as a comparative database for other studies underway in the Ophiostoma Genome Project for other growth states O. novo-ulmi and
for other species of the genus Ophiostoma that target
different hosts [30-34]. Associated data from the current
project includes a total of 561 EST fragments (Genbank
Acc: EG355614.1 to EG356175.1) from libraries that
selected for perithecial (Onu-Per, 128 EST’s), synnematal (Onu-Syn, 181), mycelium grown at 15°C (Onu-t15,
156) and mycelium grown at 31°C (Onu-t31, 96) growth
phases [35]. The comparison of expressed sequences for
different life phases will facilitate our preliminary analysis of differentially expressed genes in O. novo-ulmi and

provide direction for future studies of genes relevant to
pathogenesis. Existing EST projects for other Ophiostoma species include the sap-staining fungi Ophiostoma
piliferum (Fungal Genomics Project, Concordia University, web address: https://fungalgenomics.concordia.ca/
fungi/Opil.php), Grosmannia clavigera (formerly Ophiostoma clavigerum) [30,36,37] and Ophiostoma floccosum
(Farrell et al., pers. com.)
The search for proteins associated with the pathogenic
life phase of Ophiostoma spp. has produced various strategies designed to favour the expression of the relevant
gene families. The use of suppressive subtractive hybridization PCR for the screening of genes differentially
expressed in yeast and mycelia forms of the sap-stain
fungus Ophiostoma piceae has demonstrated one strategy for the identification of genes involved in morphology switching [31]. More recently, an EST library was
created for the lodgepole pine pathogen G. clavigera,
using selective media to favour the detection of fungal
genes expressed in the presence of oleoresin, one of the
key host tree defense mechanisms against fungal pathogens [30]. This study described 5,974 EST fragments
(2,600 unique transcripts) and their preliminary functional analysis was generally focused on those genes
implicated in fungal growth within the host and pathogenicity. Similarly, an EST library for O. piliferum was
constructed by culturing the fungus on different carbon
sources to obtain a total of 9,589 EST fragments (Tsang,
Storms and Butler, unpublished); this species has been
considered for industrial applications, including the biopulping process [38]. Useful insights into gene families
linked to virulence and growth within the host for O.
novo-ulmi could be obtained by reviewing the EST data
for G. clavigera and O. piliferum. Molecular mechanisms
underlying Dutch elm disease were recently studied with
the construction of an interaction cDNA library, by
means of suppression subtractive hybridization from
elm callus tissue following inoculation with O. novoulmi. Fifty three up-regulated Elm host-specific unique
transcripts were identified, including genes coding for
known classes of pathogenesis-related proteins [39].
Strategies for detecting genes that influence virulence in
O. novo-ulmi

The NCBI public database for submitted fungal EST
sequences includes a total of 2,909,255 entries for 216
species, with 1,931,468 entries for 134 species of ascomycetes alone (November 2010). Among the ascomycetous species, there are a number of phytopathogens that
have been the subject of genome sequencing projects,
many of which are available in public databases [40]. In
our efforts to indentify unique fungal genes relevant to
pathogenicity, two general strategies have been followed
in studies of O. novo-ulmi. We have considered other

Page 8 of 12

phytopathogenic ascomycete species as the most relevant group of organisms that may share common genes
of importance to the host infection process, as well as
dimorphic species of ascomycete pathogens that
undergo radical changes in morphology upon host infection. A comparison of gene inventories for filamentous
pathogenic and non-pathogenic ascomycetes identified a
set of gene families that appear to have increased in
diversity over evolutionary history and may play a role
in pathogenicity [26]. Genes seen in phytopathogenic
fungi are not necessarily unique to pathogen species,
but have developed a greater diversity of related genes
for specialized functions of a pathogenic lifestyle, when
compared to homologues that are found in non-pathogenic species [26]. These specialized functions can
include the production of secondary metabolites (mycotoxins, melanin, hydrophobins), the ability to use a variety of nutritional substrates, phenotypic plasticity
(infection structures, dimorphism) and complex signalling pathways relevant to the infection process (host
recognition, host defence systems, regulation of
morphogenesis).
Ophiostoma novo-ulmi exhibits mycelial and yeast-like
growth phases at different stages of growth and infection of the host elm. Possession of a variable growth
phase is shared with some important human pathogenic
fungi, where specific cues from the host species will
induce the change in morphology. A multigenic
approach has been pursued with these ascomycete
pathogens and has begun to provide some important
findings regarding the regulation of specific pathogen
loci and the infection process [41,42]. A consideration
of these genes in the screening of O. novo-ulmi library
may therefore provide useful information. Histidine
kinases in Blastomyces dermatitidis and Histoplasma
capsulatum appear to act as global regulators in these
dimorphic, human pathogenic ascomycetes, functioning
in a two-component signalling system to regulate
dimorphism and virulence. They directly influence the
transition from mycelial to yeast phase in the body of a
host and have been demonstrated to regulate the
expression of several yeast-phase specific genes [41]. A
single histidine kinase was identified in the EST library
(FunCat 14.07, 30.05), providing a potential gene target
for further evaluation. Also in B. dermatitidis, H. capsulatum and Paracoccidioides braziliensis the gene alpha(1,3)-glucan synthase and several other loci are considered yeast-phase specific virulence genes, as they are upregulated with the switch to the pathogenic yeast form
at 37°C in the host [42]. In the species H. capsulatum,
this is one of the genes regulated by a histidine kinase.
The O. novo-ulmi library also contains glucan synthase
(FunCat 01.05) and related genes that code for polysaccharides and other cell wall components.

A number of candidate virulence factors are under
consideration for human pathogenic fungi and include
melanin compounds, oxidative and nitrosative stress
defense mechanisms, cell adhesion compounds, specific
secreted products, arginine catabolism, cell surface composition, and those genes that are preferentially
expressed in the parasitic yeast phase [42]. Since the
transition of these dimorphic fungi from a mycelial to a
yeast phase is required for virulence, this latter category
has received much attention. For genomic studies of the
species of H. capsulatum and P. brasiliensis, a large
number of differentially expressed genes have been identified (500 and 328 genes, respectively) with the transition to the pathogenic yeast phase [43-45]. These genes
fall into a number of functional categories and have provided a valuable resource for current studies of phasespecific gene expression in these species. Further study
of the current yeast EST database created for O. novoulmi and its comparison to the EST library constructed
for the mycelia growth phase of this species should
allow the detection of phase-specific gene expression.
This will ultimately be done by the functional comparison of identified transcripts in each library and an
assessment of their variability in gene expression
through microarray analysis or RNA Seq analysis.

factor in O. novo-ulmi [20]. This proven method of gene
regulation will provide a means of effectively screening
multiple candidate genes from the EST library. Transformed wild type strains of O. novo-ulmi with modified
expression of selected genes can now be more easily
screened in bioassays to assess the impact of targeted
RNAi upon strain pathogenicity.

The development of control measures for O. novo-ulmi

Methods

The multigenic approach to assessing gene expression in
O. novo-ulmi will also serve the future objective of identifying gene targets that play a key role in the determination of pathogenicity for this species. Such genes will
be further studied to assess their potential as targets for
biological control strategies. One of the main criteria in
the identification of such gene targets will be to confirm
that the modification of gene expression at the chosen
locus will only induce changes in the fungal species and
not in the host, or in other non-target species. As a precursor to this assessment, it will be necessary to compile
a prioritized list of possible gene targets identified following the functional characterization of the EST
library. A preliminary list of genes has been assembled
in the current study and their evaluation can be assisted
by the concurrent evaluation of whole organism gene
expression made possible by microarray analysis.
The screening of candidate genes is best done by RNA
interference (RNAi) as a means of down-regulating the
expression of these gene targets. This approach has
been used to successfully characterize the role of alpha(1,3)-glucan synthase (AGS1) in the pathogenicity of H.
capsulatum [42], for the down-regulation of the polyketide synthase (PKS1) gene of the melanin pathway in
Ophiostoma piceae and Ophiostoma. floccosum [46] and,
more recently, for the evaluation of gene expression by
the endopolygalacturonase (epg1) gene, a pathogenicity

Fungal strains and culture conditions

Conclusions
The creation of an EST library for O. novo-ulmi has
provided an opportunity for gene discovery and the
functional analysis of gene expression in this important
plant pathogen. This library will also provide useful
information for the study of other Ophiostoma spp. of
economic importance. A number of genes that may
influence virulence and fitness in O. novo-ulmi have
been identified and these will be the focus of subsequent
studies to evaluate their role in host infection. Promising
gene targets will be assessed using an RNAi strategy to
establish their importance to pathogenicity. These findings will determine the approach of future biological
control research to control Dutch elm disease in
Canada. This research will be complemented by whole
genome expression studies for O. novo-ulmi and related
species.

Ophiostoma novo-ulmi strain H327, representing a highly
aggressive pathogen [47], was selected for RNA extractions. Dimorphic O. novo-ulmi can be grown as either a
mycelial or a yeast-like form, depending on culture conditions. Stock cultures were maintained on solid Ophiostoma complete medium (CM) plates at 23°C [48]. For the
generation of yeast-like cultures, 1 cm2 agar plugs were
cut from the edge of an actively growing colony, inoculated into a 50 ml volume of liquid CM contained in 125
ml Erlenmeyer flasks [48] and then incubated for 4 days
at 23°C with agitation (250 rpm). Yeast cells were subsequently obtained by filtering the liquid culture through 3
layers of sterile miracloth (Calbiotech, La Jolla, CA) and
pelleted by centrifugation (700 g) for 15 min.
Poly(A) mRNA extraction and purification

The extraction and purification of poly(A) RNA was performed using a MicroPoly(A)Pure mRNA Purification
Kit (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, ON,
Canada). Total RNA was extracted from 210 mg wet
weight of yeast cells and the poly (A) RNA was purified
by oligo(dT) cellulose spun-column chromatography.
The poly (A) RNA was resuspended in 20 μl of RNAasefree sterile, distilled water for storage at -80°C. Spectrophotometric analysis determined the RNA concentration
to be 853 ng/μl, with a purity ratio (A260/A280) of 1.452.

Complementary DNA synthesis

For construction of the yeast O. novo-ulmi cDNA
library, the pBluescript II XR cDNA Library Construction kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for the
first and second round of cDNA synthesis, cDNA terminus blunting, EcoRI adapter ligation and adapter phosphorylation. First-strand synthesis was performed at 42°
C for 1 hour with 9.20 μg of the yeast-like mRNA. Samples were cooled on ice for 5 min, prior to second
strand synthesis at 16°C for 2.5 hours. The terminus
blunting reaction was stopped after 30 min by extraction
with 200 μl phenol:chloroform (1:1, v/v). The cDNA
with blunt termini were precipitated overnight at -20°C,
following the addition of two volumes of 95% ethanol
and 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate. The mixture
was then centrifuged (13,000 g) for 20 min at 4°C, the
supernatant aspirated, the pellet dried by lyophilization
and re-suspended in a 9 μl volume containing the EcoRI
adapters (Stratagene). The adapters were ligated to the
blunt cDNA termini, following the addition of 1 μl 10 ×
ligase buffer, 1 μl 10 mM rATP, 4 units T4 DNA ligase
and incubation overnight at 8°C. The ligated EcoRI
adapters were phosphorylated with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and digested with 120 units XhoI at
37°C for 2 hours. The cDNA was ethanol precipitated
overnight at -20°C, centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 min at
4°C and the pellet was re-suspended in 10 μl Elution
Buffer (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada).
cDNA size fractionation, ligation and transformation

The synthesized cDNA was size fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in nuclease-free TAE buffer at 80 V for 1 hour, stained with ethidium bromide
and visualized under UV light. The cDNA corresponding to low molecular weight (LMW, 400 - 2,000 bp) and
high molecular weight (HMW, 2,000 - 5,000 bp) categories was excised and isolated using the Qiaquick Gel
Extraction kit (Qiagen). Fractionated cDNA was eluted
with 50 μl Elution Buffer. Spectrophotometric analysis
of the isolated yeast HMW and LMW cDNA samples
indicated concentrations of 2.8 ng/μl and 3.9 ng/μl,
respectively. Fractionated LMW cDNA was ligated into
the pBluescript II SK vector (pBluescript II XR cDNA
Library Construction kit, Stratagene). Ligation reactions
contained 10 ng fractionated cDNA, 20 ng vector, and 2
units of T4 DNA ligase in 1 × ligase buffer with 1 mM
rATP (pH 7.5), in a final volume of 5.0 μl that was incubated at 12°C for 24 hours. The resulting constructs
were employed to transform ultracompetent E. coli
DH12S cells by electroporation, using 1 mm gap cuvettes (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada) in a BTX
Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (settings: 1.30V; 2.5 kV
resistance; capacitance timing = out; 129 Ω). The titer
of the transformed bacterial cells was determined by

Page 10 of 12

dilution plating on 2YT plates (16 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L
yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl, adjusted to pH 7.0 with 2N
NaOH) amended with 50 μg/ml ampicillin (SigmaAldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada), 100 μg/ml X-galactose
(Sigma), and 31 mg/ml isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma). Bacterial titer plates were incubated
overnight at 37°C, counted and stored at 4°C for subculturing. Plate counts indicated that the yeast LMW
library contained approximately 22,000 clones. The primary stock culture of each library was stored at -80°C
in 50 μl aliquots to avoid freeze-thaw cycling during
sub-culturing.
DNA sequencing and annotation of ESTs

Clones from the primary yeast LMW cDNA library were
prepared for sequencing by plating on 2YT amended
with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, at a density of approximately
200 colonies/plate. Discrete colonies were transferred to
96-well cell culture plates (Corning, Lowell, MA, USA)
containing 200 μl 2YT amended with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Cell culture plates were sealed with foil tape (Corning) and incubated overnight at 37°C without shaking. A
total of 5,760 clones of the LMW cDNA library were
submitted for sequencing and BLASTX analysis.
Downstream processing of the LMW yeast-like O.
novo-ulmi cDNA library began with the comparison of
EST fragments to nucleotide sequences already submitted to public databases. In preparation for sequence
comparisons, the vector DNA was edited from authentic
O. novo-ulmi sequences. Putative identities were assigned
to each clone using the heuristic BLASTX algorithm [22],
which compares a nucleotide query sequence, translated
into all 6 reading frames, against the NCBI Genbank public database. A low-complexity filter was applied to query
sequences to remove regions of low-complexity, such as
proline-rich regions, or repeats of common acidic or
basic residues. The removal of these low-complexity
regions increased the fidelity of alignments, and enriched
the data for biological significance [49], rather than statistical significance alone.
Database construction and assignment of functional
categories to ESTs

For a list of unique ESTs retrieving hits from public
databases, see the Additional File 1 - Alphabetized list
of 880 ESTs determined to be unique transcripts with
matches to known proteins in the GenBank database).
All sequences have been deposited into GenBank’s EST
database (Accession numbers JG459238 - JG463623).
The Munich Information Centre for Protein
Sequences (MIPS, now the Institute for Bioinformatics,
Neuherberg, Germany) developed the Functional Catalogue (FunCat) as a stand-alone information management
framework and it has become a standard tool for

Hintz et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:431
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/431

bioinformatics studies [25,50]. FunCat is a hierarchically
structured, scalable classification system enabling the
functional assignment of proteins from any genome
according to their physiological role, or metabolic
pathway.
A transcription profile was created for the O. novoulmi Yeast LMW library using transcripts which
matched sequences characterized in other organisms.
These were subjected to further BLAST analysis to
obtain the three highest scoring alignments and this
information was manually scrutinized to determine the
most meaningful annotation for each EST within the
FunCat scheme. It is important to note that many proteins are associated with more than one metabolic pathway and many pathways influence more than one aspect
of metabolism. Consequently, the assignment of a single
functional category to a protein can be both restrictive
and inaccurate. Many multifunctional proteins are justifiably included in numerous functional categories. This
can result in a small number of proteins generating a
very large number of functional assignments. In order to
standardize FunCat scores for the Yeast LMW EST
library and accommodate multifunctional proteins, we
assigned each protein a total of 1.00 units of metabolic
function, such that multifunctional proteins were
assigned a value less than one, as dictated by the number of functional categories they encompassed [metabolic function = x(1/x), where × = number of functional
categories included and 1/x = proportion of metabolic
function assigned to each category].
