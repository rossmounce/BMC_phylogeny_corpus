Abstract
Background: Within the bilaterians, the appearance and evolution of vertebrates is accompanied
by enormous changes in anatomical, morphological and developmental features. This evolution of
increased complexity has been associated with two genome duplications (2R hypothesis) at the
origin of vertebrates. However, in spite of extensive debate the validity of the 2R hypothesis
remains controversial. The paucity of sequence data in early years of genomic era was an intrinsic
obstacle in tracking the genome evolutionary history of chordates.
Hypothesis: In this article I review the 2R hypothesis by taking into account the recent availability
of genomic sequence data for an expanding range of animals. I argue here that genetic architecture
of lower metazoans and representatives of major vertebrate and invertebrate lineages provides no
support for the hypothesis relating the origin of vertebrates with widespread gene or genome
duplications.
Conclusion: It appears that much of the genomic complexity of modern vertebrates is very
ancient likely predating the origin of chordates or even the Bilaterian-Nonbilaterian divergence.
The origin and evolution of vertebrates is partly accompanied by an increase in gene number.
However, neither can we take this subtle increase in gene number as an only causative factor for
evolution of phenotypic complexity in modern vertebrates nor we can take it as a reflection of
polyplodization events early in their history.

Background
To explain the genetic basis of major transitions in organismal evolution, in 1970 Susumu Ohno famously proposed that multiple rounds of whole genome
duplications (2R hypothesis) had occurred during the
early history of vertebrate lineage, driving the evolution of
developmental and morphological complexity in vertebrates [1,2]. Ohno,s idea was based solely on genome size
differences, chromosomal topologies, and recent tetraploidization events in some fish and amphibians. Over

the past decade the 2R hypothesis has gained extensive
popularity among evolutionary and developmental biologist.
Proponents presented several lines of evidence in favor of
entire genome duplication hypothesis in the early vertebrates. First, compared to model invertebrate genomes
(fruit fly, nematode, sea squirt and amphioxus) the typical
vertebrate genome possess more genes [3]. Second, the
existence of paralogons in the human genome [4,5].

Third, the conservation of gene synteny throughout vertebrates and their invertebrate ancestors and the spread of
these anciently conserved syntenic fragments among multiple vertebrate chromosomes (vertebrate paralogons)
[6,7]. Fourth, the refinement of extensive gene duplication events early in vertebrate history through molecularclock based approaches (absolute dating) [8,9]. Fifth, the
extrapolation of genome evolution scenarios in plant and
yeast to genome evolution events in vertebrates [10-12]. A
further piece of evidence in favor of two rounds of whole
genome duplication hypothesis emerges from the observation that protostome invertebrates (fruit fly) and deuterostome cephalochordate amphioxus possess single
HOX cluster whereas the vertebrates have four or more
clusters [13-15]. Impressed by the fascination associated

with this hypothesis some researchers have gone so far as
to state " there is now incontrovertible evidence supporting the 2R hypothesis"[16].
Opponents of the 2R hypothesis argued that the current
data is not compelling evidence of polyploidization and
increase in the number of paralogous genes in vertebrates
occurred as a result of small scale gene duplication events
involving single genes and chromosomal segments, scattered at different times during the history of life [17-21].
In spite of extensive empirical scrutiny, the 2R remains
controversial. The intrinsic difficulty was the lack of broad
phylogenetic representation in the available sequence
data. However, the recent availability of sequence data

from an expanding range of vertebrate and invertebrate
species from interspersed time points (Figure 1) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to test two main
competing hypotheses by employing the deepest and
more diverse sampling of organisms.

Presentation of the hypothesis
Rapid paralogous gene increase in the early stage of
vertebrate evolution
The recently sequenced genomes for two morphologically
simple invertebrates, sea anemone (a cnidarian model)
and sea urchin (nonchordate deuterostome) provides a
unique perspective on the evolution of animal genomes
[22,23]. The genomic complexity of sea anemone and sea
urchin, in terms of gene contents and structure, suggests
that many features of the genetic toolkit seen in modern
vertebrates existed in the ancestral deuterostome genome
or even in the common ancestor of bilaterians-nonbilaterians animals (Figure 1). Surprisingly this ancestral animal gene set has undergone extensive contraction in many
protostomes and nonvertebrate chordate animals. Many
gene families that were expanded deep in the history of
life (before the bilaterian-nonbilaterian divergence) and
whose descendants survive in modern vertebrates,
appeared to be absent in model protostomes (fruit fly,
nematode) and chordates (amphioxus, Ciona). For
instance, Nematostella vectensis (sea anemone) which is a
model animal from the basal metazoan phylum Cnidaria
shares 11 of 12 Wnt genes found in humans, while fruit
fly shares only 6 of 12 [24]. Similarly, the number of
orthologous genes between the ascidian (nonvertebrate
chordate) and the modern vertebrates are less than the
number estimated between the vertebrates and the sea
urchin (simple deuterostome) [23]. Inferring gene/
genome duplication events at the base of vertebrate lineage, by using any of these highly derived invertebrate
model outgroups, including amphioxus which was previously assumed as a good representative of ancestral chordate genome, would thus be problematic. For instance,
defining the duplication time windows for human gene
families (under the 1R/2R hypothesis) by using an invertebrate outgroup such as amphioxus/ciona or fruit fly
could falsely place many of those gene expansion events
that might have occurred deeper in the life history, at the
base of vertebrate lineage [9,25]. This sort of data could
inaccurately show a rapid paralogous gene increase in the
early stage of vertebrate evolution and could also lead to
a misleading conclusion of big-bang events (genome
duplications).
Morphological complexity and gene number
The homeobox genes are key components of developmental toolkit of animals, and it has been suggested that
functional diversification of these genes through duplication and divergence was pivotal in the evolution of com-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/50

plex developmental and morphological features in
bilaterian animals. If the origin of particular homeobox
gene is in actuality associated with the evolution of particular animal trait, in that case one should expect an
increase in the homeobox toolkit repertoire during evolutionary transitions from simple to complex life forms, like
from basal diploblastic animals to triploblastic life forms,
protostome to deuterostome and from simple chordates
to modern vertebrates. However, recent data shows that
all the major classes of homeodomain coding genes have
undergone significant radiation deep in animal evolution,
before the divergence of Cnidaria and Bilateria [26]. Surprisingly, the genome of morphologically simple nonbilaterian, the sea anemone possesses significantly more
homeobox genes than the morphologically and developmentally complex fruit fly.
Furthermore, a fundamental problem with the hypothesis
linking the sudden appearance of complex morphological
traits in vertebrates with whole genome/extensive gene
duplication events is that in defining the evolutionary
steps in the phenotypic complexity, the extinct lineages
were completely ignored. However, when fossils are taken
into account, jumps in morphological complexity disappear and the proposed whole genome duplication in vertebrate history no longer is correlated with the origin of
body plans [27]. Thus it appears that a correlation
between the big jumps in the morphological complexity
and proposed whole genome duplication in vertebrates is
an artifact of incomplete taxonomic sampling.
Given the fact that there is no apparent relationship
between the gene number and organismal complexity
(Figure 1), the assumption that modern vertebrates have
attained higher level of complexity in their body plans by
expanding their genetic toolkit through big-bangs of
genome amplification events is not credible. Instead the
most plausible explanation of organismal complexity is to
deploy each gene with particular developmental function
at many times and places during development. This
increase in the diversity of gene function may involve an
increase in the number of transcription factors or an
increase in the number of cis-acting regulatory elements
that control region-specific expression of genes[28]. This
sort of regulatory evolution creates many-fold increase in
the complexity of developmental processes without drastic expansion of gene number [29-32].
Paralogy regions in the human genome
The distinct chromosomal regions within a genome that
contains a set of similar genes are known as paralogy
regions or paralogons. Very often the genetic constitution
of these intra-genomic homology blocks remains conserved across distantly related genomes (conserved synteny) [6,7,33]. The occurrence of two-fold, three-fold and

Page 3 of 9
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:50

four-fold paralogy regions in human and other vertebrates
and their co-occurrence in distinct genomes is taken as an
evidence that ancestral genome of modern vertebrates was
shaped by two rounds of polyploidization (2R hypothesis) [4,6,25,34-36]. Alternative hypothesis suggests that
the constituent multigene families of these anciently conserved vertebrate paralogy regions arose as a result of
small scale duplications involving gene clusters and chromosomal segments which occurred at different time
points during chordate evolution [17,37-39]. Whereas the
spread of similar gene sets on distinct vertebrate chromosomes is the consequence of subsequent rearrangement
events[17,40]. The conservation of these blocks of genes
both within and between species may reflect selective reasons [37]. For instance; to have genes of similar expression
or function in the physical proximity on a chromosomal
segment.
In fact, the occurrence of two-fold paralogy regions can be
explained by many alternative explanatory scenarios,
whereas the three and four-fold paralogy regions may be
indicative of two rounds of ancient whole genome or
whole chromosome duplication events. However, given
the large size of human and other vertebrate chromosomes the fraction of gene families having three or four
representatives on four-fold paralogy regions is very small
[41]. For instance, human HOX cluster bearing chromosomes (Hsa2, 7, 12 and 17) contains in total ~4609
known coding genes (NCBI 36 assembly of human
genome), whereas the HOX cluster paralogon harbors
only 11 known multigene families with at least three of
their members anciently linked to HOX clusters [17]. This
illustrates that spatial organization of ~0.95% of coding
contents of human HOX cluster bearing chromosomes
favors the structuring of these chromosome through
ancient tetraploidization events, whereas the history of
remaining portion may not be in harmony with this scenario. Thus it is not plausible to take the presence of few
similar gene sets on three or four human chromosomes as
evidence that the chromosomes are related by large duplication.
Moreover, for identifying ancient paralogons in the vertebrate genomes some researchers have combined the mapself comparison approach with a comparison with a preduplication species. In these studies the coverage and distribution pattern of old paralogs [5] or anciently conserved syntenic fragments [6] in the human and other
vertebrate genomes was subjected to statistical analysis to
rule out the null hypothesis: that the constituent gene
families of vertebrate paralogons have arisen by distinct
duplication events and their members were brought
together in three or four collinear regions on different
chromosomes as a result of rearrangement of genomic

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/50

segments including multiple contiguous genes [17,37].
However, it is advisable to recognize that the statistical
validation of distribution of old paralogs or anciently conserved (vertebrate-invertebrate) syntenic segments among
multiple vertebrate chromosomes does not constitute the
evidence for the mechanism of origin of paralogons.
Therefore, special care should be taken in interpreting the
sheer map distribution of a subset of ancient vertebrate
genes as an illustration of polyploidization in vertebrate
early evolutionary history.
The precise nature of those events that has created
ancient paralogy regions (> 450 Mya) of vertebrate
genome is hard to track because such events are obscured
by long term evolutionary divergence and rearrangements. However, an important insight into these ancient
events can be gained by tracing the genome evolutionary
scenario of very recently diverged species. For instance,
the availability of genome sequence data for multiple
primate species has shown that that our own genetic
material is expanded by ~5% during the past 35â40 million years (divergence of New and Old World monkeys)
of evolution through segmental duplications (SDs) and
rearrangement events [42,43]. These recent human segmental duplications are large nearly identical copies of
genomic DNA, ranging from 300 kb to 1 Mb in size, and
are present in at least two genomic locations [44].
Detailed analysis has attributed several roles to SD
events: creation of new genes in primates, expansion of
multigene families, and triggering large scale chromosomal rearrangements in hominoid [44]. Huge impact of
recent SDs in architecturing the primate genome over the
short period of evolutionary time, apparently support
the notion that small scale duplications and rearrangements might have remained a predominant mechanism
in shaping the vertebrate genome throughout their evolutionary history [37,38].
Now the question is that, what kept the similar set of
genes together on distinct chromosomal regions or in distinct genomes? The preservation of intra-genomic and
inter-genomic synteny over longer period of evolutionary
time is unlikely to be the result of chance. Empirical data
strongly support the notion that, there are adaptive reasons to keep certain configurations of genes together over
evolutionary time [37]. For instance, higher order structural organization of chromosomes, might help in co-regulation of particular sets of neighboring genes in a
coordinated manner by recruiting them to shared regions
of gene expression [45]. Similarly, the gene regulatory elements spread across long regions impose critical constraint on genomic architecture and are known to have
maintained exceptionally long syntenic blocks both
within and across species [46-48].

HOX cluster duplication and the history of vertebrate
genome evolution
HOX family of homeobox containing transcriptional factors lies in adjacent positions and forms a cluster along a
chromosome in animal genomes. All invertebrates
including fruit fly and amphioxus have only one HOX
gene cluster whereas all vertebrates possess more than one
set of HOX clusters [49]. The fact that human and other
mammals possess four coherent HOX gene clusters
whereas their closest invertebrate relative amphioxus contain just a single set of collinear HOX genes, is taken as
evidence that the origin of vertebrates coincided with two
rounds of whole genome duplication events [10,50].
Undoubtedly the HOX gene cluster duplication occurred
specifically on the vertebrate lineage [13,51]. However,
conclusions regarding HOX gene clusters alone cannot to
be extended to define the evolutionary history of entire
genome. In fact the evolutionary history of human HOX
clusters itself support the notion that they originated by
regional duplication. Zhang and Nei [52] analyzed the
phylogeny of mammalian HOX clusters and proposed
two alternative topologies (((HOXC HOXD) HOXA)
HOXB) and ((HOXC HOXD) (HOXA HOXB)). The
former topology suggests three separate regional duplication steps (1â2â4 HOX clusters) whereas the later favors
two rounds of whole genome duplication events (2 + 2
topology). Analysis of COL and ERBB multigene families,
whose members are closely linked to four human HOX
clusters, did not resolve the cluster duplication events
decisively [37,53]. The representatives of human SP gene
family are very closely spaced to HOX clusters, with
human SP1 gene mapping at approximately 526 kb centromeric to HOXC, SP2; at ~614 kb centromeric to HOXB,
SP3; at ~2 Mb centromeric to HOXD and SP4; at ~5 Mb
telomeric to HOXA (Figure 2). The close physical linkage
of SP family members with each of human HOX clusters
makes them an interesting test case to evaluate the HOX
cluster duplication history. Thorough phylogenetic analysis of SP family members (employing broad taxonomic
sampling) has revealed that SP1, SP2, SP3 and SP4 genes
share their duplication history with HOX clusters and
have arisen together with the HOX clusters through three
separate segmental duplication steps [17] (Figure 2). Thus
congruency in the phylogenies of human HOX clusters
and SP genes not only resolved the cluster duplication
events but also decisively rejected the assumption that
four HOX clusters in tetrapods are the result of two rounds
of whole genome duplication early in vertebrate history
(Figure 2).

Testing the hypothesis
I have questioned the validity of arguments adduced in
support of Ohno's view that the complexity of vertebrate
genomes originated by means of whole genome duplications. Instead, the hypothesis presented here suggests that

the animal genomes evolved through small-scale duplication events scattered at different times over the history of
life. This hypothesis is testable in the light of currently
available extensive genomic data form an expanding
range of vertebrate and invertebrate animals: 1) through
comparison of total gene number and gene family size differences among modern vertebrate and basal invertebrate
(for instance, sea anemone/sea urchin) genomes; 2) by
estimating the fraction of vertebrate chromosomes occupied by three or four fold paralogy regions; 3) by conducting the phylogenetic analysis of multigene families with
three or more of their representatives residing on four-fold
paralogy regions (paralogons) in the human genome; 4)
by estimating the genome evolutionary scenario of very
recently diverged vertebrate species (for instance, primates
among vertebrates). Evaluating the correlation between
the organismal complexity and gene duplications may
also be helpful in testing the validity of two main competing hypotheses [27] (small-scale duplication versus 2R
hypothesis).
Very often the statistical evaluation of vertebrate genome
evolutionary history is based on comparative data from
few vertebrate and highly derived invertebrate genomes
and thus could inadvertently lead to unfounded conclusions. Therefore, I propose that broadening of taxonomic
sampling in statistical approaches by employing the currently available extensive genomic data, in particular from
well preserved basal metazoan genomes and recently
diverged vertebrate species, would provide a much clearer
picture of animal genome evolution.

Implications of the hypothesis
Initial attempts to unravel the evolutionary aspects of our
own genome have borne out highly controversial results.
Some has suggested that drastic events (2 rounds of whole
genome duplication/2R hypothesis) at the base of vertebrate lineage led to the greater genetic complexity in modern vertebrate genome whereas other researchers rejected
the 2R hypothesis at all and suggested a continuous mode
of small scale duplications (segmental/gene cluster).
These alternative scenarios of vertebrate genome evolution are largely based on data from human and few other
vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. The recent availability of additional vertebrate and invertebrate genomes has
provided an unprecedented insight into the core evolutionary processes that had shaped our genome, deep in
the history of life. Surveying of newly sequenced genomes
from the deepest branches of life has revealed that many
components of the genetic toolkit seen in modern vertebrates arose and diversified deep in animal history even
before the origin of chordates. Indeed the origin and evolution of vertebrates is partly accompanied by an increase
in gene number, for instance one coherent HOX cluster in
amphioxus like invertebrate to four or more HOX clusters
in modern vertebrates. However, neither can we take this
subtle increase in gene number as an only causative factor
for evolution of phenotypic complexity in modern vertebrates nor we can take it as a reflection of whole genome
duplication events early in their history. In depth analysis
of the genomic data from recently diverged primate species on markedly different phenotypic trajectories provides valuable clues to ancient genomic events. These data
supports the notion that small scale duplications and rearrangements have remained a pervasive phenomenon,
driving the vertebrate evolution both at phenotypic and
genotypic level, throughout their history. I conclude,
therefore, that the comparative genomic data from species
that diverged early in metazoan evolution (such as Cnidarian-bilaterian) as well as from the very recently
diverged animals (such as primates among vertebrates)
provides no evidence in favor of the ancestral tetraploidy
in vertebrates. In fact it appears that the 2R hypothesis is
an artifact, invoked by the lack of phylogenetic breadth in
the genome sequence data in early years of genomic era.

This is a critical overview of the 2R hypothesis (two
rounds of whole genome duplication) on the origin of
vertebrates. The conclusion that, to a large extent, is based
on the unexpected genomic complexity of organizationally simple animals, such as sea anemone, and on the
modest number of 2-fold and, particularly, 4-fold paralogons in vertebrate genomes, is that there is currently no
basis to accept the 2R hypothesis. Instead, it is proposed
that the vertebrate genome evolved by relatively small,
regional duplications.
This is an old controversy to which this paper does not
add any new analysis, only discussion, and that, in my
opinion, somewhat perfunctory. As I see the situation, the
jury is still out with regard to the 2R. It is important to
realize that the 2R hypothesis has gone a long way since
the days it was first proposed by Ohno. The 2R hypothesis
now claims support from the comparisons of the gene
order in the vertebrate paralogons and in Amphioxus, i.e.,
the duplications in vertebrates appear to be synteny-preserving rather than synteny-disrupting [6]. Even more
importantly, perhaps, a global analysis of the distribution
of old paralogs in vertebrate genomes has been claimed to
support 2R [5,16]. Thus, 2R is not sheer speculation, considerable effort has been undertaken to test this hypothesis, and there are strong claims of evidence that
consistently supports it.
Personally, I have a certain epistemological sympathy for
the position taken in this paper in the sense that I believe
that, as a matter of principle, the piecemeal duplication
model should be the null hypothesis of (in this case, vertebrate) genome evolution that has to be falsified in favor
of WGD scenarios. I doubt that the current statistical argument for such falsification is overwhelming so that 2R is
to be accepted as the final verdict. However, I also think
that the evidence in support of 2R is rather diverse and
rather substantial, so it needs to be addressed seriously
rather than summarily dismissed, primarily, on the basis
of the high complexity of primitive metazoan genomes
which is not a logically consistent argument against 2R. I
believe that, for a really critical assessment of the 2R
hypothesis, the evolutionary genomics literature, and in
particular, the evidence claimed in support of 2R should
be examined in considerably greater detail and more carefully, with special attention to the underlying assump-

tions of the statistical models employed in the respective
studies.

1. It is advisable to recognize that the statistical support
for the spread of old paralogs or anciently conserved (vertebrate-invertebrate) syntenic fragments among multiple
vertebrate chromosomes [5,6] does not constitute the evidence for the mechanism of origin of vertebrate paralogy
regions. I propose therefore, that, special care should be
taken in interpreting the sheer map distribution of a subset of ancient vertebrate genes as a strong support of polyploidization in vertebrate early evolutionary history.

The author presents a critical review of the so-called
"Ohno's hypothesis" or "2R hypothesis" postulating that
the early vertebrate lineage underwent one or more complete genome duplications. The author argues that the
genome sequence data do not support the 2R hypothesis.
While I am not sure if the 2R hypothesis is falsifiable
based on genomic data, I would support this publication
if the author could include discussion of a recent paper in
favor of the 2R hypothesis.

Author response
I am thankful to Dr. Jurka for reviewing this manuscript.

2. In this article I do not intend to challenge the statistical
models describing the vertebrate genome evolutionary
events. My purpose here is to highlight the fact that well
preserved genetic architecture of basal metazoans and
comparative analysis of primate genomes (or any other
group of vertebrates with comparable relatedness) casts
serious doubt on the plausibility of the 2R hypothesis.
Instead the recently sequenced genomes of animals from
interspersed time points clearly shows that much of the
genomic complexity seen in the modern vertebrates is
very ancient than was previously anticipated (by 2R proponents). It appears that vertebrates had accomplished
this genomic complexity through piecemeal duplications
at widely different times over the evolution of life.

In the revised manuscript, by keeping in view the suggestion of Dr. Jurka, I included the recent paper from Kasahara M. (2007) [16] and other articles favoring 2R.

Statistical testing of vertebrate genome evolutionary scenarios is often based on comparative observations from
few vertebrate and highly derived invertebrate genomes,
and thus could inadvertently lead to unfounded conclusions. Therefore, I recommend that future statistical
approaches to test hypothesis concerning vertebrate
genome evolution, should take into account the newly
sequenced genomes of basal metazoan animals and
recently diverged vertebrate species (for instance primates).

This review article assesses the hypothesis of two wholegenome duplications in vertebrate evolution in light of
recent sequence data. I agree with the article's conclusion
that there is no good reason to believe this hypothesis. I
have a few comments about some of the arguments presented and the implications of some of the language used.
I found the role of the SP gene family in resolving the history of HOX clusters to be unclear. In fact the argument is
more tenuous than the discussion would suggest. How
can phylogenetic analysis of SP reveal both that the SP
genes "share their evolutionary history with HOX clusters" and that HOX genes have "arisenthrough three separate segmental duplication steps"? Knowing that the
evolutionary histories are the same would presumably
entail knowing the phylogeny of HOX, so that the SP phylogeny would provide no additional information about
HOX. It is in fact simply assumed that the candidate HOX
phylogeny that agrees with the SP phylogeny is the correct
one. This is possible, but if other linked paralogs have dif-

ferent histories, as suggested by the cited references, it is
far from certain.
I would add that it is too strong to say that the alternative
rooted topology, ((HOXC HOXD) (HOXA HOXB)),
"favors two rounds of whole genome duplication events".
This topology is consistent with 2R, but also with three
local duplication events. In the absence of whole-genome
duplications it would not be surprising to find some sets
of paralogs with this type of topology.
I am uncertain of the meaning, in paragraph 3 of Paralogy
Regions in the Human Genome, of "those vertebrate species that have recent evolutionary origin." Because the species analyzed are primates, this might be taken to imply,
incorrectly, that humans and our closest relatives are more
recently evolved than other organisms and that evolution
is a thing of the more distant past for other groups. Comparative analysis of primates can of course yield valuable
information, but the same role could be played here by
any other group of vertebrate species with comparable
relatedness. Other expressions in the manuscript also suggest a ladder-like view of evolution, even if that is not the
author's intent: "genetic architecture of deepest as well as
most recent branches of animals" (Abstract); "evolutionary basal invertebrate" (paragraph 1 of Rapid Paralogous
Gene Increase); "an ideal chordate ancestral genome"
(same paragraph); "the deepest branches of life" (final
paragraph).
Author response
I am grateful to Dr. Cherry for valuable comments and
useful suggestions on this manuscript.

1. The most parsimonious explanation of the order of
branching in HOX cluster and closely linked SP phylogenies is that, both of these gene families arose simultaneously (co-duplicated group) through three independent
duplication steps (Figure 2). Other genes families (having
three or four members linked to HOX clusters) in the
HOX cluster paralogons, e.g. ERBB, COL, GLI, HH, SLC4A
and others have recently been resolved into four discrete
co-duplicated groups [17]. It has been shown that genes
within each of these co-duplicated groups (of HOX cluster
paralogons) are duplicated in concert with each other
whereas the constituent genes of two different co-duplicated groups may not have duplicated simultaneously
[17]. This observation is contrary to 2R scenario, which
assumed that constituent gene families of HOX cluster
paralogons arose simultaneously through two rounds of
WGD.
2. I must agree that the SP phylogeny helps in understanding the phylogeny (duplication history) of HOX and
would provide no additional information about HOX

evolutionary history. Therefore, I replaced the term "share
their evolutionary history" with the "share their duplication history" (HOX cluster duplication and the history of
vertebrate genome evolution).
3. I must also agree with Dr. Cherry's argument that in the
absence of whole-Genome duplications it would not be
surprising to find some sets of paralogs with (AB)(CD)
type topology.
4. In the revised manuscript I tried to erase a ladder-like
view of evolution and have used precise terms to explain
the evolutionary relatedness among animals.
5. Minor issues were also addressed in the revised manuscript.
