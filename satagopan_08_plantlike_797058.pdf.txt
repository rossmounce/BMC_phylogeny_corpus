Abstract
Background: Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate is the rate-limiting enzyme in photosynthesis. The
catalytic large subunit of the green-algal enzyme from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is ~90% identical
to the flowering-plant sequences, although they confer diverse kinetic properties. To identify the
regions that may account for species variation in kinetic properties, directed mutagenesis and
chloroplast transformation were used to create four amino-acid substitutions in the carboxy
terminus of the Chlamydomonas large subunit to mimic the sequence of higher-specificity plant
enzymes.
Results: The quadruple-mutant enzyme has a 10% increase in CO2/O2 specificity and a lower
carboxylation catalytic efficiency. The mutations do not seem to influence the protein expression,
structural stability or the function in vivo.
Conclusion: Owing to the decreased carboxylation catalytic efficiency, the quadruple-mutant is
not a "better" enzyme. Nonetheless, because of its positive influence on specificity, the carboxy
terminus, relatively far from the active site, may serve as a target for enzyme improvement via
combinatorial approaches.

Background
Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase
(Rubisco) (EC 4.1.1.39) is limited by a low carboxylation
rate and competing oxygenase activity that initiates a
wasteful photorespiratory pathway leading to the loss of
fixed carbon [1]. The CO2/O2 specificity (Ω) of Rubisco is
equal to the ratio of catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for carboxylation (Vc/Kc) to oxygenation Vo/Ko [2]. Net photosynthetic CO2 fixation would be increased if Rubisco
could work faster with greater specificity for CO2 [1,2].
Because there is natural variation in Rubisco kinetic constants [3], it may be possible to develop genetic engineer-

ing strategies aimed at improving the enzyme by focusing
on regions responsible for this variation.
The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an excellent
model for studying plant-like Rubisco enzymes comprised of eight large subunits (~55 kDa, coded by the
chloroplast rbcL gene) and eight small subunits (~15 kDa,
coded by a family of nuclear rbcS genes) [1]. Mutants that
lack Rubisco function can be maintained with acetate, and
both the nuclear rbcS and chloroplast rbcL genes are amenable to transformation [4,5]. Because Chlamydomonas
Rubisco has a faster carboxylation rate and lower Ω value

than Rubisco enzymes of flowering plants [3], but shares
~90% sequence identity with flowering-plant enzymes, a
phylogenetic approach has been initiated to define the
structural basis for differences in catalysis [6,7]. There are
only 34 residues in the Chlamydomonas large subunit that
differ from those of 500 flowering-plant sequences [6].
Changing five of these "phylogenetic" residues to those
common to flowering plants, and introducing a spinach
small-subunit loop, produced a Chlamydomonas Rubisco
enzyme with catalytic properties more like those of flowering plants than Chlamydomonas, including a 12–17%
increase in Ω [7]. However, because the Ω value was not
identical to that of flowering-plant Rubisco, there must be
other residues that also contribute to the differences in
Rubisco catalytic properties.
The loop between β-strand 6 and α-helix 6 of the largesubunit α/β barrel folds over the transition-state analog
carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CABP) [8] (Fig. 1).
In this closed conformation, the large-subunit carboxy terminus (residues Trp-462 to Leu-475) packs over loop 6
(Fig. 1) [9,10]. In Chlamydomonas Rubisco, substitution of
conserved Asp-473, which was proposed to be an essential
latch residue [11], with either Ala or Glu did not eliminate
catalysis but caused a 14–17% decrease in Ω [12]. Deletion of 10 residues from the carboxy terminus of the Synechococcus (cyanobacterium) large subunit caused a 38%
decrease in Ω, and a group of four plant-like substitutions
E470P/T471A/K474T/L475V was reported to cause a 9%
increase in Ω [13]. However, this small increase was close
to the experimental error of the assays employed [13].
Lengthening the carboxy terminus beyond residue 475
had no effect on Ω [14].
The Chlamydomonas carboxy-terminal residues Asp-470,
Thr-471, Ile-472, and Lys-474 comprise a set of previously
identified "phylogenetic" residues (Fig. 1A) [6] that differ
from the set common to flowering plants (Glu-470, Ala471, Met-472, and Thr-474). The carboxy terminal residues of Synechococcus, studied previously [13], comprise a
somewhat different set of residues (Thr-471, Lys-474, and
Leu-475) relative to those of flowering plants (Ala-471,
Thr-474, and Val-475). Therefore, the carboxy terminus of
Chlamydomonas was changed via directed mutagenesis and
chloroplast transformation to that of spinach Rubisco
(Fig. 1B) to see whether the catalytic properties common
to Rubisco of flowering plants might be obtained.

Results
Recovery and phenotype of the mutant strain
The residues equivalent to Chlamydomonas Asp-470, Thr471, Ile-472, and Lys-474 are Glu, Ala, Met, and Thr,
respectively, in most flowering-plant sequences [6]. The
carboxy terminus of the spinach large subunit is identical
in length to that of Chlamydomonas, and the availability of

the spinach crystal structure [10] allows structural comparison (Fig. 1). However, whereas most plant Rubisco
enzymes contain a Glu at position 470, this residue is a
Pro in spinach Rubisco. Thus, a Chlamydomonas D470P/
T471A/I472M/K474T mutant enzyme was created to
mimic the large-subunit carboxy terminus of spinach
Rubisco.

When the rbcL-deletion mutant MX3312 was transformed
with the rbcL-D470P/T471A/I472M/K474T gene, photosynthesis-competent colonies were recovered. Thus, the
substituted residues are not essential for Rubisco expression, assembly, or function in vivo. Furthermore, the
mutant strain was indistinguishable from wild type with
respect to growth at either 25 or 35°C, eliminating the
possibility that the mutant is temperature conditional
(data not shown) [15].
Mutant Rubisco holoenzyme stability
To assess the effect of the mutant substitutions on holoenzyme levels in vivo, protein extract was subjected to SDSPAGE and western-blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the
D470P/T471A/I472M/K474T quadruple-mutant strain
contains wild-type levels of Rubisco subunits. A wild-type
level of holoenzyme could also be purified from the quadruple mutant when cell extract was fractionated on a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/85

sucrose-density gradient (data not shown). No difference
was detected between the mutant and wild-type enzymes
when thermal stability experiments were performed in
vitro (Fig. 3). Thus, analysis of the catalytic properties of
the quadruple-mutant enzyme would not be expected to
be influenced by structural instability during the assays.
Kinetic properties of the quadruple-mutant enzyme
To determine whether the spinach-like substitutions can
confer catalytic properties mimicking those of the spinach
enzyme, kinetic constants were determined for the purified mutant enzyme (Table 1). The Ω value of the D470P/
T471A/I472M/K474T quadruple-mutant Rubisco enzyme
is 10% higher than that of the wild-type Chlamydomonas
enzyme. Nonetheless, this value is still 17% lower than
that of spinach Rubisco (Table 1). Although the Ω value
appears to be altered in the correct direction, the other
kinetic constants remain quite different from those of
spinach Rubisco (Table 1). The increase in Ω is likely the
consequence of an increase in Ko/Kc (Table 1). Due to an
apparent decrease in Vc/Kc, the D470P/T471A/I472M/
K474T quadruple-mutant enzyme would not be a "better"
Rubisco [1].

I472M/K474T quadruple-mutant enzyme, causes a 10%
increase in Ω, but the other kinetic constants are not like
those of spinach Rubisco (Table 1). Thus, these engineered "phylogenetic" residues [6] do not by themselves
account for the differences in catalysis between
Chlamydomonas and spinach Rubisco. However, there
should be other residues in the spinach enzyme that complement for the lower values of Kc and Ko (Table 1). Residue 341 (Val in Chlamydomonas and Ile in flowering-plant
enzymes) is a "phylogenetic" residue in the loop 6, which
is in van der Waals contact with the conserved Asp-473 of
the carboxy terminus (Fig. 1). Another divergent residue,
Arg-305, is also involved in van der Waals contact with the
carboxy terminus. The analogous Lys-305 of the spinach
enzyme interacts with the carboxy terminus via a single
hydrogen-bond (Fig. 1) and a P305K substitution in Chromatium vinosum Rubisco causes an 80% increase in carboxylation catalytic efficiency [16]. It is thus likely that the
addition of V341I and R305K substitutions to the D470P/
T471A/I472M/K474T quadruple mutant would confer
kinetic constants that are more like the flowering-plant
enzymes.
Engineering of Synechococcus Rubisco to produce an
E470P/T471A/K474T/L475V mutant enzyme with a spinach-like large-subunit carboxy terminus may also have
resulted in a similar, relative increase in Ω [13], but the Ω
value of that mutant Synechococcus enzyme is still ~10%
lower than the Ω value of the Chlamydomonas quadruplemutant enzyme analyzed in the present study. Variation
in amino-acid identities at residues 472 and 475 may
indicate that these residues are less important than the
others. The loss of the E470-R131 and E470-K474 salt
bridges in Synechococcus Rubisco [17] and D470-R131 and
D470-K474 salt bridges in Chlamydomonas Rubisco [9]
(Fig. 1) may be primarily responsible for the observed
increases in Ω [18].

In a recent study, a set of three "phylogenetic" substitutions in the Chlamydomonas large subunit (C256F/K258R/
I265V), which causes a 10% decrease in Ω [6], was complemented by the addition of two large-subunit phylogenetic substitutions (V221C/V235I) and the loop that
resides between β-strands A and B of the spinach small
subunit [7,19]. The resultant penta/ABSO enzyme has a
~15% higher Ω value and all other catalytic properties
similar to the spinach enzyme [7]. Although the D470P/
T471A/I472M/K474T quadruple-mutant enzyme, analyzed in the present study, does not have kinetic constants
like those of spinach Rubisco, it does have a 10% increase
in Ω (Table 1). If these carboxy-terminal substitutions
could increase the Ω value of the penta/ABSO enzyme by
10% without substantially altering other kinetic constants, a Chlamydomonas enzyme would be generated with
kinetic properties indistinguishable from those of spinach
Rubisco [7].

Conclusion
Such combinatorial approaches may identify only a small
number of regions responsible for the differences in
kinetic properties between Chlamydomonas and spinach
Rubisco. These regions may then serve as suitable targets
for DNA shuffling and genetic selection aimed at improving Rubisco [20].

Methods
Strains and culture conditions
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 2137 mt+ is the wild-type strain
[15]. Mutant MX3312, which has the rbcL coding region
replaced with the aadA gene conferring spectinomycin
resistance, was used as the host for chloroplast transformation [12,20]. All strains are maintained in darkness at
25°C on medium containing 10 mM acetate and 1.5%
Bacto-agar [15]. For biochemical analysis, cells were
grown in 500 ml of liquid acetate medium at 25°C on a
rotary shaker at 220 rpm in darkness.
Directed mutagenesis and transformation
Using the plasmid pUCrbcLP as a template [21], the
Chlamydomonas rbcL gene was PCR-amplified, with the
first base of the coding region numbered 1, using forward
(bases -169 to -144) and reverse (bases 1404 to 1438)
primers. The reverse primer was designed to change
codons GAT to CCT, ACT to GCT, ATT to ATG, and AAA
to ACA, thereby introducing amino-acid substitutions
D470P, T471A, I472M, and K474T, respectively. The
reverse primer also contained a 2-base change (TT to AA)
following the rbcL stop codon that would introduce a PacI
recognition site. After PCR amplification, the product was
digested with BspEI and PacI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of a modified plasmid containing the same
PacI site (pUCrbcLP-PacI). Chloroplast-gene transformation was performed [22,23], and photosynthesis-compe-

tent colonies were selected on minimal medium with 80
μmol photons/m2/s. Single-colony isolation, followed by
PCR and restriction-enzyme analysis, was performed to
ensure homoplasmicity of the mutant gene, which was
sequenced completely to confirm the mutations.

Biochemical analysis
Cell extracts were prepared from dark-grown cells and
subjected to SDS-PAGE with a 7.5–15% polyacrylamide
gradient [24,25]. The proteins in the gels were either
stained with Coomassie blue [24] or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with rabbit antiChlamydomonas Rubisco IgG (0.5 μg/ml) [19]. Rubiscosubunit IgGs were detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG/alkaline phosphatase conjugate via chemiluminescence
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) [25,19].

Rubisco holoenzyme was purified from cell extracts of
Chlamydomonas and spinach (Spinacea oleracea, described
previously [7]) by sucrose-gradient centrifugation in assay
buffer (50 mM Bicine, pH 8.0, 10 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol) [26]. The kinetic constants of
purified and activated enzymes were determined by measuring the incorporation of acid-stable 14C from
NaH14CO3 [27]. Ω values of the enzymes (10 μg/0.5-ml
reaction) were determined by assaying carboxylase and
oxygenase activities simultaneously with 22 μM [13H]RuBP (15.8 Ci/mol) and 2 mM NaH14CO (5 Ci/mol)
3
in 30-min reactions at 25°C [28,29].
Rubisco thermal stability was assayed by incubating purified and activated enzyme (5 μg) at various temperatures
for 10 min [30]. The samples were then cooled on ice,
incubated at 25°C for 15 min, and used to initiate reactions in 0.5-ml standard assay mixtures containing
NaH14CO3 (2 Ci/mol) and 0.4 mM RuBP [30].
