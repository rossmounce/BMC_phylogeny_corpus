Abstract
Background: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) perform a vital role in disease resistance through their
recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Recent advances in genomics
allow comparison of TLR genes within and between many species. This study takes advantage of
the recently sequenced chicken genome to determine the complete chicken TLR repertoire and
place it in context of vertebrate genomic evolution.
Results: The chicken TLR repertoire consists of ten genes. Phylogenetic analyses show that six of
these genes have orthologs in mammals and fish, while one is only shared by fish and three appear
to be unique to birds. Furthermore the phylogeny shows that TLR1-like genes arose independently
in fish, birds and mammals from an ancestral gene also shared by TLR6 and TLR10. All other TLRs
were already present prior to the divergence of major vertebrate lineages 550 Mya (million years
ago) and have since been lost in certain lineages. Phylogenetic analysis shows the absence of TLRs
8 and 9 in chicken to be the result of gene loss. The notable exception to the tendency of gene loss
in TLR evolution is found in chicken TLRs 1 and 2, each of which underwent gene duplication about
147 and 65 Mya, respectively.
Conclusion: Comparative phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate TLR genes provides insight into
their patterns and processes of gene evolution, with examples of both gene gain and gene loss. In
addition, these comparisons clarify the nomenclature of TLR genes in vertebrates.

Background
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) perform a vital role as sentinels
of the innate immune system in their host organism
through the recognition of pathogen associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs). PAMP recognition is achieved through
binding to the extracellular leucine rich repeat (LRR) containing domain, specific to each receptor type [1]. In

response to ligand binding, signalling is activated by the
cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin I resistance (TIR) domain
resulting in an inflammatory response and release of
inflammatory cytokines. This is an evolutionarily highly
conserved domain, present in a wide range of taxa from
plants to animals indicating the first Toll-like gene existed

in the unicellular ancestor of plants and animals over 1
billion years ago [2-6,1].

presence of duplicated genes as being separate genes and
not splice variants of the same gene.

The first Toll gene to be discovered was in Drosophila melanogaster, which encodes a receptor involved in developmental patterning, but more importantly also in
resistance to fungal infections [7]. In animals, these genes
can be sub-divided into two simple categories based on
taxonomy; the Toll genes of Protostome taxa and the TLRs
of Deuterostomes [5,6]. It is likely that Toll originally had
a purely developmental role and that this during the
course of evolution became combined with disease resistance functions in coelomate organisms, to protect the
body cavity from infectious pathogens [3,5].

Aims
The major aims of this investigation were to determine
what TLRs are present in chicken and determine where
unmapped TLR genes are located. These data then allowed
us to define orthologs in other species and examine TLR
gene family evolution using phylogenetic methods. These
analyses allowed us to characterise the variation within
and between vertebrate lineages, as well as the dynamics
of TLR gene gain/gene loss. In addition, TLR gene nomenclature issues were also addressed.

Results
Although TLRs have been identified in many animal lineages the majority of research has been carried out on eutherian mammals, especially humans and mice [8,9]. In
recent years, however, advances in teleost genomics have
led to the rapid discovery of TLR genes in fugu and
zebrafish [10-12]. Moreover, recent analyses of chicken
ESTs and genome sequences have revealed TLRs in
chicken [13-17].
Gene gain and gene loss are important evolutionary processes, especially with respect to gene family dynamics [1822]. Gene duplication is believed to be the principal cause
by which new genes are created. Gene gain can occur
either on a large scale from a whole genome duplication
or on a small scale when chromosomal sections or individual genes are copied. Single gene duplications occur by
tandem duplications as a result of either unequal crossing
over or by retrotransposition [19]. Retrogenes are clearly
recognised by their lack of introns and are often found to
be non-functional paralogs, as regulatory sequences are
usually missing [23]. Gene gain is frequently followed by
differential gene loss either by mutation in one gene isoform leading to the creation of a pseudogene or by complete deletion [24-26]. It is believed that gene deletion
closely follows duplication in the majority of cases [27].
The process of gene gain and gene loss is believed to occur
at a constant rate with the exception of an episode of
whole genome duplication in vertebrates ~500 Mya [22].
On occasions where both genes remain active one may be
freed from purifying selection and be able to evolve a new
function, or it may retain its original function but alter its
tissue expression profile [18,28,26].
To define TLR orthologs and uncover the pattern of gene
duplication and/or gene loss in vertebrate lineages, we
performed a phylogenetic analysis of all known TLR
sequences. Our results confirm all of the chicken TLR
genes found in previous studies [13-17] and do not detect
any more. Our findings also confirm and extend the
sequence and structure of these genes and corroborate the

Definition of orthologs and TLR gene nomenclature
Sequences newly identified as TLRs and those that have
previously been named are listed in Table 1. Suggested
alterations to nomenclature are devised in accordance
with the standards of human genome nomenclature. Of
particular note is the sequence Genbank: AY531552,
which has sometimes previously been described as mouse
TLR11 [29,30] although it shares its sequence with Genbank: AK136724, AK143385 and AY510705, all of which
are described as TLR12. Phylogenetic and structural analyses combined with gene mapping data in mouse and rat
have led to this investigation regarding AY531552 as
mouse TLR12. Our phylogenetic analyses showed the
Lethenteron japonicum (lamprey) TLRs to be duplicated
forms of TLR14 and various fish TLRs to be TLR22. A TLR5
in Xenopus laevis was also defined [Genbank: BC084773].
TLR gene discovery in chicken and other vertebrates
We used a total of 143 non-redundant TLR sequences
(Additional file 1) in this study, representing 26 TLR genes
from 30 different species as described in Table 2.

This investigation confirms the presence of the 10 TLRs in
the chicken found in previous studies [13-17] and found
no further TLRs. This is the same number as found in
human and two fewer than in mouse. Chicken TLRs 3, 4,
5 and 7 are directly orthologus to those found in other
vertebrates. The duplicated genes, TLRs 2A and 2B found
in the chicken are both orthologs of the single TLR2 of
mammals. Chicken TLR21 is an ortholog of TLR21 in fish
and amphibians. It appears that TLRs 1LA, 1LB and 15 are
unique to birds (see Tables 2 and 3).
The chicken TLR repertoire contains tandem duplications
of the genes for TLRs 1L and 2 [31,17]. A partial sequence
of chicken TLR1LB has been described previously by Yilmaz et al. [17]. Using RT-PCR we have sequenced and
cloned the full length mRNA [Genbank: DQ518918]. This
sequence includes two further exons which, although
transcribed, are not translated. Using synonymous substi-

tution rates (see Materials and Methods) we estimated the
gene duplication events that gave rise to TLR1LA, 1LB and
2A, 2B to have taken place 147 and 66 Mya respectively.
The chicken is also found to be missing a number of TLRs,
which are present in most mammals. The TLR7, 8 and 9
subfamily is present in fish and mammals but is only represented by TLR7 in the chicken [14,16,17]. TLR8 is
present as a pseudogene [32] and TLR9 has been deleted.
Genetic Mapping of chicken TLR1LA and B genes
The chromosomal locations of most chicken TLRs are
known [17], with the exception of TLR1LA and TLR1LB
which, based on a single sequence contig [Genbank:
NW_001471687] map close together on an unmapped
chromosome [17]. Sequencing of a genomic fragment
from TLR1LB locus from parents of the East Lansing reference mapping cross, identified two SNPs in TLR1LB.
Genetic linkage analysis of TLR1LB showed linkage to
chromosome 4 (see Table 3).
Structural analysis of proteins and selective constraints on
functional domains
Comparisons of structural predictions for the chicken
TLRs show them to have a varied structure [17]. The newly
discovered TLR15 has the unusual feature of many LRRs
clustered towards the C-terminus of the molecule and few
at the N-terminus (Figure 1). TLR7 has the uncharacteristic feature of a splice variant with two predicted transmembrane (TM) domains only previously found in mammalian TLR6 (see Additional file 2). The predicted structure of the TLR1LB fragment described by Yilmaz et al.
[17] is shown to have a further predicted TM domain
towards the N-terminus whereas the majority of TLRs
have a single TM domain between the extracellular and

intracellular domains (Additional File 2). The predicted
structure of this TLR is otherwise very similar to TLR1LA
only missing the two LRRs at the N-terminus (see Figure
1). By contrast the duplications of TLR2 are marked by the
absence of an LRR from TLR2A, which is present in all
other known TLR2s (Additional File 2).
Phylogeny of vertebrate TLRs
Molecular phylogenies based on sequence alignments are
only as accurate as the alignment data from which they are
produced; consequently it is important that the alignment
data quality is determined [33-35]. In order to assess the
alignment's tree like structure, likelihood mapping was
carried out and showed the sequence alignment data to
have strong phylogenetic signal (Figure 2). Both phylogenetic methods used produced near identical topologies,
which were strongly supported with bootstrapping (see
Figures 3 and 4). Close up images of individual clades in
Fig. 3 are shown in Additional files 4, 5 and 6. Close up
images of individual clades in Fig. 4 are shown in Additional files 7, 8 and 9.

The majority of TLRs form specific clades, with each species containing one copy of each receptor (e.g. TLRs 3, 4
and 5). The main exception to this trend is the assemblage
of receptors named TLR1, which have independently
evolved in fish, Xenopus, chicken, opossum and eutherian mammals (see Figures 3 and 4). These genes are not
orthologs but have often been given the same name,
which creates some confusion (see Table 1). The same is
true for TLR5S in fish, where a soluble TLR5 has independently evolved in different fish species [36] (see Figures 3
and 4). The presence of most TLR gene families across so
great a range of vertebrate taxa indicates that the majority

of TLR families must have been established prior to the
evolutionary radiation of vertebrates in the Cambrian
Period 540-505 Mya [37].
Phylogenetic analyses show that chicken TLR21 is an
ortholog of fugu and Xenopus TLR21. Chicken TLR15
shares a clade with TLRs 1, 2, 6, 10 and 14 (Figures 3 and
4), but the precise nature of this relationship remains
unresolved due to the small number sequences available.
TLRs 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 form a clade that mainly follow the
expected species tree; the exceptions to this being the loss
of chicken TLRs 8 and 9 and the gain of soluble versions
of TLR5 in teleost fish. Gene gain has been comparatively
common in the clade consisting of TLRs 2, 14 and the 1,
6, 10 assemblage. The TLRs in this clade are found to
respond to bacterial pathogens, and in mammals and
chicken have been shown to function heterodimerically
[3,38].

No specific ligand has been identified for the clade containing TLR 13, 21 and 22 (Table 2). The neighbour joining tree (Figure 3) attaches the TLR 11–12 clade to this
group. The positioning of this clade is not as well supported by neighbour joining as it is using maximum parsimony, which places the TLR11–12 clade basal to the
TLR3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 group (Figure 4). Both the TLR11–12
clade and TLR13-21-22 clade share a history of multiple
gene loss events. TLRs 14, 22 and 23 have been found to
have been lost from all land animals (see Figures 3 and 4).

Discussion
Structural and phylogenetic analyses suggest the chicken
TLR repertoire to consist of ten genes. Phylogenetic analyses show these to consist of six orthologs of mammals and
fish, one fish ortholog and three unique to chicken. Chromosome mapping of chicken TLR genes shows them to be
in syntenic positions compared to other animals. Half of
the chicken TLR genes are located on chromosome 4

fied but TLR9 in chicken has been lost leaving only flanking regions where the TLR9 locus is predicted [32].
Phylogenetic analyses of the Toll-like receptor gene family
There have been previous phylogenetic analyses of TLR
data [4,10,15,17]. Since the inclusion of more sequences
improves the data quality of the alignment and consequently the phylogenies produced [19,39], this investigation has been able to improve on phylogenetic analyses
carried out by previous studies owing to the increased
number of sequences available. This is corroborated by
the likelihood mapping analysis (Figure 2) and the high
bootstrap values by both neighbour joining (Figure 3)
and parsimony (Figure 4) methods for the major TLR family groups.

Figure 2
Likelihood map of TLR protein alignment
Likelihood map of TLR protein alignment. The high
density of points in the apexes of the triangle indicates the
strong amount of structure and therefore great suitability for
phylogenetic analysis.

(Table 3). This large proportion of TLR genes on a single
chromosome is due in part to the gene duplication TLRs
1L and 2 in the chicken (Figures 3 and 4). The homologues of these TLR genes in the human also map to a single chromosome [17] although this tendency is not found
in other vertebrates.
Comparison of the predicted structure of Toll-like
receptors
From protein alignments as well as SMART predictions it
is evident that the TIR domain is highly conserved across
many different receptor families whereas the extracellular
LRR region shows great variation in the positioning of
LRRs between receptors although a strong level of structural conservation across taxa for a given receptor (see
Additional File 2).

Chicken TLR7 has a predicted TM domain at the C-terminus as have the majority of TLRs, but also has an extra TM
domain at the N-terminus. Similarly an extra TM domain
at the N-terminus tip is predicted for Chicken TLR1LB as
well as TLR6, a receptor present only in eutherian mammals. A TM domain is predicted at the N-terminal in fugu
TLR1 but in this case the usual TM domain is not found at
the C-terminal (Additional File 2). As the predicted N-terminal TM domain of TLR 1LB is also found in a number
of related TLRs it is possible that this is a conserved feature. However, the absence of such a predicted structure
from all examples of TLR7 other than chicken may mean
that this feature is a result of the SMART program falsely
interpreting a hydrophobic region. A pseudogene caused
by an insertion event for TLR8 in chicken has been identi-

Also very similar trees are produced from neighbour joining and maximum parsimony analyses (Figures 3 and 4).
Gain of Toll-like receptor genes
The vast majority of duplications of whole TLR genes
occurring since the Cambrian period have occurred in the
clade containing TLRs 1, 2, 6 and 10. The first of these
took place 300 Mya leading to the establishment of TLR
10 in the lineage that gave rise to the mammals. This was
followed by TLRs 1 and 6 in the eutherian mammals 130
Mya [4]; data which are supported by Figures 3, 4 and
Roach et al. [15]. A further duplication has occurred 147
Mya in the lineage that gave rise to modern birds, leading
to avian TLR1LA and TLR1LB followed by the latest duplication 65 Mya producing TLR2A and TLR2B in the
chicken. The duplication of TLR2 in the chicken lineage is
not a unique event, other independent duplication events
of TLR2 have occurred in X. tropicalis (Figures 3 and 4), the
American alligator [4] and the ancestor of marsupial and
eutherian mammals [15] the timing of these duplications,
however, remains unknown.

All of the LRRs of TLR1LA are in positions shared by
closely related TLRs (Additional File 2). The much shorter
TLR1LB has an almost identical 3' sequence and structure,
but the two 5' exons and the start of the third and final
exon are disrupted by stop codons and frame shifts. A start
codon is found a short way into the third exon producing
a product lacking the two N-terminal LRRs and including
an extra predicted TM domain. The predicted structure of
this receptor is the same as that reported in Yilmaz et al.
[17] although the complete coding sequence of this gene
is now complete (this paper) [GenBank: DQ518918].
Loss of Toll-like receptor genes
Compared to the paucity of gene gain in the evolution of
the TLR family there are many instances of gene loss. TLRs
14, 22 and 23 are not found in any land dwelling vertebrates and TLR4 has been lost in the majority of studied

fish species, yet is preserved in land animals. TLRs 11, 12
and 13 found in a small number of animals are lost in
birds and many mammals, however a pseudogene for
human TLR12 has been reported [30]. Although TLR19 of
the zebrafish and TLR16 of X. tropicalis clearly represent
ancestral sequences of TLRs 11 and 12 (see Figures 3 and
4), there is no trace of a receptor of this kind to be found
either in other fish, mammals or the chicken. This indicates that members of this group must have been lost on
more that one occasion. Functional genes for TLRs 8 and
9 are absent from the chicken; TLR8 is present as a pseudogene [32] and TLR9 has been deleted from the genome.
The inclusion of certain taxonomic groups would assist in
our understanding of these gene losses. The inclusion of
fish species (other than the ray-finned fish) and more
basal tetrapods (squamata, anapsida etc.) would help to
give a more precise idea of the point at which TLRs 22, 14
and 19 were lost.

Conclusion
We found chicken to have a total of ten TLRs, the same
number as in humans but with only five human
orthologs. Phylogenetic analyses show TLR families to be
of ancient origin, predating the divergence of major vertebrate lineages. The chicken genome highlights recent
instances of both gene loss and gene gain within TLRs
which allows an insight into the patterns and processes of
gene family evolution.

Methods
Sequence databases
Candidate chicken TLR genes were identified using extensive searches for sequence homology using BLAST started
by using the mouse and human sequences identified in
Smith et al. [16] and the TIR protein consensus sequence
from Meijer et al. [10] in the NCBI database [40] and the
Ensembl genome browser [41]. Full coding region nucleotide and corresponding protein sequences were collected

for as great a taxonomic range as possible as this improves
the validity of the phylogenetic analysis [39]. Collected
sequences were used in BLAST searches both into specific
genomes and the general sequence database with the
intention of identifying all available TLR sequences.
The full sequence for chicken TLR1LB was determined
using the original version of partial sequence Genbank:
AY633573, the contig Genbank: NW_001471687 (the
details described in Yilmaz et al. [17]) and EST Genbank:
CD762233. The complete sequence was confirmed by
sequencing cDNA fragments produced by RT-PCR (for list
of primers see Additional File 3). To ensure that all
chicken TLRs had been identified, Hidden Markov models
(HMMs) were used to analyse the chicken genome [42].
When expected TLR homologues were found to be absent
from the chicken (e.g. TLR9), the sequence contig for the
expected chromosomal region was identified to ensure

that the absence of a TLR was not the result of a gap in the
genome sequence.
Bioinformatics
Complete protein sequences were assembled and labelled
in BioEdit [43] before being aligned using ClustalX [44].
This program automatically produces a phylogeny that
can be viewed in TreeView [45], which can be used as a
rough guide although it is not suitable for in depth phylogenetic investigation [33]. The alignment was checked by
visual inspection. To ensure that the alignment dataset
was suitable for phylogenetic analyses likelihood mapping was carried out using the program TreePuzzle [46].
This method, although little used, is of great value for confirming the suitability of a dataset for use in tree building
[35]. Likelihood mapping works by breaking down the
alignment into quartets of sequences and assessing the
likelihood of their three possible phylogenetic topologies.

This information is displayed as points in an equilateral
triangle where points located in the apexes represent
strong 'tree like' phylogenetic signal, points between
apexes give equal likelihood for two different tree topologies and points in the centre indicating 'star like' evolution
[35,46,47].
A convenient way to infer events of gene duplication and
gene loss is to note to what extent the gene phylogenies
match the expected species phylogeny [20,21,48]. Incongruence in the close association between the two can usually be explained by episodes of gene duplication and/or
gene loss in a given lineage [18,20,21,34,48]. Gene duplication followed by positive natural selection is seen as the
principle means by which new gene functions arise
[26,49]. A study relating to the evolution of gene families
on the chordates found the majority of duplications to
have occurred early in chordate evolution. This can be easily maintained by the similarity between the orthologous
genes in different species being greater than that found
between members of the same gene family in the same
species [50,51].
Phylogenies were created in PAUP [52] using both parsimony and neighbour-joining methods. These two methods are used as each one analyses the data in different
ways [19,33]. Consequently, if tree topology is not shared
by both methods it shows that these relationships may
not represent evolutionary heritage. To determine the support for individual clades, 1000 bootstrap replicates were
carried out on the trees produced by each method [53].
The structure of chicken TLRs was predicted using the
SMART program [54] to analyse full length amino acid
sequences.
RNA extraction and tissue sources
Tissues were collected and stored at -80°C from a Gallus
gallus broiler presumed to be healthy. All tissues were
ground under liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar.
100 mg samples of each tissue were trizol extracted and
RNA quantified using a bench top spectrophotometer. To
ensure RNA extractions were free from genomic DNA contamination, RNase free DNase (Promega) was used in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RNA
samples were reverse transcribed using SuperScript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Carlsbad CA) following
the manufacturers guidelines, including the use of RNase
H to remove complimentary RNA from the newly synthesised cDNA. All cDNAs were standardised using RT-PCR
against the reference gene, GAPDH and the absence of
contamination determined by the absence of bands in
samples that had not undergone reverse transcription.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/62

Reverse-transctriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and PCR
PCR was carried out in 10 μl volumes consisting of 10 pg
template, 10× dNTPs (2 mM each), 10× PCR buffer, 5×
GC solution, 0.4 U Taq and 5 pM each primer. List of
primer sets used is shown in Additional file 3. PCR conditions for all reactions were as follows: 15 min 95°C followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 30
seconds and 72°C for one minute followed by an extension step of 72°C for 5 minutes. Amplified PCR products
were run by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide and visualised using an ultra violet transilluminator.
DNA sequencing
As the sequence of TLR1LB was unclear from sequence
files and EST data, the full sequence was confirmed using
primers shown in Additional File 3. To improve sequence
quality of TLR1LB TOP sequence (see Additional File 3)
we collected PCR products from agarose gels using the
QIAEXII gel extraction kit (Qiagen Hilden). Inserts were
grown in bacterial colonies on agar plates before colonies
were inoculated into LB medium and plasmids purified
using the QIAprep Miniprep kit (Qiagen Hilden). For all
other sequences (those used in the SNP analysis) PCR
products were purified using ExoSap and sequenced in
both directions using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle
sequencing kit.
Genetic linkage mapping of Toll-like receptor genes
Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the TLR1LB expression fragment (for primer list
see Additional File 3) from Red Jungle Fowl and White
Leghorn parent birds [55]. Sequences from offspring were
sequenced and genotyped and these data used for genetic
mapping. TLR1LA is known to map closely to TLR1LB
[Genbank: NW_001471687]. Consequently this information can map both genes. The map locations of other
chicken TLRs was determined using cDNA sequences in a
BLAT search on the UCSC genome browser [56]. The
sequence for chicken TLR2B was shown to contain a gap
of unidentified nucleotides. This region was sequenced in
both versions of TLR2 and the gap found to be an assembly artefact on both the February 2004 and May 2006
genome builds [Genbank: EF595650].
Calculation of time of divergence of duplicated genes
Nucleotide alignments of chicken TLR duplications were
created using DAMBE [57] which aligns nucleotide
sequences to the protein alignment one codon at a time,
thus allowing functionally similar areas of each gene to
remain aligned and not become victim of codon slippage.
Non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous sequence divergence (dS) were estimated with the codeml program in
PAML [58] in Runmode = -2 with codonfreq = 2 using the
Goldman and Yang [59] substitution model. The substitu-

tion rates were estimated using the nucleotide frequencies
at each codon position using the F3 × 4 model [58] to estimate the expected codon frequencies.

In order to get an estimate of the age of these duplications
(T) the equation, r = K/(2T) [24] was used, where r is the
neutral substitution rate per site per year and K is the total
synonymous sequence divergence (dS) for the total
aligned sequence (0.4119 and 0.184 for TLRs 1 like and 2
respectively). We used an overall estimate of r = 1.4 × 109 that we obtained by dividing the autosomal sequence
divergence between chicken and turkey (0.1008) from
Axelsson et al. [60] with the time of divergence between
chicken and turkey of 28 × 106 – 45 × 106[61,62].
