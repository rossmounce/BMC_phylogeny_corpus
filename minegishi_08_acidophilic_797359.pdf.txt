Abstract
Haloarchaeal strains require high concentrations of NaCl for their growth, with optimum
concentrations of 10–30%. They display a wide variety of morphology and physiology including pH
range for growth. Many strains grow at neutral to slightly alkaline pH, and some only at alkaline pH.
However, no strain has been reported to grow only in acidic pH conditions within the family
Halobacteriaceae.
In this study, we isolated many halophiles capable of growth in a 20% NaCl medium adjusted to pH
4.5 from 28 commercially available salts. They showed growth at pH 4.0 to 6.5, depending slightly
on the magnesium content. The most acidophilic strain MH1-52-1 isolated from an imported solar
salt (pH of saturated solution was 9.0) was non-pigmented and extremely halophilic. It was only
capable of growing at pH 4.2–4.8 with an optimum at pH 4.4 in a medium with 0.1% magnesium
chloride, and at pH 4.0–6.0 (optimum at pH 4.0) in a medium with 5.0% magnesium. The 16S rRNA
and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit B' gene sequences demonstrated clearly that the
strain MH1-52-1 represents a new genus in the family Halobacteriaceae.

Findings
Halophilic archaea are classified within the order Halobacteriales, family Halobacteriaceae, which consists of a
number of aerobic extreme halophiles that live in hypersaline environments such as salt lakes, salterns, solar salts,
and subsurface salt formation. They require high concentration of NaCl for growth, with optimum concentrations
of 10–30%. Currently, the family Halobacteriaceae contains 27 genera comprising 95 species that display a wide
variety of physiological characteristics including ranges of
salinity, temperature, pH etc. for growth. Optimal growth
of these haloarchaea has been reported to occur at either
neutral or alkaline pH. Halococcus hamelinensis 100A6T

and Halococcus qingdaonensis CM5T were reported to be
able to grow at pH 4.0–9.0, with an optimum at pH 6.0
[1,2]. However, no strain has been reported to grow only
in acidic pH conditions. In this study, we attempted to
isolate moderately acidophilic haloarchaea from solar salt
samples.
We collected 240 natural sea salts and rock salts available
in Japan. Many samples (85) were solar salts, either
imported from Australia, France, Mexico, etc. (72 samples), or produced in Japan (13 samples). Fourteen samples were re-crystallized in Japan from the imported solar
salts. Fifty three samples were rock salts imported from

Bolivia, China, Italy, etc., and 62 were salts produced in
Japan from seawater by boiling. Details of the other 26
samples were not clear, since there were no detailed
descriptions of the origin on the labels.
We designed a medium MH1 of the following composition (per liter) for enrichment cultures: 4.0 g casamino
acids (Difco), 2.0 g yeast extract (Difco), 2.0 g L-glutamic
acid, 2.0 g trisodium citrate·H2O, 5.0 g K2SO4, 1.0 g
MgCl2·6H2O, 1.0 g NH4Cl, 1.0 g KH2PO4, 4 mg
Fe2SO4·6H2O, 200 g NaCl, 2.0 ml trace metal solution,
pH adjusted to 4.5 with 40% KOH and 20 g Bacto-agar
(Difco) when necessary. The trace metal solution contained (per liter of distilled water): 2.0 g Na2S2O3·5H2O,
1.0 g CaCl2·2H2O, 0.3 g CoCl2·6H2O, 0.1 g
BaCl2·2H2O, 0.1 g MnCl2·4H2O, 0.1 g ZnCl2, 0.1 g
Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.1 g NiCl2·6H2O, 0.04 g AlCl3, 0.02 g
Na2WO4·2H2O, 0.02 g H3BO4, pH adjusted to 4.0 with
HCl. The medium was autoclaved for 20 min at 121°C.
The salts samples (1.0 g each) were dissolved in 4 ml of
MH1 liquid medium. After incubation at 37°C for 1 week
without shaking, 0.1 ml of each sample were spread
evenly on the MH1 agar plate (pH 4.5) with a spreader.
After incubation at 37°C for 2 weeks, colonies were
picked, transferred to fresh agar plates of the same pH,
and pure cultures were obtained by plating serial dilutions
and repeated transfers on the agar plates.
Growth of isolated strains was determined by inoculating
pre-cultures of purified strains into test tubes (φ24 × 200
mm) each containing 10 ml liquid media with varying pH
(3.0–7.8) and shaken at 37°C with 100 strokes per min.
When necessary, growth was monitored by taking 0.1 ml
culture broth periodically and measuring absorbance at
600 nm in a 10 mm light path cuvette. After cultivation for
108 hours, 0.1 ml of culture was spread on MH1 agar
plates (pH 4.4) and incubated at 37°C for 7 days.
Total DNA was extracted by the method of Cline et al. [3].
The 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR with the following forward and reverse primers for Archaea: 5'-ATTCCGGTTGATCCTGCCGG
and
5'AGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCAG. The amplified genes
were cloned into pCR2.1 T-vector (Invitrogen) and 6
clones were sequenced using the Big Dye Sequencing Kit
Ver. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) using an ABI 310 DNA
sequencer. The 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from
the DNA Data Bank of Japan [4] were aligned using the
CLUSTAL × Multiple Sequence Alignment Program [5].
The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by the neighborjoining method [6] and was evaluated by bootstrap sampling [7], expressed as percentages of 1000 replicates.

Twenty eight out of 240 salt samples gave colonies on the
first enrichment cultures at pH 4.5. Ten samples were
imported solar salts, 6 were rock salts, 2 were salts prepared from imported solar salts (dissolved in seawater
and boiled for several hours), and 6 were salts produced
in Japan from seawater by boiling. Details of 4 samples
were not clear. More than 50 strains were isolated, and
they were tested for the ability to grow at pH 4.5–7.0.
Most strains grew at pH range of 4.5–6.0, and none of
them showed growth at pH higher than 6.5.
The most acidophilic strain was MH1-52-1 isolated from
'Sango no shio', 'Salt of Coral' in English. According to the
manufacture's information (Ochiai.com Co. Japan), the
salt is a solar salt imported from Australia, to which powdered coral has been added. The pH of 25% aqueous solution of this salt was 9.0. The strain could grow at pH from
4.2 to 4.8, with optimal growth at pH 4.4–4.6 (Fig. 1B).
Almost no growth was obtained at pH lower than 4.0 (Fig.
1A) and higher than pH 5.0 (Fig. 1C–D), demonstrating
that the strain MH1-52-1 was moderately acidophilic [8].
The number of surviving cells after cultivation for 108
hours were determined. No colonies were obtained on
MH1 agar plates (pH 4.4) from cultures at pH lower than
4.0 and pH higher than 5.8, suggesting that the slight
increase in OD660 (Fig. 1C–D may be owing to formation
of insoluble materials during shaking at 37°C.
Growth of the strain MH1-52-1 in media with increased
MgCl2·6H2O content was also measured. In media with
50 g per liter, growth was observed at pH 4.0–6.0 with
optimum at pH 4.0. The trouble was that crystalline precipitates appeared during cultivation at pH 4.5 or higher,
making it impossible to measure the cell density spectrophotometrically. It may be correct to point out that a JCM
medium No.168, which supports growth of many haloarchaeal strains, of the following composition (5.0 g
casamino acids, 5.0 g yeast extract, 1.0 g sodium glutamate, 3.0 g trisodium citrate·2H2O, 20.0 g M2SO4·7H2O,
2.0 g KCl, 36 mg FeCl2·4H2O, 0.36 mg MnCl2·4H2O,
200 g NaCl, per liter), but adjusted to pH 4.5 did not support growth of the MH1-52-1. This fact suggests that some
components of the medium MH1 (KH2PO4 or metal solution) is crucial for the growth at acidic pH. The following
experiments were thus done in the MH1 medium with 1.0
g MgCl2·6H2O per liter.
Colonies of the strain MH1-52-1 on 2% agar plate were
circular, smooth, non-pigmented after incubation for 7
days at 37°C. Cells were non-motile and pleomorphic,
with triangular and disc morphology and lysed in distillated water. The range of NaCl concentration for growth
was 10 to 28% (optimum at 20% NaCl), suggesting that
this strain was extremely halophilic.

Growth curves (A-D) of strain MH1-52-1 at 37°C in MH1 media adjusted to various pH.
Roughly 500 bp (from 6 to 500, E. coli numbering) of 16S
rRNA gene sequence of 51 strains were determined, and
complete sequences of the strain MH1-52-1 and three
more representative strains, MH1-16-3 (isolated from a
solar salt in Philippines), MH1-34-1 (solar salt from Indonesia), and MH1-136-2 (solar salt in Japan) were determined. The 3 strains could grow at pH 4.5 to 6.0, with
optimal growth at pH 5.0–5.5. The 4 sequences differed
each other by at least 2%. The sequence of strain MH1-521 (AB371717) was most close to that of Halobacterium
noricense A1T (AJ548827), with 91.7% similarity. A phylogenetic tree reconstructed by NJ method (See additional
file 1) suggested that strain MH1-52-1 and the other three
strains may represent a novel genus of the family Halobacteriaceae. Many isolates (25) clustered very closely with
MH1-52-1 as judged from 500 bp of 16S rRNA sequences,
while other isolates formed a cluster with MH1-16-3 (18
related isolates) or MH1-34-1 (4 related isolates).
Recently, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit B'
gene and protein sequences have been used as an alternative molecular marker in phylogenetic analysis of the fam-

ily Halobacteriaceae [9,10]. Our unpublished data of the
sequences of RNA polymerase H, B" and B' genes of all
species of the family Halobacteriaceae (manuscript in preparation) also suggested that the strain MH1-52-1 was a
representative of a novel genus.
According to Johnson [8], there is no common agreement
on the pH boundary which delineates acidophily, but a
useful guide is that extreme acidophiles have optimum
pH for growth of < 3.0 and that moderate acidophiles
grow optimally at pH 3–5. Currently, no strain has been
reported to grow optimally at pH 3–5 within the family
Halobacteriaceae. The type strains of Hcc. hamelinensis and
Hcc. qingdaonensis, which were reported to grow at pH
4.0–9.0 [1,2], did not grow at pH 4.5 and 6.0 in our MH1
liquid medium.
Acidic hypersaline lakes are known to be distributed in
southern western Australia [11]. They are ephemeral, shallow, have pHs ranging from 1.5 to 4.0, and precipitate
halite and/or gypsum in siliciclastic-hosted sediments.
Although acidophilic haloarchaea capable of growth at

pH 3 [8] have not been isolated, our present data suggest
these acidic saline environments may be habitats of these
interesting halophiles.
This is the first report on moderately acidophilic haloarchaeon.
