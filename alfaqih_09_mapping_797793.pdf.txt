Abstract
Background: Rainbow trout have an XX/XY genetic mechanism of sex determination where
males are the heterogametic sex. The homology of the sex-determining gene (SDG) in medaka to
Dmrt1 suggested that SDGs evolve from downstream genes by gene duplication. Orthologous
sequences of the major genes of the mammalian sex determination pathway have been reported in
the rainbow trout but the map position for the majority of these genes has not been assigned.
Results: Five loci of four candidate genes (Amh, Dax1, Dmrt1 and Sox6) were tested for linkage to
the Y chromosome of rainbow trout. We exclude the role of all these loci as candidates for the
primary SDG in this species. Sox6i and Sox6ii, duplicated copies of Sox6, mapped to homeologous
linkage groups 10 and 18 respectively. Genotyping fishes of the OSU × Arlee mapping family for
Sox6i and Sox6ii alleles indicated that Sox6i locus might be deleted in the Arlee lineage.
Conclusion: Additional candidate genes should be tested for their linkage to the Y chromosome.
Mapping data of duplicated Sox6 loci supports previously suggested homeology between linkage
groups 10 and 18. Enrichment of the rainbow trout genomic map with known gene markers allows
map comparisons with other salmonids. Mapping of candidate sex-determining loci is important for
analyses of potential autosomal modifiers of sex-determination in rainbow trout.

Background
Teleost fishes have a variety of evolutionarily labile sexdetermination systems and relatively undifferentiated sex
chromosomes [1], and thus are interesting research models for the exploration of how sex-determining mechanisms evolve. The current view of the sex-determination
cascade describes it as a gene hierarchy [2]. Genes that
reside on top of this hierarchy have been recruited only
relatively recently [3] and are only found in specific

branches of the phylogenetic tree. Downstream genes are
conserved between the different phyla, regardless of the
sex-determination mechanism, and thus seem to have
been present for a much longer time. The recent discovery
that the sex-determining gene of the medaka, Dmy, is a
homologue of a downstream gene of the pathway in
mammalian species [4] led researchers to propose that
downstream genes can be recruited to the top of the hierarchy by gene duplication [5]. This model of evolution of

the sex-determining gene cascade is further supported in
the tilapia model (Oreochromis spp) where the two downstream genes in mammals, Amh and Dmrta2, map within
quantitative trait loci, QTL, regions for sex determination
in that genus [6].
The salmonid fish, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
has several parallels to the medaka. Both have an XX-XY
genetic sex-determination system with the male being the
heterogametic sex [7-9] and in both species the sex chromosomes are at an early stage of evolution [8-12]. The sexdetermining mechanism in the rainbow trout is believed
to function via a 'dominant' factor located on the Y chromosome as evidenced by the production of XXY triploid
males [13]. Dmy, the sex-determining gene in the medaka,
also appears to function as a dominant factor. This is supported by male phenotypic development of genetically
female (XX) medaka fish injected with a genomic clone
containing the Dmy sequence [14].
Based on the proposed model for evolution of sex-determining gene cascades, we hypothesized that in a tetraploid-derived organism like the rainbow trout [15] which
has a high repertoire of duplicated genes, any gene in the
sex differentiation cascade, or its' homologue, could
potentially have evolved as a sex- determining gene. Based
on what we currently know from the two sex-determining
genes discovered to date in vertebrates, Sry in mammals
and Dmy, in the medaka, a sex-determining gene (1) has
an upstream position in the cascade, (2) shows stronger
expression in male gonads as compared to female, (3) is
expressed before sexual differentiation of the gonad and
(4) is linked to the Y chromosome. We investigated several candidate genes for sex determination in the rainbow
trout model by testing for Y-linkage.
Orthologous sequences of the major genes of the mammalian sex determination pathway have been reported in
the rainbow trout; including Wt1, Sox9, Dmrt1, Amh and
Dax1. Three Wt1 loci [16], and three Sox9 loci (Alfaqih et
al. Submitted) have been previously mapped by our laboratory, but none of the loci were linked to the Y chromosome. In the present study, we tested for linkage of four
additional candidate genes for sex determination (Sox6,
Dmrt1, Dax1 and Amh) to the Y chromosome of rainbow

trout. As we will show, our results have eliminated these
loci as candidates for the primary sex-determining gene in
the rainbow trout. We also identified a duplication of Sox6
and discuss the inheritance of the duplicated Sox6 loci in
our mapping families. In addition, we report the complete
genomic sequence of Dax1 and a promoter subsequence
analysis of Dax1 and Dmrt1 that implicates the role of
Pax2 in trout testicular differentiation.

Results and discussion
Linkage analysis of Amh, Dax1 and Dmrt1
Through comparison of rainbow trout Amh cDNA
sequence with zebrafish (Danio rerio) orthologous
genomic sequences, it was determined that the Amh gene
of rainbow trout and zebrafish both have six tentative
introns. We amplified, cloned and sequenced a 1.35 kb
genomic fragment that contained the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th
introns of Amh from the OSU and Arlee rainbow trout
clonal lines (the presence of the 1st and 2nd introns
remains tentative and still requires experimental verification). Intron sizes were 337 bp, 87 bp, 105 bp and 91 bp
respectively. Comparison of OSU and Arlee intron
sequences indicated the presence of a SNP in the 5th intron
of OSU in a Tsp509I restriction site (Table 1). PCR-RFLP
with Tsp509I was used to genotype doubled haploids of
the O × A mapping family for receiving either allele. Linkage analysis assigned Amh to linkage group 8 (Figure 1),
which corresponds to the short arm of chromosome 5 in
the karyotype [17].

Prior to this study, the sequence of the first exon and part
of the sequence of the second exon of rainbow trout Dax1
was deposited in nucleotide databases as an expressed
sequence tag, EST [Genbank: BX298095]. In order to look
for sequence polymorphisms, more likely to be found in
non-coding regions of the gene, we isolated and
sequenced a complete genomic clone of the Dax1 gene
[Genbank: FJ617278]. Tentative locations of the start
codon, stop codon and exon-intron boundaries were
inferred based on sequence alignment with cDNA
sequences of Dax1 from Dicentrarchus labrax [Genbank:
AJ633646] and Oreochromis niloticus [Genbank:
AY135397] and were not experimentally verified. Our
sequence alignment indicated that the coding region of
Dax1 contains an ORF of 909 bp and is organized into

two exons (670 and 239 bp in size respectively) separated
by a 560 bp intron. A 303 amino acid polypeptide was
deduced from the inferred cDNA sequence.
No polymorphism between parental lines of our mapping
family was detected in the intron, thus a 1.1 kb fragment
of the genomic region located upstream to the putative
coding sequence of Dax1 was amplified and sequenced to
look for sequence polymorphisms. An (A/G) SNP
between OSU and HC parental lines was found in the
sequenced region (Table 1). Doubled haploids of the O ×
H mapping family were genotyped for either allele. Genotyping doubled haploids mapped Dax1 to linkage group 5
(Figure 1), which corresponds to the long arm of chromosome 22 on the physical map [17].
Sequence analysis revealed the presence of a SNP between
OSU and HC that resulted in the loss of an RsaI site in the
HC allele in a 1.89 Kb genomic fragment containing the
first intron of Dmrt1 (Table 1). PCR-RFLP using Rsa1
restriction was used to genotype doubled haploids of the
O × H mapping family for receiving either Dmrt1 allele
but linkage analysis was unable to assign Dmrt1 to any
linkage group in the O × H map. Chi-square analysis did
not support linkage of the HC (YY) Dmrt1 allele with the
Y chromosome of rainbow trout as indicated by phenotypic sex of the doubled haploid fish (χ2 = 5.241, d.f. = 3,
α = 0.05). One explanation for the failure to map Dmrt1

is the absence of markers closely linked with Dmrt1 in the
genetic map. A second explanation would be that a duplicate of this gene may have also been amplified and interfered with accurate genotyping. However, a chi-square test
(χ2 = 2.572, d.f. = 1, α= 0.05) did not detect deviation
from Mendelian ratios which would likely occur in such a
situation.
Promoter Subsequence Analysis of Dax1 and Dmrt1
Subsequence analysis of an upstream 1.2 Kb promoter
sequence of Dax1 [Genbank: FJ617278] and a 649 bp promoter sequence of Dmrt1 [Genbank: FJ617281] identified
a number of transcription factor binding sites or cis regulatory elements (Table 2 and Table 3). Some of these elements are binding sites for products of genes known to be
involved in the sex differentiation cascade of mammals
including elements for SF1 (steroidegenic factor 1), WT1
(Wilms' tumor suppressor), COUP-TF (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor), HMGA
(high mobility group A) and PAX (paired domain box).
Experiments in mammalian systems have demonstrated
the interaction of the Dax1 gene product with SF1, WT1,
and COUP-TF [18-20].

(Danio rerio) and fugu (Takifugu rubripes). PCR amplification of the fourth intron of Sox6 from OSU and HC produced two products of differing size in each of the clonal
lines. Following cloning and sequencing of all four products, OSU products were determined to be 984 and 1067
bp in size, while the sizes of the recovered products in HC
were 984 and 1097 bp (Table 4). Using the BLASTN algorithm, all four sequences were verified to be that of Sox6.
The larger-sized OSU and HC alleles were named Sox6i
while the smaller-sized alleles were named Sox6ii.
Sequence analysis of the four different Sox6 alleles in OSU
and HC revealed the presence of a microsatellite repeat
nested in the 4th intron. The size difference between Sox6i
and Sox6ii is due to an expansion in the size of the repeat
(Table 4). The size difference between the HC and OSU
alleles at Sox6i is due to a 30 bp expansion of the microsatellite repeat in HC. No size or sequence polymorphisms
were detected between OSU and HC at Sox6ii. The presence of two Sox6 products in each of the homozygous
clonal lines (OSU and HC) indicated that Sox6 is duplicated in the rainbow trout.

details on genotyping doubled haploids).

PCR amplification of the same intron from Arlee produced only one product 984 bp in size. Cloning and
sequencing of the product did not show any sequence variants supporting the presence of a second Sox6 allele in
Arlee. Sequence comparison revealed a polymorphism
between OSU and Arlee parental lines that resulted in the
loss of an AvaII restriction site in Sox6ii of OSU (Table 4
and Figure 2(A)). PCR-RFLP with AvaII was used to genotype doubled haploids of the O × A mapping family (refer

1. Simple disomic inheritance with identical Sox6 Arlee alleles
If we assume that Arlee (A) has two identical Sox6 alleles
and assume independent assortment and random segregation of OSU and Arlee alleles, four genotype classes
should be observed: (1) OSU – Sox6i/OSU – Sox6ii (Genotype 1 in figure 2) (2) A – Sox6i/A – Sox6ii (Genotype 2)
(3) OSU – Sox6i/A – Sox6ii (Genotype 3) (4) A – Sox6i/
OSU – Sox6ii. This last genotype was not observed in the
O × A family (figure 2) which raises questions regarding
validity of the model.

In the O × A mapping family, linkage analysis assigned
Sox6i to linkage group 18 (acrocentric chromosome 26)
and Sox6ii to linkage group 10 (long arm of chromosome
6) supporting their homeology (Figure 1). This relationship was previously suggested by linkage analysis of duplicated microsatellites and by physical mapping of bacterial
artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of duplicated loci
[17,21,22]. Since there were no polymorphisms in the
recovered Sox6ii sequences between OSU and HC, this
allele could not be mapped in the O × H cross. The size
polymorphism in Sox6i between OSU and HC allowed us
to map this gene to linkage group 18, in agreement with
results from the O × A cross.
Inheritance of Sox6 alleles in the O × A family
Two models are considered here to explain the inheritance pattern of Sox6 loci in individuals of the O × A mapping family.

2. Simple disomic inheritance with failure to amplify Sox6i allele
from Arlee
If we assume that primer combination used to amplify different Sox6 loci failed to amplify Sox6i allele in Arlee
because of a mismatch in the primer sequence, or because
of deletion of Sox6i in the Arlee lineage, Sox6i allele in
Arlee can be genotyped as a null allele. Four genotype
classes are expected in the O × A progeny if Sox6i is genotyped as a null allele: (1) OSU – Sox6i/OSU – Sox6ii (Genotype 1 in figure 2) (2) A – null/A – Sox6ii (Genotype 2)
(3) OSU – Sox6i/A – Sox6ii (Genotype 3) (4) A -null/OSU
– Sox6ii (Genotype 4). Genotype analysis of the O × A
mapping family showed that 23 out of 73 doubled hap-

did not show significant deviation of the observed proportions for the different genotype classes from the theoretical proportions expected under this model (χ2 =
6.2603, d.f. = 3, α = 0.05).
The (A -null/OSU – Sox6ii) genotype can also be explained
by failure of the AvaII restriction assays. Genotyping was
however confirmed by digestion with NlaIII which also
produces a distinctive restriction profile for each of the

four genotype classes of the mapping family and thus ruling out this possibility (data not shown).
Additional candidate genes for sex-determination
We tested five loci for their linkage to the Y chromosome
of rainbow trout in this study. In addition, three Sox9 loci
(Alfaqih et al. Submitted) and three WT1 loci [16] have
also been mapped in rainbow trout. This brings the total
number of candidate genes of rainbow trout sex determination tested for linkage to the Y chromosome to eleven.
All of the loci tested were chosen based on their role in sex
determination in mammals and on expression during testicular differentiation of rainbow trout [23].

A number of candidate genes can still be tested for their
linkage to the sex locus of rainbow trout. In mammalian
species, ten out of the 30 genes discovered so far in the Sox
gene (Sry-related HMG box) family have been shown to
be involved in the sex differentiation pathway or
expressed in embryonic testes or ovaries [24,25]. Rainbow
trout orthologs of five of those genes have been deposited
in GENBANK or the TIGR Rainbow Trout Gene Index.
Genes of the DM domain (Doublesex and MAB-3 related)
family are also strong candidates for sex determination in
rainbow trout. There are at least six DM domain genes in
fishes, most of them with unknown functions [24,26]. In
addition to Dmrt1, orthologous sequences of Dmrt2 and
Dmrt4 have been isolated from rainbow trout [27]. Studying the gene expression profile of 102 genes involved in
gonadal differentiation of rainbow trout, Baron et al [23]
identified Pax2a as a gene that is expressed early in
gonadal development and displays a testis-specific expression profile. Our study identified potential binding sites
of Pax2 in the promoter sequences of Dmrt1 and Dax1
suggesting that members of this gene family should be
explored in future analyses. Although our analysis focused
on candidate genes that already have sequences deposited
in public databases, paralogous loci might still be isolated
and would also be strong candidates for sex-determination based on the model presented for evolution of sexdetermining systems [2].
It is largely accepted that the sex-determining system in
rainbow trout is genetic with male heterogamety. Nonetheless, Quillet et al [28] reported an equal ratio of males
and females in a mitotic gynogenetic family. Studying the
transmission of maleness of XX gynogenetic fish across
the next three generations, the authors concluded that
unexpected maleness might be caused by a recessive
mutation of a sex-influencing factor carried on an autosomal pair of chromosomes. This conclusion however
was not accompanied by any genetic mapping of the causative mutation. Our mapping data of the candidate genes
will thus be of great value in analysis of the inheritance of
such an autosomal sex-determining factor.

Conclusion
Using linkage analysis, we excluded the role of five candidate loci as the primary sex-determining gene in rainbow
trout. We also identified a duplication of the Sox6 locus.
Inheritance pattern of Sox6 loci in O × A mapping family
indicated possible deletion of Sox6i locus in the Arlee lineage. Our mapping data supports previously suggested
homeology between linkage groups 10 and 18 in rainbow
trout, and adds four known genes to its genomic map.
Enrichment of the rainbow trout genomic map with type
I markers allows the identification of conserved syntenic
blocks between rainbow trout and other salmonid species, which would eventually allow for understanding the
molecular organization of genomes following genome
duplication. Although we did not find the primary sexdetermining gene in this study, our data is of importance
for analyses of potential autosomal modifiers of sex-determination in rainbow trout.

Methods
Mapping families and linkage maps
Two mapping families and their respective linkage maps
have been used for this study. Mapping families are doubled haploid fish generated from F1 hybrids between two
clonal lines using androgenesis. Clonal lines were produced by androgenesis and gynogenesis [29,30]. Each
clonal line is homozygous at all loci and its isogenecity
has been confirmed by multilocus DNA fingerprinting
[31].
OSU × HC mapping family (O × H)
This family was produced from the F1 hybrid of the Oregon State University (OSU: XX female) and Hot Creek
(HC: YY male) clonal lines. The family was previously
described in Zimmerman et al [32] where it was used to
identify a single major QTL affecting natural killer cell-like
activity. In our study, 85 doubled haploid fish from the
original mapping family were genotyped for polymorphisms in non-coding regions of the candidate genes
Sox6, Dmrt1 and Dax1.
OSU × Arlee mapping family (O × A)
This family was produced by androgenesis from a cross
between the OSU (XX) and Arlee (AR; YY) clonal lines,
previously used to generate a dense linkage map and is
described in Young et al [33] and Nichols et al [22]. In our
study, 76 doubled haploid fish of the original mapping
family were genotyped for polymorphisms in non-coding
regions of the candidate genes Sox6 and Amh. Synteny
between the O × H and O × A linkage maps has been
established [32].

anneal within exons flanking tentative introns. Boundaries between exons and introns were predicted for Sox6,
Dmrt1 and Amh through comparisons of their cDNA
sequences from Genbank (Dmrt1; AF209095 and Sox6;
D61688) or TIGR gene index (Amh; TC103383) with
genomic sequences of Takifugu rubripes and Danio rerio.
Primer sequences are listed in Table 5.

mid system (Promega, Madison, WI) and then sequenced
at the Washington State University Laboratory for Biotechnology and Bioanalysis. Target gene sequence verification was performed using the BLASTN and BLASTX
algorithms of the NCBI website. Sequence polymorphisms between parental alleles were identified by aligning them using Sequencher 3.11 software (version 3.1.1;
Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Because cloning can introduce artifact sequence differences, polymorphisms were
confirmed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA amplification products using a nested primer (nested primer
sequences are not shown).

PCR reactions
All PCR reactions were performed using a Thermolyne
Amplitron II thermocycler. PCR reaction conditions
began with denaturation at 94°C for 2 minutes, followed
by 30 cycles of 94°C for 45 seconds, 60°C for 45 seconds
and 72°C for 45 seconds. The reaction ended with a final
extension step of 72°C for 2 minutes. All reactions were
20 μl in volume containing: 50 ng DNA template, 1× PCR
buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10
pmoles of each primer, 0.25 mM dNTPs (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and 1.5 U of Taq DNA Polymerase
(Promega, Madison, WI).

Isolation of Dax1 and Dmrt1 genomic sequences
A PCR-based approach (Brunelli et al. In press) was used
to isolate lambda clones of Dax1 and Dmrt1 from a λ Zap
II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) genomic library created from
an O × H F1 hybrid. Following sequencing of the Dax1
and Dmrt1 lambda library clones by PCR walking, the
structure of the Dax1 gene was deduced based on
sequence alignment with the relevant sequences of Dicentrarchus labrax and Oreochromis niloticus. Intron and promoter sequences of Dmrt1 were identified based on
alignment of the recovered genomic clone with rainbow
trout Dmrt1 published cDNA sequence.

Cloning, sequencing and sequence alignments
Following the amplification of non-coding regions of candidate genes, PCR amplification products were resolved in
a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Desired
DNA fragments were gel-purified using Gene Clean (Bio
101, Vista, California), cloned into the pGEM-T Easy plas-

Genotyping of doubled haploid populations
PCR-RFLP
Non-coding sequences of the candidate genes Sox6, Dmrt1
and Amh have sequence substitutions between alleles of
the different parental lines that alter recognition
sequences of restriction enzymes (RE). Utilizing these dif-

ferences, doubled haploid fish of the mapping family
were genotyped for the parental allele containing the polymorphic restriction site by PCR amplification, followed
by RE digestion. Products of the RE-digest were size-fractionated in 1.5% agarose gels. Appropriate restriction
enzyme digestions were done in 20 μl volume reactions
according to the manufacturer's directions (New England
Bio-labs, Ipswich, MA). Gene-specific primers utilized in
RFLP-genotyping are listed in Table 5. Polymorphic REsites are listed in Table 1.

Taqman assay
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected
between OSU and HC in the deduced promoter region of
Dax1. The polymorphism did not change any published
recognition sequence of a RE. A Taqman assay (Applied
Biosystems, Foster city, CA) was used to score doubled
haploids of the O × H mapping family for having either
OSU or HC alleles. Primers and probe sequences used in
the Taqman assay are listed in Table 1.

Health Sciences grant ES012446 to James Nagler and by National Research
Initiative grant 2006-35205-16728 from the USDA CSREES to Gary Thorgaard and Hubert Schwabl.

Microsatellites
A microsatellite repeat nested in the Sox6 fourth intron
was found to have a different size among the different
Sox6 alleles (Table 4). Size differences were large enough
to be analyzed in a 2.5% agarose gel stained by ethidium
bromide and viewed under UV light. Primer sequences
used for amplifying the microsatellite are listed in Table 5.
Default PCR reaction conditions were used for the amplification.

Linkage mapping
Prior to linkage analysis, segregation data of all loci was
checked for deviations from expected Mendelian ratios
using a chi-square test (α = 0.05). Genotyping data of candidate genes was incorporated into the pre-constructed O
× H and O × A linkage maps using Map Maker 3.0/EXP
[34]. Marker orders were retained from the previous publications using these families [22,32]. For Sox6, doubled
haploids were genotyped for receiving OSU Sox6i or Sox6ii
alleles, while the Arlee Sox6i allele was genotyped as a null
allele. The locations of newly-genotyped loci were determined using the "try" command, with the Kosambi map
function, a minimum LOD score of 3.0 and a maximum
theta of 0.45.

Promoter sub-sequence analysis
A 2.2 Kb region upstream of Dax1 and 0.6 kb region
upstream of Dmrt1 coding regions were sequenced from
the isolated lambda clones. The promoter sequences were
analyzed for the presence of putative regulatory elements
for transcription factors known to be involved in sex differentiation using MatInspector software (Genomatix
Software GmbH, Munich, Germany).
