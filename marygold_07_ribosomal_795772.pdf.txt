Abstract
Background: Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) have been shown to cause an
array of cellular and developmental defects in a variety of organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster,
disruption of RP genes can result in the 'Minute' syndrome of dominant, haploinsufficient
phenotypes, which include prolonged development, short and thin bristles, and poor fertility and
viability. While more than 50 Minute loci have been defined genetically, only 15 have so far been
characterized molecularly and shown to correspond to RP genes.
Results: We combined bioinformatic and genetic approaches to conduct a systematic analysis of
the relationship between RP genes and Minute loci. First, we identified 88 genes encoding 79
different cytoplasmic RPs (CRPs) and 75 genes encoding distinct mitochondrial RPs (MRPs).
Interestingly, nine CRP genes are present as duplicates and, while all appear to be functional, one
member of each gene pair has relatively limited expression. Next, we defined 65 discrete Minute
loci by genetic criteria. Of these, 64 correspond to, or very likely correspond to, CRP genes; the
single non-CRP-encoding Minute gene encodes a translation initiation factor subunit. Significantly,
MRP genes and more than 20 CRP genes do not correspond to Minute loci.
Conclusion: This work answers a longstanding question about the molecular nature of Minute loci
and suggests that Minute phenotypes arise from suboptimal protein synthesis resulting from
reduced levels of cytoribosomes. Furthermore, by identifying the majority of haplolethal and
haplosterile loci at the molecular level, our data will directly benefit efforts to attain complete
deletion coverage of the D. melanogaster genome.

Background

Ribosomes are sophisticated macromolecular machines that
catalyze cellular protein synthesis in all cells of all organisms.
They have an ancient evolutionary origin and are essential for
cell growth, proliferation and viability. Though larger and
more complex in higher organisms, both the structure and
function of ribosomes have been conserved throughout evolution. Genetic approaches in Drosophila melanogaster have
shown that disrupting ribosome function can result in an
array of fascinating dominant phenotypes [1,2]. Despite this,
there has so far been no comprehensive inventory of genes
encoding ribosome components in this organism, nor any
systematic effort to determine their mutant phenotypes.
All ribosomes comprise a set of ribosomal proteins (RPs) surrounding a catalytic core of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Bacteria
possess a single type of ribosome composed of three rRNA
molecules and typically 54 RPs. All eukaryotic cells, in contrast, contain at least two distinct types of ribosomes: cytoplasmic ribosomes (cytoribosomes) and mitochondrial
ribosomes (mitoribosomes). Cytoribosomes are found on the
endoplasmic reticulum and in the aqueous cytoplasm. They
translate all mRNAs produced from nuclear genes and perform the vast majority of cellular protein synthesis. Each
cytoribosome contains four different rRNAs and 78-80 cytoplasmic RPs (CRPs). Mitoribosomes consist of only two rRNA
molecules and up to 80 mitochondrial RPs (MRPs). They are
located in the mitochondrial matrix and synthesize proteins
involved in oxidative phosphorylation encoded by those few
genes retained in the mitochondrial genome. A third unique
type of eukaryotic ribosome is found within the plastids (for
example, chloroplasts) of plant and various algal cells. In all
cases, distinct small and large ribosomal subunits exist that
join together during the translation initiation process to form
mature ribosomes capable of protein synthesis. (See references [3-6] for general reviews of ribosomal structure and
function.)
The protein components of ribosomes are interesting from
several points of view. First, and most obviously, RPs play
critical roles in ribosome assembly and function [7]. Second,
several RPs perform important extra-ribosomal functions,
including roles in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation and
apoptosis [6,8]. Third, misexpression of human CRP and
MRP genes has been implicated in a wide spectrum of human
syndromes and diseases, including Diamond-Blackfan anaemia [9], Turner syndrome [10], hearing loss [11] and cancer
[12]. Fourth, mutations in the CRP genes of D. melanogaster
are important tools for the study of growth, development and
cell competition [2]. Finally, many RPs are conserved from
bacteria to humans, so their peptide and nucleotide
sequences are useful for studying phylogenetic relationships
[13].
The first eukaryotic CRPs characterized in detail were isolated from the rat cytoribosome [3]. Individual proteins were

separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and named
from their origin in the small (S) or large (L) subunit and their
relative electrophoretic migration positions, for example,
RPS9 or RPL28. Subsequent studies revealed that some protein spots contained non-ribosomal proteins or chemically
modified versions of another CRP, and that some spots contained two co-migrating CRPs [3,5]. Consequently, the
nomenclature system used today contains numerical gaps as
well as 'A' suffixes for those additional CRPs not resolved by
the original electrophoresis (for example, RPL36A). Seventynine distinct mammalian CRPs are now acknowledged and
their amino acid sequences and biochemical properties have
been described [5,14]. With the exception of RPLP1 and
RPLP2, each of which forms homodimers in the cytoribosomal large subunit [15], all CRPs are present as single molecules in each cytoribosome [3].
Seventy-eight different mammalian MRPs have been
described [6] and their individual amino acid sequences and
biochemical properties have been determined [16,17].
Although the nomenclature of MRPs was originally based on
electrophoretic properties, the current system reflects homology between mammalian MRPs and their bacterial
orthologs [18]. Thus, MRPS1 through MRPS21 are orthologous to Escherichia coli RPs S1-S21, while higher numbers
have been assigned to the MRPs not found in bacteria. Gaps
also exist in MRP numbering because a gap occurs in the bacterial enumeration or because there is no mammalian
ortholog.
The RPs of D. melanogaster were first studied in the 1970s
and early 1980s. Up to 78 individual CRPs were observed on
two-dimensional gels [19-31] and about 30 were purified and
analyzed biochemically [32,33]. A more recent characterization used mass spectrometry to identify 52 D. melanogaster
CRPs [34], all of which are orthologous to known mammalian
CRPs. The protein composition of Drosophila mitoribosomes
has not been characterized biochemically to date.
CRPs and MRPs are encoded by the nuclear genome. Knowledge of the primary sequences of rat CRPs and bovine MRPs
has led to the identification and mapping of the RP-encoding
genes in many eukaryotic species [14]. Indeed, systematic
analyses of whole RP gene sets have been described for several organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae [35],
Arabidopsis thaliana [36] and humans [37-40]. However,
the complete set of D. melanogaster CRP and MRP genes has
not been previously documented or characterized.
Several D. melanogaster RP genes were initially identified by
virtue of their dominant 'Minute' mutant phenotypes [2],
which include prolonged development, low fertility and viability, altered body size and abnormally short, thin bristles on
the adult body. All of these phenotypes may be explained by a
cell-autonomous defect in protein biosynthesis: the production of each bristle, for example, requires a very high rate of

protein synthesis in a single cell during a short developmental
period. Merriam and colleagues reported the first unequivocal molecular link between a Minute locus and a CRP gene in
1985 [41]. Since then, 14 additional Minute loci have been
definitively linked with distinct CRP genes [2,42-53]. However, there are at least 35 genetically validated Minute loci
that have not yet been associated with a specific gene and
there may be additional Minute genes to be discovered. Several investigators have hypothesized that all Minute loci
encode protein components of ribosomes (reviewed in [2]).
Whether this is truly the case and whether both CRP and MRP
genes are associated with Minute phenotypes are open and
intriguing questions.
Many Minute loci were originally identified from the phenotypes of flies heterozygous for a chromosomal deletion
[54,55] and all Minute point mutations studied in depth have
been found to be loss-of-function alleles [2]. This indicates
that Minute phenotypes can be attributed to genetic haploinsufficiency; that is, a single gene copy is not sufficient for normal development. (Note that X-linked mutations that cause
Minute phenotypes in heterozygous females are lethal in
hemizygous males.) The most popular explanation for the
haploinsufficiency of Minute loci is that they correspond to
RP genes and that RPs are required in equimolar amounts:
halving the copy number of a single RP gene limits the availability of the encoded RP, thereby reducing the number of
functional ribosomes that are assembled in the cell and
impairing protein synthesis [2]. While this idea is consistent
with the available data, there may be other explanations.
The reduced fertility and viability associated with many
Minute loci makes the recovery of deletions uncovering them
rather difficult - the mutant strains are too weak to maintain
as stable heterozygous stocks. In fact, some Minute loci are
known only from the phenotypes of transient aneuploids
[54,56]. This means that several chromosomal regions containing a Minute locus are not uncovered by current deletion
collections [57]. This is frustrating for researchers because
deletions are basic tools for mutational analysis and are
widely used for mapping new mutations and identifying
genetic modifiers. Efforts to maximize deletion coverage of
the D. melanogaster genome would benefit from a systematic
assessment of the relationship between RP genes and Minute
loci. It would allow the isolation of deletions that flank haploinsufficient RP genes as closely as possible, or the design of
transgenic constructs or chromosomal duplications to rescue
the haploinsufficiency of deletions uncovering Minute genes.
Here, we report the systematic identification, naming and
characterization of all the CRP and MRP genes of D. melanogaster. We have used this information, together with phenotypic data obtained from examining mutation and
deficiency strains, to assess the correspondence between RP
genes and Minute loci. We find that 66 of the 88 CRP genes
identified are, or are very likely to be, haploinsufficient and

associated with a Minute phenotype, whereas MRP genes and
the remaining 22 CRP genes are not. Significantly, we show
that all but one of the known Minute loci in the genome correspond to CRP genes - the single exception encodes a subunit of an essential translation initiation factor. Together,
these results identify the majority of haploinsufficient loci in
the D. melanogaster genome that significantly affect viability, fertility and/or external morphology, and also provide a
mechanistic framework for understanding the Minute syndrome and the phenotypic effects of aneuploidy.

Results
Identification of D. melanogaster ribosomal protein
genes
In order to conduct an exhaustive survey of Drosophila CRP
and MRP genes, we first performed a series of BLAST
searches using human RP sequences as queries, because both
CRPs and MRPs have been well-characterized in humans
[5,6]. Tables 1 and 2 list the genes we identified together with
their cytological locations. Where necessary, D. melanogaster genes were named or renamed according to the
standard metazoan RP gene nomenclature proposed by Wool
and colleagues [5,58,59] and approved by the HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee [18], whilst still conforming to FlyBase [60] conventions - that is, CRP genes are given an 'Rp'
prefix and MRP genes have an 'mRp' prefix. The seven exceptions to this standard RP nomenclature are mostly genes originally named to reflect a mutant phenotype, for example, the
string of pearls (sop) gene encodes RpS2 [61] and bonsai
encodes mRpS15 [62,63]. In these cases, the original gene
symbol has been preserved, with the apposite RP symbol
given as a synonym.

Cytoplasmic ribosomal protein genes
We identified 88 genes that encode a total of 79 different
CRPs (Table 1). Thus, the D. melanogaster proteome contains orthologs of all 79 mammalian CRPs (32 small subunit
and 47 large subunit proteins). While the majority of CRPs
are encoded by single genes, nine are encoded by two distinct
genes. In addition, we identified another five genes predicted
to encode proteins with significantly lower similarity to
human CRPs, which we term 'CRP-like' genes. Two fragments
of the RpS6 gene were also identified. (The list of 88 CRP
genes presented by Cherry et al. [64] originated from an earlier report of our results to FlyBase (MA and SJM,
FBrf0178764). These authors also list five CRP-like genes
from our original report, but two of these have been eliminated and two additional CRP-like genes have been added in
the current analysis.)
The deduced characteristics of D. melanogaster and human
CRPs are compared in Additional data file 1. As might be
expected, the amino acid identity between the CRPs of the two
species is very high (average of 69% with a range of 27-98%,
excluding the CRP-like proteins) and the predicted molecular

search using Release 5.3.) Where multiple protein isoforms exist, the highest scoring hit is given.

weights and isoelectric points of the homologous proteins are
very similar. However, several D. melanogaster proteins
(RpL14, RpL22, RpL23A, RpL29, RpL34a, RpL34b, RpL35A)
have significantly lower overall identity and different molecular weights owing to terminal deletions or extensions (data
not shown; also see [65]). (If these seven proteins are discounted, the average identity of fly and human CRPs
increases to 72% with a range of 43-98%.) Similar to humans
and other species, there are very few acidic CRPs in D. melanogaster: only six proteins (RpSA, RpS12, RpS21, RpLP0,
RpLP1 and RpLP2) have isoelectric points less than pH 7.
(Note that RpS21 is an acidic protein, whereas its human
counterpart is basic.) As in other eukaryotes, RpS27A and
RpL40 are carboxyl extensions of ubiquitin [66-69], and, as
in other animals, RpS30 is fused to a ubiquitin-like sequence.
From these gross characterizations of component proteins, it
appears that the fly cytoribosome differs only slightly from its
human counterpart and is essentially the same as other
eukaryotic cytoribosomes.
Previous biochemical analyses estimated that the D. melanogaster cytoribosome contains up to 78 CRPs [29]. This figure compares very well to the 79 different CRPs predicted by
our orthology analysis (Table 1). Unfortunately, very few of
the CRPs identified in the 1970s and 1980s were characterized to the level of amino acid sequence, so their correspondences to CRP genes are generally unknown, though there are
a few exceptions (see references [70-73]). We have been unable, therefore, to correlate the CRPs identified in these earlier
studies with those encoded by the CRP genes identified in this
study. In contrast, our CRP inventory certainly does contain
all 52 CRPs identified by the recent biochemical analysis of D.
melanogaster cytoribosomes by Alonso and Santarén [34].

Mitochondrial ribosomal protein genes
We identified 75 D. melanogaster genes encoding proteins of
the mitoribosome (28 in the small subunit and 47 in the large

subunit) by orthology to human MRPs (Table 2). These data
complement and extend previous analyses of homology
between human and D. melanogaster MRPs [16,17]. As in
these previous studies, genes encoding orthologs of three
human MRPs (MRPS27, MRPS36 and LACTB/MRPL56)
were not found.
The MRPs of humans and D. melanogaster are much more
divergent than are their CRPs: MRPs have an average identity
of only 34% (with a range of 15-57%) and several homologous
pairs differ markedly in their sizes and isoelectric points
(Additional data file 2). Indeed, it is known that the mitoribosome is a rapidly evolving structure whose composition
varies among eukaryotic organisms [6]. It is quite possible
that there are proteins in Drosophila mitoribosomes that are
not found in their human counterparts and these will have
been missed by our orthology analysis - a definitive inventory
will require biochemical characterization of the fly mitoribosome. As in mammals, three distinct genes encode three different isoforms of MRPS18 (Table 2); it is thought that each
mitoribosome contains a single MRPS18 protein and that
mitoribosomes may, therefore, be heterogeneous in composition [6].

Duplicate cytoplasmic ribosomal protein genes
Of the 79 different CRPs of D. melanogaster, 9 are encoded
by two distinct genes (Table 1). These are distinguished by a
lowercase 'a' or 'b' suffix to the gene symbol. (The lowercase
'a' should not be confused with the uppercase 'A' suffix used
in the standard CRP nomenclature; for example, RpL37a and
RpL37A are different genes that encode different proteins.)
Six of these gene pairs encode proteins of the small ribosomal
subunit and the other three encode large subunit proteins. In
humans, each CRP is typically encoded by a single, functional
gene [37,74], but thousands of nonfunctional CRP pseudogenes are known to exist [75]. We therefore investigated the
evolutionary origin, sequence conservation and expression

profile of the duplicate D. melanogaster CRP genes in order
to assess whether both members of each pair are likely to be
functional (Table 3 and Figure 1).
In five cases, one member of the gene pair lacks introns
(RpS10a, RpS15Ab, RpS28a, RpL10Aa and RpL37b) while
the other member does not. These five intronless genes are
likely to have arisen by retrotransposition; that is, generated
via reverse transcription of mRNA from the precursor gene
followed by insertion into a new genomic location. In contrast, the RpS5, RpS19 and RpL34 duplicates arose through
gene transposition events as both members of each pair retain
introns. The RpL34 duplication occurred through an intrachromosomal transposition on chromosome arm 3R, and
RpL34a and RpL34b have retained almost identical gene

structures. In contrast, the RpS5 and RpS19 duplications
involved interchromosomal transposition events that must
have been followed by extensive gene remodeling as the
intron-exon structures differ within each pair. Finally,
RpS14a and RpS14b probably arose via unequal exchange:
these paralogs are situated adjacent to each other as a tandem
duplication on the X chromosome, share identical intronexon structures and encode identical proteins [76]. All nine
duplicate genes appear to have arisen within the Drosophilidae, albeit at different stages in the lineage leading to D. melanogaster (Figure 1).
Neither member of these 9 CRP gene pairs contains a nonsense mutation in the protein-coding region (data not
shown), indicating that all 18 genes are potentially functional.

Figure 1
Evolution of D. melanogaster CRP gene duplicates and CRP-like genes
Evolution of D. melanogaster CRP gene duplicates and CRP-like genes. The likely pattern of emergence of CRP duplicate genes with restricted expression
(blue), CRP-like genes (green) and CRP pseudogenic fragments (brown) in the lineage leading to D. melanogaster is shown. RpL34b is shown in black text:
this is the only case where the newly emerged duplicate gene (RpL34b), rather than precursor gene (RpL34a), acts as the principal gene copy. The relative
placement of CG11386 and CG33222 is consistent with the model presented by Stewart and Denell [86]. The dendrogram is based on that given in
reference [140], in which the relationships among the Drosophilidae are taken from [149]; note that the branch lengths do not accurately reflect
evolutionary time.

none of these duplicate genes are nonfunctional pseudogenes,
which is consistent with a previous analysis [77]. Indeed, the
recovery of multiple cDNA clones for the majority (15/18) of
these duplicate genes supports their expression in vivo (Table
3).
Although none of these CRP gene duplicates appear to be
pseudogenes, it is evident that one member of each pair - the
one with higher similarity to its human ortholog, where this
difference exists (Table 1 and Additional data file 1) - is
expressed at a significantly higher level and, in some cases, in
a wider array of tissues than the other. This suggests that one
gene of the pair produces the majority of each CRP in most
cells, while the other gene has a more restricted expression
pattern and, perhaps, a specialized function (indicated by
bold font in Tables 1 and 3). In eight of the nine duplication
events, the 'younger' gene copy has adopted the lower expression level or more restricted expression pattern; the RpL34
gene pair is exceptional in this regard (Figure 1 and Table 3).
The expression of RpS5b, RpS19b, RpL10Aa and RpL37b
appears enriched in the adult testis, suggesting the existence
of testis-specific CRPs and a testis-specific cytoribosome
(Table 3). Significantly, three of these genes (RpS5b, RpS19b

and RpL37b), together with RpS10a, RpS15Ab and RpS28a,
are autosomal copies of X-linked genes. These duplication
events are consistent with previous studies reporting that
genes with male-biased expression are predominantly autosomal [78], and that retrotransposed genes in D. melanogaster have preferentially retrotransposed from the X
chromosome onto autosomes [79]. It is possible that these
autosomal duplicates enable CRP expression in male germline cells, where it is hypothesized that X chromosome inactivation occurs during spermatogenesis [80]. Similarly, in
humans, RPS4Y is a Y-linked duplicate of the X-linked RPS4
gene [10] and RPL10L, RPL36AL and RPL39L are autosomal
retrogene copies of X-linked progenitors [74]. It is worth noting that expression of D. melanogaster RpS5b, RpS10a and
RpS19b is also enriched in the germline cells of embryonic
gonads [81] and/or stem cells of adult ovaries [82]. These
findings suggest a germline-specific role, rather than a testisspecific role, for these CRP gene duplicates.
To conclude, the 'principal' CRPs of D. melanogaster - those
that are expressed at high levels in most cells - are each

Cytoplasmic ribosomal protein-like genes

Chromosomal distribution of ribosomal protein genes

We identified five D. melanogaster 'CRP-like' genes that
encode proteins with significantly lower identity to human
CRPs than those described above. These are RpS28-like,
RpLP0-like, RpL7-like, RpL22-like and RpL24-like (shown in
bold font in Tables 1 and 3). Of these, RpLP0-like and RpL24like show the most divergence from their cognate proteins,
RpLP0 and RpL24. Consistent with this, RpLP0-like and
RpL24-like have ancient evolutionary origins, while RpL7like, RpL22-like and RpS28-like arose more recently within
the Diptera (Figure 1).

As has been found for other eukaryotes [35,36,38,39], the RP
genes of D. melanogaster are distributed across the entire
genome (Figure 2). Some RP genes are tightly linked to other
RP genes and, while this posed challenges for determining the
phenotypes associated with individual genes (see below), we
have no evidence that this distribution has functional consequences or that closely linked RP genes are transcriptionally
co-regulated. Five RP genes (RpL5, Qm/RpL10, RpL15,
RpL38, and mRpS5) are located within heterochromatic
regions, as are certain human MRP genes [38] and some Arabidopsis thaliana CRP genes [36]. As heterochromatin is generally associated with the silencing of gene expression [88],
the regulation of these genes must have adapted to the heterochromatic environment in order for the encoded proteins to
be expressed at sufficiently high levels to meet the demand for
ribosome synthesis in the cell [89].

cDNA evidence indicates that all five of these CRP-like genes
are expressed in vivo, albeit at far lower levels than their cognate genes (Table 3). The evolutionary conservation of
RpLP0-like and RpL24-like suggests they have important cellular functions. Indeed, the yeast ortholog of RpL24-like is
found in pre-ribosomal complexes where it is thought to function in large subunit biogenesis [83]. It remains to be seen
whether the other CRP-like proteins have similar functions.
Interestingly, the RpL22 gene is X-linked and expressed
ubiquitously, whereas RpL22-like is an autosomal gene that
is expressed predominantly in germline cells [81,82,84,85].
This suggests that RpL22-like may have a specialized role in
the germline, and perhaps within germline-specific cytoribosomes, as proposed above for some of the CRP duplicates.
CG11386 and CG33222 are 99% identical in DNA sequence
and are tandem repeats of the third exon and flanking regions
of the RpS6 gene. They likely arose via two sequential unequal
crossover events [86]; the first occurring after the evolutionary split of the melanogaster subgroup, and the second being
specific to D. melanogaster (Figure 1). Gene prediction algorithms suggest that CG11386 and CG33222 are distinct genes
encoding identical amino-terminally truncated versions of
RpS6 [87]; however, such proteins would lack critical functional domains and would probably be nonfunctional. In a
different scenario, CG11386 and/or CG33222 could serve as
alternative third exons of the RpS6 gene: the proteins produced would be full-length, but would differ substantially in
their carboxy-terminal two-thirds from the RpS6 generated
by using the conventional third exon [86]. There is, however,
no direct evidence that such alternative transcripts are made.
Indeed, only three cDNA clones suggest that CG11386 or
CG33222 are expressed at all (Table 3). We have tentatively
classified CG11386 and CG33222 as nonfunctional pseudogenic fragments.

Ribosomal protein gene haploinsufficiency and the
Minute syndrome
Classical genetic studies have defined more than fifty regions
of the D. melanogaster genome that are haploinsufficient and
associated with the dominant phenotypes of prolonged development and short, thin bristles - the Minute loci [2] (Figure
3). To date, only fifteen Minute loci have been tied unequivocally to molecularly defined genes and all of these encode RPs
(reviewed in reference [2]; also see references [48-53]). It has
not been clear, however, if all Minute loci correspond to RP
genes, or whether Minute loci may correspond to both CRP
and MRP genes. We have conducted a new survey of Minute
loci in the D. melanogaster genome which, combined with
our RP gene inventory, has now allowed us to assess these
relationships systematically.
Recent large-scale projects have provided a wealth of new
genetic reagents that enable the mapping of Minute loci with
a precision unavailable only a few years ago. Hundreds of new
deletions with molecularly defined breakpoints have been
provided by the efforts of the DrosDel consortium [90,91],
Exelixis, Inc. [92], and the Bloomington Drosophila Stock
Center [92]. When combined with older deletions characterized primarily through polytene chromosome cytology, these
deletions have increased euchromatic genome coverage to
96-97%. In addition, transposable element insertions now
exist within 0.5 kb of 57% of all genes (R Levis, personal communication), largely through the efforts of the Drosophila
Gene Disruption Project [93] and Exelixis, Inc. [94]. We used

these resources to conduct a genome-wide search for Minute
loci. In so doing, we considered the characteristic Minute
bristle phenotype (Figure 3) to be diagnostic of the Minute
syndrome; we did not methodically evaluate more subtle
Minute traits, such as slower development, or traits observed
in only a subset of Minute mutants, such as impaired fecundity, reduced viability or altered body size. By combining our
observations with information gleaned from published studies, we have identified 61 distinct Minute loci. Many of these
correlate with Minute loci described previously (Additional
data file 3), though our work has often refined their map positions. Significantly, six Minute loci (M(2)31E, M(2)34BC,
M(2)45F, M(2)50E, M(3)93A and M(3)98B) are reported
here for the first time. We also found four instances
(M(2)31A, M(2)53, M(2)58F and M(3)67C) where a single
Minute locus characterized by previous aneuploidy analyses
actually comprises two separable, closely linked Minute
genes. As we have inferred the existence of four additional
Minute loci from patterns of deletion coverage (described
below), we conclude that there are 65 distinct Minute loci in
the D. melanogaster genome.
We were able to demonstrate definitively that a particular
Minute locus corresponds to a specific RP gene when a
Minute bristle phenotype was observed in one or more of the
following situations: flies heterozygous for a molecularly
characterized mutation in a RP gene (for example, M(2)36F/
RpS26); flies heterozygous for a chromosomal deletion when
the Minute phenotype could be mapped unambiguously to a
single RP gene with deletion breakpoints (for example,
M(2)25C/RpL37A); or flies heterozygous for a chromosomal
deletion when the Minute phenotype could be rescued by a
specific RP transgene (for example, M(3)99D/RpL32). We
found that there are 26 unequivocally Minute CRP genes by
these criteria (Additional data file 4; summarized in Table 4).
In contrast, no MRP or CRP-like genes were definitively demonstrated to be Minute genes.
These 26 cases of proven CRP gene-Minute locus correspondences provide a strong precedent for expecting that other CRP
genes are also Minute genes. Although existing reagents do
not allow us to demonstrate the correspondences definitively,
we judged that a CRP gene very likely corresponds to a genetically defined Minute locus when one or more of the following
criteria are fulfilled: a Minute phenotype is seen for a heterozygous multi-gene deletion that uncovers a single CRP gene
(for example, M(3)63B/RpL28); a CRP gene lies in a gap in
deletion coverage and a molecularly uncharacterized Minute
mutation maps to the same region (for example, M(1)8F/
RpS28b); or a CRP gene lies in a gap in deletion coverage and
previous studies of transient aneuploids document the presence of a Minute locus in the same region (for example,
M(3)99E/RpS7). In this way, we identified an additional 36
CRP genes that likely correspond to 34 genetically defined
Minute loci (Additional data file 4; summarized in Table 4).
Closely linked pairs of CRP genes map to the same regions as

Volume 8, Issue 10, Article R216

Marygold et al. R216.13

M(2)60B and M(3)93A and, as it was impossible to determine
whether one or both genes of each pair are haploinsufficient,
we have classified all four CRP genes as likely Minute genes.
No CRP-like genes mapped to the regions of proven Minute
loci. Although five MRP genes map to regions containing
Minute loci, it is unlikely that any of them are haploinsufficient: MRP genes are not associated with Minute phenotypes
in any other situation, and each of these five MRP genes is
closely linked to a CRP gene (Additional data file 4).
We concluded that a further four CRP genes (RpL17, RpL18A,
RpL34b and RpL35A) are likely to be Minute genes despite no
Minute phenotype having been associated with the genomic
region in which they reside. In each of these cases, the CRP
gene lies in a gap in deletion coverage (Table 4, Additional
data file 4), suggesting that it is a Minute associated with
strongly reduced fertility and/or viability, which prevents the
establishment of stable deletion stocks (in the absence of a
corresponding duplication). Supporting this view, such
severe haploinsufficiency also appears to be associated with
15 other CRP genes - all these CRP genes lie in gaps in deletion
coverage and they are only considered Minute genes here
because they have point or transposon insertion (likely hypomorphic) mutations that cause Minute phenotypes, or
because they lie in regions known to harbour Minute loci from
the phenotypes of transient aneuploids (Table 4, Additional
data file 4).
For all of the 40 CRP genes classified as 'likely Minute genes'
(through correlation with genetically proven Minute loci or
gaps in deletion coverage), we determined the maximum
number of candidate genes that could possibly account for the
haploinsufficiency. We used deletions to define the smallest
chromosomal interval containing the Minute and then
eliminated genes known not to be associated with a Minute
phenotype from previous studies or from our own examinations of mutant fly strains. (This task benefited greatly from
the recent work of the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center
which, in its efforts to maximize genomic deletion coverage,
has systematically generated deletions flanking haploinsufficient loci.) The number of candidate genes defined in this way
was always small, ranging from 2 to 33 genes with a median
of 8.5 candidate genes per Minute locus (Table 4, Additional
data file 4). These data increase our confidence in the likely
correspondences between these Minute loci and CRP genes.
The results presented above indicate that 66 CRP genes are,
or are likely to be, Minute genes, whereas the remaining 22
CRP genes are not (Table 4 and Additional data files 4 and 5;
summarized in Figure 4). CRPs of the large and small
ribosomal subunit are encoded by both Minute and nonMinute genes, with no apparent bias. Notably, none of the
nine duplicate CRP genes with relatively restricted expression
is a Minute, whereas seven of the more highly and widely
expressed gene pair members are Minute genes. This is consistent with the idea that only one member of each of these

gene pairs contributes significantly to cytoribosomal function
in the majority of cells, while the one with restricted expression encodes a component of qualitatively distinct cytoribosomes in certain cell types. As the 'principal' copy of RpS14 or
RpL10A is not a Minute, it is unsurprising that the simultaneous heterozygous deletion of both RpS14 genes [95] or both
RpL10A genes (in flies with genotypes Df(3L)ED4475/
Df(3R)ED10556 or Df(3L)ED4475/Df(3R)ED5660; our
observations) does not produce flies with Minute phenotypes.

Other possible reasons for different dosage sensitivities
among CRP genes are discussed below.
The one verified Minute locus that does not correspond to a
CRP gene is M(1)14C. We mapped this Minute gene to region
14C6 by showing that the deletions Df(1)ED7364 (14A8;14C6)
and Df(1)FDD-0230908 (14C6;14E1) are each associated
with a Minute phenotype. Moreover, we could rescue these
phenotypes, as well as the Minute phenotype associated with

Minute region defined by these experiments contains only
two genes: CG4420 and eIF-2α. Significantly, flies heterozygous for P{RS5}eIF-2α 5-HA-1790, an insertion in the 5'
untranslated region (UTR) of eIF-2α that creates a likely
hypomorphic allele, show a discernable, albeit weak Minute
phenotype (our observations). This identifies eIF-2α as
M(1)14C. Consistent with this conclusion, flies expressing a
dominant-negative eIF-2α protein grow slowly and attain a
small body size [96], phenotypes that are typical of the
Minute syndrome. eIF-2α is one of the three subunits that
constitute eIF2, a key translation initiation factor that delivers the methionine-loaded initiator tRNA to the ribosome by
transiently associating with the small cytoribosomal subunit
[97]. Although eIF-2α is not a component of cytoribosome
complexes isolated by standard biochemical preparations, a
reduction in eIF-2α gene dosage might still be expected to
adversely affect cytoribosomal function and decrease overall
rates of protein synthesis by specifically impairing translation
initiation.

Minute phenotypes [99], but deletions of the entire gene are
haplolethal in the absence of P{(ry+), 11. 5kb}, a transgenic
construct carrying the complete Su(var)3-9 genomic region
(our observations; Additional data file 6). These data indicate
that the regions of the Su(var)3-9 transcription unit encoding
eIF-2γ are haplolethal. Moreover, it is possible that this haplolethality actually represents an extreme Minute phenotype
associated with the eIF-2γ-coding regions; hypomorphic eIF2γ mutants, if isolated, may show less severe Minute
phenotypes.

Interestingly, the gene encoding eIF-2γ, another subunit of
the eIF2 translation initiation factor, is also haploinsufficient.
Transcripts from the Su(var)3-9 gene are alternatively
spliced to produce two different proteins with distinct functions: one protein is the eIF-2γ translation factor, the other is
responsible for suppression of position effect variegation
[98]. Mutations that specifically eliminate the suppressor

we failed to validate the existence of several Minute loci

To assess the possibility that other translation factor genes
might also be haploinsufficient/Minute, we examined the
heterozygous loss-of-function phenotypes of 68 translation
factor genes we identified from BLAST searches and/or Gene
Ontology classification (Additional data file 6). We identified
no other cases of haploinsufficiency, though five genes could
not be assessed with existing deletion and mutation strains.
In contrast to the genes encoding the other two subunits of
eIF2, the eIF-2β gene is not haploinsufficient.

Summary of Minute locus - CRP gene correspondences. This figure shows the relationship between Minute loci defined by genetic criteria and CRP genes
identified using bioinformatics. '=' indicates definite correspondence, '~' indicates probable correspondence. Daggers mark Minute loci that we know or
strongly suspect correspond to two CRP genes (as detailed in Table 4 and Additional data file 4).

these loci has been questioned previously and many cases
appear to have involved chromosomal aberrations that were
unusually complex or point mutations that were mismapped.
Our failure to observe a Minute phenotype for deletions of Sadenosylmethionine synthetase (Sam-S), also known as
M(2)21AB, is consistent with the phenotypic instability of
dominant Sam-S mutations documented previously [100102]. This suggests that mutations in Sam-S can phenocopy
Minute mutations under certain conditions, but that Sam-S is
not a typical Minute gene.
In summary, CRP genes are likely to correspond to all but one
of the 65 Minute loci defined in this study, with the sole
exception encoding a translation initiation factor subunit
(Figure 4). No MRP or CRP-like genes are unequivocally
associated with a Minute phenotype, indicating that the
Minute syndrome is specifically related to the function of the
cytoribosomes responsible for the majority of cellular protein
translation, rather than the function of specialized cytoribosomal variants. Twenty-five percent of CRP genes are not associated with an obvious haploinsufficient phenotype, clearly
reinforcing previous findings that not all CRP genes are
Minute genes [61,95,104].

Discussion
CRP gene haploinsufficiency and the cytoribosome
When one examines the phenotypes of flies carrying chromosomal deletions, one is struck by the remarkable tolerance of
Drosophila to aneuploidy: flies heterozygous for deletions of
hundreds of kilobases of DNA usually have no obvious dominant phenotypes. For this reason, the haploinsufficiency of
single genes is all the more remarkable. It is even more striking that the vast majority of these haploinsufficient genes
encode proteins of the cytoribosome and that haploinsufficiency is not apparent for genes encoding components of
equally elaborate cellular complexes, such as mitoribosomes
or spliceosomes. What accounts for the exquisite dosage sensitivity of CRP genes?
The primary cause of CRP gene haploinsufficiency is reasonably clear: halving the copy number of a CRP gene results in
reduced mRNA expression of that CRP [105]. Similarly,
depleting CRP mRNAs through antisense- or RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated approaches can also produce Minute
phenotypes [106,107] (SJM and SJL, unpublished data). As
there appear to be no compensatory increases in transcription [105], reducing dosages of CRP genes must result in
reduced CRP protein levels in the absence of dramatic
changes in mRNA stability or CRP protein turnover. How

then does the reduction in the level of a single CRP result in
impaired cytoribosomal function and reduced general protein
synthesis, and how is this manifested as the Minute
phenotype?
One possibility, termed the 'balance hypothesis' [108,109], is
linked to the multisubunit nature of the cytoribosome. It
posits that an imbalance in the concentrations of CRPs results
in the assembly of incomplete and non-functional ribosomal
subunits. Indeed, it is known that depletion of individual
CRPs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes inefficient ribosomal subunit assembly and/or function [110,111]. Nevertheless, the balance hypothesis also predicts that overexpression
of individual CRPs should cause stoichiometric imbalances
and phenotypes similar to those produced by underexpression. This prediction is not upheld in either S. cerevisiae [112]
or D. melanogaster [113]. Consequently, imbalance per se
cannot account for the haploinsufficiency of CRP genes.
A simpler explanation of CRP haploinsufficiency is that a high
concentration of cytoribosomes is required for proper cellular
functions and that the cytoribosome population decreases
sharply when the level of a single CRP is reduced. Cytoribosomes and their components do appear to be required in unusually high quantities: CRP mRNAs are among the most
abundant cellular transcripts both in yeast [114] and in flies
[60], and can account for 50% of all RNA polymerase IImediated transcription [89]. What seems critical, however, to
the high-level production of fully formed cytoribosomes is
that the concentration of each and every CRP never falls
below a minimal level. In other words, cytoribosomal assembly is strictly limited by the availability of the least abundant
component. This is probably not just a matter of simple selfassembly kinetics as improperly assembled ribosomal subunits and excess CRPs are actively degraded in yeast [111,115].
Similarly, RNAi-mediated depletion of single CRPs leads to
the depletion of other CRPs in flies [64], suggesting the existence of similar degradation processes. Consequently, halving
the supply of a single, limiting CRP is expected to halve the
number of functional cytoribosomes. This may be tolerated
by many cellular processes but will have severe effects wherever high protein synthesis is required, such as bristle formation and oocyte production in flies, or growth of S. cerevisiae
in rich media [116]. It appears, therefore, that it is the combination of high demand for cytoribosomes and an assembly
mechanism that assures that the level of the least abundant
CRP determines the final concentration of cytoribosomes that
makes CRP genes so exquisitely and specifically dosage sensitive. This perspective also provides a context for understanding the non-additivity of Minute mutations [117], where

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R216

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/10/R216

Genome Biology 2007,

combinations of Minute mutations usually do not have a
cumulative effect, but rather result in a phenotype similar to
that of the most severe individual Minute mutant.
If adequate levels of cytoribosomes depend not so much on
precise equimolar CRP concentrations as a minimal concentration of each and every CRP, then we should expect that variation in the expression of different CRPs (above the
minimum level) might normally be tolerated in vivo. Such
variation could be the result of differences in rates of gene
transcription, mRNA translation, or mRNA/protein stability.
This view provides a framework for understanding the spectrum of haploinsufficient phenotypes associated with CRP
genes, which ranges from no obvious phenotypes, through
bristle defects and reduced fecundity and viability, to dominant sterility or haplolethality in the most severe cases. That
is, the severity of Minute phenotypes may be related to the
rates at which individual CRPs are normally produced
[105,106].
In reality, the explanation of CRP gene haploinsufficiency is
probably more complicated than cytoribosome assembly relying simply on minimal CRP concentrations. The exact function, position or stoichiometry of CRPs within the
cytoribosome may determine whether its gene is haploinsufficient and the severity of the Minute phenotype. For
instance, our finding that the gene encoding the eIF-2α translation initiation factor subunit is a Minute could indicate that
haploinsufficient CRP genes encode ribosomal components
involved specifically in translation initiation. As another
example, RpLP1 and RpLP2 are the only CRPs required in
two copies per cytoribosome [15] and, consequently, they
must be produced at twice the level of all other CRPs. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both RpLP1 and RpLP2
are haploinsufficient (Table 4) [50]. It may even be the case
that the haploinsufficiency of some CRP genes arises by less
conventional mechanisms. For example, the introns of 27
CRP genes host genes for small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)
[118-122], a class of non-coding RNAs that guide post-transcriptional modifications of rRNA molecules necessary for
the maturation and incorporation of rRNA into ribosomes
[123]. The expression of intronic snoRNAs depends upon the
expression and processing of mRNAs from the host gene
[124]. Consequently, mutations that reduce expression or
splicing of CRP transcripts harboring snoRNAs will simultaneously deplete the cell of both a CRP and properly processed
rRNA molecules, thereby impairing cytoribosome biogenesis
in two different ways. Although 21 of the 27 CRP genes that
carry snoRNA genes within their introns are Minute or likely
Minute genes (data not shown), the presence of intronic
snoRNA genes cannot be the sole factor determining CRP
gene haploinsufficiency. Indeed, we have not found any single
factor that clearly determines the degree of dosage sensitivity
exhibited by different CRP genes.

Volume 8, Issue 10, Article R216

Marygold et al. R216.21

Regardless of the exact causes and mechanisms of haploinsufficiency, it is pertinent to ask why the majority of CRPs are
expressed so close to the level of sufficiency, such that loss of
one gene copy is debilitating, rather than being synthesized in
excess? One possibility concerns economics: cytoribosomal
synthesis is an incredibly costly affair [89] and excessive CRP
production would both be wasteful and monopolize the limited resources of the cell. A second possibility is that CRP levels are normally constrained to guard against inappropriate
activation of cell growth, proliferation or apoptosis - processes in which CRPs and cytoribosomes have been postulated
to play direct roles [125]. A final and intriguing possibility is
that the barely sufficient expression levels of some CRP genes
may have evolved as a viral defense mechanism. Cherry et al.
[64] found that reducing the levels of 64 of the 79 principal
CRPs by RNAi inhibits the propagation of Drosophila C virus
in Drosophila adults and cultured cells. Because this virus
requires high concentrations of cytoribosomes in its host cell
to undergo efficient translation, tightly controlled expression
of CRP genes at levels just sufficient for normal growth and
development may protect against viral infection and provide
a selective advantage. Interestingly, we found a modest correlation between a CRP gene being a Minute and it being able to
inhibit virus replication in this assay. Clearly, further work
will be required to test whether there is truly a relationship
between normal CRP gene expression levels and susceptibility to viruses.
Minute mutations attracted the attention of early geneticists
because they were isolated so often in D. melanogaster. In
fact, Schultz said in 1929, "...so many have been found that
this mutant type is one of the most frequent in Drosophila"
[117]. As a considerable number of Minute mutants have also
been isolated in other Drosophila species [60], one might be
justified in thinking Drosophila are unusually sensitive to
CRP gene haploinsufficiency. On the other hand, the phenotypic consequences of CRP gene haploinsufficiency may simply be more noticeable in flies because they include
conspicuous changes in external morphology. In fact,
'Minute-ness' may be a widespread phenomenon that is
under-recognized because CRP gene haploinsufficiency has
different and varied phenotypic consequences in other organisms. Recent research suggests this is the case [116,126-132].
For example, RPS5 haploinsufficiency disrupts cell division
and causes developmental and growth phenotypes in Arabidopsis [126]; several CRP genes are haploinsufficient for suppression of nerve sheath tumors in zebrafish [127]; and
RPS19 haploinsufficiency is a causative factor of DiamondBlackfan anemia in humans [128,130]. In fact, our reliance on
the obvious bristle phenotype to distinguish Minute from
non-Minute loci may present a biased assessment of CRP
gene haploinsufficiency in the fly: it is quite possible that the
22 CRP genes classified as non-Minute in this study are associated with more subtle haploinsufficient phenotypes. How
reduced CRP expression gives rise to diverse phenotypes is a
mystery that, at least in part, reflects our current ignorance of

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R216

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/10/R216

the regulation and roles of CRPs in different cell types. This is
certainly a topic worthy of more research.

Conclusion

We have assessed an idea that has been discussed for more
than three decades; namely, that the haploinsufficient Minute
loci of Drosophila correspond to the genes encoding protein
components of ribosomes [2,133]. Our results confirm this
idea and add important details. We have shown that Minute
genes encode proteins of cytoplasmic ribosomes and not
mitochondrial ribosomes, and we have defined the subset of
CRP genes that are haploinsufficient. While duplicate genes
encoding tissue-specific CRPs are not associated with Minute
phenotypes, it is not otherwise clear what distinguishes the
CRP genes that are haploinsufficient from those that are not.
We identified a single Minute gene encoding a different kind
of protein, a cytoplasmic translation initiation factor subunit.
This hints that haploinsufficient CRP genes may encode proteins specifically involved in translation initiation, although
further work is obviously needed to test this idea.
Minute genes account for the vast majority of the haploinsufficient genes in the D. melanogaster genome with effects on
fertility and viability strong enough to prevent the recovery of
chromosomal deletions in the absence of corresponding
duplications. Indeed, there are very few additional genes (for
example, dpp [134], Abd-B [135]) or chromosomal regions
(for example, Tpl [136], wupA [137], Fs(1)10A [138]) unequivocally associated with haplolethality or haplosterility. (A
few other regions have been reported but not investigated in
detail.) The most immediate practical use for our data will be
in systematic efforts to maximize genome deletion coverage.
Knowing which specific genes are haploinsufficient will make
it feasible to flank each one as closely as possible with pairs of
deletions, or to delete these genes in the presence of duplications or transgenic rescue constructs. Further improvements
in deletion coverage will undoubtedly identify and map the
remaining haplolethal or haplosterile loci.
Collectively, our inventories of the RP genes and Minute loci
of D. melanogaster provide a solid foundation for further
studies of RPs, ribosomes, and the causes and consequences
of haploinsufficiency in flies and other organisms.

Materials and methods
Bioinformatics
RefSeq human RP sequences were obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information [139]. The
FlyBase BLASTp service [140] was used to identify high scoring hits from among the annotated proteins of D. melanogaster; tBLASTn was used when orthologs were not
identified by a BLASTp search. The ExPASy proteomics
server [141] was used to compute the average pI and molecular weight of the RPs. The percentage identity between

human and D. melanogaster RP sequences or between D.
melanogaster RP pairs was calculated using the NPS@ ClustalW alignment tool at the Pôle Bioinformatique Lyonnais
using default parameters [142,143]. KA/KS values were estimated using the program package PAML [144]. cDNA clone
data were obtained from FlyBase [60].
The identification of CRP gene orthologs and the plotting of
their evolutionary emergence (Figure 1) were achieved using
a combinatorial approach. First, sequences corresponding to
the relevant CRP genes from D. melanogaster and Homo
sapiens were used as queries in BLASTn, BLASTp, tBLASTn
and BLAT searches of the genomes of other Drosophilid and
insect species using the FlyBase BLAST server [140] and the
UCSC Genome Bioinformatics BLAT server [145,146]. High
scoring matches were judged to be potential orthologs and
were analyzed further using the FlyBase OrthoView tool [87].
Second, the coding sequences (CDS) of relevant CRP genes
from D. melanogaster and H. sapiens were used as queries in
BLASTn searches of the GLEANR CDS prediction sets of
other Drosophilid species [140]; phylogenetic trees were then
generated from the high scoring matches, with the CDS of S.
cerevisisae CRPs as roots, using the ClustalW tools at EMBLEBI [147]. Third, NCBI Homologene [148] was searched for
any relevant homology calls: RpLP0-like, RpL7-like and
RpL24-like were found in HomoloGene clusters 102093,
64526 and 9462, respectively. The results of all these analyses
were then compared, with the most parsimonious
interpretations being used to annotate the dendrogram
shown in Figure 1.

Assessing Minute phenotypes and mapping Minute
mutations
In order to compile a list of all genetically defined Minute loci,
we first catalogued all the Minute loci described in the fly literature [2,54,55,60]. We then inspected deletions for all
genomic regions having deletion coverage to confirm or
refute the existence of these Minute loci and to identify any
new Minute loci that had previously gone undetected. Minute
phenotypes were scored primarily by visual inspection of
bristle length, although body size, developmental timing, fertility and viability were considered when information was
available. Deletion-bearing flies were outcrossed to Oregon-R
or Canton-S wild-type strains whenever we could not unambiguously score Minute phenotypes in stocks. The phenotypic
effects of deleting or disrupting X-linked genes were assessed
only in heterozygous females. Finally, the cytological locations of all verified Minute loci were correlated with the positions of RP genes to identify candidate genes.
To assess RP gene haploinsufficiency directly, we inspected

described above. For some deletions that had not been characterized molecularly, it was necessary to refine the mapping

molecularly mapped mutations or with polytene chromosome
preparations to determine whether RP genes were deleted.
(In a few cases, RP genes were classified as lacking deletion
coverage when the only existing deletions were not useful in a
practical sense owing to their associated chromosomal rearrangements or extremely large size.) A transposable element
insertion was judged to disrupt a RP gene if it failed to complement other mutations in the gene, if we saw a Minute phenotype in the insertion strain, or if the transposon is inserted
in the protein-coding region or 5' UTR of the gene based on
FlyBase annotations [87] or our own BLAST analyses. (By
these criteria, many nearby insertions, intronic insertions,
and insertions in 3' UTRs were not used in our analysis.) We
included molecularly characterized point mutations in our
analyses for the few RP genes where they were available.
Molecularly uncharacterized Minute point mutations from
the Bloomington Stock Center were complementation tested
against mutations and deletions known to disrupt or delete
specific RP genes.
Fly strains were obtained from the Bloomington, Szeged,
Kyoto and Harvard Drosophila Stock Centers. Helene Doerflinger and Daniel St Johnston provided Df(3R)IR16 and
Df(3R)MR22 stocks, and Yuri Sedkov and Alexander Mazo
provided mRpL16A, mRpL16B and mRpL16C stocks.
