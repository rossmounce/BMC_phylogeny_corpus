Abstract
Background: Tenascins are a family of glycoproteins found primarily in the extracellular matrix of
embryos where they help to regulate cell proliferation, adhesion and migration. In order to learn
more about their origins and relationships to each other, as well as to clarify the nomenclature used
to describe them, the tenascin genes of the urochordate Ciona intestinalis, the pufferfish Tetraodon
nigroviridis and Takifugu rubripes and the frog Xenopus tropicalis were identified and their gene
organization and predicted protein products compared with the previously characterized tenascins
of amniotes.
Results: A single tenascin gene was identified in the genome of C. intestinalis that encodes a
polypeptide with domain features common to all vertebrate tenascins. Both pufferfish genomes
encode five tenascin genes: two tenascin-C paralogs, a tenascin-R with domain organization
identical to mammalian and avian tenascin-R, a small tenascin-X with previously undescribed GK
repeats, and a tenascin-W. Four tenascin genes corresponding to tenascin-C, tenascin-R, tenascinX and tenascin-W were also identified in the X. tropicalis genome. Multiple sequence alignment
reveals that differences in the size of tenascin-W from various vertebrate classes can be explained
by duplications of specific fibronectin type III domains. The duplicated domains are encoded on
single exons and contain putative integrin-binding motifs. A phylogenetic tree based on the
predicted amino acid sequences of the fibrinogen-related domains demonstrates that tenascin-C
and tenascin-R are the most closely related vertebrate tenascins, with the most conserved repeat
and domain organization. Taking all lines of evidence together, the data show that the tenascins
referred to as tenascin-Y and tenascin-N are actually members of the tenascin-X and tenascin-W
gene families, respectively.
Conclusion: The presence of a tenascin gene in urochordates but not other invertebrate phyla
suggests that tenascins may be specific to chordates. Later genomic duplication events led to the
appearance of four family members in vertebrates: tenascin-C, tenascin-R, tenascin-W and
tenascin-X.

Figure 1
The tenascins
The tenascins. Six tenascins have been described in the literature: tenascins-C, -R, -X, -W, -Y and -N. This figure shows the
repeat and domain organization of a tenascin that is representative of the group belonging to the genus where it was first
described. The shapes found in the diagrams at the right symbolize the N-terminal linker domain (home plate), heptad repeats
(zig-zag), EGF-like repeats (diamonds and partial diamonds), FN type III domains (rectangles), and a C-terminal FReD (circle).
The serine/proline-rich domains of tenascin-X and tenascin-Y are indicated by an oval.

Background
Tenascins are a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins charcterized by an N-terminal globular domain and
heptad repeats, which facilitate multimerization; one or
more tenascin-type epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
repeats (consensus sequence X4CX3CX5CX4CXCX8C); a
series of fibronectin (FN) type III domains, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-related domain (FReD). Diversity within
the family exists at many levels. Each species of vertebrate
examined to date has more than one tenascin gene, and
the gene products themselves are frequently alternatively
spliced (e.g., see [1,2]). In addition, electron microscopy
reveals purified tenascins with 6 arms (hexabrachions) as
well as trimers, dimers and monomers [3,4]. Tenascins are
particularly abundant in the embryonic extracellular
matrix, but some reappear in the adult during regeneration, inflammatory disease, tumorigenesis and wound
healing [2,5,6]. Tenascins act through interactions with
cell surface receptors (reviewed by [4]; see also [7]) as well
as by binding to and blocking sites on other extracellular
matrix molecules (e.g., see [8]).
There are 6 names for tenascin gene products found in the
current literature (Figure 1). Tenascin-C, the first tenascin
to be cloned and sequenced [9-11], has 13.5 (chicken) or
14.5 (mammals) EGF-like repeats and up to 15 FN type III
domains. The prominent expression of tenascin-C in tendons and embryonic extracellular matrix was used to create the name for the gene family, which comes from tenere
(to hold) and nasci (to be born; see [12]). Tenascin-R was
the second member of the tenascin family to be identified

[13]. In birds and mammals, tenascin-R genes encode 4.5
EGF-like repeats and 9 FN type III domains. Tenascin-X is
the name given to a large mammalian tenascin first identified as "gene X" in the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class III gene region in both mouse and human
[14,15]. This tenascin has 18.5 EGF-like repeats, and the
tenascin-X genes of mouse and human encode 29 and 32
FN type III domains, respectively. The series of FN type III
domains are interrupted in both mouse and human
tenascin-X by a proline-rich stretch of about 100 amino
acids. Tenascin-Y [16] is an avian tenascin described as
being most similar to mammalian tenascin-X (the name
"Y" comes from being "almost X"). The justification for a
different name was because the similarity between the
FReD of tenascin-Y and human tenascin-X was considerably lower than that between species orthologs of tenascinC or tenascin-R. As in tenascin-X, the FN type III domains
of tenascin-Y are interrupted by a region containing
numerous serine-proline motifs. A fifth tenascin was
eponymously named tenascin-W by Weber et al. [17].
Tenascin-W from both zebrafish [17] and mouse [18] has
3.5 EGF-like repeats, but a Danio rerio tenascin-W cDNA
encodes five FN type III domains, whereas a murine cDNA
encodes 9. The most recent tenascin to be described is
tenascin-N [19], which like tenascin-W was named for its
discoverer. Only characterized in the mouse, tenascin-N is
identical to murine tenascin-W except for three additional
FN type III domains (i.e., a total of 12 domains).
No tenascins have been identified in the Caenorhabditis
elegans genome or in arthropod genomes, and the only

complete cDNA sequences from poikilotherms come
from D. rerio [17,20,21]. This has limited the phylogenetic
analysis of the origins of tenascins, the identification of
evolutionarily conserved regions, domains and potential
receptor recognition motifs, as well as the ability to clarify
the relationships between the different members of the
tenascin gene family. Recently the genomes of a variety of
organisms have been completely, or nearly completely,
sequenced, facilitating the identification of tenascin genes
in fish, amphibians, and invertebrate chordates. Using
searches based on conservation of amino acid sequences
and domain architecture, we have identified in silico the
putative tenascin gene products of the freshwater green
pufferfish, Tetraodon nigroviridis, the Japanese tiger pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes, the pipid frog, Xenopus tropicalis,
and the ascidian, Ciona intestinalis. These studies show
that the basic domain architecture of tenascins is highly
conserved between an invertebrate chordate and vertebrates and that there are only four members of the
tenascin family in vertebrates: tenascin-C, tenascin-R,
tenascin-W and tenascin-X.

Results
Ciona intestinalis tenascin
Analysis of the genomic sequence of the urochordate C.
intestinalis [22] using the BLAT [23] and SNAP (UCSC
Genome Bioinformatics [24]) [25] programs reveals a single tenascin-like gene product. It was necessary to modify
this predicted protein by visual inspection of the genomic
sequence to remove some parts of predicted exons that
did not show any homology to the known tenascins and
by the identification of open reading frames complementing missing parts of three of the fibronectin type III
repeats. The sequence of the N-terminus was confirmed
by predicting a potential signal peptide upstream of the
EGF repeats followed by RT-PCR using primers homologous to the region harboring the methionine N-terminal
to the predicted signal peptide and a primer from the previously predicted region. The coding part of this tenascin
gene lies between position 1585–21365 of scaffold 366
that is located on chromosome 9 (Laboratory for Developmental Biology and Genome Biology [26]; see [27]).
The domain organization predicted by SMART [26]
reveals an N-terminal signal sequence (aa 13–32), 4 and
1/2 heptad repeats (aa 136–168; confirmed by Paircoil
[see Methods]), 8 tenascin-type EGF-like repeats (aa 208–
458), 18 FN type III domains (aa 469–2119) and a FReD
(2128–2355). The C-terminal portion of the predicted
protein is confirmed by an EST [GenBank
EST:BW395090.1] that includes the FReD, as well as by
the 9 ESTs in Gene Cluster 02393 of the cDNA resources
of the Ghost Database [29]. In addition, a highly-related
gene product is encoded on C. savigyni contig 41574 [GenBank CoreNucleotide:AACT01041574]. The corrected C.
intestinalis protein sequence has 2355 aa (Figure 2A), a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/60

predicted pI of 7.63 and a molecular mass of 262 kDa. A
stick diagram of this tenascin, the first reported from an
invertebrate, is shown in Figure 2B. Note that the third FN
type III domain of C. intestinalis tenascin contains the
tripeptide motif RGE in a region that is likely to be
exposed to receptor binding [30] and that corresponds to
the position of the integrin-binding RGD motifs of
tenascin-C in many vertebrates (e.g., see Figure 3A). As
others have shown that the RGE motif can have similar
properties to the RGD motif [31], this may represent an
integrin-binding region in tenascin from C. intestinalis.
To analyze the expression pattern of this novel tenascin
we raised an antiserum against the second FN type III
domain expressed in E. coli (see Methods). In whole
mounts this antiserum recognized the thin tunic that
envelopes the larva, the extracellular matrix at the base of
the tail, and periodically arrayed structures found on
either side of the nerve cord that may correspond to the
dorsal portions of the primary muscles of the tail (Figure
2C). This latter staining pattern is reminiscent of the
immunostaining of the sclerotome in chick and mouse
embryos with antibodies against tenascin-C [32]. The
tunics of the larvae incubated with preimmune serum
were often labelled, but the matrix at the base of the tail
and associated with the tail musculature was not (Figure
2D).
The genome sequencing of another urochordate, Oikopleura dioica, has been completed (Trace Archive Database
Mega BLAST [33]). Using the Hidden Markov Model on
the alignments of all O. dioica FReDs we could identify a
putative tenascin gene in this distinct urochordate as well.
Unfortunately, we were not able to identify the entire O.
dioica tenascin gene because the genome scaffolds have
not been assembled yet (data not shown).
Tetraodon and Takifugu each have five tenascins
Using a BLASTP [34] search of predicted proteins from all
translated sequences with the chicken tenascin-C FReD
(selected because it generated fewer non-tenascin hits
than searches with other repeats or domains), four potential tenascin-like sequences were identified in the freshwater pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis (see Table 1 for NCBI
Protein Database accession numbers [see Additional file:
1]). These translated sequences were then entered into the
BLAT field of the T. nigroviridis Gene Browser at Genoscope, which returned four predicted tenascin-like proteins: 1) Genoscope identifier GSTENT00020055001,

A rabbit antiserum against a recombinant fragment of C. intestinalis tenascin was used to immunostain whole larvae. The antiserum recognized the tunic, a line of matrix in the tail (arrows),
and faintly labelled the tail muscles (between the arrows). D. The rabbit preimmune serum inconsistently labelled the tunic but
not the line of matrix in tail or the tail muscles.

searches also revealed five putative tenascin genes: 1)

Pufferfish have two tenascin-Cs
Two of the predicted tenascin sequences found in the
Tetraodon nigroviridis genome showed the most similarity
to zebrafish, chicken, and the numerous mammalian
tenascin-Cs following BLASTP analyses of their FReDs and
first and last FN type III domains. Both of these tenascins
were predicted by SMART and visual inspection to include
an N-terminal linker, a series of heptad repeats, 12.5 EGF-

like repeats and a C-terminal FReD. One of the two
sequences contains 12 FN type III domains
(GSTENT00025206001) and the other contains 10 FN
type III domains (GSTENT00020055001; Figure 3A; note
that it was necessary for us to complete several predicted
partial FN type III domains by identifying missing exons
by translating nearby open reading frames in the genomic
sequence). The amino acid sequences of the FReDs of the
two tenascins share 80% identity and 94% similarity (Figure 3B). Bayesian inference of the phylogenetic trees predicts that these proteins are more closely related to each
other than to any other vertebrate tenascin. Because of
their sequence similarity to each other and to other
tenascin-Cs, overall domain organization, and predicted
evolutionary proximity, we will refer to these paralogs as
tenascin-Ca (modified from GSTENT00020055001) and
tenascin-Cb (modified from GSTENT00025206001). Like
tenascin-C in Gallus gallus and man, tenascin-Cb contains
an RGD integrin-binding motif in its third FN type III
domain in a region predicted to be exposed to receptor
binding. In tenascin-Ca this region contains the potentially reactive motif KGD. Similarly duplicated tenascin-C
genes were identified in the Takifugu rubripes genome (Figure 3A). SMART reveals that one predicted protein
(scaffold_2387.1 and SINFRUT00000156379) has heptad
repeats, 12.5 tenascin-type EGF-like repeats, 10 FN type III
domains and a C-terminal FReD. It was also necessary to
modify this predicted protein by identifying open reading

frames in the genomic sequence that corresponded to
missing exons that completed several FN type III domains.
The domain organization of the corrected tenascin is identical to that of Tetraodon nigroviridis tenascin-Ca. The
FReDs of the two pufferfish tenascin-Cas are 95% identical and 99% similar. The second Takifugu rubripes
tenascin-C (scaffold_148.12 and SINFRUT00000139096)
is predicted by SMART and direct examination to have
heptad repeats, 13.5 EGF-like repeats, 15 FN type III
domains and a C-terminal FReD. Like Tetraodon nigroviridis tenascin-Cb, it has an RGD motif in the third FN
type III domain (Figure 3A). The amino acid sequences of
the tenascin-Cb FReDs from the two species of pufferfish
are 92% identical and 98% similar.
Tenascin-R in Tetraodon and Takifugu
There are two predicted protein sequences lying side-byside on chromosome 15 of T. nigroviridis that, when considered as a single gene product, contain an N-terminal
linker, heptad repeats, 3.5 EGF-like repeats, 7 FN type III
domains and a C-terminal FReD (GSTENT00028393001
and GSTENP00028394001). Phylogenetic analysis of the
FReD and terminal FN type III domain show this potential
tenascin to be most similar to amniote and zebrafish
tenascin-R. Like tenascin-R in D. rerio it is adjacent to, and
in the opposite orientation from, a tenascin-W gene (see
below). The T. nigroviridis tenascin-R sequence, however,
is not complete; the genomic sequence found between the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/60

regions encoding the EGF-like repeats and FN type III
domains contains approximately 500 undetermined
nucleotides. In contrast, the Takifugu rubripes tenascin-R
(SINFRUP00000066378), found by BLASTP of the NCBI
Protein Database, is missing only the signal sequence at
the N-terminus. The remaining predicted protein includes
heptad repeats, 4.5 EGF-like repeats, 9 FN type III
domains and a C-terminal FReD. Alignment of the two
pufferfish tenascin-R sequences confirms that the fourth
EGF-like repeat and first two FN type III domains of
Tetraodon nigroviridis are missing from the predicted protein. The domain architecture of Takifugu rubripes
tenascin-R is identical to that found in the predicted
tenascin-R proteins encoded in genomes of D. rerio, G. gallus, mouse and man (e.g., see Figure 1). Pufferfish
tenascin-R does not contain an RGD motif, but the third
FN type III domains contain an IDG motif, which is a
potential recognition site for the alpha4/alpha9 family of
integrins [36]. This motif is also found in the same location on D. rerio, G. gallus, M. musculus and human
tenascin-R.
Unique repeats in pufferfish tenascin-X
In addition to the BLASTP searches with the chicken FReD
sequence (see above), a BLAT search of the T. nigroviridis
genome was carried out using the FReD sequence of a partial putative tenascin-X identified by others [35] in Takifugu rubripes [NCBI Protein:CAD45004]. This revealed a
novel tenascin with numerous features not yet described
in the gene family (GSTENT00034161001). Note that it
was necessary to identify an exon in the genomic sequence
to derive the final amino acid sequence illustrated in Figure 4A. The putative Tetraodon nigroviridis tenascin-X is
much smaller than mammalian tenascin-X: it encodes at
most 1108 amino acids and is predicted to have a molecular mass of 122 kDa. The COILS program (see Methods)
predicts that it has heptad repeats near the N-terminus
(underlined in Figure 4A), and SMART reveals a single
tenascin-type EGF-like sequence that, as in tenascin-Y, is
followed by what may be considered a partial EGF-like
repeat. Separating the EGF-like repeat from one partial
and three complete FN type III domains is a stretch of 485
amino acids, many of which are charged or polar. The first
48 amino acids in this region contains numerous charged
residues, but a BLASTP search fails to reveal any similarities between this region and any other sequence. The next
136 residues make up 8 complete and one partial copies
of a previously undescribed simple tandem repeat of 16
amino acids (GKEQKKATEGENTLSP) that mostly contains polar or charged residues. BLASTP searches with
these repeats fail to reveal significant homologies with
proteins from vertebrates, but the region is 43% similar to
a collagen-binding, surface protein from Bacillus cereus
[NCBI Protein:YP_082380]. The final 301 residues of this
region are also highly charged and, when examined by

Tetraodon nigroviridis tenascin-X. A. The predicted amino acid sequence of T. nigroviridis tenascin-X. Putative heptad
repeats (underlined) are found near the N-terminus. Between amino acids 41 and 86 are one complete are two partial EGF-like
repeats. This is followed by a short (48 amino acid) linking region and 7 complete and two partial GK repeats (between amino
acids 135 and 270). Between the GK repeats and amino acid 571 is a region rich in charged amino acids. Three complete and
one partial FN type III domains are found between amino acids 572 and 884. There is a FReD at the C-terminus. B. The repeat
and domain organization of pufferfish tenascin-X. The region between amino acids 87 and 571 is similar to the DUF612 domain
of UNC-89. C. The T. nigroviridis tenascin-X gene (TNX) is found between the genes encoding cytochrome p450 21-hydroxylase (cp450), C4 complement and retinoid X receptor beta (RXRB). The same genes overlap or flank tenascin-X genes in birds
and mammals.

BLASTP on their own, fail to show homologies with other
known proteins. However, when the entire predicted
open reading frame of T. nigroviridis tenascin-X is used in
a BLASTP run, the 16-residue repeats and the adjacent
301-residue region are recognized as a DUF612 domain
(Pfam 04747; Figure 4B). The function of the DUF612
domain is unknown, but it is found in C. elegans UNC-89,
a large multidomain protein required for myofibril assembly [37].

The unusual repeat and domain structure of T. nigroviridis
tenascin-X is also seen in Takifugu rubripes tenascin-X. This
was determined by a BLAT search of the T. rubripes
genome with the FReD of Tetraodon nigroviridis tenascin-X.
This search revealed a very large predicted protein
(GENSCAN00000009040), which, upon further examination, was found to be composed of three closely clustered but distinctive gene products. The middle gene
encodes a predicted tenascin with one EGF-like repeat, 19

charged repeats similar to those found in T. nigroviridis
tenascin-X interrupted by two partial charged repeats, a
charged domain that is 69% identical to amino acids
271–572 in T. nigroviridis tenascin-X, one partial and three
complete FN type III domains, and a C-terminal FReD.
Phylogenetic analysis shows that the FReDs from the
putative pufferfish tenascin-Xs are most similar to the
FReDs of chicken tenascin-Y and mammalian tenascin-X
(see below). However, the most striking evidence that the
unusual tenascin-X of T. nigroviridis is indeed a member of
this particular tenascin subfamily is its genomic location:
it is found on chromosome 8 flanked by the genes encoding cytochrome p450 21-hydroxylase and C4 complement (Figure 4C). In mammals, the tenascin-X gene
overlaps with the cytochrome p450 21-hydroxylase gene,
which is encoded on the opposite strand of DNA, and lies
adjacent to one of two C4 complement genes (e.g., see
[15]). The retinoid X receptor beta gene, which lies next to
the C4 gene in T. nigroviridis, is also an MHC complex
gene in mammals found approximately 1 Mb from the
human tenascin-X gene on chromosome 6. Thus, both by
sequence homology and by synteny, the small gene
encoding a single tenascin-type EGF-like sequence and
only three complete FN type III domains corresponds to
the T. nigroviridis ortholog of mammalian tenascin-X.

Tenascin-W diversity is generated by duplications of
a FN type III domain. A. The tenascin-W of Tetraodon
nigroviridis is predicted to be encoded on 14 exons. The figure shows a schematic of the predicted protein's repeat and
domain organization and the corresponding exons. The Nterminal linker is encoded on the first exon. The second
exon encodes the heptad repeats and the EGF-like repeats.
This is conserved in all of the tenascin-Ws illustrated here.
FN type III domains 1, 2 and 4 are encoded on two exons,
but the third FN type III domain is encoded on a single exon
(shaded). The FReDs of all of the tenascin-Ws is encoded on
five exons. B. The full-length predicted tenascin-W of Takifugu rubripes has five FN type III domains. The additional
domain is the result of a duplication of the third FN type III
domain, which is encoded on a single exon. C, D. The predicted tenascin-Ws of Danio rerio (C) and Gallus gallus (D)
have 6 FN type III domains, the apparent consequence of an
additional duplication of the third FN type III domain. E, F. In
mouse (Mus) and man (Homo) the very large tenascin-W predicted proteins can also be explained by multiple duplications
of the third FN type III domain. Note that the first FN type III
domains of the pufferfish, but not the other tenascin-Ws, are
encoded on two exons (black). The relative sizes of the
exons and introns between the different genera are not
shown to scale.

Tenascin-W: diversity through domain duplication
A putative gene product with a repeat and domain structure similar to zebrafish tenascin-W was identified in T.
nigroviridis (GSTENT00028391001). This tenascin gene
encodes an N-terminal linker, heptad repeats, 3.5 EGFlike repeats, four FN type III domains, and a C-terminal
FReD. BLASTP of the first FN type III domain, the fourth
FN type III domain, and the FReD all reveal that this putative gene product is most similar to tenascin-W from
zebrafish and mouse. A similar tenascin-W was found in
the genome of Takifugu rubripes (SINFRUP00000069989),
but this tenascin-W has five FN type III domains instead
of four. There is an RGD motif in the fifth FN type III
domain of T. rubripes tenascin-W, but this motif is not
found in tenascin-W from Tetraodon nigroviridis.

The predicted tenascin-W orthologs from T. nigroviridis,
Takifugu rubripes, D. rerio, G. gallus, M. musculus and
human all have an N-terminal linker, heptad repeats, 3.5
EGF-like repeats and a C-terminal FReD. They differ, however, in the numbers of FN type III domains encoded in
their respective tenascin-W genes. The smallest number of
domains is seen in Tetraodon nigroviridis (with four) and
Takifugu rubripes (with five); D. rerio and chicken have 6,
mouse has 12, and man has 9 FN type III domains (Figure
5). Despite the differences in numbers of FN type III
domains, each of the tenascin-W genes listed above is
found in each genome immediately adjacent to the

Alignment of the duplicated FN type III domains oftenascin-W. The third FN type III domain of Tetraodon nigroviridis
tenascin-W has been duplicated one or more times in other tensacin-Ws. Alignment reveals the conservation of sequences
within these domains, including putative integrin binding motifs near the N-terminus of the domain (underlined). The region
where an integrin-binding RGD sequence in an exposed loop is found in chicken tenascin-C is indicated by asterisks. Several
tenascin-Ws have a potentially active KGD motif in this region. At the left is a rooted phylogenetic tree generated by

lineages. Identical amino acids are shaded blue, while similar amino acids are boxed in yellow.

tenascin-R gene and encoded in the opposite orientation.
For example, in Tetraodon nigroviridis the two tenascin
genes are separated by only 10 kb on chromosome 15,
and in mouse the two tenascin genes are only 15 kb away
from each other on chromosome 1. In D. rerio, the two
genes are encoded on chromosome 2 (Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute, zebrafish genome assembly Zv5). Moreover, the different tenascin-W genes share nearly identical
intron/exon organization in each species examined (Figure 5). In D. rerio, G. gallus, M. musculus and man the first
tenascin-W FN type III domain is encoded on a single
exon, the second FN type III domain is encoded on two
exons, and the final FN type III domain, adjacent to the
FReD, is encoded on two exons. The intron/exon junction
sites are the same in each of these species. As in other
tenascins, the heptad linkers and EGF-like repeats are
encoded on a single exon, and the FReD is encoded by five
exons. In the pufferfish, tenascin-W is identically encoded
except for the first FN type III domain, which is formed
from two exons (Figure 5). The variation in the numbers
of FN type III domains between the various tenascin-W
predicted proteins seems to be the result of repeated
duplications of the third FN type III domain. There is only
one of these domains in T. nigroviridis, and it is encoded
by a single exon. In Takifugu rubripes, Sequence Alignment
and Tree Construction using Hidden Markov mOdels

(SATCHMO) analysis [38] reveals that the third FN type
III domain has recently duplicated, resulting in a total of
five FN type III domains. In D. rerio and G. gallus this
domain has duplicated twice, resulting in the 6 total FN
type III domains. Evidence of this duplication is provided
by the very high sequence similarities between these particular domains, as well as from construction of a phylogenetic tree based on their sequences (Figure 6). This tree
also reveals that the duplications most likely took place
after the evolutionary separation of the species examined,
since the descendents of the third FN type III domain are
typically most similar within a species than between species. Note that the D. rerio tenascin-W cDNA sequence
reported by Weber et al. [17] only contained five FN type
III repeats. The extra repeat shown here (which corresponds to repeat 3C in Figures 5 and 6) was found in the
genomic sequence where, like all of the duplicated
repeats, it is predicted to be encoded from its own exon.
The presence of this novel FN type III domain in tenascinW transcripts was confirmed by RT-PCR using mRNA
from an adult zebrafish as a source of cDNA template and
primers corresponding to the end of the fourth FN type III
domain and the beginning of the sixth FN type III domain
(see Methods for details). In the mouse, the 12 FN type III
domains are the result of an eight-fold replication of the
third domain, and in man the third FN type III domain is

Xenopus tropicalis tenascins. Four tenascins were identified in the X. tropicalis genome. Stick diagrams of the three complete
sequences are shown here. The X. tropicalis tenascin-C gene encodes 14.5 EGF-like repeats and 8 FN type III domains. There
are no RGD motifs. The domain represented by an oval between the second and third FN type III domains shares sequences
similarities with the DUF612 domain of pufferfish tenascin-X and the SP-domain of avian and mammalian tenascin-X. The
amphibian tenascin-W contains an RGD domain in an exposed loop in the fourth FN type III domain and a KGD motif in the

replicated five times. Sequence similarities and phylogenetic analysis also reveal the possible order in which these
duplications occurred (Figure 6). As one might expect, the
species with the most third FN type III domains, the
mouse, has some repeats that are very similar to each
other: domains 3D and 3F have identical amino acid
sequences, as previously noted by Neidhardt et al. [19].
Xenopus tropicalis tenascins
Four tenascin genes were identified in the genome of the
amphibian Xenopus tropicalis by BLAT searches of the X.
tropicalis Genome Browser Gateway (UCSC Genome Bioinformatics [24]) and by BLASTP searches of the NCBI
Frog Sequence Database (National Center for Biotechnology Information [39]) with the FReD sequences from
chicken and pufferfish tenascins (Figure 7 [see Additional
file: 3]). The tenascin-C predicted from the X. tropicalis
genome (68086_prot), identified by the similarity of its
FReD sequence with that of fish and amniote tenascin-Cs,
has heptad repeats near its N-terminus, 14.5 EGF-like
repeats, and 8 FN type III domains. It does not have an
RGD or RGD-like motif in its FN type III domains. Only a
partial X. tropicalis tenascin-R sequence is found in the
database; it encodes a single FN type III domain and a
FReD (JGI Filtered Gene 30381) at the terminus of scaffold 197. However, a complete tenascin-X was found by
combining two predicted proteins (50684_prot and
63933_prot). When combined the single predicted protein contains heptad repeats, 14 complete and two partial
EGF-like repeats, 10 FN type III domains and a C-terminal
FReD. Between the second and third FN type III domains
is a 649-amino acid region that is not recognized as a

known domain by SMART. Near the center of this region
is a 37-amino acid stretch that shares 70% identity and
89% similarity to part of the serine-proline-rich domain
of tenascin-Y and 59% identity and 72% similarity to part
of the proline-rich domain of human tenascin-X. The
entire region is 38% similar to a portion of UNC-89, but
the SMART program does not predict the presence of a
DUF619 domain. The fourth tenascin found in the X. tropicalis genome is tenascin-W. It was identified by combining two predicted proteins (30377_prot and
scaffold_197.67) using the C-terminal sequence of the
former, since this was the most similar to tenascin FReDs
following alignment. Thus assembled, the X. tropicalis
tenascin-W gene encodes a signal sequence, heptad
repeats, 9.5 EGF-like repeats, five FN type III domains and
a C-terminal FReD. The fourth FN type III domain contains a potentially active RGD motif and the fifth contains
a KGD motif also predicted to be in an exposed loop.
Unlike the other tenascin-Ws described here (Figure 5), X.
tropicalis tenascin-W has 9.5 EGF-like repeats instead of
3.5, and the fourth (not the third) FN type III domain has
duplicated itself once.
Analysis of phylogeny and synteny
A summary of the repeat and domain organizations of the
novel predicted tenascins and the previously described
amniote tenascins is shown in Figure 8. Phylogenetic
reconstruction using Bayesian inference based on the
FReD of the tenascins of pufferfish, X. tropicalis, G. gallus,

tenascin gene family: tenascin-C, tenascin-R, tenascin-W
and tenascin-X (Figure 9). Of these, tenascin-X represents

the most distinctive sequence. A nearly identical tree
based on the FReD sequences was constructed by maximal
likelihood phylogeny (results not shown). As reported by
Chiquet-Ehrismann et al. [40], Erickson [41], and Hughes
[42], the FReDs of tenascin-C and tenascin-R share the
most sequence similarity at the protein level, which provides one indication that they are derived from the same
relatively recent ancestral duplication event. This view is
strongly supported by a consideration of the organization
of the human genome. The identification of regions of the
human genome on different chromosomes that contain
many pairs of related genes (paralogs) has provided
strong support for the model that the genomes of modern
vertebrates evolved from at least one whole genome
duplication in early chordate evolution [43]. The largest
region of paralogy in the human genome is that between
chromosome 1q, which includes the tenascin-R locus at
1q24, and 9q, which contains the tenascin-C locus at
9q33 (block ENSP00000263525 of dataset 5.28; see
[43]). The loci of the tenascin-C and tenascin-R genes are
also known to be part of the MHC loci that exist as paralogous regions on chromosomes 1q, 6p, 9q and 19p. Thus,
although tenascin-X is the most divergent family member
in terms of protein sequence, its gene locus on chromo-

some 6q21.3 is paralogous with that of the tenascin-C and
-R genes [44,45]. The paralogy of the MHC region is wellconserved in mice and, according to comparative mapping information, human chromosome 6 corresponds to
chicken chromosome 16 [46]. Interestingly, the chicken
tenascin-Y gene is located on chromosome 16 and is in
immediate synteny with the complement C4, TAP1, TAP2
and MHC II-like genes that represent orthologs of the
genes present in the human MHCIII locus next to the
human tenascin-X gene (e.g., see [14,15]). As noted
above, the gene neighbors of T. nigroviridis tenascin-X also
correspond to MHC genes. This conserved chromosomal
location between chicken tenascin-Y and its neighboring
genes and the human, mouse and T. nigriviridis tenascinX genes provides the most convincing argument that,
despite distinctions in the polypeptide sequences, these
genes all represent tenascin orthologs.
Although a fourth paralogous MHC gene cluster is
encoded on human chromosome 19p13-1-13.3, no
tenascin is encoded in this region, suggesting that this paralog was lost after the initial large-scale duplication events
[44]. The locus of tenascin-W adjacent to tenascin-R on
chromosome 1 is suggestive of a distinct evolutionary ori-

gin, for example by local tandem duplication of an ancestral tenascin gene. Because the chromosome 1 and 9 MHC
regions are so well-related as to indicate their origin from
the most recent large-scale duplication [44], the positioning of tenascin-W adjacent to tenascin-R suggests either
that: 1) this positioning was ancestral to the duplication
event and a tenascin gene has been lost or transposed
away from adjacent the tenascin-C gene; or 2) the
tenascin-W gene arose by a tandem duplication of
tenascin-R after the original duplication event and with a
relatively rapid rate of change to the polypeptide
sequence. It can also be hypothesized that the tenascin-W
gene was transposed from the original locus on chromosome 19 into its current location soon after the duplication that gave rise to the tenascin-C and tenascin-R genes.
On present evidence we cannot distinguish between these
models, but it is interesting to note that the tenascin-W
protein sequence is equivalently related (around 34%36%) to both tenascin-C and tenascin-R. Finally, in C.
intestinalis, the single tenascin gene is adjacent to a Notch
gene just like all vertebrate tenascins which are located in
close proximity to a Notch gene present in the MHC paralogous regions, supporting the common ancestry.

Discussion
Six different names are currently being used to describe
the tenascins of vertebrates: tenascin-C, tenascin-R,
tenascin-X, tenascin-Y, tenascin-W and tenascin-N. Analysis of intron-exon splice sites, phylogenetic relationships
and synteny shows that this nomenclature is inaccurate
and needlessly complicated, and that there are in fact only
four vertebrate tenascins. The original designations of
tenascin-C and tenascin-R are confirmed by our analyses,
but avian tenascin-Y shares close phylogenetic and
genomic relationships with tenascin-X, and tenascin-N
shares phylogenetic, syntenic and intron-exon junction
homologies with tenascin-W. Since the names tenascin-X
and tenascin-W have clear precedence in the literature and
have been adopted in the majority of published reports,
we recommend that use of the terms tenascin-Y [16,4751] and tenascin-N [19] be discontinued.
Here we report the first example of a tenascin from a nonvertebrate. A predicted tenascin was found in the genomic
sequence of the invertebrate chordate C. intestinalis and is
corroborated as an expressed gene by the identification of
matching ESTs, by cDNA sequencing and by immunohistochemistry. A similar gene product was also identified in
the related species C. savignyi. With only one copy of
tenascin, C. intestinalis may represent an ideal model system for future studies of tenascin function, since analysis
of its knockdown by morpholinos or its misexpression
would not be complicated by the possible compensatory
action of related tenascin gene products. We have also
identified a tenascin-type FReD domain in O. dioica and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/60

expect to identify a full length tenascin when the genomic
sequencing is completed and assembled. Thus, tenascins
are most likely common to all urochordates.
There are no tenascins in Caenorhabiditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. It is now recognized that these organisms have undergone extensive gene loss and that the
Cnidaria have a higher level of gene conservation in comparison to vertebrates [52]. Nevertheless, we could not
identify Cnidarian tenascins from the various databases
(see Methods). Searches of the draft genome sequence of
the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus have also not
revealed tenascin genes. Thus, to date, tenascins appear to
be exclusive to the chordate lineage. Sequences encoding
a tenascin-like FReD domain are included in the Branchiostoma floridae EST database [GenBank EST:CF919227]
[GenBank EST:CF919269] [53], but it is unknown if this
sequence includes adjacent FN type III domains and EGFlike repeats. It will be of interest to know if one or more
tenascin is encoded in the amphioxus genome once this
sequencing project is completed. Of the four vertebrate
tenascins, tenascin-X has the most distinctive FReD
sequence and overall domain organization. We hypothesize that tenascin-X arose from the first tenascin gene
duplication in vertebrates.
Analysis of two pufferfish genomes revealed not four, but
five, tenascins. The fifth tenascin appears to be the result
of a relatively recent duplication of the tenascin-C gene. In
keeping with the established protocol for naming very
similar duplicated genes, we propose that these tenascinC paralogs be referred to as tenascin-Ca and tenascin-Cb.
The two pufferfish studied here are closely related, having
diverged from a common ancestor only 18–30 million
year ago [54]. Nevertheless, the tenascin-Cb genes of these
close relatives encode different numbers of EGF-like
repeats and FN type III domains. This illustrates the
potential for the numbers of these repeats and domains to
change during evolution (see also Hughes [42]) and
points to the potential problems that can stem from giving different names to tenascins on the basis of the numbers of their repeated domains. It will be interesting to
study the expression of these tenascin-C genes in Tetraodon nigroviridis and Takifugu rubripes: do their expression
patterns overlap, or have they evolved distinctive regulatory elements? If so, has their function diverged? There is
considerable evidence that the great species diversity of
bony fishes is the consequence of an additional duplication of the whole fish genome followed by massive gene
loss since the appearance of the ancestral tetrapod (e.g.,
see [54]). Interestingly, in the family Tetraodontidae the
only tenascin to persist as a duplicated gene is tenascin-C.
Searches of the latest zebrafish genome assembly (Zv5,
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute) identify only one
tenascin-C on chromosome 5 (NP_ 570982). It will be

Page 12 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:60

interesting to establish if the persistence of tenascin-C paralogs is specific to the pufferfish lineage.
The tenascin-X gene in pufferfish encodes previously
undescribed, highly charged repeats. We propose the
name "GK repeats" to describe these unique sequences,
since all but one of the 19 repeats in T. rubripes and all of
the repeats in Tetraodon nigroviridis begin with the amino
acids glycine and lysine. Given the concentration of
tenascin-X in the epimysium of birds and mammals, it is
intriguing that these repeats combined with the rest of the
DUF619 domain share some sequence homology with a
prokaryotic collagen-binding protein and the muscle-specific protein UNC-89 in C. elegans. The observation that X.
tropicalis tenascin-X contains a region with sequence similar both to UNC-89 as well as bird and human tenascin-X
leads us to suggest that this region may have a role that is
important to tenascin-X function, and its biological properties should be studied further.
A previous study in the zebrafish [17] reported five FN
type III domains in the cDNA sequence of tenascin-W. The
analysis of the genomic sequence of D. rerio as well as RTPCR of zebrafish cDNA reveals a sixth FN type III domain.
Thus, the D. rerio tenascin-W gene encodes the same
number of FN type III domains as does the orthologous
chicken gene, yet it encodes two more than does Tetraodon
nigroviridis. This diversity again points out the potential
hazards of giving proteins a new name based on the
number of repeated domains – of the four tenascin subfamilies, only the tenascin-Rs have the same number of
FN type III domains encoded in the genes of fish, birds
and mammals. In the case of mammalian tenascin-C and
tenascin-X, distinct processes of conservative or concerted
evolution have been described for their FN type III
domains [42]. In the case of tenascin-W most of the diversity can be traced to different numbers of duplications in
the third FN type III domain. This domain exists as a single copy in T. nigroviridis, two copies in Takifugu rubripes,
three copies in D. rerio and G. gallus, 6 copies in man, and
9 copies in many other mammals including dog [NCBI
Protein:XP_547455], rat [NCBI Protein:XP_222794] and
mouse. What is it about this particular FN type III domain
that may be leading to its duplication? One possibility is
that this domain contains an integrin binding site, and
different numbers of integrin binding sites may change
the affinity of the intact molecule for a receptor, or may
allow for tenascin-W to crosslink numerous receptors.
Note that the LDVP/IDAP/IDSP motif, which has been
shown to recognize alpha4beta1 integrin in fibronectin
and VCAM [55], is found in almost all of the duplicated
third FN type III domains analyzed here (underlined in
Figure 6). Tenascin-W from X. tropicalis is different from
other tenascin-Ws in its number of EGF-like repeats and
the relatively recent duplication of its fourth, and not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/60

third, FN type III domain. Interestingly, this also results in
the duplication of two potentially active integrin binding
motifs: an RGD in the fourth domain and a KGD in the
fifth. It is intriguing to note that species that lack an RGD
motif in the third FN type III domain of tenascin-C (i.e.,
X. tropicalis and mouse) have an RGD motif in their
tenascin-W. Since tenascin-C and tenascin-W are often coexpressed during development [17,18,51] it is interesting
to speculate that they may have overlapping functions
related to their binding to an RGD-dependent integrin.
Most tenascins studied to date are alternatively spliced,
and only rarely are all of the potential FN type III domains
identified in the final protein (e.g., see [56,57]). This variability leads to different functional domains being
exposed in different tissues [1,7,58]. As more ESTs
become available, it will be interesting to analyze the
many potential splice variants of each of these tenascins,
as they may reveal additional functional variability in the
tenascin gene family.

Conclusion
Tenascins are not known in protostomes or Cnidaria. We
provide evidence that a single tenascin is encoded in the
genome of the urochordate C. intestinalis. This invertebrate chordate tenascin contains the motif RGE in an
exposed loop of its third FN type III domain, which may
correspond to an integrin-binding site conserved in some
vertebrate tenascins. Sequence alignments, analysis of
domains and exon/intron organization and phylogenetic
analyses of tenascins from four classes of vertebrates
reveal that in fish and in tetrapods there are four members
of the tenascin gene family: tenascin-C, tenascin-R,
tenascin-X and tenascin-W. We suggest that use of the
names tenascin-Y and tenascin-N be discontinued. In
pufferfish there are two tenascin-C paralogs but single
copies of the other tenascins. The human genome provides clear evidence that tenascin-C, tenascin-R and
tenascin-X arose through the same ancestral genome
duplications. Tenascin-W may have evolved as a result of
a local duplication of the ancestor of tenascin-C and -R.
The tenascin-X genes from the pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis and Takifugu rubripes encode different numbers of
unique, highly charged tandem repeats of unknown function. X. tropicalis tenascin-X shares features with both the
smaller teleost tenascin-Xs and the very large tenascin-Xs
found in mammals. Finally, much of the diversity seen in
the size of tenascin-W can be accounted for by the multiple duplications of the exon encoding the third FN type III
domain in different species.

by key-word search or BLASTP (NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool [59]) (reviewed by [60]) and used to
obtain data for searching, alignment and phylogenetic
reconstructions are listed in Table 1. Genomes were
searched and analyzed at the NCBI [39], UCSC Genome
Bioinformatics [24], Joint Genomic Institute Eukaryotic
Genomics [61], the Laboratory for Developmental Biology and Genome Biology [26], Centre National de
Séquençage Genoscope [62], the Max Planck Institute for
Molecular Genetics [63], the Cnidarian Evolutionary Biology Database [64] and the Nematostella vectensis
Genomics Database [65]. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic trees were constructed simultaneously by using
SATCHMO (Berkeley Phylogenomics [66]) as described
by Edgar and Sjölander [38]. The phylogenetic tree of the
FReDs was constructed with MrBayes: Bayesian Inference
of Phylogeny [67] (see [68]) using the WAG substitution
model [69]. We ran 1 million generations after which the
average standard deviation of split frequencies was
0.004518. The phylogenetic tree was drawn using DrawTree [70]. For identification of parologous tenascinencoding regions in the human genome, the database of
"Paralogons in the human genome", version 5.28, was
searched (Paralogons in the Human Genome [71]) (see
[43]).
Domain and repeat identification
Likely heptad repeats were identified using the Simple
Modular Architecture Research Tool SMART [72], Paircoil
Scoring Form [73] (see also [74]) and COILS [75] programs. Tenascin-type EGF-like repeats were identified by
their characteristic number and spacing of cysteine residues (X4CX3CX5CX4CXCX8C) and confirmed with the
SMART program, which classifies them as generic EGF
repeats. FReDs and FN type III domains were identified by
the NCBI Conserved Domain feature of BLASTP [59] and
by SMART [72]. Partial FN type III domains were also
identified by the NCBI Conserved Domain program.
Often the different programs for predicting open reading
frames in pufferfish and X. tropicalis were not in agreement. For example, the sequence ELDAPSDLSAQDVTESSFTVSRDSTQVHIDGYFLSFSSSAGSN was predicted to lie
between the third and fourth FN type III domains of
Tetraodon nigroviridis tenascin-W at the NCBI protein database [CAG07652], but not in predicted protein at the
Genoscope site (GSTENT00028391001). In such cases the
proteins were aligned with avian and mammalian
tenascin sequences using the SATCHMO program and the
predicted protein with the best fit to known cDNA
sequences was used. Additional short predicted openreading frames were not considered to be part of the protein if the BLASTP and SMART programs predicted them
to be potentially artifactual due to low-complexity.
Intron-exon splice sites were estimated from the results of
the "build protein" feature of BLASTP genomic searches

and from the gene model feature of the Tetraodon genome
browser [62].
Molecular cloning, antibody production and
immunohistochemistry
The sequence of the N-terminus of Ciona intestinalis
tenascin was predicted from genomic sequence 5' of the
EGF-like repeats encoding a potential signal peptide. This
was confirmed by the identification of a cDNA using RTPCR with primers homologous to the region harboring
the methionine N-terminal to the predicted signal peptide
and a primer from the next exon. Animals were obtained
from the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole,
MA). RNA was extracted from larvae collected 18 hours
after fertilization and used as template for reverse transcription. PCR was performed with the primer pair 5'ATGTGGCCTGTTTCGAGTCG-3'/5'-ATTGCTGCTGGTCAGGAACG-3' and the resulting band sequenced. It
encoded amino acids 1–66 shown in Figure 2A. To raise
antibodies we amplified the cDNA encoding the first FN
type III domain from C. intestinalis mRNA by RT-PCR with
the primers 5'-TCTCATGTCATCAAACCATCAG-3'/5'TGTTTTCACAGAAGCAGTAATTGG-3'. The resulting
cDNA encoded amino acids 459–550 from the sequence
shown in Figure 2A. Interestingly, the DNA sequence was
only 86.8% identical to the exons of the genomic
sequence (Ciona intestinalis Genome [77]), but all of
them were silent mutations resulting in a 100% conserved
protein sequence. These differences are possibly due to
the genomic diversity that has been noted by others
between specimens of C. intestinalis from the Pacific and
Atlantic [78]. This protein fragment was expressed in E.
coli and antiserum against the purified protein was raised
in rabbits. The antiserum recognized a large (>250 kDa)
smeared band on immunoblots of homogenates of
recently hatched C. intestinalis larvae (generously provided by W.R. Jeffery, University of Maryland) as well as
smaller bands that were also present on the blot incubated
with the preimmune serum. For immunostaining of
whole mounts, larvae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in sea water and permeabilized in methanol at -20C. Larvae were then rinsed in phosphate buffered saline with
0.01% Tween-20 (PBT), blocked in 0.1% bovine serum
albumin in PBT, and incubated overnight in the antiCiona tenascin serum (1:100) or similarly diluted preimmune serum. Larvae were then rinsed overnight and incubated in goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594 secondary antibody
(1:500) in PBT overnight. After extensive washes the
immunostained larvae were coverslipped and observed
using an Olympus confocal microscope.
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction
The cDNA encoding the fifth FN type III domain of D.
rerio tenascin-W was cloned in the following way: total
RNA from an adult fish was isolated with Trizol reagent

(Invitrogen) and mRNA was isolated with the RNeasy
mRNA purification kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was
generated with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.
RT-PCR (30 cycles 94°C 1 min, 94°C 50 sec, 60°C 1 min,
72°C 2 min) using primers corresponding to the
sequences from neighboring exons (5'-GAGTTCAACAGAAGCGGAAAC-3'/5'-TTGAGTCTGAACATCAGTGGC3') generated an appropriately sizedproduct that was
sequenced. The cloned cDNA corresponded to the FN type
III domain found in the genomic sequence encoded on
asingle exon between the fourth and sixth FN type III
domains of tenascin-W (99% identical, as opposed to
81% identical to the fourth FN type III domain). The
cDNA coded protein that was identical to the protein predicted from the genomic sequence except that athreonine
replaced an isoleucine (the 53rd residue of the domain).
This sequence was confirmed by the use of asecond independent pair of primers (5'-AAGCGGAAACAGATATAGACGC-3'/5'-AATCTCTGCTGTTTCAGCCTC-3').

Authors' contributions
RPT identified and analyzed the tenascins from fish and
Xenopus, performed the whole mount immunohistochemistry, wrote the first draft of the paper and prepared
Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. KD with the help of JF cloned
and sequenced a fragment of the Ciona tenascin, raised the
antiserum against the recombinant Ciona tenascin fragment, developed the phylogenetic tree (Figure 9), carried
out the D. rerio RT-PCR with JF, and contributed significantly to the text. JFH provided assistance with the various
genome and domain identification databases, clarified
the use of terminology and assisted with the content and
organization of the manuscript. JF conducted the D. rerio
RT-PCR and Ciona tenascin cloning with KD. RC-E identified and analyzed the Ciona tenascin sequence, analyzed
tenascin-X synteny and contributed to major revisions to
the manuscript. JCA and RPT conceived the project. JCA
provided advice on web-based bioinformatics resources,
identified Ciona tenascin and the putative amphioxus
tenascin through ESTs, and contributed extensively to the
studies of tenascin synteny and each draft of the text. All
authors read and approved the final manuscript.
