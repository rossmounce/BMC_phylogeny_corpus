Abstract
Background: Tandemly repeated DNA, also called as satellite DNA, is a common feature of
eukaryotic genomes. Satellite repeats can expand and contract dramatically, which may cause
genome size variation among genetically-related species. However, the origin and expansion
mechanism are not clear yet and needed to be elucidated.
Results: FISH analysis revealed that the satellite repeat showing homology with intergenic spacer
(IGS) of rDNA present in the tomato genome. By comparing the sequences representing distinct
stages in the divergence of rDNA repeat with those of canonical rDNA arrays, the molecular
mechanism of the evolution of satellite repeat is described. Comprehensive sequence analysis and
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that a long terminal repeat retrotransposon was interrupted
into each copy of the 18S rDNA and polymerized by recombination rather than transposition via
an RNA intermediate. The repeat was expanded through doubling the number of IGS into the 25S
rRNA gene, and also greatly increasing the copy number of type I subrepeat in the IGS of 25-18S
rDNA by segmental duplication. Homogenization to a single type of subrepeat in the satellite
repeat was achieved as the result of amplifying copy number of the type I subrepeat but eliminating
neighboring sequences including the type II subrepeat and rRNA coding sequence from the array.
FISH analysis revealed that the satellite repeats are commonly present in closely-related Solanum
species, but vary in their distribution and abundance among species.
Conclusion: These results represent that the dynamic satellite repeats were originated from
intergenic spacer of rDNA unit in the tomato genome. This result could serve as an example
towards understanding the initiation and the expansion of the satellite repeats in complex
eukaryotic genome.

Background
The large variety of genome sizes found throughout the
plant kingdom is mainly attributed to species-specific differences in ploidy and repetitive DNA content [1]. Repetitive DNA can be divided into two categories: interspersed
repeats, which are individual repeat units that are distributed around the genome in an apparently random fashion, and tandem repeated DNA, whose repeat units are
placed next to each other in an array. Several previous
studies have uncovered interspersed repeats, the retrotransposons, which are usually the most abundant form
of repetitive DNA in plants with large genomes [2,3]. The
transposition mechanism of these repeats has been well
characterized with respect to interspersed repeats. Multigene families including ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) as well as
noncoding sequences such as satellite DNA, minisatellite
sequences and microsatellite sequences are often arranged
in tandem arrays [4,5]. Tandemly repeated DNA is primarily found at centromeres, subtelomeric regions, and heterochromatin. Recently, a number of new satellite repeats
have been described in higher plants using cytological
techniques [6-8].
Ribosomal DNA is one of the most well-characterized tandem arrays and is made up of genes that are transcribed
into the components of the ribosome [9]. The repeated
unit consists of the 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNA genes, external transcribed spacers, internal transcribed spacers, and
an intergenic spacer (IGS). The coding regions of rDNA
are highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms,
whereas the sequence of the noncoding IGS region varies
broadly between even closely-related species. This observation has been explained by the model of horizontal or
concerted evolution, originally proposed by Brown et al.
[10]. The identity of coding sequences from different species can be explained to have occurred through the maintenance of sequences with strong purifying selection.
However, in plants, such as legumes [11], potato [12], and
tobacco [7,13], highly amplified satellite repeats with
sequence homologous to the IGS subrepeats of rDNA
have been reported to exist in dispersed patterns over several chromosomes. In these genomes, the IGS subrepeathomologous satellite sequences occur in blocks independent of the rRNA gene cluster [12,14,15]. The satellite
sequences described in plants often have erratic distributions and large differences in abundance, between even
closely related species [7,15]. The discovery of satellite
repeats homologous to the IGS of 45S rDNA induced
speculation that satellite repeats might be originated from
45S rDNA. The mechanism of satellite repeat generation
has been explained by several hypotheses. (1) Satellite
repeats could have arisen through repeated and random
unequal crossing over [16], (2) by replication slippage
and unequal crossing over with subsequent expansion
[17], and (3) by the products of rolling circle replication

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/42

of extrachromosomal circular DNAs that became reinserted into the genome [18,19]. The segmental duplication of large arrays of satellite repeats has also been proposed to be the primary mechanism responsible for their
amplification, contributing to the rapid reshuffling of
CentO satellites in rice centromere [20,21]. However, to
date, there is no clear explanation on how the sequence of
the rDNA unit escaped from the highly efficient concerted
evolutionary mechanisms that keep it so well conserved.
To better understand the origins of satellite repeats, it is
necessary to find and compare sequences from genomes
in different stages along the path of satellite repeat generation [22]. Here we report the discovery of a satellite
repeat that is highly homologous to IGS of the 18S–25S
rRNA genes in tomato. The comparison of sequences from
several BAC clones containing rDNA in various stages of
modification has provided a plausible explanation for
how IGS homologous satellite repeats were developed
from the well-conserved rDNA unit.

Results
Cytological localization of 45S rDNA and IGS-homologous
repeats in the tomato genome
As part of the international tomato genome sequencing
project, we employed fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) analysis for confirmation of the position of genetic
marker-anchored BAC clones on chromosome 2 [23,24].
LE-HBa0007F24, a clone anchored at genetic marker
cLER-1-H17, produced very strong signals in the nucleolus organizing region (NOR) of chromosome 2 and on
three other chromosomes (Figure 1A). However, hybridization with wheat 45S rDNA (pTa71, GeneBank accession
number: X07841) produced only one signal focused on
the short arm of tomato chromosome 2, indicating that
this is the only location of rDNA repeats (Figure 1B).
When the nucleotide sequences of tomato and wheat 45S
rDNAs were compared, the 18S rRNA genes were 96%
identical, whereas the IGS sequences had very low identity
[25]. Therefore, we speculated that only the short arm of
chromosome 2 contains the canonical 45S rDNA unit and
that the foci on the other three chromosomes do not contain the coding sequences of 45S rDNA, but some IGS
sequences.

In order to test our hypothesis, we performed FISH analysis with a tomato-specific IGS probe (pIGS) made from
483 bp of tomato sequence amplified from the type I subfamily IGS of 25-18S rDNA (Figure 1C). Like the tomato
45S rDNA probe and unlike the wheat 45S rDNA probe,
the tomato type I IGS probe hybridized to loci on four
chromosomes. FISH analysis on extended DNA fibers prepared from S. lycopersicum confirmed that there are two
types of IGS organization in the tomato genome (Figure
1D). One is co-localized with the coding sequence of
rRNA genes and the other is linearly stretched over a 300

kb region that lacks rRNA genes. Because FISH analysis
had demonstrated that the HBa0007F24 clone is derived
from the same chromosomes that hybridize to the tomato
45S rDNA probe, a probe was made from the partial 18S
rDNA fragment of HBa0007F24 and tested in another
FISH experiment (data not shown). This probe hybridized
only to the NOR on the short arm of tomato chromosome
2. These data indicate that there is a single known canonical 45S rDNA block and three IGS homologous satellite
repeats that are independent of rRNA genes in the S. lycopersicum genome.
Sequence analyses reveal that transition of rDNA is
initiated in the NOR
To determine how the satellite repeats are generated from
the 45S rDNA array, we determined full sequences of two
BAC clones in distinct stage of divergence of rDNA repeat:
HBa0007F24 (131,560 bp, GeneBank accession number:
AC215351) of which end sequence was 89% identical to
tomato 45S rDNA (GeneBank accession numbers:
AY366528, AY366529) and Sle0089P21 (17,800 bp,
GenebBank accession number: AC215459) which contains two copies of canonical rDNA (Figure 2A–B).
Sequence comparison of two BAC sequences revealed

dynamic changes in the HBa0007F24 sequence which
consists of seven diverged truncated rDNA units with similar composition but different lengths of elements. Essentially every unit has 18S, 25S, 5.8S, and IGS. The modified
18S and 25S rDNAs showed 92–94% and 89–91% identity to typical rDNAs, respectively. Annotation of the
sequence revealed that there are three significant modifications of the 45S rDNA in the HBa0007F24 clone (Figure
2). First, the 18S rDNAs were interrupted by LTR-type retrotransposons. Second, the 25S rDNAs were fragmented
by the IGS-like sequences. Third, IGS sequences which
have 3 to 4 times longer than normal rDNA unit were
found between the 25-18S rDNAs.
To further characterize the IGS homologous repeat
sequences in the tomato genome, we selected and
sequenced the BAC clone, Sle0049A24 (28,040 bp),
which has expanded IGS sequences at both ends, according to the results of a BLAST search of the BAC end
sequence database (Figure 2C). The majority (85%,
23,858 bp) of the total 28,040 bp sequence of
Sle0049A24 (GeneBank accession number: AC225927) is
a long IGS stretch, which are 86% identical to subrepeat I.
The remainder of the sequence (1,753 bp) is partial 25S

rDNA and subrepeat II of IGS. The length of the repeated
unit was well-conserved as 52–53 bp-long throughout the
21,607 bp of continuous subrepeat type I sequence.
LTR retrotransposons inserted in the 18S rDNAs were
polymerized by uneven recombination
Sequence comparison of HBa0007F24 and Sle0089P21
showed that the tomato rDNA related retrotransposons
(TRRTs) were inserted at the same location of the seven
18S rDNAs in HBa0007F24 (Figure 3). Following the
accepted system for retrotransposon nomenclature [26], it
was classified as a Ty3-Gypsy like LTR retrotransposon.
TRRT2 through TRRT7 are orientated in the direction of
rDNA transcription, and TRRT1 has the opposite orientation (Figure 3C). To determine the reason for the opposite
orientation of TRRT1, we analyzed the flanking sequences
of each TRRT (Figure 3D). We found that each TRRT has

the same flanking sequences (CTAC), indicating that
TRRTl or others were inverted by recombination after
insertion rather than inserted in the opposite orientation.
Therefore, we assume that this inversion was mediated by
rearrangement among duplicated segments.
Phylogenetic analysis of 13 LTRs belonging to the seven
TRRTs of HBa0007F24 demonstrated that segmental
duplications were a major process for TRRT amplification
(Figure 4C, see Additional file 1). The results from computing the proportion of nucleotide differences between
each pair of LTR sequences showed that no LTR pair of a
single LTR retrotransposon was clustered together implying that the retrotransposons were duplicated rather than
re-inserted via a intermediate RNA. Two LTRs of TRRT1
were the most closely clustered, whereas LTRs of TRRT5
and 6 had the most diverged sequences between any two

Distribution of TRRT in the tomato genome
Distribution of TRRT in the tomato genome. (A) Chromosomal localization of TRRT (red signal). FISH analysis of pachytene stage S. lycopersicum was probed with TRRT. TRRT was localized on the heterochromatin of all chromosome include

(pTA71, green signal). (C) Arrows indicate the direction of seven TRRTs present in the HBa007F24 clone. TRRT in unit IV has

flanking sequences of TRRTs with those of typical 18S rRNA genes. Seven TRRTs are inserted in the same site and create 4 bp

LTRs of a single LTR-retrotransposon. However, the same
positions in TRRT5 and TRRT6 (RT5-5':RT6-5', RT53':RT6-3') were closely related, indicating they were the
most recently duplicated by recombination. Phylogenetic
analysis of 18S and 25S rDNAs of HBa0007F24 with typical rRNA genes shows similar results obtained in the
analysis of the LTRs (Figure 4A, B).
The retrotransposon encodes four proteins, retrotrans gag,
reverstranscriptase, integrase core domain, chromatin
organizing modifier, and has long terminal repeats (LTR)
at both ends (Figure 3E). However, TRRT4 contains solo
LTR, but does not encode the gag-pol gene, indicating that
some of the sequence was lost through unequal recombination [2]. The retrotransposon insertions vary in length,

from 5,645 to 6,028 bp, and share 93.61% sequence identity with each other. The 18S rDNAs associated with the
TRRTs have a similar degree of sequence identity to the
canonical 18S rRNA gene (92–94% identity).
Because all of the retrotransposons were found at the
same position, 781 bp of the 18S rDNA, with the same
flanking sequences, we examined whether the TRRT transposed site-specific manner. Using the retrotransposon
sequence as a query to search GeneBank (BLASTN), we
identified two tomato BAC clones, C02HBa0155E05 and
C06HBa0169D11, which have the same retrotransposon,
but are not associated with rDNA. The flanking sequences
of these retrotransposons were different from those of
HBa0007F24. FISH analysis also demonstrated that the

joins, 25S joins). Comparison of phylogenetic distance of 13 LTR pairs of 7 retrotransposons shows that LTR pair of each retrotransposon is not clustered together implying that the retrotransposons was duplicated rather than transposition for LTR
retrotransposon amplification. Opposite position LTRs (RT5 LTR 3': RT5 LTR 5' or RT6 LTR 3': RT6 LTR 5') of TRRT5 or
TRRT6 have the most divergent sequence, but the same position LTR (RT5 LTR 3': RT6 LTR 3' or RT6 LTR 5': RT5 LTR 5') of
TRRT5 and TRRT6 are closely clustered.

retrotransposon sequence is present on other chromosomes as various sizes of blocks supporting that the retrotransposon was not integrated in a site-specific manner
(Figure 3A).
Duplication of the IGS between 25-18S rDNA sequences
into the middle of 25S rRNA
Sequence comparison of HBa0007F24 and Sle0089P21
showed that IGS-like sequences are inserted at the same
position of 25S rDNA, between 1,388 bp and 1,641 bp of
the canonical sequence, and each interrupted copy has
lost 254 bp of 25S rDNA sequence where the IGS was
inserted (Figure 5A and 8). Of seven 25S rDNAs, six had
IGS-like sequences in the middle of the coding region
doubling the number of IGS in the 45S rDNA unit. The

remaining 25S rDNA (Figure 5A-II) was missing part of its
5' end.
The size and the number of deletion of each unit of 25S
rDNA demonstrated that the deletions were accumulated
(Fig 5A). For example, all units (II, III, IV, V, and VII) of
25S rDNAs in the BAC clone have a deletion of 81–82 bp
at the same position 2,986–3,066 bp and the deletion frequency varies from 2 to 5. Unit IV has a single 82 bp deletion, while unit III has four such deletions. Following the
number of deletions in each unit, the order of recombination can be deduced as: IV → V → III. These results indicate that 25S rDNAs harboring IGS were mainly
multiplied by unequal recombination from a single variant rather than individual IGSs being recombined in parallel in their respective 25S rDNA sequences.

Duplicated IGS in 25S rDNA
Duplicated IGS in 25S rDNA. (A) Deletion patterns of the 25S rDNA in the HBa007F24 clone. All IGS-insertion occurred
at the same site, 1,388–1,641 bp of 25S rDNA sequence, losing 253 bp. Assuming that deletions were accumulated, the
sequence of deletion events can be estimated to be IV→ V→ III from the deletion pattern. Numbers on shade box represent
position of normal 25S rRNA gene. Position and length of deleted sites are indicated. (B) IGSs duplicated in 25S rDNA were
compared with normal IGS of 25-18S rDNA. Two subrepeats were differently regulated: Type II subrepeats have been easily
lost, but type I subrepeats were not.

The duplicated IGS-like sequences in the 25S rDNA commonly contain conserved sub-family repeat sequences,
namely type I subrepeat, AT rich regions, and type II subrepeat (Figure 5B). The length of IGS-like sequences
inserted into 25S rDNAs varies from 1,476 bp to 2,074 bp
and primarily depends on the length of the type II subrepeat, but not type I subrepeat. These data indicate that
type I and type II subrepeats have been differentially regulated during molecular evolution.
Differential amplification between subfamily repeats in
the rDNA intergenic spacer
Sequence comparison of HBa0007F24 and Sle0089P21
showed that the length of the IGSs of 25-18S rDNAs
(8,400 – 11,408 bp) in HBa0007F24 was 3 to 4 times

longer than the normal IGS sequences (3,395 bp) present
in tomato genome (Figure 6A, B). In addition, as shown
in Figure 6, the type II subrepeat present at the downstream of the transcription initiation site (TIS) has been
replaced by the type I subrepeat. In the amplified IGS, the
type I subrepeat in the upstream of the TIS was 10–17
times longer (4,771–7,921 bp) than conventional type I
subrepeat (448 bp). Furthermore, another type I subrepeat found downstream of the TIS was 2–3 times longer
(1,040–1,478 bp) than the conventional type I subrepeat
(448 bp). Therefore, these results strongly indicated that
duplication of the IGS into the 25S rDNA occurred before
the type II subrepeat replacement by the type I subrepeat,
and also before the type I subrepeat amplification of the
IGS located between the 25S and 18S rDNAs. Even though

the length of the type I subrepeat was expanded, the monomer length was well conserved as 53 bp.
To figure out the molecular mechanisms of the repeat proliferation, we performed phylogenetic analysis of 129
repeat monomers that were identified in expanded IGS in
the unit IV of HBa0007F24 sequence (Figure 6C). By analyzing the most related monomers revealed by the Neighbor-Joining tree obtained (see Additional file 2), we
identified 25 pairs of monomers that are arranged in four
duplicated clusters of monomers. The data obtained demonstrated that segmental duplication was occurred among
the amplified type I subrepeat.

Distribution of IGS-homologous repeats among closelyrelated tomato species
We carried out FISH analysis to study the organization of
the 45S rDNA locus and IGS-homologous repeats on the
Eulycopersicon red fruited subgenera [27], including S.
lycopersicum, S. lycopersicum var.cerasiforme, and S. pimpinellifolium, which are very closely-related species (Figure
7, see Additional file 3). FISH analysis was applied
sequentially using the pTa71 probe for the 45S rDNA
locus and pIGS probe for the IGS type I on the pachytene
chromosome of S. lycopersicum, S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and S. pimpinellifolium. When S. lycopersicum chromosomes were hybridized to pTa71, a single strong signal
was detected on the short arm of chromosome 2; how-

ever, in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and S. pimpinellifolium, four signals were detected in four separated
heterochromatic regions (Figure 7A, C, E). The number of
signals was in accordance with the number of signals
detected with the pIGS probe in S. lycopersicum. The
number of foci detected on the pachytene chromosomes
with the pIGS probe varied, as follows: four signals in S.
lycopersicum, seven signals in S. lycopersicum var.cerasiforme, and six signals in S. pimpinellifolium (Figure 7B, D,
F). All foci were located in regions of the pericentromeric
heterochromatin. Most of the signals corresponding to
the IGS repeat were stronger and more numerous than the
signals from the pTa71 probe. However, the foci detected
on the short arm of chromosome 2 of S. lycopersicum and
S. pimpinellifolium were of a similar intensity, whether
detected as with pIGS or pTa71. Taken together, the numbers of the satellite repeat vary dramatically across closelyrelated species and they can divide into two groups,

repeats with or without rDNA coding sequence (additional file 4).

Discussion
FISH analysis and the sequences of three BAC clones
described in this study provide a good explanation on the
origin and developmental procedures involved in the evolution of IGS-homologous satellite repeats because they
contain both the original form and early stages of the variants in a genome. They also allow us to compare transitional sequences that make it possible to compare with
previously proposed models.
Multiple mechanisms have been postulated to explain the
development of satellite repeats, including unequal crossover, gene conversion, satellite transposition, illegitimate
recombination,
and
segmental
duplication
[2,5,16,21,28,29]. However, the origin and the develop-

ment of the early stages of satellite repeat have remained
unclear because transition sequences have not been identified. Our results showed that rDNA is the origin of the
satellite repeat, and repeated rearrangement and retrotransposon insertion were involved in satellite repeat initiation (Figure 8). The inserted retrotransposon in 18S
rDNA might serve as sites of unequal or ectopic recombination [30]. Unequal crossover seems to be commonly
employed to multiply modified rDNA units such as TRRT
inserted 18S rDNAs and IGS inserted 25S rDNAs. Doubling the number of IGS into the 25S rDNA seems a very
effective way of amplifying a repeated sequence. Duplication of IGS into the 25S rDNA sequence may occur prior
to the amplification of the type I subrepeat of the IGS of
25-18S rDNA. Because duplicated IGS in the 25S rDNA
sequence is similar with normal IGS in appearance feature
while IGSs of 25-18S rDNA were highly amplified and

reorganized. Segmental duplication of the repeat was also
one of the major mechanisms of expanding satellite
repeat [21]. The copy number of type I subrepeat in
expanded IGS of 25-18S rDNA was also expanded by segmental duplication (Figure 6C)
Homogenization of the satellite repeat to single-type
monomers seems to be actively conducted from the initial
stage of the satellite repeat. Gene conversion and unequal
crossover has been proposed as the mechanism for
genome-wide homogenization of the satellite repeats
[5,16,31]. Our results are consistent with the models in
that both gene conversion and unequal crossover play a
pivotal role in regional homogenization of the satellite
repeats on initial step. Analysis of the duplicated IGS
located in the 25S rDNA sequence indicated that the two
subrepeats are differentially regulated in their copy

Model for IGS homologous satellite repeat development
Model for IGS homologous satellite repeat development. Ty3-Gypsy type LTR retrotransposon (TRRT) inserted in
18S rDNA might be integrated in the array at the early stage of divergence. The TRRT inserted 18S rDNA persist and increase
its copy number through recombination. Duplication of IGS into 25S rDNA seems to be occurred prior to replace type II subrepeat to type I subrepeat. Homogenized satellite repeat may be developed through amplifying type I subrepeat with segmental
duplication, but removing neighboring sequences such as 25S rDNA and type II subrepeat.

number. While the type I subrepeat was conserved in copy
number, the number of type II subrepeat sequence was
decreased in different length between variants implying
that repeated unequal crossover has occurred. Neighboring sequences of type I subrepeat such as 25S rDNA and
the retrotransoposon may be deleted as a result of unequal crossover homogenizing the expanding repeat (Figure 2B). However, the replacement of the type II subrepeat
to the type I subrepeat within the expanded IGS of 25-18S
rDNA can be explained by gene conversion. Despite the
amplification of copy number of type I subrepeats, the
size of type I subrepeat monomers was relatively well conserved as 52–53 bp. It appears to be a common phenomenon for the size of satellite monomers to conserve nearly
uniform within a genome [13,32,33], whereas the copy
number of satellite monomers varies dramatically across
species, within an organism, or on a specific chromosome
between different subspecies or varieties [7,21,34].
In addition, we have postulated that satellite repeats sharing the same monomer can become separated from the
original locus. The four signals detected with the pTa71
probe in S. lycopersicum var.cerasiforme and S. pimpinellifolium indicate that there are coding sequences of rRNA at
those four loci. This situation can be explained if an rDNA
block had moved to a new location outside of their original array, followed by coding region deletion and type I
subrepeat amplification. However, it is more likely that
the amplified IGS repeat sequence translocated outside of
the rDNA array with partial coding regions attached, than
that transposed sequences on multiple chromosomes
independently developed satellite repeats. These assumptions are supported by our FISH results in that, with the
exception of foci on the short arm of chromosome 2, very
weak or no signal was detected with a partial 18S rDNA
probe in S. lycopersicum var. cerasiforme and S. pimpinellifolium. Of course, rDNA coding sequence could be effectively eliminated in the satellite repeat of S. lycopersicum.
In S. lycopersicum var.cerasiforme and S. pimpinellifolium,
but not yet in S. lycopersicum, additional IGS-homologous
satellite repeats may have been made from the original
three IGS homologous satellite repeats lacking rRNA coding sequence.
Tandem repeat segments could be moved by recombinational excision of looped-out modified rDNA segments
during meiotic unequal alignment of the rDNA repeating
units and might re-integrate into a new location [17,28].
Indeed, this mechanism of recombinational deletion of
amplified repeats was discovered in the fourth unit of
rDNA in the clone, HBa0007F24. Of course, unequal
recombination or illegitimate recombination could also
lead to the translocation of satellite repeats [16,35].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/42

Although the integration of mobile elements in rDNA loci
has been reported in animal taxa, new insertions are rapidly eliminated from the rDNA locus by unequal crossover between sister-chromatids [35,36] and that new
insertions are subject to random crossovers. Strong selective pressure against inactive rDNA units eliminates these
insertions from the loci [37,38]. The LTR retrotransposon
in plant genome appears to have adapted differently to
survive in the rDNA locus. When the TRRT randomly
inserted into the 18S rRNA gene, unequal recombination
might have occurred to make the array uniform. However,
instead of removing the TRRT from the rDNA, it increased
the number of genes modified with the insert. Evidence of
the effort to remove the TRRT is also present in the
sequence: Solo LTR unaccompanied by the rest of the
transposon genes may be a remnant of a retrotransposon
that has been removed by unequal recombination [3].
Similar constitution of sequence containing a rDNA variant and retrotransposons was found on the heterochromatin of Brassica rapa. [39]. In addition, amplified
satellite repeats with sequence homologous to the IGS
subrepeat of rDNA have been reported in several plants
[12-15], although the preferential amplification or elimination of a repeat is highly variable across species. For
example, the 2D8 satellite repeat found in potatoes consists of ~3 kb monomers of AT-rich and GC-rich subrepeat
clusters, showing high sequence similarity with type I and
AT-rich regions of IGS in rDNA [12]. The A1/A2 satellite
repeat of tobacco has sequence similarity to regions
downstream of the TIS of IGS [7].

Conclusion
We identified IGS-derived satellite repeats in tomato
genome. By analyses of multiple transitional sequences,
we clearly showed the origin and the growing procedure
of the satellite repeat in tomato genome. Our results also
suggested the molecular mechanisms of proliferation and
homogenization of the satellite repeat in tomato genome
by showing multiplication procedure of modified rDNA
units and amplification/deletion of different subrepeats
within the 45S rDNA.

Methods
Plant materials
Tomato plants (S. lycopersicum (LA3911), S. lycopersicum
var. cerasiforme (LA4352), and S. pimpinellifolium
(LA0417)) were grown in a controlled environment room
at 26°C with 16 h light/8 h dark cycles.
DNA probes
All BAC clones used for FISH mapping were identified by
screening a Heinz 608 BAC library, kindly provided by
Drs. S. Tanksley and J. Giovannoni at Cornell University,
Ithaca, NY, USA. BAC probes were labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP or biotin-16-dUTP by nick translation,

according to the manufacture's protocol (Roche, Switzerland). Other DNA probes used for FISH analysis were: an
rDNA probe, pTa71, containing the coding sequences for
the 18S–25S rRNA genes from wheat [25], pIGS, TRRT,
partial 18S rRNA. Probes were amplified from the clone,
HBa0007F24 with the following primer pairs: partial 18S
rRNA primer (F-AATGATCCTTCCGCAG GTTTACCT, RGCTCTGTATACATTAGCATGGGATA), 25S rRNA primer
(F-CGCCCTCCTACTCTTCGGGGCCTGG, R-CAGGTTAGGCGGCATTACCCGCTGA), Retrotransposon primer (FAATGTA TACAGAGCATAGTGTGATGTCC, R-AGTGCTCAAAGAAAGCCTACTGTCACGG), and pIGS primer (FCGACGTACCATTT GTGCTT, R-TTACCTATGGGCAGCACACATGGTC). PCR products were cloned using
pGEM-T easy Vector system (Promega, Madison, WI) and
sequenced.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
The FISH procedure applied to both mitotic and meiotic
chromosomes was the same as previously reported by Koo
et al. [40]. In brief, chromosomal DNA on the slides was
denatured with 70% formamide at 70°C for 2.5 min, followed by dehydration in a 70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%
ethanol series at -20°C for 3 min each. The probe mixture,
containing 50% formamide (v/v), 10% dextran sulfate
(w/v), 5 ng/μl salmon sperm DNA and 500 ng/μl of
labeled probe DNA, was heated at 90°C for 10 min then
kept on ice for 5 min. Twenty microliters of this mixture
was applied to the denatured chromosomal DNA and covered with a glass cover-slip. Slides were then placed in a
humid chamber at 37°C for 18 h. Probes were detected
with avidin-FITC and anti-digoxigenin Cy3 (Roche, Switzerland). Chromosomes were counterstained with 1 μg/μl
DAPI (Sigma). The signals were detected with a Cooled
CCD Camera (CoolSNAP, Photometrics, Pleasanton,
CA). Images were processed with software (Meta Imaging
Series™ 4.6) using Leica epi-fluorescence microscope
equipped with FITC-DAPI two-way or FITC-rhodamineDAPI three-way filter sets (Leica, Japan). The final printed
images were prepared with Adobe Photoshop 7.0.
Fiber-FISH
Leaf nuclei were prepared, as described by Jackson et al.
[41]. A suspension of nuclei was deposited at one end of
a poly-L-lysine coated slide and permitted to air dry for 10
min. STE lysis buffer (8 μl) was pipetted on top of the
nuclei and the slide incubated at room temperature for 4
min. A clean cover-slip was used to slowly drag the contents along the slide. The preparation was air dried, fixed
in ethanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1) for 2 min, and baked at
60°C for 30 min. The DNA fiber preparation was incubated with a probe mixture, covered with a 22 mm × 40
mm cover-slip, and sealed with rubber cement. The slide
was placed in an 80°C oven in direct contact with a heated
surface for 3 min, transferred to a wet chamber, which was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/42

pre-warmed in an 80°C oven for 2 min, and transferred to
37°C overnight. Post-hybridization washing stringency
was the same as for FISH on chromosome spreads. Signal
detection was performed according to Koo et al. [40].
BAC sequencing and sequence assembly
A shotgun sequencing library was constructed in the
pUC118 vector for average insert sizes of 3–5 kb. BigDye
Terminator chemistry v3.1 (ABI, Foster City, CA) was used
for the sequencing reactions. The sequences were analyzed
using an ABI3730XL automatic DNA sequencer (ABI, Foster City, CA). All of the initial sequence data obtained
were analyzed with the Phred/Phrap/Consed processing
[42]. Base-calling and assembling for the individual
sequences were conducted through the Phred/Phrap software. The value of the Phred scores of the sequences was
30 or higher. The completely assembled sequence was
edited using Consed. Sequence editing for consensus contig formation was generated by visual confirmation, using
the Sequencher 4.1.5 program (Gene codes Corp., Ann
Arbor, USA)
Sequence annotation
Putative genes were primarily identified using BLASTN
and
BLASTX
searches
of
GenBank
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi. The consensus
sequence of IGS monomers previously reported by
Schmidt-Puchata et al. [43] was used to search against the
BAC sequences, HBa007F24, SLe089P21, and Sle049A24
by BLAST. Tandem repeats were identified using Tandem
Repeat Finder [44] and edited manually in DNAMAN
(Lynnon Corporation, Quebec, Canada). The monomers
were extracted from IGS unit IV of HBa007F24 and then
aligned using ClustalX [45]. The alignments were edited
manually if necessary. The Neighbor-Joining trees were
built using the Kimura two-parameter method [46].
MEGA 4 was employed to calculate pairwise transition
and transversion mutations [47].
