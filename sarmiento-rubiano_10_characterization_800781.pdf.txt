Abstract
Background: Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) constitutes a powerful tool for identification and
characterization of bacterial strains. In this study we have applied this technique for the characterization of a
number of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the intestinal content of rats fed with a diet supplemented with
sorbitol.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene, recA, pheS, pyrG and tuf sequences identified five bacterial
strains isolated from the intestinal content of rats as belonging to the recently described Lactobacillus taiwanensis
species. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments confirmed that these five strains are distinct but closely related to
Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus gasseri. A whole genome DNA microarray designed for the probiotic
L. johnsonii strain NCC533 was used for CGH analysis of L. johnsonii ATCC 33200T, L. johnsonii BL261, L. gasseri ATCC
33323T and L. taiwanensis BL263. In these experiments, the fluorescence ratio distributions obtained with
L. taiwanensis and L. gasseri showed characteristic inter-species profiles. The percentage of conserved L. johnsonii
NCC533 genes was about 83% in the L. johnsonii strains comparisons and decreased to 51% and 47% for
L. taiwanensis and L. gasseri, respectively. These results confirmed the separate status of L. taiwanensis from L.
johnsonii at the level of species, and also that L. taiwanensis is closer to L. johnsonii than L. gasseri is to L. johnsonii.
Conclusion: Conventional taxonomic analyses and microarray-based CGH analysis have been used for the
identification and characterization of the newly species L. taiwanensis. The microarray-based CGH technology has
been shown as a remarkable tool for the identification and fine discrimination between phylogenetically close
species, and additionally provided insight into the adaptation of the strain L. taiwanensis BL263 to its ecological
niche.

Background
A number of species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus are indigenous to the gastrointestinal tract of
humans and animals [1-3]. Due to their ecological and
commercial interest, substantial efforts have been concentrated in the past years to isolate and identify new
strains of lactobacilli. Many of those strains belong to
the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. The first major

subgroups [4], that later became distinct species [5].
Strains of the group A were classified as the species
L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus
crispatus and Lactobacillus gallinarum, and strains of
the group B became Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii [5]. Some strains of L. acidophilus and
L. johnsonii are commercialized as probiotics and they
have been subjected to extensive studies aimed to infer
the mechanisms governing their beneficial health effects.

immunogenicity of an oral human rotavirus vaccine in
animals [6]. L. acidophilus strain Bar13 interfered with
the adhesion of enteropathogenic bacteria to enterocytes
and inhibited IL-8 production by HT-29 cells, suggesting a potential to protect intestinal cells from acute
inflammatory response [7]. L. johnsonii strain La1
(NCC533) has been shown to suppress gene expression
of proinflammatory cytokines, supposedly involved in
atopic dermatitis [8,9] and acts as an immunomodulator
[10-12]. The genome of L. johnsonii strain NCC533 has
been sequenced [13] and has enabled a number of studies aimed to determine the genes which are expressed
in vivo and those whose expression is specifically necessary for long persistence in the gut [14,15].
The bacterial species concept has been widely discussed [16,17], but no consensus has been reached to
establish a regularly acceptable definition. In the case of
prokaryotic pathogens, species are traditionally identified
on the basis of the disease they caused, regardless of
genetic considerations. However, for the vast majority of
bacteria, phenotypic characteristics are generally not as
precise as identification based on genotypic methods.
The observation that there are a fraction of genes found
in bacterial genomes shared by all members of a species
and a fraction present only in a subset of the population
gave rise to the core genomic hypothesis [18]. It postulates that there is a core of genes responsible for keeping a species identity and auxiliary genes responsible for
gene transfer and adaptation of strains to the environment. The incorporation of molecular data permitted to
state that a bacterial species is “a category that circumscribes a (preferably) genomically coherent group of
individual isolates/strains sharing a high degree of similarity in (many) independent features, comparatively
tested under highly standardised conditions” [19]. Essentially, a species would be a group of strains with certain
level of phenotypic consistency and showing DNA-DNA
re-association rates greater than 70% [19]. However, this
variability cut-off method is not always appropriate due
to the fact that different clearly recognized species have
a large range of genetic variation. Since DNA sequencing is nowadays an accessible technique to most
laboratories, comparative sequence analysis of the 16S
rRNA gene has been extensively used for species identification in novel isolates [20]. The ad hoc committee for
the re-evaluation of the species definition in bacteriology
considered sequencing of housekeeping genes, DNA
profiling and DNA arrays as very valuable methods for
species delineation and phylogenetic positioning [19].
The L. acidophilus group constitutes a paradigm of a
compact cluster showing closely related species that
offers special difficulties for the correct taxonomic allocation of new strains. Several techniques have been
applied to identify members of the L. acidophilus group,

such as 23S-rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization [21], random amplification of polymorphic
DNA [22,23], sequence alignment of the V1 region of
the 16S rRNA encoding gene [24] and automated ribotyping [25]. Recently, more complex genomic techniques
based on multilocus sequence analysis of five housekeeping genes and comparative genome hybridization
(CGH) using microarrays have been successfully applied
to the L. acidophilus complex [26]. They showed that L.
johnsonii, L. gasseri and L. acidophilus constitute three
clearly independent and consistent genomic groups,
although L. gasseri was more closely related to L. johnsonii than to L. acidophilus. The bacterial genomic variability between strains belonging to the same species or
between closely related species comes from mobile
DNA elements and from variable regions. The latest
may be required for environmental adaptation and
could be acquired by lateral gene transfer. The L. johnsonii NCC533 chromosome harbors three regions that
contain two prophages, Lj928 and Lj965, and a 6-kb
potentially autonomous unit [27,28]. These genetic elements represent more than half of the identified strainspecific DNA and have been extensively studied [26-28].
L. johnsonii NCC533 also carries four further integrases
and several IS elements flanking or disrupting diversity
regions [26-28].
A previous work studying the influence of sorbitol
intake on the population of rat intestinal lactobacilli
showed the presence of five species: L. johnsonii, Lactobacillus intestinalis, Lactobacillus murinus, Lactobacillus
reuteri and Lactobacillus sp. BL263 (previously named
as AD102) [29]. Sorbitol ingestion resulted in an increment of L. reuteri and Lactobacillus sp. BL263 cell numbers [29]. Although strain Lactobacillus sp. BL263 could
be assigned to the L. acidophilus group, its species allocation was still uncertain. In the present study, standard
taxonomic methods and microarray-based CGH analysis
have been implemented for the identification and characterization of Lactobacillus sp. BL263 and four additional rat intestinal isolates (BL301, BL302, BL303 and
BL304) displaying identical PCR-DGGE pattern.

DNA was isolated from each clone containing a portion

here. The partial recA genes were sequenced using the
M13 universal and reverse primers.
Phylogenetic analysis

The sequences were either obtained in this work,
retrieved from the GenBank database or from the Ribosomal Database Project II (RDP) [32]. Multiple alignments were obtained using ClustalX [33]. Positions of
doubtful homology and gaps were removed by using
Gblocks [34]. The phylogenetic reconstruction was performed by maximum likelihood as implemented in
PHYML [35] with the GTR, substitution model in combination with estimation of the transtition/transversion
ratio by maximizing the likelihood of the phylogeny, and
estimations from the data set of the proportion of invariants and the shape parameter (alpha) of the gamma distribution to account for substitution rate heterogeneity
among sites. Bootstrap support values were obtained
through the analysis of 500 pseudoreplicates.

DNA-DNA hybridization assays

DNA macro-arrays on nylon membranes (Hybond N,
Amersham Biosciences) were performed by using a dot
blot assay according to Hänninen et al. [37] with some
modifications. Three aliquots (160, 80 and 40 ng) of
denatured chromosomal DNA samples of 26 Lactobacillus strains were spotted on duplicated membranes. Six
digoxigenin-labelled probes were prepared by random
priming using the DIG DNA Labelling kit (Roche) and
genomic DNA isolated from the type strains of L. intestinalis, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. acidophilus or L. taiwanensis. Those probes were hybridized
against six identical macroarrays with 26 Lactobacillus
strains. Hybridization, washing and staining was carried
out as recommended by the manufacturer using the
CDP-Star chemiluminescent substrate (Roche). Chemiluminescence was detected in a Fujifilm LAS 1000 imaging system (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.) and it was
measured using the Image Gauge Version 4.0 programme. The DNA-DNA hybridization experiments
were done in triplicate.
Comparative genomic hybridization on microarrays

Based on the genome sequence of L. johnsonii NCC533
[13], Agilent 60-mer oligo microarrays were designed
with 5 to 6 probes spreading the coding sequence of
each gene (Agilent technologies Inc., USA). Genomic
DNA was prepared and labelled as previously
described [26]. Hybridization reactions were performed
in a volume of 210 μl with 10 μl of labelled DNA, 70
μl of nuclease free water, 25 μl of control target Agilent and 105 μl of Agilent hybridization buffer, following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The
slides were washed 10 min at RT in 6× SSC, 0.005%
Triton x-100 and 10 min on ice in 0.1× SSC, 0.005%

Triton x-100. The slides were immediately dried by
centrifugation and scanned at 10 μm with a Scanarray
4000 (Packard Biochip Technologies, Billerica, MA,
USA). Data were extracted with Imagene 5.6 (Biodiscovery, El Segundo, CA, USA) and treated with homemade scripts in Python language http://www.python.
org. Probes were eliminated from the analysis if their
signal strength was lower than twice the standard
deviation of the local background when hybridized
with L. johnsonii NCC533 genomic DNA. The signal
ratio (Cy3-labeled unknown strain DNA versus Cy5labeled L. johnsonii NCC533 DNA) of each spot was
calculated without background subtraction and normalized based on our previous experience of CGH
[26]. Having 5 to 6 probes per gene, each gene signal
ratio was given by the median of the corresponding
probes values. Considering the low level of strain
variability for the tested molecule (DNA), the large
number of probes per gene and the robustness of the
median, biological replicates of hybridizations focused
only on the most critical analysis: self-NCC533 (validation of the arrays), ATCC33200 T/NCC533 (intra-species comparison), and BL263/NCC533 (inter-species
comparison with the novel Lactobacillus).

Results
16S rRNA encoding gene and multilocus sequence
analyses positioned the novel Lactobacillus isolates within
the Lactobacillus acidophilus group

Sequences of the 16S rRNA gene (approximately 1,440
bp) of the rat isolates Lactobacillus sp. BL263, BL301,
BL302, BL303 and BL304 were determined. Sequences
of BL263, BL301, BL302 and BL303 were identical (data
not shown) and shared a 99.9% sequence identity with
BL304 strain. A preliminary analysis showed that these
sequences were very similar to sequences of L. gasseri
and L. johnsonii. Subsequently, a phylogenetic tree was
obtained by using the tools available in RDP [32]. On
the basis of this reconstruction, sequences of species
close to L. gasseri and L. johnsonii were selected for a
detailed phylogenetic reconstruction by maximum likelihood. During the preparation of this manuscript, the
novel L. taiwanensis species isolated from silage was
described [39]. The phylogenetic reconstruction based
on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that these
strains belong to L. taiwanensis species and that they
are closely related to L. johnsonii and L. gasseri (Fig. 1).
The identity between the 16S rRNA gene of L. taiwanensis and L. johnsonii and L. gasseri strains ranged
from 99.2% to 99.7% and 98.5% to 99.5%, respectively.
This is higher than the generally accepted >97% identity
threshold for the species definition, but this problem is
known for long in the acidophilus group [24].
The analysis of the recA, pheS, pyrG and tuf gene
sequences from strains BL263, BL301, BL302, BL303,
BL304 and L. taiwanensis DSM 21401T also led to phylogenetic trees that clearly separated a cluster encompassing L. taiwanensis and the rat intestinal isolates
from all the L. johnsonii and L. gasseri strains as indicated by the bootstrap values (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). Therefore, we concluded that our isolates belong to L.
taiwanensis. These phylogenetic reconstructions were in
general agreement with that obtained with the 16S
rRNA gene sequences described above. Although highly
conserved, those genes showed a higher degree of variability between related bacteria than the 16S rRNA gene.
Therefore, the multilocus sequence analysis provided
higher discriminating power which is more suited for
phylogenetic and taxonomic reconstruction within the
closely related species that constitute the L. acidophilus
group.
Phenotypic and protein profile analyses did not resolve
species

The carbohydrate fermentation patterns, and the growth
profiles of 26 lactobacilli (including the novel isolates
and members of the L. acidophilus group) at different
temperatures and salt concentrations were used to

Page 5 of 16

construct a dendrogram (Table 3 and Fig. 4). Similarly,
a comparative analysis of whole-cell protein patterns
was performed with bacterial protein extracts of the
novel isolates and other members of the L. acidophilus
group (Fig. 4). Neither the phenotypic dendrogram, nor
the cluster analysis of the SDS-PAGE protein profiles
showed a good agreement with the phylogenetic relationships inferred from genetic markers. These phenotypic and protein profiles analyses agree with previous
taxonomic analyses [40] that showed a lack of correlation between phylogenetic positioning and physiological/
biochemical properties in lactobacilli. Notwithstanding,
L. taiwanensis strains grouped together in a subcluster
of the phenotypic analysis with an internal similarity
above 30% (Fig. 4).
DNA-DNA hybridization experiments confirmed the
separate status of Lactobacillus taiwanensis strains at the
species level

DNA similarity values were determined by DNA-DNA
hybridization with 26 Lactobacillus strains. DNA of
the 26 strains was immobilized in membrane blots and
the genomic DNA of six Lactobacillus type strains and
L. taiwanensis BL263 strain was used as probe
(Table 4). Relative hybridization values obtained from
intra-species hybridization assays with L. intestinalis,
L. acidophilus or L. crispatus strains always rendered
values above 82%, while inter-species DNA re-association values between those species were low (1% to
18%). Results obtained with L. johnsonii, L. gasseri and
L. taiwanensis were less clear-cut. L. johnsonii and
L. gasseri intra-species hybridization values were
greater than 71%, but L. johnsonii BL261 and L. gasseri
BL223 only showed values of 57% and 62% with their
respective type strains. Nevertheless, those values still
fall within relaxed species delineation boundaries (5070% DNA reassociation) [20]. L. taiwanensis showed
intra-specific hybridization values in the range of 73%
to 95%. Inter-species hybridizations between L. johnsonii and L. gasseri strains rendered values up to 46%,
and always higher than with the other species included
in this assay, supporting that they are closely related
but distinct species. L. taiwanensis strains also showed
high reassociation rates with L. johnsonii and L. gasseri,
their inter-species hybridization values ranging from
21-40% and from 10-26%, respectively. Therefore,
these results also demonstrated the separate status of
L. taiwanensis strains at the species level, and
undoubtedly placed them within the L. acidophilus
complex. Inside this group they showed closer DNA
homology to L. johnsonii and L. gasseri than to L. crispatus and L. acidophilus in agreement with the previous phylogenetic analyses.

Complete Genome Hybridization between L. taiwanensis
BL263 and L. johnsonii NCC533 using DNA microarrays

Firstly, the DNA microarray constructed with oligonucleotides representing all the coding regions from L.
johnsonii strain NCC533 was tested in a self-hybridization experiment to validate the design of the microarrays.
This step was necessary since the microarrays previously
used for inter-species CGH in the L. acidophilus group
[26] were amplicon-based and not oligonucleotide-based.
Thus, L. johnsonii NCC533 strain was used as both the
reference and the test strain, and as expected the distribution of the log2 ratios showed a normal distribution
around zero (data not shown). The performance of the
oligonucleotide microarray was further evaluated by
hybridization with DNA from L. johnsonii ATCC 33200
type strain and L. johnsonii BL261. In the DNA-DNA
hybridization assays, this latter strain fell into the relaxed
definition of species. The distribution of the log2 ratios of
the CGH results are shown in Fig. 5A. Approximately
83% of the ORFs present in NCC533 strain produced a
log2 ratio of -3.5 or greater with these two strains, suggesting a majority of very similar DNA sequences. The
rest of ORFs showed log 2 values under -3.5, reflecting
high divergence or absent genes in the test strains. The
two L. johnsonii strains profiles were typical of intra-species comparisons. In contrast, L. taiwanensis and L.

gasseri strains showed a significant deviation from zero
for nearly all the genes, suggesting global sequence divergence between L. johnsonii and both tested strains (Fig.
5A). These strains gave a similar profile, characteristic of
inter-species comparisons. However, L. taiwanensis have
more probes (51%) with ratios of -3.5 or greater than L.
gasseri (47%), showing slightly better gene conservation.
This is in agreement with the results of DNA-DNA
hybridization experiments. These results confirmed the
separate status of L. taiwanensis from L. johnsonii at the
level of species, and they showed that L. taiwanensis is
closer to L. johnsonii than L. gasseri is to L. johnsonii.
CGH results were mapped on the L. johnsonii
NCC533 genome (Fig. 5B). The genetic differences
observed in the intra-species analysis with the L. johnsonii ATCC 33200 type strain closely match with the previous analysis by amplicon-based microarrays [26],
further validating the oligonucleotide-based microarrays
used in this study. While L. taiwanensis BL263 shared
fewer genes with the reference L. johnsonii NCC533
than the other L. johnsonii strains, it showed 78 genes
which are not always present in L. johnsonii strains.
They are mainly organized in 6 gene clusters: the sec
locus, a hypothetical fimbrial protein, the bacteriocin

Figure 3 Phylogenetic tree showing relationships among pyrG (A) and tuf (B) gene sequences of species in the Lactobacillus
acidophilus group, including Lactobacillus taiwanensis, and species representing different lineages within the genus Lactobacillus. The
trees were created using a maximum-likelihood approach and numbers at branch points are bootstrap values (based on 500 samplings
expressed in percentages). Only bootstrap values over 75% are shown. Bar indicates sequence divergence. The trees have been arbitrarily rooted.
In parenthesis are shown the GenBank accession numbers.

operon and glycosyltransferases (Fig. 5B, marked with an
asterisk). Notably, the most similar genes, thus showing
the highest log2 ratios (≥ -0.34) for a complete cluster,
between L. johnsonii and L. taiwanensis form a clear-cut
cluster containing an ABC transporter and hypothetical
proteins, which is flanked by transposases (LJ1292LJ1298). This cluster is absent in all other strains of L.
johnsonii and L. gasseri analyzed to date. Taken
together, these observations strongly argue for an horizontal gene transfer. Considering the marked conservation of this cluster compared to the rest of the
L. taiwanensis genome, the hypothesis of its loss in the
rest of the analysed strains is very unlikely.
In order to compare the genome conservation of
L. taiwanensis BL263, L. gasseri ATCC 33323 T and
L. johnsonii ATCC 33200T versus L. johnsonii NCC533,
their CGH results were combined in Fig. 6. Interestingly,
variable or absent genes in L. taiwanensis and L. gasseri
were not always shared by the two species. These “species-related” variable genes counted for almost one
quarter of the L. johnsonii NCC533 genome. Since they
were in minority related to mobile elements, this observation strongly supports three evolutionary branches.
The number of genes conserved in L. taiwanensis and

absent/divergent in L. gasseri was 257, whereas those
conserved in L. gasseri and absent/divergent in L. taiwanensis were only 186. These results clearly showed that
L. taiwanensis is closer to L. johnsonii than L. gasseri is
to L. johnsonii. The colour code of the Fig. 6 shows that
most of the L. johnsonii ATCC 33200T absent/variable
genes are also absent in the two other tested species.
However, 63 genes absent in the L. johnsonii type strain
are present in L. taiwanensis (Additional file 1). In contrast, a similar analysis performed with the CGH results
of L. johnsonii BL261 instead of L. johnsonii ATCC
33200T retrieves only 34 genes absent in L. johnsonii
BL261 and present in L. taiwanensis (Additional file 1).
This difference may reflect the adaptation to different
ecological niches, since L. johnsonii type strain have
been isolated from human blood, whereas L. johnsonii
strains NCC533 and BL261 and L. taiwanensis strain
BL263 were isolated from intestinal content. Several
genes conserved in L. taiwanensis BL263 and L. johnsonii BL261, but not in L. johnsonii ATCC 33200T, would
help to survival in such highly populated and competitive microbial environment. Among those genes are the
bacteriocin lactacin F gene cluster, which is flanked by
components of the L. johnsonii NCC533 mobilome, and

Discussion
A previous study designed to analyze the prebiotic effect
of sorbitol in a rat model, resulted in the isolation of

five Lactobacillus strains from the intestinal content that
could not be assigned conclusively to known species
[29]. Here, we have shown that the five isolates share
almost identical 16S rRNA gene sequences, they form a
tight cluster in the recA, pheS, pyrG and tuf phylogenetic reconstructions and DNA-DNA hybridization
experiments revealed close relatedness between them at

the genomic level (> 72%). They were therefore regarded
to belong to the same species. During the preparation of
this manuscript a new L. taiwanensis species isolated
from silage was described [39]. 16S rRNA encoding
gene and multilocus sequence analyses showed that our
strains isolated from rat intestine belong to L. taiwanensis species. This species is placed within the L. acidophilus group, but they constituted a different cluster from
their closest relatives, L. johnsonii and L. gasseri. The

five L. taiwanensis strains have been isolated from the
same environment and showed very high homology in
the phylogenetic analyses; however, the carbohydrate
utilization and growth profiles clearly distinguish L. taiwanensis BL301 from the groups made by L. taiwanensis
strains BL304 and BL302 and by L. taiwanensis strains
BL303 and BL263 (Table 3 and Fig. 1A). These two couples of strains can be distinguished by their protein profiles (Fig. 1B) and by DNA-DNA hybridization

taiwanensis BL263 (y axis) versus L. gasseri ATCC 33323T (x axis). The
axis values represent the hybridization signal ratios expressed in a
log2 scale. For each gene, data points were colour-coded according
to the hybridization profile of a third strain, L johnsonii ATCC 33200T.
Gene conservation colour was obtained from the signal ratio for
each gene in log2 scale. It ranged from black (presence in ATCC
32200T of a homologous gene with respect to the reference strain
NCC533) to white (absence of a gene). For instance, a white circle
in the top left corner of the plot represents a gene present in
BL263 and absent in both ATCC 33323T and ATCC 32200T.

experiments (Table 4). Taken together, these results
indicate that the five L. taiwanensis isolates constitute
distinct strains.
The microarray-based CGH has been used to characterize bacterial intra-species genetic diversity at the
whole-genome level [41-46]. It has also been used for
genome comparisons between species of the same genus
or closely related genus that differ in environmental origin or virulence potential [47-49]. CGH analyses by
microarrays have also been used to discriminate between
the species of the L. acidophilus complex [26]. Here,
microarray-based CGH technology has been applied to
characterize a novel species by determining the gene by
gene boundaries with its nearest phylogenetic neighbour.
The rapid accumulation in the last years of complete
genome bacterial sequences (at present there are 721
complete or in progress deposited genomes in the phylum Firmicutes, 57 of them of the genus Lactobacillus, at
the National Center for Biotechnology Information), and
the general trend towards an increase in genome sequencing projects will offer the opportunity of applying the
DNA microarray-based CGH as an alternative to the
classical whole genome DNA macroarray hybridizations
for bacterial species determination. At a more affordable

Page 13 of 16

price than full genome sequencing, the CGH analysis
renders many more information parameters than whole
DNA re-association. Although the CGH microarrays presented the limitation of be unable to detect novel genes,
it offers the re-association ratio for each ORF, the plot of
the signal to ratio frequency, and the mapping of the
conserved genes on the reference genome, thus providing
a different ground for intra and inter-species comparisons. This work has shown that the inter-species profile
comparison of the novel species L. taiwanensis clearly
demonstrated its separate status respect to L. johnsonii.
The values obtained when comparing the relatedness
of L. taiwanensis BL263 and L. johnsonii NCC533 using
DNA-DNA hybridization with macro or microarrays
may look dissimilar: whole DNA re-association values
were 25% for the macroarray method, but in microarray
CGH analysis 51% of the L. johnsonii NCC533 genes
were conserved in L. taiwanensis. In this latter experiment, the hybridization ratios distribution of the conserved genes in L. taiwanensis is centred on -1 (Fig.
5A), which corresponds to a 50% reduced signal intensity. Therefore, 51% of conserved genes showing about
50% of signal intensity approximates 25% of global
intensity, as observed by DNA-DNA hybridization.
A number of features on L. johnsonii NCC533 genome
[13] that are conserved on L. taiwanensis BL263 may
contribute to the adaptation of this bacterium to its ecological niche. Interestingly, our combined CGH results
with two L. johnsonii strains showed that L. taiwanensis
BL263 is closer to the gut isolate L. johnsonii BL261
than to the blood isolate L. johnsonii ATCC 33200 T .
The L. johnsonii NCC533 genome encodes 16 putative
phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase systems
(PTSs) and several of them, including the ones annotated for fructose, glucose and cellobiose transport, are
specifically induced in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
[14]. CGH results showed that four PTSs, hypothetically
involved in transport and metabolism of fructose, cellobiose, trehalose and sucrose are conserved in L. taiwanensis BL263. These predictions are supported by the
API 50CH results showed for L. taiwanensis BL263
(Table 3). A putative maltose/maltodextrin utilization
gene cluster, which includes a gene coding for a putative
neopullulanase/maltogenic a-amylase, is conserved in L.
taiwanensis BL263, suggesting that this strain may use
starch-degraded products. Other enzymes that may contribute to the survival/persistence of L. taiwanensis
BL263 in the GIT are bile salt hydrolases (BSH). These
enzymes have been almost exclusively found in bacterial
species associated with the GIT and its role has been
largely discussed [see review [50]. L. taiwanensis BL263
exhibited taurocholic and taurodeoxycholic acid deconjugation activity (L. A. Sarmiento-Rubiano and M. J.
Yebra, unpublished results). This is in agreement with

Sarmiento-Rubiano et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:504

the CGH analysis showing that a putative operon encoding a BSH and two bile salt transporters (LJ0056 to
LJ0058) on L. johnsonii NCC533 genome is conserved in
L. taiwanensis BL263, although this strain has only one
of the two transporter encoding genes. Homologues of
these genes in L. johnsonii 100-100 were shown to be
gene duplicates and to have a function in taurocholic
acid uptake [51,52]. The ability of L. johnsonii NCC533
to interact with mucins and epithelial cells has been
shown to likely rely on cell-surface associated elongation
factor Tu and heat shock protein GroEL [53,54]. As
expected for these classes of proteins, their encoding
genes (LJ1009 and LJ0461) are also conserved on L. taiwanensis BL263, offering a putative role of the encoded
proteins in the interaction of this strain with the host.
This interaction may also be influenced by the presence
of another conserved gene encoding a putative adhesin
(LJ0391) that showed similarities with Fap1 fimbrial protein from Streptococcus parasanguinis [55].
Previous studies using DNA microarray-based CGH
and in silico comparative genomic analysis showed a
wide sequence similarity and an accurate genome synteny between L. johnsonii and L. gasseri species [13,26].
In spite of this tight relationship, the novel Lactobacillus
species described here is placed in a third branching of
similar closeness, which raised once more the question
about the limits of species delineation. Additionally, the
CGH analysis showed that the new species is genetically
slightly closer to L. johnsonii than L. gasseri is. This
result is also supported by our DNA-DNA hybridization
data and our phylogenetic analysis of recA, pheS, pyrG
and tuf sequences in these three species.

Conclusion
Since the genome is the final target of all the molecular
taxonomic indicators of species determination, the DNA
microarray-based CGH analysis is the most powerful
technology for strain typing and species assignment, just
behind the costly genome sequencing. In this work we
have characterized with conventional taxonomic analyses a novel Lactobacillus species within the L. acidophilus group, and with microarray-based CGH analysis
we confirmed the status of L. taiwanensis BL263 as species showing gene by gene differences and similarities
with its closest relative L. johnsonii strain NCC533.
