Eukaryote DIRS1-like retrotransposons: an
overview
Mathieu Piednoël*, Isabelle R Gonçalves, Dominique Higuet and Eric Bonnivard

Abstract
Background: DIRS1-like elements compose one superfamily of tyrosine recombinase-encoding retrotransposons.
They have been previously reported in only a few diverse eukaryote species, describing a patchy distribution, and
little is known about their origin and dynamics. Recently, we have shown that these retrotransposons are common
among decapods, which calls into question the distribution of DIRS1-like retrotransposons among eukaryotes.
Results: To determine the distribution of DIRS1-like retrotransposons, we developed a new computational tool,
ReDoSt, which allows us to identify well-conserved DIRS1-like elements. By screening 274 completely sequenced
genomes, we identified more than 4000 DIRS1-like copies distributed among 30 diverse species which can be
clustered into roughly 300 families. While the diversity in most species appears restricted to a low copy number, a
few bursts of transposition are strongly suggested in certain species, such as Danio rerio and Saccoglossus
kowalevskii.
Conclusion: In this study, we report 14 new species and 8 new higher taxa that were not previously known to
harbor DIRS1-like retrotransposons. Now reported in 61 species, these elements appear widely distributed among
eukaryotes, even if they remain undetected in streptophytes and mammals. Especially in unikonts, a broad range of
taxa from Cnidaria to Sauropsida harbors such elements. Both the distribution and the similarities between the
DIRS1-like element phylogeny and conventional phylogenies of the host species suggest that DIRS1-like
retrotransposons emerged early during the radiation of eukaryotes.

Background
The tyrosine recombinase (YR)-encoding elements constitute one of the major groups of retrotransposons
[1,2]. These elements encode a YR that is required for
the mechanism of integration into the genome [3], distinguishing them from other retrotransposons (i.e., LTR
retrotransposons, LINEs, SINEs and Penelope) [4].
DIRS1-like retrotransposons belong to the YR-encoding
element superfamilies [5], whose constituents exhibit a
unique structure made up of three ORFs and uncommon repeats (Figure 1). The first ORF encodes a putative GAG protein, the second the YR, and the third a
pol region composed of three distinct domains: a reverse
transcriptase (RT), a RNase H (RH), and a methyltransferase (MT). The function of this latter still remains
unknown. Depending on the element considered, there

may be considerable overlap between the pol and the
YR regions (Figure 1). The catalytic tyrosine recombinase domain is encoded by the non-overlapping 3’-end
of the YR ORF. Many phylogenetic relationship analyses
have shown that the RT/RH domains of DIRS1-like retrotransposons are closely related to those of Ty3/Gypsy
LTR retrotransposons, suggesting that all these elements
diverged from an ancient GAG-pol form of retrotransposon [5-7]. DIRS1-like elements are bounded by
Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) and harbor two Internal Complementary Regions (ICRs). The two ICRs
located at the 3’-end of the element appear to overlap
on a 3-bp motif called the circular junction. As the left
ICR is inverse-complementary to the beginning of the
left ITR so is the right ICR to the end of the right ITR,
but the latter also appears complementary to an extension of the right ITR that is called the right Extension
(rE) [1]. Given these unusual features, an integration
model has been proposed [3,5] in which the ITRs’ extremities match with their respective ICR. The junction of

(ICRs) correspond to the inner triangles. The rE at the 3’-end of the element is represented by the red box. The positions of the three alignment

the two ITRs results in the formation of a rolling-circle
intermediate of the element. The element integration
then occurs by recombination between the 3-bp ITR
junction sequence (complementary to the circular junction) and an identical sequence in the genome, which
does not produce any target site duplications. Their
unique structure distinguishes DIRS1-like retrotransposons from other YR-encoding elements, also known as
the DIRS order [2] that includes also the Ngaro, Viper
and PAT elements. The Ngaro and Viper retrotransposons are devoid of the MT domain and do not usually
harbor ORF overlaps [6,8]. Elements from the PAT
superfamily, the sister group of DIRS1-like retrotransposons, differ most prominently in their repeats. The PAT
retrotransposons (PAT-like elements, TOC elements
and kangaroo) are bounded by some “Split” Direct
Repeats (SDRs) and can contain tyrosine recombinaseencoding regions in an inverted orientation [5].
Transposable elements have been found in all eukaryotic species investigated thus far [2]. However, depending on the superfamily or family of elements studied,
they show different distributions among eukaryotes. For
example, the Ty1/Copia, Ty3/Gypsy, LINEs, SINEs retrotransposons and the Tc1/Mariner transposons, have
been detected almost ubiquitously [2,7,9-11]. The Penelope retrotransposons are also abundant in many animal
species, but seem to be rare among plants, protists and
fungi [12]. In contrast to this, the Maverick transposons
(also called Polintons) have been characterized by a
highly patchy distribution in diverse eukaryote species,
but not in plants [13,14]. Until recently, bibliographic
data and automatic annotations have revealed the presence of DIRS1-like retrotransposons only in 43 diverse

eukaryote organisms (Table 1), mostly with a low diversity per species (up to four families in Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus and three families in Danio rerio [1,5]) with
the notable exception of Xenopus tropicalis (73 families
deposited in Repbase [15]). They were not described in
several well-studied groups (e.g., plants and mammals),
and are absent from model organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. The
DIRS1-like retrotransposons appear widely distributed
among decapod crustaceans [16]. These elements were
previously detected using PCR approaches in 16 decapod species, including some shrimps, lobsters, crabs and
galatheid crabs. The wide distribution among decapods
and the continuous identification of elements in new
species with the emergence of large-scale genome
sequencing call into question their supposedly patchy
distribution among eukaryote species.
We aim to determine the distribution of DIRS1-like
retrotransposons among eukaryotes using an in silico
approach. In the post-genome era, several automatic
annotation tools have been developed to detect the presence of particular types of transposable elements in
genomes. The conventional approaches are based on
similarity searching using the RepeatMasker program
[17]. However, transposable elements often correspond
to ancient genome components. Many copies even
within the same family appear fragmented and divergent
in nucleotide sequences due to several punctual mutations, rearrangements, and insertions or deletions
(indels). Similarity searching-based programs are efficient in identifying copies closely related to those previously reported in the library, but they often appear
inefficient in detecting very divergent copies or

developed to exhaustively report the content of repeated
sequences within genomes. To identify a specific type of
element, many investigations of this report must be performed, such as similarity searching. For the same reasons as those given for similarity searching-based
methods, such approaches could appear inappropriate
for studying the distribution of the DIRS1-like
retrotransposons.
We hereby present a new computational approach
specifically dedicated to the identification of DIRS1-like
retrotransposons among genomes that we called
ReDoSt. Our method is based on both the detection of
the structure of these elements and on sequence similarity searches performed using alignment profiles designed
on coding domains. It has the advantages of not considering the element copy number and of avoiding any preconception of the ITRs (length or sequence identity).
With our method we analyzed 274 completely
sequenced genomes, which allowed for a high coverage
of eukaryotic diversity, especially plants and unikonts.
We have identified more than 4000 element copies
that can be clustered into approximately 300 new
families. We report the first DIRS1-like element copy
number estimate among many genomes and we evaluate
the diversity within the DIRS1-like superfamily. Their
distribution appears wider than it was previously
thought, especially in unikont species. Sequence analyses
confirmed the presence of well-conserved DIRS1-like
retrotransposons in 28 species, including at least 14 species that were not previously known to host such elements, and allowed us to define a more precise
structure of the DIRS1-like retrotransposons, especially
in their terminal repeats.

unknown elements [18]. Other in silico approaches have
been developed to detect particular types of elements.
These programs, such as LTRharvest [19], are not based
upon similarity searching but on specific signature
searches (e.g., the nature of the termini and the presence
of target site duplications). While some programs have
been developed to detect LTR retrotransposons or
transposons, none have been developed for DIRS1-like
retrotransposons. Such a program might appear inefficient in identifying divergent DIRS1-like retrotransposons because the training dataset that is currently
available for these elements remains too limited (only 18
reference elements with detectable ITRs for example).
Some de novo approaches that detect more divergent
transposable elements, such as RECON [20], have been

Results and Discussion
Identification of putative DIRS1-like retrotransposons in
eukaryote genomes

To study the distribution of DIRS1-like retrotransposons
among genomes, we developed a new computational
tool that we call ReDoSt (Retrotransposon Domain and
Structure). The element detection is mainly based on
independent similarity searches against co-oriented and
well-ordered RT-, MT- and YR-encoding domains
within a single 10-kb genomic fragment (see Methods).
So, the DIRS1-like copies detected with ReDoSt may be
considered as well-conserved (i.e. with the simultaneous
recognizable presence of these three characteristic
domains), which suggests that they may still be active,
or have moved only recently. Thus, relics and highly
degenerate elements are not considered here.
Using ReDoSt, we identified 4310 copies of putative
DIRS1-like elements distributed among 32 diverse species out of the 274 well-sequenced genomes tested
(Table 2). A wide spectrum of eukaryote species is

informative, the minimum (Min) and the maximum (Max) numbers of sequences included in a family are provided. Species in which the presence of DIRS1-like
elements was previously reported (cf. Table 1) are indicated with an asterisk. In the family number column, numbers in brackets indicate the number of families
that we characterized as PAT-like elements. The two Nematoda species that comprise only PAT-like elements are indicated with a dollar. The clustering was
performed on all sequences detected in the 32 species. The families shared by several species are represented several times in the table.

represented in which some taxa are characterized for the
first time as harboring DIRS1-like retrotransposons. For
example, we observed the first DIRS1-like elements in
Mollusca (Aplysia californica and Lottia gigantea). Interestingly, DIRS1-like retrotransposons can be detected in
all the species in two higher taxa, Actinopterygii and
Mucoromycotina. ReDoSt was able to detect DIRS1-like

elements in all species already described in the literature
except those harbor in the honey bee Apis melifera genome. This discrepancy is due to the fact that this genome contains only remnant fragments of DIRS1-like
elements that ReDoSt is unable to detect [21].
As expected, the identified elements seem to be wellconserved. The length of the three detected domains

Piednoël et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:621
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/621

appears highly constrained within the elements of a
given genome. For example, in the Sauropsida Anolis
carolinensis genome, almost all RT-, MT- and YRencoding fragments have a length ranging from 360 to
380 bp, 300 to 320 bp, and 900 to 940 bp, respectively
(Additional File 1). This pattern is present in most genomes, with the notable exception of Saccoglossus kowalevskii, which varies considerably in its domain length
(Additional File 1), possibly because of multiple large
fragment deletions.
Considering the repartition of the 4310 copies
detected in 32 eukaryotes, the copy number per genome
appears highly variable (Table 2), even within some of
the higher taxa examined. In Actinopterygii, the low
copy numbers detected in Oryzias latipes, Takifugu
rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Gasterosteus aculeatus (6, 7, 8, and 21 copies, respectively) contrast with the
2091 copies identified in D. rerio. Conversely, in Mucoromycotina, Mucor circinelloides has ten times fewer
copies than other related species. The copy number per
genome is usually relatively low, illustrated by the fact
that half of the species harbor fewer than 8 copies.
Twelve species show between 10 and 60 copies and only
5 species harbor more than 100 copies (D. pulex, S.
kowalevskii, X. tropicalis, A. carolinensis and D. rerio).
This suggests that the more or less recent element activity is relatively low, resulting either from the inactivation
of most genomic copies or from a strong regulation of
the copy number. The loss of elements in some higher
taxa or species could be facilitated by this low copy
number. However, the relatively low copy number
observed in genomes has to be conservative since only
well-conserved copies are considered based on the three
coding domains studied. For example, similarity searches
on Acantheamoeba sp. allowed us to reveal 29 more
degenerate sequences related to the unique element
detected using ReDoSt (data not shown).
To our knowledge, the copy number has only been
previously estimated in two genomes: the slime mold
Dictyostelium discoideum and the crustacean Daphnia
pulex. In D. discoideum, the previous copy number
estimation of DIRS1-like retrotransposons suggested
40 full-size elements and around 200 incomplete
copies [22]. Our detection tool results in the identification of 16 well-conserved copies. This result seems
consistent with the previous estimation considering the
difference in the methods used. The previous analysis
estimated the copy number with quantitative Southern-blot experiments using the complete DIRS1-like
sequence as a probe. For this reason it may detect
more altered elements than our tool does. This is especially the case with the nested elements [23] that
amplify the signal in Southern blots but are by default
considered to be a unique copy by in silico ReDoSt

analysis (see Methods). In D. pulex, the DIRS1-like
copy number has been previously estimated at 218
[24], including only 19 intact copies (i.e., uncorrupted
sequences and conserved ITRs) [25]. This estimation
also seems consistent with our results (100 copies
detected), as ReDoSt identifies well-conserved elements
but is not limited to intact copies.
The diversity of DIRS1-like retrotransposons

To study the diversity of the DIRS1-like elements, we
use the MCL program to cluster into families all the
sequences that were detected with ReDoSt as well as
reference elements. The parameter values used to cluster in the MCL program were empirically estimated to
discriminate each of the DIRS1-like families previously
described (e.g., DrDIRS1, DrDIRS2 and DrDIRS3 in D.
rerio). Based on the sequence identity, the clusters
obtained on the reverse transcriptase-encoding
sequences using the MCL program are considered to
correspond to different DIRS1-like families. For example, the sequence identities among the largest cluster in
A. carolinensis (319 sequences) range from 57% to
100%, with an average sequence identity of 81%. Such a
relatively high nucleotide sequence divergence is similar
to those observed in reverse transcriptases encoded by
non-LTR retrotransposons and in some DNA transposases. The cluster number obtained in each genome
reflects the diversity of DIRS1-like elements.
A total of 287 families were found distributed
unevenly among the genomes of the 32 species examined (Table 2). Most of the families seem restricted to
only one species with the notable exception of Mucoromycotina species for which several interspecific families
are obtained. Some species show very low element
diversity in comparison to their copy number. For
example, all 16 copies detected in D. discoideum
grouped into a single family. On the other hand, few
species show very high element diversity. For example,
S. purpuratus harbors 4 copies distributed among 4
families. Likewise, the 14 copies of B. floridae are split
into 11 families. The distribution of copy number per
family shows two major profiles according to species
(Figure 2 and Additional File 2). Comparing the two
vertebrate species X. tropicalis and A. carolinensis, both
of which harbor high copy and family numbers, the
Western clawed frog contains families almost equal in
size whereas the lizard contains two families that
together include 64% of the copies. The two fungi Rhizopus oryzae and Allomyces macrogynus have only about
20 copies, which are well distributed in R. oryzae while
half of the copies of A. macrogynus belong to one
family. Finally, in D. rerio, which harbors the highest
copy number, 96% of the 2091 copies belong to just
three families (1157 and 767 copies for DrDIRS1 and

DrDIRS2, respectively). Such a distribution with a high
copy number restricted to few families could be related
to bursts of transposition. Bursts of DIRS1-like element
activity are also suspected in S. kowalevskii (the

SkoDIRS1 family alone accounts for 175 of the 240
copies identified) and in A. carolinensis (AcDIRS1 and
AcDIRS2 families together harbor more than 60% of the
different copies).

Phylogenetic analysis of DIRS1-like retrotransposons

To infer the relationships among the various members
of DIRS1-like superfamily, we constructed a phylogenetic tree (Figure 3) based on an alignment of amino
acid pol region sequences (214 sites). This phylogenetic
tree contains 114 sequences, including a representative
sequence of each family that has at least one uncorrupted copy, 23 DIRS1-like or PAT-like reference elements and 4 Ty3/Gypsy elements used as outgroups.
Preliminary analysis of the three genomes that present
high family numbers (42 families in A. carolinensis, 39
in D. pulex, and 81 in X. tropicalis) has shown that all
of the elements from a given species cluster together
into a monophyletic group (data not shown). For these
species, only representative elements from the 4 or 5
largest families were included in the phylogenetic analysis. In contrast to previous analyses on much smaller
datasets, the monophyly of DIRS1-like elements is not
supported in the present study (bootstrap support lower
than 75%). Such a pattern could be an artifact of a dataset that is too large and includes divergent elements.
Alternatively, it might suggest that the PAT elements
belong to the DIRS1-like superfamily, representing a
peculiar group because of their structure. Many wellsupported groups can be identified within the DIRS1like elements. In many cases, the elements from a given
species form a monophyletic group (e.g., elements from
Nasonia vitripennis, D. pulex or A. carolinensis). However, some species harbor elements from two or three
different groups (e.g., two and three element groups in
A. californica and L. gigantea, respectively). In the same
way, each group usually integrates elements from the
same species or from a few closely related ones. For
example, all the elements identified in fishes belong to
one group called DrDIRS1 [21]. Likewise, the fungi
group 1 comprises most of the elements identified in
fungi, a result that confirms the close relationships
between most fungi DIRS1-like elements revealed by the
MCL analysis. Despite the difficulty in resolving the
relationships among the different DIRS1-like groups, the
monophyletic groups comprising only elements from a
species or related species, the tree topology appears
absent of clear evidence of horizontal transfer.
Discriminating the PAT-like sequences included in the
final dataset

The PAT-like retrotransposons are the sister group of
DIRS1-like elements and show a similar structure with
the exception of their termini [6]. To discriminate the
putative PAT-like elements retained by ReDoSt, 5 PATlike reference sequences were included during the clustering process and the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3).
This allowed us to determine that 11 families correspond to PAT-like retrotransposons (Table 2). This

includes 6 families from the chlorophytes (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri), 3 families from the
nematodes (Caenorhabditis briggsae and Pristionchus
pacificus), one family from L. gigantea, and one shared
by Nematostella vectensis and S. kowalevskii.
The presence of DIRS1-like retrotransposons is confirmed in 25 species, but still remains uncertain in
Emiliana huxleyi, Petromyzon marinus, Naegleria gruberi, P. pacificus, V. carteri and C. reinhardtii. Elements
from these species do not cluster with any reference elements and their sequences harbor too many frameshifts
or indels to be included in our phylogenetic analysis.
For these elements, we checked the presence of DIRS1like elements using similarity searches using the
TBLASTX program [26] and the Repbase database that
we previously re-annotated for the DIRS1-like and PAT
elements (data not shown). A family was assigned to the
DIRS1-like element superfamily under the two conditions: (i) an E-value lower than 1e-20 with at least one
DIRS1-like reference element; and (ii) a minimum difference between the best E-values obtained with DIRS1like and PAT reference elements of 1e-10. Under these
criteria, the presence of DIRS1-like retrotransposons
could be confirmed in V. carteri, P. marinus and N. gruberi, but remains uncertain in C. reinhardtii and E. huxleyi, whereas the element detected in P. pacificus
appears to be a PAT-like retrotransposon. So, 30 of the
32 species revealed by ReDoSt are now considered as
harboring DIRS1-like retrotransposons and the two
remaining posses in fact only PAT elements.
Distribution of DIRS1-like elements among eukaryotes

DIRS1-like retrotransposons are now described in 61
diverse eukaryote species (Figure 4), including 14 species
in 8 higher taxa newly characterized using ReDoSt:
annelids, blastocladiomycetes, cephalochordates, chlorophytes, heteroloboseans, molluscs, petromyzontids and
sauropsids. The DIRS1-like element distribution does
not seem to be as patchy as it was previously described.
Sixteen of the 28 unikont groups tested revealed the
presence of these elements, indicating a wide distribution. This distribution could be shown to be wider in
the near future since seven of the unikont groups apparently devoid of DIRS1-like elements are currently represented by only one or two completely sequenced
genomes. Conversely, four other unikont groups seem
to be clearly devoid of DIRS1-like elements. Despite a
high number of completely sequenced genomes and
diverse taxa tested, no well-conserved copies could be
identified in any ascomycetes (75 species), basidiomycetes (16 species), nematodes (12 species) or mammals
(37 species). A specific loss of DIRS1-like elements in
Mammalia during evolution is the most probable cause
of their absence when one takes into consideration their

Figure 3 Rooted phylogenetic tree based on the pol amino acid sequences of the DIRS1-like families identified. Distances are calculated
with JTT parameter model plus gamma distribution’s correction for amino acids. The tree is constructed using the Neighbor Joining method
and pairwise deletion of gaps option included in MEGA5.0 software. When possible, one representative copy sequence that required only minor
corrections for each family was integrated into our analysis. Reference elements are labeled with an asterisk and clusters that correspond to an
element annotated in this study are written in bold italics. If a reference element was included in a family, this sequence was chosen to
represent the family. In the cases of Anolis carolinensis, Daphnia pulex and Xenopus tropicalis, species that show a high family number, only four
or five of their most abundant families were integrated. Ty3/Gypsy element sequences were used as outgroups according to the close
relationships of their reverse transcriptase and RNase H domains with those of DIRS1-like and PAT retrotransposons. Support for individual
groups was evaluated with non-parametric bootstrapping using 100 replicates. Only bootstrap node values over 50% are represented.

Figure 4 Distribution of DIRS1-like elements among the eukaryote groups tested. Species phylogeny was redrawn from [42-45].
Chromalveolate species are shown with red branches, excavates with purple branches, plants with green branches, and unikonts with blue
branches. Groups in which DIRS1-like elements were detected and confirmed are shaded in yellow. Groups in which the presence of DIRS1-like
element remains uncertain are shaded in green. In each group, we include in parentheses the number of species harboring DIRS1-like
sequences (in blue) compared to the number of species analyzed (in red), as well as the number of species not screened in this study in which
DIRS1-like retrotransposons were previously reported (in purple). B: Bilateria, D: Deuterostomia, F: Fungi.

wide distribution in Unikonta, especially Deuterostomia.
Outside of unikonts, DIRS1-like retrotransposons appear
infrequently, observed in only three groups, even though
most groups are represented by relatively few species.
Various distributional patterns can currently be
observed among eukaryotes. On a large phylogenetic
scale, we make two observations: (i) a wide distribution
of DIRS1-like elements among groups such as deuterostomes, with the detection of copies in a wide range of
higher taxa from Echinodermata to Sauropsida; and (ii)
a large repartition of the DIRS1-like elements observed

in certain taxa despite a lack of detection in closely
related taxa. In fungi, all three Mucoromycotina genomes were found to harbor DIRS1-like elements,
whereas none could be detected in Ascomycota and
Basidiomycota. On a smaller phylogenetic scale (i.e.,
within a higher taxon), the distribution again appears to
be taxon-dependent with three distinguishable patterns.
As described above, some groups seem to possess no
DIRS1-like retrotransposons (e.g., mammals and streptophytes). Second, a large repartition of DIRS1-like elements was observed in some groups such as in

Piednoël et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:621
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/621

Actinopterygii and Mucoromycotina (detection in all 5
and 3 genomes tested, respectively). Finally, a sparser
distribution of DIRS1-like elements was observed in yet
other groups. Only 3 of the 22 hexapod species tested
harbor well-conserved elements. However, this heterogeneous distribution could result in part from a sampling
bias. We observed a lack of elements in some overrepresented taxa, such as Diptera (absence of detection in 16
Drosophila species tested), and an abundance in others,
such as Hymenoptera (in three wasp and five ant species). Indeed, we used ReDoSt to analyze the recently
released ant genomes, all of which harbor DIRS1-like
elements. Five copies were found in Camponothus floridanus, 22 in Pogonomyrmex barbatus, 37 in Harpegnathos saltator, 41 in Linepithema humile, and 57 in
Solenopsis invicta [27-31].
The previous though that DIRS1-like retrotransposons are uncommon among eukaryotes appears to be
strongly biased considering that ascomycetes, mammals and green plants, which are devoid of elements,
represent more than 55% of the sequenced genomes.
DIRS1-like elements do not appear as ubiquitous as
Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons but their
distribution among eukaryotes appears more comparable to the Penelope element distribution [12,13].
Despite their loss in several lineages, the phylogenetic
analysis and the distribution of DIRS1-like elements in
a very broad range of unikonts indicate that their
genomic invasion occurred early in unikont evolution;
at least prior to the Bilateria radiation but probably
before if we take into account the presence of DIRS1like retrotransposons in Amoebozoa and Fungi (Figure
4). This primary invasion could be found to have
occurred earlier in evolution if the presence of DIRS1like elements is confirmed in Excavata, Plantae and
Chromoalveolata. Though our results unequivocally
indicate the presence of DIRS1-like elements in Unikonta, we must be cautious in our estimation of their
real distribution in Excavata and Plantae because most
of the copies identified in these taxa harbor too many
indels and frameshifts in the repeated sequence structures to be studied and for them to be included in the
phylogenetic analysis. The presence of DIRS1-like elements in these species is only supported by similarity
search analyses.
The absence of DIRS1-like elements in several groups
may reflect their differential success in adapting to different host species and/or a propensity for stochastic
loss during evolution. Nevertheless, this absence has to
be confirmed in the future by investigations of deleted
DIRS1-like copies in these genomes. The detection of
deleted copies in an apparently “unoccupied” species
would be evidence of the previous existence of well-conserved DIRS1-like elements.

In-depth characterization of new DIRS1-like elements

To describe the diversity within the DIRS1-like superfamily, we detailed the structure of 28 new elements,
most of which represent high copy number families or
species newly characterized for the presence of such retrotransposons (e.g., A. californica and L. gigantea). Several features of DIRS1-like retrotransposons are
presented in Table 3, such as their length, the presence
of a long ORF overlap, and the structure of their repeats.
The length of DIRS1-like retrotransposons appears variable between the 28 elements from 3974 bp in AcasDIRS1 (Acantheamoeba sp.) to 6283 bp in SkoDIRS2 (S.
kowalevskii), with an average length of 5160 bp. In-depth
annotation including the positions of the repeated
sequences and several conserved motifs is provided in
Additional File 3. The pol motifs seem to be highly conserved, especially the ‘YL/IDD’ motif that is conserved in
25 of the 28 annotated elements. The ‘HSTR’ tyrosine
recombinase motif appears more variable (only harbored
by 13 of the 28 elements). For example, AmDIRS2 and
MciDIRS1 harbor an ‘SDLK’ and ‘LCPV’ sequence,
respectively. This suggests that the catalytic tyrosine
recombinase-encoding domain sequence could be less
constrained than the pol sequence. Twenty-three of the
elements begin and end with a trinucleotide NTT, most
frequent being ATT (Table 3). Only the AmDIRS1 from
A. macrogynus begins and ends with an uncommon GCrich motif. In almost all elements, this trinucleotide
appears complementary to the 3-bp circular junction.
Evidence of long ORF overlaps was found in half of the
28 DIRS1-like elements, which seems to depend on host
species (e.g., evidence in the five elements from Fungi
and none in Mollusca).
Previous studies have outlined the structure of DIRS1like retrotransposons, especially the nature of their termini, which complement the Internal Complementary
Regions (ICRs), and the presence of a right Extension
sequence (rE) [3]. Looking in detail at the repeated
sequences “lITR-lICR-rICR-rITR-rE” in these elements
allowed us to reveal a rather more complex structure
(Figure 5). Whereas previous studies only allowed the
description of a rE sequence, we have characterized an
equivalent left Extension sequence (lE) at the 5’-end of
some elements, which is only complementary to the left
ICR. The identification of this additional lE sequence
does not challenge the replication model that proposes a
rolling-circle intermediate. This intermediate is produced by the 3-bp circular junction that corresponds to
the overlap of the two ICRs complementary to the 5’and 3’- ends of the element [3-5]. All elements harbor
at least one extension, and, like DIRS1, most elements
contain only a rE. The lE region has only been detected
in fungi and amoebozoa species. Two elements show
only a lE (AcasDIRS1, AmDIRS1) and four other

The element size and trinucleotide sequences beginning and ending the element complementary to the circular junction are given for each manually annotated
DIRS1-like element. Evidence of long ORF overlap is also indicated. The lengths of the different parts of the termini (the divergent and the conserved ITRs, lE and
rE) as well as those of the ICRs are reported. nd: not determined because CaspDIRS1 corresponds to a chimeric sequence. Each newly identified element has

elements harbor the two extensions (e.g., AmDIRS2,
MciDIRS1). We hereby propose to redefine the fine
structure of the DIRS1-like element’s termini (Figures 5
and 6). In this study we call the left and right termini
(lTer and rTer) the assembly of the two components:
the ITRs and their respective potential extension (lE or
rE). The lE and rE regions are considered the external
sequences of the termini that are only complementary
to their respective ICR sequences (theoretically 100%
sequence identity). The ITRs are defined as the parts of
these terminal sequences that are mostly complementary
to each other. On a smaller scale, two parts can be distinguished within these ITRs (Figure 6). In the conserved ITR part, the two ITRs are strictly

complementary to each other. In the divergent ITR part,
the two ITR sequences are mostly constrained by their
respective ICR and remain only partially complementary
to each other, with a sequence identity that varies from
50% to 85%. ITR length appears highly variable among
the different elements, ranging from 66 bp (LgDIRS1) to
316 bp (DIRS1-2). Likewise, the length of the ICRs varies between 85 bp for the sum of the two ICRs in AcasDIRS1 and 130 bp in AcaDIRS1. The right extensions
vary from 9 bp to 75 bp (being apparently shorter in the
presence of a lE). In most cases, the sizes of the various
repeats are conserved among the different elements
from the same species (e.g., among AcDIRS1 and
AcDIRS2, or AcaDIRS1 and AcaDIRS2). The conserved

Figure 5 Structure of repeated sequences observed within DIRS1-like retrotransposons. The left (lTer) and right (rTer) termini as well as
the left (lICR) and right (rICR) ICRs are represented by triangles. ITRs are represented by bubbles. Blue items correspond to the complementary
lTer and the lICR sequences. Green items correspond to the complementary rTer and the rICR sequences. Colored parts of the lTer and rTer that
do not overlap red bubbles symbolize the lE and rE sequences. A: Element harboring only one extension (here the rE sequence). In this case, the
lICR is only complementary to the left ITR (lITR); B: Elements harboring both the lE and rE sequences.

ITR usually represents the largest part of the ITR, ranging from 31 bp to 304 bp (Table 3), whereas the divergent ITR is often small, ranging from 9 bp to 36 bp.
However, in some elements from molluscs both parts
have about the same size. Interestingly, the boundary
between these two ITR parts is composed of a short
sequence of at least 10 nucleotides that is conserved in
two ITRs and two ICRs (Figure 6), which may be
involved in the formation of the circular intermediate of
the element before its integration.

Conclusions
In this study, we developed a new computational tool,
ReDoSt, allowing us to describe more precisely the

distribution of DIRS1-like retrotransposons as well as
their diversity among eukaryote genomes. These elements appear more continuously distributed than previously though, with 8 new higher taxa characterized to
harbor these elements (e.g. Mollusca) and 14 new eukaryote species, giving a total of 61 species containing
DIRS1-like elements in their genome. The current
understanding of the distribution of DIRS1-like elements
in Eukaryota, and especially Unikonta, suggests the presence of DIRS1-like elements in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes. Whereas some higher taxa seem
clearly devoid of well-conserved DIRS1-like retrotransposons (e.g., ascomycetes, mammals and streptophytes),
these elements appear highly conserved in some other

right ICR (rICR) sequences are represented with the inverse complementary sequences of the right terminus (rTer) and the left ICR (lICR)
sequences. The left and right extensions (lE and rE) of the terminal regions are indicated by orange and brown boxes. The portion called

higher taxa, such as Actinopterygii and Mucoromycotina. Now that a large diversity of elements within the
DIRS1-like superfamily (around 300 different families)
have been characterized, it is possible to screen
sequence datasets for the presence of DIRS1-like elements using more conventional approaches like RepeatMasker. This large diversity allowed us to study the
phylogenetic relationships within the DIRS1-like superfamily in which the different groups appear related to
the host species. All of the elements included in the
phylogenetic analysis as well as the subset of 28 annotated elements were used to define two new alignment
profiles for each of the three characteristic domains of
the DIRS1-like retrotransposons: reverse transcriptase,
methyltransferase and tyrosine recombinase. These profiles could be used in further studies or in future automatic annotation of transposable elements within
genomes (Additional file 4).

Methods
Data collection

The 274 complete or draft genomic sequences were
downloaded from eight different databases: the DOE
Joint Genome Institute (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/), the
Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (http://www.broadinstitute.org/), the Human Genome Sequencing Center
at the Baylor College of Medicine (http://www.hgsc.bcm.
tmc.edu/), the Genome Center at Washington University

(http://genome.wustl.edu/), the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),
the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/), Genoscope (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/
spip/) and FlyBase (http://flybase.org/). Five additional
hymenopteran genomes were obtained from the Fourmidable database [29]. A complete list of all the genomes analyzed in this study and their sources is given in
Additional file 5. Species were selected only if their genome is larger than 10 Mb with sequence coverage sufficient to represent their entire genome, which was
labeled as complete or draft by the corresponding
sequencing center or by the GOLD database (http://
www.genomesonline.org/). Reference element sequences
that were used in the alignment profile design, MCL
clustering, and phylogenetic analysis correspond to the
DIRS1-like sequences that we could access in GenBank,
Retrobase (http://biocadmin.otago.ac.nz/fmi/xsl/retrobase/home.xsl) and Repbase Update database version
14.06 (http://www.girinst.org/repbase/update/index.
html).
Identification of DIRS1-like retrotransposons

We propose a new computational tool for DIRS1-like
retrotransposon identification, ReDoSt (Additional file 4,
updates available at http://wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/
ReDoSt/), based on both similarity searches of domains
and their organization in the element structure. The

Piednoël et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:621
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/621

similarity searches were performed using the RPSBLAST and PSI-BLAST programs [32] with an E-value
cutoff of 0.01 and specific alignment profiles for each
domain. This method, in comparison with BLAST or
RepeatMasker approaches, may be more permissive and
thus allow for the identification of more divergent elements. For example, using this method we identified 21
DIRS1-like copies in the A. macrogynus genome,
whereas only 16 well-conserved elements (i.e. simultaneous detection of the RT, MT and YR domains) were
detected using RepeatProteinMask and the RepeatPeps
library (included in the RepeatMasker package). We
used three different profiles whose positions within the
element are shown in Figure 1. For the RT-encoding
domain, we used the alignment profile ‘cd03714’ (118
amino acids, Conserved, Domain Database, http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). For the remaining two encoding
domains, we used two specific alignment profiles (282
and 93 amino acids for the YR and MT profiles, respectively) that we designed using DIRS1-like reference element alignments (Additional file 4, http://wwwabi.snv.

Page 14 of 18

jussieu.fr/public/ReDoSt/). Our automatic detection tool
is composed of six main steps (Figure 7): (1) Identification of all putative reverse transcriptase-encoding fragments within the genome; (2) Extraction of each
genomic hit with 5-kb flanking sequence on both sides
because all DIRS1-like elements described to date are
less than 6 kb in length; Within each genomic fragment
retained, (3) tyrosine recombinase-encoding domain
search and (4) methyltransferase-encoding domain
search; (5) After obtaining the 10-kb contigs that harbor
the three characteristic domains (RT, YR and MT) of
DIRS1-like retrotransposons, we checked the co-orientation and the order of these domains to discriminate
other types of YR-encoding retrotransposons (e.g.,
Ngaro and PAT elements); (6) Finally, fragments that
harbor at least two occurrences of the same domain
were set aside for copy number estimation, sequence
alignments, and supplementary investigations required
to determine from which rearrangements (duplications
or insertions) they are derived. Such a fragment has
then been considered a single copy of DIRS1-like

Genome in FASTA format (e.g., Rhizopus oryzae )

Step 1: Identification of Reverse Transcriptase encoding
domains

Step 2: Extraction of a fragment for each Reverse
Transcriptase hit with 5kb flanking sequences

Step 3: Identification of Tyrosine Recombinase encoding
domains within the 10kb extracted fragments

Step 4: Identification of Methyltransferase encoding
domains within the 10kb extracted fragments

Step 5: Filter for the co-orientation and the order of the
three coding domains

Step 6: Set aside the fragments harboring at least two
occurrences of one domain
Figure 7 ReDoSt pipeline developed in this study for the identification of DIRS1-like retrotransposons. To assess the efficiency of each
step of the pipeline, we detailed the number of fragments retained after each step for the genome of the fungus Rhizopus oryzae.

element in copy number estimation. We repeatedly
observed a bottleneck between the first and fourth steps
for all of the genomes tested (the example of R. oryzae
results given in Figure 7). We chose to be less stringent
in the first step by using an alignment profile designed
using a large diversity of elements, one third represented
by other types of tyrosine recombinase-encoding retrotransposons as well as one Gypsy element. As a consequence, many reverse transcriptase-encoding fragments
identified may belong to other retrotransposon superfamilies. Analyses were performed on an iDataPlex Linux
system (CPU 2.53 GHz, 3 GB memory).
Sequence analysis

Families of DIRS1-like elements were identified by clustering all the nucleotide reverse transcriptase-encoding
fragment sequences detected in the 32 species with the
MCL program (http://www.micans.org/mcl/, [33]).
Reference elements previously described and/or deposited in Repbase version 14.06 were also added to the
dataset. This method was used in previous studies on IS
transposons [34,35]. An E-value cutoff of 0.01 was used
for the initial BLASTN search. An inflation factor of 1.2
was computed to cluster sequences. These values are
effective at least in splitting elements of different previously defined DIRS1-like families (e.g., DrDIRS1,
DrDIRS2 and DrDIRS3 in D. rerio [5]). Because clustering results can depend on the dataset used, we tested
two different approaches: an independent clustering of
the elements within each tested genome and a global
clustering of all elements from all species. Similar results
were obtained regardless of the approach used (data not
shown), suggesting that the clusters obtained are wellsupported.
To perform the element annotation, we preferentially
selected elements from species in which DIRS1-like retrotransposons were not previously reported or from
families showing high copy number. The repetitive
structures (ICRs and ITRs) were detected using UGENE
(http://ugene.unipro.ru/index.html). When several copies
of a family were available for one species, the boundaries of the ITRs were manually analyzed and detection
of the flanking regions in multiple nucleotide sequence
alignments carried out using MUSCLE [36]. To check
the presence of ORF overlaps, we used the ORF Finder
tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/).
For phylogenetic analyses, a sequence from each
family was included that required none or only minor
corrections in its pol sequence (no large indels or multiple frameshifts). The amino acid pol sequence multiple
alignments were performed with MUSCLE and ambiguously aligned sites were removed using Gblocks [37].
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using neighborjoining (NJ) method and the pairwise deletion option of

Page 15 of 18

the MEGA5.0 software [38]. The best-fit model, the JTT
model [39] with gamma distribution, was selected with
Topali2 software [40] and support for individual groups
was evaluated with non-parametric bootstrapping [41]
using 100 replicates.
