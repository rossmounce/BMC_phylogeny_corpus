Abstract
Sourdough has played a significant role in human nutrition and culture for thousands of years and is still of
eminent importance for human diet and the bakery industry. Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis is the predominant key
bacterium in traditionally fermented sourdoughs.
The genome of L. sanfranciscensis TMW 1.1304 isolated from an industrial sourdough fermentation was sequenced with
a combined Sanger/454-pyrosequencing approach followed by gap closing by walking on fosmids. The sequencing
data revealed a circular chromosomal sequence of 1,298,316 bp and two additional plasmids, pLS1 and pLS2, with sizes
of 58,739 bp and 18,715 bp, which are predicted to encode 1,437, 63 and 19 orfs, respectively. The overall GC content
of the chromosome is 34.71%. Several specific features appear to contribute to the ability of L. sanfranciscensis to
outcompete other bacteria in the fermentation. L. sanfranciscensis contains the smallest genome within the lactobacilli
and the highest density of ribosomal RNA operons per Mbp genome among all known genomes of free-living bacteria,
which is important for the rapid growth characteristics of the organism. A high frequency of gene inactivation and
elimination indicates a process of reductive evolution. The biosynthetic capacity for amino acids scarcely availably in
cereals and exopolysaccharides reveal the molecular basis for an autochtonous sourdough organism with potential for
further exploitation in functional foods. The presence of two CRISPR/cas loci versus a high number of transposable
elements suggests recalcitrance to gene intrusion and high intrinsic genome plasticity.
Background
The use of sourdough is documented for > 5,000 years
and of eminent industrial importance in the production
of baked goods amounting to more than 3 million tons of
baked goods annually [1]. Annual per capita consumption of baked goods in Europe is 50-85 kg with up to 20%
involving sourdough fermentations with wheat or rye,
i. e. a total of > 3 million tons. To date, no bacterial genomes from strains adapted to this huge man made habitat
in millions of generations are available. Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis was first described in 1971 by Kline and
Sugihara who isolated and characterized obligately

heterofermentative lactobacilli from San Francisco sourdoughs [2]. The name Lactobacillus sanfrancisco refers to
the city where the sourdoughs from which the organism
was isolated had been propagated for more than 100
years. At that time the species was not included in the
Approved Lists of Bacterial Names and had no standing
in bacteriological nomenclature until the name was
revived by Weiss and Schillinger in 1984 [3]. To follow
the Rules of the International Code of Nomenclature
of Prokaryotes the species epithet was changed to
L. sanfranciscensis [4]. Sourdough fermentations worldwide are characterized by a highly stable association of
yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. In rye and wheat sourdoughs with a tradition of continuous propagation
by back-slopping procedures, L. sanfranciscensis is the
probably the most adapted species and regarded as

autochthonous key organism of the sourdough microbiota [5,6]. Its phylogenetic position within the genus lactobacillus is shown in Figure 1. Multiple metabolic
activities of L. sanfranciscensis have been described in the
literature that contribute to the quality of sourdough and
baked goods. With the exception of one report by Groeneveld et al. [7], who allotted isolates from fruit flies
exhibiting 97% rDNA sequence homologies as L. sanfranciscensis, this species has only been isolated from sourdoughs, while strains of all other species found in
sourdough are frequently isolated also from other habitats. None of the genome-sequenced strains of these genera, e. g. L. plantarum or L. reuteri were isolated from
sourdough. This raises the question for the role of man
in evolution of L. sanfranciscensis.
The sourdough microbiota including L. sanfranciscensis
contribute to dough rheology and flavour properties due to

a strong acidification by an optimized carbohydrate metabolism and the liberation of precursors of volatile compounds by the proteolytic system [8-10] and the catabolism
of specific amino acids [5,10,11]. Formation of exopolysaccharides (homopolysaccharides and fructooligosaccharides)
enhance texture, shelf life and nutritional value [12]. The
sequenced strain L. sanfranciscensis TMW 1.1304 was isolated in 2006 from a commercial mother sponge with a tradition of continuous propagation. The presence of this
strain in this sourdough starter was demonstrated over a
period of at least 20 years, and it accounts for more than
90% of the microflora of that product.

of 1,298,316 bp and two additional plasmids of 58,739 bp
and 18,715 bp. The genome size of strain TMW 1.1304
was estimated at approximately 1.3 Mbp on the basis of
results obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of
chromosomal DNA restriction fragments. A previous estimation of the apparent genome size based on four strains
of L. sanfranciscensis isolated from Italian sourdoughs and
the type strain DSM 20451T indicates 1.4 Mbp [13]. Thus,
the L. sanfranciscensis genome is the smallest genome
within the genus Lactobacillus so far followed by the
recently published genome of Lactobacillus iners AB-1
with 1,304 Mbp [14]. The general features of the sequence
are presented in Table 1. The average orf length is 835
and the codon density is 87.1, which is in the range of
other lactobacilli (Additional file 1).
On the basis of analysis of the GC skew (G-C/G+C), the
cumulative GC-skew and the location of characteristic
genes (chromosomal replication initiator protein DnaA)
we could identify a typical bacterial origin of replication
and its beginning was assigned as base-pair one of the genome. Thus, two equal replication arms (replichores) were
present and the locations of the predicted 1,437 coding
sequences on the two strands correlated well with the
direction of replication (Fig. 2). There were 153 pseudogenes found randomly distributed in the chromosome.
Genes encoding replication functions overlap sequences
with significant changes in GC skew indicating the location of the origin of replication (oriC). This region harbors
the genes for the replication initiator protein (dnaA), the
beta subunit of DNA polymerase III (dnaN), and the DNA
gyrase subunits A and B (gyrA and gyrB). The arrangement of these genes, dnaA-dnaN-recF-gyrB-gyrA, is similar to that found in other Gram-positive bacterial genomes
studied so far. Five DnaA-box consensus sequences

Page 3 of 11

(TTATNCACA) were found upstream of dnaA and three
in the dnaA-dnaN intergenic region. Opposite of the genome between position 628,700 and 628,800 a second
change in GC skew indicates the replication terminus.
Stable RNA gene density and codon usage bias

Seven rRNA operons and 61 tRNA genes were detected,
demonstrating an intriguingly high density of genes for
stable RNAs in the genome of L. sanfranciscensis TMW
1.1304. Analysis of approx. 1000 complete genomes
(Additional file 2) available in GenBank revealed that
L. sanfranciscensis TMW 1.1304 has the highest rRNA
operon density (5.39 per Mbp) among all known free-living organisms. The only genome with a higher rRNA
gene density is that of Candidatus Carsonella ruddii PV
(1 rRNA operon in its 0,159662 Mbp genome), an obligate insect endosymbiont not capable of autonomous
growth whose status as a living organism is debatable
[15] due to the lack of most replication, transcription and
translation genes considered as essential for living cells.
Interestingly, 50% of the top 20 species with the highest
rRNA gene densities (rRNA gene densities above 2.9 per
Mbp; species represented by more than one sequenced
genome were only counted once; genomes from nonfree-living bacteria with canditatus status were disregarded) were lactic acid bacteria, i. e. various Lactobacillus and Streptococcus species (Additional file 3).
Multiple rRNA operons, which are found in many prokaryotes, may be of importance to achieve high growth
rates and to adapt rapidly to changing environmental
conditions [16,17]. We postulate that the exceptionally
high rRNA operon density on the L. sanfranciscensis genome allows the bacteria to respond quickly to favorable
growth conditions in their sourdough environment,

rapidly initiating fermentative metabolism and fast
growth which in combination with their specifically
adapted metabolism (see below) could help to out-compete other contaminating bacteria. This strategy may also
hold true for other lactic acid bacteria with a high rRNA
operon density such as Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus (second-ranking after L. sanfranciscensis with
an rRNA operon density of 4.85/Mbp of strain ATCC
BAA-365) which is one of the classical starter organisms
responsible for rapid lactic fermentation during yoghurt
production.

Numerous microbial genomes reveal a codon usage
bias (CUB), i.e. a pronounced preference for a specific
set of codons (named major codons), in genes whose
products are required in large quantities, which
improves translation efficiency of these genes and contributes to optimizing cell growth [18,19][20]. The
L. sanfranciscensis genome revealed a relatively strong
CUB. A closer look at the set of genes that are translationally optimized in this organism revealed that the top
80 hits expectedly contained many genes (44) encoding
ribosomal proteins and translation factors (Additional

Vogel et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S6

file 4), but also with the exception of the ribulose-5phosphate epimerase gene all genes for the formation of
lactate, CO2 and ethanol via the phosphoketolase pathway, underscoring the importance of the efficient
expression of this pathway for L. sanfranciscensis.
Carbohydrate metabolism

Consistent with the classification of L. sanfranciscensis as a
heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium (LAB) all genes
required for the phosphoketolase pathway are present in
the L. sanfranciscensis genome whereas no homologues to
transaldolase or transketolase were found. In silico analyses revealed that the sequenced L. sanfranciscensis strain
is likely to use maltose, fructose, ribose and gluconate as
carbon sources (Additional file 5). Additionally, two copies
of a transporter for arabinose were found (LSA_1450,
LSA_1460) of which only one seems to be functional as
LSA_1460 is truncated at the 3’ end. The presence of two
genes for oligo-1,6-glucosidase (LSA_05810; LSA_01770)
indicates the ability to hydrolyse a-1,6-D-glucosidic linkages in oligosaccharides produced from starch and glycogen (isomaltulose, isomaltotriose, panose and isomaltose).
Except for maltose phosphorylase (LSA_01510) and a
truncated alpha-glucosidase (LSA_05800) no additional
ORFs for glycoside hydrolases were annotated.
Growth of L. sanfranciscensis with maltose as carbon
source is generally accelerated when fructose, citrate or aketoglutarate are used as alternative electron acceptors.
[21,22]. Several uptake systems for possible electron acceptors were present. Fructose can be transported by a fructose permease (LSA_2810) and reduced to mannitol using
a mannitol-2-dehydrogenase (LSA_02820). Two genes for
citrate-sodium symporters (LSA_08630 and LSA_13030)
and one gene encoding a malate uniport protein
(LSA_02110) suggest uptake of citrate and malate. Genes
necessary to reduce citrate to lactate are also present
(LSA_12980 and LSA_12990 for citrate lyase, LSA_13020
for oxaloacetate decarboxylase, while no homologue gene
for a succinate dehydrogenase which is necessary for the
utilization of malate as electron acceptor was found.
The use of a-KG as electron acceptor by conversion to
2-hydroxyglutarate by LAB was previously mentioned by
Radler and Broehl, 1984[23]. Recently, reduction of a-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate was demonstrated in
L. sanfranciscensis indicating that a-ketoglutarate was used
preferably as electron acceptor and NADH-dependent
hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase activity was confirmed by
enzymatic analysis of crude cell extracts of L. sanfranciscensis[22]. Several orfs with putative a–hydroxy acid dehydrogenase activity were present.
As expected, the genome of L. sanfranciscensis only
encodes an incomplete citrate cycle as only genes for
fumarate hydratase (LSA_12040), malate dehydrogenase

Page 5 of 11

(LSA_02100; LSA_04670) and citrate lyase (LSA_12980
and LSA_12990) are present.
Pyruvate metabolism

Due to a frameshift in the pyruvate oxidase gene (EC
1.2.3.3/ LSA_00220) direct conversion of pyruvate to
acetyl phosphate is not possible for L. sanfranciscensis.
Therefore, the organism most likely converts pyruvate
to acetate via lactate first and then generates acetyl
phosphate from acetate. Enzymes required for redundant pathways like formate C-acetyltransferase (EC
2.3.1.54) or acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.10)
were not encoded by the L. sanfranciscensis genome but
in lactobacilli with larger genomes like L. plantarum or
L. casei. In spite of the presence of only a relative low
number of pyruvate dissipating enzymes in the L. sanfranciscensis genome, a high degree of redundancy for
lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) encoding genes was
observed as at least three L-lactate dehydrogenases
(LSA_09870, LSA_11450, LSA_13040) and three D-lactate dehydrogenases (LSA_00860, LSA_10990,
LSA_12510) were found, among which LSA_11450 and
LSA_12510 are pseudogenes. The presence of several
copies of ldh genes in other lactobacilli, e.g. L. plantarum[24] or L. casei ATCC 334 [25] in connection
with the broad range of substrate selectivity described
for those enzymes stresses their key function of NAD+
regeneration. Pyruvate can be produced by L. sanfranciscensis from a number of substrates. Besides the usual
formation from sugars and gluconate via the phosphoketolase pathway, pyruvate can be generated from asparagine and alanine via transamination and from malate
catalysed by malate dehydrogenase (LSA_02100, EC
1.1.1.38).
Formation of exopolysaccharides (EPS)

Formation of EPS is a trait often found in lactic acid
bacteria [26]. Heterofermentative lactobacilli occurring
in sourdough mostly synthesize glucan or fructan homopolymers. These are formed from sucrose by secreted or
cell-anchored glucosyltransferases, which convert the
sucrose into high-molecular-weight polymers, with the
concomitant release of the respective hexose.
In TMW 1.1304 two genes encode respective glucosytransferases, both carrying a LPXTG sortase recognition
motif. A plasmid encoded dextransucrase (LSA_2p00510)
with a best protein match (85%) to a dextransucrase of L.
reuteri JCM 1112 is obviously not active due to the lack of
ca. 500 aa residues at the N-terminus and an atypical
small molecular weight. A levansucrase (LSA_LSA_02160)
was found to be identical toa levansucrase previously
described by Tieking et al. from L. sanfranciscensis TMW
1.392 [27]. Interestingly, a 48 aa residue deletion

Vogel et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S6
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S6

corresponding to 4 direct repeats (PVNPSQPTTPAK) in
the PXX motif of the C-terminal cell wall anchor is
observed.
The production of EPS by TMW 1.1304 can be
demonstrated by growing the strain on mMRS containing 80 g l−1 sucrose. To analyze the type of the polymer,
the EPS was precipitated by adding two volumes of
ethanol (99%) and incubation at 4°C for 18 h. EPS was
hydrolyzed with perchloric acid at 100°C for 3 h and
sugar monomers were analyzed with HPLC as described
by Waldherr et al, 2008 [28]. Under these conditions
the EPS produced by TMW 1.1304 was demonstrated to
consist of fructose, indicating that EPS is a high molecular fructan and the levansucrase is functional.
Besides their role for bacterial metabolism, for which
protective functions and an altered metabolite profile as
a result of alternative use of electron acceptors are discussed, exopolysaccharides impact on crumb structure
and shelf life of sourdough breads. Fructans and fructooligosaccharides likely produced by L. sanfranciscensis
TMW 1.304 may serve further functional aspects in
nutrition and medicine [29].
Amino acid metabolism

In silico analyses of the genome of L. sanfranciscensis
TMW 1.1304 indicate the potential to synthesize de novo
four amino acids (alanine from pyruvate, aspartate from
oxaloacetate, glutamate and glutamine. L-alanine can be
converted into L-cysteine using a cysteine desulfurase
(EC 2.8.1.7, LSA_0990), while arginine, lysine and asparagine result from conversion pathways of L-aspartate.
Therefore, L. sanfranciscensis is auxotroph for the
remaining 12 amino acids (Table 2). As concentrations in
wheat of aspartate, asparagine and glutamate are low,
preservation of the biosynthetic pathways for these suggests adaptation to the sourdough environment.
Purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis

The enzyme required to generate 5-phosphoribosyl-1pyrophosphate (PRPP) from the phosphoketolase pathway intermediate ribulose-5-phosphate (EC 5.3.1.6/
LSA_04470 and EC 2.7.6.1/ LSA_04050; LSA_09930) are

Page 6 of 11

present in L. sanfranciscensis. As described for L. gasseri
[30] six of the subsequent nine enzymes required to
generate IMP from PRPP seem to be absent in L. sanfranciscensis. However, guanosine and adenosine as well
as the corresponding nucleotides could be generated
from IMP.
Although all genes necessary for the de novo synthesis of
pyrimidines are present, L. sanfranciscensis is presumably
auxotrophic for pyrimidines. The gene for dihydroorotase
(EC 3.5.2.3; LSA_05890, LSA_05900), one of the five
enzymes needed to generate UMP from carbamoyl-phosphate seems to be inactive due to a frameshift. Besides the
dihydroorotase gene no additional pseudogenes are present in the pyrimidine metabolism of L. sanfranciscensis.
Cofactors

Similar to other lactobacilli, L. sanfranciscensis appears
unable to synthesize most cofactors and vitamins like
folate, thiamine, riboflavin, vitamine B6, nicotinate and
nicotinamide. In silico analysis predicts that this organism
can utilize both nicotinate and nicotinamide to generate
NAD. However, this is only possible as two of the key
enzymes, nicotinamidase (Ec 3.5.1.19) and nicotinate
phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.11) are encoded by
the plasmid pLS2 ( LSA_2p00220, LSA_2900230).
Although only one gene involved in cobalamine synthesis (cobyrinic acid a, c-diamide synthase, EC 6.3.5.11;
LSA_2900630) was encoded by the sequenced strain
L. sanfranciscensis TMW1.1304, growth experiments
showed that 8 of 11 L. sanfranciscensis strains tested were
able to grow on vitamin B12 free media (Difco®) indicating that those strains were able to synthezise cobalamine
de novo.
Proteolytic system

The predicted auxotrophy for 12 amino acids for L. sanfranciscensis was consistent with the presence of a large
number of peptidases, proteases and transport systems for
amino acids and peptides (Additional file 6). A complex
proteolytic system ensures not only the supply with essential amino acids but also likely provides L. sanfranciscensis
with a selective advantage in its protein-rich environment

as acquisition of amino acids from the environment is
energetically more favourable than de novo synthesis [10].
The absence of an extracellular protease (prt) gene in
the genome of L. sanfranciscensis reflects its high adaptation to and the associated dependency on sourdough. In
contrast, dairy lactobacilli with comparable auxotrophy for
amino acids like L. helveticus or L. acidophilus encode prt
genes for proteinase production as milk only has low proteolytic activity and therefore degradation of casein to oligopeptides is a prerequisite for the growth of lactic acid
bacteria in milk [31,32].
Peptides and amino acids present in the sourdough
environment are internalized by peptide transporters and
amino acid permeases. The L. sanfranciscensis genome
encodes a di-/tripeptide transporter dtpT (LSA_04370) and
a complete oligopeptide transport system Opp. All five
genes of the Opp system (oppD, oppF, oppB, oppC, oppA)
are organized in an operon (LSA_0280-LSA_0320). In
addition to several amino acid transporters with unknown
specificity, ABC transporters for glutamine (glnHMPQ,
LSA_13380-13410), methionine (LSA_12550-12560,
LSA_0940, LSA_08450) and cystine (tcyABC, LSA_01990,
LSA_8550, LSA_8540, LSA_10490) are predicted. Additionally a lysine-specific permease (LSA_11550), a serinethreonine antiporter (steT, LSA_03230), an arginineornithine antiporter (arcD, LSA_12260), a choline-glycine
betaine transporter (LSA_11780) and a g-aminobutyrate
permease (LSA_8760) are present.
L. sanfranciscensis has 20 genes encoding cytoplasmatic
peptidases of different specificity to hydrolyze incorporated peptides into free amino acids. (Additional file 6).
Many of the genes were described in L. sanfranciscensis
previously [33], but the genome sequence included novel
genes with homology to the pepB, pepD, pepE, pepM,
pepO, pepQ, and pepV. Compared to other LAB no correlation between amino acid auxotrophy and content of
cytoplasmatic peptidases can be observed.
Regulators

Based on the presence of conserved functional domains 2
two-component regulatory systems and 38 transcriptional
regulators including five pseudogenes were predicted
(Additional files 7 and 8). Compared to L. acidophilus
NCFM that harbours 9 two-component regulatory systems, this is a quite low number of genes involved in gene
regulation and might reflect adaptation to a stable and
nutrient-rich environment, where less adaptive regulation
is required [34][30]. Like for other sequenced lactobacilli
the numerically predominant regulatory protein families
are repressors, i. e. MarR (five members), AcrR (four
members) and MerR (four members). Besides cspA and
the 2 two-component regulatory systems only two transcriptional activators both belonging to the LysR family

Page 7 of 11

were predicted. L. sanfranciscensis has three genes encoding for sigma factors. Besides the primary sigma-factor
rpoD (LSA_7720) two genes for rpoE (LSA_03460 and
LSA_4550), a sigma factor involved in high temperature
and oxidative stress response are present.
Phage defense/restriction/modification systems

CRISPR loci play a critical role in the adaptation and persistence of a microbial host in a particular ecosystem. The
observed similarity between spacers and phage or plasmid
sequences has led to the hypothesis that CRISPRs may
provide resistance against foreign DNA determinants
[35-39]. Using CRISPRFinder [36], a web tool to identify
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR) we identified two CRISPR loci. A chromosomally located CRISPR/cas system consists of three cas
genes followed by two 29 bp CRISPR spacers. Repeat
length (36 bp) and sequence similarity indicates its belonging to the Lsal1 family. A plasmid-located CRISPR/cas system consists of 5 cas genes and a CRISPR with 14 spacers,
where the 28 bp repeats are separated from the cas genes
by an IS607-family transposase gene. Repeat size (29bp)
and sequence as well as spacer size (32/33bp) are identical
to L. brevis ATCC 367 CRISPR Ldbu1-family [40]. Only
one other plasmid-encoded CRISPR/cas system was identified on the Enterococcus faecium pHT beta plasmid [41].
The repeat number in L. sanfranciscensis is below the
average number of repeats per locus of 19.5 found in
other LAB [40].
Very few phages of lactobacilli have been isolated from
sourdough samples [42,43] and only one phage active on L.
sanfranciscensis was described [44]. BLAST analysis of
spacer sequences resulted in the identification of only two
significant hits for plasmid-encoded spacer 14 with 100 %
similarity to Lactococcus lactis plasmid pEW104
(AF097471) and for the chromosomal spacer 2 with 93 %
to L. plantarum plasmid pLTK2 (AB024514). No hit was
found for a known phage sequence. While phage infections
and spread in sourdough cultures may be hampered by the
solid texture of the fermentative mass in batch systems the
presence of CRISPR/cas may generally account for genetic
stability of this strain in the sourdough environment making it a stable element over decades of fermentation.
Mobile elements

The presence of 111 transposases (including 25 pseudogenes) in IS elements in five different IS element families (
IS3, IS30, ISL3, IS200/605, IS256) represent 7.7% of the
ORFs found and are, as a result of the small chromosome,
found in higher proportion than in other lactobacilli.
Thus, an idea of facilitated niche adaptation of a distinct
Lactobacillus subpopulation by a relative increase of genome plasticity is supported.

Stress response

Among genes related to heat, cold, acid, DNA damage and
starvation genes related to the capability to respond to
osmotic and oxidative stress are pronounced despite the
small genome, suggesting that L. sanfranciscensis frequently faces such stresses. Generally, tolerance to oxygen
of lactic acid bacteria requires the presence of catalase
and/or NADH oxidases or several thiol-active enzyme systems including the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase couple, the glutathione-GshR system and a cyst(e)ine uptake
and metabolism. On the basis of sequence similarity beside
a NADH oxidase (LSA_05610) we identified in L. sanfranciscensis, a glutathione reductase (LSA_2p00270), a glutaredoxin-like protein (LSA_04700), two thioredoxin
reductases (LSA_02530, LSA_05170), a putative thioredoxin peroxidase (LSA_09790), three thioredoxin-like proteins (LSA_08950, LSA_02610, LSA_06080) and a cyst(e)
ine transport protein (LSA_08550). It was previously
reported that a glutathione reductase negative mutant
strain of L. sanfranciscensis DSM20451T lost oxygen tolerance and exhibited a strongly decreased aerobic growth
rate compared to either the growth rate under anaerobic
conditions or that of the wild-type strain. Moreover aerobic growth was restored by the addition of cysteine [45].
In the majority of organisms glutathione is synthesized by
the sequential action of g-glutamylcysteine synthetase and
glutathione synthetase, encoded by gshA and gshB, respectively. The genome of L. sanfranciscensis contain no
homolog of these two enzymes indicating that glutathione
is probably to be imported from the medium. Actually, in
the traditional backslopping sourdough process is a solid
state fermentation with varying water activities and
repeated mixing procedures frequently introduce oxygen.
However, oxygen is readily used as electron acceptor in
the reaction of NADH oxidase II, which directly produces
water.
Bacteriocins

The production of inhibitory substances by sourdough
LAB could provide another selective advantage for the
producer strains [46]. Bacteriocins so far discovered from
sourdough LAB and include the bacteriocins bavaricin A
[47], plantaricin ST31 [48] and the bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance L. sanfranciscensis C57. [49].
No functionally active bacteriocin genes are found in
the genome. Only two truncated genes sharing 100%
with papA encoding pediocin were found. Thus, bacteriocin production cannot be the reason for the long term
competitiveness of this bacterium in sourdough.
Plasmids and plasmid encoded traits

Two plasmids pLS1 and pLS2 were present in strain
TMW 1.1304. While plasmid-encoded traits for lactobacilli frequently include genes for sugar metabolism

Page 8 of 11

plasmids pLS1 and pLS2 harbour genes involved in
nucleotide/NADH metabolism and are further characterized by the presence of many orfs encoding transposases.
The total DNA sequence of pLS1 consists of 58,739 bp
with a GC content of 37.6 % encoding 59 orfs. Two genes
encoding Rep B (replication associated replication protein)
and RepA are homologous to the corresponding genes of
the L. brevis plasmid pLB925A04 that is a theta type replication plasmid of the pAMb-1-family [50]. A truncated
dextransucrase (LSA_2p00510) is discussed above. PLS1
contains a CRISPR/cas locus further supporting the
importance of this function even at an enhanced copy
number (see above).
The total DNA sequence of pLS2 consists of 18,715
bp with a GC content of 36.1 % and encodes 19 orfs.
The replication protein RepB shows 80% similarity to a
RepB protein of Enterococcus faecium E1636 (EMBL
EFF23229.1) and 40 % to a RepB of plasmid pLTK13
(EMBL BAG67041), a rolling circle replicating plasmid
of L. plantarum L137. Replication of the lagging strand
of RC plasmids initiates from their single-strand origins
(SSOs). SSOs have a high potential for intrastrand pairing and based on their secondary structures, several
types of SSOs have been identified [51,52]. PLS2 contains a palindromic region (position 21–58) whose secondary structure is similar to the ssoA-type origin. A
restriction / modification system consists of a cytosinespecific methyltransferase followed by a restriction
endonuclease gene similar to the McrBC restriction
endonuclease system of Rhodobacter capsulatus ATCC
BAA-309 (EMBL ADE85042 .1).

Material and methods
Strain selection, strain purification and DNA isolation

For sequencing a strain without any laboratory transfers
was selected to ensure sequencing of a truly sourdough
adapted clone. Therefore, the strain was isolated on
mMRS [53] at 30°C from “Böcker Reinzuchtsauer”, a rye
sourdough starter, which is now propagated for 100 years
in the same tradition, and only propagated on laboratory
media to obtain enough DNA for sequencing. Dilutions of
a sourdough sample were spread directly on mMRS agar
plates. Plates were incubated under anaerobic conditions
at 30 °C for 3–5 days. Genomic DNA was isolated with
the EZNA DNA reagent set (Omega Bio-Tek) according
the provided protocol for Gram positive bacteria.
Sequencing strategy

Sequencing was done in a combined Sanger/454-pyrosequencing approach. 454 sequencing resulted in 187,929
reads with an average read length of 250 nucleotides giving ~45 Mbp sequencing data corresponding to a 33-fold
coverage. In addition 10,000 genomic fragments with
typically 3kb to 5 kb inserts were cloned into the TOPO

Vogel et al. Microbial Cell Factories 2011, 10(Suppl 1):S6
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/10/S1/S6

TA vector (Quiagen, Hilden) and sequenced on an ABI
3730 capillar sequencer from both ends. The ABI
sequences resulted in 19.569 reads corresponding to an
additional coverage of 13 fold. Remaining gaps were
closed by sequences generated on gap-spanning PCR
products by an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer. The overall
quality was set to a minimum confidence of PHRED 45
for the complete genome.
This genome project has been deposited in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)/Gen- Bank
under the accession numbers CP002461 (chromosome),
CP002462 (pLS1) and CP002463 (pLS2). The version
described in this paper is the first version. Prediction of
protein encoding sequences and open reading frames
(ORFs) were initially accomplished with PEDANT software suite [54]. The PEDANT genome database provides
exhaustive annotation of nearly 3000 publicly available
eukaryotic, eubacterial, archaeal and viral genomes. Gene
prediction was performed with GenMark 2.8 [55]and
Glimmer 3.0 [56]as implemented in the Pedant software
suite. All orf predictions were verified and modified by a
blasting orfs to NCBI nrdb. Additionally, the predicted
start codons of all ORFs were inspected manually using
the Artemis program [57]. Clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) were identified with
the web tool CRISPRFinder [36].
Phylogenetic tree

A phylogenetic tree on the basis of a multiple 16S
rDNA alignment based similarity matrix was constructed by the neighbour-joining method [58] using the
software package Bionumerics v6.5 (Applied Maths, Belgium). Unknown bases were discarded for the analyses.
Bootstrapping analysis was undertaken to test the statistical reliability of the topology of the neighbour-joining
tree using 100 bootstrap resamplings of the data
Exopolysaccharide analysis

For production of EPS strain TMW 1.1304 was grown
on mMRS containing 80 g l−1 of sucrose at 30°C for 24
h. To analyze the type of the polymer the EPS was precipitated by adding two volumes of ethanol (99%) and
incubation at 4°C for 18 h. EPS was hydrolyzed with
perchloric acid at 100°C for 3 h and sugar monomers
were analyzed with HPLC as described by Waldherr
et al. 2008 [28].
