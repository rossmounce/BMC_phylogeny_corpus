Abstract
Background: The nasal cavity of all vertebrates houses multiple chemosensors, either innervated
by the Ist (olfactory) or the Vth (trigeminal) cranial nerve. Various types of receptor cells are
present, either segregated in different compartments (e.g. in rodents) or mingled in one epithelium
(e.g. fish). In addition, solitary chemosensory cells have been reported for several species. Alligators
which seek their prey both above and under water have only one nasal compartment. Information
about their olfactory epithelium is limited. Since alligators seem to detect both volatile and watersoluble odour cues, I tested whether different sensory cell types are present in the olfactory
epithelium.
Results: Electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry were used to examine the sensory
epithelium of the nasal cavity of the American alligator. Almost the entire nasal cavity is lined with
olfactory (sensory) epithelium. Two types of olfactory sensory neurons are present. Both types
bear cilia as well as microvilli at their apical endings and express the typical markers for olfactory
neurons. The density of these olfactory neurons varies along the nasal cavity. In addition, solitary
chemosensory cells innervated by trigeminal nerve fibres, are intermingled with olfactory sensory
neurons. Solitary chemosensory cells express components of the PLC-transduction cascade found
in solitary chemosensory cells in rodents.
Conclusion: The nasal cavity of the American alligator contains two different chemosensory
systems incorporated in the same sensory epithelium: the olfactory system proper and solitary
chemosensory cells. The olfactory system contains two morphological distinct types of ciliated
olfactory receptor neurons.

Background
The nasal cavity of all vertebrates houses multiple chemosensors. The olfactory and the vomeronasal receptors
detect a variety of odours including food-related and
social signals. In addition, chemically-sensitive free nerve

endings of the trigeminal nerve and trigeminally innervated chemosensors that respond to irritants have been
reported for some vertebrate species. The chemosensors
are expressed in various cell types. In mammals, the olfactory system contains ciliated and microvillous olfactory

receptor neurons (OSNs). In many mammals these neurons are segregated in two compartments: ciliated OSNs
are housed in the main olfactory epithelium detecting
chemicals related mostly to food and microvillous OSNs
in the so-called vomeronasal organ (VNO) detecting
mostly (but not limited to) social cues [1]. Fish olfactory
epithelium also contains ciliated and microvillous OSNs
[2], but here both cell types are intermingled in one olfactory epithelium since fish do not have a VNO. In mammals as well as in fish, both ciliated and microvillous
OSNs utilize characteristic G-proteins in their transduction cascade: Gαolf is present in ciliated OSNs; Gαi, Gαo
and/or Gαq are present in microvillous OSNs [3-7].
Chemoreception in semi-aquatic animals is interesting per
se since both volatile and water-soluble compounds have
to be detected in two different environments. Most semiaquatic reptiles (turtles, tortoises, snakes) and amphibians possess a VNO lined with microvillous OSNs as well
as the main olfactory chamber [8-11]. Turtles employ the
main olfactory epithelium and the VNO to detect airborne and/or water-soluble chemicals. However, this
compartmentalization does not lead to a strict separation
of volatile and soluble odorants. The VNO of semiaquatic turtles responds to both volatile and non-volatile
odorants [12]. Female tree frogs can detect aquatic sex
pheromones from male frogs [13]. Axolotls (Ambystoma
mexicanum) use their olfactory and vomeronasal systems
equally to detect social cues from conspecifics [14]. The
olfactory system of Triturus pyrrhogaster, changes morphologically and physiologically when the animals are kept
either in a terrestrial or an aquatic environment [15,16].
Information about the nasal cavity of crocodilians is limited (for early macroscopic studies see [17]). This is not
surprising given the difficulty of obtaining and handling
the specimens. On the other hand, chemoreception in
crocodilians (comprising the three families: Alligatoridae,
Crocodylidae, and Gavialidae) is especially interesting
since they hunt both in terrestrial and in aquatic surroundings. Crocodilians have only one olfactory chamber
[18,19]. A VNO is absent in the adult animals. Thus, at
first glance, crocodilians seem to have only one olfactory
system comprising the main olfactory chamber and what
type(s) of OSNs are present in the olfactory epithelium is
unknown. Also, little is known about how crocodilians
use their olfactory system. Neill [20] reported that the
American alligator detects blood in the water. Behavioural
and olfactometer experiments suggest that crocodilians
detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals and
use their olfactory system for hunting [18]. When above
water, crocodilians enhance their ability to detect volatile
odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the
floor of the pharynx [21,11,22]. If crocodilians do not
have two different nasal compartments but detect both

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/64

air-borne and water-soluble chemicals: do they have different types of olfactory neurons?
Also of interest is whether crocodilians possess trigeminally innervated solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs).
These are specialized cells that have been described for
anamniote vertebrates including hagfish [23], teleosts and
amphibians [24-26]. SCCs, which are modified epithelial
cells, represent a separate chemosensory system without a
specific endorgan. These secondary receptor cells, i.e. lacking an axon, are scattered in different epithelia (e.g. skin,
oropharyngeal cavity, nasal cavity, gills) and detect various chemical substances depending on the species investigated. These cells are scarce, and since they are scattered
in the epithelium as single cells, no cell counts exist except
for few fish species [27] and rats [28]. SCCs are also
present in the nasal cavity and the respiratory tract of
rodents where they detect irritants [28,29]. In rodents,
SCCs express T2R "bitter-taste" receptors and α-gustducin,
a G-protein involved in chemosensory transduction as
well as phospholipase β2 (PLCβ2), a downstream component of the T2R-gustducin transduction cascade. Peptidergic fibres (containing Substance P/calcitonin gene-related
peptide CGRP) of the trigeminal nerve form synaptic contacts with these cells [28]. Given the different origin and
different innervation and transduction pathway of these
receptor cells, it is obvious that SCCs represent a chemosensory system different from that of olfaction.
SCCs have also been reported for the oral and nasal cavity
of cows [30] and the nasal epithelia of humans [31] but it
is unclear whether the SCCs of mammals are related to the
SCCs of anamniote vertebrates. The presence of similar
SCCs in a reptile would support phylogenetic continuity
rather than convergence between the anamniote and
mammalian groups, suggesting that the SCCs are homologous throughout the vertebrate lineage.
The present study is the first to utilize electron microscopy
and immunocytochemistry to examine the peripheral
olfactory organ of a crocodilian, the American alligator
Alligator mississipiensis. The study focussed on two questions: (1) What are the cell types in the nasal epithelium
and does their ultrastructure and/or distribution give any
clues regarding the differences between olfaction above or
under water? Scanning and transmission electron microscopy was utilized to describe the cell types present. Furthermore, immunocytochemical tests with markers
typically used for olfactory neurons were applied. (2) Do
alligators possess solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) thus
suggesting that this chemosensory system is a conserved
trait in the vertebrate lineage? The criteria for identifying
SCCs were twofold: 1) morphology and 2) immunoreactivity to markers for SCCs. SCCs previously found in various vertebrates showed similarities in terms of cell shape

and cell organelles. The cells are spindle-shaped with an
apical ending that bears either one big villus or few
smaller villi. At the surface of the epithelium, the apical
ending is often constricted into a "neck". The cell body is
filled with abundant vesicles of different shape and size
[25,32,28]. A marker for the transduction pathway of
SCCs is PLCβ2 [28,31,29]. Since SCCs are secondary
receptor cells they are contacted by nerve fibres and these
are immunoreactive for CGRP or Substance P.

Results
Overall Organization and Histology
For a better understanding of the nasal cavity of alligators,
cryosections of the nasal cavity were stained with Kernechtrot-Lichtgrün-Orange (KLO) (nuclear red-light greenorange G) and semithin sections were stained with toluidin blue [33]. To describe the olfactory epithelium macroscopically, the criteria commonly applied to olfactory
epithelium were used. The receptor neurons are categorized according to their height and structure within the
epithelium: tall cells with their nuclei in the lower portion
of the epithelium and long slender dendrites are considered ciliated OSNs. Intermediate cells with their nuclei in
the middle portion of the epithelium and short thick dendrites are considered microvillous OSNs (this latter cell
type did not occur in the alligator epithelium) [34]. For
convenience of description the nasal cavity was divided
into 5 anterior-posterior zones, numbered 1 to 5 from
anterior to posterior (Fig. 1C). The epithelium in each
zone varies in thickness between 50 and 150 µm (Fig. 2).
As seen in other vertebrates, the epithelium is pseudostratified with long, slender cells (Figs. 2E,F, 3A) that stretch
from the basal lamina to the lumen of the nasal cavity.
Bowman glands lie beneath the epithelium (Fig. 2B,D,E,
5B) and olfactory axons aggregate above and under the
basal lamina (Fig. 4B). The occurrence of OSNs, however,
is not limited to either the thin or the thick type of epithelium (see also Immunocytochemistry). As described before,
almost the entire nasal cavity is lined with olfactory epithelium [19]. A few areas contain only nonsensory epithelium, mainly limited to the most ventral portion of the
cavity and small ventral areas of the turbinates. These cells
can be easily distinguished from the OSNs that have
larger, more deeply placed nuclei. The vestibule (Fig. 1B),
the duct leading from the naris opening down to the nasal
cavity proper, is lined with short, flattened epithelial cells
similar to those of the adjacent skin. OSNs are not present
in the vestibule.
Olfactory sensory neurons
The description of the ultrastructure of the OSNs follows
the criteria commonly used for olfactory epithelium. As
mentioned above, receptor cells are categorized macroscopically by their height within the epithelium. At the
ultrastructural level, cell organelles are used to categorize

supporting cells are the most prominent (Fig. 3A). Their
nuclei lie above the level of nuclei of OSNs. Abundant
clear vesicles ca. 0.6 to 1.0 µm in diameter, fill the area

two) are present in the upper portion of the cell which is
devoid of vesicles (not shown). At the surface bordering

2.8 to 4.1 µm. This is only a rough estimate since these
cells often envelop the OSNs. Consequently, at the

surface of the supporting cells is covered with numerous
microvilli, about 4 to 5 µm long and 0.08 to 0.17 µm wide
(Figs. 3B, 4C, 5A–C). OSNs are dispersed between the
supporting cells (Figs. 3, 4A, 5C,D); the width of their apical dendrites (1 to 1.4 µm) is even smaller than the upper
portion of the supporting cells. As seen in the scanning
electron microscope (SEM), the pronounced olfactory
knob bears about 6 to 7 cilia (10 to 15 µm long, approx.
0.3 µm wide) that do not taper at their end. In addition,
the olfactory knobs bear several thin microvilli (about 1
µm long), and thus shorter and smaller than those of the
supporting cells (Figs. 3B–D, 4A). Some TEM sections suggest the presence of OSNs with only microvilli. However,
serial sections reveal that this is misleading (Figs. 3C, 4A),
since the original plane of section may not include all of
the cilia. All OSNs seen in serial ultrathin sections were socalled mixed receptor cells (bearing both cilia and microvilli) as described for birds by Graziadei [37]. Neverthe-

of OSNs do exist. The distribution of these two types of
OSNs within the nasal cavity has no obvious pattern. The

their olfactory knobs, their dendrites show different features. Type I OSNs are relatively electron-lucent and contain small vesicles (70–100 nm) and few microtubules. A
few mitochondria are arranged longitudinally (Fig. 3B).
Beneath the olfactory knob – often even deep in the dendrite – several centrioles are present (Fig. 4A), a feature
that never occurred in the second OSN type. The cytoplasm of the type II OSN is electron-dense and filled with
abundant mitochondria that sometimes reach into the
olfactory knob. Their cytoplasm is electron-dense (Fig.

Compared to the olfactory epithelium of other groups of
animals, the OSNs in the alligator's olfactory epithelium
are rather scarce. In alligators, the density of OSNs varies
in the different zones of the olfactory epithelium. The
highest density occurs on the turbinates [4.6 (+/- 0.34 SE)
apical knobs of OSNs per 25 µm length of epithelium, as
assessed in ultrathin sections]. By way of comparison:
goldfish or mouse olfactory epithelia contain approx. 8 –
10 OSNs per 25 µm length of olfactory epithelium in
ultrathin sections (A.H., personal observation). Towards
the rostral end of the nasal cavity of alligators, the density
declines with the lowest numbers close to the vestibule
[1.5 (+/- 0.22 SE) OSNs per 25 µm length of epithelium]
(Fig. 6). ANOVA/Tukey tests of these cell countings
revealed that zones 1, 2, and 3 were significantly different
from zones 4 and 5. The difference between zone 4 and 5
was not significant (df between groups = 4, total = 87, F =
22.029, p < 0.05).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/64

cells are of mucous character (compare [19]) containing
dark, electron-dense vesicles of various sizes. This part of
the epithelium is loosely-packed and the wide interstitium is filled with dense extracellular matrix (Fig. 4E).
The antisera that worked in the alligator tissue corroborated the results obtained at the electron microscopic
level.
(1) PGP9.5 showed labelled OSNs throughout the nasal
cavity (Fig. 7A–B). The highest density of labelled cells
was present in the turbinate areas (Fig. 7B), a lesser
amount in the more anterior areas (Fig. 7A). Evidently,
the height of the nasal epithelium did not correlate with
sensory versus non sensory areas. PGP-positive OSNs
occurred in areas with thick as well as in areas with thin

Beneath the layer of OSNs a layer of basal cells occurs.
Basal cells rest on the basal lamina, their shape often following the curves of the basal lamina (Fig. 4B). Within the
olfactory epithelium a few cells occur that contain cell
debris enveloped in large vesicles (Fig. 4D). The nature of
these presumably phagocytotic cells is unknown.
Strictly non-olfactory areas of epithelium are confined to
the most ventral areas of the nasal cavity and small areas
in the folding of the turbinates. These non-olfactory areas
are mostly lined with columnar epithelial cells. They bear
either tiny microvillous-like protrusions (Fig. 4E) or
numerous cilia (Fig. 5E) which unlike cilia present on sensory neurons have pronounced rootlets extending into the
cell (arrowheads Fig. 4D). Some of the microvilli-bearing

cells). C In the most ventral nonsensory portion of zone 3 no
labelled cells occur. The apical fringe of nonsensory cilia is

epithelium. In nonsensory areas, PGP9.5 unspecific label
was present in the nonsensory kinocilia (Fig. 7C). Occasionally, an apical ending that appeared to be domeshaped showed PGP9.5-label (Fig. 7B). These cells may be
SCCs (see below).
(2) Gαolf, a marker for the canonical transduction cascade
in olfaction, was present in the apical endings of OSNs
(Fig. 8A–B). The label occurred throughout the nasal cavity proving the presence of OSNs in wide areas of the nasal
epithelium. The degree of label, however, varied from area
to area with the strongest label in the turbinate areas (Fig.
8A) and the weakest label in the anterior areas of the cavity (Fig. 8B) corresponding to PGP 9.5 results showing
fewer OSNs in the anterior areas (Fig. 7A). Also as seen in
PGP 9.5 experiments, Gαolf occurred both in thick and in
thin epithelia.
(3) YOL 1/34 tubulin (a marker for microtubules) immunoreaction is present in cilia (Fig. 8C) and in fibres coursing below the olfactory epithelium but no positive fibres
are seen beneath the nonsensory areas.
Solitary chemosensory cells

cilia in zone 3 (between the anterior turbinate and the anterior nasal cavity). D Substance P-positive fibers are present
beneath the olfactory epithelium in zone 1 (most anterior

they may innervate SCCs.

These cells are scarce but stand out in SEM and TEM preparations (Figs. 4C, 5F). Their apical ending is domeshaped. Supporting cells seem to indent into the upper
part of the cell resulting in a "neck" of the presumed SCCs
(Fig. 4C). The dome is filled with dense cytoplasm and
few tiny vesicles (approx. 0.02 – 0.05 µm). The area below
the "neck" on the other hand contains abundant slightly
larger vesicles (approx. 0.07 – 0.2 µm).
Immunocytochemical results (synapses in the lower portion of the epithelium, PLCβ2 in apical endings) corroborate the notion that these cells are, indeed, SCCs.
(1) PLCβ2, a marker for the transduction pathway of SCCs
and some OSNs [28,38], labels few apical endings which
at the light microscopic level appear to be dome-shaped
(Fig. 7E–F).
(2) Substance P labels nerve fibres under the nasal epithelium. Some of the fibres reach into the olfactory and into
the nonsensory epithelium (Fig. 8D). Other Substance Ppositive fibres are present in the close vicinity of the
glands.

Discussion
The present study is the first to utilize electron-microscopic and immunocytological methods on the olfactory
epithelium of a crocodilian species. The findings show
that almost the entire nasal cavity is lined with olfactory
(= sensory) epithelium, but the density of the olfactory
receptor neurons (OSNs) varies along the nasal cavity.
Two different types of ciliated OSN exist that vary in cell
organelles and electron-density. The nasal cavity contains
not only olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), but also
receptor cells of a second chemosensory system: the solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) which connect to peripheral fibres of the trigeminal nerve.
Early studies on crocodilians focused on the macroscopic
morphology of the head and described the nasal cavity
only briefly and mostly in terms of head morphology (for
a more complete literature list on head morphology see
[17]. Saint Girons [19] investigated the nasal cavities of
Crocodylus niloticus and Caiman crocodilus with histological
methods.
Olfactory sensory neurons
The present study of the American alligator confirms Saint
Girons' [19] findings insofar as almost the entire nasal
cavity is lined with olfactory (= sensory) epithelium.
However, the density of OSNs is heterogeneous along the
nasal cavity of the American alligator. The highest numbers of OSNs occur in the zones of the two turbinates and
the lowest numbers close to the naris. Saint Girons' [19]
cell countings in histologically stained sections rendered a
proportion of 61% OSNs for Crocodylus and 59% of OSNs

for Caiman. These results are very different from what I
counted in electron microscopic experiments: In the alligator, the proportion of OSNs versus supporting cells is
reversed compared to Saint Girons' countings [19]: the
olfactory epithelium contains many more supporting cells
than OSNs – even in the turbinate zones where the OSNs
have the highest density (Fig. 6). The difficulties in counting supporting cells cannot account for this considerable
difference. This could be species-dependent but it is more
likely due to the very different techniques. Saint Girons
[19] counted nuclei in histologically stained thick sections
which is tedious but not very reliable due to the poor resolution and thus difficulties in distinguishing cell types,
whereas in the present study cells were counted at the
ultrastructural level.
Since alligators hunt above and under water and given the
fact that they possess only one nasal compartment the
question arises how are volatile and/or water-soluble
chemicals detected? A study on the semi-aquatic newt
Triturus pyrrhogaster reported a change of morphology and
physiological properties of the OSNs depending on the
environment. In a terrestrial environment the cilia of the
OSNs grew longer than when they were in aquatic surroundings. Slow potentials evoked in the olfactory epithelium changed from responding to odorous fluids in an
aqueous medium to responding to odorous vapours in a
terrestrial environment [16]. Interestingly, two types of
OSNs are present in the olfactory epithelium of the American alligator. Both types bear cilia that do not taper at
their ends as seen in rodents. Other than that, the two
types of ciliated OSNs show different morphological features that are commonly used to describe OSNs (number
of mitochondria, presence/absence of centrioles, electron
density of cytoplasm [35]) so that type I and type II OSNs
are easily distinguished at the ultrastructural level. This
has not been reported for birds (the second group of the
Sauropsida) or other reptiles. What the two different types
of OSNs mean in terms of function is yet unknown, but it
is tempting to speculate that one type of OSN may be utilized above water for air-borne stimuli while the other is
used under water. The results described in this study were
collected from juvenile specimens. It remains to be shown
whether the findings also apply to fully mature alligators.
Immunocytochemical experiments were hampered by the
fact that most of the antisera made for rodents do not
work in alligators. Nevertheless, it was possible to show
that, as seen in fish and mammals, the OSNs in alligators
express Gαolf, the most common G-protein subunit in
olfactory transduction [3,6,7]. The neuronal marker
PGP9.5 confirmed the presence of OSNs in various areas.
This was especially helpful since it corroborated on a
larger scale what ultrastructural experiments had shown:
(a) that the density of OSNs varies from the anterior end

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/64

of the snout to the turbinates, and (b) that the height of
the epithelium is not correlated to the presence/absence
of OSNs. They occur in thicker as well as in thinner areas
of epithelium. These two features were also evident in
experiments with the YOL 1/34 antibody, a marker for
tubulin in cilia, and Gαolf.
Solitary chemosensory cells
Another interesting feature of the alligator's nasal epithelium is the presence of SCCs. These chemoreceptor cells
had been known for fish and amphibians [24,25]. They
occur in the skin of the body of fish, in the oral cavity and
on the gills [26,39]. In the alligator, SCCs are integrated
into the olfactory epithelium, a feature that up to now has
been reported only for the goldfish olfactory epithelium
[40]. With some exceptions, their function is not well
understood. Recently, SCCs were also described for
rodents [28]. In this case, the SCCs are located in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity. In rodents, the
SCCs express components of the T2R transduction cascade including gustducin and PLCβ2. Electrophysiological and behavioural experiments led to the conclusion
that SCCs in rodents serve as "sentinels" in the anterior
nasal cavity guarding against potentially harmful or irritant chemicals. SCCs also occur in guinea pigs [41] and
cows [30]. In alligators, dome-shaped apical endings were
labelled with PLCβ2 as are nasal SCCs in rodents. In addition, Substance P-positive fibres were present in and
under the nasal epithelium of the alligator indicating
innervation of the SCCs by trigeminal nerve fibres as seen
in rodents. The presence of SCCs in alligators as well as in
hagfish [23], elasmobranchs, teleost fish [25], amphibians [24,42], rodents [28], large mammals [30], and
humans [31] support the notion that SCCs are an evolutionarily conserved trait having evolved early in vertebrate
phylogeny.

Conclusion
Two different chemosensory systems are incorporated in
the olfactory epithelium: olfactory sensory neurons
proper and solitary chemosensory cells comprised of secondary sensory cells innervated by the trigeminal nerve.
Almost the entire nasal cavity of the American alligator is
lined with olfactory (sensory) epithelium. Two morphologically distinct types of ciliated OSNs are present.
Although both types bear cilia as well as microvilli on
their olfactory knobs, they differ in electron density and
cell organelles. The density of OSNs varies with the lowest
numbers close to the nares and the highest numbers on
the turbinates. OSNs as well as SCCs in alligators express
members of the transduction cascade seen in rodents. The
occurrence of SCCs in the alligator suggests phylogenetic
continuity of this cell type throughout the vertebrates.

Methods
Animals
Three juvenile alligator heads (Fig. 1A) fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (kindly provided by Dres. Catherine Carr
and Daphne Soares, University of Maryland) were split at
the midline by means of a fretsaw (Fig. 1B). The complete
nasal sacs were dissected out and divided into 5 zones for
further processing (Fig. 1C). Two animals were used for
transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, the third animal for scanning electron microscopy
and immunocytochemistry.
Light microscopy
For an overview at the light microscopic level, cryosections (16 µm) were treated with the histological staining
Kernechtrot-Lichtgrün-Orange (KLO) (0.1% nuclear red –
C.I. 60760, Merck, Darmstadt – in 5% aluminium sulphate followed by 0.2% light green – C.I. 42095, Allied
Chemical Corp., New York, 1% orange G – C.I. 16230,
Allied Chemical Corp., New York – and 0.5% phosphotungstic acid in 1% acidic acid) [33]. Briefly, the slides
were washed in dH2O, immersed in a mixture of nuclear
red in aluminium sulphate for 10 min, washed in dH2O,
and immersed in a mixture of light green and orange G in
phosphotungstic acid for 1 – 2 min. After the staining
process, the slides were dehydrated in ethanol and xylene.
Epon-Araldite-embedded pieces of tissue were cut at 1 µm
and stained with 1% toluidin blue (J. T. Baker Chemical
Co., Phillipsburg).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
Pieces of tissue of all 5 zones of the nasal cavity were postfixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.2). After rinsing in phosphate buffer, the specimens
were dehydrated in a graded series of acetone and isoamyl
acetate, critical-point-dried in CO2, coated with gold, and
examined with a LEO 1525 scanning electron microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Pieces of tissue of all 5 zones of the nasal cavity were postfixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.2) for several hours. After rinsing in phosphate
buffer, the tissue samples were postfixed with 1% osmium
tetroxide for 2 h. The fixed specimens were dehydrated in
a graded series of ethanol and acetone and embedded in
Epon-Araldite (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield,
PA). Ultrathin sections (silver to gold) were stained with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a FEI
Tecnai G2 electron microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands).
Cell counting
Epithelia of all 5 zones were photographed in the transmission electron microscope and printed at a magnifica-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/8/64

tion of 4000×, the lowest magnification where it was
possible to unequivocally distinguish cell types. Photos of
each zone were taken in a single session to ensure that the
epithelia were captured only once. Thus, double counting
of cells was prevented. On these photos, the apical portion of the epithelium was divided into sections (87 in
total) each representing 25 µm of actual tissue. Only
OSNs that reached the apical surface were counted. The
investigator was blinded as to location of the sample at
the time each was counted. Statistical analysis (ANOVA,
Tukey test) was done with the program SPSS 15.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago).
Immunocytochemistry
Antisera directed against various markers for OSNs and
SCCs were used to test their effectiveness in alligator tissue. These experiments were hindered by the fact that
most antisera directed against mammalian proteins did
not work in alligators (e.g. NCAM, gustducin, CGRP, HuC, calbindin, calretinin, RMRF, OMP, Gαo). Consequently, it is not possible to tell whether these proteins are
present or not by this method. A further difficulty was the
high autofluorescence of the tissue. All antisera were used
with fluorescence-coupled and biotinylated secondary
antibodies. Best results were obtained with antigen
retrieval, extensive blocking of endogenous peroxidase
and biotinylated secondary antibodies. 16 µm cryosections were processed according to standard methods.
Briefly, the sections were subjected to either acidic (30
min in 10 mM citric acid, pH 3.0, at 37 degrees C) or basic
(30 min in 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 8.0, at 80 degrees C)
antigen retrieval. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2), the sections were left in blocking solution [1% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal
horse serum (NHS), 0.3% Triton X-100] for 2 – 3 hours.
Incubation with the primary antisera diluted in blocking
solution containing 2% NHS lasted overnight to 3 days.
After three washes in PBS, fluorescence-coupled secondary antibodies were used to visualize the antibody labelling. As the autofluorescence of the tissue was usually very
high, more immunocytochemical experiments were carried out with biotinylated secondary antibodies. In that
case, endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 0.3%
H2O2 for 30 min. After 3 × 15 min washes in PBS, the
blocking solution was applied as described above. Then

the slides were incubated in avidin (Blocking Kit, Vector
Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 15 min, rinsed
briefly and incubated in biotin (Blocking Kit, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 15 min. The slides
were left in the primary antisera overnight and reacted
with the ABC/DAB method according to standard protocols. As a control, various steps (primary antibody, secondary antibody, ABC, DAB) were omitted. The antisera
that immunolabeled alligator tissue were: rabbit Protein
