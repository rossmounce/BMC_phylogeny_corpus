Abstract
Background: Efficient natural transformation in Neisseria requires the presence of short DNA
uptake sequences (DUSs). Doubts remain whether DUSs propagate by pure selfish molecular drive
or are selected for 'safe sex' among conspecifics.
Results: Six neisserial genomes were aligned to identify gene conversion fragments, DUS
distribution, spacing, and conservation. We found a strong link between recombination and DUS:
DUS spacing matches the size of conversion fragments; genomes with shorter conversion
fragments have more DUSs and more conserved DUSs; and conversion fragments are enriched in
DUSs. Many recent and singly occurring DUSs exhibit too high divergence with homologous
sequences in other genomes to have arisen by point mutation, suggesting their appearance by
recombination. DUSs are over-represented in the core genome, under-represented in regions
under diversification, and absent in both recently acquired genes and recently lost core genes. This
suggests that DUSs are implicated in genome stability rather than in generating adaptive variation.
DUS elements are most frequent in the permissive locations of the core genome but are
themselves highly conserved, undergoing mutation selection balance and/or molecular drive.
Similar preliminary results were found for the functionally analogous uptake signal sequence in
Pasteurellaceae.
Conclusion: As do many other pathogens, Neisseria and Pasteurellaceae have hyperdynamic
genomes that generate deleterious mutations by intrachromosomal recombination and by transient
hypermutation. The results presented here suggest that transformation in Neisseria and
Pasteurellaceae allows them to counteract the deleterious effects of genome instability in the core
genome. Thus, rather than promoting hypervariation, bacterial sex could be regenerative.

Background

The act of combining genetic information from two different
individuals is ubiquitous among living organisms. Genetic
exchange can take the form of sexual reproduction in some
eukaryotes, whereas in most prokaryotes it is the result of
horizontal transfer of DNA from a donor to a recipient cell.
Horizontal transfer may result in the introduction of new and
radically different genetic information or in the allelic
replacement of existing genetic loci by homologous recombination. Among the three mechanisms that facilitate horizontal gene transfer (HGT), natural transformation is often
referred to as the bacterial equivalent of meiotic sex in
eukaryotes. This is because it re-assorts genetic information
among members of the same species and, contrary to transduction and conjugation, is a process under the direct control
of the recipient cell [1]. Because maintenance of the capacity
for transformation is strictly dependent on its having positive
effects on the fitness of the recipient bacteria, it might be
regarded as the mechanism of choice for elucidating the
advantages of sex in prokaryotes.
Many bacterial species are naturally competent for transformation, some constitutively so, whereas others are competent
in response to specific environmental conditions [2]. Naturally competent bacteria have evolved mechanisms or strategies to avoid entry of heterologous and potentially harmful
DNA [3]. Similar to reproductive barriers that exist between
eukaryotic species, a preference for homologous DNA over
heterologous DNA is evident in a range of competent species
through adaptations including induction of competence by
quorum sensing, presence of restriction modification systems, and blockage of heterologous recombination by stringent RecA function or mismatch repair [4].
Transformation in Neisseria spp. and members of the family
Pasteurellaceae requires the presence of a specific DNA
uptake sequence (DUS) [5] or uptake signal sequence (USS)
[6,7], respectively, in the incoming DNA. These signals allow
discrimination between DNA from closely related strains or
species and foreign/unrelated DNA. The DUS of Neisseria
spp. is a short signal extending 10 nucleotides: 5'-GCCGTCTGAA-3' [8]. It is present in approximately 2,000 copies occupying 1% of the sequenced neisserial genomes, which is much
more than expected given the sizes of the genomes and their
composition, and can only be maintained by strong counteraction to drift [9,10]. The efficacy of transformation is higher
if the 10-mer DUS is preceded by an A and a T [11]. The 10nucleotide signal is required and sufficient for transformation
[11] and is the one considered in this study. However, because
75% of 10-nucleotide DUSs also are also extended 12-nucleotide DUSs, this should not affect our conclusions. DUSs
often appear as closely spaced inverted repeats that function
as rho-independent transcription terminators [11-13]. This
local arrangement of inverted repeats does not lead to a
change in the efficacy of transformation, which only depends
on the presence of a single DUS [11].

Transformation has traditionally been studied and conceptualized as a succession of distinct stages: surface binding/entry
through an outer membrane pore, transit across the periplasm and the inner membrane, and genome integration.
However, recent studies have demonstrated that these processes, at least in Bacillus subtilis, are tightly linked in both
space and time [14] and the term 'transformation complex'
has been coined. DNA has, per definition, been taken up when
it is no longer degradable by DNase, but more research is
needed to appreciate fully the physical implications of the
DNase protected state and exactly where DUS specificity acts.
Two major theories have been proposed to account for the
origin and maintenance of DUS signals. Classically, DUSs
have been regarded as cellular guardians that prevent the
entry of potentially damaging non-DUS containing
sequences, such as naked DNA from phages, plasmids, or
transposable elements. Indeed, DUS specificity effectively
disfavors DNA originating from distantly related species
because these lack DUSs. It has also been suggested that
DUS-specific transformation may lead to molecular drive [9].
If the DNA uptake machinery by some physical means has a
preference for DUSs, then sequences containing a DUS are
more likely to be transferred and, consequently, effectively
accumulate in the genomes of Neisseria. At the extreme end
of this concept, it has been suggested that DUSs increase in
frequency purely because of molecular drive, independently
of any putative positive effect on fitness (selfish DUS hypothesis) [15,16].
Molecular drive is a model of evolution that provides an
explanation alternative to natural selection and is based on
purely stochastic preferential uptake of DUS-containing
DNA. Preferential DNA uptake is a biologic mechanism and
should not be confused with molecular drive, which is a
model of evolution and might be one of its consequences. The
mechanism of preferential DNA uptake may also be involved
in DUS/USS fixation by classic natural selection driven by the
advantage of taking up conspecific DUS-containing DNA or
preventing the entry of alien sequences. The darwinian model
generally seeks the potential selective advantages of sex and
particularly 'safe sex', whereas the molecular drive model
seeks to explain how these genomes can tolerate such large
amounts of an 'intrusive' repetitive sequence without discretion, and in essence how DUSs/USSs can accumulate without
being positively selected for by forces affecting the fitness of
the organism.
Competent bacteria have invested extensively in complex
machineries to facilitate transformation, involving a comprehensive range of competence and recombination proteins
[17]. Neisseria spp. express type IV pili that are required for
transformation [18]. Furthermore, a type IV secretion system
that exports DNA into the environment has been described in
most gonococci and some strains of meningococci [19,20].
Thus, neisserial sex is an active process mediated by specific

machineries that can import and export genetic information.
Competence for transformation in Neisseria is constitutive
throughout its growth cycle and does not depend on environmental conditions [21]. Studies of population structures,
which in nature may range from complete clonality to panmixia, have shown that transformation in the pathogenic
Neisseria has fuelled high rates of recombination [22]. It has
been estimated that an allele of the Neisseria meningitidis
genome is ten times more likely to change by recombination
than by point mutation [23].
The reasons for such an intense recombination rate have
often been associated with the lifestyle of Neisseria spp. and
in particular with virulence in humans. Members of the genus
Neisseria and the family Pasteurellaceae populate the
mucosal surfaces of humans and animals. Of particular clinical significance are N. meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, which are leading causes of bacterial meningitis and
septicemia worldwide [24], and Neisseria gonorrhoeae,
which causes the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea
[25]. The commensal Neisseria lactamica is commonly found
in the upper respiratory tract of young children and teenagers
and may contribute to immunity to meningococcal disease
[26]. Analyses of the four published neisserial genomes
revealed high densities of repeated elements [27-30]. Intrachromosomal recombination between these repeats is a major
source of variability in Neisseria, resulting in frequent adaptive changes in gene expression profiles [31,32] and even reoccurring states of hypermutability [33,34].
Given the role of HGT in genome fluidity, elucidation of the
evolutionary role of natural transformation is pivotal to our
understanding of prokaryotic adaptation. The abundant DUS
and USS elements are required for efficient natural transformation in Neisseria and Pasteurellaceae members, respectively. If these repeat sequences are markers of selection for
transformation, as commonly believed, then their differential
presence and conservation across a genome may also contribute to our understanding of the advantages of sex, which is a
longstanding question in evolutionary biology [35,36]. Here,
we used the potential provided by the availability of six complete neisserial genomes to align globally the core genome
and to define the sets of genes that are ubiquitous and those
that were recently acquired or recently lost in each group.
These multiple genome alignments warrant a new and powerful approach to address the puzzle of the origin and fate of
DUSs in these genomes and the association between these
signals and recombination events. In this work we use the
term 'recombination' for the process of homologous recombination between the chromosome and DNA from other cells. A
striking correlation between the average distance between
DUSs and the length of conversion fragments was found,
which indicates that the process of transformation is tightly
linked to and even shaped by recombination. The presence of
unique DUSs that interrupt otherwise conserved regions in
neisserial alignments further emphasizes the role of recombi-

nation in DUS evolution. Within the limits of available data,
we find similar results when analyzing the genome of H. influenzae. The findings presented here enhance the influence of
allelic replacement as the bacterial equivalent of sex and the
role of transformation in genome maintenance.

Results
Global genome alignments
We conducted two types of multiple alignments of the
genomes of N. meningitidis Z2491 (serogroup A), MC58
(serogroup B), FAM18 and 8013 (serogroup C), N. gonorrhoeae FA1090, and N. lactamica ST-640 (see Materials and
methods, below). First, the genes with orthologs in all of the
six neisserial genomes were identified, translated, aligned
with MUSCLE [37], and then back-translated to the original
DNA sequence. These alignments are highly accurate at these
phylogenetic distances [38] and were used to fine tune the
parameters of the multiple genome comparison and alignment tool M-GCAT [39]. Second, we constructed a global
multiple alignment of the six genomes (Figure 1) using MGCAT. All but one M-GCAT cluster (collinear aligned region)
yielded a high alignment score. Removing this region from
the multiple alignments did not change the results. The
sequences were highly similar, with an average protein similarity between orthologs of N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae of about 97%, between N. meningitidis and N.
lactamica of about 94%, and between N. meningitidis strains
of more than 98.7%.
Despite this phylogenetic proximity, several rearrangements
have accumulated after the divergence of these genomes [30].
This is a consequence of the high numbers of repeats that
these genomes contain and requires the use of a multiple
alignment method that handles rearrangements and duplications, such as M-GCAT. The global multiple alignment was
composed of 79 co-linear regions, with breakpoints induced
by the chromosomal rearrangements, and covered approximately 82.5% of each genome (Additional data file 1). Within
these common regions there was a high percentage of monomorphic sites, and, overall, the multiple alignment contained
homologous regions with high sequence identity present in all
of the neisserial genomes. We also conducted a global alignment of four H. influenzae genomes that resulted in 53 co-linear alignment regions (Additional data file 6). The genomes of
the other members of the Pasteurellaceae could not be globally aligned because of the relatively large phylogenetic distances involved. Because the multiple genome alignment in
this clade only includes four closely related strains of a single
species, the range of analysis that could be made was much
more limited.

The distribution of neisserial DUS corresponds to the
length of conversion fragments
Because DUSs are required for transformation, a nonrandom
positioning or conservation of this repeat (also USS) could

pinpoint distinct effects on recombination and thus shed
some light on the role(s) of bacterial sex. Within certain limits, a high local density of DUS is expected to increase the
probability of transfer of the corresponding chromosomal
region. A linear relationship between the affinity for DNA in
transformation and the frequency of DUSs on the segment
has indeed been demonstrated in a competitive assay [8].
However, only a single DUS is required for efficient transformation, and two very closely spaced motifs do not increase
the transformation efficiency [11]. The usual interpretation of
these results is that one DUS is enough for transformation,
but because DNA is sheared in the environment a higher density of DUS increases the probability that a given fragment
will contain a DUS and thus enter the cell and recombine. The
positive effect of DUS density in conversion will become
smaller with the increase in DUS density up to the point at
which the selective effect is too weak to counterbalance drift.

Selection for high DUS density will also depend on the size of
DNA fragments that are taken in by the cell. If fragments are
smaller for a species, then there should be compensatory
selection for higher DUS density. One would thus expect that
the limits of selection or molecular drive to increase DUS density were indicated by the distribution of sizes of conversion
fragments. If conversion fragments are large, then a high DUS
density would not be maintained. If, on the other hand, these
fragments are small, then DUSs could be more tightly packed
in the chromosome. If selection or molecular drive varies
along the chromosome, then DUSs should not be homogeneously distributed throughout the genome, and more recombining regions should contain more of these elements.
The genome sequencing projects for N. meningitidis were
designed to embody the highest possible diversity in the species; specifically, the strains were chosen to be at the largest

possible phylogenetic distance. This means that the phylogenetic tree of these genomes is expected to contain very short
internal branches. This inference challenge is aggravated by
the frequent recombination in the species, which also results
in small internal branches [40]. Therefore, before assessing
conversion fragments, we checked whether one could identify
a robust phylogeny of the core genes of Neisseria. Phylogenetic trees of the clade were independently constructed using
three partly overlapping datasets: the concatenate of all ubiquitous genes, the M-GCAT multiple genome alignment, and
the concatenate of aligned DUS-containing regions (see
Materials and methods, below). In all cases, highly robust and
topologically identical trees were obtained, showing that despite frequent recombination in Neisseria - one can identify a consensus phylogenetic tree that can be used as a reference guide for the detection of recombination events (Figure
2). The trees also showed that the average history, as traced
by the ubiquitous genes, the multiple genome alignment, and
the DUS-containing regions, is the same.
The M-GCAT multiple genome alignment was then searched
for gene conversion events using GENECONV [41]. GENECONV is a computer program that applies statistical tests to
identify the most likely candidates for gene conversion events
between sequences in an alignment (see Materials and methods, below). The analysis was first restricted to the meningococcal genomes because this clade is more sampled. In this
set, the average gene conversion fragment was 1,728 nucleotides long (Figure 3). Accounting for recombination in all of
the neisserial genomes, and not only in N. meningitidis,
reduced the size of the average conversion fragment to 1,127
nucleotides. The smaller size of the conversion fragments
when including the more distantly related genomes may
reflect the unavailability of longer segments of strict homology for homologous recombination or uptake of smaller
DNA segments by the outgroups. Lower similarity might also
bias GENECONV to detect smaller fragments preferentially.
Published analysis of multilocus sequence typing data has
yielded comparable results, namely that average neisserial
conversion fragments vary between 500 and 2,500 nucleotides in length [42]. This may be an underestimation of the
size of fragments when the density of conversion events is so
high that events between different pairs of genomes overlap.
If DUSs are associated with recombination, either by selection or molecular drive, then one would expect there to be a

not radically change this number (average distance between
DUS about 1,150 nucleotides), emphasizing the close concordance between conversion fragments and DUS distribution. When all neisserial genomes were analyzed, the distance
between cDUS decreased to 1,128 nucleotides because DUS
density is higher in N. lactamica (Table 1). This higher density of DUSs in N. lactamica is in remarkable agreement with
the conversion fragment data, which shows much shorter
conversion fragments in this species than in N. meningitidis
Z2491 (573 versus 1,734 nucleotides; P < 0.001, by Wilcoxon
test). This suggests that shorter conversion fragments might
lead to selection for higher density of DUSs. Taken together,
all these results show a remarkable similarity between the
average distance between cDUS (1,500 and 1,128 nucleotides
when accounting for meningococcal or all genomes, respectively) and the sizes of conversion fragments (1,728 and 1,127
nucleotides, respectively), highlighting the close association
between the two.

close association between their spacing and the sizes of conversion fragments. We then computed the distribution of the
distances between consecutive DUSs. To control for the selection of close inverted DUSs in transcription terminators, we
clustered pairs of DUS in each such element into a composite
DUS (cDUS). Regions containing a complementary DUS pair
separated by 21 nucleotides or less were regarded as a single
cDUS. Thus, the term cDUS stands for a single isolated DUS
or a pair of DUSs in close inverse configuration in a rho-independent terminator. The average inter-cDUS distance among
meningococci is approximately 1,500 nucleotides, which corresponds to the average size of conversion fragments (Additional data files 2 and 5). It should be noted that not
controlling for pairs of DUSs in transcription terminators did

The global multiple genome alignment allows the identification of DUSs located in regions that can be aligned, namely in
the core genome, and to study how they changed over time.
For this purpose, it suffices to identify the location of DUSs in
the alignment and analyze the corresponding sequence columns. Previous studies have shown that some very distant
orthologous genes maintain the presence of USSs in their
sequences, but without precisely studying the conservation of
the motif sequences [15]. In this study, the M-GCAT global
genome alignment allowed precise prediction of the evolution
of these elements in each of the aligned positions. DUSs were
found to be highly conserved; in fact, they were much more
conserved than the average conserved sequence (about 85%
identity), exhibiting on average 97% sequence identity. Additionally, 71% of the DUSs in the multiple alignments were
exactly conserved in all genomes. In the four N. meningitidis
genomes, which are most closely related, the number of
exactly conserved DUSs was greater than 90%.
We then analyzed the columns in the alignment corresponding to DUSs present in some genomes but not in all. We first
considered DUSs present in all except one genome. We found
many elements that contained a single mismatch with the
DUS consensus sequence (termed DUS-1), and very few cases
of complete deletion of the DUS (see Figure 4a for N. gonorrhoeae data). This finding might be compatible with the proposed theory that DUSs arose by point mutation, but it is also
compatible with simple mutation selection balance, in which
mutations resulting in DUS degeneracy are slightly deleterious and thus constitute rare polymorphisms. The second
most frequent nucleotide at each position of the 10-nucleotide DUS was then identified as the nucleotide exhibiting the
greatest transition frequency in the genome [38] (Figure 4c).
Naturally, this is also in agreement with both hypotheses,
namely DUS arising by point mutation and being in mutation
selection balance.

The table indicates the percentage of DNA uptake sequence (DUS) in genes, the percentage of DUSs in the M-GCAT multiple genome alignment,
the number of composite DUSs (cDUS), the total number of DUSs in the genome, and the number of motifs matching the DUS consensus except at
one position (DUS-1).

It might be argued that the frequency of DUS-1 elements suggests that if DUSs are positively selected, then selection is
very weak. However, it must be noted that there are 30 different DUS-1 sequences and only one DUS sequence. Under
mutation selection balance, the frequency of DUS/DUS-1 is
given by me 2N e s [43], where m is thus 1/30, Ne the effective
population size, and s the selection coefficient (the fractional
advantage of DUS over DUS-1). The effective population size
was estimated at 105 in N. meningitidis using the population
mutation rate (2Neμ) of 3 * 10-2, as consistently found by Jolley and coworkers [42], and the average wild-type mutation
rate (μ) of about 1.5 * 10-7, as found by Bucci and colleagues
[44]. The observed ratio DUS/DUS-1 of about 2.4 in the
aligned regions leads to a coefficient of selection of about 2 *
10-5. Usually, one considers that a mutation will tend to
escape drift if 2Nes is greater than 1. In this case, one obtains
an 2Nes of about 4, which is sufficiently large for purifying
selection to be effective and for DUSs to be under mutation
selection balance [43].

DUSs arise by recombination
We then investigated the role that recombination plays in
replacing mismatched DUSs with perfect ones and in creating
new DUSs in a particular location of the genome de novo.
First, we took all positions from the multiple alignment
(namely, from the core genome), where we did not find a DUS
in N. gonorrhoeae or in N. lactamica, but we did find one in
at least one strain of N. meningitidis. We then computed the
number of mismatches of the N. gonorrhoeae and N. lactamica sequences aligned with this DUS. If DUSs were created
only by point mutations, then we should observe only very
few elements with multiple mismatches, because at this low
level of divergence very few point mutations are expected to
accumulate in 10-nucleotide loci (Figure 4b). Alternatively,
DUSs may be created by recombination and stabilized by
mutation selection balance. In this case, the majority of DUS1 elements reflect mutation selection balance, in which selection favors DUSs but random mutations will constantly create
DUS-1 elements. The latter have low probability of fixation

but may remain in populations for some time as slightly deleterious polymorphisms. If this scenario is correct, then one
would expect to find some DUSs matching DUS-1 elements
(reflecting the balance), whereas other DUSs should match
sequences many mismatches away (reflecting origin by
recombination) and few DUSs matching sequences with
intermediary divergence. Indeed, the majority (>60%) of
these DUS aligned with either a DUS-1 or with totally unrelated sequences (for example, see Figure 5), frequently
matching a series of gaps in the other genomes. The large
number of N. meningitidis DUS facing sequences with no
similarity to DUSs in the genomes of the other species (Figure
4b) is demonstrative of frequent DUS acquisition by recombination in genomes, rather than exclusively (or at all) by point
mutation.
If DUSs are under mutation selection balance, and mutation
rates are the same in every genome, then genomes with more
DUSs result from stronger purifying selection on DUS (counter-selection of cells containing degenerated DUSs). If DUSs
are under molecular drive, then more frequent conversion
would lead to more DUSs. In both cases, DUSs should be
more conserved in such a genome (there should be fewer
DUS-1 elements for every DUS). This is because, as mentioned above, DUS-1 elements have been found not to
increase transformation rates relative to no DUSs at all [11].
The N. lactamica genome contained the highest number of
DUSs in the aligned regions and yet the lowest number of
DUS-1 elements (Table 1). We detected 308 DUSs in the conversion fragments identified in N. lactamica. This is significantly more than the 270 that were expected, given the size of
these regions and the DUS density in the multiple alignment
(P < 0.01, χ2 test). Thus, in the genome with the higher density of DUSs, these motifs are more conserved and we find the
smallest gene conversion fragments along with an over-representation of DUSs in the fragments. Collectively, this evidence points toward DUS integration in the genome by
recombination and subsequent selection to allow conspecific
natural transformation.

of DUSs. These predicted recently transferred genes with low
%G+C amounted to 5.6% of the Z2491 genome and 7.1% of
the MC58 genome, but they contained only 2% (38) and 2.6%
(51) of the total number of DUSs, respectively (P < 0.001, χ2
test). These horizontally transferred regions thus held significantly fewer DUSs as compared with the genome average,
suggesting that DUS-mediated transformation is not associated with gene flux, which may arise by other means such as
transduction.

measured in the N. lactamica sequences facing the N. meningitidis DUS, and
is similar when N. gonorrhoeae is used instead. (c) Weblogo [87] of the

DUSs do not promote genetic diversity in Neisseria
Because it is a widely held belief that the evolutionary role of
natural transformation is to generate diversity in genomes,
we were surprised to discover that predicted horizontally
transferred regions contain very few DUSs. Laterally acquired
genes of N. meningitidis Z2491 and MC58 were collected

The previous analysis was conducted in genes with peculiar
sequence composition, which typically represent horizontally
transferred genes from distant species. However, because
these sequences are often A+T rich [46], they might be
expected to lack the G+C-rich DUS sequences. Furthermore,
methods based on atypical sequence composition miss the
transfers from genomes of similar oligonucleotide composition. Therefore, we conducted a more rigorous and conservative analysis of transfer by using the presence and absence of
sequences within the six genome sequences. We first counted
the number of DUSs in the regions not aligned by M-GCAT (in
the regions containing genes that are not ubiquitous in the
clade). Because these genomes diverged recently and exhibit
few substitutions (average 85% identity in DNA sequences),
point mutations cannot account for the divergence of unaligned regions. These can thus be assumed to contain the horizontally transferred genes and the genes that were lost in
some, but not all, genomes. Only about 10% of the total DUSs
were located there, although they account for 17.5% of the
sequence (P < 0.001, binomial test).
The results described above suggest that selection for genetic
novelty is not associated with the selection for DUSs because
recent acquisitions under-represent these motifs. We thus
conducted a strict test to check whether DUSs are under-represented in both new laterally transferred sequences and in
the sequences that, although present in the ancestral genome,
were recently lost in an extant one. The N. meningitidis Z2491
genome was used as a reference and the 34 genes with more
than 100 codons that were absent in all other genomes were
analyzed (the length threshold was set to avoid the uncertainties associated with the annotation of small genes). Most of
these recently acquired genes have no known function, and
they are all devoid of DUS elements. The probability of finding no DUSs in such a large set of genes by stochastic effects
is very small (P < 0.001, χ2 test), both when controlling for the
number and for the length of these genes. In comparison, the
ubiquitous genes contain an average of 0.4 DUSs per gene.
We then identified the genes that were present in the N. meningitidis Z2491 and all other genomes except in the N. meningitidis MC58 genome. The 29 genes encountered were
present in the ancestral genome and recently lost in N. meningitidis MC58. These genes were also totally devoid of DUSs,
which is significantly different from the expected number
(P < 0.001, χ2 test). We found the same results when perform-

ing the same analysis using N. meningitidis MC58 genome as
a reference (data not shown). DUSs were completely absent
from very recently gained genes, suggesting that DUSs are of
minor importance in gene acquisition. Lost genes also lacked
DUSs, indicating that DUS absence may render a sequence
more prone to be lost than DUS-containing sequences.
Many genes in N. meningitidis are highly variable because
they are under selection for diversification. These genes may
belong to the core genome, but their expression or functional
pattern changes rapidly because of replication slippage
within short repeats contained in their coding or regulatory
sequences or because of homologous recombination with
homologous (pseudo) genes. Although it may not be simple to
identify these genes, they usually share one or both of the following characteristics: they correspond to contingency loci
[31], or they correspond to outer membrane or extracellular
proteins [47]. We therefore complemented a list of contingency loci in N. meningitidis [30] with genes having identifiable peptide signals using SignalP [48], which resulted in a
subset containing between 56 and 92 genes, depending on the
genome. We then identified DUSs in these genes and checked
whether they contained more or fewer DUSs than the average
gene in the genome when controlling for gene length. We con-

sistently found lower densities of DUSs in these genes than in
the average gene (Table 2). This is in agreement with our
prior analyses, suggesting that there is no evidence for the
association of selection for diversification with selection for
recombination by natural transformation.

DUSs and USSs are located in permissive regions of
their core genomes
DUSs were over-represented in the 79 co-linear regions common to all of the neisserial genomes. To analyze the exact
distribution of DUSs in the core genome, all DUSs along the
M-GCAT aligned regions were identified (Table 1). The analysis was then focused on DUSs by sampling 300-nucleotide
regions upstream and downstream of all DUSs in the MGCAT alignment. As a control, we conducted exactly the same
analysis for regions randomly selected from co-linear regions
from the multiple alignment that did not contain DUSs, in a
similar size sequence window. A preliminary analysis indicated that DUS-negative regions were less conserved than
DUS-containing regions, but more careful examination
showed that this was due to an undue effect of some large
indels. Indels appear in this analysis as highly divergent
regions, but the reasons for this are probably associated with
the above-mentioned lack of DUSs in gained and lost regions.

We therefore eliminated from our subsequent analysis the
gapped columns (Additional data file 3). As a result, the
sequence identity values reported were calculated only using
substitutions. The remaining alignments are expected to be a
more accurate representation of the core genome. On average, DUS-containing regions exhibited 15% divergence (85%
sequence identity; Figure 6). The DUS-negative regions
exhibited 13% divergence. Thus, DUS-containing regions are
about 15% more divergent. Because the majority of DUSs are
located in intergenic regions, and because these regions
evolve faster, this result might be expected even if there were
no DUSs. To control for the effect of high substitution rates in
intergenic regions, we assessed DUSs inside genes only and
compared them with random regions that were also centered
inside genes. Again, the DUS-proximal regions in genes were
found to be around 15% more divergent than DUS-negative
regions in genes (exhibited 87% and 89% sequence identity,
respectively). This shows that DUSs are located in slightly
more permissive regions within the conserved core genome,
even though DUSs themselves are highly conserved (Figure
6).

has maximal DUSp, and one very distant has a DUSp close to
zero (see Materials and methods, below, for details). We
exemplify the values taken by this measure with the histogram of DUSp in the genome of N. meningitidis Z2491 (Figure 7). This shows that very few positions in the genome are
sufficiently far away from DUSs to be almost unaffected by
their presence; for example, fewer than 1% of positions have a
DUSp lower than 0.05.

For a preliminary comparison, we conducted a similar analysis on the alignment of the four genomes of H. influenzae
(Additional data files 6 and 7). The results were indeed similar, showing that the USS-flanking regions were less conserved than USS-negative regions in genomes, and that USSs
themselves - like DUSs - are more conserved. Thus, DUSs and
USSs are associated with regions conserved in all genomes
and, within these regions, they are located in the parts that
were permissive to substitutions.

To quantify the association between the distribution of DUSs
and sequence conservation, we also computed the correlation
between DUSp and sequence identity. This analysis is somewhat delicate because most columns in the multiple alignment are strictly identical between all genomes, whereas the
remaining ones are bi-allelic (Additional data file 4). Thus, we
focused the analysis on calculating the average DUSp for all
nucleotides in N. meningitidis Z2491 (Figure 7) and classified
all aligned positions in N. meningitidis Z2491 as changed if
they differed from the consensus, or as not changed if they
agreed with the consensus. The average position in this
genome had a DUSp of 0.51 for changed sites and 0.49 for the
others. The difference is small, but it means that across the
aligned N. meningitidis Z2491 genome changed sites are on
average 40 nucleotides closer to DUSs than the others, and
the difference is highly significant (P < 0.001, analysis of variance). Thus, DUSs are associated with permissive regions
that exhibit higher sequence diversity, even though DUS
themselves are highly conserved.

Modeling the effect of DUS proximity
The previous analyses of core genes and diversifying genes
accounted for the presence of DUSs inside genes. However, a
DUS that is not intragenic but is contiguous to a gene may still
significantly affect the potential for uptake and recombination of that gene. This highlights the relevance of studying
complete aligned genomic data, relative to simple alignments
of orthologous genes. In order to analyze the effect of DUS
proximity on genes and conversion events, we have created a
measure termed DUS proximity (DUSp). DUSp accounts for
the distance of a nucleotide to the average of the closest
upstream and downstream DUSs, taking into account the distribution of sizes of the conversion fragments for each
genome. DUSp measures the potential effect of the closest
DUS on a neighboring nucleotide by facilitating DNA uptake
and thus recombination with exogenous DNA. If a position is
very close to a DUS, then the effect of DUSs on recombination
at that position will be high since most conversion fragments
that are taken in because of this DUS will be sufficiently large
to lead to recombination at that position. If a position is at a
distance from the closest DUS that is larger than the size of
the largest conversion fragment found with GENECONV,
then recombination at this position will not benefit from the
presence of DUSs. In short, a nucleotide contiguous to a DUS

We then checked whether positions in genes putatively under
selection for diversification had an average DUSp lower than
the rest. In N. meningitidis Z2491, DUSp in these genes averaged 0.39 versus 0.49 in the remaining genes (P < 0.001, ttest). In N. lactamica the results were similar, with average
DUSp values of 0.26 and 0.30, respectively (P < 0.001, t-test).
The DUSp values are lower overall in N. lactamica than in the
other genomes because of the smaller conversion fragments
and in spite of higher DUS density. The use of our DUSp index
confirms that selection for diversification in rapidly evolving
genes related to fitness and virulence is not associated with
selection for recombination by natural transformation.

Discussion

The use of multiple genome alignments facilitated elucidation
of the role played by DUSs in genome evolution in greater
detail than was possible in previous studies. We have thus
been able to show that DUSs are associated with
recombination hotspots (with regions of increased recombination rates). First, their spacing matches the length of conversion fragments. Second, the analysis of recently acquired
DUSs identifies many cases in which the motif region
matches homologous regions lacking any motif resembling a
DUS, which suggests insertion by recombination and not by
point mutation. Third, N. lactamica has smaller conversion
fragments and more tightly spaced DUSs, and these conver-

sion fragments over-represent DUSs. This association
between recombination and DUS distribution may be caused
by selection for recombination, by selfish molecular drive, or
by both.
Simple preliminary analysis of the degeneracy of DUSs allows
determination of coefficients of selection compatible with
DUSs being under mutation selection balance. An interesting

case is provided by the analysis of N. lactamica, which has a
higher DUS/DUS-1 ratio, suggesting that stronger selection
for DUSs results from smaller conversion fragments. This is
in accordance with the experimental observations that natural competence in N. lactamica is more specific (as opposed
to being genus specific) than competence in N. meningitidis
and N. gonorrhoeae, which exhibit only DUS dependency
irrespective of the source of DNA [49]. It is thus tempting to

most well documented incidences of HGT in Neisseria are the
result of illegitimate not homologous recombination
[51,57,58]. This does not mean that transformation never
leads to HGT (for example, some recently horizontally transferred elements flanked by DUSs have raised speculations
that they arose by natural transformation) [59,60].

speculate that more discriminating transformation and
smaller conversion segments cause selection or molecular
drive for a higher density of DUSs.
Because DUSs are markers of recombination resulting from
natural transformation, their role must be understood in the
light of the multiple theories for the evolution of transformation: sex for the acquisition of heterologous sequences
(horizontal transfer sensu strictu); sex to allow diversification
of quickly evolving functions (for example, virulence factors);
sex as a source of food; sex as a source of template for DNA
repair; or sex as a mechanism allowing allelic (homologous)
recombination to purge deleterious mutations and avoid
clonal interference [50-54]. Some of these hypotheses are difficult to distinguish from the point of view of DUS distribution and evolution. However, one can easily distinguish the
first two from the remaining ones because they lead to very
different expected distributions of DUS elements.
Horizontally transferred regions sensu strictu have very few
DUS elements, and recent insertions have no DUSs at all, suggesting that these sequences had no DUSs at the time of
transfer. In addition, we find that conversion fragments are
small, which should severely limit the extent of co-transfer of
heterologous sequences with DUSs. Therefore, our data are in
clear disagreement with the idea that the primary role of
transformation is to mediate the horizontal transfer of new
genetic information. Although it had been thought that transformation is the major vehicle of lateral transfer in Neisseria
[55], recent data show that extensive genetic variation originates from phages and other mobile elements [56,57]. In fact,

It has often been suggested that transformation allowed quick
diversification of genetic information involved in virulence.
However, here we find that even the core genes known to be
under selection for diversification contain fewer DUSs than
expected. This further argues against a role of DUSs and natural transformation in selection for genetic diversification,
either through horizontal transfer of new functions or
through variation in extant genes under selection for
diversification.
If the purpose of bacterial sex were to feed on DNA, then DUS
specificity would be clearly deleterious, because it prevents
most DNA from entering the cell. Even if a DUS were present
by chance, this would occur more frequently in G+C-rich
genomes (because DUSs are G+C rich), whereas the most
required nucleotide in cells is A because of the energetic
metabolism [61]. As a result, and because degeneracy in protein-DNA interactions is the norm, bacteria exhibiting lower
DUS specificity should arise and quickly out-compete DUSspecific Neisseria. It follows either that DUS specificity is
highly deleterious, and one might wonder why degeneracy
has not evolved, or that nutrient acquisition is not the main
purpose of sex in Neisseria. In light of the observed association between DUSs and recombination, the second hypothesis seems more plausible.
We show that DUS regions have the same average evolutionary history as the core genome. Nevertheless, DUSs are highly
conserved despite being located in regions slightly more
divergent than the average core genome. This data and the
link between DUSs and conversion fragments is thus consistent with the scenarios of sex for repair, for allelic re-assortment, or for DUS being selfish sequences under pure
molecular drive. Because recombination is mutagenic [62],
one would expect regions close to DUSs to be evolving quicker
than the average core genome, as observed. Because many
DUSs arise by recombination, one would also expect their
concentration to be higher in more plastic regions of the core
genome, as observed. Thus, in all three evolutionary scenarios one would expect DUSs to be highly conserved, but more
frequent in the permissive regions of the core genome, while
rare in the accessory genome.
Recent findings show that competence for natural transformation in Bacillus subtilis stops growth [63] and is associated
with the expression of proteins involved in recombination
and repair, and that these proteins co-localize with transformation proteins at the cellular poles [64,65]. This suggests a
strong link between transformation, recombination, and

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R60

repair. We previously showed that genome maintenance
genes are enriched in both DUS in Neisseria and USS in the
phylogenetically distant Pasteurellaceae, suggesting that
transformation mediates DNA repair and conservation rather
than diversification of lineages [10]. The over-representation
of DUSs and USSs in genome maintenance genes may reflect
selection for facilitated recovery of genome preserving functions and co-evolution between these processes and specific
transformation. Although DNA uptake increases upon UV
mutagenesis in B. subtilis [50], competence for transformation is not found to be regulated by DNA damage in B. subtilis, in H. influenzae [66,67], or in the constitutively
competent Neisseria spp. In fact, N. gonorrhoeae, and quite
possibly other Neisseria spp., is polyploid [68] and may use
another copy of the chromosome to repair DNA damage by
homologous recombination. It is therefore unclear to what
extent transformation alone plays a role in the repair of DNA
lesions.
Transformation allows the re-assortment of alleles in populations. In this sense, transformation can both reduce clonal
interference, the competition between adaptive mutations in
different clones, and efficiently purge deleterious mutations
[69]. We find that DUSs are missing in both ancient genes of
the neisserial clade that were recently lost in one genome and
in large gaps in the multiple alignments. This is in accordance
with transformation allowing the recovery of inactivated or
completely lost genes [10,70]. A DUS might not change the
probability of deletion of a gene, but once lost the presence of
DUSs in a gene increases the probability that it will be
restored by natural transformation. Sex by transformation in
Neisseria could thus have evolved to deal with the vast
amount of deleterious polymorphisms that result from the
mechanisms aiming at rapid sequence diversification, for
example for the evolution of virulence, such as intrachromosomal recombination and mutator periods. Repeats in Neisseria account for approximately 20% of the genome [29], and
some of them, such as Correia elements [71] and insertion
sequences [28], are highly dynamic. Interestingly, other pathogens that also generate variability through frequent intrachromosomal (homologous or illegitimate) recombination
and/or high mutation rates, such as H. influenzae [72,73] and
Helicobacter pylori [74], are also naturally competent bacteria. Furthermore, several transformable bacteria that do not
have sequence-specific transformation systems, such as B.
subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and H. pylori, have
other genetic or ecological mechanisms ensuring that natural
transformation is induced when the likelihood for uptake of
conspecific DNA is very high [75-78]. Indeed, our previous
and other analyses [10,16] suggested that patterns of DUS
and USS evolution are similar in Neisseria and Haemophilus.
In both cases one expects that variability generated by intrachromosomal recombination will lead to deleterious mutations that would quickly accumulate in lineages in the
absence of recombination, a phenomenon known as Muller's

ratchet. This would fit well with recombination having a role
in the maintenance of the core genome.
In order to elucidate the role of DUS-specific transformation,
it is vital to determine exactly how DUSs are created ex nihilo,
which is the mechanism of DUS specificity, and how intense
is the influence of molecular drive. We showed that DUSs
arise frequently in genomes and that the presence of DUSs is
associated with gene conversion events. However, originally
these DUSs must have been created by some mechanism.
Because the exact site of many new DUSs has sequences of
very weak similarity in the other genomes, point mutation is
an unlikely candidate for the origin of new DUSs in these populations. Neisseria both take up and export DNA; therefore,
harboring DUSs in a genome increases the probability for
DNA propagation (it increases the fitness of the genes in its
neighborhood). In this case selfish molecular drive would
most frequently be in accordance with the interest of the cell,
which is to filter out nonhomologous DNA and to select for
uptake sequences associated with the core genome. In this
sense, an understanding of how DUS specificity works will
allow an appreciation of its possible evolutionary flexibility as
well as its evolutionary history. Did the original system
require a perfect DUS sequence, which would severely restrict
the range of natural transformation? Alternatively, did DUS
specificity co-evolve with the increase in the density of DUSs
in genomes? In that case, did the positive feedback of molecular drive allowed faster evolution toward DUS stringent specificity? Both scenarios are plausible on theoretical grounds
[79] but have radically different consequences for the theories
aiming to explain the role of natural transformation. Our data
suggest that the role of DUS-mediated natural
transformation in virulence may not be the most commonly
invoked. Instead of providing novelty in genetic repertoires,
natural transformation may be a mechanism to tackle the side
effects of the vast generation of genetic hypervariability that
constantly takes place in neisserial genomes. Therefore, an
understanding of the evolutionary role of DUS-specific natural transformation may highlight how the bacteria face both
the needs for variability in its interaction with hosts and the
commitment to preserve the core genome.

Materials and methods
Genes and genome sequences
We analyzed the genome sequences of six Neisseria spp. and
four Haemophilus influenzae strains. Four of the neisserial
and all of the Pasteurellaceae genome sequences and their
annotations were obtained from GenBank Genomes: N. meningitidis Z2491, serogroup A (NC_003116) [27]; N. meningitidis MC58, serogroup B (NC_03112) [28]; N. meningitidis
FAM18 serogroup C (NC_03221) [30]; N. gonorrhoeae

data for N. lactamica ST-640 were produced by the Pathogen
Sequencing Unit at the Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK).
The sequence and annotation data for N. meningitidis 8013
serogroup C were provided by the unit 'Génomique des
microorganismes pathogènes' from Institut Pasteur (Paris,
France).

Definition of sets of orthologous genes
A preliminary set of orthologs was defined by identifying
unique pair-wise reciprocal best hits, with at least 40% similarity in protein sequence and less than 30% difference in
length. This list was then refined by combining the information on the distribution of similarity of these putative
orthologs and the data on gene order conservation (as in the
report by Rocha and coworkers [83]). Because few rearrangements are observed at these short evolutionary distances,
genes outside conserved blocks of synteny are likely to be
xenologs or paralogs. Hence, we conservatively used the distribution of sequence similarity within reciprocal best hits,
together with the classification of these genes as either syntenic or nonsyntenic, to set appropriate lower thresholds of
protein sequence similarity between orthologs. We considered two genes to be orthologs if their proteins were at least
85% similar. The definitive list of orthologs for each group
was defined as the intersection of pair-wise lists.

Correlation of predicted HGT regions and DUS
content
The six-genome analysis was preceded by mapping of DUS
content in predicted HGT regions in the N. meningitidis
Z2491 and MC58 genomes, as identified in HGT-DB. These
are regions with statistical parameters such as G+C content,
codon, and amino acid usage deviating from the genome average [45].

Multiple genome alignment
The M-GCAT genome comparison and alignment tool was
used to produce a multiple alignment of the six genome
sequences [39]. As output, M-GCAT returns the alignment
partitioned into locally co-linear regions or clusters, along
with a concatenated version of the multiple alignment that
joins all individually aligned co-linear regions. Aligning only
locally co-linear regions with strong evidence of homology
avoids forcefully aligning potentially nonhomologous
sequence. For our comparison, the M-GCAT parameters were
configured as follows: q = 100; d = 40000; c = 110; min
Anchor length = 0.8 * (Log [S]); min MUM length = 8. The
remaining parameters were left as default values. Different
values for these parameters will vary the final output. Accordingly, we optimized these values by maximizing the final
amount of matches found and percentage of sequence covered by the comparison framework. We used MUSCLE [37] to
align the unaligned regions in the M-GCAT comparison
framework and to produce the final gapped alignment. After
this step, all remaining unaligned regions are lineage specific
(they are not in the core genome) and are left unaligned for

further inspection. Gblocks [84] was used to calculate the
number and identify the regions of conserved blocks in the
multiple alignments.

Phylogenetic analyses
We conducted three separate phylogenetic analyses using
three different but partially overlapping datasets: the concatenate of the alignments of the ubiquitous genes; the concatenate of the M-GCAT multiple alignments; and the
concatenate of all 1,000 nucleotides regions (± 500 nucleotides on each side) surrounding each DUS present in all of the
genomes of the M-GCAT multiple alignment. All analyses
were conducted using Tree-Puzzle [85] to generate the matrix
of distances by maximum likelihood, with the HKY+Γ model
and exact parameter estimates. The trees were then computed using BIONJ [86].

Gene conversion analysis
To estimate the number and size of gene conversion events
between all pairs of these six sequences, we employed the
gene conversion detection tool GENECONV [41] on the MGCAT multiple alignments. The parameters were configured
as follows:/mig0.005/g2/dm -Outerseq = off. GENECONV
aims to find the most likely candidates for gene conversion
events between pairs of sequences in a DNA alignment. It
does so by looking for maximal aligned pairs of segments that
are unusually similar at a local level. We have also controlled
for invariable or highly selected sites by excluding monomorphic sites from the analysis. Candidate events were ranked by
multiple comparison corrected P values.

Definition of DUS proximity
The correlation of functional genomic features with DUS
presence is complicated by the over-representation of these
elements in intergenic regions. Thus, comparing the number
of DUSs present in genes neglects the fact that many genes
lacking DUSs may have one just after the stop codon. Because
we are interested in DUS proximity in relation to DUS-related
recombination, we used the distribution of conversion fragment sizes between genomes to compute the probability of a
nucleotide being affected by the presence of a neighboring
DUS from the point of view of gene conversion. Thus, for a
pair of genomes A and B, we compute the cumulative distribution of the sizes of gene conversion fragments given GENECONV (CD). A nucleotide at a distance X from the closest
DUS has a score 1 - CD(X), which represents the likelihood
that the position will be affected by presence of the closest
DUS in terms of engaging into a conversion fragment arising
from transformation. Nucleotides far from DUSs will have
very low scores, whereas nucleotides close to DUSs will have
scores close to 1. We tested some variants of this method,
notably by summing the score of the position for the closest
downstream and upstream DUSs and by taking the maxima
of the two. Both maxima and average approaches give
qualitatively comparable results. In the text we focus on the
average approach.

All searches for exact and degenerate DUSs in the genome
sequences and conserved in the multiple alignment were
found using a customized Python script (available upon
request). Additionally, the script was used to identify the
number of DUSs in coding sequences and calculate levels of
DUS degeneracy and percent identity surrounding DUS sites
in the alignment.
