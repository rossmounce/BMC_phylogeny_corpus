Abstract
Background: UnTranslated Regions (UTRs) of mRNAs contain regulatory elements for various
aspects of mRNA metabolism, such as mRNA localization, translation, and mRNA stability. Several
RNA stem-loop structures in UTRs have been experimentally identified, including the histone 3'
UTR stem-loop structure (HSL3) and iron response element (IRE). These stem-loop structures are
conserved among mammalian orthologs, and exist in a group of genes encoding proteins involved
in the same biological pathways. It is not known to what extent RNA structures like these exist in
all mammalian UTRs.
Results: In this paper we took a systematic approach, named GLEAN-UTR, to identify small stemloop RNA structure elements in UTRs that are conserved between human and mouse orthologs
and exist in multiple genes with common Gene Ontology terms. This approach resulted in 90
distinct RNA structure groups containing 748 structures, with HSL3 and IRE among the top hits
based on conservation of structure.
Conclusion: Our result indicates that there may exist many conserved stem-loop structures in
mammalian UTRs that are involved in coordinate post-transcriptional regulation of biological
pathways.

Background
RNA cis elements residing in the UnTranslated Regions
(UTRs) of mRNAs have been shown to play various roles
in post-transcriptional gene regulation, including mRNA
localization, translation, and mRNA stability [1-4]. The
function of a cis element can be attributable to its primary
sequence or structure. For simplicity, they are called
sequence elements and structure elements, respectively.
Well-known sequence elements include AU-rich elements

(ARE), which contain one or several tandem AUUUA
sequences and are involved in modulation of mRNA stability [5,6], and miRNA target sites, which base-pair with
their cognate miRNA molecules and are involved in the
regulation of translation or mRNA stability [7,8]. Wellcharacterized structure elements include Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) [9] and Iron Response Element
(IRE) [10] in the 5' UTR, Selenocysteine Insertion
Sequence (SECIS) [11], IRE, and histone 3' UTR stem-

loop structure (HSL3) [12] in the 3' UTR. Each element
type exists in multiple genes, and thus can be considered
as an RNA motif (similar to the concept of protein motif).
IRE and HSL3 elements are highly similar to one another
within each type; some divergence has been reported for
SECIS [11]; and there is no extensive similarity in primary
sequence or secondary structure among IRES elements [9].
These characteristics reflect the ways that the RNA structures function. In addition, various gene-specific structure
elements in 5' or 3'UTRs have been shown to play roles in
various aspects of RNA metabolism [1].
Functional RNA sequence elements in the human genome
have been heavily studied in recent years, including elements responsible for pre-mRNA splicing, polyadenylation, and miRNA target sites [13-17]. In contrast, RNA
structure elements have been investigated to a much lesser
extent, partly due to the difficulties in accurately predicting and aligning RNA structures, and assessing false discovery rate (FDR). Recent developments of genome-wide
prediction of RNA structures based on aligned genomes
[18,19] or unalignable regions [20] have resulted in large
numbers of conserved RNA structures. On one hand, all
methods reported high potential FDR. On the other hand,
these results vary from one another in coverage, indicating
that there may exist even more structures to be discovered.
Here, we took an approach that is not based on genome
alignments, dubbed GLEAN-UTR (grouping by structural
distanceand ontology for RNA elements in UTRs) to
uncover conserved RNA structures in UTRs. We focused
on small stem-loop structures. We compared folded RNA
structures in UTR sequences for orthologous genes by our
RNA structure alignment tool RSmatch [21]. Similar
orthologous structures were then compared in an allagainst-all fashion to derive RNA structure groups. Using
cluster analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) information, we
identified RNA structures that exist in multiple genes that
share common biological pathways. For 10,448 human
genes which were analyzed, we obtained 90 RNA structure
groups, containing 748 distinct RNA structures in 3' or 5'
UTRs from 698 genes. HSL3 and IRE are among the top
hits based on conservation of structure. Using a randomized data set, we estimated FDR of 15% for all the
structures. About 12% of the structures overlap genomic
regions identified by other whole-genome wide studies
for RNA structures. This bioinformatics study lays groundwork for future wet lab examination of putative conserved
RNA structure elements in human and mouse UTRs.

Results
Mining RNA structure elements in UTRs
We wanted to identify functional structure elements in
human UTRs. Previous studies have used aligned vertebrate genomes to predict conserved structures in the
whole genome [18,19]. However, a recent report indi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/189

cated that many human genome regions containing RNA
structures cannot be aligned with the mouse genome [20].
This suggests that reliance on genome alignments containing divergent species, such as human and fish, may result
in many false negatives. This situation can be exacerbated
for UTRs, which typically do not exhibit large rates of
sequence conservation. To explore approaches other than
using aligned genomes, we designed a method, named
GLEAN-UTR, which is based on the rationale that there
exist structure elements in 5' and 3' UTRs that are encoded
by a group of genes involved in the same biological pathways, similar to IRE and HSL3 structures (see Additional
file 1). We applied the method to human and mouse
UTRs. Figure 1 shows the overall design and procedure of
this method.
We first extracted UTR sequences from NCBI RefSeq
sequences. We then used a "slide and fold" method to
construct RNA structures in 5' and 3' UTRs (see Methods
for detail). With this method, subsequences in UTRs, 100
nucleotides (nt) long or less, were folded according to
thermodynamic properties using the Vienna RNA package
[22]. Adjacent subsequences were overlapped by 50 nt.
This method can derive RNA structures accurately and efficiently for two reasons: (1) Predicting small structures is
more accurate and efficient than for large ones; (2) Structures with size less than 50 nt were folded twice as subsequences of two different larger structures, further
increasing the chance of getting accurate RNA structures.
We also used the setting in the Vienna package that
yielded multiple RNA structures with the same minimum
energy for a given sequence to further improve the folding
accuracy. On the other hand, since we only obtained RNA
structures derived from 100 nt subsequences of UTRs, our
discovery was limited to small structures, such as short
stem-loops. Thus, large RNA structures, such as IRES and
SECIS, are not analyzed in this study. This step resulted in
575,410 RNA structures from human UTRs and 445,106
RNA structures from mouse UTRs.
We then compared RNA structures from human and
mouse orthologs (10,667 pairs in total). For each orthologous gene pair, we compared the set of RNA structures
from the human gene with the set of structures from the
mouse gene using RSmatch [21], which aligns RNA structures by taking into account both sequence and structure
information. Alignments with a positive score from
RSmatch were kept. In order to assess the significance of
the alignments, we focused on three values of a structure
alignment: size of the alignment, size of the doublestranded region of the alignment, and RSmatch score of
the alignment. The distributions of the values for all alignments are shown in Figure 2. To select significant structures, we applied a randomization method to obtain
expected values. Since most known RNA sequence ele-

ments in UTRs have the length around 6 nt, we randomized sequences by shuffling hexamers in UTRs with the
goal of separating sequence conservation from structure
conservation. For each aforementioned value type, the
cutoff value was the 95th percentile of all values from the
randomized set. They were found to be 23 nt, 14 nt, and
17 for the size of an aligned structure, the size of a ds
region, and the RSmatch score, respectively. To balance
selectivity and sensitivity, we retained structure alignments that had at least two of three values higher than the
respective cutoff values. We eliminated structure alignments in which two matching structures had identical
sequences, as we were interested in elements conserved on
the structure level in this study, and it was not possible to
differentiate structure conservation from sequence conservation for those alignments. We reasoned, however, that
the ~100 million years since the split of human and
mouse ancestors should have given functional RNA structures enough time to have random mutations in insignificant parts of the structure and compensatory mutations
in the structure, and the sequences are not expected to be
identical unless sequence constraint is also in play. This
step resulted in 6,345 alignments.
We then carried out all-against-all pairwise comparisons
of all 6,345 RNA structures. To make our approach computationally efficient, we focused on human RNA structures obtained from the alignments. Each comparison
yielded an alignment score. We then selected structures
that were similar to at least two other structures with the
alignment score > 17. We obtained 2,054 RNA structures
at this step (see Figure 3A for distribution of scores). Both
alignments in the single-stranded (ss) and doublestranded (ds) regions can contribute to the final RSmatch
score. To assess the contribution of sequence to the selection of these structures, we randomized RNA structures by
swapping nucleotides in both ss and ds regions, while
keeping the overall secondary structure intact. With the
same selection criteria, 851 structures from the randomized set were selected. Thus, about 40% of the selected
structures are primarily due to their structure information,
and the remaining 60% are due to both sequence and
structure information.

To group similar RNA structures together, we applied hierarchical clustering to the data. First, using pair-wise structure alignment scores, we derived normalized
dissimilarity scores to represent distances among the
structures (see Methods for detail). We then constructed a
hierarchical tree containing all 2,054 structures based on
their mutual dissimilarities (Figure 3B and Additional file
2). The hierarchical tree can be "cut" to yield sub trees that
represent RNA groups. Figure 3C gives the distribution of
the number of structure groups obtained by cutting the
tree at every value of normalized dissimilarity score. We

selected values at every percentile of this distribution to
derive 100 cut heights, i.e. 1st percentile, 2nd percentile,
etc. Using these 100 values to cut the tree, we obtained 57,
904 groups of structures, each containing several RNA
structures.
Since we were interested in structures that existed in multiple genes involved in the same pathways, we examined
the RNA structure groups by their GO information for the
biological process category. We applied the hypergeometric test to measure the significance of association between
the genes for a structure group and GO terms (see Methods for detail). A structure group was selected for further
analysis if the group was significantly associated with a
GO term (p-value < 0.05), and there were at least two
genes in the group that were annotated with the significant GO term. To measure how member structures in each
selected group are similar to one another, we used a measurement called Cohesive Value (CoV), which was the
average of all pairwise similarity scores among structures
in the same group. Figure 3D shows the distribution of
CoVs against group size for all groups. To assess the significance of the CoVs, we randomly selected the same
number of structures from 2,054 structures to form
groups and calculated their CoV values. For a given group
size, we repeated the process 100 times and used the mean
value as the expected CoV for groups of the same size.
Since the numbers of structures in a group ranged from 4
to 20, we derived expected values for groups with 4–20
structures (Figure 3E). Groups which had a CoV below the
expected values were eliminated. After GO analysis and
CoV filtering, we obtained 214 structure groups, corresponding to 1,125 distinct structures.
Since one structure may exist in several groups due to the
100 height values used in cutting the hierarchical tree, we
eliminated groups that overlapped with other groups with
a greater number of structures and lower p-values for the
associated GO terms while giving preference to groups
that were highly conserved between human and mouse
based on a cross-validation method described in Methods. This left us with 90 structure groups in all, corresponding to 748 distinct structures from 698 genes. Of the
structures, 74 are from 5' UTRs and 674 are from the 3'
UTRs. Of the groups, 58 groups contain only 3' UTR structures, 30 groups contain structures from both 5' and 3'
UTR and 2 groups contain only 5' UTR structures. The top
10 groups based on CoV are shown in Table 1.
HSL3 and IRE are ranked among the top hits with respect
to CoV values (1st and 2nd) as can be seen in Table 1. This
result not only validated our approach, but also indicated
that other groups of RNA structures may also exist, though
probably not as well conserved as HSL3 or IRE. Using the
multiple alignment function of RSmatch, we generated a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/189

consensus structure for each structure group. In a sense,
each structure group represents a putative RNA structure
element type. The sizes of the consensus structures ranged
from 15 to 31. All groups and structures can be downloaded from our lab web site as a batch file [23], or
searched, retrieved and viewed through an on-line database named GLEAN-UTR DB [24].
To assess the FDR for our method, we repeated all steps
using randomized human and mouse UTR sequences
maintaining overall dimer frequencies, and calculated the
number of selected entries at each step (Additional file 3).
At the last step, this randomized set resulted in 17 groups
consisting of 110 human structures. Thus, the FDR is
~18.89% for the groups and ~14.71% for the structures.
Of these groups, 3 groups with 14 structures also passed
the cross-validation with mouse orthologs, giving FDR
~8.82% for the groups and ~5.96% for the structures.
Comparison with other genome-wide RNA structure
studies
We next wanted to examine how the structures that we
found in this study differed from and overlapped with the
results obtained in other studies that have been recently
carried out for finding conserved RNA structure regions in
the human genome [18-20]. Using 8-way human-referenced vertebrate genome alignments, Washietl et al.
detected 91,676 conserved RNA structures (at P > 0.5)
using the RNAz program, which identifies RNA structures
with similar thermodynamic stabilities across species.
Pederson et al. developed phylogenetics stochastic context-free grammar (phylo-SCFG), and identified 48,479
candidate RNA structures using the same genome alignments. Torarinsson et al. focused on human and mouse
genomic sequences that could not be aligned on the
sequence level, and identified conserved structures by
FOLDALIGN, a tool that simultaneously predicts and
aligns RNA structures. We first identified all the structures
reported by these studies that are located in UTRs, and
compared them with structures found in this study. Of the
1,125 structures that were identified prior to removal of
redundant groups (see above), we found 131 (12%) structures overlapped with those reported by Washietl et al and
Pedersen et. al. (Figure 4 and Additional file 4). If only the
genomic region is examined (without consideration of the
strand), 219 (19%) structures were found to be overlapping with those in these two studies. Of the 178 structures
predicted by Torarinsson et al. that overlapped with UTR
regions, none of them appeared in our final result. A
detailed analysis found that this was caused by differences
in human and mouse UTR coverage (127 cases), gene
ortholog information (27 cases), or structure alignment
(24 cases).

Discussion
We have designed a systematic approach to identify RNA
structure elements conserved in human and mouse UTRs
which may function coordinately in post-transcriptional
regulation of biological pathways. This approach contains
three major steps: (1) compare RNA structures between
orthologous genes; (2) compare RNA structures among all
genes; and (3) select RNA structure groups significantly
associated with certain GO terms. Presumably, mRNAs
containing RNA structure elements from the same group
can be coordinately regulated via trans-acting protein factors, like those having HSL3 and IRE, leading to concerted
modulation of a biological pathway. We applied this

method to mining small RNA structures in this study, primarily because those structures can be more accurately
predicted by RNA prediction programs using only thermodynamic parameters. As more powerful RNA structure
prediction programs become available, particularly those
reliant on phylogenetic information for structure prediction, this approach can be extended to larger RNA structures. The major strength of our approach is the ability to
assign functions to candidate RNA structures in the
genome. In addition, it may help improve the accuracy in
RNA structure identification, as structures shared by multiple genes can be more reliable than those encoded by a
single gene.

One potential approach to improve sensitivity is to search
the genome with consensus RNA structures derived from
the groups. We tested this idea by first generating RNA
structure patterns for the groups and used them to search
human UTRs by PatSearch [27]. Candidate elements were
further analyzed for GO terms to ensure consistency in
their association with biological pathways as the original
groups. As expected, the group size increased exponentially (Additional file 5). While this approach seems
promising in reducing the false negative rate, the control
for false positive rate needs to be further developed. We
leave this work for future exploration.

Figure 4
Comparison of results from 4 RNA structure mining studies
Comparison of results from 4 RNA structure mining
studies. The Venn diagram shows overlapping structures in
UTRs among the results reported by Washietl et al., Pedersen et al., Torarinsson et al., and in this study. The number in
the parenthesis indicates the number of overlapped structures if only genomic regions are considered, i.e. without
consideration of strand.

The assessment of FDR is critical in RNA structure analysis
[25]. Using randomized sequences, we estimated a FDR of
15% for the structures identified in this study. False negative rate or sensitivity is another important issue, particularly in this study in which stringent cutoff values were
applied at multiple steps. However, it is difficult to
address due to lack of knowledge on true positive structure groups. We examined two well-known RNA structure
elements, HSL3 and IRE, for sensitivity. For HSL3 and IRE
genes that have orthologous gene information, we found
that 35% (6 out of 17) HSL3 elements and 60% (6 out of
9) IRE elements are included in our final result. Thus the
sensitivity can be low for some structure groups and high
for others. Several steps can result in exclusion of conserved functional RNA structures in our method. First, the
current coverage of orthologous genes and UTRs is not
complete. In fact, most of the human HSL3 true positive
structures (44 in total) were not even analyzed in this
study due to lack of orthologous gene or UTR information. This will improve as more comprehensive gene
annotations, and more accurate transcription start sites
and polyadenylation sites are available. Second, it is
known that RNA structure prediction by thermodynamic
parameters has limitation in accuracy [26]. Third, some
structures may reside in genes for which GO information
is not adequately annotated.

About 12% of the structures identified in this work overlap those reported in other studies (Figure 4). Interestingly, each genome-wide approach resulted in a large
fraction of unique structures, suggesting that RNA structure identification is largely influenced by the chosen
method. Many structures in UTRs identified by other studies are not in our final result (Figure 4). This is attributable
to several aspects of the design of our study, in addition to
the technical difference and false negative issues described
above. First, our analysis is based on RNA structure
groups, and functional structures located in individual
genes are not included. We found this is the case for several recently reported RNA structures in UTRs [28,29]. Second, RNA structures with similar functions but different
secondary structures, like IRES, cannot be identified.
Third, large structures, like SECIS, are not examined. Notwithstanding these issues, the structures that overlap
between this study and others are of higher importance
for further wet lab validations (Additional file 4).
In summary, our result indicates that there may exist
many conserved stem-loop structures in human UTRs that
are involved in coordinate post-transcriptional gene regulation of biological pathways, similar to HSL3 and IRE
structures. This bioinformatics study lays a ground work
for future wet lab validations of putative RNA stem-loop
groups and represents a framework which can be used to
analyze RNA structures identified by other approaches
and in other species.

Methods
UTR sequence and structure databases
We downloaded 28,926 human and 26,243 mouse RefSeq mRNA sequences from NCBI. UTRs of RefSeq
sequences were extracted according to RefSeq's GenBank
annotation. The information regarding human and
mouse orthologs was obtained from the HomoloGene
database. We prepared RNA structures in UTRs by a
method called "slide and fold" as described previously
[21]. Briefly, for each UTR sequence, we took 100 nt subsequences at every 50 nt nucleotide position from 5' to 3'
resulting in consecutive subsequences overlapping with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/189

one another on a 50 nt segment. Subsequences shorter
than 100 nt, e.g. at the 5' or 3' ends, were also kept. We
then folded all of the subsequences using the RNAsubopt
function in the Vienna RNA package [22], with the setting
"-e 0". With this setting, multiple structures with the same
minimum energy can be generated. Using this method,
we obtained 575,410 structures from human UTRs, and
445,106 structures from mouse UTRs.

from the urn. The probability that x out of the k balls
drawn are white from the urn containing m + n balls is

RNA structure comparison
Pairwise comparisons of RNA structures (human vs.
mouse and human vs. human) were carried out by
RSmatch [21], with the "dsearch" function and default
scoring matrices for ss and ds regions. Specifically, nucleotide match scores were 1 and 3 in single-stranded (ss)
and double-stranded (ds) regions, respectively; and mismatch scores were -1 and 1, in ss and ds regions, respectively. Gap penalty was -6 for both ss and ds regions. This
scoring scheme in effect gave more weight on matches in
ds regions than those in ss regions. Randomization of
RNA structure was carried out by a PERL script.

For each RNA structure group M containing multiple
genes, all GO entries are examined to evaluate their associations with M . Through the mapping information
between M and a GO entry G in a GO category C, we are
able to calculate four numbers: (1) N1, the number of
genes associated with any GO entry in C, (2) N2, the
number of genes associated with G in C, (3) N3, the
number of genes in M associated with any GO entry in C,
and (4) N4, the number of genes in M associated with G
in C, where N1 ≥ N2 and N3 ≥ N4. The p-value of the GO
entry G is calculated by p(G) = f(N4, N2, N1 – N2, N3),
where the function f is defined in equation 1.

Cluster analysis of RNA structures
To cluster RNA structures, we calculated normalized dissimilarity scores Di, j between all structures: Di, j = (SmaxSi,j)/Smax, where Si, j was the similarity score derived from
RSmatch using the local structure alignment function
between structures i and j, and Smax was the maximum
similarity score obtained from all structure comparisons.
For cluster analysis, we used the hierarchical clustering
function in R [30], with the "average linkage" method for
joining nodes. To select groups of RNA structures, we
applied the "cutree" function to cut the hierarchical tree
obtained from R into groups using the normalized dissimilarity scores, which were also called heights in the tree.
Structures in each group were aligned by the multiple
structure alignment function of RSmatch with default
scoring matrices. Structures in the same group were also
compared in a pairwise manner; the average of all pairwise similarity scores for the group was called the Cohesive Value (CoV) of that group, which indicated the degree
of similarity among structures in the group.

Cross-validation with mouse UTR structures
After performing the GO analysis and CoV filtering, we
cross-validated selected human RNA structure groups
with their orthologous mouse structures. For each group,
mouse UTR structures corresponding to human structures
in the group were retrieved. Then the mouse UTR structure
which has the highest similarity to a human structure was
selected. All these selected mouse structures were compared by the multiple structure alignment function of
RSmatch which also gave the consensus structure. The
consensus structure of human RNA structures was then
compared to that of mouse one. An RNA structure group
was considered to be highly conserved if: (1) the human
consensus was identical to the mouse one, or (2) the
human consensus was contained within the mouse one or
vice verse. In case (2), a consensus of human and mouse
structures was built to represent the structure group.

Gene Ontology analysis
The biological process (BP) category of Gene Ontology
(GO) was downloaded from the GO database [31]. The
mapping between genes and GO entries was obtained
from NCBI Gene database [32]. A hypergeometric test was
used to assess whether an RNA structure group was significantly associated with some GO entries. Briefly, in the
hypergeometric test, there are four parameters: (1) m, the
number of white balls in an urn, (2) n, the number of
black balls in the urn, (3) k, the number of balls drawn
from the urn, and (4) x, the number of white balls drawn

structure elements, including ours, and identified overlapped ones by their locations.
