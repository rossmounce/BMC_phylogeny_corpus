Plasmodium ovale infection in Malaysia:
first imported case
Yvonne AL Lim1*, Rohela Mahmud1, Ching Hoong Chew2, Thiruventhiran T3, Kek Heng Chua2

Abstract
Background: Plasmodium ovale infection is rarely reported in Malaysia. This is the first imported case of P. ovale
infection in Malaysia which was initially misdiagnosed as Plasmodium vivax.
Methods: Peripheral blood sample was first examined by Giemsa-stained microscopy examination and further
confirmed using a patented in-house multiplex PCR followed by sequencing.
Results and Discussion: Initial results from peripheral blood smear examination diagnosed P. vivax infection.
However further analysis using a patented in-house multiplex PCR followed by sequencing confirmed the presence
of P. ovale. Given that Anopheles maculatus and Anopheles dirus, vectors of P. ovale are found in Malaysia, this
finding has significant implication on Malaysia’s public health sector.
Conclusions: The current finding should serve as an alert to epidemiologists, clinicians and laboratory technicians
in the possibility of finding P. ovale in Malaysia. P. ovale should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
imported malaria cases in Malaysia due to the exponential increase in the number of visitors from P. ovale endemic
regions and the long latent period of P. ovale. It is also timely that conventional diagnosis of malaria via
microscopy should be coupled with more advanced molecular tools for effective diagnosis.

Background
Malaria is one of the most deadly parasitic diseases in the
world, with an annual infection rate of 500 million cases
and more than one million deaths. In Africa, malaria
remains the single largest killer among children younger
than 5 years of age with a mortality rate of 3,000 children
per day. The latest malaria statistics recorded 243 million
cases with 863, 000 deaths globally [1]. Currently, malaria
can be caused by five Plasmodium species which include
Plasmodium falciparum Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium
ovale, Plasmodium malariae and more recently Plasmodium knowlesi. Infections caused by P. falciparum and
P. knowlesi may be fatal while the other species generally
cause milder disease. Distribution of P. falciparum and
P. vivax are extensively distributed in the tropics and
temperate regions of the world. P. malariae is also found
in these regions but is less common while cases of
P. knowlesi in on the rise in Southeast Asia [2-5] and
P. ovale is mainly restricted to sub-Saharan Africa [6].

In Malaysia, malaria remains the most common vectorborne parasitic disease. Although cases have decline in
general, malaria is still a public health problem in Sabah
and Sarawak. However, more recently, urban malaria cases
have surged. Malaria is still clinically significant due to
high mortality rates caused by P. falciparum in cerebral
malaria cases. The recent cases of P. knowlesi infections in
humans was first brought into international attention in
2004, when Singh et al , a Malaysian researcher, highlighted in The Lancet the occurrence of naturally-acquired
P. knowlesi infections from macaques in human beings
when they examined 208 people with malaria in the Kapit
division [7]. This created great excitement in the field of
malaria research and with an avalanche of information,
P. knowlesi was subsequently labelled ‘the fifth Plasmodium species that infects humans’. In the same study, two
cases of P. ovale were also detected by nested PCR assays.
Since then, no other known cases of P. ovale infection has
been reported. Here, a case of imported P. ovale infection
confirmed by multiplex PCR targeting the small subunit
ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene is reported. The gene
was sequenced and compared with other reference
P. ovale isolates.

Case presentation
A 20-year-old Nigerian male student who has been in
Malaysia for the last six months presented with a history
of fever associated with chills and rigors for the last four
days. Other physical examination findings were unremarkable. He was diagnosed as pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO). Laboratory findings on admission revealed
anaemia (haemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL), platelet count of
117,000/ml and eosinophils of 2%. Blood examination of
the thin smear stained with Giemsa showed enlarged
infected red blood cells (RBCs) with putative parasites
resembling P. vivax. He was treated with quinine 600
mg tds and doxycycline 100 mg bd. One week after
admission, the patient was well.
Confirmation of Plasmodium ovale using in-house
multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
sequencing
Total genomic of this patient’s blood DNA together with
the Plasmodium DNA from the patient was extracted
using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) according

to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA
was subjected to a patented in-house PCR targeting the
SSU rRNA gene. Following that, the PCR products were
electrophoresed on 3% (w/v) ethidium bromide stained
agarose gel. Results showed that the patient was infected
with P. ovale instead of P. vivax, as previously diagnosed
by conventional microscopy (Figure 1, lane 4). Further
confirmation with PCR amplification was also carried out
using genus specific primers (rPLU5/rPLU6) followed by
sequencing.

Analysis of sequences and phylogenetic analyses
of sequence data
Sequencing data obtained was analysed using BLAST
program [8]. The BLAST result showed that the
sequence information obtained has 99% similarity to SSU
rRNA gene of P. ovale in the GenBank. For phylogenetic
analyses, the sequence determined were compared with
those available in GenBank and published in quality,
peer-reviewed scientific journals. Sequences were
trimmed and then aligned using the program Clustal ×

[9], and the alignments were adjusted by employing the
program BioEdit [10].
The phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data was
conducted using Bayesian inference (BI) and by employing the software package MrBayes v3.1.2. Posterior
probabilities (pp) were calculated via 2,000,000 generations (ngen = 2,000,000; burnin = 20,000) using the
Monte Carlo Markov chain method, which utilizes four
simultaneous tree-building chains (nchains = 4) with
every 100th tree saved (samplefreq = 100). The evolutionary distance was calculated using the general time
reversible evolutionary model (nset = 6), which allows
for a gamma-shaped variation in mutation rates between
codons (rates = gamma).
Plasmodium falciparum [GenBank accession number
M19172] [11], P. vivax [GenBank accession number
X13926] [12], P. malariae [GenBank accession number
AF487999] [13], P. knowlesi [GenBank accession
number L07560] [14], were used as the out groups in
the analysis of SSU rRNA sequence data for P. ovale.
Upon the completion of the Bayesian analysis, a 50%
majority-rule consensus tree for each species was constructed in Treeview × v.0.5. Analysis of SSU rRNA
sequence data inferred the patient was indeed infected
with P. ovale and not P. vivax as initially diagnosed by
microscopy (Figure 2).

Discussion
This is the first case of imported malarial infection
caused by P. ovale in Malaysia. P. ovale is a cause of

Page 3 of 6

benign and relapsing tertian malaria and the least common among the human-infecting Plasmodium species.
Besides P. vivax, P. ovale also has a dormant liver stage
(with hypnozoites) following primary infection. Mature
schizonts develop from the hypnozoites which later
release merozoites into the blood stream causing clinical
symptoms of malaria (relapsing malaria) even after
many months of primary infection. However, the therapy of P. ovale infection is similar to that of malaria
caused by P. vivax.
Globally, P. ovale infection causes 0.5-10.5% of all
malaria cases. Although the distribution of P. ovale is
concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa [6], P. ovale infections have also been intermittently reported in other
parts of the world such as India [15-18], Papua New
Guinea [19], Korea [20], Thailand [21], Spain [22] and
Sri Lanka [23]. In Southeast Asia, prevalence of P. ovale
infections ranged from 2.0% to 9.4%, with records from
southern Vietnam, Thai-Myanmar border, Lao PDR and
Indonesia [24-26].
Although clinically, the treatment for P. ovale is the
same as P. vivax, the specific identification of P. ovale is
of significant public health importance. Based on
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based detection of
infected mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles
funestus are the likely natural vectors of P. ovale in Africa
[27]. Anopheles atroparvus has also been experimentally
shown to be an effective mosquito host and capable of
transmitting the infection to humans [28-32]. Other proven experimental hosts are Anopheles albimanus [33-35],

inference (BI). Sequences from the present study as well as reference sequences representing P. ovale, P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. malariae
(acquired from GenBank) are indicated. Posterior probabilities are indicated at all major nodes.

Anopheles quadrimaculatus [33,34], Anopheles freeborni
[36], Anopheles maculates [36], Anopheles subpictus [32],
Anopheles. stephensi and Anopheles balabacensis balabacensis (= Anopheles. dirus) [37]. In studies with the
Donaldson strain of P. ovale, A. quadrimaculatus was the
most susceptible to infection, followed by A. albimanus
from the Florida Keys and A. albimanus from Panama
[33]. In comparative studies with the West African strain,
A. stephensi was the most susceptible, followed by A. freeborni, A. dirus, A. quadrimaculatus, A. maculatus, and
A. albimanus [37]. Anopheles farauti has also been
experimentally infected with P. ovale [38]. From these
proven experimental hosts of P. ovale, two are found in
Malaysia. The presence of A. maculatus and A. dirus in
Malaysia increase the public health risk of naturally
acquiring the infection. Infected P. ovale human host
may be bitten by these vectors and the disease can be
spread via the bite of the infected mosquito.
While most P. ovale infections in Asia were imported
cases, there were at least two reports which indicated
indigenous cases such as the one in India [18] and the
other in Sri Lanka [23]. Since in both cases, patients
involved had no travel history or receipt of blood transfusion or any blood products, P. ovale infection was postulated as locally acquired through infected mosquito
bites [18,23]. These incidences highlighted two possibilities. Firstly, P. ovale parasites could have been prevalent
in these countries but have never been detected due to
high similarities between the morphology of P. ovale
and P. vivax leading to misdiagnosis via conventional
microscopy. Secondly, P. ovale could have first been
introduced into these countries from human host who
had been to Africa, where P. ovale is endemic. With the
presence of suitable mosquito vectors in India and Sri
Lanka, P. ovale could have been transmitted to other
susceptible hosts. However, both articles did not mention about the vectors that were available in each
respective country.
Misdiagnosis of P.vivax/P.ovale infection is possible
because using routine microscopy it is difficult to morphologically distinguish P. vivax and P. ovale parasites.
Both have the characteristic enlarged erythrocytes which
are sometimes not obvious on thick/thin blood smears
that are routinely used to detect malaria infections.
There is also no difference in clinical presentation
between infections with P. vivax and P. ovale, with both
parasites resulting in pathognomonic chills and rigors
every 48 hours.
Therefore, more advanced and reliable diagnostic
techniques, such as PCR, should be utilized to provide
specific identification of species, as was the case in Sri
Lanka [23]. Conventionally, to identify Plasmodium species, microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood
smears has been the diagnostic method of choice [39].

Page 4 of 6

However, it is not easy to identify P. ovale on a blood
smear, particularly when parasite numbers are low and
mixed species infections are present [40]. The frequency
of single P. ovale infection is very low even in P. ovaleendemic areas, while the frequency of mixed species
infection involving P. ovale was very high. In these
areas, P. ovale was more frequently observed using PCR
methods (3.8-16.5%) than with conventional blood
smear methods (0-0.4%) [24,26,41,42]. A combined
application of nucleic acid detection methods with the
conventional blood smear methods should be the future
recommended method especially for the identification of
Plasmodium species in mixed species infections and in
imported malaria cases.
This is important since there have been several recent
reports of P. ovale infections in areas of low transmission of malaria in southern and southeast Asia
[17,24-26,43]. It is believed that these parasites were
introduced into these countries due to increased travel
of tourists to or from Africa. With Malaysia’s open policies in encouraging foreign workers in construction,
agricultural and service sectors, besides providing lots of
higher education opportunities at relatively lower cost
compared to USA and UK, many foreigners including
those from Africa are flocking into the country. Hence,
it is paramount that clinicians and diagnostic laboratory
technicians are fully aware of the possibilities of novel
pathogens being introduced into the country.
This present finding essentially also highlighted the
need to consider even historically distant exposure to
P. ovale, given the potentially long latency period to
relapse [44-46]. It is vital to note that an initially negative single malaria smear does not rule out P. ovale
infection, particularly given its typical low parasitemia
[6,46].

Conclusions
This current finding should serve as an alert to epidemiologists, clinicians, laboratory technicians and other
key stakeholders in the possibility of finding P. ovale in
Malaysia. P. ovale should be considered as an etiology
for imported malaria in Malaysia. There is a potential
risk to public health since the mosquito vectors for
P. ovale are found in Malaysia. In addition, it is also
recommended that there is an urgent need to couple
microscopic technique with advanced molecular methods (i.e., multiplex PCR) for accurate and specific
diagnosis.
