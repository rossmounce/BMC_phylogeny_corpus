Differences in lateral gene transfer in hypersaline
versus thermal environments
Matthew E Rhodes1*, John R Spear2, Aharon Oren3 and Christopher H House1

Abstract
Background: The role of lateral gene transfer (LGT) in the evolution of microorganisms is only beginning to be
understood. While most LGT events occur between closely related individuals, inter-phylum and inter-domain LGT
events are not uncommon. These distant transfer events offer potentially greater fitness advantages and it is for
this reason that these “long distance” LGT events may have significantly impacted the evolution of microbes. One
mechanism driving distant LGT events is microbial transformation. Theoretically, transformative events can occur
between any two species provided that the DNA of one enters the habitat of the other. Two categories of
microorganisms that are well-known for LGT are the thermophiles and halophiles.
Results: We identified potential inter-class LGT events into both a thermophilic class of Archaea (Thermoprotei) and
a halophilic class of Archaea (Halobacteria). We then categorized these LGT genes as originating in thermophiles and
halophiles respectively. While more than 68% of transfer events into Thermoprotei taxa originated in other
thermophiles, less than 11% of transfer events into Halobacteria taxa originated in other halophiles.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is a fundamental difference between LGT in thermophiles and
halophiles. We theorize that the difference lies in the different natures of the environments. While DNA degrades
rapidly in thermal environments due to temperature-driven denaturization, hypersaline environments are adept at
preserving DNA. Furthermore, most hypersaline environments, as topographical minima, are natural collectors of
cellular debris. Thus halophiles would in theory be exposed to a greater diversity and quantity of extracellular DNA
than thermophiles.

Background
The extent and role of lateral gene transfer (LGT) as a
force of evolution has only recently become appreciated.
Only in the past couple decades has the sequencing of
genomes such as that of Thermotoga maritima thrust
LGT into the limelight [1]. The original estimates suggested that over 20% of Thermotoga maritima’s genome
was the result of long distance LGT events. This and
numerous other results have led to a potential reevaluation of the tree of life and the notion of a Last Universal
Common Ancestor [2,3].
LGT itself is driven by a variety of mechanisms including conjugation, or the transfer of genetic material via
direct contact [4], transduction, or the viral mediated

transfer of DNA [5], and transformation, or the uptake
and incorporation of naked DNA from an environment
[6]. Conjugative transfers necessitate the cohabitation of
the participants and are generally thought to require the
participants to be closely related, although inter-class
conjugative events have been shown to occur between
members of the Proteobacteria [7]. Similarly, while most
transductive phages and phage like objects are restricted
to infecting members of the same species, phages that
infect across classes are known to exist [8]. Finally, transformative events present no definitive phylogenetic barrier. Presumably a microorganism can take up virtually
any DNA present in its immediate environment. However the probability of a harvested piece of assembled
DNA being incorporated into a genome is partially
dependent on sequence similarity between the donor and
host DNA and is therefore much greater for closely
related individuals [9]. Consequently the vast majority of

LGT events are thought to occur between closely related
species. Nevertheless inter-phylum and inter-domain
transfer events can and do occur [1,10]. These “long
range” transfer events are partially the result of transformation events and, while relatively rare, offer a potentially significant evolutionary mechanism.
Species within the domain Archaea and a variety of
bacterial phyla are known to be capable of transformation
[9]. Preliminary estimates indicate that approximately 1%
of bacterial species are naturally able to take up DNA
[11]. The frequency of a transformation event is dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to,
the quantity of DNA in an environment, the rate of DNA
degradation in an environment, the frequency of DNA
uptake by the recipients, the likelihood of incorporation
into a genome, and natural selection on the incorporated
DNA [9]. These factors in turn are highly specific to individual species and environments. Here, we have used
genomic and metagenomic techniques to test mechanisms of LGT into two phylogenetically coherent clades
from different extreme environments.
Halophiles and Thermophiles-

Extremophiles, and in particular thermophiles and halophiles, are well-known for participating in rampant LGT
[1,12,13]. It is theorized that the very nature of their
extreme environments encourages the exchange of genetic
material. Essentially any advantages gained in overcoming
the environmental challenges are highly sought after,
rapidly exchanged, and potentially accelerate the rate of
evolution. In this regard, thermal and saline environments
are quite similar. Both offer considerable environmental
obstacles to be overcome before life can persist.
The crenarchaeal class, Thermoprotei, consists solely of
obligate thermophiles. Similarly, the euryarchaeal class,
Halobacteria, consists solely of obligate halophiles. Any
LGT event into a member of the Thermoprotei or the
Halobacteria necessarily occurred in either a thermal or
hypersaline environment respectively. Thus, together
these two distinct archaeal lineages offer a naturally
occurring evolutionary experiment by which we can
study “long range,” inter-class and more distant, LGT
events in these specific environments.
However, with regard to transformation, there are
some significant differences between these two types of
extreme environments. For example, high temperatures
rapidly degrade unprotected DNA, both intracellularly
and extracellularly, thereby preferentially preserving
more thermally protected DNA. Fittingly, certain proteins, enzymes, and specifically salts, such as MgCl2 and
KCl, can help protect DNA from thermal degradation
[14,15]. In contrast, high salinities can preserve even
naked DNA for exceptionally long periods of time.
Borin et al. demonstrated that the preservation of naked

Page 2 of 12

DNA in deep-sea anoxic hypersaline brines did not
depend on the species of origin and that DNA was
often capable of participating in natural transformation
after weeks of exposure [16]. Another fundamental difference between thermal and saline environments is that
saline environments almost as a rule are topographical
minima. Saline environments such as the Dead Sea are
therefore natural collectors of cellular debris and may
therefore contain the DNA of a diversity of contaminant
species [17]. Thermal environments, however, may or
may not be topographical minima and therefore may or
may not be natural collectors of cellular debris. Environmental factors would therefore serve to increase the
diversity of extracellular DNA in a typical saline environment relative to the typical thermal environment.
Analyses of halophiles have revealed a number of
genomic characteristics common to halophilicity. Foremost amongst these characteristics is a propensity for
GC richness possibly to protect against thymine dimerization due to the intense UV radiation often associated
with hypersaline environments [18]. The preference for
GC nucleotides is present in virtually all known lineages
of halophiles and is nearly ubiquitous amongst the Halobacteria, Haloquadratum walsbyi being the sole known
exception. However interspersed among the GC rich
genomes of the Halobacteria are many GC poor regions
[18]. The varied composition of the Halobacteria genomes combined with the diversity of metabolic functions
and the frequent occurrence of insertion sequence elements suggested to Kennedy et al. that the Halobacteria
are particularly adept at procuring novel genes and
metabolic pathways [18].
Other DNA level propensities include an increased
abundance of the dinucleotides ‘CG’, ‘GA/TC’, and
‘AC/GT’ and preferences for specific codons for the
amino acids arginine, cysteine, leucine, threonine, and
valine, presumably for secondary and tertiary stability
in protein folding [19]. Furthermore, halophiles have
developed two distinct strategies to overcome the
extreme salinities of their native environments. While
the “salt-out” halophiles balance the osmotic pressure
of their environments with intra-cellular organic
solutes such as betaine, the “salt-in” halophiles use
KCl. The presence of often multimolar concentrations
of K+ ions requires radical alterations of protein chemistry. These alterations in protein chemistry include an
overall preference for amino acids with acidic residues
relative to amino acids with basic residues [20]. The
halophiles of the class Halobacteria are all “salt-in” and
they all demonstrate a bias toward amino acids with
acidic residues, regardless of their nucleotide composition. Recent metagenomic studies have confirmed this
trend on an environmental scale in a number of hypersaline environments [17].

At a salinity of over 340 g/l, the modern surface
waters of the Dead Sea represent one of the most saline
naturally occurring bodies of water known to harbor
life. When combined with a slightly acidic pH (~ 6),
near toxic magnesium levels, (currently about 2.0 M
Mg2+), and dominance of divalent cations over monovalent cations [21], it becomes a truly unique and inhospitable ecosystem. Current cell counts are well below 5 ×
105 mL-1 [22]. A number of species of the Halobacteria
have been isolated from the Dead Sea, including Haloarcula marismortui [23], Haloferax volcanii [24], Halorubrum sodomense [25], and Halobaculum gomorrense
[26]. However recent metagenomic studies have suggested that the dominant microorganism in the modern
Dead Sea is most closely related to a member of the
neutrophilic, halophilic, euryarchaeal genus Halobacterium or the alkaliphilic, halophilic, euryarchaeal genus
Natronomonas [17,27].
Identifying LGT events-

Putative LGT events are generally identified using two
distinct methods: phylogenetic methods attempt to identify genes associated with LGT events by constructing
and analyzing phylogenies in an effort to find genes that
do not conform to the group’s established taxonomy.
Compositional methods, on the other hand, identify LGT
events by searching for genes whose DNA or amino acid
signatures do not match those of their host organism.
The methods are essentially complementary, in that they
use unrelated data to obtain similar conclusions. For this
reason the two methods often identify entirely different
classes of LGT events [28,29]. Here, in an attempt to
investigate the drivers of LGT in thermal and hypersaline
environments, we have employed a predominantly phylogenetic approach to identify putative LGT events involving a thermophilic class of Archaea, the Thermoprotei,
and a halophilic class of Archaea, the Halobacteria. We
then seek to confirm our results in a collection of environmental fosmids from the Dead Sea.

Results
Genomes from all fully sequenced genera of the archaeal
classes Thermoprotei (Acidilobus, Aeropyrum, Caldivirga,
Desulfurococcus, Hyperthermus, Ignicoccus, Ignisphaera,
Metallosphaera, Pyrobaculum, Staphylothermus, Sulfolobus, Thermofilum, Thermoproteus, Thermosphaera, and
Vulcanisaeta) and Halobacteria (Halalkalicoccus, Haloarcula, Halobacterium, Haloferax, Halomicrobium, Haloquadratum, Halorhabdus, Halorubrum, Haloterrigena,
Natrialba, and Natronomonas), were obtained from the
NCBI database in November of 2010. These genomes
were then compared to the entire collection of fully
sequenced microbes using the BLASTP program and
default parameters [30]. In cases where the normalized

best BLAST score to members of its own class but not
within its genus was less than 75% of the normalized best
BLAST score to non-members of the Thermoprotei or
Halobacteria respectively, the gene was flagged as a probable inter-class LGT event. Overall this method identified
1226 genes from Halobacteria and 1279 genes from Thermoprotei as “long distance” LGT events. To test for the
possibility of bias in our downstream analyses associated
with the 75% BLAST score cutoff, the procedure was
repeated with cutoffs ranging from 90% to 50%.
We believe that our algorithm should preferentially
identify LGT events into the Halobacteria and Thermoprotei. For the vast majority of LGT events identified the
closest homologues were exclusively or almost exclusively
from outside of the Halobacteria or Thermoprotei respectively, thereby suggesting that the transfer was into a
member of the Halobacteria or Thermoprotei. Nevertheless, to check this we constructed phylogenetic trees for a
representative sample of LGT genes from each class using
the top homologues in the KEGG database (Figure 1,
Figure 2, and SI 1) [31]. As expected, upon inspection, the
vast majority of genes showed evidence of having been
transferred into the Halobacteria and Thermoprotei. For
the remainder, the majority showed phylogenies too disordered to make an accurate statement.
Assignment to Clusters of Orthologous Groups of
proteins (COGs)-

Both the genes associated with long distance LGT events
and the genes not associated with long distance LGT
events were assigned to functional categories according to
the classification of the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of
proteins (COG) database (Figure 3) [32]. For both the
Thermoprotei genomes and the Halobacteria genomes,
“Information storage and processing” genes belonging to
categories, J (Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis) and K (Transcription) are considerably underrepresented amongst genes presumed to have undergone LGT.
In a similar vein, “Metabolic” genes belonging to categories C (Energy production and conversion), G (Carbohydrate transport and metabolism), P (Inorganic ion
transport and metabolism), and Q (Secondary metabolites
biosynthesis, transport and catabolism) are overrepresented amongst genes that have undergone LGT in either
the Thermoprotei, the Halobacteria, or both. Genes
involved in “Cellular processes and signaling” are inconclusive. While category M (Cell wall/membrane/envelope
biogenesis) is overrepresented in genes associate with
LGT, categories N (Cell motility), O (Posttranslational
modification, protein turnover, chaperones), and T (Signal
transduction mechanisms) are underrepresented among
genes associated with LGT. As a whole, these results coincide well with the conclusions of Rivera et al. [33] that
LGT should favor operational genes over informational

genes. This is especially true for distantly related LGT
events and may offer limited non-phylogenetic evidence
that we have in fact identified long distance LGT events
[34].
Homologue Taxonomy

For the genes associated with LGT events, we then identified the species representing the closest homologue to

the original archaeal gene as matched by BLAST. We
categorized these donor species according to their halophilicity and thermophilicity (Figure 4a-f). As expected,
the majority, 68%, of the donor species to the Thermoprotei demonstrate thermophilic character themselves
(Figure 4a). Genes originating in thermophiles should be
pre-adapted to thermal conditions and therefore should
present fewer obstacles to incorporation into a

Thermoprotei genome. In stark contrast however, the
vast majority, >89%, of donor species to the Halobacteria, were not species with known halophilic character
(Figure 4d). This appears to suggest that something
other than pre-adaptation to a high salt environment is
the determining factor in successful LGT events into
Halobacteria and presumably other halophiles. It is
worth noting that for both the Thermoprotei and the
Halobacteria the proportion of genes identified as intraenvironmental LGT events remained consistent regardless of the BLAST cutoff used in the LGT identification
step (SI 2).
Database Bias

Figure 3 Assignment of genes to COG categories. Chart
depicting the percentage of genes assigned to various COG
categories for both regular genes and genes identified as LGT
events into the (a) Halobacteria and (b) Thermoprotei. The COG
categories shown demonstrated a statistically significant disparity
between LGT genes and non-LGT genes beyond a 95% confidence
interval. The categories depicted with an * fell just below the 95%
threshold.

There exists a potential bias in our analysis however, in
that there are many more fully sequenced thermophiles in
the databases than there are halophiles. While it seems
unlikely, most if not all of the LGT events from non-halophiles into the Halobacteria could actually originate in
heretofore unidentified and/or unsequenced halophiles.
The complexity and diversity of hypersaline environments,
and for that matter the majority of the microbial world, is
poorly constrained [35]. Thus, barring a direct observation
of a LGT event from a non-halophile to a member of the
Halobacteria, it appears impossible to rule out the possibility that we have not identified the correct donor species.
Nevertheless, there are a number of tests that can lend
support to our assertion that that the database bias does
not account for the vast majority of the discrepancy
between LGT into Thermoprotei and Halobacteria. These
include:
1) Restricting the analysis to only particularly strong
matches -

Figure 4 Origin of LGT genes. Pie charts depicting the proportion
of inter-class LGT events from halophiles into the Halobacteria and
from thermophiles into the Thermoprotei for all genes (a and d),
only hits with bit scores > 500 (b and e), and only instances where
multiple genes were transferred (c and f).

We restricted the analysis to LGT events whose top
homologue had a BLAST bit score of greater than 500.
Of the 1226 identified LGT events into the Halobacteria,
67 met this criterion. Of these 67, 51 or approximately
76% were to species which do not demonstrate halophilic
tendencies (Figure 4b). Thus, as expected we do observe
an increase in the proportion of LGT events originating
in halophiles relative to non-halophiles. However, the
increase only accounts for a small portion of the putative
LGT events originating in non-halophiles. Of the top five
examples of putative LGT events, only one is to a known
halophile, Salinibacter ruber (Bacteroidetes). The other
four, all with BLAST scores of 963 or better, are to nonhalophiles (Table 1). The same analysis was performed
on the Thermoprotei LGT genes. Amongst the 1279
identified LGT events into the Thermoprotei, 69 had
BLAST scores of greater than 500. Of these 69, only 10,
or approximately 14% were to non-thermophilic species
(Figure 4e), yielding an even greater increase than for the
Halobacteria. Also, all five of the strongest examples of

LGT into Thermoprotei originate in thermophilic
lineages (Table 1).
2) Restricting the analysis to only LGTs of neighboring
gene pairs -

We identified 22 instances within the Halobacteria
where adjacent genes or genes separated by a single
gene were apparently transferred together and showed
conservation not only of gene content, but also of gene
order. The inter-class conservation of gene order offers
concrete proof that these genes have undergone a LGT
event. Of the 22 gene pairings, 19 originated in species
with no known halophilic tendencies (Figure 4c), again
suggesting that a significant portion of long range LGT
events into the Halobacteria did not originate in halophiles. For the Thermoprotei we identified 55 multiple
gene transfers, of these, only 7 or 13% originated in
non-thermophiles (Figure 4f).
3) Looking for the presence of distinctly halophilic traits
within the transferred genes-

As mentioned above, there have been a number of
reported genomic indicators of halophilicity. These indicators include genome wide GC content, a preference for
the dinucleotides ‘CG’, ‘GA/TC’, and ‘AC/GT’, a number
of codon preferences, and an overall bias toward amino
acids with acidic residues [19,20]. If a significant portion
of the LGT genes did originate in non-halophiles, then
values for these indicators would be expected to be

higher in the non-LGT halobacterial genes than in the
LGT halobacterial genes. These trends should not necessarily be observed for the Thermoprotei. Figure 5 shows
a genus by genus breakdown of all values in LGT genes
and non-LGT genes for both the Halobacteria and the
Thermoprotei. The most robust trends are observed for
the GC content and ‘CG’ dinucleotide preference. All 11
Halobacteria genera demonstrate a statistically significant
increase in both GC content and ‘CG’ dinucleotide preference for the non-LGT genes relative to the LGT
genes. This includes the genus Haloquadratum which
has an anomalously low genomic GC content of 48%.
However, as the Thermoprotei do not demonstrate a
similar trend, the lowered GC content does not appear to
be inherent to LGT events, nor can it be attributed to an
artifact of our algorithm.
Both ‘GA/TC’ and ‘AC/GT’, also demonstrate a trend
toward an increase among the non-LGT genes for the
Halobacteria. The trends while not quite as strong, are
still apparent. The Thermoprotei show a similar trend for
‘GA/TC’ and a reverse trend for ‘AC/GT’. Amongst the
codon biases, cysteine, leucine, threonine, and valine all
show a trend toward an increased preference in the halobacterial non-LGT genes. Only arginine demonstrates a
reverse trend. Meanwhile, the Thermoprotei do not
appear to exhibit any particular trends. Finally, neither
the Halobacteria nor the Thermoprotei show a particularly strong trend between LGT genes and non-LGT
genes for the amino acid bias.

for both the Halobacteria and Thermoprotei. Values for which the LGT genes are less than the non-LGT genes are shaded in green. Values for
which the LGT genes are greater than the non-LGT genes are shaded in red. All values that exhibited greater than 95% confidence are shown in
bold font. The indicators are: GC - GC content of the gene pools. CG Di’s, GA/TC Di’s, AC/GT Di’s- Difference in preference for ‘CG’, ‘GA/TC’, and
‘AC/GT’ dinucleotides given nucleotide frequencies. Arginine (CGA and CGG), Cysteine (UGU), Leucine (CUC), Threonine (ACG), and Valine (GUC) Difference in preference for respective codons given nucleotide abundances. AA Bias - Ratio of aspartic acid and glutamic acid to arginine,
lysine, and histidine.

Environmental halophiles examples

Twenty-five 40 kb fosmids from the surface water of the
2006 Dead Sea were sequenced on a quarter plate of a
454FLX sequencer. The sequencing run produced a total
of 90,479 reads with an average read length of 237 base
pairs, for a total of approximately 21 million base pairs of
sequence. The sequences were then assembled and a total
of 95 contigs with greater than 2,000 base pairs were produced. These contigs were compared to the collection of
fully sequenced genomes using a BLASTX search. The
contigs were then scanned for the presence of Halobacteria genes, and all contigs without a majority of

Halobacteria genes were discarded. The remaining contigs
were searched for the presence of genes whose top normalized BLAST score to a member of the Halobacteria
was less than 75% of the top normalized BLAST score to
any non-member of the Halobacteria. Twenty-two putative “long distance” LGT genes were identified in this
manner of which only two were from known halophiles
(SI 3). The top five instances are provided in Table 1.

Discussion
Using a homology-based approach we identified 1,226
putative inter-class LGT events involving members of the

Rhodes et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:199
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/199

obligatory halophilic archaeal class Halobacteria and
1,269 putative inter-class LGT events involving members
of the obligatory thermophilic archaeal class Thermoprotei. The vast majority of these LGT events consisted of
gene transfers into the Halobacteria and Thermoprotei.
Furthermore, the phylogenetic distance between the
donor species and the recipient species suggests that the
majority of these LGT events were the result of natural
transformation. As the Halobacteria are all obligate halophiles and the Thermoprotei are all obligate thermophiles the transformative events must have occurred in
saline and thermal environments respectively.
Conventional thinking would suggest that the Halobacteria would be exposed to naked DNA from predominately other halophiles and that the Thermoprotei would
be exposed to naked DNA from predominately other
thermophiles. Additionally, genes originating in other
halophiles and thermophiles would be preadapted to the
particular environmental conditions and would therefore
be more likely to be successfully transferred. Thus we
would expect the majority of LGT events into the Thermoprotei to originate in other thermophiles and the
majority of LGT events into the Halobacteria to originate
in other halophiles. However, we found that while the
majority of these transformational events into the Thermoprotei did in fact originate in other thermophiles, the
majority of these transformational events into the Halobacteria did not originate in other known halophiles.
This suggests that there is something fundamentally different between LGT in thermophiles and LGT in
halophiles.
Unfortunately, as with all studies relying on genomic
databases, there is the potential for distortion from database bias. In our study we face three disparate database
issues. First, there is always the possibility that we may
have misidentified LGT events. Second, while the fully
sequenced Thermoprotei originate from a number of distinct orders, the fully sequenced Halobacteria all belong
to a single family, the Halobacteriaceae. It is unclear how
the reduced phylogenetic diversity of the Halobacteria
would affect our analysis. Finally, the relative paucity of
fully sequenced halophiles outside the Halobcateria as
compared to thermophiles outside the Thermoprotei
may explain our observation that more Halobacteria
donors are non-halophiles than Thermoprotei donors are
non-thermophiles. Nevertheless, a number of halophiles
have been sequenced in non-Halobacterial lineages
including Bacillus halodurans of the bacterial class
Bacilli, Methanohalophilus mahii and Methanohalobium
evestigatum of the euryarchaeal class Methanomicrobia,
and Chromohalobacter salexigens of the bacterial class
Gammaproteobacteria. In all four of these cases there
remain numerous LGT events apparently originating in
close non-halophilic relatives. At the same time we also

Page 9 of 12

went to great lengths to seek out additional lines of evidence that would help confirm our findings.
We restricted the analysis to LGT genes with especially
strong matches and to instances where multiple genes
were transferred together and gene order was conserved.
Restricting the analysis to especially strong matches
increases the likelihood of having identified both an LGT
event and the correct donor species. Restricting the analysis to multiple gene transfers virtually guarantees that a
LGT event took place. In both cases we achieved similar
results to our initial analysis.
We then investigated independent genomic indicators
of halophilicity for each genus of the Halobacteria and
Thermoprotei. These indicators consisted of GC content,
‘CG’, ‘GA/TC’, and ‘AC/GT’ dinucleotide content, codon
preferences, and amino acid preferences. If the LGT
genes into the Halobacteria did in fact originate in nonhalophiles, some residual signature of non-halophilicity
could remain. Essentially this amounts to an independent
assessment of LGT events specifically targeting halophiles. Of the ten indicators investigated for the Halobacteria, eight supported our assertion, one did not indicate
a clear trend, and only the codon preference for arginine
refuted our conclusion.
The strongest support came from genomic GC content
and ‘CG’ dinucleotide content. Both indicators showed a
statistically significant increase from non-LGT genes to
LGT genes for every genus and represent strong support
for the correct identification of LGT genes and for the
non-halophile origin of the majority of them. This
includes the genus Haloquadratum which is unique
among the Halobacteria for having a relatively low genomic GC content of approximately 48%. It therefore might
appear that there is something inherent to genes associated with LGT that accounts for the differences in GC
content. However, for the Thermoprotei there was no
clear trend for the indicators as a whole and for genomic
GC content there appeared to be a decrease in genomic
GC content from LGT genes to non-LGT genes.
Finally we sought confirmation of our genome based
results from within metagenomic samples. We used
fully and partially assembled fosmid inserts from the
surface waters of the Dead Sea, a highly saline environment, to identify inter-class LGT events in environmental halophiles. Once again the vast majority of the donor
species were non-halophiles.

Conclusions
In this study we provide a number of lines of evidence
that suggest that the mechanisms and origins of “long
distance” LGT events into the Thermoprotei and Halobacteria are different. We theorize that the difference in
the origin of LGT genes lies in the differing natures of
hypersaline and thermal environments with respect to

Rhodes et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:199
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/199

naked DNA. Hypersaline environments are often adept
at preserving both naked DNA and intact microorganisms. There have even been claims of intact DNA and
viable bacteria preserved in 200 million year old salt
crystals [36-38]. In contrast, thermal environments
rapidly degrade DNA. Thermophilic organisms, therefore, must go to great lengths to protect and stabilize
their DNA from the environment. Thus intracellular
degradation of DNA would be expected to be greater
for non-thermophiles, and thermally stable DNA would
be in better condition upon release to the environment.
Furthermore various mechanisms of DNA protection,
such as association with DNA binding proteins, may
provide transient protection extracellularly. The net
effect of these and other protective methods would lead
to an increase in intact thermophilic DNA in a thermal
environment relative to non-thermophilic DNA.
In a related vein, hypersaline environments generally
occupy topographic minima. This makes hypersaline
environments such as the deep Mediterranean basins and
the Dead Sea natural collectors of debris, cellular and
otherwise [16,17]. Thus the average halophilic microorganism should be exposed to a much greater diversity of
DNA than an average thermophilic microbe. Together
these facts suggest that halophilic microorganisms are
exposed to a greater proportion of intact non-halophilic
DNA than thermophiles are exposed to intact non-thermophilic DNA. This suggestion combined with the relatively large genome size, diverse genomic composition,
and broad range of metabolic capabilities of the Halobacteria paint the picture of the Halobacteria potentially acting as the consummate opportunists, incorporating and
utilizing genes from a great variety of organisms. However, in order to better identify and understand LGT
events amongst halophiles many more halophiles must
be sequenced and the dynamics of naked DNA in a variety of naturally occurring settings must be studied.

Methods
DNA extraction and fosmid preparation

The Dead Sea environmental sample was collected and
processed in 2007 by the Béjà lab group (Technion,
Haifa, Israel) according to the protocol of Bodaker et al.
[27]. The fosmid inserts were then shipped frozen to
Penn State. The inserts were run on a 1% low melting
point agarose gel to remove residual contamination and
the 40 kb band was extracted and digested with the
Gelase enzyme (Epicentre). The fosmids were then
sequenced on a GS FLX sequencer (454 Life Sciences)
on one quarter of a pico-titre plate.
Fosmid analysis

The fosmid sequences were assembled using the 454
assembler program. All contigs of greater than 2,000

Page 10 of 12

base pairs were compared to the collection of fully
sequenced Bacteria and Archaea using the BLASTX
program, an e-value of 10 -5 , and default parameters.
The contigs were then spliced according to gene location and another identical BLASTX comparison was
conducted on each gene. Each gene whose top hit was
not to a member of the Halobacteria, had a normalized
bit score (BLAST bit score to homologue divided by
BLAST bit score to self) more than 25% greater than
the best hit to a Halobacteria gene, and had a bit score
greater than 67 was flagged as a putative inter-class
LGT event. Then all contigs were scanned for genes
belonging to the Halobacteria, and contigs without a
majority of genes assigned to Halobacteria species
were discarded. Finally, a number of genes demonstrated near perfect, upwards of 95%, identity to likely
laboratory contaminants such as Escherichia coli.
These genes were also removed from the analysis. The
remaining 22 genes were considered LGT events and
the donor species were assigned according to the best
hit as matched by BLAST. A web search was then conducted to identify whether the donor species was a
known halophile.
Genome Analysis

All fully sequenced Thermoprotei and Halobacteria genomes were compared to the collection of all fully
sequenced Bacteria and Archaea using BLASTP, an evalue of 10-5, and default parameters. Each gene whose
top non-identical hit was not to a member of the Halobacteria or Thermoprotei respectively, had a normalized bit
score more than 25% greater than the best non-identical
hit to a member of the Halobacteria or Thermoprotei, and
had a bit score greater than 67 was flagged as an interclass LGT event. In cases such as Pyrobaculum where
more than one species has been sequenced, the analysis
was conducted on the species with the most genes and all
hits to members of its genus were masked out. The
remaining species were subjected to the usual analysis and
any additional LGT genes were included in the analysis of
the genus. In cases such as Sulfolobus islandicus where
multiple strains have been sequenced a similar masking
was performed. The donor species were assigned according to the best hit as matched by BLAST and a web search
was then conducted to identify whether the donor species
was a known halophile or thermophile respectively. Genes
were assigned to COGs based upon the NCBI annotation.
All additional analysis was performed using home-written
scripts in Perl and/or Python. The scripts are available
upon request. For the purposes of our statistical analysis
the values of the non-LGT gene pool were taken as representative of the taxon as a whole. We then used a chi
square test to assess the likelihood of the LGT genes originating in the same population.

Phylogenetic Tree Building

The phylogenetic trees included in the supplemental material were constructed using the online tools available in
association with the KEGG database. For each gene with a
BLAST score of over 500, its twenty closest homologues
were selected. The CLUSTALW tool was then used to create an alignment, and an unrooted neighbor joining tree
was constructed. The phylogenetic trees were inspected
manually for indicators of LGT directionality. For the phylogenetic trees depicted in Figures 1 and 2, LGT genes
from both the Thermoprotei and Halobacteria were pooled
into three pools depending on BLAST bit score. Five genes
at random were chosen from each pool and the top 14
homologues from distinct genera were selected from the
KEGG database. The CLUSTALW tool was again used to
create an alignment. The alignments were then loaded into
PHYLIP and trees were constructed with 100 bootstraps
and the mean-least-squared method [39].
