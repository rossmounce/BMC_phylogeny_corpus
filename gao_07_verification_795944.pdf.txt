Abstract
This article exemplifies a systematic approach to revealing the complexity of Chinese herbal
medicine formulae through three levels of scientific research: standardization of herbs, verification
of ancient formulae and mechanism studies. We use Danggui Buxue Tang (DBT) as an example for
this approach. Among thousands of traditional Chinese medicine herbal formulae, almost all of
which consist of multiple herbs, DBT is one of the simplest. Containing only two herbs, namely Radix
Astragali (RA) and Radix Angelicae Sinensis (RAS), DBT is traditionally used to treat ailments in women.
The weight ratio of RA to RAS in DBT was prescribed to be 5:1 as early as in 1247 AD. In addition
to advanced chemical analysis of herbal constituents, DNA genotyping techniques have been
developed for reliable standardization of RA and RAS. Chemical evaluation shows that main active
constituents in DBT, including astragaloside IV, calycosin, formononetin and ferulic acid, were most
abundant after extraction at the RA to RAS ratio of 5:1, whereas other tested RA to RAS ratios only
gave sub-optimal levels of the active constituents. Biological evaluation indicates that bioactivities
of DBT, e.g. immuno-modulatory, oesteotropic and estrogenic effects are also best exerted at the
RA to RAS ratio of 5:1. Correlation analysis demonstrates statistically significant relationship
between the tested chemical constituents and tested bioactivities. Up- and down-regulation of
expression of some genes as potential biomarkers has been detected by using gene chip technology.
This systematic approach on the basis of herbal standardization, chemical and biological verification
and mechanism studies, as exemplified in this article, will be useful to reveal the complexity of not
only DBT but also other Chinese medicine herbal formulae.

Background
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to
improve the well-being of the Chinese people for thousands of years. TCM products, many of which were raw
materials, made up only 3% of the 16 billion USD international herbal medicine market in 2004 [1,2]. Since the
market opening-up of China, international pharmaceutical companies have been gaining a market share in both
conventional and herbal medicine products in China. In
the 21st century, TCM products should meet stringent
international quality and safety standards through modernization; otherwise they will lose their competitiveness.
Standardization as the basis of modernization and internationalization of TCM is the key to ensure the safety and
efficacy of TCM products. At present, lack of standardization in TCM products impedes the development of TCM.
For instance, it is common that different herbs have the
same name or a single herb has different names in the
market. Some herbs cultivated in different regions or harvested in different seasons may vary considerably in their
chemical and biological properties. Most of the TCM
products do not have specific biomarkers. TCM is traditionally administered in the form of a decoction with a
combination of different herbs. The complexity of biological effects of the interactions among different compounds within a decoction complicates experimental
studies to reveal the action mechanisms.
Among thousands of TCM formulae, Danggui Buxue Tang
(DBT) is one of the simplest. The formula consists of only
two herbs: Radix Astragali (RA, Huangqi) and Radix Angelicae Sinensis (RAS, Danggui) in a weight ratio of 5:1.
According to a traditional method, the herbs are boiled
together in two bowls of water at moderate heat until the
final volume has been reduced to one bowl [2]. In a book
entitled Neiwaishang Bianhuo Lun in 1247 AD, DBT was
first described by Li Dongyuan, one of the four wellknown TCM physicians during the Jin and Yuan Dynasties
in China.
In this review, we summarize recent findings of DBT to
exemplify a systematic approach to revealing the complexity of Chinese herbal medicine formulae through three
levels of scientific research: standardization of raw materials, verification of ancient formulae and mechanism studies.
Standardization of Radix Astragali and Radix Angelicae
Sinensis
A reliably reproducible chemical composition of DBT is a
prerequisite in delineating the biological effects of this
Chinese medicine preparation. The quality of RA and RAS
may be considerably influenced by weather, geographic
location, soil conditions, and the methods of cultivation

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/2/1/12

and processing. Some Chinese medicinal materials with
excellent quality are only produced in certain regions of
China which are often referred to as 'the best growth
region' or 'Didao'. Therefore, how to authenticate and
choose the best RA and RAS plays a critical role in ensuring the quality of DBT (Figure 1).
Radix Astragali
Astragalus L. (Leguminosae) is a large genus with over
2,000 species worldwide and more than 250 sections in
angiosperm family Fabaceae (subfamily Papilionoideae).
Both listed as the botanical sources of RA in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2005) [3], Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.)
Bunge and Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge var.
mongholicus (Bunge) P.K. Hsiao [4,5] are the most commonly used RA. The morphological appearances and
chemical properties of RA and its adulterants show a
remarkable resemblance [6-8]. The DNA sequences of 5S
rRNA spacer, ITS and 18S rRNA coding region were determined and compared among ten Astragalus taxa [6-8].
With neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony analyses, phylogenetic trees were mapped according to their
sequence diversity. A. membranaceus and A. membranaceus
var.mongholicus have the highest sequence homology. The
common substitute of RA in some parts of China is the
roots of Hedysarum polybotrys which has very different

genetic makeup from that of the Astragalus species [9]
(Figure 1).
HPLC and spectrophotometry were used to determine the
levels of isoflavonoids, astragalosides, polysaccharides,
amino acids and trace elements, which are the main active
constituents in different Astragalus species and RA collected in different seasons and of various ages. The results

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/2/1/12

indicated that RA of three years of age from Shanxi, China
(Figure 2a) contained the highest amounts of isoflavonoids, saponins and polysaccharides [6,10].
Radix Angelicae Sinensis
According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2005) [3], RAS
is the root of Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (family Umbellaceae); however, Angelica acutiloba (Sieb. et Zucc.) Kitag.

and Angelica gigas Nakai, mainly found in Japan and
Korea respectively, are also sold as RAS in the markets of
South East Asia [11-14] (Figure 1). Studies have shown
that the three commonly used Angelica roots vary in their
chemical composition, pharmacological properties and
efficacy [9,11]. The 5S-rRNA spacer domains of the three
species of Angelica were amplified and their nucleotide
sequences were determined. The sequence of A. sinensis is
72.87% and 73.58% identical to those of A. acutiloba and
A. gigas respectively, while A. acutiloba and A. gigas are
93.57% identical in their sequences [9]. The phylogenetic
tree clearly reveals that the three Angelica species are
divided into two clusters: A. sinensis is in one cluster and
A. acutiloba and A. gigas are in another.
The main chemical constituents of Angelica roots are ferulic acid, Z-ligustilide, angelicide, brefeldin A, butylidenephthalide, butyphthalide, succinic acid, nicotinic
acid, uracil and adenine [9,15-17]. The levels of ferulic
acid and Z-ligustilide are often used as chemical markers
for the quality control of Angelica roots [16]. In A. sinensis
roots from Gansu, China, the levels of ferulic acid and Zligustilide are about ten-fold higher than those of the
roots of A. acutiloba (from Japan) and A. gigas (from
Korea) [9,17] (Figure 2b). Su Jing (659 AD) in Tang Bencao and Li Shizhen (1596 AD) in Bencao Gangmu recorded
that Angelica roots of two years of age produced in Gansu
were the authentic source. RAS from Gansu contains
about two-fold higher amounts of Z-ligustilide and ferulic
acid than those RAS from Yunnan, Shanxi or Sichuan,
China [9] (Figure 2b). To ensure the best quality of DBT
decoction, we suggest that standardized RA from Shanxi
and standardized RAS from Gansu should be used in all
DBT preparations (Figure 2c).
Verification of the DBT formula
Chemical evaluation
Li Dongyuan (1247 AD) documented that RA and RAS
combined at a ratio of 5:1 demonstrated the best efficacy.
In a previous study [18], DBT was prepared by boiling the
herbal mixture under various conditions and the results
indicated that the 5:1 ratio indeed provided the maximum
levels of active constituents of DBT. Furthermore, the levels of active constituents and biological activities of DBT
extracts were investigated with preparations of RA and
RAS at ratios of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 7:1 and 10:1.

Used as chemical markers, the main active constituents in
DBT include RA-derived astragaloside IV, calycosin and
formononetin, RAS-derived ferulic acid and ligustilide,
and total saponins, total flavonoids and total polysaccharides [19]. The detected levels of the chemical markers varied significantly among the seven preparations (Figure 3).
The level of astragaloside IV of the 5:1 ratio preparation
was the highest, 2-fold higher than the 10:1 ratio prepara-

http://www.cmjournal.org/content/2/1/12

tion which recorded the lowest level [19]. The 5:1 ratio
preparation also contained the highest level of calycosin,
formononetin, and ferulic acid. As regards the levels of
total saponins, total flavonoids and total polysaccharides,
the 5:1 ratio DBT preparation recorded the highest levels
(Figure 3) [19].
There are several possibilities for higher levels of active
chemical constituents in DBT preparations. Firstly, compounds such as saponins (over 2% in total dry weight)
[10,17] in RA may help increase the solubility of other
compounds extracted from RAS. For example, astragaloside increases the solubility of RAS-derived ferulic acid
and ligustilide. Secondly, ferulic acid and ligustilide are
readily oxidized under heat, which means they can be
degraded when boiled [9]. However, when RAS is boiled
together with RA, compounds derived from RA may prevent this oxidization process, thereby producing a higher
yield of ferulic acid and ligustilide in DBT preparations.
Thirdly, the stability of those active constituents may be
improved by having a cocktail of different chemicals. Further research is required for better understanding of this
complexity.
Biological evaluation
According to TCM theories, DBT replenishes qi and nourishes xue (the blood). DBT is therefore used for treating
menopausal symptoms [2]. Due to a deficiency of ovarian
hormones, especially estrogen, women in menopause
often suffer from hot flashes, sweating, anxiety, mood
swings and an increased risk for other health problems,
such as reduction of bone mineral density and cardiovascular diseases [20]. Apart from a lack of estrogen, the
immune system is also involved in the menopausal symptoms. Steroid hormones may modulate the immune
response [21] and immune reactions may also regulate
the ovarian function [22]. Various bioactivities related to
menopausal symptoms, such as osteotropic effect, estrogenic effect, anti-platelet aggregation effect and immunomodulatory effect have been used to evaluate the functional roles of DBT.

DBT extract was applied to a cultured human MG-63 osteosarcoma cell. Bone cell proliferation and differentiation
were measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthioazol-2-yl)-2, 5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) assay. DBT induced both the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast MG-63 cells in a
dose-dependent manner. In both assays, DBT showed
stronger effects than RA or RAS alone, In the MTT assay,
the 5:1 ratio DBT extract stimulated MG-63 cell proliferation, which was 10–20% higher than the extracts of other
ratios (Figure 4). For bone cell differentiation, the 5:1
ratio DBT preparation induced ALP activity to the highest

level among all ratios and showed the strongest osteotropic effect [19].
The estrogenic effects of DBT were tested by a cellular
reporter system of transcriptional activation of estrogen
receptor/promoter. A promoter/reporter construct (pERELuc) corresponding to the responsive elements of estrogen receptor was stably transfected into MCF-7 cells. The
DBT extracts of various ratios were applied onto the cultures for 2 days. Two parameters, namely cell number and
promoter activity (luciferase activity), were determined.
While DBT was not able to alter the proliferation of MCF7 cells, the estrogen-driven promoter activity was markedly induced by DBT (Figure 4); the 5:1 ratio DBT showed
the strongest effect in inducing the promoter activity than
RA, RAS alone or the extracts of other ratios [19].
In anti-platelet aggregation assay, the activity of DBT in
preventing ADP-induced platelet aggregation was determined. The ratios 5:1 and 7:1 DBT extracts demonstrated
higher levels of activity in preventing platelet aggregation
than either RA, RAS alone or the extracts of other ratios
(Figure 4) [19].

In a study of immuno-modulatory effects, DBT preparations of various ratios were applied to cultured T-lymphocytes and macrophages. In cultured T-lymphocytes,
DBT induced markedly cell proliferation, interleukin-2
secretion and the phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK1/2). In addition, the phagocytosis
of cultured macrophages was elevated by DBT treatment.
The immuno-modulatory effects of 5:1 ratio DBT were the
strongest [23] (Table 1).
In addition to the in vitro assays, the 5:1 ratio of RA and
RAS in DBT was further tested and verified by animal
studies. In DBT-administrated mice, the 5:1 ratio preparation was the most effective decoction in triggering
immune responses [24,25].
The pharmacological studies in animals also suggest that
DBT has the ability to promote hematopoiesis, to stimulate blood circulation, to prevent osteoporosis and to
counter oxidative stress [19,26,27]. Moreover, DBT is
known to enhance myocardial mitochondria and glutathione status in red blood cells, thereby increasing their
resistance to injury induced by oxidative stress [28]. In

rats, DBT protected against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in a dose-dependent manner [28]. A more
potent cardio-protection was demonstrated in DBTtreated rats than in rats treated with either extracts of RA,
RAS alone, or a mixture of RA and RAS (not boiled
together). When the mice were administered orally with
DBT, the serum collected from abdominal aorta was
added to an in vitro cultivating system of mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells. The decoction-contained serum
showed promoting actions to CFU-GM and CFU-E. Once
again, the action of the 5:1 ratio DBT was 97.81% stronger
than that of the 1:1 ratio extract [29,30] (Table 2).

The values are means ± SD, n = 5, each with triplicate samples.

Mechanism studies
Correlation between chemical fingerprints and bioactivities of DBT
Fifty-four chemical peaks were detected in DBT extracts by
an HPLC analysis (Figure 5a) and a total of over 100 DBT
extracts from various preparations were analyzed [27].
Among these 54 peaks, the markers for RA-derived astragaloside IV, calycosin and formononetin, and for RASderived ferulic acid and ligustilide were identified. In analysis of correlation, the identified 54 peak areas together
with the contents of total saponins, total flavonoids and
total polysaccharides were considered as independent variables. The results of the four bioactivities, namely proliferation and differentiation of MG-63 cells, estrogenic
property in MCF-7 cells and anti-platelet aggregation
activity, were considered as dependent variables. By analyzing the correlation of these two kinds of variables, coefficients of correlation between the HPLC data of the 57
chemicals and the bioassay data of the DBT extracts were
obtained. The values of the coefficients indicate possible
relationship of these chemical peaks with bioactivities,
where positive values suggest positive effects of chemicals

In the assay of MG-63 cell proliferation, astragaloside IV,
formononetin, total saponins and total flavonoids are
correlated with the bioactivities (Figure 5b). In the assay
of MG-63 cell differentiation, formononetin, total saponins and total flavonoids are correlated with the bioactivities. In the analysis of estrogen promoter in MCF-7 cells,
ferulic acid are correlated with the bioactivities. Calycosin
and total polysaccharides were two very important factors
in the assay of anti-platelet aggregation. On the other
hand, the amount of ligustilide showed negative effects in
all bioassays (Figure 5b). Other components of DBT, such
as those corresponding to peaks 5 to 15, have high correlation coefficients with the bioactivities, but are yet to be
identified.
Specific estrogenic and immuno-modulatory effects of DBT
The estrogenic effects of DBT were investigated by determining the levels of phosphorylation of estrogen receptor
α (ERα) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2) in cultured MCF-7 cells. In contrast to estrogen,
DBT triggered the phosphorylation of ERα and ERK1/2 at
both S118 and S167 in a time-dependent manner.
Although the activity of the estrogen-responsive element
in pERE-Luc stably expressing MCF-7 cells was activated
by extracts of either RA or RAS alone, or by a mixture of

Li YK et al. [25]

Zhang YH et al. [29]

Zhang YH et al. [30]

RA and RAS, the phosphorylation of ERα at S167 and of
ERK1/2 were only found in DBT-treated cultures. Interestingly, the specific estrogenic effects of DBT were not only
shown in the MCF-7 cells [31].
In cultured T-lymphocytes, the phosphorylation of the
ERK 1 (about 42 kDa) and ERK 2 (about 44 kDa) was
increased by DBT [30]. The induction was transient. An
approximately eight-fold increase of ERK phosphorylation was detected 20 minutes after DBT was applied,
whereas the phosphorylation was undetectable in the cultures treated with extracts of either RA or RAS alone [31].
Moreover, the phosphorylation of ERK in T-lymphocytes
could not be activated by a simple mixture of extracts of
RA and RAS. This result suggests that boiling RA and RAS
together is essential for DBT to exert estrogenic effects.
Genomics
For decades, scientists mainly isolated pure chemicals
from herbal extracts and then screened for biological
activities and possible targets. This strategy does not
garantee to isolate and/or identify active chemicals from
well-known medicinal plants because a single chemical
compound may not fully account for the overall effects of
herbal extracts. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics have enriched our tool sets to reveal the complex
nature of TCM decoctions. An experiment on DBT-regulated genes was carried out in our laboratory using gene

chip (i.e. microarray) technology. Cultured MG-63 cells
were treated with 1 mg/ml of RA, RAS or DBT for 24
hours. The isolated mRNAs were analyzed using microarray, which is a quantitative method to investigate the
change of mRNA expression profiles between the control
and treatment groups. A total of 8064 genes were
screened. Significant changes in gene expression were
found after the treatment of DBT, RA or RAS (Table 3). A
total of 883 genes were either up or down regulated by
DBT treatment of which 403 genes were DBT-specific; 660
genes were regulated by RA treatment of which 172 genes
were RA-specific; 1,062 genes were regulated by RAS treatment of which 473 genes were RAS-specific. In addition,
279 genes were commonly regulated by the extracts of
DBT, RA or RAS. The genomic analysis demonstrated not
only the activation effect of DBT in stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of the cultured osteoblasts but
also a set of candidates of biomarkers that are specifically
activated by DBT. These DBT-specific changes in gene
expression may be useful in developing biomarkers for
quality control of DBT. After identification of these DBTspecific genes and their roles, it will be easier to elucidate
the action mechanism of DBT.

Conclusion

12.

In verification studies of DBT decoction, the quality of
herbal materials is ensured by authentication analysis.
The ancient formula of RA to RAS ratio at 5:1 has been
confirmed in both chemical composition and biological
responses both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanism studies
have also revealed some therapeutic effects of DBT. It is
hoped that a systematic research and development
approach, as exemplified in this article, will provide an
effective method to develop Chinese herbal medicine
products.
