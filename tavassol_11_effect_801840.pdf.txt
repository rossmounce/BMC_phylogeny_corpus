postoperative radiotherapy on expression of heat
shock protein 70 (HSP70) in head and neck vessels

Abstract
Background: Preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer result in
changes to the vessels that are used to construct microsurgical anastomoses. The aim of the study was to
investigate quantitative changes and HSP70 expression of irradiated neck recipient vessels and transplant vessels
used for microsurgical anastomoses.
Methods: Of 20 patients included in this study five patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation, another five
received conventional radiotherapy and 10 patients where treated without previous radiotherapy. During surgical
procedure, vessel specimens where obtained by the surgeon. Immunhistochemical staining of HSP70 was
performed and quantitative measurement and evaluation of HSP70 was carried out.
Results: Conventional radiation and neoadjuvant chemoradiation revealed in a thickening of the intima layer of
recipient vessels. A increased expression of HSP70 could be detected in the media layer of the recipient veins as
well as in the transplant veins of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Radiation and chemoradiation
decreased the HSP70 expression of the intima layer in recipient arteries. Conventional radiation led to a decrease
of HSP70 expression in the media layer of recipient arteries.
Conclusion: Our results showed that anticancer drugs can lead to a thickening of the intima layer of transplant
and recipient veins and also increase the HSP70 expression in the media layer of the recipient vessels. In contrast,
conventional radiation decreased the HSP70 expression in the intima layer of arteries and the media layer of
recipient arteries and veins. Comparing these results with wall thickness, it was concluded, that high levels of
HSP70 may prevent the intima layer of arteries and the media layer of vein from thickening.

Background
Irradiation and vessels

The therapy of patients suffering from oral cancer could
be recently improved by utilization of multimodal interdisciplinary regimes using a combination of surgery,
chemo- and radiotherapy [1,2]. Extensive tissue defects
following ablative tumor therapy do require adequate
and functional reconstruction regardless of whether the
patient received preoperative irradiation or not. During
the last 20 years, the free vascularised tissue transfer
became to be the “criterion standard” for reconstruction
in head and neck cancers [3-6]. Large patient series with

successful free flap transfer for head and neck reconstruction have been reported by many authors and
demonstrated today’s role as principal reconstructive
procedure [5-10]. Since Guelinckx (1984) we know that
irradiation of the recipient vessels in head and neck free
flaps is leading to morphological changes [11]. Following
studies confirm these results [12-14]. Different authors
conclude, thus, although success is certainly possible
when irradiated vessels are used for flap revascularization, there may be an increased risk of thrombosis, particularly in the head and neck [15,16]. Reviewing the
current literature is leading to a different success rate of
free flaps in irradiated patients ranging from 88% to
nearly 100% [17-22]. Regarding the histological findings
after irradiation, qualitative changes of the vessels such as
hyalinosis of the intima and the media are described in

literature [11,23]. Schultze-Mosgau et al. (2002) could
show qualitative and quantitative histological changes to
the recipient arteries, but not to the recipient veins following irradiation with 60-70 Gy. In contrast, neoadjuvant chemoradiation did not show changes to the
recipient vessels [14].
Heat shock proteins (HSP)

HSP are found in all organisms and all cell types. They are
the most phylogenetically conserved proteins known with
respect to both structure and function [24]. Usually, HSP
are expressed at low levels, and under normal physiological conditions, many members of the HSP family are
involved in protein synthesis. When a cell is stressed, oligomeric complexes disassemble and polypeptides unfold.
Under these conditions, the role of HSP is to reverse such
changes and, if refolding becomes impossible, to potentially speed up the removal of such denatured proteins.
Expression of HSP is induced even under nonstress conditions, including those of the cell cycle, development, and
differentiation [24-26]. Regarding the literature, even
radiation could induce stress proteins in vitro [27]. Hurwitz et al. (2010) could show that radiation therapy
induces expression of HSP70 in patients with prostate
cancer [28]. Furthermore, the expression of heat shock
proteins is induced by anticancer drugs such cisplatin
[29,30].
Aim of the study

The aim of the study was to investigate quantitative
changes and HSP70 expression of irradiated neck recipient vessels and transplant vessels used for microsurgical
anastomoses in free flaps in patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation.
The second aspect was to find out if HSP 70 might protect the transplant and recipient vessels.

Methods
Patients

The ethical approval was given by the local ethical committee. Of 20 patients included in this study (March 2004
- October 2006), 10 patients where treated without previous radiotherapy (group 1), five patients received conventional radiotherapy (59.4 - 72 Gy) (group 2) at least
22 months before surgery and another five patients
received neoadjuvant chemoradiation 6 weeks before surgery (group 3, Table 1). The neoadjuvant chemoradiation
protocol included cisplatin 12.5 mg/m2 plus 40 Gy radiation or paclitaxel 40 mg/m2/carboplatin AUC 1.5 plus 40
Gy radiation [1,2]. During surgical procedure, 5-10 mm
long vessel specimens where obtained by the surgeon. In
each case a transplant artery and transplant vein from
the raised flap and a recipient artery (superior thyroid or

facial artery) and a recipient vein (facial vein) from the
neck were achieved.
Immunhistochemistry

Serial 3-mm sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated,
washed and, treated with a solution of 2% horse serum,
0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Corporation, Steinheim, Germany), and 0.1% sodium acid in 150 mmol/l
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) for 15 min to
block nonspecific antibody-binding. A polyclonal rabbit
anti-HSP70 antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), specific to HSP from Escherichia coli, which shares more than
48% sequence homology with mammalian HSP70 was the
first layer. The optimal dilution of anti-HSP antibody
(1:250) was determined by titration. The selected sections
were incubated with this antibody for 120 min at room
temperature (RT). The second layer, a biotin-conjugated
goat antirabbit immunoglobulin (Oncogene, San Diego,
CA USA) diluted 1:200 in PBS was incubated for 30 min
at RT. The third layer was an avidin-biotin-horseradish
peroxidase complex (Dako) diluted 1:50 in PBS. Incubation was, as before, 30 min at RT. Sections were washed
for 10 min in 2 changes of PBS between each layer. The
color reaction was developed with a solution consisting of
0.05% 3,30- diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA), 0.03% nickel chloride (Sigma), and
0.01% hydrogen peroxide in 48 mmol/l Tris-HCL, pH 7.6
(Sigma). Counterstaining was carried out with Mayer’s
hematoxylin [24,26].
Quantitative evaluation

For quantitative histomorphometric analysis, cross-sections were obtained from the middle third of the vessels
and analyzed with the image processing and analysis
program analysis 3.1® (Soft Imaging System, Münster,
Germany). The measurement included the vessel wall
thickness differed by the intima and the media and was
carried out three times by two examiners. The mean
values thus obtained were used for the following
analysis.
Evaluation of HSP 70 expression

Light microscopy and analysis 3.1®, an image processing
and analysis program, were used for evaluating HSP70
expression. Respectively the intima, media or adventitia
region was defined as the region of interest (ROI) and
the percentage of HSP70-positive staining was analyzed
[26].
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed on a SPSS 18 statistical package. The specimens were compared for differences in percentage of HSP 70 staining and thickness of

Results
Clinical data

There where three women (15%) and 17 men included in
this study. The mean age of all patients was 55.5 years
(range 30 to 84, median 55, SEM 3.69). The mean age of
group 1 (no irradiation) was 59.2 years (median 57.5), the
mean of group 2 (conventional irradiation, 59.4-72 Gy)
was 52 years (median 57) and of group 3 (neoadjuvant
chemoradiation, 40 Gy) 51.6 years (median 55). The mean
duration between conventional radiation (group2) and surgical treatment was 70.2 months (median 80). Thirteen
patients stated to be smokers (65%). Reconstruction was
performed by using the radial forearm flap in 12 cases
(60%), latissimus dorsi flap in six cases and each one by
fibula flap and lateral arm flap (5% each, table 1). All flaps
were successful.
Vessel wall thickness

The results of the vessel wall thickness are summarized in
Figure 1A-D and table 2. The wall thickness of the vessels
showed significant thickened intima layer of transplant
and recipient veins in group 3 (neoadjuvant chemoradiation, Figure 1A). Conventional radiation (group2) led to

thickening of the media layer of the recipient veins (Figure
1B). Regarding the arteries, conventional radiation
(group2) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (group3)
revealed in a thickening of the intima layer of recipient
vessels (Figure 1C). The media layer of the arteries led to a
thickening of the recipient vessel in group3 (neoadjuvant
chemoradiation) with a contemporary thinning of the
transplant vessels in group2 (conventional radiation) and
group3 (neoadjuvant chemoradiation, Figure 1D).
HSP70 expression

The results of HSP70 expression are presented in Figure
2A-D and table 2. A increased expression of HSP70
could be detected in the media layer of the recipient
veins as well as in the transplant veins of patients treated
with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (group3) (Figure 2B,
Figure 3A+B). Radiation (group2) and chemoradiation
decreased the HSP70 expression of the intima layer in
recipient arteries (Figure 2C). Regarding the arteries, an
enhancement of HSP70 expression was limited to the
media layer of the recipient vessels (group3, Figure 3D).
Conventional radiation (group2) led to a decrease of
HSP70 expression in the media layer of recipient arteries
(Figure 2D, Figure 3C).

therapy in head and neck oncology [3-6]. Many patients
had been treated successfully in the last two decades
[5-9]. For successful free tissue transfer, the quality of
the transplant and the recipient vessels are desirable.
Survival of free flaps is dependent on adequate blood
supply. Pre-existing changes in transplant and recipient
arteries may cause technical difficulties and must be
regarded as additional factors contributing to graft failure [31,32]. Histopathologic damage of the recipient vessels in head and neck microsurgery can be caused by
different reasons. Arteriosclerotic changes were often
seen in patients suffering from head and neck cancer
[31]. However, in many cases surgical treatment is not
sufficient and adjuvant therapy might be necessary [1,2].
In these cases neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is
used to increase local tumour control and to decrease
the incidence of distant metastases. Nevertheless, a

preoperative radiation is known to lead to histopathological changes in recipient vessels [12-14,14]. These morphological changes include hyalinosis of the intima and
media layer and may increase the risk of thrombosis
[15,16]. The current literature is describing different
success rates of free flaps in irradiated patients ranging
from 88% up to 100% [17-22]. A previous study from
our department could demonstrate that neoadjuvant
chemoradiation influenced the outcome of free vascularised tissue transfer while the circumstance if a patient
is a smoker or not has no impact to success [6]. Therefore we did not discriminate between smokers and non
smokers. To distinguish a possible effect of radiation
from the influence of smoking in histomorphometry, we
decided to harvest specimens from the transplant. The
data of the present study showed different changes of
the vessels influenced by preoperative radiation or

Figure 3 Expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in vessels of a patient treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation: transplant vein
(A), recipient vein (B), transplant artery (C) and recipient artery (D). (*) thickened intima;

chemoradiation therapy. A thickened intima layer of the
recipient arteries in patients undergoing conventional
radiation (group2, 59.4-72 Gy) or neoadjuvant chemoradiation (group3, 40 Gy) could be demonstrated. These
findings are partially in contrast to the findings of
Schultze-Mosgau et al. (2002), who described changes
only after conventional radiation but not after chemoradiation [14]. The study of Schlutze-Mosgau et al.
included a total of 93% smokers while our patient database contains only 60% smokers. Nevertheless, the chemoradation group (group 3) included 100% smokers is
thus comparable. Another differing result is concerning
the veins. We could demonstrate an enlargement of the
intima layer of both, the transplant and the recipient
vein. This could indicate that anticancer drugs may
affect the veins especially considering that conventional
radiation has no influence on the intima layer. Only the
media layer is influenced by conventional radiation. We
think this could be a long-time effect touching the recipient veins.

The second aspect of our study is concerning the HSP70
expression in vessels after radiation or chemoradiation.
However, it is known, that radiation therapy or anticancer
drugs can induce the expression of HSP70 [27-30,33,34].
Our findings can be concluded in three major results: 1.
chemoradiation increases the HSP70 expression of the
media layer in transplant and recipient veins while conventional radiation decreases the expression of HSP70 in
the recipient vein. 2. conventional radiation and chemoradiation decreases HSP70 expression in the intima layer of
recipient arteries, and 3. conventional radiation decreases
HSP70 expression in the media layer of the recipient
artery. Comparing the results of the intima layer of the
arteries between HSP70 expression and wall thickness, it
seems that low expression of HSP70 correlates with thickened intima layer. This applies to be the same in the
media layer of the recipient veins. However, regarding
these results it has to be considered that the sample power
of this study is low and further study may be helpful to
confirm these results.

Conclusions
In the present study we could demonstrate, that radiation therapy is affecting the histomorphology of recipient veins of patients suffering from head and neck
cancer. Although, there was no failure in our patients,
the thickening of the intima layer in recipient arteries
may influence success of free vascularised tissue transfer
[17-22]. However, anticancer drugs can lead to thickening of the intima layer of transplant and recipient veins.
HSP70 expression is decreased by conventional radiation
in the intima layer of arteries and the media layer of
arteries and veins. Anticancer drugs by contrast increase
the HSP70 expression in the media layer of the recipient
vessels. Comparing these results with wall thickness, it
was concluded, that there might be some coherence
between high levels of HSP70 expression and the prevention of thickening of the intima layer of arteries and
the media layer of vein from.
