Abstract
Background: Oceanography and life-history characteristics are known to influence the genetic
structure of marine species, however the relative role that these factors play in shaping
phylogeographic patterns remains unresolved. The population genetic structure of the endemic,
rocky shore dwelling Caffrogobius caffer was investigated across a known major oceanographic
barrier, Cape Agulhas, which has previously been shown to strongly influence genetic structuring
of South African rocky shore and intertidal marine organisms. Given the variable and dynamic
oceanographical features of the region, we further sought to test how the pattern of gene flow
between C. caffer populations is affected by the dominant Agulhas and Benguela current systems of
the southern oceans.
Results: The variable 5' region of the mtDNA control region was amplified for 242 individuals
from ten localities spanning the distributional range of C. caffer. Fifty-five haplotypes were
recovered and in stark contrast to previous phylogeographic studies of South African marine
species, C. caffer showed no significant population genetic structuring along 1300 km of coastline.
The parsimony haplotype network, AMOVA and SAMOVA analyses revealed panmixia. Coalescent
analyses reveal that gene flow in C. caffer is strongly asymmetrical and predominantly affected by
the Agulhas Current. Notably, there was no gene flow between the east coast and all other
populations, although all other analyses detect no significant population structure, suggesting a
recent divergence. The mismatch distribution suggests that C. caffer underwent a population
expansion at least 14 500 years ago.
Conclusion: We propose several possible life-history adaptations that could have enabled C. caffer
to maintain gene flow across its distributional range, including a long pelagic larval stage. We have
shown that life-history characteristics can be an important contributing factor to the
phylogeography of marine species and that the effects of oceanography do not necessarily suppress
its influence on effective dispersal.

the passive dispersal opportunities that the marine environment offers.

Background
With no obvious physical barriers to gene flow, marine
species with large ranges are expected to show genetic
homogeneity over long stretches of ocean – a panmixia
paradigm [1]. Many studies have, however provided evidence to the contrary, finding strong genetic structure and
detecting oceanic barriers to gene flow that often correspond to biogeographic regions [2,3]. It is now known
that several factors, including oceanography [4,5], life history traits [6] and contemporary factors such as local
adaptation [[6] and references therein] may strongly influence the genetic structuring of marine organisms despite

The South African coastline offers a unique setting to
study the relative importance of oceanography on the
genetic structuring of marine organisms. There are two
contrasting current systems that meet as the continental
shelf widens between Cape Agulhas and the Cape Peninsula (Figure 1). These are the warm Agulhas Current,
which flows southwards from Mozambique along the
eastern coast of the country, and the cold Benguela Current that runs northwards along the western coast [7]. The

Agulhas Current deflects away from the coastline near
Algoa Bay, resulting in mixing of warm and cool water
around the South Coast [[7,8]; Figure 1]. Based on the distribution patterns of currents, topographical features and
species compositions [9], three biogeographical regions
are recognized along the South African coastline. These
are the subtropical East Coast (from KwaZulu-Natal to
east of Algoa Bay), the warm-temperate South Coast
(from Algoa Bay to Cape Point), and the cold-temperate
West Coast (from Cape Point to the Namibian border)
[[9]; Figure 1].
It has traditionally been accepted that species with good
dispersal abilities should show little or no genetic structure over large stretches of ocean, whereas live-bearers and
species with short larval durations (or larval retention
strategies) should be more strongly structured genetically
[10]. However, many closely related species with the same
potential dispersal abilities have been found to show contrasting phylogeographic patterns over the same geographic range [11,12]. In addition, data derived from 70
studies that investigated the population genetic structure
of species across the Atlantic-Mediterranean break have
recently been re-analyzed and it has been suggested that in
this region there may not be a relationship between biological traits and phylogeographic structure of marine species [3]. In South Africa, all intertidal and shallow subtidal
species studied to date have exhibited a genetic break over
Cape Agulhas (the southernmost point of Africa), irrespective of their dispersal abilities [13-17]. Furthermore,
larval duration, swimming abilities and retention strategies (e.g. brooding of eggs) only seem to influence the
phylogeography of South African invertebrates on a
regional scale (within biogeographic regions), as even the
mudprawn (Upogebia africana) and caridean shrimp (Palaemon peringueyi) with long-lived, actively swimming larvae exhibit at least one genetic break [15].
Caffrogobius caffer is a goby endemic to South Africa. These
fish are abundant in rock pools and primarily restricted to
the high intertidal zone. As such they are well adapted to
survive extreme temperature and salinity ranges [[18];
authors pers. obs]. They have been cited as occurring from
False Bay (Cape Peninsula) on the south-west Coast to
Delagoa Bay in southern Mozambique [19], although
Hoese [20] states that these gobies do not occur in
Mozambique and we, despite intensive sampling, did not
catch any east of Haga Haga on the east coast. Importantly, mark-and-recapture studies strongly suggest that
adult movement is limited to nearby pools only [18],
making adult dispersal over long distances highly
unlikely. The reproductive biology of C. caffer is not well
documented, but insights from the closely related Caffrogobius gilchristi, an estuarine inhabitant, could be used
as an indicator. However, the duration of their pelagic lar-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/325

val stage can only be speculated on, compared with findings for closely related species (Strydom, pers. comm.). It
is also likely that male gobies guard their eggs until they
hatch.
Our objective was to determine whether life history influences the population structure of a widely distributed fish
species that is primarily restricted to life in the high intertidal zones. Given the length of coastline investigated
(~1300 km) and that C. caffer probably has limited dispersal abilities due to an abbreviated life history where male
fish guard the eggs, we expect to find evidence of population genetic structuring along the distribution range, particularly over the regions strongest barrier to gene flow,
Cape Agulhas. Further, we hypothesised that gene flow
patterns are strongly influenced by the dominant current
systems in the range of C. caffer, in particular by the Agulhas Current, and accordingly, we should find asymmetric
gene flow patterns between populations. Further, we aim
to elucidate whether life-history characteristics are indeed
unimportant predictors of genetic structure of South
Africa's coastal biota [13-16], i.e. that oceanography is the
dominating force in shaping populations in the region.

Methods
Sampling protocol and laboratory procedures
Fishes were collected from ten localities covering a wide
distributional range of the species using ethylenglycolmonophenylether (phenoxyethanol; Merck) added to
rockpools and handnets (Figure 1). Sampling was carried
out within the laws of South Africa. Despite intensive
sampling, we could not obtain samples from the central
and northern Kwazulu-Natal coastline where C. caffer
seems to be replaced by C. natalensis. All fishes have been
deposited in the JLB Smith collection at the South African
Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity, Grahamstown. A small
piece of muscle tissue was digested overnight in an extraction buffer containing 20 μl ProteinaseK at 55°C. DNA
was extracted using the DNeasy™ Tissue Kit (Qiagen), following the protocol for animal tissues. Primers and PCR
cycling conditions of Lee et al. [21] were used for amplification of the 5'-end of the mitochondrial DNA control
region; a marker that has proved useful in numerous population genetic studies, especially of fishes. PCR products
were gel purified using the Illustra™ DNA and Gel Purification Kit (GE Healthcare). Cycle sequencing was carried
out using BigDye Terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems) and the products were analysed on an automated
sequencer (AB 3100, Applied Biosystems).
Statistical analyses
Sequences were edited and aligned by eye with BioEdit
ver7.0.4.1 [22]. Sequences were checked against goby control region sequences on GenBank, with a tblastx search,
to ensure that the correct region was amplified. Haplo-

types were identified in Collapse1.2 http://dar
win.uvigo.es. Haplotype (h) and nucleotide diversity (π)
indices were calculated for each population individually
and for the whole dataset, in Arlequin3.1 [23]. All haplotypes have been deposited in [GenBank: EU335086–
EU335140].

trol region of the mtDNA molecule has been found to
have a mutation rate of 11–13% per million years in the
white sturgeon [33]. Based on this, two separate calculations were done – one using a 3.6% per million years
mutational rate and one based on a 11% per million years
mutational rate.

Population structure
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) was carried out
in Arlequin3.1 to investigate the geographical distribution
of haplotypes and provide the fixation indices for
between- and within population variation. ΦST values
were calculated to take the number of mutational changes
between the haplotypes into consideration [24]. SAMOVA
was used to calculate the geographic distribution of
genetic structure. This maximises the proportion of the
total genetic variation between groups of populations, as
well as identifying possible genetic barriers between them,
without pre-defining populations as is necessary for
AMOVA [25]. The geographical coordinates of each sampling location were obtained from Google Earth®. To
detect possible isolation by distance, a Mantel test was
performed in Arlequin3.1 using 10 000 permutations and
the measured geographical distances between localities
determined from a scaled map as the shortest land-sea
interface distance, but excluding bays.

Migration between sampling localities
To estimate past migration rates, as well as the directionality of gene flow between populations, Migrate-n version
2.4 was used [34,35]. In order to maximize the statistical
power of our gene flow analyses we sought to minimize
the number of parameters [see e.g. [36]] and constructed
a stepping-stone model with asymmetrical gene flow. Our
study system is particularly suited to this model, given the
linear nature of the southern African coastline. For the
stepping-stone migration model, two analytical runs were
conducted, an initial short run, followed by a second
longer run. For both runs, the starting values of the population mutation parameter and the ratio between the
immigration rate and the respective population and mutation rate per generation were estimated from FST values
[34]. For the long-run 10 short-chains, each with a total of
25,000 generations and a sampling increment of 20 generations, and two long-chains each with a total of 250,000
generations and a sampling increment of 50 generations
were run twice. A total of 50,000 and 12,500,000 genealogies (recorded steps multiplied by the sampling increment) were visited by the short and long chains,
respectively. For both, the short and long chains, the first
10,000 genealogies were discarded (the burnin). An adaptive heating scheme with four chains (starting values of
5.00, 2.50, 1.50, 1.00) and a swapping interval of one was
used to ensure that efficient mixing occurred. For the
other settings, default values were implemented.

Demographic history
Fu's FS test [26] was used to test for possible population
expansion, for the whole dataset, as well as for each sampling location separately. A mismatch distribution [27]
was also calculated to further investigate the demographic
history of C. caffer populations. The Sum of Squared deviations and Harpending's Raggedness index were calculated to test for the goodness of fit of the data in the
mismatch analyses. A parsimony minimum spanning network was constructed using TCS1.21 [28], which is a more
appropriate way than constructing bifurcating phylogenetic trees to view the evolutionary relationship between
closely related haplotypes where ancestry may not be
strictly bifurcating [29].

The time of expansion was calculated with the formula T
= τ/2 μ, where μ = generation time × number of base pairs
per sequence × mutation rate for the marker used [30],
and τ was calculated in Arlequin3.1. Although the generation time of C. caffer is not known, estuarine fishes
(including C. gilchristi) are said to disperse to the marine
environment to join spawning adults after one to three
years residence time in the estuary [31]. Estuarine spawning does; however, occur from time to time [31], and
therefore it is reasonable to assume a generation time of
between one and three years for calculations of divergence
times. A mutation rate of 3.6% per million years is generally used for teleosts [32], although the fast evolving con-

Results
Between 21 and 26 fishes were obtained from each location; a total of 242 individuals (Table 1). After editing and
alignment by eye in BioEdit, 390 base pairs remained for
analyses. There were 26 polymorphic nucleotide positions
(6.67% variable sites), with 20 observed transitions and
eight transversions. Fifty-five haplotypes were recovered,
of which 28 were restricted to single individuals. Haplotype diversity (h) was found to be very high (h = 0.956, ±
0.004) and nucleotide diversity (π), was low (π = 0.010, ±
0.005). Interestingly, theta, as estimated by MIGRATE
[34,35] was lowest for the two peripheral populations at
Wooley's Pool and Haga Haga.
Population structure
Pairwise ΦST values among sampled localities were low
and all but one of these comparisons were not significant
(Jongensfontein and Port Alfred, ΦST = 0.046, P < 0.05).

meaningful as Jongensfontein is in the middle of the distribution range (FCT = 0.022, P < 0.05). No significant relationship between genetic and geographical distance was
detected by the Mantel test (0.072, P > 0.05).

Demographic history
Fu's FS test for all sites was highly negative and significant
(Table 1), as would be expected for populations that have
undergone recent demographic change [37]. The mismatch distribution did not differ significantly from the
null model of sudden expansion, with the observed and

(data not shown). The parsimony haplotype network constructed recovered no clear phylogeographic structure,
indicating panmixia (Figure 2). There are two dominant
haplotypes, each being present in 24 individuals (~10%
of individuals), with representatives from all three biogeographic regions. Although all populations were characterized by between one and five private haplotypes (Table
1), extensive haplotype sharing occurred between the
West Coast, South Coast and East Coast of the southern
African coastline.
When using τ = 3.859 and the 11% per million years
mutation rate for the mtDNA control region [33], the time
of population expansion is estimated to be between 15
000 (3 year generation time) and 45 000 (1 year generation time) years ago, or between 45 800 and 138 000 years
ago when estimated with a more conserved mutation rate
of 3.6% per million years [32].
Migration between sampling localities
Interestingly, coalescent analyses of gene flow revealed
strong asymmetry along the distributional range of C. caffer (Figure 1, Table 2). There was limited gene flow from
western to eastern populations, with strong gene flow
from east to west, suggesting an important influence of
the Agulhas Current. Notably, there is limited gene flow
between Port Alfred and Haga Haga, the two most eastern
populations and all other sampling sites, suggesting that
they are becoming effectively isolated.

Discussion
Demographic history
The mitochondrial control region proved to have sufficient variability for population genetic analysis. The combination of high haplotypic diversity and comparatively
low nucleotide diversity is typical of the signature of population expansion after a bottleneck or a founder event
[37-40], which is generally associated with little or no
population structure [3,40]. Both the mismatch distribution and the significant Fu's FS (-25.6, P < 0.001) support
that for C. caffer both as a species and at the individual
population level has undergone recent population expansion (Table 1). The time of expansion is indicative of a
growing population since the late Pleistocene (275 000 to
15 000 years ago, depending on the mutation rate and
generation time used). Interestingly, similar estimates for
expansion time have been found in other South African
marine organisms, for example the lobsters Palinurus delagoae [41]Palinurus gilchristi [42] and Jasus tristani [43], as
well as a hake species, Merluccius capensis [40], and it is
likely that changing sea levels and temperatures during
this time contributed to demographic changes.

Interestingly, although the two populations at the edge of
C. caffer distribution also show signals of population
expansions, their theta (4Nemμ) values are lower than
when compared to all other sampling sites. This may be a
signal of an expanding population into these areas or
alternatively may reflect source-sink dynamics at the putative range edge of this species.
Population structure and gene flow patterns
SAMOVA failed to identify any biologically meaningful
groups and AMOVA revealed panmixia between populations of all three biogeographic regions. Further, isolation
by distance [44] should not be expected in species with
planktonic larvae that can successfully disperse over great
distances and that are able to exchange individuals
between the populations at the edges of their distribution
ranges [45]. In concordance with this theory, significant
isolation by distance was only found for South African
organisms with possible larval retention or direct development and not for those with pelagic larvae [14-16] including Caffrogobius caffer. As it is highly unlikely that adult C.
caffer disperse over large distances, the only possible dispersal option is that by larvae.

Interestingly, despite the signatures of a mtDNA panmictic population of C. caffer in South Africa, coalescent analyses of gene flow show that there is very limited gene flow
(west to east Nm = 0 (0,0); east to west Nm = 1.5 (0.7, 2.5)
between east coast (Port Alfred and Haga Haga) and all
other populations (Figure 1, Table 2), suggesting that the
east coast is effectively isolated. This is congruent with
gene flow patterns in the clinid fish Clinus cottoides [17],

Page 6 of 9

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:325

where analyses also recovered no gene flow to or from the
east coast populations. This is probably a function of distance between suitable rocky shore habitats. As one moves
towards the east coast of South Africa, rocky shore habitats
become progressively more sparse, with large interspersing tracts of sandy beaches and it probably becomes much
less likely that larvae are able to migrate between populations. One possible reason for the absence of significant
population structure between the east coast and all other
populations is that the reduction in gene flow may be a
geologically recent event, and that not enough time has
passed to fix any subsequent population specific mutations at the mtDNA level.
Notably, the Agulhas Current plays a large role in the
migration patterns of these fishes. There is little gene flow
from west to east, even between closely situated populations. In contrast, extensive gene flow occurs from the east
to the west coast, which is in the direction of the flow of
the Agulhas Current. Some fishes have been shown to utilise the inshore counter-current that runs up the east coast
(sardines; [8] and Clinus cottoides, [17]), yet this is not evident for C. caffer. This may be as a result of a longer pelagic
larval stage, which allows C. caffer to disperse with the
Agulhas Current, unlike fishes which either actively seek
to use the counter-current or that have a very short pelagic
larval stage.
Remarkably, these results contrast sharply to what has
been found for rocky shore and shallow intertidal organisms in South Africa to date, which have shown population genetic structuring irrespective of their life-history
patterns and pelagic larval duration [13-17]. Our most
surprising finding is that gene flow is taking place across
Cape Agulhas, which has been identified as major oceanographic barrier to gene flow in all intertidal and shallow
water inhabitants studied to date [13-15,17]. Based on
these findings it has been stated that oceanography
strongly influences the dispersal potential of marine
organisms in South Africa, possibly more so than having
a pelagic larval stage [15,16]. Our results suggest that C.
caffer has better dispersal abilities than expected (based on
mark-recapture studies of adults) and that this may overcome the effects of such major oceanographic barriers.
Dispersal capabilities of Caffrogobius caffer
Having the capability to release a large amount of eggs
into the open ocean at the best possible time should
greatly increase the chance of effective dispersal between
populations, as in theory it only takes one (practically 5–
10) successful migrant per generation to maintain some
gene flow between populations [45]. In South Africa, larvae of members of the Gobiidae are numerically dominant in the nocturnal ebb tide – a synchronized hatching
strategy used by many estuarine fishes to promote disper-

sal into the ocean [31,46]. Caffrogobius gilchristi in particular can potentially release millions of larvae into the
open ocean during a single tidal cycle, thereby increasing
their dispersal success [46]. As larvae of the genus Caffrogobius have not to date been identified to species level
for all six species in the genus, it is not possible to know
how numerically dominant C. caffer is in the surfwater
(Strydom, personal communication). Judging from its
panmictic mtDNA pattern though, we hypothesise that
the species most probably is as successful as C. gilchristi in
terms of reproductive output and dispersal. Our findings
are suggestive of C. caffer having a longer larval duration
than expected, for it is highly unlikely that individuals
could be exchanged between the East Coast and Southwest Coast within a matter of days if utilizing the largescale Agulhas current system.
Together with larval duration, larval behaviour may also
play an important role in the dispersal abilities of C. caffer,
like it does in many other species [e.g. [4,47]]. Larvae of
cryptobenthic fishes, including individuals from the family Gobiidae, usually possess good swimming and orientation abilities at time of settlement [48,49], which may
greatly alter the expected population connectivity of the
species [50]. Since post-flexion larvae in South African
waters are known to be excellent swimmers [46], the wide
dispersal of C. caffer larvae in local current systems seems
probable.

Conclusion
Our results show that successful dispersal across major
oceanographic barriers such as Cape Agulhas is possible
for some marine species and that availability of habitat is
another key determinant in population structuring of
marine organisms along the South African coast. We have
shown that life-history characteristics could in fact be an
important contributing factor to the population genetic
structuring of marine species in southern Africa and illustrate that the influence on the effective dispersal of marine
organisms is not necessarily suppressed by the effects of
oceanography as has recently been advocated [3,15,16].
