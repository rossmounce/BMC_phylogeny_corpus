Abstract
Background: Overlapping genes (OGs) in bacterial genomes are pairs of adjacent genes of which
the coding sequences overlap partly or entirely. With the rapid accumulation of sequence data,
many OGs in bacterial genomes have now been identified. Indeed, these might prove a consistent
feature across all microbial genomes. Our previous work suggests that OGs can be considered as
robust markers at the whole genome level for the construction of phylogenies. An online,
interactive web server for inferring phylogenies is needed for biologists to analyze phylogenetic
relationships among a set of bacterial genomes of interest.
Description: BPhyOG is an online interactive server for reconstructing the phylogenies of
completely sequenced bacterial genomes on the basis of their shared overlapping genes. It provides
two tree-reconstruction methods: Neighbor Joining (NJ) and Unweighted Pair-Group Method
using Arithmetic averages (UPGMA). Users can apply the desired method to generate phylogenetic
trees, which are based on an evolutionary distance matrix for the selected genomes. The distance
between two genomes is defined by the normalized number of their shared OG pairs. BPhyOG
also allows users to browse the OGs that were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships. It
provides detailed annotation for each OG pair and the features of the component genes through
hyperlinks. Users can also retrieve each of the homologous OG pairs that have been determined
among 177 genomes. It is a useful tool for analyzing the tree of life and overlapping genes from a
genomic standpoint.
Conclusion: BPhyOG is a useful interactive web server for genome-wide inference of any
potential evolutionary relationship among the genomes selected by users. It currently includes 177
completely sequenced bacterial genomes containing 79,855 OG pairs, the annotation and
homologous OG pairs of which are integrated comprehensively. The reliability of phylogenies
complemented by annotations make BPhyOG a powerful web server for genomic and genetic
studies. It is freely available at http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/BPhyOG.

Background
With the increasing availability of genome sequences,
methods using vast amounts of phylogenetic information
contained in complete genome sequences are becoming
standard for inferring species phylogenies reliably.
Because phylogenetic markers extracted from whole
genome resource are based on the maximum genetic
information, a phylogenetic tree should be the best reflection of the evolutionary history of the species [1,2]. To our
knowledge, the evolutionary distance between two different genomes defined by extant phylogenetic markers –
such as gene content and gene order – may not be suitable
for inferring large-scale evolutionary relationships among
microbial genomes, because gene contents have changed
too little and gene order has changed too much [3]. We
previously reported that overlapping genes can provide
interesting additional insights into phylogenetic relationships [4]. As phylogenetic markers, on the one hand, OGs
evidently do not evolve slowly as gene content does
because they are rampant in prokaryotic genomes, even
varying largely among closely-related genomes; on the
other hand, OGs show more evolutionary conservation
than gene order because functional constraints may preserve the linkage between two overlapping genes [3,5-7].
Indeed, OGs are consistent present in all microbial
genomes that have been sequenced to date [8,9]. Therefore, the evolution of these sequences is probably related
to the evolutionary timescale, so they can be used to
reconstruct phylogenies [4].
In addition to their suitability as markers for reconstructing phylogenies, OGs are considered very important for
studying the evolution of prokaryotic genomes. Since the
first OGs was discovered in 1976 in bacteriophage
phiX174 [10], the traditional view has changed; it is now
accepted that different open reading frames (ORFs) can
share common coding regions. Two main evolutionary
explanations of this important phenomenon have been
suggested. Some authors view it as a means of compressing the maximum amount of information into shorter
sequences of structural genes; thus, it may be a result of
evolutionary pressure to minimize genome size and
increase the density of genetic information. Others argue
that it might be a mechanism for regulating gene expression through translational coupling of functionally
related polypeptides [11-14].
Overlaps have also been shown to be potentially important in transcriptional and translational regulation of gene
expression and to influence the evolution of genes [15]. In
prokaryotic genomes, unidirectional (→→) neighbors are
most widely conserved and it is generally accepted that
conserved operons strongly indicate functional associations [9,16,17], so links can be predicted between all conserved OG pairs. Also, if two overlapping genes are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/266

divergently (←→) transcribed with conserved gene orientation, they must be strongly co-regulated [13]. Thus, a
simple and friendly web interface that can provide users
with a convenient way to acquire useful information
about OGs is very desirable.
To satisfy these requirements and to provide an easy-touse platform for phylogenetic inferences, we have developed BPhyOG. This is an interactive web server that can
be used to infer bacterial phylogenies for a set of completely sequenced genomes of interest. It also allows users
to browse the OGs used to infer the phylogenetic relationships, or all the OGs from 177 genomes, and provides
comprehensive annotation and homologous OG pairs on
a large scale. BPhyOG is freely available as an online service and addresses many of the needs described above. The
results of BPhyOG are displayed in easy-to-understand
tabulated and graphical formats.

Construction and content
Data resources
Bacterial genomes without plasmids were downloaded in
the GenBank format from the NCBI ftp server in August
2004. A total of 79,855 overlapping gene pairs were
extracted from the 177 acquired bacterial genomes using
C/C++ scripts. The data are stored in a MySQL database.
Retrieval and identification of overlapping genes
Overlapping genes are defined as adjacent genes, on either
strand, that have coding sequences (CDS regions) sharing
one or more bases. They were extracted from each genome
using PERL scripts according to the annotations. OG pairs
were classified into three directional patterns: 'convergent'
(→←), 'unidirectional' (→→) and 'divergent' (←→).
'Overlap phase type' reflects the corresponding codon
positions that the overlap segment takes in each of the
individual overlapping genes. For example, the overlap
phase type of the OG pair '83333_7' (<yabF, kefC>) is
denoted '<2:3, 1:2>', which means that in gene yabF, the
initial position of the overlap segment is the second
codon position and the terminal position is the third
codon position; and in kefC, the initial and terminal positions are the first and second codon positions, respectively. As we know, misannotated open reading frames
(ORFs) may be included in the genome data. Therefore, to
improve the accuracy of prediction, we defined conserved
homologous OG pairs as those for which the products of
both overlapped genes are not annotated as "hypothetical"
or "putative" or "unknown". However, we still listed all the
OG pairs of any given genome for other possible uses such
as reannotation.

Definition of orthologous overlapping genes and
reconstruction of phylogenies
In our work, we used NCBI BLAST version 2.2.6 [Apr-092003, for Linux IA-64 systems] [18] to look for possible
orthologous genes among the 177 genomes by searching
bidirectional best hits and applying thresholds of e-value
< 10-4 and identity >40%. We then defined orthologous
OG pairs from two different genomes as pairs of genes
that overlap in genome i and have orthologous counterparts that overlap in genome j [4].

The distance between two genomes is defined as:

Dij = 1 −

xij + x ji
2 ∗ min( xi , x j )

i, j = 1, 2,...N

(1)

where xi is the number of OG pairs in genome i, N is the
number of selected species and xij is the number of OG
pairs in genome i with orthologs in genome j. From this
equation, an N × N distant matrix is produced, which
indicates the evolutionary relationship among the
selected N genomes based on the OGs (see [4] for details).
Users can then choose either of the tree-reconstructing
methods, NJ [19] or UPGMA [20], to infer a phylogeny for
the selected genomes.

Utility
We developed an interactive web server named BPhyOG,
which currently contains 177 completely sequenced bacterial genomes. It facilitates reconstruction of whole
genome phylogenies and also allows users to browse OGs
to acquire more information about subtree-specific
genomes or all the 177 genomes. Basically, it comprises
three sections: (i) phylogenetic inference, which is mainly
used to reconstruct phylogenies for a set of genomes of
interest; (ii) OG pairs browse, which allows users to
retrieve annotated information about OG pairs for further
functional or evolutionary studies; and (iii) searching
interface.
Phylogenetic inference
BPhyOG allows users to infer the phylogenetic relationships among a set of genomes on the basis of the number
of orthologous OG pairs; the inferred tree is directly visualized online. It provides two methods for reconstructing
phylogenetic trees: NJ, a general method; and UPGMA.
The latter is more suitable for inferring phylogenies when
the rate of evolution of the phylogenetic marker is relatively constant [21]. Clicking the "Phylogeny Inference"
box shows all 177 genomes listed in a table. When a set of
genomes of interest is selected with a preferred method, a
phylogenetic tree for those genomes can be inferred and
displayed on a new page. As an example, Fig. 1 shows a
phylogenetic tree for 30 gamma-proteobacteria genomes
selected from the table. When the species name is clicked

on the tree visualized on the web, detailed information
about the OG pairs used to infer the phylogenetic relationships is displayed on a new page. Users can then
exploit the evolutionary relationship among two overlapped genes in other subtree-specific genomes to see
whether the linkage has been broken or whether they still
overlap. The inferred phylogenetic tree can also be downloaded in Newick format for further study.
OG pairs browse
Users can browse all OG pairs in a genome, or a particular
OG pair of interest in two ways: through hyperlinks or by
manual searching. The first page obtained by clicking the
"OGs in Genomes" box displays a summary of the 177
bacterial genomes. This page gives basic features of the
genomes including the species name, GenBank accession
number, whole genome sequence size, coding sequence
size, number of ORFs, and number of OG pairs. On clicking the species name, a list of OG pairs with individual
overlapping genes and overlap direction (→←, →→ and
←→) is displayed on a new page. Each "OGid" leads to
detailed information about the corresponding OG pair on
a new page, which comprises two frames (Fig. 2a). The
upper frame lists survey information about the OG pair,
including the number of homologous OG pairs found in
all genomes and the number of links to the list of homologous OG pairs in other genomes (Fig. 2b). Conversely,
all links in the list of homologous OG pairs are provided
to retrieve the description of OG pair and the annotation
of individual genes. The lower frame presents features of
the two overlapping genes such as the start, the end and
the nucleotide sequence of the overlap segment (Fig. 2a).
Searching interface
The searching interfaces are convenient and enable users
to acquire information in several ways. Users can query
whether a gene overlaps with others by entering its name,
or by entering its name and GenBank accession number
together. They can also retrieve a list of OG pairs from a
genome of interest quickly, by entering a GenBank accession number or directly selecting a species name from the
scrolling list. The query results are displayed in tabular
form on a new page and users can study detailed information through further hyperlinks. All hyperlinks are noted
carefully as query assistants.

Discussion
Benchmarking the phylogenies inferred from OG pairs
The overall survey of phylogenies determined by OGs is
likely to provide an accurate glimpse of the "big picture"
of the tree of life for bacteria. It suggests that the number
of OGs in each bacterial genome is commensurate with
the number of ORFs (see Additional file 1). Fukuda et al.
and Johnson et al. also showed that the evolution of overlapping gene structures may be related to the evolutionary

time scale [7-9]. Therefore, assuming a universal rate of
formation and degradation of OGs across species, we can
determine the evolutionary distance between two bacterial genomes on the basis of the number of their shared
OG pairs. We designed an interactive web server,
BPhyOG, to reconstruct whole genome phylogenies on
the basis of overlapping genes.
BPhyOG provides users with two methods to infer phylogenies, namely UPGMA and NJ. As an example, we
selected 30 gamma-proteobacteria. The left hand side of
Fig. 1 shows the phylogenetic tree inferred by UPGMA, as
visualized on the webpage, for the 30 gamma-proteobacteria genomes. Benchmarking the UPGMA tree with the
tree based on 16S rRNA sequences (see Additional file 2,
(a) for a simple 16S rRNA tree of these taxa, and (b) for
the OG tree generated using UPGMA; the Newick format

treefile was downloaded from the webpage), two tree
topologies were derived that differed mainly in the positions of three endosymbionts (Buchnera aphidicola str. Sg,
B. aphidicola str. APS and B. aphidicola str. Bp), Escherichia
coli K12 and Haemophilus ducreyi. Our tree based on OG
pairs considered the four E. coli strains to be monophyletic, whereas the 16S rRNA tree placed the E. coli K12
strain closer to Shigella flexneri. This demonstrates that
OGs as phylogenetic markers offer high taxonomic resolution. In addition, our OG tree confirms that the Buchnera
order is a sib-group of E. coli and Salmonella rather than to
Yersinia pestis, which is consistent with previous studies
[22,23]. However, Haemophilus was placed as a sib of the
Pseudomonas order, which does not agree with current
classifications. This may be because the genome of Haemophilus is too small for our measure to obtain an accurate
evolutionary distance.

Tracking the conservation of OG pairs used to infer
phylogenetic relationships
Besides inferring phylogenetic trees for whole genomes,
BPhyOG provides an easy-to-use interface for users to
track the conservation of OG pairs by exploring homologous pairs in subtree-specific genomes. As a case study, the
phylogeny of 30 gamma-proteobacteria genomes was
inferred and visualized on the webpage. When the species
name, such as Escherichia coli K12, was clicked, a set of
conserved OG pairs was listed in a table (the right upper
panel of Fig. 1). Then, by clicking on any "OGid" of interest, e.g. "83333_44" (<fhiA, mbhA>), a new page with two
frames was opened. The top frame showed the features of
the queried OG pair "83333_44" and the lower frame
showed the list of OG pairs homologous to "83333_44" in
the subtree-specific genomes (Fig. 1). From the list in the
lower frame, we can see that the two overlapping genes
(fhiA and mbhA) in "83333_44" still overlap in three other
E. coli strains (NC_002695, NC_004431 and
NC_002600)
and
in
two
Shigella
flexneri
strains(NC_004741 and NC_004337), whereas the linkage has been broken in Yersinia pestis strain CO92
(NC_000913) and lost in the remaining 23 gamma-proteobacteria genomes.

Operating system(s): Available as web-based service,
accessible via any web-browser

In summary, BPhyOG is a useful server for studying evolutionary relationships among whole genomes and
exploring information about the OGs used to infer phylogenetic relationships. Although at present it addresses
only bacteria, we anticipate that BPhyOG will expand to
contain more completely sequenced archaeal and eukaryotic genomes. It may also be useful, though challenging,
to allow users to infer variant phylogenies for a set of
selected genomes by changing the criteria for homologous
comparison.

UPGMA: Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic Averages

Conclusion
BPhyOG is an interactive online server for reconstructing
whole genome phylogenies. It allows users to infer phylogenies for any set of genomes of interest to study their
evolutionary relationships by visualizing the tree directly
on the web, or provides a Newick format treefile for further study. BPhyOG also allows users to retrieve information about OGs, as well as homologous OG pairs, in
subtree-specific genomes or the whole set of genomes.
The current version (V-1.0) of BPhyOG contains 177 completely sequenced bacterial genomes and 79,855 OG pairs
are involved. BPhyOG will be updated once every 1–2
years if the computing power in our laboratory allows.
