Abstract
Background: Chlamydiosis and Q fever, two zoonosis, are important causes of ruminants'
abortion around the world. They are caused respectively by strictly intracellular and Gram negative
bacterium Chlamydophila abortus (Cp. abortus) and Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii). Chlamydophila
pecorum (Cp. pecorum) is commonly isolated from the digestive tract of clinically inconspicuous
ruminants but the abortive and zoonotic impact of this bacterium is still unknown because Cp.
pecorum is rarely suspected in abortion cases of small ruminants. We have developed a multiplex
PCR (m-PCR) for rapid simultaneous differential detection of Cp. abortus, Cp. pecorum and C. burnetii
in clinical samples taken from infected animals.
Results: Specific PCR primers were designed and a sensitive and specific m-PCR was developed
to detect simultaneously, in one tube reaction, three specific fragments of 821, 526 and 687-bp long
for Cp. abortus, Cp. pecorum and C. burnetii respectively. This m-PCR assay was performed on 253
clinical samples taken from infected ruminant's flocks that have showed problems of abortion
diseases. Thus, 67 samples were infected by either one of the three pathogens: 16 (13 vaginal swabs
and 3 placentas) were positive for Cp. abortus, 2 were positive for Cp. pecorum (1 vaginal swab and
1 placenta) and 49 samples (33 vaginal swabs, 11 raw milks, 4 faeces and 1 placenta) were positive
for C. burnetii. Two vaginal swabs were m-PCR positive of both Cp. abortus and C. burnetii and none
of the tested samples was shown to be infected simultaneously with the three pathogens.
Conclusion: We have successfully developed a rapid multiplex PCR that can detect and
differentiate Cp. abortus, Cp. pecorum and C. burnetii; with a good sensitivity and specificity. The
diagnosis of chlamydiosis and Q fever may be greatly simplified and performed at low cost. In
addition, the improvement in diagnostic techniques will enhance our knowledge regarding the
prevalence and the pathogenetic significance of Q fever and chlamydiosis.

Background
Chlamydiosis and Q fever, two zoonosis, are widely distributed around the world. Their importance is related not
only to the economic losses in animal production, but
also to risks posed to humans [1,2]. They are caused
respectively by strictly intracellular and Gram negative
bacterium Chlamydophila and Coxiella burnetii. Although
C. burnetii and Chlamydophila belong to phylogenetically
unrelated species [3], they show some similarities in their
interaction with the host and pathogenesis of the infection [4]. Chlamydiaceae family is composed of nine species recognized within the two genera of Chlamydia and
Chlamydophila [5] which are associated with a large variety
of diseases in animals and humans including abortion,
pneumonia, gastroenteritis, encephalomyelitis, conjunctivitis, arthritis and sexually transmitted diseases [6]. The
reservoir is large and includes many wild and domestic
mammals but domestic ruminants such as sheep, cattle
and goat represent the most frequent source of human
infection. Two species of the genus Chlamydophila cause
diseases in ruminants, Chlamydophila abortus (formerly
Chlamydia psittaci serotype 1) and Chlamydophila pecorum
(formerly Chlamydia pecorum). Cp. abortus has an affinity
for placenta tissue and is an important cause of reproductive disorders such as abortion or premature births in
pregnant sheep, goat and is also hazardous for pregnant
women [1,6]. Although Cp. pecorum is commonly isolated
from the digestive tract of clinically inconspicuous ruminants, this bacterium was recognized to be as a cause of
fertility disorders, conjunctivitis, arthritis, mastitis, pulmonary inflammation, in sheep, goat and cattle [7-10].
Although the role of Cp. abortus and C burnetii as aetiological agents of abortion has been clearly established in
humans and ruminants, the abortive and zoonotic impact
of Cp. pecorum is still unknown. Nevertheless, Cp. pecorum
involvement in small ruminants abortion cases has been
previously reported, almost 20 years ago, in south of
France [11]. Recently, during the course of collaboration
studies between our laboratory and veterinary institutes of
Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, Cp. pecorum strains were
isolated from abortion cases of goat [12] and sheep
(unpublished data) suggesting that this bacterium might
be involved in small ruminants abortion in North African
countries.
Like chlamydiosis, the main reservoir of human Q fever is
infected ruminants that shed C. burnetii into the environment during normal delivery or abortion through the
amniotic fluids and the placenta as well as via faeces and
milk [13,14]. The transmission of infections to humans is
mainly due to the inhalation of contaminated aerosols,
but may also occur following the consumption of raw
milk and dairy products [15,16]. Furthermore, contaminated faecal samples and manure brought from a farms
housing infected ruminants have been involved as sources
of humans Q fever [17]. Improved diagnostic methods of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/130

Chlamydia and Coxiella detection is required to prevent
both human and animal contamination. Chlamydiosis
and Q fever diagnosis is usually established by bacterioscopic examination of stained placenta smears which are
poorly sensitive and not specific. Isolation is also
employed, but it is difficult, time consuming, hazardous,
and the organism requires level 3 (P3) containment facilities for propagation. The simplest methods for detecting
infected animals rely on the detection of Coxiella and
Chlamydia antibodies in animal sera, such by immunofluorescence, ELISA and the complement fixation tests. These
methods are presumptive and rely on time for antibody
production to occur; thus, they are not early-detection
methods. Furthermore, cross-reactivity between C. burnetii and Chlamydia strains in ELISA and immunoblot
analysis was observed [18]. Molecular methods such as
PCR have been developed for each individual pathogen
and have demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity
[19-21]. A duplex PCR was recently developed to simultaneously detect Cp. abortus and C. burnetii in broad range of
abortion products in cattle [22]. Thus, we decided to
develop a rapid, economic, sensitive, and specific multiplex PCR (m-PCR) for simultaneous detection and differentiation of Cp. abortus, Cp. pecorum and C. burnetii in
clinical samples of ruminants. The application of this
improved PCR test will enable accurate, epidemiological
and prevalence data of Chlamydiosis and Q fever, which
in turn will lead to an increase the efficiency of animal
production and reduction in zoonotic transmission to
humans.

Methods
Chlamydophila and Coxiella burnetii strains
Twenty strains of Cp. abortus, 5 strains of Cp. pecorum, and
4 strains of C. burnetii including the reference strain Cp.
abortus AB7, Cp. pecorum iB1 and C. burnetii Nine-Miles
were used in this study. All these strains were isolated
from ruminants except Nine Miles, which was isolated
from ticks.
Animals
In this study, a total of 11 sheep and goat flocks were
investigated including seven flocks located in five different regions of Tunisia, 3 flocks located in two different
regions of France (Touraine and Alpes-de-Hautes-Provence) and the flock belonging to the experimental unit of
INRA Research Centre of Tours-Nouzilly (France) where
Chlamydiosis and Q fever-related abortions were suspected. Q fever and Chlamydiosis serological responses
were tested in each flock on 20 selected animals, including
all females that aborted and some females that delivered
normally using ELISA tests (Pourquier, Montpellier,
France) and (CHEKITR, Hoechst Roussel Vet, France)
respectively following the manufacturer recommendations.

Collection and clinical sample preparation
The samples used in this study are listed in Table 1. A total
of 253 clinical samples were taken from all animals that
aborted and among both ELISA positive and negative animals that delivered normally. Thus, 72 clinical samples
were collected by the Institute of Veterinary Research of
Tunisia and a total of 102 samples were obtained from a
group of reproduction of 34 ewes belonging to the experimental unit of INRA Research Centre of Tours-Nouzilly
(France). The French county veterinary laboratories of
Touraine (VCL37) and of Alpes-de-Hautes-Provence
(VCL04) collected 5 placentas and a total of 74 samples,
respectively. The gestation statue of the sampled animals
was recorded and all tested animals were identified and
correlated with the serology result and the samples were
analysed by PCR. DNA preparation and purification were
performed following the protocol described by [23].
PCR analysis
Primers
All primers used in this study were synthesized by SigmaGenosys (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France).
The name, sequence, target gene, the predicted amplified
fragment, as well as the melting temperature are listed in
Table 2. Primers pmp F and pmp 821R were designed
from the four pmp gene sequences of Cp. abortus S26/3
strain [24]. RAPD-PCR analysis was used to investigate the
molecular epidemiology of several isolates of Chlamydophila and, as shown, Cp. pecorum strains were distinguished from the others by the presence of 650-bp specific
fragment in electrophoresis [25]. A set of CpcF and CpcR
primers were designed based on the DNA sequencing of
this fragment in order to obtain Cp. pecorum specific

amplification product. Trans-1 and Trans-2 PCR primers
were described previously and designed based on the
transposon like repetitive region of C. burnetii [26].
PCR conditions
Precautions were taken to use sterile reagents and conditions, and contamination of reactions by PCR product
was avoided by strict separation of working areas and use
of filter pipette tips. The optimal PCR conditions for Cp.
abortus, Cp. pecorum or C. burnetii individual amplification
were initially determined separately using serial dilutions
of respective DNA solution. PCR reactions were carried
out in a final volume of 25 μl containing 1× PCR buffer
(Promega, Charbonnières-Les-Bains, France), 0.5 μM of
each primer set, 200 μM of the four deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP), 2 mM MgCl2 and
0.5 U of Taq polymerase (Promega, Charbonnières-LesBains, France). PCR reactions were performed in an automated DNA thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Le Pecq, France).
After an initial denaturation period of 10 min at 94°C,
reactions were subjected to 35 cycles of 30 sec at 94°C, 1
min at an annealing temperature of 63°C for Cp. abortus,
62°C for Cp. pecorum and 64°C for C. burnetii, then 72°C
for 1 min with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min.
m-PCR conditions
In order to simultaneously detect the three bacteria, the
reactions were subsequently combined to develop a onestep reaction. Testing different combinations of the reaction mixture components allowed the performing an optimization of the multiplex PCR assay (m-PCR). A good
intensity of the amplified fragment for each target DNA as
well as the absence of unspecific bands were considered in

selecting the optimal m-PCR conditions. Thus, the best
results were obtained when the final concentration of the
three primer sets, MgCl2, and Taq polymerase was
increased respectively to 0.8 μM, 3 mM and to 1.5 U and
the m-PCR was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl. The
thermal cycler parameters of the m-PCR were similar to
those of the individual PCR using 61°C as an optimal
annealing temperature. Positive and negative control
DNA samples were run in each experiment. PCR products
were analyzed in 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained
with ethidium bromide and visualised with ultraviolet
transillumination. All PCR reactions assessing limits of
detection or specificity were performed in duplicate.
Sensitivity and specificity of the m-PCR
Sensitivity of the PCR assay was checked using serial fold
dilutions of bacterial suspension of references strains AB7,
iB1 and Nine-Miles at 107 bacteria per ml. Simulated positive samples were also obtained by adding 50 μl of bacterial suspension dilution to 50 μl of bacteria-free vaginal
swab extract or milk sample. These preparations were then
submitted to extraction procedures and to simplex and mPCR as described above.

The specificity of the PCR was assessed on 20 strains of Cp.
abortus, 5 strains of Cp. pecorum and, 4 strains of C. burnetii
from our laboratory bacteria collection and on some isolates suspected to be present into tested clinical samples:
Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis, Escherichia
coli, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenese, Salmonella abortus ovis, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus
chromogenese,
Staphylococcus
hominis,
Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus ogalactiae, Mycobacterium avium, Legionella pneumophila. In addition,
RFLP-PCR analysis was carried out as a confirmatory test
for the PCR reaction specificity. Thus, 10 μl of amplification products obtained from naturally infected clinical
samples and those obtained from 102 genomic DNA templates of the reference strains AB7, IB 1, Nine Miles were
subjected to 5 units of AluI restriction enzyme (Promega,
Charbonnières-Les-Bains, France) in a 20 μl final volume
for 3 hours at 37°C. The digested products were examined

by using 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide
and viewed under UV illumination. In addition, PCR
products amplified from clinical samples were purified
with a QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and directly sequenced with an ABI
PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Isolation of Chlamydophila and Coxiella strains
Pathogen isolation was performed to confirm the presence of the involved bacteria, on 20-different PCR positive
samples showing high ethidium bromide intensity on
agarose gel. Chlamydophila strains isolation were performed using both plaque assays and blind passages on
McCoy monolayer cell cultures [27]. Briefly, PCR positive
samples for Cp. abortus or Cp. pecorum were first diluted to
1:10 and subsequently used in a plaque assay. Furthermore, 500 μl of this suspension was added to McCoy cell
monolayers in 25 cm2 flasks to perform the blind passage
assay. The positive culture and plaque cloned Chlamydophila were then grown in specific pathogen-free eggs, the
yolk sacs were harvested one week later and the bacteria
were purified and stored at -80°C. C. burnetii strains were
isolated by intraperitoneal inoculation of OFI mice then
on embryonated hen eggs [28]. Briefly, 3 OF1 mice (8
weeks old) were inoculated with 0.2 mL of vaginal swab
extract or milk sample tested positive in PCR. The mice
were killed nine days post inoculation and the spleens
were sampled and reinoculated into 6-days-old, specific
pathogen-free embryonated hen eggs. The infected yolk
sacs of dead and viable embryos were harvested between
8 and 10 days after inoculation, aliquoted and frozen at 80°C. Genomic DNA of isolated chlamydophila and Coxiella was prepared using a QIAmp DNA mini Kit (Qiagen,
Courtaboeuf, France) following the manufacturer's recommendations and characterized using RFLP-PCR
method of 16S–23S rRNA intergenic region [29].

ence strains of Cp. abortus, Cp. pecorum, and C. burnetii
resulted in a micro-organism-specific identification of the
target sequence. The amplification conditions and master
mixture components were optimized to amplify all DNA
as singlet, in different combinations as duplexes or as triplex of three target sequences (Figure 1). With a primer
concentration of 0.8 μM, 1.5 U of Taq polymerase, 3 mM
of MgCl2 and an annealing temperature of 61°C, m-PCR
produced simultaneously in one tube reaction, three specific fragments of 821, 526 and 687-bp long for Cp. abortus, Cp. pecorum and for C. burnetii, respectively. No mPCR product was generated using water instead of target
DNA (Figure 1)
Sensitivity and specificity of PCR
m-PCR, as well as duplex or single PCR performed on reference strain (AB7, iB1 and Nine-Miles) purified DNA
with the same primers, detected as little as 50 genome
copies per PCR reaction (Figure 2). Experimental contamination of clinical samples with decreasing amounts of
bacteria was performed for the evaluation of the detection
threshold of the PCR technique. Both vaginal swab and
milk samples did not interfere with m-PCR performance,
since the same detection threshold was observed (data not
shown). The specificity of the m-PCR assay was examined
by isolating genomic DNA from 20 different Cp. abortus, 5
Cp. pecorum, and 4 C. burnetii strains. The m-PCR specificity was satisfactory as all Chlamydophila and Coxiella
tested strains gave specific PCR product. However no
amplification was noted using DNA from any of the other
bacterial pathogens suspected to be present into tested
clinical samples (data not shown). PCR products

m-PCR analysis of clinical samples
Purified DNA from a total of 253 biological samples
obtained from ruminant herds known to be infected with
Chlamydophila or Coxiella was analyzed by m-PCR. Overall, 67 samples were tested PCR positive for at least one of
the three pathogens: 16 (24%) samples (13 vaginal swabs
and 3 placentas) were positive for Cp. abortus, 2 (3%) samples were positive for Cp. pecorum (1 vaginal swab and 1
placenta) and 49 (73%) samples (33 vaginal swabs, 11
raw milks, 4 faeces and 1 placenta) were positive for C.
burnetii. No simultaneous infection with the three bacteria
was observed. However, two vaginal swabs taken from a
sheep flock were positive for both Cp. abortus and C. burnetii. Among the 67 samples tested positive by m-PCR, 42

(63%) were taken from ruminants that aborted while 25
(37%) were collected from animals that lambed normally. In addition, 14 (21%) of the PCR positive ruminants were serologically negative.
Bacterial isolation
Chlamydophila and Coxiella isolation attempts were performed on 20 different PCR positive samples to confirm
the presence of the involved bacteria. Using blind passages on McCoy monolayer cell culture then in specific
pathogen-free eggs, three Chlamydophila isolates were
obtained successfully from vaginal swabs taken from ewes
that aborted. The RFLP-PCR of 16S–23S rRNA intergenic
region showed that the three isolates belonged to Chlamydophila family including two Cp. abortus (named ABt5 and
Bell2) and one Cp. pecorum (named AKt). In addition, the
intraperitoneal inoculation of OFI mice then on embryonated hen eggs led to the successful isolation of two characteristic C. burnetii strains, CBO7 and CBO8 from vaginal
swab and from milk samples of aborted ewes respectively.

Discussion
Previous studies have reported C. burnetii [19] and Cp.
abortus [20] detection in clinical samples taken from
sheep flocks after lambing or abortion. Clinically unapparent intestinal infections caused by Cp. pecorum have
also been reported to be prevalent in both abortionaffected and unaffected ruminant flocks [1,30]. In addition, a recent study has shown that Cp. pecorum was more
widespread in cattle than C. abortus, and the bacteria were
frequently detected in vaginal swabs and faecal samples
[31]. Thus, it is necessary to have an approach that can

detect and differentiate all relevant organisms using the
same sample and the same assay. A highly sensitive realtime PCR method suitable for large-throughput routine
detection, quantification, and differentiation of chlamydophila DNA from vaginal swab and milk samples was established [32]. In addition, a DNA microarray probe assay,
based on highly discriminatory sequences of the 23S
rRNA gene, was used for Chlamydia and Chlamydophila
identification and all various species differentiation from
clinical samples [33]. The clinical features of abortion
caused by Cp. abortus and C. burnetii are very similar and
such mixed infections have been suggested to be a common occurrence in sheep and goat flocks [34]. A duplex
real time PCR was developed to simultaneously detect Cp.
abortus and C. burnetii in broad range of abortion products
of cattle [22]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first
study to test the ability of a multiplex PCR assay to detect
and, identify the presence simultaneously of Cp. abortus,
Cp. pecorum and C. burnetii in herds as well as in individual animals.
Preferential amplification of one target sequence over
another is a known phenomenon in multiplex PCRs and
a loss of sensitivity is often observed when combined a
large number of primer sets in a single reaction. In this
study, the PCR reaction conditions were carefully optimised and, the ratio of each primer pair was adjusted to
obtain maximum sensitivity. Despite the presence of three
primer sets in the PCR mixture, the m-PCR was able to
detect all tested bacteria at a high level of sensitivity. The
amplification experiments performed with both purified
genomic DNA of bacteria and with spiked clinical samples

allowed to obtain a detection limit of 50 genome copies
per PCR reaction which is acceptable for diagnostic use.
Due to the lack of comparative data and, to the absence of
a gold standard for the molecular diagnosis of the three
pathogens, it was difficult to compare the efficiency of this
m-PCR with other PCR methods previously described.
However, the data obtained in this study showed that our
m-PCR was ten-fold less sensitive than the real-time multiplex-PCR assays already described for Chlamydios and
Q fever [31,33,35,22]. The sensitivity of this assay could
be further increased by adapting the m-PCR to a real-time
multiplex PCR format. Real-time quantitative PCR methods offer an attractive advantage, in the clinical diagnostic
laboratory, to detect and quantify multiple pathogens
simultaneously. However, the routine and the highthroughput analysis cost remains very high, especially for
emerging countries. Attempts to isolate Chlamydophila and
Coxiella strains were performed on 20-different PCR positive samples to confirm the presence of the involved bacteria and to compare the efficacy of the two diagnostic
methods as well. All attempts to pathogen isolation were
not successful and, only two Cp. abortus, one Cp. pecorum
and two C. burnetii strains isolates were obtained from
vaginal swabs and milk samples. Fifteen m-PCR positive
samples were negative upon selective culture suggesting
that the m-PCR method detected bacteria that are unable
to grow in vitro. In our study, the investigated animals
were already receiving antibiotic therapy at the time of
sampling. When antibiotic treatment compromises the
chance of bacterial isolation, PCR detection is not affected
by the lack of viability of the microorganism and is more
sensitive than culture for the detection of non-viable
organisms and cellular DNA that have not been cleared.
The performance of the m-PCR in field studies with
infected flocks that reported the occurrence of the two
zoonotic diseases further validates its use as an optimal
tool for surveillance for chlamydiosis and Q fever. Thus,
our investigation showed that these two infections were
widespread within the tested flocks as evidenced by the
presence of the Cp. abortus and C. burnetii m-PCR products
in over 25% of the tested clinical samples. Two vaginal
swab samples were contaminated with both Cp. abortus
and C. burnetii and the ability of the multiplex assay to
detect dual infections was therefore known. Recently, an
outbreak of enzootic abortion in ovine and caprine herds
caused by mixed infections was reported and both Cp.
abortus and C. burnetii were simultaneously detected,
using a simplex PCR, in aborted female placentas and foetuses [36]. During our study, the developed m-PCR
allowed the detection of Cp. pecorum strain in vaginal
swab taken from a female ewe that had aborted in one
Tunisian flock. The RFLP-PCR analysis of 16S–23S rRNA
intergenic region confirmed that the isolated strain
belonged to Cp. pecorum specie. These data and those

reported previously regarding Cp. pecorum involvement in
abortion in Tunisia and in Morocco (unpublished data)
indicated that Cp. pecorum may cause abortion in small
ruminants in North Africa countries. Cp. pecorum pathogenicity may be associated with nutritional deficiency or
parasitic infestations as are often encountered in theses
countries. It could be also considered that no pathogenic
Cp. pecorum strains might be spread from the intestine
through the blood circulation because of some unknown
physiopathologic events and reach the placenta where
they induce abortion. The recent finding that mixed infection with Cp. abortus and Cp. pecorum was associated with
abortion in water buffalo cows in the southern of Italy
[37] suggests that Cp. pecorum could also be involved in
abortion in large ruminants. Nevertheless, it is still
unknown whether or not Cp. pecorum-related abortion
might be either a consequence of Cp. pecorum alone or an
enhancement of its pathogenesis mediated by the coinfection with Cp. abortus.

Conclusion
The m-PCR assay developed in this study provides a new
tool for Chlamydiosis and Q fever diagnosis. The usefulness of this assay to detect the animals that actively shed
the bacteria may prevent animal, human, and environment contamination. In addition, since Cp. pecorum infection is still not well understood, this m-PCR may yield
new insights into the pathogenesis of Chlamydiosis disease.
