Abstract
Background: Endogenous non-coding small RNAs (21-24 nt) play an important role in post-transcriptional gene
regulation in plants. Domestication selection is the most important evolutionary force in shaping crop genomes. The
extent of polymorphism at small RNA loci in domesticated rice and whether small RNA loci are targets of
domestication selection have not yet been determined.
Results: A polymorphism survey of 94 small RNA loci (88 MIRNAs, four TAS3 loci and two miRNA-like long hairpins) was
conducted in domesticated rice, generating 2 Mb of sequence data. Many mutations (substitution or insertion/
deletion) were observed at small RNA loci in domesticated rice, e.g. 12 mutation sites were observed in the mature
miRNA sequences of 11 MIRNAs (12.5% of the investigated MIRNAs). Several small RNA loci showed significant signals
for positive selection and/or potential domestication selection.
Conclusions: Sequence variation at miRNAs and other small RNAs is higher than expected in domesticated rice. Like
protein-coding genes, non-coding small RNA loci could be targets of domestication selection and play an important
role in rice domestication and improvement.
Background
Endogenous non-coding small RNAs (21-24 nt) play an
important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation in
plants. In general, small RNAs are grouped into two
major classes, microRNAs (miRNAs) and short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) based on the mechanisms by which
they are synthesized and function [1]. miRNAs are generated from a stem-loop primary transcript by the endonuclease Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) and its partners. To date, 414
miRNAs from 151 miRNA families (miRBase, http://
microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/, Release 14.0), including several natural antisense miRNAs (nat-miRNAs) and
a mitron, have been identified in rice [2,3]. siRNAs derive
from double-stranded RNA precursors that are processed
mainly by the endonucleases DCL2, DCL3 and/or DCL4
[4]. Several types of siRNAs, such as trans-acting siRNAs
(ta-siRNAs), natural antisense transcript-derived siRNAs
(nat-siRNAs), repeat-associated siRNAs (ra-siRNAs) and

miRNA-like long hairpin siRNAs, have been identified in
rice and other plants [3,5-13].
mRNAs are regulated by several classes of small RNAs
through base complementarity leading to cleavage or
repression of translation of the mRNA. It has been
observed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
within a miRNA binding site can cause significant phenotypic changes [14]. Genome-wide investigation of nucleotide variation at small RNA loci can determine the
prevalence of functional variations in a species; this was
first assessed in humans [15]. In plants, a large-scale survey of miRNA polymorphism has been performed in
Arabidopsis [16]. This survey showed that mutations in
mature miRNA sequences are rare and that the level of
polymorphism in miRNAs is lower than in their flanking
regions, suggesting purifying selection in the miRNA
sequences. Evidence of positive selection on some
miRNA loci has been found in Arabidopsis [16,17]. Our
previous studies on rice miRNAs and miRNA binding
sites suggested that positive selection and nucleotide
mutations play an important role in co-evolution of miRNAs and their targets [18,19].

Despite the importance of small RNAs in regulation of
development in crops, investigation of polymorphism of
miRNAs and other small RNAs in rice and other crops is
still in its infancy. The extent of sequence variation at
functional regions of small RNAs and their potential contribution to phenotypic evolution during crop domestication are unclear. Unlike Arabidopsis, rice has experienced
domestication and subsequent artificial genetic improvement and therefore has been shaped by an additional bottleneck effect. Rice is believed to have been domesticated
approximately 10,000 years ago [20,21]. Several proteincoding genes controlling domestication traits have been
identified and a notable feature of these domestication
genes is that they generally encode transcription factors
that regulate other protein-coding genes by direct binding to their DNA [22]. Most conserved miRNAs target
transcription factors with an important role in plant
development [1], but whether miRNAs and other types of
non-coding small RNAs are targets of domestication
selection in crops is yet to be determined.
In this study, we carried out an investigation of
sequence variation and selection of small RNAs in
domesticated rice by two steps (Figure 1). Firstly, we
selected 94 small RNA generating loci (including MIRNAs, TAS3 and miRNA-like long hairpin loci) and analyzed their sequence variation and neutrality within a
domesticated rice population of 33 accessions, and secondly, we further investigated 20 of the 94 small RNA loci
in populations of 54 cultivated rice accessions and 15 wild
rice accessions to determine how many of these loci
might have experienced domestication selection. Our
results suggest a non-neutral evolutionary pattern of
small RNAs in the cultivated rice and that several of them
are putative targets of selection during rice domestication.

Results
Nucleotide divergence and neutrality of small RNAs

A total of 94 small RNA loci, including 88 MIRNAs from
40 miRNA families, four members of the TAS3 family and
two miRNA-like long hairpins, were selected for a polymorphism survey of rice small RNAs (Additional file 1).
With the exception of the two miRNA-like long hairpins,
genomic fragments containing the intact precursor
sequences of the small RNAs were amplified and
sequenced from a population of 33 domesticated rice
accessions (17 indica and 16 japonica cultivars), which
were collected from diverse geographic locations (Additional file 2). For the two miRNA-like long hairpins which
have large loop regions, the two stem regions were amplified and sequenced. Fragments from each rice accession
were aligned to each other for each small RNA locus. The
average fragment length of all alignments was 579.0 bp,

this study. At the first step, 94 small RNA generating loci were selected
and their sequence variation and neutrality were estimated using a
population of 33 domesticated rice accessions (see Figures 2, 3 and 4;
Additional files 3, 4 and 5). At the second step, 20 small RNA loci were
selected from the 94 small RNA loci and their sequence diversity and
potential for having been under domestication selection (see Table 1)
were further investigated using a cultivated population (54 accessions)
and a wild population (15 accessions).

which covered the precursor sequences of the investigated small RNAs (Additional file 3).
Of the 88 investigated MIRNA genes, 11 (12.5%)
showed SNPs or insertion/deletions (indels) within their
mature miRNA sequences in the cultivated rice population (Additional file 4), leading to an average number of
SNPs per 1000 sites of 1.52 ± 0.51 (mean ± SE of the
mean) or an average pairwise nucleotide diversity (π) of
0.00169 ± 0.00067 (Figure 2A and 2B). As an example, the

polymorphic mature sequence of the miR166 family is
presented in Figure 3 (further details are shown in Additional file 3 and 4). A SNP was observed at the fourth
position from the 5' end of the mature sequences of
miR166e. Out of the 32 cultivated indica and japonica
accessions investigated, 17 including indica cultivar 9311 and wild rice had the same miR166e sequence (with G
at the fourth position) as in miRBase http://
microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/, while 15 had an A at
the fourth position (Figure 3). In all other members of the
miR166 family the fourth base is G (Figure 3). These
results suggest that the fourth position A could be a
recent mutation. It would be interesting to determine
whether this mutation has an impact on the interaction
between miR166e and its targets because it results in a
perfect match with the predicted targets at the fourth
position. From our sequencing data for miR166e target
genes and the recently released rice SNP data http://
www.oryzasnp.org[23], a SNP was found at the tenth
position (counting from the 5' end of miR166e) of the
miR166e binding site in Os03 g16320, one of the predicted miR166e targets, in 20% of accessions investigated.
miRNA-mediated cleavage takes place between positions
10 and 11, a mutation from C to G at the tenth position
might abolish miR166e-mediated cleavage of Os03
g16320 in these accessions, but whether this change has a
consequence on rice depends on the specific interaction
between miR166e and Os03 g16320 because Os03 g16320

could still be regulated by other members of the miR166
family.
In addition to the mature miRNA sequences, many
SNPs were also observed in the flanking regions of miRNAs. Compared to the mature miRNA sequences, significantly higher SNP densities or diversities were observed
in the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) sequences, but the
highest polymorphism was found in the upstream or
downstream region of pre-miRNAs (Figure 2A and 2B).
These results suggest that purifying selection was the
predominant evolutionary force acting on miRNA
sequences in rice as reported for Arabidopsis [16]. Some
miRNAs are conserved in both dicot and monocot plants
while others are species-specific. Of the 88 MIRNA genes
investigated in this study, 64 are conserved and 17 are
rice-specific (Additional file 1). A dramatic difference in
nucleotide diversities in the mature miRNAs and their
flanking regions was observed between the conserved
and rice-specific MIRNA loci (Figure 2C and 2D). The
nucleotide diversity of the rice-specific MIRNAs was
nearly twice that of the conserved MIRNAs. However, no
significant difference in nucleotide diversity could be
found in the miRNAs from the two subspecies of cultivated rice although the average number of SNPs per site
of the indica subgroup was slightly lower than that of the
japonica subgroup in both the mature miRNA and its
flanking regions (Figure 2E and 2F).

accessions with different genotypes in cultivated and wild populations are shown on the right side. For further details see Additional file 3 and 4.

Polymorphisms were also found in the functional
regions of siRNA-generating loci in rice, for example, at
phases P5'_5 and P5'_9 of a miRNA-like long hairpin
(AK120922), and in ta-siARF and the 3' miR390 binding
site of TAS3a2 (Additional file 5).
To examine neutrality of small RNAs in rice, Tajima's D
[24], a widely used neutrality test, was employed. Tajima's
D test measures the frequency distribution of polymorphisms and selection is expected to skew the population
frequency of genetic variants relative to the neutral equilibrium model (NE). Under NE, the mean Tajima's D is
expected to be zero and a negative value indicates an
excess of rare sequence variants relative to NE expectation and a recent positive selection is thus inferred. In
contrast to positive selection, balanced selection retains
genetic differences and elevates the Tajima's D statistic
towards a positive value [25].
For each small RNA locus, Tajima's D was calculated
for the miRNA- or siRNA-containing sequence fragment.
A slightly skewed distribution of Tajima's D values was
observed in domesticated rice (Figure 4), which is similar
to that observed in Arabidopsis [16]. Significant probabilities of non-neutral patterns of sequence variation were
detected at several loci in one or both subgroups of the
cultivated rice (Additional file 3). Significantly negative
values were found for several small RNAs, such as
miR395a/b and TAS3a2 (Tajima's D value: -2.21 and 2.01) in the indica subgroup, suggesting that these small
RNA loci could have experienced positive selection during rice evolution. On the other hand, some small RNA
loci possessed an extreme positive Tajima's D value (e.g.
1.94 for TAS3a1), indicating a balanced selection for
these loci. The above results suggest that polymorphisms

at or linked to the small RNA loci might be a result of
selection.
Potential domestication selection

Indica and japonica rice were domesticated independently and their domestication genes usually show different evolutionary histories of selection between cultivated
and wild rice populations [26,27]. To find candidate small
RNA loci that experienced domestication selection, 20
loci were selected from the set of 94 small RNA loci for
further analysis (Figure 1) using a cultivated rice population including 29 indica and 25 japonica cultivars, a wild
population including 15 accessions of O. rufipogon and an
outgroup (Africa wild rice, O. barthii) (Additional file 2).
Of the 20 loci selected, three (miR395a/b, TAS3a2 and
MIR399d) had significant negative Tajima's D values and
one (miR390) had extremely low divergence according to
the above neutral test results (Additional file 3); the
remaining loci were randomly chosen from the small
RNA list shown in Additional file 1.
As previously mentioned, the extent of nucleotide
diversity of selected genes tends to be reduced. Our analyses indicated that nucleotide diversity (π) of the four
neutral genes (Adh1, Waxy, ks1 and RGRC2; [28,29])
reduced less than 2.6 fold in the cultivated rice population compared to their wild progenitors. Of the 20 small
RNA loci, eight (MIR164a/d/e, MIR166f, MIR390,
MIR399d, MIR440 and AK120922) had a nucleotide
diversity reduction greater than 2.6 fold (from 2.9 to 21.2
fold) in the domesticated rice compared to their wild progenitors (Table 1). For example, nucleotide diversity of
MIR390 reduced 7.0 and 6.3 fold in the two domesticated
subgroups relative to the wild population, and nucleotide
diversities of the miRNA-like long hairpin (AK120922)
reduced 5.7 and 11.1 fold. This result suggests that these
eight small RNA loci probably underwent selection during rice evolution.
To further investigate positive selection in these small
RNA loci, in addition to the Tajima's D test, another independent test, the Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade (HKA) test
[30], was performed. The HKA test is able to measure the
degree of nucleotide diversity reduced by positive selection, a feature of the sequence data that cannot be measured by the Tajima's D test. Rejection of the multi-locus
HKA test that measures the difference in diversity within
species relative to divergence between species is often
considered as evidence of a positive selection. The multilocus HKA test requires an outgroup and reference loci
that are believed to have not been affected by selection.
For this purpose, African wild rice (O. barthii) that is the
nearest phylogenetic node to O. sativa and O. rufipogon
[31] was used as the outgroup and the aforementioned
four neutral genes were used as the reference loci. Of the
20 small RNA loci, four miRNA genes (MIR164e,

MIR390, MIR395a/b and MIR399d) and two siRNA
genes (TAS3a2 and AK120922) had signatures of positive
selection in indica and/or japonica subgroup according
to Tajima's D or HKA test (Table 1). No positive selection
was detected by the two tests for other 14 MIRNA loci. In
the wild rice population, MIR399d, MIR1862d and the
miRNA-like long hairpin (AK120922) presented evidence
of positive selection (Tajima's D value of -2.04, -1.88 and 2.05, respectively), suggesting the non-neutral evolution
of these three genes in the wild rice population. A gene
can be considered as a candidate domestication gene if a
significantly positive selection signal is detected in the
cultivated population but not in the wild population [27].
Based on this criterion, our results thus suggest that
MIR164e, MIR390, MIR395a/b and TAS3a2 are potential

candidates of small RNA loci that have experienced direct
selection during rice domestication.

Discussion
To date, large-scale studies of nucleotide variation at
miRNAs have only been carried out in human [15] and
Arabidopsis [16]. Overall, our results in rice support the
findings in human and Arabidopsis that purifying selection is one of the main evolutionary forces acting on rice
MIRNA genes, maintaining lower levels of sequence
divergence in mature miRNAs than in their flanking
regions. In Arabidopsis, only a few substitution events
were observed in the mature miRNA sequences (2 of the
66 investigated miRNAs) in a population including 24
diverse wild accessions. However, nucleotide mutations
in the mature miRNA sequences were found in 11 of the

Wang et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:119
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/119

88 investigated rice miRNAs in this study. We also found
polymorphisms in at least seven miRNAs in the wild rice
population (data not shown). The higher percentage of
SNPs or indels found in rice miRNAs implies that the
polymorphism levels of miRNAs and other miRNA-like
small RNAs may vary among species.
Our results suggest selection, and probably domestication selection, on some small RNA loci (Table 1 and
Additional file 3). Small RNAs regulate genes that control
a wide range of traits; the functions of these small RNA
regulated genes might provide clues for the traits under
selection via small RNA. One interesting result in this
study is that both MIR390 and TAS3 are potential candidates of selection. miR390 acts as a guide for processing
of TAS3 and biogenesis of ta-siRNAs, including the functional ta-siARF [5,10,11]. ARFs (auxin response factors)
are encoded by a large gene family (25 members in rice)
and are involved in regulation of a wide range of biological functions in rice [32]. ta-siARF downregulates ARF2,
ARF3 and ARF4 [5,12] that affect gynoecium patterning
[33], proper timing of vegetative shoot development and
establishment of leaf polarity [34]. At least two ARFs have
been detected as selected genes in maize [27,35]. It is
unclear whether rice ARF genes have experienced selection during evolution. Our results suggest that genes
involved in the same regulatory pathway could all be targeted by domestication selection for enhanced growth
response and productivity. miR164e targets NAC domain
transcription factors that play an important role in development, stress-tolerance and disease-resistance in rice
[36,37]. miR395 targets ATP-sulfurylases that are
involved in sulfate assimilation. Expression of miR395 is
greatly increased under sulfate starvation conditions [38].
Sulfur is an essential macronutrient required by plants.
miR395 regulated sulfate metabolism might have been
selected for high sulfate usage efficiency. Our results suggest that miRNAs and other small RNA loci should not
be ignored in the endeavor to identify the molecular basis
of domestication and improvement of crops.
Note that there are three limitations in our effort to
identify candidate small RNA loci experienced domestication selection. First, a bottleneck effect or demographic
effect can also cause significant reduction of genetic
diversity and it could not be excluded in our analysis. Second, the positive selection detected in this study could
have arisen by selective sweep rather than direct selection
on the small RNA loci themselves. Third, although we
identified several mutations in the functional regions
(mature miRNA, miRNA precursor or promoter) of the
candidate small RNA genes in domesticated rice, such as
in the mature miR395a/b sequences and in tasi-ARF and
the miR390 binding sites of TAS3 (Additional file 4 and
5), and found distinct expression levels of miR164e in the
cultivated and wild rice (data not shown), it does not nec-

essarily indicate a direct consequence of the domestication event. Further experiments are needed to reveal the
consequence of positive selection, such as phenotypic
changes.
Our sequencing results revealed sequence polymorphism in miR166e and its target gene Os03 g16320 (Figure 3). By checking the recently released rice SNP dataset
(http://www.oryzasnp.org[23]), we found a similar situation with miR443 and the target gene Os01 g49940 (a C T
T mutation at the fifth position from the 3' end of miR443
and a G T A mutation at the eighth position from the 3'
end of the miR443 binding site in Os01 g49940). We also
observed SNPs in the miRNA binding sites of targets of
miR164d/e and miR530, but no SNP was observed in the
mature sequences of the two miRNAs. These results suggest that evolution of miRNAs and their targets could be
independent, although a co-evolution relationship
between miRNAs and their target sequences does happen
in cultivated rice as demonstrated previously [18].
At least one member each of four miRNA families
(miR166, miR167, miR171 and miR395) were found to
have experienced positive selection based on Tajima's D
test in the natural Arabidopsis populations [16,17]. These
four miRNA families are conserved in dicot and monocot
plants. In our study, significant signals of positive selection were also detected by Tajima's D test in at least one
member of the miR166, miR167 and miR395 family in
indica or japonica subgroup (Additional file 3), implying
a potential conservation of adaptive evolution between
rice and Arabidopsis for these miRNA families. A common feature of these three families is that they have relatively large number of family members (e.g. 23 and 6
miR395 members in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively).
These homologous genes might have experienced rapid
functional divergence after gene expansion. It has been
suggested that positive selection acts on gene copy number variations [39]. Positive selection could promote
adaptive evolution but whether plants enhance their fitness in the changing environment by adding copy number of miRNAs requires further investigation.

Conclusions
Our survey of polymorphisms in 94 small RNA loci in
rice, the first such effort in crops, revealed a higher level
of sequence variations in miRNAs in domesticated rice
than in Arabidopsis. In agreement with previous studies,
our investigation suggests that purifying selection dominated the evolution of small RNAs in rice. A neutrality
test revealed non-neutral evolution of small RNA loci in
which both positive selection and balanced selection are
involved. Our results suggest that domestication selection on small RNA loci could play an important role in
rice domestication and/or improvement.

Methods
Plant Materials

Fifty-four cultivated rice accessions (Oryza sativa, 29
indica and 25 japonica) from a wide range of geographical locations and 15 accessions of the wild ancestor, O.
rufipogon, were selected for investigation of nucleotide
diversity in small RNA loci. Two accessions of the Africa
wild rice relative, O. barthii, were used as an outgroup
species in a neutrality test. Details of the 71 rice accessions are in Additional file 2.
Small RNAs selected for analyses of nucleotide diversity
and domestication selection

The majority of the MIRNAs selected are conserved in
other species to ensure they are bona fide MIRNAs. For
all the rice-specific MIRNAs, authenticity is supported by
experimental evidence and BLAST analysis has been
used to remove those potentially derived from repeat
regions of the rice genome. The siRNAs used in this study
have been experimentally identified and confirmed by
our previous study [3]
PCR and DNA Sequencing

Primers were designed based on the genomic sequence of
japonica cultivar Nipponbare of the Rice Genome Annotation Project (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/; [40,41]
using the Primer3 program [42]http://fokker.wi.mit.edu/
primer3/input.htm and were compared to the rice
genome sequence to ensure their specificity. Primer pairs
were designed to amplify products with a length of 600 1300 bp, including the pre-miRNA and its flanking
regions (for MIRNA loci). Details of the primers and their
products were provided in Additional file 6. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification was carried out in a
DNAEngine Peltier Thermal Cycler (BIO-RAD) in a total
volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture contained 10-100
ng of template DNA, 2 μl of each primer (10-20 pmol),
0.6 μl of Taq DNA Polymerase (5 U/μl), 1 μl of dNTPs (10
mM), 3 μl of MgCl2 (25 mM), 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Sangon, China). PCR was performed using the following conditions: 5 min at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at
95°C, 30 s at 54°C, and 90 s at 72°C, and a final extension
at 72°C for 10 minutes. When this program failed to
amplify the expected products, specific conditions were
experimentally determined. For O. sativa cultivars, purified PCR products were directly sequenced using the forward or reverse primer. For wild rice, in which either
homozygous or heterozygous individuals might exist,
PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM T-Easy vector
(PMD19-T, Takara) and sequenced using the forward or
reverse primer. The sequencing quality files were checked
manually to avoid the sequencing errors. Sequences with
poor quality were re-sequenced. All sequences have been

deposited into GenBank under the accession numbers
GQ418390-GQ420345 and HM138917-HM140183. In
total, approximately 2.0 Mb of sequences were generated
in this study.
Statistical Analysis

CLUSTALW version 1.82-UNIX was used for multiple
sequence alignments [43] and segregating sites were
identified manually using GeneDoc [44]. Two summary
statistics parameters (θ and π) for nucleotide diversity
and Tajima's D statistic [24] were calculated with a perl
script. θ and π estimate the population mutation rate per
locus based on the number of segregating sites and the
mean value of pairwise divergence per locus, respectively
[45,46]. Multi-locus HKA tests were performed using the
HKA program available at http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/hey/
home. The entire segments that contain the small RNAs
were amplified by the primers shown in Additional file 6
and used for a neutrality test. For MIRNA loci, nucleotide
diversities were separately estimated for the mature miRNAs, the pre-miRNAs, and the upstream and downstream regions of the mature miRNA (the miR395 family
that is located at four clusters in which most members are
less than 100 bp apart from each other was not included
in this analysis). Sequences of the mature miRNAs and
the pre-miRNAs were retrieved from miRBase http://
microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/. Conservation of miRNAs in dicots and monocots is based on Sunkar and Jagadeeswaran [47]. Targets of miRNA were predicted using
Patscan [48] by searching the full length cDNA sequence
dataset (release 5) of the Rice Genome Annotation http://
rice.plantbiology.msu.edu with a penalty score up to four.
