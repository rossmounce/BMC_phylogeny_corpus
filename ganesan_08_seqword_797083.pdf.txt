Abstract
Background: Data mining in large DNA sequences is a major challenge in microbial genomics and
bioinformatics. Oligonucleotide usage (OU) patterns provide a wealth of information for large scale
sequence analysis and visualization. The purpose of this research was to make OU statistical
analysis available as a novel web-based tool for functional genomics and annotation. The tool is also
available as a downloadable package.
Results: The SeqWord Genome Browser (SWGB) was developed to visualize the natural
compositional variation of DNA sequences. The applet is also used for identification of divergent
genomic regions both in annotated sequences of bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, phages and
viruses, and in raw DNA sequences prior to annotation by comparing local and global OU patterns.
The applet allows fast and reliable identification of clusters of horizontally transferred genomic
islands, large multi-domain genes and genes for ribosomal RNA. Within the majority of genomic
fragments (also termed genomic core sequence), regions enriched with housekeeping genes,
ribosomal proteins and the regions rich in pseudogenes or genetic vestiges may be contrasted.
Conclusion: The SWGB applet presents a range of comprehensive OU statistical parameters
calculated for a range of bacterial species, plasmids and phages. It is available on the Internet at
http://www.bi.up.ac.za/SeqWord/mhhapplet.php.

Background
The study of genome OU signatures has a long history dating back to early publications by Karlin et al. who focused
mainly on dinucleotide compositional biases and their
evolutionary implications [1-3]. Statistical approaches of
OU comparison were further advanced by Deschavanne et
al., who applied chaos game algorithms [4]; and by Pride

et al., who extended the analysis to tetranucleotides using
Markov Chain Model simulations [5]. Later, a number of
practical tools for phylogenetic comparison of bacterial
genomes [4,6,7], identification of horizontally transferred
genomic islands [8-13] and assignment of unknown
genomic sequences [14,15] based on OU statistics became
publicly available. These approaches exploited the notion

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/333

that genomic OU composition was less variable within
genomes rather than between them, regardless of which
genomic regions had been taken into consideration [16].
A general belief was that if a significant compositional difference was discovered in genomic fragments relative to
the core genome, these loci most likely can be assigned to
horizontally transferred genetic elements (transposons,
prophages or integrated plasmids). This approach was
criticized by several researchers [17,18] who pointed out
that codon bias and base composition are poor indicators
of horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, there is a need for
more informative parameters which also take into
account higher order DNA variation. An overview of the
current OU statistical methods based on di-, tetra- and
hexanucleotides has been published recently. The conclusion of the review was that all methods were context
dependent and, though being efficient and powerful,
none of them were superior in all applications [19]. Thus,
the major motivation of our work was to develop more
flexible and informative algorithms seamlessly integrating
di- to heptanucleotides OU analysis for reliable identification of divergent genomic regions.
Recently we have introduced the concept of OU patterns
into the literature [20]. Each OU pattern is characterized
by a number of OU statistical parameters namely, local
pattern deviation (D), pattern skew (PS), relative variance
(RV) and others (see Methods section). Novelties of the
developed algorithms relative to other existing methods
include the following: i) distances between patterns of different word length (from di- through to heptanucleotides)
calculated for the same sequences are comparable; i.e. one
may use longer word patterns to perform a large scale
analysis and then switch to shorter word patterns for a
more detailed view; ii) OU patterns calculated for
sequences of different lengths are comparable provided
that the length of the sequence is longer than the corresponding thresholds (specified in the Methods section);
iii) alterations of OU patterns may be analyzed by different non-redundant parameters (D, PS and RV with different schemes of normalization by frequencies of shorter
constituent words). Superimposition of these OU characteristics allows better discrimination of divergent genomic
regions relative to other contemporary approaches [21].

Implementation

[ξ1...ξN]|e is the expected count and C [ξ1...ξN]|0 is a standard
count estimated from the assumption of an equal distribution of words in the sequence: (C [ξ1...ξN]|0 = Lseq × 4-N).

Expected counts of words C [ξ1...ξN]|e were calculated in
accordance with the applied normalization scheme. Thus,
C [ξ1...ξN]|e = C [ξ1...ξN]|0 if OU is not normalized, or C
[ξ1...ξN]|e = C [ξ1...ξN]|n if OU is normalized by empirical frequencies of all shorter words of the length n. The expected
count of a word C [ξ1...ξN]|e of length N in a Lseq long
sequence normalized by frequencies of n-mers (n <N) was
calculated as follows:

N − n +1

C[ξ1 ...ξ l

= L seq × F[ξ1 ...ξ n ] ×

⎜ A,T ,G,C
⎟
⎜
F[ξ ...ξ
∑
]ξ ⎟
i i +n

⎜
ξ
⎠
⎝
(2)

where the F [ξ1...ξn] values are the observed frequencies of
the particular word of length n in the sequence and ξ is
any nucleotide A, T, G or C. For example, expected count
of a word ATGC in a sequence of Lseq nucleotides normalized by frequencies of trinucleotides is:

C ATGC = L seq × FATG ×

FTGC
FTGA + FTGT + FTGG + FTGC
(3)

Two approaches of normalization have been exploited
where the F values were calculated for the complete
sequence of a chromosome, plasmid, etc (generalized
normalization) or for a given sliding window (local normalization). The normalization by equation 2 allows
identification of words, frequencies of which cannot be
predicted exactly by frequencies of shorter constituent
words.
The distance D between two patterns was calculated as the
sum of absolute distances between ranks of identical
words (w, in a total 4N different words) after ordering of
words by Δ[ξ1...ξN] values (see equation 1) in patterns i and
j as follows:

Calculation of OU statistical parameters has been
described previously [20,21]. OU pattern was denoted as
a matrix of deviations Δ[ξ1...ξN] of observed from expected
counts for all possible words of length N:

4N
∑ rank w ,i − rank w , j − D min
D(%) = 100 × w
D max − D min

Δ[ξ1...ξN] = (C [ξ1...ξN]|obs - C [ξ1...ξN]|e)/C [ξ1...ξN]|0

Application of ranks instead of relative oligonucleotide
frequency statistics made the comparison of OU patterns
less biased to the sequence length provided that the
sequences are longer than the limits of 0.3, 1.2, 5, 18.5, 74

where ξn is any nucleotide A, T, G or C in the N-long word;
C [ξ1...ξN]|obs is the observed count of the word [ξ1...ξN]; C

a Java 1.5.x runtime environment or newer.

PS is a particular case of D where patterns i and j were calculated for the same DNA but for direct and reversed
strands, respectively. Dmax = 4N × (4N - 1)/2 and Dmin = 0
when calculating a D or, in a case of PS calculation, Dmin
= 4N if N is an odd number or Dmin = 4N - 2N if N is an even
number due to presence of palindromic words [20]. Normalization of D-values by Dmax ensures that the distances
between two sequences are comparable regardless of the
word length of OU patterns.

The pre-calculated data-sets are saved in a MySQL Server
5.0 database. The size of the sliding window and the OU
pattern type were applied according to the sequence
length (Table 1). At the time of writing, the SeqWord database contained OU patterns pre-calculated for the
sequences of 682 bacterial chromosomes belonging to
637 different organisms (strains and species), 412 plasmids, 100 bacteriophages and 39 other viruses, which
were downloaded from the NCBI [44].

Relative variance of an OU pattern was calculated by the
following equation:

(5)

where N is word length; Δ2w is the square of a word w
count deviation (see equation 1); and σ20 is the expected
variance of the word distribution in a randomly generated
sequence that depends on the sequence length and the
word length:

σ 0 = 0.14 +

4N
L seq

where Lseq is sequence length, and N is word length. Normalization of OU pattern variance by σ0 makes the variances comparable regardless of the word length of OU
patterns and the sequence length. The regression equation
was tested on 300 randomly generated sequences with an
equiprobable occurrence of all 4 nucleotides by the
DataFit 7.1.44 software.
The SWGB is coded in Java to be used as an applet in a
Web-browser either on the Internet or locally (the programs OligoWords in Python and SeqWord_Viewer,
which respectively calculate and visualize the OU patterns
for DNA sequences, are available for download from the

User familiarity with the abbreviations of the various OU
statistical parameters is important. Different types of OU
patterns were abbreviated as type_Nmer. Types might be
"n0" for non-normalized, or "n1" for normalized by
mononucleotide frequencies. For example, the non-normalized tetranucleotide usage pattern is denoted as
n0_4mer; tetranucleotide usage pattern normalized by
mononucleotide content is n1_4mer etc. The genomes in
the SWGB database were analyzed by the following statistical parameters: D – distance between two patterns of the
same type (in this work we used distances D between local
patterns calculated for overlapping genome fragments
and the global genome patterns calculated for the complete sequence – the local pattern deviation); PS – pattern
skew, distance between the two patterns of the direct and
reverse strands of the same DNA sequence; RV and GRV –
oligonucleotide usage variances normalized locally and
globally, respectively, and reduced to the OU variance
expected for a randomly generated sequence (see Materials section); GC-content (GC) and GC-skew (GCS) in
DNA fragments.

patterns
The SeqWord Genome Browser (SWGB) applet is available via the Internet [22-24] and is mouse and menu
driven. The Web-based applet is used to visualize DNA
compositional variations in bacterial and viral genomes
stored in the SeqWord database. Every genome in the
database is represented by a set of statistical OU parameters (D, PS, GV, GRV, GC and GCS) calculated for
genomic fragments, which were selected by a sliding win-

dow (sliding window length and step were set according
to the total length of the sequence as demonstrated in
Table 1). While in 70 to 99% of genomic fragments the
OU compositional bias is similar to the complete genome
OU pattern, some regions with atypical OU composition,
however, are always present. Superimposition of different
OU parameters allows discrimination of divergent
genomic regions, as was published previously [21].
Briefly: rRNA operons are characterized by extremely high
PS and low RV; giant genes with multiple repeated elements have high or moderate PS and high RV; horizontally transferred genetic elements are characterized by
increased divergence between RV and GRV accompanied
by high D; and genes for ribosomal proteins show a moderate increase of D, PS and RV above genomic averages.
Having analyzed 1243 sequences of different microorganisms including viruses and plasmids in the SeqWord database, we confirmed that the approaches we have
developed and tested previously [25] (mainly on Pseudomonas putida KT2440 chromosomal DNA) are appropriate and useful for analysis of genomic sequences of other
microorganisms and viruses.
In an open applet window, the user has the ability to
choose from an ever growing list of available sequences
(Fig. 1). The user also has the option of restricting the list
to display only bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, phages,
viruses or all sequences by selecting the corresponding filter button. Users have to select a genome in the list and
click the 'Display in the Applet' button to retrieve the precalculated data. All OU parameters calculated for a given
genome may be exported to a local text file by using the
'Export' function from the applet's 'File' menu. Later,
instead of again having to connect to the database, users
may open and view their local files (previously exported
from the applet or calculated by the OligoWords program,
see below) via the 'Open' function in the 'File' menu.
The SWGB is basically comprised of two views, denoted
by the 'Gene Map' and 'Diagram' tabs. The applet is instrumental for visualization of natural variation in DNA
sequences by the interactive diagrams on the 'Gene Map'
and 'Diagram' tabs. Users may save the current diagram in
JPG format by using the 'Save picture' function in the 'File'
menu.
The 'Gene Map' tab offers a simple view of an entire
genome at a glance and gives users access to a number of
important pre-calculated OU statistics superimposed on
the gene map (Fig. 2). Displays for each of the statistical
parameters can be toggled on/off by checking items in the
'Hide Elements' menu. By merely mousing over any
region on the plot, a message displaying detailed information for the pointed curve will be shown in the 'Message'

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/333

bar. Clicking a gene on the map displays a dialog with the
annotation details (Fig. 2).
The 'Zoom' function is straight-forward and allows users
to control the amount of data viewed in the plot area.
Clicking the 'Enter' button after setting the desired zoom
value will then redraw the map. A 'Zoom into region'
function under the 'Tools' drop-down menu allows users
to zoom into exact genomic regions by merely entering
their desired co-ordinates into the pop-up dialog box. The
'Tools' → 'Select region' menu item allows highlighting of
selected regions without zooming. Use the option 'Clear
...' in the 'Tools' menu to undo zooming or highlighting.
To locate a genomic region by gene, click the button
'Select Gene'. In the pop-up dialog box one may order the
gene list by gene names, functionality or coordinates, then
select a gene in the list and click 'OK'. When a gene annotation is not available, the values of the locus coordinates
are used as a gene name. The applet window will be
scrolled to the selected gene highlighted on the map (see
Fig. 2).
The 'Diagram' tab allows flexible filtering of the underlying data based on the criteria chosen by users. Although
the underlying data is pre-calculated, the user may, by
simply changing selected parameters, generate very different images which give different insights into the natural
genomic variation. To start with, the 'Diagram' view offers
a bar chart or a dot-plot presentation of the pre-calculated
data. To view a bar chart of the distribution statistics for a
given OU parameter, select the desired parameters from
the X or Y-axis drop-downs and click 'Enter'. The number
of bars displayed can be adjusted using the '# Bars' selector.
On the dot-plot diagram, each genomic fragment
(selected by the sliding window) is represented by a dot
with X and Y coordinates that correspond to values of OU
parameters chosen from X and Y drop-down lists, respectively. The Z axis parameter may be set as well. In this case,
the dots are coloured by values of OU parameters selected
for the Z axis, and the colour range is displayed on the vertical colour bar on the left of the plot area (Fig. 3).
Having set up the dot-plot, users will be able to identify
divergent genomic regions (see next section). To retrieve
annotations of genomic fragments corresponding to a
group of dots, frame the dots of interest by clicking and
dragging over the desired area. A selector frame then
appears around the dots (Fig. 3). Clicking the 'Get' button
displays the selected genomic fragments with their coordinates and gene annotations. Furthermore, identification
and isolation of specific genomic regions may be
improved significantly by filtering dots by OU parameters. The simplest way of filtering is by the third (Z axis)

more sophisticated way to filter genomic regions is provided by the 'Filter' button. An example will be discussed
below.
The 'Mark' button enables genomic fragments to be
selected by their coordinates and highlighted on the dotplot. Click the 'Mark' button to open a dialog and enter

coordinates of one or multiple fragments (Fig. 4). Coordinates of each fragment must be added to the list by
clicking the 'Add' button. Close the dialog by clicking
'OK'. The corresponding dots on the dot-plot will be highlighted as shown in Fig. 4.
Identification of divergent genomic islands
Several routines have been developed to identify the horizontally transferred genomic islands, genes for ribosomal
RNA and proteins, non-functional pseudogenes and
genes of other functional categories. All these routines are

Every dot on the dot-plot corresponds to a genomic fragment selected by the sliding window. Dots are spread and coloured in accordance with their values of the selected statistical OU parameters. Information for each dot may be found by one
of the following methods: i) information for a dot under the mouse pointed by the mouse is shown in the 'Message' bar; ii) double clicking a dot returns us to the 'Gene map' tab with the corresponding genomic fragment highlighted; iii) framing the dots

genomic regions of Salmonella typhimurium LT2 (NC_003197) that correspond to horizontally transferred genetic elements
were selected (see discussion in the text).

described in detail with illustrations in supplementary
web-pages (use the 'Help' link in the applet window).
The approach to identify inserts of foreign genomic elements by OU statistical parameters has been described
recently [21]. While several algorithms allow identification of horizontally transferred genomic islands [8-13],
the multiple oligomer parameters used in the SWGB even
allows tentative attribution of genomic fragments (and,

given the right scale, genes or gene clusters) to different
functional classes using only a FASTA sequence as input.
However, the emphasis of the SWGB is not primarily its
annotation capability, but its ability to display the natural
internal variability of genome sequences. We use Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a known mosaic genome with
105 genomic islands above 4000 bp in length [26] as an
example. Many of these features can be visualized at a
glance using the SWGB without any in depth analysis (see

respectively. The genomic regions covering the giant gene for the surface protein SwmB [29] were highlighted by entering the
coordinates of this gene into the 'Mark loci by coordinates' dialog. The genomic regions enriched with i) housekeeping genes;

Fig. 2). On the 'Diagram' view the parameters
n1_4mer:RV, n1_4mer:GRV and n0_4mer:D were
selected for the X, Y and Z axes, respectively, as we showed
previously (see Fig. 3). Plotting local relative oligomer variance (RV) against global relative variance (GRV) basically
shows the effect of normalization by global mononucleotide content. The core genome is then represented on the
dot plot as the positive linear correlation line where RV ≈
GRV (Fig. 3). In other words, these fragments exhibit such

compositional closeness to the core genome that normalizing by local mononucleotide content does not have a
different effect compared to normalizing by global content. These genomic fragments also exhibit a low distance
from the genomic average; and are therefore coloured
blue. Scattered dots lying peripheral to the expected
strong linear correlation do not belong to the core
genome and also have a higher distance from the genomic
average and are hence coloured green. Using the filter set-

tings recommended in Fig. 5, twenty one fragments were
found to be genomic islands (note that while border values of OU parameters are not the same for different
genomes, the grading notches of the sliders represent relative values that allows identification of homologous
regions in many different genomes). For a number of reasons, many more islands were found in a similar analysis
by Weinel et al. [26]. Firstly, the sliding window size of 8
kbp means many of the 4 kbp features from their analysis
were not identified automatically. Furthermore, they were
looking for all compositionally atypical regions, whereas
here we restrict ourselves to horizontally transferred
regions.
A known 40 kbp bacteriophage insertion [2586000–
2626000] is, surprisingly, not among the genomic fragments selected in the SWGB using this filter. Although the
prophage is still perceptible on the 'Gene Map' view (see
a figure in the supplementary help web-pages), the OU
parameters of the region do not differ markedly enough
from the core sequence to be isolated automatically as a
horizontally transferred region.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/333

As the SWGB uses parameters that are based on comparison of local fragments to the global genomic average,
strains with abundant insertions of homogenous DNA
can confound this form of analysis. One example is the
Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A genome which is composed of an estimated 25% of putatively horizontally
acquired DNA, one of the highest amounts discovered to
date [11]. As a result of these insertions, the genomic signature has been strongly influenced, resulting in a large
amount of scatter and a poorly defined core genome on
the plots. On the other hand, this type of analysis allows
estimation of genome stability in a simple, multi parameter view (see the Vibrio cholerae N16961-O1-eltor example
in the online help files). To conclude, filtering provides a
convenient way to automatically isolate divergent
genomic regions of interest. However, some regions may
erroneously remain undetected due to possible amelioration of older inserts [27] or a higher level of noise in
unstable genomes. However, many problematic genomic
fragments can in some cases be easily attributed to functional gene categories using the SWGB 'Diagram' window
(see Fig. 2).

Methodologies for discovering long modular genes have
already been discussed in a previous publication [28].
Briefly, long genes display a particular tetranucleotide
usage and can be discovered by plotting n0_4mer:D (X
axis) versus n1_4mer:RV (Y axis). The positively linear
correlated outlier fragments (towards the top right of the
image) are often fragments of long genes with their characteristic repeats. An example using the gene encoding the
1.12 megadalton cell surface protein of Synechococcus sp.
WH8102 [29] marked on the dot-plot is shown in Fig. 4.
Ribosomal RNA operons (but not genes for ribosomal
proteins) are characterized by extremely high pattern skew
and a large distance from the core genome (Fig. 2). Thus,
there is a tendency to find many genomic fragments containing rRNA genes coloured dark brown to red in the bottom right section of the 'Diagram' tab. The annotation for
rRNA operons is not present in the database; therefore,
these are seen in the 'Gene Map' tab as unannotated areas
with high pattern skew (Fig. 2). Ribosomal proteins tend
to be increasingly present at a slightly greater than average
RV and above average D (see Fig. 2), which is in agreement with observations that highly expressed genes for
ribosomal proteins have a highly specific codon usage
compared to housekeeping genes of the organism [30].
The majority of genomic fragments form a cluster characterized by average and higher than average RV, stable OU
patterns (low D) and low PS. These tend to be the core, or
bulk genes and genomic regions with their typical tetranucleotide usage. Some other core sequence fragments
spread from this area toward lower RV and less specific
OU patterns (higher D and PS) – these are all characteristics of an unstable or randomly generated sequence [20].
These regions were found to be enriched with many hypothetical genes, prophages and transposons. (The data is
not shown but is easily verified with any genome using
the 'Get' button. Consider, for example, this area in the
pseudogene rich Mycobacterium leprae TN or Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A genomes [11,31], and the relatively
homogenous Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 genome [32].)
These regions were thus categorized as rich in 'vestigial'
genes in contrast to the core genome regions rich in
housekeeping genes (Fig. 4).
It must be stressed that with an average length of genes
being around 1 kbp and overlapping sliding windows of
8 kbp, one cannot expect precise separation of housekeeping and vestigial genes by the method described above.
However, when analyzing an unknown DNA sequence
prior to annotation, it may be helpful to identify genomic
regions enriched with a higher proportion of these so
called housekeeping genes and other regions rich in vestigial genes. These tentative results should be verified with
other complementary algorithms such as BLAST, gene
finding and annotation techniques.

The most important feature of the supplemented software
available from the SWGB web-server for download is the
ability to quickly and easily analyze a novel sequence on
a local computer. The command-line Python program
OligoWords is first used to analyse FASTA or GenBank formatted sequences. The program is available for download
[33] in several packages as precompiled executable files
and as Python source code. The command-line interface
of the OligoWords program is shown in Fig. 6. Parameters
such as oligomer length and window size can all be set
depending on the sequence length and desired resolution
(see Table 1 for suggestions). Since the SWGB is implemented as a Java applet, it can be run within a web
browser locally. The HTML-embedded applet is available
for download from the same FTP site [33] (select
SeqWord_Viewer.zip). The output file from OligoWords
is read into the SWGB via the 'Open' function of the 'File'
menu, and the complete functionality of the online system is then available. For example, a new sequence can be
analysed for ribosomal gene clusters, putative horizontally transferred elements or other regions of atypical DNA
structure prior to the lengthy annotation step. A complete
description of how to run the SWGB and OligoWords
locally is presented in the online help files.

Conclusion
The SWGB applies novel OU statistics to visualize and discern divergent genomic regions. It has been extensively
tested in practice for large scale genome analysis [32,34],
and for identification and comparison of horizontally
transferred genomic islands [35]. The applet is linked to a
database of pre-calculated OU patterns of bacterial
genomes (1243 complete sequences, including bacterial
chromosomes, plasmids and some viruses were available
at the time of manuscript submission, however, new
sequences are regularly being added). The SWGB allows
tentative annotation of the various divergent regions and
provides overviews for use in comparative genomics.
Users may download the command line version of the
OligoWords program to analyze their own sequences. A
packaged version of the SWGB allows users to view and
manipulate their OligoWords results locally using a compatible web-browser.
Although there are several readily available tools for DNA
compositional analysis, genomic island identification and
large scale genome analysis [36-42], the SWGB surpasses
previous approaches in making use of a wider range of
parameters which allow identification of divergent
genomic regions and even visual tentative attribution of
these DNA fragments to various categories. We have
found superimposition of these parameters to be more
informative than a simple GC average or a relative OU frequency deviation since they allow discrimination of divergent genomic regions (large modular genes, ribosomal

RNAs, ribosomal protein clusters and the horizontally
transferred genomic islands, see Fig. 2) all of which are
characterized by an alternative OU composition relative
to the core sequence. In addition, our approach provides
some insight into the physicochemical state of the analysed DNA and the stability/state of flux of a genome as
tetranucleotides exert a strong structural signal [20,21].
Consideration of flux inferred oligonucleotide usage is
particularly interesting when comparing, for example,
multiple replicating units of the same strain. Using the
simple analysis described here, the second chromosome
of Vibrio cholerae N16961-O1-eltor was demonstrated to
be far less conserved than the first, with differences in
mononucleotide content and distance from core genomic
values implying a more heterogenous chromosome consistent with its role as a gene capture system [43].
Furthermore, no single oligonucleotide word size has
been found to be optimal for all purposes, such as finding
conserved or horizontally transferred DNA, plasmid host
comparisons or testing distant homology [19]. The SWGB
crucially provides the opportunity to analyse DNA
sequences with various oligomer lengths and normalisation schemes. For example, genomic regions of particular
interest may be multiply analysed with progressively

smaller oligomer sizes to provide more detailed information on oligomer usage in individual genes.

Availability and requirements
The SWGB applet is freely available to any researcher
wishing to use it for non-commercial purposes via the
Internet [22-24]. It has been tested on openSUSE 10.2,
Gentoo Linux 2.6, Fedora Core 5 and Microsoft Windows
XP workstations using Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0,
Maxthon 1.5.9, Mozilla Firefox 2.0, Mozilla SeaMonkey
1.1.1, Safari 3.0.4 for Mac, Konqueror 3.5.5 and 3.5.7, and
Opera 9.10 browsers with Java 1.5. At the time of manuscript submission, a problem likely related to the local
firewall was encountered with the Firefox browser on
SUSE 10.2 and some other browsers (see 'Compatibility'
link on the SWGB front page). The problem will be tackled in later releases of the SWGB. Feedback from users
(addressed to the corresponding author) is very much
appreciated.
