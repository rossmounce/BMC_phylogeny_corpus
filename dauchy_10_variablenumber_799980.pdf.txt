Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium intracellulare, a species of the Mycobacterium avium complex, may be the cause of severe
lung, lymphatic node, skin and bone/joint infections, as well as bacteriemia. The goal of this work was to identify
Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit-Variable Number Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) markers and to study their
variability in a collection of isolates of M. intracellulare collected in humans. We studied 61 isolates collected in humans
between 2001 and 2008, as well as the reference strain, M. intracellulare ATCC 13950.
Results: We identified 45 MIRU-VNTR candidates, of which 17 corresponded to the MIRU-VNTR identified in the
genome of M. intracellulare ATCC 13950. Among the 45 potential MIRU-VNTR, seven were selected for use in a MIRUVNTR assay applied to our collection of isolates. Forty-four patterns were found by MIRU-VNTR typing and the
discriminatory power of the assay was high with a Hunter-Gaston diversity index of 0.98. We do not have evidence of a
particular distribution of MIRU-VNTR polymorphism according to clinical situation.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that MIRU-VNTR typing could be used for molecular epidemiological studies applied
to M. intracellulare.
Background
Due to their genetic and phenotypic diversity, epidemiological and pathological studies of non-tuberculous
mycobacteria are complex. These bacteria are difficult to
eradicate because of their natural resistance to the antibiotics frequently used against tuberculosis. Because of
their saprophytic and ubiquitous nature, the diagnosis of
non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease depends on criteria provided by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) [1].
Mycobacterium intracellulare belongs to the Mycobacterium avium complex, and has an important role in
pathology. In humans, M. intracellulare may be the cause
of severe lung, lymphatic node, skin and bone/joint infections, as well as bacteriemia [2]. The presence of an
immunodepressing context, like that caused by HIV/
AIDS, constitutes a risk factor for the M. avium infection,
but not for the M. intracellulare infection. M. intracellu* Correspondence: frederic.dauchy@chu-bordeaux.fr

lare is more frequently isolated at infection stages, as
defined by the ATS, than is M. avium [3,4]. Most available
methods to identify and differentiate strains of M. intracellulare are difficult and have limited discriminatory
power. The PCR-RFLP method has been used for the typing of M. avium [5]. The repeated sequences of VNTR
(Variable-Number of Tandem-Repeats), and in particular
MIRU (Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units)
have been used for the genotyping of several species of
non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The full genomes of M.
avium and M. paratuberculosis have been sequenced
allowing the description of MIRU-VNTR in these species
[6-9]. MIRU-VNTR markers applied to the genetic typing
of M. intracellulare have been described very recently
[10]. The full genome of M. intracellulare has not been
published yet, but the sequences of 353 contigs from M.
intracellulare ATCC 13950 have been publicly available
since 2008.
The goal of our work was to identify MIRU-VNTR
markers from the genome sequence of M. intracellulare

ATCC 13950 and to study their variation in a collection of
61 M. intracellulare isolates collected at infection or colonizing stages, as defined by the ATS, and from pulmonary
or extra-pulmonary sites.

Methods
Strain collection

Different MIRU-VNTR were studied in a group including
61 M. intracellulare isolates collected under colonization
(10 isolates) or infection stages (51 isolates) in humans,
and the reference strain M. intracellulare ATCC 13950,
named strain 1 in our study. The 61 clinical isolates were
obtained from 51 patients between January 2001 and January 2008. All isolates were collected in the Bacteriology
Department of the Bordeaux University Hospital, except
for six which came from Brittany, another region of
France (isolates 43, 44, 47, 48, 53 and 57). The average age
of patients was 68 years, with a range of 5 to 86. The
male/female sex ratio of patients was 0.94. Some patients
presented concurrent conditions: HIV infection (strains
39 and 41), cystic fibrosis (strains 43, 49, 50, and 51),
blood-related cancer (strains 24 and 62), and lung cancer
(strains 7 and 12). Several isolates were collected from the
same patients at different times, following a relapse of the
illness: isolates 9 and 30 in 2006, isolates 13 and 17 in
2002 and 2005, respectively, isolates 16, 19, 40, and 46
between 2005 and 2008, isolates 22 and 60 in 2006, isolates 23 and 61 in 2007, isolates 28 and 42 in 2007, isolates
35 and 36 in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and isolates 37
and 38 in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The pulmonary or
extrapulmonary origin of the isolate, presence or absence
of an illness meeting the ATS criteria, gender of the
patient, place of residence, and year of isolation were
recorded. The isolates were cultured on LöwensteinJensen medium. Identification was conducted using Genprobe® (BioMérieux, France) or GenoType® (Hain Lifescience) for M. avium and M. intracellulare.
The present project is in compliance with the Helsink
Declaration (Ethical Principles for Medical Research
Involving Human Subjects). Strains were collected from
specimen as part of the patients' usual care, without any
additional sampling. All patient data shown in the present
work were anonymously reported, without offering any
possibility to trace the actual patients.
Preparation of mycobacterial DNA

Mycobacterial DNA was obtained following the method
of Baulard et al. [11]. A bacterial suspension from a
recent culture (< 1 month) was suspended in 500 μL of
TE 1× buffer (Tris/HCl pH 8, EDTA) with 1% of Triton.
Suspensions were then incubated for 30 min at 90°C in
order to inactivate the bacteria. The DNA from the
supernatant was directly used as a template.

We then analyzed the M. intracellulare isolates using
two techniques: (i) PCR-RFLP as described by Picardeau
et al. and based on amplification of genomic sequences
between IS1311 and IS1245 (5) and (ii) the MIRU-VNTR
method using newly identified MIRU-VNTR markers.
We used PCR-RFLP as a comparison to the MIRU-VNTR
method.
Identification of MIRU-VNTR markers

MIRU-VNTR were identified from the sequenced
genome of the strain M. avium 104 (GenBank:08595), by
using the program Tandem Repeats Finder http://
minisatellites.u-psud.fr. A minimum threshold of 80%
homology was used and a sequence of 45 or more basepairs was required in order for it to be clearly identified
on an electrophoresis gel. Only the potential MIRUVNTR not already described [6,7] were retained.
The genome sequence of M. intracellulare ATCC 13950
has been effectively available since 2008 in contig format
(GenBank no. ABIN01000000). The 353 available contigs
were examined sequentially with the goal of identifying
potential MIRU-VNTR using the program and the criteria described above.
To screen for variability in the number of MIRU-VNTR
loci, PCR primers targeting the regions flanking the loci
were designed. As a preliminary step, the different
MIRU-VNTR candidates were tested with specific primers to amplify DNA from a set of 9 randomly chosen M.
intracellulare isolates, as well as the reference strain
ATCC 13950.
Each locus was amplified individually and analyzed by
conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. To confirm that
length polymorphisms were the result of repeat copy
number variations, PCR products were purified with the
Wizard® PCR preps DNA purification system (Promega)
and sequenced using the fluorescence-labeled dideoxynucleotide technology according to the manufacturer's
recommendations (Applied Biosystems). Using this
approach, seven MIRU-VNTR loci were selected and
taken forward for full assessment.
PCR amplification of MIRU-VNTR

The PCR reaction was composed of 1 U Go Taq Flexi
DNA polymerase (Promega); 1 μM of each primer; 1 μM
dNTP; 5 μL of 5× buffer solution; 1.5 mM of MgCl2; 1 μL
of dimethyl sulfoxyde (DMSO, Sigma); and 25 μL of distilled H2O. The mixture was added to 5 μL of DNA,
diluted at a 1/5 ratio. Amplification conditions were as
follows: 1 cycle of 5 min at 94°C; 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°C,
30 s at 58°C, and 30 s at 72°C; and 1 cycle of 7 min at 72°C.
To detect difference in repeat numbers, the PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel.

MIRU-VNTR stability study

MIRU-VNTR stability was studied on four clinical isolates, chosen randomly, before and after 10 sequential liquid cultures in the Bactec® MGIT medium (BectonDickinson Microbiology Systems). DNA was extracted
and subjected to PCR amplification.
Data analysis

An allele number string, based on the number of repeats
at each locus, was assigned to all isolates. The number of
repeated motifs was rounded to the next highest number,
as previously described [6]. As such, the number of
repeated sequences equaling zero signified that the PCR
product corresponded to the surrounding area only,
without the MIRU-VNTR motif. The discriminatory
power of combined MIRU-VNTR loci was calculated
using the Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index (HGDI)
[12]. Genetic diversity was assessed by allelic diversity (h)
[13].
Phylogenetic relationships between the different isolates were analyzed using the program Bionumerics® v.5.0
(Applied Maths). Two different techniques were used to
represent the relationships between isolates, (i) A phenogram using phenetic UPGMA methods. (ii) A minimum
spanning tree. The minimum spanning tree was generated in order to visualize the relationships between a
large number of isolates in a single compact image. Complexes were created if neighbors differed by no more than
two of the seven alleles. Each clonal complex is distinguished from its neighbors by an elongation greater than
or equal to three loci. The minimum spanning tree was
created based on the categorical coefficient and the priority rule 'highest number of single-locus variants'. A
detailed description of analysis using minimum spanning
tree can be found in the study by Schouls et al. [14].

Results
Identification of MIRUs

Four [6] and eight MIRU-VNTR [7] have been already
described for M. avium and M. paratuberculosis, respectively. Because of the phylogenetic similarity between
these species and M. intracellulare, it was predicted that
several of these MIRU-VNTR could also be used in typing M. intracellulare isolates [15]. Thus we included these
MIRU-VNTR loci, named MIRU 1 through 4 (Bull et al.),
MIRU 32, 292, X3, 25, 3, 7, 10, and 47 (Thibault et al.), in
our study. The analysis of the genome of M. avium 104
identified 120 Tandem Repeat (TR) sequences of which
16 were selected based on their degree of homology and
their size (MIN 1 through MIN 16). Examination of the
353 contigs of M. intracellulare ATCC 13950 identified
310 TRs of which 17 were used in the study (MIN 17
through MIN 33). Thus a total of 45 TR loci were studied.

Page 3 of 7

The polymorphism of the selected 45 TR loci was initially investigated on a set of nine randomly chosen isolates of M. intracellulare (isolates 2 through 10), as well as
the reference strain M. intracellulare ATCC 13950 (strain
1). Thirty-four MIRU-VNTR were absent during amplification of one or more isolates while four MIRU-VNTR
did not demonstrate polymorphism on the isolates tested,
they were thus eliminated. One of the 12 MIRU-VNTR
already described for M. avium and M. intracellulare,
MIRU 3 (Bull at al.), was polymorphic with different allele
sizes. None of the new MIRU-VNTR identified from the
strain M. avium 104 could be validated on our set of 10
isolates of M. intracellulare. Consequently, of the 45 candidate MIRU-VNTR only seven, MIRU 3 (Bull et al.),
MIN 18, MIN 19, MIN 20, MIN 22, MIN 31, and MIN 33,
were present and exhibited polymorphism.
The stability of the seven polymorphic MIRU-VNTR
markers was studied on four isolates. No difference was
seen in the gel profiles before and after 10 passages in
MGIT medium. Thus, an MIRU-VNTR scheme was proposed, including seven markers. It allowed unambiguous
type assignment using agarose gels, with PCR products
ranging in size between 200 and 750 bp. Characteristics
of each MIRU-VNTR marker are shown in Table 1. As
the genome sequence of M. intracellulare was available
only in a contig format and was not annotated, it was
impossible to determine where the MIRU-VNTR were
located in the genome. The sizes of the unit repeat ranged
from 53 to 57 bp. Sequencing of the different size PCR
products at each of the seven loci from each of the 10 isolates confirmed the sizes and sequences of individual
MIRU-VNTR loci.
Typing of clinical isolates

The PCR-RFLP method and the set of seven MIRUVNTR were used to type a collection of 62 M. intracellulare isolates. Specimens were cultured from the respiratory tract (51 isolates) or from extra-pulmonary sites (10
isolates + reference strain ATCC) and represented infection (51 isolates + reference strain ATCC) or colonization
(10 isolates) stages, respectively.
PCR-RFLP did not provide the expected discriminating
power for the 62 M. intracellulare isolates. We obtained
polymorphic and complex patterns, containing up to 15
bands. Because of these weak and complex amplifications, we were not able to accurately type the panel of isolates. Nevertheless, we were able to confirm the identity
of strains sequentially collected from the same patients.
Thus, the PCR-RFLP method seems to be accurate to
compare close isolates of M. intracellulare. PCR-RFLP
reported by Picardeau et al. might be useful for M. avium
but not M. intracellulare typing.
The seven MIRU-VNTR were amplified very efficiently
in all 62 isolates and the size variations of the amplicons

Table 2. Analysis of the combination of the seven MIRUVNTR loci for the 62 M. intracellulare isolates revealed
44 MIRU-VNTR types. Strains isolated at different times
from the same patient following a relapse of the illness
showed identical MIRU-VNTR allele profiles. Marker
MIN 33 was the most discriminating MIRU-VNTR, displaying seven different alleles with repeat copy numbers
equal to zero or ranging from 2 to 7 depending on the isolate. Marker MIN 31 was the most homogeneous marker,
most of the isolates harboring 2 or 3 repeat units of 57 bp.
This was also reflected by the discriminatory power estimated by the HGDI, calculated on the 52 non epidemiologically linked isolates. Only the first isolate from each
patient was included in this analysis. The most discrimi-

nant marker MIN 33 had a HGDI of 0.85 while the less
discriminant one, MIN 31, had a HGDI of 0.60. The overall discriminatory index of the MIRU-VNTR method was
0.98.
As a complementary analysis, the MIRU-VNTR profiles were imported into Bionumerics® (Applied-maths),
and the genetic relationships of the 52 independant isolates were deduced by the construction of an UPGMA
tree (figure 1) and a minimum spanning tree (figure 2).
The minimum spanning tree allowed us to distinguish
five clonal complexes, of which three were predominant
(shown as three separate colors encircling the isolates in
figure 2). Complex I was composed of 14 isolates, with a
principal group of seven isolates. Since the origin and collection dates were known, we could eliminate the chance

UPGMA tree allowed us to distinguish four clusters (figure 1). The isolates belonging to the clonal complex I are
found in cluster 1, except for isolate 34 which is unclustered. Most of the clonal complex II strains are found in
cluster 2 except for strain 24 (cluster 4) and strain 54 (not
clustered). The clonal complex III isolates are all situated
in clusters 2 and 3. There was no obvious link between

Discussion
We described seven MIRU-VNTR markers, applicable in
the typing of M. intracellulare. We studied 61 isolates,
collected from 51 patients between 2001 and 2008, as
well as the reference strain M. intracellulare ATCC
13950.
The MIRU-VNTR technique was conducted using different candidate MIRU-VNTR chosen from the genome
of M. avium and from M. intracellulare contigs. Out of 45
candidate MIRU-VNTR studied, only seven were
retained, of which six came from M. intracellulare contigs. Among the 17 MIRU-VNTR from contigs, 11 had to
be eliminated due to inadequate amplification. The primers found to be ineffective on the study strains were also
ineffective on the reference strain. The lack of reference
strain amplification could be related to differences
between the sequenced genome and the genome of the
reference strain in our possession.
The MIRU-VNTR technique provides numerous
advantages: it provides a rapid, adaptable technique to
comment on the presence of clonal complexes within isolates linked using an epidemiological method [16]. Coding the results as a series of numbers allows an easy
exchange of results between different labs. On the practical side, this technique also enables evaluation of the possibility of laboratory contamination in cultures from
different isolates. Using MIRU-VNTR markers, we also
confirmed the identity of isolates collected from the same
patients when they had a relapse of their illness. This stability was observed invitro with subcultures of the same
isolate, and invivo for the same infected patient. This
result contrasted with results obtained by the MIRUVNTR technique on strains of M. tuberculosis, which
provided an example of frequent exogenous infections
[17]. We did not find any difference in the genetic profile
of serial strains found in our patients, which permitted us
to exclude the possibility of re-infection with a new strain
of M. intracellulare.
For the clustering analysis of MIRU-VNTR profiles, a
graphing algorithm termed minimum spanning tree was
used. This method has been introduced by some authors
to improve analysis of VNTR profiles [14]. Similar to
maximum-parsimony phylogenetic tree reconstruction
methods, minimum spanning tree constructs a tree that
connects all the genetic profiles in such a way that the
summed genetic distance of all branches is minimized.
The differences in mathematical approach between minimum spanning tree and UPGMA methods explain
changes in strains clustering. Thus, minimum spanning
tree allowed us to group strains which were unclustered

with UPGMA (isolates 54 in complex II and 34 in complex I).
Our study permitted us to characterize the statistical
power of the MIRU-VNTR technique as applied to M.
intracellulare. The global discriminatory index of 0.98
presented in this work confirmed the possible use of this
technique, in agreement with results obtained with other
species of the avium complex [7]. Interestingly, Ichikawa
et al. [10] also described an HGDI of 0.98 for the MLVA
of M. intracellulare. Forty-four MIRU-VNTR types were
obtained in our study for the 61 M. intracellulare clinical
isolates, a number similar to that described by Ichikawa
[10]. Our results confirmed the data very recently
described for M. intracellulare [10] showing that this
method seemed to harbor a great discriminatory power
for identification of genetically similar isolates.
Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex agents,
in addition to a broad host range, are environmental
mycobacteria found in numerous biotopes including the
soil, water, aerosols, and vegetation. Nevertheless, little is
known about genetic variations among patient and environmental isolates of M. intracellulare. Development of
genotyping methods could allow further studies to examine the possible reservoirs of this pathogen in the environment, their diversity and their role as sources of
infection in humans.

MIRU-VNTR are present in diverse metabolic or regulatory systems, as part of synthesis or degradation of lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, energy production, or signal
transduction [18]. For our part, because we did not have
access to the genome of M. intracellulare other than in
contig format, we were not able to measure the location
of the MIRU-VNTR in inter- or intragenic regions. In this
study, we did not have evidence of a particular distribution of MIRU-VNTR polymorphism according to clinical
situation. To date, publications on the virulence of nontuberculous mycobacteria are preliminary. Genotyping
using the MIRU-VNTR technique could offer the opportunity for better classification of strains, and could be
used for to research on virulence mechanisms in nontuberculous mycobacteria.

Conclusions
This study allowed us to describe seven MIRU-VNTR
markers, applicable in the typing of M. intracellulare. The
loci in this MIRU-VNTR assay were highly discriminating and stable over time. MIRU-VNTR typing could be
used for molecular epidemiological studies of M. intracellulare strains. Furthermore, data obtained by MLVA
could be shared in a web database for M. intracellulare, as
has already been done for other bacterial species.
