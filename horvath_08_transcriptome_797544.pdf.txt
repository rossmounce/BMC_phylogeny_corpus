Abstract
Background: Dormancy of buds is a critical developmental process that allows perennial plants
to survive extreme seasonal variations in climate. Dormancy transitions in underground crown
buds of the model herbaceous perennial weed leafy spurge were investigated using a 23 K element
cDNA microarray. These data represent the first large-scale transcriptome analysis of dormancy
in underground buds of an herbaceous perennial species. Crown buds collected monthly from
August through December, over a five year period, were used to monitor the changes in the
transcriptome during dormancy transitions.
Results: Nearly 1,000 genes were differentially-expressed through seasonal dormancy transitions.
Expected patterns of gene expression were observed for previously characterized genes and
physiological processes indicated that resolution in our analysis was sufficient for identifying shifts
in global gene expression.
Conclusion: Gene ontology of differentially-expressed genes suggests dormancy transitions
require specific alterations in transport functions (including induction of a series of mitochondrial
substrate carriers, and sugar transporters), ethylene, jasmonic acid, auxin, gibberellic acid, and
abscisic acid responses, and responses to stress (primarily oxidative and cold/drought).
Comparison to other dormancy microarray studies indicated that nearly half of the genes identified
in our study were also differentially expressed in at least two other plant species during dormancy
transitions. This comparison allowed us to identify a particular MADS-box transcription factor
related to the DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX genes from peach and hypothesize that it may
play a direct role in dormancy induction and maintenance through regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS
T.

Background
Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is a perennial range land
weed that infests the great plains of the US and Canada.
This invasive and noxious weed maintains its perennial
growth habit through the seasonal production of numerous underground adventitious buds on the lateral roots
and crown (an underground portion of the stem derived
originally from the hypocotyl). Crown and root buds of
leafy spurge are capable of manifesting the three types of
dormancy (para-, endo- and ecodormancy) described by
Lang et al. [1]. In general, new leafy spurge crown buds
become visible in late May to early June, following flowering, and progressively enlarge throughout the summer
and fall seasons [2]. These crown buds, once formed, will
not initiate new shoot growth unless the top of the plant
is destroyed. Thus, initiation of new shoot growth is
inhibited in newly formed crown and root buds during
the growing season (usually from April to October) by
mechanisms akin to apical dominance, or paradormancy.
Studies on both crown and root buds indicate that two
separate signals produced by the aerial portion of the
plant are capable of maintaining bud dormancy [3]. These
signals are auxin, likely acting through previously
described mechanisms [4,5] and sugar acting through
ABA/GA signalling that appear to regulate the G1 to S
transition of the cell cycle [6,7].
Depending on yearly environmental conditions, crown
buds of leafy spurge transition from paradormancy
through endodormancy and into ecodormancy between
early October and the middle of November [2]. This transition is important since early frosts could destroy the aerial portion of the plant, and thus initiate new shoot
growth which would in turn be vulnerable to later frosts.
Indeed, plants which are moved into growth-conducive
conditions following the transition to endodormancy will
not readily initiate new growth even if the above-ground
portion of the plant is removed, suggesting that signals
within the buds themselves inhibits growth. After an
extended period of cold temperatures (usually coinciding
with an average bare soil temp of 0°C which generally
occurs by late November or early December in the location tested), crown buds are released from endodormancy
and concomitantly become flowering competent [2].
However, by this time, consistently cold winter conditions
induce a state of ecodormancy which blocks new shoot
growth from the buds until spring conditions allow for
renewed growth. We are interested in understanding the
physiological processes involved in signals regulating the
transitions between para-, endo- and ecodormancy.
There is emerging but incomplete information on the
mechanisms by which dormancy transitions occur in
adventitious buds of perennials. Chouard [8] noted commonalities between environmental signals and condi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/536

tions regulating both vernalization (and hence flowering
competence) and breaking of endodormancy. These
observations have been recently reiterated and extended
to develop a hypothesis that the signalling pathways regulating endodormancy induction and breaking might
share components with those regulating flowering competency [9,10]. Indeed, work by Böhlenius [11] has demonstrated that constitutive expression of a flowering
regulatory gene in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), is sufficient for preventing seasonal
growth cessation induced by short day conditions. Likewise, over-expression of PHYA prevented short dayinduced repression of PtFT2 in the leaves, and CENTRORADIALIS-LIKE 1 (CENL1), a gene related to FT but with
opposite effect on flowering, in the rib meristem [12].
Indeed, the same study went on to show that PHYA overexpression prevented endodormancy per se. Combined,
these data suggest that short day-induced growth cessation is the first step towards endodormancy induction,
and that this first step can be impacted by expression of FT
and related genes.
A mutation in peach caused by a deletion of a locus containing several tandomly duplicated MADS-box transcription factors, known as evergrowing (evg), prevents
dormancy induction [13-15]. Similar genes were differentially expressed following dormancy transitions in raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) and apricot (Prunus mume) [16,17].
These MADS-box genes (named DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADSBOX or DAM genes) are related to SHORT
VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and AGAMOUS LIKE24
(AGL24) of Arabidopsis but form a separate clade within
this group [15]. In Arabidopsis, mutations in SVP promote
early flowering [18]. Interestingly, experimental evidence
indicates that SVP negatively regulates expression of FT in
Arabidopsis by binding to its promoter [19]. AGL24, a floral promoter, is up-regulated during vernalization [20].
Analysis of publicly available microarray data indicate
that both AGL24 and SVP are preferentially expressed during short day (SD) conditions relative to long day in
micro-dissected apical tissue harvested 0, 3, 5, and 7 days
after the shift to LD. Thus, SVP and AGL24 are regulated
by environmental conditions known to impact bud dormancy in perennial species.
In addition to DAM genes and FT/CENL1 with known or
suspected involvement in bud dormancy/growth, several
studies have been done on the impact of various dormancy transitions on the whole transcriptome of buds in
kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa), grape (Vitis riparia), raspberry, potato (Solanum tuberosum), and in the terminal
buds and cambial meristem of poplar (Populus tremuloidies) [21,22,16,23-25], Marion Wood-personal communication. These studies have shown that dormancy signals
impact numerous physiological processes including cell

division, oxidative stress, and flavone biosynthesis. Additionally, these studies have demonstrated changes in
expression patterns of numerous known regulatory genes
that could play a vital role in dormancy transitions, or in
regulating physiological processes impacted by dormancy
transitions. However, no comparison of these bud dormancy data sets has yet been done.

Results
Transcriptome analysis identifies differentially expressed
genes
Changes in the transcriptome of leafy spurge crown buds
samples, collected monthly from August to December for
5 consecutive years (2002–2006), were obtained by
microarray analyses (GEO accession # GSE8849). From
nearly 22,000 different unigene probes that showed consistent hybridization, about 1400 were identified as differentially expressed (p value < 0.005) based on ANOVA of
samples grouped by month. Cluster analysis of these 1400
genes indicated that the monthly samples fell into two
main groups (Figure 1). One group contained crown bud
samples collected in August and September along with
three crown bud samples collected in October. The
remaining cluster was roughly divided into four sub-clusters; two containing nearly all of the December crown bud
samples and several November samples, with the remaining clusters made up of a mix of October and November

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in
regulating dormancy transitions in leafy spurge should
provide information needed to control this invasive weed.
Additionally, as there appears to be considerable conservation in the mechanisms regulating dormancy in other
perennial systems, information gained on the mechanisms regulating dormancy transitions in leafy spurge
could be used to develop means to control this critical
process in other perennial crops, horticultural species, and
weeds. We used newly developed high density cDNA
microarrays which contained >19,000 unigenes
sequences from leafy spurge. Additionally, the arrays contained >4,000 unigenes from cassava (Manihot esculenta
Crantz), a related species, that generally hybridize to leafy
spurge cDNAs [26] but which were not present in the leafy
spurge EST collection. This array was used to follow transcriptome changes associated with dormancy transitions

in leafy spurge over a 5 year period. Changes associated
with each specific dormancy transition (para to endo and
endo to eco) are noted, and commonalities between these
results and other transcriptomic analyses of dormancy
were identified.

crown bud samples. The same clustering of samples based
on expression was observed using principle component
analysis and explained the majority of the variation
observed in the data set (data not shown).
There is known yearly variability associated with the transition of crown buds into and out of endodormancy
(Anderson J.V., personal communication). Thus, these
results were interpreted to mean that the cluster containing all the August and September samples represented
crown buds still in paradormancy. Likewise, the clusters
containing December and November samples were considered to represent buds that were ecodormant and flowering competent. The remaining sub-clusters were
considered to be endodormant. P-values and q-values
based on differences between samples from the three dormancy states identified 999 genes with significant p-values (p < 0.005).
Probable Arabidopsis orthologues, MIPS designations,
KOG#, GO annotations, and BLASTX hits were determined for these probes when possible (see Additional file
1). GO annotations indicated genes involved in jasmonic
acid signalling, unidimensional cell growth, and transport
were significantly over-represented among the differentially-expressed genes (Table 1). MIPS annotation suggested that genes involved in protein fate, protein
synthesis, cellular communication, energy, protein binding, development, and cell fate were the most significantly
over-represented (Table 2).
MAPMAN analysis indicated that genes involved in metabolic pathways for glycolysis, transport (calcium and
major intrinsic proteins), protein synthesis initiation,
auxin responses, and redox regulation were the most overrepresented (Table 3). Surprisingly, although glycolysis
genes were both over-represented and generally induced
through the dormancy transitions, almost none of the
genes involved in the TCA cycle were present among the
differentially-expressed genes.
BLASTX searches for possible gene function indicated that
numerous genes with similarity to known or suspected
cold stress response genes were up-regulated in fall and
winter. Likewise, numerous genes with similarity to
known or suspected cell division genes were generally
down-regulated through seasonal transitions from summer to winter. There were also many genes with similarities to transport associated functions that were
preferentially expressed as dormancy progressed from the
fall through the winter (See Additional file 2). Some specific differentially-expressed genes of note included a
SWITCHING2/SUCROSE NON_FERMENTING2 (SWI2/
SNF2) which encodes a protein known to play a role in
chromatin remodelling [27], were steadily down-regu-

lated during seasonal dormancy progression. Genes similar to EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), GIGANTEA (GI),
CONSTANS (CO), FLAVIN BINDING KELCH REPEAT FBOX1 (FKF1), CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1
(CCA1), PHYA, and several circadian-regulated PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATORS (PRRs) that are possible components of the circadian clock regulatory pathway [28,29]
are all up-regulated during the seasonal progression (from
paradormancy through to ecodormancy).
Expression of a subset of differentially-expressed genes
was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 2). Comparison of these genes suggests that the general trends in
expression observed by microarray analysis are similar but
somewhat muted as compared to that observed by RTPCR. 100% of the 27 genes tested by RT-PCR showed similar trends to those observed using microarray analysis,
indicating the robustness of our analysis.
Gene expression characteristics of different dormancy
states
Analyses were done to identify genes that showed differential expression unique to specific dormant states (See
Additional file 3a–c). Only 16 genes were preferentially
expressed during endodormancy (see Additional file 3b).
One of these contains a helix-loop helix motif characteristic of DNA binding transcription factors, and another was
similar to DROUGHT RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING
III (DREBIII), a transcription factor known to play a role
in drought and cold responses in plants. Only 5 genes
were significantly down-regulated specifically during
endodormancy. Genes involved in flavanoid biosynthesis
were relatively highly expressed during paradormancy
and then down-regulated during endo- and ecodormancy.
Likewise, several growth regulating genes such as
GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR 5 (GRF5), a RETINOBLASTOMA-like, and ARABIDOPSIS MEI2 LIKE1 (AML1)
are also preferentially expressed in ecodormant buds (see
Additional file 2).
Comparison to other dormancy microarray studies
identifies common signals and processes
There have been four other published microarray studies
on bud dormancy in raspberry [16], poplar [23], potato
[25] and grape [21]. Additionally, there are as yet unpublished studies completed on kiwifruit (Marion Wood et
al., personal communication), and studies on seasonal
dormancy in poplar cambial meristems [22,24]. TBlastX
comparisons between the genes represented on the arrays
from these various datasets (see Additional file 4) indicated that 431 leafy spurge genes were differentially
expressed in both poplar buds induced into dormancy by
SD and in our leafy spurge dataset (240 showed the same
expression trend in the transition from paradormancy
into endodormancy). Likewise, 722 were differentially

The putative function of the 110 differentially-expressed

stress, and GA responses are important conserved proc-

genes differentially expressed in three or more species also
identified these same processes and additional common

The number of differentially-expressed genes with a given MIPS annotation present on the array was used to determine the expected number of
differentially-expressed genes with that annotation. The number of observed differentially expressed genes was compared to the expected number

AMER BINDING PROTEIN-1b (HBP-1b), HOX 4, WRKY
(A1244, 30, 53), and nine different zinc finger-encoding
genes. One MYB and one zinc finger-containing transcription factor were among those genes noted as commonly
differentially-expressed in poplar buds, cambial meristems, and seed dormancy transitions [23]. Only 41 other
genes were differentially expressed during dormancy transitions in both Arabidopsis seed and leafy spurge buds, and
of these, only 16 were expressed in a similar manner in
response to dormancy transitions (data not shown). No

obvious signals or pathways were common to both seed
and bud dormancy transitions were detected.
ABA levels drop following endo- to ecodormancy transition
ABA levels are correlated with bud dormancy in several
species and tend to drop as buds transition through ecodormancy [30-32]. However, very few putative ABA-regulated genes were down-regulated (see Additional file 2).
To determine if ABA levels changed between endo and
ecodormancy, ABA levels were measured over two years in

There is growing evidence that DAM genes play a role in
regulating dormancy transitions. Two clones (DV112957
and DV114890) representing different DAM genes were
present on our microarrays and both were found to be differentially regulated (see Additional file 2). Probes specific to the 3' end of these genes were developed and used
to probe northern blots to confirm the differential expression observed from the microarray results. The leafy
spurge DAM1a gene was strongly up-regulated only in
endodormant buds whereas DAM2 was induced during
endodormancy and maintained at high levels through
ecodormancy (Figure 3). Because the DAM1 probe was
shown to have minimal but detectable cross-hybridization to a DAM2 clone (data not shown), it is unclear if the

an alternate splice product of DAM1 (of which several are

other DAM family members.
FT over-expression prevents seasonal growth cessation
required for endodormancy induction in poplar [11].
Because DAM genes are very similar to SVP, and SVP negatively regulates FT in Arabidopsis [19], we hypothesize
that the DAM genes may negatively regulate FT expression. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we characterized
and compared the expression of an FT-like gene from leafy
spurge to that of the DAM genes to determine if they were
reciprocally expressed. Quantitative RT-PCR on the same
RNA used for northern blot expression analysis of DAM1
and DAM2 demonstrated that the FT-like gene was downregulated in crown buds of leafy spurge concomitantly
with the induction of DAM gene expression (Figure 3).

Discussion
Cell cycle and cold responsive genes are differentially
expressed during dormancy transitions
Approximately 50% of the differentially-expressed genes
identified by our microarray analysis show a consistent
pattern of incremental induction or repression during the
transitions from paradormancy through to ecodormancy.
However, about a third of the genes showed their greatest
change in expression in the transition from the paradormant state to the endodormant state (see Additional file
3a). The timing of this transition usually coincides with
decreasing night time temperatures. Thus, it was not surprising to see a majority of the genes involved in cold
hardening such as ICE1, DREB and the type 3 LEA genes
are up-regulated during the transition from para- to endodormancy (Figure 4, see Additional file 3a). Likewise,
many of the genes involved in cell division are down-regulated during the transition between endodormancy and
ecodormancy (see Additional file 3c). Previous studies
have shown that HISTONE H3 is strongly down-regulated
late in endodormancy or early in ecodormancy [2]. The
microarray results show a similar pattern of expression for
most of the growth-responsive genes (Figure 4). Combined, these expected results suggest that the analysis of
the arrays was appropriate for identifying differentiallyexpressed genes.

Intriguingly, Espinosa-Ruiz [33] found that endodormancy induction brought about reduced transcript levels
of cell cycle genes, but under conditions of ecodormancy
these same genes were not repressed. However, unlike our
study, ecodormancy in the Espinosa-Ruiz study was
brought about by SD, whereas cold was the primary signal
maintaining ecodormancy in our study. Thus, the different environmental conditions that maintain ecodormancy in these two studies appear to have different
impact on cell division. However, data collected by Druart
[24] on cambial meristems indicated that cell cycle genes
were down-regulated during the transition from growth to
endodormancy, and that the levels then stayed low or
increased slightly during ecodormancy.
Several notable growth regulating genes that were preferentially expressed in ecodormant buds (see Additional file
2) included a RETINOBLASTOMA-like (RB-like) protein,
GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR5 (GRF5), and ARABIDOPSIS MEI2-LIKE1 (AML1). RB is involved in cell cycle
inhibition and acts both through sequestration of several
E2F transcription factor family members-positive regulators of cell division, and through chromatin modification
of key cell cycle regulatory genes [34,35]. GRF5 encodes a
putative transcription factor that is involved in regulating
leafy growth and morphology [36] and AML1 is a
MEIOSIS2-like (MEI2-like) RNA-binding protein gene,
required for meiosis and vegetative development and
whose protein interacts with RAPAMYCIN-TOR (RAPTOR), another protein involved in regulating cell division
[37,38]. It is surprising that RB-like, GRF5 and AML1 are
preferentially expressed in a dormancy state where many
of the genes involved in active growth such as histones,
cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases are repressed. Our
observations can be interpreted to suggest that these particular growth-regulators are activated by conditions
besides growth induction, and may be turned on primarily in response to signals regulating growth competency
such as extended cold. Extended cold is known to induce
growth competency in many perennial buds through
unknown mechanisms. These genes may provide a convenient place to begin investigating this process. It will
also be of interest to identify some of the targets regulated
by these genes and determine if they are also preferentially
expressed in dormant buds, or if they are maintained in a
suppressed state.
Circadian responses associated with seasonal dormancy
transitions
The observation that several circadian regulatory genes are
differentially expressed during dormancy transitions was
not surprising (see Additional file 2). However, the fact
that many of them were differentially expressed in underground buds and that all of them were up-regulated following the paradormancy to endodormancy transition

was initially surprising. However these results are consistent with studies in chest nut (Castanea sativa Mill.) that
indicated constitutive expression of circadian clock genes
during winter dormancy [39]. Although crown buds do
appear to turn green and activate several photosynthetic
genes such as LIGHT HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL A/BBINDING PROTEIN during ecodormancy [2,40], it was
surprising to see changes in putative circadian responses
in organs that are often below the soil surface. Also, the

Conserved regulation of flowering and dormancy genes in
perennials
Perhaps the most interesting result from these studies is
the finding that DAM genes are differentially expressed
during dormancy transitions in leafy spurge, poplar,
potato, and raspberry. The importance of this differential
expression was not obvious when each study was considered on its own. Initial comparisons between our data set
and the data set from raspberry identified similar MADSbox genes as differentially expressed in both species. Thus,
an effort was taken to catalogue DAM gene expression in
other species as studies were made available. In raspberry,
a DAM-like gene was down-regulated upon dormancy
release [16]. Another DAM-like gene was reported to be
up-regulated in poplar after 4 weeks under dormancyinducing SD conditions (albeit not significantly) and was
significantly up- or down-regulated in ABI3 under- and
over-expressing lines respectively [23]. Moreover, the
same poplar gene was significantly up-regulated in the
cambial meristem upon endodormancy induction and

then down-regulated upon the transition from endodormancy to ecodormancy [24]. A close relative, MADS16,
was identified as up-regulated in potato tuber meristems
during the transition from endodormancy to growth [25].
However, our results provide the first evidence that different members of this gene family may have variable expression patterns through seasonal dormancy transitions
(Figure 3a).
Although conserved regulatory gene expression patterns
are suggestive of a functional role, such data is only correlative. Direct evidence that DAM genes are regulating dormancy comes from work on the evg mutation in peach.
The evg mutation prevents terminal peach buds from
going dormant in the fall [13]. The locus containing the
evg mutation has recently been cloned and sequenced
[14,15]. Sequencing through this locus indicated that the
main lesion was a deletion of a series of tandomly
repeated copies of DAM genes. Our data highlights the
fact that not only are these genes required for endodormancy induction, but that DAM genes are induced by
environmental signals known to regulate endodormancy.

SD and cold temperatures regulate dormancy in a species
specific manner. SD rather than cold temperature is the
primary signal regulating endodormancy induction in
poplar [41]. In some rosaceous species such as apple and
pear, cold temperatures are the primary environmental
signal inducing endodormancy [42]. Experiments are currently underway to determine the environmental parameters required for endodormancy induction in leafy spurge,
however preliminary experiments suggest SD is not sufficient for endodormancy induction. However, it should be
noted that there is evidence of synergistic cross-talk
between SD and low-temperature signalling pathways
[43], and thus it is possible, if not likely, that cold and day
length signalling mechanisms regulating dormancy may
be shared across species. It will be interesting to compare
DAM gene regulation in species that primarily respond to
either light or temperature signals for dormancy induction.

confirm their functionality. However, consistent with our
hypothesis, the FT-like gene is reciprocally regulated with
expression of our DAM genes.

We hypothesize that DAM proteins regulate dormancy
transitions through interaction with FT-like genes. In Arabidopsis, SVP may be involved in sensing changes in ambient temperatures and transducing this information to
regulate flowering by inhibiting FT expression through
binding of CArG motifs [19]. In poplar, over expression of
FT inhibits growth cessation and bud set associated with
seasonal bud dormancy [11]. Expression of FT or FT-like
genes such as CENL1 are down-regulated in grape buds
(Fennell, personal communication), poplar [12,23], and
spruce [44] during induction of endodormancy. Our paradigm predicts that FT should be reciprocally expressed
with DAM genes. However, no FT genes were present in
the leafy spurge or cassava EST databases and thus not
present on the microarrays.

Work is currently underway to identify the cis- and transacting signals regulating DAM gene expression in leafy
spurge and to study the impact of constitutive and dominant negative regulation of the leafy spurge DAM genes on
bud dormancy and flowering in leafy spurge and several
heterologous systems. Likewise, work is underway to
functionally characterize and to clone the regulatory
regions of the FT-like genes from leafy spurge and to determine if they contain the conserved CArG motifs, and to
determine if these FT-like genes are directly regulated by
DAM genes from leafy spurge during induction of dormancy.

As an initial test of our hypothesis, we cloned and characterized the expression of an FT-like gene from leafy spurge
(Accession # EU707393). Several cDNA clones and a
genomic clone (Accession # EU707394) contained the 3'
end of FT-like genes (49% of the coding region). We suggest our clones represent FT orthologues rather than
orthologues of the closely related gene TFL because 1) the
FT-like genomic clone contained an intron with similar
size and location to the last intron in the Arabidopsis FT
gene, 2) a BLASTX search of the Arabidopsis database demonstrated that FT was the top blast hit (with a score of 2e39) to our clones, 3) cluster analysis of DNA sequence
placed our FT-like genes with other FT genes and away
from related TFL genes, including several full-length TFLlike genes from leafy spurge (Accession #s DV157402,
DV135948, and DV121805), and 4) our FT-like gene is
expressed preferentially in leaves and is diurnally regulated as would be expected of a functional FT orthologue
(see Additional file 5, 6, 7). Work is continuing to clone
full length copies of FT-like genes from leafy spurge and

Some questions remain concerning the role of FT and
DAM genes through dormancy transitions. Although it
seems likely that DAM genes and FT may play a direct role
in seasonal growth cessation and possibly in the transition from paradormancy to endodormancy, it should be
noted that at least DAM2 is expressed well into ecodormancy. Likewise, FT-like is also down-regulated well into
ecodormancy. Thus, the DAM gene and FT-like probably
do not play any role in the transition to growth competence that occurs during the shift from endodormancy to
ecodormancy. This suggests that there are other signals
and mechanisms involved in controlling the transition
from endo- to ecodormancy and concurrent induction of
floral and growth competence in leafy spurge.

Chromatin remodelling in dormancy transitions
Given the similarities between the environmental and
molecular signals regulating both flowering and dormancy, it is tempting to speculate that the same mechanisms regulating chromatin remodelling processes and
genes regulating vernalization and flowering competence
in Arabidopsis, also regulate the re-initiation of growth
competence in vegetative buds of perennials following
extended cold treatments. Numerous genes involved in
chromatin remodelling are differentially expressed during
dormancy transitions in leafy spurge and other species. A
member of the chromosome condensation (RCC1) family of proteins which interact with histones is strongly upregulated in leafy spurge crown buds during induction of
endodormancy. Interestingly, a similar protein is downregulated in potato buds transitioning from endodormancy to growth [25]. Additionally, RB-related proteins,
also affecting chromatin remodelling as previously discussed, are differentially-expressed in leafy spurge, poplar
and potato (see Additional file 8).

Ruttink [23], found four different chromatin remodelling
genes that were significantly up-regulated prior to endo-

Page 11 of 17

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:536

dormancy induction, but considered the induction to be
too early to impact the transition to endodormancy. However, in their studies, they did not look at dormancy
release, and thus it is impossible to determine if these or
other chromatin remodelling genes might be differentially expressed in response to extended cold treatments.
Law and Suttle [45], noted that dormancy release in
potato was concomitant with increased histone acetylation. Likewise, chromatin remodelling was suggested by
Druart [24] to explain the large scale changes in transcription observed in poplar cambial meristems during seasonal dormancy transitions. In both leafy spurge and
poplar, a SWI2/SNF2-like gene similar to At5g66750, was
significantly down-regulated (steadily through dormancy
transitions in leafy spurge and after 4 weeks of SD in poplar). SWI2/SNF2 proteins are needed as part of a complex
known to modify chromatin and enhance expression of
specific genes [46].
Auxin responses in seasonal dormancy transitions
Other comparisons between the transition from paradormancy to endodormancy and from endodormancy to ecodormancy indicate that five of the six genes with blast hits
to genes involved in auxin responses show the greatest differential expression during the paradormancy to endodormancy transition. MAPMAN analysis also indicated an
increase in expression of genes involved in auxin metabolism (Table 3). This also might be expected since as the
plants senesce during the transition into endodormancy,
auxin transport from the above ground tissue would be
reduced. Indeed, a similar argument was made to explain
observed induction of a DORMANCY-ASSOCIATED,
AUXIN-REPRESSED (DAAR) gene in crown buds of leafy
spurge [2]. DAAR genes are known to be repressed by
auxin in several plant systems [47,48]. These observations
are consistent with findings of Schrader [22], suggesting
that auxin responses may be modulated in both cambial
meristem and adventitious buds during endodormancy,
and Li [49] that indicated auxin levels were reduced in terminals buds of silver birch (Betula pendula) during shortday-induced dormancy.

BLASTX analysis of the differentially-expressed genes indicated down-regulation of genes involved in flavanoid biosynthesis in buds that have passed from paradormancy
through to ecodormancy (see Additional file 2). Flavanoids have been implicated in inhibition of polar auxin
transport [50-53]. The ability of buds to export auxin has
been hypothesized to be the driving force behind the signals regulating apical dominance [54]. In potato buds,
auxin levels steadily increase during dormancy and then
drop off after dormancy is released [55]. Combined, these
data suggest that as the buds lose apical dominance, they
may be preparing to export auxin even when the buds are
not transitioning into an actively growing state. These data

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/536

support earlier microarray studies on root buds of leafy
spurge which indicated that flavanoid biosynthetic genes
were down-regulated following release from paradormancy [56].
It should be noted, however, that although several AUX/
IAA-like genes are down-regulated during the transition
from paradormancy to endodormancy, a gene with similarity to MORE AXILLARY BRANCHES (MAX2) that
encodes a protein involved in inhibition of auxin transport [57,54], is up-regulated (see Additional file 2). Thus,
it appears that there are opposing mechanisms involved
in auxin production, transport, and perception acting
simultaneously during dormancy transitions, and more
work will be needed to ascertain the relevance of this hormone in seasonal dormancy transitions.
JA, ethylene, and ABA responses in seasonal dormancy
transitions
Many of the genes associated with cold, drought and ABA
responses are preferentially expressed later during endoand ecodormancy (Figure 4). From work in poplar and
potato, there appears to be an emerging picture that a
transient spike in ethylene (or ethylene perception) precedes, and is necessary for, the initiation of endodormancy [58,23]. A role of ethylene in ABA-induced growth
inhibition in systems other than bud endodormancy has
been previously hypothesized [59]. Work on ABA accumulation in Citrus suggests that ethylene may directly
induce the key ABA biosynthetic gene 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE (NCED1) [60]. Our data
appears consistent with the above theory in that there are
at least 10 genes associated with ethylene production or
ethylene responses that are most highly expressed during
paradormancy, but which were repressed later during
endo- and ecodormancy.

Intriguingly, ABA levels were elevated during endodormancy and dropped following the transition to ecodormancy (Table 4). Loss of ABA through ecodormancy has
been observed in several plant species [30-32]. However,
all but four expected ABA-regulated genes are induced
during the endo- to ecodormancy transition (see Additional file 2), and of the four that showed reduced expression, only one (DREBIII) is significantly down-regulated.
A possible explanation for this observation is that many
ABA-regulated genes are also cold-regulated, and there is
evidence that cold and ABA regulates these genes through
independent pathways [61].
The high numbers of JA-regulated genes suggest a possible
role for this hormone in seasonal dormancy progression
(see Additional file 2). JA is generally associated with
wounding, and there are also reports that JA acts synergistically with ethylene [62-64]. JA is also known to induce

Page 12 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:536

vegetative storage protein expression in numerous plant
systems [65-68]. Likewise, JA is known to induce tuber
formation in potato [69]. Thus, increased JA perception
during paradormancy might be needed to prepare the
plants for winter. Vegetative storage proteins were also the
most over-represented among the differentially-expressed
genes based on MIPS FunCat designation (Table 2). A
similar argument was noted for the increase in differentially-expressed JA-responsive genes during the transition
into endodormancy in poplar cambial meristems [24].

Conclusion
These results provide the first indication of changes in
gene expression in underground buds of a herbaceous
perennial associated with seasonal dormancy transitions.
Changes in gene expression suggest numerous hormonal,
physiological, and developmental responses occur during
transitions from paradormancy through endodormancy
and into ecodormancy including alterations in responses
to ABA, JA, and auxin, and in cell cycle, cold-hardening,
transport, and glycolysis. Additionally, comparison
between the transcriptome changes observed in our experiments and those from similar dormancy transitions in
other plant species allowed the identification of DAM
genes that encode a specific group of MADS-box transcription factors associated with endodormancy induction.
The fact that DAM genes are similar to another MADS-box
gene (SVP) that negatively regulates FT in Arabidopsis, and
the finding that over-expression of FT in poplar prevents
seasonal growth cessation led to the hypothesis that
induction of DAM genes may be required for inhibition of
FT expression. In support of this hypothesis, FT expression in leafy spurge crown buds was co-ordinately down
regulated as DAM gene expression was induced.

Methods
Plant material
A population of leafy spurge plants was initiated from cuttings of the same ND001 line used in several previous
studies on leafy spurge bud growth and development [2].
Plant were maintained in an outside garden plot in Fargo,
ND and supplemental water and fertilizer was added as
needed for several years prior to initial bud collections.
Crown buds were collected monthly (August through
December from 2002–2006). Buds were always collected
between 10:00 AM and 1:00 PM for all samples. Environmental data at and around the time of bud collections are
noted (see Additional file 9). Bud samples were stored
immediately in liquid N2 and then at -80 C until RNA
extraction.
ABA extraction and analysis
Each sample consisted of 0.5 to 0.6 gm of pooled buds
collected in Oct. or Dec. 2005 and 2006. Samples were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Two or more sam-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/536

ples were analyzed in duplicate for each time point. The
tissues were thawed at 4 C in 80% (v/v) aqueous acetone,
homogenized, extracted, purified, and the ABA content
quantified by HPLC-MS using an internal standard of 50
ng [2H]6-(+)-ABA (OlChemIm Ltd, Czech Republic) as
described by Destefano-Beltran [70].
RNA extraction and microarray analysis
Crown buds were ground to a fine powder in liquid N2
and RNA was extracted using the pine tree extraction protocol [71]. RNA quality and quantity was confirmed by
spectrophotometry and denaturing agarose gels. Labelled
cDNA was prepared from 30 μg of total RNA using the
Alexa Fluor cDNA labelling kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to manufacture's protocols. Labelled cDNAs
were hybridized to a custom made 23 K element microarray that contained 19,808 unigenes from the leafy spurge
EST database [72] and an additional 4,129 unigenes from
a cassava EST database [73]. The cassava unigenes did not
have any obvious similarity to available leafy spurge ESTs,
however, many of them showed strong hybridization with
labelled leafy spurge cDNA [26]. A rolling circle dye swap
hybridization scheme [74] was used to compare gene
expression between samples. Microarray hybridization
was visualized using an AFFYmetrix 428 scanner (see
Additional file 10) and spot intensities and background
was quantified using Affymetrix Jaguar software. GeneMaths XT 5.1 software (Applied Maths Inc. Austin, TX)
was used for statistical analysis and clustering of the dataset.

Hybridization intensities were log2 transformed, and
arrays were centred and normalized against each other.
Arrays were grouped by month and ANOVA was used to
identify genes that were differentially expressed (p <
0.005). Cluster analysis of expression pattern for differentially-expressed genes was done to identify likely paradormant, endodormant and ecodormant samples. The entire
data set was then regrouped according to dormancy state,
and subjected to ANOVA again to identify genes that are
differentially expressed (p < 0.005) through the dormancy
transitions. To identify genes with significant differential
expression during specific dormancy states, T-tests were
used to determine p-values that a given gene was differential in one dormant state, but not differential between the
other dormant states (ie. paradormant specific genes
would have p < 0.005 between paradormancy and endodormancy and p > 0.005 between endodormancy and
ecodormancy).
Putative Arabidopsis orthologues were identified by
BLASTX homology with a cut off of 1.0 E-5. Likewise,
TBLASTX was used to identify similar genes present on
other microarrays used for dormancy studies (cut off of
1.0 E-5) (see Additional file 8). Where possible contigs

represented by spotted cDNAs were used for the BLAST
comparisons. AGI designations for Arabidopsis genes were
used in conjunction with MAPMAN to identify biochemical and signalling pathways represented by the differentially-expressed genes.
RT-PCR and northern blot expression analysis
Primers were designed (see Additional file 11) to specifically amplify genes identified as differentially expressed
using sequences from the EST database[72,73]. cDNA
from bud samples collected during the designated years
was prepared, quantified, and checked for quality by separation on agarose gels. Equal amounts of cDNA were
used in each reaction and reactions were run in triplicate.
SYBR green and the endogenous ROX reference dye were
used to determine relative CT values. For RT-PCR of the
FT-like gene, the primer-probe combination was designed
by Applied Biosystems Custom Taqman(R) Gene Expression Assay Service based on sequence from the genomic
clone: reverse primer GCTGGTCTTGGACTCTCATACC,
forward primer GGTGACTGATATTCCAGCAACTACT,
and probe TCTCTTGCCCATAGCTTG. The probe was
designed to span the last intron in the gene to eliminate
signal from contaminating genomic DNA or un-spliced
RNAs.

Probes for northern analysis were produced by PCR from
full length cDNA clones of DAM1 (EU334633) and
DAM2 (EU339320). Primers for DAM1 specific probes
were (5') GAGTTATCTACTCTTTGTGATG and (3')
CAATTGTCAACTATTTATTGGATGG and amplified a 260
bp fragment containing a portion of the coding region (of
which 83 nt were common with DAM2) plus the 3' UTR.
DAM2 primers were (5') TGACTCGGGTGATCGAAAG
and (3') AGTCGCTCGTTCTCTTCC and amplified a 313
bp product covering the 3' portion of the coding region
(none of which was homologous to DAM1). These fragments were radio-labelled and used to probe a northern
blot containing equal loadings (10 μg each) of total crown
bud RNA (collected monthly in 2004) separated on a
denaturing agarose gel.
