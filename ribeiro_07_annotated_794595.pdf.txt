Abstract
Background: Saliva of blood-sucking arthropods contains a cocktail of antihemostatic agents and
immunomodulators that help blood feeding. Mosquitoes additionally feed on sugar meals and have
specialized regions of their glands containing glycosidases and antimicrobials that might help control
bacterial growth in the ingested meals. To expand our knowledge on the salivary cocktail of Ædes
ægypti, a vector of dengue and yellow fevers, we analyzed a set of 4,232 expressed sequence tags
from cDNA libraries of adult female mosquitoes.
Results: A nonredundant catalogue of 614 transcripts (573 of which are novel) is described,
including 136 coding for proteins of a putative secretory nature. Additionally, a two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis of salivary gland (SG) homogenates followed by tryptic digestion of selected
protein bands and MS/MS analysis revealed the expression of 24 proteins. Analysis of tissue-specific
transcription of a subset of these genes revealed at least 31 genes whose expression is specific or
enriched in female SG, whereas 24 additional genes were expressed in female SG and in males but
not in other female tissues. Most of the 55 proteins coded by these SG transcripts have no known
function and represent high-priority candidates for expression and functional analysis as
antihemostatic or antimicrobial agents. An unexpected finding is the occurrence of four protein
families specific to SG that were probably a product of horizontal transfer from prokaryotic
organisms to mosquitoes.
Conclusion: Overall, this paper contributes to the novel identification of 573 new transcripts, or
near 3% of the Æ. ægypti proteome assuming a 20,000-protein set, and to the best-described
sialome of any blood-feeding insect.

Background
Ædes ægypti is a highly anthropophagic and cosmopolitan
mosquito vector of epidemic dengue and yellow fever. To
achieve fast blood feeding, adult female mosquitoes inject
a complex salivary mixture into their hosts while probing
for blood. Mosquito saliva, like that of other blood-feeding animals, has antihemostatic and antiinflammatory
activities that counteract host responses that would otherwise restrict blood flow or call the attention of the host to
the feeding site [1,2]. A preliminary transcriptome of
adult female salivary glands (SG) has been previously
reported [3] where 32 full-length transcripts have been
described based on an analysis of 456 expressed sequence
tags (EST). Of these putative proteins, ten have been verified by Edman degradation of Coomassie blue-stained
bands from sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of SG homogenates. Most
salivary proteins found have no known function.
The genome of Æ. ægypti has been recently made available, facilitating further gene discovery. In this paper, we
present the analysis of an additional set of 3,776 SG cDNA
sequences (total of 4,232 compared with previous set of
456 clones). We describe 573 new transcripts, 136 of
which code for proteins of a putative secretory nature,
most of which have no known function. We expect this
work will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of blood feeding in arthropods and to the discovery
of novel pharmacologic agents.

Results and discussion
General description of the salivary transcriptome database
A total of 4,232 clones was included in the EST salivary
database, including 456 previously described [3]. The
average length of the sequences was 752 bp, with 1419
sequences containing a polyA signature (20 contiguous
A's). These clones assembled into 1,273 clusters (containing 2–261 sequences per cluster) and singletons (956
sequences). In this paper, we will use the word 'contig' to
refer to clusters of one or more sequences. Mitochondrial
sequences, identified by their match to sequenced Aedes
albopictus and anopheline mitochondrial genomes,
accounted for 73 EST from 13 clusters (thus far, the mitochondrial genome of Æ. ægypti is unknown). Of interest,
several of these mitochondrial sequences mapped to scaffolds named supercont1.593 and also to supercont1.600,
supercont1.929, and supercont1.363. Upon close inspections, these genomic scaffolds contain large segments of
high similarity to Ae. albopictus mitochondrial genome.
Accordingly, these contigs may be assigned to the mitochondrial genome in the final genome assembly, or may
represent translocation of Ae. aegypti mitochondrial genes
to the nuclear genome. To attempt a functional classification of these unique sequences, we compared them with
proteome databases by blastx and with protein motifs by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

rpsblast (see Methods). Following manual annotation of
these contigs, which included assignment of known or
putative functions to the translation products, they were
further divided into four categories: secreted (Sclass) with
352 contigs and 2,723 sequences; housekeeping (Hclass)
with 739 contigs and 1,264 sequences; transposable element (Tclass) with 5 contigs and 9 sequences; and a last
category composed of contigs coding for proteins of
unknown function (Uclass) with 177 contigs and 234
sequences. The unknown class may contain truncated
transcripts mainly mapping to 3' untranslated regions of
genes. Although the Sclass corresponds to only 27% of the
contigs, it consists of 64% of all EST, reflecting the relatively low complexity and abundance of the secretory
material of the SG, as indicated before [3].
Transcribed transposable elements
Nine transcripts in our database possibly derive from
transposable elements. Their translation products are similar to those of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus[4] and to Tc1-like transposase[5]. These transcripts
may indicate active ongoing transposition activity in Æ.
ægypti or, more likely, they may represent regulatory elements suppressing transposition of relatively recent
genome invasions.
Housekeeping gene products
Putative Hclass genes were further classified according to
their possible function (Table 1). Results are available
online and can be searched on the columns labeled
"Class" and "Comments" (Additional File 1) [6]. More
than 50% of the sequences in this class derive from transcripts associated with protein synthesis, energy metabolism, protein modification, and protein export.
Transporters and signal transduction gene products are
also highly represented in the library. EST matching transporter proteins were found for several V-type ATPase subunits, Na++K+ ATPases, Ca++ ATPases, aquaporin, and
several families of solute carriers. V-type ATPases have
been implicated in the secretion of saliva in Diptera [7].
Updated catalogue of salivary proteins
We used the transcriptome set (Additional File 1) [8] and
the Artemis tool to identify novel proteins coded in the Æ.
ægypti genome. We have also assembled our transcripts
with a set of ~220,000 EST of Æ. ægypti available in public
databases to obtain eventual full-length information of
translation products. This assembled EST dataset, similarly organized as that for AnoXcel [9], is available online
[10]. Using these tools, we identified 614 protein
sequences, mostly full length, deriving from the salivary
transcriptome of adult female Æ. ægypti mosquitoes. Of
these 614 protein sequences, 573 were identified and contributed to GenBank from this work, and the remaining
were previously known. Of these 614 proteins, we identi-

fied a set of 136 putative secreted proteins expressed in the
SG of Æ. ægypti, 97 of which are novel (Additional File 2)
[11].
To obtain additional information potentially useful to
address future functional analysis, we determined the tissue and sex specificity of a selected subset of 73 transcripts
encoding secreted proteins and corresponding to a total of
71 genes. These 73 transcripts were selected based on their
similarity to transcript families found in diverse mosquito
species, and in the presumption that their translated products might play a role either in sugar or blood feeding. Oligonucleotide primers suitable for amplification of
corresponding mRNA were employed for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplifications using as template total RNA extracted from female
SG, female carcasses (i.e. adult females from which SG
had been dissected), and whole adult males. Primers
amplifying the ribosomal protein S5 were used for normalization and as control. The results of this analysis are
summarized in Table 2. We previously used a similar assay
for the analysis of the Anopheles gambiæ salivary transcriptome [12] and obtained results overlapping very well with
the information independently obtained by Marinotti et
al. [13] using the Affymetrix microarray chip. The results
reported here also fit well with the data obtained comparing salivary versus nonsalivary libraries (Additional File 2)
[6,11]. With our assay, it is possible to distinguish three
broad classes of genes. First, genes that are female SG specific or whose expression is enriched in the female glands:
they are indicated as SG or ENR, respectively, in Table 2.

739

Products encoded by these genes are likely to play some
role in blood feeding, for example as antihemostatics or
immunomodulators. Among those genes analyzed, 31
belong to this class; more precisely, 23 were female gland
specific, and 8 were enriched in female SG. They include
both genes with unknown functions and genes known
from previous studies on other mosquito species to be
involved in the acquisition of blood meals (see below). A
second group is represented by genes expressed in female
glands and in adult males, without any expression in
female carcasses: these are identified as SG,M in Table 2.
It is very likely that most of these genes are gland specific
and expressed both in male and female glands. The corresponding products may be involved in sugar feeding, antimicrobial activity, or other gland functions; 24 transcripts
are members of this group. Finally, the last class includes
genes with ubiquitous expression, i.e. expressed at
approximately the same level in the three tissues examined and indicated as Ubiq in Table 2. These genes most
likely encode polypeptides involved in housekeeping
functions: 16 of the transcripts analyzed belong to this
group. The following is a detailed description of the fulllength transcripts found in the SG of adult female Æ.
ægypti and of their profile of expression.

The four classes are SG (signal found exclusively in adult female salivary glands); ENR (enriched in adult female salivary glands); SG,M (found in adult
female salivary glands and in males, but not in carcasses of adult females lacking salivary glands); and Ubiq (genes ubiquitously found in all tissues
tested). Clones marked with # were analyzed three times, all others twice. Clones 94468370, 48256697, and 94468634 may undergo alternative
splicing. Although clones 94468546 and 18568322 (30 kDa), 94468614, 18568300, and 18568302 (62 kDa) were assigned to SG class, some faint
bands were seen in some samples from males. Clones 94468620, 94468350, 94468634, and 42632615 (primer pairs 23, 3, 29, and 60) underwent 35
cycles due to low amplification levels.

all mosquito sialotranscriptomes where short (~15 kDa)
and long (~30 kDa) forms were recognized [15]. In An.
gambiæ, this gene family, except for one poorly transcribed gene, appears to be selectively expressed in the
female SG [17,18], indicating a role in blood feeding. This
protein family is distantly related to the odorant-binding
protein (OBP) family, which specializes in binding small
ligands [17]. Recently, some mosquito D7 proteins were
shown to bind and inhibit the action of biogenic amines
such as serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine, a function that might help blood feeding [18]. Additionally, one
short D7 protein from Anopheles stephensi, named hamadarin, was shown to prevent kallikrein activation by FactorXIIa [19]. Long D7 forms also exist in sand flies [16]
and Culicoides [20], indicating that this gene family was
recruited very early in the evolution of hematophagous
Nematocera.
In the mosquito An. gambiæ, five short and three long D7
proteins are known. Their genes are organized in a
inverted tandem repeat[21] where the coding region for
the three long proteins is followed by the five genes coding for the short protein in the reverse orientation [12]. In
Æ. ægypti, three short and two long D7 proteins map to
the assembled genome supercontig1.204 (Figure 1), and
one short D7 protein maps to supercontig1.253 (not
shown). The genomic region coding for the D7 proteins in
supercontig1.204 shows three short D7 genes followed by
two genes coding for long forms; however, while in
Anopheles the frame orientation of the short and long
forms is the same (but the short and long forms are in
reverse orientation to each other), in Ædes there is no consistent orientation (Figure 1A). Similarly to An. gambiæ,
all large Ædes D7 genes contain five exons (Figure 1B);
however, all short Ædes D7 genes have two exons (Figure
1C), including that in supercontig1.253 (not shown),
while in Anopheles, four of the five genes coding for short
D7 proteins have three exons. The anopheline gene coding for the two-exon gene is poorly expressed, leading to
the suggestion that this two-exon gene may be turning
into a pseudogene [18]. The differences between Anopheles and Ædes in the number of D7 coding genes, their
exon number, their orientation, and their chromosome
location (in Anopheles, all eight genes are clustered, while
one Ædes gene is far apart from the main cluster of five
genes) are consistent with the ~150 million years of separation between culicines and anophelines [22].
In agreement with the larger genome size of Ædes [23], the
five-gene D7 cassette of Ædes spans nearly 80 kb, four
times more than the eight-gene cassette of Anopheles. To
investigate whether additional genes were expressed
within the D7 gene cassette in Æ. ægypti, we mapped
~220,000 EST to the Æ. ægypti genome. No new identifiable expressed genes were revealed in the D7 region; how-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

ever, in the vicinity of the short D7 cassette, we found two
transcripts, both deriving from SG libraries, which map to
the intron of D7s3 and to the 3' region of the same gene
(Figure 2). Translations of these two EST do not reveal
extended open reading frames. This finding is reminiscent
to the D7 short gene region of Anopheles, which also has
an apparently noncoding EST mapping to the end of the
short cassette, but at its 5' end. We have hypothesized previously that these noncoding transcripts could be associated with transcriptional regulation of the cassette.
Alignment of the D7 sequences from Æ. ægypti with those
of Æ. albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus, An. gambiæ, and
one D7 salivary protein from the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis indicates, as shown before, that the short D7 proteins appear to be truncated versions of the long D7
proteins, which appear to be the ancestral type (Figure
3A). The resulting phylogram, using the sand fly sequence
as an outgroup, shows three clades without strong bootstrap support; however, the inner tree branches show considerably more conservation of the multiple forms within
genus than between genera. For example, the common
long D7 clade (Figure 3B) shows that two of the long D7
proteins of An. gambiæ are more closely related to each
other as are the Culex or the Ædes pair. Within the Ædes
genus, the Æ. albopictus and Æ. ægypti homologues are distinctly grouped together, indicating that they share a relatively recent common ancestor before the duplication
event, as expected from these two mosquitoes of the same
subgenus. The same pattern is visible in the culicine short
D7 clade (Figure 3B) where all short D7 proteins are more
related to each other within genus than between genera.
This is even more remarkable in the short D7 proteins of
Anopheles, where all short D7 proteins form a single clade
outside of their culicine counterparts. If the gene duplication events that lead to the formation of long and short
D7 proteins occurred in the primordial mosquito ancestral to both culicines and anophelines, the tree pattern
observed would be one where the orthologous pairs
would be more similar to each other between genera than
within genus. Two possible explanations may account for
the observed tree pattern: either the gene duplications
leading to the D7 expansions occurred independently
after the division of the culicine and anopheline lineages,
or some degree of gene conversion occurred within each
species, maintaining the uniformity of the genes within
species. This latter scenario is consistent with the proposed primordial role of the D7 proteins, e.g. sequestration of host serotonin released by thrombocytes at the site
of bite, a function that would require the D7 proteins to
be a major salivary protein constituent [3]. The gene
duplication event would be beneficial in allowing
increased transcript mass needed to create the substantial
amount of protein needed in the mosquito saliva to
chelate the near-micromolar concentration of the vasoac-

which are more that 30 kb apart.
Phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins
We report three members (one possibly truncated) of this
very ubiquitous protein family never found before in
sialotranscriptomes of blood-sucking arthropods [26,27],
two of which have clear signal peptide indicative of secretion. This protein family is known to bind lipids and was
also shown to have serine protease inhibitory capacity.
Their role in saliva is unknown. No enrichment was found
for these transcripts on the SG libraries when compared
with other libraries.

tive amine. Gene conversion events to maintain this function on multiple genes could be beneficial at this earlier
stage of blood feeding evolution. This phenomenon
would maintain intraspecific copies of the gene family
more similar to each other than to the orthologous interspecific copies. With time, other salivary proteins may
have taken a similar role of preventing platelet function,
allowing the D7 proteins to acquire different functions
such as binding other amines or to become anti-bradykinins, a function apparently only acquired in the anophelines, which diverged from the culicines ~150 million
years ago [22]. For a review on the evolution of gene families, see references [24,25].
Evidence for synthesis of the two large D7 proteins and for
D7s2 was shown before from Edman degradation results
of SDS-PAGE gels [3]. Presently, we observed extensive
coverage of tryptic fragments for both long D7 proteins
(D7l1 and D7l2) as shown by two-dimensional (2D) gel
electrophoresis (Figure 4 and Additional File 2) [14]. This
protein family appears polymorphic. The predicted translation products of some of these alleles are shown in Additional File 2. As expected from this protein family, all
transcripts described in Additional File 2 are more
expressed in the SG cDNA libraries than in the remaining
libraries, three of which are significant by the χ2 test at the
0.05 level. RT-PCR experiments agree with these results,
indicating a selective or preferential expression of this
gene family in female SG (Figure 5 and Table 2). It should
be noted, however, that transcripts encoding the short D7
were exclusively found in female glands, whereas mRNA
encoding the long D7 were also detectable at a lower level
in adult males (D7l1, D7l2) and in other female tissues
(D7l2). This observation may be connected to an inde-

Other small molecule binding proteins
An OBP and a lipocalin with a juvenile hormone binding
motif were found in the sialotranscriptome of Æ. ægypti,
both containing distinct peptide signal indicative of secretion. The D7 proteins belong to the OBP superfamily.
Lipocalins are abundantly expressed in tick and triatomine sialomes, where they act as nucleotide (nt)-and biogenic amine-binding proteins in addition to other
functions. Their function in Ædes is unknown. No enrichment was found for these transcripts on the SG libraries
when compared with other libraries.
Secreted protease inhibitors
Serpins
Two serpins have been described before in Æ. ægypti, one
of which has been characterized as an inhibitor of FactorXa of the clotting cascade [28,29]. We present one
allele of the FXa-directed anticoagulant precursor having
only 89% identity to the reported protein[30] which originated from the Rockefeller strain of Æ. ægypti, and two
alleles of a novel salivary serpin mapping to
supercontig1.65. The three genes coding for these serpins
are not located near each other in the Æ. ægypti genome.
All three salivary Æ. ægypti serpins have corresponding
homologues found in Ae. albopictus sialotranscriptome[31]. The novel serpin has abundant tryptic fragment
matches recovered by proteomics (band marked Serp2,
Figure 4), indicating its expression in the SG, as did
gi|18568304 (marked Serp1, Figure 4). Transcripts for all
serpins are significantly overrepresented in the SG library
when compared with the remaining libraries, in accordance to the RT-PCR experiments shown in Table 2, which
indicates that two of the three serpins are female specific
and that one may be found also in males but not in carcasses of females not containing SG (Figure 5).
Other protease inhibitors
A Kazal domain-containing peptide, similar to one
described in Ae. albopictus and to several other proteins
described as thrombin inhibitors, was found in the Æ.
ægypti sialotranscriptome. A cystatin was also found, but

this protein is reported as truncated; we were not successful in searching the genome for the missing exon(s). This
could be due to the large intron size observed in Ae.
aegypti. Accordingly, no indication of secretion is possible,
but it is described in this section due to the importance of
this family in inhibiting proteases associated with inflammation. Both transcripts are ubiquitously found in mosquito tissues by RT-PCR and may play a housekeeping
role.
Vasodilator
Sialokinin
The gene coding for this endothelium-dependent peptide
vasodilator [32,33] has been reported earlier and shown
to be transcribed specifically in female SG [34]. Although
two forms of the peptide have been described earlier differing in the aminoterminal (aspartate or asparagine),
only one gene is found coding for this peptide sequence,
for which 60 EST were found in the salivary cDNA library.
The Asn version may have been an artifact from the modification of the original peptide, which was stored in
acidic solution.
Enzymes
Nucleotidases
The salivary purinergic degradation machinery of Æ.
ægypti comprises the enzymes apyrase (a member of the 5'
nucleotidase family), adenosine deaminase (ADA), and
purine hydrolase [35-37], which may serve an antihemostatic and antiinflammatory function by removing nucleotide agonists of platelet aggregation and mast cell
degranulation. In addition to these previously described
enzymes, we found a second 5' nucleotidase that may
function either as an alternative apyrase or as a secreted
salivary 5' nucleotidase, as is the case with Lutzomyia longipalpis [38]. The novel 5' nucleotidase has only 38% identity to the previously characterized apyrase form of Aedes
aegypti[39] but has a higher identity (52%) to a Culex.
quinquefasciatus salivary 5' -nucleotidase/apyrase protein[40]. 5' nucleotidases are typically seen in the external
part of the cellular membrane to which they are bound by
a inositol phosphate anchor [41-43]. Secreted apyrases
and 5' nucleotidases have lost either the conserved Ser or
the surrounding lipophylic amino acids (aa) (or both) to
which the inositol phosphate moiety binds to [35,38].
The novel Ædes 5' nucleotidase, like the previously
described salivary apyrase [35], lacks the typical Ser residue surrounded by hydrophobic aa typical of membranebound enzymes, similarly to other mosquito salivary 5'
nucleotidase (Figure 6), supporting their role as secreted
5' nucleotidases. This novel apyrase may contribute to the
purinergic degradation machinery found in saliva of Æ.
ægypti. All these genes are overrepresented in SG libraries
and, except for ADA, significantly so. RT-PCR results are
somewhat contradictory with the proposed role of these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

enzymes in blood feeding: with the exception of the ADA
coding transcript that was enriched in female SG, the
other genes appeared to be SG specific, because they are
expressed in SG of females and in whole males, which
would suggest a role in sugar feeding, instead. We do not
have a good explanation for this observation; however, we
should point out that apyrase, purine nucleosidase
(PNase), and ADA showed very similar expression profiles
by RT-PCR in the related mosquito Æ. albopictus (Arcà et
al., manuscript in preparation). Evidence of synthesis of
these enzymes was found for the ADA, the original apyrase, and the PNase, which provided abundant tryptic
fragments (Figure 4, bands labeled ADA, apyrase, and
PNase).
A novel ribonuclease of the T2 family[44] was also characterized. This enzyme has not been previously characterized in sialotranscriptomes. It has a typical signal peptide
indicative of secretion and may function in the degradation of extracellular RNA [45].
Serine proteases
Nine secreted serine proteases varying in predicted mature
molecular weight between 28 and 43 kDa were found in
the Æ. ægypti sialotranscriptome, seven of which are being
reported for the first time (Additional File 2). Two of these
serine proteases (AEA-876[46]and AEA-562[47]) contain
a CUB domain[48], indicating specialized substrate recognition. Both are found in supercontig1.217 within 63 kb
of each other. Some of these enzymes (such as
gi|18568334[49]) are possibly related to immunity and
are similar to other enzymes annotated as prophenoloxidase (PPO)activators, but they could have been co-opted
to function in hydrolyzing specific host proteins. A
smaller number of this type of enzymes found in An. gambiæ sialotranscriptomes was selectively expressed in the
SG of adult females, indicating they may play a role in
blood feeding, perhaps by activating antiinflammatory
pathways (such as protein C) or deactivating inflammation. One such Ædes enzyme is AE-226[50], similar to
proteins annotated as chymotrypsin, which is overexpressed in Ædes sialotranscriptomes as opposed to the
remaining transcriptomes. Three of these serine proteases
were significantly underrepresented in the nonsalivarygland libraries. Four serine proteases tested by RT-PCR
agreed with the library frequency results: the transcripts
were found in female glands and adult males but not in
female carcasses deprived of SG.
Sugar hydrolases
Previously reported amylase[51,52] and alpha-glycosidase/maltase[53,54] are abundantly overrepresented in
the salivary EST collection. These genes were shown to be
expressed in the proximal regions of the female glands,
the region associated with sugar feeding.

Page 12 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:6

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

Other hydrolases
An alkaline phosphatase[55] and a carboxylesterase[56],
both containing signal peptides indicative of secretion,
are described. Both enzymatic activities in adult female SG
have been previously described in Ædes [57], and the esterase activity shown in saliva, but their function in blood
feeding can only be speculated upon.
Immunity-related proteins
The SG of mosquitoes produce various antimicrobial
polypeptides and other immunity-related products such
as bacterial surface-recognizing proteins and lectins that
may be important in opsonization and initiation of activation of the PPO enzyme leading to pathogen melanization. The purpose of these products may be to control
microbial growth in the sugar solutions stored in the crop
or in the gut following a blood meal. Previously, lysozyme[58] was found in both male and female SG of Æ.

ægypti, and in the mosquito crop [59] and shown to be
secreted by females following either a sugar or blood meal
[60]. Indeed, Æ. ægypti salivary lysozyme is significantly
overrepresented in the SG libraries, and the RT-PCR experiment supports salivary expression in both male and
female SG (Table 2 and Figure 5). Anopheline mosquitoes
also display a similar pattern of lysozyme expression in
the proximal gland region [61]. It is possible that most
immunity-related gene products follow the same pattern
of expression shown by lysozyme. Some of the enzymes
possibly associated with PPO activation have been listed
above in the Enzyme section.
C-type lectins
Five C-type lectins are described in Additional File 2, four
of which are novel. Expression of AE-189 and
gi|18568318 was confirmed by mass spectrometry following tryptic digestion of protein bands (labeled C-Lec1 and

C-Lec2 in Figure 4). These two lectins are also expressed
significantly more in sialotranscriptomes than in other Æ.
ægypti cDNA libraries, indicating that they are possibly
salivary-tissue specific. In accordance with this expectation, RT-PCR experiments indicate expression exclusively
in female SG (Table 2 and Figure 5). The two genes coding
for these salivary-specific lectins were found as an inverted
tandem repeat in supercontig1.10, each with a single
intron separating the signal peptide gene region from the
remaining coding sequence. Two other C-type lectins
tested by RT-PCR were ubiquitously expressed.
The C-type lectin family is expressed in most mosquito
sialotranscriptomes described thus far. This protein family
is implicated in immune recognition phenomena in general and in Plasmodium development in Anopheles in
particular [62,63]. Despite these not-yet-demonstrated
roles of C-type lectins in salivary immunity, it is interesting that in snake venoms this protein family has been
recruited to perform various unrelated functions such as
anticlotting, toxin, and platelet aggregation inducer
[64,65]. Lectins may also play a role in the colectin pathway of complement activation [66]. Hemagglutinins were
described in anopheline SG more than 60 years ago [67].
This activity may help concentration of red blood cells in
the mosquito gut [68]. The molecular nature of any
anopheline hemagglutinin, however, is unknown. Differently from anophelines, and despite having salivary
lectins, Ædes SG homogenates lack hemagglutinins, indicating that the salivary lectins do not recognize vertebrate
red blood cells or that they are monomeric in their carbohydrate binding site. Overall, it appears that the two
female SG-specific lectins may have a role in hemostasis
rather than immunity.
Other proteins with sugar-binding domains
AET-12005 and AET-670 are similar to, but shorter than,
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and glucuronyltransferase, respectively, appearing to derive from novel genes
that arose from gene duplications and partial deletions of
ancestral genes coding for carbohydrate binding enzymes,
the final products lacking the original carboxyterminal
domain. AET-12005 has a partial Pfam Glycos_transf_2
motif that comprises a diverse family transferring sugar
from UDP-glucose, UDP-N-acetyl-galactosamine, GDPmannose, or CDP-abequose to a range of substrates
including cellulose, dolichol phosphate, and teichoic
acids. AET-670 has a weak match to the PFAM UDPGT
motif and is similar to proteins in the nonredundant (NR)
database annotated as UDP-glucosyl transferase. It is possible that these proteins have a destination in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi and do not have a secretory
nature. Their function is unknown.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

The proteins annotated as imaginal disk growth factor
protein 4[69] and AEA-871BRE were expressed in the
sialotranscriptome of Æ. ægypti. These proteins have a chitinase domain and are homologous to An. gambiæ bacteria responsive protein 1[70] and bacteria responsive
protein 2[71], which were shown to be immune-responsive chitinase-like proteins that have lost chitin-binding
activity [72].
Angiopoietins/ficolins
This group of proteins has the PFAM fibrinogen C
motif[73]seen in invertebrate proteins displaying lectin
activity toward N-acetylglucosamine residues and implicated in immune function [74]. In An. gambiæ, the ficolin
family was expanded in comparison to Drosophila melanogaster, where 53 members were seen in its genome as
opposed to 20 in the fruit fly [75]. Three proteins belonging to this family are shown in Additional File 2, two of
which are novel. Evidence for salivary expression of
gi|18568298 and AE-154 was found by mass spectrometry in tryptic digests of protein bands (labeled Ang1 and
Ang2, respectively, in Figure 4). Of interest, the two genes
for these proteins occur as a tandem repeat in
supercontig1.15. EST for these two genes are also overrepresented in the sialotranscriptomes and are indicated to
be female-salivary-gland specific by RT-PCR experiments,
thus suggesting a blood-feeding rather than an immune
role for these proteins.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMP)
The gene products for the AMP gambicin[76], lysozyme[58], and defensin A1[77] have been previously
described in Æ. ægypti sialotranscriptomes and are listed
in Additional File 2. Transcripts encoding gambicin and
defensin A1 were detected by RT-PCR in all tissues examined, indicating ubiquitous expression (Table 2 and Figure 5); however, a significant overrepresentation of the
corresponding EST in sialotranscriptomes should be
pointed out. We additionally describe three novel peptides that may have an antimicrobial function. AET590[78] has GY repeats that are also found in peptides of
similar size known to have antimicrobial activity in nematodes [79]. AET-462[80] and AET-11358[81] are candidate AMP containing a HHH motif seen in other
histidine-rich AMP [82,83]. AET-11358 appears to be SG
specific, as a total of 88 EST was found in the combined
SG transcriptome, although none were seen in other tissue
transcriptomes. RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the
transcript in female glands and male bodies but not in
female carcasses without SG (Table 2 and Figure 5).
Other immune-related gene products
A peptide (named AEA-233[84]) closely related to a previously described Æ. ægypti peptide named i23R[85] potentially involved in Plasmodium susceptibility [86] was

Page 14 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:6

found in the sialotranscriptome. We also present an allele
to AEA-233a, indicating the polymorphism of this gene.
The Æ. albopictus sialotranscriptome revealed a homologue that is 63% identical, but no significant matches
were found to any other animal or plant proteins in the
NR database. This peptide may belong to a not-yet-characterized antimicrobial gene family specific to the Ædes
genus. Expression of AEA-233a was ubiquitous by RTPCR.
Two other gene products are described, both associated
with pathogen surface-pattern recognition: the previously
described Gram negative binding protein[87], which is
significantly overrepresented in sialotranscriptomes and
appears expressed both in female SG and in adult males
(Table 2, Figure 5), and the novel AE-7210[88], which is
similar to peptidoglycan recognition proteins and was
ubiquitously expressed by RT-PCR experiments.
Mucins
Mucins and peritrophins are proteins associated with lining of epithelia or inert extracellular structures, such as
chitin. Mucins are highly glycosylated proteins containing
Ser or Thr modified with N-acetylgalactosamine residues.
Their expression in the SG may have a function of lining
the chitin surfaces of the mouthparts, but they may also
assist in antimicrobial functions.

We present 12 mucins in Additional File 2, 11 of which
are novel, including one allele. These proteins have an
average Ser+Thr equal to 13.8% of their total aa, as
opposed to 0.9% observed as the average of all proteins
found in Additional File 2. We additionally report on a
polypeptide (AE-466, mucin-like peritrophin) containing
three glycosylation sites and one chitin-binding domain,
which may be involved in proximal lining of the cuticular
duct. All other proteins have 11–69 glycosylation sites.
Putative secreted proteins without functional classification
Belonging to ubiquitous protein families
Antigen5 (AG5) family
AG5-related salivary products are members of a group of
secreted proteins that belong to the CAP family (cysteinerich secretory proteins; AG5 proteins of insects; pathogenesis-related protein 1 of plants) [89]. Members of this protein family are found in the SG of many blood-sucking
insects [3,90,91]. Most of these animal proteins have no
known function; in the few instances to the contrary, they
diverge from proteolytic activity in Conus [92], to smooth
muscle-relaxing activity [93,94] in snake venoms, to salivary neurotoxin in the venomous lizard Heloderma horridum [95]. Three members of this gene family were
previously described in the sialotranscriptome of Æ.
ægypti. EST's for all three genes are overrepresented in the
sialotranscriptome as compared with the combined tran-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

scriptomes, indicating they may be preferentially
expressed in the SG. In accordance with these results,
gi|18568284 was exclusively transcribed in female glands
as indicated by RT-PCR, suggesting an antihemostatic
function for the gene product, while the other two genes
are transcribed in female glands and male bodies but not
in female carcasses.
Differently to An. gambiæ, which has four salivary AG5
members, three of which cluster in chromosome arm 2 L
[12], the salivary AG5 proteins of Ædes do not appear to
cluster in the genome, mapping to different supercontigs.
Other secreted proteins of unknown function found in nonbloodsucking insects
Eight putative secreted proteins have similarities to proteins or protein domains found in non-bloodsucking
insects. One of these proteins (AE-796) [96] is a truncated
fragment where it is not possible to identify whether it has
a signal peptide indicative of secretion, but it has a weak
CDD domain PAN_AP_HGF[97], which is found in plasminogen/hepatocyte growth factor proteins, and various
proteins found in Bilateria, such as leech antiplatelet proteins; however, the mRNA encoding this protein was
found ubiquitously expressed by RT-PCR and may not
have a unique salivary role in blood feeding. AE-389[98]
has a TIL[99] domain (trypsin inhibitor like) and is significantly overexpressed in sialotranscriptomes. RT-PCR
indicates both male and female SG may be the target tissue of expression of this peptide (Figure 5 and Table 2).
Peptides containing a TIL domain were also found in the
An. stephensi[100] and An. gambiae adult male sialotranscriptomes[101-103]. The finding of this type of peptide
being overexpressed in male An. gambiæ SG indicated a
possible antimicrobial function rather than a function as
a host serine protease inhibitor during blood feeding.
Indeed, a tick TIL domain containing peptide named ixodidin[104] was found to have an antimicrobial function
in addition to inhibiting serine proteases [105]. The
remaining six polypeptides have similarities to Drosophila or other species, and their structure does not hint
at any particular function.
Belonging to families only found in blood-sucking diptera
56-kDa family
This protein family has been found to date only in salivary
transcriptomes of adult mosquitoes, including adult male
An. gambiæ. The SG specificity of this gene transcript in Æ.
ægypti is supported by significant overrepresentation of
EST on the sialotranscriptome and by RT-PCR (Figure 5
and Table 2). All family members have a signal peptide
indicative of secretion and a predicted molecular weight
near 56 kDa. BLAST comparisons[106] also show weak
similarity to bacterial proteins but to no other eukaryotes.
Following 4 iterations of PSI-BLAST[107], only mosquito

Page 15 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:6

and bacterial proteins are retrieved [108], suggesting that
this family of proteins may have originated as a lateral
transfer from a bacterial genome to the ancestral mosquito genome. The single exon structure of the gene[109]
– unusual in eukaryotes, particularly for a protein of this
size, but the rule in prokaryotes – supports this hypothesis. The An. gambiæ homologue also displays a single exon
gene structure [110], as reported previously [12]. The bacterial proteins retrieved by PSI-BLAST are mostly annotated as phage-associated proteins, suggesting the lateral
transfer might have occurred via a phage-associated mechanism.
41-kDa family
Two novel alleles coding for this protein family are
described in Additional File 2. The gene coding for this
protein has a 3 exon structure[111] on supercontig1.116.
The gene product shows similarities to proteins of comparable size found in Æ. albopictus and Culex pipiens and to a
shorter protein in salivary transcriptomes of Culicoides
sonorensis. A match to Æ. ægypti gi|61742035[112] probably represents a misannotated protein with a DNA frameshift error. Three iterations of PSI-BLAST[113] only
retrieved culicine and Culicoides proteins, indicating the
uniqueness of this protein family. No salivary anopheline
sequences similar to the 41-kDa family have been
reported, including all ENSEMBL-predicted An. gambiæ
proteins deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (which contains all proteome
versions released by ENSEMBL). EST coding for the two
alleles in Æ. ægypti are significantly underrepresented in
the non-SG libraries; RT-PCR suggests ubiquitous expression of one of the alleles, although only very faint bands
were detected even after 35 cycles of amplification (Figure
5). The function of any member of this protein family is
unknown.
30-kDa GE-rich family
This acidic, Gly/Glu-rich protein family is abundantly
expressed in adult female mosquito SG, where they
appear to be involved in allergic reactions to mosquito
bites [114]. In Æ. ægypti, two proteins of this family have
been previously reported, and we now report two additional splice variants and alleles. Evidence for expression
was found in bands labeled 30 ag (for gi|14423642[115]
and gi|18568322[116]) in the 2D gel experiment shown
in Figure 4. The two proteins are coded by an inverted tandem repeat in supercontig1.464 separated by only 363
base pairs. The sialotranscriptome is significantly overrepresented in EST coding for this protein family, indicating
it is salivary specific. RT-PCR confirms the female SG specificity of these transcripts. Based on the public sequences
available, it appears that in anopheline mosquitoes (An.
gambiæ, An. stephensi, An. albimanus, An. dirus), only one

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

polymorphic gene exists for this protein family per
genome.
29-kDa family
Two different transcripts[117] in Æ. ægypti are possibly
obtained from the same genomic region coding for the
basic (pI = 9.4) salivary protein AE-236 and for the alternative shorter transcript AE-236A, which was not found
on the salivary EST but rather as one contig assembled
from four EST deriving from nonsalivary libraries[118].
BLAST comparison of the deducted salivary protein with
the NR database shows similarities to other culicine and
anopheline salivary proteins, including weak similarities
to some members of the 30 kDa protein family. Four iterations of Psi-blasT[119] are able to assemble only salivary
proteins of mosquitoes, Culicoides, and Phlebotomus,
including all 30-kDa proteins discussed above, suggesting
that either this unique protein family was co-opted as salivary proteins independently by these different families of
Diptera or that they have a common blood-feeding ancestor. ClustalW alignment of the sequences shows that following the signal peptide region, a subset of the proteins
have a Ser/Thr/Gly-rich region, poor in aliphatic aa as
shown in Figure 7 by the richness in brown residues. The
carboxyterminal region is marked by the alternation of
polar and aliphatic residues. A subset of Culicoides proteins does not have this domain. The phylogenetic tree
shows a robust mosquito clade (marked I in Figure 8)
with three members of the family per Ædes species (two
30-kDa genes, one 29-kDa gene, plus alleles) and one
member (plus alleles) per Anopheline species, which have
only a single 30-kDa member. A single Cx. pipiens
sequence is also part of this clade. CladeII has two very
similar Culicoides proteins. CladeIII has very divergent
Culex and Phlebotomus sequences, and CladeIV has
solely Culicoides sequences, representing those lacking
the Ser/Thr/Gly-rich aminoterminal domain. It is tempting to speculate that these data support a common origin
of blood feeding for these three Dipteran families, where
two genes are found in Culicines, a single in Anophelines
and possibly Phlebotomus, and a rather large gene expansion in Culicoides, which has at least seven genes in the
family. Notice that CladeIII, containing mosquito and
sand fly sequences, roots with Culicoides CladeIV and
that Culicoides cladeII roots with the mosquito cladeI,
indicating that Culicoides may have shared a common
ancestor with mosquitoes that had two genes of this
unique family. Alternatively, convergent evolution may
have shaped these genes to produce similar proteins. AE236A was enriched in the SG of adult females, while AE236 was significantly underrepresented in non-SG libraries, suggesting a salivary specificity for this protein family,
as is the case with the related 30-kDa family discussed
above.

Other mosquito-or Diptera-specific peptides
Additional File 2 also includes 14 additional polypeptides, one of which is an allele, showing sequence similarities to putative proteins from other hematophagous
Diptera including, in a few cases, some weak similarities
to Drosophila; 13 of these are novel. Among this class of
polypeptides, nine were analyzed by RT-PCR (Figure 5
and Table 2), and seven are significantly underrepresented
in the non-sialotranscriptomes, as follows: AE-212[120],
which is similar to Drosophila and Culicoides proteins of
unknown function and was ubiquitously expressed by RTPCR experiments; two alleles (AE-165[121] and AE163[122]) coding for basic (pI = 9.8) 29-kDa proteins
containing 4 putative galactosylated Ser/Thr and similar
to Culex and Culicoides[123] salivary proteins; three
polypeptides whose expression appeared gland specific,
as suggested by RT-PCR (AE-196, which is similar to the
An. gambiae gSG8[124] salivary protein; gi|61742023,
which is similar to tryptophan-rich salivary proteins of
Culex[125]; and AE-209, similar to another Culex salivary
protein[126]). AE-225 (ubiquitously expressed by RTPCR experiments), is weakly similar to proteins varying in
size from 150–180aa residues from Anopheles[127] and
Drosophila[128]. Two additional transcripts, AE-937 and
AE-752, were expressed solely in the adult female SG by
RT-PCR. The function of these proteins remains to be
investigated.
Genes belonging to protein families found to date only in Ædes genus
Nineteen genes were found expressed in the sialotranscriptome of Æ. ægypti coding for polypeptide families
known only in the Ædes genus, as follows:
62-kDa family
Two single exon[129] genes separated by ~20 kb in
supercontig1.15 code for proteins with signal peptides
and mature mass of 62–63 kDa. Transcripts for these
genes are significantly overrepresented in the sialotranscriptome and are shown to be adult female SG specific by
RT-PCR (Figure 5 and Table 2). They are similar to homologous salivary protein sequences seen in Ae. albopictus[130] and, to a much smaller degree, to rhoptry
proteins of Plasmodium. Repeated Leu and Glu residues
provide similarities to myosin[131], indicating this protein family may be involved in adhesion phenomena.
Their uniqueness among metazoan and single-exon structure indicates possible horizontal acquisition of this gene
family in Ædes. Both genes are abundantly expressed in
the SG as evidenced by bands labeled 62 k by 2D gel electrophoresis MS/MS (Figure 4).
34-kDa gene family
Seven transcripts coding for related proteins were found
mapping to supercontig1.92. After locating the corresponding genomic regions, these 7 transcripts were anno-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

tated as truncated forms or alleles of three genes found as
a tandem repeat (Figure 9). We additionally found one
possible related gene in the most distal region of the 34kDa cassette (Putative_34 kDa in Figure 9). Except for the
first gene on the cassette, which codes for a 16-kDa protein and has two exons[132], the remaining genes are single exonic[133] and code for proteins of ~34 kDa. The two
central genes, each with a single exon, are abundantly
expressed as evidenced by MS/MS sequencing of tryptic
digested bands (34k1 and 34k2 in Figure 4). All transcripts matching this gene region are significantly overexpressed in the SG transcriptome when compared with the
remaining libraries. RT-PCR indicates they are enriched or
exclusive of adult female SG (Figure 5). Protein products
of these genes match significantly only Ae. albopictus proteins[134]. PSI-BLAST for each transcript against the NR
protein database reveals cytoskeletal proteins such as actin
and myosin, mainly due to the presence of repeated
charged aa. This indicates that this protein family may be
associated with adhesion phenomena (not shown). The
single-exon nature of most members of this gene family
and their uniqueness among Metazoa points to a horizontal acquisition of this gene.
30.5-kDa family
Two genes coding for proteins of ~30.5-kDa (not to be
confused with the 30 kDa/GE-rich protein family) are
found as a tandem repeat on supercontig1.280. The gene
coding for gi|61742033 is abundantly expressed as evidenced by MS/MS of tryptic digested band labeled 30.5 in
Figure 4. These proteins are similar only to homologues[135] found in Ae. albopictus[136]. Both genes are
significantly overtranscribed in the sialotranscriptome
when compared with other transcriptomes. RT-PCR indicates enrichment in the female SG or exclusive expression
in the same organ.
9-kDa family
Two genes[137] having 80% sequence similarity and coding for mature peptides of 8.5 and 9.5 kDa are found as a
tandem repeat in supercontig1.18. They are similar only
to salivary peptides of Ae. albopictus[138]. Both genes are
significantly overexpressed in sialotranscriptomes. RTPCR suggests that these genes occur in both male and
female SG.
Other salivary polypeptides
Additional File 2 lists an additional 11 full-length transcripts originating from 10 genes coding for proteins
found to date only in the genus Ædes. Six of these genes
have overrepresentation in the sialotranscriptome, as follows: AE-376[139], AE-156[140], gi|18568314[141],
gi|18568282[142], AE-211[143], and AE-214[144]. RTPCR in 10 of the 11 transcripts show enrichment or
female specificity for 5 transcripts and ubiquitous expres-

sion for 2 genes, while 3 appear to be transcribed in both
male and female SG (Figure 5, Table 2, and Additional
File 2). Their function is unknown.
Proteins of possible housekeeping function
Function possibly predicted
Transporter function and storage proteins
Being a secretory organ, mosquito SG are involved in
active ion and water transport associated with their function. V-ATPases are generic 'batteries' that generate a proton gradient across membranes that can be coupled with
ion exchangers and are used in eukaryotic cells for transport purposes [145]. This multi-subunit enzyme complex
has been extensively studied in insects, in particular in
Lepidotera larvæ midgut [146] and in the malpighian
fluid transport in mosquitoes [147]. A role for V-ATPases
in mosquito SG secretion has been previously proposed
[148]. Additional File 2 reports 22 gene products including 9 subunits of the V-ATPase complex, 3 aquaporins
(water channels), 2 chloride channels, and the enzyme
carbonic anhydrase, which is associated with proton

transport in epithelia to speed intracellular pH regulation
via the CO2+H2O↔bicarbonate + H+ reaction.
Probable signal transduction function
Thirty-eight proteins, 35 of which are novel, are described
in Additional File 2 as possibly associated with signal
transduction events. Included are four proteins associated
with inhibition of apoptosis, four enzymes associated
with juvenile hormone metabolism, one associated with
ecdyesteroid metabolism, and a gamma-amino butyric
(GABA) receptor-associated protein, in addition to protein kinases and phosphatases.
Nuclear regulation, transcription factors, and transcription machinery
Twelve (all novel) proteins are associated with nuclear
function including histones, zinc finger proteins, and proteins associated with cell division. Additionally, we found
9 possible transcription factors and 21 proteins involved
in the transcription machinery, only one of which has
been previously reported (Additional File 2).

Ribosomal proteins and other proteins associated with the translation
machinery
Being an organ involved in abundant protein synthesis, it
is not surprising that many ribosomal and other translation associated proteins were identified. 1 lists 75 ribosomal proteins, 65 of which are novel for Æ. ægypti. Twelve
of these ribosomal proteins, although also found in other
transcriptomes, are significantly overexpressed in the
sialotranscriptome. These are AE-155, AE-198A, AE-430,
AE-411, AE-288, AE-200A, AET-3179, AET-2065,
gi|78214568, gi|11762110, AET-3168, and AET-3303.

Eighteen proteins (14 novel) were possibly associated
with the translation machinery, including elongation factors, tRNA synthases, and translation initiation factors.
Elongation factors 2, 2 alpha, and 2 beta were significantly
overexpressed in the SG.
Protein modification and protein export machinery
Forty-four proteins (43 novel) were possibly associated
with the protein modification machinery including
enzymes associated with proline isomerization, disulfide
bridge formation, glycosylation, and several chaperones.
Thirty-six proteins (35 novel) are possibly associated with
the protein export machinery, including signal peptidase
complex, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and vacuole proteins. The putative cargo transport protein EMP24 is overexpressed in the sialotranscriptome, although also found
in other nonsalivary libraries. Evidence for expression of a
protein disulphide isomerase was found by MS/MS results
of the tryptic digestion of band labeled PDI in Figure 4.
Oxidant metabolism
One peroxiredoxin, one thioredoxin, two superoxide dismutases, one cytochrome P-450 enzyme, and one truncated catalase are among ten proteins associated with
oxidant metabolism (eight of which are novel). The cytochrome P-450 enzyme has a signal peptide indicative of
secretion and is a member of the CYP4 family (based on
the nomenclature of related proteins[149]), but it is
included as a possible housekeeping function due to its
high similarity to other insect enzymes[149] and because

these enzymes normally need an associated reductase
driven by NADPH+, which is normally only found intracellularly. Members of the CYP4 family can be found in
peroxisomes, where they can be associated to arachidonic
acid or eicosanoid reactions [150]. Of interest, AET-6749
is similar to a 40-kDa farnesylated protein associated with
peroxisomes[151], indicating the presence of this
organelle in Ædes SG and the possible reason for the signal peptide that may be needed for directing this enzyme
to the peroxisome.
Proteasome and lysosomal machinery
Seventeen proteins (16 novel) were associated with the
proteasome machinery, including several proteasome
subunits and ubiquitin-related enzymes. Two previously
described lysosomal enzymes are also listed in Additional
File 2.
Cell metabolism
Forty-three proteins associated with nt, aa, carbohydrate,
lipid, and heme metabolism or transport are described.
AET-12468 is similar to enzymes annotated as kynurenine
formamidase [152] and has a KOG motif indicative of this
enzyme [153]; 9 transcripts were found among the 15,625
salivary EST but only 6 in the 217,296 nonsalivary EST,
indicating this enzyme is overexpressed in the SG of Ædes.
Kynurenine formamidase is a key enzyme in the degradation of tryptophan, producing L-kynurenine from Nformyl-kynurenine, the product of the action of L-tryptophan:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase on tryptophan, and a
precursor to xanthurenic acid, which has been described
in the SG of An. stephensi [154]. Xanthurenic acid has also
been reported as the mosquito-derived gametocyte exflagellation factor of Plasmodium [155,156]. The presence of
xanthurenic acid in Ædes saliva remains to be demonstrated, although a recent report indicates that Ædes mosquitoes deficient in the production of xanthurenic acid
sustain normal P. gallinaceum development [157].
Energy metabolism
Fifty-four enzymes (51 novel) are presented as involved in
energy metabolism. Most of these are mitochondrial conPage 20 of 27
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:6

stituents, a few of which are overrepresented in the salivary libraries compared with the other libraries, perhaps
due to the larger-than average-salivary metabolism associated with protein synthesis and secretion. Evidence for
expression of the alpha and beta subunits of the F0F1-type
ATP synthase were found by MS/MS data obtained from
bands labeled F0F1α and F0F1β on the 2D gel (Figure 4)
indicating their abundant expression.
Cytoskeletal, adhesion, and extracellular matrix proteins
Fifteen proteins (14 are novel to Ædes) are associated with
cytoskeletal, intercellular adhesion, or extracellular matrix
functions, including actins, dynactin, tubulins and annexins, and the basal lamina protein named as SGS1, which
was found to be a SG receptor for P. gallinaceum sporozoites [158]. Notably, this protein family has homologues
only in An. gambiæ, where it was abundantly expressed in
the SG of adult females [12] and in bacteria, the most
closely related protein outside Anopheles being from the
Wolbachia [12,158]. Four such large proteins (~200 kDa)
were described in Anopheles, all intronless and contained
in a tandem repeat on chromosome arm 3R, while six
have been identified in Ædes, also intronless[159], and
consistent with their horizontal acquisition from a Wolbachia bacteria. For more details on this protein family,
see reference [158].
Probably housekeeping, function unknown
Fifty-nine proteins are described (all novel to Ædes) that
are conserved with other organisms, thus characterizing
the large group of 'conserved hypothetical' proteins [160]
or are just hypothetical proteins with no similarities to
other known proteins (five cases only). Two of the conserved hypothetical proteins are clearly membrane proteins of unknown function. Several members of this group
are significantly overexpressed in the SG when EST's in the
sialotranscriptome are compared with the remaining transcripts.

Conclusion
Using high-throughput transcriptome analysis, we significantly expanded the Æ. ægypti SG transcript repertoire. A
total of 614 transcripts was identified, 573 of which are
new, and mostly full length. A subset of 136 transcripts
was identified as possibly SG specific, 97 of which are
novel. Analysis of tissue-specific transcription of selected
genes revealed at least 31 genes whose expression is specific or enriched in female SG, whereas 24 additional
genes were expressed in female SG and in males but not in
other female tissues. Most of the 55 proteins coded by
these transcripts have no known function and represent
high-priority candidates for expression and functional
analysis as antihemostatic or antimicrobial agents. This
catalogue makes Æ. ægypti the mosquito vector for which
the most complete salivary transcriptome is available. We

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

hope that this updated catalogue will help our continuing
effort of understanding the evolution of blood sucking in
vector arthropods and the discovery of novel pharmacologically active compounds.
An unexpected finding of this work was the occurrence of
four protein families specific to SG that were probably a
product of horizontal transfer from prokaryotic organisms to mosquitoes. Previously, the SGS family was
shown to localize specifically in the basal surface of SG
cells and may function as a Plasmodium receptor [158].
Here we identify three new families of salivary and possibly secreted proteins (62, 56, and 34 kD) characterized by
having uniexonic genes and PSI-BLAST retrieval of only
salivary proteins of hematophagous Diptera and bacterial
proteins. Although horizontal gene transfer is common in
prokaryotic organisms, it is a relatively rare finding in
eukaryotes [161]. To the extent that these genes are really
of bacterial origin, it may emphasize the unusual paths of
SG gene evolution in the quest of hematophagous animals to obtain their 'perfect' potion that allows disarming
of the complex host pathways of inflammation and
hemostasis that would otherwise disrupt blood feeding.

Methods
Mosquitoes
Two laboratory colonies were used in this work, one at Dr.
Ribeiro's laboratory at the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), and the other in Dr. Wikel's laboratory at the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC). Both mosquito colonies were the Liverpool/blackeye strain of Æ.
ægypti. Insectary rooms were kept at 26°C ± 0.5°C (NIH)
or 27°C ± 0.5°C (UCHC), with a relative humidity of
70% to 75% and a 16 h:8 h light:dark photoperiod. Adult
female mosquitoes used in the experiments were 0–7 days
old, took no blood meals, and were maintained on a diet
of 10% Karo syrup solution (NIH) or raisins (UCHC).
SG isolation
At the NIH, SG from adult female mosquitoes were dissected and transferred to 20μl Hepes saline (HS; NaCl
0.15 M, 10 mM Hepes, pH7.0) in 1.5 ml polypropylene
vials in groups of 20 pairs of glands in 20 μl of HS or as
individual glands in 10μl of HS. SG were kept at -75°C
until needed. At UCHC, adult female mosquitoes were
primed for blood feeding before dissecting out their SG by
placing a human hand close to the mosquito cage for 3–5
min (without letting the mosquitoes probe). SG were dissected and placed into a solution of 75% RNA-Later
(Ambion) 25% 1 × PBS (RNAse free) and stored in 100%
RNA-Later at -20°C for isolating polyA+ RNA.

Æ. ægypti SG mRNA was isolated from 80SG pairs (NIH)
or 110 pairs (UCHC) from adult females at days 1 and
2(NIH) or 1–4 (UCHC) after emergence using the Micro-

FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) (NIH) or the
Oligotex™ direct mRNA isolation kit (Qiagen) (UCHC).
The PCR-based cDNA library was made following the
instructions for the SMART (switching mechanism at 5'
end of RNA transcript) cDNA library construction kit
(Clontech). This kit provided a method for producing
high-quality, full-length cDNA libraries from nanogram
quantities of polyA+ or total RNA. It utilizes a specially
designed oligonucleotide named SMARTIV™ in the firststrand synthesis to generate high yields of full-length,
double-stranded cDNA. Æ. ægypti SG polyA+ RNA (300
ng) was used for reverse transcription to cDNA using PowerScript reverse transcriptase (Clontech), the SMARTIV
oligonucleotide, and the CDS III/3' primer (Clontech).
The reaction was carried out at 42°C for 1 h. Secondstrand synthesis was performed by a long-distance PCRbased protocol using the 5' PCR primer and the CDS III/
3' primer as sense and antisense primers, respectively.
These two primers also create Sfi1A and Brestriction
enzyme sites at the end of nascent cDNA. Advantage™ Taq
polymerase mix (Clontech) was used to carry out the
long-distance PCR reaction on a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp®
PCR system9700 (Perkin Elmer Corp.). The PCR conditions were: 95°C for 20s; 24 cycles of 95°C for 5s, 68°C
for 6 min. A small portion of the cDNA was analyzed on
a 1.1% agarose/EtBr (0.1 μg/ml) gel to check for the quality and range of the cDNA synthesized. Double-stranded
cDNA was immediately treated with proteinaseK (0.8 μg/
ml) at 45°C for 20 min, extracted with phenol:chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol mixture, and precipitated using
sodium acetate (200 mM), glycogen (0.12 μg/ml), and
95% ethanol. The clean double-stranded cDNA was then
digested with SfiI restriction enzyme at 50°C for 2 h followed by size fractionation on a ChromaSpin-400 drip
column (Clontech). The profiles of the fractions were
checked on a 1.1% agarose/EtBr (0.1 μg/ml), and fractions containing cDNA of more than 400 bp were pooled
and concentrated by precipitation. The cDNA were then
ligated into a λ TriplEx2 vector (Clontech), and the resulting ligation mixture was packaged using GigaPack® IIIPlus
packaging extract (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The packaged library was plated by
infecting log-phase XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells (Clontech). The percentage of recombinant clones was determined by performing a blue-white selection screening on
LB/MgSO4 plates containing X-gal/IPTG. Recombinants
were also determined by PCR, using vector primers (5' λ
TriplEx2 and 3' λ TriplEx2 sequencing primers) flanking
the inserted cDNA and visualizing the products on a 1.1%
agarose/EtBr gel.
Sequencing of the Æ. ægypti cDNA Library
The Æ. ægypti SG cDNA library was plated on LB/MgSO4
plates containing X-gal/IPTG, to an average of 250
plaques per 150 mm Petri plate. Recombinant (white)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

plaques were randomly picked up and transferred to 96well MICROTEST™ U-bottom plates (BD BioSciences)
containing 100 μls of SM buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.01 M
MgSO4, 0.035 M Tris-HCl [pH7.5], 0.01% gelatin) per
well. The plates were covered and placed on a gyrating
shaker for 30 min at room temperature. The phage suspension was either immediately used for PCR or stored at
4°C for future use.
To amplify the cDNA using a PCR reaction, 4 μl of the
phage sample was used as a template. The primers were
sequences from the λ TriplEx2 vector and named pTEx2 5
seq (5' -TCCGAGATCTGGACGAGC-3' ) and pTEx2 3LD
(5' -atacgactcactatagggcgaa ttggc-3' ), positioned at the 5'
end and the 3' end of the cDNA insert, respectively. The
reaction was carried out in 96-well flexible PCR plates
(Fisher Scientific) using TaKaRa EX Taq polymerase
(TAKARA; Mirus Bio), on a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp® PCR
system9700 (Perkin Elmer Corp.). The PCR conditions
were: 1 hold of 95°C for 3 min, 25 cycles of 95°C for 1
min, 61°C for 30s, 72°C for 2 min. The amplified products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose/EtBr gel. cDNA
library clones (1100 clones) were PCR amplified, and
those showing a single band were selected for sequencing.
Approximately 200–250 ng of each PCR product was
transferred to Thermo-Fast 96-well PCR paltes (ABgene
Corp.) and frozen at -20°C. Sequencing of the Wikel's laboratory library was performed by Agencourt Bioscience
Corp., and a total of 1,017 cDNA library clones was
sequenced. The library constructed in Ribeiro's lab was
sequenced locally using an 8 capillary CEQ 2000 DNA
sequencing instrument (Beckman Coulter, Inc) to provide
2,759 sequences.
2D-Gel electrophoresis
2D gel electrophoresis was performed using ZOOM IPGRunner System (Invitrogen) under manufacturer's recommended running conditions. Briefly, approximately 50 μg
of sample proteins (approximately 15 pairs of SG) were
solubilized with 155 μl rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M
thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 20 mM DTT, 0.5% carrier
ampholytes, pH3-10). The samples were absorbed by
rehydration ZOOM strips (7 cm; pH3-10NL) overnight at
room temperature and then focused under manufacturer's
recommended conditions. The focused IPG strips were
reduced/alkylated/equilibrated with reducing and then
alkylation reagents dissolved in the sample buffer. The
strips were then applied onto NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris
ZOOM gels (Invitrogen). The gels were run under MOPS
buffer and stained with SeeBlue staining solution (BioRad). A total of 75 spots were selected for tryptic digestion, based on their staining intensity. The gel picture and
23 protein bands matched to Æ. ægypti proteins are
shown in Figure 4.

Protein identification by mass spectrometry
Protein identification of 2Dgel-separated proteins was
performed on reduced and alkylated trypsin-digested
samples prepared by standard mass spectrometry protocols. Tryptic digests were analyzed by coupling the Nanomate (Advion BioSciences) – an automated chip-based
nano-electrospray interface source – to a quadrupole
time-of-flight mass spectrometer, QStarXL MS/MS System
(Applied Biosystems/Sciex). Computer-controlled, datadependent automated switching to MS/MS provided peptide sequence information. AnalystQS software (Applied
Biosystems/Sciex) was used for data acquisition. Data
processing and databank searching were performed with
Mascot software (Matrix Science). The NR protein database from the NCBI, National Library of Medicine, NIH,
was used for the search analysis, as was a protein database
generated during the course of this work.
Bioinformatic tools and procedures
EST were trimmed of primer and vector sequences, clusterized, and compared with other databases as described
before [102]. The BLAST tool [162], CAP3 assembler
[163], ClustalW [164], and Treeview software [165] were
used to compare, assemble, and align sequences and to
visualize alignments. Phylogenetic analysis and statistical
neighbor-joining bootstrap tests of the phylogenies were
also done with the Mega3 package [166]. For functional
annotation of the transcripts we used the tool blastx [107]
to compare the nt sequences with the NCBI NR protein
database of the NCBI and to the Gene Ontology (GO)
database [167]. The tool rpsblast [107] was used to search
for conserved protein domains in the Pfam [168], Smart
[169], Kog [170], and conserved domains (CDD) databases [171]. We have also compared the transcripts with
other subsets of mitochondrial and rRNA nt sequences
downloaded from NCBI and to several organism proteomes downloaded from NCBI (yeast), Flybase (D. melanogaster), or ENSEMBL (An. gambiæ). Segments of the
three-frame translations of the EST (as the libraries were
unidirectional, we did not use six-frame translations)
starting with a methionine in the first 100 predicted aa –
or the predicted protein translation, in the case of complete coding sequences – were submitted to the SignalP
server [172] to help identify translation products that
could be secreted. O-glycosylation sites on the proteins
were predicted with the program NetOGlyc [173]. Functional annotation of the transcripts was based on all the
comparisons above. Following inspection of all results,
transcripts were classified as either (S)ecretory, (H)ousekeeping, or of (U)nknown function, with further subdivisions based on function and/or protein families. To map
the EST and contigs in the genome, blastn was used [107].
To speed the program, each genomic fasta file was broken
into 30-kb fragments with 5 kb from previous sequence.
For visualization of EST on the Æ. ægypti genome, we used

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/6

the Artemis tool [174] after transforming the blastn output to a file compatible to Artemis using a program written in Visual Basic.
To compare the EST frequency in Æ. ægypti salivary cDNA
libraries with EST frequency in other libraries whose
mRNA derive from other sources (downloaded from the
NCBI EST database DBEST), all available EST from Æ.
ægypti plus the EST set from a EST hemocyte library from
DrBruce Christensen's laboratory [175] plus our own salivary EST set were pooled to obtain a total of 232,921 EST;
these were assembled as described above to create a
searchable annotated database of 28,458 contigs and singletons, which is available for browsing at Anobase [10].
The combined EST database thus derives from 29 different
EST libraries, 2 of which are from SG of adult female mosquitoes (4,040 from Ribeiro/Wikel laboratories, and
11,585 from Dr. Sergio Verjovski's laboratory); the
remainder are from different organs or whole organisms
at different developmental stages, or from adult mosquitoes infected or not with different pathogens. Details of
these libraries are available at the EST dataset website [10].
From each of these 28,458 contigs, we determined the EST
contribution from each of the 29 libraries to the final
assembled contigs, thus obtaining for each contig the total
salivary and nonsalivary contribution. A χ2test was
applied to the data set to determine whether a salivary
contribution was above or below the null hypothesis of
no differential library contribution when the expected EST
frequency was above 5, as indicated for the correct use of
the test. When the Pvalue was below 0.05, we considered
the deviation of equal EST distribution among salivary
and remaining libraries as significant.
RT-PCR expression analysis
For RT-PCR analysis, SG were dissected from adult
females 1 to 5 days after emergence and stored at -80°C.
Total RNA was extracted from female glands, carcasses
(i.e. adult females with SG removed), and adult males
using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen).

Approximately 50 ng RNAse-free DNase-treated total RNA
(Invitrogen) was used for the RT-PCR amplification by the
SuperScript one-step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Typically, reverse transcription (50°C, 30 min) and heat inactivation of the
reverse transcriptase (94°C, 2 min) were followed by 30
PCR cycles: 30s at 94°C, 30s at 55°C, 1 min. at 72°C; 25
cycles were used for the amplification of the ribosomal
protein S5 mRNA (rpS5) to keep the reaction below saturation levels and to allow reliable normalization. For
some clones (gi|94468620, gi|94468350, gi|94468634,
and gi|42632615), 35 cycles of amplification were needed
to obtain detectable bands. The oligonucleotide primers
used for rpS5 amplification were: rpS5-F, 5' -ATTA-

CATCGCCGTCAAGG AG-3' , and rpS5-R, 5' -TCATC
ATCAGCGAGTTGGTC-3'. The sequence of the other oligonucleotide primers is available as Supplemental Material. Amplification reactions were analyzed on 1.2%
agarose gels. Each sample was analyzed by RT-PCR two to
three times using independent batches of total RNA.
