Convergent and parallel evolution in life habit
of the scallops (Bivalvia: Pectinidae)
Alvin Alejandrino1, Louise Puslednik1,2 and Jeanne M Serb1*

Abstract
Background: We employed a phylogenetic framework to identify patterns of life habit evolution in the marine
bivalve family Pectinidae. Specifically, we examined the number of independent origins of each life habit and
distinguished between convergent and parallel trajectories of life habit evolution using ancestral state estimation.
We also investigated whether ancestral character states influence the frequency or type of evolutionary trajectories.
Results: We determined that temporary attachment to substrata by byssal threads is the most likely ancestral
condition for the Pectinidae, with subsequent transitions to the five remaining habit types. Nearly all transitions
between life habit classes were repeated in our phylogeny and the majority of these transitions were the result of
parallel evolution from byssate ancestors. Convergent evolution also occurred within the Pectinidae and produced
two additional gliding clades and two recessing lineages. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that byssal attaching
gave rise to significantly more of the transitions than any other life habit and that the cementing and nestling
classes are only represented as evolutionary outcomes in our phylogeny, never as progenitor states.
Conclusions: Collectively, our results illustrate that both convergence and parallelism generated repeated life habit
states in the scallops. Bias in the types of habit transitions observed may indicate constraints due to physical or
ontogenetic limitations of particular phenotypes.

Background
When two species occupy comparable trophic niches,
similar phenotypes can be generated via analogous evolutionary responses [1-4]. As a consequence, repeated
phenotypes have long been treated as evidence for adaptation at the macroevolutionary scale [5-9]. Two important patterns in iterative morphological evolution are
convergence and parallelism, which can be distinguished
by examining the phenotypic trajectories along a phylogeny [10]. Evolutionary convergence is implicated when
two or more lineages with different ancestral phenotypes
independently evolve along different trajectories towards
the same adaptive phenotype; whereas, evolutionary parallelism is revealed when independent lineages with
comparable ancestral morphologies evolve towards a
new, but similar, phenotype. Importantly, the application
of a phylogenetic approach to discern between convergence and parallelism alleviates some of the operational

difficulties of separating these two concepts, thereby
allowing a meaningful, quantitative way of assessing
repeated evolutionary patterns (for reviews of this highly
contested issue see: [11-13]).
The best known studies examining repetitive evolutionary patterns include morphological, ecological, and
behavioral traits in all major vertebrate lineages (e.g.,
fishes: [3,14]; amphibians: [15]; reptiles: [16,17]; birds:
[18,19]; mammals: [20]). To a lesser extent, similar work
has been done in invertebrate groups, specifically arthropods. For example, convergent or parallel evolution has
been identified in replicated shifts of host use in insects
[21,22], web construction in arachnids [8], larval morphology and antipredator behavior in aquatic insects
[23], and adult morphology in barnacles [24]. Outside of
arthropods, few studies using invertebrates explicitly test
for convergence and parallelism (but see gastropods:
[25,26]; bivalves: [27]). Indeed, if the patterns seen in
vertebrates are representative, it suggests that repetitive
patterns of phenotypic evolution should be far more
prevalent across the animal kingdom than is currently

recognized, as vertebrates comprise only 5 percent of all
animal diversity.
Here we use scallops as a non-arthropod invertebrate
model to study convergence and parallelism. Scallop
species comprise a large family (Pectinidae) of 264
recognized species and are found globally in a wide
range of marine habitats from the intertidal zone to
depths of 7000 meters (m) [28,29]. Scallops exhibit a
diverse set of life habits that are related to the animal’s
ecological requirements and behavioral attributes [30]
and are organized into six categories based on the methods and permanence of attachment to a substrate, locomotive ability, and spatial relationship to a substrate
(epifaunal versus semi-infaunal; see Table 1). Species are
categorized by the life habit displayed during adulthood
and membership to a life habit class typically precludes
the display of other habits. Recent work by Smith and
Jackson [31] has demonstrated the evolutionary importance of pectinid life habit by linking environmental factors to the diversification or decline of lineages.
In this paper, we employ a phylogenetic framework to
examine the evolution of species-specific life habit categories in the scallops. We have generated the most comprehensive multigene phylogeny of the Pectinidae to
date in order to determine the number of independent
origins of each life habit class. We then distinguished
between convergent and parallel trajectories of life mode
evolution by applying a phylogenetically-based approach
[10] to answer the following questions: How repetitive is
the evolution of life mode in the scallops? When a life
habit has multiple origins, are these lineages the result
of convergent evolution or parallel evolution? Are particular transitions between life habit classes more likely
than others? Our results demonstrate that five of the six

life habit types exhibited by scallops have evolved multiple times. We identified 17 repeated transitions between
life habit classes within the Pectinidae that were the
result of both parallel and convergent evolution. Interestingly, despite repeated evolutionary transitions, we
found that not all life habit classes function as progenitor states in the scallops.

Methods
Phylogenetic analysis

We examined 81 species, representing 31% of extant
taxa from the Pectinidae. Taxonomic classification follows that of Dijkstra [28] and Waller [29]. Eleven species from three closely allied families, Propeamussiidae,
Limidae, and Spondylidae, were included as outgroup
taxa based on the results from [32]. All specimens were
preserved in 95% ethanol and were provided by either
museum collections or colleagues. When possible, DNA
was extracted from two or more individuals per species
as a test for congruent placement in the phylogenetic
analyses.
Previously, nuclear Histone H3 and mitochondrial 12S
rRNA and 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified for
39 taxa by Puslednik and Serb [32]. Here, we build on
their three-gene dataset by adding 53 more species and
a nuclear gene region, 28S rRNA. Primer sequences for
12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and Histone H3 and PCR and
sequencing conditions are described in Puslednik and
Serb [32]. We designed new primers for the 28S rRNA
region for this study (sc28S_70F: 5’-CAGCACCGAA
TCCCTCAGCCTTG-3’, sc28S_950R: 5’-TCTGGCTT
CGTCCTACTCAAGCATAG-3’, 28S_Limoida_121F:
5’-TCAGACGAGATTACCCGCTGAATTTAAGC-3’).

significant amount of product (< 20ng/μl) or a single
product, we cloned the PCR products following manufactures instructions (TOPO Cloning Kit, Invitrogen).
Sequencing was carried out in an ABI 3730 Capillary
Electrophoresis Genetic Analyzer at the Iowa State University DNA Sequencing Facility. All sequences are
deposited in Genbank (accession numbers: HM485575HM485578, HM535651-HM535659, HM540080HM540106, HM561991-HM562003, HM600733HM600765, HM622672-HM622722, HM630371HM630556; see also Additional file 1, Table S1).
Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W [33] with a
gap-opening penalty of 10.00 and a gap-extending penalty of 0.20 in Geneious Pro [34]. Due to ambiguous
alignment, a 169 base pair (bp) hypervariable region in
the 16S rRNA gene fragment was excluded from phylogenetic analyses.
Aligned sequences (2438 bp) were partitioned according to locus and codon position for the protein-coding
gene Histone H3. For each partition, an appropriate
nucleotide substitution model was selected on the basis
of the hierchical Likelihood Ratio Test (hLRT) and the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) using ModelTest 3.7
[35]. Both tests agreed on the GTR+G model for the 12S
rRNA partition and the GTR+G + I model for 16S rRNA,
28S rRNA, and Histone H3 partitions. All partitions were
analyzed simultaneously as a mixed model Bayesian analysis in MrBayes 3.1.2 [36]. We used the Metropolis
Coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with one
cold and three hot chains for 5 million generations, sampling every 100th generation for three simulations. The
number of generations required to attain stationarity was
estimated when the standard deviation of split frequencies fell below 0.01. All trees prior to stationarity were
discarded as burn-in and the remaining trees were used
to compute a majority-rule consensus topology, branch
lengths, and posterior probabilities (PP). Maximum Likelihood (ML) was executed in PhyML 3.0 [37] using the
GTR+G + I model. The ML analyses consisted of 1000
replicates and clade support was assessed with 100 bootstrap (BP) pseudoreplicates.
Life habit classes

Scallops exhibit a diversity of species-specific life habits
that range from permanent attachment to or within a
substrate to mobile species able to swim continuously
over long distances in a single effort. We divided behaviors exhibited by sexually mature individuals into six
categories. Byssal-attachers retain the ability to produce
a temporary protein fastening, the byssus, into adulthood. Nestling species also attach with a byssus, but differ in that the scallop eventually becomes permanently
confined within a cavity of living corals or sponges [38].
Other scallop species are cementers that permanently

fasten onto hard substrates through the secretion of
new shell material. In contrast, free-living pectinids
rarely attach as adults and many species are unable to
secrete a byssus once the shell takes on the adult morphology. Whereas free-living species passively occupy a
position on or partially covered in soft or sandy substrates, recessers actively construct a saucer-shaped
depression in the substrate in which the animal resides
so that the upper (left) valve is level or just below the
sediment surface [39,40]. The most mobile life habit
class is gliding. Although all non-permanently attached
species have the ability to swim for short distances (< 1
m) to escape predators [39] or to move between desirable habitats [41], few species can swim greater than 5
m in a single swimming effort before the animal sinks
passively to the substrate [39]. Gliding (5 - 30 m/effort)
is distinguished from a common swimming response by
the presence of a level swimming phase, where the animal is able to maintain a near horizontal trajectory
above the substrate [42-44]. The level swimming phase
also contains a glide component, where the animal is
propelled forward while the valves are held closed
[44-46]. Neither a level swimming phase nor a glide
component is present in short distance swimming
[44,47,48], making gliding a unique life habit state
among scallop species.
Analysis of life habit evolution

Life habit data for extant species of Pectinidae and outgroup taxa were assembled via a review of the literature
and supplemented with the personal observations of collectors. Species from outgroup families Propeamussiidae
and Limidae are treated as byssal attachers: Waller [49]
speculated that the typical habit of the Propeamussidae
is to actively secrete a byssus based on the presence of a
byssal notch in the adult, while species of the Limidae
have been directly observed to byssally attach or build
nests made of byssus threads [50,51]. In scallops, classifying life habit involves distinguishing between active
versus passive actions of an adult organism. So while
most species are able to attach with a byssus for a period of time as juveniles or swim short distances as an
escape response, these activities do not determine the
life habit of the adult animal. Thus, species were placed
into life habit classes based on active and prominent
responses of the adult animal to its environment. For
example, some species are primarily epifaunal, but are
passively buried in soft substrates due to the accumulation of sediment. However, since these species do not
actively bury, they are treated as free-living and not
recessing species. Life habit assignment for each species
is given in Additional file 2, Table S2. Life habits were
organized into six states and a character matrix was
constructed using standard categorical data (0, unknown

Alejandrino et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:164

behavior; 1, cementing; 2, byssal attaching; 3, free-living;
4, recessing; 5, gliding; and 6, nestling). Brief definitions
of life habits are provided in Table 1.
We then reconstructed ancestral states on the Bayesian topology using parsimony and likelihood reconstruction methods in Mesquite 2.6 [52]. Changes
between states were unordered. The one parameter
Markov k-state (Mk1) model was applied in the likelihood analysis and assumes a single rate for all character
state transitions [53]. Likelihood-ratio tests of respective
nodes determined the best estimate of the state. Differences in log-likelihood values greater than 2.0 were used
to reject the higher negative log-likelihood value, while
values less than 2.0 were treated as ambiguous character-state reconstructions.
Finally, to test the null hypothesis that transitions
between life habit states (permanent attachment, byssal
attaching, free-living, recessing, and gliding) are equally
likely to come from any of the five states, we used a
Chi-square test to compare the number of the observed
to the expected transitions. The test follows an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with four degrees of
freedom.

Results
Of the six life habits examined, byssal attaching is the
most common state and is represented by 42 species
(52%). Of the remaining species, 21 (25%) are free-living,
10 (12%) species recess, and eight (9%) species glide. In
our sample, we included one of the two extant species that
exhibit nestling (Pedum spondyloideum) and two of the
five extant species that cement to a substrate (Crassadoma
gigantea and Talochlamys pusio [= Chlamys distorta]).
These proportions of non-byssate life habit categories in
our taxonomic sample are similar to their representation
across the family (free-living = 16.3%; recessing = 12.1%;
gliding = 3%; nestling = 0.75%; cementing = 1.9%), where
66% of all species byssally attach (data not shown). Phylogenetic relationships among these species were congruent
in both BI (Figure 1) and ML (Additional file 3, Figure S1)
topologies except for the placement of three lineages: the
Scaeochlamys livida + Mimachlamys townsendi clade, the
basal clade of the non-Delectopecten scallops, and the
Nodipecten subnodosus lineage. Of these, the only the placement of N. subnodosus alters the ancestral state estimation (see below).
To investigate the number of independent origins of
life habit categories, we reconstructed ancestral states
assuming a Markov model of character evolution with a
single parameter to describe the rate of change on the
BI topology (Figure 1). For the species analyzed here,
ML estimations of ancestral states (pie charts in Figure
1) identify a minimum of 17 transitions between life
habit classes (Table 2). These transitions include two

Page 4 of 9

origins of recessing, seven origins of the free-living condition, four separate lineages of gliding, and three occurrences of permanent (non-byssal) attachment through
either cementation or enclosure within living corals.
Byssal attachment was the most likely ancestral state of
the Pectinidae and originates a second time in the phylogeny from a free-living ancestor in the Leptopecten
lineage (Figure 1). Gliding occurs in three genera: Amusium (4 species in the genus), Adamussium (a monotypic genus) and Placopecten (a monotypic genus). Our
analysis included three of the four currently recognized
species in Amusium (= “Amusium“) genus. Because
Amusium did not form a monophyletic clade in either
BI or ML topologies, these species represent three separate origins of gliding (Figure 1; Additional file 3, Figure
S1). The fourth origin of gliding includes the monotypic
genera Adamussium and Placopecten.
We then examined the number of convergent versus
parallel evolutionary events that lead to a particular life
habit using phylogenetically-based definitions of convergence and parallelism [10]. Of the 17 life habit transitions, the majority (12; 70%) originated from byssate
ancestors and were cases of parallel evolution. Nearly all
transitions are repeated at least twice in the phylogeny
(Table 2; Figure 1). Six of the seven origins of the freeliving state were parallel trajectories arising from byssal
attaching ancestors. Likewise, the cementing life habit in
Crassadoma gigantea and Talochlamys pusio lineages
arose in parallel from byssal attaching ancestors. The
gliding life habit arose in four independent lineages
along both parallel and convergent trajectories. “Amusium“ papyraceum and Amusium pleuronectes arose in
parallel from recessing ancestors, while the “A.” balloti
+ “A.” japonicum clade and Adamussium + (Pseudamussium + Placopecten) clade arose in parallel from byssal
attaching ancestors. The recessing life habits of the
Euvola + Pecten clade and the Patinopecten + Mizuhopecten clade are convergent and are derived from a
free-living ancestor and a byssal attaching ancestor,
respectively. Last, nestling of Pedum spondyloideum is a
unique life habit in our phylogeny and originated from a
byssal attaching ancestor. Ancestral state estimation is
congruent when using the ML topology (Additional file
3, Figure S1), with one exception. The placement of
Nodipecten subnodosus as the sister taxon to E. chazaliei
in the ML topology creates a unique transition from the
recessing condition to a free-living state not observed
on the BI topology (data not shown).
Last, we examined whether transitions between life
habit states were evolutionarily constrained. Without
constraint, we would expect that each state would be
equally likely to give rise to any of the other state. However, the byssal attaching gave rise to significantly more
of these transitions, while the other states appear to be

nearly fixed once they arise (X2 = 37.003; d.f. = 5; p <
0.001). Even when we combined the nestling and
cementing categories as “permanent attachers” to reduce
the number of categories with a low number of observations, the byssal life habit is still significantly more likely
to be the evolutionary progenitor of all other states
(X2 = 27.999; d.f. = 4; p < 0.001).

Discussion
While patterns of convergence and parallelism are welldocumented in vertebrate groups [3,10,14-16,18-20], less
is known about such patterns in non-vertebrates. Our
study represents a major contribution to understanding
repeated patterns of evolution in a non-model invertebrate group, the Pectinidae. The complex evolutionary
history of scallops involves multiple origins of life habit
phenotypes, with five of the six life habits evolving at
least twice during the diversification of the family. Byssal
attachment was not only the most common life habit in

scallops, but was the ancestral condition to significantly
more of the habit transitions than any other category.
Interestingly, gliding evolved independently at least four
times through both convergent and parallel evolution
implying that there is strong positive selection for this
life habit. Thus the patterns revealed in this study, a
limited number of possible evolutionary transitions, and
the evolution of repeated phenotypes, correspond closely
to what is expected for phenotypes under strong selection and functional constraint [54-56].
Byssal attachment and the subsequent loss of the byssal
apparatus may have had a profound affect on the evolution and phenotypic diversification of the Pectinidae. All
pectinid species have a byssate stage to secure the postlarval scallop to a substrate while metamorphosing into
its adult form, and the majority of scallop species (5:1)
retain this early ontogenetic condition into sexual maturity [49]. Our results indicate that byssal attaching is the
most common life habit in extant scallop species and
byssal attachers gave rise to significantly more life habit
classes than any other state. Furthermore, we observed
that particular transitions between states are unidirectional, while other transitions never occur. For example,
cementing only occurs as a derived state. In contrast, the
other life habit classes, byssal attaching, free-living, recessing, and to a lesser extent gliding, are both ancestral
states and transitional outcomes. This bias in the types of
observed life habit transitions may indicate a restriction
in possible evolutionary outcomes for certain states due
to the degree or complexity of physiological changes
needed to transition from one life habit to another.
One possible constraint on the lability of a given life
habit state may be the degree of morphological specialization of the shell. If shell morphology can restrict life
habit transitions, we would expect the greatest number
of transitions to occur between classes with most similar
shell shapes (i.e. the smallest phenotypic distance). Qualitatively, byssal attachers and free-living species possess
the most similar shell shapes, and we detected the greatest number of transitions (six) between these two
classes. Additionally, both byssal attaching and free-living habits are epifaunal, allowing a simple transition
from temporary attachment to non-attachment on a
substrate - no specializations in habitat use required.
Other life habit classes are associated with a dramatic
change in shell morphology and/or specialized habitat
use (e.g., from epifaunal to semi-epifaunal). For instance,
distantly-related gliding species (A. pleuronectes and “A.”
balloti, Figure 1) share a similar lightweight, smooth,
symmetrical shell. This convergent morphology [27]
may restrict the ability of gliders to transition into a different state. Likewise, permanently attached species that
cement to a substrate also may possess specific physiological traits that may prohibit life habit transitions.

Based on these observations, it would appear that
some life habit classes are evolutionary dead ends. To
examine this hypothesis it is important to consider
whether all life habit classes have had sufficient time to
serve as progenitor states. It may be that because
lineages exhibiting byssal attaching are the most ancestral and widespread in the Pectinidae, sufficient time has
passed to allow opportunities to generate other life
habits, whereas “younger” lineages from the Miocene,
such as those exhibiting gliding [29,57], may not have
not had enough time to diversify. The cementing life
habit seems to support of the hypothesis that some
states are “dead ends.” This state is old (Jurassic) and
appears to have been more common during the Jurassic
and Early Cretaceous periods than at present [58]. This
suggests that although there may have been ample
opportunities for the cementing life habit to function as
a progenitor state, these lineages either were unable to
transition to another life habit or went extinct before a
transition.
Our ancestral state reconstruction analysis identified
the minimum number of transitions on the tree, but
due to incomplete taxonomic sampling, our analysis
may not have detected all life habit transitions. However, the majority (58%) of the life habit transitions discussed in this study occur in clades that were most
densely sampled (see dashed boxes in Figure 1). So far,
the phylogenetic relationships within these clades generally follow the currently accepted taxonomic classification of scallops. In the remaining clades where
taxonomic sampling is less complete, the majority of the
unsampled taxa belong to the tribes Chlamydini (75 species) and Mimachlamydini (25 species). While the genera within these tribes largely are nonmonophyletic in
our analyses, an increase in sampling may alter some
phylogenetic relationships. However, since the majority
of these taxa are byssate [29] it is unlikely that the addition of these species will alter the main conclusions of
this work.

Conclusions
Our study suggests that scallops have iteratively
evolved similar life habit types. Previous authors have
hypothesized that morphological evolution in the Pectinidae is highly repetitive, with particular shell forms
representing putative adaptations to specific living
habits [29,30,59]. Our results support this hypothesis,
but the role of shell morphology needs to be further
studied. Because life habit and shell morphology are
closely linked [30,60], a formal test of the association
between life habit and shell forms relative to pectinid
ecology is needed. Recently, Serb et al. [27] identified
substantial convergence of shell morphology in a subset of gliding scallop species which suggests that

iterative morphological evolution may be more prevalent in the family than previously thought. Further
investigations into the convergence of shell morphology and life habit could provide insight into what compensatory changes in morphology are required to allow
transitions between life habits.
