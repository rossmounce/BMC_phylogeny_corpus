Abstract
Background: Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is currently the reference method for genotyping Streptococcus
agalactiae strains, the leading cause of infectious disease in newborns and a major cause of disease in
immunocompromised children and adults. We describe here a genotyping method based on multiple locus
variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) applied to a population of S. agalactiae strains of various
origins characterized by MLST and serotyping.
Results: We studied a collection of 186 strains isolated from humans and cattle and three reference strains (A909,
NEM316 and 2603 V/R). Among 34 VNTRs, 6 polymorphic VNTRs loci were selected for use in genotyping of the
bacterial population. The MLVA profile consists of a series of allele numbers, corresponding to the number of
repeats at each VNTR locus. 98 MLVA genotypes were obtained compared to 51 sequences types generated by
MLST. The MLVA scheme generated clusters which corresponded well to the main clonal complexes obtained by
MLST. However it provided a higher discriminatory power. The diversity index obtained with MLVA was 0.960
compared to 0.881 with MLST for this population of strains.
Conclusions: The MLVA scheme proposed here is a rapid, cheap and easy genotyping method generating results
suitable for exchange and comparison between different laboratories and for the epidemiologic surveillance of S.
agalactiae and analyses of outbreaks.

Background
Streptococcus agalactiae, one of the group B streptococci (GBS), is a leading cause of bovine mastitis [1]
and has been implicated in cases of invasive disease in
humans since the 1960s and 1970s [2]. GBS have
emerged as major pathogens in neonates [3] and in
elderly adults, in whom they cause invasive infections,
such as meningitis, soft tissue infections, endocarditis
and osteoarticular infections [4,5]. There is a considerable body of evidence to suggest a genetic link between
bovine isolates and the emerging human isolates [6,7].
GBS isolates were initially distinguished on the basis
of differences in capsule polysaccharides, giving rise to

10 different serotypes [8,9]. Serotype III has been identified as a marker of late-onset neonatal disease isolates
[10], but serotyping does not have sufficient discriminatory power to distinguish between isolates. Molecular
methods have therefore been developed to determine
the genetic relationships between isolates: multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis [11], ribotyping [12], random
amplified polymorphism DNA (RAPD) [13,14] and
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) [15]. These
methods make it possible to compare isolates and to
define particular bacterial genogroups associated with
invasive isolates in neonates. These findings were confirmed by multilocus sequence typing, as described by
Jones et al. [16]. Other studies have shown that
sequence type 17 (ST-17) isolates are associated with
invasive behavior [17,18]. Two methods are currently
used to explore the genetic links between isolates: PFGE

for epidemiological studies, and MLST for both epidemiological and phylogenetic studies.
Analyses of fully sequenced bacterial genomes have
revealed the existence of tandemly repeated sequences
varying in size, location and the type of repetition [19].
Tandem repeats (TR) consist of a direct repetition of
between one and more than 200 nucleotides, which may
or may not be perfectly identical, located within or
between genes. Depending on the size of the unit, the
TR may be defined as a microsatellite (up to 9 bp) or a
minisatellite (more than 9 bp) [19]. A fraction of these
repeated sequences display intraspecies polymorphism
and are described as VNTRs (variable number of tandem repeats). The proportion of VNTRs in the genome
varies between bacterial species. Indeed, variation in the
number of repeats at particular loci is used by some
bacteria as a means of rapid genomic and phenotypic
adaptation to the environment [20].
A molecular typing method based on VNTRs variability
has recently been developed and applied to the typing of
several bacterial pathogens [19]. Multiple locus VNTR analysis, or MLVA, is a PCR-based method that was originally
developed for the typing of Haemophilus influenzae [21],
Mycobacterium tuberculosis [22] and two bacterial species
with potential for use in bioterrorism, Bacillus anthracis
and Yersinia pestis [23,24]. This method has since been
shown to be useful for the genotyping of several other bacterial species causing disease in humans, including Streptococcus pneumoniae [25], Legionella pneumophila [26],
Brucella [27,28], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [29] and Staphylococcus aureus [30]. This technique has several advantages. For example, in bacterial species with high levels of
genetic diversity, the study of six to eight markers is sufficient for accurate discrimination between strains [26].
Highly monomorphic species, such as B. anthracis, may be
typed by MLVA, but this requires the use of a larger number of markers (25 VNTRs for B. anthracis) [31]. The discriminatory power of MLVA may also be increased by
adding extra panels of more polymorphic markers [28] or
by sequencing repeated sequences displaying internal variability [26]. Conversely, the evaluation of differences in the
number of repeats only, on the basis of MLVA, is a cheap
and rapid method that is not technically demanding. The
work of Radtke et al. showed relevance of MLVA for S.
agalactiae genotyping [32].
Our aim in this study was to develop a MLVA scheme
for the genotyping of a population of S. agalactiae
strains of various origins previously characterized by
MLST.

Methods
Strains

Our collection consisted of 186 epidemiologically unrelated S. agalactiae strains, isolated from humans and

Page 2 of 13

cattle between 1966 and 2004 in France. Five of the 152
human strains were isolated from the gastric fluid of
neonates, 71 were isolated from cases of vaginal carriage, 59 were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and 17
were isolated from cultures of blood from adults presenting confirmed endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria [33]. The 34 bovine strains were
isolated from cattle presenting clinical signs of mastitis.
We also studied three reference strains: NEM316, A909
and 2603 V/R. Each strain had previously been identified on the basis of Gram-staining, colony morphology,
beta-hemolysis and Lancefield group antigen determination (Slidex Strepto Kit ®, bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile,
France). The capsular serotype was identified with the
Pastorex® rapid latex agglutination test (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) and by molecular serotyping, as described
by Manning et al. [34]. We were unable to determine
the serotype for 20 strains.
DNA extraction

The bacteria were lysed mechanically with glass beads
and their genomic DNA was extracted with an Invisorb® Spin Cell Mini kit (Invitek, Berlin, Germany).
MLST and assignment to clonal clusters

MLST was carried out as previously described [16].
Briefly, PCR was used to amplify small (≈ 500 bp) fragments from seven housekeeping genes (adhP, pheS, atr,
glnA, sdhA, glcK and tkt) chosen on the basis of their
chromosomal location and sequence diversity. The
seven PCR products were purified and sequenced and
an allele number was assigned to each fragment on the
basis of its sequence. A sequence type (ST), based on
the allelic profile of the seven amplicons, was assigned
to each strain. The sequences of all new alleles and the
composition of the new STs identified are available
from http://pubmlst.org/sagalactiae/. Strains were
grouped into clonal complexes (CCs) with eBURST software [35]. An eBURST clonal complex (CC) was defined
as all allelic profiles sharing six identical alleles with at
least one other member of the group. The term “singleton ST” refers to a ST that did not cluster into a CC.
Identification of VNTR loci

Tandem repeats were identified in the sequenced genomes of the three reference strains, NEM316, A909 and
2603 V/R, with the Microbial Tandem Repeats Database
http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr[36] and the Tandem
Repeats Finder program [37]. We determined the size of
the repeat sequence and the number of repeat units for
the three reference strains. BLAST analysis was carried
out to determine whether the repeats were located
within or between genes and to identify a hypothetical
function for the open reading frame involved. The TR

locus name was defined according to the following
nomenclature: common name_size of the repeat sequence_size of the amplicon for the reference strain_corresponding number of repeats (Table 1). The primers
used for amplification targeted the 5’ and 3’ flanking
regions of selected loci and matched the sequences present at these positions in the genomes of strains
NEM316, A909 and 2603 V/R. We initially selected and
evaluated 34 tandem repeats with repeat units of more
than 9 bp in length. Some TRs were not present in all
the strains, some were present in all strains and displayed no polymorphism, and others were too large for
amplification in standard conditions. Six TRs were
retained for this study, selected on the basis of their
greater stability and discriminatory power for four of
the six (Table 1).
Multiple locus VNTR analysis (MLVA)

The primers used for the VNTRs amplification are presented in Table 2. Three loci have already been
described by Radtke et al. in a contemporary study but
were amplified here with other primers [32] (Table 2).
For the SAG7 locus, no amplification was observed with
primers directly flanking the TR for 14% (26/189) of the
strains. A second primer pair targeting larger consensual
flanking regions was designed to confirm the absence of
the locus. PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 μl
containing 10 ng DNA, 1 × PCR Reaction Buffer, 2 mM
MgCl 2 (Applied Biosystems), 5% DMSO (dimethyl

sulfoxide), 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), 200 μM of each dNTP and 0.5 μM of each
flanking primer (Eurogentec, Belgium). Amplification
was performed in a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: initial denaturation for 5 min at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation for 30 s at 94°C, annealing for 30 s at 50°C
and elongation for 60 s at 72°C plus a final elongation
step for 7 min at 72°C. We separated 10 μl of PCR product by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel (Eurogentec,
Belgium), which was also loaded with a 100 bp DNA
size ladder (New England BioLabs). Electrophoresis was
performed in 20 cm-long gels, in 1× TBE buffer (89
mM Tris-Borate, 2.5 mM EDTA) containing 1 μg/ml
ethidium bromide run at 10 V/cm. In each run, at least
one lane was loaded with PCR product from one of the
reference strains, NEM316, A909 or 2603 V/R. The gels
were photographed under ultraviolet illumination, with
Vision-Capt® Software (Vilber-Lourmat, Marne la Vallée, France). The number of repeats for each VNTR was
deduced from amplicon size, by comparison with the
reference strain, for which the number of repeats was
known. The allele number corresponded to the number
of repeats. For the SAG7 locus, the lack of a VNTR was
revealed by the absence of amplification with the first
primer pair and the amplification of a fragment of the
expected size with the second primer pair, which targeted larger consensual flanking regions. In this case, an
allele number of 0 was given. For the SAG21 locus, a

117 bp PCR product was obtained, demonstrating deletion of the inserted sequence and, thus, the absence of a
VNTR. An allele number of 0 was also assigned in this
case. The MLVA genotype of a strain was expressed as
its allelic profile, corresponding to the number of
repeats at each VNTR, listed in the order SAG2, SAG3,
SAG4, SAG7, SAG21, SAG22.
Data analysis

The polymorphism index of individual or combined
VNTR loci was calculated with the Hunter-Gaston
diversity index [38], an application of Simpson’s index
of diversity [39]. Confidence intervals (CI) were calculated as described by Grundmann et al. [40]. The categorical coefficient (also called Hamming’s distance) and
unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean
(UPGMA) clustering approaches were run within BioNumerics. A cutoff value of 50% similarity was applied
to define MLVA clusters. The minimum spanning tree
(MST) was generated with BioNumerics. Each circle
represents an MLVA genotype and its size is proportional to the number of strains. A logarithmic scale was
used when drawing branches. The thicker branches link
the MLVA genotypes differing by only one allele, the
thinner branches link MLVA genotypes differing by
more than one allele.

Results
MLST genotyping

MLST was performed on the 189 S. agalactiae strains,
identifying a total of 51 individual STs. Eburst analysis
clustered the STs into five clonal complexes (CC17,
CC19, CC10, CC23 and CC7), two groups with only two
STs and six singletons (Table 3). Two of the CCs –
CC17 (73 strains) and CC19 (63 strains) – accounted
for 72% (136/189) of the strains. CC23 accounted for
8% (15/189) of the strains. The various serotypes of S.
agalactiae were distributed between multiple CCs and
singleton STs. STs were characterized by a predominant
serotype: serotype V in ST-1, serotype III in ST-17 and
ST-19, serotype Ib in ST-10 and ST-12. ST-23 contained

two serotypes (serotype Ia and III; Table 3). The population was therefore representative of S. agalactiae diversity in terms of anatomic origin, serotypes and clonal
complexes (Table 3).
Description of the MLVA scheme

The six VNTRs were amplified from all 189 strains.
MLVA was carried out with individual PCRs and agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplicons, as shown in
Figure 1, for a subset of VNTRs. The repeat unit size of
the six VNTRs was between 18 bp and 159 bp, making
it straightforward to estimate the size of amplicons on
agarose gels. For SAG2, SAG3, SAG4 and SAG7, amplicons were between 114 and 573 bp in size and were
readily resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (Table
1). For SAG21 (48 bp repeat unit) and SAG22 (159 bp
repeat unit), few amplicons exceeded 1,000 bp and
extensive electrophoretic separation was required for
precise estimations of size. For SAG21, three strains
gave rise to amplicons of more than 1500 bp in size.
This made it difficult to assess the number of repeats
with any degree of precision, and an arbitrary allele
number of > 30 was assigned in these cases. For SAG7,
no amplification with the first primer pair was observed
for 14% of strains. This locus is part of a genomic island
and a second primer pair targeting consensual flanking
regions beyond the borders of this genomic island was
designed to confirm the deletion of the VNTR locus.
The number of alleles was between two for SAG3 and
26 for SAG21. Thus, this MLVA method combined
markers with a low discriminatory power (Hunter and
Gaston’s index of diversity or HGDI < 0.5) with highly
discriminant markers, such as SAG21. With the exception of SAG2, the VNTRs used in this MLVA method
were located within open reading frames (Table 1).
SAG2 is located upstream from the gene encoding the
ribosomal protein S10; SAG3 is located within dnaJ,
encoding a co-chaperone protein (Hsp40). SAG21 is
located within fbsA, encoding a protein involved in
adhesion. SAG4, SAG7 and SAG22 are located in a
“predicted coding region” of unknown function.

Each MLVA genotype is expressed as its allelic profile, corresponding to the number of repeats at each VNTR (SAG2, SAG3, SAG4, SAG7, SAG21 and SAG22)

Haguenoer et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:171
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/171

were confined to four MLVA genotypes (genotypes 46,
47, 51 and 57). An MLVA cluster was defined by a cutoff value of 50% similarity with the UPGMA algorithm
(Figures 2 and 3). Nine MLVA clusters, each containing
more than four strains, were identified (MLVA clusters
1 to 9) (Figures 2 and 3 and Figure 4A). All clusters
other than cluster 1 were congruent with the two algorithms, UPGMA and MST.
Comparison of MLVA and MLST clustering

MLVA clustering showed a clonal distribution of the
population similar to that obtained by MLST (Figure 4).
All human strains of MLST CC17 clustered together in
MLVA cluster 9 and the bovine strains of MLST CC17
belonged to several MLVA clusters, suggesting greater
heterogeneity of this population (Figure 4). With the
exception of 3 strains, the MLST CC19 strains clustered
into 2 linked MLVA clusters, MLVA cluster 6 and
MLVA cluster 7. The MLST CC23 strains of serotype
III and the MLST CC10 strains clustered into MLVA
cluster 2. The strains from MLST CC23 serotype Ia also
formed a separate group, the MLVA cluster 8.
Discrimination of S. agalactiae strains by MLVA

The diversity index obtained with MLVA was 0.960
(95% CI [0.943 - 0.978]), which is greater than that
obtained with MLST (0.881). For the population studied,
MLVA distinguished 98 genotypes, whereas MLST distinguished 51 different STs. A much higher level of
diversity was observed with MLVA, particularly within
the major CCs. For example, the 73 CC17 strains were
separated into 12 STs by MLST and 22 MLVA genotypes; the 63 CC19 strains were separated into 15 STs
by MLST and 35 MLVA genotypes and the 15 CC23
strains were separated into 6 STs by MLST and 15
MLVA genotypes. Nevertheless, two genotypes (46 and
47) accounted for 76% (45/59) of CC17 strains of
human origin. For this particular genogroup, the discriminatory power of the MLVA method was greater than
that of MLST, although it remained low.

Discussion
In this study, we applied the multi locus VNTR analysis
(MLVA) typing method to S. agalactiae. VNTR analysis,
a method based on tandem repeat polymorphisms at
multiple loci, has been successfully applied to many
other bacterial species [30,41]. We investigated the relevance of this tool for the genotyping of S. agalactiae, by
testing this method on six VNTR loci in 189 strains previously characterized by MLST and serotyping. The
MLVA-6 scheme is inexpensive and can be carried out
with the equipment routinely used for PCR amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis. For the six VNTR
loci, amplification was achieved with all the strains

tested. For SAG7, a second PCR targeting a larger flanking region was required for 14% of the strains, which
did not have a 16 kb genomic island encompassing the
VNTR. The repeat sizes of the six VNTRs were sufficiently large for evaluation of the number of repeats on
agarose gels. Moreover, the conversion of results into
allelic profiles should make it possible to construct databases for exchange between laboratories. The MLVA-6
scheme includes a set of markers with different diversity
indices, making it suitable for epidemiological studies.
Markers with a moderate diversity and small number of
alleles (presumably reflecting their slow rate of evolution) define clusters, whereas markers displaying more
rapid evolution reflect variability within clusters. The
MLVA-6 method described here is a rapid, reproducible
and epidemiologically meaningful typing tool.
Three loci studied in the present MLVA scheme are
in common with the MLVA scheme proposed by Radtke
et al. [32]. The 3 additional loci studied here provide
more weight to clusters while maintaining a high discrimination power. Moreover, in the MLVA scheme proposed here, only one locus (SAG7) was missing in some
strains (14%), and another primer pair targeting larger
consensual flanking region confirmed the absence of
this locus with a specific amplification. Unlike Radtke et
al., we sought to develop a MLVA scheme in which a
PCR product was amplified in all strains whether the
VNTR was present or absent. In fact, negative amplification may result from the lack of a VNTR locus or modification of the flanking regions, especially as some
VNTRs are close to transposases or insertion sequences
such as SAG4 (alias SATR1) which is close to IS1381.
Thus, the possibility of negative amplification for 3 out
of 5 VNTR loci in the Radtke et al. MLVA analysis
could be a real problem in terms of resolution and
reproducibility of the genotyping method. Nevertheless,
cumulative works allow to define the best set of VNTR
loci, as has already been done for other bacterial species
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis [22,42-46] and Staphylococcus aureus [30,47-49]. Finally, the study of 34
isolates of bovine origin provided information about
their distribution, especially those belonging to MLST
CC17.
Population analysis by MLVA revealed a clonal distribution of the strains similar to that obtained by MLST.
The greater discriminatory index of MLVA (0.96) made
it possible to distinguish between strains within the clonal complexes defined by MLST. Thus, MLVA divided
CC23 into two groups: one associated with serotype III
and the other associated with serotype Ia. Moreover,
MLVA also separated CC17 into two groups: one corresponding to strains of human origin and the other, containing several related STs (ST-61, ST-64, ST-301 etc.),
corresponding to strains of animal origin only. A

Figure 2 MLVA clustering of the 189 strains of S. agalactiae by the UPGMA method, run in BioNumerics. The names of strains (Strain Id),
MLST clonal complex (CC), MLST sequence type (ST), MLST profile, serotype and the origin of strains are shown on the right. A cutoff value of
50% similarity was applied to define MLVA clusters (named MLVA cluster 1 to MLVA cluster 9). The colors used are based on MLVA clusters.

previous study analyzing 75 strains of S. agalactiae of
human and animal origin by whole-genome DNA-array
hybridization also separated ST-23 strains into two clusters, one associated with serotype III and the other with

serotype Ia [50]. Each of these two clusters was associated with a particular pattern of surface protein
expression. This previous study also separated the
bovine and human CC17 strains [50]. These results are

MLST clonal complex (CC), MLST sequence type (ST), MLST profile, serotype and the origin of strains are shown on the right. A cutoff value of
50% similarity was applied to define MLVA clusters (named MLVA cluster 1 to MLVA cluster 9). The colors used are based on MLVA clusters.

consistent with an ancient divergence of these clusters,
whereas other observations based on MLST analysis
suggest that ST-17 strains may have arisen from a
bovine ancestor [6]. The lack of a strict correlation

between the results of MLST and MLVA may be
accounted for by differences in the markers used for
MLST (targeting housekeeping genes) and MLVA (targeting a set of diverse regions that may or may not be

Figure 4 Minimum spanning tree (MST) representation of the MLVA clustering. The colors used in figure 4A are based on MLVA clusters.
The colors used in figure 4B are based on MLST clonal complexes. White circles correspond to genotypes not clustered by MLVA or MLST. The
MLVA data for 189 strains, including 3 reference strains, were analyzed in BioNumerics. Each circle represents an MLVA genotype and its size is
proportional to the number of strains. A logarithmic scale was used when drawing branches. The thicker branches link the MLVA genotypes
differing by only one allele, the thinner branches link MLVA genotypes differing by more than one allele.

conserved). Unlike MLST, MLVA targets several types of
markers: genes involved in metabolism, genes associated
with virulence and a genomic island. Indeed, SAG2 is
located upstream from the gene encoding the ribosomal
protein S10 which is involved in transcription and translation, and SAG3 is located within dnaJ, which encodes a
member of the Hsp70 family, a co-chaperone protein
(Hsp40). The SAG21 locus encodes a surface protein
involved in virulence, FbsA. The SAG7 locus is located
on a genomic island and belongs to a gene encoding a
hypothetical protein whose function has not yet been
identified, like most of the genes of genomic islands [51].
Clustering based on MLVA data was almost identical
with the UPGMA and MST algorithms except for cluster
1. The differences in mathematical calculation between
the two methods may account for the observed differences in strain clustering. This phenomenom has been
previously observed in MLVA studies [52].
Some VNTRs for the alpha C protein have already
been described in S. agalactiae [41,53,54]. One of these

VNTRs is involved in regulating gene expression: a pentanucleotide repeat located upstream from the promoter
regulates expression in vitro by phase variation. Another
is an intragenic VNTR that modifies the size of the
alpha C protein, thereby altering its antigenicity and
strain virulence [53]. These two VNTR loci were not
included in the MLVA method proposed here, in one
case because the small size of the repeat unit (5 bp)
complicates the mode of PCR fragment size assessment
[19]. The amplicons of the second VNTR locus not
included were more than 2000 bp in size, again making
it difficult to evaluate repeat number. Tandem repeats
were also found in the gene encoding another surface
protein, FbsA, which interacts with epithelial cells and is
involved in invasion of the central nervous system of
colonized neonates. Its ability to bind to fibrinogen
depends on the number of repeats of a unit of 16 amino
acids present at its N-terminus [55]. A particular number of repeats is associated with the greater potential of
the ST-17 strains implicated in neonatal meningitis to

Haguenoer et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:171
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/171

adhere to fibrinogen [56]. This major marker was
included in our MLVA method and corresponds to
SAG21.

Conclusions
The MLVA method proposed here is a simple genotyping method producing results that can be exchanged
between laboratories. MLVA generated major clusters
that corresponded well to the main clonal complexes
obtained by MLST. However its discriminatory power
provided was greater that that of MLST. MLVA could
also therefore be used as an epidemiological tool, given
its high discriminatory power, making it possible to distinguish between strains of homogenous lineages. The
specificities of the VNTRs for each phylogenetic lineage
raise questions about the role of VNTRs in the adaptation of S. agalactiae to its environment and in virulence.
Further studies are required to clarify these issues.
