Abstract
Background: The freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis (L. stagnalis) has served as a successful model
for studies in the field of Neuroscience. However, a serious drawback in the molecular analysis of
the nervous system of L. stagnalis has been the lack of large-scale genomic or neuronal
transcriptome information, thereby limiting the use of this unique model.
Results: In this study, we report 7,712 distinct EST sequences (median length: 847 nucleotides) of
a normalized L. stagnalis central nervous system (CNS) cDNA library, resulting in the largest
collection of L. stagnalis neuronal transcriptome data currently available. Approximately 42% of the
cDNAs can be translated into more than 100 consecutive amino acids, indicating the high quality
of the library. The annotated sequences contribute 12% of the predicted transcriptome size of
20,000. Surprisingly, approximately 37% of the L. stagnalis sequences only have a tBLASTx hit in the
EST library of another snail species Aplysia californica (A. californica) even using a low stringency evalue cutoff at 0.01. Using the same cutoff, approximately 67% of the cDNAs have a BLAST hit in
the NCBI non-redundant protein and nucleotide sequence databases (nr and nt), suggesting that
one third of the sequences may be unique to L. stagnalis. Finally, using the same cutoff (0.01), more
than half of the cDNA sequences (54%) do not have a hit in nematode, fruitfly or human genome
data, suggesting that the L. stagnalis transcriptome is significantly different from these species as
well. The cDNA sequences are enriched in the following gene ontology functional categories:
protein binding, hydrolase, transferase, and catalytic enzymes.

Conclusion: This study provides novel molecular insights into the transcriptome of an important
molluscan model organism. Our findings will contribute to functional analyses in neurobiology, and
comparative evolutionary biology. The L. stagnalis CNS EST database is available at http://
www.Lymnaea.org/.

Background
The freshwater pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis (L. stagnalis,
Linnaeus, 1758), belongs to the phylum Mollusca (Gastropoda, Basommatophora, Pulmonata, Lymnaeidae). Similar to other gastropods such as the marine snail Aplysia
californica (A. californica) and the terrestrial snail Helix
aspersa, L. stagnalis has served successfully as a model for a
wide spectrum of studies in molecular, cellular, and
behavioral neurobiology. As compared to the mammalian brain with 1011 neurons and Drosophila melanogaster
(D. melanogaster) ganglia comprising 200,000 neurons, L.
stagnalis has a relatively simple central nervous system
(CNS) consisting of a total of ~20,000 neurons, many of
them individually identifiable, organized in a ring of

interconnected ganglia (Figure 1). Most neurons of the L.
stagnalis CNS are large in size (diameter: up to ~100 μm),
thus allowing electrophysiological dissection of neuronal
networks that has yielded profound insights in the working mechanisms of neuronal networks controlling relatively simple behaviors such as feeding [1,2], respiration
[3,4], locomotion [5], and reproduction [6,7]. Studies
using the CNS of L. stagnalis as a model have also identified novel cellular and molecular mechanisms in neuronal regeneration [8-11], synapse formation [12-15],
synaptic plasticity [16], learning and memory formation
[17,18], the neurobiology of development [19-22] and
aging [23-25], the modulatory role of neuropeptides [2628], and adaptive responses to hypoxic stress [29-32].
Contrasting the large body of dedicated studies in neurobiology, the molecular analysis of genomic information
of L. stagnalis is rather limited. The only available transcript sequence data set of L. stagnalis includes 1,320
expressed sequence tags (ESTs; derived from 771 different
sequences) generated from L. stagnalis CNS libraries that
were not normalized [33]http://www.nematodes.org/
NeglectedGenomes/MOLLUSCA/. The lack of adequate
transcriptome and genome information of L. stagnalis is
currently a large drawback for the use of this species in
functional and comparative molecular studies [34].
Mollusks have more than 100,000 extant species and
comprise the second largest phylum after the Arthropods
[35,36], indicating the phylum has been highly adaptive
to environmental changes since its origin in the Cambrian
period [35]. The gastropods are the largest group within
the mollusca encompassing over 80% of the extant species [37]. However, in contrast to their abundance and
importance in neurobiology, large-scale genomic information relating to neuronal function is limited to one species, A. californica [38]. There are two additional on-going
genomic sequencing projects of mollusks: Lottia gigantea
(L.
gigantean;
http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Lotgi1/
Lotgi1.download.html) and Biomphalaria glabrata (B. glabrata;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/ent
rez?Db=genomeprj&cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=12878); however, the genomic sequence information from these two species is currently not yet available.
As L. stagnalis and A. californica genera are believed to have
diverged over 600 million years ago, the sequencing of the
CNS transcriptome from L. stagnalis holds significant
promise for functional, evolutionary, comparative and
environmental studies of Mollusks and other species.

We have carried out transcriptome sequencing of a normalized cDNA library constructed from the L. stagnalis
CNS. This study provided 10,375 EST sequences, which
cluster to 7,712 unique sequences. Despite a substantial
fraction of the cDNAs being homologous to A. californica
sequences in the existing known sequence database, data
analysis revealed that the majority of the L. stagnalis
cDNAs are novel and have no known homologues. Therefore, our findings argue for the sequencing of the full transcriptome of this species. This study forms the basis for
functional genomic research of L. stagnalis not only as a
model system for various areas of neuroscience research
but also for general evolutionary and comparative genomics.

Results
Overall statistics of the L. stagnalis cDNA library
Double-end sequencing was performed on 5376 clones
that were randomly selected from the L. stagnalis CNS normalized library. After deleting the vector sequences, we
successfully obtained a total of 10,375 EST sequences
(GenBank EST Acc. number: ES291075 - ES291826;
ES570937 - ES580561), which cluster to 7,712 unique
sequences. The median length of the sequence reads was
838 nucleotides (mean 803 nt), the shortest being 20, and
the longest cDNA being 1044 nucleotides. In fact, close to
90% of the raw sequences (9272) are longer than 700
nucleotides (Figure 2A). The mean and median G+C content of the cDNA library is 36%.
Post-processing and sequence assembly
To estimate the level of sequence redundancy and overlap
within our library, we first ran a BLAST search against the
raw sequence library itself, and noticed that a large
number of sequences overlap, most likely as the result of
bi-directional sequencing. We then assembled the cDNA
sequences by using the CAP3 software [39], which identified 6,139 singlet sequences, and 1,573 clusters (default
parameters were used as suggested by the authors of
CAP3), yielding 7,712 sequences with unique cDNA
sequences. The median length of these assembled cDNAs
is 847 nucleotides (with mean of 862 nt), the shortest
being 20 nucleotides, and longest being 3,227 nucleotides. Figure 2A compares the distribution of the
sequence length before and after the sequence assembly.
We next translated the 7,712 assembled cDNA sequences
into six possible open reading frames (ORFs), and
selected the largest ORF for each sequence. Figure 2B
shows that 3,248 cDNA sequences contain ORFs that are
longer than 100 amino acids, which is a strong indication
that these cDNAs cover protein coding regions.
Comparison with previously published L. stagnalis EST
sequences
Previously, Davison and Blaxter [33] sequenced a small
set of ESTs from unnormalized libraries of L. stagnalis CNS

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/451

and the EST set contained 1,320 sequences with an average length of 665 nt. Using these data as query we
searched for homology hits in our cDNA library. Using a
stringent cutoff requiring sequence identity of at least
90% and a minimum alignment length of 30 nucleotides,
509 (38.6%) sequences in our library have a hit in the previous library, and 711 (54%) of the sequences in the earlier library have a hit in ours. These differences may be
accounted for 1) by the sizes of the libraries used, and 2)
the previous ESTs may include redundant sequences.
Comparison with NCBI non-redundant protein and
nucleotide sequence libraries
We next ran BLASTx searches (using translated nucleotides as a query to search against protein sequence
library) and mapped the L. stagnalis cDNA sequences to
the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; up to May,
2009) non-redundant protein library (nr), which is commonly used as the principle target database to search for
protein homologies. This database was constructed by
pooling the sequences from the following databases, followed by clustering and removing redundant entries:
translated protein coding region of all the sequence
entries in the GenBank, RefSeq database (high quality
proteins from human and mouse), PDB (protein structure
database), SwissProt, PIR (Protein Information Source),
PRF (Protein Research Foundation).

In addition, we carried out BLAST searches against the
NCBI non-redundant nucleotide sequence data base (nt),
which stores all the nucleotide sequences submitted to
GenBank to account for the possibility that some of the
shorter cDNA sequences were derived from 3' or 5'
untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNA transcripts instead
of mapping to the protein coding region. This also covers
cDNAs that are derived from non-coding RNA transcripts
such as rRNA.
The results of these two BLAST searches are plotted in Figure 3. For each e-value cutoff, we divided the L. stagnalis
sequences into four categories: (i) having a hit in "nr (protein)" but not in "nt (nucleotide)", (ii) having a hit in
both "nr" and "nt", (iii) having a hit in "nt" but not in
"nr", and (iv) having a hit in neither "nr" nor "nt". Our
prediction was that the third category likely represents 3'
or 5' UTRs or noncoding RNA transcripts. A closer inspection of the reads in category (iii) revealed that most of
these reads that actually map to EST or cDNA sequences in
"nt" do not have a corresponding entry in "nr", mostly
because that these nt sequences are either too short or do
not contain an open reading frame. The fourth category,
on the other hand, likely represents novel sequences that
only exist in L. stagnalis. However, it is also possible that
some of the sequences in this category are reads from the
5' or 3' UTRs or from non-coding transcripts. The analysis
was restricted to those cDNA sequences that are longer

than 100 or 500 bases and the results are shown in Figure
3A and 3B.
Using an e-value cutoff of 1e-6, only 34% (2,606) of the
L. stagnalis cDNAs had a statistically significant hit to a
protein in the non-redundant database (Figure 3A). Even
at an e-value cutoff of 0.001, 52% (3,930) of L. stagnalis
cDNA sequences longer than 100 bases (Figure 3A) and
50% (3,630) of cDNA sequences longer than 500 bases
(Figure 3B) have no significant BLAST matches in the nonredundant protein and nucleotide databases. This is likely
caused by the relatively low coverage of DNA or genomic
sequences from the Mollusca phylum in the current
sequence databases, including the A. californica and B. glabrata EST databases.
We next investigated the phylogenetic distribution of the
top BLAST hits. For each L. stagnalis cDNA, we found the
phylum of its best BLAST match, and then catalogued the
best matches according to their phylogenetic origin and
counted the matches for each phylum. Table 1 shows the
frequency of the matches with an e-value cutoff 1e-10 as
used by Moroz et al (2006) [38]. The hits to chordate
sequences are significantly higher than the other phyla,
including Lophotrochozoan. However, this raises a question about the usefulness of such an analysis for sequence
mapping as the frequency of hits is obviously associated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/451

with the number of the sequences available in the database. The number of sequences from each of the metazoan phyla in the database is largely variable as the
different phyla are not all equally covered. Thus, such a
presentation has the potential to introduce a serious bias
towards phyla that are better presented in the databases.
Comparison with A. californica sequences
A. californica is currently the only other mollusk species
for which an effort has been made to obtain the complete
CNS transcriptome sequences [38]. To better understand
the sequence diversity between these mollusk species, we
compared the L. stagnalis cDNA sequences (7712
sequences with an average length of 862 nucleotides) with
the EST sequences from A. californica reported by Moroz et
al [38]. The published A. californica EST dataset includes
199,689 sequences surveyed from a wide range of tissues,
with an average length of 563 nucleotides. Table 2 provides data on the cumulative populations of hits between
the L. stagnalis and A. californica ESTs. We first conducted
the Blastn analysis between the two datasets. At e-value
cutoff of 1E-6, approximately 13% of the L. stagnalis
cDNAs has a BLASTn hit in the A. californica EST library,
and approximately 6% of the A. californica library has a
match in this L. stagnalis cDNA library (Table 2). At a less
stringent e-value cutoff of 0.01, hits for an additional ~7%
of the L. stagnalis cDNAs were found in the A. californica

Comparison of blastn (search a nucleotide database using a nucleotide query) and tblastx searches (search translated nucleotide database using a
translated nucleotide query).

EST library, and an additional ~7% of the A. californica
library produced hits in this L. stagnalis cDNA library
(Table 2). Because these two species are distantly related
organisms, the low hits resulted from our Blastn analysis
may be simply due to the difference in their genetic codes.
We thus carried out a tblastx analysis to search a translated
nucleotide database using a translated nucleotide query.
As presented in Table 2, at e-value cutoff of 1e-6, the
tblastx hits of L. stagnalis ESTs in A. californica database
reached 28.9%, whilst the percentage of tblastx hits of A.

californica sequences in the L. stagnalis EST database was
11.9%. Taking together, these data indicate a relative low
percentage of matches between A. californica and L. stagnalis EST sequences.
It is possible that some of these L. stagnalis cDNAs are not
expressed at high levels in A. californica and are not detectable in the transcriptome studies; therefore we compared
the L. stagnalis cDNA sequences against the A. californica
genomic trace files, downloaded from NCBI GenBank. At

the e-value cutoff of 1e-6, about 13% of the L. stagnalis
cDNAs have a hit in the A. californica trace library (Table
3). Another possible explanation for the relatively low
match between L. stagnalis and A. californica could be that
a large proportion of corresponding ESTs match to different parts of the same (orthologous) mRNAs and are therefore not identified as a match. To test this we took the
1,074 L. stagnalis ESTs with a best scoring match to NCBI
nr and ran the respective NCBI nr match sequences
against the A. californica EST database using a tBLASTx
search. We expected that orthologous non-overlapping
ESTs from both species would thus be bridged by their
corresponding longer NCBI nr sequence match. Surprisingly only ~0.2% (2 out of 1074) of the L. stagnalis ESTs
could be matched with an A. californica EST with an evalue ≤ 0.01. Although there are several limitations with
respect to comparing EST datasets, especially when they
are relatively small in size, these findings together seem to
suggest that there is high sequence divergence between A.
californica and L. stagnalis.
Comparison with Biomphalaria glabrata sequences
The freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata (B. glabrata)
belongs to the family Planorbidae of the pulmonate gastropod mollusk. Recently the whole genome sequencing
of B. glabrata has been completed http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/
wwwtax.cgi?id=6526, however, the trace sequences have
not yet been assembled. Currently, there are 19,523 EST
sequences of various B. glabrata tissues, not limited to the
CNS, deposited into the GenBank. We thus compared the
B. glabrata EST sequences with our L. stagnalis EST
sequences. Our blastn and tblastx analyses are shown in
Table 4. At e-value cutoff of 1e-6, the rate of Blastn hits of
L. stagnalis ESTs in B. glabrata database was ~5% and the
rate of tblastx hits was ~11%. In contrast, the Blastn hits
of B. glabrata ESTs in our L. stagnalis database was ~12%
and the tblastx hits were ~17%. These results indicate 1)
that there is a significant level of redundancy in the B. glabrata EST library because many B. glabrata ESTs match to
the same L. stagnalis sequences; 2) there is a relative low
match between B. glabrata and L. stagnalis EST sequences,

suggesting a substantial difference between the transcriptomes of the two animals.
Comparison with other model organisms
We investigated the occurrence of the L. stagnalis cDNAs in
three different organisms: the model organisms nematode
worm (C. elegans) and fruitfly (D. melanogaster), and
human. We ran BLAST searches against the combined protein, mRNA, and noncoding RNA libraries in worm, fruitfly and human respectively; the results are shown in
Figure 4. As seen in Figure 4A, with an e-value cutoff at 1e6, 1,694 L. stagnalis cDNA sequences have a BLAST hit to
a protein, an mRNA, or a RNA sequence in worm; 1,915
cDNAs have a hit in fly, and 2,065 cDNAs have a hit in
human. Remarkably, 70% (5463) of the cDNAs do not
have any BLAST hit in any of these three organisms. Similar results are shown in Figure 4B, with a BLAST cutoff at
0.01. In this case, 54% (4,179) of the cDNA sequences do
not have any BLAST hit. This relatively low concordance
reflects the substantial evolutionary distance between L.
stagnalis and the three species from different animal
phyla.
Gene Ontology Mapping
We mapped the cDNA sequences to the UniProt protein
database, since this is the only comprehensive database
for which GO annotation data is available. Using the evalue cutoff of 1e-6, 2,242 (29%) sequences can be
mapped to a UniProt entry; using an e-value of 1e-10,
2,038 (26%) can be mapped to a UniProt entry. We identified the corresponding Gene Ontology entries mapped
to GOslim terms by using the tools provided by the GOA
website http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/. Table 5 shows the
most frequently occurring GO functional categories.
Alignment of known presynaptic genes
We identified a number of genes from the L. stagnalis
library that are functionally related to presynaptic activity
and other neuronal functions. We then generated multiple sequence alignments of these L. stagnalis proteins with
their orthologous genes from other species and generated
the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Figure 5, 6, and 7).

closely related to A. californica than other invertebrates
and is distant from vertebrates. Intriguingly, L. stagnalis
has an ortholog of the vertebrate syntaxin 7 gene, but its
equivalent has so far not been found in the A. californica
library (Figure 7).

Discussion
In summary, we reported in this study the CNS expressed
cDNA sequences of 5376 randomly selected clones from a
normalized CNS cDNA library, thus providing what is
currently the largest database of L. stagnalis cDNA
sequences. Because molluscan species have not been frequently used in the sequencing projects, this is currently
the second largest CNS transcriptome study in the entire
Mollusca phylum. Although the transcriptome information is far from complete, we found only ~25% BLAST hits
of L. stagnalis cDNA sequences in A. californica sequences,
which suggests substantial genetic differences between
these two gastropod mollusks. This argues for further large
scale sequencing of L. stagnalis that will shed light on the
extent of diversification of the genome in both molluscan
species.

We found that, as expected, the L. stagnalis sequences are
most closely related to their orthologs in A. californica.
Typical examples are the clathrin adaptor-protein complex 2 (AP-2) mu-1 subunit and the clathrin AP-1 theta-1
subunit shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively. The
phylogenetic trees clearly show the conservation of these

Normalized cDNA library
In this study we used a normalized cDNA library to reduce
the high variation among the abundant clones, thus
increasing the probability of sequencing rare transcripts
[40]. We found that over 90% of the sequences are
between 700 and 1000 bp long, indicating the overall
good quality of the sequencing processes. We have
sequenced 5376 clones and obtained 10,375 EST
sequences which cluster to 7,712 unique sequences. The
comparison between our library and the previous published Lymnaea EST sequences generated from a non-normalized library [33] showed that 509 (38.6%) sequences
in our library have a hit in the previous library, and 711
(54%) of the sequences in the earlier library have a hit in
ours. The higher percentage of hits using the previous
library to search the present ESTs is likely due to that 1)
the previous sequencing of an unnormalized EST library
includes a large proportion of redundant sequences; and
2) this study sequenced ESTs from normalized libraries
which reduces the probability of redundant sequences,
and thus yielded a higher coverage. In addition, the previous library comprised sequences from the 5' end of transcripts, whereas the present EST database includes a mix of
5' and 3' sequences. It thus is also possible that a proportion of sequences of the previous ESTs generate more than
one hit in our database.
Novel transcripts in L. stagnalis
It is intriguing that a large proportion of the L. stagnalis
cDNAs contain novel sequences that apparently have no
significant match in any of the existing databases. In fact,

as shown in Figure 3B, even after restricting analyses to
sequences that are longer than 500 nucleotides and a less
restrictive BLAST e-value cutoff of 1e-6, approximately
half of the cDNAs (3,630) have no homologous
sequences in the existing databases. Many of these novel
transcripts can also be translated into long sequences of
amino acids. For example one cDNA (Contig 596; Supplementary Material, http://www.Lymnaea.org/) has 3216
nucleotides containing 505 consecutively translated
amino acids. Interestingly, the closest sequence homolog
for this sequence is a RNA polymerase in potato
(gi|68124015|emb|CAJ01915.1| DNA-directed RNA
polymerase [Solanum tuberosum]). Nevertheless, the large
collection of gene sequences identified in this study
include structural proteins, heat shock proteins, transcription factors, ion channels, receptors, and protein kinases.
Alignment and phylogenetic trees
We have aligned a number of presynaptic protein
sequences from L. stagnalis to those of other model organisms. The L. stagnalis presynaptic protein sequences tested
here are highly homologous to other species, consistent
with the notion that both invertebrates and vertebrates
share similar molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission (see [41]). Interestingly, we identified a syntaxin 7
sequence in the L. stagnalis CNS transcriptome. Syntaxin 7
is one of the endosomal SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) proteins
that may be involved in a conserved late endosomal
fusion pathway [42,43]. Notably, this protein has so far
not been reported in A. californica.

Our results demonstrate that the L. stagnalis CNS transcriptome data complement the transcriptome sequenc-

2406

ing project of A. californica [38]. Based on the A. californica
CNS sequence data, we expect a total of ~20,000 neuronal
gene products in the L. stagnalis CNS. We currently
obtained 2,406 transcripts corresponding to known biological processes. These annotated transcripts contribute
12% of the predicted transcriptome size. The hits of L.
stagnalis sequences to the A. californica transcriptome are
~29% (e-value: 1E-6; tblastx), and an additional 9% were
found to match A. californica sequences with an e-value
cutoff at 0.01. Amongst 7712 L. stagnalis sequences tested,
over 97% (7484 out of 7712 sequences) of them have
lengths greater than 300 nucleotides, and over 42% (3248
out of 7712) sequences contain ORFs that are longer than
100 amino acids. Assuming that the A. californica EST set
has a good coverage [38], it is a somewhat low match
which indicates the possibility that the CNS transcriptome
sequences of the two species are considerably different.
Although both species are classified as heterobranches
[44] within the gastropods, the two branches diverged
over 600 million years ago. Thus it is not surprising to see
these apparently large transcriptome sequence variations
between these two species. However, our sequencing
effort comprises only a fraction of the neuronal transcriptome and a larger scale sequencing project is required in
order to make a full comparison between these two species.

Conclusion
This study currently provides the largest database of L.
stagnalis CNS EST sequences, and demonstrates the substantial genetic differences between two gastropod mollusks,
L. stagnalis and A. californica. This study establishes a firm
basis for functional genomic research in this species, for
comparative and environmental genomics, and for identi-

fication of novel proteins important for neuronal functions, thus directly supporting and advancing ongoing
functional work in this and related model systems.

Methods
Animals
L. stagnalis were obtained from a culture at the VU University, Amsterdam, and were raised and maintained in
aquaria at the University of Calgary, as previously
described [13,45]. Animals were kept in water at 20°C
under a 12 hr light/dark cycle, and fed green leaf lettuce
twice a week. Two-month old snails having shell lengths
of 15 to 20 mm were used in this study. Specifically, the
snails were anesthetized with 10% (v/v) Listerine for 10
min. The central ring ganglia and attached buccal ganglia
were dissected out and prepared for total RNA extraction.
Three central ring ganglia were used for total RNA extraction.
cDNA synthesis and cDNA library normalization
cDNA synthesis and normalization were carried out by
Bio S&T Inc. (Montreal, QC, Canada). Specifically, total
RNA was extracted from snail ganglia using the modified
Trizol method (Invitrogen, USA). Purification of mRNA
was carried out using Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen, USA),
and cDNA synthesis using the SMART™ cDNA library construction kit (Clontech, USA). The clones contain SfiI-A
and SfiI-B restriction sites, which allowed directional
cloning. Full-length cDNA was synthesized with two set of
primers for driver and tester cDNA. Single-stranded cDNA
was used for hybridization instead of double-stranded
cDNA [40]. Excess amount of sense-stranded cDNA was
hybridized with antisense-stranded cDNA. After hybridization, duplex structures were removed by hydroxyapatite
chromatography. Normalized tester cDNA was re-amplified with the tester specific primer L4N without amplification of the driver cDNA that cannot be amplified using the
L4N primer.

cDNA normalization efficiency was strictly monitored by
Bio S & T Inc. (Montreal, QC, Canada). Specifically a parallel normalization of an internal control was performed
in addition to the normalization of the cDNA population.
In the parallel normalization, a modified reporter gene
(chloramphenicol resistance gene with same adaptorprimer sequences) was added to the cDNA population
before normalization at a desired redundancy rate (e.g.
1.0%) as a control. cDNA was cloned using a modified
pBluescript SK-vector (MBI-Fermentas, Canada). Because
pBluescript is ampicillin resistant, the percentage of this
control gene is determined before and after normalization. The frequency of chloramphenicol resistant clones
was determined and used to estimate the reduction during
normalization. In this study, reduction was 40×.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/451

Following normalization, ss-cDNA were amplified by
PCR and purified. Re-amplified cDNAs were then subjected to SfiI digestion and size fractionation in a 1% agarose gel. cDNA fragments larger than 0.5 Kb were purified
for cloning. The cloning vector was a modified pBluescriptII SK-with SfiI A&B inserts between EcoRI and XhoI. The
ligated cDNAs were then transformed into DH10B (Invitrogen, USA). The clones were arrayed in a one clone/well
format and amplified by overnight culture. The average
insert size was 1.5 kb based on a test sample of 20 random
clones. cDNA clones were prepared as glycerol stock in
384-well plates for sequencing.
DNA Sequencing
Double-end cDNA sequencing was carried out by the
Genome Sciences Centre at the British Columbia Cancer
Agency (Vancouver, BC, Canada) using the Sanger
sequencing method. For sequencing of 5'-ends, T3 (or
M13F) primer was used; for sequencing of 3'-ends, T7 (or
M13R) primer was used. The sequences listed are all in the
forward strand, 5' to 3'.
Sequence analysis and bioinformatics
The raw cDNA sequences were subjected to 5'-trimming to
eliminate the vector and 3'-trimming to eliminate low
quality portions. The sequences were then clustered and
assembled into 7712 sequences using the program CAP3
[39]. We used the BLAST program [46] to search for
homology sequences in the following sequence databases:
NCBI non-redundant protein (nr) and nucleotide (nt)
databases, Swissprot protein database, and EST databases
including the previously published EST library of A. californica [38]. We wrote PERL scripts to conduct the subsequent bioinformatic analyses (available upon request).
