Abstract
Background: Soil-feeding termites are particularly interesting models for studying the effects of
fragmentation, a natural or anthropic phenomenon described as promoting genetic differentiation.
However, studying the link between fragmentation and genetics requires a method for identifying
species unambiguously, especially when morphological diagnostic characters are lacking. In
humivorous termites, which contribute to the fertility of tropical soils, molecular taxonomy and
phylogenetic relationships are rarely studied, though mitochondrial and nuclear molecular markers
are widely used in studies of pest termites. Here, we attempt to clarify the taxonomy of soil-feeding
colonies collected throughout the naturally fragmented Lopé Reserve area (Gabon) and
morphologically affiliated to Cubitermes sp. affinis subarquatus. The mitochondrial gene of
cytochrome oxidase II (COII), the second nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and five
microsatellites were analyzed in 19 colonies.
Results: Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony phylogenetic analyses,
which were applied to the COII and ITS2 sequences, and Neighbor-Joining reconstructions, applied
to the microsatellite data, reveal four major lineages in the Cubitermes sp. affinis subarquatus
colonies. The concordant genealogical pattern of these unlinked markers strongly supports the
existence of four cryptic species. Three are sympatric in the Reserve and are probably able to
disperse within a mosaic of forests of variable ages and savannahs. One is limited to a very
restricted gallery forest patch located in the North, outside the Reserve.
Conclusion: Our survey highlights the value of combined mitochondrial and nuclear markers for
exploring unknown groups such as soil-feeding termites, and their relevance for resolving the
taxonomy of organisms with ambiguous morphological diagnostic characters.

Background
It has been suggested that ecosystem fragmentation has
important consequences for animal populations by

reducing and dividing the distribution areas and by limiting connections between the fragments [1,2]. As a result,
this natural or anthropological phenomenon is described

as a process promoting the genetic differentiation of isolated populations and could be involved in speciation.
Insects are interesting models for studying the effects of
fragmentation owing to their abundance, limited dispersal, short generation time and sensitivity to disturbances.
In tropical ecosystems, termites (Isoptera) may represent
up to 95% of soil insect biomass; humivorous termites
contribute to tropical soil fertilization [3-6]. Since soilfeeders are very sensitive to changes in their environment,
they constitute interesting bio-indicators in landscape
fragmentation studies, when the evolution of their specific richness is surveyed [7-9].
Studying the link between genetics and fragmentation
requires evaluation of breeding structure, gene flow and
genetic differentiation among populations. This implies
unambiguous identification of species. For a long time,
termite systematics was based on morphological and\or
morphometrical character sets for individuals belonging
to various castes (alates, soldiers or workers). During the
past decade, an increasing number of taxonomic studies
have shown that molecular methods constitute fast and
reliable diagnostic systems, which complement morphological identification. Indeed, several studies based on
mitochondrial genome sequences such as the cytochrome
oxidase genes, the AT-rich region and the 16S rDNA have
thrown a great deal of light on termite taxonomy and on
phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses of the Reticulitermes [10-15], Nasutitermes [16-18] and Heterotermes
[19] genera. Because mitochondrial gene trees do not necessarily reflect species trees owing to their maternal inheritance, the addition of nuclear markers in molecular
studies is useful for confirming the organismal phylogeny
[20]. Among the nuclear sequences, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of rDNA are more polymorphic
between than within species. It is generally assumed than
concerted evolution homogenizes individual rDNA
repeats and produces a mostly uniform sequence in all
repeats in a given species. Although there is intra-individual variation in some taxa, the ITS2 region sequences are
considered phylogenetically informative and able to distinguish closely-related species [21]. Such an evolutionary
pattern has allowed sibling or cryptic species in the Reticulitermes genus to be discriminated [22-24]. Microsatellites
are also very useful nuclear polymorphic markers and
have contributed widely to the resolution of colony and
population genetic structures in Isoptera [25-27]. Many
surveys have concerned the xylophageous genus,Reticulitermes, in non-natural fragmented areas such as urban ecosystems [28,29]. To date, however, microsatellite markers
have not been used to investigate termite phylogeny or
species discrimination, as has been done for other groups
e.g. vertebrates [30], ticks [31], wasps [32] and ants [33].

In the present survey, we studied the humivorous afrotropical Cubitermes genus (Termitidae, Termitinae), which
shows remarkable ecological plasticity, colonizing savannahs or forests according to species. Among the soil-feeding Termitidae, the Cubitermes genus is one of the main
builders; its nest can shelter up to 10 genera of true
inquiline or optional builder termites [34]. In spite of its
undeniable ecological interest, the taxonomy of this genus
is poorly resolved and a complete revision appears necessary [35]. Indeed, at least 64 species of Cubitermes have
been described on the basis of morphometrical characters,
but it is strongly suspected that some of these are synonymic. It is important to note that extensive taxonomic
work is necessary for the West African species since the
sole currently available key concerns the East African species [36]. Molecular data are also lacking for the Cubitermes genus, as only one sequence from cytochrome
oxidase I [37] and two from 12S mtDNA [GenBank:
AF475037, AF475001] are registered.
The aim of this work is to clarify the taxonomic status of
the Cubitermes colonies from the Lopé Reserve region
(Gabon), in order to obtain a better understanding of
tropical termite diversity in fragmented areas. The Lopé
Reserve is typically characterized by a mosaic of forests
and savannahs and constitutes an ideal setting for studies
of natural fragmentation.
On the basis of morphological comparisons with type
specimens in the collections of the British Museum (London) and the Royal Museum for Central Africa (Tervuren), and because they showed no diagnostic
morphometrical variation or molecular divergence in
mitochondrial 12S and 16S rDNA (Harry, unpublished
data), the Cubitermes colonies were affiliated to a single
species, Cubitermes sp. affinis subarquatus (Sjöstedt). Here
we attempt to reconstruct a phylogeny based on three
types of polymorphic and independent molecular markers. We sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial COII
gene and the ITS2 region, and determined the genotypes
at five microsatellite loci isolated from Cubitermes subarquatus [38], for 19 Cubitermes colonies from four different sites (Figure 1). Three of these sites were in the same
geographical scale within the Lopé Reserve and corresponded to forest patches of different ages, including
small savannah patches: Okoumé (75 years old), Rocher
(800 years old) and Chameau (800 years old). A fourth
site, Doda, was an isolated gallery-forest outside the
Reserve within a savannah landscape.

termes longiceps and Crenetermes albotarsalis (Termitidae,
Termitinae).
In total for the Cubitermes sequences, 42 nucleotidic sites
were variable (7.5%) and the overall proportion of A+T
reached 66.7%. Height haplotypes were scored (Table 1
and Figure 2) differing at 1–30 nucleotide sites (0.18–
5.40% sequence divergence). Maximum Parsimony (MP),
Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML)
reconstructions clearly showed four distinct COII haplotype groups (Figure 3). We named the first clade Cubitermes spA, including sequences from the T7, T16, T42 and
T14A colonies. The second clade, named Cubitermes spB,
included T5, T26, T34, T37, T38 and T14B sequences. The
third clade, Cubitermes spC, comprised T17, T24, T31,
T33, T46, T45 and TX sequences and the fourth group,
Cubitermes spD, only the two sequences from the colonies
of the Doda site, TD1 and TD2.

Sequence divergence was quite low within these groups.
Indeed, in the Cubitermes spA group, only one haplotype
was detected and sequence divergence was inferior to 1%
within Cubitermes spB and Cubitermes spC groups
(sequences differed by 0–0.18% and 0–0.36% respectively).
On the opposite, the divergence between the four mitochondrial lineages was high. The Cubitermes spA and Cubitermes spB sequences differed from each other by 3.94%
(net sequence divergence), Cubitermes spA and Cubitermes
spC by 4.22% and Cubitermes spB and Cubitermes spC by
4.99%. Finally, Cubitermes spD diverged by 1.07% from
Cubitermes spA.

GenBank accession numbers (AN) and haplotype names (Hap) for COII and ITS2 sequences and allele ranges (AR) for the five microsatellite loci. N,
number of individuals tested for each of the 19 Cubitermes colonies of the four geographical sites and for A. longiceps and C. albotarsalis and n, number
of microsatellite alleles found in each locus and putative cryptic species.

longiceps and Crenetermes albotarsalis were aligned for ITS2
sequences. Regarding Cubitermes sequences, we found 262
invariable sites, 25 alignment gaps and 11 polymorphic
sites. MP, BI and ML reconstructions confirmed the four
lineages found with the COII gene (Figure 4). However,
the position of Cubitermes spD was quite different since it
was not found univocally clustered with Cubitermes spA.
In this ITS2 tree, high BI posterior probabilities, ML and
MP bootstrap support values were found for grouping
Cubitermes spA, C. spD and C. spC in the same clade (Figure 4, 99/68/100) whereas a lower resolution of this
branch appeared in the tree of mtDNA haplotypes (Figure
3, 54/<50/<50).
Sequence data from ITS2 revealed no polymorphism
within the putative four species. Since no heterozygote
was detected, ITS2 sequences were assigned to four unique
haplotypes (a for Cubitermes spA, b for Cubitermes spB, c
for Cubitermes spC, and d for Cubitermes spD, Table 1).

Again, divergence between groups was high in comparison with within-group divergence. Haplotypes of Cubitermes spA differed from the Cubitermes spC haplotypes by
2.18% (net sequence divergence). The Cubitermes spA and
Cubitermes spB haplotypes differed from each other by
7.61% and Cubitermes spB and Cubitermes spC by 8.36%.
Finally, the haplotype of Cubitermes spD differed from the
haplotype of Cubitermes spA by 1.43%.
Microsatellite analyses
A total of 447 individuals for the 19 nests were surveyed
at five microsatellite loci. The genetic differentiation
among colonies within each putative species (FCT = 0.275,
0.258, 0.322 for Cubitermes spA, C. spB and C. spC, respectively) was substantially low. Otherwise, very high genetic
differentiation was detected between colonies of different
Cubitermes putative species. Cubitermes spA and Cubitermes
spD were the less differentiated (FSTAD = 0.12; CI = -0.09–
0.38) followed by Cubitermes spA and Cubitermes spC

groups (FSTAC = 0.25, CI = 0.11–0.39). Cubitermes spA and
Cubitermes spB (FSTAB = 0.49, CI = 0.27–0.67) and Cubitermes spB and Cubitermes spC (FSTBC = 0.48, CI = 0.25–
0.68) showed similar high patterns of differentiation.
The NJ trees based on the DAS distance, the minimum
genetic distance of Nei and the chord distance (DC)
showed a genetic structure with four main clusters (Figure
5).

Discussion
In tropical soil-feeding termites, it is impractical to apply
a Biological Species Concept [39] because of the difficulties in realizing experimental crosses and observing natural hybridizations. Thus, our purpose here was to apply a
Phylogenetic Species Recognition (PSR) based on the
Genealogical Concordance Concept [40] to diagnose the
Cubitermes species or to detect cryptic species. Such a concept has often been applied in bacteria, fungi and animals.
In termites, research involving DNA-based taxonomy of
structural and agricultural pest species is important [10].

Comparison of multiple molecular markers has allowed
the taxonomic status of new species in Reticulitermes to be
assessed [60,61] and has provided evidence for species
synonymy in this genus [12,14,23]. Many DNA-based
species recognitions are corroborated by evidence of morphological/chemical differences or geographically defined
groups. However, PSR can be a powerful tool for diagnosing otherwise undistinguishable species, because genetic
changes occurring in recently-isolated species may be
observed before morphological or behavioral changes
arise [41]. As found recently in other social insects, genetic
isolation is not always accompanied by evident morphological differentiation. In fire ants belonging to the
Solenopsis genus, genetic analyses based on allozyme and
mitochondrial markers demonstrated the occurrence of
sympatric and indistinguishable cryptic species [42-44].
The genetic results obtained in our study from the combined mitochondrial, nuclear and microsatellite markers
unequivocally show deep separation among four groups
of genotypes in the Cubitermes sp. affinis subarquatus colo-

nies from the Lopé Reserve region. The congruence of
these three types of unlinked molecular markers strongly
supports the existence of differentiated genetic pools in
this limited area. The mitochondrial and nuclear
sequences show very little variation within the four
groups but there is considerable variation among them.
Although the allele ranges overlap for all the loci, possibly
because of size homoplasy, the microsatellite data confirm the occurrence of four differentiated groups. These
unexpected levels of subdivision are unlikely to have
arisen under gene flow, so these four newly-detected
groups can be seen as good evidence for the existence of
cryptic species previously unrecognized by morphological
techniques.
The lack of detectable morphological differences among
Cubitermes species is not surprising in view of the data in
the taxonomic literature, which imply that the genus is
highly complex (great number of species, synonymy,
missing data, etc.) [35]. Furthermore, the boundaries
between nominal Cubitermes species are often concealed
by intra-specific morphometrical variability. In his revision of the East African Cubitermes species, Williams [36]
mentioned that most of the specific characters vary greatly
in size and can also vary markedly in shape and proportion within a particular species.
In addition, our genetic data inform the current debate
about the use of comparative phylogenetic methods for
studying present-day species distributions. These distributions do not necessarily reflect the geographical range of
the ancestral species at the time of speciation, because
geographical distributions are often labile owing to climate fluctuations, territory expansion or extinction of
competitors. In particular, we have certainly not sampled
the entire species range and enabled definite conclusions
to be drawn about biogeographic differentiation and speciation. However, the repartition of the cryptic Cubitermes
species is quite interesting in relation to the species distributions of poorly dispersive insects.
In our study, we can consider two landscape units: (1) the
Lopé Reserve south of the Ogooué River, where Cubitermes
spA, C. spB and C. spC live sympatrically in the closely
apposed sites of Okoumé, Chameau and Rocher, the only
exception being that Cubitermes spA is absent from the
Chameau site; (2) the Doda zone to the north, where
Cubitermes spD is restricted to the distant and isolated gallery-forest of Doda and represents the only Cubitermes species in the Doda zone across 10 km. The ecological
differentiation of the two zones results from paleogeographic events. Indeed, since the last glaciations, the
North Ogooué has progressively run dry, resulting in the
regression of all forest types except riparian. In the South
Ogooué, a wet environment has been maintained by the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/102

well-developed hydro-geographical network and this has
allowed the forest to be preserved.
The contemporary sympatric distributions of three of the
Cubitermes species (Cubitermes spA, C. spB and C. spC) in
the Reserve zone could reflect their ability to disperse
within a mosaic of forests of variable ages (e.g. differing in
biotic and edaphic parameters) and savannah "bufferzones". Indeed, their dispersion seems not to be affected
by fragmentation on this small scale. Little is known
about the dispersion modalities and the reproductive
strategies of the Cubitermes species. It is very likely that
swarming (i.e. alate dispersal flight) is the main mode of
dispersal in this genus, since budding (i.e. local secondary
reproduction initiated by the differentiation of neotenic
reproductives, derived from the nymphs or workers of the
colony) is not as common in Termitidae as in lower termites [45]. It has been suggested that although the active
flight of winged termites is very limited (a few hundreds
of meters), the meteorological conditions accompanying
dispersal flights could strongly influence the distance covered by these sexual alates. Actually, a recent genetic study
of Macrotermes michaelseni (Termitidae) suggested that
some winged termites can travel considerable distances
(50 km), most likely by passive drift [46]. Furthermore,
the effectiveness of dispersal obviously depends upon the
number of alates and the rate of predation [47].
Finally, the particular distribution pattern of Cubitermes
spD raises the question of the link between the history of
the forest fragmentation and the modalities of speciation.
One can indeed wonder whether the history of successive
modifications of habitats in this geographical zone has
not contributed to the isolation of the termite species
populating it. Areas such as isolated gallery forests, like
Doda, may constitute refuges for fauna, where some species are led to disappear while others begin to differentiate
under the influence of genetic drift.

Conclusion
The combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers
provides a reliable diagnostic method for separating Cubitermes species and offers a complement to the morphometrical diagnostic. Furthermore, these molecular
markers could reveal useful information about their phylogenetical relationships. Similarly, such methods could
be extended to termites for which species taxonomy is
ambiguous.

Methods
Study site and species
The field collections were carried out in the Lopé Reserve
region (Middle Ogooué, Gabon). The Lopé Reserve is constituted by a mosaic of forest and savannah, primarily
formed during the last glaciations (-18000, -12000) and

then maintained by human savannah burnings, resulting
in a fragmented landscape. The sample area was composed of three forest sites in the Reserve, characterized by
vegetation age and 2–5 km apart (Okoumé, Chameau and
Rocher). The Okoumé site consisted of 75 years-old Milletia, Aucoumea and Marantacea stands. The Rocher and
Chameau sites were older (800 years-old) and consisted
in mature forest scattered by rock outcrops and classical
pluvial forest stands, respectively. Finally, a fourth sampled site, Doda, was an isolated gallery-forest in a savannah landscape, dating up to 2500 years and situated
outside the Reserve. In total, 19 colonies of Cubitermes sp.
affinis subarquatus and two colonies of Apilitermes longiceps
and Crenetermes albotarsalis were sampled (Table 1).
Immediately following collection, individuals were
placed in absolute ethanol and stored at 4°C in the laboratory until DNA extraction.
DNA extraction
Total genomic DNA from Cubitermes, Apilitermes and
Crenetermes individuals was isolated using an extraction
method with Wilson buffer (Tris hydrogen chloride 1 M,
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 0.5 M, sodium chloride
4.5 M, sodium dodecylsulfate 20%, dithiothreitol, proteinase K) followed by a salting-out procedure.
Mitochondrial and ITS2 sequence analyses
DNA analyses were based on sequences from partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene (COII) and
nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). PCR was performed for one individual per colony (N = 19 Cubitermes
+ 1 Apilitermes + 1 Crenetermes) in a total volume of 40 µL
(50 µL for ITS2), composed of 20 µL (25 µL) of Taq PCR
Master Mix (Qiagen), 1.6 µL (4 µL) of each primer (10
pM), 15.2 µL (18.5 µL) of distilled water and 1.6 µL (2.5
µL) of template DNA. Primers for COII amplification
were forward modified A-tLeu 5'-CAGATAAGTGCATTGGATTT-3' and reverse B-tLys 5'-GTTTAAGAGACCAGTACTTG-3' [48,49], modified by Miura et al. [16]. ITS2
sequences were amplified using forward ITS2F 5'-TGTGAACTGCAGGACACAT-3' and reverse ITS2Rcub 5'ATTCGGCGGGTAGTCTCG-3' primers modified in this
study from Jenkins et al. [23]. The amplification conditions were adapted from Miura et al. [16]. The amplification products were purified using a DNA and Gel band
Purification kit (GFX TM PCR kit, Amersham Biosciences
USA). Sequence reactions were performed using BigDye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit version 1.1 (Applied
Biosystems), then purified with an ethanol-Na acetate
method. Sequence data were obtained using an automatic
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, ABI PRISM 310)
and analysed with Sequencing Data software (Applied
Biosystems). All sequences were registered in GenBank
database with accession numbers listed in Table 1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/102

COII and ITS2 sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW
with the default settings [50] and sequences from Apilitermes longiceps and Crenetermes albotarsalis (Termitidae,
Termitinae) were added to both datasets in order to root
the trees. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using
Maximum Parsimony (MP), Bayesian Inference (BI) and
Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods.
MP trees were constructed using Phylip (Phylogeny Inference Package) Version 3.572 [51] with the SEQBOOT,
DNAPARS and CONSENSE programs with 1000 repetitions of bootstrap.
For probabilistic methods, a nucleotide substitution
model was selected for each sequence dataset using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) implemented in
Modeltest v3.7 [52]. The best-fit substitution model
selected was TrN+G (Nst = 6, Rates = gamma, Pinvar = 0)
for COII sequences and TVM (Nst = 6, Rates = equal, Pinvar = 0) for ITS2 sequences. BI trees were constructed
using MrBayes 3.1 [53]. We ran four Markov chains (one
cold, three heated) for 1,000,000 generations, sampled
every 100 generations (burnin = 2500, according to the
convergence diagnostic). Consensus trees were generated
including posterior probability of clades and branch
lengths. ML trees were constructed using thePAUP 4.0b10
program [54] and the reliability of the inferred trees was
tested by 100 bootstrap resamplings for COII and 40 for
ITS2. Tree topologies were congruent across all methods
and therefore, only BI trees are reported with posterior
probabilities and bootstrap support values for ML and
MP.
Microsatellite analyses
The genotypes for 18 to 48 sterile individuals from each
colony except two (T14A, n = 6 and T14B, n = 12) i.e. a
total of 447 individuals genotyped, were assayed at five
microsatellite loci (P14, P19, P32, P34 and P41) by means
of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification.
Primer sequences and amplification conditions are given
in Harry et al. [38]. PCR products were electrophoresed on
an ABI Prism 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems)
and microsatellite allele sizes were scored using the GENSCAN and GENOTYPER programs (Applied Biosystems).

We investigated whether genetic differentiation occurs
among groups detected in the phylogenetic analyses. In
order to do this, we estimated FST coefficients with individuals nested in colonies and colonies nested in major
lineages using a three-level hierarchy in the GDA program
[55], for each pair of putative cryptic species. 95% CIs
were constructed by bootstrapping over loci with 1000
replications. Values for which 95% CIs did not overlap
zero were considered as significantly different at the 0.05
level. We compared the allele differentiation among colo-

nies of the same genetic group and among colonies of the
same geographical site using the FCT coefficient [56] calculated with a two-level hierarchy in the GDA program.

Phylogenetic distances between colonies were estimated
with the Populations 1.2.00 program [57] by using the
genetic distance of shared alleles, the minimum genetic
distance of Nei and the chord distance of Cavalli-Sforza.
The resulting genetic distances and bootstrapping procedures (1000 replicates) were used to construct an
unrooted consensus tree. Tree topologies were congruent
across the three methods and therefore, only one reconstruction is presented here (reconstruction based on the
chord distance of Cavalli-Sforza).
