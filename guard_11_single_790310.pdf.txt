Single nucleotide polymorphisms that
differentiate two subpopulations of Salmonella
enteritidis within phage type
Jean Guard*, Cesar A Morales, Paula Fedorka-Cray and Richard K Gast

Abstract
Background: Salmonella Enteritidis is currently the world’s leading cause of salmonellosis, in part because of its
ability to contaminate the internal contents of eggs. Previous analyses have shown that it is an exceptionally clonal
serotype, which nonetheless generates considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. Due to its clonality, whole genome
analysis is required to find genetic determinants that contribute to strain heterogeneity of Salmonella Enteritidis.
Comparative whole genome mutational mapping of two PT13a strains that varied in the ability to contaminate
eggs and to form biofilm was achieved using a high-density tiling platform with primers designed from a PT4
reference genome. Confirmatory Sanger sequencing was used on each putative SNP identified by mutational
mapping to confirm its presence and location as compared to the reference sequence. High coverage
pyrosequencing was used as a supporting technology to review results.
Results: A total of 250 confirmed SNPs were detected that differentiated the PT13a strains. From these 250 SNPS,
247 were in the chromosome and 3 were in the large virulence plasmid. SNPs ranged from single base pair
substitutions to a deletion of 215 bp. A total of 15 SNPs (3 in egg-contaminating PT13a 21046 and 12 in biofilm
forming PT13a 21027) altered coding sequences of 16 genes. Pyrosequencing of the two PT13a subpopulations
detected 8.9% fewer SNPs than were detected by high-density tiling. Deletions and ribosomal gene differences
were classes of SNPs not efficiently detected by pyrosequencing.
Conclusions: These results increase knowledge of evolutionary trends within Salmonella enterica that impact the
safety of the food supply. Results may also facilitate designing 2nd generation vaccines, because gene targets were
identified that differentiate subpopulations with variant phenotypes. High-throughput genome sequencing
platforms should be assessed for the ability to detect classes of SNPs equivalently, because each platform has
different advantages and limits of detection.

Background
Salmonella enterica subspecies I serotype Enteritidis
(S. Enteritidis) is a leading cause of salmonellosis worldwide [1,2]. It is the only serotype of approximately 1400
that has evolved the ability to survive in the internal contents of eggs produced by otherwise healthy hens and to
be linked to frequent human illness [3]. S. Enteritidis contaminates foods other than eggs and it colonizes animals
other than chickens [2,4,5]. However, it is predominantly

associated with eggs, egg products, poultry, the farm environment, and cross contamination of other foods from eggs
[1,3,4,6]. S. Gallinarum and S. Pullorum are avian-pathogenic serotypes of Salmonella enterica that are closely
related to S. Enteritidis. They too contaminate eggs, but
they have accumulated a number of pseudogenes that
severely limit host range [7,8]. Other Salmonellae may be
found in eggs, but only S. Enteritidis does so in a manner
that propagates efficiently through the food chain.
S. Enteritidis is unique in part because it produces a specialized LPS O-antigen capsule that contributes to long
term survival in eggs [9-11].

Strains of S. Enteritidis vary greatly in their ability to
contaminate eggs and this virulence attribute is independent of phage type lineage [12,5,13-15,10]. The ability to
metabolize a wide range of amino acids has been linked
to virulence [10,11,16], as has the ability to make the
O-antigen capsule. Strain heterogeneity and variant
metabolic profiles may facilitate completion of the infection pathway by overcoming a multitude of microenvironments resulting from cellular barriers, flock immunity
and management practices [12]. Another reason S. Enteritidis may generate strain heterogeneity is to facilitate
colonization of the reproductive tract of hens, which is
subject to hormonally-dependent cyclical changes that
impact local immunity and cell function [12,17,18].
S. Enteritidis produces 3 classes of fimbriae that contribute to colonization and invasion [19]. S. Enteritidis has
a full repertoire of virulence factors in common with
other pathogenic Salmonellae such as S. Typhimurium
[8,20,21].
To understand more details of the evolutionary trends
that contribute to the unique ability of some strains of
S. Enteritidis to contaminate eggs requires analysis of
whole genome databases, in large part to select genes
relevant for evaluating in biological studies. We applied
three methods of genome analysis to detect and confirm
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that differentiate gene content of two PT13a S. Enteritidis strains.
These approaches were mutational mapping using a
high density tiling microarray, pyrosequencing and confirmatory F/R Sanger sequencing of all suspect SNPs. A
critical component of the research was strain selection.
The strains that were compared were previously shown
to vary in metabolic properties and in the ability to contaminate eggs [12,22,23]. Strain PT13a 21046 contaminates eggs, but does not form biofilm. In contrast,
PT13a 21027 does not contaminate eggs, but does form
biofilm. The phenotypes for these strains are thus BF+,
EC- and BF-, EC+ respectively. Both of the PT13a
strains were compared directly to strain PT4 22079,
which contaminates eggs, forms biofilm (BF+, EC+) and
has a metabolic profile intermediate to that of the two
PT13a strains [11]. Thus, two highly clonal PT13a
strains were available for comparing to a slightly more
genetically distant strain of a different phage type. By
triangulating three genomic databases, it became possible to find only those SNPs that differentiated the two
PT13a strains. By using redundant methods for processing genomes, we increased the stringency of analysis
and revealed some inherent limitations of each method.
Results here show the chromosomal differences that differentiate two PT13a strains that vary in the ability to
contaminate eggs and to form biofilm. This work was
made possible by the availability of the whole genome

sequence from PT4 S. Enteritidis P125109 (Refseq
NC_011294) [8].

Results
Biofilm formation facilitated strains selection

Biofilm formation was a useful phenotypic trait for identifying strains for comparison, because it was a simple agarbased assay that facilitated identification of strains that
varied in metabolic properties, invasion potential, and in
the ability to contaminate eggs (Figure 1) [17]. To reiterate, PT13a 21027 formed a strong biofilm but did not contaminate eggs (BF+ EC-), PT13a 21046 did not form
biofilm but did contaminate eggs (BF- EC+), whereas PT4
22079 formed biofilm and contaminated eggs (BF+ EC+).
The strong biofilm of PT13a 21027 was distinguishable
from the weak one formed by PT4 22079, because the latter took longer to form and was never developed as in
21027 [Figure 1].
S. Enteritidis strains chosen for analysis have commonly
encountered PFGE patterns

At the time of analysis, the USDA VetNet PFGE database
had 676 Enteritidis isolates and 51 unique patterns.
PT13a 21027 was pattern JEGX01.0003 ARS (PulseNet
equivalent pattern JEGX01.0004) (Figure 2). This pattern
is the most common Enteritidis pattern in the database
(308 out of 676 - 45.56%). PT13a 21046 was pattern
JEGX01.0013 ARS (PulseNet equivalent pattern
JEGX01.0037) (Figure 2). This pattern is the 10th most
common Enteritidis pattern in the database (3 out of 676
- 0.44%). PT4 22079 was pattern JEGX01.0017 ARS (PulseNet equivalent pattern JEGX01.0002) (Figure 2). This
pattern is the 6th most common Enteritidis pattern in the
database. PFGE results indicate that the two strains being
compared in reference to the PT4 genome are representative of strains found in outbreaks. PT13a 21027, which
had the most common VN PFGE fingerprint, had a prominent biofilm within 48 hr at ambient temperatures on
select media.
Subpopulation biology of S. Enteritidis results from
accumulation of SNPs, only some of which appear
consequential for phenotype

Of the 250 confirmed polymorphisms that differentiated
PT13a 21046 from PT13a 21027, 132 (52.8%) did not alter
amino acid sequence (Table 1; For details, see Additional
File 1). Of the 132 polymorphisms that did not alter
amino acid sequences, 38 were intergenic, 12 involved
ribosomal genes, and 82 were synonymous nucleotide substitutions The 3 SNPs that were in virulence plasmids
were intergenic. Of the 250 polymorphisms, 115 (46.0%)
were non-synonymous and thus they altered primary
amino acid sequence. Five of 250 SNPs (2%) introduced

premature termination codons in putative genes. Table 1
summarizes the types of SNPs detected. Overall, less than
0.01% of the total genome content differentiated PT13a
subpopulations. However, when expressed as a percentage
of total genes with non-synonymous changes, 1.1% and
1.5% of genes from PT13a 21046 and PT13a 21027 varied
from PT4 22079, respectively. PT13a 21046 had a higher
incidence of SNPs in ribosomal genes than did PT13a
21027, but PT13a 21027 accumulated more ORF-disrupting events than did PT13a 21046 (Table 1).
Detection of rare substitutions of amino acids within
proteins is important, because a dramatic change in the
class of amino acid is more likely to affect function. Of
the 100 amino acid substitutions, neutral non-polar (nn)
and neutral polar (np) amino acids were frequently substituted within the two chemical classes, but substitution
between acidic and basic polar amino acids did not
occur (Table 2). Between these two extremes, substitution of np for acidic (ap) or basic (bp) amino acids was
very rare. Further research is needed to show the impact
of altered amino acid sequence on protein function.

respectively, according to PulseNet typing classification schemes.

Lysogenic bacteriophage in the reference genome but
absent in test genomes was easily detected

Mutational mapping of the two PT13a strains gave a
prominent signal at a site in the reference genome
known to include an ST64b-like bacteriophage, which
defines the PT4 lineage. The absence of binding by the
PT13a strains to the PT4 primers that hybridized
ST64b-like sequence resulted in a run length (number

has so far only been associated with the presence of a
lysogenic bacteriophage.
A bacteriophage absent in the reference but present in
the test strains was detected by interval mapping

The strategy used for comparison of genomes is inherently biased against detection of inserts in PT13a genomes compared to the PT4 reference genome, because
no PT13a specific primers would have been generated

from the PT4 genome. For example, DNA-DNA microarray hybridization had previously detected bacteriophage
Fels2 in S. Enteritidis PT13a strains [7,11]. However,
there was no possibility of detecting bacteriophage Fels2
within PT13a strains by mutational mapping in the highdensity tiling approach, because there was no template in
S. Enteritidis PT4 for production of primers that would
hybridize Fels2 sequence. To objectively assess whole
genome data for the presence of sequence unique to test
strains and absent in the reference, an interval map based
on the average number of genes between SNPs was constructed from all data available in supplementary material
(Additional File 2). Interval mapping of all SNPs from
both strains against S. Typhimurium LT2 http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_003197) helped to locate
the Fels2 bacteriophage in PT13a strains between S.
Enteritidis gene (SEN) SEN2609 and SEN2624 of the
PT4 genome. This location was confirmed by sequencing
the beginning and end of the bacteriophage 3’ to
SEN2592 and 5’ to SEN2623, respectively (data not
shown); however, the complete bacteriophage sequence
was not sequenced de novo. An additional benefit of
interval mapping is that it appears to locate regions that
have significant gaps in alignment defined by a gap of
only 5 genes. This could help to locate even small inversions and gene transfers between serotypes. Otherwise, a
strategy similar to interval mapping applied here is used
elsewhere in software that depicts gene inversions and
alignments in a graphing output (e. g. MAUVE); however, we needed finer detail to evaluate alignments to
avoid missing inserted genes or non-coding sequence
between the PT13a strains.

Assay of raw data for deletion events can be used to
detect multiple deletion events across the genome but
may miss single nucleotide events

A useful feature of whole genome analysis that would
facilitate outbreak investigations is if raw data could be
quickly gleaned for evidence of mutational events that
would distinguish strains within serotypes. For this reason,
we analyzed technical details of the size of window and
mispriming events (run length) associated in the raw data
with SNPs that were confirmed as resulting from a deletion. The 215 bp deletion in STM4551 of PT13a 21046
occurred within a 231 bp window as reported in raw data
files. It was associated with 34 mispriming events, or a run
length of 34. The 92 bp deletion in STY3762 of PT13a
21046 had a run length of 14 within a 91 bp window. The
10 bp deletion within dsdA, the 12 bp deletion in lrgB, and
the 12 bp deletion in lysR (STM2912), all of which
occurred in PT13a 21027, each had a run length of 4 that
spanned a 21 bp window. The 11 bp deletion that introduced the read-through fusion of yjfK and yjfL of PT13a
21027 had a run length of 6 and a 35 bp window. The

Guard et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:369
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/369

smallest deletion was 1 run length (1 mispriming event),
which was confirmed to be a 1 bp deletion in the gene
sefD of PT13a 21027. In a run, each mispriming event is
separated by 7 bp due to the nature of the high-density tiling approach and the size of the primer overlap. Raw data
showed that in some cases there were easily observed
spectral evidence of deletions that varied between strains.
This result indicates that larger deletions can be rapidly
detected by observance of spectral signal alone. However,
algorithms with a stringency of filtering for run length of 2
or greater will miss some deletions, and thus type II errors
(false negatives) are possible. In summary, rapid filtering
of data for run lengths of 2 or greater will catch most deletions, but there is a risk that false negative results will
occur and that the smallest deletions will be missed using
filtering approaches that attempt to avoid confirmatory
sequencing.
Description of open reading frames of PT13a S. Enteritidis
that were disrupted

Both PT13a strains had multiple SNPs that disrupted
open reading frames (ORFs) (Table 3). Using the incidence of disrupted ORFs as a measure of genetic distance from PT4 22079, PT13a 21046 is more closely
related to the PT4 reference strain, because only 3 ORFs
were disrupted in contrast to 12 for PT13a 21027. One
mutation fused two genes, which means that a total of
16 genes, 3 for PT13a 21046 and 13 for PT13a 21027,
have disrupted ORFs.
Assay of S. Enteritidis SNPs that differentiate within
phage type across Salmonella enteric

Table 3 summarizes results from BLAST searches of disrupted ORFs across publicly available Salmonella enterica
databases. The database of serotype genomes is in general
heavily skewed towards mutation in mocR and sefD; in
addition, fhuA has two alternative sequences that varies
among serotypes. Each Salmonella serotype appears to
have its own unique combination of ORFs that vary in
completeness. For example, S. Typhi lacks fhuA and putP,
whereas S. Kentucky lacks mocR, putP and kdgM. E. coli
lacks 13 of the 16 genes listed in Table 3; thus, this subset
of genes may be more likely to be linked to the biology of
Salmonella enterica than it is to the biology of either
E. coli and perhaps Shigella. Salmonella bongori lacks 8 of
the 16 genes, which suggests that the subset of genes is
more a marker of Salmonella causing illness than it is to
environmental adaptation. Finally, Salmonella enterica
subsp. Arizonae did not have complete ORFs for 6 of the
genes in the subset, which suggests that this pathogen
more associated with colonization of reptiles and amphibians has also evolved differently in regards to genes
impacted by these SNPs.

Discussion
Importance of starting analyses with characterized strains

The 3 strains chosen for this comparative approach varied in a number of phenotypic assays, which was used
as prima facie evidence that the strains must vary in
genetic content even in the absence of specific knowledge of the differences. Rejection of the concept that
there was an identifiable difference in genomic content
would have required rejecting basic tenants of evolutionary theory. However, this research does not claim
that any one genetic difference causes any one phenotype in the absence of further research to establish biological role. It is likely that phenotypes observed with
various assays require a combination of genetic events.
Supplementary material in Additional File 1 provides a
searchable database for investigators interested in
acquiring specific information on any one gene, which
includes information on KEGG pathways and gene
function.
Linkage of genotype to phenotype requires stringent
application of comparative genome approaches and
phenotypic analyses

Detection of SNPs that may be causally associated with
phenotype of pathogenic bacteria is an inherently problematic undertaking, because a change of only 1 bp out
of millions has the potential to alter the biology of the
bacterium [24]. If the genetic distance between two
organisms is too much, the ability to link a phenotype
to a genotype is complicated by the numbers of polymorphisms that will be found. In other words, the challenge of the bacterial genome is its sheer capacity to
rapidly accumulate polymorphisms, either by random
genetic drift, selection of specific genetic capabilities, or
by lateral transfer of sets of polymorphisms through
events such as homologous recombination or acquisition
of genes from extrachromosal DNA [12]. By triangulating 2 genomes of strains within a single phage type to
that of a genome from a different phage type, genetic
noise was reduced and a discrete number of non-synonymous polymorphisms were found that differentiated
the two PT13a strains. Selection of strains was key to
the success of the approach and multiple phenotypic
assays were used to select stable strains with variant
phenotypes [12].
It must be noted that there are more subpopulations
to be characterized. Also, only a few of the SNPs listed
here are likely to have epidemiological significance and/
or a causal link to virulence attributes. Further analysis
that compares mutant to complemented mutant and
parent strain is required to identify markers of highest
value for causing anyone phenotypic attribute. ORF disrupting mutations are emphasized as being especially

important in future research, because they introduce an
obvious change in genome content. Obtaining information about which SNPs occur frequently within the
environment of poultry and that can be linked to egg
contaminating phenotypes is also important, because
these can be genetic markers that may facilitate epidemiological investigations. Research is in progress to evaluate if SNPs described here are commonly found in
clinical and environmental strains and to determine
their biological impact. It is expected that many SNPs
will be inconsequential.
The ability to find a discrete set of SNPs was dependent on extensive research completed prior to initiating
genomic analyses. For example, biofilm production was
selected as an indicator of potential virulence, because it
is often cited as contributing to the ability of bacterial
pathogens to colonize, survive and persist in hosts
[25-28]. Phenotype microarray was a second assay that
more specifically and quantitatively defined how strains
varied in regards to metabolic properties [11]. Finally,
the use of a highly relevant animal model, namely the
hen infection model, increased the ability to keep analyses focused on traits impacting egg contamination. In
contrast, mouse models are inherently limited in their
ability to assess genetic factors impacting egg contamination, because mice lack an oviduct and the reproductive cycle of a hen. Other approaches to studying
phenotype include tissue cell assays, injecting bacterial
cells into egg contents and coating the shell of eggs with
cells [29]. While these methods help identify sets of
polymorphisms and biological properties specific to a
narrow niche, they are unlikely to identify the broader
set of polymorphisms required for S. Enteritidis to complete an entire infection pathway that results in egg contamination. It thus appears important for a number of
phenotypic assays to be used to characterize strains [18].
A change in 1 to 2% of whole gene content, or about 1
gene of every 100, is a point where niche specialization
of S. Enteritidis impacting egg contamination is
apparent.
Application of high throughput technology is not
complete without a discussion of limits

It is important to assess how likely automated methods
of genome analysis will generate false positive and false
negative results, because high throughput methods can
rapidly propagate misinformation. High-density tiling
mutational mapping alone was subject to Type I (false
positive) error, whereas comparative genome re-sequencing (CGS) was subject to Type II (false negative) error.
Pyrosequencing was subject to Type II error for ribosomal gene base pair substitutions and deletions, but was
otherwise accurate for calling base pair substitutions.
Mutational mapping was overall the more cost-effective

Page 9 of 14

and accurate method for finding true polymorphisms
that differentiated PT13a strains 21027 and 21046 as
confirmed by sequencing f/r strains PT13a 21027,
PT13a 21046 and PT4 22079. The cost of sequencing
was greatly reduced by incorporating an approach that
reduced genetic noise, namely triangulation of 3 genomes within the same serotype for virtual subtractive
hybridization. Combining mutational mapping with pyrosequencing may eventually be the most cost effective
and time efficient approach for SNP analysis of bacteria
that have an exceptionally clonal population structure.
Finding that pyrosequencing was excellent for detection
of SNPs that involve basepair substitutions suggests that
it may be a preferred method for epidemiological investigations, because it is amenable to being automated.
However, if certain SNPs occur repeatedly within different subpopulations, then targeted sequencing may be
more cost effective. For example, if epidemiological tracebacks could be accomplished using as few as 10 SNPs
to track an outbreak strain, a baseline cost would be
approximately $100 per strain ($10/SNP). It is not yet
possible to complete whole genome sequencing for such
a low cost, although it is required for the initial identification of SNPs useful for building analytical platforms.
Application of these methods requires acknowledgement
of method limitations and a strategy for overcoming
deficiencies and skew in order to produce the highest
quality databases.
Mutational analysis, development of 2nd generation
vaccines and future research objectives

The relative contribution of each non-synonymous SNP
to the pathway that results in egg contamination will be
better understood as defined mutants within a similar
genomic background are characterized. Knowledge of
how combinations of genes aid organ colonization and
growth will help to choose strains that are suitable for
development of vaccines. The possibility that there is a
vaccination strategy that prevents multiple serotypes
from colonizing and growing in internal organs should
be explored, because serotypes other than S. Enteritidis
could evolve the ability to contaminate eggs. These
results support the conclusion that S. Enteritidis has
multiple evolutionary trajectories, involving multiple
polymorphisms throughout the genome, which impart
combinatorial complexity [12]. Finding which SNPs
impact the ability of S. Enteritidis to complete the infection pathway to the egg and ultimately to the consumer
is an objective of future research.

Conclusions
The conundrum of how Salmonella enterica serovar
Enteritidis generates an exceptional degree of strain heterogeneity while exhibiting a highly clonal population

Guard et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:369
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/369

structure has been solved for the most part. S. Enteritidis appears to be undergoing evolution primarily at the
level of the single nucleotide polymorphism. Even bacteriophage lineages share most chromosomal information outside of regions of lysogeny. This result indicates
that exceptionally stringent methods for analysis of
genetic variation are required for characterization of
strains. This research supports concepts of evolution
that have been previously published [12]. Linking variant
genotypes to distinctive phenotypes remains a focal area
of research intended to characterize evolutionary events
that enable S. Enteritidis to contaminate the internal
contents of eggs produced by otherwise healthy hens.

Methods
Strains for analysis

The PT4 22079 was an environmental isolate obtained
from water downstream from a flock and traced back to
a major outbreak of egg contamination that was historically associated with introduction of PT4 to the United
States [14]. The two PT13a strains were from the spleen
of a rodent caught in a hen house located in the Northeast of the United States, which is a region that had
been heavily impacted by the 1980s outbreak of S.
Enteritidis. PT13a 21046 was shown to contaminate
eggs, but it did not form biofilm; conversely, PT13a
21027 formed biofilm, but it did not contaminate eggs
[12]. PT4 22079 contaminated eggs and formed biofilm,
but its biofilm was weak in comparison to PT13a 21027
[11] (Figure 1). The two PT13a strains are clonally
related, because no differences in overall gene content
could be detected by microarray analysis [11,12]. The
summation of phenotypes for strains PT13a 21046,
PT13a 21027 and PT4 22079 based upon biofilm (BF)
and egg contamination (EC) is BF- EC+, BF+ EC-, and
BF+ EC+, respectively. Gene nomenclature for S. Enteritidis is SEN plus a 4 digit number that indicates relative
position within in the genome. SEN0001 is thrA and the
last gene is SEN4356A, which overlaps thrA. Ribosomal
genes are accessioned separately, from SEN_r001 to
SEN_r022 for ribosomal RNA and SEN_t001 to
SEN_t084 for transfer RNA [8].
Differentiation of strains by biofilm phenotype

The three strains varied in biofilm production, which
facilitated confirming the presence of different genomic
variants. Colony morphologies for the three strains were
previously published, but are shown again here to
emphasize a type of phenotypic variation commonly
encountered in cultures of S. Enteritidis that cannot be
detected without following culturing methodology (Figure 1) [12]. A review of the literature suggests that our
laboratory uses a technique not in general use [17];
thus, other laboratories may not be aware that they have

Page 10 of 14

the same phenotypes within a single culture. The biofilm-forming characteristics of each strain used herein
were confirmed as follows. Colonies from primary plates
were transferred to brilliant green (BG) agar (AcumediaNeogen, Lansing, MI, USA) and inoculated at 10 different spots per plate so that colonies were well spaced.
Spacing is required to allow colonies to grow large
enough to form a well-developed biofilm. Plates were
incubated for 16 hr at 37°C and then transferred to
ambient temperature (24 to 27°C). Colonies were scored
for morphology at 24 hr intervals and given a final classification following a total of 120 hr incubation as having: i) strong biofilm formation, indicating colonies
formed a well-developed organic matrix that covered
the entire colony beginning within 48 hr of incubation
at ambient temperature, ii) smooth, indicating colonies
formed no biofilm, or iii) weak, indicating biofilm formation was not apparent until after 48 hr at room temperature and it became more organized as incubation
progressed. A strain that was classified as weak never
formed a biofilm resembling one that was classified as
strong. Colony images were recorded using the Molecular Imager ChemiDox XRS (Biorad) with epi white light
and auto-capture. Whole colony images were digitally
edited to increase contrast for purposes of publication
and have been previously published [17].
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)

The PFGE patterns for PT13a 21027, PT13a 21046 and
PT4 22079 were determined using standardized methods conducted by personnel trained in the method
developed by the Centers for Disease Control as part of
PulseNet http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/references.htm
[30-32]. Briefly, bacterial genomic DNA plugs were
digested using the restriction enzyme, XbaI (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Digested DNA was separated using
the CHEF-DRII PFGE system as per the manufacturer’s
instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Electrophoresis was carried out for 19 h at 6 V, using 2.2 L of the
buffer× Tris/borate/EDTA0.5 (TBE) at a temperature of
14°C, and an initial pulse time of 2.16 s followed by a
final switch time of 63.8 s. BioNumerics software
(Applied Maths Scientific Software Development, Belgium) was used to normalize the band patterns based
on the molecular weight standards included on each gel.
DNA isolation

Single colonies of S. Enteritidis strains were grown in 10
ml of Brain Heart Infusion broth (BHI) (Difco BD,
Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 37°C for 16 hr. Bacterial cells
were pelleted in a Sorvall RC5B Plus centrifuge at 5000
× g for 15 min in a Sorvall Super-lite SLA 600 TC rotor.
For mutational mapping and associated re-sequencing
services (Nimblegen, Inc.), total DNA was extracted

Guard et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:369
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/369

using a Qiagen Genomic-tip 500/G kit following the
protocol designated for bacteria. Precipitated DNA was
dissolved in 150 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8]) and stored at -20°C. For confirmatory sequencing from PCR-amplified product, total
DNA was extracted using a Qiagen Genomic-tip 100/G
kit following the protocol designated for bacteria (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.). Precipitated DNA was dissolved in
200 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM
EDTA [pH 8]) and stored at -20°C. Spectrophotometric
readings were performed to ensure an OD260/280 ratio
greater than 1.7 and a genomic DNA concentration of 1
μg/μl as required for CGS.
Whole genome analysis and confirmatory sequencing of
putative polymorphisms

Salmonella enterica has seven ribosomal regions that are
highly similar and which can complicate assembly and
annotation of libraries. For this reason, a high density
tiling method was selected for first analysis over 454
sequencing, because it was less likely to produce assembly artifact due to its progressive nature. Whole genome
analysis was divided into two phases as described by the
provider of service (Nimblegen, Inc.; http://www.nimblegen.com/products/cgr/index.html). Briefly, the first
phase is called mutational mapping. A set of 30-mer
probes is computer generated from a reference
sequence. For these analyses, the database of the S.
Enteritidis PT4 reference genome from the Pathogen
Sequencing Group at the Sanger Institute was used for
generation of primers [8] (GenBank AM933172) and
DNA for the experimental protocol was from PT4
22079. The primer set is used to densely tile the test
genome that has been labeled with a fluorescent signal.
The probes overlap every 7 bases. For a genome that is
approximately 5 million base pairs, approximately 1.42
million primers are required for tiling hybridization,
with the service provider stating that chip capacity is
about 1.3 million base pairs of genome and 385,000
probes. Our experiments required 4 chips to process the
entire genome of S. Enteritidis, which is approximately
4.86 million base pairs. Genomic regions identified by
mutational mapping are then fed into the second phase
of analysis, which is referred to as targeted resequencing. Any location of the test DNA that has a suspected
SNP is resequenced in the presence of all 4 nucleotides
to see which one allows sequencing to progress. Since
the nucleotides are labeled, it is possible to tell which
nucleotide is incorporated and thus identity is
established.
Although the two phases are meant to progress seamlessly, we did them separately to evaluate datasets at
each stage for sensitivity and stringency in regards to
detection of polymorphisms. Raw data were provided in

Page 11 of 14

file format that were accessed using proprietary software
(SignalMap Versions 1.8 or 1.9 by Nimblegen, Inc.). To
facilitate analysis, numerical signal data available as tabformat text files and readable with Notepad (Microsoft)
were opened and transferred to multiple spreadsheets in
400 kb sections. 3 SNPs in the genes rrlC, rrlA, and
cyaA had previously been found by use of a modified
ribotyping approach [33]. All three of these known
SNPs, which served as internal controls, were detected
by Phase I mutational mapping.
Phase II of CGS is an array-based re-sequencing process that identifies which single base pair is substituted
for another and at what position the substitution or
other change occurs in the reference genome. The
known polymorphisms in rrlC, rrlA and cyaA were
again used as internal controls for assessing specificity
and sensitivity of mutational mapping done in Phase I
and confirmatory resequencing done in Phase II. All signals for the control SNPs generated during Phase II fell
into the category “non-called ROI”. This meant that
Phase II re-sequencing technology resulted in many
false negatives. Therefore, SNPs that fell into the “noncalled ROI” category were analyzed by confirmatory
PCR-based sequencing in forward and reverse
directions.
Pairs of primers used to amplify DNA amplicons for
confirmatory sequencing of putative polymorphisms
were generated from the S. Enteritidis PT4 whole genome sequence made publicly available by the Pathogen
Sequencing Unit of the Sanger Institute (EMBL accession no.: AM933172) [8]. Forward and reverse primers
used for confirmatory sequencing are available as catalogued information at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and identified within dbSNP by
Assay ID.
The cycling conditions for an Applied Biosystems
2400 Gene Amp PCR system were determined individually for each primer pair and in general included denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, then 30 cycles of 95°C for 30
s, 60°C to 70°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 to 3 min. Each
reaction contained 400 nM of each primer, 200 μM
ACGT deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 1.5 mM
Mg++, 2.5 U Taq enzyme (Fisher, Pittsburg, Pa.), and 1μl
template DNA. Single amplicon products were confirmed by gel electrophoresis. PCR products were purified using a Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification kit and
submitted for sequencing to the Eastern Regional
Research Center (Wyndmoor, PA, USA). PCR amplicons
were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems BigDye
Terminator 1.1 reaction mix on an Applied Biosystems
3730 DNA Analyzer.
Pyrosequencing (SeqWright) was performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions following methods
developed for the sequencing of bacteria with a genome

Guard et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:369
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/369

of approximately 5 MB [34]. At least 10 ug of DNA was
submitted for each strain. DNA quality was confirmed
to have an OD260/280 ratio > 1.8 and a minimum concentration of 50 ng/uL in TE as measured by spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). Briefly, sample was fragmented
to between 300-500 bp and ends were repaired. Adaptor
ligation was used to tag fragments with a 5’-biotin tag.
Library beads were emulsified with amplification
reagents in an oil water mix. After amplification, library
beads were layered onto a PicoTiterPlate™. Singlestranded PCR products were sequenced using a GS FLX
XLR70 Titanium platform (454 Life Sciences) and product from all 3 strains was run on one full plate. Data
assembly was done with commercially available software
(Newbler™ Assembler).
Sequence alignment, similarities, and phylogenetic
analysis

Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignment was
done by the Clustal W method using software from
DNASTAR. Default parameter settings were used.
Nucleotide polymorphisms were located within the PT4
reference genome using the EditSeq and SeqMan programs. The nucleotide location of interest ± 150 bp of
flanking DNA was used to conduct BLAST searches
against the S. Typhimurium LT2 genome available at
NCBI (GenBank: AE006468). If no match with similarity
greater than 90% was found between the two serotypes,
the BLAST search was first extended to other Salmonella enterica serotypes with available whole genome
databases, then to all available Salmonella databases and
finally to all proteobacteria in the gamma subdivision.
Additional BLAST searches were conducted on other
databases available at the Sanger Institute.
Once it was determined that a polymorphism was
within a gene, all available sequences for that gene were
downloaded to EditSeq files from completed Salmonella
genomes available as public databases from NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi and The
Sanger Institute http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/
submitblast/Salmonella. Gene sequences were translated
to amino acid sequences and aligned with DNAStar
MegAlign software. Results are shown in Table 2.
Attempts were made to annotate genes and to identify
genes flanking non-coding regions based upon available
annotation from both S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. Linkages to proteins and inclusion of some information about conservation of amino acid change, gene
class and gene function is included in supplemental
information (Additional File 1).
Construction of a SNP interval map

Any gene with a SNP that differentiated the two PT13a
strains was annotated by gene accession number

Page 12 of 14

according to its location in the S. Enteritidis PT4 reference database and according to similarity to genes in S.
Typhimurium LT2 [35]. SNPs in intergenic regions were
included in the interval map by annotating with the 3’
gene flanking the polymorphism with the extension “.5”
after annotation. The number of genes between S.
Enteritidis PT13a genes containing SNPs was determined using a Microsoft Excel automated sequential
function to calculate the difference between gene accession numbers for the two serotypes. To do this, the
gene annotations were numbered from least to greatest
for S. Enteritidis PT4, and then these genes were aligned
with the similar gene from S. Typhimurium LT2. It is
important to note that the genes were initially selected
as similar pairs by BLAST search; however, the order
within respective genomes can be different due to inversions [7,21].

Additional material
Additional file 1: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
Salmonella enterica subsp. I serovar Enteritidis PT13a that differentiate
subpopulations within variant pathotypes. This file is a searchable
spreadsheet that lists each confirmed SNP according to its location in
reference strain Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar str.
P125109NC_011294 (GenBank AM933172). An investigator can type in a
gene name or label under the “find” function under “Edit” in Word Excel
to see if the gene they are interested in contains a SNP. Column
headings indicate specific information about each SNP, including if it is
synonymous or non-synonymous. This is the file that will be updated in
the event errors or additions are reported or discovered within the
database.
Additional file 2: Interval map aligning SNPs of Salmonella
Enteritidis PT13a (SEN) to the genome of Salmonella Typhimurium
LT2 (STM). This file was generated to search for gaps between genes
that might indicate an insertion or deletion that was missed by the
mutational mapping approach. Primers were generated only from the
reference sequence. If the test sequence has additional DNA not present
in the reference sequence, it could go unnoticed. Regions offset by 5
genes or greater suggest different gene contents. See text for further
information.

information and other information on S. Enteritidis are available at http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/static/Salmonella_SNPS.html. Animal
experimentation using Leghorn hens referred to in this manuscript was
completed prior to these genomic analyses and was published elsewhere
[9,11,17,33]. All experiments involving animals that resulted in the current
research project were reviewed by an Institutional Animal Use and Care
Committee (IACUC), which is overseen by the Office of Laboratory Welfare
(OLAW) under assurance number A4298-01. Any animals used in past
research were treated in a humane and ethical manner and procedures for
handling, treatment, and euthanasia followed agency, national and
international guidelines.
Authors’ contributions
