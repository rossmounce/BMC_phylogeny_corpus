Abstract
Background: H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori) is the major causative agent of chronic active gastritis. The population of
H. pylori shows a high genomic variability among isolates. And the polymorphism of repeat-units of genomics had
participated the important process of evolution. Its long term colonization of the stomach caused different clinical
outcomes, which may relate to the high degree of genetic variation of H. pylori. A variety of molecular typing tools
have been developed to access genetic relatedness in H. pylori isolates. However, there is still no standard
genotyping system of this bacterium. The MLVA (Multi-locus of variable number of tandem repeat analysis)
method is useful for performing phylogenetic analysis and is widely used in bacteria genotyping; however, there’s
little application in H. pylori analysis. This article is the first application of the MLVA method to investigate H. pylori
from different districts and ethnic groups of China.
Results: MLVA of 12 VNTR loci with high discrimination power based on 30 candidates were performed on a
collection of 202 strains of H. pylori which originated from five regions of China and Japan. Phylogenetic tree was
constructed using MLVA profiles. 12 VNTR loci presented with high various polymorphisms, and the results
demonstrated very close relationships between genotypes and ethnic groups.
Conclusions: This study used MLVA methodology providing a new perspective on the ethnic groups and
distribution characteristics of H. pylori.

Background
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a spiral-shaped, Gramnegative bacterium that infects half the world’s population and is the major cause of chronic gastritis, peptic
ulcers and gastric malignancies, including gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma [1,2]. Most infected individuals
present with no clinical symptoms, but approximately
10~20% will develop peptic ulcers and 1% will develop
gastric cancer [3,4], which could be associated with the
diversity of H. pylori.

H. pylori exhibits exceptionally high rates of DNA
point mutations and intra- and inter-genomic recombination. Recently, many molecular typing tools have been
developed to investigate genetic relatedness among H.
pylori isolates. However, these methods have limitations
including lower discrimination power, or preventing
results from different labs being compared [5,6].
In 1999, MLVA analysis was proposed as a general
approach to providing accurate, portable data that were
appropriate for the epidemiological investigation of bacterial pathogens [7-11]. However, there’s little information concerning populations of H. pylori species using
MLVA. Whether this method is available for the H.
pylori population is still uncertain.
H. pylori infections in China are common and extensively distributed, with an average infection rate of
about 58%. In this study, 12 VNTR loci of the H. pylori
genome were identified and used to analyze 202 strains

of H. pylori which originated from different regions of
China and Japan.

Results
Multi-VNTR loci for H. pylori genome

PCR products amplified from the reference strains
26695, HPAG1 and J99 were identical to the published
sequences sizes. Of the locus VNTR-2576 and VNTR614, the PCR products sequencing were consistence
with our electrophoresis results. The exact number of
tandem repeats at each locus could be determined from
the sizes of the PCR products.
In this study, 30 VNTR loci were candidated from the
H. pylori database. And we finally identified 12 VNTR
loci using analysis, which were also distributed throughout the H. pylori genome (Table 1). There’s no variation
in the other 18 loci, which were removed in the following study. The variation in repeat numbers is divergence
at the 12 VNTR loci. The main characteristics of the 12
VNTR loci are listed in Table 2, including the diversity
index of each locus.
Clustering trend of the strains from different regions and
ethnic groups

A MLVA system to the molecular typing of H. pylori
strains has been developed. On the basis of the 12
VNTR loci, the profiles of each isolate were obtained
(Figure 1). The clinical H. pylori strains were divided
into 127 MTs, which has not been described previously.
According to cluster analysis, most strains from the
same focus presented with the same or similar MTs
(Figure 1). In addition, strains from the same focus were

dispersed in the cluster tree. As shown in Figure 1, the
86.7% (13/15) of the Tokyo isolates had very similar
MTs and could be clustered into Group A. One of the
remaining Tokyo isolates belonged to the Group C, and
the others were scattered distribution. Of the Southern
and Eastern Chinese isolates, 74.4% (43/32) were clustered into group B, including B1, B2 and B3 subgroups,
and the rest strains were related to Group A, C and D.
Of the isolates from Northern China, 60.7% were clustered into two major branches, groups C1 (37.5%, 21/56)
and C2 (23.2%, 13/56), and other strains were scattered.
Of the Western China isolates, 86.0% (37/43) were clustered into group D. The strains Tibet 1, 14, 23 and 43
were related to Group A, Tibet 37 and Tibet 35 were
related to Group B2 and C2.
A minimum spanning tree was constructed on the
basis of strains from different ethnic groups: 43 Tibetan,
33 Mongolian, 15 Yamato as well as 27 Han (Figure 2).
There was a tendency to cluster into four main subgroups. However, there’re still some exceptions, such as
the Hangzhou-12 and 21, of Han strains (associated
with gastritis and peptic ulcer), were related to the Tibetan strains group. Tibetan strains 1 and 43 (gastritis),
were related to the Mongolian group, and Mongolian
16, (gastric cancer), was related to the Japanese group.
Correlation between H. pylori MTs and the related
diseases

Among the 202 samples, 14.9%, 55.9%, 25.2% and 4.0%
of patients presented with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD),
gastritis (G), peptic ulcer (PU) and gastric cancer (GC),
respectively. And in our study there’s no significant

relationship between the H. pylori MTs and the related
diseases.

Discussion
Recently, many bacterial genomes have been fully
sequenced, and analysis of the sequenced genomes has
revealed the presence of variable proportions of repeats,
including tandem repeats. Short repeat motifs undergo
frequent variation in the number of repeated units.
MLVA is an appropriate method for bacterial typing
and identification, for determining genetic diversity, and
for the tracing-back of highly mono-morphological species [12-14]. The MLVA typing was reported to have a
high-quality species identification capability and a high
discriminatory power. The method has been used in the
analysis of many bacteria [15-18], but little research has
been carried out in H. pylori. Therefore, this study
established the H. pylori MLVA system and applied to
type clinical strains.
The H. pylori genome has a number of repeat
sequences, and their repeat number results in divergence. The 12 loci identified were distributed throughout the genome. These loci had different variations in
different isolates and were able to typing H. pylori
successfully.
The H. pylori MTs were clustered with ethnic groups,
consistent with the previous reports [19,20]. The Han

strains were selected from Southern China and had little
relationship to Mongolian strains from Northern China
or Tibetan strains from Western China. It may demonstrate an apparent cluster tendency in different regions
and ethnic groups, but there were some exceptions,
which may because, unlike other Asian countries with
relatively homogeneous populations, China has a heterogeneous population from various ethnic groups. Therefore, there may be more opportunity for DNA transfer
between strains of different genotypes in China than
other countries. While Tibet is a relatively closed region,
H. pylori strains from this area have a good cluster.
The H. pylori genome shows a high degree of genetic
diversity among strains [21,22], but weakly clonal groupings of different diseases were detected, and these could
be superimposed on a pattern of free recombination.
And the relationship between particular H. pylori genotype and related disease has not been sure.
MLVA is a useful molecular tool for epidemiological
investigations and recognition of laboratory cross-contamination [23-25]. VNTR analysis thus provides multiple independent characteristics for phylogenetic analysis.
Studies have indicated that MLVA is sufficient to
resolve closely related isolates. In contrast, combining
loci with lower variability values is suitable for establishing clear phylogenetic patterns among strains that have
evolved over a longer time period. Theoretically, the

the columns stand for origin from the same geographic origin

China were clustered into two major branches, groups C1 and C2.
Western China isolates were clustered into group D. While there’s
no significant relationship between MTs and H. pylori related

greater the number of loci used, the higher the discriminatory power that can be achieved, and subtler phylogenetic relationships among bacterial strains can be
established.

At the present time, the MLVA was established and
applied to examine the clonal relationships between H.
pylori isolates from China and Japan. The loci used in
this study provided high discriminatory power and successfully separated isolates of different strains from different geographical areas. And there was a particularly
evident of H. pylori from Tibet, a relatively closed
region, which showed better cluster than other ethnic
groups. The data will aid in the development of a genomic polymorphism database of H. pylori. We have established a preliminary profile of MLVA but more
information is required for a comprehensive profile.
China is a large country containing 56 ethnic groups
and a large population. Therefore, further studies are
required including isolates from more regions and over
several more time-frames.

Conclusions
The studies indicated that MLVA method, based on 12
VNTR loci, is sufficient to resolve closely related isolates
for the purpose of H. pylori genotyping analysis. This
study used MLVA methodology provided a new perspective on the ethnic groups distribution characteristics
of H. pylori.

gastritis (G), peptic ulcer (PU) or gastric cancer (GC)
underwent upper gastroendoscopy for both visual examination and biopsy collection. The strains were isolated
from gastric biopsy gastrointestinal endoscopy of selected
patients, who had not received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors or other antibiotics during the last 2 months, revealed that out of 202
patients, 172 had either G, DU or GC and 30 had nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). Written consent was taken from
all the patients before collection of the biopsy. The study
was approved by the ethics review board at Third Military Medical University, and informed consent was
obtained from all patients before participation.
Bacteria were separated and cultured in Skirrow medium with 5% fresh sheep blood at 37°C for 24 h~72 h in
a micro-aerobic environment. H. pylori genomes were
extracted using genomic DNA isolation kits (Omega
Biotek Inc). Culture and identification of H. pylori were
done by appropriate biochemical tests and amplification
of 16S rDNA using species-specific primers
Selection and identification the VNTR loci of H. pylori

VNTR loci were selected from the MLVA database
http://minisatellites.u-psud.fr/ASPSamp/base_ms/bact.
php by estimating the size of PCR products on agarose
gels. The repeat sequence of loci ≥ 10 bp, consistency of
repeat unit ≥ 90% and a minimum of two alleles in
three reference strains of H. pylori (26695, HPAG1, J99)
were selected for this research. The locations, copy
numbers, sizes of the loci and the gene(s) involved are
also listed in Table 1.
PCR amplification

A PCR reaction mixture (30 ml) containing 10 ng of
DNA template, 0.5 mM of each primer, 1 unit of Taq
DNA polymerase, 200 mM of dNTPs and 10 × PCR
buffer (500 mM KCl, 100 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.3) 25 mM
MgCl2) was utilized. Amplification was carried out in a
DNA thermocycler (MJ Research PTC-225) with denaturation at 94°C for 8 min, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 52°C for 45 s
and elongation at 72°C for 1 min [26]. A 10-min elongation at 72°C was performed after the last cycle to ensure
complete extension of the amplicons.
Five μl of the PCR products were run on standard 3%
agarose gels in 0.56TBE buffer at 8-10 V/cm. Gel
lengths of 10 to 40 cm were used according to PCR product size and repeat unit size. Strains in which alleles
had been precisely measured by re-sequencing or by
direct comparison with a sequenced reference strain
were used (In this study DNA from 26695, HPAG1 and
J99 were used for this purpose). Multiple interspersed
negative controls containing no DNA were included
each time PCR was performed.

Guo et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:197

PCR products of 202 strains on VNTR-2576 and
VNTR-614 sites were sequenced directly with a Taq
Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit on an ABI
377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems).
Data analysis

The number of repeat units in 12 VNTR loci were analyzed and inputted into BioNumerics version 5.1 software (Applied-Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium),
and gel images were obtained using the BioNumerics
software package version 6.0 (Applied-Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium) or using UVB gel image analysis.
The number of repeat units in each locus was deduced
by the amplicon size, flanking sequence length and
repeat unit size. Data from agarose gel electrophoresis
and UVB gel image analysis, obtained by capillary electrophoresis machines, were imported into BioNumerics
by creating a virtual gel image. Gel image data were
converted into characteristics data sets. Cluster analysis
of Neighbor-joining tree (N-J) was carried out using the
categorical similarity coefficient and the Ward method.
A minimum spanning tree was inferred using characteristic data from cluster analysis. The polymorphism of
each locus was represented by Nei’s diversity index [27],
calculated as DI = 1-∑(allelic frequency)2.
Reproducibility and stability of 12 VNTR loci via in-vitro
passage

Twenty clinical strain genomes from China and Japan
were amplified and multiple DNA samples from each
strain yielded PCR products with identical sizes at all
loci. Chongqing26 and Tibet36 each yielded no product
at one locus, possibly because of mutations or poor
quality DNA samples.
The stabilities of the VNTR loci were investigated in a
long-term experiment in which the 20 test H. pylori isolates used were sub-cultured into fresh Skirrow medium
30 times by serial passages at two or three day intervals.
The DNA from the strains cultivated in each passage
was extracted and subjected to MLVA analysis. The
results of the VNTR analysis demonstrated no difference
in tandem repeat numbers (data not shown).
