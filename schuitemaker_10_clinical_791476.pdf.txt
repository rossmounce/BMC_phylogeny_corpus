Clinical significance of HIV-1 coreceptor usage

Abstract
The identification of phenotypically distinct HIV-1 variants with different prevalence during the progression of the
disease has been one of the earliest discoveries in HIV-1 biology, but its relevance to AIDS pathogenesis remains
only partially understood. The physiological basis for the phenotypic variability of HIV-1 was elucidated with the
discovery of distinct coreceptors employed by the virus to infect susceptible cells. The role of the viral phenotype
in the variable clinical course and treatment outcome of HIV-1 infection has been extensively investigated over the
past two decades. In this review, we summarize the major findings on the clinical significance of the HIV-1
coreceptor usage.
Introduction
The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into
cells is critically dependent on the sequential interaction
of the viral envelope with two cell-surface receptors, the
CD4 glycoprotein and a 7-transmembrane-domain chemokine receptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4. The evolutionary choice of HIV of exploiting chemokine receptors as
entry gateways has established a tight biological bond
between HIV and the chemokine system, turning the natural ligands of these receptors into specific viral inhibitors.
The first encounter between the fields of HIV and chemokines occurred unexpectedly at the end of 1995 with the
discovery that three chemokines of the CC family,
RANTES (CC-chemokine ligand 5 or CCL5), MIP-1a
(CCL3) and MIP-1b (CCL4), act as potent and specific
natural inhibitors of HIV-1 infection [1]. A few months
later, in the spring of 1996, a totally independent experimental approach led to the identification of a chemokine
receptor, CXCR4, as a critical cell-surface coreceptor for
HIV-1 entry [2]. These two complementary findings triggered an authentic chain reaction of further breakthroughs, most notably the discovery of the second major
HIV-1 coreceptor (i.e., CCR5), the identification of a specific chemokine ligand for CXCR4 (i.e., SDF-1/CXCL12),

and the first definitive association of a genetic determinant
(i.e., CCR5-Δ32) with HIV-1 resistance (reviewed in [3]).
Looking backward, the exploration of this uncharted area
of investigation has greatly advanced our understanding of
the biology and pathogenesis of HIV infection, opening
new perspectives for the development of effective measures for the therapy and prevention of AIDS.

CCR5 and CXCR4: the two clinically relevant HIV-1
coreceptors
Although several chemokine receptors may function as
HIV-1 coreceptors in vitro, multiple lines of clinical and
experimental evidence indicate that only two of them,
CCR5 and CXCR4, have bona fide clinical relevance
(reviewed in [3]). Both CCR5 and CXCR4 are expressed,
in combination with CD4, on all the relevant target cells
for HIV-1, including primary CD4+ T cells, macrophages
and dendritic cells. Individual viral isolates are presently
classified based on their ability to use CCR5 (R5 variants),
CXCR4 (X4 variants) or both coreceptors (R5X4 variants)
[4]). The dual-tropic R5X4 viruses are further classified
as Dual-R (R5X4 variants with more efficient use of
CCR5 than of CXCR4) or Dual-X (R5X4 with more efficient use of CXCR4 than of CCR5) [5-7]. In the absence
of a more accurate characterization, bulk viral isolates
capable of using both coreceptors are designated dual/
mixed (D/M) as their quasispecies may contain any
mixture of the various phenotypic variants (Figure 1).
Ex vivo determination of HIV-1 coreceptor usage

Figure 1 Overview of coreceptor use and cell tropism of different HIV-1 variants. Individual viral isolates are classified based on their
ability to use CCR5 (R5 variants), CXCR4 (X4 variants) or both coreceptors (R5X4 variants). Bulk viral isolates capable of using both coreceptors
are designated dual/mixed (D/M) as their quasispecies may contain any mixture of the various phenotypic variants. The cell tropism of each viral
isolate is determined by the expression levels of CCR5 and CXCR4 on the various target cells.

and induce syncytia (multinucleated giant cells) in
CD4+ T-cell lines that express CXCR4 but not CCR5.
Using the MT-2 cell line as a prototype, viruses that
did not infect MT-2 cells were designated non-syncytium inducing (NSI), while viruses that did infect MT2 cells were designated syncytium inducing (SI).
Today, we attribute this differential ability to the viral
coreceptor usage, and MT-2-positive variants are
defined as either X4 or R5X4 [4]. Of note, the MT-2
assay can only detect CXCR4-using variants, and the
absence of viral growth in MT-2 can be due either to
the exclusive presence of R5 variants or to the failure
to isolate HIV. For a precise determination of the coreceptor use of HIV-1 isolates, cell lines such as U87 and
GHOST transfected with CCR5, CXCR4, or other coreceptors, have been used [8,9]. More recently, several
recombinant phenotypic assays to determine coreceptor usage have been developed, such as the Trofile
assay (Monogram Biosciences) [10]. Patient plasma is
used to generate pseudoviruses or infectious recombinant viruses that include full-length or partial viral
envelopes derived from the patient’s virus population.
The recombinants are subsequently tested on indicator
cell lines expressing CD4 and either CCR5 or CXCR4.
While the sensitivity of the Trofile assay for detecting
CXCR4-using HIV-1 is similar to that of the MT-2

test [11], recombinant phenotypic assays are able to
distinguish pure R5, D/M and pure X4 populations.

HIV-1 coreceptor usage and genetic subtypes
The use of different coreceptors by HIV-1 is a general
phenomenon that has been observed for viruses from all
different genetic subtypes and circulating recombinant
forms (CRFs) [12,13]. However, quantitative differences
in the prevalence of CXCR4 usage among subtypes
exist. Most of the initial studies on HIV-1 coreceptor
usage evolution were performed on strains belonging to
genetic subtype-B [14,15], which remains the best characterized subtype in terms of coreceptor usage. However, a more complex picture has been delineated with
the extension of these studies to non-B HIV-1 subtypes.
One of the major discrepancies was the observation of
a low frequency of CXCR4 usage among subtype-C
strains [16-21]. Infection with subtype-C HIV-1
accounts for over half of the worldwide HIV-1 epidemics [22], and is as deadly as subtype-B infection.
Although it has been suggested that the underrepresentation of CXCR4-using strains in these reports might be
due to a sampling bias, later studies in treatmentexperienced patients from Zimbabwe [23] and a recent
study from South Africa have reported a higher prevalence of CXCR4-using variants than in the past [24],

Schuitemaker et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 9(Suppl 1):S5
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/S1/S5

suggesting an ongoing evolution of the subtype-C HIV-1
epidemic in Africa (see also below).
An inverse skewing in coreceptor usage, with an
increased presence of CXCR4-using strains, has instead
been reported for subtype-D HIV-1 [5,12,25]. This
observation is consistent with the faster pace of disease
progression reported for subtype-D infection both in
Africa [25-27] and outside Africa [28]. An increased rate
of CXCR4 usage has also been reported in a study on a
limited number of subtype-AE isolates [29,30]. Even
more complex is the situation with mixed genotypes
with only a few isolates so far characterized [31,32]. In a
recent study in Guinea Bissau, an increasing and generally high frequency of CXCR4 tropism (86%) was
observed in CRF02_AG [33].

Molecular determinants of HIV-1 coreceptor
usage
Studies conducted with subtype-B variants have shown
that the HIV-1 coreceptor usage is determined by the
viral envelope, primarily the second and third variable
loops (V2 and V3) of the external HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein, gp120 [34-37]. Specifically, the presence of a
positively-charged amino acid at either one or both of
two specific positions in the V3 loop (positions 11 and
25) is strongly associated with a CXCR4-using phenotype in subtype-B primary isolates [38,39], suggesting
that these amino acids play a crucial role in the interaction of gp120 with the coreceptors. Indeed, it has been
shown that the V1V2 and V3 regions are involved in
the interaction with CCR5 and CXCR4 [40-42]. This
model is compatible with insights from structural studies in which V3 and a conserved coreceptor-binding
site that includes the stem of the V1V2 loop are
involved in coreceptor binding. In various trimeric models of the gp41-gp120 envelope glycoprotein complex,
V2 directly interacts with V3 and both participate in
coreceptor binding [43-46].
As shown for subtype-B HIV-1, the V3 loop also
seems to be the principal genetic determinant of the
coreceptor choice among subtype-D (10 variants

Page 3 of 17

studied) and subtype-A (one variant studied) [12]. In
later studies, subtype-C CXCR4-using strains did not
show the same dependence as other subtypes on positively-charged residues in the V3 loop [47,48].

Predictive algorithms of HIV-1 coreceptor usage
The identification of viral genotypic changes associated
with different coreceptor usage has led to the development of sequence-based algorithms to predict coreceptor usage. Starting with the 11/25 rule derived from
subtype-B variants [39], efforts have concentrated
mainly on identifying sequence patterns in the V3 loop.
Most genotypic predictors of coreceptor usage incorporate information from across the V3 region (Table 1)
[49-53], in some cases along with genotypic correlates
outside the V3 [54]. Some methods also incorporate
clinical data [55]. Progress is also being made on the
inclusion of structural information to assist prediction
[56], as well as on the ability to discriminate between
X4 and R5X4 virus [57]. On cloned viruses belonging to
genetic subtype B, the specificity and sensitivity of most
predictive methods exceed 90% and 80%, respectively.
However, the sensitivity drops below 50% when bulk
uncloned sequences and non- subtype B viruses are
assayed. Moreover, technical limitations to the generation of unambiguous DNA sequences from the HIV-1
envelope region that has insertions and deletions that
prevent the generation of interpretable electropherograms, interfere with a predictive determination of tropism in a significant fraction of patient samples. This in
combination with the limited predictive power obviously
has implications for a clinical diagnostic application of
bulk sequencing technology and current predictive algorithms for HIV-1 coreceptor usage. To date, studies of
genotypic predictors have been retrospective with
patient samples selected based on availability of phenotypic tropism determinations. Prospective studies will be
needed to firmly establish the clinical usefulness of genotypic tropism determination.
As discussed below, the selective pressure that leads to
the emergence of CXCR4-using strains is complex and

variable, and clinically relevant CXCR4-using minorities
may coexist with a predominant R5 virus, even though
they remain rare enough to go undetected by sequencing [58]. In addition, not all determinants of coreceptor
usage lie within the V3 loop, the region employed by
most current predictors [35,59]. Accurate prediction is
also complicated by the fact that the V3-C4 region of
the envelope gene, which has the greatest influence on
tropism, also has a relatively high rate of diversity
although the V3 region itself does contain conserved
segments [60]. This complicates the interpretation of
sequences, especially when so-called bulk sequencing is
employed. This method captures only the most prevalent sequence (>25% of the total quasispecies), and the
results become difficult to interpret when many genetic
variants are present simultaneously. However, continuous progress is being made, especially with the application of next generation sequencing [61].
Clinical trials with CCR5 antagonists have indicated
that patients with detectable CXCR4-using virus are
unlikely to show a significant decrease in viral load in
response to CCR5 antagonists [62,63]. Therefore, prior
to initiating treatment with CCR5 inhibitors, patients
are now screened to exclude those who harbor CXCR4using variants. Both phenotypic and genotypic assays
have been developed for this screening, but the Monogram Trofile assay is currently the only clinically validated test and has been used to screen the largest
number of patients [10,64]. As more combined V3 genotype-phenotype data become available, genotypic predictors of coreceptor usage are likely to become a viable
alternative to phenotypic assays. Indeed, recent data
from the HOMER cohort and the MOTIVATE and
MERIT trials show that genotype-based methods performed on populations-based samples, or “bulk”
sequence data, are equivalent to the Trofile assay and
that deep sequencing can actually improve the phenotypic results [65,66].

Coreceptor usage in primary HIV-1 infection
Coreceptor usage and HIV-1 transmission

Despite an extensive literature on the subject, the process of in vivo transmission of HIV-1 remains largely
unknown and most of the current models are essentially
conjectural. In fact, there are virtually insurmountable
difficulties in studying the earliest events of HIV-1 infection in the human species, while nonhuman primate
models, albeit useful, provide only a partial and, in all
likelihood, non-physiological picture. In fact, most of
the observations on the acute phase of HIV-1 infection
in humans are made several weeks or even months after
the initial transmission event, typically in subjects who
manifest clinical signs of acute retroviral syndrome.
With this caveat in mind, the bulk of evidence indicates

Page 4 of 17

that R5 HIV-1 variants are largely prevalent during the
acute phase of infection [67,68]. Even if both R5 and
CXCR4-using variants are present in the donor, most
often only the R5 variants are detected in the recipient
[69-71]. Whether this early R5 predominance reflects a
bona fide transmission bias or a superior in vivo fitness
of R5 strains during the early phase of infection remains
uncertain.
Several studies have attempted to correlate the predominance of R5 HIV-1 strains during the acute phase
with a biological bottleneck inherent to the genital
mucosa, variously related to trapping and inactivation of
CXCR4-using virus by mucin and innate antiviral proteins, preferential transcytosis of R5 viruses in endothelial cells and/or preferential amplification of R5 viruses
by resident macrophages, dendritic cells and/or Langerhans cells (reviewed in [72]. In reality, however, no conclusive evidence has been provided to indicate that
CXCR4-using strains are less able or unable to sustain
mucosal transmission. For example simian/human chimeric immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV) bearing an X4
HIV-1 envelope can be readily transmitted via the
mucosal route in macaques, and have widely been used
as a reference model [73].
Another important element that is rarely taken into
consideration in the HIV-1 transmission equation is the
transmitter bias, due to the fact that people with replicating CXCR4- using viruses may be in a more
advanced stage of their disease and less prone to engage
in risky sexual behavior [74]. If a majority of transmissions occur from asymptomatic individuals who at that
time still only harbor R5 variants, then this would
indeed contribute to the scarcity of transmission of
CXCR4-using variants.
Post-transmission events

Another potential contributing factor in the marked R5variant predominance during acute primary HIV-1
infection is a post-transmission amplification bias. In
peripheral blood, the high proportion of CCR5+CD4+ T
cells that are recruited during acute HIV- 1 infection
may favor R5 variants to replicate and thereby outcompete putative co-transmitted CXCR4-using variants.
Moreover, the high proportion of memory/activated
CCR5+CD4+ T cells present in the mucosal-associated
lymphoid tissue, which is considered a major site of
HIV-1 replication during primary infection [75], may
provide the optimal environment for preferential R5
HIV-1 amplification. Of importance, these cells also
express high levels of integrin a4b7, an important facilitator of HIV-1 infection [76].
Although primary infection with CXCR4-using HIV-1
strains is believed to be a rare event, mixed R5/X4 primary infections have been clearly documented in a few

Schuitemaker et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 9(Suppl 1):S5
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/S1/S5

patients studied longitudinally from an early stage postinfection [77,78]; interestingly, however, the CXCR4using component was selectively cleared from plasma
with the transition to the chronic phase in which only
R5 variants could be recovered, raising the possibility
that mixed R5/X4 transmission may in fact be more frequent than it appears, albeit underestimated due to late
sampling, subsequent to the disappearance of the
CXCR4-using component from plasma. In a recent retrospective evaluation of a large number of patients (n =
390) enrolled in the PRIMO cohort in France between
1996 and 2007, a relatively high prevalence (15.9%) of
predicted CXCR4-using viruses was documented during
primary infection [79]. However, subsequent phenotypic
analysis of the patients in this study infected with nonsubtype B variants (n=131) showed that genotypic predictions overestimated the proportion of CXCR4-using
variants in non-subtype B infected patients, resulting in
a much lower prevalence (0.8%) of actual CXCR4-using
variants [80]. In agreement, a low prevalence of CXCR4using viruses (4-6%) was observed in three recent
cohorts of seroconverters: one from the United States
(n=150) during the period 1999-2003 [81], one from
France (n=133) during the period 1995-2008 [82], and
one from the Netherlands (n=46) during the period
2003-2008 (ABW et al., unpublished observations).
Moreover, detailed investigations of individuals
experiencing primary infection and sampled prior to seroconversion (Fiebig stage I-V) using single genome
amplification have revealed a consistent pattern of
CCR5 dependence at this stage [67,68,83-88] indicating
that any putative post-transmission amplification bias
would have to occur within the first few days of
exposure.
Protective effect of congenital CCR5 deficiencies

The most convincing argument in favor of the bona fide
predominance of R5 variants in the initial transmission
events is the high degree of protection from HIV-1
infection conferred by genetic deficiency of CCR5. Subjects that are homozygotes for the CCR5-Δ32 allele are
highly protected from HIV-1 infection [89]. Indeed, this
genotype is enriched among individuals who remain seronegative despite high-risk sexual behavior [90,91] as
well among hemophiliacs who had remained HIV negative despite exposure to batches of clotting factor that
were known to be the cause of HIV infection in other
hemophiliacs [92]. CCR5wt/Δ32 heterozygosity does not
confer protection from HIV-1 infection, but this genotype has been associated with a significantly lower viral
set point and delayed disease progression [93-96]. A second crippling polymorphism, m303, that introduces a
premature stop codon in the CCR5 gene has been identified in exposed-uninfected subjects [97].

Page 5 of 17

Despite the strong protective effect conferred by congenital CCR5 deficiencies, a handful of infected CCR5-Δ32
homozygotes have been reported, all invariably harboring
CXCR4- dependent HIV-1 strains [98]. Interestingly, two
CCR5-Δ32+/+ individuals were found to harbor an inherently (not mixed) dual-tropic virus (R5X4) that remained
stable over time [99], suggesting that maintenance of the
CCR5-using envelope conformation might provide a
selective advantage in vivo despite the absence of a usable
receptor. Although the viral load in infected CCR5-Δ32
+/+
subjects tends to be low, a rapid depletion of circulating CD4+ T cells has been noted [98]. However, the very
limited number of individuals characterized thus far
makes it difficult to evaluate whether the clinical and
virological course of an X4 HIV-1 infection d’emblée
differs from that of conventional R5 HIV-1 infection in
individuals with wild-type CCR5 genes. In this respect,
viral variants with X4/DM phenotype have been detected
in individual case reports of acute HIV-1 infections with
peculiarly severe clinical manifestations [100-103], but
again their number is too limited to draw any reliable
conclusions and it is difficult to exclude other confounding cofactors.
Role of minor coreceptors

Usage of the so-called “minor” coreceptors during primary HIV-1 infection has only marginally been investigated. Interestingly, a high frequency of CCR3 usage
during primary infection has been detected by direct
cloning and expression of viral sequences, while in vitro
culture apparently selects against CCR3 usage leading to
the expansion of variants with exclusive CCR5 usage
[104]. By contrast, in a few cases of primary infection
with subtype- C HIV-1 studied, all of R5 phenotype,
there was a surprisingly high frequency of usage of
GPR15, APJ and CXCR6, but not of CCR3 [105,106].
Further studies are warranted to address the relevance
of minor coreceptors in HIV-1 transmission.

Coreceptor usage in chronic HIV-1 infection
In vivo evolution of HIV-1 coreceptor usage

During the asymptomatic phase of HIV-1 infection a
homogeneous R5 virus population is commonly present
that generally has the ability to replicate efficiently in
both T cells and macrophages [70,71]. In many patients,
a typical pattern of viral evolution has been documented
during the course of the infection with the emergence,
usually in concomitance with the earliest signs of disease
progression, of CXCR4-using variants. However, this
pattern is not consistently observed in all patients progressing to AIDS (Figure 2). For example, in patients
infected with subtype-B HIV-1, variants that use CXCR4
can be isolated from approximately half of the patients
who have developed AIDS [15,24,33,106-109]. Of note,

Time
Figure 2 Evolution of HIV-1 coreceptor usage during the progression of the disease. In most individuals HIV-1 infection is initially
sustained by CCR5-using variants (R5, blue). In ~50% of the patients infected with subtype-B HIV-1, the CCR5-using variants acquire the ability to
use CXCR4 (R5X4, blue/red) prior to AIDS diagnosis. Subsequently, these dual-tropic R5X4 variants may lose their ability to use CCR5 (X4 variants,
red). Over time, viral coreceptor usage evolves resulting in viral variants with increased affinity for their respective coreceptor (increased color
intensity).

such variants may first appear during the asymptomatic
phase of infection, before AIDS is diagnosed [106], albeit
after an initial decline of CD4 + T cells [110]. Patients
progressing to AIDS often harbor viral populations that
can use multiple coreceptors including CCR5, CXCR4
and one or more minor coreceptors [15]. Whether a
promiscuous coreceptor usage provides a selective
advantage for HIV remains uncertain since most of the
minor coreceptors show a low and/or tissue-specific
expression pattern.
Until recently, the general consensus was that
CXCR4-using variants only emerge in a certain proportion of HIV-1 infected individuals, which varies
according to the viral genetic subtype. However, recent
evidence has challenged this view suggesting that the
prevalence of CXCR4 usage is continuously evolving
over time. Data from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies
on HIV infection and AIDS (ACS) show a continuously ongoing X4 conversion rate at the population
level, even after AIDS diagnosis (H.S. et al., unpublished results). Thus, it seems that the emergence of

CXCR4 usage is a matter of time and that some HIV-1
infected individuals die before they develop CXCR4using variants. Molecular cloning of the viral quasispecies has documented the frequent presence of DNA
sequences predictive of CXCR4 usage in blood cells
even in the absence of detectable replication of such
variants, as well as transient appearances of CXCR4using strains on a background of sustained R5
persistence [50,111,112]. These observations further
challenge the simplistic concept of a single and irreversible coreceptor- switching event, depicting a complex
dynamic state where variant predominance is a continuously evolving process governed by multiple interactive factors. After the appearance of CXCR4-using
variants, R5 variants remain present in the vast majority of patients [108,113]. Pure X4 virus populations are
rather infrequently detected and often restricted to
late-stage disease [114], although they have been
documented earlier in rare cases of ab initio X4 transmission [70,115,116] often associated with the absence
of CCR5 expression in the host [98].

Origin of CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants

Several lines of evidence suggest that CXCR4-using
variants evolve in vivo from pre-existing R5 variants.
Phylogenetic analysis of longitudinally obtained HIV-1
variants from individual patients has shown that
although R5 and X4 variants from a single patient
form separate monophyletic clusters in an unrooted
tree, they do cluster together when an appropriate outgroup is used. Although this implies that R5 and
CXCR4-using variants from a single individual are
more related to each other than to HIV-1 variants
from another person, it does not exclude that both
variants may be initially transmitted together and then
differentially expressed in vivo, with CXCR4-using variants maintained in a cryptic condition until immune
deterioration occurs. However, the first detectable
CXCR4-using variants are more closely related to the
R5 variants obtained at the same time than co-existing
R5 and CXCR4-using variants derived at later time
points. Moreover, recently emerged CXCR4-using variants generally maintain the ability to use CCR5 and in
phylogenetic trees these dual-tropic R5X4 populations
cluster between pure R5 and later-stage CXCR4-using
virus populations derived from the same individual.
These observations are compatible with the hypothesis
that the first CXCR4-using variants evolve from preexisting R5 variants within the same individual, rather
than remaining silent for many years after an initial
independent transmission.

Clinical significance of CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants: cause
or consequence of immune deterioration?

The emergence of CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants in a
patient is almost invariably associated with a subsequent
increase in the rate of decline of circulating CD4 + T
cells, an accelerated disease progression, and a poor
prognosis for survival [106] (Figure 3). Indeed, studies
in the era preceding the introduction of combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART) demonstrated a significant
acceleration in the rate of CD4+ T-cell decline after the
first detection of CXCR4-using variants [106,107]. However, the presence of CXCR4-using variants is not an
obligatory prerequisite for disease progression and a significant proportion of individuals progress to AIDS and
AIDS-related death while harboring exclusively R5 HIV1 variants. Notably, the time from seroconversion to
AIDS is not significantly different between individuals
who harbor only R5 variants as compared to individuals
with detectable CXCR4-using variants (Figure 4).
The accelerated CD4 + T-cell decline after the first
appearance of CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants seems to be
determined by the greater proportion of CD4+ T cells
that express CXCR4, which provides a larger target-cell
pool for the virus. Indeed, up to 90% of CD4+ T cells
express CXCR4 whereas CCR5 expression is restricted
to a smaller subset (15-35%) that express a memory/
activated phenotype [117-119]. Specifically, CXCR4, but
not CCR5, is expressed on naïve CD4+ T cells [118], a
large population of non-antigen-primed T cells. Thus,

Figure 4 Time between seroconversion (SC) and AIDS among participants in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and
AIDS with or without CXCR4-using variants detected prior to AIDS diagnosis. All homosexual and drug-user participants with AIDS
diagnosis according to the 1993 CDC definition prior to initiation of effective antiretroviral therapy were included in the analysis. Participants
were divided into 2 groups based on the presence (X4, closed circles) or absence (R5, open circles) of CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants as detected by
the MT-2 assay prior to AIDS diagnosis. Time between SC and AIDS was categorized in 12-monthly intervals. The graph shows the proportion of
participants per category as a percentage of the total number of participants in the group.

naïve CD4+ T cells are exclusively a target for CXCR4using variants [120]. The pathological consequences of
infection of naïve CD4+ T cells may be dramatic, resulting in the depletion of the largest pool of CD4+ T cells
in the body. Considering the potential beneficial effect
of an expanded target-cell population, it is puzzling that
CXCR4-using variants emerge in only a proportion of
infected individuals [106] even though a limited number
of amino acid substitutions in V3 is sufficient to confer
CXCR4-using capability to R5 variants [38,121].
It has been hypothesized that the absence of CXCR4using variants early in HIV-1 infection may be due to
their higher vulnerability to the host adaptive immune
responses, in particular neutralizing antibodies. The fact
that these variants appear more frequently after the
initial decline of CD4+ T cells indeed suggests that they
may represent a peculiar, congenic form of opportunistic infection. In a recent study, we found that the first

appearing CXCR4-using variants are more sensitive to
neutralizing antibodies directed against the CD4 binding
site than their co-existing R5 variants [122]. A greater
sensitivity to both monoclonal antibodies and sera from
infected patients was also documented in sequential isolates derived from a cohort of perinatally-infected children (P.L. et al., unpublished data). Further evidence for
a greater sensitivity of CXCR4-using variants to antibody-mediated neutralization has come from the characterization of a conserved neutralization epitope within
the V3 domain of gp120: such epitope, designated D19,
is invariably cryptic in R5 variants of different genetic
subtypes, but it is consistently exposed in CXCR4-using
variants, rendering such variants sensitive to neutralization by a specific antibody [123]. A role of cell-mediated
immune responses was instead suggested by the reemergence of CXCR4-using strains in dually-infected
(R5+X4 SHIV) macaques after in vivo depletion of CD8+

Schuitemaker et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 9(Suppl 1):S5
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/S1/S5

T cells [124]. Additional data pointing to a lower in vivo
fitness of CXCR4-using variants have come from the
results of clinical trials with the CCR5- antagonist maraviroc (MVC). Resistance to MVC was shown to develop
by two mechanisms: a reduced drug susceptibility associated with changes in the V3 loop that allow the R5 virus
to use CCR5 in its MVC-bound conformation [125] or the
emergence of variants that use CXCR4 [58]. In the latter
scenario, the CXCR4-using virus seems to originate from
an unrecognized pretreatment reservoir, indicating that
screening assay sensitivity remains to be improved. Interestingly, however, the circulating virus was shown to revert
to the R5 phenotype following cessation of MVC, indicating that the selective pressure acting against CXCR4 usage
was preserved.
Altogether, the above observations suggest that effective host immune responses may exert a selective pressure that hinders the emergence of CXCR4-using
variants. However, when the host immune competence
begins to fade during the progression of HIV-1 disease,
such pressure would start to wane, paving the way for
the emergence of CXCR4-using variants. Although the
host immune surveillance may explain, at least in part,
the absence of CXCR4- using variants during the
asymptomatic phase of HIV-1 infection, it cannot justify
the apparent scarcity of CXCR4-using variants in the
very early phase of infection when neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes are still absent. As
discussed above, this may result from a lack of transmission or to the inability of recently transmitted CXCR4using virus to compete with co-existing R5 HIV-1
during the earliest phase of infection.
R5 HIV-1 evolution in AIDS_progressors without
coreceptor switch

As stated above, a significant fraction of patients progresses to full-blown AIDS without experiencing an
overt switch to CXCR4 usage. However, accumulating
evidence indicates that in spite of their ‘’monogamous’’
CCR5 use late isolates from these patients are inherently
more pathogenic [126] and RANTES-resistant than early
isolates [127,128]. In line with these observation is the
ability of late-stage CCR5-restricted HIV-1 variants to
use chimeric coreceptors in which parts of CCR5 have
been replaced with segments of CXCR4 (R5 broad),
whilst early CCR5-using HIV-1 variants are restricted to
the use of wild-type CCR5 (R5 narrow) [127,129,130].
This in vivo evolution of CCR5-restricted HIV-1 in
humans is similar to that observed in nonhuman primates infected with SIV, which never acquires CXCR4
usage even though its pathogenicity increases during the
late disease stages [131]. Moreover, we have observed
that the ability of R5 isolates to replicate in macrophages is progressively reduced during the course of

Page 9 of 17

infection, resulting in a predominantly T-cell tropic R5
HIV-1 quasispecies even before the progression to AIDS
[108]. In about half of subtype-B HIV-1 infected individuals, this shift towards full T-cell tropism precedes the
emergence of CXCR4 using HIV-1 variants.
R5X4 HIV-1 variants as an intermediate
evolutionary stage

Evidence suggests that the evolutionary changes in the
V3 loop involved in the coreceptor-usage switch are gradual and accretive, and that dual coreceptor usage
(R5X4) represents an intermediate transitional phase.
R5X4 viruses can be more efficient in using either CCR5
(dual-R) or CXCR4 (dual-X), or can use both coreceptors
with similar efficiency [5-7]. As mentioned above, there
is a continued evolution in viral coreceptor usage in vivo,
resulting in a broad range of coreceptor affinities within
the HIV-1 quasispecies. The limited number of amino
acid substitutions required to confer CXCR4-using capability to R5 variants in vitro [38,121], combined with the
high mutation rate of HIV-1 and the larger population of
target cells expressing CXCR4, would predict an early
and nearly universal emergence of CXCR4-using variants
during chronic infection. However, the fact that CXCR4using variants seem to develop successfully only once
during HIV-1 infection [112,132], the scarcity of R5 virus
variants with intermediate genotypes, and the fact that
the newly emerged CXCR4-using variants differ from
coexisting R5 variants by more than the minimally
required number of amino acid mutations [133] altogether suggest that the virus evolves to the CXCR4-using
phenotype through less-fit intermediate stages. The late
emergence of CXCR4- using variants might be explained
by an inability of these intermediate variants to compete
with the well-established R5 virus population in spite of
their broader cellular host range. Once established, however, R5X4 viruses may have developed the optimal fitness to predominate during the transition phase [134],
although they may eventually be outcompeted by HIV-1
variants with a pure X4 phenotype.
Evolution of co-existing R5 and CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants

The progressive divergence between co-existing R5 and
CXCR4-using clones in phylogenetic trees reflects the
continuous evolution of the variable loops of gp120 following the acquisition of CXCR4 usage. This implies that
the structure of gp120 continues to evolve to optimize its
interaction with the coreceptors. This evolution is
accompanied by improved coreceptor-binding affinity,
which in turn is reflected in a decreasing sensitivity of R5
variants to inhibition by CCR5-binding chemokines and
small- molecule CCR5 antagonists [127,128,135,136], as
well as of CXCR4-using variants to SDF-1 and the
synthetic antagonist AMD3100 [137].

Schuitemaker et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2010, 9(Suppl 1):S5
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/9/S1/S5

Once established, CXCR4-using variants are likely to
be more replication competent than R5 variants, given
the broader target-cell range and the generally higher
replication kinetics of CXCR4-using HIV-1 in vitro
[132,138,139]. In light of these considerations, it seems
paradoxical that R5 variants persist and may even
expand in vivo after the emergence of CXCR4- using
HIV-1 [113]. The most likely explanation for the
observed coexistence of R5 and CXCR4- using variants
is their distinct target cell range within an infected
patient [120,140,141]. R5 variants seem to reside mainly
in activated/memory CD45RO + CD4 + T cells, which
express CCR5, whereas CXCR4-using variants reside in
both CD45RA+ and CD45RO+CD4+ T cells [120]. Interestingly, evidence for frequent recombination events
between co-existing R5 and CXCR4-using variants has
been reported [142,143]. While phylogenetic trees based
on envelope sequences show a clear-cut separation of
coexisting R5 and CXCR4-using virus variants, this
separation is not observed when the phylogenetic tree is
based on gag sequences. Apparently, R5 and CXCR4using variants can co-infect cells that express both coreceptors, thus allowing for the recombination of their
genetic material.
Interestingly, the distribution of R5 and CXCR4-using
variants in different blood compartments may vary. Two
recent studies reported a higher prevalence of predicted
CXCR4-using envelopes in PBMC than in plasma
[144,145], although a third study could not confirm this
discrepancy [146]. Differences in the sensitivity of the
coreceptor usage predictors used may be responsible for
the different study outcomes. Thus, the relevance of the
choice of patient material for the determination of HIV1 coreceptor usage remains to be established.

Evolutionary dynamics of coreceptor usage in
different HIV-1 subtype epidemics
The different prevalence of CXCR4-using variants among
different HIV-1 genetic subtypes remains puzzling. As
CXCR4-using variants emerge after an accumulation of
mutations, the different prevalence observed among different subtypes and CRFs may reflect the same phenomenon at the population level [147], although a direct
relationship between evolutionary rate and development
of CXCR4 usage has not been specifically investigated.
Based on a series of recent observations, however, it is
tempting to speculate that the prevalence of CXCR4using HIV-1 is increasing with the age of the subtype
epidemics (Figure 5). Indeed, phylogenetic studies have
revealed that the subtype-D epidemic, which has the
highest prevalence of CXCR4- using variants, is one of
the oldest, while the subtype-C epidemic, which has a
much lower prevalence of CXCR4-using variants, is considered one of the most recently emerged [148,149]

Page 10 of 17

(UNAIDS). The subtype-B HIV-1 epidemic has an intermediate pattern, both in terms of age and prevalence of
CXCR4-using HIV-1 [150]. This assumption is highly
speculative and not supported by all the data available at
present. However, if confirmed, it would imply that all
the subtype epidemics are evolving towards a higher prevalence of CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants although it is
conceivable that each epidemic might reach a point of
equilibrium beyond which such prevalence will not
further increase.

HIV-1 coreceptor usage and antiretroviral therapy
Early studies of zidovudine monotherapy showed that
the beneficial effect was mainly limited to persons who
do not develop CXCR4-using variants [151,152]. Moreover, a trend towards increased emergence of CXCR4using variants under zidovudine therapy was observed
[151]. Further studies confirmed a differential efficacy of
certain HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors against R5
and CXCR4-using viruses, with zidovudine showing a
higher efficacy against R5 viruses and didanosine against
CXCR4-using viruses [153,154]. This could be explained
by the differential efficiency of activation of zidovudine
and didanosine in CCR5-expressing activated memory
T cells and CXCR4-expressing naive and resting memory
T cells. Drugs that are activated equally in both types of
target cells, such as lamivudine, or that did not require
activation, such as the protease inhibitor (PI) ritonavir,
showed equal activity against both variants [154,155].
Although several studies have reported differential
responses to single-agent ART according to coreceptor
usage of the HIV-1 variant present in the patient, the
association between clinical efficacy of currently used
cART regimens and coreceptor usage has not been rigorously evaluated. In 80-90% of asymptomatic treatment-naïve patients, only R5 virus is found [156-159],
whereas recent cross-sectional studies demonstrated
CXCR4-using virus in 40-55% of patients with previous
antiretroviral exposure [114,159-161] , probably reflecting the generally lower CD4 counts in individuals who
are eligible for initiating cART [162].
Once patients are started on cART, both increased
and decreased frequencies of CXCR4- using viruses
have been reported [23,163-167], but neither seems to
predict treatment success [168]. In patients experiencing
virological failure under ART, HIV-1 tropism shifts in
either direction (R5>X4 or X4>R5) have been reported
in 13.2%–28.6% of subjects [162,169]. For suppressive
cART, an early study reported rates of tropism shifts as
high as 37.5% [167], but most recent evidence suggests
that HIV-1 tropism shifts under suppressive ART are
rare (3- 11%) [146,170].
While initial data from the HOMER cohort showed
that baseline sequences predictive of CXCR4 usage were

Age of the epidemic
Figure 5 Hypothetical model of the evolutionary dynamics of CXCR4 usage in relation to the age of each HIV-1 subtype epidemic.
Recent data suggest that the proportion of patients with detectable emergence of CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants varies in relation to the age of
the different subtype epidemics, with subtype D (high CXCR4 switch rate) being the oldest and subtype C (low CXCR4 switch rate) the
youngest.

associated with increased risk of clinical progression
during cART [171], the presence of CXCR4-using variants at baseline was not predictive of survival or treatment response after adjusting for other baseline
parameters [172,173]. Instead, it was significantly associated with lower CD4 counts regardless of antiretroviral
treatment exposure. Similar results were recently
obtained both in a UK cohort [174] and in a Dutch
cohort (ABW et al, unpublished results). It is still
unclear whether the effectiveness of different regimens
(e.g. PI containing or not) varies according to the coreceptor usage of the HIV-1 variants harbored by the
patient at baseline.

Conclusion
The identification of two major HIV-1 coreceptors,
CCR5 and CXCR4, the finding of their differential
expression on various HIV-1 target cells, and the discovery of viral variants with differential ability to use them
have significantly advanced our understanding of the
clinical course of HIV-1 infection and the efficacy of

antiviral therapy. The establishment of a connection
between HIV-1 and the chemokine system has resulted
in the development of a new drug class that directly
interferes with CCR5 usage by HIV-1. These drugs not
only increase the range of therapeutic options for the
systemic treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals, but
can also be employed as topical microbicides to prevent
HIV-1 acquisition at the mucosal level. Despite these
extraordinary successes, many questions regarding the
clinical significance of HIV-1 coreceptor usage remain
unanswered. Finding an answer to these questions may
pave the way toward a deeper understanding of AIDS
pathogenesis and a more effective control of the HIV-1
epidemics worldwide.
