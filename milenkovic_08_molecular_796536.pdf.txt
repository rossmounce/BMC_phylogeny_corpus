Abstract
Background: Mutations in human bestrophin 1 are associated with at least three autosomaldominant macular dystrophies including Best disease, adult onset vitelliform macular dystrophy and
autosomal dominant vitreo-retinochoroidopathy. The protein is integral to the membrane and is
likely involved in Ca2+-dependent transport of chloride ions across cellular membranes. Bestrophin
1 together with its three homologues forms a phylogenetically highly conserved family of proteins.
Results: A bioinformatics study was performed to investigate the phylogenetic relationship among
the bestrophin family members and to statistically evaluate sequence conservation and functional
divergence. Phylogenetic tree assembly with all available eukaryotic bestrophin sequences suggests
gene duplication events in the lineage leading to the vertebrates. A common N-terminal topology
which includes four highly conserved transmembrane domains is shared by the members of the four
paralogous groups of vertebrate bestrophins and has been constrained by purifying selection.
Pairwise comparison shows that altered functional constraints have occurred at specific amino acid
positions after phylogenetic diversification of the paralogues. Most notably, significant functional
divergence was found between bestrophin 4 and the other family members, as well as between
bestrophin 2 and bestrophin 3. Site-specific profiles were established by posterior probability
analysis revealing significantly divergent clusters mainly in two hydrophilic loops and a region
immediately adjacent to the last predicted transmembrane domain. Strikingly, codons 279 and 347
of human bestrophin 4 reveal high divergence when compared to the paralogous positions strongly
indicating the functional importance of these residues for the bestrophin 4 protein. None of the
functionally divergent amino acids were found to reside within obvious sequences patterns or
motifs.
Conclusion: Our study highlights the molecular evolution of the bestrophin family of
transmembrane proteins and indicates amino acid residues likely relevant for distinct functional
properties of the paralogues. These findings may provide a starting point for further experimental
verifications.

Background
The bestrophins are a phylogenetically conserved family
of integral membrane proteins initially identified in
Caenorhabditis elegans [1]. Homologous sequences are
found in animals, fungi, and prokaryotes, but not in protozoans or plants [2]. Conservation is mainly restricted to
the N-terminal 350–400 amino acids with an invariant
motif arginine-phenylalanine-proline (RFP) of unknown
functional properties.
The first human bestrophin cloned, bestrophin 1, is
encoded by the vitelliforme macular dystrophy type 2
(VMD2) gene on chromosome 11q13 and was shown to
be associated with Best macular dystrophy (BMD, OMIM
#153700) also known as Best disease [3,4]. Subsequently,
mutations in this gene were also found to cause adult
onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD, OMIM
#608161) and autosomal dominant vitreo-retinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC, OMIM #193220). The currently
known 106 disease-causing mutations [5] are associated
with a dominant pattern of inheritance with the majority
being missense mutations located in four clusters near the
RFP motif and the predicted transmembrane domains
(TMDs) [6].
Based on immunocytochemical studies in macaque, porcine and human eyes, bestrophin 1 was shown to localize
to the basolateral plasma membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [7,8]. In addition, bestrophin 1 is
broadly expressed in other epithelia including the intestine and the lung [9], whereas bestrophin 2 expression
appears confined to the olfactory epithelium [10]. On the
functional level, whole cell patch clamp experiments suggest that the bestrophins act as Ca2+-dependent transporters of chloride ions across epithelial borders [11-16].
Functional proteins likely exist as multimeric complexes
eventually by forming homo- or heteromeric associations
between bestrophin family members.
Uncertainty exists as to the specific function of bestrophin
1. As an alternative to its activity as a chloride channel,
bestrophin 1 may act as an accessory protein in the regulation of voltage-gated calcium channels [17]. In addition,
bestrophin 1 could be involved in the volume sensitivity
of RPE cells during phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer
segments [11]. Consequently, distinct functional aspects
of bestrophin 1 may contribute to RPE dysfunction and
thus may explain the variable phenotypes associated with
a mutant protein.
Phylogenetic studies of protein families can be a valuable
tool to determine conserved but also divergent regions,
potentially leading to functional predictions [18]. In this
study we elucidated the evolutionary history of the
bestrophins and identified structural and putative func-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/72

tional motifs of the bestrophin protein family by a comprehensive bioinformatics/phylogenetic approach. This
has led us to predict distinct amino acid residues that may
be of importance in the functional divergence of the
bestrophin paralogues.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis of the bestrophin family
We first retrieved the available bestrophin sequences from
the currently sequenced genomes. Querying major databases and unfinished genomes with the full-length amino
acid sequences from the four human bestrophin paralogues identified 173 homologous proteins in vertebrates
(mammals, birds, amphibians and fishes), urochordates
(sea squirt), and invertebrates (insects, nematodes) (see
Additional file 1). While C. elegans reveals a large number
of bestrophins (n = 26), most other organisms harbour
three or four family members. In each of the recently
sequenced genomes of the urochordata Ciona inestinalis
and Ciona savigny, the closest relatives of the craniates, we
identified only a single bestrophin sequence strongly suggesting that gene duplication events may have occurred in
the lineage leading to the vertebrates.

Our further study focused on vertebrate bestrophins. After
exclusion of unfinished and partial protein sequences, a
phylogenetic tree with 53 selected bestrophins (Table 1)
was constructed by the neighbour-joining (NJ) method
based on a gamma corrected Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT)
distance matrix [19,20] (Figure 1). Accordingly, the vertebrate bestrophins can unambiguously be separated into
distinct clusters. With the urochordata as outgroup, the
vertebrate bestrophins form four separate monophyletic
groups, all with high bootstrap support indicating that the
formation of the paralogous subfamilies occurred before
the divergence of individual species (Figure 1). The phylogenetic branches of bestrophins 1 and 3 separated considerably earlier in evolution than bestrophin subgroups
2 and 4, partially explaining the level of sequence conservation between each of the two subfamilies. The high level
of sequence identity within a subfamily suggests evolutionarily conserved functions. Overall, the data indicate
that the bestrophin subfamilies have evolved by gene
duplication events, in good agreement with previous findings demonstrating that large-scale gene duplications
have occurred during chordate evolution [21,22].
N-terminal topology of the vertebrate bestrophins
We next analyzed whether the strong sequence conservation between the N-terminal regions of the vertebrate
bestrophins also predicts a common topology. Putative
transmembrane domains and hydrophobic regions were
modelled in silico (Figure 2). Hydropathy plotting of 53
bestrophins (orthologues and paralogues, Table 1)
revealed six hydrophobic regions including four putative

Phylogenetic tree of 53 homologues of vertebrate
bestrophins. The phylogenetic tree of the bestrophin protein family was inferred by the neighbor-joining method (NJ)
method applying gamma corrected distances. Urochordata

out-group. The support for each phylogenetic group was
tested with 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. Protein

transmembrane domains with hydropathy values reaching or above the threshold of 1.6 (Figure 2). These four
hydrophobic peaks are strongly conserved in the vertebrate bestrophins suggesting membrane insertion of all
bestrophin family members similar to bestrophin 1 [23].
Variable selective pressures among amino acid sites
To analyze positive or negative selection of specific amino
acid regions within the full-length protein sequences of
mammalian bestrophins, substitution rate ratios of nonsynonymous (dN) versus synonymous (dS) mutations
(dN/dS or ω) were calculated for vertebrate bestrophins as
given in Table 1. A dN/dS value <1 is indicative of purifying selection acting against amino acid changes, whereas
dN/dS values >1 indicate an excess of amino acid changes
suggesting adaptive evolution [24,25]. Amino acids in a
protein sequence are expected to be under different selective pressure and to have different underlying dN/dS
ratios. Table 2 shows that the ratio values for the vertebrate bestrophins are substantially lower than 1 suggesting that the N-termini of mammalian bestrophins within
each subgroup were under strong purifying selection pressure. In order to test for positive selection at individual
amino acid codons, the site-specific models implemented
in codeml were used. Likelihood rate tests (LRTs) were

performed between model M0 (one ratio) and M3 (discrete), M1a (nearly neutral) and M2a (positive selection),
and M7 (beta) and M8 (beta and ω) (Table 2). The selection model (M2a) does not suggest presence of positively
selected sites (P = 1). M0 was rejected when compared to
M3 (P < 0.001), although no positively selected sites were
detected. This could be explained by the fact that the
majority of the protein is subjected to constant purifying
selection, while a few sites undergo positive selection
[26]. From the three models which allow for selection to
be tested (M2a, M3 and M8), only M8 was significantly
favoured over M7 (P < 0.001) and detected 44 sites at the
95% level (Table 2). This provides evidence for the Darwinian selection in vertebrate bestrophins.
Analysis of functional divergence
To further investigate whether amino acid substitutions in
the highly conserved N-termini of the bestrophins could
have caused adaptive functional diversification, amino
acid residues 1–367 from 53 vertebrate bestrophins
(Table 1) were used for posterior analysis by the DIVERGE
program algorithms [27,28]. Pairwise comparisons of paralogous bestrophins from subfamilies 1 to 4 were carried
out and the rate of amino acid evolution at each sequence
position was estimated. This identified residues potentially responsible for functional divergence. The results are
given as a coefficient of functional divergence (θ) with
standard errors and significance levels (Table 3). Signifi-

cant functional divergence was detected between
bestrophin 2 and 3 (Pcorr = 6.3 × 10-9) as well as between
bestrophin 4 and the other bestrophin subgroups (Pcorr ≤

Next, single amino acid residues responsible for the functional divergence were predicted based on site-specific
profiles (Figure 3A) in combination with suitable cut-offvalues derived from the posterior probability of each comparison (Table 3). Residues predicted to be functionally
divergent in bestrophin, were mapped onto topology
models of human bestrophins 2 and 4, respectively (Figure 3b). The predicted functional sites are not equally distributed throughout the respective bestrophin, but instead
are clustered in the hydrophilic loops between predicted
transmembrane domains 1 and 2 as well as 5 and 6 and
immediately C-terminal to transmembrane domain 6
(Figure 3B, see Additional file 2, and Table 4). Despite the
high global sequence identity of mammalian bestrophins

2 and 3, functionally divergent amino acids were also
identified between these bestrophins. For example, at
position 264 (numbered according to bestrophin 1) the
tyrosine residue is completely conserved within
bestrophin 1, 2 and 3 paralogues but highly divergent in
bestrophin 4 paralogues. Similarly, residue 331 (numbered according to bestrophin 1) is highly divergent in
bestrophin 1, 2 and 3 paralogues but strictly conserved in
bestrophins 4 (Figure 3B, see Additional file 2, and Table
4). We thus speculate that these two sites may be of functional importance for the respective bestrophin subfamilies. In addition, 11 out of 44 positively selected sites
detected by LRT in codeml were also found to be functionally divergent between bestrophin paralogues (marked by
asterisk in Table 4).
We finally scanned the predicted divergent amino acids
and surrounding sequences in bestrophins 2 and 4 for the
presence of domains and functional sequence patterns

with MotifScan and InterProScan. Identity to known protein motifs, except for several short sequence tags including putative phosphorylation sites, could not be detected.

Discussion
Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the bestrophins
originated by duplication and divergence of a common
protein at the base of the eukaryotic tree, some 700 Myr
ago. Analysis of the bestrophins from a phylogenetic perspective may provide the basis for understanding the functional diversity within this conserved protein family. Both
small-scale and large-scale gene duplications are known
to contribute to the complexity of eukaryotic organisms
[29,30]. The presence of bestrophins in prokaryotes [2]
and their occurrence in phylogenetically distant eukaryotic species such as insects and mammals highlight their
general functional importance.
High levels of sequence homology were generally found
between the N-terminal regions of the bestrophins, while
the C-termini differ substantially particularly between
paralogues. At the N-terminal sequences, vertebrate
bestrophins show nearly identical hydrophobicity plots

with four major and two minor hydrophobic peaks, indicating that they share a highly similar membrane topology [16,23]. The hydrophobic regions with high sequence
conservation also seem to contribute to oligomerization
[15,31] and the second putative transmembrane domain
is thought to be especially important for channel function
[13,14,32].
Our data and the study by Hagen et al. [2] demonstrate
that the vertebrate bestrophins cluster in organismal
groups, i.e. the homologues are more related to each other
from different species than to their species-specific paralogues. Whenever high quality genome sequences are
available (e.g. human, chimp, dog, rat, and fugu), four
bestrophin paralogues can be identified. This strongly
argues for a high phylogenetic conservation of the
bestrophin subfamilies. Missing paralogues in some species may be due to currently incomplete genomic
sequences. One exception may be X. laevis, for which a
high quality genome sequence has already been released
but still this species reveals only three copies of
bestrophins, interestingly all highly similar to bestrophin
2. However, as a tetraploid species, X. laevis appears to

have undergone unique evolutionary changes. Another
exception may be the murine bestrophin 4 (gene name:
VMD2-L2) which our group has previously shown to represent a functionless pseudogene [33].
In the vertebrate phylogeny, bestrophins 1 and 3 have separated and diverged at a higher rate than bestrophins 2
and 4. To estimate the selection forces behind this we calculated the substitution rate ratios for the four subgroups.

terminal amino acid sequences (aa1-367), we could not,
however, find an indication for positive selection. In contrast, the low dN/dS values imply that a strong purifying
selection may lead to the high sequence conservation
observed. Examples such as the chaperonins [24] show
that positive selection reaches dN/dS values well above 1
for a high selective pressure to fix amino acid substitutions
in evolution. Nevertheless, we detected positive selection
at several amino acid sites located predominantly in the
hydrophilic regions of bestrophin. Testing several models

only one (M7vsM8) suggested positively selected sites
with high posterior probabilities. Another comparison
(M0 vs M3), although significant failed to identify positively selected residues with high posterior probability.
This points to insufficient information from the alignments or, alternatively, may be explained by the fact that
purifying selection in conserved regions could have
masked single diversification signals.
Posterior probability analysis for pairwise comparisons of
bestrophin paralogues identified significant functional
divergence between bestrophin 2 and bestrophin 3 as well
as between bestrophin 4 and its remaining paralogues.
Generally, the specific amino acid substitutions in the
bestrophin paralogues suggest an optimization of protein
function, and/or subfunctionalization of the gene duplicates. Eleven out of the 44 positively selected sites were
also found to be functionally divergent between
bestrophins. The most prominent finding of the posterior
probability analysis is that bestrophin 4 diverged significantly during evolution in a number of amino acids from
its paralogues. As shown previously [34], bestrophin 4 can
be activated by free Ca2+ on the cytoplasmic side although
the kinetics of the activation/deactivation is much slower
than for typical Ca2+-activated chloride currents [35]. Furthermore, heterologously expressed human bestrophin 4
shows very slow voltage-dependant current relaxations, in
contrast to the lack of voltage-dependent current relaxations by human bestrophin 1 and 2. These distinctive
properties of bestrophin 4 could be attributable to the
additional 15 unique amino acids within the extracellular
loop between putative transmembrane domain 5 and 6.
This loop contains three positively charged lysine residues
(K266, K269 and K272) within a proline rich region
(P267, P273, P277 and P279). It can be speculated that
the function of the divergent P279 residue could be to
maintain structural or conformational stability of the
loop region.
Human bestrophin 1 and 3 have considerably longer
amino acid sequences compared to bestrophin 2 and 4
(585 and 668 vs 509 and 473 aa). Human and mouse
bestrophin 3, heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells,
produce no chloride currents in a physiological range
[16,36], in contrast for example to mouse bestrophin 2
[13,14]. Such a functional divergence has been explained
to be mediated by an auto-inhibitory (AI) domain composed of seven critical residues 356IPSFLGS362 present in
mouse bestrophin 3 [36]. Interestingly 2 out of 5 amino
acid residues implicated in the functional divergence
between bestrophin 2 and 3 are located in close proximity
to this highly conserved region (Q354 and D366 in
bestrophin 2, respectively).

Conclusion
This study addresses the evolutionary history of the
bestrophin protein family. The precise functional properties of the four family members are still unclear but may
comprise activities as Ca2+-activated chloride channels or
aspects of Ca2+ channel regulation. Functional divergence
between the paralogous bestrophins suggests that the
bestrophin family members have evolved different functional properties after gene duplication events which have
occurred early in the vertebrate lineage. This is most evident for bestrophin 4 where a number of experimental
studies provide further support for the in silico data. Our
study also demonstrates that amino acids critical for functional divergence are located in regions of the proteins
that are likely accessible to soluble ligands, supporting the
biochemical and physiological significance of this prediction.

Methods
Data collection
PSI-BLAST and TBLASTN searches with protein sequences
of the four human bestrophins were performed in protein
databases or unfinished genome sequencing projects at
NCBI [37], ENSEMBL [38], the Sanger Institute [39],
UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group [40], and the Joint
Genome Institute [41]. Proteins identified by the BLAST
search algorithms were considered as potential homologues when amino acid identity was above 25% over a
stretch of = 200 amino acids. After removal of expressed
sequence tags, splice variants and redundant sequences,
the initial data set included 173 distinct sequences from
43 species (see Additional file 1).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction
Amino acid sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL W
(version 1.82) [42] and alignments were refined manually
in Genedoc [43]. Incomplete sequences, and highly divergent regions or gaps resulting in uncertain alignments
were excluded from the analysis. The final data set
includes a total of 53 sequences from 21 vertebrate species
(Table 1). A total of 367 N-terminal amino acids were
aligned for further studies. Accurate nucleotide alignments were obtained with PAL2NAL [44], a program
which constructs multiple codon alignments from matching protein sequences. ProtTest v1.4 [45], implementing
the Akaike Information criterion (AIC) was used to estimate the most appropriate model of amino acid substitution for tree building analyses. The best fit model of
protein evolution for the bestrophin protein family
according to ProtTest corresponds to a JTT+I+G+F model
[19].

Tree reconstructions were done by the Neighbor-joining
method (NJ) [20] from the protein alignment done in the
MEGA v3.1 software package, with the gamma distribu-

tion model implemented to account for heterogeneity
among sites [46], and rooted with the bestrophins from
Urohordata. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution (α) was estimated using baseml from the PAMLv4.0
[47] to be α = 0.51. Support for each phylogenetic group
was tested using 1,000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. Tree
topology assessed by maximum parsimony (using Mega
v3.1), was substantial similar with the NJ tree.
Topological structure prediction
Topological structure prediction was done with the TOPPRED II software [48], which is based on the Kyte and
Doolittle algorithm [49]. The average hydrophobicity values of putative transmembrane domains of 20–23 amino
acid residues were calculated according the Eisenberg
scale [50]. An average hydropathy plot of 53 bestrophinrelated protein sequences was generated by the PEPWINDOWALL program with a window of 19 amino acids [49].
Positive selection assessment
DNA sequences and related multiple protein sequence
alignments were submitted to the PAL2NAL web server
[51] which converts a multiple sequence alignment of proteins and the corresponding DNA sequences into a codon
alignment. The resulting codon alignments and NJ tree
were used in the program codeml from the PAMLv4.0 software package [47] to calculate the dN/dS (or ω) ratio for
each site and to test different evolutionary models. The site
specific models recommended by Anisimova et al. [26]
were tested: Model M0 (one ratio), M1a (nearly neutral),
M2a (positive selection), M3 (discrete), M7 (beta) and M8
(beta+ ω). Model M0 assumed a constant ω-ratio, while in
models M1a and M2a ω-ratio is estimated from the date (0
< ω0 < 1) while ω1 = 1 is fixed. M7 and M8 assume a β-distribution for the ω-value between 0 and 1. Models M2a,
M3, and M8 allow the occurrence of positively selected sites
(ω >1). Subsequent likelihood rate comparisons of M0
with M3, M1a with M2a, and M7 with M8, respectively,
were performed to test which model fits the data significantly better. Twice the difference in log likelihood between
the models is compared with a chi-square distribution with
n degrees of freedom, n being the difference between the
numbers of parameters of the two models.
Functional divergence and detection of amino acids critical
for altered functional constraints
Bestrophin sequence duplication events were tested for
type I functional divergence [52] based on the method by
Gu et al [27]. The analysis was carried out with Diverge
(version 2.0) [28]. This method is based on maximum
likelihood procedures to estimate significant changes in
the rate of evolution after the emergence of two paralogous sequences. Type I sites represent amino acid residues
conserved in one subfamily but highly variable in
another, implying that these residues have been subjected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/72

to different functional constraints. A set of 53 protein
sequences was included in the study (Table 1, see Additional file 2). Due to gaps and a shorter length of
bestrophin 2 and 4, a total of 15 residues from human
bestrophin 4 (codons 264–278) and one (codon 356)
from human bestrophin 2 were excluded from the analysis. Consequently, each bestrophin paralogue was
restricted to 367 amino acid residues. A new NJ tree was
constructed within Diverge with Poisson distance and rerooted. The coefficient of functional divergence (θ) and
the posterior probability for the functional divergence
were calculated for each position in the alignment. To
detect amino acid residues reflecting functional divergence, bestrophin subfamilies were pair-wise compared to
each other. The cut-off value for the posterior probability
was determined by consecutively eliminating the highest
scoring residues from the alignment until the coefficient
of functional divergence dropped to zero.
