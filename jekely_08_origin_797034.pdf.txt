Abstract
Background: The origin of the nucleus is a central problem about the origin of eukaryotes. The
common ancestry of nuclear pore complexes (NPC) and vesicle coating complexes indicates that
the nucleus evolved via the modification of a pre-existing endomembrane system. Such an
autogenous scenario is cell biologically feasible, but it is not clear what were the selective or neutral
mechanisms that had led to the origin of the nuclear compartment.
Results: A key selective force during the autogenous origin of the nucleus could have been the
need to segregate ribosome factories from the cytoplasm where ribosomal proteins (RPs) of the
protomitochondrium were synthesized. After its uptake by an anuclear cell the
protomitochondrium transferred several of its RP genes to the host genome. Alphaproteobacterial
RPs and archaebacterial-type host ribosomes were consequently synthesized in the same
cytoplasm. This could have led to the formation of chimeric ribosomes. I propose that the nucleus
evolved when the host cell compartmentalised its ribosome factories and the tightly linked genome
to reduce ribosome chimerism. This was achieved in successive stages by first evolving karyopherin
and RanGTP dependent chaperoning of RPs, followed by the evolution of a membrane network to
serve as a diffusion barrier, and finally a hydrogel sieve to ensure selective permeability at nuclear
pores. Computer simulations show that a gradual segregation of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm via
these steps can progressively reduce ribosome chimerism.
Conclusion: Ribosome chimerism can provide a direct link between the selective forces for and
the mechanisms of evolving nuclear transport and compartmentalisation. The detailed molecular
scenario presented here provides a solution to the gradual evolution of nuclear
compartmentalization from an anuclear stage.

vesicle coat complexes (including COPI, COPII and clathrin coats) indicates that NPCs and the nuclear envelope
(NE) evolved by the modification of a vesicle-trafficking
system [1,2]. This supports autogenous scenarios for the
origin of the nucleus [3]. These models posit that the NE
evolved by the incomplete fusion of pre-existing secretory
endomembranes around the chromatin of a protoeukaryotic cell [4], and not via endosymbiosis [5].
Unlike e.g. the ER or peroxisomes, the nucleus is not a
topologically separated compartment in the eukaryotic
cytoplasm since the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm are
continuous through the nuclear pores. Yet, the nucleus
has a distinct composition due to the directionality and
selectivity of nuclear transport. This is achieved by the Ran
GTPase cycle, selective cargo binding by karyopherins,
and selective permeability of NPCs [6-8]. The nucleus is
organized around chromatin through the action of the
Ran GTPase system that is universally present in eukaryotes [9,10]. Eukaryotes evolved the Ran system very early
during their evolution to mark the position of chromatin.
The evolution of the Ran system had key importance during the origin of nuclear compartmentalisation given the
universal and fundamental roles of Ran in several aspects
of nuclear function, including nuclear transport [11], NPC
assembly [12], NE assembly [13], kinetochore function
[14] and mitosis [15]. Ran evolved from other membranetrafficking small GTPases that all act as molecular switches
and orchestrate downstream molecular events by binding
to effector molecules in their GTP-bound form [16].
RanGTP could have initially regulated membrane traffic
or a primitive anuclear form of mitosis [9]. Without Ran
and a directional and selective nuclear transport the
nucleus would not exist. To understand the origin of
nuclear compartmentalisation we therefore have to
understand the co-evolution of nuclear identity (Ran system), nuclear membranes, and selective nuclear transport.
Recently, it has been proposed that the uptake of the precursor of mitochondria, an alphaproteobacterium triggered nuclear compartmentalisation by infecting a host
archaebacterial cell with type II introns [17]. Although
this model is attractive, objections can be made why
uncontrolled intron spread could not have happened in
an archaebacterial host cell without meiotic sex [18]. The
intron spread model also fails to account for the origin of
selective nuclear transport.
Here I propose a model that explains the origin of all three
key elements of nuclear compartmentalisation, i.e.
nuclear identity, nuclear membranes, and selective
nuclear transport. I argue that the protoeukaryotic lineage,
originating as a sister group to crown archaebacteria
[4,19], evolved a nucleus to compartmentalise its ribosome factories. This was vital to prevent chimerism

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/31

between host ribosomes and host-encoded RPs of the protomitochondrium. Efficient segregation could only be
achieved by the evolution of the Ran system to spatially
mark chromatin, of karyopherins to chaperon RPs, and of
selective valves (the NPCs) to regulate nuclear permeability. This model proposes a causal link between the evolution of the nuclear compartment and the acquisition of
the mitochondrial ancestor, in agreement with the intronspread model. Ribosome chimerism, however, also provides a direct link between the selective forces driving
compartmentalisation and the evolution of the cellular
mechanisms achieving it.

Results and discussion
Chimeric ribosome formation in an anuclear
protoeukaryotic cell
Mitochondria originated before the radiation of eukaryotes given that all extant eukaryotes have or their ancestors
once had mitochondria [20-24]. It is also clear that extensive gene transfer from the protomitochondrial symbiont
to the host cell's genome during the early stages of symbiosis made a major contribution to the origin of eukaryotes
[25]. Whether mitochondria originated during a stage
where the host cell was still anuclear cannot be ascertained based on comparative genomic, phylogenetic or
other evidence. However, the phyletic distribution of
some NPC and nuclear transport cycle components suggests that they are of probable symbiotic origin [10]. This
would mean that the acquisition of mitochondria overlapped with or predated the evolution of the nucleus.

The present model starts with an anuclear protoeukaryote
that already possessed an endomembrane system and
acquired the protomitochondrium. The symbiont started
to be converted into an organelle by the processes of
endosymbiotic gene transfer and host control. A survey of
all mitochondrial genomes indicates that the genes that
were transferred to the host genome in the period before
the radiation of crown eukaryotes (i.e. in the stem eukaryotic lineage) also included 24 genes encoding mitochondrial-RPs (L3, L4, L7/12, L9, L13, L15, L17, L21, L22, L24,
L25/23, L28, L29, L30, L33, L35, S5, S6, S9, S15, S16, S17,
S18, S21). The transfer of ribosomal genes at an anuclear
stage would have meant that mitochondrial-RPs were synthesized in the same cytoplasmic compartment where
host ribosomes were synthesized and assembled [4]. The
two types of RPs (archaebacterial/eukaryotic type of the
host and eubacterial type of the protomitochondrium)
can form chimeric ribosomes, as shown by biochemical
studies of extant eu- and archaebacteria ribosomes [2630]. Mapping the 24 ancestrally host-encoded mitochondrial-RPs to the structure of the 70S ribosome [31] highlights the scale of the problem (Figure 1). The potential
incorporation of up to 24 different mitochondrial-RPs
instead of host-RPs upon subunit assembly could have

The back-transfer of mitochondrial-RP genes after the loss
of the original mitochondrial copy and the acquisition of
mitochondrial targeting signals was not possible. This
unidirectionality (gene transfer ratchet) stems from the
fact that whereas mitochondrial genes can integrate into
the host genome following lysis of mitochondria, there is
no mechanism for reverse transfer. As shown below,
invoking a selective pressure to reduce ribosome chimerism, the model can explain key steps in the origin of
nuclear compartmentalisation.

produced chimeric ribosomes with reduced or no function. The suboptimal functioning of chimeric ribosomes
is supported by the rarity of evolutionary gene replacement between cytoplasmic and organellar RPs [32], as
opposed to metabolic enzymes [33] or tRNA synthases
[34]. The chimeric cell therefore faced the problem of distinguishing and sorting two sets of RPs that were synthesized in the same compartment.
A RanGTP-dependent karyopherin system can reduce
chimerism at an anuclear stage
The ribosome chimera load, resulting from the fixation of
slightly deleterious individual RP gene transfers from
symbiont to host created selective pressure to reduce chimerism. Compensatory advantageous mutations that
reduced chimerism and restored fitness started to spread.

In the first evolutionary stage described by the model, the
protoeukaryotic cell was still anuclear. The genome was
attached to an evolving endomembrane system [4,9].
Host ribosomes were assembled around chromatin
because assembly was seeded on the transcribing host
rRNAs. Mitochondrial-RPs were synthesized in the cytoplasm and could freely diffuse to the chromatin region
and incorporate into host ribosomes, leading to the formation of chimeric ribosomes. Ribosome chimerism was
reduced when the cell evolved mechanisms to enrich
host-RPs around chromatin. This involved the evolution
of the Ran system as a chromatin mark and its employment to influence the distribution of free RPs in the cell.
Ran evolved its ability to mark the position of chromatin
when its exchange factor (RCC1) acquired chromatin
localization. The localized GDP to GTP exchange created
a region in the cytoplasm with higher RanGTP concentration. The chromatin-enriched RanGTP could reduce ribosome chimerism. It is sufficient to invoke a chaperone
system binding to free RPs and that RanGTP regulated
these RP-chaperon complexes. When RanGTP could selectively dissociate host-RP-chaperon complexes but not
mitochondrial-RP-chaperon
complexes,
host-RPs
enriched around chromatin. These ribosomal chaperons
(hereafter called karyopherins) are conceived as the ancestors of the karyopherin family of nuclear transport receptors that still retain chaperon activity [35].
Computer simulations using the program Virtual Cell
with a spatial reaction-diffusion model show that an
increasing influence of RanGTP on karyopherin-RP dissociation can progressively reduce chimera load (Figure 2).
The spatial model used in the simulations has a cytoplasmic domain with a central chromatin region and peripheral mitochondria (Figure 2A). RCC1, the exchange factor
of Ran, is localized to the surface of chromatin and is not
diffusible. The reaction-diffusion system consisting of
localized GDP to GTP exchange and uniform GTP hydrolysis by Ran (stimulated by RanGAP) creates a RanGTP gradient with its maximum around chromatin (Figure 2B).
This RanGTP gradient can then influence the distribution
of RPs. One host and one mitochondrial-RP were modelled, both bound by a uniformly distributed karyopherin. Due to the dissociation of host-RP-karyopherin

complexes by RanGTP, host-RPs enrich around chromatin
(Figure 2C). This results in the local decrease in mitochondrial-RP to host-RP ratio, which was used as a measure of
chimerism (Figure 2D). The evolution of this RanGTP
driven host-RP-karyopherin dissociation (RanGTP + hostRP-karyopherin => RanGTP-karyopherin + host-RP)
could have efficiently reduced chimerism as shown with
four simulations using an increasing forward rate constant
for the reaction (Figure 2D). These results show that an
emerging RanGTP-karyopherin system could have
reduced ribosome chimerism even without a NE and
NPCs.
An open NE limits diffusion and sharpens the RanGTP
gradient
The next key step in the evolution of nuclear compartmentalisation was the development of a membrane network
around
chromatin
from
the
secretory
endomembrane system of the protoeukaryote. The evolution of the NE from pre-existing, dynamic endomem-

branes is strongly supported by the evolutionary
relationship between NPC components and vesicle coat
complexes [1,2]. If the NE evolved from intracellular
membranes (and not e.g. from a symbiont's membrane),
as these studies strongly suggest, then there was necessarily a stage with an open NE surrounding chromatin, without well developed NPCs. Clearly such an open
membrane network without NPCs could not have maintained selective nuclear transport and therefore a compositionally distinct nuclear compartment. On the other
hand, NPCs embedded in the NE, could only have
evolved when a membrane network was already present
around chromatin. This problem can only be resolved by
supposing that a primordial, open NE initially evolved
around chromatin for reasons other than supporting
NPC-dependent transport. Here I suggest that the primordial open NE initially served as a diffusion barrier that created a sharper RanGTP gradient. This contributed to the
definition of the evolving nucleoplasm and further
reduced ribosome chimerism. Virtual Cell simulations

An open membrane network sharpens the RanGTP gradient and reduces ribosome chimerism. The three
geometries used for the simulations represent intermediate evolutionary stages with progressively more membranes around
chromatin. The ratio of the size of the membrane domains and the gaps between them increases from no membranes (no NE,
panel A), through 2:1 (B), to 20:1 (C). Although the chromosomes are embedded in a membrane network, there is no selective
nuclear transport. Every component can freely diffuse across the gaps between the membrane domains. In the simulations all

Biology Direct 2008, 3:31

using identical parameters but three different geometries
(Figure 3A–C) show that an open membrane system
increases RanGTP concentration around chromatin and
sharpens the RanGTP gradient (Figure 3D–G). The higher
RanGTP levels increase the localised release of host-RPs
from karyopherin and further reduce the chimera load
(Figure 3H). Furthermore, the sharper RanGTP distribution also sharpens the distribution of host-RPs and makes
it more uniform in the ribosome factories.
Importantly, the effect of an open NE on RanGTP distribution is not equivalent to generally increasing RanGTP
levels in the cell. This could be achieved e.g. by reducing
RanGAP levels (from 1 to 0.2 μm, Figure 3G) and thereby
GTP hydrolysis by Ran. This would lead to an increase in
RanGTP levels also in the non-chromatin regions of the
cytoplasm and would blur the distinction between chromatin and non-chromatin regions of the cell (Figure 3G).
An open membrane network around chromatin on the
contrary leads to a local increase in RanGTP concentration
and therefore the further differentiation of cytoplasm and
nucleoplasm. This diffusional effect on RanGTP distribution, even without selective nuclear transport, is the likely
selective cause for the evolution of a dense membrane network around chromatin. This membrane network subsequently served as the scaffold for the formation of NPCs.
Evolution of a selective hydrogel sieve at nuclear pores
The evolution of a dense membrane network was the precondition for the evolution of NPCs and selective nuclear
transport. NPCs evolved by the modification of membrane coating complexes of the developing eukaryotic
endomembrane system [1]. These complexes initially
probably functioned in shaping the open membrane network around chromatin and in preventing its complete
fusion [4]. Selectively permeable NPCs evolved as these
coat complexes developed a meshwork of natively
unfolded FG repeats in the holes of the n-torus (where n
is the number of pores). FG nucleoporins can evolve
quickly [36] and repeat expansion could have rapidly created a dense meshwork of FG repeats during the origin of
NPCs. This meshwork further limited diffusion between
the two sides of the NE. As the FG network started to form
crosslinks and became a hydrogel [37,38], it was no
longer permeable to larger molecules. Only transport carriers (karyopherins) and cargo bound to them evolved the
capacity to selectively permeate the pores. RanGTP dissociated the karyopherin-cargo complexes that traversed the
pores at the nuclear side.

As NPCs progressively closed up, other nuclear cargos also
had to be imported specifically. These secondary cargo
proteins evolved nuclear localization signals (NLS) that
mimicked the sequences used by karyopherins to recognize host-RPs. Given that RPs are the most basic proteins

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/31

in the cell, some of these recognition sequences could
have been short basic stretches of amino acids generally
occurring in RPs. These motifs had to be refined to allow
specific recognition of individual host-RPs, alternatively,
some host-RPs evolved novel regions for karyopherin
binding. These include for example L25 that has an extra
N-terminal NLS-carrying region, absent from archaebacterial homologues [39]. Some other cargoes, including
DNA-binding proteins, could have easily evolved NLSs by
the slight modification of their basic DNA-binding
regions.
At this stage several processes had to evolve simultaneously. Nuclear export pathways evolved in parallel with
import pathways. Following gene duplications two karyopherin types evolved, one for import and one for export.
Contrary to import karyopherins, the export karyopherins
bound cargo in the presence of RanGTP. The RanGTP gradient was further sharpened when RanGAP became predominantly cytoplasmic by acquiring export signals.
Further differentiation of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm
occurred when the assembly of 80S ribosomes was prevented in the nucleus and the large and small subunits
were exported separately using a Crm1 and RanGTPdependent mechanism [40,41]. This restricted protein
synthesis to the cytoplasmic side.
In the final stage that was modelled, the NE was closed
and transport across NPCs was described as fluxes. RanGAP was cytoplasmic and RPs were only synthesized in
the cytoplasm (see Figure 4). RPs could only cross the NE
when bound to karyopherin (this disregards passive transport of small RPs that can happen but is less efficient then
karyopherin-dependent transport). RanGTP dissociated
host-RP-karyopherin complexes and stabilized mitochondrial-RP-karyopherin ones. Ribosome chimerism was
greatly reduced compared to the open NE stages. At this
stage, which is similar to the situation in modern eukaryotes, the nucleus is fully defined compositionally.
The ribosome chimerism model presents a detailed and
gradual molecular scenario on how a compositionally distinct nuclear compartment could have evolved. It can
account for several independent factors and their role in
the evolution of compartmentalisation. These factors
include the parameters of the RanGDP/GTP cycle, the
geometry of the endomembrane system and the permeability of NPCs. I proposed ribosome chimerism as the
likely selective factor driving these changes, although it
was probably not the exclusive one.
The model agrees with the intron-spread model [17] in
some important aspects but disagrees in others. Both
models agree that the acquisition of the protomitochondrium and ensuing endosymbiotic gene transfer were the

primary causes triggering the evolution of nuclear compartmentalisation. Whether the host that acquired the
protomitochondrium was phagotrophic or not, although
a major unresolved debate [4,24,42-45], is not strictly relevant for any of the models. The main difference is that
the current model does not require the spread of spliceosomal introns before the origin of nuclear compartmentalisation. It is more consistent with the idea that introns
started to spread selfishly only after the separation of transcription and translation [46] and that this spread was
facilitated by the origin of intron-dependent nonsensemediated mRNA decay [47].

Conclusion
Two important factors can be distinguished in the evolution of the nucleus, a neutral and a selective one. The fixation of slightly deleterious unidirectional transfer events

of protomitochondrial genes to the host genome (gene
transfer ratchet) was neutral and resulted in chimerism
and reduced fitness. The second factor was the selective
spread of compensatory advantageous mutations that
reduced chimerism by segregating the mixed components.
I defined key cellular and molecular stages and showed a
gradual transition through them during which chimerism
was progressively reduced. Most importantly, it was
shown that it is possible to de-couple the origin of the NE
and NPCs by invoking an open NE stage where the membranes served only as a diffusion barrier.
The idea that the nucleus evolved as a protective compartment, a solution to segregate ribosome factories in an
endosymbiont-carrying cell does not require foresight
from evolution. This is in contrast to the frequently
encountered formulation that the nucleus evolved to

allow a more sophisticated control of gene regulation.
Eukaryotic gene regulation, RNA processing and other
nuclear functions probably only evolved secondarily, as a
means to adapt to the new situation resulting from the
compartmentalisation of ribosome biogenesis.

Methods
Mitochondrial genomes were searched for the presence of
RPs at the Organelle Genome Database (Gobase; http://
gobase.bcm.umontreal.ca/). The RPs that do not occur in
any mitochondrial genomes were visualized in the structure of the Thermus thermophilus 70S ribosome (PDB
Codes: 2J02 and 2J03) using Pymol http://pymol.source
forge.net/.
The simulations were run using Virtual Cell 4.4 at http://
www.nrcam.uchc.edu/. The geometry size was 20 × 20
microns, the mesh size 300 × 300 points. The geometries
had five volume domains (extracellular, cytoplasm, mitochondria, NE and chromatin) and four surface (membrane) domains (plasmamembrane, mitochondrial
membrane, chromatin surface and NE membrane). No
reactions happened in the extracellular, chromatin and
NE domains. The mitochondrial membrane had a flux of
mitochondrial-RP (0.5 * Mitochondrial_RP_Cytoplasm
μM*μm2/sec) and the chromatin surface contained RCC1.
The five geometries used differed only in the size of the NE
membranes. Simulations were run until steady state (150
sec total time, 0.0010 sec time steps) using the finite volume method. The reactions and parameters used for the
simulations are partly based on previous studies
[7,48,49]. The RCC1-stimulated RanGDP/GTP exchange
was modelled using Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km =
0.5 μm and Vmax = 10.0*RCC1 molecules*μm-2 sec-1,
instead of a four-step model as in [7,48,49]. RanGAPstimulated GTP hydrolysis by Ran was modelled using
Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km = 0.7 μm and Vmax =
10.6*RanGAP μM sec-1. The binding of karyopherin to
host-RP and mitochondrial-RP was described with mass
action kinetics with Kf = 10 μM-1 sec-1 and Kr = 5 sec-1. The
dissociation of host-RP-karyopherin complexes by
RanGTP was described with mass action with a Kf = 3 μM1 sec-1. The diffusion coefficients used were 22 μm2 sec-1
for RanGDP/GTP and RanGAP, 14 μm2 sec-1 for karyopherin, 20 μm2 sec-1 for RPs, and 13 μm2 sec-1 for karyopherin-RanGTP, karyopherin-host-RP and karyopherinmitochondrial-RP complexes. The initial concentrations
were 6 μM for Ran, 4 μM for karyopherin, 1 μM for RanGAP and 500 μM for RCC1 on the chromatin surface.
Host-RP and mitochondrial-RP were synthesized with a
reaction rate of 0.1 μM sec-1 and decayed following mass
action with 0.1*RP mM sec-1.
The models are deposited into the public model database
of Virtual Cell at http://www.nrcam.uchc.edu/.

Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20894, USA

The driving force behind the emergence of the nucleus is
a key aspect of eukaryogenesis. In this paper, Jékely proposes a new idea, namely, that the evolution of the
nucleus from the endomembrane system was driven primarily by the necessity to avoid the formation of hybrid
ribosomes containing partly host and partly mitochondrial r-proteins. In my opinion, the general premises of
this paper are correct. Indeed, there is every reason to
believe, firstly, that the origin of the nucleus postdates
mitochondrial endosymbiosis and, secondly, that the
nuclear envelope evolved from the endomembrane system. It stands to reason, then, that the nucleus evolved
under the pressure of selection for partitioning the
genome from the cytosol, and that pressure was caused by
the need to alleviate conflicts caused by the collision of
host and mitochondrial components. I am inclined to
think that, beyond this general connection, it might be
futile to search for a single cause behind the origin of the
nucleus. From my viewpoint, it is more reasonable to
accept that multiple host-symbiont conflicts were at play.
Avoidance of ribosomal chimerism, indeed, could be one
of these, but so would be control of the damage caused by
intron invasion, and there well could be multiple other
factors.
Author's response
I agree that probably multiple factors played a role during
the evolution of the nucleus. The role of RP chimerism is
featured here prominently because the cell biological scenario that can be built on this premise is parsimonious
and powerful as it provides a direct link between the
source of the conflict (chimerism) and the mechanism to
resolve it (nuclear transport). Regarding the role of
introns, I am more inclined to think that they started to
spread after, rather than before, the segregation of cytoplasm and nucleoplasm.

Gáspár Jékely provides an interesting and original rationale for the origin of the nucleus, that, in one go, explains
the assembly of ribosomal complexes in the nucleus. The
lynchpin of the argument is the undesirable formation of

ribosome chimeras upon the transfer of mitochondrial
ribosome genes to the nucleus. Upon reading the title and
abstract I was a bit sceptical about the likelihood of chimeric ribosomes, but apparently these has been documented. The supporting of the hypothesis with an elegant
mathematical model is appreciated, as such models often
reveal holes in hypotheses. In this case this appears not to
be the case. Still I have some issues with the argument that
I would like the author to address:
Is there, in the literature, replacement (chimerism) in
competitive situations? And connected to this question,
how is the likelihood of forming chimeras in the model
calculated? Is that, as I understand from the legend of the
figures, the ratio of the mitochondrial RP over the host
RP? How would the model behave if the likelihood of chimera's was smaller than that. These ribosomes have after
all, evolved for a long time independently.
Author's response
Replacement could also be demonstrated in a competitive
situation. In one paper [28] the endogenous E. coli L2 is
replaced in vivo by overexpressed Haloarcula marismortui
L2 in 25% of the ribosomes. In the model chimerism is
characterised with the ratio of mitochondrial-RP over
host-RP. This is an arbitrary measure, and the probability
of chimera formation will affect this. If it was 10 times
smaller, then the figures would also be 10 times smaller,
however, the relative difference under the different condition (e.g. following the development of NE vesicles)
would be the same. So irrespective of the kinetics of chimera formation, the number of chimeric ribosomes
would always be proportional to the ratio of mitochondrial-RP over host-RP (unless of course the kinetic parameters of chimera formation themselves change, e.g. due to
sequence divergence – see below).

We know that most of the catalytic activity in ribosomes is
in the RNA, so why would replacement lead to loss of
activity?
Author's response
I changed activity to 'function'. RPs can have a role for
example in tRNA binding or downstream processes. SSU
S9 for example contacts the anticodon stem-loop of P-site
tRNA and LSU L23 provides a major binding site for the
signal recognition particle and the translocon. One can
imagine that these and other functions were less efficient
in chimeric ribosomes.

If the transfer of mitochondrial ribosome genes to the
nucleus leads, via the production of chimeras, to a
reduced fitness, one would not expect it to occur.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/31

Author's response
This point was also brought up by Patrick Forterre. The
answer is that slightly deleterious individual transfers
could have reached fixation by genetic drift. Once mitochondrial re-targeting evolved and the original copy was
lost, there was no way back, because there is no mechanism for reverse transfer (gene transfer ratchet). The mutations that were driving compartmentalisation spread as
compensatory advantageous mutations, reducing chimerism. The attractiveness of this model is that the level of fitness reduction is 'tuneable' given that up to 24 individual
RP gene transfers occurred. The fixation of each transfer
could have lead to fitness reduction that was compensated
during the successive stages of nuclear compartmentalisation.

If chimera's were an issue, one expects the evolution of
ribosomal proteins that do not form chimera's: i.e. evolution at the level of the ribosome genes to prevent "crosshybridizations". Rather than this, the model proposes an
evolution of a specificity of the RanGTP for host-RP-chaperon complexes.
Author's response
Sequence divergence may have been an important factor
as well, as proposed by Cavalier-Smith [4]. The model
requires that such divergence was not sufficient and complementary surfaces still remained that formed chimeric
ribosomes.

Do I understand from the figures correctly that there is
still a lot of chimerism in the cytoplasm?
Author's response
Yes, but exchange in assembled ribosome does not happen, or is very slow for most RPs [50]. What is critical is
the mitochondrial-RP/host-RP ratio during subunit maturation. This means that nucleoplasmic chimerism was a
much more serious problem for the cell than cytoplasmic
chimerism.

The total number of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins of
(alpha-proteo)bacterial origin now totals 53 including
RPS3 and RPL29 that are homologous to MRPS24 and
MRPL47 (Smits, Smeitink, van den Heuvel, Huynen and
Ettema, NAR 2007). I do not know which ones of these
are never found on mitochondrial genomes.
Author's response
RPS3 can be found in plant mitochondrial genomes but
RPL29 not, so it also must have been transferred early. I
included it into the list.

The difference between orange and yellow in Figure 2B
and 2C is quite subtle, could another color be used?

Reviewer's report 3
Anthony M. Poole Arrhenius Laboratories for Natural Sciences, Stockholm University, Department of Molecular
Biology & Functional Genomics, Stockholm, Sweden

This article proposes that the origin of the nucleus serve to
reduce or eliminate the risk of ribosome chimerism arising from the transfer of mitochondrion-derived ribosomal protein genes to the host genome. I found this paper
very interesting, and was particularly impressed by the
author's attempt to test aspects of this hypothesis using a
virtual cell model.
One key point that the reader must first accept in order to
entertain the model is that the mitochondrion predates
the nucleus in evolution. Obviously this viewpoint is
shared by other authors (e.g. ref. [17]) but, to my mind,
there is no strong evidence to support this contention. The
only argument that Jékely raises to support this viewpoint
is a reference to Mans et al. (ref. [10]), where it is suggested that some components of the NPC are of α-proteobacterial origin. In that paper, which is based on sequence
similarities and distributions, it is tacitly assumed that
NPC components must ultimately be of prokaryotic origin, and hence any similarities are interpreted as confirming this. The sequences of these proteins are sufficiently
divergent as to make it impractical to address these proposed origins with phylogenetic analyses (as those
authors point out). However, none of the proteins or folds
of putatively α-proteobacterial origin are restricted solely
to this group of bacteria (see their Table 1). I bring this
point up in order to make it clear that the data used to
support this order of events are weak. To my mind, it is
not currently possible to ascertain whether the nucleus
evolved before or after the mitochondrial ancestor was
engulfed. I am nevertheless happy to concede Jékely's version of events as a possibility.
Author's response
I agree with this and find the comparative genomic evidence week. I modified the relevant part of the text to
make this clear.

Assuming then that the mitochondrion predates the
nucleus, the idea of avoidance of chimerism through
intranuclear assembly of the ribosome is an attractive one.
As is well known, ribosomes are not assembled in the
cytoplasm but in the nucleolus, well away from the site of
translation – of both host- and mitochondrion-derived
ribosomal proteins. Secondly, there is of course a system
for the recognition (transit peptides) and transport of
mitochondrial proteins to that organelle. The outcome of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/31

these intracellular modes of molecular transport is that
the two sets of proteins are kept distinct, which is what the
simulation serves to show for the nuclear-targeted proteins.
However, one question that is nagging me is how much of
an issue chimerism really was. Clearly, for an organelle-tohost genome gene transfer event to be fixed, there must be
an existing mechanism for transport of proteins from the
cytoplasm to the organelle. This sort of makes me wonder
if this isn't host-initiated. That is to say, the first instances
of protein targeting to the mitochondrion might in fact
have been of host-encoded proteins (perhaps that served
to better maintain the symbiosis in some way). This
would make it somewhat easier to explain the emergence
of the mitochondrial-targeting system – as is well-established, plenty of proteins of non-endosymbiont origin are
now targeted to the mitochondrion. The reason I bring
this up is that I can't imagine successful transfer of a mitochondrial-origin gene (meaning that the mitochondrial
copy is lost), where that gene is still required to function
in the mitochondrion, unless there is a pre-existing functional transport system to get the product back into the
organelle. That suggests that the mitochondrial targeting
pathway was already functioning, which would in turn
reduce any chimerism simply due to the fact that these
proteins would already be specifically targeted to the
mitochondrion.
Author's response
Clearly, a mitochondrial targeting system had to be in
place and mitochondrial RPs had to acquire the necessary
targeting signals before the mitochondrial gene copies
could be lost. However, mitochondrial RPs were still synthesized in the cytoplasm, which means that there had
been a dwell time and some diffusion in the cytoplasm
before the targeting signals were recognised. The simulations try to approximate such a situation, mitochondria
serve as a 'sink' and mitochondrial RP import is modelled
as a flux.

One further concern I have along these same lines is
regarding nuclear localisation signals. In the section, 'Evolution of a selective hydrogel sieve at nuclear pores', the
statement is made that nuclear localization signals 'mimicked the sequences used by karyopherins to recognise
host-RPs'. The argument is then made that these could
have been basic regions, which RPs have no shortage of.
What bothers me about this is that this would apply
equally to mitochondrial-RPs. All the more reason to
assume that mitochondrial import pathways cannot be
ignored, and would have been at least as important in
eliminating potential chimerism. I know of a couple of
references that indicate how noisy the nuclear import
pathway is. One is an odd experiment (in that I am not

Page 10 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:31

sure why the authors did it) where nuclear localisation of
an archaeal proteasome subunit is demonstrated (Nederlof et al. 1995 PNAS 92, 12060–12064). Second, a paper
by Cokol et al. (EMBO Rep 1:411–415, 2000) points out
that for DNA binding proteins with a known NLS, 90% of
the time these two motifs overlap. Of relevance to chimerism, they go on to show that, on sequence alone, E. coli is
estimated to produce 54 proteins that carry potential NLSs
(about half of which are DNA binding motifs). If preventing mitochondrial-origin proteins from spuriously entering the nucleus were solely the domain of the nuclear
transport system, I doubt it would be very effective.
Author's response
The template role of DNA binding proteins in the evolution of NLSs is another possibility. In this model I suggest
a primary role for RP import. I would of course be interested in discussing models that explain why the cell
started to bind and transport its DNA binding proteins. So
far I haven't heard of one, and I couldn't come up with
one either. I rather suspect, given the noisy nature of
nuclear transport, that DNA binding proteins started to be
transported after or along with RPs with minimal or no
modification of their basic motifs. Eubacterial ribosomal
proteins are also imported into eukaryotic nuclei [51].

I agree that that it is difficult, based on linear basic motifs,
to segregate mitochondrial-RPs and host-RPs. The evolution of more specific recognition would be required for
that. I also agree that the increased efficiency of mitochondrial targeting could have played a role as well. Additionaly, I suggested that the active exclusion of mitochondrialRPs by export mechanisms could have played a role. I
didn't find experimental evidence in favour of this possibility though.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/31

Finally, a comment. While this type of paper typically
stands or falls on whether the primary argument is
accepted, there are some additional, important, and
uncontroversial insights on the stepwise origin of certain
features of the nuclear pore complex and nuclear transport that are important contributions in themselves. Specifically, the section 'Evolution of a selective hydrogel
sieve at nuclear pores' illustrates how recent experimental
results [37,38] shed light on the stepwise evolution of
nuclear pore selectivity. Likewise, the importance of
RanGTP and karyopherins to our understanding of the
evolution of the emergence of a fully-fledged nuclear
transport system should be clear after reading this paper.
Author's response
I am happy to read this comment. My selective scenario
may not be correct, but the cell biological steps for the
evolution of the nucleus can be integrated into other
frameworks as well and should have general validity concerning for example the evolution of the Ran gradient.

The minor comments I have are as follows:
p4: the description of the argument given in ref 18 is not
accurate. That paper takes issue with Martin & Koonin's
model (ref 17) wherein massive mitochondrion-derived
group II intron infection of an archaeal host genome
drives evolution of the nucleus. However, it argues that
intron proliferation could not have happened before the
origin of meiotic sex – no argument is made that such
spread necessarily requires a nucleus.
p8: The argument for an open NE would be clearer if the
relevant aspects of the model proposed by Devos et al. (ref
1) were summarised.

None of this is to say that the theory rendered implausible
– it is not. However, it is a shortcoming of the current
paper that it does not consider the machinery for mitochondrial-targeting.

p9: If the author feels that an explanation of a torus needs
to be given, then a reference work other than Wikipedia
should be cited. The dictionary would suffice, though personally I think the reference can be removed altogether.

Another question I have is how the nucleolus ties into all
this. Given that this organelle maintains its integrity
within the nucleus despite not being membrane-bound,
and is the site of rRNA transcription and ribosome subunit assembly, is it really necessary to invoke the nuclear
envelope to explain reduced chimerism? If the author has
any comments on this, it would be interesting to hear
them.

Author's response
I modified these parts.

Author's response
I don't think that the nucleolus can serve as a specific diffusion or permeability barrier for certain proteins, as the
NE and NPCs can, even though it has its integrity.

Reviewer's report 4
Patrick Forterre, Universite Paris Sud and Institut Pasteur,
Paris, France

Gáspár Jékely has previously played an important role in
pointing the importance of the Ran proteins in the origin
of the eukaryotic nucleus. He convincingly shown that the
eukaryotic nucleus evolved by modification of a pre-existing endomembrane system, strongly supporting the
endogenous scenario for the origin of the nucleus. These

Page 11 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2008, 3:31

scenarios contrast with the fashionable idea that the
nucleus originated from an archaeal endosymbiont.
Considering that the rRNA and all informational proteins
of eukaryotes are very divergent from bacterial ones, suggesting a long periods of evolution after the divergence
between these two domains, the simplest endogeneous
scenario for the origin for the nucleus is that the nucleus
originated in a lineage of pre-eukaryotic cells, before the
endosymbiosis that led to the presence of mitochondria
in all modern eukaryotes. However, in the present manuscript, Gáspár Jékely adopts an alternative scenario, in
which the eukaryotic nucleus originated relatively
recently, i.e. between the mitochondrial endosymbiosis
and the radiation of major eukaryotic divisions.
Author's response
I don't see why an inferred ancient divergence time –
based on the assumption of a reliable rRNA molecular
clock, which is far from being a safe one – should reveal
the temporal order of the origin of the nucleus and the
mitochondrium.

To support this assumption, Gáspár refers to a comparative genomic study of Koonin and colleagues (Mans et al.,
2004) in which these authors, according to Gáspár, state
that « several components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC)
and nuclear transport cycle are of probable alphaproteobacterial
origin » (Ref 10). This is somewhat confusing, suggesting
that Koonin and colleagues have indeed shown (for
instance by phylogenetic analysis) that components of the
nuclear pore complex have a specific phylogenetic affinity
for their alpha-proteobacterial homologues, which is not
the case since. In fact, in the abstract of their paper,
Koonin and colleagues only state that « NPC and nuclear
transport cycle are of probable endosymbiotic origin ». More
importantly, this statement is only an hypothesis deduced
from their favourite scenario for eukaryotic origin (fusion
of an archaeon and the alpha-proteobacterium at the origin of eukaryotes), but it is absolutely not supported by
the data. Indeed, NPC proteins have no homologues in
bacteria, but only share conserved protein repeated
domains with some widely distributed bacterial proteins.
This is clear both from the data of Koonin and colleagues
and from a paper published one year later by Bapteste and
colleagues on the same topic. In their paper, Bapteste et al
found 15 distantly related prokaryotic homologues of
NCP, all with WD repeated domains and conclude that «
an ancient system of transmembrane transport that originated
before the separation of the three domains was recruited during
early eukaryotic evolution » (Genome Biology, 6/R85,
2005).

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/31

Author's response
Your criticism agrees with that of Anthony Poole, and I
changed this section and indicated that the data don't
unequivocally support a symbiotic origin for NPC and
nuclear transport proteins.

Considering the absence of homologues of the NCP proteins in Archaea or Bacteria, it is likely that the nucleus
originated in a specific pre-eukaryotic lineage of organisms either ancestral or sister group of Archaea. As repeatedly pointed out by several authors, this also makes senses
since eukaryotes have a capacity of phagocytosis that
explains well why one of their ancestor was able to engulf
the alpha proteobacterion at the origin of mitochondria.
The large cells of the pre-eukaryotic lineage should have
been already endowed with this properties (phagocytosis), which is unknown in Bacteria or Archaea.
Author's response
I totally agree with these points. However, the ability of
phagocytosis does not necessarily mean that these cells
also had a nucleus. I nevertheless acknowledge that one
can make a strong case by asking how the integrity of the
genome was maintained in a cell that already developed
cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane traffic [4]. The
answer to this could be that the cell was also able to regulate its cytoskeletal dynamics and the place of chromosomes in it, as it happens e.g. during open mitosis. Such
regulation could in fact have been the first role of the
emerging Ran system.

In the framework of the mixed origin of eukaryotes,
Gáspár Jékely proposes an elegant explanation for the origin of the nucleus, suggesting that the nuclear membrane
emerged progressively to prevent the formation of hybrid,
less efficient, ribosomes, containing a mixture of protoeukaryotic and bacterial ribosomal proteins.
Author's response
All theories on the origin of eukaryotes have to be mixed
origin theories because at least the mitochondrium and a
host cell have to come together to get to the eukaryotic
cenancestor. I would like to emphasise though that my
theory is not a chimeric or fusion theory that assumes that
eukaryogenesis initiated when two prokaryotic lineages
fused together. The chimerism in the title refers to extensive component mixing after mitochondrial symbiosis
and, more specifically, chimeric ribosomes. I am an advocate of an initial phase of eukaryogenesis during which a
dynamic endomembrane system, cytoskeleton and
phagocytosis evolved [3,9,45]. The mitochondrium came
later, and triggered the origin of the nucleus. The present
model, however, is also consistent with strict chimeric
theories, like the hydrogen hypothesis.

Biology Direct 2008, 3:31

Indeed, he rightly notices that 23 genes encoding bacterial
ribosomal proteins (from the endosymbiont) have been
transferred to the chromosomes of ancestral eukaryotic
cells before the divergence of the major eukaryotic lineages. He then suggests that these transfers corresponds to
a neutral phase of eukaryotic evolution that occurred
before the formation of the nucleus, leading to chimerism
and reduced fitness. This in turn would have triggered a
selective pressure to create a barrier separating the eukaryotic ribosome factory from the mitochondrial ribosome
factory (the nuclear membrane).

However, in my opinion, there is a major default in this
reasoning. The transfer of bacterial ribosomal proteins to
the eukaryotic genome could not have not been both neutral and highly deleterious (reducing fitness) !! Accordingly, cells in which these transfers occurred would have
been strongly counter-selected and would have simply
disappeared. In fact, I think that Gáspár Jékely gives us a
strong argument to think that transfer of bacterial genes
from the mitochondrion to the eukaryotic genome
occurred indeed after the formation of the nucleus. Otherwise, the transfer of mitochondrial ribosomal protein
genes (being strongly counter-selected) would have simply never occurred in the first place.

I agree with Gáspár Jékely that one should propose a positive selection pressure for the origin of the nucleus. In my
opinion, such positive selection pressure could be the
requirement for the cell to protect their genomes from the
attack of incoming viruses. Modern viruses replicating in
the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells form nuclear-like structures by recruiting membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum to protect their genomes from the attack of their host.
The complex modern nucleus can have originated progressively (possibly through some of the steps described
in the Jékely's manuscript) in the interplay between
viruses and cells, both eager to protect their genomes from
the other by physical segregation. Later on, some viruses
have finally managed to replicate inside the eukaryotic
nucleus.
