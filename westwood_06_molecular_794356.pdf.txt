Abstract
Background: Entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana are considered promising
biological control agents for a variety of arthropod pests. Beauveria species, however, have the
potential to elicit allergenic reactions in humans, although no specific allergens have been
characterized to date.
Methods: Four putative allergens were identified within B. bassiana expressed sequence tag (EST)
datasets. IgE-reactivity studies were performed using sera from patients displaying mold allergies
against recombinant B. bassiana proteins expressed in E. coli.
Results: Full length cDNA and genomic nucleotide sequences of four potential B. bassiana allergens
were isolated. BLASTX search results led to their putative designation as follows; Bb-Eno1, with
similarity to fungal enolases; Bb-f2, similar to the Aspergillus fumigatus major allergen, Asp f2 and to
a fibrinogen binding mannoprotein; Bb-Ald, similar to aldehyde dehydrogenases; and Bb-Hex,
similar to N-acetyl-hexosaminadases. All four genes were cloned into E. coli expression systems and
recombinant proteins were produced. Immunoblots of E. coli extracts probed with pooled as well
as individual human sera from patients displaying mould allergies demonstrated IgE reactivity versus
recombinant Bb-Eno1 and Bb-Ald.
Conclusion: Four putative Beauveria bassiana allergens were identified. Recombinant proteins
corresponding to two of the four, Bb-Eno1 and Bb-Ald were bound by sera IgEs derived from
patients with fungal allergies. These data confirm the potential allergenicity of B. bassiana by
identification of specific human IgE reactive epitopes.

Background
Allergic diseases represent a growing human health problem, affecting up to 25% of individuals living in industrialized nations [1]. Both in- and outdoor populations of
filamentous fungi are a major cause of human allergies
and asthma, and can in some cases, lead to severe allergic
disease [2]. Overall, some 30% of asthma cases can be

attributed to exposure and sensitization to filamentous
fungal allergens [3-5].
Beauveria bassiana is an entomopathogenic fungi currently
under intensive study as a biological control agent against
a wide range of agricultural, nuisance, and disease carrying insect pests [6-10]. B. bassiana is considered non-path-

ogenic to vertebrates, has not been deemed a potential
health or environmental hazard [11], and has received
EPA approval for commercial use. Volumetric assays of
allergens performed in the Netherlands in the 1980's,
revealed that although the environmental concentration
of Beauveria spores was very low, the allergic response was
quite high [12,13]. Using skin prick assays on patients
with mold allergies, B. bassiana was shown to elicit one of
the strongest reactions relative to the other fungal species
tested. More recently, it has been confirmed that crude
extracts of B. bassiana can elicit allergic reactions in
humans [14]. Sera IgEs derived from patients displaying
allergies to molds as well as from people with no known
allergies reacted with several proteins present in B. bassiana crude extracts. Many of these proteins were cross reactive with epitopes present in a number of major allergenic
fungi, however the identities of any specific B. bassiana
allergen has yet to be reported. In order to gain more
information concerning B. bassiana and its potential allergenicity it is important to isolate the genes coding for IgEbinding allergens and characterize their protein products.
Recombinant purified allergens, as compared to crude
fungal extracts, can then be used to examine the nature of
the IgE binding as well as in the diagnosis of allergy, in
that the recombinant proteins are more standardized, can
be highly purified, and hence are more suitable for immunodiagnosis [15,16].
A significant number of fungal allergens are proteins of
unknown function, although the biochemical activities of
a number of allergens have been characterized. These typically fall into several classes including metabolic
enzymes, proteases, and enzyme inhibitors [5,17]. A molecule identified as an allergen in one species of fungus is
often found to be an allergen when identified in other
species, presumably due to similarities in structure and
hence IgE-reactive epitopes. Thus, aldehyde dehydrogenase has been identified as an allergen in both Alternaria
alternata (Alt a10) and Cladosporium herbarum (Cla h3)
[18]. Amongst other metabolic enzymes, enolases (2phosho-D-glycerate hydrolase) from a wide range of
organisms, are common allergens with shared epitopes
[19-21]. This phenomenon of cross-reactivity of an IgE
produced in response to an antigen from one organism to
another can lead to wide spectrum allergic reactions
derived from the original sensitization [22-24].
Here we report the identification of four B. bassiana proteins as potential allergens. Full length cDNA and
genomic nucleotide sequences of the four genes were
determined. Similarity search results of the translated
open reading frames of the proteins coded by the genes
have led to their putative designation as follows; Bb-Eno1,
an enolase; Bb-Ald, aldehyde dehydrogenase; Bb-f2, similar to Asp f2 and a fibrinogen binding mannoprotein; and

Bb-Hex, an N-acetylhexosaminidase. The cDNA
sequences of the proteins were used to design primers for
subcloning of the genes into E. coli expression vectors. All
four proteins were expressed as recombinant proteins in
E. coli. Two of these proteins, Bb-Eno1 and Bb-Ald reacted
with human IgEs derived from patients displaying mold
allergies.

Methods
Strains and cultures
Beauveria bassiana (ATCC 90517) was maintained on
Potato dextrose (PD) agar at 26°C. E. coli stains TOPO
Top10 (Invitrogen, CA) and BL21 Rosetta (DE3), harboring the pRARE plasmid (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany)
were used for routine cloning and protein expression,
respectively. E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani
(LB) nutrient broth or agar plates supplemented with the
appropriate antibiotics as indicated.
Bioinformatic identification of putative allergen genes
Construction and sequencing of expressed sequence
tagged (EST) cDNA libraries derived from five different
developmental stages of B. bassiana has recently been
reported [25,26]. Additional sequences were obtained by
suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) using fungal
cells grown on insect cuticles and fungal cells grown on
glucose as the tester and driver mRNAs respectively using
established protocols [27,28]. BLASTX similarity searches
using the sequence dataset (~18,000 ESTs) revealed four
sequences with high homology to allergen genes.
Molecular manipulations
Molecular manipulations including plasmid isolation,
restriction digestion, agarose-gel electrophoresis, and PCR
were performed using standard methods. Template
mRNA was extracted from B. bassiana grown on minimal
medium (per L; 0.4 g KH2PO4, 1.4 g Na2HPO4, 0.6 g
MgSO4-7H2O, 1.0 g KCl, 0.25 g NH4NO3, 0.01 mg FeSO4)
supplemented with 0.1% N-acetylglucosamine and 10%
sterilized insect cuticle (mole cricket, Scapteriscus abbreviatus). Cultures were inoculated with 105 conidia/ml and
grown with aeration for 6 d at 25°C. Fungal cells were
lysed by grinding in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was
extracted using RNAWiz (Ambion). cDNA libraries were
constructed using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification
kit (Clontech, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. For construction of E. coli expression plasmids, an
NdeI restriction site was incorporated into the forward
primer and an EcoRI site into the reverse primer. PCR
products were cloned directly into TOPO 2.1 using TOPO
TA cloning system and transformed into TOPO Top 10 E.
coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The TOPO 2.1 constructs were used for subcloning into the NdeI-EcoRI sites
of pET43.1a (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) for expres-

sion using E. coli BL21 host strain harboring the pRARE
plasmid.
Protein expression, Western and immunoblotting
Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 harboring pRARE along
with each respective pET43.1a based construct were
grown in 3 ml of LB (supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 12 μg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37°C with aeration. Fresh media (5–10 ml) was inoculated with aliquots
(0.1–0.2 ml) of the overnight culture, and samples were
incubated at 37°C with aeration to an OD600 = 0.6–0.8.
T7 polymerase based expression of the recombinant proteins was initiated by the addition of 1–1.5 mM (final
concentration)
isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG), and cultures were returned to the incubator for an
additional 2–3 hours. For extract preparation, cells were
harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and the
resultant pellet resuspended in 0.5 volumes TE (40 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF)). Cells were lysed by sonication (3 × 30 sec) on
ice, after which samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10
min) and separated into soluble and pellet (containing
potential inclusion bodies) fractions. Samples of the
crude soluble and pellet extracts were denatured with 4×
LDS loading dye (Invitrogen) and boiled for 1–5 min
prior to separation by SDS-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) using the Invitrogen NUPage-MOPS
buffer system (10–12% Bis-tris polyacrylamide gels)
according to the manufacture's recommended protocols.
Gels were stained with Coomasie Blue R250 followed by
destaining with 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid solution.
For Western blots and immunodetection, samples were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above, followed by
electroblotting to polyvinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Invitrogen). After blocking (TBST; 25 mM TrisHCl buffer saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 10% dry
fat free milk), membrane were probed with either individual or pooled human sera as the primary antibody solution. Typically, sera were diluted in blocking buffer and
incubated with membranes overnight at 4–8°C with gentle agitation. Membranes were washed 3 × using 50 ml
TBST for 15 min each. Binding of human IgEs was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated
goat anti-human IgE (polyclonal) secondary antibody
(BioSource International, CA). Membranes were incubated in secondary antibody (diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer) for 1 hr at room temperature, with gentle
agitation. After secondary antibody incubation membranes were washed 3 times using 50 ml TBST and bands
visualized using the Immuno-Star HRP detection system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Total protein membrane staining was performed using Ponceau S (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO).

Analysis programs
Nucleotide manipulations and phylogenetic analyses
were performed using multiple software programs. Initial
sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW [29].
Alignment files (in Nexus format) were transferred to
Splitstree for analysis and construction of phylograms,
with typical bootstrap parameters set to 1000 [30].
Genbank submission
The isolated cDNA and genomic sequences of the four B.
bassiana genes have been submitted to Genbank with the
following accession numbers; Bb-Eno1, DQ767719; Bbf2, DQ767720; Bb-Ald, DQ767722; and Bb-Hex,
DQ767722.

Results
Molecular characterization of four putative B. bassiana
allergens
EST (Expressed sequence tag) panning and screening of a
suppressive subtractive library (SSH) identified gene fragments of four potential allergens by sequence homology.
The B. bassiana genes were designated as follows: BbEno1, similar to Cladosporium herbarum enolase Cla h 6
[18]; Bb-f2, similar to Aspergillus fumigatus major allergen
Asp f2 [31]; Bb-Ald, similar to C. herbarum allergen Cla h
3, an aldehyde dehydrogenase [18]; and Bb-Hex, with
similarity to numerous fungal N-acetylhexosaminidases,
including the Penicillium chrysogenum Pen ch 20 allergen
[32].

Since the nucleotide fragments (200–300 bp) represented
only a portion of the entire gene sequence coding for each
protein, full length sequences were obtained by 5' and 3'
RACE PCR as needed. These results were used to assemble
the full length cDNA nucleotide sequences of the four
genes. Separate sets of primers were then designed for
amplification of the genomics DNA sequences of the
genes and for cloning into the E. coli pET43a-based protein expression system as described in the Methods section. The lengths of the cloned cDNA and genomic
sequences, the number of introns, along with an analysis
of the predicted ORFs, detailing the number of amino
acids, molecular mass, and pIs of the deduced B. bassiana
proteins are given in Table 1. Top BLASTX search results
for each protein are also presented (Table 2).
The genomic sequence of Bb-Eno1 consisted of 1548 bp
from the start site to the stop codon and contained four
introns. The lengths of the introns were between 52–69
bp and were located in the first half of the gene. The cDNA
sequence of the open reading frame of Bb-Eno1 consisted
of 1317 bp, constituting a protein of 438 amino acids
with a calculated molecular mass ~47 kDa. BLASTX similarity searches of the complete Bb-Eno1 amino acid
sequence against the NCBI protein database confirmed

The genomic sequence of Bb-f2 consisted of 845 bp (start
to stop codon) and contained one intron that began at bp
412 and was 59 bp in length. The coding sequence of BbF2 consisted of 261 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 28 kDa. BLASTX similarity searches confirmed that Bb-f2 displayed high sequence similarity to
the A. fumigatus major allergen Asp f 2.
The Bb-Ald genomic clone contained two introns; the first
106 bp in length, 62 bp from the ATG start codon, and the
second, 59 bp in length, starting 568 bp from the start
codon. The total size of the genomic clone was 1659 bp
(start to stop codon), with the cDNA sequence consisting
of 1494 bp coding for a proteins comprised of 497 amino
acids with a calculated molecular mass of 53 kDa. BLASTX

the query revealed similarity to aldehyde dehydrogenases,
including those from A. alternata and C. herbarum.
The genomic clone corresponding to Bb-Hex was 1959 bp

mass of 72 kDa. BLASTX similarity searches confirmed
high sequence similarity to fungal N-acetylhexosaminidases.
Expression of recombinant B. bassiana proteins
The coding sequences of the four B. bassiana genes were
subcloned into the pET43.1a expression vector as
described in the Methods. The integrity of all clones was
verified by sequencing of the inserts. The recombinant B.
bassiana proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 harboring the pRARE plasmid that contains the genes for the
expression of rare tRNAs (Fig. 1, initial experiments using

a BL21 strain lacking the pRARE plasmid resulted in little
to no expression). Fractionation of the crude extracts into
soluble and insoluble (presumably inclusion bodies) fractions revealed the B. bassiana proteins to be largely in the
insoluble fraction (Fig. 2). In some instances, induction of
the pET:Bb-Eno1 clone by IPTG resulted in the production
of two bands, the first having the expected mass of 47 kDa
and a second smaller band with a mass ≈45 kDa (Fig 1,
lane 2). Similarly, the Bb-F2 clone also appeared to produce two protein bands of ≈28 kDa (Figure 1, lane 4). Further experimentation revealed that these bands were due
to cleavage during heat denatuation (Fig 3).
IgE immunoblot analysis of recombinant proteins
Immunoblots were used in order to determine whether
human IgEs could bind the recombinant B. bassiana proteins. Crude E. coli extracts containing the expressed proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF
membranes as described in the Methods. Initial experiments were performed using blots containing the four
expressed proteins as well as a crude B. bassiana extract
(positive control), that were probed with one of two sera
pools containing serum from ten patients each, pools A-J

and K-T (Fig. 4). Each blot was treated with 0.2 ml of each
serum (1:35 dilution, final concentration). The blot
probed with pool A-J revealed strong IgE binding of the
two protein bands corresponding to BbEno1, as well as
several reactive (background) E. coli bands. The B. bassiana
crude extract reacted with a variety of IgEs present in the
sera as has been previously reported. From the sera tested,
faint IgE binding to Bb-Ald was noted, with no visible IgE
binding observed for Bb-f2 and Bb-Hex. Control blots
using E. coli crude extracts derived from cells harboring
the vector with no insert resulted in essentially the same
background bands as seen with extracts containing the
expressed proteins.
In order to confirm the binding of IgEs to Bb-Ald, additional experiments using smaller sera pools and higher
final concentrations of individual sera were performed.
Five sera pools, each containing 1:5 dilutions of two sera,
and designated as AB, CD, EF, GH, IJ, KL, MN, OP, QR,
and ST were created. In one set of experiments pools AB,
CD, EF, GH, and IJ were then used to probe membranes

experiments). These results confirmed IgE binding to BbEno1 (strong signal from pools AB and EF, with weaker
signal from pool GH) and to Bb-Ald (pools AB and GH).
Not too surprisingly, IgE binding of "background bands",
i.e. antigens derived from the E. coli extracts were highly
variable between pools. Using these sera pools, no IgE
binding was observed to Bb-f2. In a second series of experiments the pools were used to probe membrane strips
containing only Bb-Ald extracts. IgE binding of Bb-Ald
was noted using pools AB, GH, OP, and ST (Fig. 6). Since
pool AB resulted in strong signals to both Bb-Eno1 and
Bb-Ald, further experiments were performed using the
individual sera (either A or B) to probe membranes containing all four B. bassiana recombinant proteins (Fig 7).
These results revealed that serum A contained IgEs that
bound to Bb-Eno1 and Bb-Ald, whereas serum B contained IgEs reactive only to Bb-Eno1.
Phylogenetic analyses
Bb-Eno1 displayed high sequence similarity to fungal
enolases several of which are known allergens. A phylogram was constructed using the amino acid sequences of
21 fungal enolases as well as those of Drosophila melanogaster, E. coli, and the rubber plant, Hevea brasiliensis, a
known potent allergen (Fig. 8). Of the enolases examined,
nine have been identified as allergens (designated with an
asterisk in the figure). These proteins do not appear to
cluster in any discernable pattern and are equally distributed throughout the phylogram. Similarly, an analysis of
the available fungal aldehyde dehydrogenases failed to

Allergy is a hypersensitive response of the immune system
and fungi are important triggers of respiratory and other
forms of allergies [5,33-35]. As alternatives to chemical
pesticides, entomopathogenic fungi such as Metarhizium
anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana hold promise as biological control agents, and both organisms have been EPA
approved for commercial control of a variety of arthropod
pests [8-11]. The process of fungal infection of insect targets involves the use of infectious propagules, typically
(conidia) spores, which attach and germinate across host
surfaces. Growing fungal cells then begin to penetrate the
cuticle and proliferate within the insect body, ultimately
resulting in the death of the host [6,36,37]. Use of these
biological pesticides, however, is likely to lead to the dispersal of inhalable fungal particles. Several studies have
demonstrated the potential of these fungi in eliciting allergic reactions. [12,14,38]. Some occupational allergy to M.
anisopliae has been noted and immune and pulmonary
responses characteristic of allergy were observed in Balb/c
mice challenged with M. anisopliae extracts [39,40]. Furthermore, allergen-triggered airway hyperresponsiveness
and lung pathology occurred in mice sensitized with this
fungus [41]. The allergenic potential of B. bassiana has
been confirmed by intradermal skin testing, and numerous IgE reactive proteins, some of which are cross-reactive
among allergens from other fungi have been noted in this
organism [14]. To date, however, there have been no
reports detailing the molecular identification of B. bassiana (or M. anisopliae) IgE-reactive antigens.
The present study describes the cloning and expression of
four putative B. bassiana allergens and demonstrated IgEreactivity for two of the recombinant proteins using sera
derived from patients displaying mold allergies. Bb-Eno1
has a calculated monomer molecular mass of 47.4 kDa
and displays similarity to enolases that form an extensively studied group of allergens. IgE cross reactivity
between the enolases of C. herbarum, A. alternata, C. albicans, and A. fumigatus has been well characterized and it is
likely that the B. bassiana protein would also be recognized by the same IgEs. Modeling of the C herbarum enolase using the solved crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae
enolase was used to construct 10 recombinant peptides
spanning the length of the C. herbarum enolase [42]. Six of
these peptides, distributed throughout the entire length of
the protein showed IgE-binding activity. One of the peptides encompassed a region that overlapped with the
other 5 IgE reactive peptides and formed, based upon the
modeling, an extended structure that twice spanned the
body of the globular protein and reached the surface three
times. This sequence was therefore deemed contain at

the deduced B. bassiana enolase sequence. Approximately
20% of the sera tested (4–6/20) displayed positive IgE
reactivity to the recombinant Bb-Eno1, indicating that this
protein is likely to be a significant allergen in B. bassiana.
Bb-Ald was similar to the A. alternata Alt a 10 and C. herbarum Cla h 3 proteins, both of which have been characterized as aldehyde dehydrogenases [18]. In a survey of
allergens recognized by patients with mold allergies, 2%
displayed IgE reactivity to Alt a 10, whereas 36% displayed
reactivity to Cla h 3 [18]. Based upon these results, Cla h
3 was classified as an important allergen and Alt a 10 as a
minor allergen. Only one (out of twenty) of our sera displayed strong reactivity to Bb-Ald, indicating that this protein is indeed an allergen, however due to our small

sample size, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the importance of this protein as a B.
bassiana allergen.
Bb-f2 showed sequence homologies to the A. fumigatus
Asp f2 major allergen and the fibrinogen binding protein
from C. albicans [43]. In A. fumigatus, Asp f2 appears to be
expressed as a 55-kDa mycelial glycoprotein as well as a
37-kDa culture filtrate presumably deglycosylated protein
(the calculated molecular mass of Asp f2 is 29 kDa, the
reason for the discrepancy is unclear but may be attributed
to specific C-terminal amino acid residues), both of which
are IgE reactive [31]. Asp f2 also appears to interact with
extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin, and exhibited IgE binding from sera derived from patients with
allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and cyctic fibrosis-ABPA patients, but not from sera isolated from

A. fumigatus-sensitized allergic asthma (and normal control subjects) [31]. Thus, the observed lack of IgE reactivity
to Bb-f2 may be attributed to the lack of ABPA patients in
our sera samples.
The original cDNA fragment corresponding to Bb-Hex displayed the highest similarity to the N-acetylhexosaminidase of P. chrysogenum (Pen ch 20), that has been
identified as an allergen [32]. Subsequent, full length
cDNA cloning and characterization resulted in higher
similarity to other fungal hexosaminidases that have not
been characterized as allergens (see E-values in Table 2).
None of our sera samples displayed IgE reactivity to
recombinant Bb-Hex, however, due to our low sample
size the possibility cannot be excluded that this protein
represents a B. bassiana allergen.

Our results confirm the potential allergenicity of B. bassiana by the molecular and immunological characterization
of specific allergens from this organism and suggest that
some precautions should be taken into account in biological control applications using entomopathogenic fungi.
It is, however, important not to overstate the potential
risks (versus benefits) and the overall safety with respect
to allergenicity of these fungi may be similar to that of
baker's yeast from which allergens, including enolase,
have also been isolated [44,45]. While it is not possible to
determine the fraction of the total allergen production the
four isolated proteins represents, immunoblot comparisons between the isolated proteins and the reactivity of
crude B. bassiana extracts indicated the presence of numerous additional allergens that have yet to be characterized,
some of which may represent more highly antigenic
epitopes. The isolation of putative B. bassiana allergens
described in this report relied upon identifying molecules
by the resemblance of their DNA sequences to previously
identified allergens and future experiments using alternate approaches (e.g. phage display [46]) may be needed
to identify additional allergens. Finally, although much
work has been performed in regards to isolating and characterizing fungal allergens, the roles of these proteins in
fungal processes such as development and pathogenesis
remains obscure. As a genetically amenable organism and
a pathogen of arthropods, B. bassiana represents a novel
system to examine the relationship between allergenicity
and (insect) pathogenesis. Targeted gene-knockouts, for
instance, can be used to probe affects upon virulence and
interactions between specific allergen and arthropod
innate immune systems.

Conclusion
Cloning, sequencing, and heterologous expression of four
putative B. bassiana allergens was performed. Recombinant proteins corresponding to Bb-Eno1 and Bb-Ald,
but not Bb-f2 and Bb-Hex, displayed IgEs reactivity
against sera from patients with mold allergies. Due to the
low sera sample numbers used, it cannot be excluded that
Bb-f2 and Bb-Hex are allergens, and further testing is warranted. Bb-Eno1 was similar to enolases that represent a
well characterized group of major allergens. Bb-Ald was
similar to aldehyde dehydrogenases that are considered
major allergens in some fungal species, but minor allergens in others. The molecular identification of B. bassiana
allergens can lead diagnostic methods for determining
sensitization to this organism and provides a rational
basis for allergen attenuation in order to yield safer biological control products. The B. bassiana-arthropod interaction may represent a novel model system to examine
the relationships between allergenicity and pathogenicity.
