Abstract
Background: Over recent years, enzymes of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C subfamily have
been implicated in the progression of prostate, breast, endometrial and leukemic cancers. This is
due to the ability of AKR1C enzymes to modify androgens, estrogens, progesterone and
prostaglandins (PGs) in a tissue-specific manner, regulating the activity of nuclear receptors and
other downstream effects. Evidence supporting a role for AKR1C enzymes in cancer derives
mostly from studies with isolated primary cells from patients or immortalized cell lines. Mice are
ideal organisms for in vivo studies, using knock-out or over-expression strains. However, the
functional conservation of AKR1C enzymes between human and mice has yet to be described.
Results: In this study, we have characterized and compared the four human (AKR1C1,-1C2, -1C3
and -1C4) and the eight murine (AKR1C6, -1C12, -1C13, -1C14, -1C18, -1C19, -1C20 and -1C21)
isoforms in their phylogeny, substrate preference and tissue distribution. We have found divergent
evolution between human and murine AKR1C enzymes that was reflected by differing substrate
preference. Murine enzymes did not perform the 11β-ketoreduction of prostaglandin (PG) D2, an
activity specific to human AKR1C3 and important in promoting leukemic cell survival. Instead,
murine AKR1C6 was able to perform the 9-ketoreduction of PGE2, an activity absent amongst
human isoforms. Nevertheless, reduction of the key steroids androstenedione, 5αdihydrotestosterone, progesterone and estrone was found in murine isoforms. However, unlike
humans, no AKR1C isoforms were detected in murine prostate, testes, uterus and haemopoietic
progenitors.
Conclusions: This study exposes significant lack of phylogenetic and functional homology between
human and murine AKR1C enzymes. Therefore, we conclude that mice are not suitable to model
the role of AKR1C in human cancers and leukemia.

Background
Aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) are a large superfamily of
~37 kDa enzymes present in bacteria, protozoa, fungi,
plants and animals [1-3]. In spite of their highly conserved (α/β)8-barrel structure, AKRs perform the
NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of carbonyl groups in a
wide variety of substrates and therefore have diverse physiological roles [3]. To date, more than 150 proteins have
been assigned to the superfamily, currently divided into
15 families (AKR1-AKR15) listed at the AKR homepage
http://www.med.upenn.edu/akr/[2].
In recent years, members of the AKR1C subfamily have
been implicated in the development of human cancers
due to their ability to modify steroid hormones and prostaglandins (PGs) [4-7] (Fig. 1). Four AKR1C isoforms exist
in humans (AKR1C1-AKR1C4) and their respective genes
are clustered on chromosome 10p14 (Fig. 2b) [5,8]. In
spite of their high sequence homology (>86% amino-acid
identity) human AKR1Cs have different substrate preferences and tissue distribution. All isoforms are expressed in
the liver and AKR1C4 is restricted to this tissue. The
remaining AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 have a wider
expression pattern including prostate, testes, uterus,
mammary gland and haemopoietic progenitors [9-11].
In the prostate, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 play a key role in
regulating activation of the androgen receptor
(AR)[5,12,13] (Fig 1). AKR1C2 inactivates the potent AR
ligand 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) by converting it
to 3α-adiol (weak AR ligand) [13,14]. On the other hand,
AKR1C3 converts androstene-3,17-dione (androstenedione) to testosterone which can activate AR or be further
converted to 5α-DHT by the 5α-reductase [5,15]. In fact,
mRNA for AKR1C3 and AKR1C2 was found to be upregulated by 4-fold and 2-fold, respectively, in metastatic

androgen-independent prostate tumours relative to its
primary androgen-dependent counterparts, suggesting a
role of these enzymes in the progression of the disease
[16]. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the upregulation of AKR1C3 protein in prostate
tumours relative to normal tissue [12,16,17]. Therefore it
is hypothesized that in the prostate AKR1C enzymes promote an androgenic environment beneficial for tumour
progression.
AKR1C3 is also highly expressed in the mammary gland
where it is thought to promote a pro-estrogenic environment (Fig. 1). In this tissue, the concerted actions of
CYP19 aromatase and AKR1C3 result in the generation of
estrone and estradiol and consequent activation of the
estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) [5,18]. In addition,
both AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 can convert progesterone to
its inactive form 20α-hydroxyprogesterone diminishing
the activation of the progesterone receptor (PR) and altering the progesterone:estrogen ratio [5,18]. As observed in
prostate tumours, AKR1C3 is commonly over-expressed
in malignant breast tissues [5,17]. Recently, the pro-estrogenic actions of AKR1C1 and AKR1C3 have also been
implicated in the deregulated endometrium growth as
both enzymes were found to be upregulated in tumour tissues relative to their adjacent normal counterparts [19].
The pro-survival properties of AKR1C enzymes are not
solely related to steroid metabolism. Normal CD34+
human myeloid progenitors express AKR1C1, -1C2 and 1C3 expression, the latter being largely dominant [10].
High expression of AKR1C3 was also found in primary
acute myeloid leukemic cells [10]. In malignant cells,
chemical inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of
AKR1C3 resulted in increased sensitivity to differentiation
while over-expression of AKR1C3 rendered the cells more

resistant [7,10,20-22]. This anti-differentiative action of
AKR1C3 was shown to rely on its ability to perform the
11β-ketoreduction of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) to 11βPGF2α, also known as PGF synthase (PGFS) activity
[22,23] (Fig. 1). By mediating the conversion to 11βPGF2α, AKR1C3 prevents the spontaneous dehydration of
PGD2 into the J-series prostaglandins, ultimately generating 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) [24]. The intracellular generation of 15d-PGJ2 has potent anti-neoplastic
activities such as inhibition of NF-κB signalling, activation
of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
and generation of reactive oxygen species [24,25]. Thus, in
malignant cells AKR1C3 protects from the pro-differentiative effects of endogenously generated 15d-PGJ2.
These implications in cancer biology have sparked clinical
interest in the human AKR1C enzymes. Recent efforts in
developing isoform specific inhibitors reflect the potential
therapeutic application of these enzymes [4,14,18,26].
Despite the large amount of evidence supporting roles for
AKR1C enzymes in cancer, data regarding animal models
and whole-organism in vivo studies are still absent. Ideally, transgenic mouse strains would inform about the
physiological roles of AKR1C enzymes in breast, prostate,
endometrial and haemopoietic tissues. In 2002, a
genomic cluster on mouse chromosome 13 was described
harbouring eight murine AKR1C genes: Akr1c6, Akr1c12,
Akr1c13, Akr1c14, Akr1c18, Akr1c19, Akr1c20 and Akr1c21
[27]. The encoded proteins share between 64 and 76%
sequence identity with the human isoforms. However,
identification of homologues by a systematic comparison
of murine and human AKR1C enzymes has yet to be performed.
In this study we characterized and compared the murine
and human AKR1C enzymes, by focusing on phylogeny,
substrate preference and tissue expression. We found significant evolutionary divergence between enzymes of the
two species which was reflected in their divergent substrate preferences. None of the murine enzymes shared
the PGD2 11β-ketoreductase activity of AKR1C3. However
murine AKR1C6, was able to reduce PGE2 to PGF2α, an
activity absent in the remaining human and mouse isoforms. Also, the preference for the steroid substrates
androstenedione, progesterone, estrone and 5α-DHT
revealed no clear functional homologies between human
and mouse isoforms. Notably, AKR1C18 inactivated 5αDHT to 3α-adiol with high efficiency. The divergence was
also observed in tissue expression pattern, with absent or
very low expression of the murine enzymes in prostate,
testes and uterus. In summary, this study exposes the lack
of homology between human and mouse AKR1C
enzymes identifying the mouse as a poor model for studying the role of these enzymes in human cancer.

Results
Phylogenetic divergence between human and murine
AKR1C enzymes
In order to identify evolutionary homologies between
human and murine AKR1C enzymes we aligned the
amino-acid sequences of the 23 known members of the
subfamily and generated a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2a). The
four human isoforms are closely related (with an average
of 88.3% sequence identity amongst them) indicating a
recent common ancestor. In contrast, the eight murine
enzymes show higher variability (average of 69.8%
sequence identity amongst them) implying divergence
from an earlier common ancestor. Similar diversity is also
observed for the closely related rat enzymes. No obvious
evolutionary parallels could be established between individual human and murine enzymes suggesting low conservation between the two species. Interestingly,
organization of the AKR1C genes in both the human and
murine genomic cluster strongly correlates with their phylogeny, with highly related genes sitting in close proximity
on the chromosome (Fig. 2b). In summary, the phylogeny
of the AKR1C subfamily suggests a divergent evolutionary
path between human and murine enzymes.
Murine and human AKR1C enzymes differ in the usage of
prostaglandins and steroids as substrates
Even though homologies between human and murine
isoforms could not be established by sequence comparison, functional homologues may occur in terms of enzymatic activity. Therefore we generated purified
recombinant proteins for all human and murine AKR1C
enzymes (Fig. 3) and screened for reduction of prostaglandin and steroid substrates previously implied in tumour
generation or progression. All purified proteins were able
to reduce the pan-substrate 9, 10-phenanthrenequinone
(4 μM) with velocities ranging between 890 and 450

nmol.min-1.mg-1 and were thus assumed to be correctly
folded and functional.
Using radiolabelled substrate, we tested for the 11βketoreduction of PGD2 into 11β-PGF2α, an activity that
amongst the human enzymes is specific to AKR1C3 and
relevant to myeloid leukemic cell survival. Surprisingly,
none of the murine enzymes was able to reduce PGD2
confirming the absence of an AKR1C3 functional homologue amongst the murine isoforms. PGF2α, a stereoisomer of 11β-PGF2α, is also a product of PGE2 and PGH2
reduction [28]. Both F2α isomers stimulate the FP receptor
and may also play a role in disease progression [29].
Therefore, we screened for the 9-ketoreduction of PGE2
and the 9,11-endoperoxide reduction of PGH2.
Reduction of PGH2 was not detected with any murine
AKR1C enzymes whereas murine AKR1C6 was the only
isoform able to reduce PGE2, generating a product that co-

migrates with PGF2α in thin layer chromatography (TLC).
The reaction had low affinity (Km = 73.1 ± 19.9 μM) and
low speed of turn-over (kcat 0.24 ± 0.03 min-1), resulting in
an equally low catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km = 3 min-1.mM1).
Reduction of steroid hormones was measured using a
spectophotometric assay (results are summarized in Table
1). Androstenedione (adione) was reduced by all human
enzymes, with AKR1C2 and AKR1C4 being the most efficient (kcat/Km = 795 and 627 min-1.mM-1, respectively).
Murine AKR1C6 and AKR1C21 were the only isoforms
with detectable adione reduction activity. However, the
kinetic profile of AKR1C21 did not fit a Michaelis-Menten
curve, with reaction velocities increasing until ~6 μM adione (~4 min-1) followed by a decrease. Reduction of
estrone to 17β-estradiol was not detected amongst the
human enzymes. However, murine AKR1C6 and
AKR1C18 were able to reduce estrone with relatively high

efficiency (kcat/Km = 452 and 652 min-1.mM-1, respectively). Reduction of progesterone to its 20α-hydroxy
form was detected with AKR1C4, -1C3 and -1C1, the latter
being the most efficient (kcat/Km = 421 min-1.mM-1).
Amongst the murine isoforms, AKR1C6, -1C18 and -1C20
were able to reduce progesterone with different efficiencies (kcat/Km = 192, 1080 and 138 min-1.mM-1, respectively). It should be noted that in spite of its relatively low
affinity (Km = 105.7 μM) AKR1C18 showed rapid turn
over of progesterone (114.12 min-1). Reduction of 5αDHT was detected for all human isoforms except AKR1C3.
Efficiency was highest with AKR1C4, followed by -1C2
and -1C1 (kcat/Km = 1096, 472 and 146 min-1.mM-1,
respectively). Murine AKR1C18 was capable of reducing
5α-DHT with extremely high efficiency (kcat/Km = 5746
min-1.mM-1). AKR1C6 and AKR1C21 also showed activity
towards 5α-DHT but, once again, the kinetic profile of
AKR1C21 did not fit a Michaelis-Menten curve with reaction velocity peaking at ~15 μM (~4 min-1) followed by a
decrease with higher substrate concentrations.
We have also assessed 5α-DHT reduction using radiolabelled substrate. This is a more sensitive method that
allows the detection of lower activities as well as types of
products formed during the reaction. Enzymes were incubated with 25 μM 5α-DHT and the percentage of substrate
reduced to product was measured at 30 and 90 minutes
(Fig. 4). All AKR1C isoforms except AKR1C19 and -1C20
were able to reduce 5α-DHT. In agreement with the spectrophotometric assay, AKR1C1, -1C2, -1C4, -1C18 and 1C21 were the most efficient in reducing 5α-DHT
(between 50 and 100% substrate reduction at 30 min-

utes). AKR1C6 showed an intermediate efficiency whilst
AKR1C3, -1C12, -1C13, -1C14 reduced 5α-DHT at a slow
rate. Most enzymes reduced 5α-DHT to 3α-adiol with the
exception of AKR1C1 that produced 3β-adiol, AKR1C4
that produced a mixture of both these stereoisomers and
AKR1C21 that generated an alternative product that did
not co-migrate with 3α- or 3β-adiol.
Importantly, the above analyses did not reveal any clear
homologies in substrate preference between human and
murine AKR1C enzymes, underlining the divergent evolutionary history of these proteins.
Human and murine AKR1C enzymes have different tissue
expression patterns
Besides being expressed in the liver, human AKR1C
enzymes are also found in steroid hormone-sensitive tissues such as prostate, testis, uterus and mammary gland,
where they are believed to regulate steroid metabolism
[9]. We measured the expression of the eight murine
AKR1C genes and two house-keeping genes (Gapdh and
18S ribosomal RNA) in several mouse tissues using quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 5). Since the expression of
Gapdh was found to be more variable amongst the analysed tissues, levels of 18S were used as a loading control
reference. Most AKR1C genes were found to be expressed
in the liver, particularly Akr1c6 and -1c20 which were
detected exclusively in this tissue. Tissue specificity was
also observed for Akr1c21, detected only in the kidney.
Progesterone-inactivating Akr1c18 was highly expressed
in the ovaries of non-pregnant mice but was absent in
ovaries of pregnant mice. The closely related Akr1c12, 1c13 and -1c19 were detected mainly in gastrointestinal
tissues (stomach, small intestine and colon), though the
expression levels of Akr1c13 were quite reduced. Akr1c14
showed a broader tissue distribution being detected in
liver, lung, stomach, colon, kidney, uterus and ovary. Surprisingly, very low or no expression of AKR1C isoforms
was detected in prostate, testes and uterus. We also
screened for AKR1C expression in the mouse haemopoietic progenitor cell line HPC-7 [30,31] but none of the
isoforms was detected. This result further suggests a different role of AKR1C enzymes in murine physiology.

Discussion
The increasing interest in the role of AKR1C enzymes in
cancer has brought the need for genetically modified animal models. The mouse is a powerful model organism for
the study of cancer and has provided important evidence
on the physiological role of many cancer-related genes. In
this study we have attempted to identify homologies
between human and murine AKR1C isoforms, a first step
towards generating animal models. However, our results
have exposed a substantial lack of homology between

enzymes of the two species in terms of phylogeny, function and tissue expression.
Amino-acid sequence alignment of all known AKR1C
enzymes confirmed the close evolutionary kinship of the
four human AKR1C enzymes as opposed to the far more
diverse murine isoforms. Previously described evolutionary homologues were also identified in the phylogram
(Fig. 2a). For instance, AKR1C25, an enzyme from
macaque liver, is the homologue of human AKR1C4 in
substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity [32]. Also,
murine AKR1C18 and rat AKR1C8 are known homologues for their ability to convert progesterone to 20αhydroxyprogesterone in the ovary [33,34]. Such parallelisms were not observed between human and murine
enzymes, and therefore appear to be limited to closely
related species (human and macaque; rat and mouse).
Overall, this analysis implies that AKR1C enzymes have

diverged significantly between mice and humans since
their latest common ancestor. In their enlarged array of
AKR1C enzymes, mice have three isoforms more closely
related to the human proteins (AKR1C6, -1C20 and 1C21), and two other subgroups that appear to have
ancestral origins in the subfamily (AKR1C18 and -1C14; 1C12, -1C13 and -1C19). This phylogeny is impressively
recapitulated by the position of the respective AKR1C
genes in the genomic cluster (Fig. 2b), a likely record of
the gene duplication history.
In this study we have also characterized murine and
human AKR1C enzymes in terms of their substrate preference and tissue expression. Importantly, all enzymatic
assays were performed in identical conditions in order to
enhance comparability. The first striking finding is the
absence of a PGD2 reductase amongst murine enzymes. In

poietic progenitors AKR1C3 regulates cell survival and differentiation by limiting the conversion of PGD2 to 15dPGJ2. Indeed the bone marrow, where the haemopoietic
progenitors reside, was shown to be a PGD2 rich-environment in rodents [35]. However, the absence of an
AKR1C3 homologue in mice suggests that the protection
from PGD2 is either performed by another group of
enzymes (AKR or non-AKR) or does not exist at all in
murine haemopoietic progenitors. This hypothesis is further supported by the absence of AKR1C expression in the
murine haemopoietic progenitor cell line HPC-7. These
results demonstrate that mice can not be used to model
the role of AKR1C enzymes in myeloid leukaemia.
We have also shown for the first time that AKR1C6 has
PGE2 reductase activity. This activity is not present in the
human isoforms but has been attributed to rabbit
AKR1C5 [36]. Although recombinant AKR1C6 reduced
PGE2 with poor efficiency (kcat/Km = 3 min-1.mM-1) these
parameters are comparable to those of AKR1C5. Reduction of PGE2 can locally modify the PGE2/PGF2α signalling
ratio. This is particularly important during female estrous
cycle and parturition, where increased PGF2α levels induce
degeneration of the corpus luteum and uterine contraction, respectively [37]. Also, increased PGE2 levels have
been implicated in promoting colon cancer progression
[38]. Reduction of the prostanoid precursor PGH2 also
results in PGF2α. However, this activity was not detected
with murine AKR1C enzymes.
The lack of parallelism was also extended to steroid turnover. While most human AKR1C enzymes showed activity
against androgens (androstenedione and 5α-DHT), only
a small number of murine isoforms performed these
activities. AKR1C21 and AKR1C6 were active towards
androstenedione and 5α-DHT while AKR1C18 showed
strong activity towards 5α-DHT only. But while the
human isoforms are highly expressed in testes and prostate, AKR1C6, -1C21 and -1C18 are not, being instead
restricted to liver, kidney and ovary, respectively. Therefore, despite the existence of androgen modifying AKR1C
enzymes in mice, these activities are not located in the
expected androgen-sensitive tissues.
Estrone reduction was not detected with any human
enzyme using the spectrophotometric assay. However,
previous reports have shown this activity using radiolabelled substrates with purified recombinant enzymes or
cell lines over-expressing AKR1C3 [9,18]. Nevertheless,
estrone reduction was easily detected with AKR1C6 and
AKR1C18 despite neither enzyme is expressed in the
uterus. However, AKR1C18 is highly expressed in the nonpregnant ovary where the pro-estrogenic production of
estradiol might play a role.

Amongst the human enzymes, AKR1C1 showed the highest activity against progesterone as reported previously
[9]. Murine AKR1C6, -1C18 and -1C20 also displayed this
activity. AKR1C18 was previously shown to inactivate
progesterone in endometrial and ovarian cells [33].
Expression of AKR1C18 in these tissues is suppressed during pregnancy and progesterone levels remain high. In the
late stages of pregnancy AKR1C18 is re-expressed in the
ovaries and uterus where it mediates the rapid inactivation of progesterone, leading to parturition [33,34]. In
agreement with this, we have shown high expression of
Akr1c18 mRNA in the ovary of pregnant mice but not in
the ovaries of non-pregnant mice. AKR1C18 is also the
only member of the subfamily targeted in knock-out studies [39]. Mice lacking AKR1C18 were viable but sustained
high progesterone levels at the end of pregnancy resulting
in delayed parturition. It should be noted that we showed
here for the first time that AKR1C18 also has potent 5αDHT and estrone reductase activity, thus contributing to a
pro-estrogenic and anti-androgenic environment in the
ovary. Liver-restricted AKR1C20 also showed activity
against progesterone and might function as a slow inactivator of circulating progesterone. Nevertheless, the comparison revealed no clear homologies between human
and murine enzymes involved in estrogen production and
progesterone inactivation.
It is worth noting that AKR1C6 was able to reduce most of
the substrates tested showing 3-, 17- and 20-ketoreduction activity against steroids and 9-ketoreduction against
prostaglandins. Such promiscuity of this liver restricted
enzyme suggests that AKR1C6 can accommodate a wide
variety of substrates. Therefore, it might function as a
multi-purpose detoxifying enzyme against xenobiotics.
On the other hand, AKR1C12, -1C13, -1C14 and -1C19
were poorly active or inactive towards the tested substrates. Our results and previous reports have shown
expression of these enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract
[27,40] where they are possibly involved in reducing
exogenous dietary compounds.
In this study, reduction of steroid substrates was assessed
using mainly a spectrophotometric assay. This method
measures the real-time consumption of NADPH in the
presence of substrates and can easily be applied to a high
number of enzyme/substrate combinations. However,
this assay does not inform about the type of products generated in the reaction and its sensitivity is limited. Therefore, slower activities (with low Km and kcat) might be
undetected. To address this we used a radiometric assay
for 5α-DHT which allows for detection of modifications
of the steroid substrate. In consistence with the spectrophotometric data, AKR1C1, -1C2, -1C4, -1C18 and -1C21
rapidly reduced 5α-DHT, with AKR1C6 showing lower
activity (Fig. 4). However, the reduced activities of

Page 8 of 12

Molecular Cancer 2009, 8:121

AKR1C3, -1C12, -1C13 and -1C14 against 5α-DHT were
only detected using the radiometric method. This exposes
the limitations of the spectrophotometric assay and alerts
for a critical analysis of the presented substrate preferences
since lower activities against androstenedione, progesterone and estrone might have been undetected. While most
AKR1C enzymes catalyzed the reduction of 5α-DHT to
3α-adiol, incubation with AKR1C1 resulted in production
of the stereoisomer 3β-adiol while AKR1C4 produced a
mixture of both isomers as previously reported [15]. Confirming the divergence between human and murine
AKR1C isoforms, none of the murine enzymes produced
3β-adiol. However, AKR1C21 converted 5α-DHT into an
unknown product that did not co-migrate with 3α- or 3βadiol. A non-Michaelis-Menten kinetics towards androstenedione and 5α-DHT was also observed for AKR1C21
(Table 1) underlining its unusual behaviour compared to
the remaining AKR1C enzymes. These differences may
relate to its ability to bind steroids differently as described
previously [41]. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that
some parameters of the enzymatic activities of human isoforms shown here differ from previous reports [9,12]. This
is likely due to technical differences in the enzymatic
assays.

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/121

This study also reveals new and interesting properties of
the AKR1C subfamily. Despite being part of a highly conserved superfamily, AKR1C genes retain significant variability in gene number and sequence between species of
the same class (mammalia). This may suggest that the
functions of AKR1C enzymes are not strictly conserved in
all mammals, instead adapting to the species evolutionary
demands.

Conclusions
Our study has demonstrated that the mouse is a poor system to model the role of AKR1C in cancer, due to the lack
of functional conservation of the enzymes. Further investigations on this topic should consider animal models
closer to the primates, especially when it comes to test
new potential anti-cancer drugs.

Multiple alignments of AKR1C proteins
AKR1C amino-acid sequences were obtained from the
AKR homepage http://www.med.upenn.edu/akr/[2] and
aligned using ClustalX2 http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/fr/Docu
mentation/ClustalX/[42]. Phylogenetic tree was generated

ogy.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/treeviewx with random number generator of 111 and number of bootstrap trials of 1000.
Production of purified recombinant AKR1C enzymes
The coding regions of human AKR1C1, -1C2, -1C3, -1C4
and murine Akr1c6, -1c12, -1c13, -1c14, -1c18, -1c19, -1c20
and -1c21 were amplified from several cDNA sources (tissues and cell lines) using an RT-PCR strategy. Primers
introduced a 3' NdeI restriction site coincident with the
ATG start codon and a 5' XhoI site before the stop codon.
Coding regions were cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites
of pET28b(+) vector (Novagen, Nottingham, UK) and
nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing. The
expression plasmid incorporates an N-terminal histidine
(6 × His) tag to aid purification. For expression, the plasmid transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen).
Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified using
"His-bind" resin as described previously [43]. Purity of
the extracted protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE stained
with Coomassie Blue. PQ turn-over was used to confirm
enzymatic activity using the spectrophotometric assay
described below.

http://www.molecular-cancer.com/content/8/1/121

The TLC plates were completely dried between separations.
A spectrophotometric assay was used to measure PQ,
androstenedione, progesterone, estrone and 5α-DHT
reduction. Reaction mix contained 150 μM NADPH, various concentrations of substrates (50 - 0.781 μM) and 15
μg/ml recombinant enzyme in 1 ml of 50 mM KH2PO4
buffer (pH 6.5). Reactions were initiated by addition of
enzyme and the reaction followed at 37°C by monitoring
the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm of the cofactor (ε =
6220 M-1.cm-1). For each reaction, kinetic parameters
were obtained by fitting the data to a Michaelis-Menten
curve, using the VisualEnzymics software (SoftZymics).
Tissue expression analysis
Three adult male, three adult non-pregnant female and
three adult pregnant female CD1 mice were sacrificed for
the dissection of spleen, liver, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, kidney, prostate, testes, uterus and ovary (in
triplicate). RNA was extracted from the tissues using the
RNeasy kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) and cDNA produced by reverse-transcription PCR. Quantitative RealTime (QRT)-PCR for each sample was performed in triplicate 20 μl reactions using standard cycle conditions for 44
cycles on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector (Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Gene specific primers and
TaqMan probes were designed using Primer Express software (ABI Prism) and specificity was tested using the
cloned coding regions of each isoform. Sequences are
shown in Table 2. TaqMan probes and QRT-PCR mix were
purchased from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Gene
expression in each sample was normalized to 18S expression using the following equation: (2-(CTgene-CT18S)) × 106.

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Enzymatic assays
Prostaglandin and 5α-DHT reduction was measured using
a radiochemical assay. Reaction mix was composed of 150
μM NADPH, 0.2 μCi of either [3H]-PGD2, [3H]-PGE2 or
[3H]-PGH2 and 35 μg/ml of recombinant enzyme in 0.2
ml of 50 mM KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.5). Reactions were initiated upon addition of enzyme and were incubated at
37°C for 2 hours (10 minutes for PGH2). For determination of AKR1C6/PGE2 enzyme kinetics, various concentrations of cold PGE2 were mixed with 0.2 μCi [3H]-PGE2.
For the reduction of 5α-DHT, 25 μM of cold steroid were
mixed with 1 μCi [3H]-5α-DHT. Reactions were stopped
at desired time-points by addition of methanol and initiation of the extraction protocol. PGs and steroids were
extracted, separated and detected as described previously
[44]. For optimal separation of 5α-DHT products, the TLC
plates were developed thrice in the same solvent solution.
