Abstract
Background: Computational methods for identifying selenoproteins have been developed rapidly in recent years.
However, it is still difficult to identify the open reading frame (ORF) of eukaryotic selenoprotein gene, because the TGA
codon for a selenocysteine (Sec) residue in the active centre of selenoprotein is traditionally a terminal signal of protein
translation. Although the identification of selenoproteins from genomes through bioinformatics methods has been
conducted in bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes, insects and several vertebrates, only a few results have been reported on
the ancient chordate selenoproteins.
Results: A gene assembly algorithm SelGenAmic has been constructed and presented in this study for identifying
selenoprotein genes from eukaryotic genomes. A method based on this algorithm was developed to build an optimal
TGA-containing-ORF for each TGA in a genome, followed by protein similarity analysis through conserved sequence
alignments to screen out selenoprotein genes form these ORFs. This method improved the sensitivity of detecting
selenoproteins from a genome due to the design that all TGAs in the genome were investigated for its possibility of
decoding as a Sec residue. Using this method, eighteen selenoprotein genes were identified from the genome of
Ciona intestinalis, leading to its member of selenoproteome up to 19. Among them a selenoprotein W gene was found
to have two SECIS elements in the 3'-untranslated region. Additionally, the disulfide bond formation protein A (DsbA)
was firstly identified as a selenoprotein in the ancient chordates of Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi and Branchiostoma
floridae, while selenoprotein DsbAs had only been found in bacteria and green algae before.
Conclusion: The method based on SelGenAmic algorithm is capable of identifying eukaryotic selenoprotein genes
from their genomes. Application of this method to Ciona intestinalis proves its successes in finding Sec-decoding TGA
from large-scale eukaryotic genome sequences, which fills the gap in our knowledge on the ancient chordate
selenoproteins.
Background
Selenium (Se), an essential trace element in vivo, is closely
linked to Keshan disease, Kaschin-Beck disease, cancer
and virus propagation. It also plays important roles in cell
growth, proliferation and aging. Selenium in vivo is primarily present in various selenoproteins, which generally
function as antioxidants to maintain the balance of redox
state. The active site of selenoprotein is selenocysteine
(Sec or U), the 21st amino acid encoded by a TGA codon
in the open reading frame (ORF) of the gene [1]. Traditionally, TGA codon only signals the termination of protein synthesis; however, it can also be translated into a

Sec residue when a specific stem-loop structure, designated as the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, is
located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of a selenoprotein gene in eukaryotes and archaea, or located immediately downstream of the Sec-decoding TGA
(designated as Sec-TGA) in bacteria [2-5]. The amino
acid sequences flanking the active Sec residue are more
conserved than other regions less functionally or structurally important in selenoproteins. These conserved
regions play key roles in redox balance, metal combination, Sec-Sec/Sec-S bond formation and protein folding
in vivo. Additionally, the Sec residue is highly analogous
to the Cys in biochemical properties, which accounts for
the fact that in most homologs of a selenoprotein the
active Sec is replaced by Cys residues.

Several methods for in silico prediction of selenoprotein genes have been developed over the past decade,
based on the structural characteristics of selenoprotein
genes. These methods have been used separately or
together for the identification of selenoproteins from the
genomes or expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries in
many species, such as human, fish, insects, green algae,
nematodes and protozoa [6-11]. Recent application on
the analyses of environmental metagenomic sequences
have also been succeeded in finding prokaryotic selenoprotein genes [12,13]. To identify selenoprotein genes
from the genome, several computational methods have to
be combined for use, including the methods of RNA secondary-structure prediction, eukaryotic or prokaryotic
ORF prediction, sequence alignment analysis and phylogenetic analysis. With the development and application of
those methods, the size of selenoprotein family is growing, for example, the members of human selenoproteome
increased from 14 to 25. In addition, up to 58 selenoprotein families have been identified recently in the Global
Ocean Sampling (GOS) Project, which shed light on the
evolution of selenoproteins according to their distribution in different species and environments.
For the prediction of selenoprotein genes, it is indispensable to construct complete or partial ORFs containing the Sec-TGA codons. In a non-intron DNA sequence
like prokaryotic genome, it is relatively easy to build a
theoretical ORF containing a TGA codon termed "interrupted ORF" (i-ORF) as shown in Figure 1. However, in
eukaryotic genome, the intron-exon structure of gene
makes it difficult to build an i-ORF. Most of earlier studies on eukaryotic selenoprotein identification were performed by the following scheme. Firstly, RNA prediction
algorithms were used to predict SECIS elements. Secondly, the SECIS elements were used to inform gene prediction algorithms to predict i-ORFs, of which a suitable
SECIS element must be downstream [14]. The disadvantage of this scheme is that if any special-structure SECIS
elements, which has not been discovered so far and
included into the known SECIS models, existed in a
newly sequenced genome, then no SECIS information
can be used to inform the gene prediction algorithms to
find the upstream ORFs. Naturally thinking, to identify
the selenoproteins with special-structure SECIS, it must
be able to predict i-ORFs without the help of SECIS information.

Page 2 of 14

For eukaryotic genome, a SECIS-independent gene prediction approach was previously introduced in 2004 [11].
A modified gene prediction program named geneid was
developed to identify 20 human selenoprotein genes. The
gene assembly algorithm GenAmic used by geneid only
builds the optimal gene structures with the TGA-containing exons having higher coding potential scores. Selenoproteins with lower score TGA-containing exons, such as
human selenoproteins K, S and T, were not identified by
the GenAmic based method. Although the sensitivity of
this SECIS-independent gene prediction approach is high
(20/25), it is not so good as the SECIS-dependent approach
that discovered all 25 human selenoproteins [14]. In this
paper, a new gene assembly algorithm named SelGenAmic
was constructed to develop a similar SECIS-independent
gene prediction method for the identification of selenoproteins. Compared with the GenAmic algorithm used by
geneid, the SelGenAmic is more sensitive because its target is to build an optimal gene structure for each TGA.
Thus no TGA codon is neglected for building i-ORFs.
Finally, amino acid conservation assessment is used to find
the real selenoproteins from these i-ORFs.
While much research has been done on the identification of selenoproteins of lower bacteria, unicellular
eukaryotes, insects and higher vertebrates, only a few
results have been reported for the sea squirts, one of the
closest relatives in between invertebrates and vertebrates.
Sea squirts are widely used for biological research in
post-genomic era [15]. Abundant sequence data from the
sea squirt genome project enable us to investigate selenoprotein distribution in these species, which provides
valuable insights into selenium utilization and selenoprotein gene evolution [16,17]. Additionally, the sea squirt's
worldwide distribution, short life cycle, and even its
transparent body make it a potentially appropriate model
organism for studying eukaryotic selenoproteins. Up to
the present, only a few selenoproteins were found in the
Ciona intestinalis, such as selenoprotein L (SelL), which
was identified from EST sequences [18].
In this study, eighteen selenoproteins of Ciona intestinalis were identified from the genome by the method we
developed according to the SelGenAmic algorithm. Combined with the SelL previously found from EST
sequences, the members of selenoproteome in Ciona
intestinalis increased to 19. Among those selenoproteins,
disulfide bond formation protein A (DsbA) was the first
time to be found as a selenoprotein in multicellular
organisms. Its homologous DsbA in amphioxus and
Ciona savignyi, two other ancient animals, were also
identified to be selenoproteins.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 A buildup of theoretical i-ORF containing a TGA codon
in prokaryotic genomes.

Basic idea

TGA coding for Sec is one of the key characters of selenoprotein genes. If we scan all TGA codons from a genome,

Jiang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:289
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/289

all Sec codons will be included. It is relatively easy to
build a theoretical i-ORF from a prokaryotic genome as
shown in Figure 1. This task can be carried out by finding
a start codon and a stop codon in the nucleotide
sequences flanking any TGA codon. All of i-ORFs can be
translated into amino acid sequences and compared with
known proteins to find potential selenoprotein genes.
This method has been reported to be used for the discovery of rare amino acids, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, in
prokaryotes [19].
However building eukaryotic i-ORFs is much more difficult than that of prokaryotes. Many potential gene prediction signals like start codon ATG, stop codons TGA/
TAA/TAG, and splice sites AG/GT can be found in the
sequences flanking any TGA in a eukaryotic genome. It is
rather complicated to choose suitable signals to build
exons, and consequently suitable exons to build i-ORFs
during selenoprotein identification.
To address this issue, a method was presented in this
study. Firstly, all TGA codons were found from a genome,
and supposed to be signals of Sec. All other signals such
as start codon, stop codon and splice sites are also predicted. Secondly, common exons (c-exons) were built
with common signals as shown in Figure 2A and interrupt exons (i-exons) containing TGA were built by concatenating common signals and TGA as shown in Figure
2B. Thirdly, the gene assembly algorithm SelGenAmic
was used to build the best ORF for each i-exon. Figure 3
shows the process of building a best ORF for an i-exon.
The best ORF which has the maximal coding potential is
composed of this i-exon and other c-exons.
If all i-exons and i-ORFs were enumerated from a
genome to build a set, theoretically it should include all
potential selenoprotein genes with Sec-TGA codons.
However, the vast majority of these i-genes (genes containing Sec-TGA) will be biologically meaningless. To filter out such meaningless i-genes, the conservation of
amino acid sequence in the local regions flanking the Sec
residue (shown in Figure 4) was used to screen out igenes that are more likely to be selenoprotein genes.

genes. A. c-exons in which no in-frame TGA codon is allowed. B. i-exons in which an in-frame TGA codon is present and codes for a Sec residue. The signals such as splice sites AG and GT, start codon and stop
codons are indicated in the figure.

General identification procedure

General procedures of our method are shown in Figure 5
and described as follows.
(1) Obtaining i-exons and c-exons from the genome.
The whole genome sequence of Ciona intestinalis containing 4390 scaffolds was scanned to find all TGA
codons and other signals including ATG, TAA\TAG, and
AG\GT. All i-exons and c-exons were built from these
signals. The coding potential of any exon was calculated
as the sum of the scores of the signals, plus the log-likelihood ratio of a Markov model for coding DNA.
(2) Assembling i-genes from i-exons and c-exons. For
each i-exon, a best ORF which has the maximal coding
potential score was built with our gene assembly algorithm SelGenAmic. 2275466 i-genes were built from
Ciona intestinalis.
(3) Searching for Sec/Cys pairing and the conservation
of its flanking regions. All i-genes were translated into
amino acid sequences. Local sequences flanking the Sec
residue were extracted for detecting similarity in the
NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database by the
BLASTp program in order to obtain multiple sequence
alignments. Those sequences were screened out with
conservation in the local regions flanking the Sec residue,
and alignments containing Sec/Cys pairing (simplified as
U/C pair), i.e., the Sec-containing local sequence must

Figure 4 A predicted protein which has conservative amino acid
sequences flanking the Sec residue is more likely to be a selenoprotein. In its homologs, the Sec (U) residue is expected to be replaced
by Cys (C) residues.

selenoprotein families. The gene structures of selenoproteins in Ciona intestinalis are shown in the Supplemental
Figure S1, S2 in the Additional file 1, along with the posi
tions of exons, introns, UTRs and Sec-TGA codon. The
secondary structures of SECIS elements and multiple
sequence alignments of the conserved amino acid
sequences flanking the Sec residue are shown in Supplemental Figure S3 and S4 in the Additional file 1
Eight selenoproteins were found from the genome
which was misannotated previously in the NCBI database. Brief information about these misannotated proteins is listed in Table 2, and comparisons between the
gene structures of misannotated and newly identified
genes are shown in Supplemental Figure S1 in the Additional file 1. No information was found in the NCBI database for the other newly identified selenoprotein genes in
this article.
It should be mentioned that Ciona intestinalis SelL, a
selenoprotein gene found previously by Gladyshev, was
not identified by our method. SelL gene was constructed
from EST sequences, and proved to be a real selenoprotein of sea squirt before [18]. Comparing the sequences of
SelL with the genome of Ciona intestinalis by Sim4 and

have its homologous sequences contain Cys residues in
the position of Sec in multiple alignments. 40816 i-genes
were screened out by this step.
(4) Searching against EST databases and splicing the
ESTs. Similarity analysis was performed against EST
databases to obtain spliced ESTs for the 40816 i-genes.
The local DNA sequences flanking the TGA of each igene were searched by BLASTn against the EST database
of Ciona intestinalis. 21 i-genes were screened out after
discarding the i-genes in which TGAs were analyzed to
be the products of sequencing errors. Among those 21 igenes, three of them are almost the same as another igene when comparing them with each other. Their corresponding genome segments are also very similar. Therefore, we concluded that the three analogous i-genes were
caused by repeated sequencing and should be discarded.
Finally, 18 i-genes were found to have complete ORFs and
UTRs.
(5) Checking for SECIS elements. All 18 i-genes were
found to have downstream SECIS elements in their
UTRs, which further confirmed them as selenoprotein
genes.

BLASTn, no significantly similar regions of SelL were
found in the genome data. The results implied that
incomplete sequencing of the genome may cause the
omission of genomic regions containing the SelL gene.
The method developed in this paper is used to predict
selenoproteins from genomes, thus it is impossible to find
the Ciona intestinalis SelL gene from the genome data
that do not include this gene.
Unique SelW1 with two SECIS elements

Two SECIS elements were detected by SECISearch 2.19
in the 3'-UTR of the SelW1 gene of Ciona intestinalis.
The gene structure is shown in Figure 6. All gene structures are schematically shown in this article as the 5'-end
on the left. The complete ORF and two SECIS elements
are located in the first exon. Two SECIS elements were
named SECIS 1 and SECIS 2.
The primary sequences and secondary structures of the
two SECIS elements are shown in Figure 7. Both of them
belong to the form II SECIS element, which have an additional minihelix in the apical loop [2]. The two SECIS elements were both detected by SECISearch 2.19 under the
"default" pattern to limit the conservation and energy cutoff. In addition, SECIS 2 could also be detected under the
"strict" pattern. The COVE scores were 24.91 for SECIS 1
and 23.70 for SECIS 2, which are much higher than 15,
the
recommended

SECISearch2.19 [14]. The COVE score was calculated by
matching the query sequence with the known SECIS secondary model. If the score exceeds 15, the query
sequence is considered as a true SECIS according to the
recommendation of SECISearch2.19. Therefore, both
SECIS elements could be functionally active. Up to the
present, two potential SECIS elements have only been
found in SelP and human Sep 15 genes [6,20]. The SelP
gene contains more than one Sec-TGAs, and experimental evidence has shown that its two SECIS elements are
necessary for the efficient incorporation of multiple Sec
residues into SelP. Whereas the Sep 15 gene contains only
one Sec residue, and its upstream SECIS has been proved
nonfunctional [21]. Interestingly, the predicted Ciona
SelW1 gene also contains one Sec residue and two SECIS
elements. Only SECIS 2 can be detected by the "strict"
pattern of SECISearch 2.19. Those suggested that SECIS
2 has a higher possibility of being functional. From the
characteristics of Ciona SelW1 gene structure, it seems
that this gene is more analogous to human Sep15 that its
SECIS 1 may be nonfunctional while SECIS 2 is used for
Sec incorporation. However, conclusion can only be
drawn after experimental results on functional analyses
of these two SECIS elements.
Selenoprotein DsbA found in multicellular organisms

Selenoprotein DsbA has only been found in multiple
prokaryote species, microbial marine communities, symbiotic bacterium of a gutless worm, and picoeukaryote
Micromonas [11,12,19,22-24]. In this paper, DsbA was
firstly reported as selenoprotein in a multicellular organism, Ciona intestinalis. The structural information for
selenoprotein DsbA gene of Ciona intestinalis is shown in
Figure 8A indicated as newly annotated, while the originally released gene is indicated as misannotated, where
the upstream part of the first exon, including the SecTGA, was misannotated as the UTR of the gene.
Interestingly, a selenoprotein DsbA gene was also identified in Branchiostoma floridae which was misannotated
as

(gi|219424997|ref|XP_002210295.1|) in the present database [25]. The upstream sequence of the coding region in
this amphioxus gene was extracted from its mRNA, and
translated into an amino acid sequence where the original
start codon, ATG, was decoded as a methionine (Met, or
M) and a TGA decoded as a Sec. The translated sequence
was analysed by BLASTp against the NCBI nr database.
The complete ORF of the selenoprotein DsbA gene was
constructed by extending its aligned ESTs of Branchiostoma floridae. However, not enough ESTs were found to
be extended to the UTR for SECIS search. Thus, the ORF
downstream sequence was extracted from the genome to
search for SECIS element. A positive hit was found by
SECISearch 2.19. The gene structure of this newly identi-

fied selenoprotein DsbA is shown in Figure 8B indicated
as newly annotated, while the originally annotated coding
region in the NCBI database is indicated as misannotated. The first exon of the new gene containing the SecTGA codon was misannotated as the 5'-UTR in the original version, and the last exon of the new gene including
the stop codon and 3'-UTR was missing originally. Two
long exons and a long intron were found at the end of the
original gene. No similar EST sequence or amino acid
sequence has been released for these two exons.
The primary sequences and secondary structures of the
SECIS elements in the newly identified DsbA selenoprotein genes from three species are shown in Figure 9.
Homologous analysis by multiple alignments of SECIS
sequences in Figure 9 shows that the two SECIS elements
from the Ciona DsbA selenoprotein genes are more similar than the one from Branchiostoma floridae. In addition, both Ciona SECIS elements belong to the form II

SECIS that has an additional minihelix in the apical loop.
The COVE scores of the SECIS elements of Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savigyni and Branchiostoma floridae were
22.40, 17.89 and 18.83, respectively. An unpaired CC
motif is found in the apical loop of Ciona savigyni SECIS
element as a conserved site, while the AA motif was
found in Ciona intestinalis and Branchiostoma floridae
SECIS elements. The AA motif of a SECIS element has
been reported in most selenoprotein genes of different
organisms, while the rare CC motif has only been
reported in human, rat and mouse selenoprotein M [26].
The thiol/disulfide interchange protein DsbA, a member of the thioredoxin family of disulfide oxidoreductases, catalyzes disulfide bond formation by
donating its disulfide to newly translocated proteins in
many prokaryotes [27]. Eukaryotic protein disulfide
isomerase (PDI) has a similar function, and both proteins
have similar redox active levels [28]. DsbA contains a

redox-active CXXC motif imbedded in a TRX fold. The
active CXXC motifs can be found in many other selenoproteins. Research on the structure and function of the
CXXC motif in Escherichia coli DsbA has shown that the
upstream Cys is exposed on the surface of protein, and
the downstream Cys is embedded in the 3-D structure
[29]. The upstream Cys has a very low pKa value (â3.5),
and is completely ionized under physiological pH conditions [30]. Mutational analyses have revealed that the

upstream Cys residue can catalyze thiol/disulfide interchange reaction without the presence of the downstream
Cys [31]. These studies suggest that the upstream Cys is
more important than the downstream Cys of DsbA.
Interestingly, the upstream Cys is replaced with Sec in
our newly identified three DsbA selenoproteins. Due to
the higher redox activity of Sec compared with that of
Cys, it is reasonable for us to deduce that selenoprotein

DsbAs with Sec in place of Cys in the reactive centres are
more functionally active than non-selenoprotein DsbAs.
Evolutionary analyses of DsbA

The 100 most similar protein sequences to DsbA were
obtained from the NCBI nr database by BLASTp program. Sequences from the same species were deleted,
leaving 67 homologs of DsbA, including the newly identified DsbA selenoproteins. Those DsbA homologs were
aligned and phylogenetically analysed. Most of the DsbAs
(47 of 67) are bacterial proteins, and the remaining 20 are
eukaryotic. A phylogenetic tree of these 20 eukaryotic
DsbA proteins is shown in Figure 10. The multiple
sequence alignments of these 20 proteins, along with 8
prokaryotic DsbA selenoproteins found previously in the
Sargasso Sea microbial selenoproteome, are shown in
Figure 11. The putative CXXC active sites and Sec residues are highlighted.
Phylogenetic analysis shows that eukaryotic DsbA proteins can be clearly classified into three groups: the fungi,
viridiplantae and metazoa. No selenoprotein DsbA was
found in the fungi group. Only one selenoprotein DsbA
was found in the viridiplantae group, which belongs to
Micromonas pusilla, a unicellular plant. The three newly
predicted DsbA selenoproteins belong to the metazoa
group, cionidae subgroup. They are most closely related
to each other. According to the phylogenetic analysis,
DsbA is widely distributed in prokaryotes. The utilization
of selenium to form Sec in DsbA diverged during the evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Since both selenoprotein DsbA and non-selenoprotein DsbA (the Cyscontaining form) could be found in prokaryotes, metazoa, and viridiplantae (see Figure 10), a hypothesis was
deduced that the evolution of selenoprotein DsbA
occurred prior to the separation of animal and plant kingdoms. Additionally, the Sec residue was lost or replaced
by Cys in land plants [8]. The hypothesis is supported by
the evidence that only an early-diverging unicellular plant
in the viridiplantae has a selenoprotein DsbA, while other
land plants have the Cys-containing proteins.
Sea squirts and amphioxus are important transitional
species, bridging the gap between vertebrates and invertebrates. Amphioxus is even considered as the invertebrate that is most evolutionarily close to vertebrates. The
placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens, a close relative to the
three cionidae DsbA selenoproteins in the phylogenetic
tree, is arguably the simplest free-living animal, and
therefore may represent a primitive metazoan form [32].
Genome project research on these ancient species has
provided important information for studying the evolution of vertebrates, and even metazoans. Interestingly,
selenoprotein DsbAs were found in these primitive chordates, while only Cys-containing form DsbAs were found
in the primitive metazoan. No DsbAs were found in ver-

tebrates through homologous analysis. The reason could
be that DsbA is possibly replaced during evolution by
another enzyme with similar function, such as DPI or
other proteins in the thioredoxin family. In higher vertebrates, the DsbA family was completely replaced by other
proteins with similar function, leading to the disappearance of DsbA selenoproteins.
Relative merit of the SelGenAmic-based method

The selenoprotein identification scheme presented
herein (an 'i-ORF-assembly-first, Sec-homology-second,
SECIS-search-third' approach) differs from the reported
methods in some ways. The methods based on SECIS
search required the finding of SECIS elements to inform
their gene-prediction-algorithms the proper sequences
for predicting i-genes [7]. However, it is possible for some
new selenoprotein genes to have certain special SECIS
structures that have not been discovered up to the present, thus can't be detected by available known programs.
In this case, the SECIS-search based approach is impossible to find those special selenoprotein genes. Although
the method based on read-through similarity analysis
(RSA) had made up this shortage [33], it could only be
applied to identify prokaryotic selenoprotein genes but
not the eukaryotic due to their complicated intro-exon
structures. In this sense, our method has the merit of
independently finding possible i-ORFs for all TGA
codons in eukaryotic genomes without the help of SECIS
information. This is because the SelGenAmic algorithm
could enumerate all i-ORFs for all TGA codons in a
eukaryotic genome. Therefore, even with special SECIS
structures, those selenoproteins will not be lost in the
analysis using the SelGenAmic-based method. They can
be found during protein sequence conservation analysis.
In fact, the SECIS-independent-prediction method was
firstly introduced to find human and fugu selenoproteins
in 2003 [11,14]. However, its ORF prediction step is different from ours. The SelGenAmic algorithm we developed in this paper is to assemble i-ORF for each TGA in
genomic sequences, while the GenAmic algorithm
reported previously is to assemble selenoprotein genes
and standard genes at the same time, using stronger coding bias for the sequence downstream Sec-TGA codon to
discriminate real Sec-TGA codons and others. Although
it was performed with rather high sensitivity (80%), some
selenoproteins, such as SelK, SelT and SelS, were still
missing during human genome analysis. To overcome
this shortage, the SelGenAmic algorithm was developed
to maximize the sensitivity in such way that an optimal iORF was built for each TGA codon, without skipping any
TGA codon even with low coding bias for the downstream sequence. The SelGenAmic-based method was
also applied to human genome to detect its sensitivity,
and it successfully identified the whole 25 human seleno-

proteins as shown as Supplemental Figure S5 in the Additional file 1. However, the improvement was achieved at
the expense of dealing with a huge amount of data (more
than 2 million biological meaningless i-genes in Ciona).
These false positive predictions could be removed
through protein conservation alignments.
Another merit of the SelGenAmic-based method is that
it can find the alternative splicing genes of selenoproteins. Some selenoprotein genes, such as human DI2,
have more than one alternative splicing forms. The Sec
residues of two human DI2 forms were coded by different
TGA codons in the gene. Because earlier methods, like
Geneid_SP, only considered one of these two TGAs as the
best Sec codon, they could not detect the alternative
splicing form of DI2 containing another Sec-TGA codon.
Using our method, both forms of human DI2 were identified (data not shown), so were the two forms of DI2 in the

armadillo genome (shown as Supplemental Figures S6, S7
and S8 in Additional file 1).

Conclusion
A eukaryotic selenoprotein identification method based
on a gene assembly algorithm SelGenAmic was presented
in this paper. It focuses on the prediction of ORF containing a Sec-TGA codon in the eukaryotic genomes. With
the aid of this method, 18 selenoprotein genes were identified from the genome of Ciona intestinalis, leading to
the member of its selenoproteome up to 19. Among
them, a unique selenoprotein gene of Ciona intestinalis
SelW1 contained two SECIS elements while others had
only one SECIS element in their 3'-UTRs. In addition,
DsbA was firstly found to be a selenoprotein in multicellular organisms, like Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi,
and Branchiostoma floridae. The existence of DsbA selenoproteins in multicelluar organisms provides important

Methods
Data resources

The genome sequences were downloaded from the
Ensembl
Project
Genome
Databases
http://
www.ensembl.org. The release number of the genome
data is JGI2.48 for Ciona intestinalis. The text file size of
the genome data of Ciona intestinalis is about 172 Mb,
containing approximately 176,000,000 bp, 4,390 scaffolds.
All available Ciona intestinalis EST sequences (1,205,981
at the time of our analyses) were extracted from the NCBI
database.
Construction of ORFs containing Sec-TGAs

The program Geneid (version 1.2a) [34] was used to
obtain all common gene signals, such as start codon,
splice sites, stop codons, and common potential exons,
from genomic sequences. A series of PERL programs
were edited to obtain all TGA codons from a genome,
and build i-exons from common signals and TGA
codons. The coding potential was obtained by Geneid
with specific parameter file of ...Ciona intestinalis (downloaded from http://genome.crg.es/software/geneid/
index.html). A PERL program was edited based on the igene assembly algorithm, SelGenAmic, to construct all igenes from common exons and i-exons.
Assembly algorithm SelGenAmic

The algorithm SelGenAmic is developed from GenAmic
to solve the problem of finding an optimal ORF for each iexon. The word optimal here means that the coding
potential score of such ORF is bigger than any other
ORFs composed of this i-exon and other suitable c-exons.
The input data of SelGenAmic are all i-exons and cexons along with their information such as coding potential, position and coding frame. Let E = {e1, e2, ..., ek, (k â¥ 0,
k is an integer) be the set of exons. The coding potential
of these exons are shown as P(e) for each e E in this
paper.
Let C = {c1, ..., cm, (m â¥ 0, m is an integer) and T = {t1, ...,
tn, (n â¥ 0, n is an integer) be the sets of c-exons and iexons. Obviously, E = C T.
The principle to constrain the algorithm to choose suitable exons for concatenation is described as a function M.
â§ 1,(a < b, ea and eb can be concatenated legally )
M(ea, eb) = â¨
â© 0,(ea and eb cannot be concatenated legally)

The function M describes the relation of two exons ea
and eb(ea E, eb E), which can be concatenated legally in

Page 11 of 14

numerical order. The word legal here means ea and eb are
frames compatible, non-overlapping, and adjoining splice
sites matched.
Firstly we recall the concepts of gene assembly. A gene
assembly g is a sequence consisting of exons e1', ... eq' from
E (ei' E). Thus a legal gene assembly can be described as
g = <e1', ... eq' >, where for all ei' in g, M(ei', e(i+1)') = 1.
The coding potential of a gene assembly is the sum of
scores of assembled exons: P(g) = P(e1')+...+P(eq'). The
problem to find an optimal g could thus be interpreted as
to search for the gene assembly g with maximum P(g), i.e.,
for all other genes g' constructed from E, P(g)> = P(g')
Thus the target of SelGenAmic is that, for each ti T,
finding an optimal gene assembly g(ti) = <c1', ..., ck', ti, c1",
..., ck">, where ci' C, ci" C, M(ck', ti) = 1, M(ti, c1") = 1,
M(ci', c(i+1)') = 1, M(ci", c(i+1)") = 1, i.e., for the set T = {t1, ...,
tn, build a set of optimal gene assemblies {g(t1), ..., g(tn).
This problem is equivalent to find the best upstream
assembly gu = <c1', ... ck', ti,> and the best downstream
assembly gd = <ti, c1", ... ck"> for each ti.
To solve such problem, we introduced six concepts. (1)
the best upstream assembly(BUA); (2) the coding potential of BUA (CpBUA); (3) the best upstream adjoining
exon (BUE); (4) the best downstream assembly (BDA); (5)
the coding potential of BDA (CpBDA) and (6) the best
downstream adjoining exon (BDE).
The concepts (1), (2) and (3), were used in the
GenAmic algorithm of Geneid program to calculate the
optimal assembly from common exons [35]. The concept
(1) BUA was described as that for each exon ci from C it is
possible to find a best assembly ended with ci, i.e., gu(ci) =
<c1', ... ci>, where for all other assembly g' ended with ci,
P(gu(ci))> = P(g'). The coding potential P(gu(ci)) is the
CpBUA (concept (3)) of ci.
The concept (2) BUE was described as that for each ci
from C, it is possible to find a best upstream adjoining
exon cj, if and only if
1. M(cj, ci) = 1, and
2. for all other c' C, if M(c', ci) = 1, P(gu(cj)) > = P(gu(c')).
Here we use function G to describe the relationship
between a c-exon ci and its BUE cj: G(ci) = cj.
Obviously, the BUA gu(ci) of ci, can be obtained by concatenating its BUE ci and the BUA g(cj) of ci:
g u (c i ) =< c1 , â¦ .c j , c i >=< g u (c j ), c i >=< g u (G(c i )), c i > .

So that, it can be easily concluded that if all the BUE for
each c C were known, the BUA can be easily calculated
as follow:

Jiang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:289
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/289

gu(ci) = <c0, ..., G (G(ci)), G(ci), ci >, (c0 is used to describe
the first exon of this assembly).
In Geneid, the author of GenAmic algorithm used
dynamic programming to obtain all the BUE G(c) for
every c C [36]. Using the GenAmic, we can easily build
3 sets for C = {c1, c2, ..., ck:
the set of BUE G(c1), G(c2), ..., G(ck)},
the set of BUA { gu(c1), gu(c2), ..., gu(ck)}, and
the set of CpBUA P(gu(c1)), P(gu(c2)), ..., P(gu(ck)).
Knowing how to calculate the BUA gu(ci) for each cexon ci C, we can use the same method to build the BUA
gu(ti) for each i-exon ti T:
gu(ti) = <c1', ... ck', ti > = <gu (G(ti)), ti > = <gu (cu), ti >,
where cu is the BUE of ti.
The BUE cu C is a c-exon, and the set of BUA { gu(c1),
gu(c2), ..., gu(ck)} for each c C can be obtained with
GenAmic algorithm in linear time. Thus, if all the BUE cu
for each i-exon ti T can be obtained, its BUA can also be
produced.
The BUE G(ti) = cu can be found in the following way.
We find all exons c' satisfying M(c', ti) = 1, and their
CpBUA from {P(gu(c1)), P(gu(c2)), ..., P(gu(ck)). By comparing their coding potentials, the cu with maximal P(gu(c))
can be found.
As shown in Figure 12, all c-exons c"
C located
upstream of ti and satisfying M(c", ti) will be searched for
the cu of ti. An i-exon ti-k can be found to divide the
genome into 2 regions. The ti-k is a exon for which all cexons c" satisfying M(c", ti-k) = 1 are also satisfying M(c", ti)
= 1. Obviously, the c-exon with maximal CpBUA in
region Î± is the BUE of ti-k. Then only c' in region Î² satisfying M(c', ti) = 1 will be searched for the c-exon with maximal CpBUA. Let A and B be the sets of c-exons in the
region Î± and Î², respectively, then to find the cu for ti, can
be described as follow:
â§ P( gu(G(ti â k)))
â«
âª
âª
P( gu(G(ti))) = max â¨
â¬
max { P( gu(c)) : c ââ } â­
âª
âª
â©

With this equation, all BUE(s) of ti T can be calculated
recursively with one scan of the genome in linear time,

Figure 12 The regions in which c-exons are used to search for the
best upstream adjoining exon of ti.

Page 12 of 14

due to the reason that only the region Î² for each ti is
needed to be searched.
Then the set of BUE for T is obtained as G(t1), G(t2), ...,
G(tk)} and
the set of BUA for T is obtained as gu(G(t1)), gu(G(t2)),
..., gu(G(tk)).
The BDA, BDE and CpBDA for all c
C can be
obtained in similar way. Let gd(ci) be the BDA of ci, and let
function Gr describe the relation of ci and its BDE cj:
Gr(ci) = cj, if and only if
1. M(ci, cj) = 1 and
2. for all other c' C, if M(ci, c') = 1, then P(gd(cj))> =
P(gd(c')).
Thus the set of BDA, BDE and CpBDA for all c C can
be produced similarly as follows:
Gr(c1), Gr(c2), ..., Gr(ck)},
{ gd(c1), gd(c2), ..., gd(ck)}, and
P(gd(c1)), P(gd(c2)), ..., P(gd(ck))}.
Then the set of BDA for T is obtained as gd(Gr(t1)),
gd(Gr(t2)), ..., gd(Gr(tk)).
By concatenating BUA and BDA, the best assembly for
ti is constructed as g = <gu(G(ti)), ti, gd(Gr(ti)) >.
Thus, for each i-exon an optimal assembly can be constructed in linear time.
Homology analysis

The NCBI nr protein database was downloaded from the
NCBI ftp server in June of 2008, containing 6,598,440
protein sequences, 2,257,741,895 total letters. BLAST
programs (version 2.2.18) [36] were also obtained from
the NCBI ftp server at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/. All
i-genes were searched by the program BLASTp with an Evalue cutoff at 1. All similar sequences detected were
used to create multiple sequence alignments with ClustalW (version 1.83) [37]. The conservative motif containing the Sec residue of an i-gene was analysed by the
program using a motif search algorithm like MAME.
Gene structure analysis

EST sequences were downloaded and compared with all
predicted selenoprotein genes using the program
BLASTn. Highly similar EST sequences were spliced by
SeqMan program from the DNASTAR package http://
www.dnastar.com/ and analysed for the selenoprotein
gene structure. The constructed genes were homologously compared to genomic sequences with the program
Sim4 [38] to find the locations of exons and introns in the
genome, shown as position numbers in Figure 3, Figure 5
and Supplemental Figure S1, Figure S2 in the Additional
file 1.

Search for SECIS elements

RNAfold (version 1.7.2) [39] and PatScan [40] were automatically used by a PERL program to detect SECIS-like
structures from genome sequences. The SECIS patterns
used in the present paper are the same as that in the
search of human SECIS [14]. These patterns together
with the SECISearch program in PERL language were
kindly provided online by Doctor Charles (Karolos)
Chapple http://genome.imim.es/~cchapple/. The COVE
score of SECIS-like structures were evaluated by the
online program SECISearch (version 2.19) [14].
Phylogenetic analysis

Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were generated using the ClustalX program (version 1.83) [41]. The
unrooted phylogenetic tree with unscaled distance
branches were generated using the program MEGA3.1
http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_1/intro.html with the
Neighbor-Joining method. Tests of the phylogenic analyses were done by 1000 replications of the Bootstrap algorithm.
