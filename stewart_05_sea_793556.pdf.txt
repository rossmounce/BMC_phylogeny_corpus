Abstract
Background: Vaults are intriguing ribonucleoprotein assemblies with an unknown function that
are conserved among higher eukaryotes. The Pacific coast sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus,
is an invertebrate model organism that is evolutionarily closer to humans than Drosophila and C.
elegans, neither of which possesses vaults. Here we compare the structures of sea urchin and
mammalian vaults and analyze the subcellular distribution of vaults during sea urchin
embryogenesis.
Results: The sequence of the sea urchin major vault protein (MVP) was assembled from expressed
sequence tags and genome traces, and the predicted protein was found to have 64% identity and
81% similarity to rat MVP. Sea urchin MVP includes seven ~50 residue repeats in the N-terminal
half of the protein and a predicted coiled coil domain in the C-terminus, as does rat MVP. A
cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) reconstruction of isolated sea urchin vaults reveals the
assembly to have a barrel-shaped external structure that is nearly identical to the rat vault
structure. Analysis of the molecular composition of the sea urchin vault indicates that it contains
components that may be homologs of the mammalian vault RNA component (vRNA) and protein
components (VPARP and TEP1). The sea urchin vault appears to have additional protein
components in the molecular weight range of 14–55 kDa that might correspond to molecular
contents. Confocal experiments indicate a dramatic relocalization of MVP from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus during sea urchin embryogenesis.
Conclusions: These results are suggestive of a role for the vault in delivering macromolecules to
the nucleus during development.

Background
The sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is an important model system in developmental biology and its

genome is currently being sequenced by the Human
Genome Sequencing Center at the Baylor College of Medicine under the auspices of the National Human Genome

Research Institute (NHGRI). Sea urchin embryos are well
suited for biochemical approaches to studying the cell
biology of development, as large quantities of eggs can
easily be obtained, and their fertilization initiates the synchronous development of optically transparent embryos
[1]. Sea urchins occupy an important phylogenetic position as basal deuterostomes, and are thus more closely
related to humans than are other invertebrate model
organisms such as Drosophila and C. elegans. In addition,
the echinoderm lineage leading to sea urchins diverged
from chordates prior to the large scale gene duplication
events that occurred early in the evolution of the vertebrates, and because of this many of the genes that are
found as multiple paralogues in vertebrates have only a
single homolog in sea urchins. Therefore sea urchins provide a system that avoids the problem of functional
redundancies between multiple paralogues that often
occurs in vertebrates, and serves as a useful comparison
for assessing the significance of conserved genes and regulatory linkages within the genome.
Sea urchins cells, like mammalian cells, contain abundant
quantities of vaults, which are ~13MDa ribonucleoprotein particles of as yet unknown function [2]. Vaults are
barrel-shaped assemblies composed of multiple copies of
three proteins and small untranslated RNA molecules,
called vRNA. Intriguingly vaults are up-regulated in certain human multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines, although
their role in multidrug resistance remains unclear [3-6].
The high level of conservation among higher eukaryotes
of both the major vault protein (MVP) sequence and the
barrel-shaped vault structure suggests an important cellular role for the vault. Nucleocytoplasmic transport,
sequestration of macromolecules, and protection from
xenobiotics have all been proposed as possible functions
for the vault [4,7-9]. Several recent publications have supported a role for vaults as either a transporter [10,11] or a
scaffold protein [12]. Knock-out mice have been produced lacking one each of the three mammalian vault proteins: MVP; the vault poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(VPARP); and the telomerase associated protein one
(TEP1) [13-15]. These knock-out mice appear to be
healthy, indicating that if the vault does perform a critical
cellular function there must be a redundant or compensatory pathway in the mouse.
Immunofluorescence studies in sea urchins indicate that
MVP is present throughout the cytoplasm in cleavagestage zygotes and in the nucleus in adult somatic cells
[16]. Within the nucleus of coelomocytes, the MVP is
present in particularly high concentrations in the nucleolus. This is in contrast to localization studies in most other
eukaryotic cells, which show MVP as primarily cytoplasmic [17-21]. During isolation from sea urchins, vaults are
found to co-purify with both microtubules and ribosomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/5/3

[22-24]. The sea urchin MVP cell localization and co-purification results led to a hypothesis that vaults may play a
role in nucleocytoplasmic transport of ribosomes and/or
mRNA [16].
The present study provides a comparison of vaults from
sea urchins and rats in terms of their molecular composition and MVP protein sequence, as well as by cryoEM
imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction. In addition, images obtained by confocal microscopy are presented that indicate differential localization of MVP
during sea urchin embryogenesis, suggesting that the
highly conserved ribonucleoprotein vault might play a
role during development.

Results
Molecular composition of sea urchin vaults and
comparison with mammalian vaults
Vaults isolated from mammals, including rats, mice, and
humans, are composed of three proteins (MVP, VPARP,
and TEP1) and one or more small untranslated RNA molecules, called vRNA. The protein stoichiometry is thought
to be 96 copies of MVP with 2–16 copies of VPARP and
TEP1 per particle [25]. The human (99 kDa) and rat (96
kDa) homologs of MVP display 91% similarity. In
humans the two high molecular weight vault proteins,
VPARP and TEP1, have been sequenced and have masses
of 193 and 290 kDa, respectively [18,26-28]. vRNA
accounts for ~5% of the total mass of the mammalian
vault particle. Four human vRNA genes have been identified, encoding vRNAs that range from 86 to 99 bases in
length [8,28]. Rat vaults in contrast have only one species
of vRNA, 141 bases in length [29], which appears as a ~37
kDa band by SDS-PAGE [25]. All of the mammalian vRNA
sequences that have been sequenced thus far show ~80%
sequence identity and have similar predicted secondary
structures [18]. In rat vaults vRNA can be degraded by a
harsh treatment with two RNases leaving the rest of the
vault particle structurally intact [25].

When purified under identical conditions, the molecular
composition of the sea urchin vault is more complex than
that of the rat vault (Fig. 1A). For both rat and sea urchin
vaults, the strongest protein band is that of MVP at ~100
kDa. We have previously demonstrated that polyclonal
antiserum generated against the sea urchin ~100 kDa protein has cross-reactivity with the rat vault MVP, as well as
with the Dictyostelium MVPα and MVPβ vault proteins
[16]. SDS-PAGE indicates that the sea urchin vault has two
or more high molecular weight components at ~200 kDa,
similar to the VPARP and TEP1 bands for rat and mouse
vaults [9,30,31]. Searches of the S. purpuratus genome
identified clear sequence homologs of both VPARP and
TEP1 (data not shown). Purified sea urchin vaults also
appear to contain vRNA, as demonstrated by the loss of a

the 96 kDa rat MVP, with 847 vs. 861 aa. These two MVP
homologs exhibit 64% identity and 81% strong similarity
(Fig. 2A). The sea urchin MVP sequence is composed of
seven repeats (each 41 to 62 residues) in the N-terminal
half of the protein, and a predicted coiled coil region (aa
663–762) in the C-terminal half of the protein (Fig. 2B).
The rat MVP sequence has seven similar repeats of
unknown function in the N-terminal half and also has a
predicted coiled coil region in the C-terminal half [32,33].

26.5 kDa band after RNase treatment (Fig. 1B). We note
that the apparent molecular weight of the sea urchin RNA
molecule is smaller than that of the rat vault vRNA, 26.5
vs. 37 kDa.
What is noticeably different between the sea urchin and
rat vaults is the number of protein bands within the
molecular weight range of 14 to 55 kDa in the sea urchin
vault that are not observed in the rat vault. Since sea
urchin vaults were purified in the same manner as rat
vaults, we conclude that either the molecular composition
of the sea urchin vault is more complex than that of the
mammalian vaults, or that the sea urchin vaults have a
more varied composition of molecular cargo.
Amino acid sequence of the sea urchin major vault protein
To more fully characterize and identify the sea urchin
MVP, we used expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and trace
sequences from the S. purpuratus genome to assemble the
coding sequence of the SpMVP gene (see Methods), which
is apparently present as a single homolog per haploid
genome. The fact that this sequence was found in several
blastula-stage ESTs shows that it is expressed in the
embryo. The deduced sequence of sea urchin MVP
encodes a 95 kDa protein which is slightly smaller than

In addition to comparing rat and sea urchin MVP
sequences, we used pair-wise alignments to compare the
amino acid sequences of several other known MVPs,
including the two from Dictyostelium (Table 1). These
comparisons indicate that the MVP sequence is highly
conserved between phylogenetically distant species, and
that the similarity between sea urchin and rat MVP
sequences is comparable to that among distantly related
vertebrates, and also to the intraspecific similarity of Dictyostelium MVPs.
The sea urchin MVP sequence was analyzed for potential
nuclear localization signals (NLS's) and nuclear export
signals (NES's), as well as possible sumoylation sites.
Although the PredictNLS server [34] did not find any
putative NLS's, visual examination of the sequence
resulted identification of two basic regions with three
lysine (K) or arginine (R) residues within a four amino
acid stretch that are similar to the smallest consensus
sequence of the monopartite type NLS [35]. Comparison
of the sea urchin MVP sequence with the NES logo defined
by la Cour et al. [36], indicates that a region of 25 residues
near the C-terminus of protein (aa 792 – 816) has a close
resemblance to the NES logo. Within this window we find
the three most highly conserved leucine (L) residues
(L804, L807 and L809); 3 additional residues matching
the most favored residue type in the logo; 6 additional residues matching the second or third most favored residue
type; and 3 additional residues matching the fourth, fifth
of sixth most favored residue type. The Abgents Sumoylation Calculator predicts five highly probable sumoylation
sites in order of probability: K308 (VKGE), K731 (LKAE),
K707 (AKAE), K736 (AKIE), and K427 (AKDP) within the
sea urchin MVP. With the exception of K427, the amino
acid sequence surrounding the lysine acceptor residue follow the consensus sequence, ΨKXE, where Ψ represents a
hydrophobic residue, K represents the target lysine, X
represents any amino acid and E represents glutamic acid
[37]. Sequence alignment of MVP homologs from six species showed that two of these five motifs (K308 and K707)
are conserved.
Epitopes are also conserved between the rat MVP and the
sea urchin MVP. Previously, we generated and purified a
rabbit polyclonal antibody against the MVP that

sequence (NES, 792–816), and two probable sumoylation sites that are conserved across six species (S1 K308-VKGE, and S2
K707-AKAE) are indicated.

MVP [16]. In this report, we show that these affinity-purified antibodies also recognize the MVP in purified sea
urchin vault preparations (Fig. 3). Two minor bands of
~80 kDa and 50 kDa cross-react with the anti-MVP antibodies indicating that these may be breakdown products
of the 100 kDa MVP. In addition to the antibodies generated against the sea urchin MVP, anti-peptide antibodies
were generated against a peptide located at the amino terminus of the rat MVP sequence [38]. This sequence is
approximately 70% identical in the sea urchin and rat
MVP sequence and the affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies bind to purified sea urchin MVP (Fig. 3). This

observation provides experimental support to relate the
assembled coding sequence of the SpMVP gene to the
major protein component of the purified sea urchin vault.
Electron microscopy and reconstruction of the sea urchin
vault
Negative-stain EM and cryoEM images of isolated sea
urchin vaults reveal that they have the same overall morphology as mammalian vaults (Fig. 4). As was noted in
cryomicrographs of the rat vault [9], sea urchin vaults are
occasionally observed to be 'open' at the midsection. One
advantage of cryoEM over negative-stain TEM is that a cryomicrograph is essentially a projection image of all of the
density, external and internal, within a macromolecular
assembly. In cryomicrographs, both sea urchin and rat
vaults appear to have molecular contents of varying mass
per particle (Fig. 4B, white arrow and [9]).

In order to characterize the three dimensional structure of
the sea urchin vault, a three-dimensional structure was
calculated using cryoEM images and single particle reconstruction methods. Only particle images of well-formed,
fully closed sea urchin vaults were selected for image
processing. Refinement of the cryoEM data set produced a
three-dimensional reconstruction at 33 Å resolution (Fig.
5). The exterior shape of the sea urchin vault reconstruction is nearly identical to the shape of the rat vault reconstruction with a central barrel section and two protruding
caps [9]. When the sea urchin vault reconstruction is
cropped in half the large internal cavity is revealed (Fig. 5B
and 5C). As has been noted for the rat vault, the volume
of the internal cavity is large enough to enclose an intact
ribosome [9].
CryoEM reconstructions of recombinant and tissue
derived vaults often show small holes at the cap/barrel
junction [9,39]. The sea urchin vault reconstruction does
not show these holes, but they are probably obscured by
the low resolution of the sea urchin vault structure.
Another subtle difference between the sea urchin and rat
vault reconstructions is that less density is observed in the
flat portion of the sea urchin vault cap (Fig. 5B, arrow).
This is the same region of the vault that was identified as
the vRNA binding site within the rat vault [25]. It is also a
region that tends to be variable between vault reconstructions [39].
Cellular localization of MVP during sea urchin embryonic
development
Earlier immunofluorescence studies indicated that maternal and zygotic MVP is located in the cytoplasm, whereas
adult MVP is predominantly nuclear [16]. The subcellular
location of MVP during embryogenesis was not determined by immunofluorescence. However, cell fractionation and immunoblot analyses of embryos showed that

interior. The crop planes are displayed with the strongest

the strongest density is in the "shoulder" region at the top
and bottom of the central barrel section. The flat portion of

while total amount of MVP remained constant during
embryogenesis, MVP became progressively concentrated
in the nuclear fractions as development proceeded from
the mesenchyme blastula stage to the larval stage [16].
Here we confirm and extend this result using antibody
staining and confocal microscopy to localize MVP subcellularly during embryonic development. The confocal
images in Figure 6 demonstrate that sea urchin MVP
moves from a largely cytoplasmic distribution in the
cleavage stage embryo, to a predominantly nuclear and/or
perinuclear location at blastula and gastrula stages.

Discussion
In this study we used the sea urchin genome to deduce the
amino acid sequence of the sea urchin MVP and characterized the structure of the sea urchin vault particle using cryoEM single particle reconstruction methods. It is known
that multiple copies of MVP form the recognizable vault
structure, as expression of rat MVP in insect cells leads to
the assembly of vaults [40]. Given the relatively high
(81%) sequence similarity observed between sea urchin
and rat MVP, it is not surprising that the exterior sea
urchin vault structure is quite similar to that of rat vaults
[9,39]. In addition to MVP, the rat vault is composed of
the high molecular weight proteins VPARP and TEP1, as
well as the small vRNA. The electrophoretic analysis of
purified sea urchin vault presented here shows protein
bands and one RNA band that might correspond to

merging the MVP and DNA images coincident staining is observed as cyan (C, F, I, L; right column). Note that as development
proceeds the cellular localization of MVP progressively shifts from cytoplasmic to nuclear.

homologs of the mammalian vault components VPARP,
TEP1, and vRNA. Moreover, sequence homologs of
VPARP and TEP1 are found in the sea urchin genome.
SDS-PAGE analysis has indicated that the molecular composition of sea urchin vaults is more complex than that of
rat vaults. Protein bands in the range of 14 to 55 kDa are
observed that might either be additional vault components or macromolecular contents that are present in high
copy numbers within the sea urchin vault. One protein in
this mass range (~50 kDa) cross-reacts with MVP antisera
and is likely to be a breakdown product of MVP. The identities of the additional proteins will be the subject of
future investigations. It is tempting to speculate that the
difference in protein composition between sea urchin and
rat vaults might indicate that sea urchin vaults are transporting or sequestering a larger assortment of
macromolecules.
Vaults were originally named because of their similarity to
arched cathedral ceilings [41]. This name may be apt in
another sense in that the vault might serve to provide a
safe enclosure for its molecular contents [2]. It has been
postulated that mammalian vaults might open under certain physiological conditions to allow encapsulation or
release of their molecular cargo. Sea urchin vaults are
occasionally observed to be partially open at the midsection in cryomicrographs. Thus sea urchin vaults, as well as
mammalian vaults, might be able to regulate what is contained within the large internal cavity. Both sea urchin
and rat vaults [9] appear to have molecular contents in
cryomicrographs. However as the features of the contents
vary from vault to vault they are inappropriately averaged
or "smeared" during the image reconstruction process.
A difference map analysis between cryoEM reconstructions of intact and RNase-treated rat vaults led to the
localization of the vRNA to the flat portions of the rat
vault caps [25]. The reconstruction of the sea urchin vault
reveals a difference in this region of the vault and appears
more similar to the RNase-treated rat vault [25]. Although
RNase-treatment does not harm the structure of the rat
vault, it does appear to affect the sea urchin vault. Several
attempts were made to collect negative-stain and cryoEM
images of the RNase-treated sea urchin vaults, but no
intact vault particles were observed. The difference
observed in the cap density and the differing response to
RNase-treatment could imply that the vRNA has a
different location or a more important structural role in
the sea urchin vault than in the rat vault.
The confocal images reveal a progressive enrichment of
MVP in the nucleus and perinuclear cytoplasm during sea
urchin embryogenesis. Our previous biochemical fractionation studies confirm that the MVP accumulates in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/5/3

the nucleus beginning at the mesenchyme blastula stage
[16]. This important stage of development marks the transition between proliferation and differentiation. As a consequence of differentiation the cells are preparing to exit
from the rapid cell cycles that followed fertilization. For
example, mRNAs which were abundant in the early
cleavage stages, such as cyclin mRNA, decrease dramatically at the blastula stage [42]. New post-cleavage stage
mRNAs begin to accumulate at blastula stage. We suggest
that vaults participate in nucleocytoplasmic transport that
accompanies remodeling of nuclear architecture in preparation for terminal cell differentiation [43].
While MVP localization studies in mammalian cells reveal
a largely cytoplasmic location, the published staining pattern is consistent with there also being a small amount of
nuclear MVP [17,18]. While no classical NLS sequence is
found in either the sea urchin or rat MVP, there are basic
sequences that might potentially fulfill the requirements
of an NLS. The C-terminal region of sea urchin MVP has a
region that strongly resembles the NES logo assembled
from known NES's [36] and this region is fairly well conserved in MVP from six species. In addition to possible
NLS and NES signals, there are several sumoylation signals within the sea urchin MVP.
Sumoylation is a dynamic and reversible process that
involves the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitinlike modifier (SUMO) protein to protein substrates. Similar to ubiquination, sumoylation requires four enzymatic
steps to attach the carboxyl-terminal glycine of SUMO to
the ε-amino group of lysine (reviewed in [44]). However,
unlike traditional ubiquination, sumoylation does not
mark the protein for degradation. The wide variety of
SUMO targets identified to date does not reveal a single
function for this protein modification (reviewed in [45]).
A variety of transcription factors and cofactors, viral
proteins, proteins associated with nuclear architecture
and genome surveillance, as well as signal transduction
molecules appear to by sumoylated [44]. Importantly for
this study, two proteins of the nuclear pore complex,
RanGAP1 and Ran-binding protein 2 are both SUMO substrates. Sumoylation of RanGAP1 is important for the
nucleocytoplasmic transport of this cytoplasmic nuclear
import factor [46-48]. In addition, RanBP2, a docking
protein at the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear protein
complex is a SUMO E3 ligase, also known as Nup358 [4951]. These observations suggest that SUMO plays an
important role in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. In this
regard, sumoylation of the major vault protein may regulate the transport of the vault particle through the nuclear
pore complex.
Taken together these results suggest that the vault may
play a role in delivering macromolecules to the nucleus

during embryonic development in sea urchins. A trafficking role has also been proposed for vaults in human cells
based on the observations that MVP interacts with the
estrogen receptor in MCF-7 breast cancer cells [10] and
with the tumor suppressor PTEN in HeLa cells [11]. Estrogen receptor is involved in regulating eukaryotic gene
expression and can affect cellular proliferation and differentiation. Estrogen treatment is observed to increase the
association of the estrogen receptor with MVP in the
nuclei of MCF-7 cells, thus leading to the hypothesis that
vaults may be involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of
the estrogen receptor and in modulating the effect of steroid hormones. PTEN negatively regulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway and cell growth. MVP has been
shown by a yeast two-hybrid screen to be a dominant
PTEN-binding protein. It has been postulated that perhaps the vault serves to mediate the cellular localization
PTEN, thus potentially affecting cell growth.
The results presented here suggest that sea urchin vaults
contain various macromolecules in addition to the two
main vault-associated proteins, VPARP and TEP1. Human
MVP is known to interact specifically with the tyrosine
phosphatase SHP-2, an enzyme that plays an important
role in intracellular signaling [12]. It has been demonstrated using MVP-deficient mouse fibroblasts that MVP
helps to support cell survival. MVP is proposed to act as a
scaffold protein for SHP-2 and other extracellular-regulated kinases (Erks) and thus facilitate, or somehow modulate, growth factor signaling. Perhaps the varied
macromolecular contents of the sea urchin vault include
proteins involved in sea urchin growth factor signaling.

Conclusions
It would seem likely that the sea urchin MVP is transported to the nucleus for a reason. Presumably cells must
expend a considerable amount of energy to achieve this
differential localization, as MVP is a relatively abundant
protein. The MVP concentration in the unfertilized sea
urchin egg is on the order of 10 µM, as determined by
immunoblotting [16]. This maternal store of MVP is sufficient to assemble 107 intact vault particles. By comparison, the mature sea urchin egg contains approximately 4
× 108 ribosomes [52]. Although the function of the vault
is not yet clearly delineated, our results on the highly
conserved structure, molecular composition, and differential cellular localization of MVP suggest that vaults may be
important for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking during
embryonic development.

Methods
Isolation of sea urchin and rat vaults
Vaults were purified to homogeneity from unfertilized
eggs of the Pacific coast sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Animals were spawned and the eggs were collected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/5/3

and washed as described [53]. Washed eggs (150 ml) were
homogenized with a motor driven Potter-Elvehjem-type
tissue grinder in an equal volume of buffer (100 mM
PIPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 1 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 2 mM
DTT, 1 mM GTP, 0.2 mM PMSF, 10 µg/ml leupeptin and
1 µg/ml pepstatin A). The homogenate was centrifuged at
18 K rpm (~39,000 g) in a Beckman J20 rotor at 4°C for
45 min. The resulting supernatant fluids were decanted
into a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask at room temperature. A
fresh aliquot of GTP was added such that the GTP concentration was increased by 1 mM. The DMSO was added in
three aliquots with gentle mixing until a final concentration of 15% (v/v) was reached. Microtubule assembly was
promoted by incubating the supernatant fluids in a 24°C
water bath for 30–45 min. The microtubules were pelleted
by centrifugation at 18K rpm (~39,000 g) in a Beckman
J20 rotor at 24°C for 30 min. The supernatant fluids
(H1S) were carefully removed and drop-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored in a -80°C freezer. Microtubules in
the pellet were purified by two subsequent cycles of
assembly and disassembly as previously described [54]
and used for purposes other than the current study.
Sea urchin vaults were purified from the microtubuledepleted supernatant fluids that had been previously frozen in liquid nitrogen. Approximately 150 ml of frozen
supernatant (H1S) was thawed and mixed with an equal
volume of 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 75
mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF. This pooled
supernatant was used as the starting point for the vault
purification. This extract was treated as if it was a rat liver
homogenate and all subsequent purification steps were as
described for rat liver vaults, including purification on
sucrose density gradients and two cesium chloride gradients [9].
Rat vaults were purified from liver by sucrose-density and
cesium chloride gradient centrifugation as described by
the Rome laboratory [9].
Molecular composition of sea urchin vaults
Vault samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with the discontinuous buffer formulation of Laemmli et al., [55] and
stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Fig. 1A) or silver (Fig.
1B).
Assembly and analysis of the sea urchin major vault
protein sequence
Trace sequences from the S. purpuratus genome project
[56]were used to assemble the coding sequence of the
SpMVP gene. Toward this end the TBLASTN algorithm
[57,58] was performed using the rat MVP as a query
sequence to search the NCBI trace archive of the sea
urchin genome that is now at near 10x coverage. Due to
the high level of sequence conservation it was possible to

BMC Developmental Biology 2005, 5:3

assemble the urchin sequence from the TBLASTN results
using the rat MVP as a scaffold. The urchin MVP sequence
was assembled in such a way that maximum similarity to
the rat scaffold sequence was maintained. The fully assembled SpMVP sequence was then verified by using it to
query the NCBI sea urchin EST collection (representing
mRNAs expressed in the embryo and larva) by TBLASTN.
Except for a small region (A728 to G785) near the C-terminal sequence, the entire SpMVP was covered by S. purpuratus ESTs, with the following NCBI accession numbers:
BG784484,
BG784394,
CD305511,
CD295832,
CD295616,
CD304000,
CD310423,
CD307400,
CD305382,
CD292179,
CD305646,
CD333690,
CD309547, CD292477, and BG783194. The gap from
A728 to G785 was covered by a sequence in the NCBI
trace archives (gnl|ti|287010960). The assembled SpMVP
sequence has been deposited in the NCBI database under
accession number BK005641.
We note that the sea urchin MVP has a molecular weight
of 95 kDa, calculated from the protein sequence. Previously the sea urchin MVP was referred to as a 107-kDa
polypeptide based on its apparent molecular weight by
SDS-PAGE [16]. The program COILS [59] was used to
identify a likely coiled coil region in the C-terminal half of
the protein (aa 663–762) [60]. The sea urchin MVP
sequence was submitted to the PredictNLS server [34,61].
No potential NLS sequences were found by this server.
The two possible NLS sequences shown in Figure 2B are
based on sequence observation. The sea urchin MVP
sequence was compared by hand to the NES logo
described by la Cour et al. and based on the alignment of
58 high-quality NES's [36]. The sea urchin MVP sequence
was submitted to the Abgent Sumoylation Calculator
[62]. Five motifs with high probability of being sumoylation sites were identified (scores 0.6889 to 0.9278). Two
of these five motifs are conserved among MVP sequences
of six species (Strongy. purp., Homo sapiens, Mus musculus,
Rattus norv., Danio rerio, and Xenopus laevis) and are indicated in Figure 2B. The CLUSTALW alignment between
sea urchin and rat MVP in Figure 2A was produced by submitting the sequences to the CLUSTALW server [63].
Negative-stain electron microscopy
Isolated sea urchin vaults were applied to freshly glow-discharged formvar-coated copper grids (Electron
Microscopy Sciences). Excess liquid was wicked away and
the samples were briefly air dried. Samples were stained
with uranyl acetate and observed using a JEOL 1200EXII
transmission electron microscope.
CryoEM imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction
CryoEM grids were prepared using cryogenic plunge freezing methods described previously [9,64]. Digital cryoelectron micrographs were collected on an FEI/Philips CM120

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/5/3

transmission electron microscope with a LaB6 filament, a
Gatan 626 cryotransfer holder, and a Gatan slow scan
CCD camera (1024 × 1024 pixels, YAG scintillator). One
hundred and forty-one cryomicrographs were collected
with a nominal magnification of 45,000×, and with two
different defocus values (-1.0 and -0.6 µm). The pixel size
in the cryomicrographs is 4.1 Å on the molecular scale as
determined by calibration with a catalase crystal.
The QVIEW software package was used to extract 481 individual vault particle images with a selection box size of
200 × 200 pixels [65]. The initial translation step was performed by cross-correlating each particle image with an
180° rotated version of itself. The IMAGIC software package was used for all 3D image processing steps [66]. The
published RNase-treated rat vault reconstruction was used
as a search model in the first round of refinement [9]. C8
symmetry was assumed for the sea urchin vault for the
first several rounds of refinement, as was used for the
intact rat vault reconstruction [9]. After a few rounds of
refinement the two ends of the vault appeared nearly
identical, and from then on D8 symmetry was imposed, as
was done for the RNase-treated rat vault reconstruction
[25]. The particles images were corrected for the contrast
transfer function (CTF) of the microscope using the CTF
equation published by Baker et al. [67]. The following CTF
parameters were used: Cs = 2 mm, fraction of amplitude
contrast = 0.1, and kV = 120. A subset of 409 particle
images that agreed best with the rest of the set were
selected for the final reconstruction. The resolution was
calculated using the Fourier shell correlation method with
an elliptical mask applied to remove noise and disordered
contents. The resolution was found to be 33 Å by the 0.5
correlation threshold criterion. The sea urchin vault
reconstruction is shown filtered to 33 Å resolution and
contoured so that the surface appears continuous.
All of the image processing was performed on HP/Digital
alpha unix workstations. The graphics representations
were produced with the AVS (Advanced Visual Systems,
Inc.) software package.
Antibody staining and confocal microscopy of whole
mounted embryos
Staged embryos were fixed in -20°C Methanol for 20 minutes on ice, then washed three times in PBS plus 0.2%
Tween-20 (PBST). Embryos were blocked for 30 minutes
on ice in PBST plus 5% Bovine Serum Albumin, then incubated with an appropriate dilution of an affinity purified
antibody against MVP [16] overnight at 4°C. Following
three washes for 5 minutes each in PBST, the embryos
were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in 1 µg/ml
Oregon Green 488 goat anti-rabbit antibody. Embryos
were washed three times in PBST and stained in PBST with
300 nM DAPI for 10 minutes at room temperature during

using a Leica TCS confocal microscope.
