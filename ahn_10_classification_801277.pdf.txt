Abstract
Background: FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and cyclophilins (CYPs) are abundant and ubiquitous proteins
belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, which regulate much of metabolism
through a chaperone or an isomerization of proline residues during protein folding. They are collectively referred
to as immunophilin (IMM), being present in almost all cellular organs. In particular, a number of IMMs relate to
environmental stresses.
Results: FKBP and CYP proteins in rice (Oryza sativa cv. Japonica) were identified and classified, and given the
appropriate name for each IMM, considering the ortholog-relation with Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas or
molecular weight of the proteins. 29 FKBP and 27 CYP genes can putatively be identified in rice; among them, a
number of genes can be putatively classified as orthologs of Arabidopsis IMMs. However, some genes were novel,
did not match with those of Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas, and several genes were paralogs by genetic
duplication. Among 56 IMMs in rice, a significant number are regulated by salt and/or desiccation stress. In
addition, their expression levels responding to the water-stress have been analyzed in different tissues, and some
subcellular IMMs located by means of tagging with GFP protein.
Conclusion: Like other green photosynthetic organisms such as Arabidopsis (23 FKBPs and 29 CYPs) and
Chlamydomonas (23 FKBs and 26 CYNs), rice has the highest number of IMM genes among organisms reported so
far, suggesting that the numbers relate closely to photosynthesis. Classification of the putative FKBPs and CYPs in
rice provides the information about their evolutional/functional significance when comparisons are drawn with the
relatively well studied genera, Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas. In addition, many of the genes upregulated by
water stress offer the possibility of manipulating the stress responses in rice.

Background
Proteins that bind to immunosuppressive drugs, such as
FK506, rapamycin and cyclophilin A (CsA), have been
called FKBPs (FK506/rapamycin-binding proteins) and
CYPs or cyclophilins (cyclosporin A-binding proteins),
respectively, being collectively referred to immunophilins [1]. Despite their lack of structural similarity, these
two families share a common peptidyl-prolyl isomerase

(PPIase), catalyzing the cis/trans isomerization of proline
imidic peptide bonds [2]. The Cis/trans isomerization of
the Xaa-Pro bond results in slow phases in protein folding, which is an important step for folding and a critical
determinant of structure [3].
Biochemical analysis and sequence analysis following
genome sequencing projects have identified a large number of IMMs and, in particular, putative IMMs in many
organisms [4-6]. As a result, IMMs are highly conserved
ubiquitous proteins found in most organisms and in all
major subcellular compartments. However, the number
of IMMs in different organisms differs greatly. For example, some prokaryotes do not contain any FKBPs or
CYPs, and some prokaryotes encode only one family of

ribosome-associated PPIase known as trigger factors
(TIFs), which aid in the folding of nascent polypeptide
chains on ribosomes [7]. Escherichia coli contains 6
IMMs, the yeast genome contains 12 (4 genes for FKBPs
and 8 genes for CYPs), Drosophila melanogaster contains
21 ones (7 FKBPs and 14 CYPs), and Caenorhabditis elegans contains 25 (8 FKBPs and 17 CYPs). The human
genome contains 42 (18 FKBPs and 24 CYPs). Notably,
photosynthetic organisms harbor a remarkably large
number of IMMs, with 52 genes (23 FKBPs and 29
CYPs) in Arabidopsis, 49 (23 FKBPs and 26 CYPs) in
Chlamydomonas, and 29 FKBPs in rice [4,6,8,9]. The
greater numbers of IMMs in green photosynthetic organisms was predicted to be due to the largest IMM family
targeted to the photosynthetic apparatus [4,10]. For
example, 11 FKBPs and 5 CYPs localize to the chloroplast thylakoid lumen in Arabidopsis, creating the largest
IMM family in any cellular organism.
Despite the high level of conservation of the PPIases
throughout eukaryotes and prokaryotes, they do not
have a function within many cells under normal growth
conditions, but may become essential in the absence of
other cellular factors [5]. Noteworthy are the differences
in the phenotypical consequences for microorganisms
and higher organisms in response to the deletion of
individual PPIase genes. Most strikingly, of all genes
encoding FKBPs and CYPs, a total of 12 can be deleted
without seriously affecting the viability of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae [11]. However, higher organisms are seriously
affected even in their response to a single gene deletion.
For example, FKBP12-/- mice suffer early embryonic
death due to cardiac defects, and the disruption of
genes that encode for the nuclear-localized FKBP42 and
FKBP70 leads to multiple morphogenetic defects in Arabidopsis thaliana [12,13]. Although dramatic changes in
the phenotypes of PPIase-deficient higher organisms are
very limited, they suggest that IMMs have been evolving
toward highly specialized functions from microorganisms to higher organisms.
The expression of archetypical IMM genes has some
typical characteristics of housekeeping genes that encode
proteins required for general functioning [14]. On
the other hand, the expressions of certain IMM genes
are upregulated under stress conditions. Expression of
some IMMs has been induced by both biotic and abiotic
stresses, including HgCl2, viral infection, salicylic acid,
salt stress, heat and cold shock, light and drought
[15-21]. Furthermore, the large number of IMMs
located in the thylakoid lumen in Arabidopsis is upregulated only by light conditions; analysis of the microarray
data showed that the expression of several IMM genes
was regulated by certain environmental conditions [4].
Rice has been cultivated as a major crop for > 7000
years, and currently sustains more than half of the

world’s population [22]. Because rice is a semi-aquatic
plant commonly grown under flooded conditions, production in Asia has been dramatically increased as a
result of the “Green Revolution” following the highinput of irrigation systems since 1961 [23]. However,
about half the rice-growing areas in the world do not
have sufficient water to maintain flooded conditions,
and yield is also reduced to some extent by various
abiotic stresses, including drought and salinity. Plant
breeders in the global research group have repeatedly
developed more productive drought-tolerant and saltresistant rice. As a result, even where the response to
stress in rice is better than that of other crops, many
rice-growing environments demand still greater tolerance than can be found in most improved germplasm.
In addition, rice has the smallest genome size among
cultivated cereals, and it conserves much of the gene
content, and to some extent the gene order, present in
other species. The full rice genome has now been
sequenced, allowing the identification and localization of
genes related to stress tolerance [24].
We have identified 2 rice IMM families, FK506 binding proteins and cyclophilins, using the rice genome
sequence database. We have given appropriate names to
individual rice IMM (Os IMM) based on its ortholog
relation with Arabidopsis (At) and Chlamydomonas (Cr)
IMMs and the molecular weight of the proteins. In
addition, a comprehensive analysis of rice IMM FKBPs
and CYPs, including putative domain architecture,
amino acid alignment, the conservation ratio of key
amino residues for binding of immunosuppressive
drugs, and phylogenetic relationships between family
members, was also conducted. Furthermore, to select
water stress-related IMMs from among the putatively
classified rice IMM genes, expression patterns of all
IMMs under salt and desiccation stress conditions were
analyzed. IMMs responding to water stress were investigated in different tissues, and the subcellular localization
some IMMs were investigated by tagging with GFP
protein.
Detailed information about the 2 major IMM family
FKBPs and CYPs, as well as information about several
IMM genes probably related to water stress in the case
of rice, can provide new possibilities for stress research
related to crop plants, given that rice and many other
crop plants are monocotyledons that are distinct from
the dicotyledonous model plant, Arabidopsis, in many
aspects of their development.

Results and Discussion
Identification and Nomenclature of Immunophilin Genes
in the O. sativa Genome

In an attempt to detect IMM genes in the rice genome,
we searched the GRAMINE database. As a result, 56

Ahn et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/253

putative IMM genes, consisting of 29 putative FKBPs
and 27 putative CYPs, were identified. Additional file 1
shows the 56 genes with their names, accession numbers, putative subcellular localization, isoform numbers,
amino acid numbers, number of ESTs, molecular
weight, pI, expression level, and similarities with orthologous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii IMMs. Like other photosynthetic
organisms encoding the putative 52 genes of Arabidopsis, 49 genes of Chlamydomonas, putative 27 genes for
FKBPs and 36 genes for CYPs of Sorghum bicolor, and
putative 26 genes for FKBPs and 25 genes for CYPs of
Vitis vinifera (our unpublished data), rice also has one
of the largest IMM families in organisms whose genomes have been completely sequenced [4,6]. In addition,
considering that alternative splicing occurs as a normal
phenomenon in eukaryotes, the diversity of IMM proteins encoded by a genome may also increase [25]. In
rice, 12 genes of OsFKBPs and 14 genes of OsCYPs may
encode alternatively spliced isoforms ranging from 2 to
4 as (Additional file 1), but it is not to purpose of this
paper to provide the complete number of IMM proteins
functioning in rice. More to the point, Escherichia coli
possesses 6 IMMs, including 3 FKBPs and 2 cyclophilins. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 4
FKBPs and 8 CYPs. The soil nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans genome contains 8 genes for FKBPs and 24
genes for CYPs. The human genome contains 18 genes
for FKBPs and 24 genes for CYPs. A large number of
IMMs in eukaryotes and, in particular, in plants remains
evolutionarily and functionally obscure. However, many
IMMs in plants may serve a more diverse array of functions, especially in relation to photosynthesis, but may
also involve a significant amount of redundancy [4].
For the nomenclature of rice IMMs, we followed the
previously reported rule for Arabidopsis: the proteins
were named FKBP for the FKBP506-binding protein and
CYP for CsA, with prefix letters to indicate the species
of origin (e.g., Os for Oryza sativa) and a suffix number
to indicate M r . For genes where > 2 protein isoforms
can arise from the same gene by alternative splicing,
only the longest form was used in this nomenclature
[4]. Where possible in considering characteristics such
as > 50% identity in homology, the same subcellular
location and the same domain architecture as with Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas IMM proteins, we used
the same suffix numbers for genes whose orthologs
could be deduced. These include OsFKBP12, -13, -15-1,
-15-2, -16-1, -16-2, -16-3, -16-4, -17-1, -17-2, -18, -19,
-20-2, -53, and -72 for FKBPs, and OsCYP18-1, -18-2,
-18-4, -19-2, -19-3, -19-4, -20-1, -20-2, -20-3, -21-1,
-21-4, -22, -23, -26-2, -28, -37, -38, -57, -63, -65, -71,
and -95 for CYPs. For some genes where > 2 genes
show an orthologous sequence with the same protein as

Page 3 of 22

Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas, lowercase extension
letters were added to the name according to the order
of similarity. These were OsFKBP20-1a, -20-1b, -42a,
-42b, -62a, -62b, and -62c for FKBPs and OsCYP40a,
-40b, -59a, and -59b for CYPs. For other genes whose
orthologs in Arabidopsis or Chlamydomonas were not
obvious, these were named after the calculated M r of
mature proteins predicted from cDNA-deduced
sequences. Here, OsFKBP44, -46, -57, -58, -59, and -73
for FKBPs, and OsCYP17 for CYPs were included. One
gene encoding trigger factor-like protein, distantly
related to the FKBP family, was found in the rice genome, as in Arabidopsis, and was named OsTIG. As for
the nomenclature of the rice FKBP family, there has
been a preceding report in which almost all the nomenclature agreed with our nomenclature; however, we substituted OsFKBP53b and -53a by Os FKBP53 and -58,
respectively, and also OsFKBP64, -65 and -75 by
OsFKBP62a, -62b and -62c, re-spectively. The reason for
this is discussed below [4,8,26].
Rice FKBP-506 Binding Proteins (OsFKBPs)

To compare the conservation patterns of the amino acid
residues for the binding of immunosuppressive drug
(ISD) FK506/PPIase activity and secondary structural
details, the amino acids of 29 OsFKBPs were co-aligned
with human FKBP12 (hFKBP12) as an external reference. hFKBP12 identifies the 14 amino acid residues for
the FK506 binding and PPIase activity [27-29]. For
FKBPs with a multiple (two or more) FKBP domain, the
most conserved domain obtained from the analysis
using the SMART program was used (Figure 1). In addition, to analyze conservation in amino acids for FKBP
domain and their orthologous relationship, the conservation patterns and ratio of the amino acid residues for
FKBP domain between each ortholog of rice and Arabidopsis FKBPs was compared (Table 1). The 29 OsFKBPs
identified could be classified into single-domain (SD)
members with a FKBP catalytic domain, and multipledomain (MD) members with other functional domains
in addition to a single or multiple FKBP domains (Figure 2). The functional domains include tetra-peptide
repeats (TPR), the coiled-coil domain (CCD), and the
internal repeats domain (RPT), each of which is involved
in protein-protein interactions or recognitions, or in the
assembly of multi-protein complexes [30,31]. The Arg/
Lys amino acid-rich domain may function as a motif for
non-specific RNA binding or mediate protein-protein
interactions, and is also a frequent target for molecular
interactions [32-34]. The calmodulin-binding motif
(CaM) has been recognized as a major Ca2+ sensor and
as a modulator of regulatory events through its interaction with a protein [35]. Finally, the full length of the
amino acid sequences of all FKBPs was used to generate

most conserved amino acids area for multiple FKBP domain OsFKBPs, were aligned. Backgrounds indicate percentage of amino acid similarity:
black, 95%; dark grey, 70%; light grey, 40%.

a phylogenetic tree in order to assay the evolutionary
relationships among the OsFKBPs (Figure 3).
The conservation patterns of the amino acid residues
for the binding of ISD showed great differences between
OsFKBPs (Figure 1, Table 1). For example, some
OsFKBPs (OsFKBP13, -15-1, -15-2, -20-1a, -20-1b, -58,
-62a, -62b, and -62c) share identities of > 70%, with 14
key residues of hFKBP, whereas other OsFKBPs
(OsFKBP16-1, -17-2, -18, -20-2, -42a, -42b, and -57)

share identities to < 30%. In the case of OsFKBP17-2, all
key residues are substituted by other residues. The conservation patterns of OsFKBPs with the 14 amino acid
residues of hFKBP12 were very similar to those of the
Arabidopsis (Table 1) and Chlamydomonas orthologs
[6]. However, the repertoire and amino acid sequence of
rice FKBPs are more similar to those of Arabidopsis
than Chlamydomonas, from which they have a distant
genetic distance. Moreover, the diversity of IMM

than for the dicot Arabidopsis. This information added
broader evidence in favor of the theory that the diversity
of IMMs was already established in their last common
ancestor, probably close to the root of the “green” lineage of plants, but they may have continued to change
and become more diverse since the completion of the
“green” lineage. In particular, the conservation between
FKBPs, as in the FKBP repertoire, among O. sativa, Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas was lower than in cyclophilins (see below), as reported in a comparative
analysis of various organisms containing H. sapiens,
D. melaogaster, C. elegans, S. cereviseiae and Sz. Pombe
[5,6].
Of the 29 FKBPs containing OsTIG, 15 have been
characterized as SD members. All these proteins contain
a single FKBP domain, and some harbor a targeting
sequence that determines the subcellular localization of
the mature protein (Figure 2). OsFKBP12 is the only
cytosolic FKBP having SD members, as in Arabidopsis.
It features a possible role for the regulation of the cell
cycle through the interaction with AtFIP, a phosphatidyl-inositol kinase [36]. Moreover, it was also expressed
strongly (Additional file 1) as in Arabdopsis AtFKBP12
and Chlamydomonas FKB12, with the largest number of
ESTs [4,6].

Ten OsFKBPs (OsFKBP13, -16-1, -16-2, -16-3, -16-4,
-17-1, -17-2, -18, -19, and -20-2) contain putative chloroplast-targeting sequences in the N-terminal region.
The signal sequences of all chloroplast FKBPs have double arginine residues and follow the hydrophobic region
needed for chloroplast lumen translocation via the Tat
(twin arginine translocase) pathway [37]. The majority
of chloroplast FKBPs have a peptidase cleavage site,
Ala-Xaa-Ala, at the terminus of the hydrophobic region
(Figure 1), suggesting that all the chloroplast FKBPs target the thylakoid lumen like the chloroplast FKBPs of
Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas. However, like orthologs of Arabidopsis, AtFKBP17-2, -18, and -20-2 also
lack a cleavage site at the terminus of the hydrophobic
extension region, suggesting that they act as insoluble
proteins within the thylakoid lumen, but proteins
anchored in the thylakoid membrane [4]. Compared
with Arabidopsis, in which the thylakoid lumen FKBPs
have two FKBPs (AtFKBP17-2 and 17-3) with high
sequence similarity, all thylakoid lumen FKBPs are well
conserved in both rice and Arabidopsis, except in the
absence of OsFKBP17-3 in rice, considering the domain
architecture (Figure 2), the alignment of each amino
acid sequence between those with two (data not shown),
and the high similarity of conserved key amino acid residues for ISD binding (Table 1). Thus, AtFKBP17-2 and

Ahn et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/253

17-3, seen as gene duplicates based on their high
sequence similarity, have been duplicate since the divergence of the evolutionary lineage between rice and Arabidopsis. The common ancestor of the eukaryotic green
lineage, Chlamydomonas, also has 11 FKBPs (FKB), but
orthology among them can only be claimed between
FKB16-3, -16-4, -18, -19, and 20-2 and the Arabidopsis
genes with the same numbering. For the others, it has
been difficult to match the ortholog relations [6]. All in
all, the diversity of chloroplast lumen FKBPs has been
established in Chlamydomonas based on the number of
IMMs.
Two OsFKBPs (OsFKBP15-1 and OsFKBP15-2) contain putative ER targeting sequences at the N-terminus
and have possible C-terminal endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) retention signals (DSEL and NSEL for OsFKBP15-1
and OsFKBP15-2, respectively) (Figure 1 and 2),
although it will need to be confirmed whether they
function as real anchors in the ER membrane. They are
closely related in sequence, and they are 81% similar to
AtFKBP15-1 and 76% similar to AtFKBP15-2 in their
amino acid sequences (Additional file 1).
Two OsFKBPs (20-1a and 20-1b) are characterized as
putative nuclear targeting paralogous proteins by the
presence of nuclear localization signals (NLS) in the Cterminal region (Figure 2). They are also closely related
in their amino acid sequence (Figure 1), and are orthologous to AtFKBP20-1, with 77 and 76% similarity in
their amino acid sequences, respectively (Additional file
1). Interestingly, Arabidopsis has only single AtFKBP201 and AtFKBP15-3, and another nuclear targeting SD
FKBP has its signal at the N-terminal region, whereas
rice lacks an ortholog for AtFKBP15-3 [4].
14 OsFKBPs containing OsTIG belong to MD members. Among them, two isoforms (a/b) of OsFKBP42 are
characterized by a single FKBP domain, TPR domain,
and CaM domain (Figure 2). However, unlike with orthologs Arabidopsis AtFKBP42 and Chlamydomonas
FKBP42 that have a membrane-anchoring domain at the
C-terminus, and also contrary to a previous report on
OsFKBP42a/b, we could not find a C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain at either OsFKBP42a or -42b
using various prediction programs found on the ExPASY
web site http://www.expasy.ch/tools [4,6,8]. In reality, the
amino acids at the C-terminus in which the membraneanchoring domain is positioned showed significant
changes between AtFKBP42 and OsFKBP42a/b (data not
shown). It is therefore supposed that the anchoring of
this protein to the tonoplast or plasma membrane
may be not essential for the functioning of the protein,
unlike with AtFKBP42 that was predicted to be membrane-localized [38]. OsFKBP42a (LOC_Os12g05090)
and OsFKBP42b (LOC_Os11g05090) are positioned in
terminal regions of chromosome 11 and 12 in rice that

Page 8 of 22

are known to result from a duplication 7.7 million years
ago, the most recent large-scale duplication in the rice
genome [39].
Other MD FKBPs with a TPR domain are OsFKBP62a,
-62b, and -62c. These three genes were previously named
OsFKBP64, -65, and -75 and rFKBP64, -65, and -75,
respectively, based on their molecular weight and similarity to two MD AtFKBP62 and -65 with triple FKBP
domains, a TPR domain, and a CaM domain in common
[4,8,40]. However, OsFKBP62a, -62b, and -62c retain 77,
75 and 73% similarity with AtFKBP62 in amino acid
sequence, respectively, and 41, 41 and 42% similarity
with FKB62, respectively (Figure 2, Additional file 1), and
all belong to one stem branch of clade II in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). In addition, these three proteins
have almost the same 14 key residues for PPIase activity
and are conserved in 12 out of 14 key residues of
hFKBP12 for PPIase activity, suggesting that they are catalytically active isoforms (Table 1). AtFKBP62 and -65
were thought to have originated from regional duplicates
between chromosomes I and V [4]. Taken together, all
this suggests that rice MD OsFKBP62a, -62b and -62C
are paralogs duplicated from an ancestral gene, probably
Chlamydomonas FKB62, whereas Arabidopsis has only
two duplicated paralogs, AtFKBP62 and -65. In the
meantime, unlike OsFKBP62a and -62b, OsFKBP62c
(OsFKBP75, rFKBP75) contains ~50 residues of a glycine
repeat domain in the N-terminal area and an extension
of ~40 residues at the C-terminus, identified to the putative transmembrane domain (Figure 2). The glycine
repeat domain at N-terminus is associated with consensus targeting for the endoplasmic reticulum, and
rFKBP75 was predicted to be an ER membrane protein
[40]. In Arabidopsis, AtFKBP62 (ROF1) and AtFKBP65
(ROF2) are regulated by age and biotic stresses
[19,41,42]. Recently, ROF1 was thought to have played a
role in the prolongation of thermotolerance by sustaining
the levels of small HSPs essential for survival at high temperatures. Additionally, the ROF1-HSP90.1 complex was
localized in the nucleus during exposure to heat stress,
whereas it was localized in the cytoplasm under normal
conditions [19].
OsFKBP72 - with a triple FKBP domain, TPR domain,
and NLS at the N-terminal area - shows 67% similarity
and absolute similarity in terms of amino acid residues for
PPIase with AtFKBP72 (Figure 2, Table 1). Unlike other
MD FKBPs, which are composed of triple FKBP domains,
the second FKBP domain of OsFKBP72 is the most highly
conserved domain and shows remarkable differences in
terms of key residues of hFKBP12 for ISD binding/PPIase
activity. It also forms a separate branch within clade II in
the phylogenic tree (Figure 3), suggesting that it originated
from another ancestral gene and is likely to lose its function as PPIase. AtFKBP72 (PAS1) is involved in the control

Ahn et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/253

of cell proliferation and differentiation during plant development [43,44]. The C-terminus of PAS1 is required for
binding with the NAC-like transcription factor and
nuclear translocation [44]. OsFKBP72 also shows considerable similarity with AtFKBP72 in the C-terminal area.
However, we could not find the CaM domain C-terminal
area of OsFKBP72 using a CaM prediction program,
unlike with AtFKBP72 (PAS1), a putative CaM domain in
the C-terminal area due to the binding of calmodulin
in vitro [43].
Among the MD FKBPs belonging to clade II, OsFKBP73
with its triple FKBP domain and OsFKBP46 and
OsFKBP57 with their double FKBP domains diverge
within the same branch node and show partial similarities
in terms of key residues for ISD binding/PPIase (Figure 3,
Table 1). OsFKBP73 has a long Arg/Lys amino acid-rich
domain (from aa 402 to 653) at the C-terminus, and
OsFKBP57 retains a coiled coil domain in the C-terminal
area (Figure 2). OsFKBP46 and OsFKBP57 that have no
signal motifs were predicted to be cytosolic, whereas
OsFKBP73, with its long Arg/Lys amino-acid-rich domain,
was predicted to be nuclear by several prediction programs. Otherwise, as in the case of PAS1, we infer that it
is a cytosol/nucleus shuttle protein. Orthologs of these
three FKBPs are unlikely to be in Arabidopsis, although
they have weak identity with AtFKBP65 in their amino
acid sequences (Additional file 1). Also, the putative orthologs of these genes that are highly conserved in amino acid
sequence existed in other plants containing Poplus and
Vitis (data not shown). The novelty of these genes and the
suggestion that these three genes originated from the
regional duplications of rice chromosome 1 has recently
been reported [8].
In clade III, four MD FKBPs (OsFKBP44, -53, -58, and
-59) were grouped as 4 branches of the same node (Figure 3) and were analyzed to the highest identity with
AtFKBP53 and FKB53 (Additional file 1) via blastP analysis. Among them, OsFKBP53 and -58 contain highly
charged domains, putative nuclear targeting signals
in the N-terminal regions, and a single FKBP domain
(Figure 2). OsFKBP58 and -53 were previously named
OsFKBP53a and -53b, respectively [8]. However, as stated above, all four OsFKBPs of clade III have the closest
similarity to AtFKBP53 and FKB53 as a probable ancestral protein. In addition, unlike OsFKBP53a that displays
53% similarity to AtFKBP53, the other three FKBPs display < 50% similarity to AtFKBP53 (Additional file 1).
Thus, we named only OsFKBP53 as an ortholog of
AtFKBP53, and the others were referred to by molecular
weight because there were no adequate orthologs in
Arabidopsis. OsFKBP58 has 36% similarity to AtFKBP53
(Additional file 1) and retains 8 - 20 mer of amino acid
insertion in 3 areas besides the FKBP domain, and thus
the CCD domain was predicted to be between amino

Page 9 of 22

acids 353 and 381 (Figure 2). OsFKBP44 has a long
N-terminal area containing two internal repeat domains
and a FKBP domain, showing some degree of similarity
to AtFKBP15-3 (data not shown). MD AtFKBP53 and a
SD AtFKBP15-3 showed high sequence similarity, but
also that rice lacks an ortholog of AtFKBP15-3, suggesting that these proteins (OsFKBP44 and AtFKBP15-3)
also originated from Chlamydomonas FKB53, but that
duplication of two proteins occurred after the lineage
divergence of the two plants from a common ancestor.
Finally, the distantly related member of the FKBPs is
the trigger factor OsTIG, which also contains an FKBP
domain, an N-terminal and C-terminal domains, both
of which help to bind ribosomes, probably being
located in the chloroplast stroma. The precise function
of the trigger factor in the chloroplast remains
unknown, but it is a PPIase and chaperone associated
with the ribosome that is involved in the early steps of
protein folding [45].
Rice Cyclosporin-A Binding Protein (OsCYPs)

The 27 identified OsCYPs can be classified as either SD
members with a CYP catalytic domain or MD members
with other functional domains in addition to a single CYP
domain. This number compares well with the 29 AtCYPs
for Arabidopsis and the 26 genes for Chlamydomonas,
indicating that the diversity of CYPs has been maintained
or even slightly increased since they were established in
the photosynthetic green ancestor. To compare the conservation patterns of the amino acid residues for CsA
binding/PPIase activity and secondary structural details,
the full length of the single domain of CYPs and a truncated CYP domain for the MD CYPs were used for the
amino acid alignment. Human cyclophilin A was coaligned as an external reference (Figure 4), and the fulllength of the amino acid sequences of all CYPs was used
to generate a phylogenetic tree.
Among the 27 CYPs, 18 are SD members and 9 have
been characterized as MD proteins. As with Arabidopsis,
none of the cyclophilins contains multiple catalytic
domains. They also contain more divergent functional
domains, such as the TPR domain, the WD-40 repeat,
the U-box domain and the Zinc finger, each of which is
involved in protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions.
An RNA recognition motif (RRM) that may interact
with RNA was also found. 6 of the 9 MD CYPs have
Arg/Lys amino acid-rich domains that may function as a
motif for non-specific RNA-binding or mediate proteinprotein interactions, and are also frequent targets of
molecular interactions (Figure 5) [32-34].
Based on these data, we assigned the putative one-toone orthology between O. sativa and Arabidopsis CYPs.
Among 27 OsCYPs, 26 members could have matching
orthology with a protein among Arabidopsis CYPs,

Figure 4 Multiple sequence alignment of O. sativa CYPs. Human CyPA (hCyPA, GeneBank accession no. P62937) was used for comparison.
The amino acids necessary for CsA binding as determined for hCYPA were marked by asterisks (*). Secondary structure features (a-helix and
b-sheets) derived from the hCYPA were displayed. The targeting signal of putative chloroplast (thylakoid lumen) localized OsCYPs was manually
adjusted (boxed): double Arg residues (–); the hydrophobic stretches following the double Args (—). Amino acids of full length protein for single
CYP domain OsCYPs, and only the most conserved amino acids area for multiple CYP domain OsCYPs, were aligned. Backgrounds indicate
percentage of amino acid similarity: black, 95%; dark grey, 70%; light grey, 40%.

whereas for only OsCYP17, we could find no obvious
orthology with Arabidopsis CYPs.
6 SD CYPs (OsCYP17, -18-1, -18-2, -18-4, -19-2, -19-3)
lack an N-terminal signal peptide and are probably cytosolic. Among the OsCYPs, OsCYP17 is the smallest

cyclophilin due to the deletion of b1 and b2 sheets (Figure
4); it retains 37% identity with AtCYP19-1 in amino acid
sequences checked with BlastP (Additional file 1). However, OsCYP17 and AtCYP19-1 are significantly different
in the conservation ratio of key residues for CsA binding,

tetra- (18-2) or penta- (18-1) peptide deletion in the b2
domain (Figure 4 and Figure 6). It is suggested that these
two proteins may have a distinct and unchanged function
for a long period of time, though with a low level of
expression (Additional file 1). In addition, these two proteins belong to clade II, which is comprised of the two SD
CYPs (OsCYP18-1 and -18-2), as well as 3 MD CYPs
(OsCYP57, -65 and -71), and OsCYP18-1 and OsCYP65
share the same branch (Figure 6). These patterns are
almost the same in rice, Arabidopsis, and Chlamydomonas, suggesting that these genes occurred in a common
ancestor before Chlamydomonas [4,6]. Putative cytosolic

each of which showed 43 and 100% conservation, respectively (Table 2). In addition, OsCYP17 forms a separate
branch within clade I of the phylogenic tree (Figure 6). It
is noteworthy that except for O. sativa ssp. Japonica and
ssp. Indica, no proteins with orthology to OsCYP17 were
found in any other plants using BlastP analysis (data not
shown). These results suggest that OsCYP17 occurred
most recently in the evolution of O. sativa. OsCYP18-1
and -18-2 retain 89 and 82% identity with AtCYP18-1 and
-18-2 in amino acid sequence, and 70 and 75% with
CYN18-1 and -18-2, respectively (Additional file 1). Also,
the two proteins exhibit phylogenetic divergence due to a

Figure 6 Unrooted phylogenetic trees of O. sativa CYP proteins. The sequence alignment of Figure 4 (OsCYPs) was used and the
phylogenetic analysis was based on the sequence alignments by ClustalX http://align.genome.jp.

OsCYP18-4, -19-2, and -19-3; secretional OsCYP19-4 and
OsCYP21-1; mitochondria-targeting OsCYP20-1 and
OsCYP22; and chloroplast-targeting OsCYP20-2 and
OsCYP20-3 are closely related, with similar amino acid
sequences, and mostly belong to 2 branches of clade I
(Figure 6). Among them, OsCYP18-4, OsCYP19-2,
OsCYP19-3, OsCYP19-4, OsCYP20-1, OsCYP21-1 and
AtCYP22 share a 5-to-8 amino acid insertion located
between the a1 helix and b3 sheet (Figure 4). However, all
of these members are perfectly conserved in the 7 amino
acids for CsA binding, except for Os-CYP19-4 in which
121-tryptophan is changed to arginine (Table 2), suggesting that these are catalytically active isoforms. Based on
these characteristics, there is a relatively clear one-to-one
orthology between rice CYPs and Arabidopsis CYPs, but
no orthologs corresponding to AtCYP18-3 and AtCYP191 were found in rice. It has been suggested that two pairs
of Arabidopsis CYPs, AtCYP18-3 and AtCYP19-1, and
AtCYP18-4 and AtCYP19-2, arose by gene duplication,
implying that the gene duplication occurred only in the
Arabidopsis lineage because of divergence of the lineage
between O. sativa and Arabidopsis, and these two pair of
genes may entail redundancy [15,46]. Another cytosolic
OsCYP19-3 that shows 79% identity with AtCYP19-3 also
is very similar to OsCYP19-2 in amino acid sequence
(Additional file 1), except for some divergence in the a3
domain (Figure 4). The OsCYP19-3 may have a distinct
function from OsCYP19-2, considering that OsCYP19-3
has been survived a long period of evolution in most

plants, including Arabidopsis and rice (data not shown). It
is also widely accepted that gene duplication is a primary
source of new functional genes [47]. Putative ER targeting
SD OsCYPs, OsCYP19-4 and -21-1 show 70 and 69%
similarity to the ER proteins AtCYP19-4 and AtCYP21-1,
respectively. They also display 68 and 69% similarity with
putative ER localized CYN20-1, respectively, probably
indicating an ancestral gene (Additional file 1). The ER
location of AtCYP19-4 (CYP5) has been confirmed by
N-terminal green fluorescent protein fusion, and may
involve the modulation of a guanine nucleotide exchange
factor essential for vesicle trafficking [48,49]. Interestingly,
OsCYP20-1 has the greatest similarity to putative ER
located AtCYP20-1 and CYN20-1; however, it showed
mitochondrial localization by both TagetP and PSORT
analysis. Unlike AtCYP20-1, OsCYP20-1 retains additional
21-mer (maybe a signal for mitochondrial targeting) at the
N-terminus of the protein (Figure 4), and this additional
peptide proved to be common in several other plants (data
not shown). Thus, the exact location of OsCYP20-1 needs
to be determined by further experiments. In particular,
AtCYP21-1, the ortholog of OsCYP21-1, has yet to have
its location verified, being either cytosolic or ER [4,50]. In
the meantime, rice lacks the ortholog for another ER CYP,
AtCYP21-2, suggesting that AtCYP21-2 was duplicated
from one of the other ER targeting isomeric genes:
AtCYP19-4, -20-1, or -21-1, in the Arabidopsis lineage
alone. Among OsCYPs that have highly conserved CsA
binding amino acids, OsCYP20-2 (chloroplast thylakoid

lumen) and OsCYP20-3 (chloroplast stroma) show ortholog relationships with AtCYP20-2 and AtCYP20-3 and
CYN20-3, respectively. However, OsCYP22, the ortholog
of AtCYP22 and CYN22 that are putatively cytosolic,
scored high for targeting to chloroplast stroma based on
both PSORT II and Target P analysis. AtCYP22 also contains an N-terminal extension, but it did not score highly
for targeting to any subcellular compartment, whereas the
signal peptide of AtCYP22 shows the changes in some
amino acids containing the insertion of hydrophobic 5
amino acids, which may affect its signaling properties
(data not shown).
Among SD CYPs showing significant phylogenic diversity in amino acids for CsA binding mitochondrialocated, OsCYP21-4 is not conserved in 7 amino acids
for PPIase and shows 54% identity in the amino acid
sequence with AtCYP21-4. It also does not have an
ortholog in Chlamydomonas, suggesting it appeared after
Chlamydomonas (Additional file 1 and Table 2). Rice
lacks the ortholog for another mitochondria CYP,
AtCYP21-3, which shows very similar signal peptides for
47 amino acids and highly homologous C-terminal CYP
domains with AtCYP21-4, suggesting that it originated
by duplication of AtCYP21-4 only in the Arabidopsis
lineage [4]. ER-located OsCYP23 is also significantly
divergent in key residues for CsA binding, but it has
orthologs in other plants (data not shown) containing
both Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas, which suggests
that it has a distinct function with ER-located other CYPs
in which PPIase activity is well conserved (Table 2).
Chloroplast-located SD CYPs OsCYP26-2, -28, -37 and
-38 show a very low conservation ratio and have significant modifications in key residues (Figure 4). They
also belong to clade III, based on phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 6), unlike AtCYP20-2, which is present in clade I
and has highly conserved key residues for CsA binding
[51-53]. Although they show high divergence in their
amino acid sequences, including the CYP area, they have
orthologs with significant homology in the CYP area,
including key residues in both Arabidopsis and Chlamydo-monas. The diversity may be inherited from cyanobacteria, which contains two CYPs similar to CYN37 and
-38 [6]. The putative leucine-zipper domain of AtCYP38
(TLP40) is not conserved in OsCYP38, CYN38 and
orthologs of other plants (data not shown), and the role
of the domain has not been clarified after several studies,
indicating that this is not a conclusive point of evolution
for the proper function of this protein [54-56]. All chloroplast lumen-located OsCYPs also contain double arginine residues, and follow the hydrophobic region needed
for chloroplast lumen targeting (the signal sequences of
OsCYP37 and OsCYP38 are not shown here for adequate
CYP domain alignment) in the extension signal of the
N-terminus (Figure 4).

Page 14 of 22

Nine OsCYPs belong to MD members. Among them,
two putative cytosolics, OsCYP40 (a/b), contain the
C-terminal TPR domain and show 73 and 70% similarity
to AtCYP40, respectively (Additional file 1). The existence of two isomeric genes has even been confirmed in
some plants (Poplus, Sorghum and Vitis) through BlastP
analysis (data not shown). Duplication probably occurred
immediately after the rice and Arabidopsis lineages separated. The putative nuclear-located OsCYP59a and -59b,
seemingly representing another duplicated gene among
MD OsCYPs, are organized in tandem on the same chromosome (Additional file 1), and have RRM, zinc-finger
and Arg/Lys-rich domains (Figure 5). They are orthologous to AtCYP59, which was identified as a dynamic
interplayer between transcription and pre-mRNA processing through interaction with SR proteins and the
C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II [57]. Interestingly, only OsCYP59a includes the long insertion
between the a1/b3 and b4/b5 domains, and they may
have distinct functions. However, only one form of two
isomeric genes was found in the other plants (data not
shown), indicating that the duplication occurred most
recently within the rice lineage. Nuclear-located
OsCYP57 and OsCYP65 and cytosolic OsCYP71 belong
to clade II (Figure 6) and have well conserved CYP
domains (Table 2). These are orthology relationships
with CYPs with the same suffix number for AtCYP and
CYN. OsCYP65 contains the U-box and Arg/Lys-rich
domain, and was classified as putatively nuclear targeting,
unlike cytosolic AtCYP65, for which no Arg/Lys-rich
domain was located (Figure 5). OsCYP71 contains the Nterminal WD40 repeats and shows high orthology (81%
identity) with AtCYP71 (Additional file 1). Finally, putative nuclear-located MD OsCYP95 is annotated to 436
amino acids in the GRAMENE database and 670 amino
acids in the NCBI database, respectively, although they
are proteins from the same loci of chromosome II. From
the analysis of other plant CYPs containing O. sativa ssp.
Indica using the GRAMENE and NCBI database, we conclude that the 670 amino acid from the NCBI database is
probably correct. The ortholog of OsCYP95 is absent in
Chlamydomonas, and belongs to the same branch as
OsCYP63 within clade II (Figure 6), indicating that
OsCYP95 may be a duplicate of OsCYP63 from before
the divergence of rice and Arabidopsis, but after
Chlamydomonas.
Expression Patterns of Immunophilins under Salt and
Desiccation Stress

The expression of most of rice’s IMMs was identified
by the presence of ESTs in the NCBI O. sativa EST
database. OsFKBP44 and OsCYP17 did not show ESTs,
but their expression was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Additional file 1). The expression level using the

Ahn et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/253

latter method corresponds roughly to the number of
ESTs with all tissues of young plantlets (data not
shown). To identify stress-induced Os IMMs under
salt and desiccation conditions, RT-PCR was carried
out at least 3 times on each IMM. Under the salt
stress of 200 mM NaCl, OsFKBP20-1b, -58, -16-1, and
-62a mRNA levels were increased. The level of gene
expression began to increase 24 h after salt treatment,
but in the case of OsFKBP62a it rose 1 h after salt
treatment. The strongest salt induction pattern can be
seen on OsFKBP20-1b, which is rarely expressed in the
absence of stress (Figure 7A). In the OsCYPs,
OsCYP19-3, -20-2, -21-4, -23, and -28, gene expression
was strongly induced 3 h after salt treatment and continued until 72 h. OsCYP17 -19-4, -20-1, -57, and 59b
expression was also induced under salt stress. In particular, OsCYP59b expression increased only 24 h after
treatment (Figure 7B).
Regarding desiccation stress, 8 OsFKBPs and 5 OsCYPs
were upregulated in our water stress conditions (see the
methods). Expression in OsFKBP19, -20-1a, and -20-1b
was strongly induced by desiccation stress, with
OsFKBP16-3, -42a, -42b, -58, and -62a also showing
increased expression levels. Expression in OsFKBP20-1a,
-58, and -42b was induced at 1 h after desiccation stress,
but expression in OsFKBP16-3, -19, -20-1b, -42a, and
OsFKBP62a was induced 24 h after desiccation (Figure 8A).
In OsCYPs, the expression of the OsCYP21-4 and -59b

Page 15 of 22

genes were induced significantly under desiccation stress,
whereas expression for OsCYP19-2, -20-2, and -57 was
only slightly increased. Among the desiccation affected
OsCYPs, OsCYP19-2, -20-2, -21-4, and -57 showed
increased expression 6 h after stress, but only OsCYP59b
showed a change in the induced expression at 24 h after
desiccation, being notably similar to salt stress response
(Figure 8B). As with OsCYPs induced under salt stress,
desiccation inducing OsCYPs also are composed of CYPs
targeted to the various cellular organs. These results suggest that various subcellular Os IMMs respond to abiotic
water-stress (salt and desiccation) to defend or regulate cellular effects under changed circumstances. Some of the Os
IMM genes were upregulated by both salt and desiccation
stress, but others showed gene expression against only one
stress. This suggests that although both salt and desiccation
cause water stress to cells in common, some IMMs may be
involved in distinct signal transduction or defense pathways
against each individual stress before the cell activates a
common stress response.
Three OsFKBPs, OsFKBP20-1b, -58 and 62a, were
upregulated under both salt and desiccation stress. Arabidopsis ROF1 (AtFKBP62) expression was induced by
heat stress and developmentally regulated. ROF1 binds
heat-shock proteins HSP90.1 via the TPR domain and is
located in the cytoplasm under normal conditions, but
in the nucleus during heat stress [19]. The expression of
rice IMM FKBP62a (rFKBP64) was also elevated by heat

stress in various organs, indicating that OsFKBP62a
plays specific physiological functions in other stress
responses as well as in the heat stress response in plants
[40]. As stated above, the putative nucleus OsFKBP58
(OsFKBP53a) lacks an ortholog in Arabidopsis, and only
the OsFKBP58 gene responded to both salt and desiccation stress, suggesting that it plays a different role from
OsFKBP53 and AtFKBP53.
Expression in OsFKBP16-3, 19, -20-1a, -42a, and -42b
was upregulated under desiccation, but not salt, stress.
OsFKBP16-3 contains two cysteine residues separated
by 3 intervening non-cysteine residues at the N-terminus of the putative mature protein, predicting an intradisulfide bond and suggesting a role for the redox
response related to stress. Actually, the activity of a stromal AtCYP20-3 (ROC4) and the thylakoidal AtFKBP13,
are regulated by redox relay of the thiol group [58,59].
Another thylakoid IMM, OsFKBP19, which has two
cysteine residues in the loop regions between the b2
and b3 domains, is also upregulated by desiccation
stress, whereas thylakoid lumen OsFKBP13 and
OsFKBP16-2 that have two coupled cysteine residues
forming a disulfide bond and upregulated by light irradiation, did not respond to salt and desiccation stress
[4]. OsFKBP20-1a proved to be nuclear-targeting and
heat-inducible; its over-expression in yeast indicates a
capacity for high-temperature tolerance [60]. They also
show that the OsFKBP20-1a and SUMO-conjugating
enzyme interacted physically to mediate the stress
response of rice plants. The paralog OsFKBP42a and
42b are ~90% identical, but they have slightly different

EST numbers (Additional file 1) and distinct spatial
expression profiles, with OsFKBP42a being expressed at
the highest levels in crown tissue, whereas OsFKBP42b
is expressed more highly in the roots [8]. Expression of
both OsFKBP42a and -42b was upregulated by desiccation, but the timing of the increase for both genes was
different. Taken together, the two paralog genes
OsFKBP42a and -42b may retain the same function, but
have different spatial/temporal regulation.
Among the 9 OsCYP genes upregulated under salt
and desiccation stress, 4 genes (OsCYP20-2, -21-4, -57,
and -59b) responded to both forms of stress, while
others responded only to salt stress. AtCYP20-2, the
ortholog of OsCYP20-2, the only CYP to show PPIase
activity in the thylakoid lumen, was increased when
plants were exposed to strong light or low temperature,
and it has already been suggested that this PPIase plays
a functional role in acclimation responses [52,61,62].
However, the phenotype and protein composition of the
thylakoid lumen in AtCYP20-2 mutants seems indistinguishable from that of the wild type plants, and it is
concluded therefore that AtCYP20-2 is unrelated to its
PPIase capacity [52,53]. The OsCYP20-2 gene, the
ortholog of AtCYP20-2, is also expressed at the highest
level in the OsCYP family (Additional file 1), showing
distinct upregulation under both salt and desiccation
stress. From these results, we suggest that At/OsCYP202 maintains the homeostatic state of thylakoid lumen
under stress, although it may be unrelated to its PPIase
activity. Another two CYPs, the putative mitochondrial
OsCYP21-4 and nuclear OsCYP57, were positively

Ahn et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/253

regulated in response to both salt and desiccation stress;
none of the functions of the two proteins and their
other plant orthologs are known. Nuclear-located
AtCYP59b with the Arabidopsis ortholog OsCYP59b
and the RNA-recognition motif (RRM), interacted with
the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA
polymerase II and SR proteins, and this may function in
activities connecting transcription and pre-mRNA processing [57]. The OsCYP59b gene was transiently upregulated only 24 h after both stress treatments; however,
OsCYP59a (maybe a duplicate of OsCYP59b) expression
was unchanged by salt/desiccation stress.
The expression of 5 OsCYPs (OsCYP19-3, -19-4, 201, -23, and -28) was upregulated by salt, but not by
desiccation, stress. Cytosolic AtCYP18-1, -18-2, -18-3,
-18-4, -19-1, -19-2, and -19-3 are highly conserved and
probably have similar functions [4]. Similarly, cytosolic
OsCYP19-2, -19-3, and -19-4 are highly conserved;
OsCYP19-2 expression was upregulated by desiccation
stress, and OsCYP19-3 and OsCYP19-4 were upregulated by salt stress, suggesting that these genes also
have a similar function. The ortholog of OsCYP19-4,
AtCYP19-4 (CYP5), interacts with GNOM, which is
involved in the coordination of cell polarity along the
apical-basal embryo axis in Arabidopsis
[48].
OsCYP19-4 was abundant only in pistils at anthesis
and 1 h after anthesis and was undetectable in leaves,
roots, flowers, and embryos. CYP5 may regulate the
function of the GNOM protein during embryogenesis
[63]. However, considering our results indicating that
the OsCYP19-4 gene was expressed in young rice
plants without pistils or in the embryogenesis stage
under salt stress, the full role of this protein remains
to be clarified. AtCYP20-1, the ortholog of OsCYP201, interacted with the regulatory subunit RCN1 of a
Ser/Thr-specific protein phosphatase, which suggests
that AtCYP20-1 and the RCN1 complex is required for
the control of root cell proliferation [64]. AtCYP20-1
was identified as an unfolded protein response (UPR)
gene following endoplasmic reticulum stress [65].
Unlike with AtCYP20-1, nothing about the function of
the putative mitochondria locating OsCYP20-1 has
been reported. Putative ER-locating OsCYP23 and thylakoid lumen-locating OsCYP28 are not conserved in
amino acids for CsA binding (Table 2), and given their
upregulated expressions only under salt stress, but not
under desiccation stress, we must infer that they are
associated with specific substrates for metabolic regulation related to sodium or chloride ions.
Tissue Expression Profiles of Stress inducible Rice
Immunophilins

The EST database and our reverse transcription PCR
analysis indicate that most putative OsIMMs genes are

Page 17 of 22

expressed in plants. The transcript levels of some of the
stress inducible OsIMMs have been investigated in different tissues (Figure 9). The analysis indicated many of
the genes (OsFKBP 20-1a, -20-1b, -58, -42a, and
OsCYP18-1, -21-4, -19-3, -17 and -20-1) are expressed
in all tissues, including 6-day seedlings, leaves, stems,
roots and flowers, in agreement with previous Arabidopsis orthologs results [4]. But some of the stress-inducible
OsIMMs (OsFKBP15-1, -16-1, -62a, and OsCYP19-4,
-28, -57, -59b) are not consistent with the Arabidopsis
orthologs results: OsFKBP15-1 is expressed only weakly
in leaf, compared to the AtFKBP15-1 which is expressed
strongly in all tissues. OsFKBP16-1 is expressed only in
leaves and stems, but the AtFKBP16-1, a chloroplast
lumen protein, is well expressed in most of tissues
except roots. OsFKBP62a is expressed in leaves, stems
and flowers, but not in seedlings and is extremely low in
roots, whereas AtFKBP62 is expressed in all tissues.
OsCYP19-4 is expressed at very low levels only in seedling and roots, whereas AtCYP19-4 was expressed in all
tissues. OsCYP28 is only expressed in leaves, whereas
AtCYP28, a thylakoid lumen protein, is well expressed
in all tissues except roots [4]. OsCYP57 is only
expressed in leaves and flowers at low levels, compared
to the high expression of AtCYP57 in all tissues. Finally,
OsCYP59b is a rare case of expression pattern in which
transcripts can be detected only in the stem at very low
levels, but AtCYP59 is at high levels in all tissues. These
results suggest that even if they are orthologs, each
orthologous IMM in other organisms are under a different spatial/temporal-regulation as a result of environmental or physiological adaptation.
Subcellular Localization of Os Immunophilins in Plant Cell

According to the prediction database, OsFKBP15-1 is
localized to ER; OsFKBP20-1a and -b are localized to
nucleus (Figure 2);OsCYP19-2 is cytosolic; and
OsCYP20-2 is located in the chloroplast lumen (Figure
5). To access the validity of subcellular localization for
predicted Os IMM proteins, OsFKBP15-1, -20-1a, -201b, OsCYP19-2 and -20-2 were fused with N-terminal
GFP protein and then expressed in N. benthamiana,
using Agrobacterium transiently (Figure 10). The control
of mGFP5 protein fluorescence was accumulated in
both cytosol and nucleus in tobacco cells. The GFP
fusion proteins of OsFKBP20-1a and -b, predicted to be
nuclear due to the C-terminal NLS sequences, were distinctly localized within the nucleus. However,
OsFKBP20-1a GFP protein showed a typical nuclear targeting pattern, but the OsFKBP20-1b GFP proteins were
strongly accumulated in a specific region within the
nucleus and also in cytosol foci. The co-localization of
OsFKBP20-1a and -b GFP proteins was confirmed by
DAPI staining of the nucleus (data not shown). As the

OsCYP19-2 sequence has not any a signal peptide for
subcellular localization (according to the database), the
GFP fusion protein was also located in the cytosol.
OsCYP20-2 GFP protein, which contains double arginine residues and hydrophobic regions as a putative
chloroplast lumenal protein, was clearly localized in
chloroplasts. As a putative ER-targeting protein,
OsFKBP15-1-GFP protein seemed to be localized in the
ER, but we were unable to use a specific marker protein
in this study. From these results, we suggest that
although not all the putative localization of Os IMMs
could be checked, in silico prediction programs for subcellular localization may useful for functional study of
Os IMMs.

Conclusions
Like the two green photosynthetic organisms, Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas, in which putative IMM genes
have been identified within the genome, rice has the largest number of putative IMM genes (29 FKBPs and 27
CYPs) among organisms that have been studied to date,
showing that the diversity of IMM in green photosynthetic organisms was already present in the ancient
green lineage, Chlamydomonas, and that this diversity is
maintained in most land plants. In addition, the large

number of IMM genes in the green lineage can be classified according to an ortholog relation. Specifically,
most of the genes survived without degeneration or
great modification during evolution, which suggests that
most orthologous IMM genes may have a conserved
function in cell metabolism. However, some rice IMM
genes are clearly different from those of Arabidopsis and
Chlamydomonas, and they may therefore have evolved
and developed a distinct role along a different evolutionary lineage. In particular, 11 OsFKBPs and 7 OsCYPs of
rice IMMs are putatively targeted to chloroplasts, as
with Arabidopsis, in which 11 AtFKBPs and 5 AtCYPs
are targeted to chloroplasts. Furthermore, most of the
chloroplast IMMs in both plants has a putative ortholog
relation, which indicates that they may have a conserved
function in relation to photosynthesis. Also by investigating the expression of all OsFKBPs and OsCYPs
under salt and desiccation stress conditions, we found
that a significant number of genes were up-regulated in
response to water stress. Furthermore, the tissue specific
expression of water stress responding Os IMMs and the
visual localization of some of these IMMs were examined. Ultimately, the classification of putative FKBPs and
CYPs in rice provides information about the evolutionary/functional significance of each FKBP and CYP based

the large numbers of IMM genes were upregulated by
water stress offers the possibility of manipulating genes
related to stress-related in rice research.

Methods
Sequence Analysis

Putative IMMs of Oryza sativa cv. Japonica were identified via BLAST searching of the Rice Genome Annotation Project database http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu

Ahn et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:253
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/253

using the amino acid sequence of AtFKBP12 for FKBPs
and AtCYP18-1 for CYPs as the query. The expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) for individual rice IMM were
counted by tBLASTn searches. The alignments of amino
acid sequence were performed using ClustalW and displayed with Genedoc v.2.6.002 [66,67]. The phylogenetic
tree was constructed by ClustalW using the above
aligned amino acid sequence. To search for functional
domains, SMART http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de, PROSITE http://us.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite, and a CaM
database search http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca were
used. The protein targeting signal and subcellular location of the IMMs were predicted using several programs, such as PSORT http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp,
TargetP http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/, SignalP http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/, ChloroP
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/, and PredictNLS http://www.predictprotein.org/ for cross-confirmation. The identification of orthologous Arabidopsis
thaliana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii PPIase for
individual rice IMMs were performed using BLASTP
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/.
Plant Growth and Treatment

Rice (Oryza sativa L. japonica genotype Dongjin) seeds
were germinated and grown in Yoshida nutrient solution, which consists of NH 4 NO 3 (1.43 mM), NaH 2PO 4 .2H 2 O (0.37 mM), K 2 SO 4 (0.5 mM), CaCl 2 (1.0
mM) and MgSO 4 .7H 2 O (1.6 mM) [68]. Plants were
grown in a controlled chamber with a photoperiod of 12
h light at 28°C and 12 h dark at 22°C. For the salt stress
treatment, two-week-old rice seedlings were subjected
to 200 mM NaCl and harvested at time courses of 0, 1,
3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment. For the
desiccation stress treatment, two-week-old rice seedlings
were transferred to dry pots and harvested at 0, 1, 6, 12,
24 and 48 hours after the treatment time points. Different tissues of the rice (6-day-old seedlings, leaves, stems,
roots and flowers) were collected and frozen in liquid
nitrogen for RNA extraction.
Total RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis

Total RNA was prepared from the two-week-old rice
seedlings treated with salt or drought stresses using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was purified
further using Qiagen RNeasy columns (Qiagen Inc., CA,
USA) and on-column DNase treatment. Two μg of RNA
were transcribed reversely in a 20 μl reaction volume
using oligo dT 14 to 18 primer (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and reverse transcriptase (SuperScript III, Invitrogen Life Technologies). Reactions were incubated at 65°C
for 5 min, 50°C for 50 min, and then 85°C for 5 min.

RT-PCR Analysis

The resulting cDNA was used as templates in 20 μL of
PCR reaction using specific primers. The gene-specific
primers used for OsFKBPs and OsCYPs are described in
Additional file 2 and 3: Supplemental Table S2 and S3.
A total of 10 μL of PCR samples was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium
bromide staining. The expression of an actin gene was
used as an internal control for determining the RT-PCR
amplification efficiency among different reactions. The
RT-PCR reactions were repeated three times and representative results from one experiment were shown.
Subcellular localization

The OsIMMs FKBP15-1, FKBP20-1a and FKBP20-1b,
CYP19-2, and CYP20-2 cDNA fragments corresponding
to the 154, 186, 185, 171, 247, and amino acids were
cloned into the pCAMBIA1302 plasmids using BglII and
SpeI sites to generate the OsIMMs-GFP fusion proteins
respectively. The various GFP constructs were introduced
into N. benthamiana epidermal leaves by Agrobacterium
infiltration [69]. Expression of the fusion proteins were
monitored at 48 h after Agrobacterium injection by an
Axiophot fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The
filter set were used (excitation 450-490 nm, emission
500-550 nm) and Texas Red (excitation 530-585 nm,
emission 650 nm longpass) for green fluorescent proteins
and autofluorescence of chlorophyll, respectively.
