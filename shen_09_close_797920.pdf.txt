Abstract
Background: There are many advantages to the application of complete mitochondrial (mt)
genomes in the accurate reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships in Metazoa. Although over
one thousand metazoan genomes have been sequenced, the taxonomic sampling is highly biased,
left with many phyla without a single representative of complete mitochondrial genome. Sipuncula
(peanut worms or star worms) is a small taxon of worm-like marine organisms with an uncertain
phylogenetic position. In this report, we present the mitochondrial genome sequence of
Phascolosoma esculenta, the first complete mitochondrial genome of the phylum.
Results: The mitochondrial genome of P.esculenta is 15,494 bp in length. The coding strand
consists of 32.1% A, 21.5% C, 13.0% G, and 33.4% T bases (AT = 65.5%; AT skew = -0.019; GC
skew = -0.248). It contains thirteen protein-coding genes (PCGs) with 3,709 codons in total,
twenty-two transfer RNA genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and a non-coding AT-rich region (AT
= 74.2%). All of the 37 identified genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand. Compared with
the typical set of metazoan mt genomes, sipunculid lacks trnR but has an additional trnM. Maximum
Likelihood and Bayesian analyses of the protein sequences show that Myzostomida, Sipuncula and
Annelida (including echiurans and pogonophorans) form a monophyletic group, which supports a
closer relationship between Sipuncula and Annelida than with Mollusca, Brachiopoda, and some
other lophotrochozoan groups.
Conclusion: This is the first report of a complete mitochondrial genome as a representative
within the phylum Sipuncula. It shares many more similar features with the four known annelid and
one echiuran mtDNAs. Firstly, sipunculans and annelids share quite similar gene order in the
mitochondrial genome, with all 37 genes located on the same strand; secondly, phylogenetic
analyses based on the concatenated protein sequences also strongly support the sipunculan +
annelid clade (including echiurans and pogonophorans). Hence annelid "key-characters" including
segmentation may be more labile than previously assumed.

Background
Sipunculans (peanut worms or star worms) form a minor
phylum of nonsegmented coelomate worms with bilaterally symmetrical bodies that are divisible into a trunk and
a retractable introvert. In spite of low species diversity
(about 150 species), sipunculans are found from tropical
to Antarctic oceans [1,2]. The fossil records for sipunculans are generally rare but three species from the Lower
Cambrian Maotianshan Shale were reported by Huang et
al. (2004), suggesting that the most typical features of
extant sipunculans have undergone only minor changes
over the past 520 million years [3]. Although the group
was first documented in 1555, their phylogenetic relations are controversial [1,4,5]. In 1767 Linnaeus described
Sipunculus nudus, placing it within the Vermes Intestina, a
group containing truly "internal worms" and other bilateral invertebrates lacking lateral appendages [6]. These
were later considered to be a derived group of annelids
[7]. Quatrefages (1847) proposed the name Gephyrea or
"bridge group" for sipunculans, echiurans and priapulids,
assuming that they represented a connection between
annelids and echinoderms [8]. Hyman (1959) suggested
the disposal of Gephyre on the grounds that it was simply
an easy way of grouping organisms of uncertain phylogenetic affinities. Furthermore, she suggested the elevation
of sipunculans to phylum status (under the name Sipunculida) [5]. Later on, Stephen (1965) proposed the name
Sipuncula for the phylum [9], a term which has been
widely adopted.
Scheltema (1993) maintained the presence of a molluscan-cross during cleavage as an indication to place Sipuncula as the sister taxon to the Mollusca [10]. However, cell
lineage studies have shown that the concept of the molluscan-cross vs. the annelidan-cross is oversimplified and
of limited phylogenetic significance [11]. Due to superficial body plan similarity, sipunculans and echiurans are
often grouped together [12]. But prominent differences
including anal position and proboscis form suggest that
the similar body plans are a result of convergence due to
parallel burrowing lifestyles, rather than common ancestry. Recently, the Echiura has been considered a derived
polychaete group that may have lost segmentation
[13,14], leading to a more confused placement of sipunculans.
Previous cladistic analyses based on morphological and
limited molecular data have rendered a great variety of
hypotheses relating Sipuncula, including sister group to
Echiura [15], sister group to Annelida [16], sister group to
Mollusca [10], sister group to Echiura + Annelida [17], sister group to Mollusca + Annelida [18], and sister group to
an unresolved clade containing Mollusca, Annelida and
the Panarthropoda [19], or within Annelida [4]. In sum-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/136

mary, little agreement is reached with regards to the exact
position of Sipuncula within the protostomes.
With a few remarkable exceptions, animal mitochondrial
DNAs (mtDNAs) are circular molecules, 14–20 kb in size,
containing 37 genes: 13 for proteins of electron transport
(cox1-3, cob, nad1-6, nad4L, atp6 and atp8), 2 for ribosomal
RNAs (srRNA and lrRNA), and 22 for transfer RNAs. Over
the past decades, inference of a deeper phylogenetic relationship of Metazoa with complete mitochondrial
genome sequences has gained popularity [20-22]. This
resulted from many advantages offered over other molecular markers for phylogenetic analysis, such as (a) ease of
isolation and assaying; (b) simple genetic structure lacking complicated features such as repetitive DNA, transposable elements, pseudogenes, and introns; and (c)
effectively single copy, comparison of paralogous genes is
generally not a concern [21]. In addition, mitochondrial
genome provides a systematic view and measurement of
evolutionary history of an organism which is synchronized with the nuclear genome of the host [23]. More
importantly, compared to individual genes, mitochondrial genomes can provide sets of genome-level characteristics, such as the relative rearrangements of gene orders,
which can be powerful for phylogenetic analysis [24,25].
More than one thousand complete mitochondrial
genome
sequences
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
genomes/ORGANELLES/mztax_short.html have been
reported to date. The taxonomic sampling, however, is
highly biased toward vertebrates and arthropods (both
groups account for ~86% of sequenced mt genomes),
with no complete mt genome in many minor phyla.
Minor phyla are generally considered to be of little consequence usually with uncertain affinity in mainstream animal evolution theories because they are not well
represented in present macrofauna. However, if we use
the questionable definition of a phylum as a taxon with a
distinctly unique body plan and leave aside the requirement of monophyly, then minor phyla represent the
majority of nature's experimentation with animal body
plans [26].
In this paper, we described the gene content, organization
and codon usage of the first complete mitochondrial
genome in the phylum Sipuncula, Phascolosoma esculenta.
We analyzed the phylogentic relationship of Sipuncula
with mitochondrial genomes from Annelida, Echiura,
Pogonophora, Myzostomida, Mollusca and some other
protostomes. The result provides further evidence on phylogenomic scale to a close relationship of Myzostomida,
Sipuncula and Annelida (including echiurans and
pogonophorans).

Results and Discussion
General features
The mitochondrial genome of P. esculenta is 15,494 bp in
length, and encodes a set of 37 metazoan genes (thirteen
protein-coding, two ribosomal RNA, and twenty-two
transfer RNA genes) (Figure 1; Table 1). The overall A+T
content of P.esculenta (65.5%) is higher than that of the
mitochondrial genomes from the Annelida/Echiura group
except for one polychaete Clymenella torquata (67.2%) [see
additional file 1]. The entire P.esculenta mtDNA sequence
has been deposited in GenBank with accession number
EF583817.
Gene order
All the mitochondrial genes of P.esculenta are transcribed
from the same strand (Figure 1), as is the case for the four
studied annelids (Orbinia latreillii [27], C.torquata [28],
Platynereis dumerilii [29], and Lumbricus terrestris [20]),
one echiuran Urechis caupo [30], and many other lophotrochozoan mtDNAs [31]. There may be an evolutionary
"ratchet" in cases where all genes coincidentally occur on
the same strand that is caused by the loss of the transcriptional signals for the opposite strand, which then makes
further inversions lethal [31]. The gene synteny in P. esculenta shares moderate similarity with other four annelid
mtDNAs (Figure 2).

RNA genes are encoded on the same strand. Transfer RNA
genes are designated by single-letter amino acid codes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/136

The gene order in annelids is quite conserved with the
exception of just a few tRNA genes. Comparing all the
known annelid mitochondrial genomes, six conserved
gene clusters can be found: (1) cox1-N-cox2; (2)cox3-Qnad6-cob-W-atp6-R; (3) H-nad5-F-E-P-T-nad4L-nad4; (4)
srRNA-V-lrRNA; (5) nad1-I; and (6) nad3-S1-nad2 (Figure
2). U.caupo (Echiura) contains four of them compared
with annelids, including (1)Q-nad6-cob-W-atp6-R; (2)Hnad5-F; (3)T-nad4L-nad4; and (4) nad1-I. In comparison
with the four annelids, three conserved gene clusters are
present in P.esculenta, including (1)nad6-cob; (2)T-nad4Lnad4; and (3)W-atp6 (Figure 2). As to the partial mitochondrial genome of a sipunculid Phascolopsis gouldii [32],
it also possesses three conserved regions (cox1-N-cox2,
cox3-Q-nad6-cob, and srRNA-V-lrRNA), and it is surprising
that the first and third gene blocks located in the P.gouldii
cannot be found in the mitochondrial genomes of U.
caupo or P.esculenta (Figure 2). Meanwhile, gene order in
the mitochondrial genomes of Riftia pachyptila (Pogonophora) and Myzostoma seymourcollegiorum (Myzostomida)
also showed remarkable similarities with studied annelids
[28,33].
A conserved pattern of gene order across sipunculans,
echiurids, pogonophorans, myzostomids, and annelids
was surprising, since high variations in gene order is
known to occur within closely related taxa like brachiopods [34-36] and molluscs [37-39]. Jennings and Halanych (2005) suggested that gene order data are of limited
utility in Annelida [28]. On the contrary, Bleidorn et al.
(2006) believed that such data may be a promising tool to
search for synapomorphic gene rearrangements and shed
light on annelid related phylogeny [27]. At this moment,
it is still too early to say whether the gene order is a crucial
tool or not, when complete mitochondrial genomes are
still underrepresented for annelid related groups. However, from known data it can be concluded that gene rearrangements in this group may be less frequent than in
other lophotrochozoan taxa, although more frequent
than previously thought.
Protein-coding genes
Mitochondrial genes commonly use several alternatives to
ATG as start codons. Ten of the thirteen PCGs (atp6, atp8,
cob, cox2, nad1-3, nad4L and nad5-6) of P.esculenta initiate
with the ATG start codon, while cox3 and nad4 genes start
with ATA and the cox1 gene with the TTG codon (Table 1).
Nine open-reading frames end with the TAA stop codon
(atp6, atp8, cox1-3, nad1, nad4L, nad5 and nad6), and the
remaining ones (cob, nad2, nad3 and nad4) have incomplete stop codons. Such immature stop codons are common among animal mitochondrial genomes, and it has
been shown that TAA stop codons are created via posttranscriptional polyadenylation [40].

NOTE. * Numbers correspond to the nucleotides separating different genes.
Negative numbers indicate overlapping nucleotides between adjacent genes.
"-" indicates termination codons completed via polyadenylation.

Among the thirteen PCGs, there is one reading-frame
overlap between nad4L and nad4 genes (Table 1) [also see
additional file 2]. We speculate that nad4L may have an
abbreviated stop codon, but is inferred to overlap with
nad4 by four nucleotides to the first legitimate stop codon,
since overlap of this pair has been commonly observed in
other mtDNAs [27,30,41]. It is not clear how gene overlaps could be resolved from a polycistronic transcript, but
the presence of these stop codons seems beyond coincidence. It could be that they serve as a "back up" in case
translation and should begin in the absence of transcript
cleavage [30].

Base composition and codon usage
The coding strand in P.esculenta consists of 32.1% A,
21.5% C, 13.0% G, and 33.4% T bases [see additional file
3]. The bias of the base composition of an individual
strand can be described by skewness [42], which measures
the relative numbers of As to Ts and Gs to Cs and is calculated as (A%-T%)/(A%+T%) and (G%-C%)/(C%+G%),
respectively. The PCGs have a strong skew of C vs. G (0.191~-0.456), except that the cox3 gene has a weaker
skew of C vs. G (-0.083); whereas the AT skew is only
slightly negative for most PCGs (-0.003~-0.243) except
for the cox2 and atp8 genes (AT skew = 0.146 and 0.069 in

cox2 and atp8 genes, respectively). Base composition and
skewness of PCGs are similar to the whole genome (AT =
65.5%; AT skew = -0.019; GC skew = -0.248) [see additional file 3]. As can be seen in the additional file 4, this is
strongly reflected in the use of synonymous codons. As for
two rRNA genes, GC skew is weaker than that of the whole
genome (GC skew = -0.074 and -0.190 for the srRNA and
lrRNA genes, respectively), which perhaps because of the
requirement for base pairing in the secondary structures of
the products [43]. On the contrary, the AT skew displayed
an opposite pattern to the whole genome and has a
slightly skew of A vs. T (AT skew = 0.068 and 0.053 for
srRNA and lrRNA genes, respectively), which is consistent
to four studied annelids except for U.caupo (AT skew =
0.015 for the whole genome of U.caupo) [see additional
file 3].
The A+C and G+T frequency in protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes of P.esculenta, U.caupo and the four studied annelids was calculated [see additional file 3], and the
whole genome scanning of P.esculenta and U.caupo is

shown in additional file 2. That the emergence of A+C is
more frequent than G+T has shown in all the six mitochondrial genomes as a whole, and all thirteen PCGs and
two rRNAs of U.caupo and O.latreillii displayed a similar
pattern to the whole genome, which results in the highest
A+C frequency of the two species. On the contrary, the
remaining four species have at least one gene that G+T is
more frequent than A+C [see additional file 3].
The pattern of codon usage in the P.esculenta mtDNA was
also studied [see additional file 4]. There are a total of
3,709 codons in all thirteen mitochondrial PCGs, excluding incomplete termination codons. The most frequently
used amino acids were Leu (17.69%), followed by Ser
(9.65%), Phe (8.95%), Ile (7.74%), and Ala (7.09%). A
common feature in most metazoan genomes is a bias
towards a higher representation of nucleotides A and T
which leads to a subsequent bias in the corresponding
encoded amino acids. This result comes from the fact that
the third codon positions of the PCGs in P.esculenta prefer
T more than those in annelid and echiuran species. The

Page 5 of 11

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:136

overall AT composition of protein-coding regions is
64.9%, but at the third codon positions the AT composition elevates to 78.2%, which is higher than the average
level among the mitochondrial genomes from the Annelida/Echiura group [see additional file 1].
Transfer and Ribosomal RNA genes
The P.esculenta mtDNA encodes 22 tRNA genes, each folding into a clover-leaf secondary structure (Figure 3) and
ranging in size from 61 (trnC, trnM2 and trnH) to 72 (trnY)
nucleotides. There are five cases in total where tRNA genes
appear to overlap by one to six nucleotides (Table 1).
Compared with a standard set of metazoan mt genomes,
the sipunculid mitochondrial genome lacks trnR and has
an extra trnM. The absence of tRNA gene(s) was found in
some metazoan mitochondrial genomes [44,45]. Twenty
two tRNA genes were identified on the basis of their
respective anticodons and secondary structures. Gene
sizes and anticodon nucleotides were congruent to those
described for other metazoan species.

DOGMA [46] and BLAST analyses indicate that the srRNA
and lrRNA genes are adjacent to the trnM2 and trnI genes,
and both of them are located on the coding strand. The
rRNA gene boundaries were estimated from nucleotide
sequence alignments with annelids species. The lengths of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/136

srRNA and lrRNA genes are 838 and 1,419 bp, and the
A+T contents are 63.7% and 65.8%, respectively, which
are higher than those of the mitochondrial genomes from
the Annelida/Echiura group except for the C.torquata
(65.4% and 70.5% for srRNA and lrRNA genes, respectively) [see additional file 1].
Unassigned Sequence
In the mitochondrial genome of the P.esculenta, a total of
846 bp of non-coding nucleotides are scattered among
eighteen intergenic regions, including a single region of
585 bp. The largest non-coding region between the trnL2
and nad1 is suggestive of a putative control region based
on its high A+T content (AT = 74.2%) (Figure 1) [see additional file 1]. Except for the largest non-coding region,
there are also three large intergenic regions adjacent to
trnQ and cox3, atp6 and trnH, and trnD and cox2 (106, 63
and 40 bp in length, respectively), and others have 1 to 13
bp in length (Table 1). Tandem repeats of CAAA and TA
are common in four larger intergenic regions with 16
(CAAA)s and 106 (TA)s, and an especially noteworthy
(TA)10 was found in the largest region between the trnL2
and nad1.
Phylogenomic relationship
Phylogenies based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) and
Bayesian analyses of the concatenated protein sequences
were in almost complete agreement (Figure 4). In both
cases, Sipuncula and Annelida (including echiurans and
pogonophorans) form a monophyletic group (BPP = 100,
BPM = 98), which strongly supports a closer relationship
between Sipuncula and Annelida than with Mollusca, Brachiopoda, and some other lophotrochozoan groups.
Gene arrangement comparisons are a powerful tool for
phylogenetic studies, especially for the estimation of
ancient relationships [25]. A survey of mitochondrial gene
order revealed a great conservation of gene arrangements
across sipunculans, annelids and echiurids [see additional
file 5]. Both gene arrangement data and inferred amino
acid sequences reveal that the sipunculan should be consistently and significantly clustered with annelids to the
exclusion of molluscs and other taxa. Our findings are in
general agreement with several published molecular studies, which grouped sipunculans with annelids closely
[4,18,32,47-49]. Comparative morphological and embryological evidence provide an additional support for such
relationship between Sipuncula and Annelida. Investigation of larval ocelli in pelagosphera larvae gave evidence
for an annelid affinity rather than to molluscs [50]. This
evidence is consistent with a morphological study of neural and muscle formation in the sipunculan Phascolion
strombus [51]. A recent research on the neural patterning
of Phascolosoma agassizii revealed sipunculan neurogenesis
initially follows a segmental pattern similar to that of
annelids, which suggests the segmental ancestry of Sipun-

cula [49]. If sipunculans did evolve from segmented
worms, then their body plan must have changed extensively at or before the start of the Cambrian, followed by
a remarkable period of stasis for the past half billion years
[3]. The absence of segmentation in Sipuncula would then
be a secondary loss [49], probably associated with the
exploitation of a sedentary, burrowing lifestyle [52].
The hypothesis that echiurans are derived annelids was
supported by our analyses (Figure 4), which is in consen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/136

sus with several previous studies [13,14,53,54]. The metameric organisations of the nervous system found in U.
caupo and Bonellia viridis are thus interpreted as an indication that echiurans are derived from a segmented ancestor
[14], and the lack of segmentation in adult echiurans is
therefore regarded as secondary [55]. However, the lack of
segmentation in Echiura has been the single most important reason for excluding the group from the Annelida.
Considering the support provided by these results for the
theory that the lack of segmentation in adult echiurans is

by "-". The first numbers are from Bayesian inferences (BPP) and the second numbers are from maximum likelihood analyses
(BPM). The root of all trees was determined by using the data from Porifera, Cnidaria, and Placozoa species as the outgroup.

the result of reduction, it can be concluded that Echiura
share the same fundamental characters that are currently
regarded to constitute the bauplan of Annelida. The segmental organisation of the nervous system in combination with the numerous additional characters shared by
echiurans and annelids, therefore, support a phylogenetic
classification of Echiura as a subtaxon of Annelida [55].
The phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial
genomes also confirmed the fact that pogonophorans are
derived annelids (Figure 4). Pogonophorans nested
within the annelids was proved by both molecular and
morphological cladistic analyses [13,28,29,56]. Given the
name Pogonophora is misleading at this level, McHugh
proposed the name of the group reverted to that of the
first family group name originally formulated for members of the group, that of Siboglinidae Caullery, 1914
[13].
The annelid affinity of myzostomids has been challenged
in recent times [48]. However, Bleidorn et al. (2007)
assumed that myzostomids are part of the annelid radiation based on data from nuclear genes and mitochondrial
genomes [33]. Here, the phylogenetic analyses based on
mitochondrial genomes confirmed a close relationship
between myzostomids and sipunculans+annelids clade
(including echiurans and pogonophorans) (Figure 4),
which is in agreement with the morphological evidence
that myzostomids are part of the annelid radiation
[56,57].
Fundamentally different animal body plans, or phyla,
constitute groups that are assumed to maintain their phylogenetic integrity as far back as they can be traced [13].
The great expansion of molecular data sets and improvements in phylogenetic methods have drastically changed
our understanding of body plan evolution. Traditional
key characteristics such as segmentation, radial versus spiral cell cleavage patterns in early embryogenesis, and
modes of coelom formation appear to be more plastic and
less reliable as phylogenetic characters than previously
thought. Segmentation has traditionally been used as the
basis for uniting annelids and arthropods as sister taxa
[53], and the alternative hypothesis supports a sister relationship between molluscs and annelids, with the exclusion of arthropods, on the basis of the trochophore larva
(the Ecdysozoa/Lophotrochozoa hypothesis) [58]. The
placement of unsegmented Echiura and Sipuncula within
Annelida radiation implies that segmentation is secondarily lost multiple times. If unsegmented echiurans are
modified annelids and do not represent the unique body
plan, then segmentation is an evolutionarily labile body
plan character that has been lost rather than never gained
by them [13].

Conclusion
This is the first report of a complete mitochondrial
genome of a representative within the phylum Sipuncula.
Many features aresimilar to four studied annelids and one
echiuran mtDNAs. As in case of these five and many other
lophotrochozoan mtDNAs, all 37 genes are transcribed
from the same DNA strand. Three conserved gene blocks
compared with the four studied annelids can be identified
in the P.esculenta, including (1) nad6-cob; (2) T-nad4Lnad4; and (3) W-atp6. Phylogenetic analyses based on
inferred amino acids shown that Myzostomida, Sipuncula
and Annelida (including echiurans and pogonophorans)
form a monophyletic group, which supports a closer relationship between Sipuncula and Annelida than with Mollusca, Brachiopoda and some other lophotrochozoan
groups. Thus, many characteristics that have been hypothesized to link sipunculans with molluscs, including their
developmental pattern and lack of segmentation, should
be reevaluated.

Methods
Sample collection and DNA extraction
Live specimen of the P.esculenta was obtained from the
Wenling breeding farm (Zhejiang province, China). The
muscle tissues were excised and immediately preserved at
-80°C. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the tissues
using a DNeasy tissue DNA extraction kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions, and was dissolved
in TE buffer.
PCR and sequencing
Two partial sequences for the cox1 and cox3 genes of the
P.esculenta were determined by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using the following primer pairs: LCO1490 +
HCO2198 for the fragment of cox1 gene and COIIIF +
COIIIB for the fragment of cox3 gene [21].

PCR reactions were conducted in a Mastercycler gradient
machine (Eppendorf AG Inc.) in a total volume of 25 μl,
containing 18.0 μl sterile distilled H2O, 2.5 μl 10 × LA
PCR buffer (Mg2+ plus, Takara), 0.5 μl dNTP (10 mM each,
0.2 mM final concentration), 1 μl each primer (5 μM), 1
μl LA-Taq polymerase (1 unit, Takara), and 1 μl DNA template. The thermal cycling profile was as follows: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 2 minutes and followed by
denaturation at 94°C for 20 s, annealing at 52°C for 45 s,
and extension at 72°C for 1 min, for 34 cycles. PCR products were purified using the Montage PCR Cleanup Kit
(Millipore) and sequenced with ABI 3730x1 DNA Analyzer.
Long PCR and sequencing by cloning and primer walking
The mitochondrial genome of P.esculenta was amplified
with a long PCR protocol. Based on the partial mitochondrial genome sequences (cox1 and cox3), two pairs of

primers: cox1-cox3-F (5'-AGG CTG AAC AGT CTA CCC
CC-3'), cox1-cox3-R (5'-TAA TCC TAC ACA TCA CTT TGG
CTT TG-3'), cox3-cox1-F (5'-AAG CCA CTC AAC ATA CCC
AAA CCT AAC C-3'), cox3-cox1-R (5'-ATT GTG CTT TTC
CTC ATC GTT CGT GTA G-3'), were designed to the
amplification of the entire mitochondrial genome in two
long PCR reactions.
PCR reactions were also done in a Mastercycler gradient
machine (Eppendorf AG Inc.) and the reactions were carried out with 36 cycles of 25 μl reaction volume containing 18.5 μl sterile distilled H2O, 2.5 μl 10 × LA PCR buffer
(Mg2+ plus, Takara), 0.5 μl dNTP (10 mM each, 0.2 mM
final concentration), 1 μl each primer (5 μM), 1 μl LA-Taq
polymerase (1 units, Takara), and 0.5 ml DNA template.
The thermal cycling profile was as follows: with an initial
denaturation at 94°C for 2 minutes and followed by
denaturation at 94°C for 20 s, annealing at 58°C for 45 s,
and extension at 72°C for 10 minutes, for 36 cycles.
Approximately 3 μg of PCR product was sheared randomly into fragments of about 1.5 kb by forcing it repeatedly through a narrow aperture using a Hydroshear device
(Gene Machines, San Carlos, CA). Following enzymatic
end repair and gel purification, these fragments were
ligated into pUC18 and transformed into E.coli to create
plasmid libraries using standard techniques. DNA
sequence data from both strands was generated from single clones using the primer walking approach, which also
conducted with ABI 3730x1 DNA Analyzer.
Sequence analysis
Base calling was performed with phred [59,60] and
sequence reads were assembled in phrap with default
parameters. All assembled sequences were manually
checked by CONSED to remove misassemblies [61]. The
locations of the 13 PCGs and two rRNAs were determined
with DOGMA [46], and subsequent alignments with C.
torquata, L. terrestris and O. latreillii (Annelida). The
majority of tRNA genes were identified by using tRNAscan-SE 1.21 [62], employing the default search mode and
the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code for tRNA
structure prediction. Remaining tRNA genes were identified by inspecting sequences for tRNA-like secondary
structures and anticodons.
Phylogenomic analysis
Besides the mitochondrial genome of P.esculenta, partial
or complete mitochondrial genomes from Annelida,
Echiura, Pogonophora, Myzostomida, Brachiopoda, Ectoprocta, Bryozoa, and Rotifera were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Six genomes from four classes of
Mollusca and four genomes from four Arthropoda major
clades were also included. The root of all trees was deter-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/136

mined by using the data from Porifera, Cnidaria, and Placozoa species as the outgroup [see additional file 6].
Partial mitochondrial genome sequences of R.pachyptila
(Pogonophora) and M.seymourcollegiorum (Myzostomida)
contain 11 PCGs (cox1, cox2, cox3, cob, nad1, nad2, nad3,
nad4, nad6, atp6 and atp8) and 10 PCGs (cox1, cox2, cox3,
cob, nad4, nad4L, nad5, nad6, atp6 and atp8), respectively.
In addition, atp8 gene is missing in some mitochondrial
genomes. Thus the amino acid sequences from seven
shared PCGs (cox1, cox2, cox3, cob, nad4, nad6 and atp6)
were aligned using Clustal X with the default settings [63].
The final alignment for the 29 taxa consisted of 2,718
sites. Two phylogenetic reconstruction approaches was
applied including Maximum Likelihood (ML) using
PhyML 3.0 [64] and Bayesian inference analyses using
MrBayes 3.1 MPI version [65].
Model selection for the amino acid dataset was done with
ProtTest [66]. For a likelihood analysis, we implemented
the MtArt matrix in PhyML 3.0 [64]. As the MtArt model
is a very recent addition to the models commonly used
[67], we could not implement it in Bayesian analysis,
where we used the best scoring alternative, MtRev matrix
and the gamma+invar model of evolutionary change. In
the ML method, the assessment of node reliability was
done using 1,000 bootstrap replicates (BPM). In the case
of the Bayesian analyses, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
analyses were run for 1,000,000 generations (sampling
every 100 generations) to allow adequate time for convergence. After approximate 100,000 generations, the loglikelihood values of each sampled tree had stabilized.
After omitting the first 1,000 "burn in" trees, the remaining 9,000 sampled trees were used to estimate the 50%
majority rule consensus tree and the Bayesian posterior
probabilities (BPP).
