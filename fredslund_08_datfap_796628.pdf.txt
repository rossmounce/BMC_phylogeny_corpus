Abstract
Background: Many well-known transcription factor databases do not provide PCR primers for
the sequences. Often, transcription factors from the same family have a very high sequence
similarity, and so specific primer sets that only amplify their targets and none of the other family
members may be hard to design manually. Also, it may often be useful to have one general primer
set targeting the slightly different homologs of some transcription factor from several species.
Results: DATFAP is a free, web-based, very user-friendly browsing tool based on a new database
of more than 55,000 EST sequences from 13 plant species, classified as transcription factors.
Further, the database offers primers designed for RealTime-PCR as well as homology alignments
and phylogenies for the sequences. The provided PCR primers are designed so that they have a
perfect sequence alignment to their target only and not to any other sequences in the database
from the same species. Via a direct link to a helper tool, the user may also design a general primer
set targeting all sequences in any hand-picked group of homologs. A sophisticated search facility
enables the user to find exactly the relevant sequences which subsequently may be easily
downloaded. All homologies among the more than one billion possible pairwise sequence
comparisons of DATFAP have been charted in advance. Thus, the user may quickly display the
alignment of any sequence and all its database homologs.
Conclusion: Because of the comprehensive homology analysis, it is very easy to find related
transcription factors from different species, i.e. to navigate the network of inter-related
transcription factors from the different species, and to find specific or general primers for them.
DATFAP is found at the project homepage.

Background
Transcription factors are proteins acting to regulate
expression of genes by binding to their regulatory regions.
Activated in signal transduction pathways, they are essential in the production of the right cellular response to
some stimulus. Hence, specific transcription factors are
the topic of study in hundreds of research projects, including projects dealing with plant breeding. Such studies can
be very different in nature, ranging from the precise, func-

tional characterization of certain proteins [1] over identification and classification of families of related proteins
[2] to genetic modification [3].
When examining cDNA samples for the presence or
expression levels of transcripts, one very often uses the
Polymerase Chain Reaction, PCR. As many transcription
factor families exist with minor variations among members, detecting one particular member requires uniquely

specific PCR primers capable of binding to the target only,
and avoiding the (often highly similar) relatives. Under
other circumstances it might be relevant to have one general set of primers targeting a certain transcription factor
such that the same primer set would amplify the correct
target in several different species; a sort of orthogonal
primer design problem.
In the search of new or unannotated transcription factors,
sequence similarity to known transcription factors is a
strong indicator. A large number of families have been
identified, among plants in particular in rice and the
model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and homologs in other
species to proteins from these families have been found.
This paper presents DATFAP (Database of Transcription
Factors with Alignments and Primers), a resource where
transcription factors from 12 plants and the green algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are collected and made available together with specific primers, homology alignments
and sequence phylogenies.

Construction and Content
The EST sequences in DATFAP originate primarily from
the Institute of Genomic Research (consensus sequences
of EST alignments [4]), but also from the National Center
for Biotechnology Information [5], the Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors [6], PlnTFDB [7], and PlantTFDB [8]. A sequence is classified as a transcription factor
in DATFAP if one or more of the following conditions are
met:

Utility and Discussion
Following the above-mentioned criteria, 55,361 out of
more than 750,000 downloaded sequences were classified
as transcription factors and curated in DATFAP. The access
point for DATFAP is the front page where the user gives
directives to the search engine via input to four text boxes.
First of all, in the leftmost selection box, one or more species must be chosen among
• Medicago truncatula
• Zea mays (maize)
• Oryza sativa (rice)

• [keyword] The phrase "transcription factor" or one of
the known transcription factor family names defined for
rice or Arabidopsis is found in its header.

• Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato)

• [external database] It is listed in one of the above-mentioned external databases of transcription factors.

• Solanum tuberosum (potato)

• Chlamydomonas reinhardtii

• Populus trichocarpa (poplar)
• [gene ontology] It has a Gene Ontology [9] annotation
containing the phrase "transcription factor" or one of the
known transcription factor family names defined for rice
or Arabidopsis.

• Glycine max (soybean)
• Hordeum vulgare (barley)

• [homology] It is very similar to a DATFAP sequence
from another species classified by the above criteria as a
transcription factor. Similarity is determined using a standalone version of the program BLAST [10] with e-value 107.

• Lotus japonicus

Besides its header, each sequence is associated with a classification record which states the reason(s) for its classification as a transcription factor in DATFAP.

• Triticum aestivum (wheat)

• Arabidopsis thaliana
• Gossypium hirsutum (cotton)

In the text box entitled "Search keywords", the user may
type any keyword(s) of particular interest, e.g. homeobox. It
is also possible simply to type an ID such as aw694210.

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:140

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/140

Only sequences whose headers or classification records
contain at least one of the search keywords will be
selected. The search is case-insensitive.

• AND, NOT and OR have their obvious meanings. E.g.,
not trans* matches anything not containing a word beginning with "trans".

Complex search queries can be composed using OR,
AND, NOT, *, single quotes and parentheses; e.g.:

Another example of a search phrase might be
*trans* and not transcription

'zinc finger' and ('purine-binding' or CCCH) and not (partial
or putative)
Some further details about the search facility:
• Parentheses are used to build sub-expressions
• Single quotes are used around search words or phrases
containing spaces
• The wildcard character * is used to search for parts of
words. E.g., trans* matches any word beginning with the
substring "trans"; *nin* matches any string containing the
substring "nin".

This matches sequences containing the substring "trans"
but not the word "transcription". The and is important
here; if left out, the phrase is interpreted as *trans* ornot
transcription – and that matches all sequences! The Help
pages show several more examples of search phrases
(available from the front page).
In the Classification criteria selection box, the search
may be restricted such that only transcription factors classified by certain criteria are searched.
The sequences found in the search are presented in a scrollable table with four columns: Sequence header, Classification record, DATFAP homologs and Primers. Each

species is represented by its own color, shown in a bar just
below the table (Figure 1).
The classification record of a sequence states its reason for
being in DATFAP; in other words, it states by which criteria this sequence has been classified as a transcription factor (see Materials and Methods).
In case primers are provided for a sequence, the Primers
table column contains a link to a page giving details about
them, including GC content, melting temperature, length
and sequence of each primer, as well as the expected
amplicon length and a score for the primer set (since

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/140

primers are designed for ESTs and not full gene sequences,
they may cross intron/exon boundaries. However, in practice this is probably not the reason why a primer pair
might fail to yield a specific product, as observed in [13]).
The score of a primer set depends on whether the individual primers have 1- or 2-mismatch alignments to any nontarget sequences. Such "close match" alignments may be
considered problematic since they represent potential
mis-primings. A score of 3000 indicates that the primer
pair has no 1- or 2-mismatch alignments to non-target
sequences. Further details on the score can be found in
[14].

Up to three sets are suggested to allow the user an
informed choice; any may be selected for download (Figure 2). The user can get a visual display of the locations
inside the sequence of the selected primers by clicking a
link.
All DATFAP primers are automatically designed using a
standalone version of the tool primique [14] which
designs primers for groups of sequences such that each
primer pair uniquely and specifically amplifies its target
sequence and no other sequence from the group. Thus, no
primer pair in DATFAP has a perfect match among nontarget DATFAP sequences from the target species.
The primer design has been carried out over three rounds
for each species with different parameter settings optimized to deliver primers suited for Real-Time PCR (RTPCR). The important ones of the first round are shown in
Table 1.
With these restrictive settings, the primers found will be
good for high-throughput (multi-parallel) RT-PCR. In
round two, the parameter settings are the same except a
few which are relaxed according to Table 2.
With this higher range of primer melting temperature,
high-throughput RT-PCR is no longer the goal, but the
primers will still be suited for single-transcript RT-PCR. If
primers are not found for all sequences, the criteria are
further relaxed in the final round three as summarized in
Table 3.
Thus, first all primers found in round 1 are stored. Then
for round 2, primique is run with relaxed criteria on the
sequences for which no valid primer sets were found in
round 1. And finally, sequences still without primers are
run through round 3. Some sequences are still without
primers after round 3, most often because no primers can
be found that align perfectly only to their target, or
because the allowed product length is quite limited. The
fraction of sequences for which primers could be found
ranges from for 72.5% for Arabidopsis to 94.5% for poplar.
From the main results page (Figure 1), the user also has
the opportunity to Create new primers for all sequences

using primique. Clicking this link uploads all the result
sequences to primique and lets the user decide all primer
design parameter settings freely. The primers thus found
are guaranteed to be specific among the uploaded
sequences only, not among the entire set of same-species
sequences from DATFAP as are the primers provided a priori with DATFAP.
The homologies between all sequences in DATFAP have
been charted. This means that for any sequence resulting
from a search, all its homologs can be displayed. For DATFAP purposes, two sequences A and B are defined to be
homologous if and only if:
• blastn with e-value 10-7 finds significant sequence similarity between A and B
• the total length of all regions in A that are similar to
regions in B must be at least 60% of the total length of A,
or vice versa.
Thus, in order for A and B to be defined as homologs, one
must "cover" at least 60% of the other with high similarity. This measure naturally induces a graph structure over
all sequences in DATFAP, called the TF graph, where the
sequences are the nodes of the graph, and an edge
between two nodes represents a homology relationship
between them. Starting at any node in the graph, one can
therefore follow its edges to reach its homologs – if it has
any. DATFAP provides an easy means of navigating the
graph this way, described below.
If a sequence has any DATFAP homologs, a link in the
DATFAP homologs column (on the main results page, cf.
Figure 1) takes the user to a page where a colored, multiple alignment of the sequence and all its homologs is displayed, as well as the sequence phylogeny deduced during
the construction of the alignment using the UPGMA clustering method (Figure 3). All alignments are prepared by
MultAlin [15] or, in the few cases that were too large for
MultAlin, ClustalW [16]. The more red an alignment column is, the more sequences agree in this position (the
details of this color scheme are given in the Help page on
the DATFAP web site). Regions with low conservation are
not shown in detail.

of the connected components of the huge TF graph,
namely the rice node and the four nodes it has edges to.
Frame 3 shows other edges and nodes in the graph in
shaded gray.

From the homology alignment page, there are two further
links: 1) Find general primer set amplifying all selected
sequences, and 2) Create search from this group of
homologs. Next to each sequence header listed at the top
of the page there is a small check box. Using these check
boxes, the user may mark some of the sequences and
design one general primer set targeting any of the marked
sequences (using the tool PriFi [18]). If we think of the
pre-designed, specific primer sets as being horizontally oriented (with respect to an alignment), this option allows
the user to design primer sets which are vertically oriented
(Figure 4).

Now the user may choose to create a search from the
group of five homologs currently showing. This leads to a
new main results page (frame 4) with the rice,
Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis and maize sequences. Again,
the user can choose to view the homologs of some
selected sequence, this time a maize sequence (upper yellow ball), and frame 5 then shows this sequence and its
five homologs from Arabidopsis (red ball), wheat (lilac
ball), tomato (green balls) and rice (previously selected
light green ball). Comparing to frame 3, this is simply a
different part (subtree) of the TF graph with the yellow
maize node as root.

The other link mimics performing a search from scratch
which results in exactly the homologous sequences currently showing in the alignment. This corresponds to
selecting the current "mother sequence" and its neighbors
in the TF graph as the current sequences, and enables the
user to view and download (FASTA format) this particular
set of sequences, view and download (FASTA format)
their specific primer sets, and view their homologs. This
procedure is illustrated in Figure 5 which is explained
next.

Finally, the user can select some of the current sequences
(rice, wheat and tomato sequences; yellow, lilac and green
balls) and design a general set of primers targeting all of
these sequences (frame 6). This is helpful if the user is
studying homologs of the same transcription factor in several species: Then one such general primer set would suffice to amplify the gene in all species.

After the user has performed some search, frame 1 of Figure 5 shows the resulting sequences from Medicago
(orange balls), cotton (purple balls), tomato (green balls)
and rice (light green balls). The user may now choose to
view the specific primers provided for, say, one of the rice
sequences (frame 2). Next, going back to the main results
page (frame 1), the user may click to view the homologs
of the same rice sequence.
This leads to a page (frame 3) showing the rice sequence
(light green ball) and its four DATFAP homologs from
Chlamydomonas (ice blue ball), Arabidopsis (red ball) and
maize (yellow balls). In fact, what is shown is a part of one

Since sequences are collected from several sources, duplicates do exist and have been removed from DATFAP. Two
sequences are considered duplicates either if they are
identical, or if they are at least 99.9% similar (according
to blastn with e-value 10-7) while one is completely covered by the other (minus at most 10 nucleotides). Priorities are given to the classification criteria: if sequences A
and B are considered duplicates while A originates from
an external transcription factor database and B is solely in
DATFAP because of homology to another DATFAP
sequence, A is kept and B is removed since higher "transcription factor credibility" is given to external database
origin than to homology.

Conclusion
The primer pairs are designed according to stringent criteria regarding melting temperature, GC content etc., and
first and foremost according to the principle that a primer
pair must have a perfect alignment to its target sequence

and to no other sequences from the same species in the
database. Primer design and PCR is an experimental science, and no guarantees can be given that primers
designed by a computer program will work, regardless of
the program. Good algorithms show a very high success

rate, though; e.g., in the extensive studies by Czechowski
and colleagues [13] and Caldana and colleagues [19],
96% and 97% of all reactions yielded specific products,
respectively. The primers of DATFAP are designed in a way
which is similar to what was done in these studies. This
author has designed several free, computerized, webbased primer design tools in the past according to exactly
the same principles as those used for the DATFAP primers
(e.g. [19,15]). One, PriFi, consistently has 25–50 users
each day from more than 30 countries all over the world,
most of whom are returning customers. In this author's
view, the satisfaction of these users warrants the approach.

The DATFAP web site includes an elaborate Help page
which illustrations, details and examples of the search
facility.

The projects described in [13,19] are Real-Time PCR platforms for Arabidopsis and Rice transcription factors,
respectively, offering primers for the purposes of highthroughput expression profiling. Moreover, extensive
experimental work utilizing the primers resulted in
important insight and new knowledge regarding, e.g.,
organ-specific expression of certain genes. Such were not
the primary goals of the DATFAP project. Through its suite
of 13 species and easy means of searching and relating
sequences within or between species, and through its predefined specific primers complemented by its option for
creating cross-species primers, DATFAP is a general-purpose tool, hopefully paving the way for many different
kinds of research centered around transcription factors.
DATFAP is a user-friendly, web-based, graphical resource
freely available to anyone with an Internet browser.
Equipped with a sophisticated search facility and specific
primers for (almost) all sequences, DATFAP constitutes a
valuable tool to researchers in all areas of plant molecular
biology working with transcription factors. No other
multi-species transcription factor database offers such
easy inter- and intra-species navigation in the network of
related transcription factors.
