Abstract
Background: Benefits from high-throughput sequencing using 454 pyrosequencing technology may be most apparent
for species with high societal or economic value but few genomic resources. Rapid means of gene sequence and SNP
discovery using this novel sequencing technology provide a set of baseline tools for genome-level research. However, it
is questionable how effective the sequencing of large numbers of short reads for species with essentially no prior gene
sequence information will support contig assemblies and sequence annotation.
Results: With the purpose of generating the first broad survey of gene sequences in Eucalyptus grandis, the most widely
planted hardwood tree species, we used 454 technology to sequence and assemble 148 Mbp of expressed sequences
(EST). EST sequences were generated from a normalized cDNA pool comprised of multiple tissues and genotypes,
promoting discovery of homologues to almost half of Arabidopsis genes, and a comprehensive survey of allelic variation
in the transcriptome. By aligning the sequencing reads from multiple genotypes we detected 23,742 SNPs, 83% of which
were validated in a sample. Genome-wide nucleotide diversity was estimated for 2,392 contigs using a modified theta (θ)
parameter, adapted for measuring genetic diversity from polymorphisms detected by randomly sequencing a multigenotype cDNA pool. Diversity estimates in non-synonymous nucleotides were on average 4x smaller than in
synonymous, suggesting purifying selection. Non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) among 2,001 contigs
averaged 0.30 and was skewed to the right, further supporting that most genes are under purifying selection. Comparison
of these estimates among contigs identified major functional classes of genes under purifying and diversifying selection in
agreement with previous researches.
Conclusion: In providing an abundance of foundational transcript sequences where limited prior genomic information
existed, this work created part of the foundation for the annotation of the E. grandis genome that is being sequenced by
the US Department of Energy. In addition we demonstrated that SNPs sampled in large-scale with 454 pyrosequencing
can be used to detect evolutionary signatures among genes, providing one of the first genome-wide assessments of
nucleotide diversity and Ka/Ks for a non-model plant species.

Background
The high-throughput and cost-effectiveness of DNA pyrosequencing using 454 Life Sciences technology [1] has
been successfully applied to large-scale EST sequencing in
maize [2,3], Medicago [4] and Arabidopsis [5,6], resulting
in a significant contribution of additional ESTs for these
species. However, these studies were carried out on organisms with extensive transcriptome sequences already
available. Pre-existing sequences support the assembly of
454 reads into contigs, thereby minimizing the drawback
of short average read length (100–200 bp) produced by
the pyrosequencing technology. However, the benefits
from recent improvements in sequencing technologies
may be even more valuable for plant species with high
economic value but limited genomic resources. Yet, it has
not been shown whether the primary limitations of the
pyrosequencing method – short read lengths and ambiguous homopolymer reads – can be overcome to produce
useful information for species with essentially no prior
gene sequence information.
The 454 sequencing also provides an opportunity to identify allelic variants by sequencing and aligning ESTs from
several haplotypes. Recently, two 454 cDNA sequencing
runs, each interrogating a single maize inbred line, were
used to identify over 36,000 putative single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) [7]. SNP discovery with 454 technology could also be accomplished by simultaneously
sequencing multiple genotypes to sample the nucleotide
diversity of an organism [8,9]. However, the assembly of
individual haplotypes is not feasible when sequencing a
cDNA pool from highly heterozygous individuals. The
unavailability of haplotype sequences hinders the use of
most statistics to calculate genetic diversity. Therefore,
new models are needed to estimate population genetic
parameters.
Here we describe sequencing, assembly, and SNP discovery from 454-derived EST sequences of Eucalyptus grandis,
a species with virtually no public genome sequence information. Eucalyptus is the most widely planted woody
angiosperm in the world [10]. Because of its value as a
renewable source of raw material for wood, paper prod-

ucts, and biofuels, E. grandis has been selected for
sequencing by the U.S. Department of Energy/Joint
Genome Institute for completion in 2010 [11]. Accurate
annotation of the E. grandis genome sequence will rely
heavily upon a repository of expressed sequences, as was
demonstrated during the annotation of the Arabidopsis
[12] and Populus [13] genomes. However, only 1,939 E.
grandis expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are currently
deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Thus, rapid development of a
large EST sequence collection will be crucial to support the
E. grandis genome sequence annotation and for continued
advancement of Eucalyptus genomics research.
With the purpose of generating the first broad survey of
genes in a Eucalyptus species, we sequenced and assembled
148 Mbp of E. grandis ESTs from two GS-20 and one GSFLX 454 pyrosequencing runs. Assembled sequences
(25.4 Mbp) were deposited in the GenBank representing
a 37× enrichment in publicly available expressed
sequences for the species. Sequences were generated from
a normalized cDNA pool comprised of multiple tissues
and genotypes, promoting extensive gene discovery and a
comprehensive survey of allelic variation in the transcriptome. We demonstrate that 454 reads can be reassembled
into contigs without utilizing traditional cDNA sequences
as scaffolds. In addition, we show that SNPs detected from
pyrosequencing a pool of genotypes are useful to reveal
selection signatures among genes. Pyrosequencing technology can rapidly provide a foundational public
genomic resource for an economically important but previously uncharacterized species.

Results
454 pyrosequencing and assembly of E. grandis ESTs
An E. grandis normalized cDNA library was synthesized
from RNA of vegetative tissues sampled from 21 different
genotypes. Two GS-20 and one GS-FLX 454 pyrosequencing runs performed on the normalized cDNA pool generated 1,024,251 reads comprising 148.4 Mbp of sequence
(Table 1). The GS-FLX platform produced more reads than
the GS-20 and an average read length 2× longer. To compare the length distributions of contiguous sequences

(contigs) using the different 454 platforms, we separately
assembled the reads from the two GS-20 runs, the GS-FLX
run alone, and from all the three sequencing runs combined (Table 2). The two GS-20 runs generated contigs
measuring 131 bp on average, with 95% of the contigs
being shorter than 250 bp. Despite generating only 25%
more sequence than the GS-20 runs combined, the longer
reads obtained with the GS-FLX platform render contigs
that average almost three times longer (353 bp). The GSFLX run allowed assembly of the E. grandis 454-derived
expressed sequences into long contigs that could be more
accurately annotated. Assembly of all three pyrosequencing runs generated 71,384 contigs with an average length
of 247 bp, of which 5,838 (8%) measure more than 500
bp. The addition of GS-20 reads increased the number of
short contigs in the full assembly, resulting in shorter
average contig length when compared to the assembly
with GS-FLX reads only.
Next we compared the sequences from 454 with 86,328
ESTs obtained from a proprietary database derived from
sequencing a broad set of Eucalyptus cDNA libraries using
conventional (Sanger) dideoxy-based sequencing (Table
1). The comparison shows that although Sanger contigs
were built from a dataset with only one third the total
basepairs of that derived from 454, they are on average
more than twice as long (Table 2). However, the larger
number of reads generated by the 454 technology substantially improves the efficiency of gene discovery, as
demonstrated below.
Annotation of the E. grandis ESTs
An E. grandis unigene set was generated by combining all
71,384 assembled contigs and 118,722 non-assembled
reads (singlets) generated by the three 454 runs. The unigene set was annotated by searching for sequence similarities using BlastX against Arabidopsis (TAIR v. 7.0), Populus

(JGI v. 1.1) and Oryza (TIGR v. 5.0) gene models. As
expected, the likelihood of finding similarity to previously
described gene models is highly dependent on the length
of the query sequence (Figure 1a). Logistic regression testing the effect of sequence length on whether or not the
query sequence have at least one BlastX hit (E value 10-5)
was highly significant (p-value < 0.00001). For instance,
sequences longer than 1000 bp have significant similarity
(E value 10-5) with gene models from all three species in
96% of cases, whereas 88% of sequences shorter than 100
bp have no similarities to any annotated gene model.
Among 118,013 unigenes longer than 100 bp 38% have
similarity to at least one gene model at an E value of 10-5,
28% at an E value of 10-10, and 15% at an E value of 10-20
(Figure 1b). The low proportion of BlastX hits is mainly
due to the high frequency of shorter sequences (75th percentile = 252 bp).
Next, we determined the proportion of annotated gene
models for which homology was detected among E. grandis unigenes measuring over 100 bp. Homology was
detected to 45% of Arabidopsis, 39% of Populus, and 22%
of Oryza gene models (E value 10-5). The higher proportion of Arabidopsis genes that are apparent homologues to
Eucalyptus is expected as the two species are more phylogenetically related than to Populus or Oryza [14]. Arabidopsis
gene models are also more refined than those from the
other plant species. Analyzing only the 22,032 Arabidopsis
gene models for which there is any detected transcript evidence (TAIR v. 7.0) leads to a higher proportion of
homologies: 58% with E value 10-5 and 39% with E value
10-20 (Table 3). Finally, we utilized the Gene Ontology
(GO) classifications from the Arabidopsis best-hit gene
models (E value 10-5). Proportions of best hits in each GO
category were generally similar to those found in the Arabidopsis genome annotation (Figure 2). The GO annotation analysis reinforces the inference that a broad diversity

the 21,432 contigs with 17,203 singlets. The Sanger unigene set has a total of 22.05 Mbp, and is therefore comparable to the 25.42 Mbp in the E. grandis 454 unigenes
measuring over 100 bp. We first aligned the two unigene
sets to each other using BlastN (E value 10-5), and detected
84% of the Sanger unigenes having a match to the 454

dataset but only 41% of the 454 unigenes having homology to the Sanger sequences (data not shown). This is an
indication of a greater coverage of distinct cDNAs in the
454 derived sequences. However, it is possible that the
higher frequency of shorter sequences found in the 454
dataset contributed to an increased number of no-hits, as
shorter sequences are less likely to align with a significant
E-value. To rule out this possibility, Sanger unigenes were

also used in an analogous BlastX against the Arabidopsis,
Populus and Oryza gene models. For all organisms and all
Blast thresholds applied, a larger number of gene models
had similarity to the 454 unigenes than those generated
by Sanger sequencing (Table 3). Therefore, the large
number of reads generated by 454 pyrosequencing
appears to maximize gene discovery in EST sequencing
projects. On the other hand, mean Blast alignment

lengths using the 454 unigenes are approximately 2×
shorter than for the Sanger unigene set (data not shown).
Thus, although the 454 unigene set samples a broader
diversity of transcriptional units, this occurs at the cost of
decreased length of sequence of the individual genes.
SNP detection and validation in the E. grandis 454generated ESTs
The GS Reference Mapper (454 Life Science) software was
used to identify polymorphisms among ESTs by aligning
individual reads against contigs from the assembly. For a
sequence difference to be declared a true polymorphism,
at least two individual reads aligning to the consensus
must have the variant allele and at least two others must
have the allele of the consensus. By applying this criterion,
30,108 variants were detected in 10,223 contigs (Table 4).
We analyzed only single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and excluded all 821 indels and 635 variants
involving more than one nucleotide. Also, we considered
only 23,742 higher confidence SNPs for which both alleles were present in at least 10% of the reads aligned at the
polymorphic locus. Although this requirement reduces
the sensitivity in detecting rare SNPs, it increases the specificity of true SNP detection by lowering the likelihood of
including false variants that arise due to sequencing
errors. Among both high and low confidence SNPs, the
proportion of transition nucleotide substitutions (75 and
85%) was greater than the proportion of transversions (25
and 15%).

To validate SNPs detected by GS Reference Mapper, we
PCR amplified a sample of 43 contig sequences from the
normalized cDNA used in the 454 sequencing. Each
amplicon was sequenced bidirectionally (forward and
reverse) using standard dideoxy-based sequencing in an
ABI3730. Sequencing chromatograms were analyzed with
Chromas 2.32 (Technelysium Pty. Ltd.), and SNPs were
identified as overlapping nucleotide peaks. The number
of putative SNP loci encompassed in the sequences of

each amplicon ranged from 3 to 15 (Table 5). Of 337 SNP
loci predicted to reside in the amplified sequences, 279
(82.8%) were validated.
Analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs in E.
grandis genes
The proportion of mutations that change amino acid
sequence (i.e. non-synonymous) relative to those that do
not (i.e. synonymous) can indicate whether a gene is
under purifying, neutral or diversifying selection [15]. The
large number of ESTs sequenced from a mixture of genotypes could provide information for a genome-wide analysis of gene evolution based on the ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous substitutions (Ks). To
carry out this analysis, we initially determined whether
SNPs introduce synonymous or non-synonymous mutations by (1) defining the sequence reading frame with a
BlastX alignment against Arabidopsis peptides, (2) isolating codons containing SNPs, and (3) comparing the translated amino acids for each allele. Next, the degeneracy of
nucleotides in the contigs' coding sequence was evaluated
to estimate non-synonymous to synonymous substitution
rate (Ka/Ks). We estimated Ka/Ks for 2,001 E. grandis contigs that have at least three high confidence SNPs and one
positive BlastX hit against Arabidopsis gene models (E
value 10-5) [see Additional file 1]. Distribution of Ka/Ks
among these contigs was right-skewed, with estimates
ranging from 0.008 to 2.101 and averaging 0.30, suggesting that the majority of the genes are under purifying
selection.

Gene ontology (GO) categories associated with contig
annotations derived by homologies to A. thaliana gene
models allowed us to compare frequency of GO class representation in the extremes of the Ka/Ks distribution. Two
binary variables ("purifying" and "diversifying") were created to classify contigs according to their Ka/Ks – contigs
with Ka/Ks smaller than 0.15 (643 contigs) were classified
as "purifying", while those with Ka/Ks greater than 0.5

Number and percentage of non-validated and validated SNPs for each of the 43 amplicons sequenced with dideoxy-based method

may be an overly stringent criterion of positive selection
when estimated for the whole coding sequence [16], and
therefore we utilized a lower threshold (0.5) for this analysis. A Fisher's exact test for each binary category was used
to statistically define GO Biological Process classes
enriched in the Ka/Ks distribution extremes. Table 6
depicts GO classes enriched (p-value < 0.05) among contigs on the two Ka/Ks extremes. Genes encoding proteins

of the ribosome complex and involved in translation are
the most significantly enriched (p-value = 0.0006) within
the "purifying" classification. In addition, genes encoding
proteins involved in nucleosome assembly, chromosome
organization and proteosome complex also appear to be
constrained by purifying selection. Among GO categories
of genes undergoing diversifying selection, there is enrichment for only those with unknown function and organismal development.

Nucleotide diversity among the E. grandis genes
In addition to the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks), a measurement of nucleotide
diversity can also reveal differences in selection pressure
acting on different genes. However, since our sequencing
method generated ESTs from a pool of 21 E. grandis genotypes, identification of the genotypic origin for each read
becomes impossible. As a result the assembly of individual haplotypes is unfeasible and exact estimation of standard nucleotide polymorphism parameters such as theta
(θ) [17] could not be obtained. Thus, we developed a relative measurement of nucleotide diversity, referred hereafter as beta (β), which normalizes the number of
polymorphisms detected relative to the sequence length
and depth of each contig. Sequence length and depth are
variables affecting the likelihood of finding SNP when it
is present in a given contig. The parameter β is estimated
by the equation:

⎛ S +1 ⎞
⎜
⎟
L ⎠
β = ⎝
D−
∑i =11 (1 / i)
where S is the number of SNPs detected in the contig, L is
the contig sequence length and D is the sequencing depth
estimated by the average number of reads aligned to each
nucleotide position during assembly of the contig. The
constant 1 was added to the number of SNPs in the
numerator to enable comparisons with contigs containing
no detected SNP. Contigs with extensive length and depth
but for which no SNP is detected represent highly conserved genes.
There is one important distinction between β and the traditional nucleotide polymorphism estimate θ. When calculating θ, the average sequencing depth (D) variable in β
is, instead, the number of different sampled haplotypes.
These two variables are different because sequence reads
from 454 represent a random sample from the pool of

haplotypes in the cDNA library. Therefore some haplotypes may be sequenced multiple times, while others may
not be sampled at all. Although this complicates comparisons with θ estimates from other studies, β is useful as a
relative measurement to compare the nucleotide diversity
between contigs generated within this project.
We estimated β for the 2,392 contigs with coding
sequence measuring more than 200 bp and an average
sequencing depth of at least 10 reads/nt [see Additional
file 2]. These thresholds reduce imprecision in the proportion of SNPs per nucleotide as well as the likelihood that
all reads aligned to the contig on a given nucleotide arise
from the same haplotype. Three β parameters were calculated for each contig: βT, which estimates the diversity on
the entire contigs, including its non-coding regions; βN,
which estimates the diversity in non-synonymous sites;
and βS, which estimates the diversity in synonymous sites.
As observed for the Ka/Ks ratio, the distributions of all
three nucleotide diversity parameters (Table 7) were rightskewed, suggesting that the majority of E. grandis transcribed regions are constrained by purifying selection.
Average values of βS were more than 4× larger compared
with diversity in non-synonymous nucleotides (βN), offering further evidence for the action of natural selection on
the genetic diversity detected in these genes.
The annotation of each contig from homology to A. thaliana gene models was again used to compare GO categories enriched in the extremes of the βN distribution.
Similarly to Ka/Ks, two binary variables were empirically
created to identify genes on the "conserved" and "diverse"
extremes of the βN distribution. The "conserved" classification has 605 contigs with βN smaller than 1.0 × 10-3. The
"diverse" classification has 209 contigs with βN greater
than 3.5 × 10-3. Fisher's exact test for each binary category
detected GO classes enriched among each of the two βN
extremes (Table 8). As suggested by the Ka/Ks analysis for
genes undergoing purifying selection, the "conserved"

extreme of βN is also enriched for genes encoding proteosome core factors involved in protein degradation. In
addition, in the conserved extreme we also found enrichment for genes involved in malate metabolism. Among
contigs classified as "diverse", there is enrichment for
genes of unknown function and for genes involved in
defense response, including response to biotic stimuli.

Discussion
Our analysis of 148.4 Mbp of E. grandis expressed
sequences generated with three 454 sequencing runs demonstrates that short reads produced with pyrosequencing
technology can be assembled de novo into reasonably long
contigs; an advantage for species with limited public
genomic resources. The 25.4 Mbp comprised in our unigene set represents an enrichment of 37× in the amount of
publicly available E. grandis expressed sequences, and will
provide substantial support for the genome sequencing
and annotation that are currently under way [11]. Longer
reads from the GS-FLX were essential to assemble a reasonable proportion of biologically relevant contig
sequences. Although our sequencing effort produced
three times more sequence (≈ 148 Mbp) than the control
dideoxy-based EST library (Sanger, ≈ 45 Mbp), the 454
short read-based contigs average only one third of the size.
Despite this limitation, a substantial gain occurs at the
level of gene discovery – the large number of reads in our
454 dataset leads to sampling of sequences from a much
broader variety of genes. Therefore, 454-based gene discovery projects represent a viable and, perhaps favorable
alternative to Sanger-based sequencing of EST libraries
when a diverse sampling of genes is more important than
obtaining transcript-length contigs. As GS-FLX becomes
the standard 454 pyrosequencing platform, large-scale

EST sequencing and gene discovery projects will be more
successful in assembly of transcript-length contigs.
We also demonstrated that the detection of valid SNPs is
possible by sequencing a pooled sample of highly heterozygous genotypes. By aligning the reads derived from
cDNA of 21 E. grandis genotypes, we were able to detect
23,742 SNPs and validate 83% of a sample of 337. Therefore, approximately 4,000 of the detected SNPs may be
false positives, possibly arising from sequencing errors or
alignment of paralogs. Paralogs that share high levels of
sequence similarity may have been assembled in the same
contig because they cannot be distinguished due to the
short read length of 454 pyrosequencing. This would lead
to the detection of false SNPs. On the other hand, a higher
stringency of assembly raises the possibility of the opposite problem: the separate assembly of haplotypes from
highly polymorphic genes. However, the assessment of
the EST assembly quality in this study is difficult due to
the lack of a reference genome sequence. Nonetheless, the
validation rate observed here was similar to the 85%
reported for maize, where SNPs were detected by comparing sequences from two separate 454 runs, each interrogating a different inbred homozygous line [7].
A significant number of polymorphisms in our sample
may have been overlooked because of the stringent methodology used to declare SNPs. For contigs with reasonable
sequence coverage (length > 200 bp) and depth (> 10
reads on average per nucleotide) we detected one SNP for
every 192 bp on average. This rate of SNP discovery
appears low compared to previous reports of one SNP
every ≈ 100 bp in coding sequences of Eucalyptus [18,19]
and other forest species [20-25]. There are at least three
foreseeable reasons for missing true SNPs that are intrinsic
to our experimental methodology and SNP detection
approach. First, because 454 was used to randomly
sequence cDNAs, not all genotypes were sequenced for
every SNP locus – in fact, the average sequencing depth
(6.7 reads/bp) in our experiment is far lower than the
number of possible haplotypes in our sample. Secondly,
the requirement that a SNP be observed in at least 10% of
the reads aligned to a polymorphic site compromised the
sensitivity required to detect rare alleles. Studies have

demonstrated an excess of rare alleles in natural populations of forest tree species [22-24] which are probably
largely discarded by our approach. Additionally, there is a
relatively high level of relatedness among the 21 individuals utilized in our study. The sampled genotypes come
from seven open-pollinated families – i.e. seven groups of
three individuals share one common maternal parent,
limiting the genetic diversity sampled relative to what
might be present in a similarly sized sample of unrelated
trees. Finally, the detection of polymorphisms was likely
hindered by the requirement that at least two reads containing the variant alleles have at least 20 nucleotides of
conserved sequence upstream and downstream of the
locus. This requirement is intended to minimize the discovery of false polymorphisms due to the alignment of
paralogs – a potentially significant problem when aligning short sequence reads. Therefore, only nucleotide variants in relatively conserved or recently derived paralogs
may have been incorrectly identified as SNPs. The drawback is that true SNPs in hotspots of genetic diversity or
genes under high diversifying selection (e.g. disease-resistance genes, [26]) may be discarded. Considering the high
diversity found in forest trees [20-25], the requirement for
sequence conservation in regions surrounding a SNP may
be too conservative.
High throughput DNA sequencing and SNP discovery
from a pool of multiple genotypes may be a powerful
approach for rapid assessment of genetic diversity and
selection in a genomic scale. Genome-wide surveys of
genetic diversity have only recently been reported in the
model plant Arabidopsis [27]. Here we attempted to generate an approximate estimate of genetic diversity for a
broad sample of genes by adapting existing parameters of
genetic diversity to our experimental methodology. The
most commonly used measure of genetic diversity, the
nucleotide diversity parameter theta (θ), is an estimate of
the number of polymorphic sites in a random haplotype
sample from a population and is independent of the allele
frequencies [17,28]. In our study, the number of independent haplotypes sampled is unknown, as the same
haplotype may be sampled repeatedly. Therefore we
developed a modified nucleotide diversity estimator beta
(β) based on SNPs detected by randomly sequencing a
multi-genotype cDNA pool. β is always underestimated
relative to θ, because the number of reads at a given SNP
position is always equal or smaller than the effective
(true) number of genotypes. The lower sensitivity to
detect SNPs discussed previously also contributes to the
underestimation of β. Therefore, the average β reported
here (0.00186) is, as expected, much lower than the average θ estimated for genes of Populus by 9× [23], Douglas
fir by 3.8× [24], loblolly pine by 2.2–2.7× [20,21,29] and
Norway Spruce by 1.7× [22]. Although it is not possible to
compare estimates of β to the commonly used θ, they are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/312

useful for a comparison of nucleotide diversity among
genes in this project.
In addition to the nucleotide diversity (β) we also estimated the proportion of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks). As observed in other plant
species [13,16,30] most genes of E. grandis appear to be
under purifying selection and, accordingly, Ka/Ks distribution averages 0.30 and is heavily right-skewed. Among
genes predicted to be under strong purifying selection
based on the Ka/Ks ratio, there is enrichment for GO categories involving essential biological processes conserved
across kingdoms, such as translation, ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and nucleosome assembly by histones. rRNA and ribosomal proteins have been shown to
be highly conserved between species and to evolve under
strong purifying selection [31-33]. Several studies also
confirm that histone genes evolve constrained by negative
selection [34-36].
Among genes classified as diverse and/or under positive
selection based on βN and Ka/Ks distributions, there is
enrichment for genes classified as unknown biological
process, defense response and response to biotic stress,
and multicellular development. Other researchers have
already reported an excess of unknown function among
genes under positive selection [16,30,37]. A possible
explanation for this overrepresentation is that the category
of uncharacterized genes may be enriched for duplicated
genes where relaxed selection constraints are leading their
diversification and/or eventual silencing [38]. In fact, the
category may include pseudogenes and transcribed but
untranslated loci. It is also possible that duplicated genes
might have higher nucleotide diversity due to the assembly of paralogs. However we do not anticipate false SNPs
to bias Ka/Ks estimates because they are not expected to
occur more or less frequently in synonymous versus nonsynonymous sites by chance.
Genes acting in defense response/response to biotic stimulus are frequently positively selected for diversification to
compete with rapidly evolving avirulence genes of pathogens [26,39]. We did find extensive diversity in non-synonymous sites (βN) of most defense response genes, but
the diversity was also high among synonymous sites and,
as a result, these genes were not enriched among those
under diversifying selection (measured by the Ka/Ks).
Similar results were reported in another study [16]. One
possible explanation is that positive selection generally
only operates in certain domains (i.e., leucine-rich repeat
(LRR)) of resistance genes [26,39] and we estimated Ka/Ks
over the entire coding sequence. The multicellular development GO class which is enriched among genes under
diversifying selection is mainly due to the presence of
NAC transcription factor genes. Transcription factors have

Page 10 of 14

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:312

been demonstrated to have an excess of positively selected
genes in humans [40], and specifically one member of the
NAC family was shown to be evolving rapidly in Arabidopsis [30]. Finally, the literature survey supports our results
and demonstrates that the proposed nucleotide diversity
estimator (β) accurately depicts relative differences of variability within gene sequences.

Conclusion
The unigene sequences being released from this study will
provide a much needed public resource for Eucalyptus
research and will be important for the annotation of the
forthcoming E. grandis genome sequence. 454-based EST
sequencing and de novo assembly can provide a foundational transcriptome resource when limited prior
sequence information is available. Lastly, we showed that
nucleotide diversity of an organism can be sampled by
high-throughput sequencing a pool of genotypes, and
that this strategy is useful for detecting evolutionary signatures in a large number of genes that are in agreement with
smaller scale traditional sequencing projects.

Methods
Plant material and RNA extraction
Three greenhouse-grown Eucalyptus grandis seedlings from
each of seven open-pollinated families (21 genotypes in
total) were dissected into xylem (Xy), phloem (Ph), roots
(R), young leaves(YL), mature leaves (ML) and apical/lateral meristems (M). Tissues were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored. For each tissue, RNA was
extracted by a standard protocol [41] from a pool of equal
proportion of plant material from all 21 genotypes[41,41]. RNA concentration was estimated using an
ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop USA, Wilmington, DE) and integrity was evaluated on an agarose gel
stained with ethidium bromide.
cDNA synthesis and normalization
RNA isolated from each tissue pool was combined in varying proportions (10% YL, 10% ML, 15% R, 15% Ph, 20%
M and 30% Xy) to a single pool in an attempt to maximize
the diversity of transcriptional units sampled. Pooled
RNA was DNase treated and purified using the RNAeasy
Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen USA, Valencia, CA). Full-length
cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA using the Clontech SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (Clontech
USA, Mountain View, CA) according to manufacturer's
protocol, except that the Clontech CDSIII/3' PCR primer
was replaced with the Evrogen CDS-3M adaptor (Evrogen,
Moscow). cDNA was amplified using PCR Advantage II
Polymerase (Clontech USA, Mountain View, CA) in 16
thermo cycles (7s at 95°C, 20s at 66°C, and 4 mins at
72°C) and was subsequently purified using the QIAquick
PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen USA, Valencia, CA). The
cDNA was normalized using the Evrogen Trimmer-Direct

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/312

Kit (Evrogen, Moscow) to minimize differences in representation of transcripts. This normalization protocol is
based on denaturing-reassociation of cDNAs, followed by
digestion with a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN). The
enzymatic degradation occurs primarily on the highlyabundant cDNA fraction. The single-stranded cDNA fraction was then amplified twice by sequential PCR reactions
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Adaptors incorporated during the first strand synthesis were partially
removed by SfiI digestion (8 U/μg of cDNA). Normalized
cDNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen USA, Valencia, CA).
454 sequencing and assembly
Approximately 15 μg of normalized cDNA were used for
library construction and sequencing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the
University of Florida, following the procedures described
by Margulies et al. [1]. Two sequencing runs were produced on the GS-20 platform, and one on the GS-FLX.
Bases were called with 454 software by processing the
pyroluminescence intensity for each bead-containing well
in each nucleotide incorporation. An initial assembly of
the sequences was performed with Newbler version
1.1.02.15 (454 Life Science, Branford, CT). Newbler considers the normalized intensity of each nucleotide flow,
instead of individual base calls, which is more suited to
assembly with sequencing by synthesis like 454. However,
Newbler v.1.1.02.15 does not mask sequence repeats like
the adaptors used for the cDNA normalization. Thus, after
initial assembly of all reads, except those containing adaptor sequences, in Newbler further assembly was performed with Paracel Transcript Assembler (PTA) version
3.0.0 (Paracel Inc., Pasadena, CA). All contigs and singletons resulting from the Newbler assembly were combined
with adaptor-containing reads for input into PTA. Using a
threshold of 15, all sequences were masked for the presence of oligonucleotide adaptors used during cDNA
library preparation and normalization. Low base-call
quality (score ≤ 10) data was trimmed from the ends of
individual sequences. Low complexity sequence regions
(simple sequence repeats) are identified and excluded
from consideration during initial pair-wise comparison,
but are included during final alignment and consensus
building. Assembly is performed in two stages. The first
stage uses "Haste" algorithm to build groups (or clusters)
of sequences sharing a minimal amount of identifiable
sequence similarity (threshold = 50). The second stage
carefully assembles sequences within individual clusters
into consensus transcripts using the software defaults,
except parameters MinCovRep (500), InOverhang (30),
EndOverhang (30), RemOverhang (30), QualSumLim
(300), MaxInternalGaps (15) and PenalizeN (0). Files
containing reads' sequence and quality scores were deposited in the Short Read Archive of the National Center for

Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [accession number
SRA001122]. Newbler and PTA assembly files were also
submitted to NCBI.
SNP detection and validation
To detect SNPs in the cDNA pool, we used the consensus
assembly generated from all sequencing runs as a reference sequence to which individual reads were aligned
using GS Reference Mapper (454 Life Science, Branford,
CT). Each read was aligned to only a single best homologous site in the reference sequence. Reads aligning equally
well in more than one location in the reference were discarded. GS Reference Mapper only scores polymorphisms
where two or more reads contain the variant allele. Additionally, at least two reads with the alternative allele must
include ≥ 20 bases upstream and downstream of the variable nucleotide and no more than one additional
sequence polymorphism in this window. For the analysis
reported here, we considered only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), excluding all indels and variants
involving more than one nucleotide. We also imposed the
constraint that the variant allele appears in at least 10% of
the total number of reads covering the polymorphic site.

added to both number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. This was important to allow Ka/Ks
estimation in cases where either type of substitution was
not found. Had we not included this modification, genes
with an excess of synonymous but no observed non-synonymous substitutions would all have Ka/Ks equal zero,
regardless of their Ks value. On the other hand, genes
without any observed synonymous substitution would
have undefined Ka/Ks because of division by zero.

Authors' contributions
EN and DRD synthesized and normalized the cDNA
library, summarized sequencing results, annotated the
sequences and wrote the manuscript. EN developed the
modified methods to estimate nucleotide diversity
parameters from 454 sequences. WGF generated and
assembled the 454 sequences and identified the SNPs.
GJPJ and DG provided the dideoxy-based sequences and
did the comparative analysis to the 454 data. RS and MK
coordinated and supervised the experiment implementation, and assisted in the analysis of data and manuscript
preparation.

Additional material
To validate a sample of detected SNPs, we designed primers to amplify 500–700 bp of transcripts containing a
large number of putative SNPs. Using the normalized
cDNA as template, fragments were amplified using PCR
with 30 thermocycles of 94°C for 30s, 55°C for 30s and
72°C for 35s. The amplified fragments (amplicons) were
purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen
USA, Valencia, CA). Each amplicon was sequenced with
both forward and reverse primers using standard dideoxybased technology analyzed on the ABI3730 platform
(Applied Biosystems). Sequencing chromatograms were
visually analyzed with Chromas 2.32 (Technelysium Pty.
Ltd.), and SNPs were identified as overlapping nucleotide
peaks. For the SNP to be verified, the variant allele must
have a chromatogram peak at least 50% higher than background peaks.
Analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations
Protein coding sequence for each consensus was delimited using the best BlastX hit (E value 10-5) against the Arabidopsis thaliana peptides translated from TAIR7 gene
models. Codons for each consensus were identified and
nucleotide degeneracy determined. The number of synonymous and non-synonymous sites was calculated for each
contig. Next, we determined whether SNPs positioned in
consensus coding sequences introduce synonymous or
nonsynonymous mutations by comparing the translated
amino acids from the reference and variant sequences. We
calculated the proportion of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation (Ka/Ks) for each consensus following
Hartl and Clark [28], with the exception that one unit was
