Abstract
Background: We have performed Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis of an F2 intercross between two chicken lines
divergently selected for juvenile body-weight. In a previous study 13 identified loci with effects on body-weight, only
explained a small proportion of the large variation in the F2 population. Epistatic interaction analysis however, indicated
that a network of interacting loci with large effect contributed to the difference in body-weight of the parental lines. This
previous analysis was, however, based on a sparse microsatellite linkage map and the limited coverage could have affected
the main conclusions. Here we present a revised QTL analysis based on a high-density linkage map that provided a more
complete coverage of the chicken genome. Furthermore, we utilized genotype data from ~13,000 SNPs to search the
genome for potential selective sweeps that have occurred in the selected lines.
Results: We constructed a linkage map comprising 434 genetic markers, covering 31 chromosomes but leaving seven
microchromosomes uncovered. The analysis showed that seven regions harbor QTL that influence growth. The pairwise interaction analysis identified 15 unique QTL pairs and notable is that nine of those involved interactions with a
locus on chromosome 7, forming a network of interacting loci. The analysis of ~13,000 SNPs showed that a substantial
proportion of the genetic variation present in the founder population has been lost in either of the two selected lines
since ~60% of the SNPs polymorphic among lines showed fixation in one of the lines. With the current marker coverage
and QTL map resolution we did not observe clear signs of selective sweeps within QTL intervals.
Conclusion: The results from the QTL analysis using the new improved linkage map are to a large extent in
concordance with our previous analysis of this pedigree. The difference in body-weight between the parental chicken
lines is caused by many QTL each with a small individual effect. Although the increased chromosomal marker coverage
did not lead to the identification of additional QTL, we were able to refine the localization of QTL. The importance of
epistatic interaction as a mechanism contributing significantly to the remarkable selection response was further
strengthened because additional pairs of interacting loci were detected with the improved map.

Background
This study is based on two unique chicken lines that have
been developed by bi-directional selection for bodyweight at 56 days of age [1]. The two lines originated from
the same base population and 40 generations of divergent
selection resulted in more than an eight-fold difference in
body-weight at the age of selection between the HighWeight (HWS) and the Low-Weight selected (LWS) lines.
We have bred a large F2 intercross between these lines as a
resource population for QTL analysis [2,3]. Despite a
powerful experimental design (~850 F2) a previous QTL
analysis could only explain about 13% of the residual
phenotypic variation for body-weight at selection age in
the F2 population and at most 50% of the difference
between the parental lines [2]. These results indicated that
the phenotypic difference between the two chicken lines
may be attributed to many QTL each with small individual effects in concordance with the infinitesimal model
for polygenic inheritance. We identified 13 QTL (denoted
Growth1 – Growth13) and at each locus the allele from the
HWS line was associated with increased growth consistent
with the line difference [2].
To further study the genetic architecture causing the phenotypic difference between the HWS and LWS lines Carlborg et al. [4] analyzed the QTL data using a genetic
model testing for pair-wise interaction between loci
(epistasis). The epistatic analysis revealed a network of six
interacting loci, all interactions involving the Growth9
QTL on chromosome 7. Growth9 was also detected as the
only QTL reaching genome-wide significance in the standard QTL analysis of body-weight at 56 days. The growthpromoting effect of the interacting loci was highly
dependent on the genotype at Growth9 as HWS homozygosity at this locus was required for the other interacting
loci to have a significant effect on growth. Moreover, LWS
line homozygosity at either Growth9 or all three of the loci
interacting with Growth9 effectively led to the network
having no effect on growth. Hence, the significant marginal effect observed in the one-locus QTL analysis for
Growth9 and the suggestive evidence for marginal effects
of the three other major loci in the network is manifested
solely by the interactions between Growth9 and the other
loci in the network. The genetic network was estimated to
account for about 45% of parental line difference at 56
days of age [4].
The previous analyses [2-4] were carried out using a rather
sparse microsatellite-based linkage map. The map lacked
markers on 13 microchromosomes and there were also
several regions with poor coverage. Therefore, it was possible that important QTL were missed due to lack of markers. A high-density linkage map would increase the power
to detect QTL and enhance the precision in the QTL analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/248

Here we report results from a QTL analysis, based on a
comprehensive linkage map, for body-weight traits using
our intercross between the HWS and LWS lines. First, we
performed a standard genome-wide one-dimensional
QTL analysis to fit a one-locus model to detect QTL with
main effects. Secondly, we performed a genome-wide
pair-wise search to detect epistatic interactions between
loci. Finally, we used data on about 13,000 SNPs to compare allele frequency distributions between the HWS and
LWS lines to investigate if we could detect any molecular
footprints in the form of selective sweeps caused by selection for body-weight.

Methods
Chicken lines and intercross
A large F2 intercross pedigree was set-up by crossing individuals from the HWS and LWS lines [2,3]. The two parental lines originated from a common base population
formed by intercrossing seven partially inbred White Plymouth Rock lines of chicken. The selected lines have been
developed and maintained at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA. The sex-average
mean body-weight, at the age of selection, for the HWS
line was at generation forty 1522 g (SD: ± 36), compared
to the LWS line with a sex-average mean of 181 g (SD: ±
5.4). Comprehensive information regarding the development, maintenance and characteristics of the selection
lines have been previously reviewed by Dunnington and
Siegel [1].

The development of the intercross and a detailed description of the husbandry have previously been described [3].
Briefly, to produce the reciprocal intercross (i.e., HL and
LH F2 progeny) we mated 10 HWS line males with 22 LWS
line females and eight LWS line males to 19 HWS line
females. From the F1 generation four HL males were
mated to 37 LH females and, four LH males were mated
to 38 HL females to produce an F2 population consisting
of 874 chickens. The F1 and F2 animals were housed in the
same facilities and fed the same dietary as the parental
selection lines. Chickens were provided ad libitum access
to water and feed. The F2 generation was produced in a
single hatch and all animals were sacrificed at 70 days of
age.
Phenotypic traits
Table 1 summarizes the phenotypic traits analyzed in this
study. Body-weight measurements were recorded for each
F2 bird at hatch, at 14, 28, 42, 56 and at 70 days of age.
DNA isolation, marker selection and genotyping
DNA was extracted from blood by AGOWA (Berlin, Germany) from chickens included in the intercross pedigree
(P, F1 and F2). Methods for SNP selection and the genotyping protocol used to generate the genotypes for ~13,000

(ANOVA). Sex was included as a fixed effect in the QTL
model for all body-weight traits. In contrary to the analysis performed by Park et al. [3] and Jacobsson et al. [2]
using the same F2 intercross, but consistent with our previous analysis of epistatic interaction [4] we did not
include family (F2 full sibling family) as a fixed effect in
our QTL model because the number of full-sib families
was large (75 in total) and because maternal effects in
chicken are expected to be small. Furthermore, we did not
include reciprocal mating in the QTL model because our
previous analysis showed that mating type did not have a
significant effect on growth [3].

Construction of linkage maps
We used the CRI-MAP software package to construct linkage maps [6]. We have previously reported a microsatellite-based linkage map constructed using this intercross
pedigree [7]. To build the current autosomal linkage map,
genotype data from 138 microsatellites were merged with
data from 351 SNPs. The dataset was checked for nonMendelian inheritance errors using the prepare option in
CRI-MAP. Markers were then ordered according to the
May 2006 genome assembly and the fixed option in CRIMAP was used to estimate sex-average map distances, in
Kosambi cM, between loci. Markers that were not
included in the genome assembly were incorporated at
the most likely position in the linkage map based on
results from a two-point linkage analysis. The order of
markers was evaluated using the functions flips and
chrompic in CRI-MAP.

The QTL analysis of autosomes was performed using
interval mapping as first described by Lander and Botstein
[8] and later modified for analyzing crosses between outbred lines by Haley and co-workers [9,10]. We used
QTLExpress [11] to calculate QTL genotype probabilities
conditional on marker genotypes. These were then used in
a least square regression-based QTL analysis conducted
using an in-house QTL mapping software [12]. Empirical
significance thresholds levels were established for each
trait by permutation [13] and the same significance
thresholds were used for all traits as the variation between
different traits were minimal. The 5% genome-wide significance level was set to an F-value > 9 and as genomewide suggestive level we used the chromosome-wide significance level for chromosome 4 (F-value > 6), because
this chromosome represents approximately 5% of the
chicken linkage map. With this suggestive level of significance we expect to find one false positive QTL (type-1
error) per trait and genome scan. Epistatic interaction
analysis was conducted as described by Carlborg et al.
[4,12]. In short, a statistical model including sex as a fixed
effect, the additive, dominance and all pair-wise epistatic
effects (additive-by-additive, additive-by-dominance,
dominance-by-additive and dominance-by-dominance)
of QTL pairs was used. This epistatic analysis increases the
power to identify loci whose effect is dependent on the
genotype at another locus. QTL pairs that reached the 5%
genome-wide significance threshold in a randomization
test for the joint effect of the epistatic pair (no QTL vs. two
interacting QTL or one QTL with significant individual
effect vs. two interacting QTL) and a 1% significance
threshold in a model-selection randomization test for the
joint effect of the epistatic parameters (two non-interacting QTL vs. two interacting QTL) are reported as epistatic
pairs. The randomization testing procedure was previously described in detail [14]. QTL peaks located within
25 cM of each other were assumed to represent the same
locus.

Statistical analysis
Factors affecting phenotypic trait variation in the F2 population were identified using analysis of variance

To visualize the effect of individual QTL pairs and also to
estimate the total contribution of the epistatic network,
we produced a dataset including only F2 individuals where

Sex-average mean, standard deviation (SD), number of individuals (n)
and the phenotypic range are given for each analyzed body-weight and
growth trait.
1Body-weight was measured at six different ages starting from hatch
to 70 days. Growth traits were calculated as the differences between
body-weights at the two weeks interval.
2Negative values for growth traits occur because some individuals lost
weight during a two-week interval.

SNP markers for 15 individuals from each parental strain
have been published elsewhere [5]. A set of 384 highly
informative SNPs were selected from the 13,000 SNPs, to
enable the construction of a linkage map comprising
about one marker every ten cM throughout the chicken
genome. SNP genotyping was conducted with the GoldenGate assay (Illumina, CA) at a DNA concentration of 50
ng/ul. Animals in the pedigree were genotyped at the SNP
technology platform in Uppsala (Sweden) while the
~13,000 SNP panel was analyzed at CNG in Paris
(France).

the genotype for all QTL in the main four locus network
affecting body-weight at 56 days of age could be determined with high confidence (n = 727). Only individuals
where the genotype probabilities exceeded 0.70 for all
four loci in the network were selected. The individuals
were then classified according to the most probable genotype (i.e. HH, HL or LL) for each locus. We calculated sexaveraged phenotypic means for all nine two-locus genotype classes and plotted the data. The combined effect of
the epistatic loci was visualized as follows. First, the dataset was stratified according to the genotype at the main
locus Growth9, one group to include the HWS homozygotes, a second group to contain the heterozygotes and a
third group including LWS homozygotes individuals
(HH; n = 176, HL; n = 365, LL; n = 186). For each of the
three groups we then created four more strata with individuals that were HWS homozygous for 0, 1, 2 or 3 of the
loci Growth4, Growth6 and Growth12. A one-sided twosample t-test was used to test for differences in mean
body-weight at 56 days of age between the groups.
Fst values [15] were calculated for each of the segregating
SNP markers using the GenePop software (version 4.0)
[16] to estimate the degree of differentiation between
lines because the two lines are expected to show marked
allele frequency differences at those loci that have
responded to the divergent selection. Observed homozygosity was measured as the number of homozygous individuals divided by the total number of individuals.
Confidence intervals for QTL regions for the body-weight
trait with the highest statistical significance were defined
with the one-LOD drop method [17].

Results
A linkage map including 434 genetic markers
We designed Illumina assays for parallel genotyping of
384 SNP markers segregating in the HWS/LWS intercross
in order to establish a linkage map with an improved
genome coverage compared to our previous microsatellite
map. Table 2 summarizes the linkage map comprising
altogether 316 SNPs and 118 previously genotyped microsatellites [7]. In Additional File 1 the marker order
together with the positions in cM and in Mb are presented.

Twenty out of the 138 microsatellites were excluded from
the current map either because of low information content or because they showed inheritance errors that
became apparent with the high-density marker map. Further, 35 SNPs were excluded, as they did not give reliable
genotype calls, and additionally 33 SNPs out of the 384,
were not considered in the current study as they are
located on the Z chromosome. This updated sex-average
autosomal linkage map now includes 434 genetic markers
and spans totally 2954 cM, with an average distance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/248

between adjacent markers of 6.8 cM. The total map length
is considerably shorter than expected from the old consensus map [18] but in good agreement with a new highresolution, SNP-based consensus map for chicken [19]. It
is clear that the inflated map length in the previous consensus map is because it was primarily based on microsatellite markers which have a higher rate of genotyping
errors than Illumina Golden gate SNP assays as used in the
present study and the new consensus map.
The current linkage map includes markers on chromosome 1–28, and in addition we also have markers on
unassigned linkage group E22C19W28E50C23. Two
genetic markers (GCT004, rs16748775) did not show
linkage to any other marker in the dataset. It is possible
that they are located on microchromosomes lacking other
markers, or alternatively the genetic distance to neighboring markers was too far to be detected in the linkage analysis.
By calculating the distance between the first and last
marker for each linkage group, we have physical coverage
over 890.3 Mb corresponding to approximately 93% of
the autosomal chicken genome assembly (May, 2006).
Standard QTL analysis
Descriptive statistics for phenotypic traits analyzed in this
study are presented in Table 1. Below we present results
from standard genome-wide scans for marginal QTL
effects on body-weight traits in the F2 population.

All QTL with significant marginal effect on body-weight
traits are presented in Table 3. We found five QTL that
were significant at the 5% genome-wide level for at least
one body-weight trait and an additional two QTL that
showed suggestive evidence for a QTL effect. The designation of these loci follows our previously described nomenclature (Growth1-13) given that they mapped to
approximately the same genomic position [2].
Three QTL regions influenced early growth (0–14 days)
whereas four regions appeared to primarily affect later
growth (14–70 days). For all QTL the allele originating
from the HWS line increased growth. Each individual QTL
explained only a small portion of the residual phenotypic
variation in the F2 population, ranging from 1.5 – 4.4%
(Table 3).
We detected a QTL influencing growth between 0 – 14
days and body-weight at 14 days of age with a QTL peak
at 470 cM at chromosome 1. This QTL was not detected in
our previous analysis and may represent a novel QTL.
However, because it occurs in the vicinity of Growth1 we
cannot exclude the possibility that it represents the same

(Table 3).
Figure 1 visualizes the difference between the current QTL
analysis and a QTL analysis performed for body-weight at
56 days of age using only microsatellite markers; the two
maps have been aligned in order to provide a way to compare marker coverage and the results from the two QTL
analyses. The overall agreement of the results from the
two scans is excellent. We found a suggestive QTL on chromosome 1 (Growth1 interval) for body-weight at 56 days
with the new map that was not detected with the old map
due to the poor map coverage in the interval. No other

chromosomal region lacking markers in the old map
showed significant QTL effects. The localization of the
major QTL on chromosome 7 is now much more precisely
defined after we have added more markers on this chromosome (Figure 1).
Detection of epistatic interactions
We performed a genome-wide search for epistatic interactions, using the updated linkage map, by fitting a regression model including two-locus interactions [20]. An
overview of all detected pair-wise interactions is presented
in Figure 2. We analyzed ten growth traits (Table 1) and
identified 19 QTL pairs where the interactions were signif-

icant at the 1% level and six additional pairs that were significant at the 5% level. The 25 detected pair-wise
interactions, correspond to 15 unique pairs and seven
pairs affected more than one growth trait. Nine of the 15
unique epistatic pairs involved interaction with the major
QTL on chromosome 7 (Growth9). The genotype-phenotype map relationship for each pair was visualized by plotting mean values for each two-locus QTL genotype in a
line graph (Figure 3; Additional File 2). As expected, the
QTL pairs that affected multiple growth traits showed similar genotype-phenotype relationships across traits. There
are some discrepancies between results from the current
and previous epistatic analysis [4], when considering only
body-weight at 56 days which was the age at selection.
Originally, six genome-wide significant interacting loci
were reported on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 20. The
loci on chromosome 1, 4, 7 and 20 are still genome-wide
significant in this analysis, though the loci detected on
chromosome 2 and 3 are no longer significant using the
new map. On the other hand, two new loci located in a

previously uncovered part of chromosome 3 as well as a
locus on chromosome 24 now reach significance above
the threshold level. The genetic effects of the locus on
chromosome 3 is, however, still highly dependent on the
genetic background on chromosome 7, which makes us
confident that this locus is still an important contributor
to trait expression despite no longer reaching the stringent
significance threshold in a genome-wide scan for epistasis.
In a combined analysis we studied the effect of Growth4,
Growth6 and Growth12 conditional on the Growth9 background because it constitutes the major interaction network detected in this study (Figure 4). The results showed
that increasing homozygosity for the HWS line allele (H/
H) at Growth4, Growth6 and Growth12 had no phenotypic
effect in a Growth9 H/L or L/L background. In contrast,
chickens homozygous H/H at all three loci were 314
grams heavier than those homozygous L/L at all three loci,
when the genetic background at the Growth9 locus was H/

H. This demonstrates the strong epistatic interaction
among these loci. An analysis including all five loci that
interacted with Growth9, would have been desirable, however that would require a larger sample size than the ~800
F2 individuals we studied.
Detection of selective sweeps using a dense SNP screen
We searched for potential selective sweeps by screening 15
birds from each line using a SNP panel comprising about
13,000 loci evenly distributed throughout the genome.
Two birds from the LWS line were excluded from the analysis as results from a phylogenetic analysis indicated that
there had been a sample mix up. We then calculated Fst
and homozygosity values to identify the regions showing
the most pronounced divergence between lines.

From the 13,000 SNP markers that were genotyped ~90%
(11,275) provided reliable genotype calls (>95% call rate)
and 42% of those (4,777 SNPs) showed allelic variation

within or between the two lines. The average distance
between polymorphic markers was 210 kb. A total of
1,917 SNPs segregated within both lines whereas 1,393
and 1,328 SNPs segregated only in the LWS or the HWS
line respectively. Fixation of different alleles between lines
was observed for 139 SNPs. The allele frequency changes
observed show that considerable within-line fixation
occurred during the course of the selection experiment.
This is because both lines are derived from a common
founder population in which all 4,777 SNPs must have
been segregating. To test whether the distribution of the
fixed SNPs deviates from a random distribution we computed the distances between consecutive markers in sets of
139 randomly chosen SNPs (10,000 times) and compared
the random distribution to the observed one. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the observed distribution deviates from the random distribution (P = 6 × 10-13).
Hence, the distribution of fixed markers was clearly nonrandom across the genome as several clusters of fixed loci

were detected. There were 36 clusters including two or
more SNPs separated by less than 1 Mb between subsequent fixed SNPs and only 23 of the 139 SNPs were not
closely linked to another fixed SNP. The QTL regions for
body-weight at 56 days of age (Table 4) were two-fold
enriched for SNPs as these regions constituted about 5%
of the chicken genome (~50 Mb) but contained 10% of
the fixed SNPs.
We calculated Fst-values for each marker located in QTL
intervals for body-weight at 56 days of age and compared
the mean Fst to the average genome-wide Fst-values. The
QTL regions were here defined by their confidence intervals calculated by the one-LOD drop method [17]. The
results are presented in Table 4 together with observed
homozygosity estimates. Only minor differences were
found between the average Fst-values in QTL intervals and
the genome average. This suggests that the size of the haplotype blocks associated with a causative QTL mutation
are small compared to the size of the QTL confidence
intervals obtained in our F2 segregation analysis. However, the confidence interval for Growth1 on chromosome
1 showed a markedly higher divergence between lines and
near homozygosity within the LWS line (Table 4). This
result suggests that a selective sweep has occurred in the
LWS line. The interval showing near fixation within the
LWS line is 3.5 Mb in size and spans from 173.4 Mb to
176.9 Mb.

Discussion
The results of the present study are consistent with the
major conclusions obtained in our previous QTL analysis
of this large intercross pedigree based on a less complete
linkage map [2-4]. Despite the large phenotypic differences between the High-Weight and Low-Weight selected
lines we were not able to detect any major QTL with a
large marginal effect. Only five loci, Growth1, 4, 6, 9 and
10, reached genome-wide significance for at least one
body-weight or growth trait and none explained more
than 4.4% of the residual variance for a growth-related
trait (Table 3). However, the importance of epistatic interaction as a mechanism contributing significantly to the
remarkable response to selection was further strengthened
because additional pairs of interacting loci were detected
in the present study. We are currently using an Advance
Intercross Line (AIL) to replicate and further explore interactions among these loci.
The HWS and LWS lines originated from the same base
population that was formed by crossing seven partially
inbred lines of White Plymouth Rock broiler chickens [1].
That the results of the QTL analysis infer that no QTL with
large individual effects segregated in the base population
is consistent with the steady selection response in both
directions that have been obtained during the 40 genera-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/248

tions of divergent selection [1,2]. This pattern is also consistent with a rather slow change in allele frequencies at
QTL during the course of selection or a gradual release of
selectable additive genetic variation from the epistatic loci
[21].
The remarkable response to the divergent selection for
juvenile body-weight in the HWS and LWS lines must
reflect allele frequency changes between lines at those loci
that have responded to selection. The chromosomal
regions harboring such loci are expected to show reduced
variation within lines and also a higher divergence
between lines. Such selective sweeps are caused by hitchhiking of closely linked loci during selection [22]. The size
of a selective sweep depends on the number of generations that have passed since the QTL mutation occurred
and the local recombination rate in the region. Thus, a
recently derived mutation will be associated with a large
haplotype block whereas an old mutation that well predates the initiation of the selection experiment is expected
to be associated with a smaller haplotype block.
The outcome of the analysis of Fst and homozygosities
based on the screening of 13,000 SNPs in the HWS and
LWS lines are consistent with the results of the QTL analysis and the observed selection response. We found only
minor differences in the average homozygosity as well as
average Fst values within QTL intervals compared with the
genome average (Table 4). The result suggests that selection has primarily been acting on standing genetic variation that existed well before the initiation of the selection
experiment, which is supported by results of a recent simulation study exploring the potential role of epistatic
interactions in response to directional selection [21]. The
causal mutation will occur in many haplotype combinations if it has been transmitted through a large number of
meiotic events before it reaches a high allele frequency in
the selected population and as a consequence the selective
sweep will be short and not detected by an Fst analysis
based on the rather sparse marker set used in this study
(~1 polymorphic SNP/200 kb). The results suggest that
the release of genetic variance due to epistatic interaction
[4] is a more likely explanation for the long-term selection
response in these lines rather than the occurrence of new
mutations during the course of selection [23].
An indication of a selective sweep was, however, observed
for Growth1 on chromosome 1 where there was a higher
Fst value between lines than the genome average. The confidence interval for Growth1 was smaller than for the other
growth QTL which facilitated the detection of footprints
of selection. The homozygosity in this QTL interval for the
HWS line was close to the genome average whereas the
region showed almost complete fixation in the LWS line.
The pattern suggests that while this locus has contributed

Page 11 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:248

to the selection for low growth in the LWS line it may have
been selectively neutral in HWS line. The causal mutation(s) for this QTL is expected to be located within this
region of high homozygosity. The region with near
homozygosity in the LWS line spans from position 173.4
to 176.9 Mb on chicken chromosome 1, a region still too
large and containing too many genes to pin-point strong
positional candidate genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/248

QTL effects and at each locus the allele from the HWS line
is increasing growth as expected from the line differences
in growth. In contrast, for Growth10, 11 and 13 there was
only a minor difference in statistical significance between
the two models and in these cases it is more likely that the
previous suggestive evidence for QTL at these positions in
fact were false positives.

Conclusion
To be an exhaustive search for QTLs, a genome scan
should be based on a marker set that covers the entire
genome. The map used in the current study covered 93%
of the assembled chicken genome a clear improvement to
the ~80% coverage achieved with our previous microsatellite-based map. In particular, we have added markers on
six microchromosomes that previously lacked markers.
There are, however, still seven microchromosomes lacking markers in the current map. This is because they are
missing in the genome assembly and no markers from
these chromosomes have yet been reported. These missing microchromosomes are all small, on the order of five
Mb or less but are expected to have a higher gene density
than the macrochromosomes [24]. It is apparent that
parts of the chicken genome, including some microchromosomes, are difficult to clone in bacterial vectors [24,25]
and this is the reason why they are missing from the current genome assembly. Hopefully, the use of new
sequencing technologies that do not require vector-based
cloning will allow us to fill the holes in the current
chicken genome assembly to eventually making a complete genome scan feasible.
If we compare our current QTL analysis based on an
improved linkage map with our previous QTL analysis [2]
there are as many as six previously reported loci (Growth2,
Growth3, Growth8, Growth10, Growth11 and Growth13)
that did not reach statistical significance in the present
study. Our previous analysis included family as a fixed
effect in the regression model whereas we decided to not
include family as a fixed effect in the statistical model used
in the present study. To test whether the new information
provided by the improved linkage map or the change in
regression model caused this discrepancy we reran the
analysis including family as a fixed effect for those growth
loci that we could not replicate. With a QTL model including Family as a fixed effect, the F-value associated with
Growth2 increased from 5.4 to 6.3 and therefore reached
the suggestive significance threshold. For Growth3, the Fvalue increased from 4.5 to 6.0 with family effect in the
model. A more dramatic increase in significance was
observed for Growth8 since the F-value increased from not
reaching even the suggestive threshold to become
genome-wide significant with an F-value of 9.3 when the
Family effect was included in the model. It is very likely
that these three loci (Growth2, 3 and 8) represents true

The eight-fold difference in body-weight at selection age
between two divergently selected chicken lines is determined by many QTL each with a small individual effect.
Although no major QTL explaining a large proportion of
the residual phenotypic variance was found, a network of
interacting loci with a large effect was identified using the
current extended linkage map. Furthermore, results from
the QTL study was consistent with our analysis of Fst and
homozygosity using a marker set including ~13,000 SNP
markers. The results from that analysis failed to detect any
major selective sweeps within QTL region suggesting that
selection has been acting on standing genetic variation
present in the founder population rather than recently
derived mutations.
