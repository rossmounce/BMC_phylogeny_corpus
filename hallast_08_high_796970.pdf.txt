Abstract
Background: Low nucleotide divergence between human and chimpanzee does not sufficiently
explain the species-specific morphological, physiological and behavioral traits. As gene duplication
is a major prerequisite for the emergence of new genes and novel biological processes, comparative
studies of human and chimpanzee duplicated genes may assist in understanding the mechanisms
behind primate evolution. We addressed the divergence between human and chimpanzee
duplicated genomic regions by using Luteinizing Hormone Beta (LHB)/Chorionic Gonadotropin
Beta (CGB) gene cluster as a model. The placental CGB genes that are essential for implantation have
evolved from an ancestral pituitary LHB gene by duplications in the primate lineage.
Results: We shotgun sequenced and compared the human (45,165 bp) and chimpanzee (39,876
bp) LHB/CGB regions and hereby present evidence for structural variation resulting in discordant
number of CGB genes (6 in human, 5 in chimpanzee). The scenario of species-specific parallel
duplications was supported (i) as the most parsimonious solution requiring the least rearrangement
events to explain the interspecies structural differences; (ii) by the phylogenetic trees constructed
with fragments of intergenic regions; (iii) by the sequence similarity calculations. Across the
orthologous regions of LHB/CGB cluster, substitutions and indels contributed approximately equally
to the interspecies divergence and the distribution of nucleotide identity was correlated with the
regional repeat content. Intraspecies gene conversion may have shaped the LHB/CGB gene cluster.
The substitution divergence (1.8–2.59%) exceeded two-three fold the estimates for single-copy loci
and the fraction of transversional mutations was increased compared to the unique sequences (43%
versus ~30%). Despite the high sequence identity among LHB/CGB genes, there are signs of
functional differentiation among the gene copies. Estimates for dn/ds rate ratio suggested a purifying
selection on LHB and CGB8, and a positive evolution of CGB1.
Conclusion: If generalized, our data suggests that in addition to species-specific deletions and
duplications, parallel duplication events may have contributed to genetic differences separating
humans from their closest relatives. Compared to unique genomic segments, duplicated regions are
characterized by high divergence promoted by intraspecies gene conversion and species-specific
chromosomal rearrangements, including the alterations in gene copy number.

Background
Gene duplication has long been considered as one of the
main mechanisms of the adaptive evolution and as an
important source of the genetic novelty [1]. Differential
duplications and deletions of chromosomal regions
including coding genes provide a powerful source for the
evolution of species-specific biological differences [2].
Compared to other mammals, the genomes of primates
show an enrichment of large segmental duplications with
high levels (>90%) of sequence identity [3]. In the human
genome particularly pronounced expansions of the copy
number have been reported for genes involved in the
structure and function of the brain [4]. In comparison of
human and its closest relative chimpanzee, large duplications contribute considerably (2.7%; [5]) to the overall
divergence compared to single base pair substitutions
(1.2–1.5%; [2,6-12]). In addition to providing the substrate for non-allelic homologous recombination mediating genomic disorders (reviewed by [13]), the duplication
architecture of a genome may also influence normal phenotypic variation. It has been estimated that ~20% of segmental duplications are polymorphic within human and
chimpanzee populations contributing to intraspecies
diversity [5,14]. Despite the fact that segmental duplications cover a substantial fraction of the great apes
genomes, the experimental data on the divergence and
detailed evolutionary dynamics of duplicated gene
regions is still limited. Sequence comparison of duplicated genes in sister-species would assist in understanding
the mechanisms behind primate evolution and in associating the genetic divergence with phenotypic diversification.
One of the genomic regions that has evolved through several gene duplication events in primate lineage is the
Luteinizing Hormone Beta (LHB)/Chorionic Gonadotropin Beta (CGB) gene cluster locating in human at
19q13.32. The LHB/CGB genes have an essential role in
reproduction: placentally expressed HCG hormone contributes to the implantation process of the embryo during
the early stages of pregnancy, pituitary expressed luteinizing hormone promotes the ovulation and luteinization of
follicles and stimulates the steroidogenesis. In human, the
cluster consists of seven highly homologous genes: an
ancestral LHB and six duplicated CGB genes [15]. The data
from other primates supports the hypothesis of several
sequential duplication events increasing gradually the
number of CGB genes among primates from one (New
World monkeys: the owl monkey, Aotus trivirgatus and the
dusky titi monkey, Callicebus moloch) to six in human (Figure 1A). The mapped copy number of the CGB gene
among Old World monkeys varies: three in rhesus
macaque (Macaca mulatta), five in guereza monkey (Colobus guereza) and dusky leaf monkey (Presbytis obscura),
four in orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) [16]. It has been sug-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/195

gested that CGB gene first arose in the common ancestor
of the anthropoid primates after diverging from tarsiers
[16].
We have chosen LHB/CGB genomic region as a model to
study the evolution of recent primate duplications.
Although the chimpanzee genome has been sequenced,
there are still large gaps and uncertainties concerning the
segmental duplications regions, including the LHB/CGB
region. To obtain a high-quality DNA sequence, we constructed and sequenced a shot-gun library, and hereby
report the complete sequence of the entire LHB/CGB cluster in the common chimpanzee. We are addressing the following aspects regarding to the evolution of duplicated
genes in closely related species: (i) in-depth comparison
of the human and chimpanzee LHB/CGB genome clusters;
(ii) variation in substitution rates; (iii) genic and intergenic divergences; (iv) impact of intraspecies gene conversion in phylogeny, divergence and transversion/transition
ratios; (v) evidence of natural selection. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of parallel independent duplication events initiated within a duplicated
genome cluster and leading to structural divergence in the
two sister-species, human and common chimpanzee.

Results and Discussion
Human and chimpanzee LHB/CGB genome clusters differ
considerably in size
The total length of the sequenced chimpanzee (Ch) LHB/
CGB genomic region obtained from two overlapping BAC
clones was 43,945 bp. It encompasses 1,029 bp of the
flanking (centromeric side) RUVBL2 gene, 39,876 bp of
the entire LHB/CGB cluster and 2,986 bp of the flanking
(telomeric side) NTF5 gene (Figure 1B; Genbank submission: EU000308). Compared to the human (Hu) LHB/
CGB region (Genbank: NG_000019), the sequence of the
ChLHB/CGB cluster is 5,289 bp shorter. The sequence
characteristics of the LHB/CGB genomic regions are similar in these two species: extremely high GC-nucleotide
content (57% compared to average 41% for Hu and Ch
[10]), high fraction of CpG islands (Hu 6.6%, Ch 6.1%
compared to estimated 1–3.5% for Hu and Ch [6,8]) and
repetitive sequences (Hu 26.9%, Ch 25.15%), especially
SINEs (Hu 23.23%, Ch 21.81%) (Additional file 1). High
repeat content is also characteristic to several other duplicated regions, such as MHC class I region [7] and Apolipoprotein CI genomic segment [17].

As expected, there is a considerable similarity between the
genomic organization of human and chimpanzee LHB/
CGB clusters (Figure 1B). We identified two highly identical, apparently orthologous segments within the cluster:
RUVBL2/LHB/intergenic region A (Ch 8,084 bp, Hu 7,973
bp; 96% sequence identity) and the region spanning from
CGB1 to NTF5 (Ch 29,136 bp, Hu 28,568 bp; 94.8%

sequence identity). However, a large species-specific structural rearrangement was localized between the intergenic
region A and CGB1 gene, resulting in discordant size of
human (45,165 bp) and chimpanzee (39,876 bp) clusters
as well as species-specific number of duplicated gene copies, seven for human (1 LHB + 6 CGB genes) and six (1
LHB + 5 CGB) for chimpanzee. In human the rearranged
region (12,700 bp) harbors one HCG beta coding CGB
gene and one CGB1/2-like gene (CGB2) recognized by a
specific promoter-segment [18,19], while in chimp (rearranged region 6,725 bp) only a CGB1/2-like gene
(CGB1B) is present in an inverted orientation compared
to human. In addition, ChLHB/CGB cluster lacks the
whole intergenic region C' and has a considerably shorter
inverted intergenic region B' (Figure 1B).
Evidence for independent duplication events within LHB/
CGB gene cluster for two closely related primate species
We considered alternative scenarios that may have led to
structural differences in LHB/CGB clusters in two sisterspecies. The scenario of species-specific parallel duplica-

tions was supported by several lines of evidence (Figure
1B, Figure 2). First, it was the most parsimonious solution
requiring the smallest number of rearrangement events.
Assuming that the ancestral Hu-ChLHB/CGB cluster consisted of the present-day highly identical segments (Figure
1B; see above), only one evolutionary event would
explain the current structure of ChLHB/CGB cluster – a
direct duplication of CGB1 and most of intergenic region B
(excluding psNTF6G') giving arise to the segment CGB1B/
Ch-B'. In humans, two events would have lead to present
HuLHB/CGB (not in order) – an inverted duplication of
the entire region from CGB1 to CGB5 gene (segment from
CGB to CGB2) and a direct duplication and translocation
of region C creating C' next to CGB1 gene (Figure 1B).
These parallel duplications in two sister-species might
have been initiated by non-allelic homologous recombinations between multiple Alu SINE sequences (AluSx,
AluSp, AluSq) locating at the junctions of both humanand chimp-specific duplications. Consistently, the phylogenetic trees that were constructed using different fragments of intergenic regions show that Ch-B and Ch-B', Hu-

B and Hu-B' as well as Hu-C and Hu-C' clearly cluster
together supporting their paralogous status (Figure 2B–F).
The Hu-D and Ch-D region form a well-supported clade
(Figure 2B–D, G) giving evidence that these are orthologous segments. The phylogenetic relationship supports
the ancestral status of region C (present in both species)
compared to Hu-C' (human-specific duplication). Also
the sequence similarity calculations are consistent with
the scenario of independent species-specific duplications:
the identity of Ch-B and Ch-B' regions is 98.1%, and of
ChCGB1 and ChCGB1B 98.7%. The latter exceeds the estimates for any orthologous genes between human and
chimp in LHB/CGB cluster (from 98.2% in LHB to 97.4%
in CGB5 and CGB8). However, the possibility of more
intensive gene conversion between these intergenic segments resulting in higher intraspecies similarity cannot be
excluded. It is well known that past intraspecies gene conversion events might be reflected by tree phylogenies and
could lead to erroneous conclusions [16,20]. The footprint of gene conversion is also reflected on the phylogenic tree of human and chimpanzee LHB/CGB genes
(Figure 2A). Instead of two separate clades for orthologous CGB5 and CGB8, the genes within one species cluster
together.

arisen functionally close genes within the Growth Hormone/Somatomammotropin genome cluster in New World
monkeys and Old World monkeys/hominoid lineages
[20,25].

Alternative scenarios leading to discordant gene number
in LHB/CGB gene clusters in these two species are less supported. A minimum of three rearrangement events (Figure
1B) would have been required for the chimpanzee-specific deletion: loss of CGB and psNTF6A gene accompanied with the inversion of CGB2 and intergenic region B'
(giving rise to CGB1B and chimp B'), and a separate deletion of region C' in chimp. Also the scenario of humanspecific duplication (Figure 1B) would have required at
least three events: an inversion of CGB1B and intergenic
region Ch-B' (giving rise to part of Hu-B' and CGB2); either
a direct duplication and translocation of CGB8 gene along
with psNTF6A' or an inverted duplication and translocation of CGB5 along with psNTF6G' (resulting in CGB and
psNTF6A), and a direct duplication and translocation of
intergenic region C creating Hu-C' next to CGB1 gene.

Comparative nucleotide divergence profiling of the
orthologous regions reveals non-uniform substitution rates
across the LHB/CGB region
We generated a comparative nucleotide divergence profile
of substitutions and indels across the orthologous
genomic regions of LHB/CGB cluster (Figure 1B, Figure 3).
Human (36,541 bp) and chimpanzee (37,220 bp)
aligned genomic sequences were analyzed using a nonoverlapping sliding window of 500 bp. Several studies
have suggested that the majority of the genomic divergence between human and chimpanzee comprises of
indels (3.0–11.9%) compared to contribution of nucleotide substitutions (1.2–1.5%) [2,6-11,26]. In the duplicated LHB/CGB region indels (2.7%) and substitutions
(2.3%) contributed approximately equally to the total
divergence (5%) between the two species. In total, 61
indels (mean 16; range 1–637 bp) were identified, 26 as
human and 35 as chimpanzee deletions. The size distribution of these indels was consistent with previous reports
[2,6,9-11] revealing an excess of short indels: 44%
involved a single basepair, 77% 1–5 bp and 96.7% <100
bp (Additional files 1 and 2). Two large indels of >100 bp
co-locate with repetitive elements: the 128 bp long indel
in intergenic region A is located in a simple-repeat rich
region; the 637 bp indel in intergenic region B is flanked
and composed of SINE sequences (Figure 1B, Figure 3).
The latter indel could be defined as a recent human-specific sequence loss since the duplicated human-specific
intergenic region B' lacks this deletion. High proportion
(>50%) of indels identified between human and chimpanzee has been shown to contain repetitive elements
[6,7]. The regional content of repeats was also correlated
with the non-uniform distribution of the nucleotide identity across the cluster (Figure 3; Additional file 1) consistent with the data that repetitive sequences, e.g. Alu repeats
have a higher rate of base substitutions [27].

A number of gene families have been characterized where
the gene number differs between human and chimpanzee
due to species-specific indels [7,21]. To our knowledge,
this is the first report where parallel independent duplications arisen within the same region in human and chimpanzee genomes give the best explanation for the
observed structural differences between two sister-species.
However, there are examples of independent duplications
among primates resulting in convergent functions. A
more recent duplication of X-linked opsin gene in New
World howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus and Alouatta
caraya) compared to Old World primates, has lead to full
trichromacy [22-24] and also there are independently

Transition to transversion ratio in duplicated regions
differs from the estimations for unique genomic sequences:
possible role of gene conversion
We investigated the distribution of nucleotide substitutions within orthologous regions of LHB/CGB cluster in
more detail (Figure 4). Transitions (C⇔T, A⇔G) and
transversions (T, C⇔A, G) were found to contribute 62%
and 38% of the total substitutions in five orthologous
LHB/CGB genes, respectively (Figure 4A). The corresponding estimates for the whole orthologous region (including
genes) were 57% for transitions and 43% for transversions (Figure 4B). Notably, the contribution of transitions
is ~10% lower than reported in previous studies compar-

Divergence profile between orthologous regions of the human and the chimpanzee LHB/CGB clusters
Divergence profile between orthologous regions of the human and the chimpanzee LHB/CGB clusters. In total
the compared region covered 37,220 bp (Ch)/36,541 (Hu), including 8,084 bp (Ch)/7,973 bp (Hu) from RUVBL2 gene to the
end of intergenic region A and 29,136 bp (Ch)/28,568 bp (Hu) from CGB1 to NTF5 gene. The species-specific large duplications
(human 12,700 bp, chimp 6,725 bp) have been excluded from the comparison. The percents of nucleotide substitutions and
indels are calculated per 500 bp non-overlapping windows. Grey arrows indicate the locations of coding genes drawn to an

ing human and chimpanzee genomic regions (68.87% –
70.3%) [7,8]. The most frequent transversions are G⇔C
substitutions, contributing 16% of all substitutions in
genes and 18% across entire orthologous region, exceeding previous estimations by twofold (9.14%, 9%) [7,8].
Consistently, a large excess of G⇔C transversional pairs as
compared to other substitutions has been reported for
human HSP70 and mouse Hsp70 orthologous duplicate
genes [28]. The high proportion of transversions in the
LHB/CGB cluster can be explained by biased gene conversion [29] that leads to a high GC content (57% in human
and chimp LHB/CGB region) and thus increases the probability of G⇔C substitutions due to the altered base composition [28,30,31].
Among the transitions, we observed an excess of C⇔T
substitutions in LHB/CGB genes (38%) versus the whole
region (28%). It is generally accepted that a high proportion of transitions are C to T substitutions in CpG dinucleotides, exhibiting about 10 times higher mutation rate
than the genomic average [9,32]. A higher GC content
(64% vs 57%) and presence of CpG islands could explain

an excess of C⇔T substitutions in LHB/CGB genes compared to intergenic regions.
Sequence divergence between human and chimpanzee
duplicated LHB/CGB genes is higher than estimates for
single copy genes
We studied the human and the chimpanzee orthologous
genes LHB, CGB1, CGB5, CGB8 and CGB7 for nucleotide
divergence. The nucleotide divergence ranged from 1.8%
for LHB to 2.59% for CGB5 and CGB8 genomic sequences
(Figure 5; Additional file 3). Despite that the coding
regions are most conserved among the species, the exonic
divergence rates (mean 1.39%; range 1 – 1.88%) exceeded
many times the previous estimates for single-copy regions
[8-10,12,26,33]. In non-coding regions, the average
nucleotide divergence for promoter regions was as high as
3.22% (range 1 – 5.1%), for introns 2.62% (range 2.04 –
3.24%) and for 5' UTR 2.54% (range 0 – 3.83%). The
comparative estimates for single-copy genes are much
lower: in promoters 0.75–0.88%, in exons 0.51–1.09%,
in introns 1.03–1.47% and in 5' UTR 1.00–1.41% [1012,26,33-36]. It has been suggested that interaction of

selection and gene conversion contributes to a higher
divergence and diversity in multigene families compared
to single-copy genes [37,38]. As any de novo mutation has
a potential to be spread by gene conversion from the original locus to other gene copies, every duplicate could accumulate substitutions arisen in neighboring genes.
Notably, when the polymorphism data from re-sequencing studies of the human (n = 95 individuals) [29] and the
chimpanzee (n = 11 individuals) [Hallast et al, unpublished] LHB/CGB genes were incorporated into calculations, the sequence divergence in genes dropped from
1.8% to 1.26% in LHB, from 2.59% to 1.84% in CGB5,
from 2.59% to 1.9% in CGB8 and from 2.18% to 1.57%
in CGB7 (Figure 5; Additional file 3). Still, a higher divergence compared to the published data for single-copy
genes remained.
Most importantly, our data indicates that the divergence
estimates between human and chimpanzee might be substantially lower than reported when the intraspecies variation is taken into account.

Duplicated, highly homologous LHB/CGB genes evolve
under different selective constraints
A number of non-synonymous changes were identified in
human-chimpanzee comparison: two in LHB, two in
CGB8, three in CGB5 and CGB7 and four in CGB1 (Additional file 3). None of the differences found in exonic
regions in chimp altered the ORF nor created a preliminary stop-codon compared to human genes. The maximum likelihood (ML) method was used to estimate ω,
non-synonymous (dn)/synonymous (ds) rate ratio for the
orthologous genes (n = 5) in the human and chimpanzee
LHB/CGB gene cluster (Table 1) [39]. For four of the compared genes (LHB, CGB5, CGB8, CGB7) the parameter
was ω < 1, indicating purifying selection. An especially
low ω estimate was obtained for LHB (ω = 0.087; 6 synonymous, 2 non-synonymous changes; amino acid divergence 1.42%) and CGB8 (ω = 0.099; 5 synonymous, 2
non-synonymous changes; amino acid divergence
1.21%). Consistently, the dn/dsratio calculated by an
alternative Li93 method [40,41] was statistically significant (dn/ds = 0.146; p = 0.049 two-tailed Z-test [42]) for
LHB and reached borderline significance for the CGB8
(dn/ds = 0.162; p = 0.078) (Additional file 4). Indeed, the
LHB gene is highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution in association with its function – it is coding for the
receptor-binding beta subunit of luteinizing hormone
(LH) critical for successful reproduction [15]. The functional constraint of the human CGB8 may be associated
with its major role in contributing to the HCG beta subunit mRNA transcript pool compared to other CGB genes
[43].

CGB1 gene (ω = 2.658, 1 synonymous, 4 non-synonymous changes; amino acid divergence 3.03%) stood out
as the only locus in the gene cluster with estimated ω >1,
which would be consistent with positive or adaptive evolution. It has been suggested that CGB1 has arisen in the
common ancestor of African great apes through a duplication event accompanied by an insertion of a novel putative promoter, 5'UTR and exon 1. So far, the detection of
CGB1 gene has been unsuccessful in orangutan Pongo pygmaeus by using the PCR approach [44] and in macaque
Macaca mulatta (Genbank: AC202849) by in silico search
of the current genome assembly. It has been shown that in
human the contributions of CGB1 and its duplicate
human-specific CGB2 to the summarized expression of
the six CGB genes in placenta is much lower (1/1000 to 1/
10000) compared to their gene dosage (two genes out of
six total) [43,45]. However, in testis the proportional contribution of CGB1/2 to the total CGB transcript pool is as
high as 1/3 [45], which may indicate a possible role of
these genes in male reproductive tract. Indeed, a recent
study has shown that HCG alpha and HCG beta free subunits are produced in high amounts in the prostate and

used CRANN analysis calculating dn and ds values for sliding and overlapping windows along individual genes
(Additional file 5) [47,48]. In case of HCG beta subunit
coding genes (CGB5, CGB8 and CGB7), the patterns of
nucleotide differences between the sister species were similar – across the protein the synonymous substitutions
exceeded the non-synonymous ones and were concentrated in the N- and C-terminus of the protein. In contrast,
in CGB1 the non-synonymous substitutions dominated
and were distributed in the signal peptide (amino acids 1–
20) and the centre of the protein.
Impact of gene duplications in primate divergence
Primate-specific gene duplications have involved loci regulating immunity (e.g. MHC, beta-defensin, CD33rSiglec
gene clusters), reproduction (e.g. LHB/CGB, GH/CSH,
PRAME genes; Y-chromosomal gene families), development
and adaptation (e.g. Beta Globin, Opsin, Rh blood group,
Class 1 ADH, PRDM and FAM90A gene families), and

brain functions (e.g. NAIP, ROCK1, USP10 and MGC8902
genes) [4,16,20,22,49-59]. It has been suggested that
these duplication events may have been facilitated by
non-allelic homologous recombination between Alu
sequences, expanded into millions of copies all over primate genomes [54,60]. There are several examples of
independent duplication events in the New World monkey (NWM) and Old World monkey (OWM)/hominoid
lineages as well as in distinct primate species. For example, the OWM and apes have three Opsin genes and are trichromats due to gene duplication at the base of the OWM
lineage. In NWM, the situation is more variable: most species exhibit two Opsin genes, but in the howler monkey an
additional gene duplication has led to full trichromacy
[23,24]. In Growth Hormone gene cluster (five to eight gene
copies) some of the duplicate genes in the OWM/hominoid lineages have acquired a novel function and code for
Chorionic Somatomammotropin (CSH genes) involved
in the glucose metabolism of the fetus and the mother.
However, the CSH genes are missing from the genomes of
NW monkeys [61]. Further species-specific duplications
of GH/CSH genes have been reported for gibbon,
macaque, chimpanzee and human [62,63]. In humanchimpanzee comparison, only three GH/CSH genes are
clearly orthologous [21]. Other gene clusters with independent gene duplications in human, apes and macaque
lineages are MHC and testes-expressed PRAME genes
[53,64]. The ancestral MHC-B duplicated into MHC-B and
MHC-C in hominoids. While human MHC-C orthologs
are found in African apes and orangutans, they are not
present in macaque or any other OW monkeys [65,66].
Species-specific evolutionary scenarios have also been
reported for LHB/CGB genes [16]. In addition to the structural differences between human and chimpanzee LHB/
CGB genes reported in this study, an expansion of CGB
genes up to 50 gene copies has been shown in gorilla
(Gorilla gorilla) [4,49]. Despite the high number of structural differences that has been shown between human
and chimpanzee genomes by in silico whole-genome analysis (reviewed in [67]), the experimental data for copy
number differences between these sister-species has been
reported only for a few gene clusters (e.g. GH/CSH, LHB/
CGB, PRAME, MGC8902, CXYorf1, KGF, CD33rSiglec,
NANOG) [16,20,52,53,59,68-70].
In addition to creating structural divergence among the
species, duplications provide also the bases for diversification of gene functions. For primate-specific gene duplications, there is evidence of variability in evolutionary rates
among the gene copies within and among the species, and
of different selective constraints acting on different members of the gene clusters, such as MHC, beta-globin, GH/
CSH, PRAME, Rh blood group, CD33rSiglec and betadefensin genes [71-73]. For example, in human-chimpanzee comparison, the chimp MHC class I loci A, B and C are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/195

characterized by lower intra-species allelic variation compared to human, providing evidence that ancestral chimpanzee populations may have experienced a selective
sweep [74,75]. In marmoset LHB/CGB region, a switch of
functions has happened between the ancestral LHB and
the derived CGB gene. Although LHB and CGB genes are
both present at the genomic level, only CGB gene is
expressed in the pituitary and placenta tissues. Thus, Chorionic Gonadotropin Hormone is the only gonadotropin
carrying also the luteinizing function fulfilled by Luteinizing Hormone in mammals [76,77].
Duplicated genes tend to evolve in consort facilitated by
active inter-locus gene conversion increasing and preserving sequence similarity among the gene copies [37,38,78].
Concerted evolution within species may lead to erroneous
phylogenetic trees and to the overestimation of interspecies divergence dates [20,79,80]. Incorporation of gene
conversion data into the equations for calculating interspecies divergence may be still a challenge requiring
detailed knowledge of a particular genomic region.
So far, only a limited number of reports has been published that focus on detailed variation patterns of duplicated gene families in primates (MHC, Globin, GH/CSH
and LHB/CGB genes) [7,29,81-83]. However, the common observation is that compared to single-copy segments, duplicated regions tend to exhibit higher
interspecies diversity that could be explained by relaxed
selective pressures and/or gene conversions spreading
mutations. Thus, when calculating the divergence in
duplicated primate-specific regions, the inclusion or
exclusion of intraspecies variation data into equations
may have a substantial impact on the divergence estimates.

Conclusion
We compared the human and chimpanzee duplicated
LHB/CGB genome clusters and hereby present the
detailed evidence for parallel independent duplication
events in the two sister-species resulting in discordant
number of CGB genes (6 in human, 5 in chimpanzee). To
our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of parallel
duplications in these sister-species leading to structural
divergence. The evolutionary fate of duplicated genes is
shaped by the interaction of gene conversion and selection. In LHB/CGB gene cluster, active gene conversion
may have contributed to higher interspecies sequence
divergence (both genic and intergenic sequences) and
altered transition/transversion ratio compared to the single-copy loci. This higher divergence remained when
intraspecies variation was taken into account. However,
the drop in divergence estimates after incorporating the
intraspecies variation data promotes to reanalyze previously studied loci, where the human-chimpanzee diver-

gence may be substantially lower than initially calculated.
Despite the high sequence homology among LHB/CGB
genes (85–99%), there are signs of functional differentiation among the gene copies. To reconstruct the full evolutionary history of LHB/CGB gene cluster, further studies
are required comprising high-quality sequence data from
several primate species.

Methods
Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) screening and
shotgun library construction
BAC library of common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)
RPCI-43 was obtained from BACPAC Resource Center at
the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (Oakland, CA). In order to identify BAC clones containing
LHB/CGB genome cluster we used recommended protocols and performed hybridization screening with a PCRproduct containing LHB-specific sequence amplified from
chimpanzee genomic DNA. Probe DNA was labeled with
[32P]dCTP by random primer extension using DecaLabel™
DNA Labeling Kit (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania).
BAC DNA was isolated using NucleoBond® BAC 100 plasmid purification kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG,
Düren, Germany). Two overlapping BAC clones (68P2
and 109B10) containing LHB/CGB genome cluster were
sheared by nebulization to approximately 5 kb long fragments and used for shotgun library construction with
TOPO® Shotgun Subcloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to manufacturers' instructions.
DNA sequencing and data analysis
Plasmid DNA was purified with NucleoSpin®-Plasmid kit
(Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG) and sequenced on
ABI 3730 × l sequencer using BigDye® Terminator v3.1
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Plasmid ends were sequenced using M13F and M13R
primers, additional primers for primer walking were
designed with the web-based version of the Primer3 software [84]. Sequencing primers are available in Additional
file 6. LHB/CGB genome cluster from two chimpanzee
BAC clones were sequenced with an average redundancy
of 7×, which was sufficient for assembly. Sequences were
assembled using ContigExpress program from Vector NTI
Suite 9 (Invitrogen) and the chimpanzee sequence was
compared to human LHB/CGB genome cluster (GenBank:
NG_000019). The full Chimpanzee LHB/CGB cluster
sequence has been deposited to GenBank (accession
number EU000308). Sequence alignments were performed and homologies determined by the web-based
ClustalW [85] and Stretcher implemented in the EMBOSS
package [86]. The aligned sequences of the major transcripts of the chimp and human LHB/CGB genes are given
in Additional file 7. Substitution and indel divergences
were calculated as the percentage of the number of substitutions and the number of nucleotides in indels divided

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/195

with the total number of aligned nucleotides in the specific genomic region. Phylogenetic trees were constructed
by MEGA3.1 [87] using Kimura's two parameter model to
infer the neighbor-joining and the branch-and-bound
algorithms to find maximum parsimony trees with 1000
replications for bootstrapping.
For coding regions maximum likelihood method [39] was
used to estimate non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio
ω (= dn/ds) by CODEML implemented in PAML package
version 4 [88,89]. Codon frequencies were estimated
from the dataset using the F3 × 4 option, other settings
were as default. The simplest model M0 or one-ratio
model was used to estimate the ω (an average over all the
sites). As for CGB1 alternative reading frames have been
predicted and no functional protein has been characterized so far. We defined CGB1 mRNA sequence and subsequently the predicted reading frame as supported by the
published experimental data [18,90]. In parallel, the
number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dn) and synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (ds) were estimated using an alternative
method – the Li93 method [40,41]. The significance of
the difference between dn and ds was examined by a twotailed Z-test [42] using MEGA3.1. To address which segments of the genes are evolving more rapidly, we performed CRANN analysis [47,48] using sliding and
overlapping windows and for the results in visual documentation of rate heterogeneities of dn and ds, Window
size was set on 20 and shift size on 10 codons using the
Li93 method.
Repetitive elements were detected by the REPEATMASKER
program [91].
