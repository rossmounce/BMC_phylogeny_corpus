Evolution and functional divergence of the
anoctamin family of membrane proteins
Vladimir M Milenkovic1*, Marisa Brockmann1, Heidi Stöhr2, Bernhard HF Weber2, Olaf Strauss1

Abstract
Background: The anoctamin family of transmembrane proteins are found in all eukaryotes and consists of
10 members in vertebrates. Ano1 and ano2 were observed to have Ca2+ activated Cl- channel activity. Recent
findings however have revealed that ano6, and ano7 can also produce chloride currents, although with different
properties. In contrast, ano9 and ano10 suppress baseline Cl- conductance when co-expressed with ano1 thus
suggesting that different anoctamins can interfere with each other. In order to elucidate intrinsic functional
diversity, and underlying evolutionary mechanism among anoctamins, we performed comprehensive bioinformatics
analysis of anoctamin gene family.
Results: Our results show that anoctamin protein paralogs evolved from several gene duplication events followed
by functional divergence of vertebrate anoctamins. Most of the amino acid replacements responsible for the
functional divergence were fixed by adaptive evolution and this seem to be a common pattern in anoctamin gene
family evolution. Strong purifying selection and the loss of many gene duplication products indicate rigid
structure-function relationships among anoctamins.
Conclusions: Our study suggests that anoctamins have evolved by series of duplication events, and that they are
constrained by purifying selection. In addition we identified a number of protein domains, and amino acid residues
which contribute to predicted functional divergence. Hopefully, this work will facilitate future functional
characterization of the anoctamin membrane protein family.

Background
The anoctamin (ano, also known as TMEM16) proteins
represent a novel family of membrane proteins with 10
members (ano1-10) in mammals [1-11]. Some members
are over-expressed in various cancers and diseases [12-18].
Anoctamins are highly hydrophobic proteins with eight
transmembrane domains (TMD) and one re-entry loop
[19]. Anoctamin proteins have tissue-specific patterns of
expression [20,21]. Although electrophysiological and biochemical studies in both native and heterologous expression systems provided important clues to understanding
the function of anoctamin membrane proteins, the biological roles have been elucidated for only a few members of
this family [2-6,21-24]. Ano1 functions as a Ca2+-activated
Cl- channel in a broad range of tissues, and it can be activated by cell swelling [22]. Ano2 expression is confined to

the photoreceptor synaptic terminals in retina and
the olfactory sensory neurons where it functions as a
Ca2+-activated Cl- channel [3,4]. Ano6 and ano7 can also
induce Cl- conductance when over expressed in FRT cells
[21], although the function of these proteins is not clear.
However, it seems that not all anoctamin proteins operate
as Ca 2+ -activated Cl - channels, since ano9 and ano10
inhibited anion conductance produced by ano1 [21]. So
far no functional data exist for ano3 and ano4. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that anoctamin proteins descended
from common ancestor and that ano8 and ano10 form a
functional subfamily [20,25,26]. To gain more insight into
the phylogeny and molecular evolution of the anoctamin
gene family comprehensive bioinformatics study was
performed. This has also led us to predict the structural
and putative functional motifs, moreover a number of critical amino acid sites that may be of importance for the
functional divergence in the anoctamin protein family
have been identified.

Results and discussion
Origin and evolution of the anoctamin gene family

We first retrieved the available anoctamin sequences
from the currently sequenced genomes. Querying major
databases and unfinished genomes with the full-length
amino acid sequences from the ten human anoctamin
paralogues (ano1-10) identified 243 homologous proteins in vertebrates, urochordates, cephalochordates,
echinodermates and invertebrates (Additional file 1).
Incomplete and redundant sequences were discarded
and initial data set included 186 sequences. To explore
the phylogenetic relationship among anoctamin paralogues, we constructed an unrooted maximum-likelihood
(ML) phylogenetic tree according to the best fit model
(WAG+I+G) predicted using ProtTest program [27] for
the 186 anoctamin genes from 50 species (Figure 1).
While vertebrates have 10 paralogs, most other organisms contain three or four anoctamin family members.
Echinodermates (S. purpuratus) and the recently
sequenced Amphioxus genome, which represents the
best pre-duplicative set of the vertebrate genome [28]
contains only one copy of the anoctamin gene, strongly
suggesting that gene duplication events have occurred in
the lineage leading to the vertebrates. In each of the
urochordata genomes, Ciona inestinalis and Ciona
savigny, the closest relatives of the craniates, we identified three anoctamin sequences. Thus, gene duplication
of the anoctamin family appeared to have occurred very
early at the base of the chordates tree. The vertebrate
anoctamins form ten separate monophyletic groups,
indicating that the formation of the paralogous subfamilies occurred before the divergence of individual species
(Figure 1). The phylogenetic branches of anoctamins 8
and 10 separated considerably earlier in evolution than
other anoctamin subgroups. The high level of sequence
identity within a subfamily suggests evolutionarily conserved functions. Invertebrate genomes on the other
hand contain distinctly fewer anoctamin paralogs, and it
seems that their number increases with evolutionary
complexity. Different number of anoctamin paralogs in
invertebrates suggests complex evolutionary history.
Overall, the data indicate that both, large scale (genome
wide) and small-scale duplications contributed to the
evolution of the anoctamin subfamilies, which is in good
agreement with previous findings demonstrating that
large-scale gene duplications have occurred during chordate evolution [29-31].
Membrane topology of the vertebrate anoctamins

For the analysis of the membrane topology we focused
on vertebrate anoctamins. Multiple amino acid sequence
alignment of 166 vertebrate anoctamins (Additional file
1) was used to predict putative transmembrane domains

family. The phylogenetic tree constructed with the program PhyML
shows the evolutionary relationship of the anoctamin protein family.

arrows. Non-vertebrate anoctamins are depicted with red color. The

substitution.

(TMDs) and hydrophobic regions. Hydropathy plotting
of 166 anoctamins revealed eight transmembrane
domains including one re-entry loop (Figure 2). These
eight hydrophobic peaks are strongly conserved in the
vertebrate anoctamins suggesting membrane insertion of
all anoctamin family members, similar to anoctamin 1.
These results are in agreement with topological study of
ano7 [19].
Evolution of the protein domains in the anoctamin family

Anoctamin protein sequences were scanned for the presence of protein domains and functional sequence patterns with InterProScan and SMART servers (Figure 3).
All anoctamins have at least one consensus N-glycosylation site, located in the extracellular loop between
TMD7 and TMD8. Ano 2, 5 and 9 have a unique protein-protein interaction PDZ domains, although PDZ
domain sequence in ano 5 and ano 9 is conserved only
in mammals, and all anoctamins except ano 5 and ano 7
have at least one putative coiled-coil domain. A putative
cyclic nucleotide-monophosphate binding domain
(c-NMP) [32] which consists of a stretch of 60 amino
acids containing a-helix and conserved amino acid residues located between TMD 1 and 2, is present in all
anoctamins but ano 8 and 10 (Figure 3B). Thus, it

Page 3 of 9

appears that c-NMP binding domain evolved after splitting of ano 8 and 10 from the other anoctamin paralogs.
Analysis of functional divergence

Gene duplication provide a means to evolve novel biological functions and changes in protein functions may then
provide different evolutionary constraints on duplicated
genes. Functional divergence of a protein family can occur
after major evolutionary events such as gene duplication
or speciation. Some of them result in different evolutionary rates at certain amino acid residues, which is termed
type I functional divergence [33,34]. To estimate functional divergence in the vertebrate anoctamin family, we
have conducted pair-wise functional divergence analysis
between anoctamin paralogous genes using DIVERGE
[35]. Table 1 shows the coefficient of functional divergence
(θ) of pair-wise comparisons between the members of
the anoctamin family. All comparisons showed θ > 0 with
p < 0.05, suggesting that a site-specific rate shift after gene
duplication is a common phenomenon in the evolution of
the anoctamin family. Further analysis was subsequently
focused on ano1/ano2, and ano1/ano4. Amino acids residues responsible for functional divergence after gene
duplication were identified using site-specific profiles
(Figure 4A) in combination with suitable cut-off-values

derived from the posterior probability of each comparison.
Residues predicted to be functionally divergent in anoctamins were mapped onto topology model of human anoctamin 1 (Figure 4B). The predicted functional sites are not
equally distributed throughout the respective anoctamin,
but instead are clustered at the N-terminus, and in the
hydrophilic loops between predicted transmembrane
domains (Figure 4B). Despite the high global sequence
identity of mammalian anoctamins 1 and 2, functionally
divergent amino acids were also identified between these

anoctamins. This amino acid residues which are predominantly located in the loop regions exposed to soluble
ligands could be responsible for the different unitary conductance and kinetics between ano1 and ano 2 [1-3,6].
Finally, functional divergence within the anoctamin paralogues demonstrates that the anoctamin family members
have evolved different functional properties after gene
duplication and phylogenetic diversification events
[4,6,21,22]. Although all anoctamins have similar membrane topology and show sequence conservation in the

regions located around TMD’s and the re-entrant loop, it
is not clear whether all members of the anoctamin family
are associated with Cl- currents in various tissues. According to the result of our study, it is possible that they represent different types of ion channels, which can be
activated by other types of physiological stimuli. This
study also demonstrates that amino acids critical for functional divergence are predominantly located in the loop
regions exposed to soluble ligands. Functional improvements which include pseudogene formation [36], subfunctionalization [37] and neofunctionlization [38] after gene
duplication may result in altered functional constraints
between members of a gene family. In this study, the
divergences of amino acid sequences among different subfamilies provided us with indication that the anoctamin
genes may have diverse physiological functions. The
results of type I functional divergence (Table 1) suggested
that anoctamin genes should be significantly functionally
divergent from each other, owing to the evolutionary rate
and/or property differences at some amino acid sites.
Hence, functional divergence perhaps reflects the existence of long-term selective pressure.
Selective pressure among amino acid sites in the
anoctamin family

In order to test for presence of positive selection at individual amino acid codons, the site specific models

implemented in CODEML program [39] were used.
Likelhood rate tests were performed between model M7
(beta) and M8 (beta and ω) on anoctamin sequences,
however no positively selected sites were detected. This
can be explained with strong purifying selection which
acts on majority of the protein, while a few sites
undergo positive selection. Therefore substitution rate
ratios on non-synonymous (Ka) versus synonymous (Ks)
mutations (Ka/Ks) were calculated for vertebrate anoctamins, as shown for anoctamin 1 (Figure 5). The ratios
calculated between members of anoctamin family were
much less then 1, such as 0.0741 for anoctamin 1, indicating strong negative selection. Interestingly, sites
under strong purifying selection are located predominantly in the TMDs (Figure 5) suggesting their importance for the function of the anoctamin proteins.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this comprehensive bioinformatics analysis
of the anoctamin protein family suggests that both largescale and small-scale gene duplications and purifying
selection are the primary evolutionary force for generating the anoctamin family. Evolutionary analysis supports
the hypothesis from electrophysiological studies that
anoctamins have evolved distinctive functional properties,
which have occurred after gene duplication(s). These
findings will provide new insights for the structural

evolution study of anoctamin gene family and possibly
will offer a starting point for further experimental
verifications.

Methods
Data collection and multiple sequence alignments

PSI-BLAST and TBLASTN [40] searches with protein
sequences of the ten human anoctamins were performed
in protein databases and available genome sequencing projects at NCBI, ENSEMBL, UniProt, InterPro, the Sanger
Institute, UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group, and the
Joint Genome Institute. Proteins identified by the BLAST
search algorithms were considered as potential homologues when amino acid identity was above 35% over a
stretch of ≥150 amino acids. After removal of expressed
sequence tags, alternatively spliced isoforms, partial and
redundant sequences, the initial data set included 243 distinct sequences from 50 species (Additional file 1). Protein
sequence alignments were performed using MUSCLE
(Version 3.7) [41] and were subsequently manually edited
to improve alignments in Bioedit. Sequences with highly
divergent regions or gaps resulting in uncertain alignments
were excluded from the further analysis. Remaining 186
sequences were subjected to MUSCLE alignments and
subsequent phylogenetic analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis

ProtTest v2.4 [27], implementing the Akaike Information criterion (AIC) was used to estimate the most
appropriate model of amino acid substitution models for
tree building analyses. The best fit model of protein

evolution for the anoctamin protein family according to
ProtTest corresponds to a JTT+I+G model [42]. Tree
reconstructions were done by the Maximum Likelihood
method (ML) from the protein alignment using PhyML
software package [43], with the gamma distribution
model implemented to account for heterogeneity among
sites. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution
(a) was estimated using baseml from the PAMLv4.0, to
be a = 0.662. Support for each phylogenetic group was
tested using 100 bootstrap pseudoreplicates.
Topological analysis

Hydropathy analysis and prediction of putative transmembrane domains was done with the TMAP software
[44], which is based on the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm.
The average hydrophobicity values of putative transmembrane domains of 20-23 amino acid residues were
calculated according the Eisenberg scale. An average
hydropathy plot of 166 anoctamin-related protein
sequences was generated by the TMAP software with a
window of 19 amino acids.
Functional divergence and detection of amino acids
critical for altered functional constraints

Anoctamin sequence duplication events were tested for
type I functional divergence based on the method by Gu
et al [33,34]. The analysis was carried out with Diverge
(version 2.0) [35]. This method is based on maximum
likelihood procedures to estimate significant changes in
the rate of evolution after the emergence of two paralogous sequences. Type I sites represent amino acid

Milenkovic et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:319

residues conserved in one subfamily but highly variable
in another, implying that these residues have been subjected to different functional constraints. A set of 166
protein sequences was included in the study (Additional
file 1, Supplemental Table S1). Due to of gaps in the
alignment a total of 25 amino acid residues from human
ano1 (codons 476-501), 61 (codons 1-61) from human
ano2, 54 (codons 1-54) from human ano7, 33 (codons
749-782) of human ano9, and 46 (codons 1-28, and 639660) from human ano10 were excluded from the analysis. A new NJ tree was constructed within Diverge with
Poisson distance and re-rooted. The coefficient of functional divergence (θ) and the posterior probability for
the functional divergence were calculated for each position in the alignment. To detect amino acid residues
reflecting functional divergence, anoctamin subfamilies
were pair-wise compared to each other. The cut-off
value for the posterior probability was determined by
consecutively eliminating the highest scoring residues
from the alignment until the coefficient of functional
divergence dropped to zero.
Analysis of selective pressure

DNA sequences and related multiple proteins sequence
alignments were submitted to the PAL2NAL web server
[45] which converts a protein multiple sequence alignment and the corresponding DNA sequences into a
codon alignment. Subsequently, the codon alignment
and tree generated by using MUSCLE were provided to
CODEML, and the site specific models M7 and M8
were tested.
