Abstract
Background: Human parvovirus B19 is the etiologic agent of erythema infectiosum in children. It
is also associated with other clinical manifestations in different target groups. Patients with chronic
hemolytic anemia are at high risk of developing acute erythroblastopenia following infection by the
virus. They usually become highly viremic and pose an increased risk of virus transmission. Close
monitoring of such high risk groups is required for epidemiologic surveillance and disease
prevention activities. Here we report a molecular epidemiological study on B19 virus infection in
Tunisian patients with chronic hemolytic anemia.
Methods: This study was conducted on 92 young chronic hemolytic anemia patients who attended
the same ward at the National Bone Marrow Transplantation Center of Tunis and 46 controls from
a different hospital. Screening for IgM and IgG anti-B19 antibodies was performed using
commercially available enzyme immunoassays and B19 DNA was detected by nested PCR in the
overlapping VP1/VP2 region. DNA was sequenced using dideoxy-terminator cycle sequencing
technology.
Results: Anti-parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies were detected in 26 of 46 sickle-cell anemia patients,
18 of 46 β-thalassemia and 7 of 46 controls. Anti-parvovirus B19 IgM antibodies were detected only
in 4 of the sickle-cell anemia patients: two siblings and two unrelated who presented with acute
erythroblastopenia at the time of blood collection for this study and had no history of past
transfusion. B19 DNA was detected only in sera of these four patients and the corresponding 288
bp nested DNA amplicons were sequenced. The sequences obtained were all identical and
phylogenetic analysis showed that they belonged to a new B19 virus strain of Genotype1.
Conclusion: A new parvovirus B19 strain of genotype1 was detected in four Tunisian patients
with sickle-cell anemia. Virus transmission appeared to be nosocomial and resulted in acute
erythroblastopenia in the four patients. The possibility of independent transmission of this B19
variant to the patients is unlikely in light of the present epidemiological data. However this
possibility cannot be ruled out because of the low genetic variability of the virus.

Background
Human parvovirus B19 belongs to the Erythrovirus genus
of the Parvoviridae family and is the etiologic agent of erythema infectiosum or fifth disease in children [1,2]. Infections with this virus are very common and can result in a
wide range of clinical manifestations depending on the
patient's immunological and hematological status. In
immunocompetent individuals B19 infections can be
asymptomatic or benign and may cause erythema infectiosum and arthropathy [3]. Immunodeficient subjects may
become chronically infected [4,5]. During pregnancy, the
virus can be transmitted in utero sometimes leading to
fetal hydrops and fetal death [6,7].
Parvovirus B19 has a specific tropism for erythroïd progenitor cells and thus can cause a temporary infection of
the bone marrow eventually leading to a transient arrest in
erythropoiesis [8]. Patients with hematological disorders
are at risk of severe clinical illness especially in chronic
hemolytic anemia such as sickle cell disease [9,10], thalassemia [11] and hereditary spherocytosis [12]. In these
diseases erythroïd progenitor cell formation is increased
to compensate for red blood cell lysis and B19 infection
can suppress erythropoïesis and induce acute erythroblastopenia often referred to as transient aplastic crisis [13].
The patients usually become highly viremic and pose an
increased risk of virus transmission. Close monitoring of
such high risk groups for this viral infection is, therefore,
of great importance for epidemiologic surveillance and
disease prevention.
Parvovirus B19 is a highly conserved virus; however,
molecular epidemiological studies have shown the existence of three distinct genotypes modestly diverging from
each other in sequence by about 10% while not showing
any apparent differences in pathogenicity [14]. Genotype
1 is represented by the prototype B19 virus and is the most
prevalent. The first B19 variant to be discovered was V9
[15] which represents the rare genotype 3. Genotype 2 is
substantially more frequent with representatives such as
A6 and LaLi [16,17].
Only two epidemiological studies on human parvovirus
B19 infection in Tunisia have been reported. The first one
[18] was a comparative study on blood donors from Tunisia and Belgium and the second [19] was carried out on
Tunisian patients with chronic rheumatismal affections.
Specific anti-B19 IgG was found in 65% of the blood
donors and 80.7% of the patients with rheumatismal
affections, whereas specific IgM was present in less than
2% of the blood donors and was not detected in the
patients. No further epidemiological studies or molecular
data on parvovirus genotypes and putative variants circulating in Tunisia were reported.

Here we report, for the first time, a molecular epidemiological study on Parvovirus B19 infection in Tunisian
chronic hemolytic anemia patients.

Methods
Patients and sera
Sera used in this study were taken from 92 Tunisian
patients with chronic hematological disorders: 46 sicklecell anemia and 46 β-thalassemia. Forty six patients
affected with non-hematological diseases (11 diabetes, 11
tonsillitis, 12 rhinitis, and 12 nephritic syndrome) were
taken as controls. Patients of these groups were 2 to 19
years old with mean ages of 7.4 years for β-thalassemia,
9.2 years for sickle-cell anemia and 7.5 years for the control group. The chronic hemolytic anemia patients
attended the same ward at the National Bone Marrow
Transplantation Center of Tunis for treatment and follow
up, and the control group was from the Charles Nicolles
Hospital, Tunis. Written informed consent was obtained
from all individuals included in this study or their parents. All the work was conducted in compliance with the
Helsinki Declaration and approved by the National Ethics
Committee of Tunisia.
Detection of anti-Parvovirus B19 antibodies
Specific enzyme immunoassays (Biotrin International,
France) were used to detect anti-Parvovirus IgG and IgM
in sera according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
The colorimetric reaction was read using the LP 200
microplate reader (Diagnostic Pasteur, France). Statistical
significance of the serologic data was assessed by the Chisquare test for equality of distributions.
Detection of viral DNA
All necessary precautions were taken to prevent cross contamination. DNA extraction, PCR reagent preparation,
DNA amplification and gel electrophoresis were carried
out in separate rooms using separate sets of micropipettes
and sterile filter-tips. In addition, DNA extraction and
PCR reagent handling were done in dedicated safety cabinets under sterile conditions.

Undiluted sera (200 µl) were digested with 2 µl of proteinase k (20 mg/ml) at 56°C for 1 h. Insoluble aggregates
were removed by centrifugation at 13000 × g for 30 min.
DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described by the manufacturer.
Nested PCR for the detection of B19 DNA was performed
using two primer pairs [20] selected in the overlapping
region common to the minor (VP1) and major (VP2) capsid protein genes. The outer primers were: sense, 5'CAAAAGCATGTGGAGTGAGG-3' (nt 3187–3206); antisense, 5'-CTACTAACATGCATAGGCGC-3' (nt 3584–

3565). The inner primers were: sense, 5'-CCCAGAGCACCATTATAAGG-3' (nt 3271–3290); anti-sense, 5'-GTGCTGTCAGTAACCTGTAC-3' (nt 3558–3539). Product sizes
were 398 bp and 288 bp for the first and second round of
PCR, respectively.
Target DNA was amplified in a 50 µl reaction mixture containing 5 µl of sample DNA, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH = 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 µM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega) and either 0.5 µM of each outer primer or 1.0
µM of each inner primer.
Each PCR run included a blank control containing water
instead of target DNA, a negative control consisting of
DNA extracted from healthy human leucocytes appropriately diluted in normal human serum, and a positive control; the latter was prepared from a first-round PCR
product obtained previously (Regaya et al, 2003). Additional precautions were taken in handling this PCR product. First, it was maximally diluted in normal human
serum to minimize the possibility of cross contamination
while still allowing reproducible amplification. Second,
this B19 amplicon was sequenced prior to use for future
reference in case of suspected cross contamination.
Amplification reactions were performed with a thermocycler program consisting of 30 cycles of denaturation at
94°C for 1 minute, annealing for 2 minutes at either 55°C
with the outer primers, or 57°C with the inner primers,
and extension at 72°C for 3 minutes. A final 5-minute
extension step was added after the last cycle. Two microliters of the product obtained in the first PCR were subjected to the second PCR using the inner primers.
For the detection of amplified DNA, five microliters of
each product from the first or second PCR round were
subjected to electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels in the presence of ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.
DNA bands of approximately 288 bp following the second round of PCR indicated positive results. The absence
of such bands in the negative and blank controls indicated
the specificity of the PCR and the absence of cross contamination. The sensitivity of this nested PCR in our hands
was approximately 102 to 103 B19 genome copies per 5 µl.
DNA sequence analysis
Nested PCR products of the VP1 gene were purified from
excised agarose gel bands using QIAquick spin columns
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Sequencing of the purified
DNA was performed using the Taq Dideoxy Terminator
cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 377 DNA
sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing was first
done with the forward inner primer and then repeated
with the reverse inner primer for each sample. Sequences

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/7/123

were analyzed with three programs included in BioEdit
[21], ClustalW for multiple alignments, DNA Maximum
Likelihood program with Molecular Clock (DNAMLK) to
generate phylogenetic tree files, and finally TreeView [22]
to read tree files and draw phylogenetic trees. The nucleotide sequence data from this study were deposited at
GenBank under the following accession numbers: [GenBank: EF121420, GenBank: EF121421, GenBank:
EF121422, GenBank: EF121423].

Results
Serological and clinical data
The serological data of the three groups tested are summarized in Table 1. Anti-parvovirus B19 IgG antibodies were
detected in 26 (56.5%) of the sickle-cell anemia, 18
(39.1%) of the β-thalassemia and 7 (15.2%) of the control patients (Χ 2 = 15.19, DF = 2, p ≤ 0.00050296). Antiparvovirus B19 IgM antibodies were detected in only 4
(8.7%) patients of the sickle-cell anemia group. These
patients will be referred to as patients 1 to 4. They were all
males; two siblings (patients 1 and 2) and two unrelated
(patients 3 and 4). Their ages were 18, 14, 7 and 19 years
for patients 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Only patients 1
and 2 were also positive for anti-B19 IgG (Table 2). All
four patients were diagnosed with acute erythroblastopenia at the time of blood collection for this study and had
no past transfusion history. They presented with fever,
malaise, pallor and no cutaneous rash. Laboratory evaluation showed severe anemia and profound reticulocytopenia (Table 2). The four patients recovered progressively
following red cell transfusion. All the IgG positive/IgM
negative patients presented with no symptoms of acute
erythroblastopenia.
PCR results
Nested PCR in the overlapping VP1/VP2 region of the B19
genome was carried out on all anti-B19 antibody positive
sera. Only sera from the four anti-B19 IgM-positive
patients with acute erythroblastopenia produced DNA
amplicons with electrophoretic bands of the size expected
for B19 DNA, i.e. 398 bp in the first round (Figure 1A) and
288 bp in the second round (Figure 1B) of PCR. Such
DNA bands were consistently absent from agarose gel
lanes corresponding to the negative and blank controls

throughout all our PCR work. These results showed the
presence of parvovirus B19 DNA in only the sera of the
four acutely infected IgM positive patients and indicated
the absence of detectable chronic infection in the IgG positive/IgM negative subjects. The B19 virus isolates corresponding to the amplified DNA from the four acute
erythroblastopenia patients were designated R1 to R4.
Phylogenetic analysis
In order to identify the possible route of virus transmission to the four sickle-cell anemia patients and to know
the genotype and sequence diversity of virus isolates R1,
R2, R3, and R4, we purified and sequenced their nested
DNA amplicons. Partial 237 nucleotide sequences were
obtained from the sequencing data and aligned in BioEdit
with ClustalW (not shown). The four sequences appeared
to be identical, thus indicating that isolates R1 to R4
belonged to a single virus strain. The corresponding nucleotide sequence (R) was aligned in BioEdit with ClustalW
against selected representatives of the three known B19
virus genotypes retrieved from GenBank (Figure 2) and a
phylogenetic tree was constructed using DNAMLK and
TreeView (Figure 3). Sequence R clustered with reference
strains of genotype1. This sequence also produced many
significant alignments in nucleotide BLAST (NCBI) and

showed a maximum of 235/237 (99%) nucleotide identities with 11 reference strains of genotype 1 (not shown).
A characteristic (T ↔ C) transition at position 40 was
found exclusively in our isolates and in Kati 4 [GenBank:
AF161226.1]. This transition is represented in the alignment of Figure 2. All these substitutions were silent as
shown by alignment of sequence R in BLASTX (NCBI; not
shown). Taken together, these data indicated that the
virus isolates detected here represent a new B19 virus
strain of genotype1.

Discussion
Acute erythroblastopenia is the first disease to be associated with parvovirus B19 [9]. In predisposed patients such
as those affected with chronic hemolytic anemia, 70 to
80% of erythroblastopenia cases are caused by infection
with this virus. The infected patients usually become
highly viremic and pose an increased risk of B19 virus
transmission [11,13]. Close monitoring of such high risk
groups is required to acquire data on parvovirus infection
for the formulation of epidemiological surveillance programs and prevention strategies.
In this work we studied a population of 92 young Tunisian patients with chronic hemolytic anemia who
attended the same ward at the National Bone Marrow
Transplantation Center of Tunis. The control group consisted of patients with non-hematological disorders from
different wards at a nearby hospital. The serological data
obtained showed a much higher rate of past B19 infection
in the chronic hemolytic anemia patients, as indicated by
specific IgG. This situation may have resulted from a combination of known risk factors for B19 infection such as
the presence of highly viremic patients, nosocomial transmission [23], and transfusion-related transmission [24].
Comparison between the present serological data and
those previously reported in Tunisian blood donors [18]
and patients with chronic rheumatismal disorders [19]
illustrates the effect of age in the determinism of prevalence in B19 virus infection. The much older groups in the
previous studies belonged to lower risk categories for B19
infection, yet they showed a significantly higher prevalence of past infection by the virus than the present high
risk population. This observation corroborates published

otide identities with the closest reference strains, and a
characteristic (T ↔ C) transition at nucleotide position 40
of R. This transition was also found in the Kati-4 strain
which otherwise showed only 232/237 (97%) nucleotide
identities with R. These findings indicated that the virus
isolates represented a new B19 virus strain and phylogenetic analysis showed that it belongs to genotype1. Thus,
the possibility that this strain is a newly identified circulating variant cannot be disregarded in view of the low
variability of the VP1/VP2 gene [14,28]. However, it does
not exclude the possibility of nosocomial transmission
which is strongly suggested by the epidemiological data.
Sequencing of a larger part of the genome of the present
isolates, especially in the more variable VP1 unique region
[27] and further detection and analysis of other isolates
from Tunisia would be needed to confirm virus transmission and strain identity.
It is noteworthy, that all the nucleotide differences
observed between this new strain and the reference strains
of genotype1 in nucleotide BLAST were synonymous as
shown by alignment of sequence R in BLASTX. This further confirmed the lower variability of the VP1/VP2 region
at the protein level than at the DNA level [27].

epidemiological reports indicating that this infection
spreads at a high rate in low age groups to reach 50% of
young adolescents by age 15, and continues at a lower rate
throughout adult life to reach most of the elderly [25,26].
Four of the chronic hemolytic anemia patients were found
to be acutely infected by the parvovirus as shown by the
presence of specific IgM and viral DNA in their serum. The
corresponding virus isolates had identical partial VP1/VP2
DNA sequences and therefore appeared to represent a single B19 strain, thus pointing towards nosocomial transmission. Since nosocomial transmission of B19 infection
is documented [23,27] and since the patients had no past
transfusions, the presence of the same virus strain in the
four patients can be interpreted as the result of nosocomial transmission. An alternative explanation would be
that the detected B19 strain is a hitherto unknown variant
circulating independently of hospital settings. This possibility is also in conformity with the present genetic and
phylogenetic analysis. Indeed, when the DNA sequence
(R) representing this strain was aligned in nucleotide
BLAST, it showed a maximum of 235/237 (99%) nucle-

Conclusion
Four patients with sickle-cell anemia who presented with
acute erythroblastopenia were found to be acutely
infected by the B19 parvovirus. Analysis of the Partial viral
DNA sequence in the overlapping VP1/VP2 region indicated the four patients were infected by a single B19 variant strain of genotype1. Virus transmission to the four
patients was most probably nosocomial according to the
epidemiological data. The molecular data were in line
with this mode of transmission but could not fully confirm it because of the known low variability of the B19
genome especially in the VP1/VP2 gene. Final confirmation of transmission will await sequencing of longer and
more variable regions of the viral genome.
