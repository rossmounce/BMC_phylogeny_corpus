From the Western Alps across Central Europe:
Postglacial recolonisation of the tufa stream
specialist Rhyacophila pubescens (Insecta,
Trichoptera)

Abstract
Background: Dispersal rates, i.e. the effective number of dispersing individuals per unit time, are the product of
dispersal capacity, i.e. a species physiological potential for dispersal, dispersal behaviour, i.e. the decision to leave a
habitat patch in favour of another, and connectivity of occupied habitat. Thus, dispersal of species that are highly
specialised to a certain habitat is limited by habitat availability. Species inhabiting very stable environments may
also adopt a sedentary life-style. Both factors should lead to strong genetic differentiation in highly specialised
species inhabiting stable environments. These two factors apply to our model species Rhyacophila pubescens a
highly specialised freshwater insect that occurs in tufa springs, a very stable habitat.
Results: We examined the genetic population structure and phylogeography using range-wide mtCOI sequence
and AFLP data from 333 individuals of R. pubescens. We inferred the location of Pleistocene refugia and postglacial
colonisation routes of R. pubescens, and examined ongoing local differentiation. Our results indicate intraregional
differentiation with a high number of locally endemic haplotypes, that we attributed to habitat specificity and low
dispersal rates of R. pubescens. We observed high levels of genetic diversity south of the Alps and genetic
impoverishment north of the Alps. Estimates of migrants placed the refugium and the source of the colonisation in
the Dauphiné Alps (SW Alps).
Conclusions: This is the first example of an aquatic insect with a colonisation route along the western margin of
the Alps to the Central European highlands. The study also shows that specialisation to a stable environment may
have promoted a behavioural shift to decreased dispersal rates, leading to stronger local population differentiation
than in less specialised aquatic insects. Alternatively, the occurrence of highly specialised tufa spring habitats may
have been more widespread in the past, leading to range regression and fragmentation among present day R.
pubescens populations.

Background
In recent years our knowledge of phylogeographic patterns of European animal and plant species has grown
tremendously [1-4]. From these studies we are gaining a
better understanding of the biogeography of the European flora and fauna and how current species distribution patterns were shaped by both ancient and recent

earth history [5]. We have also learned that terrestrial
species may exhibit different patterns than aquatic species [6-8]. Species of aquatic insects, in particular, can
show different patterns of population structure, even if
they are co-distributed, are closely related, and/or share
the same ecological niche [9,10]. Historic population
movement and changes in effective population size, but
also recent or ongoing gene flow among populations,
shape present-day patterns of population structure. Current dispersal rates and gene flow result from the dispersal capacity of a species (i.e. its physiological ability
to disperse and successfully find and recolonize new

habitats), its dispersal behaviour [11], and the connectivity of suitable habitats. The latter can be reduced if species are highly specialised in their habitat requirements
[11,12].
Compared to terrestrial niches, stream biotopes are
erratically distributed, making their inhabitants particularly interesting for studying population genetics and
phylogeography. Many highland aquatic insect species
exhibit ‘insular’ distributions among mountain ranges,
but also within mountain ranges where populations
occur in isolated habitats with few or no interconnecting
corridors of suitable habitat. This is due to the linear
structure of stream habitats and the habitat specificity of
many species [13], the restriction of lateral dispersal to
the generally short-lived, winged adult stage, and the
behaviour of species to disperse primarily along stream
corridors [14,15]. Some aquatic insects, particularly
some species of caddisflies, are considered good fliers,
and long-distance dispersal has been documented for
several species [16-19]. Thus, dispersal behaviour may
play a very prevalent role in shaping genetic population
structure in aquatic insects [20]. Species living in rare,
isolated, but more or less stable habitats are expected to
disperse less frequently than species living in ephemeral
or more common habitats [19-22]. Permanent springs
and spring brooks are particularly stable as their physical-chemical parameters, e.g. temperature, are less prone
to seasonal or annual variation [23,24]. Tufa springs,
defined as calcareous springs with calcium carbonate
deposits, have constantly high pH and conductivity [25].
Thus, it is perceivable that tufa spring specialist aquatic
insect species may exhibit particularly low dispersal
rates, independent of adult dispersal ability.
The caddisfly Rhyacophila pubescens Pictet, 1834, is a
highly specialised cold-stenotherm species that only
occurs in permanent tufa spring brooks in limestone
mountain ranges from the spring source to 5 km downstream [26,27]. Using mitochondrial COI sequence data,
we previously examined the population structure of R.
pubescens north of the Alps [28] and observed one central haplotype in all regions north of the Alps. This haplotype putatively gave rise to many other haplotypes that
differed from it by one or two mutations. Based on this
pattern we hypothesized that R. pubescens postglacially
recolonised its Central European range from a single
refugial source. We also observed numerous private
haplotypes and hypothesized recent or ongoing in-situ
diversification. Since our sampling was limited to the
northern ranges and excluded common European refugial areas, and we examined only mtDNA sequences, we
could not test these hypotheses in our previous study.
Our current study has three main objectives. First, we
explicitly test the hypothesis of a postglacial colonisation
of Central Europe from a single Pleistocene refuge. We

Page 2 of 14

predict that genetic data will show a connection
between one, not several, southern refugia and the Central European populations. Second, we want to identify
the location of the Pleistocene refugia of R. pubescens,
which we predict to be associated with the south-western Alps based on calcareous Pleistocene refugia
known from the region for plants [29] or with refugia
on the Italian Peninsula [1-3,5]. Upon identifying the
refugia we wish to reconstruct the population history
and recolonisation process of R. pubescens. Third, we
ask if highly specialised inhabitants of stable environments - in this case R. pubescens - exhibit lower dispersal rates and higher levels of population differentiation
than other species that are less specialised. We predict
that R. pubescens exhibits high levels of population
structure, even at a small geographic scale, due to its
strong affiliation with isolated tufa spring environments.
To address these objectives we use a range-wide sampling of both mtDNA sequence and nuclear Amplified
Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP) data. We
employ both population genetic and phylogeographic
methods to elucidate patterns of population differentiation, past migration rates and changes in demographic
history.

Materials and methods
We analysed 333 specimens of R. pubescens from 51
sites across the entire distribution range (Figure 1, Table
1). MtCOI sequence data for 197 specimens from the

northern distribution were taken from Engelhardt et al.
[28]; additional sequences from the remaining distribution area and all AFLP data were newly generated. Collection and storage of specimens followed Engelhardt et
al. [28]. Larvae and adults were identified using Waringer & Graf [30] and Malicky [31], respectively. All specimen vouchers are deposited at Senckenberg, Germany.
Molecular Methods
Mitochondrial sequence data

DNA extraction and PCR amplification protocols of a
475bp long fragment of mtCOI followed Engelhardt et
al. [28]. Sequences were generated by Nano+Bio Center
Kaiserslautern, Germany, and AGOWA GmbH Berlin,
Germany. ABI traces were aligned, checked, and edited
manually using Sequencher Vers. 4.8 (Gene Codes Corporation, Michigan, USA).
Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism

The Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)
protocol followed Huck et al. [32] with minor modifications: Genomic DNA concentration was standardised to
50 ng DNA/μl. 250 ng genomic DNA were digested.
The initial restriction-ligation lasted 14 h at 20°C. Multiplex AFLP products were genotyped on an ABI Prism
3100 DNA capillary sequencer (University of Mainz,
Germany) together with an internal size standard (GeneScan ROX 500, ABI). Fragments were scored with Genemarker Vers. 1.7 (SoftGenetics, Pennsylvania, USA).
Fragments were automatically scored as present when
peak height exceeded the standard parameter-setting
threshold (300). Trace files were also re-examined
visually. Fragments in the size range of 100-250 bp were
used for analysis. We used 18 replicate samples to assess
scoring error according to Bonin et al. [33]. Twelve fragments were not included in the analyses because of
scoring errors; 19 fragments were only present in one or
two individuals and were thus excluded; one monomorphic fragment was also excluded.
Analyses
Mitochondrial sequence data

To examine genetic population structure we pooled the
51 sampled sites by mountain region and uniform geological units following Diercke Weltatlas [34] and Gonseth et al. [35]. This grouping is non-random but
reflects the existing geographic isolation of R. pubescens
across the distribution range. Samples were grouped
into 23 different geographic units, i.e., mountain
regions, which we refer to as regions (Table 1). We calculated an unrooted median-joining haplotype network
[36] in Network 4.5.0.1 (Fluxus Technology) to illustrate
haplotype distribution. Exact tests of population differentiation [37] and pairwise F ST -values were used to
detect differentiation among regions. We partitioned

Page 3 of 14

total genetic variation by geographic hierarchies using
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) [38]: geographic hierarchies were “among 23 regions”, “among
populations, i.e. sampling sites, within regions” and
“within populations”. We also calculated independent
AMOVAs for the regions north and south of the Alps
(Figure 1). A Mantel test [39] for isolation-by-distance
was conducted using pairwise FST-values and geographical distance between all analysed populations. Analyses
were performed with Arlequin 3.1 [40] using default
settings, except for the AMOVAs that were run with
16,000 permutations. Mismatch distributions were calculated with 1,000 bootstraps for 23 regions and for the
whole dataset. To test for demographic change in each
region and the whole dataset, we calculated two neutrality tests: Tajima’s D and Fu’s FS. Significant negative D
and FS values can arise under selective effects but can
also indicate population expansion or bottlenecks
[41,42]. We also calculated gene and nucleotide diversity. Analyses were performed in Arlequin 3.1 with
default settings.
Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism

A Mantel test [39] was conducted using pairwise FSTvalues and geographical distance between all analysed
populations with 999 permutations in GenAlEx 6.1 [43].
Using AFLPdat [44] we calculated the proportion of
polymorphic markers (95% confidence) and Nei’s gene
diversity H [45] in each region and for the regions north
and south of the Alps. We also calculated frequency
down weighted marker values DW for each region [46].
High DW-values would be expected in older populations where rare markers should accumulate due to
mutations, low values are expected in recently established populations. Following Westberg & Kadereit [47]
we used AFLPdiv [48] with rarefaction set to 4, to assess
intrapopulation genetic diversity as band richness (br4),
i.e. “the number of phenotypes expected at each AFLP
locus when four individuals have been sampled from the
population.” Due to limited sample size we did not evaluate br 4 in the Bilé Karpaty and Pieniny Mountains.
The Shannon Index of phenotypic diversity S [49] was
calculated in POPGENE 3.2. Private fragments, i.e. fragments that only occured in one region or stream population were counted using AFLPdat, to assess the degree
of divergence among populations and regions [50].
AMOVA [38] was calculated for the AFLP data in Arlequin 3.1 with 16,000 permutations.
We selected the regions where we sampled three or
more streams (Northern Hessian Mountains, Franconian
Alb, Northern Calcareous Alps, Swiss Jura and Northern
Alpine slope) to assess ongoing or recent diversification
among populations within regions. We calculated mean
GST [45] among populations within these regions using
POPGENE 3.2 [51].

Model-based coalescent estimates of migration

The distribution of the ancestral haplotype H1 in the
northern populations and the Western Alps (see
Results), combined with the strongly diverged and differentiated haplogroups associated with the Ligurian
Alps and the Apennines, indicates that the most probable location of the refuge and source for the northward
colonisation is somewhere in the Western Alps. We
therefore used Migrate 3.0.3 [52] to investigate past
gene flow in the Western Alps region to examine from
where the putative northward colonisation originated.
We calculated a stepping stone model for the populations Provence Alps, French Calcareous Alps, Dauphiné
Alps, Swiss Jura, Mittelland and Northern Alpine slope
(Table 1) to estimate effective migrants. The model was
set with asymmetric migration parameters and unrestricted theta estimates. Thus the model estimated migration between neighbouring populations. Starting values
were estimated from F ST -values for the first run. We
conducted a second run using the estimates for theta
and M of the first run as starting values. Both runs used
10 short chains and recorded 25,000 genealogies with a
sampling increment of 20 (500,000 genealogies visited),
and two long chains that recorded 200,000 genealogies
with as sampling increment of 50 (10,000,000 genealogies visited). We used an adaptive heating scheme with

Page 6 of 14

four chains (1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 5.0) and a swapping interval of
one to ensure sufficient mixing. The analysis was based
on the mtCOI dataset.

Results
MtDNA haplotype distribution

We generated unambiguous mtCOI sequences for 333
individuals. The 475 bp alignment contained no gaps or
length variants, 94 positions were variable and 83 sites
were parsimony informative. There were 59 unique haplotypes (GenBank Accessions EU885387-EU885414,
GU186972-GU187002). The maximum difference was
70 bp (14.74%) between all haplotypes and 29 bp
(6.11%) for the “Central European” haplotypes without
the divergent haplotypes found in Liguria, the Apennines and Corsica. The unrooted median-joining haplotype network (Figure 2) showed that the northern
populations were dominated by one central haplotype,
H1, which was carried by almost half of the specimens
examined (N = 149). This central haplotype was surrounded by several haplotypes that differed from it by
one or two mutational steps. H1 was not present in the
Northern Alpine foothills, the Český Kras and the Bilé
Karpaty, the Cottic and Ligurian Alps, the Apennines or
on Corsica. In all regions north and south of the Alps
there were regional endemic haplotypes and haplotypes

endemic to single streams (Table 1). In the Western
Alps, Ligurian Alps, Apennines and on Corsica haplotypes were highly divergent. A Bayesian Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo phylogenetic inference (results not shown)
was consistent with the median-joining network.
Genetic diversity

The final AFLP dataset comprised 132 fragments. Maximum scoring error at individual loci was 0.11; mean
mismatch value per fragment over all samples was 0.05.
Gene diversity based on mtCOI data of northern populations was 0.7290 +/- 0.0289, and 0.9240 +/- 0.0134 for
southern populations. Nucleotide diversity was also
lower in the north (0.012868 +/- 0.009120) than in the
south (0.161948 +/- 0.080769). The percentage of polymorphic AFLP loci (95% confidence), band richness and
Nei’s gene diversities based on AFLPs were highest in
the Ligurian Alps, followed by the Česky Kras, Cottic
Alps, French Calcareous Alps and the Provence Alps
(Table 2). Percentage of polymorphic loci was lower in
the region north of the Alps (0.63%) than in the region
south of the 231 Alps (0.95%), as was Nei’s gene diversity (north: 0.05, south: 0.21). Shannon Index of phenotypic diversity based on AFLP was highest in the
Western Alps, on Corsica and in the two populations
from the Czech Republic (Table 2, Figure 3). As a measure of divergence the frequency down-weighted marker

value (DW) was calculated for AFLPs. We found the
highest value in Liguria, and high values in the Apennines and on Corsica, and in the Czech populations
(Table 2, Figure 3). Private AFLP fragments were present in the Apennines (4 fragments), Corsica (4), Liguria
(19), the Cottic Alps (1), and the Franconian Alb (1).
Fixed private fragments (i.e. private fragments that
occur in all sampled individuals from the respective
population) were found in the Apennines (1) and on
Corsica (3).
Population differentiation and genetic structure

Exact tests of population differentiation based on mtCOI
data indicated that 214 of 253 (84.6%) of all region pairs
were significantly differentiated (see Additional File 1).
Pairwise FST-values were significant for 182 of 253 comparisons (71.9%, p ≤ 0.05, Bonferroni adjusted a-value =
0.00020, see Additional File 1). Pairwise FST values of
AFLP data were significant for 123 of 253 comparisons
(48.62%, p ≤ 0.05, Bonferroni adjusted a-value =
0.00020, see Additional File 2).
AMOVA of both mtDNA and AFLP data showed that
populations in different regions were genetically different from each other (mtCOI: 73.06%; AFLPs: 57.53%;
both p < 0.001) and that variance among populations
within regions was much lower (mtCOI: 26.94%; AFLPs:
42.47%; both p < 0.001). When only taking the

mountain ranges north of the Alps into account,
AMOVA of mtCOI data revealed more variation within
regions (63.78%, p < 0.001) than among regions (36.22%,
p < 0.001). In contrast, AMOVA of AFLPs from the
northern populations showed 45.72% variation within
regions and 54.28% variation among regions (p < 0.001
for both values). In the southern regions there was less
variation within regions (mtCOI: 24.95%; AFLPs:
46.46%; both p < 0.001) than among regions (mtCOI:
75.05%; AFLPs: 53.54%; both p < 0.001). The results
illustrate that differentiation among mountain ranges
north of the Alps was lower than among mountain
ranges south of the Alps. In general, the differences
were less pronounced in the AFLP data than in the
mtCOI data. A weak isolation-by-distance effect was
revealed by Mantel test (mtCOI: r = 0.151759, p = 0.02;
AFLP: r = 0.226, p < 0.01). A Mantel test considering
only the populations north of the Alps showed no correlation based on mtCOI data (r = 0.038254, p = 0.30),
but did show a weak correlation in the AFLP data (r =
0.244, p < 0.01). In both data sets a much stronger correlation was found in the southern populations (mtCOI:
r = 0.434078, p < 0.01; AFLP: r = 0.666, p < 0.01), indicating that the southern populations were comparatively
closer to equilibrium between genetic drift and gene
flow than the northern ones.

We examined ongoing or recent diversification using
GST in the Northern Hessian Mountains, Franconian
Alb, Northern Calcareous Alps, Swiss Jura and Northern
Alpine slope. Mean GST among populations within each
of the five regions was 0.54 in the Northern Calcareous
Alps, 0.49 in the Swiss Jura, 0.45 in the Northern Alpine
slope, 0.41 in the Northern Hessian Mountains and 0.14
in the Franconian Alb.
Demographic expansion

In the regions studied north of the Alps, almost all mismatch distributions of mtCOI haplotypes were unimodal
[28]. Unimodal distribution of pairwise differences indicates recent population growth [53]. In the southern
regions most of the mismatch distributions were bi- or
multimodal except for the Dauphiné Alps and the
Apennines, indicating stable population sizes in the
south without any hint of population expansion. Negative significant values for Tajima’s D were found for the
Swiss Jura, the French Calcareous Alps and for the dataset as a whole, indicating a high number of low frequency polymorphisms in the mtCOI dataset and
potential population size expansion [41,42] (results not
shown). Values of Fu’s F S test for mtCOI data were
negative and significant for the Franconian Alb and the
entire dataset, and highly significant for the Swiss Jura

(results not shown). Negative, but non significant values
for both tests were found in the Swabian Alb, Northern
Calcareous Alps, Mittelland, Slovenské Rudohorie,
Northern Hungarian Mountains and the Dauphiné Alps.
Migration in the Western Alps

We used Migrate to test the hypothesis that the refuge
and source for the northern populations was located in
the south-western (SW) Alps. We calculated a stepping
stone model with mtCOI data to estimate numbers of
effective migrants and the direction of migration from
the populations in the SW Alps to the northern populations. Both Migrate runs yielded similar results. Results
of the second run are presented. Gene flow, measured
as effective migrants, was detected from the Dauphiné
Alps southward to the French Calcareous Alps, and
from these to the Provence Alps (Figure 4). There was
also northward gene flow from the Dauphiné Alps to
the Swiss Jura, to a higher degree from the Swiss Jura to
the Mittelland and from there to the Northern Alpine
slope. No gene flow was detected from the Provence or
Calcareous Alps northward or from the Swiss Jura
southward.

Discussion
Glacial refugia and postglacial recolonisation of R.
pubescens
Glacial Refugia

Rhyacophila pubescens is restricted to Central Europe
and the Italian peninsula, the latter a region of many
Pleistocene refuges [1,5]. Circum-alpine refugia are also
postulated for several aquatic insects [8,54,55]. Accordingly, we consider the Apennines or the south-western
Alps - the latter also on the basis of haplotype sharing
with all central European populations [28] - as possible
refugial zones. We can dismiss the Apennines as a likely
source of refuges for the northern populations, because
the genetic composition of these populations differs dramatically from those of Central European populations.
Instead, our data show that the location of the refugium
was in the western part of the Alps. This is supported
by the fact that haplotype H1, which is the ancestral
haplotype of the northern populations, is not present in
the Italian Peninsula or Liguria, but in the French part
of the Alps. Also, all other haplotypes in Central Europe
are derived from H1, showing that the genetic make up
of the Central European populations was primarily influenced from a common refugial source.
We thus propose that the northern edge of the distribution of R. pubescens during the last glacial maximum
was in the region of the French Calcareous or Dauphiné
Alps, below the permafrost line and that northward
expansion started from there. The results of gene flow
analysis indicate that the Dauphiné Alps are the only

region from which migration occurred northwards and
southwards in the Western Alps (Figure 4). The northward migration presumably coincided with gradual climate warming in the early Holocene, about 10,000 years
ago [56]. It would seem plausible that the French and
Swiss Jura were recolonised first, as the glacial retreat
was slower in the higher regions of the main Alpine
ridge. Gene flow and migration rates indicate a recolonisation route along the Western Alps to Switzerland and
then to the Central European highlands.
Colonisation from the southwestern Alps seems plausible since potential peripheral refugia with calcareous
bedrock have also been inferred for mountain plants
[29]. A southwestern Alps refugium and subsequent
recolonisation from there was shown for the plant Eryngium alpinum that also exhibits a strong affinity to calcareous substrate [57]. A northward recolonisation route
along the Western Alps was also inferred for the butterfly Polyommatus coridon, a species typical of calcareous

Engelhardt et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:10
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/10

grasslands [58]. Interestingly, a glacial tongue was present near the present-day city of Gap during the last
glacial maximum that could have caused a period of
separation between the Liguria/Provence populations
and the French Calcareous Alps/Dauphiné Alps populations [29]. When this glacial tongue retreated, gene flow
occurred again between the French Calcareous Alps/
Dauphiné Alps and the Provence Alps. This scenario is
concordant with the results of gene flow analysis in this
study and would explain the finding of both the “northern” haplotype H1 and the"southern” haplotypes H37,
H38 in the Provence Alps. Based on haplotype distribution and results of the Migrate analysis, we infer a secondary contact zone for R. pubescens in the Provence
Alps.
Overall, haplotype divergence, molecular variance and
genetic diversity in R. pubescens are much greater in the
southern part of the range than in the north. Increasing
genetic impoverishment from former refugia to recently
recolonised areas is an expected and common pattern in
organisms [59-61], including aquatic species like the
bryozoan Cristatella mucedo [62], and the gastropod
Theodoxus fluviatilis [63]. The latter species exhibits
low genetic diversity in mtDNA in populations in
Northern Europe, where all haplotypes seem to be
derived from a single ancestral haplotype, similar to the
pattern we observed in R. pubescens. High values of
these diversity estimators are generally expected in
populations that are relatively old or in hybrid zones.
Diversity indices and down-weighted marker values
derived from AFLP data indicate that the south-western
Alps, the Apennines and Corsica have been inhabited
continuously by R. pubescens. Results from mtDNA and
AFLP analyses both support present complete isolation
of the Corsican populations. In the haplotype network
(Figure 2) H53 from Liguria is the closest haplotype to
the Corsican cluster, and is separated from it by 45
mutational steps (9.47% of 475 bp). This degree of
divergence is evidence of long-term isolation of the Corsican lineage from the remaining mainland populations.
Monophyly of all known R. pubescens haplotypes from
the entire distribution was confirmed by a three gene
phylogeny of six closely related species in the Rhyacophila tristis-group [64], but it seems evident that the
Corsican population of R. pubescens is in the process of
speciation. Clarifying the divergence times of the Corsican population in the context of a phylogenetic study of
the R. tristis-group is a logical next step. While promising interesting biogeographical findings with regard to
Corsican Trichoptera, a detailed examination is not central to our research questions and exceeds the scope of
our current study.

Postglacial colonisation of Central Europe

During the early Holocene (~10,000 years ago), vast
areas of Central Europe were covered by thick loess
deposits [65]. It is known that tufa formation occurred
in these loess deposits [66], though the exact processes
are not yet fully understood. It seems reasonable to
assume that this period was characterised by a highly
variable climate and dynamic fluvial processes [67],
which may have forced recolonising species like R. pubescens to disperse to more moderate environments or
more stable streams. The cold-tolerance of the species
and its ability to cope physiologically and functionally
with very high carbonate concentrations could have promoted rapid recolonisation of Central Europe. Our
records [27,28,64] illustrate that the species is able to
inhabit calc-sinter streams where other macroinvertebrate predators are very rare. Thus, the species appears
to be currently outcompeted in less marginal habitats by
other macroinvertebrate predator species. However, R.
pubescens’ physiological plasticity should be tested in
laboratory experiments.
More frequent long distance dispersal or more widespread suitable habitat during this period of recolonisation would explain the presence of the common
haplotype H1 over the entire northern part of the present range of R. pubescens. Other examples of rapid
northward recolonisation were shown to occur in the
pond turtle Emys orbicularis [67], and even in flightless
species like the grasshopper Chorthipppus parallelus
[60].
Rhyacophila pubescens is the first example of a Central European aquatic insect that started postglacial
recolonisation from a south-western alpine refugium
along the western edge of the Alps to the former periglacial area north of the Alps. This pattern differs considerably from patterns of Pleistocene survival and
postglacial recolonisation of Central Europe observed in
other cold tolerant caddisflies and aquatic invertebrates,
for example, multiple glacial refugia (R. aquitanica [68],
D. romanicus [10]) or Central European refugia (e.g. D.
discolor [8]).
The case study in R. pubescens provides another
example that phylogeographic history appears to be largely species-specific in aquatic insects with no common
patterns emerging to date. This is quite different to the
situation in terrestrial species, where several common
patterns are known [3,5]. Differences among terrestrial
and aquatic responses to historic climate change may
result from the fundamental difference in thermal
regimes of terrestrial and aquatic ecoystems, and stream
ecosystems in particular. Specific differences observed
among stream dwelling aquatic insects likely relate to

Engelhardt et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:10
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/10

the different habitat specialisation of the species, their
cold-tolerance, their dispersal ability, habitat availability
during major glaciations and in the postglacial period of
recolonisation or a combination of these factors.
Habitat specialisation, population differentiation, and
dispersal behavior

The caddisfly R. pubescens is adapted to a specialised
habitat that also happens to be characterised by stable
environmental conditions: small permanent headwater
tufa streams and springs. While we sampled a variety of
habitat types from all regions over several years, R. pubescens was only collected from tufa springs, underscoring its restriction to this habitat type. As is to be
expected for any species that occurs in patchily distributed headwater stream environments with specific physico-chemical characteristics, R. pubescens exhibits
regional differentiation. A similar pattern was also
observed in other highland caddisflies in Europe
[8,10,68]. However, even within regions where there
were no obvious barriers to dispersal between suitable
habitats, we detected genetic differentiation in R. pubescens, as evidenced by GST and private haplotypes. The
presence of private haplotypes in almost all mountain
ranges and in single streams across the entire distribution of the species indicates low dispersal rates between
streams. This observation is supported by the absence of
an isolation-by-distance effect in the northern populations. The lack of an isolation-by-distance pattern across
much of the northern part of the range of R. pubescens
indicates that higher genetic drift in marginal populations is not the main reason for the observed pattern
[69]. R. pubescens is rarely collected in large numbers
[27], and low effective population sizes combined with
low or zero gene flow between habitat patches, in addition to genetic drift, may be changing the composition
of each local gene pool [70,71].
Several studies suggest that highly specialised species
are more isolated because of habitat availability than
generalist species. A comparatively lower local dispersal
rate may result in a high number of rare or locally
restricted alleles as shown for the butterfly M. aurelia
[72], a calcareous grassland specialist. Matern et al. [12]
also inferred a low dispersal capacity and a high degree
of within drainage genetic differentiation for the headwater specialist beetle Carabus variolosus. Molecular
studies of European caddisflies have not yet examined
differences among specialist and generalist species, but
the available studies do allow for some comparisons. In
Hydropsyche tenuis the genetic diversity and differentiation are lower than in R. pubescens and there is evidence
for ongoing or recent long-distance dispersal surrounding the Alps in H. tenuis [9]. Hydropsyche tenuis is less
selective regarding its habitat, occurring in the very

Page 11 of 14

dynamic headwater and mid-range stream regions of
calcareous and siliceous streams [13]. Rhyacophila aquitanica, Drusus discolor, and Drusus romanicus are more
strongly associated with cold habitats than H. tenuis, but
occur in both siliceous and calcareous streams. They
exhibit greater population differentiation than H. tenuis
[8,10,68], but the degree of intraregional differentiation
is not nearly as pronounced as it is in R. pubescens. The
comparison with the available studies does suggest that
specialisation may lead to greater population differentiation in aquatic insects.
Why is R. pubescens apparently not dispersing among
its specialised habitats? At first, this result seems at
odds with the widespread occurrence of the dominant
haplotype and the hypothesis of a rapid postglacial recolonisation of Central Europe. The observed patterns are
consistent with a recent reduction of suitable habitat
and resulting local allopatric fragmentation. The vast
loess deposits over Central Europe in the early Holocene
[65] may have provided more widespread tufa habitats
[66] suitable for R. pubescens. After the postglacial
expansion and the decrease in loess deposits across Europe, the primarily sedentary species would have experienced allopatric fragmentation into more isolated
outcrops of calcareous rocks where tufa streams form
and persist to the present. Unfortunately with so little
knowledge about tufa development in loess deposits and
limited paleosol data, it is currently not possible to
reconstruct the distribution of tufa habitats during the
early Holocene to test this idea.
The contrast between widespread haplotypes and
many private fragments and haplotypes is also consistent
with a shift in dispersal rates either following a change
in dispersal capacity of the species, or a change in dispersal behavior. We favour the explanation of a shift in
dispersal behaviour over a relatively recently evolved
morphological or physiological adaptation resulting in
reduced dispersal capacity. Hoffsten [73] showed that
morphology of the thorax and its effect on flight was
linked to site occupancy in many stream species of caddisflies. In his study he examined two species of Rhyacophila, both of which showed morphological attributes
related to strong flight (e.g., relatively high relative thoracic mass, which reflects the amount of flight muscle
available). However one species, R. fasciata was limited
in the number of sites where it occurred (27%), while R.
nubila occurred at all sites (100%). Thus, while both
species have the physiological capacity for flight and dispersal, one species disperses less. Dispersal rates are not
limited solely by flight capacity, i.e. the physiological
ability to fly certain distances or for certain periods of
time, but also by behaviour. If dispersal behaviour is
linked to habitat stability [19-22], then it seems reasonable that R. pubescens, which currently only inhabits

Engelhardt et al. Frontiers in Zoology 2011, 8:10
http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/8/1/10

environmentally stable tufa springs and headwater
streams, has adopted a more or less sedentary life style
with little lateral dispersal among streams. The widespread occurrence of a common haplotype suggests that
long distance dispersal is possible in R. pubescens, but in
this specialist caddisfly, dispersal rate may be responding
to habitat availability and habitat persistence [21]. Current geographic conditions, the stability of spring habitats, and the high degree of habitat specialisation of R.
pubescens could be promoting a predominantly sedentary behaviour.

Conclusions
Our study shows that changes in habitat availability
through time or plasticity in ecological life history traits
can shape a species’ distribution pattern and genetic
population structure. This is particularly true for high
specialised species. In response to inhabiting a very
stable but generally harsh environment (tufa springs), R.
pubescens may have adopted a more or less sedentary
behavior with limited dispersal rates leading to rare
exchange of genetic material among populations and
thus the evolution of locally restricted haplotypes and
AFLP fragments. Nevertheless diversity indices and shallow genetic population structure show that widespread
postglacial dispersal from a southern refuge and occupancy of habitats north of the Alps was possible, highlighting the species’ high physiological dispersal
capacity. This apparent contradiction suggests a shift in
dispersal behaviour or availability of habitat between the
early postglacial and today. Our study species shows
Pleistocene persistence and postglacial colonisation from
a single refugial source in the southwestern Alps, a pattern hitherto unknown in aquatic insects. Both aspects
highlight the specificity of aquatic species responses to
past and potentially future climate change.
