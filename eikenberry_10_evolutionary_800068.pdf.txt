prostate cancer in a multi-scale mathematical

Abstract
Background: Androgens bind to the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cells and are essential survival factors for
healthy prostate epithelium. Most untreated prostate cancers retain some dependence upon the AR and respond, at
least transiently, to androgen ablation therapy. However, the relationship between endogenous androgen levels and
cancer etiology is unclear. High levels of androgens have traditionally been viewed as driving abnormal proliferation
leading to cancer, but it has also been suggested that low levels of androgen could induce selective pressure for
abnormal cells. We formulate a mathematical model of androgen regulated prostate growth to study the effects of
abnormal androgen levels on selection for pre-malignant phenotypes in early prostate cancer development.
Results: We find that cell turnover rate increases with decreasing androgen levels, which may increase the rate of
mutation and malignant evolution. We model the evolution of a heterogeneous prostate cell population using a
continuous state-transition model. Using this model we study selection for AR expression under different androgen
levels and find that low androgen environments, caused either by low serum testosterone or by reduced 5α-reductase
activity, select more strongly for elevated AR expression than do normal environments. High androgen actually slightly
reduces selective pressure for AR upregulation. Moreover, our results suggest that an aberrant androgen environment
may delay progression to a malignant phenotype, but result in a more dangerous cancer should one arise.
Conclusions: The model represents a useful initial framework for understanding the role of androgens in prostate
cancer etiology, and it suggests that low androgen levels can increase selection for phenotypes resistant to hormonal
therapy that may also be more aggressive. Moreover, clinical treatment with 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride
may increase the incidence of therapy resistant cancers.

Background
By the time Theodosius Dobzhansky famously claimed
that "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of
evolution" [1], cancer was already becoming an excellent
illustration of his point. In fact, two decades before
Dobzhansky's claim appeared in print, Law [2] demonstrated that, at least in a mouse model, leukemia develops
resistance to folic acid antagonists by natural selection,
not accommodation. By the mid 1970s the significance of
evolution in tumor progression, pathogenesis, and treatment resistance was maturing [3], with interest in evolu* Correspondence: kuang@asu.edu

tionary oncology exploding the in the 1990s [4-10]. Now,
cancer is increasingly understood to be an evolutionary
phenomenon, although the conditions for evolution by
natural selection have been demonstrated unequivocally
in only one neoplasm--Barrett's esophagus [11].
Until recently it was an open question whether insights
generated by an evolutionary perspective could be translated to the oncology clinic. However, in the last 10 years
a wide variety of potential applications has arisen. Evolutionary models of neoplasia led Gatenby, Gawlinsky and
colleagues [12-14] to hypothesize that tumor-associated
tissue acidosis may be caused by natural selection favoring glycolytic cells in developing carcinomas. Selection
for this property, in turn, facilitates invasion of surround-

ing tissue. Agent-based models studied by Maley and colleagues [15,16] suggest a novel treatment approach-altering the environment to favor benign tumoral and
peritumoral cells, instead of the traditional attacks on
malignant cells, can be an effective adjuvant, or perhaps
primary, anti-cancer treatment. Maley and colleagues
[17] have also shown that ecological measures of clonal
diversity predict progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus in a pattern that is in turn
predicted by evolutionary oncology theory [6,10,17].
More detailed phylogenetic analysis of tumor cell lineages
may shed light on tumor progression in individual
patients [9]. Mathematical models of tumor evolutionary
ecology suggest that if selection is dominated by competition among diverse cell lineages, one lineage may adopt a
"cheater" strategy leading to a "hypertumor"--the cheater
clone growing as a tumor on its parent tumor [8,18,19].
Coevolution among lineages may also produce cooperative cell types that act in some ways like tissues. A similar
pattern may arise if malignant cell lineages diversify to
exploit different resources or changing environments
[10,18].
Despite these contributions, application of an evolutionary perspective to clinical oncology still suffers from a
lack of maturity. In particular, the theory of tumor ecology--the theater in which evolution occurs--is critical, yet
not well characterized for most tumor types [8-10]. One
reason for this hole in our theory is that tumor ecologies
feature unique elements not observed in traditional ecological systems. For example, in prostate cancer, ecological elements like the hormonal environment, redox state,
and tissue inflammation have no obvious counterparts in
an ecosystem as traditionally defined, but may play key
roles in cancer pathology. Androgens, for example, mediate proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and perhaps
inflammation in the prostate, and are therefore likely primary mediators of selective pressure in the evolution of
prostate cancer.
This particular neoplasm is interesting for a number of
reasons in addition to its unique ecological features. It
accounts for 25% of new cancer diagnoses and 10% of
cancer deaths in American men [20]. Most men develop
prostate enlargement at some point in life, and autopsies
show that, worldwide, 90% of men in their 10th decade of
life have developed at least preclinical prostate cancer
[21]. The aggressiveness of diagnosed cancers varies
widely, but over 90% of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed at local or regional stages for which survival
approaches 100% [20]. The natural history of this neoplasm is widely believed to span decades in most men
[21]. This long preclinical phase suggests a typically slow
evolutionary progression toward the malignant phenotype; how ecological factors drive this selective process is
not known.

Androgens, the male sex hormones, have long been central to the study and treatment of prostate cancer. Androgens are essential survival factors for prostate secretory
epithelial cells and act by binding with the androgen
receptor (AR). Testosterone, the primary androgen in the
serum, is converted to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by
the enzyme 5α-reductase in the prostate [22]. Testosterone and DHT both bind to AR, but DHT is more active,
displaying greater binding affinity and stabilization of the
AR complex [23]. Upon binding, androgen:AR complexes
are phosphorylated, dimerize, and translocate to the
nucleus, where they bind to the promoter regions of target genes [24] to modulate the transcriptional activity of
at least several hundred target genes.
The importance of androgens is readily demonstrated by
rat castration models. Following castration, over 70% of
androgen sensitive cells undergo apoptosis [22], and the
prostate epithelial mass decreases dramatically to only 7%
of its original mass at 21 days [25]. Exogenous androgens
induce prostate regrowth [23,26], but high levels of
androgen alone do not generally induce the prostate to
grow beyond its normal size; androgen induced proliferation is apparently regulated by the normal prostate cell
count, although the mechanism for this is unclear [26].
Androgens are essential for normal prostate development, and deficiencies in 5α-reductase can severely
impair prostate development [22]. Not only are androgens essential for prostate development, but changes in
the androgen environment appear to mediate age-associated tissue remodeling. Serum testosterone declines with
age in both the rat and man, leading to heterogeneous tissue remodeling in both animals. In the brown Norway rat
(Rattus norvegicus), spontaneous hyperplasia associated
with increased AR expression in the dorsal and lateral
lobes is observed, while the ventral lobe may atrophy with
age [27]. Men often experience benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a disorder generally considered unrelated to
prostate cancer, that is characterized by extensive hyperplasia of the stroma in the prostate transition zone
[27,28]. Such changes in the microenvironment may alter
the prostate cell turnover, count, genetic instability, and
stress, and thus affect the selective environment that
aging epithelial cells are exposed to. Most clinical prostate cancers are AR-dependent, and this observation has
motivated androgen ablation therapy. Such therapy consists of chemical or surgical castration, which reduces
serum testosterone by up to 95%, but reduces intraprostatic DHT levels by only 50% [22]. More complete androgen blockade can be achieved by supplementing
castration with anti-androgens such as flutamide, nilutamide, and bicalutamide, and such therapy is referred to as
maximal androgen blockade (MAB) [24]. However, the
benefit to MAB over castration is uncertain, and a large
meta-analysis suggested that any additional benefit to

Eikenberry et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:24
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/24

MAB is only slight [29]. Most men respond initially to
androgen ablation, and often experience dramatic cancer
regression. However, most cancers progress to a hormone
refractory (HR) state even with near total androgen ablation, and while time to progression can vary greatly [24],
recurrence occurs on average between 12 and 18 months
following treatment [22]. Most cancers are more aggressive following HR recurrence, there are no effective treatments for such cancers, and average survival following
progression does not exceed 15 months [24]. These cancers are often referred to as androgen independent, but
most retain at least some dependence on the AR for survival.
Several major mechanisms for hormone refractory recurrence have been identified. Modification of AR signaling,
in one form or another, is the dominant theme in HR cancer progression. In a minority of cancers, DNA-based
alterations to the AR allow it to bind to non-canonical
ligands such as estrogen and cortisone, and in some
cases, clinical AR antagonists such as flutamide [30]. AR
gene amplification occurs in perhaps 30% of recurring
HR tumors [22]. However, such genetic alterations do not
occur in the majority of HR cancers. Upregulation of 5αreductase has also been identified as promoting recurrence [31], and overexpression of AR coactivators is associated with progression [22].
Several androgen independent pathways also exist.
Upregulation of bcl-2, bcl-x, and mcl-1 protect against
apoptosis independently of androgens, and expression of
such proteins has been found to increase with cancer progression [32]. Many growth factors can activate signal
transduction cascades that phosphorylate and activate
the AR in a ligand-independent manner [22,30]. Tyrosine
kinase receptor activation can induce survival and proliferation independently of the AR. The epidermal growth
factor (EGF) family of proteins, and in particular HER2,
promote androgen independent cancer growth [22], as
can fibroblast growth factors [33] and insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1) [22].
Upregulation of the AR protein is perhaps the single most
important pathway by which cancers achieve androgen
"independence". Chen et al. [30] found that in 7 prostate
cancer xenograft models, increased androgen receptor
expression was the only change consistently associated
with HR cancer progression. Increased AR levels promoted growth in a ligand-dependent manner. Higher AR
also altered cofactor recruitment to be biased towards
coactivators, and it was even shown that high AR expression converted AR antagonists to weak agonists. Rapid
HR cancer recurrence in a xenograft model by Rocchi et
al. was always associated with increased AR expression
[31].
Castration and androgen blockade in aggressive cancer is
not the only setting in which androgens are manipulated

clinically. 5α-reductase inhibitors are commonly used to
treat both benign prostatic hyperplasia and alopecia (hair
loss). Finasteride (Propecia, Proscar), the most common
5α-reductase inhibitor, is commonly used to treat BPH,
and can reduce prostate volume and improve symptoms
[28]. However, BPH in man is characterized by stromal,
not epithelial, overgrowth [34] and is characterized by an
elevated stroma:epithelium ratio [33,34]. Finasteride
treatment targets the epithelium, with little if any effect
seen on the stroma [34], and it dramatically increases the
prostate stroma:epithelium ratio [28].
Because of their role in protecting against apoptosis and
promoting proliferation and the (transient) efficacy of
androgen ablation therapy, it has long been thought that
high levels of androgens play a causal role in prostate cancer development. The fact that eunuchs and men with
genetic deficiencies in 5α-reductase do not typically
experience prostate cancer, along with the fact that
androgen deprivation causes cancer regression have long
been cited in support of this notion. But, as Raynaud
recently pointed out [35], such scenarios have little if anything to do with cancer development under the normal
physiologic androgen range. In support of the high
androgen hypothesis, in several animal models androgens
were capable of inducing cancer, and some clinical studies have suggested a link between high testosterone and
cancer incidence [26,35].
In 1999, Prehn [26] proposed an alternate hypothesis:
that low levels of androgen creates selective pressure for
prostate cells that are less dependent upon androgen for
growth. Declining levels of androgen could result in
hyperplastic foci resistant to atrophy and susceptible to
further neoplastic transformation. In indirect support of
this hypothesis, a number of clinical studies have failed to
support the notion that high androgen levels increase the
risk of prostate cancer [35-38], and some data suggests
that low serum testosterone is associated with aggressive,
therapy-resistant tumors. In a prospective study including 17,049 men, high serum testosterone did not increase
risk of prostate cancer and lowered the risk of aggressive
tumors [39], and Sofikerim et al. recently found a significantly increased risk of cancer detection in men with low
versus high serum testosterone [36]. Such data has led
many authors to conclude that normal or high androgen
promotes normal differentiation and function in epithelial cells, protecting against rather than promoting carcinogenesis [35,39]. Such results do not necessarily
indicate a causal link between low androgen levels and
carcinogenesis, and other authors have suggested that
low testosterone reflects the poorer health of those experiencing aggressive cancers [40,41].
Although the role of androgens in predicting the incidence of prostate cancer has not been definitively settled,
a broad literature dating from at least 1981 has consis-

tently demonstrated poorer response to hormonal therapy in men with low pre-treatment serum testosterone
[40,42-48]. Testicular atrophy is particularly strongly
associated with aggressive cancers and a very poor
response to therapy [49].
The effect of finasteride, which also modifies the intraprostatic androgen environment, on prostate cancer risk
is unclear and controversial. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) randomly assigned men to receive daily
finasteride (5 mg) or placebo for 7 years. Prostate biopsy
was performed either for elevated adjusted serum PSA or
abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE) findings. Moreover,
all consenting participants were given an end-of-study
biopsy. Finasteride use reduced overall prostate cancer
incidence by 24%, but increased the risk of high-grade
cancer over 7 years: 37% of cancers were high-grade in
the treatment group versus 22% in the placebo group
[50]. This result has sparked much debate over whether
the increased incidence of high-grade tumors was a
pathological artifact. Finasteride significantly reduced the
prostate size in those treated, and reduced prostate size
can increase the probability of cancer detection in biopsy
samples: a lower overall prostate volume increases the
probability that tumor tissue will be present in a biopsy
core. Therefore, a detection bias could explain the
increased rate of high-grade cancer. Lucia et al. [51] have
argued that detection bias and changes in prostate histology induced by finasteride may account for the increased
risk of high-grade tumors seen in the PCPT. However, a
large study by Briganti et al. [52] where prostatectomy
controlled for detection bias indicated that smaller prostates tend to harbor intrinsically more aggressive cancers.
Freedland et al. [53] also found the weight of resected
prostate specimens to be inversely associated with disease grade and risk of progression. These findings suggest
that the increased risk of high-grade cancer seen in the
PCPT may not have been an artifact. A recent review of
RCTs concluded that 5α-reductase treatment reduces
overall cancer incidence but may increase the risk of
high-grade cancer [54]. This issue is particularly relevant,
as a recently published clinical guideline stated that
healthy men may benefit from a discussion of the risks
and benefits of taking finasteride for primary chemoprevention of prostate cancer [55]. In light of these controversies, we focus upon understanding how different
androgen environments promote carcinogenesis.
Several other investigators have used mathematical models to study androgens and prostate cancer. Jackson
[56,57], and later Ideta et al. [58], used models to study
selection for androgen independent strains following
androgen ablation in aggressive prostate cancers. Potter
et al. [59] also developed an exhaustive model of serum
androgen dynamics and their effect on healthy prostate
growth. Unlike Jackson, Ideta, and their colleagues, we

Page 4 of 28

focus not upon the evolution of prostate cancer in
response to hormonal therapy, but rather upon the role
androgens play in the evolutionary theater of early, preclinical prostate cancer.
In particular, we explore the selection process for premalignant phenotypes using a simple mathematical
framework that considers prostate growth mediated by
androgens at both the receptor kinetics level and tissue
growth level; we also model multiple strains competing
within a tissue. In this model, prostate growth is
restricted by the homeostatic prostate size. That is, we
assume that homeostatic mechanisms that prevent
unbounded prostate growth are intact. Therefore, we
consider only the earliest stage of molecular oncogenesis,
where changes in gene expression influence proliferative
or apoptotic activity, but before phenotypes allowing tissue invasion or metastasis have arisen. We model the
chemical kinetics of intracellular androgen conversion
from testosterone to DHT and the binding of these
ligands to the AR. This model is used to inform a tissuelevel model of the proliferation and death of prostate epithelial cells. We characterize the basic dynamics of both
the AR kinetics and the coupled kinetics-growth model.
We determine how both prostate epithelial mass and cell
turnover rates change under different hormone environments.
Finally, this model is applied to an evolving, heterogenous
cell population in which cell strains vary in AR expression. We focus upon the evolution of AR expression
because of its deep importance in hormone therapy resistance and the fact that higher AR expression has been
correlated with higher grade tumors [22,37]. We find that
low serum testosterone strongly selects for greater AR
expression. We also find that treatment with finasteride
(i.e. 5α-reductase inhibition) similarly selects for
increased AR expression. Together, these results suggest
that low androgen environments select more strongly for
hormone therapy resistant and possibly more aggressive
cancer strains than do normal or elevated androgen environments.

Methods
Mathematical Model

We develop a minimal model of proliferation and apoptosis in prostate epithelium mediated by androgens. We
model this on two levels: the first is a chemical kinetics
scheme of the intracellular activity of androgens and their
binding the AR. The second level of the model correlates
the intracellular concentration of DHT:AR and T:AR
complexes with proliferative and apoptotic activity.
Potter et al. [59] developed a thorough model describing
androgenic regulation of prostate growth in the rat, and
we are indebted to their model as a guide.

Chemical Kinetics Model

The intracellular chemical kinetics model is outlined as
follows:
1. Free testosterone influx into the prostate is an
empirical function of serum testosterone concentration, and this testosterone is uniformly distributed to
the intracellular compartment of all prostate cells.
2. Free intracellular testosterone is converted to free
DHT by the enzyme 5α-reductase. The intraprostatic
5α-reductase level is assumed to be a constant.
3. Free testosterone and DHT both degrade according
to first-order kinetics.
4. Free testosterone and DHT bind to AR to form
T:AR and DHT:AR complexes according to mass
action kinetics. These complexes do not degrade.
5. Intracellular free AR binds to testosterone and
DHT according to mass action kinetics, degrades by
first order kinetics, and is produced at a rate that
depends upon the homeostatic AR concentration and
current free AR concentration.
The following variables are considered:
1. TS(t) = Total serum testosterone concentration
(nM),
2. R(t) = Free intracellular androgen receptor concentration (nM),
3. T (t) = Free intracellular testosterone concentration
(nM),
4. D(t) = Free intracellular DHT concentration (nM),
5. CT:R(t) = T:AR complex concentration (nM),
6. CD:R(t) = DHT:AR complex concentration (nM).
The basic mass action binding between T and DHT with
AR and the conversion from T to DHT by 5α-reductase is
illustrated schematically as

The rate of AR production is given as λ, and AR, T, and
DHT degrade at rates βR, βT, and βD, respectively. 5αreductase converts T to DHT by Michaelis-Menten
enzyme kinetics, where α is the concentration of 5αreductase, kcat is the turnover number, i.e. the maximum
rate at which T is converted to DHT by each unit of
enzyme, and KM is the Michaelis constant. Parameters

k a , k d , k a , k d are the mass action rate constants for T

and DHT binding to AR.
We have also assumed that all prostate androgens are
intracellular and uniformly distributed among the epithelial cells. We ignore all the details of transport between
serum, extracellular, and intracellular compartments, and
instead have testosterone transported directly into the
intracellular compartment. We leave U, the rate of testosterone influx into the intracellular prostate compartment, an unspecified function of the serum testosterone
level,
U = U(TS ).

The exact form for this function is determined empirically in the section on parametrization. Serum testosterone (TS), while in reality a function of time, is always
imposed in our model and does not vary according to a
governing ODE. Significantly, we have not modeled
dimerization of androgen:AR complexes or their nuclear
localization and binding to gene promoter regions under
the assumption that the concentrations of androgen:AR
complexes can be taken as surrogates for such activities.
We assume that prostate cells maintain a constant concentration of total AR (the sum of bound and unbound
AR). We define Rt as the homeostatic AR concentration,
and at steady state we have:
R t = R + C T : R + C D: R ,

(2)

(7)

Eikenberry et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:24

Moreover, we assume that total AR concentration is
maintained at Rt by modification of the AR production
rate, λ, as follows:

where β R is the normal AR turnover rate. A more exten-

sive discussion of this assumption is included in the AR
kinetics parametrization section.
We also pay special attention to the effect of 5α-reductase inhibition by finasteride. Finasteride is a competitive
inhibitor of 5α-reductase, implying that it increases the
effective KM. The rate of conversion from T to DHT by
5α-reductase is modified to

Prostate Growth Model

We now link intracellular androgen concentrations to the
proliferation and apoptosis of prostate epithelial cells.
While we generally refer to low or high androgen levels
causing a behavior, it is really the concentrations of AR:T
and AR:DHT complexes that mediate these androgen
related activities. We introduce the variable Ct to represent the "effective" androgen:AR concentration. In [60],
DHT was 2.4 times as potent as T in maintaining prostate
weight and duct lumen mass, and these quantities varied
linearly with the concentration of either androgen.
Therefore, we take Ct to be a simple linear combination of
CT:R and CD:R,
C t = C T :R + 2.4C D:R .

(10)

Thus, Ct has units of nM and represents the concentration of AR:T equivalents. This approach allows the previously developed androgen kinetics model (equations 1-6)
to be coupled directly to a model of prostate growth
mediated by androgens. We let P(t) represent the number
of prostate epithelial cells. We assume that the change in
P is governed by two distinct death and proliferation signals; the per-capita proliferation rate is M(Ct, S) and the

per-capita death rate is N(Ct, S), implying the basic model
framework:
dP
= PM(C t , S) − PN(C t , S),
dt

(11)

where S represents oxidative stress. We now determine
the formal forms for M(Ct, S) and N(Ct, S). Prostate epithelial proliferation and death are regulated by androgens
in several ways:
1. Androgens induce the prostate stroma to produce
factors, mainly bFGF and FGF-7, that support epithelial growth in a paracrine manner by supporting the
prostate vasculature, inducing epithelial proliferation,
protecting the epithelium from apoptosis, and regulating AR protein levels.
2. Androgens may have a direct mitogenic effect upon
epithelial cells through upregulation of proteins
required for cell cycle progression.
3. Androgens directly protect against apoptosis by
negatively regulating TGF-β and increasing bcl-2 levels.
4. Androgens mediate oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within epithelial cells which can induce proliferation, stasis, or
death, depending upon the concentration.
In response to androgen withdrawal, rat prostate mass
decreases dramatically through both apoptosis and atrophy. For modest androgen ablation, cellular atrophy and
loss of prostatic fluid through loss of secretory function is
primarily responsible for lost mass [60]. More extreme
ablation, typically through castration, results in rapid and
widespread epithelial cell apoptosis [22,25,61].
Androgens clearly protect against epithelial apoptosis.
TGF-β expression by prostate epithelium is negatively
regulated by androgen [61], and this factor appears to be
necessary for apoptosis in response to low androgen [22].
bFGF produced by the stroma in response to androgens
increases prostatic bcl-2 [22], an important anti-apoptosis protein that has also been implicated in late-stage
prostate cancer progression [30]. Androgens also positively regulate the expression of a number of proteins that
protect against apoptosis and downregulate others that
induce apoptosis, such as TIMP3 [62].
It is generally accepted that androgens induce epithelial
proliferation in vivo when the cell count is below normal,
and androgen administration following castration
induces rapid prostate regrowth in the rat [23,61]. However, proliferation is thought to be limited, at least to
some degree, by the homeostatic size of the prostate
[26,63]. It is unclear to what extent androgens are directly
mitogenic for prostate epithelium, since much of the
mitogenic effect is due to stroma-epithelium interactions

Eikenberry et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:24
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/24

mediated by androgens, and many in vitro studies have
failed to demonstrate epithelial proliferation in response
to androgen alone [64]. Several proteins required for cell
cycle progression are positively regulated by androgens
(cyclin D1, cdc2, PCNA), as are several that inhibit the
cell cycle (geminin, GADD45γ) [62]. Androgens induce
stromal production of bFGF and FGF-7, which have weak
and strong mitogenic effects on the epithelium, respectively [33]. Interestingly, bFGF also reduces levels of AR
in prostate epithelium, and while bFGF independently
induces epithelial proliferation, it can slow androgen
induced growth [65]. bFGF and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) both are produced by the stroma in
response to androgens and play an essential role in supporting the prostate vasculature [22].
Many studies focusing on the rat ventral prostate have
suggested that high androgen levels alone can induce
prostate epithelial cell hypertrophy but not hyperplasia
[66]. Several studies by Banerjee et al. [27,67] on the
brown Norway rat demonstrated that high androgen
could induce hyperplasia in the lateral and dorsal prostate
lobes, but not the ventral, and that this was related to
increased AR expression in these lobes. Furthermore,
aging was correlated with spontaneous hyperplasia in the
dorsal and lateral lobes despite declining serum testosterone levels [27,66]. This hyperplasia was itself correlated
with increased AR expression [27]. Saturation of the AR
by its ligand therefore may be at least partially responsible for the failure of excess androgen to induce hyperplasia under normal conditions. This notion is supported by
our model parametrization, where we estimate the normal intracellular concentrations of AR and DHT to be 45
nM and about 40-60 nM, respectively. An alteration in
the testosterone:estrogen ratio in the aging rat was also
suggested as having a possible causal connection to
hyperplasia.
Thus, while normal prostate cell count is generally maintained, age-associated changes in the hormonal milieu
and AR levels are likely able to induce hyperplasia and
excessive androgen-induced proliferation. In our model,
we assume that high levels of androgen directly induce
proliferation while low levels cause apoptosis.
The prostate redox state is also influenced by androgens,
and this may be deeply important in epithelial death, proliferation, and carcinogenesis. The mitochondria are the

tions [68]. Ubiquitous ROS include O •− , H2O2 and the
2
hydroxyl radical (HO•) [69].
Androgen blockade induces the production of ROS and
subsequent oxidative stress. Both finasteride and flutamide (an anti-androgen) dramatically increased the
expression of the pro-oxidant enzyme L-amino oxidase-1
(LaO1), which generates H2O2, in the rat ventral prostate
[70]. Tam et al. [69] showed that rat castration results in
dramatic upregulation of ROS generating NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and downregulation of ROS-detoxifying
enzymes, including superoxides dismutase 2 (SOD2) and
thioredoxin. Androgen re-administration restored antioxidant defenses, but only partially reduced NOX expression. Several other antioxidant proteins were not affected
by castration, but were upregulated upon androgen readministration. Pang et al. [71] also found that the
expression of a number of antioxidant genes was downregulated following rat castration and suggested that this
is a possible mechanism for castration-induced apoptosis.
Vascular regression caused by androgen withdrawal precedes epithelial apoptosis, causing hypoxia and a dramatic increase in hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)
[72]. Hypoxia impairs aerobic respiration, increasing
mitochondrial ROS production. Such mitochondrial ROS
is required for stabilization of HIF-1α [73]. Thus, in addition to direct effects on redox related enzymes, a low
androgen environment also increases ROS levels by
inducing a hypoxic environment.
Androgen administration has also been shown to induce
oxidative stress. Tam et al. [74] found that administration
of testosterone with 17β-estradiol increased several
NOXs, nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), resulting in oxidative and nitrosative
stress in the lateral lobe of the Noble rat. Ripple et al. [75]
found that physiologic levels of DHT induced ROS in the
LNCaP carcinoma cell line, and ROS generation preceded DHT induced proliferation. Thus, a normal androgen environment likely promotes a balance between
antioxidant and pro-oxidant activity [69], but both low
and high androgen environments are pro-oxidant. Therefore, in our model we assume that both low and high levels of androgen induce the formation of reactive oxygen
species.
At low levels, ROS act as important intracellular signalling molecules. A number of transcription factors,
including NF-κB and AP-1 are redox sensitive, and modest levels of ROS are mitogenic. Davies [76] reported that
exposure of fibroblasts to 3-15 μM of H2O2 resulted in a
mitotic response, while levels an order of magnitude
higher (250-400 μM H2O2) induced permanent growth

arrest. Very high levels of H2O2 caused either apoptosis
(500-1000 μM) or necrosis (5-10 mM).
We assume both low and high concentrations of Ct
induce ROS and that there is some background level of
ROS independent of androgens. We choose S to represent ROS and formally take,

proliferation signal due to direct stimulation by androgens should increase monotonically with Ct, but given the
biophysical limitations on the rate that cells can grow and
divide, it must be bounded for large Ct. The commonly
used Hill function is a reasonable heuristic choice that

(12)

satisfies these criteria. Since androgens have an array of
mitotic effects we expect some cooperativity in the over-

Here, μ is the background ROS level, and ROS is induced
by both low Ct and high Ct according to the first and second Hill functions, respectively. The half-maximal Ct for
ROS induction by low androgen is θ1, and θ2 is the halfmaximal Ct for high androgen induced ROS. We leave the
Hill coefficients n and m nspecified at this point. We
leave S a unit-less measure, but for future parametrization we could let S represent, for example, H2O2 equivalents with units μM.
Broadly, we assume that prostate proliferation is induced
by increasing concentrations of such complexes, and a
high cell count inhibits proliferation. Low AR:ligand
complex concentration induces apoptosis, and there is
always some small baseline turnover rate (1-2% of cells
turnover daily in the healthy prostate [22]). We assume
that modest levels of ROS induce proliferation, while
higher levels cause growth arrest and apoptosis. These
assumptions lead to our formal choices for M(Ct, S) and
N(Ct, S),

a sigmoidal response curve. Any Hill coefficient greater
than 1 would yield a sigmoidal curve--we use 2 as a first
approximation. Thus we arrive at the function
2
C t2 / (ϕ1 + C t2 ) .
The proliferation signal due to ROS must pass through
the origin, i.e. the response must be 0 when the ROS level
is 0. It should be large for low S and, since growth arrest
occurs at high ROS concentrations, it should attenuate as
S becomes large. Qualitatively, the function ϕSexp(1 - ϕS)
gives this behavior.
Finally, proliferation is attenuated as a nonlinear rate by
the presence of other epithelial cells, and we use the term
-σP to represent this growth inhibition. This secondorder attenuation of growth is equivalent to a logistic
model, and a possible alternative approach would be to
attenuate M(Ct, S) according to an explicit logistic term
with a carrying capacity. This term prevents unbounded
growth and causes prostate epithelial count to have an
equilibrium point for any Ct and S.

Now consider N(Ct, S), the per-capital death rate. The
(13)

death rate due to low androgen must increase monotonically as Ct decreases. Since such death is generally due to
the orderly process of apoptosis, it will occur at a finite

maximum rate when Ct = 0. Similar to the mitotic signal,

response to ROS: Sq/(ωq + Sq). Apoptosis also occurs at
the background per-capita rate of δ0:
Our incorporation of S as a function of Ct into the equation for dP/dt allows both the direct and indirect ROS
mediated effects of androgens on prostate growth to be
incorporated into a single differential equation. This construction is somewhat similar to the ecological model of
planktonic algae interaction with vegetation in shallow
lakes by Scheffer et al. [77].
Prostate Evolution Model

Because of the importance of the AR in prostate cancer
progression, we investigate how different androgen environments select for cell strains expressing different levels
of the AR, i.e. we examine selection upon Rt. To model
competition between a large number of cell strains that
evolve in time, we propose a state-transition model where
cells transition between states that each represent a different level of Rt expression. To derive the model, we
make the following assumptions:
1. All epithelial cells express a constant amount of the
AR (Rt). Cells can mutate to express more or less AR.
Each mutation changes AR expression by only a small
amount.
2. There are a finite number of prostate epithelial
strains, each of which expresses a different level of the
AR. A strain is defined by the level of AR expression.
Therefore, mutation causes cells to transition
between strains (or states).
3. All cells within each strain proliferate and die
according to the prostate-growth model.
More formally, we define a set of states:
{Pi}Q .
i =1

(15)

Each state represents a strain of prostate cells that express
a different total AR concentration (i.e. Rt), and Rt varies
linearly with i. Cells transition from Pi to Pi-1 and Pi+1 at
first-order rate γ, representing mutation. The effective
androgen concentration for strain i, C t i , is determined
according the chemical kinetics model, as is the ROS
level, Si. Populations of each strain grow according to the
prostate-growth model. The growth model is modified so
that each strain grows independently, but growth is attenuated according to the total prostate cell count, ΣPi. Formally,

(16)

For example, assume that there are 100 states (Q = 100)
representing epithelial cell strains with Rt ranging from 15
to 114 nM. The cells in, say, state 50, have Rt = 64 nM. The
cells in this state mutate out of the state at rate 2γ, representing even distribution to states 49 and 51. Moreover,
cells from state 49 and from state 51 each mutate into
state 50 at rate γ. In state 49, Rt = 63 nM and in state 51, Rt
= 65 nM. Proliferation and death occurs in each state
according to the growth model, as represented by the
Pi M(C t i , S i ) − Pi N(C t i , S i ) terms.

This approach is designed to predict how quickly the
average level of AR expression in the prostate will
increase under different androgen environments, and to
what level the AR will ultimately be expressed. The average level of AR expression for the prostate as a whole is
calculated as a weighted average:

AR Kinetics Parametrization

Since we impose serum T (TS), we need to know the likely
physiologic range of this variable. In brown Norway rats,
serum T averaged 5.03 nM and 4.85 nM in young rats and
3.19 and 2.77 nM in old rats in [78] and [66]. Therefore,
3-6 nM is the likely normal physiologic range of serum T
in rats.
We note that there are a number of published values for
testosterone and DHT serum and prostate concentrations for both humans and rats. In [79], serum T was 4.95
nM, serum DHT was 1.3 nM, prostate T was 11.8 nM,
and prostate DHT was 40.6 nM for the rat. Other authors
have reported intraprostatic DHT concentrations 15-20
times T concentration [60]. In the rat, prostate T and
DHT concentrations were 2.15 nM and 61.29 nM in [60]
and 1.8 nM and 53 nM in [25]. In man, prostate T and
DHT were 1.5 nM and 18.2 nM in [34]. Prostate testoster-

tate carcinoma, the KD of 0.5 nM for DHT was similar to
normal tissues, but the dissociation half-lives for of 60 hr
and 160 hr for testosterone and DHT, respectively, were
much longer [81]. Nevertheless, testosterone always dissociates from the AR 2.5 to 3 times faster than DHT does
[81].

The AR is unstable in the absence of its ligand. Gregory et
al. [82] studied several androgen-dependent and recurrent cancer lines, and found that greater AR stability in
the absence of ligand was associated with recurrence.
Without ligand, the degradation half-life of AR was 3.0
hrs in androgen dependent LNCaP cells, and was greater
than 12 hrs for recurrent CWR22 cells, a half-life reportedly comparable to that in the presence of ligand.
In the absence of any direct estimates, we use the following method to estimate the AR concentration within
prostate cells. Wilson and French [80] reported a supernatant AR content in the rat prostate of 80-140 fmol/mg
cytosol protein, and an AR content of 80-150 fmol/mg
cytosol protein was reported for the rat Dunning R-3327
androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma [81]. A cDNA
encoding the AR predicts a MW of 98,918 [83], and there
are 200-300 g/L of protein in cellular interiors [84]. From
this, it can be calculated that 1 fmol AR/mg cytosol protein corresponds to an intracellular concentration of 0.20.3 nM, and intracellular AR concentration is likely
between 16 and 45 nM. This yields the likely total AR
concentration, Rt, which equals R + CT:R + CD:R.
The influx of free testosterone into the prostate, U, is
determined as an empirical function of serum testosterone based upon the data of Wright et al. [60], who measured intraprostatic testosterone and DHT

concentrations as functions of serum testosterone in castrated rats both with and without treatment with the 5αreductase inhibitor finasteride; this data is shown in Figure 1. We use the data-set where finasteride was present,
and since almost no DHT was produced we simply take α
= 0 (in reality, the effective KM has been made very large).
We also ignore AR production and degradation and
impose the total AR concentration Rt = 16-45 nM, leaving
U as the only free parameter. Running the system to
steady state then allows U to be determined as a function
of TS and Rt, as shown in Figure 2. A higher Rt implies a
lower influx U, as when more AR is present, more androgen is bound and thus degrades more slowly. To determine α (5α-reductase concentration) and βD (DHT
degradation rate), the data-set of Wright et al. where finasteride was not present is used in conjunction with the
empirically determined function U. We have found that
setting Rt = 45 nM and using the corresponding function
for U gives the best fit to the data. A good algebraic fit to
the U curve for Rt = 45 nM is

This is also indicated in Figure 1. From this data-set, we
also estimate that α = 5 mg L-1 and βD = ln(2)/9 hr-1. The
half-life of DHT in the rat prostate is reportedly greater
than 6 hours [61]; a degradation rate of βD = ln(2)/9 hr-1 is
consistent with this. Using these parameters, the predicted T and DHT concentration versus the actual concentration as a function of serum testosterone is shown in
Figure 3. Predicted T and DHT concentrations for total
5α-reductase blockade (α = 0) versus actual values for
finasteride treatment are also shown in Figure 3.
This parametrization shows that when the total AR concentration is a constant, a good fit to the data can be
made, and suggests that AR production is regulated
according to some homeostatic set point. We have been
unable to favorably compare our results to the data of
Wright et al. [60] if AR production, i.e. λ, is a constant.

for U(TS) with Rt = 45 nM is also indicated.

This implies that AR production may be positively regulated by free AR, or alternatively and more realistically,
negatively regulated by androgen:AR complexes.
Indeed, AR mRNA and protein levels are clearly regulated by androgens, and this has mainly been studied in
rat models of castration and androgen reintroduction. It
has been consistently shown that AR mRNA levels
increase dramatically following castration [27,85-87] and
that androgens down-regulate AR mRNA in a receptormediated fashion [85]. However, castration also dramatically reduces AR protein levels [27,63,88]. Doorn et al.
found that subsequent reintroduction of androgen rapidly increases the concentration of nuclear AR bound
androgen, and the AR protein level rebounds to the precastration level within 2 days [63]. Steinsapir et al. found
that cytosolic AR was replenished within 3 hours of testosterone reintroduction, and proposed that testosterone
regulates AR levels through its effect upon receptor halflife [89].
Consistent with these results, Mora et al. [87] showed
that, in previously castrated rats, administration of testosterone increased nuclear AR concentration after 1 hr.
Testosterone administration for 1 hr did not affect mRNA
levels, and positive regulation of transcriptional activity
was ruled out as the underlying mechanism. Furthermore, inhibiting protein synthesis inhibited the increase

in AR, and Mora et al. concluded that AR protein synthesis was involved in the mechanism for AR protein
increase following testosterone administration.
Since AR binding to androgen greatly increases its stability, androgen administration could increase the level of
AR protein by increasing its stability. These results are
collectively consistent with the notion that mRNA production and AR protein synthesis are both negatively regulated by androgens, but that a nonlinear decrease in the
stability of AR occurs for very low androgen concentration. We have examined the production rate, λ, and effecEffective

very low androgen concentrations, and that the effective
turnover rate does indeed increase nonlinearly as serum
testosterone goes to 0. This result may explain the contradictory results that variously imply positive or negative
regulation of AR by androgens and the puzzling disconnect between increased AR mRNA levels but decreased
protein levels seen after castration.
While such results imply that the AR level is not constant,
castration is an extreme scenario (especially in the rat),
and since AR levels rebound shortly after androgen reintroduction [63,89], it is likely that the AR level is actually
relatively constant except in the case of extreme androgen
deprivation. Therefore, we assume that there exists some
homeostatic AR concentration, Rt, that along with CT:R
and CD:R determines the AR production rate

λ = β R(Rt − C TR − C DR ),

where β R is the normal AR turnover rate.

Growth Model Parametrization

The growth of the prostate epithelium, in our model, is
governed solely by the intraprostatic weighted AR:ligand
complex concentration, Ct, and the prostate cell count,
P(t). There are two independent proliferation signals, one
mediated by Ct and the other by S, and two similar death
signals. In addition, the summed proliferation signal is
attenuated by crowding and there is a background death
rate. The shapes of these signals are collectively determined by the parameters θ1, θ2, φ1, φ2, ϕ, ω, n, m, and q.
We have chosen values for these parameters based upon
our determination of physiologic (and super- and subphysiologic) parameter values for serum T and prostatic
AR and the resulting Cts; they are reported in Table 2. We
view these, therefore, as a first approximation.
Oxidative stress, S, is shown as a function of Ct in Figure
4. Figure 5 shows the proliferation and death signals
directly due to Ct and S. It also shows the proliferation
and death signals mediated by S as a function of Ct, since
S is itself a function of Ct. Such curves emphasize that Ct
is the ultimate mediator of all proliferation and death
(besides crowding effects) in our model. These figures

Results and Discussion

centration of AR; an example is shown in Figure 7. While
this qualitative pattern is consistent, the absolute levels of
bound androgens increase linearly with AR concentration
regardless of serum testosterone.

Basic Dynamics of the AR Kinetics Model

Sensitivity of AR Kinetic Parameters

We briefly characterize the basic dynamics of the AR
kinetics model. The time-dependent dynamics of the
model are demonstrated by initially setting Rt to a constant and all other variables to 0. Serum T concentration
is prescribed, and the model is run to steady state, as
shown in Figure 6. For baseline parameter values, the free
T concentration is always small, as most T is rapidly converted to DHT. There is a transient peak in T:AR complex
concentration early in time, but the DHT:AR complex
dominates within several days; this pattern is a consequence of the time it takes 5α-reductase to produce DHT.
For physiologic values of serum T and prostate AR, once
steady state is reached most androgen is bound its receptor, and nearly all intraprostatic androgen is DHT. These
dynamics are biologically expected.
At steady state, most AR is bound at physiological levels
of serum testosterone. For superphysiological serum testosterone, intraprostatic free DHT increases while
AR:ligand complex concentration levels off; intraprostatic free T also increases modestly with high serum T.
This qualitative pattern is observed regardless of the con-

We examine how altering several central parameters in
the kinetics model influences the steady state AR:ligand
concentrations under different androgen environments.
Lea and French [81] found that while the KD for DHT:AR
binding was the same in carcinomas as in normal tissue,
the actual on/off rates were much slower. In our model,
changes in the on/off rates do not affect the steady state
as long as the KDs remain constant, suggesting slower
rates offer no benefit to carcinoma growth. However, our
model does not take into account the effect of increased
complex life-spans, and it may be useful to consider average life-span in future work.
We examine the parameters associated with 5α-reductase: α, kcat, and KM and η (i.e. effective KM). All affect the
steady state in a similar manner and change the ratio of
DHT:total androgen in a nonlinear manner. The total
amount of androgen in the prostate also decreases modestly in a nonlinear fashion when 5α-reductase is inhibited.
Finally, we investigate the degradation rates of R, T, and
D. We find that for normal physiologic serum T, only βD,

the degradation rate of DHT, has any significant effect on
either total prostate androgen or the ratio of DHT:T; both
decrease dramatically with increasing βD. At low serum T,
βR, the degradation rate of free AR, is also important.
Increasing βR significantly reduces total androgen, but
does not affect the DHT:T ratio. Modifying the rate at
which free T degrades, βT, has only minor effects.
Gregory et al. [82] found that increased AR stability in
the absence of ligand was associated with recurrence of
androgen-dependent cancer cell lines. Our model supports the notion that in a low androgen environment,
increasing the stability of free AR (i.e. reducing βR) will
augment the response to androgens by increasing the
concentration of receptor bound androgen. Therefore,
increasing the half-life of the free AR is one pathway
through which cancers may overcome androgen blockade.

Steady State Cell Count, Turnover

We now examine the model dynamics at the prostate
growth level. The steady state prostate mass as a function
of serum testosterone for different levels of Rt is shown in
Figure 8, and mass as a function of Rt for different serum
T levels is given in Figure 9. Units have been converted
from cell count to approximate mass, but due to the ad
hoc parametrization of the growth model the absolute
numbers are unimportant - it is the shapes of the curves
that matter. We emphasize that we are not attempting to
relate these curves to any specific data, but instead are
exploring the qualitative behavior that results in a model
derived from biological principles.
For higher levels of serum testosterone, prostate mass
peaks at some level of Rt and then declines. This decline
occurs because the growth signal induced directly by
androgens saturates for high Rt (or Ct) while ROS levels
increase. This causes the ROS proliferation signal to
attenuate, while the death signal increases in magnitude.

fixed at 45 nM.

While at steady state dP/dt = 0, i.e. there is no net growth
or death, the internal cell turnover rate varies with Rt and
TS. This will affect the rate at which evolution can occur,
as greater cell turnover will presumably increase the rate
at which mutations accumulate. Lower androgen always
increases the turnover rate in this model. Figure 10 shows
turnover as a function of serum T for several levels of 5αreductase inhibition.
We have performed a sensitivity analysis of all the growth
model parameters and found that the qualitative shapes
of the mass and turnover curves are preserved.
Evolution and Selection for Elevated AR Expression

We use the state-transition model for the evolution of AR
expression to determine how different androgen environments influence the prostate-wide evolution of AR
expression. We choose our model to have 100 states representing Rt from 15 to 114 nM. That is, we set Q = 100
and Rt i , the total AR level at state i, to be 14 + i nM, i 8
{1,2,...,100}. The total number of cells in each state is
tracked through time, and the average Rt at all time steps
is calculated. Figure 11 shows the evolution of average Rt

under different serum T levels. 5α-reductase inhibition,
e.g., through finasteride treatment, also induces a low
androgen environment, and Figure 12 shows how evolution changes under increasing values of η (increasing
effective KM).
In general, our results indicate that physiologic serum T
selects for modestly increased AR expression, as do all
androgen environments. Therefore, the model predicts
that even in healthy men, prostate epithelial cells will
increase their AR expression and hence potential for
malignancy with time. Under high serum T, selection for
an elevated Rt is actually slighter weaker. In comparison,
low androgen environments (i.e. low serum T or low 5αreductase) demonstrate the greatest selection for
increased AR expression. Generally, the widespread
appearance of strains expressing high levels of AR occurs
abruptly and later in time than under normal androgen
levels. While this selection occurs later in time, a higher
average Rt is ultimately obtained.
We have performed a sensitivity analysis to determine
whether this behavior is preserved under different
growth model parameter values. We have found that the
prediction that low androgen selects for a greater final Rt

Figure 8 Steady state prostate mass as a function of serum testosterone for different levels of Rt. Note that below Rt = 25 nM mass quickly
decreases for all serum T, while there is a reasonable stable region between 25 and 45 nM, after which mass increases roughly linearly with Rt before
leveling off. For higher values of Rt than those displayed, increases in serum T can cause a reduction in prostate mass (see Figure 9).

is always preserved. The parameters θ1, θ2, and μ, which
govern the level of ROS, have the greatest effect on the
dynamics. Increasing μ, the background ROS level,
causes low androgen to select for higher Rt earlier in time.
Decreasing θ2, which implies higher ROS for relatively
lower levels of Ct, also decreases the time to selection for
Rt. Increasing θ1, which implies ROS is elevated under a
lesser degree of androgen insufficiency, changes the
dynamics most significantly. Large values of θ1 result in a
two-phase pattern of selection for high Rt in low androgen environments: AR initially increases slowly, there is a
sudden jump, and finally increases slowly again. This and
a more typical pattern of AR evolution for low versus
high androgen environments are shown in Figure 13.
Overall, low androgen appears to select for a greater final
Rt in all parameter space, and this selection becomes
apparent later in time than under normal androgen for
most parameter space.
These results suggest that a low androgen environment
may delay the development of a malignant phenotype,
but result in a more malignant or therapy-resistant strain
later in time. This result could also be interpreted to
mean that low androgen reduces the overall incidence of
cancer, as the expected time to the development of a
malignant strain is increased, but those cancers that do

arise may be more aggressive. This notion is consistent
with the results of finasteride treatment in men [50].

Conclusions
We have developed a preliminary model of the binding
kinetics of prostate androgens, their relationship to proliferation and death in the prostate epithelium, and the
evolution of AR expression, and hence malignant potential, in different androgen environments. Thus, we have
modeled prostate carcinogenesis at three distinct scales.
At the receptor kinetics scale, we have described the
essential interactions between T, DHT, and AR, and have
fully parameterized this model using biological data. At
the prostate organ level, we have taken both the direct
and indirect ROS mediated effects of androgens on epithelial proliferation and apoptosis into account. At the
highest scale, we have employed a state-transition model
to study selection between epithelial strains expressing
different levels of AR, and whose behavior is determined
by the coupled AR kinetics and prostate growth model.
Results using this evolutionary modeling framework have
suggested that a low androgen environment caused either
by low serum testosterone or clinical intervention with
5α-reductase inhibitors can increase selection for AR
overexpression in prostate epithelium, while high androgens may weakly protect against AR overexpression. As a

whole, the clinical literature and our theoretical results
suggest the following hypothesis: that low intraprostatic
AR:ligand concentrations, caused either by low serum
testosterone or 5-α reductase inhibition, drive evolution
towards decreased dependence upon androgens in prostate epithelium, therefore increasing the risk of cancer
that is resistant to hormonal therapy. Moreover, such
cancers may arise later in life than those cancers with
lower sensitivity to androgens.
We must emphasize the preliminary nature of the model,
and there are likely many ways to model the phenomenon
that we are studying. We have used only one approach,
and there is much room for improvement as well as
future work. In particular, we have not (explicitly) modeled the essential interactions between stromal and epithelial cells that mediate prostate growth. Moreover, we
have ignored the heterogenous architecture of the prostate. Not only do different prostate lobes display different
responses to androgens [66,67], but prostate epithelial
cells are exposed to different levels of androgen and are
differentially sensitive to such hormones.
We have not explicitly modeled the role of the prostate
vasculature. Delivery of testosterone from the serum to
the prostate is dependent upon prostate size and the state
of the vasculature, both of which are themselves regulated by prostatic androgen, and vascular regression pre-

cedes prostate involution in castration models [22,72].
We have taken this into account to some degree through
the use of an empirical function to describe testosterone
flux into the prostate as a function of serum testosterone,
as prostate weight is also a function of serum testosterone. However, we have assumed homogenous delivery to
all cells, and considering the spatial dynamics of testosterone delivery is an important potential modification
to the model. Moreover, vascular regression causes
hypoxia and induces oxidative stress, which we have also
partially taken into account by making S increase with
low androgen, but hypoxia is also likely spatially heterogeneous.
While much mechanistic and spatial complexity has been
ignored, the relative simplicity of our model of tissuelevel prostate growth is also a strength in that it allows
several of the competing effects of androgens on prostate
epithelium--i.e., oxidative stress, proliferation, apoptosis-to be subsumed into a single differential equation. Thus,
the model includes the essential effects of androgens with
minimum complexity, and the qualitative effects of
androgens on the prostate epithelium can be explored in
a minimal formal setting. However, we have not rigorously parametrized this level of the model, although its
qualitative behavior is preserved over a wide range of
parameter values. It follows that a weakness of the model

Figure 11 Evolution of average Rt in the state-transition model under different serum T. AR expression is presumably a marker for the malignant potential of a strain. Low serum T selects for higher Rt than the normal environment (serum T = 5 nM), but takes longer to do so. High serum T
selects for a slightly lower Rt.

framework, in its current form, is the difficulty in confronting the model with quantitative data other than in
regards to its qualitative predictions.
Our parametrization and investigation of the AR kinetics
model has yielded some insight into AR dynamics. Our
parametrization suggests that AR levels are constant
under the physiologic range of serum androgens. We
have found that increased stability of free AR has little
effect on AR dynamics under normal androgen levels, but
in a state of androgen deprivation, increased stability of
the free receptor significantly increases intraprostatic
AR:ligand concentrations, implying a role for such a
modification in HR cancer, as seen in [82]. Moreover,
decreasing 5α-reductase activity (through either α, kcat,
or KM), can decrease AR:ligand concentrations in a nonlinear manner.
In our model, when serum T is low or 5α-reductase is
inhibited, the prostate epithelial cell mass is much lower.
Thus, there is simply less substrate for selection to act
upon when serum T is low. However, in such an environment the cell turnover rate is higher. Therefore, mutations may arise more rapidly and be selected for more
quickly in a low androgen environment despite the lower
cell count.

This, along with the results from our state-transition
model, support the notion that low androgen levels can
induce selection for phenotypes with increased AR
expression. Such a phenotype may be considered to have
a higher potential for malignancy or be "pre-malignant."
In particular, such a phenotype is likely to be resistant to
androgen ablation therapy, and a great deal of experimental and clinical literature supports the notion that low
androgen levels induce treatment resistant cancers. Several studies by Labrie et al. [90,91] on mouse mammary
carcinoma cells cultured in different concentrations of
DHT demonstrated that a single tumor line can yield
wide phenotypic variety in sensitivity to DHT (KM for
growth varied up to 1,250-fold in [90]) and that low DHT
concentration selected for clones that were hypersensitive to androgen, requiring minuscule DHT levels for
growth. Such hypersensitive clones would likely demonstrate little if any response to androgen blockade.
A number of clinical studies have shown that low testosterone levels predict a poor response to androgen deprivation. In 1981, Adlercreutz et al. [43] found that men
with lower serum testosterone had a poorer response to
androgen deprivation. A number studies over the following decade consistently found low serum testosterone to
be associated with poor responses and shorter survival

[40,42,44,45,48]. In one study of metastatic cancer, pretreatment serum T was a stronger predictor of treatment
response than the extent of bone metastases [46,47]. Furthermore, in some cases high serum T predicted a better
response to therapy [43,48].
Daniell [49] reported men with testicular atrophy presented with highly undifferentiated tumors and had a
much worse prognosis following orchiectomy than those
without atrophy. In a study of Japanese men, those with
metastatic cancer had higher serum T levels than those
with non-metastatic cancer, but high T predicted a good
response to hormonal therapy [92]. Several studies have
also found that in clinically localized prostate cancer a
low pretreatment serum T is associated with a more
advanced pathological stage and increases the probability
of non-organ confined disease [93-95].
Many studies also suggest that low serum testosterone
not only predicts a poor response to hormonal therapy,
but also increases the risk of prostate cancer. Men with
low free and total testosterone levels had a significantly
higher rate of cancer than those with high serum testoserone [36]. Schatzl et al. found that not only did men with
low testosterone have more aggressive cancers, but AR
expression was also elevated in these patients [37].
On the other hand, several authors have concluded that
low serum testosterone predicting more advanced disease or poorer response to therapy simply reflects the

poorer health of such patients rather than indicating any
causal role for testosterone in cancer development
[40,41]. However, on sum the clinical evidence and our
theoretical results suggest that low serum testosterone
induces selection for AR overexpression, which in turn
may predispose cancer to treatment-resistance.
Following the results of the PCPT, which showed an overall reduction in cancer incidence for those taking finasteride but an increase in high-grade tumors [50], great
controversy has surrounded the possible role of the drug
in cancer etiology [52]. It is not clear why inhibiting DHT
would be protective against cancer if it is true that low
serum T can promote cancer. It seems unlikely that inhibiting DHT within the prostate would have a qualitatively
different effect on androgen-mediated cell activities than
lowering serum T, and one recent study found that low
intraprostatic DHT increased cancer aggressiveness [96].
In our model, the effect of 5-α reductase inhibition on
selection for AR overexpression is similar to the effect of
low serum T. That is, AR overexpression is selected for
more strongly, but the expected time to such overexpression being observed is greater than in a normal androgen
environment. Therefore, we expect 5-α reductase inhibition to similarly increase risk for therapy-resistant and/or
aggressive prostate cancer. Indeed, as early as 1993, Martel et al. [79] expressed concern that the use of 5α-reduc-

tase inhibitors in the treatment of BPH could induce
selection for therapy resistant cancer cells.
Perhaps low serum T consistently predicts both increased
cancer incidence and aggressiveness because in men with
lifelong low testosterone the temporal window where a
normal or high androgen environment results in greater
AR expression (see Figures 11 and 12) is usually passed by
the time cancer is diagnosed in the latter decades of life.
Finasteride treatment may shift patients to the pattern of
AR evolution we have observed in low androgen environments, where the prostate-wide average Rt remains low
for a long time, but increases dramatically late in time.
Therefore, in a relatively short temporal window overall
cancer incidence may be reduced, but a minority of
patients will cross the threshold for increased AR expression and experience a high-grade tumor. In light of the
clinical data on low testosterone and cancer risk, and our
own results suggesting that the temporal scale for the
incidence of aggressive cancer under 5α-reductase inhibition is not the same as that for overall cancer incidence
under normal androgen environments, long-term followup of patients being treated with finasteride is warranted,
and the response to hormonal therapy among patients
who do experience prostate cancer should be studied.
In conclusion, our theoretical study suggests that AR
expression in the prostate increases uniformly with age.
However, low intraprostatic androgen, whether induced
by low serum T or 5α-reductase inhibition, can increase
selection for AR overexpression, and hence increased
cancer aggressiveness and treatment resistance. This
overexpression may not manifest itself until relatively late
in life, so while those with low intraprostatic androgen
may be at an increased lifetime risk for aggressive cancer,
they may experience decreased overall cancer incidence.
This may help to explain the decreased overall cancer
incidence, but increased risk of high-grade cancer, that
has been seen in men taking finasteride [50,54].

Reviewers' Comments
Reviewer's report 1

Dr. Ariosto S. Silva (nominated by Dr. Marek Kimmel)
1. The idea proposed in this article that there are "sweet
spots" in the concentrations of hormones and in stages of
development of the tumor that guide tumorigenesis and
lead to therapy resistance is an important concept
towards personalize cancer treatment. It reminds me of
the analogy of the pepper shaker and the steak: a little
pepper makes the steak taste better but a lot of pepper
makes the steak a lot worse.
I would suggest rewriting this sentence for sake of clarity
"Most cancers are more aggressive following HR recurrence, there are no effective treatments for such cancers,
and average survival following progression does not
exceed 15 months [24]." I understood that most cancers

Page 24 of 28

that recur and are hormone refractory are more aggressive than before treatment and that they do not respond
to treatment, is this it?
Authors' response: Yes, that is exactly what was meant by
this sentence. (We would assume that, by definition, any
cancer that recurs in the face of androgen ablation therapy
should be considered "hormone refractory.")
2. Please review these two sentences; they seem to mean
the same thing: "AR amplification occurs in perhaps 30%
of recurring HR tumors [22]. However, such genetic alterations do not occur in most HR cancers."
Authors' response: Here we are pointing out that while AR
gene amplification does occur and is not an insignificant
contributor to HR tumor recurrence, such a genetic alteration does not occur in the majority of HR tumors. You are
correct that the second sentence is somewhat redundant,
but we have left it in to emphasize that this is not the dominant pathway by which HR recurrence occurs (although
we did replace the wording "most HR cancers" by "the
majority of HR cancers").
3. Please clarify how this paragraph relate to previous
observation, it seems contradictory that the upregulation
of AR expression is HR tumors but is also the most
important pathway: "Upregulation of the AR protein is
perhaps the single most important pathway by which
cancers achieve androgen independence. Chen et al. [30]
found that in 7 prostate cancer xenograft models,
increased androgen receptor expression was the only
change consistently associated with HR cancer progression."
Authors' response: In the previous paragraph, we are
pointing out that amplification of the AR gene occurs in a
minority of HR tumors. Increased levels of the AR protein
itself, whether achieved through gene amplification or by
other pathways, seems to be the most important (or at
least most common) pathway to HR tumor recurrence in
the majority of tumors.
4. Could you please give more details on this trial? The
subjects had any signal of prostate tumor or the idea is
that every man would submit to this treatment after a
certain age? "In the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial
(PCPT), finasteride use reduced overall prostate cancer
incidence, but increased the risk of high-grade cancer
over 7 years [50]."
Authors' response: The PCPT was a double-blind RCT
that assigned men with no history of prostate cancer to
receive finasteride (5 mg) or a placebo daily for 7 years.
Biopsy was performed on the basis of serum PSA or abnormal digital rectal exam. At the end of the 7-year study
period, all men who consented received a biopsy. Finasteride use reduced overall prostate cancer incidence by
24%, but increased the risk of high-grade cancer: 37% of
cancers were high-grade in the treatment group versus

Eikenberry et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:24
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/24

22% in the placebo group. These details are now included
in the text.
5. Could you please explain the relationship between a
smaller prostate and the probability that a biopsy would
detect cancer? We could imagine that smaller prostates
would pass the rectal touch exam and thus not be biopsied? "Finastide significantly reduced the prostate size in
those treated, and reduced prostate size can increase the
probability of cancer detection in biopsy samples, so a
detection bias could explain the increased rate of highgrade cancer."
Authors' response: What is being discussed here is not the
relationship between the prostate size and the probability
of biopsy based on DRE findings (although you are certainly correct that a smaller prostate would decrease the
chance of a positive rectal exam and thus a for-cause
biopsy).
Rather, it has been argued that given a biopsy occurs, the
probability that tumor tissue is present in the biopsied tissue sample will depend on the absolute size of the prostate.
If more normal epithelium is present, as in the case of placebo-treated men, the probability that tumor tissue is
detected decreases. Since finasteride treatment reduces the
prostate volume, a tumor of equal size is more likely to be
detected in biopsy samples from a finasteride-treated man
than a placebo-treated man. This has been (hopefully)
clarified in the text.
6. Please elaborate on how hypoxia may induce increase
in ROS. One of the explanations for limited effect of radiation therapy in hypoxic areas of tumors in the low levels
of reactive oxygen species, supposedly due to the lack of
oxygen. "Hypoxia impairs aerobic respiration, and mitochondrial ROS is required for stabilization of HIF-1α
[97]. Thus, in addition to direct effects on redox related
enzymes, a low androgen environment also increases
ROS levels by inducing a hypoxic environment."
Authors' response: Radiation exerts its biological effects
primarily through the ionization of water:
H 2O → H 2O •+ + e −

These and other subsequently generated radical species
can react with O2 to form reactive oxygen species such as
the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. These species initiate further radical reactions that damage the
DNA. Therefore, the presence of molecular oxygen in
tumor tissue, but not necessarily the presence of pre-existing ROS, is an important determinant of the efficacy of
radiation therapy.
In a hypoxic environment the electron transport chain is
impaired and oxygen is less likely to be fully reduced,
resulting in partial oxygen reduction and ROS generation.
Such mitochondria generated ROS stabilizes HIF-1α and

Page 25 of 28

thus activates the cellular response to hypoxia. We have
modified this section slightly for clarity.
7. The sentence "that low intraprostatic AR:ligand concentrations, caused either by low serum testosterone or
5-α reductase inhibition, drive evolution towards elevated sensitivity to androgens in prostate epithelium,
therefore increasing the risk of cancer that is resistant to
hormonal therapy" might be better understood if the
words "elevated sensitivity" were replaced by "smaller
dependency."
Authors' response: We have replaced "elevated sensitivity
to" by "decreased dependence upon."
0.1 Reviewer's report 2

Dr. Marek Kimmel
In the transcription factor literature, there is a significant
number of papers concerning spatial organization of AR
activity within the nucleus, leading to effects such as
hyperspeckling (see the attached paper by van Royen et
al. 2007 from Houtsmuller's laboratory [98]). Are there
cancer-specific modifications of such organization which
might have anything to do with altered expression of ARdependent genes?
Authors' response: In this paper, van Royen et al. present a
model for AR/DNA/cofacter interaction that is modulated
by binding between the N terminal and C terminal
domains (N/C interactions) of the AR. Such binding
appears to prevent cofactor recruitment, and occurs upon
hormone ligand binding. Following ligand binding, the AR
translocates to the nucleus, where it is highly mobile.
Transient binding to the DNA terminates N/C interactions. This allows the C-terminal ligand binding domain
(LBD) to interact with cofactors containing the FxxLF
motif, leading to altered transcriptional activity.
It is likely that cancer-specific alterations of the AR that
affect the spatial kinetics of DNA binding and cofactor
recruitment play a role in prostate cancer progression and
its response to treatment. For example, changes in N/C
interaction might alter co-factor recruitment within the
nucleus, and altered co-factor activity may be associated
with HR recurrence. Farla et al. [99]showed that while
both AR agonists and antagonists cause translocation of
the AR:ligand complex to the nucleus, only agonists
caused DNA binding. Mutations in the AR can cause
antagonists to act as agonists, and these may act by altering N/C interaction and cofactor recruitment following
binding. Farla et al. established that DNA binding kinetics
for mutant ARs bound to anti-androgens were similar to
the DNA binding kinetics for wild-type ARs bound to agonists. Therefore, modification of DNA binding in the spatial compartment in response to non-canonical ligands is
likely one pathway by which prostate cancers become hormone refractory. van Royen et al. also found that speckling
overlaps with, but is not perfectly correlated with, tran-

Eikenberry et al. Biology Direct 2010, 5:24
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/24

scriptional activity. However, speckling does not occur
without DNA binding, so the dynamics of speckling are
likely a direct result of DNA binding kinetics and subsequent interactions with co-factors, etc.
In any case, we would argue that any alteration in the AR
that affects the transcriptional response to AR:ligand
binding must necessarily affect the spatial dynamics of AR
activity in the nucleus. At the phenomenological level, the
exact molecular mechanisms by which AR activity is
changed are not as important as how the androgen environment selects for altered AR activity in general.
