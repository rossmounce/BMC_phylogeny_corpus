Abstract
Introduction: Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by environmental fungi or bacteria. It affects
dermal and subcutaneous tissues, with putative contiguous extension to muscles or bones. While common in
tropical and subtropical areas, mycetoma is rare in Europe.
Case presentation: We describe a case of Actinomadura meyerae osteitis in a 49-year-old Caucasian woman who
suffered a tibia open fracture contaminated with hay; to the best of our knowledge the first case of autochthonous
A. meyerae infection reported in France. The bacterium was cultivated from a bone biopsy. Following surgical
osteosynthesis and six months of treatment with cotrimoxazole, our patient made a full recovery.
Conclusion: Our case report suggests that A. meyerae is a potential agent of wound infection in farm workers in
contact with hay.

Introduction
Infections caused by Actinomadura species, Grampositive bacilli that belong to the family Thermomonosporaceae within the order Actinomycetales, are common in
tropical and subtropical areas [1]. They are mostly caused
by Actinomadura madurae and Actinomadura pelletieri.
In Europe, only four cases of Actinomadura infections
have been reported to date, caused by Actinomadura sp.
[2,3], A. madurae [4] and Actinomadura sputi [5]. We
report the first case of Actinomadura meyerae infection in
a patient who developed osteitis following contamination
of an open fracture wound with hay.
Case presentation
A 49-year-old Caucasian woman working on a farm in
Vichy, France, experienced an open fracture of the left
tibia caused by a hook lifting a haystack. Subsequently,
she was admitted to hospital. The fracture was reduced
with a locking compression plate (Synthes, Oberdorf,
Switzerland). Then, five days later, our patient developed
a fever of 38.5°C, and oral treatment with amoxicillinclavulanic acid, 6 g/day, was started; eight days after

starting this treatment, the first antibiotic was replaced
with oral ciprofloxacin (1.0 g/day) for three months.
During that time, the cutaneous wound healed, but successive X-rays showed that bone healing was not
obtained. Seven months following surgery, our patient
broke her tibia locking compression plate while walking.
Then, four weeks later, she was admitted to hospital.
On examination, our patient had swelling and pain of
the leg at the fracture site without any evident clinical
sign of infection. X-rays showed a non-union of the
tibia at the fracture site and the broken locking compression plate. Her blood test results showed a leukocyte
count of 7.39 × 10 9 cells/L (73% polymorphonuclear
cells, 24.9% mononuclear cells), a C reactive protein
level of 1 mg/mL, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate
of 5 mm/first hour. The patient underwent removal of
the locking compression plate, immediately followed by
an intra-medullary nailing associated with a cancellous
autologous bone graft harvested on the homolateral iliac
crest. A peri-operative bone biopsy of the fracture
site was performed in sterile conditions and sent to
the microbiology laboratory of the Timone Hospital,
Marseille, France. Direct microscopic analysis showed
the presence of numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but no bacteria were detected using Gram stain.

The biopsy was cultivated in aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 37°C for one month. Plates were checked for
bacterial growth twice a week. On the 28th day of culture, white colonies that were convex, powdery and
adherent were detected on blood-enriched Columbia
agar (Figure 1A). The strain was named Timone,
according to the name of our hospital. Gram staining
demonstrated that the colonies were made of irregular
and extensively branched Gram-positive bacilli less than
1 μm in diameter (Figure 1B). The bacterium could not
be stained using the Ziehl-Neelsen method. Its identification was obtained using 16S rRNA amplification and
sequencing. Briefly, DNA was extracted from a colony
using the QIAamp Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 1441 bp section
was performed using the fD1 and rp2 primers as
previously described [6]. Following comparison to
sequences in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genbank/; sequence deposited under accession number GenBank:HQ291073), the nucleotide
sequence obtained from the PCR product was 100%
identical to unpublished sequences recorded under
accession numbers GenBank:EU741181, GenBank:
EU741222, and GenBank:EF212022. The first two
sequences were obtained from Actinomadura sp. from
seawater from Costa Rica, and the latter from an Actinomadura sp. detected in shallow water sediments from
Norway. By comparison with those of all officially validated Actinomadura species http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/
index.html, our sequence exhibited a similarity ranging
from 95.63% with Actinomadura libanotica (GenBank:
AF163120) to 99.37% with A. meyerae (GenBank:

AY273787). Using the MEGA software [7], we performed a phylogenetic analysis among Actinomadura
species and found our patient’s strain to be grouped
with A. meyerae (Figure 2). The strain was deposited in
the Collection de souches de l’Unité des Rickettsies
(CSUR, WDCM875) under reference CSUR P15. The
antimicrobial susceptibility of strain Timone was
assessed using E-test strips (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller-Hinton agar. The strain was susceptible
to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration
0.5 μg/mL), doxycycline (0.25 μg/mL), cotrimoxazole
(1 μg/mL) and vancomycin (2 μg/mL), and resistant to
amoxicillin (8 μg/mL), imipenem (4 μg/mL), erythromycin (16 μg/mL) and rifampin (2 μg/mL). Subsequently,
an oral treatment with cotrimoxazole (sulfamethoxazole,
4800 mg/day and trimethoprim, 960 mg/day) was
started and continued for six months. Within 15 days of
the onset of antibiotics, our patient’s operative wound
healed and local inflammatory symptoms resolved.
A year later, our patient remains asymptomatic.

Discussion
Actinomadura species are usually found in surface layers
of the soil in semi-desertified areas of tropical and subtropical countries. Most human Actinomadura infections
are caused by A. madurae and A. pelletieri. Both species
are agents of mycetoma, a chronic and destructive cutaneous infection that may spread to the bones. Cases of
Actinomadura infections have mostly been reported in
India, the Middle East, Africa, and South America [1].
In Europe, Actinomadura infections have almost
exclusively been diagnosed in immigrants from purported endemic areas [8], but rare endemic cases have

also been reported. In Albania, a 45-year-old man with
no history of travel to tropical or subtropical areas was
diagnosed as having Actinomadura sp. infection of the
foot [2]. In Greece, a 38-year-old man who reported no
history of travel abroad presented with a chronic osteitis
of the left foot caused by A. madurae [4]. A third autochthonous European case of Actinomadura sp. infection
was described in Italy [3]. Recently A. sputi was isolated
from the sputum of a German patient [5].
Our report is the fifth reported case of autochthonous
Actinomadura infection in Europe, and the first in
France. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is
the first case of A. meyerae infection. As we isolated it
in pure culture from a bone biopsy, we are confident
that it was the causative agent of our patient’s bone
infection. A. meyerae was first described as Actinomadura meyerii in 2003 [9]. The type strain was isolated
from a garden soil in Mexico City [9]. Our patient had
not travelled to the usual endemic zones of mycetoma,
but had a specific history of wound contamination with
hay. This is the likely source of infection, as Actinomadura infection in mycetoma results from the introduction of this agent by minor percutaneous trauma, often
associated with plant debris and/or soil. Using cotrimoxazole for six months due to the presence of internal
fixation material, the infection improved rapidly, bone
healing was obtained and our patient’s infection was
considered as cured one year later.
