Abstract
Background: The cystatin superfamily comprises cysteine protease inhibitors that play key
regulatory roles in protein degradation processes. Although they have been the subject of many
studies, little is known about their genesis, evolution and functional diversification. Our aim has
been to obtain a comprehensive insight into their origin, distribution, diversity, evolution and
classification in Eukaryota, Bacteria and Archaea.
Results: We have identified in silico the full complement of the cystatin superfamily in more than
2100 prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. The analysis of numerous eukaryotic genomes has
provided strong evidence for the emergence of this superfamily in the ancestor of eukaryotes. The
progenitor of this superfamily was most probably intracellular and lacked a signal peptide and
disulfide bridges, much like the extant Giardia cystatin. A primordial gene duplication produced two
ancestral eukaryotic lineages, cystatins and stefins. While stefins remain encoded by a single or a
small number of genes throughout the eukaryotes, the cystatins have undergone a more complex
and dynamic evolution through numerous gene and domain duplications. In the cystatin superfamily
we discovered twenty vertebrate-specific and three angiosperm-specific orthologous families,
indicating that functional diversification has occurred only in multicellular eukaryotes. In vertebrate
orthologous families, the prevailing trends were loss of the ancestral inhibitory activity and
acquisition of novel functions in innate immunity. Bacterial cystatins and stefins may be emergency
inhibitors that enable survival of bacteria in the host, defending them from the host's proteolytic
activity.
Conclusion: This study challenges the current view on the classification, origin and evolution of
the cystatin superfamily and provides valuable insights into their functional diversification. The
findings of this comprehensive study provide guides for future structural and evolutionary studies
of the cystatin superfamily as well as of other protease inhibitors and proteases.

Background
The cystatin superfamily consists of a large group of cystatin domain-containing proteins, most of which are reversible and tight-binding inhibitors of the papain (C1) and

legumain (C13) families of cysteine proteases [1-4]. On
the basis of sequence similarity, the presence or lack of
disulfide bonds, and physiological localization, this
superfamily has been divided in both mammals and birds

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:266

into family 1 or stefins, family 2 or cystatins and family 3
or kininogens [5]. Subsequently, cystatins were divided
into types 1, 2 and 3, based mainly on the number of
cystatin domains [6]. Recently, another system of classifying peptidase (protease) inhibitors was introduced, based
on similarities in protein sequences and three-dimensional (3D) structures. In this system, the cystatins are
placed in family I25 that contains three subfamilies: I25A,
B and C [7].
Cysteine protease inhibitors are widely distributed in
metazoans and angiosperms. They can function to protect
cells from unwanted proteolysis and to control intra- and
extracellular protein degradation [8-10]. The role of these
inhibitors in maintaining controlled proteolysis in
humans is critical. Any deviation from controlled protein
degradation may result in pathological processes including cancer, neurodegeneration, bone resorption and cardiovascular diseases [reviewed in [10-13]].
Studies of the plant protease papain and human cysteine
cathepsins were crucial for the discovery of the cystatins.
The isolation and characterization of the chicken eggwhite protein inhibitor of the plant cysteine proteases
ficin and papain [14], of the intracellular protein inhibitor
of papain, cathepsins B and H from pig leucocytes and
spleen [15] and from human epidermis [16] stimulated
further studies of cysteine protease inhibitors. Soon after
the discovery of these proteins, the name cystatin was
introduced for chicken cysteine protease inhibitor, indicating its function [17]. Determination of the amino acid
sequences of chicken cystatin [18] and human stefin A
[19], the discovery that »γ-trace« protein [20] is a human
cystatin C [18,21,22], and the discovery that the kininogens are inhibitors of cysteine proteases [23,24] were all
crucial to the mapping of the cystatin superfamily. The
vertebrate cystatins and stefins have been the focus of
extensive research as regulators of proteolysis. As a result,
a large body of information has been accumulated on the
cystatin superfamily over the last two decades [3,4,25].
Although stefins and cystatins differ considerably in their
amino acid sequences, their tertiary structures are conserved and exhibit the cystatin fold that is formed by a five
stranded anti-parallel β-sheet wrapped around a five-turn
α-helix [26,27]. The structure of the plant inhibitor oryzacystatin, determined by NMR spectroscopy, shows the
same cystatin fold as the animal cystatins [28]. Mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy studies
have identified three conserved regions in the cystatins
and stefins that are important for their inhibition of
papain-like cysteine proteases. These three regions include
the N-terminal segment, the highly conserved region

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/266

(QXVXG) that folds into a β-hairpin loop, and a second
hairpin loop containing a similarly conserved segment
(PW), all of which participate in the formation of a
»wedge« that is complementary to the active site cleft of
papain [26,27,29].
The evolutionary analyses of the cystatin superfamily took
place in the pre-genomic era, from the mid 80 s [1,6,30]
to the late 90 s [31]. Thus they were based on a small sample of taxonomic diversity and diversity within the cystatin superfamily. Since then, the number of representatives
has increased significantly, largely due to the accumulation of mammalian [3,32,33] and plant [34] genomic
sequences. Numerous proteins containing cystatin
domains have been discovered that cannot be easily incorporated into the existing classification scheme, resulting
in a growing problem of classifying the cystatin superfamily [32,33]. A large amount of protein sequence data
for this superfamily therefore awaits comprehensive evolutionary classification.
Here we aim to obtain a comprehensive insight into the
origin, distribution, diversity, evolution and classification
of the cystatin superfamily in Eukaryota, Bacteria and
Archaea. Such an analysis could not have been performed
previously due to the small number of available completed eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. We traced the
genesis and expansion of the cystatin superfamily through
comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses, using
publicly available whole-genome information from more
than 2100 prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, as well as
from the numerous transcriptomic and proteomic databases. The results of this work underpin targeted functional and structural studies of the members of the
cystatin superfamily.

Methods
Data mining
All database searches were performed online and were
completed in May 2009. The databases analysed were the
nonredundant (NR), EST, GSS, HTGS, WGS, as well as the
microbial and eukaryotic genome databases at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. In addition, we searched
the Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org and the Joint
Genome Institute (JGI) http://www.jgi.doe.gov databases.
Taxon-specific genome databases were searched through
the ENSEMBL and JGI websites, while diverse taxon-specific transcriptomic databases were searched for all
eukaryotic lineages at NCBI. To detect all the available
representatives of cystatin superfamily, database searches
were performed iteratively. Comparisons were performed
using the TBLASTN program [35] with the E-value cutoff

set to 10-5 and default settings for other parameters.
Diverse stefins, cystatins and cystatin domains have been
used as queries. The Translate program http://
www.expasy.org/tools/dna.html was used to translate
DNA sequences. Attempts were made to identify novel
representatives of the cystatin superfamily in the genomic
and transcriptomic databases, as well as in diverse proteomic databases such as the specialized Merops database
of proteases and their protein inhibitors http://
merops.sanger.ac.uk and the general proteomic databases, such as Superfamily http://supfam.org, SMART
http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de, PFAM http://pfam.jane
lia.org, InterPro http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/, TreeFam
http://www.treefam.org and Phylofacts http://phyloge
nomics.berkeley.edu/phylofacts/. The accession numbers
of diverse eukaryotic representatives of the cystatin superfamily are available in additional files 1 and 2.
Phylogenetic analysis
All the nonredundant eukaryotic and bacterial representatives of the cystatin superfamily have been included in
the analyses. The cystatin domain in the newly discovered
representatives of the cystatin superfamily was identified
using the SMART, InterPro and Pfam domain databases.
The protein sequences were aligned using Clustal W2
[36]. All the available correction models were tested, but
the complex models were outperformed by the simple
correction models. We therefore used uncorrected p distances for deduced amino acid sequences to measure the
extent of sequence divergence. When analysing many
divergent sequences and when the number of positions
used is relatively small, the uncorrected distances are
more effective for obtaining reliable topology than more
complicated correction models, due to their smaller variance [37,38]. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using
the neighbor-joining (NJ) method [39] and the maximum
likelihood (ML) method [40]. The reliability of the resulting topologies was evaluated by 1000 bootstrap replications. Diverse bacterial and eukaryotic representatives of
the cystatin superfamily were used as outgroups. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the programs Treecon
[41], MEGA 4.0 [42] and RAxML [40].

Results and Discussion
A large number of new and diverse representatives of the
cystatin superfamily have been discovered in genomic,
transcriptomic and proteomic databases
Although the cystatin superfamily is relatively well-represented in the Merops database [43], the data are limited
mainly to mammals and plants. A much greater number
of members of the cystatin superfamily are present in the
general proteomic databases, such as Superfamily, PFAM,
SMART, InterPro and TreeFam. Even in these databases,
the majority of annotated proteins are either restricted to
vertebrates and invertebrates (e.g., in the TreeFam), or are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/266

highly biased to the Metazoa and plants, due to the limited taxon sampling of the completed genomes.
To overcome these problems, all the publicly available
genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic databases have
been searched for new members of the cystatin superfamily. In the numerous annotated genome databases,
some proteins have not yet been identified, some are not
correctly annotated, and some have been incorrectly
assembled. To find all the sequenced members of the
cystatin superfamily we therefore used a phylogenomic
analysis of publicly available eukaryotic and prokaryotic
genomes and transcriptomes. The major problem of the
EST transcriptomic database is the overrepresentation of
the mammalian, vertebrate, and angiosperm species. We
therefore limited searching of the EST database (using
TBLASTN) to the numerous specific taxonomic groups.
This approach was especially important in finding stefins
and cystatins in a large number of diverse unicellular
eukaryotes. We also used a PSI-BLAST search to find some
divergent representatives. However, the analysis of the
transcriptomic database provided the most divergent
novel eukaryotic representatives of stefins and cystatins.
The members are more conserved within the ancestral stefin lineage than in the ancestral cystatin lineage. The analysis of numerous bacterial and archaeal genomes has
shown a surprisingly limited distribution of stefins and
cystatins in only a few bacterial genomes.
Two ancestral lineages of the cystatin superfamily, stefins
and cystatins, exist in Eukaryota and Bacteria
An analysis of the phyletic distribution of the cystatin
superfamily has shown the presence of only two ancestral
lineages, stefins and cystatins, in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Table 1). Because both lineages most probably
duplicated prior to the divergence of the principal lineages
of eukaryotes, they are referred to as ancestral or ancient
eukaryotic paralogs.

We found that stefins remained as a single gene or as small
multigene families throughout the eukaryotes. In contrast
to stefins, cystatins underwent more complex and
dynamic evolution by numerous gene and domain duplications. Despite their similar gene and protein structures
[3,4], stefins remained evolutionarily stable. Stable genes
persist as a single copy over a wide range of distantly
related species, whereas unstable genes undergo frequent
duplication and loss in a process called birth-death evolution. In the cystatin superfamily stefins are present as a
single copy genes in diverse eukaryotic species, while
cystatin genes undergo active birth-death evolution across
the same species. A significant unique feature of cystatins
is their signal peptide, which is responsible for their extracellular targeting. The stefins lack the signal peptide and
are intracellular inhibitors [3]. The name stefin, which

was coined for the first cytoplasmic cysteine protease
inhibitor of cysteine proteases [44], is used to clearly distinguish the cytoplasmic cysteine protease inhibitors from
their secreted homologs with a single cystatin domain.
Here, we provide an additional rationale for separate
names by showing an early evolutionary divergence
between these two lineages. In the Merops database, the
stefins are limited mostly to mammals, a few vertebrates
and very few invertebrates. Until now, the oldest known
stefin was from the slime mold Dictyostelium [45]. In this
study we found numerous new stefins in diverse eukaryotic lineages that provided new insights into their origin,
distribution, diversity and evolution (Table 1).
In the early evolutionary studies of the cystatin superfamily there was much speculation concerning the nature
of their ancestor [6]. It was proposed that the archetypal
cystatin had no disulfide bridges and that, approximately
1 billion years ago (Bya), a precursor containing disulfide
bridges appeared from which all subsequent disulfide

bridge-containing cystatins evolved [6]. However, because
cystatins and stefins are present in the majority of the
eukaryotic supergroups and in some prokaryotes (Table
1), this widely accepted scheme of the evolution of the
cystatin superfamily [6] needs to be revised.
The classification and evolution of the cystatin superfamily was inferred [6,30,31,46] in the pre-genomic era,
based on comparison of a small sample of mostly mammalian sequences. Moreover, sequence divergence alone
is often inadequate for inferring the origin and diversification of a protein superfamily. Even in the case of vertebrate and mammalian members of the cystatin
superfamily, the level of sequence divergence between
diverse families (e.g., cystatin vs stefin, CRES vs cystatin,
cystatin vs kininogen and cystatin vs fetuin) is high. Therefore, by using only mammalian members, we can neither
adequately classify the cystatin superfamily nor map the
origin of its numerous orthologous families.

The previously proposed evolutionary scheme assumed a
near simultaneous origin and diversification of stefins,
cystatins, kininogens and fetuins, occurring approximately 1 Bya [6]. However, only two ancestral lineages,
stefins and cystatins, are present throughout the eukaryotes (Table 1), indicating that the above assumption is
incorrect. The kininogens and fetuins are, in fact, much
younger and restricted to the vertebrates (Figure 1; Table
2), and therefore originated, not 1 Bya, but at most 650
million years ago (Mya) (kininogens), 525 Mya (fetuin A)
and 475 Mya (fetuin B) (divergence time estimates are
from [47]). The early origin of multidomain cystatins,
about 1 Bya, and their stepwise evolution were also proposed [6]. We demonstrated that the multidomain cystatins are not monophyletic, but originated independently
by domain duplication, several times in diverse eukaryotic
lineages (Table 1). The early models of the evolution of

the multidomain cystatins [1,30] did not consider
domain duplication as a major mechanism for their origin.
In the earlier pre-genomic studies, the position of the
plant cystatins was assumed to be unique, and they were
regarded as structural intermediates between stefins and
cystatins [6]. However, as our analysis shows, this
assumption can no longer be maintained, because they
represent only the cystatins present in the plant kingdom
(Table 1).
Another long-standing assumption has been that the
disulfide bridges have been conserved in cystatins since
their first appearance [6]. While this conservation is
apparent in mammals and vertebrates, it is less certain in
the case of basal metazoans and plant cystatins. In the

unicellular eukaryotes, the situation is quite complicated
and no pattern of conservation can be recognized (additional file 3).
In summary, our analysis has revealed evidence against
some of the generalizations and assumptions made in the
pre-genomic era: (i) on the nature of the ancestor of the
cystatin superfamily, (ii) on the classification and evolution of the cystatin superfamily, (iii) on the origin of and
diversification of stefins, cystatins, kininogens and fetuins, (iv) on the unique position of plant cystatins and (v)
on the conservation of the disulfide bridges in the cystatins.
Distribution of the cystatin superfamily in the three
domains of life
The phyletic distribution patterns of cystatins and stefins
have been analyzed in Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota.
Members of the cystatin superfamily have been found
only in Eukaryota and in Bacteria; no members being
present in Archaea (Table 1). Phylogenomic analysis indicates a relatively widespread distribution of the cystatin
superfamily in eukaryotes. However, the distributions of
two ancestral eukaryotic paralogous lineages (classes) in
eukaryotes differ, particularly in their phyletic distribution (Table 1). Even in Bacteria, the phyletic distributions
of cystatins and stefins are completely different, because
cystatins are limited mainly to the Vibrios, while stefins
show a wider, although still patchy distribution.

No cystatins or stefins have previously been reported from
the genomes of the unicellular eukaryotes. However, by
analysis of the rich transcriptomic data and the more limited genomic data for numerous unicellular eukaryotic
lineages, large numbers of highly divergent cystatins and

stefins were revealed (Table 1). These particular findings
are crucial, since they provide a major insight into the origin and evolution of the cystatin superfamily, resulting in
a new classification of the cystatin superfamily members.
Stefins are present in most major eukaryotic supergroups.
In unikonts, they are present in Holozoa (Choanozoa and
Metazoa) and Amoebozoa, but not in Fungi. They are
absent from plant genomes but are present in diverse representatives of the SAR supergroup [48] - in alveolates,
heterokonts, Rhizaria, Haptophyta and cryptomonads.
Stefins are present in diverse representatives of Excavata,
such as Euglenozoa, Heterolobosea, Jakobidae and
Malawimonas, but not in the oxymonads, Trimastix, parabasalians or in diplomonads (Table 1).
Cystatins are more widely distributed in eukaryotic supergroups than stefins, being present in unikonts (in Holozoa only, but not in Fungi and Amoebozoa), in Plantae
and in the SAR supergroup; however the phyletic distribution pattern is not the same as that for stefins. Cystatins
are present in the diverse Excavata lineages, such as Heterolobosea, Jakobidae, Malawimonas, oxymonads, parabasalians and diplomonads (Table 1), where they are more
abundant than stefins.
The phyletic distribution of the eukaryotic multidomain
cystatins is limited. They are present in some of the Excavata lineages, such as parabasalians, oxymonads and heteroloboseans. In the SAR supergroup the multidomain
cystatins are rare, being found in a few ciliates only. In the
plant kingdom they are present in eudicots only. In
unikonts, they were found in metazoans only, in both
Protostomia (Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa) and Deuterostomia (cephalochordates and vertebrates only)

(Table 1). Phylogenomic analysis provides strong evidence that multidomain-cystatins are not monophyletic,
but that they originated independently several times during the evolution of eukaryotes (Table 1).
Bifunctional cystatins simultaneously inhibit the C1 and
C13 families of cysteine proteases [2]. Two separate lineages of bifunctional cystatins exist, one in metazoans,
such as the vertebrate cystatins C, E/M and F [2] and a
nematode cystatin [49], and the other in a few
angiosperms [50]. Our analysis provides evidence that
both lineages are more widespread in a number of older
plant and metazoan lineages. Plant bifunctional cystatins
occur in all land plant lineages and in a few green algae
(additional file 4), while the metazoan bifunctional
cystatins are widespread in eumetazoans (consisting of
Cnidaria and Bilateria). Metazoan-type bifunctional
cystatins were also found in a choanozoan Monosiga ovata,
indicating their presence at least in Holozoa. Surprisingly,
metazoan-type bifunctional cystatins are present in the
oomycete Phytophthora infestans, where they are responsible for the inhibition of plant cysteine proteases [51].
We have analyzed in detail the distribution of cystatins in
the plant kingdom (Archaeplastida) (additional file 4).
They have previously been found only in a few
angiosperm genomes [34]. We provide evidence that
cystatins are present in the oldest lineage of the plant kingdom, in glaucophytes (additional file 4). In the genomes
and
transcriptomes
of
diverse
green
algae
(Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Scenedesmus, Helicosporidium and Prototheca), we found highly divergent cystatins.
Analysis of the rich collection of genome and EST data for
diverse lineages of land plants demonstrated that cystatins
are widespread in all major lineages, such as liverworts,
mosses, lycophytes, ferns and all gymnosperm lineages, as
well as in all angiosperm lineages (additional file 4). No
cystatins can be found in the currently available genome
and EST data from red algae.
The greatest diversity of stefins and cystatins is present in
Metazoa. We found them in all major metazoan taxonomic groups, such as Porifera, Cnidaria, Ctenophora and
in Bilateria (both in protostomes and deuterostomes)
(additional file 5). No representatives of the cystatin
superfamily can be found in the most compact metazoan
genome, the Trichoplax adherens (Placozoa). Genomic
analysis shows that sponges, cnidarians, protostomes and
basal deuterostome lineages (xenoturbellids, echinoderms and urochordates) possess only cystatins and stefins (additional file 5). Multidomain cystatins are present
in diverse protostome lineages such as ecdysozoans (in
some arthropods) and lophotrochozoans, but in basal
deuterostomes they are present only in cephalochordates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/266

(additional file 5). Phylogenomic analysis of the metazoan genomic and transcriptomic databases provides
direct evidence that the major diversification inside the
cystatin lineage has occurred several times during the evolution of the vertebrates and in the ancestor of placental
mammals (Table 2).
Evolutionary classification of the cystatin superfamily
The sequence data available in genomic, proteomic and
transcriptomic databases can resolve the long-standing
question of the classification and evolution of the cystatin
superfamily. In the last decade, a number of novel mammalian cystatin representatives have been found and characterized, both biochemically and structurally [reviewed
in [3,4,32] and [33]].

We performed numerous phylogenetic analyses, based on
our large collection of cystatin superfamily representatives. They were analysed at the global level and at the
level of particular taxonomic groups where great diversification has occurred (in angiosperms, vertebrates and
mammals only), as well as at the level of particular orthologous families (mostly vertebrate-specific orthologous
families: kininogens, fetuins A and B, HRG (Figure 1),
latexins and TIG1 (Figure 2), cathelicidins (Figure 3),
Spp24 (Figure 4), cystatins C, E/M and F (Figure 5), CRES
subgroup (6 orthologous families) (Figure 6) and stefins
A and B (Figure 7)). The NJ method with uncorrected distances was found to produce better resolution of evolutionary relationships in the cystatin superfamily than the
more complex ML method. The reconstruction of evolutionary relationships in the cystatin superfamily from
hundreds of protein sequences is difficult, because only a
few sequence motifs are conserved. In the majority of previous studies of the cystatin superfamily, the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships was poor and attempts
to classify them into monophyletic groups failed.
The protein sequences of cystatins and stefins are problematic for phylogenetic analysis, because they are quite
short, highly divergent and produce low bootstrap values
in the phylogenetic trees. We found that the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships in the cystatin superfamily is simple on the short evolutionary timescale (e.g.,
in mammals or in land plants), but it becomes difficult on
the large evolutionary timescale. In the reconstruction of
the evolutionary history and in classification in the cystatin superfamily, it is helpful that unicellular eukaryotes
contain only two ancestral lineages, the stefins and cystatins (Table 1). The evolutionary relationships in the cystatin superfamily can easily be reconstructed for any
particular taxonomic group (e.g., for angiosperms, mammals, vertebrates or bacteria), but is difficult for the unicellular eukaryotes (data not shown).

Phylogenomic analysis provided a rich collection of
diverse representatives of the cystatin superfamily at different taxonomic levels (Tables 1 and 2; Figures 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7 and 8; additional file 3). The analysis of numerous
eukaryotic genomes has provided strong evidence for two
ancient eukaryotic paralogous lineages, stefin and cystatin
classes (Table 1). Inside the stefin lineage (class), there has
been little functional diversification. A number of highly
divergent orthologous families can be recognized only in
the cystatin class, in a few multicellular eukaryotic lineages. Numerous orthologous families occur in vertebrates
and mammals (20 families) and a few in angiosperms (3
families only) (Table 3; Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8;
additional file 6). In all other taxonomic groups, only stefins and cystatins (including multidomain cystatins) can
be found (Table 1). Due to the limited taxonomic sampling and their highly divergent sequences, the recognition of orthologous families in unicellular eukaryotes (if
they exist) is currently not possible.
We uncovered a problem in automated protein subfamily
identification and classification, for example in PhyloFacts (phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/phylofacts/), by
which no less than 42 subfamilies were documented

inside the cystatin superfamily. The major problem of the
automated protein subfamily identification and classification approach originates from limited taxon sampling
(restricted to the metazoans and angiosperms only) and
resulted in assigning the status of a subfamily to every single divergent sequence.
Phylogenomic analysis of the cystatin superfamily
Origin of the cystatin superfamily
Phylogenomic analysis of the cystatin superfamily in all
three domains of life has provided strong evidence for
their origin prior to the divergence of the principal eukaryotic lineages. The ancestor of this superfamily was most
probably intracellular, lacking a signal peptide and
disulfide bridges, similar to the extant Giardia cystatin
(additional file 7). The result of the primordial gene
duplication in the ancestor of eukaryotes was the emergence of the two ancestral eukaryotic lineages, cystatins
and stefins. The analysis of all eukaryotic orthologous
families provides strong evidence about their origins (i.e.,
where and when they originated and from which progenitor). Only a few cases of bursts in functional diversification have occurred, in some of the multicellular
eukaryotes, one in land plants (angiosperms), the second

during evolution of the vertebrates, and a third in the
ancestor of placental mammals.
In the case of land plants, the origin of the ancestral cystatin lineage A can be traced, at least in the ancestor of land
plants (Figure 8). This orthologous family is widespread
in land plants, present in liverworts, mosses, lycophytes,
ferns, gymnosperms and in angiosperms. Green algal and
glaucophyte representatives cannot provide phylogenetic
evidence for their inclusion into the ancestral lineage A.
The problem is that algal and glaucophyte representatives
are highly divergent, therefore their position is at the base
of the tree. Yet, in the most ancestral plant lineages (glaucophytes and green algae), only a single or a few cystatin

genes can be found, indicating that the ancestral land
plant specific phytocystatin lineage A is a direct descendant of these much older algal cystatins. The age of this
phytocystatin lineage is therefore between 450 My and 1.5
By (if this lineage originated in the LCA of the plant kingdom). We found that most representatives in the ancestral
cystatin lineage A, from land plants and a few green algae,
possess the highly conserved legumain binding motif
(SNSL) in the C-terminal part of the molecule [50] (additional file 8). This finding strongly connects the green
algal and land plant cystatins, and provides direct evidence that the ancestral plant cystatin lineage A originated
about 1-1.5 Bya, at least in the LCA of the green plants
(Viridiplantae), but probably even earlier in the LCA of

the Archaeplastida (consisting of the land plants, green
and red algae and the glaucophytes). The two much
younger phytocystatin lineages (B and C) emerged in the
LCA of angiosperms about 170 - 200 Mya (Figure 8).
These novel lineages B and C are highly divergent, therefore they most probably evolved new biological functions.
In contrast to the younger phytocystatin lineages B and C,
we observed a rich evolutionary record of functional
diversification in the ancestral land plant specific cystatin
lineage A. Functional diversification in lineage A originated recently (~100 Mya or younger) and is limited to
angiosperms (to some monocots and eudicots): in the
eudicot-specific multicystatin subfamily, in the monocotspecific subfamily (OC-3) and in the bifunctional cystatins (OC-12) (Figure 8).
In contrast to the relatively low level of functional diversification of cystatins in plants, diversification was much
greater during the evolution of vertebrates and in the
ancestor of placental mammals (Table 2). Analysis of the

cystatin superfamily in metazoans (additional file 5) has
demonstrated that the basal deuterostomes (origin about
900 Mya) possessed only single copies of the cystatin and
stefin genes. The ancestor of chordates also possessed single stefin and cystatin genes, but in cephalochordates the
multidomain cystatins originated independently (additional file 5). The first diversification of cystatins occurred
in the ancestor of vertebrates when the first four orthologous families emerged: cystatin F, cathelicidin, the progenitor of kininogen, and the progenitors of cystatins C
and E/M. Their age is about 650 My. These first vertebrate
orthologous families originated from the ancestral chordate cystatin and have remained stable in all vertebrates
(Table 2; Figures 1, 3 and 5). Only a few novel orthologous families emerged in the ancestor of jawed vertebrates
(Gnathostomata): fetuin A, spp24, cystatin E/M and
latexin (Table 2; Figures 1, 2, 4 and 5). In the ancestor of
bony vertebrates (Euteleostomi), two novel orthologous
families originated: fetuin B and cystatin C (Table 2; Figures 1 and 5). In the ancestor of land vertebrates (Tetrap-

oda), two novel orthologous families appeared: TIG1 and
HRG (Table 2; Figures 1 and 2). Six orthologous families
originated in the ancestor of placental mammals (Eutheria), (Table 2; Figure 6) and constitute the CRES subgroup
of cystatins [32]. These orthologous families are cystatins
8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 1L (Table 2; Figure 6). Duplication of
the stefin gene in the ancestor of the Amniota produced

two orthologous families, stefins A and B (Table 2; Figure
7). They differ in their expression profiles and tissue specificities [3]. A few smaller and evolutionarily younger
orthologous families and subfamilies have emerged in
some mammalian orders, such as the Muridae-specific
CRP1 [52], and a primate-specific subfamily of salivary
cystatins (cystatins S, SA, SN and D) [53].

Evolutionary relationships between the six Eutheria-specific orthologous families of the CRES subgroup of cystatins
Evolutionary relationships between the six Eutheria-specific orthologous families of the CRES subgroup of
cystatins. The rooted neighbor-joining tree shows the evolutionary relationships between the Eutheria-specific cystatin 12,
cystatin 9, cystatin 11, cystatin 13, cystatin 8 and cystatin 1L orthologous families. NJ tree represents the bootstrap consensus
following 1000 replicates, nodes with confidence values greater than 50% are indicated. Sequences were obtained from the
GenBank and ENSEMBL, genus names and accession numbers are included.

The number of orthologous families inside the cystatin
superfamily differs between the diverse vertebrate classes
(Table 2). In cyclostomes, besides the stefin, only four
cystatin-derived orthologous families are present, while
the genomes of the jawed vertebrates possess from 7 to 17
(18 in rodents only) orthologous cystatin-derived families
and stefin (Table 2). In cartilaginous fishes, there are
seven orthologous cystatin-derived families and stefin
and, in teleost fishes, eight (loss of cystatin E/M) orthologous cystatin-derived families and stefin (Table 2). In
amphibians, we found ten cystatin-derived orthologous
families (loss of cystatin E/M) and stefin (Table 2). It is

interesting that all land vertebrates (Tetrapoda), from
amphibians to the mammals, possess a similar number of
orthologous families, which is approximately eleven
(Table 2). Birds also lost the cystatin E/M gene, while the
most ancestral extant mammals (Prototheria, represented

(Table 2). The greatest number of cystatin-derived orthologous families inside the cystatin superfamily is present in
the genomes of placental mammals (Eutheria). They possess 17 orthologous cystatin-derived families, as well as
stefins A and B. These orthologous families remained conserved from the oldest representatives of placental mam-

mals (Atlantogenata, a mammal clade containing the
superorders Afrotheria and Xenarthra) to the primates
(Table 2). Within the mammals, a large difference
between placental (Eutheria) and ancestral (Prototheria
and Metatheria) mammals is clearly evident, because the
latter possess only 11 orthologous cystatin-derived families in addition to stefins A and B (Table 2).
The emergence of the vertebrate cystatin-derived orthologous families (Table 2; Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) is
most probably connected to the origin of the adaptive
immune system, the bone skeleton and the expansion of
the innate immune system. The origins of cystatin-derived
orthologous families in placental mammals (Figure 6)
and the evolutionarily younger mammalian cystatin lineages are connected to the expansion of the innate immune
system and are involved in host defence in specialized tissues, such as the CRES subgroup of cystatins [32] in the
male gonads of placental mammals and the salivary
cystatins in the salivary glands of primates [53].
Functional diversification
Phylogenomic analysis of the cystatin superfamily (Tables
1, 2 and 3; Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8; additional files
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8), together with previous studies [3,32-

34], has demonstrated that functional diversification in
the cystatin lineage occurred only in a few multicellular
eukaryotic lineages (Table 3).
The neofunctionalization in the cystatin superfamily
occurred very early, as indicated by differences in the gene
structure and expression profiles of the two ancestral lineages. We found an important aspect of division of labour
in the cystatin superfamily. While stefins remained intracellular proteins, responsible for the regulation of endogenous protein turnover, the cystatins gained a signal
peptide and emerged as extracellular inhibitors, responsible for the regulation of the exogenous protein turnover.
Therefore one of the ancestral function of stefins may
have been the inhibition of endogenous, and of cystatins
the inhibition of exogenous, cysteine proteases. Eukaryotic cystatins are indeed defence- or attack-related proteins
involved in the host-pathogen/parasite/predator interactions. Since the vast majority of eukaryotes are unicellular
organisms, the origin of two ancestral cysteine protease
inhibitor lineages with specialized functions may be very
important for their hosts. For some pathogenic unicellular
eukaryotes, such as for oomycetes, the role of cystatins in
pathogen attack of the plant host has been demonstrated
[51]. It is also interesting that the intracellular stefins are

more conserved than the very divergent extracellular
cystatins, as reported for some other proteins [54].
In plants, most cystatins function as inhibitors of both
endogenous and exogenous cysteine proteases. It appears
that, in the case of several taxonomic groups, just as the
plants lost the stefin lineage, the cystatin lineage has
gained an additional function - the inhibition of endogenous (intracellular) cysteine proteases. We found that
among the unicellular eukaryotic lineages (Tables 1, 2 and
3; Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8; additional files 3, 4, 5,
6, 7 and 8), there are numerous examples of loss of one or
both ancestral lineages (additional file 6). We expect that,
in these organisms or in the whole taxonomic groups, the
remaining cystatin or stefin lineage has gained an additional function, the inhibition of endogenous or exogenous cysteine proteases. It is interesting that in the case of
several unicellular eukaryotic stefins (e.g. in Hyper-

amoeba, Capsaspora and Karlodinium) the newly gained
signal peptide can be found, which is absent from the vast
majority of metazoan and eukaryotic stefins (additional
file 9). By acquiring the signal peptide, as observed in
some unicellular eukaryotic stefins, they could gain a
novel host defence-related function. In the plants there
are two well known examples of the loss of ancestral function and gain of a novel function. One is monellin, an
intensely sweet protein [55], and the other SQAPI, a
Cucurbitales-specific cystatin being recruited as a protease
inhibitor of aspartic proteases [56].
In vertebrates, ancestral inhibitory function has been
retained in cystatins C, E/M and F, in kininogens and in
stefins. Some of them gained specialized tissue-specific
activity, such as cystatins E/M and F which inhibit some
cell type-, tissue- or pathogen-specific cysteine proteases
[3,32,33,53]. In the majority of vertebrate orthologous

families the prevalent trend was loss of the ancestral
inhibitory activity and acquisition of a novel function.
This has been well documented in the following vertebrate orthologous families: fetuins A and B [57], HRG
[58], cathelicidins [59,60], latexins and TIG1 [61], and
spp24 [62], as well as in the mammalian families - in
CRP1 [52] and in the six orthologous families of the CRES
subgroup [32]. While these orthologous families still possess the conserved cystatin domain, they have lost inhibitory activity due to mutations in structurally important
regions. Most of the above mentioned orthologous families are still involved in innate immunity [32,57-59,61].
HRG, latexin and cathelicidin gained antimicrobial activity [58-61] and HRG became also the inhibitor of angiogenesis [58]. Fetuins A and B, spp24 and latexin are
reported to be involved in bone regulation and calcification [57,61,62]. Change of the inhibitory class has also
occurred several times - at least some of the CRES cystatins
inhibit serine protease prohormone convertase 2 [63],
latexin inhibits zinc-dependent metallocarboxypeptidases
(carboxypeptidase A4) [61], HRG inhibits thrombospondin-1 [58] and fetuin A is a binding partner for calpain
domain III [57]. The number of newly gained functions in
the vertebrate orthologous families indicates that the
cystatin domain is a very diverse protein-protein interaction module that can readily interact with novel targets
[3,32,33,53].
Gene loss
We found that stefins and cystatins have been lost from
many eukaryotic genomes or from whole taxonomic

groups (additional file 6). Gene loss in the cystatin superfamily can be quite easily recognized, since we inferred a
eukaryotic ancestral state for this superfamily that is the
presence of cystatins and stefins in the same genome. We
also inferred the ancestral and derived states for all
eukaryotic supergroups (additional file 10). The demonstration of the ancestral state for the cystatin superfamily
is important for the recognition of several independent
cases of gene loss of stefins, cystatins or of both lineages
in diverse eukaryotic taxonomic groups (additional file
6). The evidence for all these gene losses is based on the
analysis of complete genomes and not on partial EST data.
Some taxonomic groups with very large genome data coverage (such as fungi, where ~100 genomes are finished)
have lost both stefins and cystatins. These large taxonomic
groups are Fungi, Kinetoplastida and Apicomplexa (additional file 6). In a number of eukaryotic pathogens, we
observed complete loss of cystatin superfamily representatives (additional file 6); some of them use horizontally
acquired bacterial chagasins for self-defence, attack or the
regulation of proteolysis [64]. This surprising loss of
cystatins and stefins from some eukaryotic pathogens
indicates that they are not essential for them.
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
During the analysis of the cystatin superfamily we found
no evidence of HGT for cystatins and stefins among the
eukaryotic hosts. However, a rare case of horizontal transfer of cystatin gene was found from an insect host (ichneumonid wasp) to the symbiotic virus (Bracovirus,
Polydnaviruses) of hymenopteran insects [65]. Strong eviPage 15 of 22

dence for HGT of stefins and cystatins was found in bacteria, and is described below.

Phylum/class

The cystatin superfamily in prokaryotes
Extremely limited distribution of cystatin superfamily in prokaryotes
In this study we demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of cystatin superfamily representatives in bacterial
genomes. Despite the availability of a very large number
of finished and unfinished bacterial and archaeal
genomes - at the NCBI microbial genome database their
number is 1823 - stefins and cystatins were found in a surprisingly small number of genomes (Table 4). Further, in
the 68 archaeal genomes analyzed, neither stefins nor
cystatins were found. The observed distribution of stefins
and cystatins in bacterial genomes is therefore very limited and patchy. Mapping the presence and absence of
cystatins and stefins in the 25 bacterial phyla revealed that
cystatins are present in only two, and stefins in eight
phyla, in which they are not widespread (Table 4).

Cystatins are present in the following bacterial phyla: in
Bacteroidetes and in Proteobacteria (in the classes
Gamma- and Delta-proteobacteria). They were found in
four genera only: in Polaribacter, Vibrio, Photobacterium
and Geobacter. These organisms inhabit quite diverse ecological habitats and niches. Some are pathogens of
humans (V. cholerae and V. vulnificus), animal symbionts
(e.g. V. fischeri in the squid) or deep sea bacteria (Photobacterium). Some are present in sediment microcosm
(Geobacter) or are aerobic heterotrophic marine bacteria
that adhere to the surfaces of other marine organisms
(Polaribacter). In the case of the genus Geobacter seven
genomes are available at the NCBI microbial genome
database, but cystatin is present in only one (G. lovleyi). 44
genomes of the genus Vibrio are available at the NCBI
microbial genome database and cystatins were found in
20, but not in the pathogen V. cholerae (Figure 9). Two
genomes in the genus Polaribacter are available, and
cystatin was found in one species, P. dokdonensis. Cystatins
were found in all three available genomes in the genus
Photobacterium. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that
some Vibrio species possess small, diversified cystatin
families that originated by gene duplication (Figure 9).
The cystatin from Polaribacter (EAQ42446) is very interesting, since it shows the triplication of the cystatin
domain and gene fusion with another gene.
Stefins are present in eight bacterial phyla: Bacteroidetes,
Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes (in the class
Clostridia only), Proteobacteria (in the classes Beta-,
Gamma- and Delta-proteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes and Fusobacteria. Their extremely limited and
patchy distribution in bacterial genomes is striking, their
being found in 17 bacterial genera only: Bacteroides,
Chlorobium, Microcystis, Clostridium, Burkholderia,

thermophilic bacteria living in hot springs (Chlorobium
tepidum), while others are present in the sediments of uranium bioremediations (Geobacter uraniumreducens and
Lutiella) or in soil (Clostridium beijerinckii); others are biofilm-forming marine bacteria on the surface of eukaryotic
organisms (Pseudoalteromonas tunicata) or are widespread
toxic bloom-forming cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa).
Not only is this list of habitats unusual and diverse, but
the presence of stefins in the genomes of these genera is
also highly restricted. The question is, how widespread is
the distribution of stefins in these large congeneric collections of bacterial genomes. For several of the above mentioned genera a large number of genomes are available at
the NCBI - up to 62 in the case of Burkholderia. However,

their distribution in genomes of the congeneric species
also proves to be extremely limited. In the genus Bacteroides 28 genomes are available at the NCBI, but stefins are
present only in three, which in fact are strains of the same
species. The stefin from Bacteroides fragilis (CAH07101) is
very interesting, since it shows gene fusion with the chagasin gene. In the genus Chlorobium seven genomes are
available and stefins are present in only one, Chlorobium
tepidum. In the case of the genus Clostridium 60 genomes
are available, but stefins are present in only 15. Even more
striking is the sparse presence of stefins in the genus Burkholderia, for which no less than 62 genomes are available at the NCBI - stefins are present in only one. It is
interesting that, in the genus Vibrio, stefins are present in
25 out of 44 available genomes. However, 23 of these
genomes correspond to the 23 different strains of Vibrio

cholerae. Shewanella genus is represented by 21 genomes
at the NCBI, but stefins are present in only two. For the
remaining bacterial species where stefins were found,
from two to seven congeneric genomes are available and,
overall, stefins were found in a very limited number only
(Figure 9). This extensive and genome-wide analysis of
the distribution of stefins and cystatins in bacterial
genomes provides strong evidence for their very limited
distribution (Figure 9; additional file 10).
Distribution of stefins and cystatins in particular phyla is
also very interesting. Of 77 genomes available in the phylum Bacteroidetes, stefins were found in only three and
cystatins in two distinct genomes. In the phylum Chlorobi
(green sulphur bacteria) 12 genomes are available at the
NCBI, but stefins were found in a single genome only. 54
genomes are available for the phylum Cyanobacteria at
the NCBI, but stefins were found in only one. 160
genomes are available for the phylum Actinobacteria at
the NCBI, but stefins were found in only one. Two other
very large phyla, Firmicutes (458 genomes at the NCBI
microbial genome database) and Proteobacteria (817
genomes at the NCBI microbial genome database), provide the vast majority of the currently available bacterial
genomes, more than 1270 genomes, but despite such a
large collection the distribution of stefins, (in 39 genomes
out of 1275 available) and cystatins (in 19 genomes out
of 1275 available), in these major bacterial phyla is
extremely limited.
What is the reason for such a strange and patchy distribution of cystatin superfamily in bacterial genomes? A null
hypothesis is that they were present in the LUCA, but have
frequently been lost from their genomes. The major problem with this hypothesis is the patchy presence of cystatins and stefins in the densely sampled genomes of
numerous congeneric species. In the case of very large bacterial phyla we have no distribution pattern that can provide evidence for the presence of cystatins and stefins in
their ancestral lineages.
What are the functions of the newly acquired cystatins and stefins in
bacterial genomes?
Cystatins and stefins are the natural inhibitors of the
eukaryote-specific cysteine proteases, the cysteine cathepsins [3,4,9]. Since bacterial stefins and cystatins possess
the same highly conserved structural motifs as those in
eukaryotic organisms, they most probably inhibit the
cysteine proteases of their eukaryotic hosts (additional file
11). On the basis of the conserved secondary and 3D
structures (data not shown) we expect that the biochemistry of the bacterial stefins and cystatins will be similar to
that of the eukaryotic ones, with possible new structural
or functional roles regarding their activity, specificity and
targeting. The vast majority of prokaryotic genomes con-

and, since their natural inhibitors are chagasins [64], the
newly gained cystatins and stefins are unlikely to have
been acquired for the endogenous regulation of the bacterial cysteine proteases. Experimentally verified inhibition
of the eukaryotic, but not bacterial, cysteine protease
(cathepsin L) exists only for bacterial chagasin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [66]. It was proposed that the bacterial
chagasins may function as inhibitors of their own or of
the host cysteine proteases (as a novel virulence factors)
[64].
We suggest that cystatins and stefins have been acquired
and co-opted by a few bacterial organisms (pathogenic or
comensal), and later disseminated by HGT to a few ecologically closely located but taxonomically unrelated bacteria. Bacterial stefins and cystatins therefore most
probably function, like the protease inhibitors in eukaryotic pathogenic organisms, in the pathogen-host arms
race [51]. The bacterial cystatins and stefins could play an
important role in self defence or attack against host
inflammatory and immune responses, by inhibiting
cysteine cathepsins that are essential for host innate and
acquired immunity. Diverse species of bacteria (either free
living, symbionts or pathogens) may therefore modulate
host protective responses through inhibition of cathepsins involved in antigen processing and presentation [10].
The role of cystatins as immunomodulatory proteins or as
an important part of the innate immunity has been demonstrated in pathogenic nematodes [67]. Similarly, by
HGT, some bacteria have evolved independently a novel
anti-immune strategy to overcome host innate immunity.
While there is strong evidence that proteases are essential
virulence factors for prokaryotic and eukaryotic parasites
and pathogens during all stages of infection processes
[68,69], there are a very few cases where protease inhibitors have been shown to assist pathogens in invading the
eukaryotic hosts by inhibiting host proteases [51,70]. Stefins and cystatins with inhibitory spectra for diverse
eukaryotic C1 and C13 families of cysteine proteases [2,3]
are especially suited to inhibit the numerous eukaryotic
host cysteine proteases during infection. In this way, the
bacterial stefins and cystatins could function in the invasion and dissemination of the pathogens. One of the
major roles of HGT acquired cystatins and stefins in bacteria could be to evade host immunity (in the pathogenic
bacteria of animals and plants) or to protect them when
in close contact with diverse eukaryotic hosts. The situation could be similar to that documented in plants, where
cystatins are used in the defence against diverse viral,
microbial or eukaryotic pathogens and parasites
[34,50,71]. Previous studies have not considered bacterial
pathogens as employing cathepsin inhibition to evade
host defences, since no prokaryotic cystatins and stefins

were known. We suggest that some bacteria evolved the
mechanism to impair activation of the host immune
response by inhibiting certain cysteine cathepsins. Inhibition of antigen processing and presentation could account
for bacterial survival in the host, therefore the bacterial
cystatins and stefins may constitute emergency inhibitors
that defend the bacteria in acute cases of increased proteolysis [10,72,73].

Conclusion
A comprehensive survey of the cystatin superfamily, using
the extensive genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data
for Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota, has provided new
insights into their origin, evolution and classification.
Only two ancestral lineages, the stefins and the cystatins,
exist in bacterial and eukaryotic genomes. In addition, 20
vertebrate-specific and three angiosperm-specific orthologous families have been discovered. Bacterial cystatins
and stefins may be emergency inhibitors that enable survival of bacteria in the host, defending them from the
host's proteolysis. We expect that this study will stimulate
targeted functional and structural studies of the members
of the cystatin superfamily present in the particular
orthologous families in vertebrates and angiosperms, and
especially in diverse unicellular eukaryotes and bacteria.
