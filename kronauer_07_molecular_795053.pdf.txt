Abstract
Background: Army ants are the prime arthropod predators in tropical forests, with huge colonies
and an evolutionary derived nomadic life style. Five of the six recognized subgenera of Old World
Dorylus army ants forage in the soil, whereas some species of the sixth subgenus (Anomma) forage
in the leaf-litter and some as conspicuous swarm raiders on the forest floor and in the lower
vegetation (the infamous driver ants). Here we use a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial
DNA sequences to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Dorylus s.l. army ants and to infer the
evolutionary transitions in foraging niche and associated morphological adaptations.
Results: Underground foraging is basal and gave rise to leaf-litter foraging. Leaf-litter foraging in
turn gave rise to two derived conditions: true surface foraging (the driver ants) and a reversal to
subterranean foraging (a clade with most of the extant Dorylus s.s. species). This means that neither
the subgenus Anomma nor Dorylus s.s. is monophyletic, and that one of the Dorylus s.s. lineages
adopted subterranean foraging secondarily. We show that this latter group evolved a series of
morphological adaptations to underground foraging that are remarkably convergent to the basal
state.
Conclusion: The evolutionary transitions in foraging niche were more complex than previously
thought, but our comparative analysis of worker morphology lends strong support to the
contention that particular foraging niches have selected for very specific worker morphologies. The
surprising reversal to underground foraging is therefore a striking example of convergent
morphological evolution.

Background
Army ants are functionally defined by a suite of interrelated behavioural and morphological traits [1]: they are
obligate group predators, they frequently emigrate to new
nest sites, and their queens are permanently wingless and

highly specialized egg-layers. Some species conduct spectacular swarm raids, in which hundreds of thousands of
ants form a dense carpet that sweeps through areas of
1000 m2 or more on a single day in search of prey. However, this remarkable foraging behaviour is found in

rather few species, as most army ants have an inconspicuous, completely underground lifestyle.
Army ants in the dorylomorph clade (sometimes referred
to as the "true" army ants) form a monophyletic group
that originated in Gondwana in the mid-Cretaceous,
slightly over 100 million years ago [2,3]. With the subsequent break-up of this supercontinent, the clade split into
the New World army ants (subfamily Ecitoninae) and the
Old World army ants. The latter comprises three monophyletic subfamilies, the Dorylinae (with a primarily Afrotropical distribution), the Aenictinae (primarily
distributed in Asia and the Oriental region with fewer African species), and the enigmatic subfamily Aenictogitoninae, which is only known from nocturnal males that have
been sporadically collected at lights in sub-Saharan Africa,
and which has been inferred to be the sister taxon to the
Dorylinae [2,4,5]. Whether the Aenictogitoninae have all
the defining army ant traits will thus not be known until
colonies with workers and queens have been discovered.
The subfamily Dorylinae consists of the single genus Dorylus, which has been subdivided into six subgenera [6,7].
This subdivision has, however, not become generally
accepted [8]. Five of these subgenera are entirely subterranean, but the sixth subgenus Anomma encompasses both
species that hunt in the leaf-litter and species that forage
on the forest floor and in the vegetation. The latter are the
infamous "driver ants" [9], renown for their massive
swarm raids that overwhelm most invertebrates that do
not get out of their way and occasionally also small vertebrates [1].
A major reason for the confused taxonomy and classification of Dorylus s.l. is that most of the recognized species
have only been described from a single caste or sex [7].
The large and distinctive males, which were originally
described by Linné [10] as Vespa wasps and are known in
Africa as "sausage flies", are easily collected at light
sources during the night, but have rarely been taken from
nests together with workers or queens. The extreme
worker polymorphism within colonies and the difficulty
of finding the largest workers among the foragers of subterranean species poses an additional challenge to resolving the phylogenetic relationships between species and
species-groups with morphological data, because valid
comparisons of homologous character states can only be
made between workers of the same size. Finally, similar
worker morphologies in different species might reflect
convergent adaptations to specific foraging niches and
prey spectra rather than common ancestry.
In the present study we use DNA sequence data to overcome the problems mentioned in the previous paragraph
and to obtain an accurate and unbiased phylogeny for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/56

genus Dorylus. We use this phylogeny to reconstruct the
evolution of the driver ants from their subterranean ancestors, and to infer the morphological changes that have
occurred as putative adaptations to changes in foraging
niche. The DNA sequences also allow us to establish new
associations between males and workers for several species across the different subgenera, thus helping to clarify
Dorylus taxonomy.

Results
Phylogenetic analyses
The maximum likelihood (ML) topology (likelihood
score 17554.6) is given in Fig. 1 together with Bayesian
posterior probabilities and ML and maximum parsimony
(MP) bootstrap values for all nodes. All three methods
recovered very similar topologies: disagreements were
restricted to a few terminal taxa, mainly within the driver
ant clade, and none of these affected the conclusions to be
drawn.

The total evidence indicates that: 1. The Southeast Asian
monotypic subgenus Dichthadia is sister to the remaining
Dorylus s.l. species (although the respective node was collapsed in ML bootstrap analysis), confirming an earlier
inference by Brady [2]. 2. Each of the subgenera Alaopone,
Typhlopone, and Rhogmus is monophyletic according to the
taxon sample obtained for the present study. 3. The species of the subgenus Anomma that forage in the leaf-litter
are more closely related to subterranean species of the
subgenus Dorylus s.s., than to the surface swarm foraging
Anomma driver ants, which form a well supported clade.
The close phylogenetic relationship between the leaf-litter
Anomma species and the subgenus Dorylus s.s. (without D.
spininodis – see below) also emerges from the position of
the male of D. gribodoi, which clearly belongs to a clade of
leaf-litter Anomma species, although it was originally
described as belonging to the subgenus Dorylus s.s.. 4.
While most species of the subgenus Dorylus s.s. form a
clade nested within the leaf-litter Anomma species, D.
(Dorylus) spininodis is more distantly related and may be
the sister taxon to the remaining species of Dorylus s.s. plus
Anomma (although this inferred relationship has low statistical support and D. spininodis may even be more distantly related; Fig. 1). This implies that the subgenus
Anomma is paraphyletic and the subgenus Dorylus s.s. is
polyphyletic.
Male-worker associations
Pair-wise genetic distances of mitochondrial sequences
between closely related male-worker pairs were clearly
bimodally distributed with five values ≤ 0.003 and the
remaining five values ≥ 0.044 (Table 1). Using a 0.014 reference value for two distantly related specimens of Dorylus
(Anomma) molestus from the same population, we concluded that the first five pairs represent workers and males

of the same species. Some of the latter pairs may eventually turn out to belong to the same species as well once
additional data become available, because most of these
worker and male specimens came from distant populations (Table 2) so that our threshold value for sympatric
conspecifics is probably very conservative.
Reconstructing evolutionary transitions in foraging niche
MP and Bayesian analyses unambiguously reconstructed
three transitions in foraging niche (Fig. 2). The first transition from subterranean to leaf-litter foraging took place
between 34.1 and 29.9 million years ago (mya) (possible
range: 47.9 – 19.8 mya) along the branch leading to the
clade of Anomma plus Dorylus s.s. (without D. spininodis).

The second transition, a reversal from leaf-litter foraging
to subterranean foraging occurred between 22.9 and 16.8
mya (possible range: 32.2 – 11.3 mya) along the branch
leading to the Dorylus s.s. clade (again without D. spininodis). Finally, a transition from leaf-litter foraging to surface
swarm raiding occurred between 29.9 and 16.9 mya (possible range: 42.0 – 11.1 mya) along the branch leading to
the driver ant clade.
Morphological analyses
The variation in maximum head width, antennal scape
length, mandible length, and hind leg length was strongly
correlated with foraging niche (Nested ANOVA, p < 0.025
for all traits). When comparing these traits between the

Genetic distances were calculated from the mitochondrial DNA sequences. The distance between two worker specimens of Dorylus (Anomma)
molestus from the same population at Mt. Kenya is included as a reference (in bold). Pair-wise distances below 0.014 were inferred to characterize

species that reversed to subterranean foraging from leaflitter foraging and the extant leaf-litter species, we found
that all measurements were significantly smaller in the
former category (Fig. 3; Tukey's Studentized Range Test, p
< 0.001 in all cases). In fact, maximum head width, antennal scape length and hind leg length were all intermediate
between the extant leaf-litter foragers and the originally
subterranean species, while mandible length was even
smaller in the reversed than in the originally subterranean
species. With the reversal to subterranean foraging, species
of the subgenus Dorylus s.s. thus secondarily evolved a
similar morphology in four key traits related to foraging
performance and these convergent adaptations shifted
trait values fully back to or even beyond the values that
characterize the species that inherited subterranean foraging directly from the common ancestor of all Dorylus s.l.
species.

Discussion and Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the currently recognized
subgenera Anomma and Dorylus s.s. are not monophyletic.
The driver ants of the subgenus Anomma clearly form a
separate clade from the Anomma species that forage in the
leaf-litter, which are more closely related to the subterranean species of the subgenus Dorylus s.s. (Fig. 1). The confusion about the subgenera Anomma and Dorylus s.s. can
be traced back to the original descriptions of the leaf-litter
Anomma species D. kohli, D. gerstaeckeri, and D. emeryi and
of the subterranean D. (Dorylus) spininodis. Already Wasmann [11] pointed out that the workers of D. kohli
seemed transitional between driver ants and Dorylus s.s. in
both morphology and foraging habits. Because he
assumed that the largest workers, which were not available to him for examination, would resemble those of
driver ants, he assigned the species to Anomma [11]. Similarly, Emery [12] noted that workers of D. gerstaeckeri did
not fit well with his diagnosis of Anomma and our present
findings indicate that the male that he described as D.

(Dorylus) gribodoi might in fact be the male of D.
(Anomma) gerstaeckeri (Fig. 1, Table 1; although the
genetic distance does not fall below our conservative cutoff value). Furthermore, Mayr [13] described Dorylus
emeryi without reference to any subgenus, but the species
was later assigned to Anomma without explicit justification [6,14]. Finally, males of D. kohli have been collected
together with workers by J. van Boven and are now shown
to be identical to males that have originally been
described as a Dorylus s.s. species (W. Gotwald and CS,
unpublished). It has thus always been acknowledged that
males of leaf-litter Anomma species are morphologically
more similar to males of the subgenus Dorylus s.s. than to
the males of Anomma driver ants, but their correct associations were not established until the present study.
At the same time spurious assumptions and imprecise
subgenus definitions have led to the incorrect assignment
of the workers of leaf-litter species to the subgenus
Anomma. While the workers of Dorylus spininodis (along
with those of D. politus, which could not be included in
this study) were recognized as clearly distinct from the
Dorylus s.s. species of the "D. affinis species group" because
they lack caudally projecting spines at the frontal carinae
(a pair of longitudinal ridges between the antennal sockets and the anterior sclerite), the species was nevertheless
assigned to the subgenus Dorylus s.s. [15]. We thus conclude that the subgenera Anomma and Dorylus s.s. are not
monophyletic, that suspicions of this have existed for a
long time but only make sense in light of our present data,
and that the current subgenus classification cannot be
upheld. We will formally propose the necessary taxonomic and nomenclature changes elsewhere.
Our results further show that the differences in life-style
between Dorylus s.l. species are not merely the result of a
simple unidirectional development from subterranean
foraging to surface swarm raiding, as has been assumed so

far [16], but that there has also been a reversal from leaflitter foraging to subterranean foraging (Fig. 2). Previous
analyses of Dorylus s.l. worker morphology already
showed that shifts in foraging niche are correlated with
changes in several morphological adaptations [17].
Longer hind legs increase running speed on the soil surface and allow the ants to carry larger prey items [18],
whereas shorter legs are probably adaptive in subterranean species which hunt in narrow tunnels [19]. Similarly, larger heads can accommodate larger mandibular
muscles so that workers can bite more fiercely [20]. Large
heads and mandibles are thus likely to be adaptative in
driver ants, which have to defend their nests and foraging

or migration columns against vertebrate predators (such
as chimpanzees, gorillas, Jackson's mongooses and pangolins) [1,21] and that benefit from being able to cut up
larger prey. Longer antennae, on the other hand, may
allow workers to follow pheromone trails at higher speed
while avoiding collisions [22], which seems adaptive on
open trails with a high volume of traffic. While an earlier
analysis [17] treated all species with subterranean foraging as a single monophyletic group, our present phylogenetic study shows that the subterranean Dorylus s.l. species
consist of two clades and that one of them has secondarily
re-evolved subterranean foraging and many of the morphological adaptations to an entirely subterranean life-

The evolution of foraging niche in Dorylus s.l. army ants
Figure 2
The evolution of foraging niche in Dorylus s.l. army ants. The most parsimonious reconstruction of the evolutionary
transitions is illustrated by different branch colours, while the Bayesian reconstruction with the highest posterior probability is
indicated with coloured rectangles at the relevant nodes. Age estimates (clocks) for key nodes are given in million years ago
(mya), after fixing the most recent common ancestor of Dorylus s.l. at 45.6 mya [2]; see text for ranges. The phylogeny was
obtained by Bayesian analysis of a dataset from which males had been excluded. Subgenera are abbreviated as in Fig. 1. Photographs to the right depict workers of representative species with different foraging niches and illustrate the differences in relative leg length, mandible length, and antennal scape length associated with the three foraging niches (all pictures are the same
scale and all workers have a maximum head width of 2.27 mm; from top to bottom: 1. D. (An.) arcens (surface swarm raiding),

style (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Our present findings thus give strong
independent support for the inference of Schöning et al.
[17] that many worker allometries of army ants represent
adaptations to specific foraging niches, as we now know
that the subterranean syndrome evolved twice convergently.
Our present study establishes that subterranean foraging
is ancestral in Dorylus s.l. and that leaf-litter foraging and
surface swarm raiding originated later. The imprecise age
estimates resulting from the lack of Dorylus s.l. fossils
make inferences regarding environmental conditions at
the time of ecological niche shifts speculative. It is never-

theless interesting to note that the transition to surface
swarm raiding and the reversal to subterranean foraging
may have occurred at approximately the same time (Fig.
2). This raises the interesting question why one group of
army ants reverted to the subterranean foraging niche,
which was already occupied by distant relatives, roughly
at the same time that a second group began to exploit the
entirely new niche of surface swarm raiding. How foraging
niches evolved in the other army ant lineages and whether
the common ancestor of all army ants also hunted in the
soil is as yet unknown. This information, combined with
data on prey spectra and distributional ranges, will be crucial to infer under which conditions the army ant life-style

Relative residuals from niche regression
Relative residuals from best-fit regression models over the common size distribution of workers for thirteen
Dorylus s.l. species in the different foraging niche categories. We distinguished between four categories of foraging
niche: The surface swarm raiding Anomma driver ant species ("surface swarm"), the leaf-litter Anomma species ("leaf-litter"), the
species that inherited subterranean foraging from the common ancestor of the genus Dorylus ("original subterranean"), and the
Dorylus s.s. species that adopted subterranean foraging secondarily ("reversal subterranean"). Four key morphological traits
were analysed: Maximum head width (HWmax), mandible length (ML), antennal scape length (SL), and hind leg length (HLL).
Niche category had a significant effect on all traits (Nested ANOVA, p < 0.025 for all traits). Significant differences (Tukey's
Studentized Range Test, p < 0.05) are indicated by different letters.

evolved, which general factors promoted the subsequent
niche shifts in different lineages, and where these transitions took place. Finally, detailed comparative analyses of
worker morphology in the other army ant clades are
needed to establish whether they also show correlated
shifts in foraging niche and morphological traits of workers.

Methods
Taxon sampling
Our sample for DNA sequencing consisted of a total of 38
Dorylus s.l. specimens, both males and workers, representing all six recognized subgenera (see Table 2). Eciton
burchellii (Ecitoninae) and three species of Aenictus

(Aenictinae) were used as outgroups, but no fresh material of Aenictogitoninae was available. All specimens were
collected and stored in 96% ethanol until DNA extraction.
Molecular protocols
DNA was extracted from ant legs using the DNeasy® kit
from QIAGEN®. Two fragments from the mitochondrial
cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene and one fragment from the
mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II (COII) gene were
amplified in standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
using primers LCO/HCO [23] and Jerry [24]/Ben [25] for
COI and primers tRNALeu/Barbara [24] for COII. In addition, we amplified a fragment of the nuclear wingless (wg)
gene using primers wg1/wg2 [26]. The tRNALeu primer

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:56

(5' CAGATTAGTGCAATGAATTTAAGT 3') was specifically
designed for this study to replace primer George [24] to
avoid the amplification of pseudogenes [27]. The annealing temperature was 45°C for all mitochondrial primers
and 58°C for wg. We used a concentration of 2.5 mM
MgCl2 in all reactions. PCR products were purified using a
MicroSpin® kit from Omega Bio-Tek. Automated fluorescent dye sequencing was conducted on an Applied Biosystems 3130 × l Genetic Analyzer or reactions were sent to a
sequencing facility (MWG-Biotech) using the forward
primer and, in many cases, also the reverse primer. In several cases where clean sequences could not be obtained
due to co-amplification of probable pseudogenes, PCR
products were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning® kit
from Invitrogen® and sequences were obtained from one
or several clones. We generated a final concatenated alignment of 1957 base pairs (bp) of sequence data, consisting
of 1007 bp from COI, 547 bp from COII, and 403 bp from
wg. Of these, 923 sites were variable and 740 sites were
parsimony informative. Sequences have been deposited
in GenBank and accession numbers are given in Table 2.
All sequences used in this study are new, except for D. orientalis and the wg sequences for D. laevigatus, A. aratus,
and A. laeviceps, which are from Brady [2].
Phylogenetic analyses
Several sequences with frame-shift mutations were discarded from the alignment as non-functional pseudogenes. The remaining DNA sequences were translated into
amino acid sequences using the program MEGA 2.1 [28].
This did not reveal any stop codons that could have been
indicative of additional pseudogenes, but made us
exclude one more sequence from the alignment, because
of an extremely high rate of unique amino acid substitutions (GenBank accession number [EF413886]). For several driver ant species, we obtained two alternative,
potentially functional sequences for COII. One of them
(obtained with primers George/Barbara) was identical
across all species, indicating that it represented a nuclear
pseudogene with a much lower mutation rate (GenBank
accession number [EF413885]) [27], which we thus
excluded. The second (obtained with primers tRNALeu/
Barbara) was variable across species to an extent similar to
what we observed for the other mitochondrial sequences
and was thus assumed to be the true mitochondrial
sequence.

Because all sequences are protein coding, alignment could
be done unambiguously by eye in a text editor. To detect
additional potential pseudogenes that would confound
phylogenetic inference and to evaluate congruence among
data sets, we conducted independent MP analyses of the
single gene fragments with 1000 bootstrap replicates
using heuristic searches, ACCTRAN character optimization and tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/56

with steepest descent in PAUP*4.0b10 [29] with E.
burchellii and three Aenictus species (Table 2) as outgroups. All well supported relationships were highly concordant across the different data partitions, except for two
relationships within the Anomma driver ant clade (results
not shown). This ambiguity was probably due to
sequences for a number of driver ant taxa being unavailable in some of the data partitions as they had been
excluded as probable pseudogenes (Table 2), which
affected the resolution of relationships within that clade.
However, some ambiguity in the precise relationships
within the driver ants does not affect the overall conclusions of our study. We thus combined the data in a full
evidence approach for all further analyses. The concatenated dataset was subjected to MP analysis in PAUP* as
has been described for the single data partitions.
The best fitting model of DNA evolution for Bayesian
analyses was selected for each codon position for both
mitochondrial (COI + COII) and nuclear (wg) sequences
with MrModeltes v2 [30], comparing 24 nested models
with hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRT). The best
model to explain the data was a general time reversible
model with an estimated proportion of invariable sites
and gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (GTR + I + G)
for first and second mitochondrial codon positions, a
GTR + G model for third mitochondrial codon positions,
a HKY model for first nuclear codon positions and a K80
model for second and third nuclear codon positions.
Bayesian analyses were performed with MrBayes v3.1.2
[31]. To assure convergence of Markov Chain Monte
Carlo runs we repeated the analysis three times beginning
with independent starting trees. In each analysis, one cold
and three heated chains were run in parallel for 1 × 106
generations and trees were sampled every 100 generations. The first 1001 trees were discarded as burnin and
the consensus tree was calculated from the remaining
9000 trees in PAUP*4.0b10 [29]. E. burchellii was used as
the single outgroup in MrBayes v3.1.2 [31], following [24].
For ML analyses, the best model of DNA evolution for the
concatenated dataset was chosen among 56 nested models with Modeltest 3.7 [32]. The best model to explain the
data, both according to hLRT and the Akaike information
criterion, was a general time reversible model with an estimated proportion of invariable sites and gamma distributed rate heterogeneity (GTR + I + G). ML searches were
performed in GARLI v0.942 [33], which implements the
GTR + I + G model as default, using the same outgroups
as in MP analyses. The run was repeated three times from
random starting trees using default termination conditions. GARLI v0.942 [33] was also used to generate 1000
ML nonparametric bootstrap replicates which were used

Male-worker associations
We computed uncorrected pairwise distances of mitochondrial DNA sequences between male and worker specimens in MEGA 2.1 [28] when the phylogenetic analyses
indicated that they were closely related. We compared
these distances to the genetic distance between two specimens of D. (Anomma) molestus collected from the same
population at Mt. Kenya to identify a conservative cut-off
point for inferring whether males and workers likely
belonged to the same species.
Reconstructing evolutionary transitions in foraging niche
For the reconstruction of evolutionary transitions in foraging niche we excluded all males from the dataset,
because the foraging niche of their associated workers was
unknown (they had been light trapped) and in most cases
the species was likely to be represented also by a worker
specimen for which we had that ecological information.
Data on foraging niche were based on direct observations
or on information from the literature [17]. We investigated the evolution of foraging niche in Dorylus s.l. army
ants under MP using the computer program MacClade 4.0
[34] on the Bayesian topology obtained from MrBayes
v3.1.2 [31]. The latter program was also used to obtain
Bayesian posterior probabilities of foraging niche at different nodes. Foraging niche was added as a standard
character to the data matrix in a separate partition while
constraining one node of interest in each individual run.
We used the same model and chain parameters that have
been described above. Ordered character states for foraging niche (subterranean – leaf-litter – surface swarm raiding) were assumed in all analyses, because it is most
plausible that army ants adapt only gradually to more
exposed foraging strata.
Morphological analyses
To evaluate the hypothesis that the relative dimensions of
key morphological traits represent adaptations to different foraging niches, we examined the following traits in
workers of thirteen species (Table 3): Maximum head
width (the maximum measurable width across the head),
mandible length (the distance between the apex of the left
mandible and the proximal point of the ventral ridge
when the mandibles are fully opened with forceps),
antennal scape length (the maximum straight line scape
length excluding the basal condyle), and hind leg length
(the maximum length of the left hind leg from trochanter
to tarsal tip in dorsal view with the leg fully extended).

For these morphometric analyses we selected about 100
workers (preserved in 70% ethanol) from at least three
colonies (50 workers from a single colony if insufficient

samples were available) from the same study site for each
species to cover the entire worker size range as much as
possible. Ideally, workers from more colonies per species
should have been included in our analysis to better cover
the total intraspecific variation of morphological traits,
but this was not possible because most species are only
rarely collected so that larger samples are not available.
We assume, however, that our morphological analysis
based on a few colonies is fairly representative for the species as a whole, because measurement data on driver ants
show that variation within and between populations of
the same species is much less than variation between species (C. Schöning, unpublished). All measurements were
taken using a MS 5 Leica stereomicroscope fitted with an
ocular micrometer, using methods recommended by Seifert [35] to minimise measurement errors (magnifications
10× – 64×). Dry mass (measured after drying specimens at
60°C for 48 h) was used as an indicator of overall body
size. The statistical analysis followed Schöning et al. [17].
In order to compare the relative size of traits between
workers of different species we first established the best fit
model for raw linear data from all species combined over
their common body size range (0.29 mg – 1.50 mg) as a
function of dry mass1/3 by stepwise multiple regression.
The relative residuals (absolute residuals divided by the
predicted values) from this common regression model
were then compared in a Nested ANOVA with foraging
niche category (original subterranean – leaf-litter – surface
swarm raiding – reversal subterranean) as a fixed factor
and species as a random factor nested within foraging
niche category. Tukey's Studentized Range (HSD) Test was
employed to examine differences between categories. Statistical analyses of morphometric data were performed
with SAS (Version 9.1).
Divergence dating
The same dataset and topology that were used to reconstruct evolutionary transitions in foraging niche (see
above) were also used for divergence dating analysis.
Branch lengths were estimated in PAUP*4.0b10 [29]
under maximum likelihood with a GTR + I + G model of
DNA substitution. The model with a molecular clock
enforced (-ln 15494.5) was compared with a model without a molecular clock (-ln 15433.9) using a likelihood
ratio test. The null model of rate constancy (the molecular
clock) was rejected at p < 0.001 (28 df). Prior to dating
analyses, E. burchellii was pruned from the phylogram to
avoid ambiguity about the placement of the root. Dating
analyses were conducted with the program r8s v. 1.7 [36],
using penalized likelihood [37], the TN algorithm and an
additive penalty function. The smoothing parameter was
chosen using cross-validation of parameter values as
implemented in r8s v. 1.7 [36]. Solutions were checked
with the "checkGradient" command. Because no Dorylus
s.l. fossils are known that could have been used to cali-

brate the analysis, we had to rely on earlier published
dates that were calibrated with fossils in the frame of a
larger scale molecular phylogeny of army ants and their
relatives [2]. To cover a range of reasonable dates for each
node, we ran three analyses, using the mean, upper and
lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the most
recent common ancestor of Dorylus s.l. (45.6, 64.0, 30.0
million years ago, respectively) [[2], Brady pers. comm.]
