Abstract
Background: Prediction of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in Arabidopsis has become
increasingly critical with the explosion of genomic data now available for both gene expression and
gene sequence composition. We have shown in previous work [1], that a combination of
correlation measurements and cis-regulatory element (CRE) detection methods are effective in
predicting targets for candidate transcription factors for specific case studies which were validated.
However, to date there has been no quantitative assessment as to which correlation measures or
CRE detection methods used alone or in combination are most effective in predicting TF→target
relationships on a genome-wide scale.
Results: We tested several widely used methods, based on correlation (Pearson and Spearman
Rank correlation) and cis-regulatory element (CRE) detection (≥1 CRE or CRE overrepresentation), to determine which of these methods individually or in combination is the most
effective by various measures for making regulatory predictions. To predict the regulatory targets
of a transcription factor (TF) of interest, we applied these methods to microarray expression data
for genes that were regulated over treatment and control conditions in wild type (WT) plants.
Because the chosen data sets included identical experimental conditions used on TF overexpressor or T-DNA knockout plants, we were able to test the TF→target predictions made using
microarray data from WT plants, with microarray data from mutant/transgenic plants. For each
method, or combination of methods, we computed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
predictive value and the F-measure of balance between sensitivity and positive predictive value
(precision). This analysis revealed that the ≥1 CRE and Spearman correlation (used alone or in
combination) were the most balanced CRE detection and correlation methods, respectively with
regard to their power to accurately predict regulatory-target interactions.
Conclusion: These findings provide an approach and guidance for researchers interested in
predicting transcriptional regulatory mechanisms using microarray data that they generate (or
microarray data that is publically available) combined with CRE detection in promoter sequence
data.

Background
Transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have been shown
to control metabolic pathways, developmental and cellular processes as well as other functions within the plant as
described previously 2-4. Recent work in many eukaryotic
species has focused on a Systems Biology approach, using
multiple associations between genes, to elucidate regulatory networks and to understand their biological context
[5,6]. These associations can be used in combination with
gene expression data from microarray experiments and
promoter sequence analysis of co-regulated genes, to infer
the mechanism for this co-regulation and to search for cisregulatory elements (CREs) that may coordinate this
response through transcription factor (TF) activity.
Microarray data analysis can be used to determine sets of
genes in the genome that are under coordinate control in
response to external treatments [7], or from endogenous
signals within the plant such as hormones [8,9]. While
this type of analysis can determine the set of genes that are
regulated under specific experimental conditions, it does
not identify specific cis or trans acting components
involved in this regulation. However, the set of co-regulated genes can be used to identify candidate TF→target
relationships using pair-wise associations between TFs
and targets based on correlation over microarray data
and/or putative CRE detection. This methodology takes
advantage of the current data on CRE binding sites for
transcription factors as well as current annotation for transcription factors in Arabidopsis available in databases such
as AGRIS [10]. Using these data in conjunction with pairwise correlation data allows one to associate TFs with
putative co-regulated targets. Previous studies from our
group, have shown that analyzing the co-regulation of
genes across various experimental conditions in combination with CRE analysis of predicted target gene promoters
has been effective in predicting new targets for transcription factors which were then experimentally validated
[1,11].
Several currently available database tools including
CSB.DB [12], ACT [13], and ATTEDII [14], have used an
approach similar to the one described above to predict
TF→target relationships to that described above. Specifically, ATTEDII uses microarray data to try to make associations between genes using co-expression alone or
correlation in conjunction with CRE analysis. Other tools
such as CERMT [15] and ASIDB [16], have focused on
using time-course data to identify specific temporal patterns to elucidate transcription factor targets. However, all
of these methods rely on a fixed database (of microarrays
and CRE elements) and/or analysis format. Consequently,
they do not provide a great deal of flexibility for users who
may be interested in using their own microarray data, or
to adjust the parameters of an analysis (e.g. changing cor-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/435

relation CRE over-representation significance by looking
at different p-value cutoffs) for both correlation and CRE
methods.
We were thus motivated to develop an approach for predicting regulatory relationships of TF→targets that could
exploit microarray data of any design or size, and could
encompass any CRE database of interest. Our goal was to
test combinations of existing methods for correlation and
CRE detection to make predictions for TF→target relationships, which we would then test using microarray data
from transgenic/mutant plants for that TF. Our approach
is generally applicable for use on genomic sequence and
microarray data for plants and any other species for which
whole genome data is available.
To evaluate the most effective methods for predicting TFtarget pairs, for each microarray data set, we first used regulated genes in wild type (WT) plants to predict targets of
a particular regulated TF of interest, using both correlation
and/or CRE detection methods. We then tested these TFtarget predictions using a list of genes shown to be "significantly misregulated (based on ANOVA) in either a TF
over-expressor transgenic line or a TF knock-out line.
Next, we computed various performance measures including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
value and the F-measure of balance between sensitivity
and positive predictive value. We also tested the performance of several of these measures over all of the expressed
genes represented on the ATH1 chip - e.g. not only the regulated genes.
We believe that our methodology and resulting information will help guide investigators who may have a variety
of microarray and CRE datasets and informatic needs for
evaluating potential candidates for regulators of responses
to various stimuli in plants.

Results
Regulatory Predictions using Correlation and Cis
Regulatory Element (CRE) Analysis
In order to determine putative targets of transcription factors (TFs) in the Arabidopsis genome, we have used and
combined several existing methods for correlation (Pearson and Spearman Rank (Spearman) correlation) and
CRE analysis. Despite the widespread use of correlation
methods in the past, we know very little about the performance of these methods (either alone or in combination with CRE detection) in making TF→target
predictions, especially using microarray and sequence
data. Furthermore, we do not know how these methods
compare to each other in making such predictions. Our
goal is to compare the performance of these methods and
combinations of methods to each other.

Pair-wise correlation analysis, used alone or in conjunction with CRE data, has been shown to be a promising
method for predicting TF targets in several studies
[1,11,17,18]. Previous studies [13,14] have used Pearson
correlation, which indicates the strength and direction of
a linear relationship between the expression patterns of
two genes over different experimental conditions. Several
other correlation methods for making these predictions
are also available. Among these are the Spearman's Rank
correlation (Spearman correlation) which is a non-parametric correlation measure that is similar to the Pearson
correlation, but it is computed on the ranks of the data
points rather than their measured values. We have evaluated these correlation methods, as they are currently being
used for the prediction of linear gene associations using
microarray expression data. For each correlation method,
a gene is identified as a predicted target, if the p-value of
the correlation measure between TF and candidate target
is below a cutoff determined by a 5% False Discovery Rate
(FDR), (see Methods).
To detect regulatory interactions between TFs and candidate target genes we also used two different methods of
CRE analysis, based on a search for known CRE elements
within the promoter region of Arabidopsis genes (see
Methods). The first of these methods computed the frequency in the upstream region of select genes (either from
regulated gene lists or from the whole genome) of CRE
binding sites that bound to at least one member of a transcription factor family (Note: CRE binding sites were
taken from the AGRIS database [10] and manual curation
of the literature). Detection of CREs in the promoter DNA
Sequence of candidate genes was performed using the RSA
Tools DNA Pattern Search Tool [19]. Another method
involved determining which CRE binding sites in the
upstream region of select genes were at a frequency higher
than what would be expected by chance [1,20]. For this,
we computed an empirical p-value for the null hypothesis
that the CRE frequency observed in a gene of interest is
typical of what is seen in the genome as a whole. P-values
for each CRE in a given target gene were determined by
counting the number of genes in the genome with a CRE
frequency greater than or equal to the observed CRE frequency in the given target gene, and then dividing it by the
total number of genes in the genome (see Methods). This
second approach provided us with a method for narrowing the number of potential TF targets. The motivation for
this approach was based on the hypothesis that the greater
the number of CRE binding sites, the greater the probability that the TF of interest will bind to one of these sites and
activate the gene in vivo [21].
Since these two CRE detection methods use experimentally verified links between TFs and their known CRE targets, they provide putative interactions between TFs and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/435

Targets containing such CREs in their promoters. Other
direct methods for CRE discovery (e.g. novel CRE detection algorithms such as MEME [22]) generally do not provide any data on possible TF interaction. A notable
exception to this is CEG (correlation between expression
and a defined group of genes) [14], which tries to associate a novel CRE by comparing genes that are correlated
with TF expression. However, this method results in candidate CREs that have to be experimentally verified to
determine if they are functional.
More complex CRE detection methods include identifying
combinations of CREs that may be mediating regulatory
activities through several TF candidates and use of phylogenetic footprinting techniques to uncover conserved
CREs between related species [23,24]. However, these
methods introduce many uncontrollable variables such as
effective binding site proximity for shared activity, conservation of genome structure between plant species and
known regulatory interaction networks, all which have
not been extensively characterized in plants. We therefore
focused on using known CREs and detection of single
binding sites (and/or overrepresentation of CRE sites), as
this approach does not involve many assumptions about
the regulome and its implementation. Several studies 2527 have shown that effecting a single CRE in a promoter
region is sufficient to alter plant function and we have also
shown in previous work [1] that this method is effective
in elucidating transcriptional regulators (see discussion
for further details). Our proposed methodology therefore
stands as an effective and broad based approach that
allows for the detection of diverse transcription factors
mediating biological responses. The source code for both
the correlation and CRE detection tools we have
employed in our analysis are available at http://
nitro.bio.nyu.edu/regulatoryprediction/. A schema for
our overall approach to TF →target predictions based on
correlation and CRE, as well as validation is shown in Figures 1 &3
In order to evaluate these correlation and CRE detection
methods for their robustness in making correct TF→target
predictions over different datasets, we used several publicly available microarray datasets to test their predictive
value. These datasets were all processed and evaluated
using the same methodology in order to avoid any bias in
the analytical methods (see Methods). Datasets were chosen based on their design involving both wild-type (WT)
microarray data as well as microarray data for the mutation of a transcription factor under set treatment conditions for both WT and mutant. In our first test, as outlined
in Figure 1, all regulated genes in WT were considered to be
candidate targets of the TF, and only those TFs that were
regulated under the conditions in which they were treated
were used (in order to incorporate correlation prediction

Conceptual pipeline for TF→target predictions based on correlation and/or CRE analysis: Performed on Regulated Genes. Each data set (3 microarray datasets covering 4 transcription factors, see Table 1) has been subjected to the
analysis outlined in Figure 1. For each transcription factor, we predicted 8 different gene lists of potential target genes* using
Correlation analysis, CRE detection methods, or the combination of Correlation and CRE analysis methods. The first four lists
were predictions made using only Correlation or CRE detection methods. The succeeding four gene lists, were generated by
the intersection of predicted targets from Correlation and CRE methods. Misregulation was determined by comparing wild
type microarray data, in which the TF is shown to be regulated, and micoarray data from TF mutant/transgenic (transgenic
over-expressor). Both data sets contain replicates (at least 2 replicates) from each dataset. Performance was then evaluated
using specificity, sensitivity NPV, PPV and the F-measure as statisitcal measures. TFs: Transcription Factors, OVER-CRE: overrepresented CRE binding sites, >= 1: greater than equal to 1 CRE binding site

analysis does not make any assumption whether this interaction is direct or indirect, or that these predictions are at all inclusive. The possibility that this interaction could be direct is addressed further in the Discussion.

methods) in the analysis. Predictions were made using
correlation and/or CRE predictions using all of these regulated genes, resulting in a subset of putative candidate target genes for the TF. These candidate target predictions
were then validated using the mutant/transgenic microarray data for the candidate TF, by determining how many
of the predicted targets were misregulated in the mutant/
transgenic. We measured the performance of pair-wise
correlation and CRE detection methods, by performing
correlation and CRE analysis over each individual dataset
included in this analysis (see below). The predictions
made were for the TF mutagenized in each individual
dataset. The overall scheme for this approach to testing
and validating methods for TF→target predictions is
shown in Figure 1.
Testing of Regulatory Prediction Methods using Publicly
Available Microarray Data
To evaluate the predictive value for TF→target relationships made based on the correlation and CRE methods
mentioned above and shown in Figure 1, we chose datasets involving a range of diverse treatment conditions
(light, pathogen infection, abiotic stress and hormone
treatment) and microarray data resulting from the mutagenesis of diverse transcription factor families, some of
which such as ZF-HD and WRKY belong to plant-specific
transcription factor families, in order to determine a
benchmark for the performance of each prediction
method in analyzing data from Arabidopsis thaliana.

The MIF1 (ZF-HD family) microarray dataset compared
the responses of a 35S:MIF1 over-expressor and WT plants
to light vs. dark treatment conditions [28]. The ARR7
(MYB-like TF) microarray dataset compared the response
of a 35S:ARR7 over-expressor vs. WT to the plant hormone cytokinin treatment [29]. And finally, The
WRKY11/17 microarray dataset compared the pathogen
response of two redundant T-DNA knockout lines for
WRKY 11 and 17 to WT over a time-course experiment
comprising four different time points [30]. A summary of
the datasets used in this analysis is listed in Table 1. These

datasets were chosen based on 3 criteria i) the microarray
data was generated using a specific treatment of WT and
mutant/transgenic plants with relative controls; ii) replicate experiments for both treated and control conditions
in WT and mutant/transgenic treatments; and iii) the transcription factor under study (e.g. transgenic/mutant) was
one whose expression is itself regulated in WT treatment
conditions compared to relative controls.
Microarray data were processed as described, and differential expression of genes in WT data was determined using
ANOVA (see Methods). This approach allowed us the
advantage of narrowing down the list of potential candidate genes to only those that were specifically regulated
over the conditions in each microarray datasets. This list
of regulated genes also included the TF of interest, which
was necessary in order to perform correlation analysis to
predict potential targets amongst the regulated target
genes. The performance measures across these datasets
were then evaluated to determine if a consistent pattern
for the performance of these regulatory prediction methods could be found across a variety of experimental datasets.
Evaluation of Regulatory Prediction Methods Using
Statistical Tests
To evaluate the performance of these methods for TF→target predictions, we measured the specificity, sensitivity,
predictive values (positive and negative) and the F measure (balance between sensitivity and positive predictor
value (PPV)) for each of these tests. In the context of our
validation study, a gene is said to be a "target of the TF in
question (direct or indirect) if that gene is significantly
misregulated in the mutant/transgenic TF microarray data
(based on ANOVA). Thus, a gene is defined to be a true
target if the p-value for the null hypothesis of no change
is below a threshold value determined by demanding a
nominal false discovery fraction (FDR) of 5% (see Discussion section for limitations of this method). The equations used for these performance measures are described
below.

Specificity in this instance is defined as:

Specificity =

TN
(TN + FP )

Where TN is the number of true negatives (genes that are
not misregulated and not predicted to be targets) and FP
is the number of false positives (genes that are predicted
to be targets but are not misregulated).
Sensitivity is defined as:

Sensitivity =

TP
(TP + FN )

Where TP is the number of true positive (genes that are
predicted to be targets in the WT and are misregulated in
mutant/transgenic microarray data) and FN is the number
of genes that are not predicted to be targets but are misregulated in the mutant/transgenic microarray dataset.
And finally, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictor
values are defined by the equations PPV = (TPTPFP ) and
+
TN
NPV = (TN + FN ) respectively, with the aforementioned

definition of variables.
As any test can be skewed in favor of the positive predictive value at the expense of sensitivity or vise versa, we also
computed the balance between PPV and sensitivity. In
order to quantify this balance between these two measures for out various methods of predicting regulatory
interactions, we computed a statistical measure borrowed
from information retrieval called the F-measure.
The F measure is the harmonic mean of the sensitivity and
PPV. It is given by the equation

F = 2X

(PPV )(SEN )
(PPV + SEN )

Where PPV is the positive predictive value and SEN is the
sensitivity. The equation for F measure is sometimes
stated in terms of precision and recall which in the current
vernacular of bioinformatics and genomics literature are
equivalent to PPV and sensitivity, respectively [31].
Using Regulated Gene Lists to Determine the
Performance of Regulatory Prediction Methods
Using the approaches described above, we analyzed three
select datasets of microarray data from wild-type (WT)
and three TF mutants/transgenics (MIF1, ARR7, and
WRKY11/17) 28-30 to determine how well these prediction methods performed in predicting TF→target relation-

ships (Figure 2). For the MIF1 microarray datasets [28], we
found that the Pearson correlation as well as the CRE prediction methods and the combined correlation/CRE
methods, had a high specificity for the regulatory target
predictions of putative targets of MIF1 (Figure 2D) and a
correspondingly low sensitivity (compared to other prediction methods) in most cases (Figure 2B). The PPV was
relatively high across all measures (Figure 2A). The NPV
was relatively low across almost all measures (Figure 2E).
An interesting exception to this, however, is the ≥ 1 CRE
method, which has a high performance across all performance measures (including NPV), indicating that this
prediction method has a very high probability for success
in predicting MIF1 targets (see Additional file 1 Table S1).
This result was intriguing and unexpected, as the binding
site for MIF1 is the "Core Consensus Sequence (ATTA)
(Tan 2006), which is found at a high frequency in promoter regions of the Arabidopsis genome, most likely due
to the fact that the genome is AT rich in its promoter
sequence content [32]. Finding this MIF1 site at such a
high frequency, one would expect maximal coverage in
capturing a high number of genes that are regulated/misregulated (high sensitivity), but it is a surprising finding
that this method also has a high positive predictive value
(i.e. a high ratio true positives to false positives (positive
predictive value)) (Figure 2A).
It is also noteworthy that the Spearman correlation has a
substantially higher F-measure when compared to Pearson correlation with or without the combination of the
CRE detection methods, due to its high sensitivity in capturing more misregulated genes than any of the other correlation methods (Figure 2C). The superior performance
of the Spearman correlation is most likely due to the fact
that the Spearman correlation is a nonparametric correlation measure that does not require a linear relationship
between a TF and target gene and therefore is more flexible in capturing the relationship between these genes
across expression data.
We find slightly different results in the case of the ARR7 TF
microarray dataset [29]. As in MIF1 TF dataset above, we
did find a high specificity and positive predictive value for
the prediction of ARR7 targets using Pearson and Spearman correlation as well as CRE over-representation and
most combined correlation/CRE detection measures and
a correspondingly low sensitivity (Figure 2). However, we
found that the specificity was much lower in the ≥ 1 CRE
method in contrast to the results of the MIF1 data analysis
(Figure 2D). Also, we found that the negative predictive
value for all methods is consistently higher than seen in
other datasets (see Additional file 1 Tables S1 and S3, Figure 2E). This reflects the lower ratio of false negatives (FN)
to true negatives (TN), which indicates that in this dataset
these tests gave more accurate negative calls. Also, as in the

case of the MIF1 dataset, the ≥ 1 CRE method has a high F
measure (Figure 2C), due to its high sensitivity (Figure 2B)
and PPV (Figure 2A) (and Additional file 1 Table S2) and
the Spearman correlation shows a high F measure when
compared to other correlation methods (Figure 2C).
One of the CREs used for the analysis of ARR7 was the
ARR1AT [33] which binds two component response regulator transcription factors (Arabidopsis response regulator or
ARR), which is a sub class of MYB-like transcription factors. For this study, we used all experimentally validated
binding sites for a TF family in order to best capture the

binding relationship between candidate TFs and their and
their putative targets, especially in cases where there is no
direct information as to which binding site the candidate
TF may bind. In the case of all MYB or MYB-like TFs, we
used a set of experimentally validated TF binding sites
from the AGRIS database and literature curation ([10], see
Additional file 1 Table S11 for a list of CRE binding sites)
in order to capture the relationship between ARR7 and its
putative targets. While this may lead to a greater ambiguity in making predictions it allows for the greatest flexibility in determining putative targets using CRE detection
methods.

For the prediction of targets for WRKY11/17 TFs [30]
using correlation and CRE detection methods, we used
the W-box binding site [34] frequency in order to predict
WRKY targets. We found a high specificity for the putative
regulatory target predictions of WRKY11 and WRKY17
using Pearson and Spearman correlation methods as well
as CRE over-representation (Figure 2). We also found high
specificity for most combined correlation/CRE detection
measures (with the Spearman correlation having a slightly
lower Specificity in the WRKY17 mutant), and a correspondingly low sensitivity and negative predictive value
for both of these transcription factors for the Pearson,
Spearman, CRE over-representation, and combined prediction methods. We also observe, as in the case of the
MIF1 and ARR7 data, that the ≥ 1 CRE method for both
WRKY transcription factors has a high sensitivity and a
high PPV, giving it a high F Measure (See Additional file 1
Table S3, Figure 2). This is in contrast to its lower specificity which is comparable to the results of the analysis of
the ARR7 microarray dataset. We also see a higher F measure in the Spearman correlation when compared to other
correlation methods (Figure 2C).
A summary of the PPV (Figure 2A), sensitivity (Figure 2B),
F-measure (Figure 2C), specificity (Figure 2D) and NPV
(Figure 2E) for all of the datasets analyzed in this study is
shown in Figure 2. This figure reveals the consistent pattern of high positive predictive value across all of these
datasets for all methods (Figure 2A). This result indicates
that these methods tend to capture more true positives
than false positives. Figure 2 also highlights the higher
sensitivity for the Spearman correlation and ≥ 1 CRE
detection methods, separately and combined, when compared to all other methods and their correspondingly
higher F-measure (Figure 2C). Further, the plot of the specificity (Figure 2D) for these performance measures, indicates that all prediction methods have a consistent
performance pattern across the datasets except the ≥ 1 CRE
method. This is most likely due to the variability of direct
effects that the CRE may be having, thereby lowering the
ratio of false positives to true negatives. And finally, the
NPV (Figure 2E) shows a consistent pattern across all
datasets, except again in the case of the ≥ 1 CRE method due to the lower ratio of false negatives to true negatives.
Evaluation of Spearman Correlation +/- CRE Detection
Regulatory Prediction Methods over the Entire ATH1
Microarray Chip
One surprising result of the above analysis of regulated
genes was the outstanding performance of the ≥ 1 CRE
method. While one would expect this method to have a
high sensitivity, one would expect this method to have a
low specificity and low PPV due to the potential for false
positives. However, the ≥ 1 CRE method had a high PPV
(Figure 2A) across all datasets and it also had a high spe-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/435

cificity in the MIF1 dataset (Figure 2D). The excellent performance of the ≥ 1 CRE method may stem for our using
only regulated genes for this analysis; this may have created an artificially high specificity and PPV due to the fact
that many regulated genes are also misregulated in the
mutant/transgenic. Thus, if a gene has the CRE binding
site, it has a greater chance of being a TF→target, as it is
regulated under the same conditions as its putative regulator (TF). To test this hypothesis, we made regulatory predictions using the ≥ 1 CRE for the candidate TFs in each
dataset across all expressed genes represented on the
ATH1 microarray chip (e.g. not only the regulated genes)
(See analysis scheme in Figure 3).
We also wished to further test the Spearman correlation
on this new dataset (all expressed genes on the ATH1
chip) as we found Spearman correlation to be the most
balanced method (based on F measure) for capturing
putative targets among regulated genes we hypothesized
that it might have the most robust performance over the
entire genome. To test this, we performed Spearman correlation between the candidate TF from each dataset and
all the genes represented on the ATH1 microarray chip
and expressed in the microarray data. This was done in
conjunction with CRE detection methods performed over
the entire genome, in order to determine how well the
CRE detection methods performed on their own vs. combining the Spearman correlation and CRE detection methods. By combining these methods over the whole
genome, we may improve the performance of these methods in capturing putative target genes.
A summary for the results of this analysis of the correlation and CRE methods used on all expressed genes detected
with the ATH1 chip is given in Figure 4, as well as in Additional file 1 Tables S4-6. The histogram plots in Figure 4
show the PPV, sensitivity and F-measure, specificity and
NPV for all of the datasets analyzed in this study. Figure
4A shows that the PPV is consistent across datasets for the
Spearman correlation and the combined CRE/correlation
methods. However there is a high degree of variability in
the PPV measure for the CRE method (Figure 4A). Figure
4A also reveals a consistent pattern of PPV across all of
these datasets for the combination of Spearman correlation and CRE over-representation. Figure 4B shows the
sensitivity, which is low for all prediction methods except
≥ 1 CRE due to the high coverage across the genome for
these binding sties. Figure 4C shows the F measure, which
is much more variable in the ≥ 1 CRE method vs. the
Spearman or Spearman + ≥ 1 CRE and low for all other
measures. The high F measure seen in the WRKY11 and
WRKY17 predictions is most likely due to the high
number of genes found (9,445 and 9,308 respectively) to
be expressed across the genome in these microarray samples, giving a higher coverage of the ATH1 genome chip

than was found with other datasets. Figure 4D shows a
consistently high specificity for all prediction methods
except for the ≥ 1 CRE, which is consistently low. Finally,
and Figure 4E shows a consistent pattern of NPV across all
measures. In all, these results confirm that the ≥ 1 CRE
performance diminishes when this method is applied to
all expressed genes (Figure 4) (vs. regulated genes shown
in Figure 2), based on the variable PPV and F measure,
and the consistently low specificity in the expressed gene
analysis (Figure 4).
Evaluating the Algorithm for Computing Correlations
As indicated in our results, the Spearman correlation gives
the best balance in terms of having a high PPV and a
higher sensitivity than other correlation methods (Figure
2). The underlying theory for this is that as the Spearman

correlation is a rank based measure of pair-wise association and as such the Spearman correlation does not
require a linear relationship between the expression of a
TF and a candidate target gene. To demonstrate this idea,
we took the microarray data from each dataset for those
genes predicted to be targets of a specific TF (as described
above) and squared the expression values for these genes
in each individual dataset. This new dataset was then combined with the original expression values for the TF in
question and the correlation was performed again using
the Spearman and Pearson correlation. Because the squaring transformation corrupts existing linear relationships
between TF and target expression levels but has no effect
on ranks, we expect degradation in performance of the
Pearson method but no change in that of the Spearman
method.
Based on our results (see Additional file 1 Tables S7-S10),
we see that indeed the Spearman correlation is unaffected
while the Pearson correlation is markedly reduced in the
number of predicted targets (in some cases not having any
predicted targets). These results clearly demonstrate the
differences in the correlation methods and their behavior
fits well with the previously described assumptions made
in the correlation methods.
The superior performance of the Spearman correlation
method over Pearson correlation above is consistent with
previous evaluations of these methods [35,36]. Rank correlations are not easily influenced by skewness or the high
levels of variability that is often observed in Affymetrix
microarray data of the type that was used in this study. In
contrast, the Pearson correlation method is very sensitive
to noise in the data due to extreme values, improper normalization and skewness.

Discussion
In this study, we have used several correlation methods
(Pearson and Spearman correlation), as well as CRE detection methods (≥1 CRE and CRE Over-representation), in
order to predict targets of regulated genes in wild-type that
may be confirmed to be targets as genes that are misregulated using microarray data from a TF mutant/transgenic.
The purpose of using and combining these methods was
to attempt to make predictions for associations between
candidate TFs and their targets using microarray expression data and sequence data. While similar approaches
have been used before in several studies [13,14], to date
correlation and CRE detection methods have not been
compared previously to determine which is the most
effective (alone or in combination) in a practical application on microarray data from datasets of wild-type and TF
mutants for Arabidopsis genomic data. Further, no current tool allows for the flexibility of using ones own microarray data, as well as several different CRE and correlation

The results of this analysis show a more highly variable PPV (A) for both CRE detection methods and a consistent PPV for all methods involving the Spearman correlation. Also shown is a reduced and far more
variable F measure for the ≥ 1 CRE method indicating a loss of consistently strong performance in balance between the sensitivity and PPV. This loss of performance is also seen in the consistently low specificity (D). The NPV (E) shows a consistent pattern of response across all measures. One interesting observation is that the Spearman correlation combined with CRE over

based methods (as well as the overlap for predicted targets), in order to make predictions of putative TF →target
relationships. In order to make this assessment, we used
several datasets, taken from the literature for canonical
examples of microarray expression datasets involving TFs
regulated by several different types of external stimuli (e.g.
light, pathogen infection, hormone response and abiotic
stress response) that represent several TF families, including two plant-specific TF families. The mutagenesis of

these TFs within these microarray studies then allowed us
to evaluate how well our prediction methods captured
genes that would be affected by candidate TFs on a transcriptome level.
We assessed the performance of various methods of predicting TF targets over datasets by computing several statistical measures: specificity, sensitivity, PPV, NPV and F
measure (Figures 2 &4). We feel that the results of this

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:435

assessment provides a useful resource for researchers performing genomic research using microarray datasets who
wish to elucidate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms
controlled by transcription factors of interest. And while
we have applied this approach specifically to Arabidopsis,
these tools are applicable to genomic data from any species.
Analysis of Correlation Methods for TF Target Predictions
Yields Two Approaches for Determining Target Genes of
Interest
We found that for regulated gene lists (e.g. genes significantly regulated in response to a specific treatment), we
have shown that the Spearman correlation method gave
the most balanced predictions for TF targets (based on the
F measure) (Figure 2). By contrast, we found that the Pearson correlation method provided greater specificity than
the Spearman correlation in all of the datasets analyzed
(Figure 2). This result provides two perspectives as to the
most effective way to capture genes of interest, given an
experimental design. While some investigators' experiments are focused on capturing a large number of genes,
others are interested in capturing specific groups of genes
that may belong to a functional group or pathway of interest or may be unique in simply sharing a pattern of regulation. Thus, the Pearson correlation is better suited to
smaller lists of genes for empirical validation (by Quantitative PCR, for example), while Spearman correlation is
better suited to large scale analysis covering many genes.
These two correlation methods therefore provide an effective means for generating hypothesis for various experimental designs.
Analysis of CRE Detection Methods reveals the ≥ 1 CRE
Performance Varies Given the Gene List being analyzed
For CRE detection methods, presence of ≥ 1 CRE yielded
excellent performance results when applied to only those
genes that are regulated under the experimental conditions
of these datasets (Figure 2). Although this result initially
seemed counterintuitive to us, comparing the results
based on regulated genes to those based on expressed (but
not necessarily regulated) genes represented on the ATH1
microarray chip gave insight as to the cause of this high
performance of the CRE method. Indeed, we saw a
remarkable drop in both the specificity and PPV for ≥ 1
CRE method for regulatory predictions made by using all
expressed genes vs. those made by using only regulated
genes (Figure 2) (Figure 4) on the ATH1 microarray chip.
This is most likely due to an artificially high PPV that is
introduced when looking at only regulated genes (Figure
2).

As the microarray datasets used in this study involved TFs
whose expression is regulated in response to the treatment,
the treatment conditions were those in which these TFs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/435

were expected to be regulated, and therefore be good candidates for controlling the response of target genes that
were also responsive under these treatment conditions.
Thus, there is a high probability for genes that are regulated
to also be misregulated in a mutant/transgenic that is specifically responsive under the treatment conditions being
studied. This, coupled with the fact that the CRE binding
sites used in this study are found in very high frequency
across the genome, gave good odds of finding a "true target vs. generating a false positive. However, when taken
out of the context of looking at only regulated genes the ≥
1 CRE performs poorly (Figure 4), as expected, as many
false positives were generated due to the large number of
CRE matches that are found across the entire genome.
CRE Over-representation Yields Evidence of the
Effectiveness of Combining Correlation and CRE
Regulatory Prediction Methods
As shown for the results of the ≥ 1 CRE regulatory prediction method, the performance of the CRE over-representation regulatory prediction method was also very
dependent on the gene list used. For this method we also
observed a loss of specificity and PPV when it was applied
to the entire list of ATH1 microarray chip genes vs. only
those genes regulated under the experimental conditions
of each dataset (Figure 4). This is likely due in part to the
fact that extending this and other methods to all expressed
genes increases the number of possible matches. This in
turn alters the significance of the p-values generated
because the FDR cut-off used in this study is subject to the
distribution of p-values.

However, we see a notable improvement in the PPV when
the CRE over-representation method is combined with
the Spearman correlation and applied to all expressed
genes (Figure 4). Indeed, combining the Spearman correlation with CRE over-representation sometimes gave a
substantially higher performance than what was seen with
either of these methods alone.
Limitations of Using CRE Detection Methods
We mention several caveats in using this methodology to
make regulatory predictions in Arabidopsis. One involves
the CRE detection methods used. A major limitation of
the CRE approaches described in this work is that they rely
heavily on the existence of a known CRE binding site for
a individual candidate TF or for a well characterized family or subfamily of TFs. This type of data is extremely limited in Arabidopsis. More work needs to be done in order
to verify TF→target interactions and in both annotating
and discovering CRE and TF function. Another limitation
is that not all transcriptional control of gene regulation is
based solely on the function of transcription factors.
Indeed, while it is true that a substantial amount of transcriptional regulation can be accounted for by transcrip-

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:435

tion factors [37], several additional mechanisms exist that
could account for this control of gene expression on a
transcriptome level including microRNAs [38] and chromatin modification [39]. Nevertheless, based on these
results it seems that presence of ≥ 1 CRE and CRE overrepresentation are useful tools in making regulatory predictions for targets of TFs when the data on the TF and the
CRE binding site are available and when the TF and target
mRNAs are regulated in response to treatment.
Limitations of Regulatory Prediction Methods
Our overall schema to predict regulatory interactions
between transcription factors and putative targets in the
Arabidopsis genome (Figure 1) has several limitations due
to the complex nature of gene regulatory interactions. Not
only are transcription factors able to regulate themselves,
but there are temporal relationships between the expression of transcription factors and their targets, a phenomenon which has been addressed by other tools [15]. Further
complicating this is the existence of feedback [40], feedforward [41] and other complex network motifs within
the Arabidopsis regulome that may be affecting the interaction between transcription factor regulators and their targets.

Thus we acknowledge that our approach, which seeks to
make direct relationships between TFs and targets, may be
missing some of the complexity of the regulatory interactions that exist within the Arabidopsis genome. Our
implicit assumption is that differential expression of a
gene between WT and a TF mutant/transgenic is a result of
a direct regulatory interaction between the TF and the target. However the interaction may be indirect or even compensation from a parallel regulatory pathway.
Furthermore, our correlation analysis can only capture
those TF-target interactions that are tightly co-regulated.
Similarly, by using only the CRE methods, we are limited
to only those TFs that directly bind their targets and do
not act through intermediate transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms. We feel however that our approach still has
a great deal of utility, as it allows for a method for hypothesis generation and testing when evaluating potential TF
candidates from mutant/transgenic TF studies, as has been
shown in one of our recent publications [1].
Comparison to Other Regulatory Prediction Methods
Several methods currently use correlation and CRE search
methods in order to predict regulatory interactions
between TFs and putative targets. Examples are CERMT
(Covariance-based Extraction of Regulatory targets using
Multiple Time series) [15], which predict targets for a particular transcription factor of interest. Targets are defined
as genes that respond similarly to a transcription factor,
with or without a time shift. ATTED II [14] uses a fixed
database of 58 experiments (1,338 slides) and identifies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/435

CREs located 200bp upstream of a gene and a transcription factor that are correlated across the expression data
set. While these methods are effective, they are limited by
their use of either a fixed database or of a specific data
type.
In the case of CERMT [15], the authors state that the program is only effective on time course microarray data.
ATTED II [14] relies on a fixed microarray database for
correlation and requires that one use a fixed upstream
region for CRE discovery. Our approach differs in that it
can be used with any properly formatted genomic data.
Correlation is computed on any microarray data that is
formatted into a data matrix, which is then used to identify putative TF-target interaction based on correlation
alone. The presence or over-representation of known
CREs found in the promoter region of a putative target is
computed and used to create putative TF-target interactions based on CRE alone. The results of the two methods
are compared to determine the overlap between CRE and
correlation TF-target predictions. Our methods and
approach have been implemented in the VirtualPlant software platform which is currently available online at http:/
/www.virtualplant.org.
Validation of Approach of TF→target predictions in the
35S:CCA1 Over-expressor Study
The approach of using a combination of correlation and
CRE detection methods was recently found to be successful in our predictions and validations [1] involving the
identification of a nitrogen response network controlled
by the CCA1 transcription factor. The purpose of that
study was to use a genomic approach to identify gene networks whose expression is regulated by nitrogen and/or
glutamate-derived metabolites in plants. Specifically, the
investigators were interested in the regulation of the nitrogen assimilation pathway in response to nitrogen signaling.

This is a critical pathway that is necessary for nitrogen
uptake and storage whose components have been shown
to be a strong indicator of transcriptional response to
nitrogen in plants [7,42]
The results of that analysis resulted in 834 genes that were
shown to differentially respond to various inorganic
(ammonium nitrate) and organic (glutamate or
glutamine) nitrogen treatments.
In order to determine what genes may be regulating this
response to nitrogen, a combination of Pearson correlation and over-representation of CREs was used. This was
done in order to narrow down the list of targets to specific
pathways involved in nitrogen assimilation. Based on
these prediction methods, several targets were predicted

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:435

to be regulated by CCA1 including ASN1, GDH1 and
GLN1.3, all of which are present within the nitrogen
assimilation pathway.
Using an over-expressor line for CCA1 (35S::CCA1), the
investigators in Gutierrez et al (2008) [1] were able to
show that the predicted TF→target genes were indeed regulated by CCA1 based on quantitative PCR results showing the misregulation of these genes in the 35S::CCA1
over-expressor. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods (correlation and CRE representation) in predicting TF→target relationships using largescale transcriptional changes.

Conclusions
The study presented here illustrates the effectiveness of
using correlation and CRE detection methods alone or in
combination with correlation methods, in order to predict targets of candidate TFs. We have been able to show
both the effectiveness of these methods overall in capturing regulated predicted targets that are also misregulated
in TF mutants/transgenics. We also compared different
correlation and CRE detection methods to determine
which are the most effective by various measures of performance over various microarray datasets. These tools
provide a valuable resource in effectively predicting transcription factors controlling transcriptional responses on
a genomic level.

Methods
Microarray Dataset Processing
Published ATH1 Affymetrix microarray datasets were
taken from the NASCarrays NASC microarray database
(Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center [43] and ArrayExpress [44] databases or requested directly from the author
(MIF1 data set [21]). Only microarray data with at least 2
biological replicate experiments were used in this study
(see Table 1 for the number of replicates in each dataset).
Genes with Absent/Marginal calls had their signal values
replaced by a non numerical NA placeholder which is
ignored by the algorithms used in this study. All microarray data was processed and normalized using the R MAS5
method with global signal intensities scaled to an average
signal intensity of 100 and all other values for this function set to their defaults.
ANOVA of Microarray Data to Determine Regulation/
Misregulation
One way ANOVA was performed on the treated vs. control
experiments in WT in order to determine differentially
regulated genes. All time courses were treated as separate
experiments and were compared to their relative controls.
Genes that changed at any time point were considered to
be differentially expressed. To determine misregulation in
mutant/transgenics compared to wildtype experiments,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/435

Factorial ANOVA was performed in R using the following
model Y = μ + αTreatment + βGenotype + γGenotype:
Treatment, where Y is the normalized MAS5 expression
signal of a gene; μ is the global mean; and αcoefficients
correspond to the effects of the different factor levels
Treatment and Genotype. All genes differentially regulated using this formula are considered to be misregulated.
Computation of Spearman Rank Correlation
Spearman correlation predictions were computed using
the MATPACK function available in C++ library http://
www.matpack.de/. This function computes and tests the
pair-wise associations between items using a correlation
coefficient. P-values for the correlation are derived from
the correlation coefficient generated for each pair-wise
correlation. A 5% FDR cutoff was used to determine those
p-values that were significant.
Computation of Pearson Correlation
Pearson correlation predictions were computed using a
C++ based program using the methodology described in
Opgen-Rhein et al., 2006 [45]. C++ was used as correlation analysis is computationally intensive, especially for
large numbers of genes. Boost http://www.boost.org, a
widely used set of C++ templates, was used to construct
matrices from expression data. For each TF-putative target
gene predicted by the Pearson correlation, the p-value for
their interaction was determined by the probability of
observing a correlation as large or larger under the null
hypothesis of no true correlation. This p-value was estimated by independently randomizing the experiment
labels on the expression values of each gene and computing the correlation matrix for each randomization. A 5%
FDR cutoff was used to determine those p-values that were
significant.
CRE Search (≥ 1 CRE)
CRE matches to known CREs were generated using the
DNA pattern search tool available from RSA tools [19]
with a maximum of 3,000 bp of the upstream promoter
sequence of candidate genes being searched in the forward and reverse direction for matches to known CREs.
Only genes present on the Arabidopsis ATH1 gene chip
were used in order to facilitate comparison and overlap
with correlation results. Known CREs for a TF of interest
were obtained from the AGRIS database [10] or from
manual literature curation. Promoter sequences for target
genes were downloaded from parsed promoter sequence
for the Arabidopsis genome available from the AGRIS database [10].
CRE Over-representation
Over-representation of cis regulatory elements (CREs) was
determined by using an empirical p-value to compute the

Page 13 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:435

probability for a CRE corresponding to a transcription factor of interest. This p-value was computed by taking the
number of genes in the genome with a frequency greater
than or equal to the observed frequency for a given gene
divided by the total number of genes in the genome. Only
genes present on the Arabidopsis ATH1 gene chip were
used in order to facilitate comparison and overlap with
correlation results.
Computing the False Discovery Rate (FDR)
The FDR or the expected fraction of false positives among
all genes reported as significant was used to determine a
significance cutoff for all p-values used in this study. The
FDR was computed in R using the Storey and Tibshirani
(2003) [46] method. This method determines a cut-off
based on the expected proportion of false positives
incurred when calling that feature significant.
