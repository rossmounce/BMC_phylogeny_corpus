Abstract
Background: Explicit evolutionary models are required in maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference, the two
methods that are overwhelmingly used in phylogenetic studies of DNA sequence data. Appropriate selection of
nucleotide substitution models is important because the use of incorrect models can mislead phylogenetic
inference. To better understand the performance of different model-selection criteria, we used 33,600 simulated
data sets to analyse the accuracy, precision, dissimilarity, and biases of the hierarchical likelihood-ratio test, Akaike
information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and decision theory.
Results: We demonstrate that the Bayesian information criterion and decision theory are the most appropriate
model-selection criteria because of their high accuracy and precision. Our results also indicate that in some
situations different models are selected by different criteria for the same dataset. Such dissimilarity was the highest
between the hierarchical likelihood-ratio test and Akaike information criterion, and lowest between the Bayesian
information criterion and decision theory. The hierarchical likelihood-ratio test performed poorly when the true
model included a proportion of invariable sites, while the Bayesian information criterion and decision theory
generally exhibited similar performance to each other.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the Bayesian information criterion and decision theory should be preferred
for model selection. Together with model-adequacy tests, accurate model selection will serve to improve the
reliability of phylogenetic inference and related analyses.

Background
Among the rigorous methods of tree reconstruction that
are available, maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
inference (BI) have dominated phylogenetic studies in
recent years [1-6]. Both methods are based on the likelihood function, which needs explicit models of evolution
to capture the underlying evolutionary processes in
sequence data [1-6]. For DNA sequences, the models
are the evolutionary characterisation of one nucleotide
being replaced by another one. Although the models are
simplifications of the “true” evolutionary processes and
are clearly wrong [3,7,8], they are approximations that
have been widely accepted. The assumed model of

nucleotide substitution can exert a significant influence
on phylogenetic estimation. This is an increasingly
important concern in the modern genomic era, with the
growing use of multiple loci that have probably been
subject to different substitution processes [6].
A variety of nucleotide substitution models have been
devised, most of which are special cases of the general
time-reversible (GTR) model in which each of the six
pairwise nucleotide changes can have a distinct rate, and
the frequencies of the four nucleotides are allowed to
take different values [9]. Common extensions to this
model include parameters for a proportion of invariable
sites (I) and for gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity
among sites (Γ). In the last few years, many improvements have been explored, including models that
account for differences among the three codon positions
[10,11], pattern heterogeneity of the substitution process

(e.g., [12]), among-site heterogeneity of rates (e.g., [13]),
compositional heterogeneity among lineages (e.g., [14]),
and site-specific rate variation through time (e.g.,
[15,16]).
Statistical methods are often used to identify the substitution model that best describes the given DNA
sequence data. Model selection using software such as
ModelTest [17], DT-ModSel [3], and jModelTest [18,19]
has now become standard procedure in phylogenetic
analysis [4,20]. Alternatively, model determination can
be conducted using a reversible-jump Markov chain
Monte Carlo approach in a Bayesian setting [9]. This
differs from past practice when model choice was conducted without statistical justification or by choosing
the most parameter-rich model available [6,8]. Model
selection is considered important because the use of
alternative models can change the results of phylogenetic analysis. It has effects not only on the estimation
of model parameters (e.g., genetic distances and branch
lengths; [2,21]), but also on estimates of bootstrap support and posterior probabilities [2]. Furthermore, misspecified models can lead to errors in phylogenetic
inference, especially for trees with short internal
branches [6,21-23].
One of the challenges facing researchers is how to
select the most appropriate substitution model for a
given dataset. There is now a range of procedures from
which to choose, including the hierarchical likelihoodratio test (hLRT) [24-26], Akaike information criterion
(AIC) [27,28], Bayes factor [29-31], Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) [32], posterior probability [29,33,34],
decision theory (DT) [3], and the emerging approach of
cross-validation [35,36]. All of these can be used to
select the best-fit model from a set of candidates, but
differ in specific algorithms which may ultimately give
rise to differences in their performance (for further
details, see Methods).
Of the four widely-used model-selection criteria in
phylogenetics - the hLRT, AIC, BIC, and DT - the
hLRT was once argued to be reasonably accurate and to
perform better in general than the AIC and BIC, a conclusion drawn from analyses of simulated data comparing six models [8]. However, the hLRT has been
demonstrated to have several disadvantages, such as a
dependence on the starting point and the path through
the hierarchy of models [37,38], which undermine and
limit its performance in model selection. It has been
established that both the BIC and DT tend to select
simpler models than the AIC [3,4,8,39], while the hLRT
particularly favours complex ones [3,40]. Applying them
to empirical data, Pol [38] found that different best-fit
models were selected by the hLRT and AIC for 16 out
of 18 datasets. Ripplinger and Sullivan [4] found that
the hLRT, AIC, BIC, and DT criteria often selected

different models for the same real datasets, which was
similar to the results of Abdo et al. [39] based on simulated data using parameters estimated from a rodent
mtDNA dataset; in contrast, several empirical studies
found that the BIC and DT often selected the same
model [4,39]. However, there is a need for a comprehensive systematic study of the performance of model-selection criteria.
Here we present a study of the performance of the
four model-selection criteria hLRT, AIC, BIC, and DT.
Considering the biases in model selection revealed by
previous studies (as described above) and the convenience of simulated data for theoretical investigation [41],
we conducted a total of 14 simulations of 33,600 datasets. Our investigation was limited to the 24 fundamental substitution models from the GTR family, assuming
a stationary, time-reversible, and homogeneous Markov
process. Based on the best-fit models selected by these
criteria for these simulated datasets, we examined for
each criterion the success rate of recovering simulated
models (its accuracy) and the number of different models selected across replicate datasets (its precision); the
dissimilarity and model biases of these criteria (see
Methods for details) were also examined and compared
statistically. In addition, we examined dissimilarity in
analyses of datasets that were simulated under a slightly
more complex model based on a simple homogeneous
codon-substitution process. On the whole, our study
aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of model-selection criteria.

Results
Accuracy

In the 14 simulations (Table 1; see Methods), the mean
accuracy scores for the BIC and DT were higher than
those for the hLRT and AIC. The ANOVA-LSD tests
demonstrated that there were no significant differences
for the pairs of hLRT-AIC and BIC-DT respectively;
however, very significant differences existed for the
other pairs such as hLRT-BIC (P < 0.01). The full
results of the accuracy analysis are provided in Additional file 1.
The hLRT exhibited high accuracy in recovering some
models, but unexpectedly, it was always incapable of
recovering the four SYM-like models (i.e., SYM, SYM +
I, SYM + Γ and SYM + I + Γ; Table 1) (Figure 1). The
AIC showed moderate or low accuracy except for a few
complex models (e.g., GTR + I + Γ) for which the accuracy was even as high as 1.00 in certain simulations.
The accuracy of the BIC and DT differed among simulations. In most cases, they showed high accuracy in recovering almost all of the 24 models (Figure 1A).
Compared with the other models, however, two (SYM +
I + Γ and GTR + I + Γ) were only moderately recovered

One hundred replicates were performed for each set of conditions. The models consisted of JC (0) [61], K80 (1) [62], SYM (5) [63], F81 (3) [64], HKY (4) [65,66],
GTR (8) [67], JC + I (1), K80 + I (2), SYM + I (6), F81 + I (4), HKY + I (4), GTR + I (9), JC + Γ (1), K80 + Γ (2), SYM + Γ (6), F81 + Γ (4), HKY + Γ (4), GTR + Γ (9), JC +
I + Γ (2), K80 + I + Γ (3), SYM + I + Γ (7), F81 + I + Γ (5), HKY + I + Γ (5) and GTR + I + Γ (10), where ‘I’ represents the proportion of invariable sites, ‘Γ’
represents the discrete gamma distribution with four rate categories, and number in parentheses is the number of free parameters of each model. One
classification of the 24 models was to put them into four categories: base (JC, K80, etc.), base + I (JC + I, K80 + I, etc.), base + Γ (JC + Γ, K80 + Γ, etc.) and base +
I + Γ (JC + I + Γ, K80 + I + Γ, etc.). The other was that models with the same number of free parameters were grouped together, resulting in a total of 11
categories. In addition, we called every four models having the same parameters in the substitution-rate matrix as base-like models (e.g., the four models of SYM,
SYM + I, SYM + Γ, SYM + I + Γ were called as SYM-like models).

Figure 2 Trees used to guide dataset simulations. Tree heights are 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1 substitutions per site for A, B, C, and D, respectively
(30 taxa each); tree heights are 0.5 substitutions per site for both E (22 taxa) and F (50 taxa). All trees are ultrametric except for tree G, which is
the non-clock tree (22 taxa) and was only used in simulation IV-1.

in simulations derived from parameter set-B; even all of
the SYM-like and GTR-like models were recovered less
frequently in simulation I-8 (tree topology with a height
of 0.1; Figure 2D) (Figure 1B). The BIC and DT exhibited similar accuracy in simulation I-4 (ultrametric tree
topology of 30 taxa, 0.1 tree height; Figure 2D) and
simulation IV-1 (non-clock tree topology of 22 taxa; Figure 2G), both recovering less than 35% of models of
base + I + Γ category (i.e., JC + I + Γ, K80 + I + Γ, etc.;
Table 1) (Figure 1C). In fact, they always selected models of base + Γ category (i.e., JC + Γ, K80 + Γ, etc.).
Their accuracy values were high when the value of the
parameter for proportion of invariable sites (pinv) was
altered from 0.25 in parameter set-A to 0.5 in parameter
set-B when simulating datasets (data not shown). Notably, the hLRT and AIC in these two simulations, especially the former criterion, also showed lower accuracy
in recovering models of base + I + Γ category than in
the other simulations.
Precision

There were very significant differences among the precisions of the four criteria in the 14 simulations (randomized block ANOVA; P < 0.01). The precision of the
hLRT was very significantly different from that of BIC
and DT in certain simulations (P < 0.01), but not in
others, while the precision of AIC was very significantly
different from that of the other three criteria (LSD, P <
0.01) in all 14 simulations. The precision of BIC was

always similar to that of DT, with P-values ranging from
0.508 to 1.000 (LSD). The full results of the analyses of
precision are provided in Additional file 2.
Although small discrepancies existed, precision values
of the AIC were generally higher than those of the other
three in the 14 simulations (Figure 3). Their means ranged from 7.79 to 9.75, while standard deviations were
also much larger and ranged from 4.169 to 5.160 (Additional file 2). This was mainly attributed to the fact that
the AIC usually selected a dozen different best-fit models for each set of 100 replicates simulated under the
same conditions, but at the same time, it selected only a
few for datasets simulated under SYM-like and GTRlike models. Compared with the AIC, the other three
criteria selected fewer different best-fit models, and their
precision values were relatively stable among datasets
generated under the same simulation conditions. However, precision values of the hLRT (means ranging from
3.29 to 4.83; Additional file 2) were generally higher
than those of the BIC and DT, and in some cases were
very significantly different. Therefore, the BIC and DT
exhibited the best precision among the four criteria lower mean and smaller standard deviation - while that
of the BIC was little better than that of DT (Additional
file 2).

with means ranging from 46.13% to 54.75%, followed by
one same model from 33.83% to 47.67%, and three
models from 5.17% to 12.88%. Four different models
were favoured less than 0.25% by these four criteria in
the 14 simulations, and even zero in I-4, IV-1, and V-2.
Figure 4 illustrates the dissimilarity values of the six
criterion pairs, and Additional file 3 shows the results of
the ANOVA-LSD tests. In the 14 simulations, there
existed very significantly different variances for different
criterion pairs (P < 0.01), and also very significantly different variances for datasets simulated using the 24 different models. Dissimilarity values of the BIC-DT pair,
with means ranging from 0.17% to 7.67%, were very significantly different from those of the other criterion
pairs (P < 0.01). Although the dissimilarity of hLRT-AIC
was less than that of certain pairs (e.g., hLRT-BIC) in
datasets simulated for some models (e.g., SYM-like
models; Figure 4), the means were the largest in the 14
simulations (ranging from 48.21% to 63.29%). Its values
were very significantly different from those of the other
pairs in seven simulations. Across the other simulations,
their differences from some of the other criterion pairs
were not very significant in spite of low probabilities.
With simulation I-4 similar to IV-1, dissimilarity values
in simulations derived from parameter set-B were

similar to each other (Figure 4B); the other simulations
derived from set-A generally resembled each other
(Figure 4A).
In the additional simulation VI, which was performed
using complex codon models, means of percentages that
one same model, two models, three models, and four
models were selected were 8.25%, 53.83%, 36.29%, and
1.63%, respectively. Among the criterion pairs, means of
dissimilarity values ranged from 3.33% for BIC-DT to
84.88% for hLRT-AIC, and dissimilarity of BIC-DT was
significantly different from that of the other criterion
pairs (P < 0.01).
Model biases

While considering the four model categories (base, base
+ I, base + Γ and base + I + Γ; Table 1), the results of
the chi-square (c2) homogeneity tests [42] demonstrated
that there were significant differences in model biases
among the four criteria (a = 0.05) (Table 3). The hLRT
was always significantly different from the other three
(a′ = 0.0083 by Bonferroni correction), with a relatively

small portion of base + I category recovered in the 14
simulations (Figure 5). In contrast, the BIC was always
similar to DT with high probabilities except in simulation I-1, where DT recovered fewer models of base category. For comparisons between the AIC and BIC, and
between the AIC and DT, differences were generally not
significant in simulations other than I-4, IV-1, and I-1.
In fact, there was an even or an approximately even distribution of model categories recovered by the AIC,
BIC, and DT in these simulations; but for I-4 and IV-1,
models of base + I + Γ category were recovered much
less by the BIC and DT than the other model categories
(Figure 5).
Figure 6 shows the distribution of 11 model categories
recovered in the 14 simulations based on the number of
free parameters (Table 1). In all of them, with significant
differences among the four criteria on the whole, each
criterion was significantly different from any other
except the pair of BIC and DT (see Additional file 4).
However, there were also significant differences between
the BIC and DT in simulation I-1.

Discussion
Which is the best criterion for model selection?

Although there exist cases indicating that obvious violation of model assumptions could favour the true tree
[43,44] under specific conditions (e.g., oversimplified
model for trees within the “Farris zone”; [45]), it has
been clearly demonstrated that identifying the best-fit
model is beneficial to phylogenetic inference and to
understanding the molecular-evolutionary process. It
must be acknowledged, however, that an absolute characterisation of the true evolutionary history of real data

is usually impossible. So one concern for researchers,
who do not have knowledge of this evolutionary history,
is the accuracy of model-selection criteria to ensure that
the best model can be selected from the available
candidates.
In this study, based on 14 simulations of 33,600 datasets performed using known models, we simply evaluated the accuracy and precision of four model-selection
criteria. Higher accuracy was broadly coincident with
better precision and vice versa, which the performance
of AIC best explained. Nevertheless, there were

exceptions to this general pattern. Since the hLRT always
selected GTR-like and TrN-like models for datasets simulated using SYM-like models, its precision values were low
and its accuracy was almost zero. Generally, the high accuracy and low precision of the BIC and DT indicate that
they perform better than the other two criteria. This result
is robust to the influences of different simulation programs (Seq-Gen [46] and Mesquite [47]), tree topologies
comprising different numbers of taxa (22, 30, and 50), and
sequence lengths (300 bp, 1,000 bp, and 2,000 bp) (Table
1). However, accuracy values in certain simulations may
confuse the situation to some extent, due to different
simulation conditions as described below.
1. Parameters

Between simulations derived from Parameter set-A and
those derived from set-B, discrepancies in performance
existed for both the BIC and DT (e.g., accuracy values for
models of base + I + Γ category between I-4 and I-8) (Figure 1). Considering that altering pinv from 0.25 in simulation I-4 and IV-1 to 0.5 can improve the recovery of
models of base + I + Γ category by the BIC and DT, pinv
should be an important parameter influencing accuracy.
2. Tree topology

The accuracy of the BIC and DT in simulations with a
tree height of 0.1 did not support the general conclusions
very well, being different from the simulations using tree

heights of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 (Figure 1). At the same time,
this happened in the simulation with the non-clock tree
topology with both short and long branches. Given the
lower accuracy of the other two criteria in these two
simulations, we suspect that model selection might not
be very effective for data of limited information content.
Do they select different best-fit models?

Our study revealed that the means of dissimilarity values
of the hLRT-AIC pair ranged from 48.21% to 63.29%,
and were the largest across the 14 simulations even
though they were not necessarily statistically larger than
those of the other pairs. In contrast, the BIC and DT
tended to select the same model, with significantly
lower means of dissimilarity values ranging from 0.17%
to 7.67% across the 14 simulations. Model selection for
datasets simulated under complex codon models also
yielded the largest dissimilarity for hLRT-AIC and the
smallest for BIC-DT. Thus, we can envisage that
researchers using the hLRT and AIC would frequently
face a problematic situation in which these criteria
would select different models. At the same time, as an
extension of the BIC incorporating branch-length error
[3], DT brings doubt as to whether estimating branchlength error, a measure of phylogenetic performance,
would influence model selection.

Luo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:242
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/242

On the whole, if one uses these four criteria to select
models for given sequence data, variance in best-fit models could be encountered with the greatest possibility of
two different models, followed by moderate possibilities
of one same model, and three models; there is little or no
chance of encountering four different best-fit models.
These results are generally consistent with those of Ripplinger and Sullivan [4], whose results were based on 250
real sequence datasets for the criteria of hLRT, AIC, BIC,
and DT. However, the results of our additional simulation VI supported a different order: two models, three
models, one same model, and four models. In all respects,
results of both empirical studies [4] and simulation studies (this study) suggest that model selection with these
criteria will often produce inconsistent models, which
could present a confusing situation for researchers.

finding owing to specific simulation settings such as
values of the proportion of invariable sites. However, in
view of the improvements on GTR models explored in
recent years (see Background), it is possible that the
results from most of our simulated data represent a
poor reflection of real sequence data, which have almost
certainly evolved under more complex conditions.
Accordingly, we suggest here that model selection by
the BIC or DT, together with model adequacy tests by
parametric bootstrap [48,49] or posterior predictive distributions [1], might be the best approach. Further studies can be done with simulated datasets under more
complex evolutionary models to understand the performance of these criteria and to enhance phylogenetic
studies.

Methods
Are there model biases?

Dataset simulation

When considering the four model categories, one unexpected discovery was the relatively small portion of base
+ I category recovered in the 14 simulations, including
those simulated with the pinv of 0.5 in parameter set-B.
This result indicates that model selection with the hLRT
is not sensitive to the proportion of invariable sites
under the condition that there is no other among-site
rate heterogeneity. In comparison, there was an approximately even distribution of the four model categories by
the AIC, BIC, and DT in most simulations (Figure 5),
which is consistent with the ideal even distribution
given that the number of datasets simulated under models of any one category (i.e., 100 × 6 = 600) is the same
as that of any other category. In a sense, we could relate
the typical insensitivity of the hLRT to the proportion of
variable sites with its special hierarchy of pairwise comparisons, because this parameter is the last-optimised
parameter in the default hierarchy of ModelTest v.3.7
[17]. As it has been demonstrated that the hierarchy has
an influence on the performance of hLRT [8,38], future
work could investigate whether different hierarchies
might lead to a different success rate in recovering models of base + I category.
Nevertheless, with our two standards of classifying the
24 GTR-family models, the results all confirmed that
the BIC exhibited similar model biases to DT, with only
a few exceptions. This was consistent with the results of
accuracy, precision, and dissimilarity, which to some
extent demonstrated that results based on our simulated
datasets were reasonable and consistent.

We used two different parameter sets to simulate datasets. For parameter set-A [2], which was mainly derived
from a mitochondrial DNA analysis except for the transition/transversion ratio and the proportion of invariable
sites [50], the settings were as follows (as appropriate
for each model): base frequencies 0.35 A, 0.22 C, 0.18
G, 0.25 T; rates (relative to GT) 2.675 AC, 7.35 AG,
6.125 AT, 0.225 CG, 30.7 CT; transition/transversion ()
2.0; gamma shape parameter (a) 0.67256; and proportion of invariable sites (pinv) 0.25. Parameter set-B was
chosen according to the settings of Posada and Crandall
[8] (as appropriate for each model): base frequencies
0.35 A, 0.15 C, 0.25 G, 0.25 T; rates (relative to GT) 2
AC, 4 AG, 1.8 AT, 1.4 CG, 6 CT; transition/transversion
() 2.0; and gamma shape parameter (a) 0.5. We set the
pinv as 0.5 in parameter set-B. Gamma-distributed rates
in both parameter sets were modelled with four discrete
categories in the simulations.
Initial simulations were conducted to explore the general performance of the model-selection criteria. First,
we generated four ultrametric tree topologies of 30 taxa
using the program PAML 4.1 [51] assuming a birthdeath process (speciation rate 0.1, extinction rate 0.1,
sampling fraction 1.0). Tree heights (i.e., expected number of substitutions per site from the root to each tip)
were 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1 for the four trees (Figure 2A,
Figure 2B, Figure 2C, and Figure 2D, respectively).
Then, for each combination of parameter set and tree
topology, we used Seq-Gen 1.3.2 [46] to simulate 100
replicate datasets for 24 fundamental models of varying
complexity from the GTR family (Table 1, simulation I).
A sequence length of 1,000 bp was used because it was
representative of empirical sequence lengths typically
used in phylogenetic studies [2], and was sufficient to
evaluate the performance of most model-selection criteria [8].

Conclusions
Overall, our performance analysis based on simulated
datasets indicates that the BIC together with DT should
be preferred for model selection in phylogenetics,
although some of our results departed from this general

Luo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:242
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/242

Other simulations were conducted to investigate the
influence of certain simulation conditions on the performance of the model-selection criteria (Table 1). With
other parameters fixed, the purpose of simulation II was
to test the effect of varying the number of taxa. Simulation III employed the program Mesquite 2.6 [47] to
simulate datasets to investigate the impact of different
simulation programs. Simulation IV adopted one nonclock tree of 22 taxa (Figure 2G): following the method
of Lemmon and Moriarty [2], the internal branches
were randomly labelled from 0 to 18, and each branch
was then assigned a branch length of 102x/18-3, where x
was the number assigned to that branch; similarly, the
lengths of the external branches (randomly numbered
from 0 to 21) were given by 102x/21-3. In simulation V,
sequence lengths were 300 bp and 2,000 bp, respectively, with the other simulation conditions consistent
with simulation I-2.
Model selection

The most widely-used program for model selection,
ModelTest v.3.7 [17], along with DT-ModSel [3], were
employed to select the best-fit model. Default settings
were used in each program; some default settings may
influence the performance of certain criteria, such as the
hierarchy of pairwise comparison of models for the
hLRT [8,38], but some may not, including the use of
neighbour-joining (NJ) to generate a starting tree [8,39].
The 56 nested candidate models (i.e., a simpler model is
one special case of a more general model), corresponding to the ‘7 schemes’ in jModelTest [18,19], included
the 24 models used in our simulations. After likelihood
scores (L) under the 56 candidate models were computed by PAUP* v.4.0b10 [52] based on NJ trees, the
hLRT together with the AIC and BIC was applied to
model selection using ModelTest v.3.7 [17]; DT-ModSel
was used for DT [3].
For the hLRT, the pairwise likelihood ratio test is
given by

 = 2(ln L1 − ln L 0 )
where L 0 is the likelihood score under the null
hypothesis (simple model) and L1 is the likelihood score
under the alternative hypothesis (complex model).
Although this is widely accepted for testing the fit of
nested candidate models in a specific sequence, there
are many possible ways to traverse the hierarchy of pairwise model comparisons [8,38,53]. We used the default
hierarchy in ModelTest v.3.7 [17]. The LRT statistic
approximately followed a standard c2 distribution. However, when the null fixed parameters were at the boundary of the parameter space of the alternative model (i.e.,
for tests of rate homogeneity among sites and invariable

Page 10 of 13

2
sites), the mixed c2 distribution (consisting of 50%  0
2 ) was used to construct the tests [54-56].
and 50%  1
We used 0.01 as the significance level for rejecting or
failing to reject the null model.
The AIC is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of
the Kullback-Leibler distance between the “true” model
and the fitted model [27,57]. In contrast with the hLRT,
the AIC can simultaneously compare all candidate models irrespective of their nesting status, and is defined as

AIC = −2 ln L + 2K or
AIC c = −2 ln L + 2Kn / (n − K − 1).

We computed the AIC instead of the AICc for given
models, in that the sample size n (i.e., the sequence
length) for most of our simulated datasets was large
enough compared with the number of parameters (K)
[40,58]. The candidate model with the lowest AIC value
was selected as the best-fit model.
Among the Bayesian methods of model selection, the
BIC [32] is not limited to nested models, and allows the
simultaneous comparison of multiple models [53]. It is
computed as
BIC = −2 ln L + K ln n,

where n is the sample size (i.e., the sequence length)
and K is the number of parameters. Given equal prior
probabilities of candidate models, the model yielding the
smallest BIC was the one with the highest posterior
probability and was selected as the best-fit one.
DT, a novel performance-based method of model
selection, is an extension of the BIC and specifically
incorporates branch-length error as a measure of phylogenetic performance in the course of model selection
[3]. In DT-ModSel, DT estimated all candidate models
through a penalty function, which was related to the difference in branch-length estimates across models. The
model with the minimal posterior penalty was selected
as the best-fit model.
Performance analysis
Accuracy

For each set of 100 replicates, estimated best-fit models
derived from each simulation were compared with the
known model under which replicate datasets were simulated. We recorded the number of times that they
matched (Numbermatched), and the accuracy of each criterion was then estimated by the rate of recovery of the
simulated models, i.e.,
Accuracy = Numbermatched / Numbertest × 100%,

where Numbertest was 100. The ANOVA for two-way
randomised block design and LSD test were used to

Luo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:242
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/242

compare the accuracy of these four model-selection
criteria.
Precision

We counted how many different best-fit models were
selected by each criterion within each set of 100 replicates. We did not take account of how many times any
particular model was selected among the 100 replicates,
but simply interpreted the number of different models
selected as an estimate of the precision of each modelselection criterion (i.e., we gave the same weight to each
model selected). Therefore, the precision of these criteria for simulated models was approximately evaluated
and was compared by the ANOVA for two-way randomized block design and LSD test.
Dissimilarity

To test whether the four criteria could select the
same best-fit models for each replicate dataset or not,
we counted the number of different models selected
by the four criteria for each replicate dataset. We
computed the percentages of one same model, two
models, three models, and four models being chosen
by the four model-selection criteria for each set of
100 replicates. In addition, we analysed the dissimilarity of two criteria based on the number of different
models. For each pair of criteria, the number of
instances of one same model (m) across each set of
100 replicates was counted, and their dissimilarity
was computed as [59]

Page 11 of 13

the 56 candidate models, we conducted another simulation (VI) as a special case using Recodon v.1.6.0
[60]. With the GY94 codon model [10] crossed with
the settings in parameter set-A for the 24 fundamental models of GTR family respectively, and with the
same base frequencies for all codon positions (1 × 4),
100 replicate datasets were simulated for each of the
24 simulated models here (i.e., a total 2,400). Other
simulation parameters were set as sequence length
999 bp, number of sequences 30, a constant nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω = 0.016) across
sites, and mutation rate 0.001. Following model selection with the four criteria as above, the dissimilarity
among the criteria was examined. Other aspects of
performance were not evaluated, as those analyses
were not practicable or were probably affected by the
fact that the true model was not represented among
the candidates.

Model biases

Based on the success of recovery of the true model in
each simulation (Number matched ; see the ‘Accuracy’
part), we employed the c 2 homogeneity test [42] to
compare the four criteria in terms of the composition of
selected models. Here, we adopted two standards to
classify the 24 simulated models (Table 1). Firstly, we
classified them into four categories: base (JC, K80, etc.),
base + I (JC + I, K80 + I, etc.), base + Γ (JC + Γ, K80 +
Γ, etc.), and base + I + Γ (JC + I + Γ, K80 + I + Γ, etc.).
These four model categories were then compared (with
3 degrees of freedom). Secondly, the 24 models were
classified into 11 categories according to the number of
free parameters (from 0 to 10; see Table 1 for details),
and then analysed by the statistical test (with 10 degrees
of freedom).

the generating model is more complex than any of
