Abstract
Background: Gene-based (genic) microsatellites are a useful tool for plant genetics and simple
sequence repeat loci can often be found in coding regions of the genome. While EST sequencing
can be used to discover genic microsatellites, direct screening of cDNA libraries for repeat motifs
can save on overall sequencing costs. The objective of this research was to screen a large cDNA
library from and Andean common bean genotype for six di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide repeat
motifs through a filter hybridization approach and to develop microsatellite markers from positive
clones.
Results: Robotics were used for high-throughput colony picking and to create a high-density filter
of 18,432 double spotted cDNA clones which was followed by hybridization with repeat motif
containing probes based on GA, CA, AAT, CAG, CAA and ACG repeats. A total of 1203 positive
clones were identified by their addresses and sequenced from 5' ends and if required from 3' ends
to confirm repeat motif and length. Out of 886 high quality sequences, 497 had complete
microsatellite loci that were not truncated by the sequencing reaction and of these tri-nucleotide
repeats were more common than di-nucleotide repeats. Different motifs were found in different
frequencies in the 5' and 3' ends of the cDNAs. In a microsatellite development program, primers
were designed for 248 SSR loci which were tested on a panel of 18 common bean genotypes to
determine their potential as genetic markers finding higher average polymorphism information
content for di-nucleotide repeat markers (0.3544) than for tri-nucleotide repeat markers (0.1536).
Conclusion: The present study provides a set of validated gene-based markers for common bean
that are derived from G19833, an Andean landrace that is an important source of disease and
abiotic stress tolerance which has been used for physical map development and as a mapping
parent. Gene-based markers appear to be very efficient at separating divergent wild and cultivated
accessions as well as Andean and Mesoamerican genepools and therefore will be useful for diversity
analyses and for comparative and transcript mapping in common bean.

Background
Microsatellites are molecular markers based on simple
sequence repeat (SSR) loci that can be isolated from both
coding and non-coding regions of the genome [1]. When
SSR loci are located within or near genes their contraction
and expansion can affect gene expression or lead to amino
acid substitutions or knock-out mutation in open reading
frames (ORFs) [2]. Gene-based microsatellites have been
found at a predictable frequency in gene coding regions of
many organisms and are often mined from expressed
sequence tag (EST) sequences [3,4] although they can also
be isolated by various direct laboratory methods from
cDNA libraries. Given their source, gene-based microsatellites are often called genic microsatellites or alternatively
cDNA or EST-derived simple sequence repeats.
Genic microsatellites are distinguished from genomic
microsatellites by being related to the transcriptome [4].
In other words, genic microsatellites may be found within
coding and/or regulatory regions of genes such as 5' and
3' un-translated region and promoters, where they may
sometimes affect gene expression. In contrast, genomic
microsatellites are usually developed by screening of random DNA fragments from throughout the genome, most
of which is non-transcribed. Genic microsatellites are
often located in introns, and un-translated regions of
sequenced cDNAs but can also be located in exons and in
translated regions of ORFs [2]. In the latter case, alleles of
genic microsatellites can be associated with structural
mutations that lead to novel proteins that are larger or
smaller than those of the original alleles and which can
have substituted or repeated amino acids. Gene-based
microsatellites have now been developed for a number of
crop species, mostly based on EST sequencing projects [510]. The alternative approach of hybridizing SSR motif
probes to cDNA libraries is another source of genic microsatellites, but in comparison is not widely used although
it has the benefit of being a more directed method of discovering microsatellites within genes.
Among the food legume crops known as pulses, common
bean is the most extensive and widely consumed [11].
After originating and being domesticated in two regions
of the New World, giving rise to an Andean and a Mesoamerican genepool, this crop spread to many secondary
centers of diversity based on its wide adaptability as a species. Common bean has one of the smallest and simplest,
non-duplicated genomes among the legumes and is
related to other tropical legumes in terms of genome
structure and gene orthology although it can only be
crossed with a few cultivated relatives [12]. Within common bean as a species, genepool distinctions between
Andean and Mesoamerican beans are notable with seed
size being a major distinguishing characteristic along with
molecular marker polymorphism [13]. Consumer prefer-

ences, dissimilar growing conditions and incompatibility
genes maintain these as separate groupings.
A small number of genic microsatellites have been developed for common bean by searching gene database
sequences as was done by Yu et al. [14,15] and Blair et al.
[16] and by mining an EST collection as was done by
Hanai et al. [17]; however the current number does not
exceed 100 independent loci. The source genotypes for the
genic microsatellites was variable in the case of the GenBank derived microsatellites while for the IAC-UNA microsatellites designed by Hanai et al. [17] a Brazilian small
seeded (Mesoamerican genepool) genotype was used. To
date, genic microsatellites have not been developed from
a large-seeded (Andean genepool) source genotype and
the polymorphism detected by gene-based microsatellites
has been moderate but biologically significant in distinguishing genepools [13,17]. Compared to gene-based
microsatellites there is now a large number of genomic
microsatellites [17-24] that have been derived from both
Andean and Mesoamerican common bean sources and
many of which have been genetically mapped [16,25,26].
It is notable that the genic microsatellites were found to be
useful for genetic mapping in common bean because they
were significantly less clustered than genomic microsatellites [16,24].
In terms of diversity assessment, Blair et al. [13] found
genic microsatellites, albeit a small sample of them (< 70),
to be of approximately one third lower diversity than
genomic microsatellites as measured in terms of polymorphism information content, but still found them to be
very useful for separating genepools and races. According
to these authors, a similar sample of Andean-derived
genomic microsatellites in the BM series have been highly
diverse in the Andean genepool but less so in the Mesoamerican genepool. Meanwhile, genic microsatellites have
been mainly developed from Mesoamerican genotypes
[17] but not from Andean genotypes. Some ascertainment
bias has been found in diversity analysis of genomic microsatellites with the markers developed from one
genepool being more diverse in that genepool than in the
other genepool of common bean. However, this has not
yet been confirmed for genic microsatellites or for
Andean-derived microsatellites. In summary, gene-based
microsatellites appear to be especially useful for genetic
analysis of common bean and it would be ideal to have a
larger set of these markers for comparative mapping and
functional diversity analysis especially those from Andean
sources.
The objective of this research, therefore, was to increase
the number of gene-based microsatellites through a cDNA
library screening approach followed by germplasm
screening. For this, multiple di and tri-nucleotide repeat

containing probes were used to screen for SSR containing
genes from a large scale cDNA library developed from
multiple source tissues of an Andean genepool genotype
(G19833 from race Peru). An Andean genepool genotype
was also used as they have been less well studied than
Mesoamerican beans for which a range of EST collections
have been generated. Newly-developed microsatellite
markers were evaluated on a diversity panel to determine
their utility in diversity assessment.

DNA contained on the filters with standard protocols
from Edwards et al. [28]. Briefly the filters were prehybridized in 100 mL of hybridization buffer for 4 – 6
hours at 60°C. Meanwhile, 10 pmoles of probe was endlabeled with 1 ul of T4 polynucleotide kinase (7 Unit/ul)
and 5 ul of γP32-ATP in a total reaction volume of 20 ul
that was incubated at 37°C for 80 minutes and stopped at
65°C for 20 minutes. The labeled oligo-nucleotide was
added directly to the pre-hybridizing filters and incubated
at 60°C for 12 hours.

Methods
Library construction
Library development was as described in Ramírez et al.
[27]. Briefly the library was made from total RNA prepared from common bean leaves and vegetative tissue of
three week old plants of the Andean cultivar 'G19833',
grown in a greenhouse at the International Center for
Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) under 12 hour photoperiod
and average night/day temperatures of 20°C/28°C.
G19833 is a Peruvian landrace from the Andean genepool
that produces large, elongated, yellow seed with red mottles. The cDNA library was made from poly(A) RNA that
was purified using oligo (dT) cellulose and reverse transcribed with MNLV reverse transcriptase and oligo (dT)
primer. The double stranded cDNA was synthesized with
polymerase I ribonuclease H co-incubation and directionally cloned into the NotI/SalI sites of the plasmid vector,
pCMVSport6.0 from Invitrogen Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA) using DNA ligase. The library, now named
PV_GEa was transformed into E. coli EMDH12S cells
which were plated at a density of 3000 cfu per plate onto
Q-plates with Carbenicillin (300 μg/mL), x-gal and IPTG
[26]. A Q-Bot robot (Genetix, Boston, MA, USA) and automatic blue/white screening was used to pick colonies and
these were arrayed into plates also by the robot. All the
clones were placed into 384-well plate format glycerol
stocks, grown overnight and stored at -80°C. The master
plates for the library were copied twice into working copies of the library. The Q-bot was then used to spot the
clones, with a double replicate 4 × 4 pattern, onto a gridded Hybond N+ membrane filter containing 6 fields of 8
× 384-well plates for a total of 48 plates.
Filter hybridization and library screening
Six simple sequence repeat motif oligonucleotide probes
were used to screen the cDNA library filters. The probes
included two that targeted di-nucleotides repeat motifs,
namely (CA)20 and (GA)20; and four that targeted trinucleotide repeat motifs, namely (AAT)14; (CAG)14;
(CAA)14; and (ACG)14, where the sequence within the
parenthesis indicates the repeat and the number outside
the parenthesis indicates the number of copies of that
repeat. Probe preparation and hybridization consisted in
end labeling the simple sequence repeat motif probes
with T4 DNA Kinase and hybridizing the mixture to the

Both the di-nucleotide motif probes were grouped
together for filter hybridization as were all the tri-nucleotide motif probes. After the hybridization step, the filters
were washed twice at 60°C with 6× SSC/0.1% SDS for 5
minutes each. Longer washes were used when signal was
intense (> 100,000 cpm). The filters were blotted dry, covered with saran-wrap and arranged face-up in cassettes
along with three sheets of X-ray film. The films were taped
to each other so that they would not shift during the 0 to
8 day exposure in a -80°C freezer. Films were developed
after three days to identify positive clones. Filters were reused for sequential screening of different oligo-nucleotide
repeats by stripping them between each use. Stripping
consisted in washing the filters at room temperature in
100 mM NaOH, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS twice, followed
by a 5× SSPE (1.2.1 175.3 g NaCl; 27.6 g NaHPO4-H20;
7.4 g EDTA; in 800 mL H20; adjust pH = 7.4 with aprox.
6.5 mL 10 N NaOH) rinse for 10 min.
Clone identification and sequencing
Positive clones were identified by which filter they were
on; which field within the filter they were in, and what
address they had within the field. Clones could be identified by their position in the double-replicate 4 × 4 pattern
found at each grid axis in the address system. Only double-spotted clones were selected. Any spots for which the
replicate did not hybridize were considered false positives
and were not selected. Putative simple sequence repeatcontaining clones were picked from their appropriate
position in the 384-well plate format glycerol stocks. DNA
was extracted from an overnight culture by standard alkaline lysis procedures according to Sambrook [29] and
used for sequencing initially from the 5' end using a SP6
primer and then from the 3' end with a T7 primer in cases
where an SSR was not detected at the 5'end. Sequencing
reactions were performed on ABI sequencers at Clemson
University Genomics Institute and at CIAT. All sequences
were searched for vector segments to check for insert
integrity. The sequences containing a minimum of 100
high quality bases, with phred value of 20 or above, were
trimmed to remove vector and adaptor sequences, blasted
with blastn or blastx and an E-30 value threshold against
the Genebank nr and EST databases and searched for simple sequence repeats as described below.

Primer design and testing
SSRs were found in the sequenced clones using the SSR
identification tool (SSRIT) available at http://
www.gramene.org/ to screen for all possible repeats with
sequences containing a minimum of five di-nucleotide,
four tri-nucleotide or three tetra-nucleotide motif repeats
used for primer design. Primer 3.0 http://
www.genome.wi.mit.edu/ was then used to design primer
pairs which would produce PCR amplification fragments
that were on average 150 bp long. All PCR primers had
consistent melting temperatures of 55°C or above, average lengths of 20 nucleotides or more and primer pairs
were checked to make sure that they had similar melting
temperatures and did not suffer from palindromes or end
pairing. The newly-designed Microsatellites were tested
against a standard survey of 18 genotypes from Blair et al.
[13], among which a total of 7 were Andean (5 cultivated
and 2 wild accessions) and 11 were Mesoamerican (10
cultivated and 1 wild accessions). The three wild accessions represented accessions from Argentina, Colombia
and Mexico. Among the cultivated genotypes, 4 were Mesoamerican advanced breeding lines from CIAT (BAT477,
BAT881, DOR364 and DOR390), one was a locally bred
Andean large red seeded variety (Radical Cerinza) and the
remainder were germplasm accessions (G lines) which
were equally divided among the genepools. DNA for each
of these genotypes was extracted by a mini prep method
[30] and was quantified with a Hoefer DyNA Quant 2000
fluorometer for dilution to a standard concentration of 10
ng/ul before using in PCR reactions.
PCR amplifications and allele detection
Standard PCR conditions from Blair et al. [13] were then
used for amplification reactions: namely, a hot start of
92°C for 5 minutes; then 30 cycles of 92°C denaturing for
1 minute; 47°C annealing for 1 minute and 72°C extension for 2 minutes; followed by a 5 minute final extension
at 72°C. The final volume for the PCR reaction was 20 μL
which included 50 ng of genomic DNA, 0.1 mM of each
of the forward and reverse primers, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.2), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 to 2.5 mM MgCl2, depending on the
primer combination, 250 mM of total dNTP and 1 unit of
Taq polymerase. After amplification, a volume of 5 μL of
formamide, containing 0.4% bromophenol blue and
0.25% w/v xylene cyanol FF, was added to each PCR reaction and the mixture was denatured at 92°C for 2 minutes. Polymorphism was detected on 4% denaturing
polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide: bis-acrylamide) gels
that contained 5 M urea and 0.5× TBE and which were run
in Sequi-Gen GT electrophoresis units (Biorad, Hercules,
CA, USA) at a constant power of 120 W. Detection of PCR
amplification products was via silver staining according to
the Manufacturer's guide (Promega Inc., Madison, WI,
USA) with some modifications, namely repeated use of
the staining and developing solutions through a re-circu-

lating tank system. Allele sizes were determined by comparison of SSR versus molecular weight standard band
migration. A matrix of allele values and genotypes was
used to calculate dissimilarity between genotypes and to
construct a simple-matching neighbor joining dendogram
which was subjected to 1000 bootstraps using the software program DARwin 5.0 [31].

Results
The cDNA library used for this research consisted of
18,432 clones which were arrayed on filters of 36,864
spots each representing 48 plates of 384 clones for a total
of 18,432 unique addresses. The preparation of the highdensity filters was made possible by the high-throughput
and automated nature of the robot used to pick colonies
and array the final clones from the plate system to the filters. In addition, the arraying and screening of the library
was facilitated by the high quality of the cDNA library
itself which was reflected in all the clones (100%) having
inserts, in the average insert size of 1.3 kb and in the transformation efficiency of 3.85 × 106.
Hybridization of the cDNA library with SSR-containing
probes detected a total of 1203 positive clones of which
886 were successfully sequenced. These represented 6.5
and 4.8% of the total number of clones in the library,
respectively. The read length for the sequences was on
average over 700 nucleotides. However, where sequences
were short or of low quality it was usually because of difficulty in sequencing through simple sequence repeats
from the 5 'end of the cDNA clones or through mononucleotide stretches, such as poly A tails encountered in
sequencing from the 3' end. SSR loci were sequenced successfully and clearly identified for a total of 497 clones
which represented 2.7% of the full cDNA library and
41.3% of the hybridizing clones. The frequency of individual SSR motifs found in the 5' and 3'sequencing is
shown in Table 1.
In terms of repeat length, totals of 209 di-nucleotide and
224 tri-nucleotide motif SSRs were found in the successful
sequences representing 42.1 and 45.1% of the total
number of successfully sequenced clones, respectively
with the remainder being tetra- or penta- nucleotide
repeats similar to the di-nucleotide repeats we used as
probes. Among the di-nucleotide repeats there were
approximately three times more AG motif microsatellites
(124) than AC motif microsatellites (48), and only a few
AT microsatellites were found (24). Interestingly, while
the AG and AC motif microsatellites were much more
likely to be in the 5' sequences, about half of the AT microsatellites (11 out of 24) were found in the 3' sequences.
Meanwhile, no CG microsatellites were found. Among the
tri-nucleotide containing repeats, the most common by a
factor of almost three was AGC with a total of 83 clones,

followed by AAC and AGG with 36 and 31 clones, respectively. More than 20 clones each were found for AAG and
ACC motifs; while less than 10 clones were found containing AAT or CCG motifs. The proportion of tri-nucleotide SSR at the 5' end was generally high, between 80 and
96%, except for the AAT motif for which it was 22%.
The most promising positive SSR containing clones were
used to design microsatellite primers for the development
of new markers for common bean (see Additional file 1).
A total of 248 microsatellite primer pairs were designed
from the positive cDNA clones after SSR probe hybridization. These targeted di-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide motifs
in clones which had high-quality sequences flanking both
sides of the repeat motif and good primer design sites in
terms of GC content and non-annealing or non-palindromic sequences. We decided not to target tetra-nucleotide
or penta-nucleotide repeat containing sequences since
they usually are of low polymorphism. The new markers
were named as part of the BMc series with this abbreviation standing for Bean Microsatellites based on cDNA
clones and with a consecutive number starting at 121 and
ending at 368 to distinguish from previous SSRs analyzed
in Ramírez et al. [27].
The newly-designed microsatellite markers were similar to
the overall sequenced clones in terms of the SSR motifs
they contained and the repeat length of the SSR themselves but concentrated on di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide repeats since they generally have higher
polymorphism than the longer motifs. Through blastn
searches we showed that many loci were homologous to

legume genes (84) or ESTs from common bean (210). The
number of repeats for each of the repeat types is shown in
Figure 1 with the average number being 9.59 repeats for
the 112 di-nucleotide based markers and 6.18 repeats for
the 136 tri-nucleotide based markers. The distribution of
the repeat numbers for the markers showed skewing
towards the lower end of the distribution with a few high
repeat number microsatellites such as BMc367 which targeted a GA motif locus with 21 repeats or BMc256 which
targeted an ATA motif locus with 39 repeats.
Most of the microsatellites targeted were simple rather
than compound with a total of 203 microsatellites
(81.6%) targeting a single motif and 45 microsatellites
(18.4%) targeting more than one motif. Several of the
microsatellites with a large number of total repeats
detected compound SSRs, in the case of the di-nucleotides
often this consisted of GA or CA motifs combined with AT
motifs as was the case for BMc294 and BMc284. Meanwhile the high repeat number tri-nucleotide markers
included compound SSR that had more than one repeat
type such as BMc223 with the motif (CAG)10(GCA)6. A
somewhat higher proportion (43/112) of dinucleotide
markers fit the category of Class I microsatellites (10 or
more repeats) compared to the proportion of trinucleotide markers (38/136) fitting this category (7 or more
repeats).
The diversity values for all the markers that amplified well
were estimated based on the evaluation of 18 genotypes
from the same mini-core panel evaluated by Blair et al.
[13] that contained representative diversity from both

genepools and from wild beans. The resulting marker
evaluation could distinguish 1) monomorphic microsatellites that detected only one allele; 2) polymorphic microsatellites that detected different alleles in the wild
accessions, but not within the cultivated accessions; 3) biallelic microsatellites that detected different alleles for
Andean versus Mesoamerican accessions across various
wild and cultivated genotypes and 4) more polymorphic
microsatellites that detected different alleles across all or
most of the accessions, especially those of the Andean
genepool. Figure 2 shows the amplification pattern for

each of these types of markers. A characteristic of the
cDNA based microsatellites developed here was a low
amount of stutter band and a sharp amplification product
in the silver stained gels which made it easy to detect polymorphisms in the group of genotypes evaluated. Among
the full set of markers, 122 primer pairs detected polymorphism across the full set of genotypes, while 82 markers
were monomorphic due to conserved gene sequence. A
total of 10 markers were polymorphic in the wild accessions but not in the cultivated accessions. The range in
number of alleles detected in the germplasm survey was

up to 15 alleles for the di-nucleotide repeat markers and
up to 6 alleles for the tri-nucleotide markers with averages
of 3.5 and 1.9, respectively.
Polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from
0.000 to 0.9159, with the most polymorphic markers
being BMc238, BMc292, BMc321, BMc171, BMc367,
BMc294 and BMc226, all di-nucleotide repeat based
markers with PIC values above 0.8000. The most polymorphic tri-nucleotide repeat based markers were
BMc349, BMc229 and BMc335 with PIC values of 0.6171,
0.6268 and 0.6270, respectively. The average PIC value
was higher for the di-nucleotide based markers (0.3544)
than for the tri-nucleotide based markers (0.1563). The
high PIC markers tended to be the SSRs with high repeat
number and correlation between these values was highly
significant (r = 0.575, P = 0.0000). Allele number was
even more closely correlated with repeat number (r =
0.614, P = 0.000). The distributions of PIC values and
allele numbers are shown in Figure 3. Average PIC values
were 0.4795 and 0.3908 for the polymorphic di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide based markers, respectively. Nonamplification was found for 17.7% of the markers and
could have been due to either the forward or reverse
primer not annealing to the genomic DNA due to intron
sequences not considered when designing the exon-based
primers or due to non-amplification with the PCR protocol used here which was designed for small fragments.
Non-amplifying markers were not retested but are presented since they might amplify with touchdown PCR
conditions or longer extension times.
Among the accessions analyzed the most likely to be polymorphic using the new BMc markers were 1) the wild
accession from Colombia (G24404); 2) the wild accession from Mexico (G24390); and 3) the race Peru accessions, G19833, G21657 or Radical Cerinza and 4) the
Mesoamerican landraces G11350 or G14519. Generally,
there were more polymorphisms within the Andean
germplasm than within the Mesoamerican breeding lines
or germplasm accessions. Figure 4 shows the genetic relationships between the genotypes and the separations of
Andean and Mesoamerican genepools from each other
and from the wild accessions G24390 and G24404 from
Mexico and Colombia, respectively, which were supported by very high bootstrap values ranging from 95 to
100%. The Andean genepool included the Argentinean
wild accession G19892 and the landrace G21242 was
found to be intermediate between the genepools confirming results from Blair et al. [13].

Discussion
The approach taken here for gene-based microsatellite
development was based on the targeted identification of
SSRs in high-density filter arrayed clones from a large

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/100

cDNA library. This was facilitated by the robotic picking of
a large number of clones (over 18 thousand) and the automated library duplication and filter preparation features
of the Q-bot. Meanwhile, the cDNA library we used was
made to represent a wide range of vegetative tissue from
three week old, greenhouse-grown plants including young
and old leaves, stem and vascular tissues, as well as vegetative meristems and therefore as a multi-tissue library
was appropriate to upscale with this technology. To picture the scale of the library, a total of nearly 24 MB of nonredundant transcriptome sequences were represented in
the filter set based on the number of clones screened, the
low redundancy of clones and the average cDNA insert
size of 1.3 kb, which compares favorably to other cDNA
libraries that have been used in EST sequencing projects
[27].
Hybridization of the cDNA library was straightforward in
the filter format used. Positive hit addresses were confirmed through double replicate spots and the next product was a large number of SSR candidate loci which were
then sequenced to confirm whether the hybridizing
clones from each library had true SSR loci or were false
positives. In this step, it was possible to discover the SSR
motif and number of repetitions that each positive clone
contained. It was important to sequence from both the 5'
and 3' ends of the positive cDNA clones to obtain the full
SSR and flanking sequences and to be able to design microsatellite primer pairs around the repeat motif. This was
also important given the size of the cDNA clones, especially for the larger cDNA clones.
The use of di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide SSR probes for
filter hybridization and the sequencing confirmation of
clones allowed us to calculate the frequencies of various
types of motifs in the cDNA library. The results showed
that the frequencies of di-nucleotide and tri-nucleotide
clones were almost equal in the cDNA library although
the tri-nucleotide positive clones were somewhat more
frequent than the di-nucleotide positive clones. These
results contrast with those of Yu et al. [14] who found 17
di-nucleotide and 11 tri-nucleotide SSRs for Phaseolus in
their search of the NCBI gene database; and also with
those of Hanai et al. [17] who found 137 di-nucleotide
and 96 tri-nucleotide in their search of a unigene set from
Melotto et al. [32]. Genomic microsatellites have tended
to be more often based on di-nucleotide motifs than trinucleotide motifs in various un-enriched, small-insert
libraries screened in our laboratory [33].
Our results suggest that tri-nucleotide repeat are more
common in coding sequences than across the entire bean
genome, which would be interesting given the triplet
nature of tri-nucleotide SSR which is more compatible
with the conserved nature of most open reading frames

[2]. Tri-nucleotide repeats have usually been more common than di-nucleotide repeats in various EST collections
although this is more pronounced in cereals than in dicotyledonous crops and less pronounced in full length or
assembled ESTs [3,6,8,9]. Meanwhile, we were surprised
to find that the cDNA clones we selected had a few tetranucleotide simple sequence repeats related to the motifs
that were screened in the hybridization.

In terms of the frequency of individual motifs, the results
indicate that GA motif microsatellites were more common
than CA motif microsatellite in the sequences of the
cDNA library used for this study with implications for the
common bean transcriptome. The higher frequency found
for GA motifs agrees with results of microsatellite development in several other plant species based on ESTs
[3,9,34]. Another explanation for the higher prevalence of

BMC Plant Biology 2009, 9:100

GA versus CA motif microsatellites in our study could be
that the hybridization worked better for this probe
although both oligo-nucleotides had the same melting
temperature so this seems unlikely. Among the di-nucleotide motifs that were not used to screen the library, we
also found a small number of AT-motif microsatellites,
often in the same clones that contained GA or CA motif
microsatellites. We pursued these markers since AT motif
SSR have proven to be highly polymorphic in common
bean [24]. Interestingly, the AT motifs were as likely to
occur in the 3'end of the cDNA clones as in the 5'end of
these. This was in contrast to the GA and CA microsatellites which were ten times more frequent in the 5'end than
in the 3'end of the cDNA. Meanwhile, no CG motif microsatellites were found in the cDNA clones perhaps
because we did not screen for this SSR type.
When comparing our results with those of Hanai et al.
(2007) we can observe some similarities, as these authors
found that AG motif SSR were four times more likely than
AC motif microsatellites, that AT microsatellites were
fairly common (27% of all dinucleotide SSR) and that no
CG motif microsatellites were present in a set of 3,126
common bean unigenes. The differences between our
study and theirs in terms of precise number of motifs may
have been the result of the random nature of EST sequencing versus the hybridization approach we used, or because
Hanai et al. [17] only searched 5' ESTs rather than both 5'
and 3' end sequences as we did. It was significant that in
both analyses, CG motif microsatellites were impossible
to find.
Among the trinucleotide repeats, we found AGC microsatellites to be very common, representing 37.1% of the total
for the tri-nucleotide SSR as might be expected since this
was one of the motifs used as a hybridization probe. The
next most common tri-nucleotide motifs (AAC and AGG)
were also used as hybridization probes, but were less than
half as frequent as this previous motif, representing little
more than 5% of the total SSRs found. Two fairly common motifs not used as hybridization probes, AAG and
ACC were also identified with the library screening procedure, perhaps because they were similar to the di-nucleotide motif probes used. Finally small number of other trinucleotide motif SSRs were found as compound repeats
with the more common tri-nucleotide repeats or with the
di-nucleotide repeats that had been hybridized with. One
interesting trend for the ATA tri- nucleotide motif which
was also used as a probe was that these SSR were more
likely in the 3' end of the cDNA clones than in the 5' end
just as we found for the AT di-nucleotide repeats. No other
tri-nucleotide motif presented this same situation and in
most cases very few of the tri-nucleotide motifs occurred
in the 3' end which is similar to results from Thiel et al. [7]

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/100

for barley where 5' and 3' ESTs yielded different amounts
of polymorphic di-, tri and tetra-nucleotide repeats.
These results differ from the relative tri-nucleotide motif
frequencies found by Yu et al. [14] or Hanai et al. [17]
who identified larger numbers of ACC, AAG and ATC loci,
perhaps because they did not use the hybridization
approach we used and were instead screening unselected
sequences. AAG tri-nucleotide motifs were common in
soybean ESTs according to Gao et al. [3]. Finally in terms
of the motifs found in this study, we did not screen the
library for tetra-nucleotide motif microsatellites but also
found them occasionally in the 3' end of the cDNA clones,
while penta-nucleotide repeats were uncommon but
located at the 5' end of the cDNA clones positive for this
motif. Interestingly, Yu et al. [14] found a large number of
tetra-nucleotide motifs in the sequences they searched,
which averaged 1.35 kb per sequence, compared to Hanai
et al. [17] who searched shorter EST sequences from Melotto et al. [32].
All together, these results give us a good idea of which
motifs are common in cDNA sequences and at which end
of the cDNAs they occur. The total percentage of ESTs that
might be expected to contain SSRs is at least 6.52% based
on the number of cDNA clones that hybridized with SSR
probes in this study. If a larger number of hybridization
probes of different motifs had been used, an even larger
percentage of the cDNA clones would likely have been
identified as containing SSR. The large size of the G19833
cDNA library and the comprehensiveness of the filter
screening approach would make the discovery of further
SSRs very likely and both library hybridization and EST
sequencing as described in Ramírez et al. [27] will be useful for this effort. In other efforts to develop gene-based
microsatellites from cDNA sequences, the frequency of
SSRs has also been high. For example, in searching their
unigene set, Hanai et al. [17] found that 7.01% of the
genes contained SSR. Yu et al. [14] searching larger gene
fragments as mentioned earlier, predicted that 23.8% of a
limited set of entries from GenBank (206) contained SSR
loci.
The source of the RNA for the cDNA library was made
from G19833, a race Peru landrace from the Andean
genepool, which is one parent of a genetic mapping population that has been used to map microsatellite markers
[16,24], to study low P adaptation QTLs [35,36] and to
create a BAC library to anchor to the first physical map for
the species [37]. The screening of this library was complementary to our previous microsatellite marker development which was done with DOR364, a Mesoamerican
source used to create un-enriched, small insert libraries
[33] as well as marker development in Brazil which has

used Perola and IAC-UNA, two other Mesoamerican varieties [17,21,22]. Other Andean sources used to clone microsatellites, such as Calima used for the enriched libraries
of Gaitan et al. [18] have been from the Nueva Granada
race rather than from race Peru. In comparison, G19833 is
a valuable source material since it is the first genotype
used to create a physical map for common bean [37] and
the G19833 EST sequences have been compared to ESTs
from Negro Jamapa 81, showing a large number of polymorphisms in contiged sequences [27].
The sequencing from both the 5'and 3'ends of positive
cDNAs was especially valuable for discovering the full
complement of microsatellites in the selected clones. This
is in contrast to most other studies of gene-based microsatellites which in using the more commonly available 5'
ESTs, may not give a complete picture of the frequency of
microsatellites in expressed sequences, precisely because
they rely on partial sequencing of the cDNA (ESTs). On
the other hand, an advantage of EST mining of SSRs is the
possibility of sampling genes represented in various
cDNA libraries or genes expressed in different organs, at
different developmental stages or under varying environmental conditions which can give a complete picture of
transcribed genes [27]. The use of additional cDNA libraries, full length cDNA clones or 3' EST sequencing may be
valuable for future microsatellite development, as will
analysis with next generation sequencing techniques that
can be used to shotgun transcriptomes and reconstruct
them bioinformatically.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/100

shown them to also be transferable to tepary bean, P. acutifolius, which belongs to the tertiary genepool of common
bean (this laboratory, unpublished). This suggests that the
gene-based SSRs could be candidates for transfer beyond
the boundaries of the tertiary genepool (to other Phaseolus
species) or potentially to cowpea and other Vigna species.
Supporting this hypothesis, some gene-derived microsatellites from common bean have been effective for diversity assessment in cowpea (S. Hearne, pers.
Communication); and EST-derived SSRs are known to be
better for transferability among related species than
genomic SSR [6,38].
The overall success rate of marker development, from the
step of sequencing to primer design was 57.3% for the di
and tri- nucleotide markers which were targeted in our
study. This is very similar to the success rate for SSR primer
design from EST sequences from common bean (64.5%)
reported by Hanai et al. [17]. In that study, 86 out of 240
ESTs had SSRs that were not flanked by unique sequences
either because they were too close to the end of the
sequences or had poor primer design sites, while in our
study 185 out of 497 had such a situation. Careful design
of microsatellite primers is important in obtaining a high
percentage of amplification. Furthermore, having single
copy PCR products between 90 and 250 bases in length
allow an easy detection of microsatellite alleles on polyacrylamide gels, which makes these markers ideal for
medium sized laboratories interested in genetic mapping.

Conclusion
Another practical result of this study was that the careful
analysis of both 5' and 3' end sequences allowed us to
develop a large set of new gene-based microsatellites for
diversity assessment or gene tagging projects in common
bean. In terms of genetic diversity, the markers detected a
moderate number of alleles compared to genomic microsatellites we have evaluated on the same set of genotypes
[13,24], however the distribution of alleles was very predictive of genepool status and diversity was higher within
the Andean compared to the Mesoamerican genepool
showing some ascertainment bias as found before. It was
notable that the most divergent accessions were the wild
accessions from Colombia and Mexico and the new markers were very predictive of their relationship to the cultivated accessions based on high bootstrap values. The wild
Argentinean accession meanwhile was found within the
Andean genepool which agrees with results from Blair et
al. [13] suggesting they are useful as gene-based markers
for studying race structure and perhaps phylogeny if
homoplasy is not a factor.
In addition to being valuable functional markers, the new
microsatellites were highly transferable from cultivated to
wild accessions. Testing of cDNA based microsatellites has

In summary, this study was successful at determining the
relative microsatellite motif frequency in cDNA libraries
based on a hybridization approach. In addition, the study
produced a large set of Andean-derived, gene-based microsatellites for functional diversity analysis which are
complementary to previously developed genomic and
Mesoamerican derived markers. The markers were of
moderate polymorphism but were very efficient at separating divergent wild and cultivated accessions as well as
Andean and Mesoamerican genepools. Multiple microsatellite development approaches are important in common
bean given the dual genepool nature of genetic diversity in
the crop and the fact that ascertainment bias is a common
problem with microsatellites. Gene-based markers from
common bean are predicted to be useful for further phylogenetic analysis of the crop, for transfer to related species
especially other cultivated Phaseolus species and for the
development of a transcript map for common bean.
