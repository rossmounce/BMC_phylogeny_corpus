Chromatin-driven de novo discovery of DNA
binding motifs in the human malaria parasite
Elena Y Harris2, Nadia Ponts1, Karine G Le Roch1* and Stefano Lonardi2*

Abstract
Background: Despite extensive efforts to discover transcription factors and their binding sites in the human
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, only a few transcription factor binding motifs have been experimentally
validated to date. As a consequence, gene regulation in P. falciparum is still poorly understood. There is now
evidence that the chromatin architecture plays an important role in transcriptional control in malaria.
Results: We propose a methodology for discovering cis-regulatory elements that uses for the first time exclusively
dynamic chromatin remodeling data. Our method employs nucleosome positioning data collected at seven time
points during the erythrocytic cycle of P. falciparum to discover putative DNA binding motifs and their
transcription factor binding sites along with their associated clusters of target genes. Our approach results in 129
putative binding motifs within the promoter region of known genes. About 75% of those are novel, the remaining
being highly similar to experimentally validated binding motifs. About half of the binding motifs reported show
statistically significant enrichment in functional gene sets and strong positional bias in the promoter region.
Conclusion: Experimental results establish the principle that dynamic chromatin remodeling data can be used in
lieu of gene expression data to discover binding motifs and their transcription factor binding sites. Our approach
can be applied using only dynamic nucleosome positioning data, independent from any knowledge of gene
function or expression.

Background
One of the major challenges in molecular biology is to
characterize the mechanisms governing the regulation of
transcription. Mechanisms of regulation can be broadly
classified in three classes: (1) interaction of a control factor with DNA, (2) interaction of a control factor with the
transcriptional complex, and (3) epigenetic factors. In
this paper we are interested in elucidating mechanisms
that belong to the first class, in which transcription factor
proteins modulate expression levels by binding to one or
more specific sites in the promoter region of a gene. The
problem of identifying in silico transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) has been studied intensively. As a result
a variety of algorithms and tools have been developed
(see [1] for a review). Typically, these methodologies
involve obtaining a set of genes which are known to be

co-expressed or functionally-related and searching for
common (over-represented) short “motifs” in their promoter regions. The underlying hypothesis is that coexpressed or functionally-related genes are expected to
share common TFBS.
Algorithms for motif discovery can be enumerative or
alignment-based. Enumerative techniques involve the
enumeration of all the possible motifs in the promoters,
the assignment of an appropriate score based on probabilistic models, and a criteria to select the most statistically significant motifs. Alignment-based methods use
probabilistic modeling and combinatorial optimization,
e.g., expectation maximization or Gibbs sampling, to
identify sequence patterns that are over-represented in
the context of the promoter regions. Commonly used
tools for motif discovery include MEME [2], Weeder [3],
Gibbs Motif Sampler [4] and AlignACE [5]. In general,
the discovery of very short or highly degenerated motifs
remains statistically challenging. Therefore, these tools
have only a limited success when used alone, especially
when the ~80% AT-rich genome of the human malaria

parasite is considered. In response to an urgent need to
understand how P. falciparum regulates its genes, several
ad-hoc techniques to discover cis-regulatory elements
have been developed specifically for the malaria parasite.
Young et al.’s Gene Enrichment Motif Searching (GEMS)
[6] uses a hypergeometric-based scoring scheme and a
position-specific weight matrix optimization procedure
to identify putative motifs. The input to GEMS are
twenty-one clusters of functionally related or coexpressed genes in P. falciparum. The ouput is 34 putative TFBS in promoter sequences and 21 TFBS in
introns-derived sequences. The method proposed by Wu
et al. [7] compares evolutionarily related species of Plasmodium and uses orthologous sequences to identify conserved TFBS. The method identified 38 TFBS that
partially overlap previously reported putative TFBS in P.
falciparum [2,8]. Elemento et al. [9,10] propose an algorithm called Finding Informative Regulatory Elements
(FIRE) that measures the mutual information between
sequences and gene expression profiles, which is used to
select the most statistically significant motifs. While most
of the experiments are carried out in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the authors report 21 putative TFBS in P. falciparum. Iengar and Joshi [11] combined the strenght of
MEME [2], AlignACE [5] and Weeder [3], to identify
putative TFBS in promoters of P. falciparum coexpressed genes. The authors used strict cut-offs and
selected only motifs that were found by all three software
tools. This study resulted in 27 sets of putative TFBS.
The success of computational TFBS discovery methods
critically depends on the a priori knowledge about which
genes are co-regulated or functionally-related and therefore more likely to share common TFBS. Carrying out this
step can be challenging because (1) gene functional annotation are often incomplete or inaccurate, (2) gene expression profiles are often limited to a subset of the genes or
specific events during the cell cycle and (3) genome-wide
expression data can be incomplete. For instance, P. falciparum has 5418 protein-coding genes of which about
2500 have no known function and only ~3200 have stable
and constitutive expression profile. Furthermore, gene
clustering rely on the measurement of mRNA steady state
levels that are not a direct measure of transcriptional activity but reflect both mechanisms of transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation. As a consequence, the
resulting clusters are likely to be incomplete or incorrect.
Recent alternative approaches that exploit the chromatin structure information to identify TFBS are based on
the observation that active TFBS are usually nucleosome-depleted. Nucleosome occupancy data has already
shown to improve the discovery of TFBS employed in a
few model organisms (e.g., [12-15]). Nucleosome information is typically used in combination with sequence
sets generated by ChIP experiments and occasionally

mRNA expression profiles rather than alone. Collecting
all nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome would
indeed generate a very high number of sequence sets
without transcription-related specificity. To circumvent
this problem, we propose to use dynamic changes of
nucleosome occupancy (e.g., across time, such as the
duration of a cell cycle) to build sets of genes that are
likely to be co-regulated. We demonstrate the power of
our approach in the context of the search for potential
TFBS in P. falciparum’s genome using nucleosome positioning data obtained at seven time points during the
erythrocytic asexual cycle. This approach is general, and
can be applied to any organism for which nucleosome
occupancy data at various time points or under varying
conditions are available. Here, we identify 129 potential
DNA binding motifs in the human malaria parasite’s
genome, most of them being novel. These results represent a major resource for the human malaria parasite,
with significant implications for future investigations.

Results and Discussion
Methodology outline

In a previous analysis of the chromatin architecture in
P. falciparum [16], we used FAIRE (formaldehydeassisted isolation of regulatory elements) coupled with
next generation sequencing, or FAIRE-seq, to study the
variations of nucleosome occupancy across its intra-erythrocytic cycle. Samples of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were collected with six-hours increment for 36
hours (seven time points), which is the duration of one
cycle of growth, replication, and maturation into multiplied invasive parasites. The parasites’ chromatin status
at all seven time points was analyzed by FAIRE-seq.
Briefly, the method involves the chemical cross-linking of
the chromatin followed by shearing, protein-free DNA
purification, and sequencing. FAIRE-seq therefore isolates and reveals nucleosome-free regions of the genome.
In general, we found that nucleosomes are more abundant within malaria gene bodies whereas promoters are
relatively nucleosome-depleted (i.e., with high FAIRE-seq
read coverage). In that context, we analyzed the variations of chromatin availability (i.e., the variations of
FAIRE-seq read coverage) at the loci of two validated
TFBS that are specific to apicomplexan AP2-related transcription factors [17]. We observed that the chromatin
availability of these TFBS varies significantly across time
[16]; the presence/absence of nucleosomes masks/reveals
the TFBS and thereby modulates the binding of the
ApiAP2 transcription factors. These elements indicate
that one should be looking for TFBS within the regions
of the genome with variable FAIRE-seq coverage. Here,
we analyze the regions of the P. falciparum genome covered by FAIRE-seq sequenced reads with the highest variance of FAIRE-seq coverage across the seven time points

of the erythrocytic cycle - i.e., nucleosome-depleted
regions that are potentially accessible to transcription
factors in a cycle-dependent manner - to discover novel
putative TFBS.
Figure 1 illustrates an overview of our method (details
can be found in the Methods section). First, we define
the functional window of a gene as the nucleosomesized region within 1000 bp upstream of the start codon
(regions containing promoters) with the highest variance
of FAIRE-seq coverage across the seven time points (see
Figure 2 for an example). The choice of the functional
window is completely independent from the sequence
content. In fact, the nucleotide distribution inside the
functional windows and in the rest of the promoters are
highly similar (the proportion of As, Cs, Gs and Ts
inside the functional windows compared to the rest of
the promoters respectively are: 0.416 vs. 0.422; 0.064 vs.
0.068; 0.064 vs. 0.070; 0.456 vs. 0.440).
The FAIRE-seq coverage within the functional window is
then averaged for each time point, creating a seven-point
chromatin availability profile for the considered gene
These profiles are used for k-means clustering of the genes.
Using k = 15, we obtained clusters of 33 to 841 genes, for
an average of 364 genes per cluster (data not shown). The
sequence sets from the functional windows within the
same cluster are used as input for the discovery of putative
TFBS, hereafter called motifs. Since the only experimentally-validated motifs for P. falciparum are either six or
eight bp-long, we restricted the present analysis to motifs
of six, seven and eight nucleotides in length. Our method
can however be used with motifs of any length.
For each cluster, all possible motifs of size six to eight
nucleotides in length were searched within the functional

windows of each gene. Frequencies of each motif were
then modelled according to a hypergeometric probability
distribution that measures the chances that the frequency
of a given motif would be observed if the input sequences
would have been selected randomly. The hypergeometric
enrichment score or HES captures the statistical significance of the over-representation of a given motif in a
given group (e.g., significance threshold set at HES = 2 ⇔
p = 0.01). Motifs and their variants were selected according to their HES values. This step selected 2727 6-mers,
8813 7-mers, and 19,435 8-mers in the P. falciparum
genome.
In the next refinement step, we examined the representation of each selected motif in the genome. For each motif,
we selected all the genes with at least one occurrence of
the motif within their functional windows. This set of
genes is the target gene cluster of a given motif. Figure 3
shows the distribution of motifs representation according
to the sizes of the target gene clusters. The majority of
motifs are found within target gene clusters with sizes ranging from 100 to 400. The average cluster size is 139 genes
with a standard deviation of 279. These observations are
consistent with the fact that the distance between genes of
larger clusters is higher than the one measured for clusters
more restricted in size. Such big clusters are likely to contain a more diluted and noisy information and thus to contain a lesser amount of potential motifs. We proceeded to
another round of motif identification using our HES-based
method applied to the functional windows of genes within
their target clusters. In order to remove spurious motifs
three filtering steps are carried out. First, motifs with a
HES lower than the average HES for all motifs of the same
length were excluded. The average values of HES for 6-,

7- and 8-mers were 121.9, 88.19 and 73.16 respectively. For
our data set, this requirement on HES is significantly more
stringent than application of the Bonferroni correction
coefficient for multiple testing. Then we used phylogenetic
conservation information. Four other Plasmodium species
closely related to P. falciparum were considered in our
analysis: Plasmodium vivax (human host), Plasmodium
berghei, Plasmodium chabaudi, and Plasmodium yoelii
(rodent hosts). A motif was retained for downstream analysis when its HES in corresponding orthologous genes was
at least two (i.e., p-value ≤ 0.01) in at least one of the four
orthologous species. To ensure that high orthologous HES
were not due to a random chance, we applied a randomized analysis of orthologous HES that further reduced
the list of potential candidates for true motifs. After the filtration step, a total of 227 6-mers, 125 7-mers and 217 8mers remained.

Finally, since motifs are usually degenerated to various
extents, they were regrouped according to their similarities measured by the Tanimoto distance [3,6] and the
Pearson coefficient of position weight matrix (PWM)
[18]. Ultimately, the final list of degenerated motifs consisted of 129 putative sets, i.e., 21 6-mers, 46 7-mers,
and 62 8-mers (this lists of motifs can be found in Additional File 1). Our tool can provide different representations for a motif: as the list of mutants, as a position
weight matrix (PWM), as a sequence logo or as a regular expression. This flexibility allows users to make an
informed decision about which particular sequence of a
motif to select in experimental validation.
We evaluated the performances of our method by
comparison with previously published work. We analyzed the distribution of our motifs within the P. falciparum genome, looking for positional biases relative to

enrichment in functional sets of genes built from gene
ontology and gene expression profiles information.
Comparison with previously proposed motifs

We compared our 129 candidate motifs with previously
validated motifs [6,17,19,20]. More specifically, we examined the ApiAP2 transcription factor binding motifs for
PF14_0633 (TGCATGCA) and PFF0200c (GTGCAC)
reported in [17], and the motif NGGTGCA associated
with the gene invasion cluster [6,20]. A position weight
matrix (PWM) was built for each of our motif sets and the
various occurrences of the previously published motifs
[17]. The Pearson coefficient of corresponding PWMs was
used as similarity metric. Results are summarized in Table
1. The top-scoring motif in our list had a similarity score
of 0.9969 with PFF0200c [17]. Another of the motifs in
our list matched the motif NGGTGCA [6] with a similarity score of 0.833. The most similar motif to PF14_0633 in
our list was TATGCAT with the similarity score of 0.704.
We further compared our list of 129 motif sets with the
full list of 50 candidate motifs reported in [6] and the 23
candidate motifs (positional matrices from [19]). The comparison was carried out by computing the Pearson coefficient between the corresponding PWM and reporting only

pairs that exceeded 0.75 similarity. We found that 30 of
our motif sets were highly similar to 23 of the motifs from
[6], and 35 of our motifs were similar to 19 of the motifs
from [19] (Figure 4). The fact that our list of motifs contains biologically validated motifs and that several motifs
are shared with previous studies validates the exclusive use
of chromatin structural change via FAIRE-seq for the discovery of TFBS in an eukaryotic genome.
Motifs vs. gene function

We analyzed the distribution of the motif sets identified by
our method within functionally relevant groups of genes.
We used (1) clusters of genes inferred from GO annotations, (2) 15 previously published functional clusters
derived from the analysis of mRNA profiles [21], and (3) a
view of the previous 15 clusters reduced to four gene
expression (GE) groups based on the morphological stage
at which genes are expressed (see [21] and the Methods
section). These GE groups were previously published [16]
and correspond to clusters of genes grouped according to
variations in FAIRE-seq within their promoters across
seven time points. In the following we generically refer to
any of these three sets above as a functional gene set. We
estimated motif enrichment within each functional gene
set using hypergeometric statistics.

For each motif in our list we calculated the HES in a
functional gene set by counting the number of occurrences of that motif within nucleosome-sized functional
windows. Statistically significant motifs were selected
using a randomized analysis. For each motif, 100 random gene clusters were generated and HES were computed for motifs within their functional windows. In
order to assess statistical significance, a z-score was calculated using the average and standard deviation of the
HES distribution for the random clusters of the same
size of the functional gene set. We considered a motif in
a functional gene set to be statistically significant if the
p-value associated with the HES and the p-value associated with the z-score were both lower than 0.01 (HES
> 2). Figure 5 show the z-scores of motif enrichment in
GO-based clusters, the gene expression-inferred 15
functional clusters from [21], and the related GE functional gene sets proposed by Ponts et al [16]. Observe
that motifs are either not found within a functional
gene set or many of them are found. Increasing the
length of the motif to 8 bp seems however to increase

the specificity of the motif repartition by comparison
with 6 and 7 bp-long motifs (Figure 5.A and 5.B). Here,
we are facing the usual trade-off sensitivity vs. specificity, shorter k-mers allowing to discover more degenerated motifs but generating more false positives than
longer ones with limited performances on motif variants. With regards to gene expression profiles-inferred
functional gene sets, motifs are abundantly found at
GEIV whereas none was observed for genes within GEII
(Figure 5.C). Similar results are observed when all 15
functional clusters are considered (Figure 5.D). GEIV
contains genes mostly involved in specialized stages of
the parasite, i.e., invasive, sexual, and mosquito stages.
GEII consists of genes mostly involved in the asexual
non-invasive forms of the parasite. The abundant presence of TFBS in GEIV gene promoters may reflect a
highly regulated pattern of gene expression in specialized stages of the parasite. In contrast, the scarcity of
motifs in the promoters of genes expressed during the
asexual non-invasive stages of the parasite is consistent
with the hypothesis of broad expression of genes

observations are in agreement with previous studies

showing (1) significant discrepancies between mRNA
levels and transcription rates [22], and (2) major regulatory mechanisms in the human malaria parasite are

chromatin dynamics [16] and post-transcriptional regulations (such as mRNA decay) [23]. In summary, the
enrichment analysis shows that the motifs identified by
our chromatin structural change analysis via FAIRE-seq
approach are likely to be biologically meaningful.
Positional bias of the motifs relative to TSS and the
predicted promoters

We conducted an analysis of positional bias relative to
the transcription start site (TSS) and the predicted promoters reported in [24-26]. We first obtained the list of
2084 annotated TSS and 1027 predicted promoters, the
latter given as a single genomic position. Then we calculated the number of occurrences of our motifs within a
2000 bp window centered at the TSS or the predicted
promoter. Figures 6.A and 6.B show the distribution of
positional occurrences of our motifs relative to TSS and
predicted promoters, respectively. For comparison purposes, we computed the distribution of expected positional occurrences for our motifs if they were uniformly
randomly distributed under an i.i.d. model (individual
nucleotide frequencies were directly inferred from the
P. falciparum genome composition). The observed probability density is shown in black and the expected in

purple. As a preliminary observation, the presence of
peaks in the observed probability density surrounding
aligned TSS and predicted promoters suggest that some
of our motifs have a strong positional bias relative to TSS
and predicted promoters. The same analysis was carried
out for the 50 candidate motifs proposed in [6] (Figures
6.C and 6.D) and the statistical significance of any positional bias was investigated as previously proposed [27].
Briefly, for each motif we computed the distribution of
its positional occurrences within 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30
bp-long sliding window (1) inside a region [-1000, -301]
upstream of the TSS or the predicted promoter (background) and (2) inside a [-300, +300] region centered at
the TSS or the predicted promoter. Using the positional
distribution of the motif in the background, we computed its p-value to test the null hypothesis that the
total number of occurrences of the motif inside a sliding
window of the region centered at TSS (or predicted promoter) follows the distribution of the motif’s occurrences inside a corresponding-size window in the
background. We considered the number of occurrences
of a motif inside a k-bases window (k = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
and 30) to be statistically significant if its p-value was at
most 0.01. Table 2 shows the percentage of our motifs

that showed statistically significant positional bias relative to TSS. For comparison, we also provide the same
analysis for the 50 motifs from [6] that showed statistically significant positional bias to TSS. Observe that the
percentage of motifs with positional bias towards TSS
are overall stronger for our motifs sets than for the set
proposed by Young et al. [6]. This positional preference
seems to be also stronger with regards to the predicted
promoters. These results indicate that using FAIRE-seq
profiles-based clustering for motif discovery could produce a more meaningful set of motifs than gene expression-based approaches.
Although the functional windows are chosen within
1000 bases upstream of the first codon independent of
the TSS positions, we investigated whether the strong
positional bias of our motifs relative to the TSS was influenced by the locations of the functional windows.
Regions with the highest variance of FAIRE-seq coverage
are expected to correlate with the position of the TSS,
due to the coupling between the patterns of nucleosome
occupancy and positioning preference of the transcription initiation complex. The positional distribution of the
centers of the functional windows relative to TSS confirmed this hypothesis (Figure 7). There are two factors
that contribute for the positional enrichment of motifs
with respect to the TSS: the locations of the functional
windows relative to TSS and the positions of the motif
within the functional windows.

Conclusion
The human malaria parasite has highly skewed nucleotide distribution (~80% of A+T) that together with the
fact that over 40% of all genes have no known function
makes in silico TFBS discovery challenging. Here we have
demonstrated that chromatin structure data can be used
in the context of an enumerative motif approach for successful in silico discovery of regulatory elements.
In our previous analysis of the dynamic chromatin
structure in the human malaria parasite [16] we observed
that FAIRE-seq coverage surrounding a validated TFBS
varies drastically throughout the erythrocytic cycle.
Another important observation was that most of the
genes had well-defined FAIRE-seq peaks within their

Page 9 of 14

promoters, and while the intensity of the peaks changed
across the time points, their locations relative to the start
codons remained unchanged. Given these observations,
we formulated the hypothesis that the most likely regions
containing TFBS are the windows within the promoters
with the highest variance in the FAIRE-seq coverage.
We tested this hypothesis by developing a new methodology for in silico motif discovery using FAIRE-seq coverage. Our approach resulted in the finding of 129 putative
motifs, including many of the motifs proposed by previous
studies [17,6,19,20]. Moreover, half of the motifs that we
propose are over-represented within particular functional
gene sets, especially genes involved in specialized stages of
the parasite such as its sexual or invasive form. Our motifs
also showed stronger positional bias relative to the promoter region compared to previously proposed set of motifs.
These putative motifs together with their associative target
clusters can serve as starting points in future research on
characterization of unannotated proteins and regulatory
mechanisms. In summary, our data confirm the importance of chromatin structural changes to regulate gene
expression in the human malaria parasite. Precise knowledge of gene regulation pathways in the human malaria
parasite will be essential for developing novel therapeutic
strategies.

Methods
FAIRE-seq read processing and functional window
selection

FAIRE-seq and alignment data were obtained from [16].
Using sequenced reads that align uniquely to the P. falciparum reference genome (downloaded from http://www.
plasmoDB.org, version 5.5), FAIRE-seq read coverages
were computed by extending the mapped reads up to 200
bases (i.e., the average size of the sequencing libraries) as
previously described [28]. The raw counts were then
added at each position of the genome, and normalized per
million of mapped reads and per percentage of area covered (see [16]). The functional window of a gene was identified in a 1000 bp-long region upstream of the start
codon was identified as follows. The average FAIRE-seq
coverage inside a sliding 146 bp-long (nucleosome size)
window was computed for each region and for each time

point. The window with the highest variance of average
FAIRE-seq coverage across the seven time points was
declared to be the functional window for that gene. The
seven average values of FAIRE-seq coverage in the functional windows were used to generate the initial k-means
clustering of the genes
k-means clustering of coverage profiles of the functional
windows

Clustering via k-means was performed using the FAIREseq coverage profiles in the functional windows of all protein-coding genes. Clustering was performed for k = 5, k =
10, k = 15, and k = 20. The k-means procedure for the
initial clustering by FAIRE-seq coverage was carried out
several times and always resulted in the same final assignment of genes to clusters. The underlying metric was
Euclidean. Patterns for putative TFBS were searched for,
using the clusters generated for each choice of k. The sets
of motifs for each k were compared using Tanimoto

distance and Pearson correlation coefficient. With a
threshold on the Tanimoto distance of 0.5 and Pearson
coefficient of 0.6, the sets of motifs according to various
values of k were very similar. The choice k = 15 seemed to
offer the best tradeoff between cluster size and the quality
of cluster separation (data not shown). We therefore
retained k = 15 in the rest of our analysis.
Motifs scoring using a hypergeometric probabilistic
model

All possible k-mers of length six to eight bases were
searched within the functional windows of each gene. Frequencies of each k-mer were then modelled according to a
hypergeometric distribution. For each cluster of genes, let
M be the set of all k-mers inside the functional windows
of the genes in the cluster. Let n denote the size of M and
y denote the number of occurrences of a k-mer m in M.
The frequency of each k-mer m of M was compared to its
frequency observed in the set S of all k-mers found within

Harris et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:601
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/601

1000 bp upstream of genes (which also includes the
defined functional windows). Let N denote the size of S
and r denote the number of occurrences of m in S. The
hypergeometric distribution was used to measure the
probability that the frequency of a given k-mer of M
would be observed if the input sequences would have been
selected randomly within the entire promoter regions
(1000 bp upstream of genes) rather than functional windows (see [29] for more details). For each k-mer m of M, a
hypergeometric p-value was defined as:
min(n,r)

P(N, r, n, y) =

r
i

i=y

N−r
n−i
N
n

The corresponding hypergeometric enrichment score
(HES) is then defined as:
HES = −log10 P(N, r, n, y)

The HES measures the statistical significance of a
motif m in the positive set M. The smaller is the hypergeometric p-value, the smaller is the probability that the
observed number of occurrences is due to random factors, and the higher is the HES.
Motif identification and representation

Given a k-mer t, let N(t,1) denote the one-mismatch
neighborhood of t, i.e., a k-mer s belongs to N(t,1) if the
number of mismatches between s and t is at most one.
Given any k-mer t in the set M, the k-mers in N(t,1)
were first sorted in decreasing order of their HES, and
then a dynamic programming algorithm was used to
select the set of k-mers in N(t,1) that maximized the
HES. The HES for a set of k-mers is calculated using
the formula in the previous section where r is the total
number of occurrences of all k-mers in the set S and y
is the total number of occurrences of all k-mers in the
set M (M and S are also defined above). The dynamic
programming algorithm works as follows. Let L be the
ordered list of k-mers from N(t,1) by decreasing order
of their HES. Each k-mer in L is considered one at a
time in that order starting with L[1].We use LN[i] to
denote a subset of top i k-mers in L whose overall HES
is maximized over all possible such subsets that include
the i th k-mer, where 1 ≤ i ≤ min{10, |L|}. Let MH[i]
denote the HES calculated over k-mers in LN[i]. The
recurrence relation for MH[i] is
MH[i] =

HES(L[1])
if i = 1
max{HES(L[i]), S[i]} if i > 1

Where S[i]=max1≤j<iHES(over all k-mers in LN[j] and
L[i]). Observe that LN[1] has only one k-mer, namely L

Page 11 of 14

[1]; hence, MH[1] is simply HES(L[1]), and our claim
that HES over k-mers in LN[1] is maximized for top
one k-mers is obviously true. To choose LN[i], we consider each LN[j] one at a time for all choices of 1≤j<i:
we calculate HES over previously chosen k-mers in LN
[j] together with L[i], and choose the k-mers in LN[j] ∪
L[i], whose HES is maximum over all choices for j.
Then we compare the resulted maximum HES with
HES of just one k-mer, namely L[i]: if HES(L[i]) is
greater, then the final choice for LN[i] is L[i], otherwise
LN[i] = LN[j]∪L[i]. Since LN[j] (for 1≤j<i) is a subset of
top j k-mers that maximizes HES over all such subsets
that include jth k-mer, our choice of LN[i] increases the
likelihood that it is a subset of top i k-mers that maximizes HES over all such subsets that include ith k-mer.
After the MH vector is calculated, the value of i corresponding to maxMH[i] is determined and the set of kmers in LN[i] becomes the mutant set of t. Observe that
when we compute HES over L[i]∪LN[j], only r and y are
affected in the formula for HES (both are increased).
While this algorithm does not guarantee to always find
the optimal subset of mutants with the lowest p-value, it
works very well in practice and significantly decreases
the computation time compared to the brute force
approach.
Each k-mer t in M was represented by this HES-maximal subset that is called the mutant set of t. Since in
practice the size of the mutant set is very small (less
than ten), we only considered the top ten k-mers with
the highest HES in N(t,1). To ensure that the selection
of motifs followed a probabilistic model without replacement, we did not consider motifs whose occurrences of
corresponding mutants overlapped each other.
For all identified motifs and their target gene clusters,
we applied a final pipeline of filtration steps described
next aimed at reducing the false positives.
Motif identification and target genes clustering

Occurences of each exact k-mer were counted inside the
1000 bp promoter windows. The probability of occurrence of each k-mer was calculated under an independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) model using individual
nucleotide frequencies inferred from the genome composition. For each group of genes obtained by k-means clustering based on FAIRE-seq information, we selected
potential k-mers for further analysis as follows. Given a
k-mer t in the set M of all k-mers found within functional
windows (see Motifs Scoring), first its one-mismatch
neighborhood N(t, 1) was computed. A k-mer t was
selected if (1) t occured in at least five distinct input
sequences in a given cluster and (2) the expected number
of distinct sequences in which any k-mer from N(t, 1)
occured was smaller than the actual number of distinct
sequences with k-mers from N(t, 1). Regarding the first

Harris et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:601
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/601

condition, we chose to require five distinct input
sequences because the smallest preliminary cluster was
33, and square root of 33 is approximately 5 [1]. The
expected number of occurrences and the expected number of distinct sequences were computed on the positive
set M of k-mers within the given sequences of a cluster
of genes. Let i be a k-mer from N(t,1), then the expected
number of occurrences of i in the positive set M is
µiocc = pi n , where pi is the probability of one occurrence
of i in the genome, and n is the total number of k-mers
in the positive set M. Then the expected number of distinct sequences containing i is
µiseq

=1−e

−µiocc

and the expected number of distinct sequences for a
motif t can be calculated as
µseq = G

µiseq ,
i∈N(t,1)

where G is the number of sequences in the positive
set M.
The first threshold on the minimum number of distinct
sequences in which k-mers from N(t,1) must occur has the
effect of filtering out motifs that have low probabilities of
being over-represented in the positive set M. The second
threshold filters out motifs that are abundant in the genome in general, and therefore an over-representation of
these motifs in the positive set M is more likely random.
Each identified potential motifs was then analyzed in the
context of their respective FAIRE-seq based preliminary
cluster. For each k-mer t, we found the subset of mutants
in N(t,1) that maximizes HES for t in the cluster. Then, we
identified all genes that had exact occurrences of the
mutants of t within the selected nucleosome-sized windows. These genes constituted a new expanded cluster for
which the set of mutants for t was recomputed. This final
set of mutants is a putative motif and the expanded cluster
is its target gene cluster. Since the only three validated
motifs for P. falciparum are of length 6 and 8 bases, we
restricted our analysis to motif lengths 6 to 8 bases.
Additional filtration steps

Since we calculated the HES based on the number of
mutant occurrences rather than over the number of distinct genes where each mutant occurs, additional filtration
steps are necessary to ensure that a high HES is not due to
multiple occurrences within a few genes of the cluster. We
required the number of distinct genes where the motif
occured to be close to the number of occurrences of the
motif in the target genes cluster. More specifically, we filtered out motifs whose ratio between the number of

Page 12 of 14

distinct genes where the motif occured and the number of
occurrences of the motif in the cluster was smaller than
0.8. Since the HES of a motif was calculated over
sequences of about 150 bp in length, we wanted the number of exact occurrences of mutants inside a single
sequence to be close to one. This threshold was used to
distinguish between motifs and tandem repeats. Finally,
we only considered motifs with HES in their target clusters greater than or equal to the average HES in the distribution of HES for all motifs of length 6 to 8 bases.
Phylogenetic conservation analysis

We used phylogenetic conservation information to filter
out non-conserved motifs that are likely to be false positives. Similarly to [6], we calculated HES for the putative
motifs in four orthologous species, namely P. berghei,
P. chabaudi, P. vivax and P. yoelii. For each putative
motif, we computed the HES for genes orthologous to
the genes in the motif’s target cluster within 1000 bp
upstream of the start codon. Motifs with a HES of at
least 2 (i.e., p-value of 0.01) in at least one of the four
orthologous species were kept for further analysis. To
avoid artificially high orthologous HES, we required the
ratio between the number of distinct genes where the
mutants occurred and the number of exact occurrences
of motifs in the set of orthologous genes corresponding
to the target cluster to be at least 0.5 (this threshold is
lower than in the previous step due to the increased
length of input sequences). This step ensured that HES
was supported with enough orthologous genes and that
all occurrences did not fall into the promoters of a few
genes.
To confirm that the statistical significance of our motifs
in their corresponding orthologous clusters are not due to
a random chance, we conducted an additional randomized
analysis. Particularly, we investigated the distribution of
HES calculated for our motifs in randomly chosen orthologous clusters. For each motif we calculated its HES in
100 randomly chosen orthologous clusters of the same
size that was used in our original analysis. Then we calculated the average and the standard deviation of HES over
the random clusters and used these values to find a new
threshold on the orthologous HES corresponding to a significance level of 0.01. A motif was kept for further analysis if it had orthologous HES of at least two and this HES
was higher than the threshold calculated over the random
orthologous clusters. This analysis ensures that orthologous HES is statistically significant for each motif and the
given cluster size.
Finally, we adjusted the orthologous p-values of each
final motif to correct for multiple testing. Our permutation test gives us the distribution of the orthologous HES
when the enrichment of a motif in an orthologous cluster

Harris et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:601
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/601

is solely due to a random chance. For each enriched
motif, we computed its HES in 1000 randomly-selected
orthologous clusters in the four orthologous species,
where the size of a random orthologous cluster was the
same as the size of the original orthologous target gene
cluster. Since the statistical significance test requires that
the orthologous HES must exceed the threshold in at
least one out of four species, we computed the HES in all
four species at each iteration, but used in the analysis
only the maximum score. In order to be able to compare
HES across different motifs (which might have different
cluster sizes), we normalized all HES (both for real and
random clusters) using their mean μHES and the standard
deviation s HES , calculated over 1000 random clusters.
The normalized HES is (HES -μHES)/sHES. The resulting
distribution of 1000N normalized HES (where N is 1587,
2471, and 2745 for 6-, 7-, and 8-mers respectively), was
used to correct for multiple testing, as follows. The normalized HES for both real and random clusters were
aggregated, then sorted in decreasing order. For each
final motif we calculated the p-value (corrected for multiple testing) as the proportion of the top values in this
joint distribution that are greater than or equal to the
real orthologous normalized HES of the motif [30]. Out
of the final 129 motifs reported previously, a total of 113
have adjusted p-values corresponding to a false discovery
rate of less than 5%. Additional File 1 contains the pvalues for all 129 motifs before and after correction for
multiple testing.
Motifs clustering

In order to account for sequence degeneration of motifs
we added a motif clustering step to filter out duplicates
and highly similar motifs. We selected unique motifs
with the highest HES and clustered the remaining putative motifs by similarity using the Tanimoto distance
[3,6] and Pearson correlation coefficients of their position weight matrices (PWMs) [18].
The Tanimoto distance measures pairwise similarity of
the motifs. Motifs with pairwise distances smaller than
0.5 were grouped, and the one with the highest HES
was selected to represent the group. In other words, if
two motifs shared at least half of their positions then
they belonged to the same group. Since our method
does not rely on co-regulated clusters, we assumed that
for a given motif not all genes in the target genes cluster
were co-regulated. That is why we allowed a lower
threshold for the Tanimoto distance by comparison with
the threshold of 0.8 used [3,6]. Given the positional
occurrences for two motifs represented in sets A and B
respectively, we defined two occurrences (one from A
and one from B) to be overlapping if they shared at
least one base. The Tanimoto distance was calculated as
follows

Page 13 of 14

1−

|A ∩ B|
|A ∪ B|

where the intersection of A and B includes all overlapping positional occurrences.
Then, motifs were clustered according to the Pearson
coefficients of their PWMs. This step filtered out motifs
that had very similar content, e.g., motifs that might be
shifted versions of each other. We define two motifs
shifted version if they shared at least half of a motif’s
length. We considered two motifs similar if the Pearson
coefficient between their corresponding PWMs or of the
PWMs built on their shifted versions was greater than
or equal to 0.75 [7,18]. To build PWMs for two motifs
that are shifted versions of each other, we first built a
PWM for the motif with the highest HES and then we
constructed a PWM for the other motif that we shifted
to align with the highest-HES-motif.
Gene orthology and gene functional sets

Orthologous gene maps between P. falciparum and P.
berghei, P. falciparum and P. chabaudi, P. falciparum
and P. vivax, and P. falciparum and P. yoelii were
obtained from the OrthoMCL database http://www.
orthomcl.org/]. A total of 1915 orthologous genes of P.
berghei, 1247 of P. chabaudi, 4126 of P. vivax, and 2685
of P. yoelii were used in this study.
In order to study the motifs enrichment in functional
gene sets, we used gene ontology (GO) functions from
P. falciparum v6.0 together with ontology-based pattern
identification (OPI) clusters from [http://carrier.gnf.org/
publications/OPI/] to retrieve a total of 13,859 GO/gene
pairs, with 1288 distinct GO names. As an alternative
for GO annotation, we used 15 functional clusters of
genes that were previously obtained based on mRNA
profiles [21]. These 15 clusters were used as is or
regrouped into four gene expression (GE) groups as follows. Gene expression group I (GEI) contains genes
expressed in sporozoites and gametocytes (clusters 1-3),
GEII contains genes corresponding to ring, schizont and
trophozoite stages (clusters 4-7), GEIII contains genes
expressed at the throphozoite stage (clusters 8-13) and
group GEIV contains genes expressed at sporozoite,
gametocyte and schizont stages and involved in red
blood cell invasion (clusters 14-15).
