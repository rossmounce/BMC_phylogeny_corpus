Abstract
Background: Canine distemper virus (CDV) is present worldwide and produces a lethal systemic infection of wild and
domestic Canidae. Pre-existing antibodies acquired from vaccination or previous CDV infection might interfere the
interpretation of a serologic diagnosis method. In addition, due to the high similarity of nucleic acid sequences
between wild-type CDV and the new vaccine strain, current PCR derived methods cannot be applied for the definite
confirmation of CD infection. Hence, it is worthy of developing a simple and rapid nucleotide-based assay for
differentiation of wild-type CDV which is a cause of disease from attenuated CDVs after vaccination. High frequency
variations have been found in the region spanning from the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the matrix (M) gene to the
fusion (F) gene (designated M-F UTR) in a few CDV strains. To establish a differential diagnosis assay, an amplification
refractory mutation analysis was established based on the highly variable region on M-F UTR and F regions.
Results: Sequences of frequent polymorphisms were found scattered throughout the M-F UTR region; the identity of
nucleic acid between local strains and vaccine strains ranged from 82.5% to 93.8%. A track of AAA residue located 35
nucleotides downstream from F gene start codon highly conserved in three vaccine strains were replaced with TGC in
the local strains; that severed as target sequences for deign of discrimination primers. The method established in the
present study successfully differentiated seven Taiwanese CDV field isolates, all belonging to the Asia-1 lineage, from
vaccine strains.
Conclusions: The method described herein would be useful for several clinical applications, such as confirmation of
nature CDV infection, evaluation of vaccination status and verification of the circulating viral genotypes.
Background
Canine distemper is a highly contagious disease caused
by canine distemper virus (CDV), which belongs to the
genus Morbillivirus of the family Paramyxoviridae.
Although CDV primarily infects canids, infection of
other terrestrial and aquatic carnivores has been reported
[1-7]. CDV infection causes a systemic disease with

The genome of CDV is approximately 15.7 kb in length
and consists of a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA
encoding the following eight viral proteins: two transcriptase-associated proteins (the phosphoprotein P and
the large protein L) and the nucleocapsid protein (N) that
encapsidates the viral RNA, a single envelope-associated
matrix (M) protein and two glycoproteins: haemagglutinin/attachment protein (H) and a fusion protein (F) [9].
The F protein is responsible for viral fusion with host

cells. The open reading frame of the F gene encodes 662
amino acids, which comprise a pre-signal peptide (Fsp),
the F1 subunit and the F2 subunit; the latter two subunits
are produced via post-translational proteolysis of the primary translation precursor product, designated pre-F0
[10,11].
CDVs worldwide could be clustered into six major
genetic lineages; America, European, Asia-1, Asia-2, Arctic, and Vaccine [12-16]. Over the last five decades, CDV
isolates from the latter lineage, such as Onderstepoort,
and Snyder Hill, were applied in vaccine production and
used as conventional distemper vaccines [17,18].
Recently, a new vaccine based on the contemporary vaccine strain (Vaccine X, GenBank: EU072198) has been
used for immunisation. Sequence analysis, however,
revealed that the contemporary strain used for Vaccine X
is genetically distinct from the other CDVs in the vaccine
lineage (used in conventional distemper vaccines).
Canine distemper is an incurable multisystemic viral
disease that causes respiratory signs, gastrointestinal disorders, and progressive neurological signs. Prevention of
CDV infection mainly relies on the use of live attenuated
vaccines. Current routine serological tests detecting
serum antibody titers are difficult to distinguish that animals have been vaccinated or late in infection as the modified live vaccines may result in a false positive in the first
few weeks after immunisation. This rise the difficulties
not only in the epidemic surveillance monitoring CDV
outbreaks in domestic and wild animals, but also in the
clinical diagnosis as a reference for treatment strategies,
either continuing therapy or euthanasia. Recently, several
molecular based assays have been established [12,15,1921] to definitively clarify CDV infection. These molecular
methods can only differentiate wild type and conventional vaccine strians. However, they are not able to identify the contemporary vaccine strain from the circulating
wild type CDVs and thus it is possible that dogs vaccinated with the contemporary vaccine could be regarded
as wild type CDV infection.
The goal of this study is to establish a simple and rapid
assay for differentiating CDV of natural infection from
that of vaccination which could be broadly adopted in
countries where both conventional and contemporary
distemper vaccines are commonly used in the vaccination
program. Our previous report showed that there was a
remarkable genetic diversity in the Fsp region among different CDV isolates [22], we further examined variation
of Fsp and its upstream non-coding region (M-F untranslated region; M-F UTR) between circulating wild-type
CDV and the vaccine strains in Taiwan. Toward this
objective, CDVs from local isolates and three commonly
used vaccines were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. In addition, based on the determined
divergent sequences, a multiplex ARMS-PCR system and

enzyme recognition profile for the F gene and its
upstream non-coding region were accordingly developed
and successfully applied to the differentiation of vaccine
strains and field isolates.

Results
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis

To determine the phylogenetic relationships among of
CDV field and vaccine strains, considering the limited
sequence information of F gene from other countries,
phylogenetic analysis of H gene was conducted to determine the lineage relationship of various CDV strains. Initially, full-length H gene sequences of the seven local
CDV were identified (GenBank: FJ705230 to FJ705239).
Consistent with our previous report [23], the local strains
originated from CDV-Asia-1 lineage. Furthermore,
unlike vacc-Q and Vacc-N (Onderstepoort strain), Vacc-P
was distinct, placed near strains of America (additional
file 1).
By means of PCR with primer set CDV-F/R (the location was illustrated in Fig 1), sequences of F gene plus the
upstream M-F intergenic region (nucleotides 4325-5325)
were identified from seven CDV confirmed cases (namely
TW1 to TW7) that were used to represent local strains
(Asia-1 lineage) and three most commonly used commercial vaccines in Taiwan. These sequences were submitted
to GenBank (GenBank: FJ694842 to FJ694848 for the
field isolates and FJ694849, FJ694850 and FJ694851 for
vaccines N, P and Q, respectively). Alignment of the
nucleotide sequences using Clustal W demonstrated that
the sequence identities among local isolates ranged from
96.8-100%, while those of the vaccine isolates were lower
at 86.2-96.3% (Table 1). Interestingly, the nucleotide
sequence identity could be as low as 82.5%, when local
and commercial vaccine isolates were compared (range,
82.5-93.8%). Additionally, since Vacc-P was genetically
distinct from other CDV vaccine strains, the lineages origin of Vacc-P strain is necessary to be clarified. Based on
the sequence alignment of full length F gene, Vacc-P has
its nucleotide identity as high as 99.3% when comparing
with Vaccine X strain (GenBank: EU072198) (Data not
shown), which clearly manifested that Vacc-P strain
might be derived from the contemporary CDV vaccine
strain as Vaccine X. These findings indicated that the
sequence variation of CDV circulating in Taiwan and the
currently used commercial vaccines is significant. Also,
the contemporary distemper vaccines, such as Vacc-P
and Vaccine X, are commonly used in Taiwan.
Phylogenetic analysis of these nucleotide sequences in
conjunction with CDV strains from other continents
available in the GenBank database was then carried out.
The phylogenetic tree, as shown in Fig. 2, demonstrated
that all local isolates formed a single clade, which was distant from the vaccine isolates and other field isolates

from America. Among the vaccine strains, Vacc-P, the
contemporary vaccine strain, was freestanding and
located between our local isolates and the CDV strains
isolated in America. This contrasted with Vacc-N and
Vacc-Q, which were clustered in the same group as the
Onderstepoort vaccine strain. A bootstrap value of 100
for this clade suggests a robust phylogenetic grouping.
Noticeably, the sequence variation events among the
local isolates and the commercial vaccines observed in
the M-F intergenic region and the pre-signal peptide
region of F gene were well scattered (Fig. 3A).

If these results are examined as a whole, all of the local
isolates were found to be closely related to strains belonging to the Asia-1 lineage, which is distant and phylogenetically distinct from the vaccine strains. Additionally, the
analysis of the three commercial vaccines indicated that
two out of the three seem to have originated from a common ancestor similar to other vaccine strains (Onderstepoort and Convac), while only Vacc-P strain has a closer
phylogenetic relationship with our local strains.

Figure 2 Phylogenetic analysis of various CDV strains based on
the nucleotide sequence of part of the F protein and the intergenic region between the M gene and the F gene (nucleotides
4325-5325). Only bootstrap values greater than 70 are shown and the
branch lengths are proportional to genetic distance.

Differentiation of the vaccine strains and the field CDV
isolates by Multiplex ARMS-PCR

Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR,
also called allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR, was originally designed for the detection of known sequence polymorphisms, such as point mutations [24]. Using just two
pairs of primers in a single PCR tube, this method can
simultaneously amplify both mutant and wild type alleles,
plus it allows for the amplification of an internal DNA
control. This technique has been applied to the genotyping, analysis of genetic disorders [25-27], and the diagnosis of several different virus infections [26,28,29]. The
discrimination of amplification mainly depends on the
mismatch nucleotide at the most 3'-terminus of primer
[24]. The allele-specific (or lineage-specific) priming of
the PCR process will only permit amplification to occur
when the most 3'-terminal nucleotide matches with its
target sequences (Fig 1).
Alignment of the sequences revealed the substitution of
three adenines at positions 530-532 in all three vaccine
strains; while the sequences at the same positions in the
local isolates are T/CGC (marked with square in Fig. 3A).

Interestingly, this T/CGC, located 35 nucleotide downstream from Fsp start codon, also can be observed in
other Asia-1 CDVs, including strains from Taiwan (49
strains) and China, published in GenBank database (Fig.
3B). This apparent variation allowed the design of a genotype-specific primer that would differentiate local strains
from the vaccine strains. With this in mind, in order to
increase the discrimination power, the last three nucleotides at the 3'-end of the forward F-wt and the reverse Rvacc primers were designed to specifically target this particular region of the wild type or field isolates, respectively. In addition, two universal outer primers, reverse Rwt and forward F-vacc were designed to act as primer
pairs for nested ARMS-PCR amplification (Fig. 1).
The region made up of nucleotides 4325-5325, which
corresponds to part of the M gene, the intergenic spacer
between the M and F genes and part of the F gene, was
initially synthesised from the cDNAs of the seven CDV
field isolates and the three commercial vaccines using the
primer set CDF-F and CDF-R. The resulting amplicons
were subsequently amplified using the two type specific
primers sets, F-vacc/R-vacc and F-wt/R-wt (Fig. 1). The
second-round PCR products represent the various
genetic clusters. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, all commercial
vaccine isolates were recognised by the primers F-vacc
and R-vacc and yielded products that were 590 bp in
length, while all seven local isolates yielded 300 bp-products when amplified by primers F-wt and R-wt.
Moreover, in order to further evaluate whether this
multiplex assay can be used to characterise vaccine
strains among the local strains, we performed PCR with
the two sets of primers and different combinations of
templates, such as one of the vaccine strains with or without the presence of a field isolate. The results consistently
produced the correct 590 bp and 300 bp PCR products
according to the templates present in the amplification
(Fig. 4B). No cross-reactivity between the heterotypic
primer pairs and the CDV strains was observed, this indicates that the multiplex ARMS-PCR is able to distinguish
local isolates from vaccine strains even in a mixed population.
Base on the sequence homogeneity in agreement with
the vaccine lineage, within the similar position of 590bpproduct in other CDV strains from GenBank, three adenosines (AAA) located 35 nucleotide downstream from
Fsp start codon, were observed in CDV isolates from
Asia-2, America, Europe lineages (Fig. 3B), indicating
that the forward F-vacc and reverse R-vacc primers,
designed to circumstantially target AAA motif (Fig 1), are
potentially able to amplify 590bp-products for recognition of these three CDV lineages. Thus, in order to specify these CDVs from vaccine strain, the further
genotyping assay is needed to develop.

analysis may be applied for further characterized the contemporary vaccine strain from other vaccine strains.

infection by multiplex ARMS-PCR. (A) Results of a multiplex PCR using the two primer pairs: F-vacc/R-vacc and F-wt/R-wt. As indicated by
the arrowheads, a 590 bp product corresponding to vaccine tempalte
was specifically amplified from cDNA of Vacc-P, Vacc-Q and Vacc-N
(lane 1 to 3); the 300 bp product was only amplified from the local
strains (lanes 4-10). Note: Bands with a higher molecular weight, indicated with an arrow, were products amplifed by the outer primer set,

the amplicons corresponding to a specific template, the vaccine
strains (590 bp) and the local strains (300 bp), can be differentiated. (C)
RFLP analysis of CDV vaccine strains. A unique BamH I recognition site
was found in Vacc-P and CDV isolates in America lineage, but not in
Vacc-N, Vacc-Q and other CDVs in Vaccine lineage. As shown in the
lower panel, digestion of Vacc-P PCR product with BamH I enzyme resulted in a smaller DNA fragment (~500 bp; lane 1), whereas DNA obtained from Vacc-Q and Vacc-N remained intact (590 bp; lane 2 and 3).

Genotyping of CDV vaccine strains by restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP)

Within 590 nucleotides, the recognition site of BamH I
was observed in contemporary vaccine, but not in CDVVaccine cluster. The RFLP analysis was performed to differentiate contemporary vaccine from other vaccine
strains. As expected, a smaller fragment of 504 bp was
detected from Vacc-P amplicon digested with BamH I,
whereas the other two vaccines remained undigested

Discussion
In this study, differential ARMS-PCR and RFLP genotyping system were established on the basis of the genetic
divergence spanning from the intergenic region of the M
and F genes to the Fsp region of F gene. The level of
genetic variation of the F gene between the vaccine and
circulating CDV strains in Taiwan was documented in
our previous study [22]. Here we showed that, in addition
to the F gene, low nucleotide similarity was found across
the intergenic region of the M and F genes between the
vaccine and field strains. Our results are consistent with a
previous report, in which the genetic divergence of the
M-F UTR was approximately two-fold higher than that of
the most divergent coding sequence of the H gene [30].
Interference due to the presence of pre-existing antibodies produced by vaccination or a previous infection
will affect the results of any serological diagnosis of CDV.
In order to reinforce the interpretation resulting from
serology based methods, the development of a method
that allows the diagnosis and differentiation of CDV
acquired by natural infection from that used for vaccination is worthwhile. Martella et al (2007) developed an RTPCR genotyping system based on the lineage-specific
nucleotide polymorphisms scattered over the H gene.
Their system was used to characterise the major CDV lineages; European, Asia-1, Asia-2, Arctic, and Vaccine
strains [12]. However, because of limitations in primer
design, this system was not able to amplify CDV belonging to the America cluster and vaccine X. Very recently,
another multiplex PCR assays was reported by Si et al
(2010); in which primers targeting H gene was designed
to distinguish field strains from China and strains from
vaccine cluster, i.e. Onderstepoort [21]. Likewise, Uema
et al (2005) reported that presence of EcoRV and Ssp I
enzyme recognition sites of H gene in Asia strains was
able to differentiate those without these sequences i.e.
vaccine strains [14]. However, within the same DNA fragment, the Ssp I site also found in Vacc-P and American
CDVs (Data not shown), indicating that this method was
not able to differentiate contemporary vaccine strains
from CDVs in Asia-1 and Asia-2 lineages. Therefore, the
PCR genotypic system and RFLP assay targeting on H
gene described previously will be jeopardized when the
vaccine derived from contemporary virus strain were
generally conducted.
In this study, the highly conserved TGC at positions
530-532 in pre-signal peptide (Fsp) of the local strains
(Fig. 3A) allowed us to design genotype specific primer
pairs to distinguish local CDV strains (Asia-1) from three
vaccines, including the contemporary strains (Fig. 1). As

Chulakasian et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:122

expected, the size difference between the vaccine specific
and field strain specific products provided a simple and
reliable method of identification and differentiation of
CDV (Fig. 4A), even when mixed templates from field
and vaccine strains were used (Fig. 4B). Although the
identity of the Fsp amino acid sequence, when the Taiwan
strains and vaccine strains are compared, was as low as
64-67% [22], surprisingly, an analysis of Fsp region in various CDV strains in GenBank database indicates that
TGC motif used to specifically target local isolates is
highly conserved among the Asia-1 lineage. These findings demonstrated that our assay will be able to reliably
differentiate field CDV (Asia-1 lineage, as tested in present study) from the two major lineages of conventional
vaccines, namely Vacc-N/Vacc-Q and contemporary vaccine, namely Vacc-P.
In addition to differential diagnosis of natural CDV
infection, the highly genetic variation of M-F UTR
throughout 590 nucleotides allowed us to design the
RFLP genotyping system based on the unique restriction
enzyme profile. In this region, the recognition site of
BamH I was observed in contemporary vaccine, America,
and Asia-2 clusters, but not in CDV-Vaccine cluster. Furthermore, the restriction patterns of enzyme Apo I and
Bgl I were different among contemporary vaccine, America and Asia-2 lineages (Table 2). Taking together, the
RFLP assay with these restriction enzymes could be
potentially used in for genotyping those CDV lineages
that will be useful for identification of CDV infection
acquired from other lineage and also for monitoring the
evolution of CDV viruses. Notwithstanding, due to the

limitation of clinical specimens from other geographic
areas, we was able to affirm the differentiation of circulating CDV-Asia1 strains from vaccines and contemporary
vaccine.

Conclusions
At present, control of CDV relies on immunisation with
vaccines, mostly live attenuated vaccines. A multiplex
ARMS-PCR assay developed in this study can be considered as a practical and robust tool for the rapid differentiation of current circulating CDV and vaccine strains
based on the sequence polymorphism in the F gene and
its upstream M-F UTR. When used clinically, this assay,
for the first time, is able to effectively identify the origin
of a CDV infection and, most importantly, confirm the
presence of a natural CDV infection.
Methods
Sample collection and preparation

Regardless of vaccination history, seven isolates of CDV
were obtained from dogs' nasal swabs with the clinical
suspicion of canine distemper provided by the Veterinary
Teaching Hospital of National Chung Hsing University
and by the Taichung City Animal Protection and Health
Inspection Center. Nasal swabs were homogenised in 1
ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then centrifuged at 8,000 g for 1 min. Supernatants were collected
and kept at -80Â°C for further experiments. In addition,
three live-attenuated commercial vaccines, Vacc-P, VaccN and Vacc-Q, all currently used in Taiwan, were also
included in this study.

Purification of the nucleic acid, reverse transcription and
amplification of F gene

Total nucleic acid was extracted from the supernatants of
swabs and vaccines using the RNeasy Mini 50 kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total
RNA (1 Î¼g) and random 8-mer primers (50 Î¼M) were
denatured at 65Â°C for 5 min and cooled down on ice. To
synthesise the first-strand cDNA, the RNA and primers
were mixed in 5 Ã reaction buffers, 0.1 M DDT, 0.5 mM
of each deoxynucleotide, 200 U SuperScript III reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 40 U RNase inhibitor. A
total of 20 Î¼L of the mixture was initially incubated at
25Â°C, then the reaction was held at 65Â°C for 60 min and
finally it was terminated by incubation at 70Â°C for 10 min.
Following this, the first round amplification was conducted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the
outer primers CDF-F: 5'-AGAGTGCAAAATAGTAAGAATCCAAGC-3' and CDF-R: 5'-GAAAGAGACTGGCTATTCCGATGC-3', which amplified a fragment
containing the M gene (115 downstream nucleotides;
4325-4439), M-F UTR (495 nucleotides; 4440-4934) and
the F gene (first 391 nucleotides; 4935-5325) (Fig. 1).
Thermocycling conditions for amplification started with
an initial denaturation at 95Â°C for 5 min and then the
reaction mixture was subjected to 35 cycles of heat denaturation at 95Â°C for 1 min, primer annealing at 55Â°C for 2
min, DNA extension at 72Â°C for 2 min; this was followed
by a final extension at 72Â°C for 7 min. The identity of the
resulting PCR products was verified by direct automated
sequencing.
The Multiplex ARMS-PCR assay

The F gene products from the first round PCR were then
further simultaneously amplified by multiplex ARMSPCR using two primer sets in order to distinguish the
vaccine and field strains. The specific primer sets, namely
F-wt and R-vacc, were designed according to the different
sequences obtained and specifically targeted either the
field isolates or the vaccine strains (Fig. 1). The primers
used for vaccine strain amplification were F-vacc: 5'CATCAGCCATGATCAGGGTCTTTTC-3' and R-vacc:
5'-GGGCGGTCTTGTTGGGTATGTGTTT-3'.
The
primers used for field strain amplification were F-wt: 5'AATTCCCAAAAAATCCAAACCCTGC-3' and R-wt:
5'-GATTGCCGCCTCTTGAACCAGGAA-3'.
The
amplification conditions for the multiplex-nested ARMSPCR were 95Â°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95Â°C for 1 min, annealing at 55Â°C for 2 min,
DNA extension at 72Â°C for 2 min and a final extension at
72Â°C for 7 min. All amplification cycles were performed
in a DNA thermal cycle (GeneAmp PCR system 2700).
The PCR products were resolved by 1.2% agarose gel
electrophoresis with Health safe nucleic acid stain. Product sizes were determined with reference to a 100 base
pair (bp) DNA Ladder.

Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis

For genotyping, the PCR product amplified with primers
F-vacc and R-vacc was isolated by using the Purelinkâ¢
PCR purification kit (Invitrogen), and resulting product
was further digested with restriction enzyme BamH I
(New England Biolabs). A 4 ml-aliquot was digested with
1.5 U of BamH I at 37Â°C for 90 min according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The resulting restriction
fragments were resolved by 1.2% Tris acetate-EDTA-agarose gel electrophoresis.
Phylogenetic analysis

Several CDV strains were selected for phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide sequence accession numbers in the
GenBank database for the F gene and its upstream region,
M-F UTR, sequences of the reference strains used in this
study are: A75/17-USA (GenBank: AF164967), Raccoon
00-2601-USA (GenBank: AY443350), Raccoon 00-2689USA (GenBank: AY649446), Raccoon 98-2646 (GenBank:
AY542312), Raccoon 98-2654 (GenBank: AY466011),
Raccoon 98-2645 (GenBank: AY445077) and Onderstepoort (GenBank: AF305419).
Nucleotide sequences corresponding to the CDV F and
H genes were aligned using the CLUSTAL W multiple
alignment method with BioEdit software [31] and compared with other previously published sequences
reported in GenBank. The phylogeny of the nucleotide
and amino acid alignments were analysed using distance
matrix methods (DNADIST for nucleotide sequence and
PROTDIST for amino acid sequence, followed by
NEIGHBOR) using the PHYLIP software package [32].
The datasets were subjected to bootstrap analysis based
on 1,000 re-samplings of the original data and the SEQBOOT program was used to produce a majority-rule
consensus tree.
