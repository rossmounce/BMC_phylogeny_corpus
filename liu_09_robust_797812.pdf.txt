Abstract
Background: To address the limitations of traditional virus and pathogen detection
methodologies in clinical diagnosis, scientists have developed high-throughput oligonucleotide
microarrays to rapidly identify infectious agents. However, objectively identifying pathogens from
the complex hybridization patterns of these massively multiplexed arrays remains challenging.
Methods: In this study, we conceived an automated method based on the hypergeometric
distribution for identifying pathogens in multiplexed arrays and compared it to five other methods.
We evaluated these metrics: 1) accurate prediction, whether the top ranked prediction(s) match
the real virus(es); 2) four accuracy scores.
Results: Though accurate prediction and high specificity and sensitivity can be achieved with
several methods, the method based on hypergeometric distribution provides a significant advantage
in term of positive predicting value with two to sixty folds the positive predicting values of other
methods.
Conclusion: The proposed multi-specie array analysis based on the hypergeometric distribution
addresses shortcomings of previous methods by enhancing signals of positively hybridized probes.

Background
Since their inception in the early nineties [1], microarrays
have become widely used in research and are increasingly
translating to clinical practice because of their low cost
and high-throughput analysis of gene expression [2,3].
Indeed, expression analysis arrays have been employed to

predict clinical survival [4], calculate prognosis indexes
and determine molecular signatures [5,6]. SNP arrays [7]
are being used to study allelic variants of disease [8]. Similarly, Comparative Genomic Hybridization arrays have
been employed extensively in investigating cancer tumors
[9,10]. Assuming oligo arrays can achieve high sensitivity

and specificity, their application for diagnosis of an infectious agent is valuable for the following reasons: (i) the
increase need for multiplexing to monitor in emerging
zoonoses, (ii) rapid, unbiased, and cost effective detection
of infectious diseases. Indeed, the state of the art in viral
diagnosis is based on the antibody response and may take
up to two weeks to be detected in the blood. In contrast,
Oligonucleotide arrays measure the viral RNA and allows
for early detection within hours. Additionally, a large
number of acute viral infections share common clinical
signs and symptoms. Furthermore, clinicians currently
have to ponder the additional cost and benefits of investigating infrequent infectious for which the hospital is not
equipped to assay and require significant time and effort
to elucidate.
Researchers have thus developed pan-viral and panmicrobial oligonucleotide arrays [11-14] for use with clinical specimens. Among them, the GreeneChip is currently
the most comprehensive multiplex array for detection
infectious agents, comprising about 30,000 probes
designed to detect 1710 vertebrate viruses, 135 bacteria,
73 fungal and 63 parasite genera [13]. 2007 marked the
year of an important proof-of-concept: two documented
case reports of multiplexed arrays detecting an infectious
agent when traditional methods of investigation had
failed (GreeneChip [13], and ViroChip [15]).
Analyzing accurately the data from the hybridization patterns from these arrays is of utmost clinical importance
and remains challenging for the following reasons: (i)
species' strains are represented by multiple probes targeted in distinct genes for increased precision, (ii) thresholds where an array probe can be considered positive or
negative are somewhat arbitrary, and (iii) non specific
cross-hybridization patterns can lead to false positive
rates, (iv) detention of microbes must allow for identifying multiple co-infections (e.g. a simple prioritization of
infectious agents is of limited value). Initially, previous
studies addressed this issue by comparing the total count
of hybridized probes with probe sets designed for different agents to identify the correct agent(s), but this
approach was found limited in precision [11,12].
Recently, more comprehensive methods for interpreting
the hybridization patterns have been developed: (i) an
energy-profile based prediction program, which requires a
training microarray set to train the program first [16]; (ii)
a Log-transformed analysis of microarrays using p-values
(GreeneLAMP) [13]; and (iii) high-density resequencing
microarray using much longer length probes [17].
In this study, we provide a description and an evaluation
of a statistical method we developed to accurately predict
the species on a pan-virual oligonucleotide arrays.

Results and discussion
In this study, we evaluated six different methods over a
pan-virus array (a version of the GreeneChip array [13])
designed to detect 1,710 vertebrate viruses. Although we
attempted to include other methods [16,17] in the evaluation, we found several to be non-applicable to oligonucleotide microarrays [17] or impractical to implement
(requiring a training dataset derived from the same DNA
amplification method as the sample data) [16]. Figure 1
illustrates the distribution of the probes on the chip to
each of the virus species. Some viruses such as HIV and
influenza are significantly more heavily sequenced. As a
result, more probes on the chip are designed to these species to cover different mutations on their DNA sequences.
On the other hand, some viruses contain limited sequence
information, sometimes only a partial single genomic
sequence is available and are thus represented by a limited
number of probes.
Each method was applied to the hybridization results
composed of four West Nile virus samples. As described in
the methods, three different pools of probes were selected
based on the rank of the intensity of hybridizing probes,
representing 0.5%, 1%, and 5% of the total probes on the
chip. The virus species predicted by these methods were
ranked and compared with the correct virus tested on the
chip. The ranks are listed on the Supplementary T 2 http:/

Distribution of the number of probes per species in
the GreeneChip. Since the design of the array is based on
viral strains, we design many strain specific probes in human
viruses (e.g. HIV, Influenza). Indeed, Genbank often contains
multiple entries of fully sequenced genomes for human
viruses strains allowing for straightforward calculation of
conservation and specificity. In contrast, some other vertebrate viruses may have as little as a single Gnebank entry and
perhaps an incomplete genome. In the latter case, probes
were designed using principles of phylogenetic protein
domain conservation [24].

/phenos.bsd.uchicago.edu/amia2008/. According to the
ranks derived by these methods, the hypergeometric
method performs the best out of the six methods and the
LTRM method is only slightly behind in identifying the
correct agent.
To illustrate the cutoffs of top probes in intensity at the
0.5%, 1% and 5% thresholds, we plot the distribution of
the intensity of hybridized probes of a chip tested against
West Nile virus chip 1 (Figure 2). The dots highlighted in
red denote the probes that are designed to hybridize to the
West Nile virus. Though some probes designed for the
West Nile virus have the highest intensity level, some are
not hybridized to the virus DNA at all. It also demonstrates that there is a certain level of cross hybridization
(denoted by the blue dots). The p-values calculated using
the hypergeometric method are also shown. In our preliminary results over other assays (data not shown) and in
the presented assay (Tables 1 and 2), the sensitivity
(recall) of every method was comparable, and specificity
was high, however the LTRM had significantly better positive predicting values than all methods, with the exception of the proposed hypergeometric method
outperforming the LTRM. Though other approaches can
also identify the correct agent though a ranking system,
the hypergeometric method is able to significantly
enhance the hybridization signal of target agents and
reduce the noise due to cross-hybridization.
We also combined the hybridization results from chip
pairs to improve predictive accuracy. Results are shown in
Supplementary T 3 http://phenos.bsd.uchicago.edu/
amia2008/. Comparing the ranking and accuracy scores
between the single chips and the grouped chips (Table 1
and 2), the accuracy scores for the paired chips show

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S2/S11

improvement over those than those of the single chips,
especially in terms of positive predicting values. For example, the LTRM method has an increase in the positive predicting value from 39.1% to 59.7%. Overall, comparing
both their ranking and accuracy scores (sensitivity and
positive predicting value), the hypergeometric method
performs better at the predicting positive value and is better or equivalent to other methods on other accuracy
scores. Its positive predicting value is approximately 2~60
fold better than those of the other methods.
Limitations
While the simple probe count method can, in principle,
detect species with as few as one probe, the cost of confirming the predictions likely to become prohibitive due
to the large number of false positives. This is demonstrated in Supplementary T 2 http://phenos.bsd.uchi
cago.edu/amia2008/ where selecting the 50 topmost
hybridized probes may lead to dozens of false positive
predicted species, and the number of false positive predictions rapidly increases with the number of probes considered. In addition, viruses with close phylogeny could also
cause problems due to cross-hybridization on the chip,
substantially confounding the detection process.
Future studies
The LTRM method which also outperformed most methods is based on the log transform of expression level,
while our method is based on the direct ranking of the
expression levels. There is a theoretical advantage to pool
the two methods together in repeated essays where the log
normalization associated with the error rate could
together better rank the significant probe sets than the
expression level alone. We are currently exploring the
joint use of the log transform and the hypergeometric distribution. The methods outlined in this study are focused
on using probe-level hybridization to determine the significance of each detectable, however future studies
should also address the gene level (orthologos, paralogs).
Indeed, cross-hybridization of probes designed for the
same genes in different strains or for orthologs in different
species, could cross-hybridize when mutations affect the
region in a given strain of virus even if the probes were
originally designed with sufficient differences in the
sequence of nucleic acid base pairs. As data becomes publicly available, we will establish the scalability of our
method to these arrays as well.

Our results show that, for the prediction of pathogens,
high specificity and sensitivity can be achieved with a
broad range of analytical methods. Only two prediction
methods correctly ranked the tested pathogen in all tests,
the hypergeometric and the LTRM method. To our knowledge, we conducted the first hypergeometric model of

probe hybridization for interpretation of arrays with multiplexed species-probes. It differs conceptually of every
other method because it provides an adjusted p-value
below which no predictions are made. In contrast, previous methods do not provide an objective threshold in
their stratification of species, and such threshold is established arbitrarily, leading to poor positive predicting
value. As hypothesized, the method based on the hypergeometric distribution provides a significant advantage in
terms of positive predicting value. When experiments are
repeated with the same sample on additional arrays, the
method also performs significantly better than the other
methods. Beyond oligonucleotide arrays, the hypergeometric-based method is scalable and could be applied to
other or newly developed multiplexed technologies for
characterizing pathogens.

Methods
We conducted analyses on the virus-only version of the
pan-microbial GeeneChip that we co-developed with Dr.
WI Lipkin's research group and collaborators [[13,24],
Supplementary File 1 at http://phenos.bsd.uchicago.edu/
amia2008/]. Array probes for each species's strains were
computed based on principles of genetic essentiality (e.g.
polymerases for viruses replication) and of conservation
(e.g. protein domains conserved across related species for
strains with few or only one genomic sequence available).
The pan-virus chip contains a total of 9,045 60 mer probes

of conserved sequences covering 1,710 vertebrate virus
targets derived from an integrated DNA sequence data
from 4 genomic databases, including (i) NCBI taxonomy
data [18], (ii) Pfam database [19], (iii) Uniprot [20], and
(iv) GenBank DNA sequences [21] (see Supplementary
materials for more details http://phenos.bsd.uchi
cago.edu/amia2008/). Extensive preliminary evaluations
were conducted on assays derived from infected cell cultures [data not shown]. The described evaluations are
based on four independent tests on hybridization results
from samples infected by the West Nile virus (Strain
NY99) (4 repeats).
We apply six different methods to analyze the array
hybridization patterns and calculate and compare their
accuracies in detecting the correct virus DNA present in
the hybridized sample. We evaluate each method assuming three different thresholds to identified positively
hybridized (significant) probes. Each of the three significance levels is based on relative expression level ranking:
(i) 50 probes (~0.5% of total probes, ~5–6 standard deviations (SD) from the mean probe intensity), (ii) 100
probes (~1% of total, ~3–4 SD), and (iii) 500 probes
(~5% of total, ~2 SD). The methods used for species identification are:

1) Probe count: A species is considered positive if any of
its probes were top positive probes. The predicted virus
species are ranked by the count of positive probes.
2) Probe count with threshold: This is the same as the
probe count method, with the exception that species that
have less than 3 significantly hybridized probes are
ignored.
3) Probe ratio: The probe ratio is calculated by dividing
the number of significantly hybridized by total number of
probes for each species. Species are considered positive if
the ratio of mapped probes in a species is more than 30%.
The predicted viruses are ranked by their ratios.
4) Probe ratio with threshold: This is the same as the
probe ratio method, with the exception that species that
have less than 3 significantly hybridized probes are
ignored.
5) Log Transform Ranking Method (LTRM): We followed
the GreenesLAMP procedure [13].
6) Hypergeometric distribution: The adjusted p value of
each given species was derived. Species with a corrected pvalue < 5% are considered potentially present in the specimen and ranked. The hypergeometric distribution function is described in Equation 1 [22]

hybridized was predicted and ranked, regardless of the
rank (note that in this series of experiments, only one species was known to be present). A false positive score is calculated by counting the number of species predicted and
ranked but not known to be present in the well characterized specimen. True negative and false negative scores are
also calculated at the species level, including: sensitivity
(recall), positive predicting value (precision), specificity,
and negative predicting value.
While a single array might be sufficient for screening; in
the presence of a severe illness of patients it is likely that a
biological sample would be assayed on multiple arrays in
order to increase the accuracy of the diagnostic. Consequently, we evaluated the accuracy of the all the methods
both as a single assay (Table 1) and also by pooling arrays
together two-by-two (union of significant probes): (i)
West Nile virus chips 1 and 2; (ii) West Nile virus chips 3
and 4 (Table 2). Accuracy scores were then calculated for
each group following the same procedure described
above. The 50,100 and 500 probes were selected from
each chip and the common top probes in each group were
identified.
Experiments were conducted over Sun Solaris Server and
took less than a minute to compute. Methods were implemented in Perl and are available upon request.
