The mitochondrial genome sequence of the
ciliate Paramecium caudatum reveals a shift
in nucleotide composition and codon usage
within the genus Paramecium
Dana Barth1 and Thomas U Berendonk1,2*

Abstract
Background: Despite the fact that the organization of the ciliate mitochondrial genome is exceptional, only few
ciliate mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced until today. All ciliate mitochondrial genomes are linear. They
are 40 kb to 47 kb long and contain some 50 tightly packed genes without introns. Earlier studies documented that
the mitochondrial guanine + cytosine contents are very different between Paramecium tetraurelia and all studied
Tetrahymena species. This raises the question of whether the high mitochondrial G+C content observed in P.
tetraurelia is a characteristic property of Paramecium mtDNA, or whether it is an exception of the ciliate
mitochondrial genomes known so far. To test this question, we determined the mitochondrial genome sequence of
Paramecium caudatum and compared the gene content and sequence properties to the closely related P. tetraurelia.
Results: The guanine + cytosine content of the P. caudatum mitochondrial genome was significantly lower than
that of P. tetraurelia (22.4% vs. 41.2%). This difference in the mitochondrial nucleotide composition was
accompanied by significantly different codon usage patterns in both species, i.e. within P. caudatum clearly A/T
ending codons dominated, whereas for P. tetraurelia the synonymous codons were more balanced with a higher
number of G/C ending codons. Further analyses indicated that the nucleotide composition of most members of
the genus Paramecium resembles that of P. caudatum and that the shift observed in P. tetraurelia is restricted to
the P. aurelia species complex.
Conclusions: Surprisingly, the codon usage bias in the P. caudatum mitochondrial genome, exemplified by the
effective number of codons, is more similar to the distantly related T. pyriformis and other single-celled eukaryotes
such as Chlamydomonas, than to the closely related P. tetraurelia. These differences in base composition and codon
usage bias were, however, not reflected in the amino acid composition. Most probably, the observed picture is best
explained by a hitherto unknown (neutral or adaptive) mechanism that increased the guanine + cytosine content in
P. tetraurelia mtDNA on the one hand, and strong purifying selection on the ancestral amino acid composition on
the other hand. These contradicting forces are counterbalanced by a considerably altered codon usage pattern.

Background
The genomic information and evolution of the mitochondrial genomes of metazoans is well documented.
Knowledge on the evolution of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) in single-celled organisms on the other hand
is more scarce. In order to promote the understaning of

the mitochondrial genome evolution of single-celled
eukaryotes, it is necessary to fill the large existing gaps
of knowledge and data. For example only few ciliate
mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced until
today, most of them belonging to the genus Tetrahymena: T. pyriformis [1], T. thermophila [2], T. pigmentosa, T. malacensis, T. paravorax [3]. While the newest
sequence belongs to Euplotes minuta [4], P. tetraurelia
has been among the first unicellular eukaryotes, for
which the complete mitochondrial genome sequence

was determined [5]. Therefore, to fill in one of the
above mentioned gaps, we decided to sequence the
mitochondrial genome of P. caudatum, a close relative
of the P. aurelia species complex, in order to elucidate
the mitochondrial genome evolution within this important ciliate genus.
Two interesting aspects of ciliate mtDNA are predominant and have made the assembly of mitochondrial
genomes difficult. First, all hitherto known ciliate mitochondrial genomes are linear, from 40 kb (P. tetraurelia)
to 47 kb (Tetrahymena) long, and contain some 50
tightly packed genes without introns. Second, for about
half of the open reading frames (ORFs) in the ciliate
mtDNA, a definite protein function is unknown, because
there is not enough similarity to known proteins in
other organisms [1,2]. Among these ORFs, ymf77 in the
Tetrahymena mtDNA is particularly unusual. This gene
is ~1,350 amino acid residues long, shows extreme
sequence divergence among Tetrahymena species and
has no homolog in the P. tetraurelia or Euplotes mitochondrial genomes.
Paramecium and Tetrahymena belong to the class
Oligohymenophorea, one out of eleven lineages within
the phylum Ciliophora. Despite similarities in gene content and genome organization in P. tetraurelia and Tetrahymena mtDNA, there are great differences in the
nucleotide composition. All studied Tetrahymena mitochondrial genomes have a guanine and cytosine (G+C)
content of ~20%, whereas in P. tetraurelia, the G+C
content is more than twice as high (c. 41%, [1]). Paramecium tetraurelia and T. thermophila are model
organisms, whose macronuclear genome sequences have
been recently completed [6,7]. Interestingly, the nuclear
G+C contents are not significantly different in both species (69.9% vs. 72.3%, [8]). This raises the question of
whether the high mitochondrial G+C content observed
in P. tetraurelia is a characteristic property of Paramecium mtDNA, or an exception of the ciliate mitochondrial genomes known so far.
To test this question, we determined the mitochondrial genome sequence of P. caudatum and compared
its gene content and sequence properties to the closely
related P. tetraurelia.

Results
General characterization

The mitochondrial genome of Paramecium caudatum
has been described as a linear molecule of 40-44 kb [9].
We determined 43,660 bp of the genome sequence
[GenBank:FN424190], excluding only the terminal
repeat regions that usually flank the linear ciliate
mtDNA. The overall nucleotide composition was 9.9%
G, 42.7% A, 34.9% T, and 12.5% C, the G+C content
thereby being significantly lower than that of P.

tetraurelia mtDNA (22.4% vs. 41.2%). The coding part
of the genome was 41,091 bp (94.1%), the protein-coding part 36,585 bp (83.8%) in length. We determined 25
protein-coding genes with known function, 17 additional
ORFs with unknown function, the small and large subunits of the ribosomal RNA genes and three transfer
RNA genes (Figure 1). Genes in the P. caudatum mitochondrial genome were densely packed, with short intergenic spacers (0-85 bp). However, the intergenic regions
adjacent to the cox1 and cob genes were considerably
longer (up to 503 bp; Figure 1). An overview of all protein-coding genes and a comparison with the P. tetraurelia mtDNA is given in Table 1.
The amino acid sequences of genes with known function were more similar between Paramecium species
than sequences of the putative ORFs, with atp9 and
nad10 being the most conserved genes (Table 1). The
ratio of nonsynonymous vs. synonymous substitutions
(Ka/Ks) also differed, with Ka/Ks values being significantly higher in putative ORFs than in known genes
(Mann-Whitney-U-test z = -3.30; p < 0.001; mean values
of 0.203 and 0.080, respectively). An exception was the
rpl2 gene, which possessed the highest Ka/Ks value
among all protein-coding genes in Paramecium mtDNA,
although it was still well within the range indicative for
purifying selection (Table 1).
Nucleotide composition and codon usage

Nucleotide composition and codon usage of the newly
determined P. caudatum mitochondrial genome were
compared to the previously published mitochondrial
genomes of P. tetraurelia [GenBank:NC001324] and T.
pyriformis [GenBank:NC000862]. In P. caudatum, the G
+C content of the protein-coding genes was similar to
the G+C content of T. pyriformis (21.7% and 20.2%,
respectively), but much lower than that of P. tetraurelia
(43.2%). This difference was even more pronounced at
3rd codon positions, with 56.5% G or C ending codons
in P. tetraurelia and only 12.8% and 11.9% G or C ending codons in P. caudatum and T. pyriformis, respectively. The G+C content of the noncoding regions
(intergenic spacers) was slightly lower compared to protein-coding genes in all species, but the relative differences between species were similar (Table 2). In the
mitochondrial rRNA genes, on the other hand, the G+C
content differed only slightly among the ciliates (Table
2).
In order to gain further insight into the nucleotide
composition of the Paramecium mtDNA, we sequenced
a 776 bp fragment of the Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1
gene (cox1) from 13 more Paramecium species. A phylogenetic tree of Paramecium based on sequences of the
cox1 gene is shown in Figure 2B. The analysis of the
nucleotide composition at 3 rd codon positions of the

cox1 gene revealed high G+C values (45-50%) in species
of the P. aurelia complex and a low G+C content (317%) in the remaining paramecia (Figure 2A).
The codon usage bias (CUB) differed significantly
between P. caudatum and P. tetraurelia (Table 3). Only
in one out of 19 amino acids (Phe) the same codon
(TTT) was the most frequently used synonymous codon
in P. caudatum and P. tetraurelia, whereas P. caudatum
and T. pyriformis shared the most frequently used
codon in 16 amino acids. The type of preferred codons
was related to the nucleotide composition of the respective species (Table 2, 3). Generally, for P. caudatum and
T. pyriformis A/T ending synonymous codons were
abundant. This was also true for the stop codons, as
only TAA was detected to terminate protein-coding
genes in P. caudatum and Tetrahymena, whereas TAG
never occurred (Table 3). In P. tetraurelia mtDNA, on
the other hand, the codon usage was shifted against G/
C ending codons. Only in two amino acids (Phe and
Trp) the most frequent synonymous codon ended in A
or T (and these are the termination codons). Furthermore, both the number of rare codons and the effective
number of codons (Nc) indicate a more balanced usage
of synonymous codons in P. tetraurelia compared to the
other ciliates (Table 3). A higher Nc in P. tetraurelia
was found for all protein-coding genes and putative
ORFs, except nad9 (additional file 1 Table S1).
Gene content and gene order

Gene composition, gene order and transcriptional orientation were essentially the same as in P. tetraurelia

[1,5]. Most of the few observed differences between P.
caudatum and P. tetraurelia could be attributed to
sequencing or annotation errors in the P. tetraurelia
mtDNA. For example, the small gene rps19 was not
described in P. tetraurelia neither in the original publication nor in the re-annotation paper [1,5]. We determined rps19 in the newly sequenced P. caudatum
mitochondrial genome as well as in P. tetraurelia at the
same relative position (between rps3 and rpl2) where it
is located in all Tetrahymena species [2,3]. The mitochondrial genome of P. caudatum contained one ORF
(ymf87) that was not present in P. tetraurelia (Figure 1).
Furthermore, we determined five ORFs in P. caudatum,
each of which seems to be equivalent to two adjacent
ORFs in P. tetraurelia. Four of these ORFs (ymf65,
ymf66, ymf67 and ymf76) are also present in Tetrahymena mtDNA [1]. The fifth ORF refers to the heme
maturase gene (yejR), which was much larger than P.
tetraurelia yejR (447 vs. 255 aa), but similar to Tetrahymena (512-522 aa) and Euplotes minuta yejR (461 aa)
[1-4]. In P. tetraurelia, ymf82 is located directly downstream to the yejR gene [1]. In P. caudatum, however,
ymf82 was not present at this position or anywhere else
in the mitochondrial genome (Figure 1). These results
could indicate sequencing errors in the P. tetraurelia
mitochondrial genome, which led to several frameshifts
and premature stopcodons in the annotated sequence.
The most striking difference compared to P. tetraurelia was ymf64, a large open reading frame of 5,136 bp
length (Figure 1). The C-terminal part of this ORF
showed significant similarity to ymf64 of P. tetraurelia

outside of the membrane. BLAST searches of this extension detected no sequence similarity with any known
sequence in GenBank.
Besides its size, ymf64 possessed another unusual feature: an intragenic minisatellite, composed of nine
repeat units of 18 bp close to the middle of the ORF.
We amplified and sequenced this gene region from 20
further P. caudatum strains and found the repeat number to be highly variable, even between strains sharing
the same cox1 haplotype (Figure 3). We identified 12
length variants with repeat numbers ranging from six to
23 units. No length polymorphism (heteroplasmy) was
detected within individual P. caudatum strains. The
repeat was imperfect as we found differences (substitutions) between the repeat units within one sequence as
well as variations between different strains. However,
these sequence variations never led to nonsense mutations. Since the repeat unit size was a multiple of three

Discussion
Codon usage

Closely related species usually show similar nucleotide
composition and codon usage patterns. For example,
five Tetrahymena species possess very similar mitochondrial G+C contents (18.5% - 21.3%; [3]), whereas T. pyriformis, P. tetraurelia and E. minuta differ significantly in
this respect (21.7%, 41.9% and 36.0%, respectively; [1,4]).
Therefore, it was unexpected that nucleotide composition and codon usage of P. caudatum mtDNA were
much more similar to Tetrahymena than to the congeneric P. tetraurelia.
Phylogenetic relationships within the genus Paramecium are well studied [10,11]. In a species phylogeny
based on 18S rRNA data, P. caudatum and the P. aurelia species complex are closely related and belong to the
“P. aurelia subgroup” [11]. This was also supported by
the tree based on cox1 sequences (Figure 2B). Taken
into consideration the phylogenetic position of P. tetraurelia, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that a low G
+C content and the preference for A/T ending codons
represent the ancestral state in the genus Paramecium.
An increased G+C content in combination with the preference for G/C ending codons would be a derived condition in P. aurelia mtDNA. No further complete
Paramecium mitochondrial genomes were available to
test this hypothesis. We analyzed the nucleotide

Barth and Berendonk BMC Genomics 2011, 12:272
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/272

composition in a fragment of the cox1 gene, which can
be used as an indicator for the overall mitochondrial G
+C content [12,13]. These sequences supported the
above hypothesis, since the shift in the nucleotide composition obviously took place in the lineage leading to
the P. aurelia species complex (Figure 2A, B). Of course,
this cox1 data set contained only few of the 15 known P.
aurelia species, and for a conclusive statement all relevant species should be included. But in this context,
please note that [14] and [15] obtained DNA sequences
from different mitochondrial genes of all P. aurelia species and these data suggest that the increased mitochondrial G+C content is a consistent pattern throughout
the species complex. The observed shift in the nucleotide composition of P. tetraurelia mtDNA was associated with a significantly reduced CUB. The CUB in P.
caudatum mtDNA, exemplified by the effective number
of codons, was similar to T. pyriformis and other singlecelled eukaryotes such as Chlamydomonas [16]. P. tetraurelia, on the other hand, had a much lower CUB (i.e.
higher Nc) in nearly all genes (Table 3, additional file 1,
Table S1). These differences in base composition and
CUB were not reflected in the derived amino acid composition, which was similar for all the compared species
(additional file 2, Figure S1). This suggests strong purifying selection on the mitochondrial amino acid composition in P. tetraurelia.
The causes for this large shift in G+C content and
codon usage in P. tetraurelia mtDNA are unknown. In
a recent publication, the complete macronuclear genome sequences of P. tetraurelia and T. thermophila
were compared [8]. The authors observed very similar
nucleotide composition and codon usage patterns in
both species. Thus, whatever caused the shift in the P.
tetraurelia mitochondrial genome seems to have only
affected mtDNA and not nuclear DNA. Furthermore,
the altered nucleotide composition was observed for
both protein-coding and noncoding regions (Table 2),
indicating that the increased G+C content is not the
consequence of selection for either a higher expression
level of P. tetraurelia mitochondrial genes, or towards
certain codons. Possible explanations for the increased
G+C content in the P. tetraurelia mitochondrial genome
are discussed below.
A high G+C content could be an adaptation to temperature, UV exposure or other environmental conditions that require a high DNA stability [17] (but see
[18]). Although the presently available data suggest that
some P. aurelia species may be restricted to certain biogeographic regions [19,20], there is no evidence for P.
tetraurelia generally preferring higher temperatures
than P. caudatum. In fact, both species often co-occur
and have to cope with similar environmental conditions
[21].

The observed pattern in P. tetraurelia mtDNA could
as well be the consequence of neutral processes like
biased gene conversion (BGC) or a general change in
mutation pressure from AT towards GC. A neutral process being the underlying mechanism is in concordance
with the observation that the G+C content in P. tetraurelia mtDNA was highest at most neutrally evolving sites
(3rd codon positions and noncoding regions). In more
constrained mtDNA regions (2nd codon positions and
ribosomal RNA genes), the base composition of P. tetraurelia was not significantly different from P. caudatum
(Table 2, Figure 2). However, this observation is not per
se evidence for neutrality of the underlying mechanism.
It is in principle also consistent with an adaptive process
in combination with strong selective pressure on the
amino acid composition.
BGC is a GC biased repair process in genome regions
that undergo recombination and has been identified as a
major drive in genome evolution [22]. Gene conversion
has been suggested as recombinational mechanism in
the mitochondrial genome of the killifish Kryptolebias
marmoratus [23], and as an explanation for the exceptionally high mitochondrial G+C content in the green
alga Polytomella capuana [24]. Previous studies using
mtDNA found no evidence for recombination events
among P. aurelia species [14,15]. It is, nevertheless, possible that such a mechanism has played a role in the
evolutionary history of the P. aurelia complex.
In this context it is interesting to note, that a whole
genome duplication (WGD) has occurred in the common ancestor of the P. aurelia complex [6]. A significantly reduced CUB was also found in nuclear encoded
mitochondrial genes of Saccharomyces species, which
experienced a WGD [25]. To our knowledge, the influence of a WGD on the mitochondrial genome has not
been investigated. It is tempting to speculate that the
WGD influenced the crosstalk between nuclear and
mitochondrial genomes (e.g. through nuclear encoded
genes for the mitochondrial replication and repair
machinery).
In conclusion, the observed picture is best explained
by a hitherto unknown (neutral or adaptive) mechanism
that increased the G+C content in P. aurelia mtDNA
on the one hand, and strong purifying selection on the
ancestral amino acid composition on the other hand.
These contradicting forces are counterbalanced by a
considerably altered codon usage pattern.
Gene content and sequence evolution compared to P.
tetraurelia

The size of the P. caudatum mitochondrial genome was
within the range predicted from earlier RFLP analyses
[9] and ~10% longer than the mitochondrial genome of
P. tetraurelia [5]. This difference was primarily due to

Barth and Berendonk BMC Genomics 2011, 12:272
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/272

the presence of the large open reading frame ymf64 in
P. caudatum (discussed in more detail below).
We found one unique ORF (ymf87) in P. caudatum,
which was not present in P. tetraurelia. This is in contrast to Tetrahymena, where complete synteny among
five phylogenetically diverse Tetrahymena species was
observed, except for some rare gene duplications [3].
The existence of many ORFs of unknown function is a
general problem in protist mitochondrial genomes [26].
Likewise, for about half of the protein-coding mitochondrial genes in ciliates no definite function can be
assigned [1-3]. One main objective of studies obtaining
new ciliate mitochondrial genomes is therefore the
annotation of these unknown ymf genes. Unfortunately
we failed to assign any function to hitherto unknown
genes, which is most likely due to the high evolutionary
rate of ciliate mtDNA. This problem even challenged
the alignment of some ORFs from the closely related P.
caudatum and P. tetraurelia. For example, in ymf84
only 33% of the amino acids were identical among both
species. Therefore, BLAST searches as well as manual
alignments could not determine a possible equivalent of
this gene in Tetrahymena. The authors of the T. pyriformis mtDNA study suggested a possible homology of
Paramecium ymf84 and T. pyriformis ymf74 based on
gene size and position (between nad10 and rpl2) [1].
The recently published mitochondrial genome sequence
of the rather distantly related Euplotes minuta confirmed this suggestion, as this conserved gene order was
also found in Euplotes [4].
In general, evolutionary rates are governed by negative
(purifying) selection, neutrality or positive (diversifying)
selection. The ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous
substitution rates (Ka/Ks) allows an estimation of the
selective constraint on a given gene. Values <1 are indicative for purifying selection, whereas values >1 indicate
diversifying selection [27,28]. Ka/Ks values of the protein-coding genes in the Paramecium mtDNA were generally <1, indicating that purifying selection is acting on
all genes.
The genes with high sequence similarities between P.
caudatum and P. tetraurelia also had low Ka/Ks values.
This may indicate that the selective optimum for those
genes is similar in the compared species. An exception
to this trend was the ribosomal protein gene rpl2,
whose Ka/Ks ratio indicates a relaxed selective constraint in combination with moderate sequence divergence. In Tetrahymena, no elevated Ka/Ks ratios were
observed for this gene [2,3]. In the present study, putative ORFs had significantly (2.5fold) higher Ka/Ks values
compared to known protein-coding genes, indicating a
lower selective pressure on those non-annotated genes.
Similar results were obtained in a study comparing T.

Page 8 of 11

pyriformis and T. thermophila [2]. Furthermore, these
authors supposed that the high divergence of putative
ORFs causes difficulties to detect homologous genes
through similarity searches. Some of the putative ORFs
in Paramecium, however, had low Ka/Ks values and a
relatively high sequence similarity in P. caudatum and
P. tetraurelia (Table 1). It is surprising that for these
genes, which are conserved within ciliates and seem to
be under notable selective pressure, no homologs could
be detected in other organisms.
Ymf64

The most conspicuous feature in the P. caudatum
mtDNA was a large N-terminal extension of ymf64
compared to the previously published ciliate mitochondrial genomes. This was also the main reason for the
length difference between the mitochondrial genomes of
P. tetraurelia and P. caudatum (40,469 vs. 43,660 bp).
An initial PCR survey revealed that the large gene
extension was not present in the mitochondrial genomes
of three further members of the P. aurelia complex (P.
primaurelia, P. pentaurelia and P. jenningsi), P. multimicronucleatum, P. nephridiatum and P. putrinum (data
not shown). These results together with the phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2B) suggest that this gene extension is a unique feature of P. caudatum rather than an
ancestral feature that was lost in P. tetraurelia. The Cterminal part of ymf64 also showed similarity to the Cterminal part of a gene that was annotated as rps3 in
Euplotes (but is not homologous to rps3 in Paramecium
and Tetrahymena mtDNA). Interestingly, also in
Euplotes this gene possesses a large N-terminal extension, although it is smaller than in P. caudatum (gene
length of 758 aa in E. minuta) [4]. The size of ymf64
resembles ymf77 in the Tetrahymena mtDNA, which is
approximately 1,300 amino acids long [2]. However,
besides the gene length no other similarities could be
detected. The existence of two remarkably large but
unrelated mitochondrial genes in two relatively closely
related ciliate genera is surprising and needs further
study. We are currently investigating the sequence and
length variation of ymf64 in P. caudatum and will
furthermore apply RT-PCR analyses to test whether the
gene is expressed in full length.
The length variable repeat in the middle of ymf64 is
the first report of an intragenic mitochondrial minisatellite in ciliates. Variable Number Tandem Repeats
(VNTRs) or minisatellites are common in the mtDNA
of many different organisms, especially metazoans [29].
The high variability (i.e. frequent changes in the number
of repeat units) is supposed to occur through slipped
strand mispairing during mtDNA replication. In most
cases these VNTRs are located in or adjacent to the

Barth and Berendonk BMC Genomics 2011, 12:272
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/272

noncoding mitochondrial control region. To our knowledge, an intragenic mitochondrial minisatellite has been
reported only from a gene of unknown function in the
oomycete Phytophthora sojae [30]. On the other hand,
minisatellites encoding nuclear sequences are not unusual. Genes containing polymorphic repeat elements are
capable to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions or to generate new functions. This is of special
importance in developmental genes of multicellular
organisms [31] and in cell wall/surface proteins of unicellular prokaryotes [32] and eukaryotes [33] Based on
the present data, however, it is not possible to suggest a
potential function for the repeat region within ymf64.
Minisatellites have been useful for the investigation of
population structure and phylogeographic patterns and
also for the identification of individual organisms or
clones [34]. Only recently, mtDNA sequences have been
successfully applied as genetic markers for the investigation of intraspecific variation in ciliates [35,36]. In one
of these studies several polymorphic cox1 haplotypes
were observed among natural isolates of P. caudatum
and P. multimicronucleatum, which reflected no clear
geographic structure [35]. The ymf64 repeat region
proved to be polymorphic in different P. caudatum isolates that share the same cox1 haplotype (Figure 3). This
indicates a higher evolutionary rate of this sequence
region. Further analyses including more isolates will
show whether the ymf64 minisatellite has potential as a
genetic marker for Paramecium.

Conclusions
The aim of this study was to compare the mitochondrial
genome sequence of Paramecium caudatum to the previously published mtDNA of P. tetraurelia. While gene
order and gene content were very similar in both species, the analysis revealed that nucleotide composition
and codon usage bias of the P. caudatum mtDNA differed greatly from P. tetraurelia. The G+C content of
the P. tetraurelia mtDNA was nearly twice as high as in
P. caudatum (41.2% vs. 22.4%) and the codon usage bias
was much lower (Nc=: 52.1 vs. 33.5). Unexpectedly, the
effective number of codons in the P. caudatum mitochondrial genome, is more similar to the distantly
related T. pyriformis and other single-celled eukaryotes
such as Chlamydomonas, than to the closely related P.
tetraurelia. The analysis of cox1 data from additional
Paramecium species showed that the shift towards a
higher mitochondrial G+C content took place in the
lineage leading to the P. aurelia species complex. The
reasons for this shift are presently unknown and future
studies will investigate whether this is linked to the
whole genome duplication that occurred in the common
ancestor of the P. aurelia complex.

Methods
Paramecium strains

The P. caudatum strain GB-E used for mitochondrial
genome sequencing was originally isolated from a small
pond in the vicinity of the University of Edinburgh and
kept as clonal culture in the collection of the Molecular
Evolution laboratory at Leipzig University. The following
Paramecium species were used for the nucleotide composition analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction
(Accession numbers for the cox1 sequences are given in
parentheses): P. primaurelia [GenBank:FN421324], P.
biaurelia [GenBank:FN421325], P. tetraurelia [GenBank:
FN421326], P. novaurelia [GenBank:FN421327], P. jenningsi [GenBank:FN421328], P. schewiakoffi [GenBank:
AM072773]), P. multimicronucleatum [GenBank:
AM072766], P. calkinsi [GenBank:FN421329], P. nephridiatum [GenBank:FN421331], P. duboscqui [GenBank:
FN421332], P. polycaryum [GenBank:FN421330], P.
putrinum [GenBank:FN421333], P. bursaria [GenBank:
FN421334].
Molecular methods

DNA extraction followed a Chelex ® protocol as
described in [35]. The nearly complete mitochondrial
genome of P. caudatum was amplified in overlapping
fragments of 3-15 kb length using Phusion™ high fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes OY). PCR primers
were designed from alignments of conserved gene
regions from P. tetraurelia [GenBank:NC001324] and T.
pyriformis [GenBank:NC000862].
PCR products <5 kb were directly sequenced employing a primer walking method. Longer PCR products
were gel-purified (GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit, Amersham Biosciences) and then digested
with the restriction endonuclease XbaI (Fermentas) to
obtain smaller fragments. Restriction fragments up to 3
kb were A-tailed using a Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas), cloned into pGEM-T Vector (Promega), and
sequenced with universal vector primers. Longer fragments were completed by primer walking. Peripheral
regions of the linear mtDNA were amplified via step-out
PCR [37], single primer PCR [38], and uneven PCR [39].
Cox1 fragments were amplified with primers and PCR
conditions described in [35].
Genome annotation and sequence analysis

Sequences were manually checked and assembled using
BioEdit v. 7.0.5.3 [40] and then annotated with ARTEMIS
v. 9 [41]. Open reading frames of > 60 aa length were
compared to GenBank entries using the BlastP program
[42]. Additionally, the corresponding nucleotide
sequences and intergenic spacers supposed to contain
the RNA genes were manually aligned to the

Barth and Berendonk BMC Genomics 2011, 12:272
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/272

mitochondrial genome of P. tetraurelia [GenBank:
NC001324]. The tRNAscan-SE server [43] was employed
to assign the tRNA genes. The Ka/Ks_Calculator [28]
was used to estimate the selective pressure on proteincoding genes. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out
with MEGA4 [44]. Nucleotide composition, codon usage,
and sequence statistics were analyzed with MEGA4 and
different programs implemented in the Sequence Manipulation Suite [45]. The effective number of codons (Nc)
was estimated with the program CodonW v. 1.3 http://
codonw.sourceforge.net// and the number of rare codons
was calculated according to [8]. Nc describes to what
degree the codon usage in a genome is biased. It is a
number between 20 and 61 where 20 means only one
codon is used for each amino acid and values approaching 61 suggest equal usage of synonymous codons [46].
