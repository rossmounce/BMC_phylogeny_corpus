Horizontal transfer of transposabletransposable elements reveals evidence for unexpectedly high rates of horizontal transfer between three

Abstract
Background: Horizontal transfer (HT) could play an important role in the long-term persistence
of transposable elements (TEs) because it provides them with the possibility to avoid the checking
effects of host-silencing mechanisms and natural selection, which would eventually drive their
elimination from the genome. However, despite the increasing evidence for HT of TEs, its rate of
occurrence among the TE pools of model eukaryotic organisms is still unknown.
Results: We have extracted and compared the nucleotide sequences of all potentially functional
autonomous TEs present in the genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba 1,436 insertions classified into 141 distinct families - and show that a large fraction of the families
found in two or more species display levels of genetic divergence and within-species diversity that
are significantly lower than expected by assuming copy-number equilibrium and vertical
transmission, and consistent with a recent origin by HT. Long terminal repeat (LTR)
retrotransposons form nearly 90% of the HT cases detected. HT footprints are also frequent
among DNA transposons (40% of families compared) but rare among non-LTR retroelements (6%).
Our results suggest a genomic rate of 0.04 HT events per family per million years between the
three species studied, as well as significant variation between major classes of elements.
Conclusions: The genome-wide patterns of sequence diversity of the active autonomous TEs in
the genomes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba suggest that one-third of the TE families
originated by recent HT between these species. This result emphasizes the important role of
horizontal transmission in the natural history of Drosophila TEs.

Background

Transposable elements (TEs) are short DNA sequences (usually <15 kb) that behave as intragenomic parasites, vertically
transmitted through generations [1]. According to their
molecular structure and life cycle, they are classified into
DNA transposons (type 1) and retrotransposons (RTs; type

2), reflecting the absence or presence, respectively, of an RNA
intermediate in the transposition process. The latter are further divided into two major classes according to whether or
not they are flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs): LTR
RTs and non-LTR RTs [2-4]. TEs have been linked to fundamental genomic features [5] such as size [6-8], chromosome

structure [9,10] and chromatin organization [11], and their
abundance is determined by an equilibrium between their
ability to replicate by transposition and the opposed effects of
natural selection [1,12] and host-defense mechanisms [13].
The possibility of stochastic loss means that TEs should be
progressively eliminated from the genomes until their extinction, but this contrasts with the fact that they are found in all
life forms [2]. Horizontal transfer (HT) between species is the
most likely means by which TEs can escape vertical extinction
[14-17], and an increasing amount of evidence for HT of
eukaryote TEs has accumulated over the years, from the classic examples of the P and Mariner elements of Drosophila
[18,19], to more recent cases described in other dipterans
[20,21], invertebrates [22], vertebrates - including fish [23]
and mammals [24] - and plants [25]. Drosophila is the genus
whose TEs have been most thoroughly studied. In a recent
review, Loreto et al. [26] gathered evidence for over 100 cases
of HT of TEs across Drosophila species. However, methodological issues such as ascertainment bias (for example, the use
of TE detection methods based on sequence homology, such
as PCR or nucleotide sequence comparisons, or the preferential study of young active TE families) mean that this catalogue of HT cases cannot be used as a reference for the
relative importance of such events in the evolutionary biology
of the pool of active elements in a given genome.
To directly address this issue, we extracted and compared the
DNA sequences of all autonomous TEs in the genome
sequences of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba.
These species were selected on the grounds of the large differences in their relative genomic TE content - 5%, 2% and 12%,
respectively [27] - our previous knowledge of their TE repertoire (D. melanogaster), the quality of their genome assemblies, and their phylogenetic relationships, in order to ensure
the optimal performance of the TE detection strategies used
(see Materials and methods).
The best proof that a DNA fragment shared by two species
originated by HT is that the level of nucleotide divergence at
its neutrally evolving sites is much lower than the average
neutral divergence between the two species' vertically transmitted genomes. Provided that TE sequences are subject to
similar evolutionary forces as those that operate over the
genomes that host them, this can be used to study the HT of
TEs across species (Figure 1) [14,26,28]. Using this approach,
we compared the patterns of neutral divergence of TEs with
those of a comprehensive set of 10,150 nuclear genes from the
genomes of the same species [29]. Synonymous sites were
used as a proxy for neutrally evolving sites. Thus, TE families
without coding capacity - non-autonomous - were not
included in this study. Our results suggest that a significant
fraction of TEs have experienced HT, and allowed us to estimate the genomic rate of HT of TEs amongst these Drosophila species.

Figure history of TEs and their hosts
Natural 1
Natural history of TEs and their hosts. On the left, if TEs are vertically
transmitted (VT), their evolutionary history (red) follows that of their
hosts (grey). At copy number equilibrium (3), TE abundance is constant
along the generations, and speciation events of the hosts cause
diversification of TE lineages. The possibility of stochastic loss (5) means
that any TE family can be randomly lost over the generations in a given
host. In the long term, this would cause the vertical extinction of all TEs
from the genomes. On the right, HT of TEs (blue arrow) allows the
possibility of recurrent invasions and long term persistence of TEs. TE
arrival into a new host by horizontal transfer (HT) (1) is followed by a
period of copy number increase (2) until transposition-selection
equilibrium is reached (3). Upon speciation and the concomitant
diversification of hosts and TEs (4), the stochastic loss of a family in a given
lineage (5) can be reversed by HT. However, this should leave a genetic
footprint. Neutral genetic differentiation is a direct function of time since
divergence. If TEs and host nuclear genes are subject to similar
evolutionary forces, the synonymous divergence of vertically transmitted
extant orthologous TE families (KSTEs) is expected to be similar to that of
the nuclear genes of the hosts (KSNGs) as the same time has elapsed since
their split (t0-t2; continuous line). But TEs that jumped between these
species have had time to accumulate differences only since the HT event
(t0-t1; dotted line), so that reduced levels of divergence relative to host
genes are expected.

Results and discussion

We used a combined strategy (see Materials and methods) to
retrieve the sequences of all potentially active insertions of
autonomous TEs (that is, insertions that covered >80% of the
canonical length of any TE with the capacity to encode the
enzymes responsible for their transposition) in the genomes
of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba.
We considered as members of the same family all insertions
generated by transposition of one or various closely related
elements - that is, those that displayed 80% or higher
sequence homology in at least 80% of the canonical sequence
[3,4]. For between-species comparisons, we needed to distinguish 'orthologous' families - that is, those derived from a single family that was active in the two species' most recent
common ancestor by the time of their split, or later transmitted by HT between the two species - from 'paralogous' families, originated by differentiation of TE lineages in the species'
common ancestor prior to their split, or by HT from species
other than those included in this study. To do this, we compared the estimates of synonymous divergence between TEs

and nuclear genes from each species and established a threshold above which two TEs would be considered as paralogous.
Considering the extra rounds of DNA replication during
transposition and the lower fidelity of retrotranscriptases, the
rate of neutral evolution of TE-derived sequences is expected
to be the same or slightly higher than that typical of neutral
sites of the host genomes. Thus, we arbitrarily considered as
orthologous all families that displayed a level of synonymous
divergence (KS) below the 97.5% quantile of the distribution
of synonymous divergence values for the set of 10,150 nuclear
genes between the host species [29] (see below).
In total, we obtained 1,436 insertions and grouped them into
141 orthologous families (Table 1). LTR RTs are the most
abundant major type of TE, followed by non-LTR RTs and
DNA transposons, although non-LTR RTs are the most abundant in D. simulans. D. melanogaster and D. yakuba display
a similar diversity of families, with 97 and 87, respectively,
nearly twice as many as the 57 of D. simulans. These results
are broadly consistent with the observed fractions of repetitive DNA in the genomes of these species [27]. It should be
noted that the DINE-1 family was not included in this study as
no coding region has been identified; this is by far the most
abundant TE in these species, particularly in D. yakuba
[30,31]. Insertions of 72 families were found in more than one
species, 28 of which are present in all three species (Figure 2).
For four families we were unable to find any insertion covering at least 85% of the coding sequence and these were
excluded from the analyses (see Materials and methods).
Synonymous divergence values for pairwise comparisons of
the sample of 10,150 nuclear genes from the three host species [29] are nearly normally distributed (mean [2.5%-97.5%
quantiles]): 0.126 [0.037-0.230], 0.303 [0.096-0.531] and
0.284 [0.083-0.505], for D. melanogaster versus D. simulans, D. melanogaster versus D. yakuba and D. simulans versus D. yakuba comparisons, respectively. In contrast, the
distributions of synonymous divergence estimates for orthologous TEs differ significantly from those for the nuclear genes
(Figure 3; P < 0.001, two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests).
In fact, the probability of randomly drawing a sample from

Volume 10, Issue 2, Article R22

Bartolomé et al. R22.3

the nuclear genes' KS values not significantly different from
the corresponding sample of TE values was smaller than 0.01
for the three between-species comparisons (Materials and
methods). TE divergence estimates display multimodal distributions, with a large fraction of lowly diverged TEs, and
two minor peaks of families with KS values close to the nuclear
gene averages and, in the comparisons involving D. yakuba
(with a deeper phylogenetic resolution), of highly diverged
families.
In a previous study, experimental data obtained for a reduced
sample of 14 TE families from the same species by means of
PCR amplification and DNA sequencing provided evidence
for unexpectedly low KS values for orthologous TEs from the
same species [17]. That dataset can be used as an external
quality control: out of the 28 possible between species comparisons (14 D. melanogaster TEs compared with their orthologues from D. simulans and D. yakuba) we found five minor
discrepancies between the two approaches, which do not
affect the overall results. Both studies detected elements representative of the same overall number of families in D. simulans and D. yakuba. However, two families, HMS-Beagle and
roo, were PCR-amplified from D. simulans, but have not been
detected in the bioinformatic analysis. On the other hand, 412
and F were detected in D. yakuba in the bioinformatic study
only. These differences can be attributed to the properties of
the techniques used, for the following reasons. First, PCR
primers in the study of Sanchez-Gracia et al. [17] were
designed to amplify an approximately 1.5 kb fragment of coding DNA from each family. Thus, the only requisite for a TE to
be detected by PCR was the presence of a single intact copy of
the amplicon region. This means that the PCR technique cannot discriminate defective from potentially active elements,
so that PCR amplifications could be mistakenly taken as evidence for the presence of active copies. This could explain the
results for HMS-Beagle and roo. Second, PCR primers in the
study of Sanchez-Gracia et al[17] were designed using D. melanogaster TE sequences as a reference. Considering the large
dependency on sequence homology at the priming sites for
PCR amplification success, moderately diverged TEs in the
other species may have remained undetected by this method.

The other discrepancy concerns the opus family. PCR data
suggested reduced divergence between D. melanogaster and
D. simulans copies (KS = 0.003), which conflicts with the
results from the bioinformatic analysis (KS = 0.13; Table S1 in
Additional data file 1). A closer look at the sequences obtained
in the present analysis revealed that three opus sequences
were detected in D. simulans but two of them did not fit the
length requirements and were excluded. One of these
sequences overlaps a 634 bp region of the amplicon obtained
by PCR. Interestingly, these D. simulans opus sequences display high sequence homology with the PCR amplicon produced in the study of Sanchez-Gracia et al. [17] (KS = 0.006),

This could explain the failure to amplify some families from
D. yakuba DNA (412 and F). Third, it is also conceivable that
some of the TE insertions might not have been fully assembled in the complete genome sequences, so that there is a
chance that some families with potentially active copies are
not represented in the genome sequences. Fourth is the use of
different Drosophila strains in the two studies: two isofemale
lines from African natural populations of D. simulans and D.
yakuba in the study of Sanchez-Gracia et al. [17], and laboratory strains D. simulans w501 and D. yakuba Tai18E2 in the
whole genome sequencing projects [27]. It is well known that
most active TEs segregate at low frequencies in natural populations of Drosophila [1,32,33] and that most families are represented by only a few copies in each genome [34,35], so that
a certain amount of variation in the number of families represented by full-length copies across individuals of the same
species would not be unexpected.

as well as with the canonical sequence of D. melanogaster (KS
= 0.006). It is likely, therefore, that there are at least two lineages of opus elements in D. simulans, one of which displays
high homology with D. melanogaster opus sequences. Both
of them were detected by our bioinformatics analysis, but the
one more similar to the D. melanogaster sequences does not
seem to be represented by any intact copy in the sequenced
genome. In summary, the comparison of these two independent sets of data confirms that both TE detection methods produce equivalent results regarding the number of detected
families and overall patterns of synonymous diversity, and
that the bioinformatics approach used here has a better resolution than the PCR method.
Among the 119 pairwise comparisons, we detected 37 families
with KS values lower than the lower 2.5% quantile of the
nuclear genes' KS distributions (Table 2 and Figure 4). LTR
RTs display the largest fraction of lowly diverged families
(41%), and there is also consistent evidence for lower than
expected KS values for 40% of the comparisons involving
DNA-transposons (although the sample size of the latter (N =

There are significant differences in the relative age distributions across the major classes of elements (P < 0.001; χ2 heterogeneity test; Figure S1b in Additional data file 1). LTR RTs
and DNA transposons are, on average, significantly lessdiverged than non-LTR RTs (P< 0.001; χ2 heterogeneity test).
Overall, LTR RTs contribute to 89% of the putative cases of
HT detected, a fraction twice that previously reported in Drosophila [26]. Our results also support the notion that HT is
rare amongst non-LTR RTs [12,16,26].

Unbiased gene conversion is expected to have a relatively
small effect on silent within-species diversity among members of the same family [41], and cannot affect divergence
between species that has arisen since the species split. It is
possible that AT-biased gene conversion, or GC to AT mutational bias, could reduce the rate of evolution of AT-rich
sequences such as synonymous sites in TEs. However, unconstrained intergenic DNA sequences in the D. melanogaster
genome are also AT-rich and evolve at a similar rate to synonymous sites in nuclear genes [42], and there is no reason to
believe that AT-rich synonymous TE sites should evolve at a
slower rate than these.

recent common ancestor of orthologous TEs and, thus, to
date putative HT events. Assuming vertical transfer, these
ratios should be distributed around one, or slightly above one
if TEs experience a larger mutation rate than nuclear genes
(for example, as a consequence of extra rounds of replication
during transposition and lower fidelity of TE replication
enzymes). The distributions of these ratios do not vary significantly across the three between-species comparisons (P >
0.05; Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests; Figure S1a in Additional
data file 1). They reflect an excess of young TEs that have
diverged little as compared with expectations assuming vertical transfer, and are consistent with the observation that Drosophila TEs are much younger than the genomes that harbor
them. This is further supported by the fact that the levels of
variation among insertions of a given family are much lower
within the three species than expected assuming copy
number equilibrium. On average, they display one-fifth of the
expected diversity assuming equilibrium (Table S2 in Additional data file 1). This is also in good agreement with previous results for D. melanogaster TEs [17,43,44]. In addition,
nucleotide variants are at lower frequencies (that is, present
in fewer insertions) than would be expected under copy
number equilibrium, as revealed by the consistently negative
results of Tajima's D test [45] (Figure 5; Table S2 in Additional data file 1). This is expected if most insertions have
been generated recently from a single or a few active copies
for each family, so that most nucleotide changes are found in
a new insertion.

If synonymous sites from TEs and host nuclear genes evolve
at similar rates, these results can only be explained if an unexpectedly high fraction of the TEs analyzed have recently experienced HT among these species. It might be argued that
other processes that reduce the levels of variation among
homologous TE sequences, such as higher selective constraints, or recurrent gene conversion between insertions of
the same family, could slow down the rate of evolution of TEs.
However, it is difficult to see how these could explain such low
levels of divergence. High selective constraints on TE
sequences - for example, to elude host silencing mechanisms
- would have the same effect on all sites of the element, such
that KA/KS values would be expected to be close to one. But
this contrasts with the low average KA/KS value for the studied
TE open reading frames (ORFs; 0.41; 95% confidence interval
(CI) 0.27-0.55; Table S1 in Additional data file 1), consistent
with purifying selection operating on TE amino acid changes,
similar to most host nuclear genes. Selection on codon usage
is unlikely because codon bias is very weak for TEs [36] compared with host genes. The relatively larger effective population size of TEs [37] would not greatly increase the efficacy of
selection at TE synonymous sites, given that the median numbers of potentially active copies per family in these species are
not very large (5.5, 1.0 and 2.5 for families in D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba, respectively). Indeed,
codon usage in TEs is less biased than in host nuclear genes of
these species (mean effective number of codons (ENC) = 54.0
versus 47.1, respectively); similarly, the GC content at thirdcodon positions in TEs (0.43) is much lower than that of
nuclear genes (0.68), and close to the expected equilibrium
GC content (0.40) for unconstrained sequences in Drosophila [38-40]. This suggests a lower effectiveness of selection on synonymous sites of TEs than on host nuclear genes.

The distributions of KS values among the little-diverged TEs
display a peak within the range 0.03-0.05 (Figure 3). If we
assume a mutational clock of 0.011 substitutions per nucleotide per million years [46], this suggests that most HT has
occurred over a broad period of time centered between
30,000 and 40,000 years ago and prior to the world-wide
expansion of D. melanogaster and D. simulans from their
ancestral African distribution range, around 15,000 years ago
[47].
Among the 48 TE families shared by D. melanogaster and D.
simulans, 15 putative cases of HT were detected. Considering
that they diverged 5.4 million years ago [46], this yields a rate
of 0.058 HT events per family per million years (95% CI,
0.032-0.095, assuming a Poisson distribution). This is twice
that observed between either of these species and D. yakuba
(0.027 (95% CI, 0.015-0.045) and 0.019 (95% CI, 0.0080.040), respectively), which suggests a negative association
between HT rate and host genetic differentiation. However,
longer divergence times between species mean larger probabilities of stochastic loss of TEs from a lineage and lower
power of detection (see below). These differences should,
therefore, be taken with caution.
Accordingly, with the observed differences described above,
the average HT rates for LTR RTs and DNA transposons
(mean ± standard error: 0.046 ± 0.015 and 0.047 ± 0.024,
respectively) are nearly seven times larger than for non-LTR
RTs (0.007 ± 0.004). Overall, our results suggest a rate of
0.035 ± 0.012 HT events per family per million years across
these Drosophila species. It should be noted, however, that
HT of a TE could happen anytime after the host species split,
but the power to identify such events decreases as the time to
speciation and the HT events approach each other, so that the
possibility that a fraction of little-diverged elements might
have been misclassified as vertically transmitted - that is,
their KS values are above the 2.5% quantile of the distribution
of KS values for nuclear genes - cannot be discarded, and this
would make our estimates slightly conservative.
These differences between HT rates across TE classes raise
the possibility that the current relative abundances of the
major groups of elements in these genomes reflect only their
very recent history, so that the over-abundance of LTR RTs in
D. melanogaster and D. yakuba is a recent phenomenon produced by their currently higher HT rate. Assuming that TE
infection of a new host is followed by a period of high transposition activity (Figure 1), this could also explain the discrepancies between direct estimates of the TE transposition
rate from mutation accumulation experiments [48-53] and
those based on genome sequence data [44], as the former
could reflect higher current transposition rates of recently
horizontally transferred elements. However, this would apply
only if the rate of HT of new elements to a given species varied
widely over time, but the fact that we did not detect significant

Volume 10, Issue 2, Article R22

Bartolomé et al. R22.7

differences in the fractions of horizontally transferred elements across species argues against this scenario.
One could also speculate on the possibility that the arrival of
new active autonomous families to a naïve genome could
prompt the mobilization of extant dormant non-autonomous
TEs and, thus, be associated with large between species variation in transpositional activity and copy number of non-automous elements, such as is observed for DINE-1 elements
across Drosophila species [30].
It would be tempting to invoke the ability of some LTR RTs to
produce potentially infectious virus-like particles to explain
their higher genomic HT rate [54], but LTR RTs with an env
gene (essential for virus-like particle synthesis) do not display
a significantly greater HT rate than those that lack it (P = 0.75
in a Fisher exact test; data not shown). Other mechanisms,
probably involving the role of a vector, such as a DNA virus
[55], bacteria, parasitoids [56] or mites [57], must also play
important roles in the HT of TEs among these Drosophila
species (reviewed in [16,26]).

Conclusions

We have identified 1,436 potentially active TEs that represent
141 families in the genomes of D. melanogaster, D. simulans
and D. yakuba. The genome-wide patterns of sequence diversity of these TEs are consistent with the hypothesis that HT
plays an essential role in the natural history of TEs. Nearly
one-third of the autonomous families have originated by
recent HT between these species. This process is more common amongst LTR RTs and DNA transposons than amongst
non-LTR RTs. The fraction of TEs generated by HT does not
seem to vary significantly across species. Overall, we estimate
a HT rate of 0.035 events per TE family per million years.

Materials and methods
Drosophila species and genomes
D. melanogaster and D. simulans are two cosmopolitan sibling species native to tropical Africa that underwent speciation about 5.4 million years ago [46], and that spread
worldwide following the rise of agriculture about 13,000 to
15,000 years ago [47]. D. yakuba is found across the tropical
African mainland and nearby major islands. It is a close relative of D. melanogaster and D. simulans, with whom it
shared a common ancestor 12.8 million years ago [46].
The chromosome assemblies of D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba genomes (releases 5.4, 1.0 and 1.0,
respectively) were downloaded from Flybase [58]. Full details
of the assemblies can be found at FlyBase and at the Genome
Sequencing Center at Washington University in St Louis
(GSC-WUSTL) [59]. The genome of D. melanogaster has
been extensively assembled and the subject of several rounds
of TE annotation [60]. The genome sequences of D. simulans

and D. yakuba were initially assembled at 3× and 8× coverage, which permits an adequate level of assembly [61], and
were further improved with additional target reads and complementary information [27]. This allowed the assembly of
these genomes into 20 supercontigs, which correspond to the
chromosome arms, euchromatin, heterochromatin and
unplaced sequences. TE sequences in these genomes have not
been manipulated in any way and were treated as any other
sequence during the assembly process (GSC-WUSTL, personal communication).

Transposable element annotation
Retrieval of TE sequences from the complete genomes was
performed following a three-way search strategy based on:
nucleotide homology to known TEs; amino acid homology to
known TE protein sequences; and de novo detection of TEs
using ReAS [62].

Step one: nucleotide homology
RepeatMasker (revision 1.201 with WU-BLAST-2.0 engine)
[63] was used to extract all TE-derived sequences from the
three Drosophila genomes. As a query we used a library of the
nucleotide consensus sequences of: all elements described in
Drosophila (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and Repbase [64]), the majority of which were described in D. melanogaster; TE databases for other dipterans such as Anopheles
gambiae and Aedes aegypti (TEfam [65]); and sequences of
other families, individually selected to ensure that all major
groups of DNA transposons and RTs described to date [2]
were represented. Internal regions and LTR motifs of LTR
RTs were treated separately. All hits with ≥ 60% nucleotide
homology over ≥ 80% length of the query sequences were
grouped by homology, aligned with MUSCLE v.3.6 [66] (gapopen = -600) and hand-curated with the aid of BLAT against
their respective genomes [67]. We performed a systematic
trial of different combinations of values for each filter criterion, and found this setting to be the most efficient for the
reconstruction of active families.
Considering that mean divergence at synonymous sites
between D. yakuba and D. melanogaster or D. simulans is of
the order of 30% [29], that mean divergence at non-synonymous sites is usually one order of magnitude smaller in Drosophila species [29], and that autonomous TEs are composed
of roughly 50% of non-synonymous sites (if we assume that
two-thirds of the sequences are coding [2], and that synonymous and non-coding sites evolve at the same rate), then the
expected average nucleotide divergence between the farthest
related species in this study is of the order of 17%. Thus, these
search criterions are broad enough to include the vast majority of putatively active copies of all known TEs in these species
as well as others closely related to them.
The resulting alignments allowed us to reconstruct the canonical sequences of all potentially active families detected in
each of the three genomes. The new canonical sequences were

Volume 10, Issue 2, Article R22

Bartolomé et al. R22.8

added to the query database and the search process was
repeated until no more new families were found. In a final
run, all insertions were extracted, grouped and aligned into a
comprehensive database of full-length insertions of all autonomous families (≥ 80% homology with a canonical sequence,
≥ 80% of the canonical sequences) in these species [3,4].

Step two: amino-acid sequence homology
The resulting TE-masked genomes were further screened for
TEs with WU-BLAST (tblastn) [68] using as query a database
compiling: the annotated and conceptual translations of the
coding sequences of all Drosophila TEs in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and Repbase; all TE amino acid
sequences in A. aegypti and A. gambiae (TEfam); and a selection of other sequences representative of the major groups of
elements [2]. Any hits with ≥ 60% amino acid sequence
homology over ≥ 80% of the length of the query sequences
were retained and processed in an iterative manner as
described above. This allowed us to identify any element
putatively missed by the nucleotide homology approach, with
the wider phylogenetic depth provided by the slower rate of
evolution of amino acid sequences.

Step three: de novo detection of transposable elements
The genomes were masked again for any new family identified in step two and an iterative search (blastn) was performed using as query a de novo library of candidate TE
sequences from the three genomes produced by ReAS [62].
Novel TEs were grouped, aligned and hand-curated, and their
canonical sequences and full-length insertions were added to
the corresponding databases.
As a quality control we compared the results produced by our
method with previous annotations of TEs in D. melanogaster. All previously annotated families with full-length
copies in the D. melanogaster genome [34] were detected in
the present study, although copy numbers varied slightly due
to the use of different homology and size-based selection criteria.

Quantification of the number of horizontal transfer
events
Following a maximum parsimony criterion, all TEs that produced evidence for just one HT between any two of the three
species were counted as a single HT event. In some cases,
orthologous families could be found in the three species, and
the observed levels of KS were consistent with HT in the three
pairwise comparisons. These can be explained by three alternative two-step paths, but usually there is not enough information to unambiguously determine the true one. Thus, the
three paths were considered equally probable, so one HT
event between each species pair was counted and weighted by
two-thirds, the chance they occurred. No cases of apparent
HT between D. yakuba and the ancestor of D. melanogaster
and D. simulans were detected.

Molecular evolution analyses
Estimates of nucleotide divergence at synonymous (KS) and
non-synonymous (KA) sites were obtained using the NG86
model [69], applying the JC correction [70]. The average
number of differences per nucleotide site between two random insertions of the same family in a given species (diversity) was measured using Nei's π and Watterson's θW
estimators [71,72], applying the JC correction. These calculations are implemented in DnaSP v.4.10 [73] and Mega v.3.1
[74]. Bootstrap estimates of the standard errors of KS estimates between TEs were calculated using Mega v.3.1. Levels
of within-species diversity were calculated for families with at
least three copies. The Tajima's D test was run by hand using
Excel (Microsoft). Only the longest complete ORF of each
family was used for these analyses (usually the one including
the pol gene; Tables S1 and S2 in Additional data file 1).
Sequences of overlapping regions between adjacent ORFs or
shorter than 85% of the canonical ORF were excluded from
the analyses.
Pairwise estimates of synonymous divergence for 10,150
nuclear genes from these species were taken from Begun et al.
[29]. The 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the KS distributions
were estimated by bootstrap. The empirical distributions of
the samples of KS values for TEs and nuclear genes were compared by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which estimates the probability that the two samples were drawn from
the same population [75]. Bootstrap estimates of the P-values
of the tests were obtained by re-sampling both populations
(Monte-Carlo simulations). In addition, we calculated bootstrap probabilities that the samples of KS values for TEs did
not differ significantly from a random sample of similar size
drawn from the corresponding nuclear gene data. To do this,
we extracted random subsamples of the size of each TE sample from the relevant set of KS values for nuclear genes (that
is, involving the same species pair), compared each with the
TE sample, and estimated the fraction of cases in which they
did not differ significantly. We used 1,000 replications in all
bootstrap analyses. The statistical computing environment R
[76] was used to perform these analyses.
