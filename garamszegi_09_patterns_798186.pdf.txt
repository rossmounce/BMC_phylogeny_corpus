Abstract
Background: The evolutionary history of many parasites is dependent on the evolution of their hosts, leading
to an association between host and parasite phylogenies. However, frequent host switches across broad
phylogenetic distances may weaken this close evolutionary link, especially when vectors are involved in parasites
transmission, as is the case for malaria pathogens. Several studies suggested that the evolution of the primateinfective malaria lineages may be constrained by the phylogenetic relationships of their hosts, and that lateral
switches between distantly related hosts may have been occurred. However, no systematic analysis has been
quantified the degree of phylogenetic association between primates and their malaria parasites.
Methods: Here phylogenetic approaches have been used to discriminate statistically between events due to codivergence, duplication, extinction and host switches that can potentially cause historical association between
Plasmodium parasites and their primate hosts. A Bayesian reconstruction of parasite phylogeny based on genetic
information for six genes served as basis for the analyses, which could account for uncertainties about the
evolutionary hypotheses of malaria parasites.
Results: Related lineages of primate-infective Plasmodium tend to infect hosts within the same taxonomic family.
Different analyses testing for congruence between host and parasite phylogenies unanimously revealed a
significant association between the corresponding evolutionary trees. The most important factor that resulted in
this association was host switching, but depending on the parasite phylogeny considered, co-speciation and
duplication may have also played some additional role. Sorting seemed to be a relatively infrequent event, and can
occur only under extreme co-evolutionary scenarios. The concordance between host and parasite phylogenies is
heterogeneous: while the evolution of some malaria pathogens is strongly dependent on the phylogenetic history
of their primate hosts, the congruent evolution is less emphasized for other parasite lineages (e.g. for human
malaria parasites). Estimation of ancestral states of host use along the phylogenetic tree of parasites revealed that
lateral transfers across distantly related hosts were likely to occur in several cases. Parasites cannot infect all
available hosts, and they should preferentially infect hosts that provide a similar environment for reproduction.
Marginally significant evidence suggested that there might be a consistent variation within host ranges in terms of
physiology.
Conclusion: The evolution of primate malarias is constrained by the phylogenetic associations of their hosts.
Some parasites can preserve a great flexibility to infect hosts across a large phylogenetic distance, thus host
switching can be an important factor in mediating host ranges observed in nature. Due to this inherent flexibility
and the potential exposure to various vectors, the emergence of new malaria disease in primates including humans
cannot be predicted from the phylogeny of parasites.

Background
Parasites do not randomly infect hosts, as their reproduction needs to be adapted, at least to some degree, to the
environment within the host. When hosts undergo certain
selection regimes, their parasites might also take subsequent evolutionary steps to achieve maximal fitness in the
new situation. As a result, parasites may be expected to coevolve with their hosts. Parasites may also jump onto new
hosts and start to exploit these as alternative resources,
which may provide them with additional breeding opportunities. Alternatively, speciation may occur without host
change, leading to the duplication of lineages within the
same host. Finally, parasites may become extinct, if their
evolution does not follow the diversification of hosts.
Therefore, co-divergence (or co-speciation), horizontal
transfer (or host switching), duplication and extinction
(or sorting) are the key elements of the historical association between hosts and parasites [1].
Co-speciation has been demonstrated in several parasite
systems, including lice, thrips, worms, viruses, bacterial
and viral symbionts [[2-5], e.g. [6,7]]. The evolutionary
history of malaria pathogens also provides examples coevolutionary patterns. Phylogenetically related parasite
species exploit phylogenetically related host species of
vertebrates, and the division of bird-, reptile- and mammal-specific parasites delineates true taxonomic categories. This pattern at the broad scale may appear to be a
result of co-speciation, but can actually be produced by
evolutionary forces associated with vector shifts into different dipteran families [8]. The evolutionary routes
within malaria parasites of birds and reptiles took two
directions that apparently followed the evolutionary history of their hosts [9-11]. The ancestral species diverged
and produced the genus Haemoproteus and Plasmodium,
with the former displaying only sexual reproductive cycles
in the hosts while the latter requiring asexually reproducing merozoite cycles before gametogenesis. The avian
Haemoproteus/Plasmodium split was very close to the split
between passerine and non-passerine hosts, thus the current diversity of avian malaria parasites has accompanied
the radiation of modern birds. Hence, the evolution of
malaria parasites in birds shows strong associations with
host evolution and distribution, and has resulted in certain degree of conservativeness of host specificity
[10,12,13]. However, this is not an exceptional case, as
most of these major groups have wide host distributions
[8]. There is ongoing debate about the phylogenetic history of primate-infective plasmodia [14], thus it remains
an intriguing question as to whether the appearance of the
major parasite lineages of this clade and their subsequent
evolution were mediated by analogue changes in the corresponding host phylogeny [15].

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/110

Co-speciation alone is unlikely to shape the diversification and radiation of malaria parasites. The disease is
spread by dipteran vectors that are generalist and thus easily establish parasite transmission across distantly related
hosts, which facilitates host switches [9]. Moreover, vertebrate hosts are mobile, can migrate across large distances
and often form flocks with other species or share habitats
with diverse fauna [12,13,16], factors which all favour
parasite transmission across species borders, and which
weaken the phylogenetic association between host and
parasite phylogenies. Hence, malaria parasites can disperse between sympatric host populations through host
switches. Accordingly, lateral transfer between birds and
reptiles may have occurred several times, while the utilization of mammals as hosts appears to have arisen via at
least one host switch from a reptile host [11,17]. At a finer
scale, some bird malarias are able to infect hosts across
different families, and statistical evidence proves that current distribution of parasites may also reflect relatively frequent acquisition of new hosts by individual parasite
lineages [9].
Frequent lateral transfer also seems to be a remarkable
component of evolution in the primate-infective malaria
lineage. For example, the four human-infective malaria
species may have arisen independently during the phylogenetic history, not necessarily resulting from the close
association with the evolution of human hosts. Plasmodium ovale is an ancient divergence from the main lineage
and shares ancestors with Hepatocystis parasites [11]. Plasmodium vivax is a part of a recent species radiation and
seems to have been derived about 100,000–50,000 years
ago in south-east Asia, from a species that had exploited
macaques and switched to Homo sapiens, or even to Homo
erectus [18]. The origin of Plasmodium malariae is debated,
as it can be grouped with all the three complexes (falciparum/vivax/ovale groups). However, P. malariae may exist
for many million years, and is only distantly related to the
other human parasites. One theory about the origin of P.
falciparum postulates that its ancestor derived from avian
malaria parasites via lateral transfer [19,20], while recent
studies suggest that it diverged from the primate parasite
lineage [15,17,21]. However, it is still an open question
whether the human parasite originates, through a host
switch, from an ape parasite or vice versa, or these parasites
are resulted from the close co-evolution with human and
chimpanzees, in which they followed the Homo/Pan separation without lateral transfer.
Concerning parasites of non-human primates, host
switches are suspected in parasites of New World primates. Plasmodium simium is closely related to P. vivax, and
it is likely that this parasite was originally a human parasite that switched host when entering the Americas [22].
Similarly, parasitism due to Plasmodium brasilianum of pla-

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:110

tyrrhine primates may have been acquired by contact with
humans that served as a basis for the transfer of the sister
taxa, P. malariae. The opposite scenario cannot be
excluded, as humans may also have obtained P. malariae
from animal reservoirs via lateral transfer [23]. Moreover,
the phylogeny of Asian and African parasites includes several disagreements with the host phylogeny that may suggest several host switches across distantly related primates.
Plasmodium parasites have been detected in only four of
the fifteen Cercopithecidae genera. In addition, while
macaques in Asia are intensively parasitized, malaria
infection has never been described in the sympatric langur, proboscis monkey or doucs [15]. More conspicuously, the twenty species of the African Cercoptithecus
genus seem parasite free, while the three species of Cercocebus harbour three kinds of malaria parasites. Therefore, Plasmodium species are unlikely to be able to infect
all available primates via lateral transfer. Hence, some
degree of conservativeness should affect the host choice of
these parasites.
Previous studies regarding the evolutionary history of
malaria parasites in the light of that of their hosts provide
evidence for the occurrence of multiple host switches, but
patterns of co-evolution are also suggested in some cases.
However, observed associations between host/parasite
phylogeny may be caused by extinction and re-colonization events in the past that are difficult to document with
extant species. Moreover, it should be remembered that
having no evidence for malaria parasitism in certain hosts
may reflect inadequate sampling and not necessarily the
non-existence of Plasmodium infection in these hosts. To
make inferences about the degree of host phylogeny
mediating the evolution of host choice in the parasite, statistical analyses are needed to control for these confounding factors. Host switches and co-speciation have been
demonstrated quantitatively in birds [9,10], but such
approaches have not applied yet to study host diversification in the primate system.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the association
between the evolutionary history of primate malaria parasites and that of their hosts, and the evolutionary constraints of host specialization. First, mathematical
formulas will be used to test whether the probability of
co-occurrence of parasites with their hosts represents random host choice or taxonomically constrained host selection. Second, by comparing parasite and host
phylogenies, the role of co-divergence, duplication, sorting and horizontal transfer in mediating host-parasite
relationships will be quantified. Phylogenetic analyses
will be performed to test for the significant association
between the evolutionary tree of primate hosts and their
malaria parasites. Third, by estimating ancestral states of
host ranges, host utilization patterns along the phyloge-

netic history of Plasmodium parasites will be traced that
may help identify host-switching events on the tree.
Finally, the similarity in physiological environment across
the host range of parasites will be examined. These analyses can be used to make inferences about consistent selection pressures that may act within hosts and shape host
choice and the degree of specialization. Based on our current knowledge about the phylogenetic history of malaria
parasites and their host, in general, one can predict to
detect statistical support for co-speciation and host
switching.

Methods
Phylogeny of parasites and their hosts
The phylogenetic history of primate malaria parasites was
reconstructed by using sequence information on six genes
from various published sources. The combination of data
from different studies was preferred, because different
molecular markers gave different phylogenetic hypotheses
[14], and it is important to account for such uncertainty in
estimating phylogenetic relatedness. This can be achieved
in a Bayesian framework, that incorporates Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and provides a robust
sample of alternative phylogenetic trees that can be fitted
to the sequence data equally well [24,25]. The sequence
information were gathered from the GenBank for the following genes: 18S rRNA for 15 species [15], beta-tubulin
(nuclear gene), cell division cycle 2 (nuclear gene) and
elongation factor Tu (plastid gene) for 10 species [18],
cythocrome b (mitochondrial gene) for 14 species
[17,21], and merozoite surface protein (nuclear gene) for
12 species [23,26-28]. Sequences were aligned as in the
source papers by using MEGA. Altogether, it was possible
to obtain aligned sequences for 18 Plasmodium species of
primates. These were used to generate phylogenetic trees
based on MCMC sampling in MrBayes 3.1 [25,29]. Haemoproteus was used as outgroup, while genetic data on
other mammalian malaria species were also added (Plasmodium berghei, Plasmodium yoelii and Hepatocystis). Posterior distribution of trees were estimated from a Markov
Chain implementing a general time reversible model of
evolution with gamma correction for heterogeneity
among sites (GTR + Γ model), which is widely used to
model sequence evolution in primate malarias [e.g.
[11,18,27]]. However, complex partitioned models were
used, and all parameters were estimated separately for the
individual genes. It was also assumed that the overall evolutionary rate was different across partitions. The chain
used uniform prior probabilities on trees and the parameters of the model of sequence evolution, and an exponential prior on branch length. After reaching
convergence, the chain was sampled 1,000 times at intervals of 10,000 trees (10 million iterations) after a stationary point (burn-in) that was identified based on (1) plots
of log likelihoods over time, (2) similarity in topologies,

branch support (posterior probabilities), and log likelihoods between trees from each replicate, and (3) average
standard deviation of split frequencies between runs. This
sampling provided an independent set of trees (serial
autocorrelations: log-likelihood, r = 0.0005; tree-length, r
= 0.0013, N = 1000). The phylogeny and branch lengths
were estimated from the majority-rule consensus of the
pooled post burn-in trees from the two replicates. The
nodes of the consensus tree had very high (> 95%) Bayesian posterior probabilities indicating that these nodes
were represented in almost the full proportion of trees in
the sample (Figure 1). There was one exception close to
the root of the consensus tree, which was supported only
in the 71% of all trees. The removal of the genetic data for
rodent malaria species and Hepatocystis from the MCMC
sampling of phylogeny (with the same settings as above)
provided alternative phylogenetic resolution at this node

(Additional file 1). Hence, in the following analyses of
historical association between hosts and parasites, both
consensus trees representing two different resolutions at
the uncertain node were used, and the corresponding
results are provided in parallel. Figures for the former resolution are presented within the paper, while figures for
the latter alternative resolution are given as additional
files 1, 2 and 3. Phylogenetic methods based on Bayesian
approaches are available to estimate ancestral states, and
these can handle the whole sample of Bayesian trees and
thus can take phylogenetic uncertainties into account.
Accordingly, the complete sets of trees were used in these
analyses.
The phylogeny of primate hosts is less debated. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on Bayesian analyses of cytochrome-b markers have been made for a subset of species

[30], which agreed with the major taxonomic features
identified in an earlier composite estimate based on parsimony algorithm to over a hundred trees [31]. Nonetheless, there was noticeable uncertainty about some nodes,
emphasizing the need for a Bayesian approach that
accounts for such phylogenetic uncertainty in the future.
Currently, insufficient genetic information is available to
create a complete Bayesian phylogeny for primates including more than 200 extant species. This reconstruction
would require sequence data for the same genes sampled
across the majority of species. Therefore, the phylogeny of
host species was taken from the most recent primate
supertree, whose topologies were derived from a set of
partially overlapping, smaller source trees originating
from previously published studies that had been based on
a variety of data types, reconstructed using a variety of
methods. This supertree was obtained from BinindaEmonds et al [32], which is a complete species-level phylogeny of extant mammals from over 2,500 partial estimates, with divergence times estimated from genetic
information in conjunction with cladistically robust fossil
calibration points.
The probability of co-occurrence of parasites and hosts
The list of host species of each parasite was obtained from
reports on natural infections [15,23,33-39]. Based on this
criteria P. vivax and P. malariae were considered to infect
apes in addition to humans [[34], see also [40]]. Moreover, recent studies revealed that Plasmodium knowlesi is
likely a recently emerged species in humans, in the process
of becoming the 'fifth' human malaria parasite [41-44],
which was also considered in the subsequent analyses of
host – parasite relationships.

The lists of hosts were grouped into distinct clades (genus
and family) to quantify the degree of host sharing. The
probability approach of Ricklefs and Fallon [10] was used
to test whether related parasite species tend to infect hosts
within the same taxonomic clade or region. Since this
method does not require phylogenetic information, all
the 26 primate malaria parasite species that have been
described taxonomically [34] were included. The probability of randomly drawing two host species from the
same particular taxonomic group can be calculated as

H=

∑ Ni ∑ H
N

i =1

(i , j ) ,

(1)

j =1

where N is the total number of host species sampled
worldwide, Ni is the number of species in each i region,
and H(i, j) is derived from

H (i , j ) =

n ij (n ij −1)
N i (N i −1)

(2)

that gives the probability of detecting a pair of host species
from the same taxonomic group j within each geographic
region i [10]. The significance of H can be derived from
binominal probability calculations.
Historical association between primates and their malaria
parasites
Several methods have been developed to study host and
parasite co-evolution [2]. The majority of methods aim at
reconstructing a putative history of host-parasite associations by mixing the four types of co-evolutionary events
(co-speciation, switching, sorting and duplication) in a
manner that provides the less costs of the estimated evolutionary scenario [1]. For the data at hand (hosts being
infected by more than one parasite, and parasites infecting
more than one host), the most suitable method was the
algorithm that is implemented in program TreeFitter [45].
This approach relies on the event-based comparison of
trees and uses parsimony criteria to estimate the number
of co-divergence, duplication, sorting and switching
events to match host-parasite phylogenies. The comparison uses the assignment of costs to each type of event to
weight its probability of occurring. TreeFitter was unable
to handle the large and incompletely resolved phylogeny
of all extant primates (233 species) as provided by
Bininda-Emonds et al [32]. Therefore, the tree was
trimmed up to the genus level, and the remaining few polytomies were resolved at random, resulting in 60 tips.
Hence, the association between parasite species and host
genus was in the focus in TreeFitter.

Following the general practice [45], the TreeFitter analysis
was started by using the default cost settings (0, 0, 1, 2; for
co-divergence, duplication, sorting and switching, respectively). Given that this cost assignment is somewhat arbitrary, and the results may be sensitive to alternative
settings, separate analyses with different cost structures are
needed to assess the robustness of the results, and the relative contribution of each type of events. Therefore, the
outcome of the following alternative cost settings was also
assessed: (0, 1, 1, 1), as suggested by Page [46]; (-1, 0, 0,
0), the maximum co-divergence model [45]; (∞, 0, ∞, 1),
Fitch optimization that excludes co-speciation and sorting
via very high costs. Moreover, the overall fit and the contribution of different events were also estimated when
cost structures varied among 0.5, 1.0 and 2 (maximum
fourfold differences). Finally, the contribution of codivergence, duplication, sorting and switching was investigated by preventing individual events one by one by the
assignment of very high costs (100).
Inferences about the constrains of the congruent evolution between malaria parasites and their primate hosts or
about the number of events can be tested against inferences drawn from random data sets in TreeFitter. Random

trees are created from the original parasite and host trees
by random permutation or Markov process. The significance of each combination of events considered was evaluated against the null hypothesis that such a historical
scenario was statistically indistinguishable from a pattern
arising from the randomization tests. Phylogenetic significance for different scenarios was determined based on the
probability of observing a particular number of events
within the 10,000 random permutations of the opposing
phylogenetic trees.
The software ParaFit follows a matrix approach to perform
a global test of host-parasite co-speciation, but can also be

used to assess the relative weight of each parasite-host link
in mediating congruent evolution [47]. ParaFit was used
to combine phylogenetic distance matrices of both the
hosts and parasites and a matrix of incidences of infection
(yes or no) between parasites and hosts, and then to compare this observed matrix with an expected matrix that can
be calculated by the randomization of the incidence
matrix. This approach was able to use phylogenies (with
branch length and polytomies) describing relationships
among species for both hosts and parasites. However, for
illustrative purposes, associations between trees are presented by using the genus-level tree of primates (Figure 2
and Additional file 2).

Ancestral host ranges
The Markov models of discrete character state evolution
[48] were used to reconstruct the ancestral states of host
use (i.e. to which degree hosts are taken from hominoids,
cercopithecids or platyrrhine families) on the reconciled
distribution of topologies by using BayesTraits [24]. A
Markov chain was allowed to run for 101 million cycles
after convergence, which was assessed by comparing
results across five runs and plotting time series graphs.
Rate coefficients and ancestral states probabilities were
sampled every 10000 generations after a burn-in of
1,000,000 iterations. The transition rate parameters of
continuous-time Markov models of trait evolution were
conditioned by adjusting the ratedev parameter to a value
that provides an acceptance rate of newly proposed states
of the rate parameters between 20 and 40%. To assess the
robustness of model convergence, five independent
Markov chains of 101,000,000 observations were run,
and all of these observations converged on similar direction providing very similar posterior distributions of rate
parameters and ancestral state estimates. The sampling of
the chains (at each 10,000th iteration after burn in)
resulted in a sample of 10000 observations, which can be
considered independent (serial autocorrelation based on
log-likelihood, r = 0.046, N = 10000). Extremely long runs
(1,001,000,000) with a sampling at longer intervals
(100,000) lead to an increase in independence between
samples (serial autocorrelation based on log-likelihood, r
= -0.0001, N = 10000), but the results (rate parameters
and ancestral states) were basically identical to what could
be obtained with sorter runs. Therefore, results are calculated based on samples that relied on 101,000,000 iterations.

As the posterior results from a Markov chain may be sensitive to prior distributions, hyperpriors were used, that
seed priors from a uniform distribution on a given interval and distribution (gamma or exponential), and thus
reduce some of the uncertainty and arbitrariness of choosing priors. Having no a priori assumptions about the shape
of parameter distribution, gamma distributions were
applied generally, which can take a variety of uni-modal
shapes or even mimic exponential distribution (the use of
beta distributions was avoided, as beta priors are not yet
fully implemented in BayesTraits). The intervals of the
mean and variance of the prior distribution were set by
using information from the Maximum Likelihood results
obtained for all phylogenetic hypotheses considered
(1000 trees corresponding to 1000 models of trait evolution). These prior settings yielded posteriors that produced good fits of the data to the model of trait evolution
without imposing unrealistic restrictions on the rates (i.e.
they allowed wide posterior distributions of the rate
parameters and resulted the highest log-likelihood).

Consistent selection pressures across hosts
Parasites can be hypothesized to non-randomly infect all
available hosts, because they can infect hosts that provide
a similar environment only. As erythrocytes represent the
main environment for malaria parasites [49], it can be
predicted that hosts infected by the same parasite species
would display similar erythrocyte characteristics. Particularly, the availability of resources within the host body for
the parasite may be a function of erythrocyte size. The volume of the red blood cell can create constraints for the
within-cell growth during the merozoite phase, as larger
host cells could provide more space and supply than
smaller cells. Therefore, if a parasite species is selected to
match its reproductive features with a certain erythrocyte
size in a certain host (e.g. by particular periodicity or
merozoite number), after a host switch, it will be more
likely established in a new host that has similar erythrocyte characteristics. As a result the observed host range of
parasites should be composed of host species with comparable erythrocyte size. To test whether erythrocyte size
varies systematically within the hosts of parasites, mean
corpuscular volume (MCV) was used that corresponds to
a wet volume in μm3 (or fL) as provided by the Genome
Size Database [[50], http://www.genomesize.com/cell
size/]. MCV is usually measured directly with a Coulter
counter, but can also be calculated as the ratio between
haematocrit and red blood cell count. The use of information on wet volume over dry volume was preferred, as the
former is more directly reflects the constraint on parasite
growth. For some host species, that were not listed in the
Genome Size Database, information on cell volume were
derived from other sources [[51-54] and International
Species Information System, Minnesota Zoological Garden, Apple Valley, MN]. Data on host body size were used
from Smith and Leigh [55] to control for the potentially
confounding effect of allometric scaling of erythrocyte
traits [56] that deserves appropriate statistical treatment.
In addition, host specialization may be directly related to
life history traits as reflected by body size [57-59], that
should also be controlled for.

By including the available information on different hosts
of Plasmodium parasites, the gathered data were tabulated
at the host level. Each host entry corresponded to a primate species that is a known natural host of the parasite.
If a given host is infected by more than one parasite, a
multiple entry for that host species was created, which
were thus associated with different Plasmodium species. To
assess the degree to which parasites are selected by host
erythrocyte size, it was tested whether the variation of this
variable was larger between than within Plasmodium species, while controlling for host species identity as a random factor and host body mass as a fixed effect in a mixed
generalized linear model.

Results
The probability of co-occurrence of parasites and hosts
There are 26 taxonomically described primate malaria
parasites, which can be detected in 53 host species spanning across 25 genus and 8 families. This distribution represents 93 host-parasite relationships. Nine Plasmodium
species appear very host specific, as they can be observed
only in a single host species. More generalist parasites can
occupy from two up to 27 primate hosts (mean ± SE species-specific host range including specialists: 3.62 ± 1.05
with median = 2), with P. brasilianum representing the
most extreme breadth of host range (Figure 2 and Additional file 2). These host ranges at the species level cover
1–12 taxonomic groups at the genus level (mean ± SE
genus-specific host range: 2.11 ± 0.42 with median = 2),
while host ranges usually tend to fall within the same family, except in the cases of P. brasilianum and P. knowlesi,
which infect hosts from three and two families, respectively.

Among the nine parasite species recovered from exactly
two hosts, only two of the host pairs derived from the
same genus. The remaining seven host pairs came from
closely related genus within the same family. Using equations (1–2) to calculate the probability of drawing two
hosts from the same taxon gives H = 0.107 when the genus
level is considered as the focal taxonomic unit, and geographic regions are discriminated at a large scale (Africa,
Asia, South-America and Madagascar). This corresponds
to a statistical significance of P = 0.187 (two-tailed), when
the interest is to calculate the probability of finding
exactly two of nine pairs of hosts in the same genus. This
significance value indicates that it is not possible to reject
the hypothesis that random chance alone can create the
observed patterns at the genus level. Hence, primate
malaria parasites do not seem to link very tightly to specific host genus once they are able to infect at least two
hosts.
On the other hand, at the family level, there seems to be a
close association between host specificity and host taxonomy across different geographic regions. A random choice
would raise a probability of H = 0.420 to detect host pairs
within the same family and geographic region. Among the
17 generalist parasites, all but two choose host from the
same family, which strongly, at P = 0.007 significance
level, deviates from being accidental.
Historical association between primates and their malaria
parasites
The analysis using the default cost settings in TreeFitter (0,
0, 1, 2; for co-divergence, duplication, sorting and switching, respectively) suggests that there is a phylogenetic
association between parasite species and host genus, as
illustrated in Figure 2 and Additional file 2. The permuta-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/110

tion tests revealed that fitting host and parasite trees
results in significantly lower cost structure than it could be
expected by chance independent of the parasite tree considered (Table 1). The reconstructions showed two to four
co-divergences, eight to nine duplications, one to three
sorting events and five to six switching events, depending
on the phylogenetic hypothesis of parasites. The most
consistent pattern emerged in the two analyses was that
switching event was less likely than in the randomized
trees, while one parasite phylogeny resulted in a co-divergence cost structure that occurred more frequently than
random chance.
Subsequent analyses exploiting different cost assignments
are also summarized in Table 1. An alternative cost setting
reducing the penalty on switching (0, 1, 1, 1) also showed
significant fit between host and parasite trees. However,
the contribution of events to this fit was modified, as the
number of duplication events declined due to the costs
applied, while the number of host switching events
increased. Applying maximum co-divergence (-1, 0, 0, 0),
the overall cost of the model was very low, and a large
number of extinction was required to balance the predominance of co-speciation. Fitch optimization that
excludes co-speciation and sorting via very high costs (8,
0, 8, 1) returns with a significant relationship between
host and parasite phylogenies, which can be achieved if a
large number of duplications and switches are allowed.
When sorting and switching costs varied among 0.5, 1.0
and 2, the overall fit was still significant, with a strong
contribution of switching. Cost structures for duplication
and co-divergence demonstrated that these events could
also play some roles in mediating the association between
host and parasite trees depending on the evolutionary scenario considered for parasites. Preventing individual
events one by one by the assignment of very high costs
(100) returned with significant correlations between the
two phylogenies, except when duplication and switching
are prevented. This may suggest that the exclusion of these
events considerably reduces the probability of finding correlated evolution.
Altogether, there seems to be a strong association between
parasite and host phylogenies. The main factor contributing to this fit is the relatively small number of switching
events, and depending on the parasite phylogeny used,
the large numbers of co-speciation or duplication event.
Sorting can play a role only under some extreme scenarios, when it is to balance the high degree of co-divergence
or the low degree of switching.
In the application of ParaFit to the phylogenetic data, the
global test of association also provided significant evidence for congruent evolution (using parasite phylogeny
from Figure 1: ParaFitGlobal = 530560.47, P = 0.001,

The tests were performed between the consensus tree of primate malaria parasites given in Figure 1 and Additional File 1, and the phylogeny of
primate host genus in Figure 2. For each model, overall costs and the reconstructed number of events (expressed as ranges that result in equal total
costs) are given.
aEvent costs are co-divergence (co-speciation), duplication (within-host speciation), sorting (extinction) and switching (host change via lateral
transfer), respectively.
bOverall cost/the number of events significantly exceeds that for randomized trees (bP < 0.05, bbP < 0.01, bbbP < 0.001).
cOverall cost/the number of events is significantly less than that for randomized trees (cP < 0.05, ccP < 0.01, cccP < 0.001).

using parasite phylogeny from Additional file 1: ParaFitGlobal = 526811.09, P = 0.001) indicating strong phylogenetic structure behind the known host-parasite
associations. However, the close inspection of individual
parasite-host links suggests that not all Plasmodium-primate associations contribute equally to the global fit
between the two data sets. When using parasite phylogeny
from Figure 1, of 79 cases of infection, 59 (74.7%) had
probabilities of < 0.05 and an additional 13 links (16.5%)
were marginally significant (P ~0.1) (Figure 2). Similar
patterns emerged, when an alternative resolution was
used for parasite phylogeny (Additional file 1), with the
difference that some associations became stronger (Additional file 2). Parasite clades, for which divergence follows
that of their host, were those that infect South Asian cer-

copithecids, while there is also a remarkable association
between P. brasilianum and its hosts. Interestingly, parasites of apes and humans are not so closely associated
with their hosts.
Ancestral host ranges
The reconstructions of ancestral states of host use along
the phylogeny of primate malaria species based on Bayesian approaches are summarized in Figure 3 and Additional File 3. Without making any restrictions (i.e.
parasites are equally allowed to infect cercopithecid, hominoid and platyrrhine hosts at each node), the posterior
probabilities at the root of the tree indicated that the
ancestor of recent Plasmodium species of primates could
have used hosts from any large taxonomic group of pri-

mates (Figure 3a and Additional File 3a). However, during
the subsequent evolution, at least one early split may have
occurred, and one clade specialized on hominoids or platyrrhines, while another infected cercopithecids. Moreover, independent of the parasite phylogeny considered,
there are clear indications for more recent host changes
(e.g. Plasmodium hylobati, P. vivax, P. simium may have
been resulted from switches from cercopithecid hosts,
while brasilianum/malariae and falciparium/reichenowi pairs

may have been also resulted from lateral transfer across
large phylogenetic distances).
When considering time constraints, it is unlikely that the
ancestor of primate parasites was confronted with hominoid hosts. Hominoids diverged only c.a. 20 Myr ago
[32], while the origin of primate plasmodia can be dated
much earlier [60]. Therefore, this information could be
used as a fossil record. Accordingly, the two most distant

nodes (root and the node below) were restricted to allow
hosts from ancient primate hosts only (cercopithecids or
platyrrhines). This modeling yielded high posterior probabilities for the ancestral parasite being a cercopithecid
specialist species (Figure 3b and Additional File 3b). Subsequent evolutionary patterns of host use were similar to
those provided by the previous models applying no
restriction on any node. Therefore, one can identify,
depending on the phylogeny used, at least seven to eight
events that correspond to host changes across distantly
related host taxa (Figure 3b and Additional File 3b).

erally conservative, and do not infect all potential hosts
across wide phylogenetic distances. Only a single, highly
generalist parasite, P. brasilianum is able to infect a large
number of hosts, spanning three primate families (Aotidae, Atelidae, Cebidae). The evolutionary success of this
species in various hosts may result from the fact that it is
able to transmit via several vector species and from the
absence of other competitor parasites in South America
[34]. Moreover, it is also possible that the morphospecies
P. brasilianum consists of several genetically distinguishable lineages that specialize on different hosts.

Consistent selection pressures across hosts
There was only a marginally significant evidence for wet
erythrocyte volume being similar across the host range of
parasites in a mixed model, in which hosts effects were
controlled as random factor (F25,9 = 2.040, P = 0.133).
This was also the conclusion from the statistical model
that held constant allometric effect by including host
body mass as a co-variate (parasite-specific effects: F25,8 =
2.882, P = 0.062; host body mass: F1,8 = 11.901, P =
0.009).

Malaria parasites usually have a host range that is constrained by their geographic distribution. Primate hosts
are not randomly distributed across the globe, as certain
taxonomic groups are associated with certain localities
(i.e. prosimians in Madagascar, platyrrhins in South
America, and catarrhines in Africa and Asia). Hence,
malaria parasites found on different continents and countries are given a choice to infect hosts that are phylogenetically related to each other. Moreover, these parasites do
not randomly infect all available primate hosts, thus they
seem to have limited ability to parasitize on all sympatric
primate populations. This non-random selection of hosts
may imply that Plasmodium species are constrained to
adapt to hosts that provide similar growth environments.
Given that the environment for the parasites is established
by the physiological characteristics of primate hosts that
are strongly determined by their phylogenetic relationships, it was predicted that the host range of parasites covers sister species that constitute the most optimal
conditions for reproduction. There was a non-significant
tendency for that parasites – by infecting geographically
and evolutionarily related species – are faced with consistent selective pressures, as variation in host erythrocyte size
tended to be smaller within the host range of parasites
than across hosts of different parasites. Based on the current data of limited availability, therefore, it would be
immature to exclude the scenario that each Plasmodium
parasite has to cope with a more or less consistent haematological profile when adapting to a certain range of hosts.
However, other factors should also be considered, as various physiological and life history characteristics can affect
the host choice of malaria parasites. Accordingly, similarity in the host environment can be manifested across multiple host traits, which warrants further investigation. In
any case, the range of natural hosts should reflect the outcome of a long evolutionary adaptation and thus the role
of specialization that is dependent on host phylogeny.

Discussion
Various approaches were applied to estimate the relationship between the phylogenetic trees of primate malaria
parasites and their hosts. These analyses unanimously
suggested that the evolution of the focal parasites is constrained by the phylogenetic relatedness of their hosts,
and that host switches play central role in shaping the distribution of malaria species across their primate hosts.
First, parasites cannot randomly infect all geographically
available primates, because they appear only to be able to
fit their reproduction to closely related hosts that belong
to the same family (the extremely generalist P. brasilianum, and P. knowlesi that has recently established natural infection in human should be considered as
exceptions). Second, event-based reconciliation of parasites to host trees suggests that host switching is the most
obvious event that shapes the association between hostparasites phylogenies, but depending on the parasite phylogeny considered, the role of either co-speciation or
duplication cannot be generally excluded. Moreover, the
contribution of particular host-parasite associations in
mediating concordance between trees is different, as some
links appear to represent stronger phylogenetic structure
than others. Third, the reconstruction of ancestral states of
host use revealed that several switches of hosts across large
phylogenetic distances might have occurred during the
long evolution of primate malarias.
Patterns of co-occurrence of primate malaria parasites and
hosts were comparable to those that have been observed
in avian plasmodia at the family and the clade levels
[9,10]. Therefore, malaria parasites of vertebrates are gen-

Further analyses demonstrated that host ranges of primate
malarias observed today in nature resulted from long evolutionary history of adaptation, which is shaped by host
switches. Studies on various host – parasite model systems
have repeatedly demonstrated that co-evolution plays a

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:110

key role in shaping the resemblance of parasite phylogenetic trees to that of their hosts, while host switching
remains relatively infrequent in other parasites [e.g. [6164]]. Malaria pathogens differ from ectoparasitic or bacterial parasites by being transmitted by dipteran vectors,
which enhance lateral transfer between distantly related
hosts and thus increase the probability of host switching
[10]. Accordingly, several host switching events can be
reconstructed on the available phylogeny of primate plasmodia.
For example, there may have been an early split of cercopithecid and hominoid/platyrrhine malarias. The cercopithecid line may have successfully radiated first in Africa in
ancient mandrills, and later, a more recent adaptive radiation may have occurred in Asia in ancient macaques. The
presence of suitable vectors and divergent host populations are generally envisaged as the responsible factors
that allowed the successful spread of parasites in this
region [33,65]. Moreover, even within the apparently
host-conservative cercopithecid line, there are several
examples of lateral transfer of malaria across hosts from
different families (cercopithecid-hominoid host switch)
(Figure 3 and Additional File 3). For example, the ancestor
of the gibbon malaria, P. hylobati derived from Plasmodium
inui-like parasite, whereas the human P. vivax also originates from a macaque parasite. In addition, the recently
gained ability of P. knowlesi to grow in human hosts
reflects the host switch of a parasite that primarily evolved
to infect cercopithecid species. Furthermore, other recent
nodes also involve flexible host ranges, as the ancestors of
malarias infecting platyrrhine primates were probably
omnipotent parasites with the capacity to grow in hominoids.
Parasites of the cercopithecid lineage demonstrate noticeable diversity in terms of life history, as their host specialization does not inevitably require the development of
exclusive reproductive strategies that would restrict their
potential to exploit alternative hosts. This group includes
both relapsing and non-relapsing parasites, spans quartan, quotidian and tertian species and is basically represented by generalist plasmodia that can grow in up to
eleven primate hosts (mean ± SE host range: 4.0 ± 0.99
species). A great diversity in fundamental reproductive
strategies has thus been preserved. Such diversity can
maintain the genetic variation on an evolutionary time
scale, and can underlie successful host switch once conditions for transmission are fulfilled. Additionally, the associated anopheline vector populations deliver repeated
chances of contacts with diverse primate fauna providing
frequent opportunities for parasite transfer [34,66].
Macaque malarias rely on mosquitoes from the Leucosphyrus group that feed on various primates across broad taxonomic ranges including humans and orang-utans.

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/110

The results yield some additional details concerning the
evolution of human malarias. For example, the current
resolution suggests that the ascendant of P. falciparum and
Plasmodium reichenowi may have involved species that
could parasitize the ancestors of New World primates.
This may imply that i) in the past, very generalist parasites
may have existed that could realize host switches across
large distances; or ii) that parasite lines followed the evolutionary splits of their hosts [21]. Unfortunately, the current results cannot bring us closer to the events that
occurred within the falciparum/reichenowi line. It thus
remains plausible that the recent host ranges of these Plasmodium species derive from a long-term co-evolution with
the host species after a very early split, or from more recent
switches between ape and human hosts. Moreover, the
estimated ancestral states are consistent with both the
anthroponosis and zoonosis theories of origin that may
have been operated in South-America [22]. It is equally
likely that the ancestors of the simian parasites (P. brasilianum and P. simium) were human malaria species (P.
malariae and P. vivax), or vice versa. In order to understand
the origin of New World malarias, we have to rely on the
interpretations of events in association with temporal and
spatial constraints [18,60]. This approach suggests, at least
in the case of the simium/vivax pair that the human
malaria P. vivax originates from a Plasmodium species
infecting Asian cercopithecids that was subsequently
brought to the New World and colonized simian primates
giving birth to P. simium. Besides the unresolved uncertainties, one striking pattern emerges from the ParaFit
results: the evolution of human malarias is not structured
by host phylogeny, and it is likely that the history of
human parasites involve host switches across large phylogenetic distances (Figure 3). Consequently, the emergence
of a new human pathogen cannot be predicted from the
parasite phylogeny. This is likely to be explained by the
preserved flexibility of malaria parasites to infect alternative hosts, and the potential to use various vector species.
Host specialization can involve some costs, as long-term
commitment to a particular host may reduce the genetic
variation needed for the use of alternative hosts. Therefore, extreme specialization may represent an evolutionary-dead-end, in which further evolution via host
switching is limited [67]. Accordingly, host-specific parasite lineages should be established during the early evolutionary history of the lineage, and such ancestral
specialization should determine subsequent host diversification by constraining the frequency of host switches
across wide phylogenetic distances [17]. The deterministic
evolution of host ranges is evident from the phylogenetic
history of Plasmodium species at a broad scale, as the specialization to the major vertebrate host groups has an
ancient origin and subsequent host switching occurred
rarely [11]. However, analyses within the avian parasite

Page 12 of 15

Malaria Journal 2009, 8:110

clade showed that host switching occurs relatively frequently even at the subterminal nodes of the parasite phylogeny, although these switches bridge closely related
hosts [10]. On the other hand, the primate malaria system
demonstrates clear host switches across large phylogenetic
distances at both shallow and deep nodes of the phylogeny (Figure 3 and Additional File 3). This indicates that
host specialization does not necessarily lead to evolutionary-dead-ends at a fine scale, and that the emergence of
new diseases via lateral transfer across distantly related
primate hosts cannot be ruled out.
Inferences about evolutionary events of parasites in the
light of host phylogenies are sensitive to the phylogenetic
information at hand. Although Bayesian approaches were
used to deal with phylogenetic uncertainties, for some
species no genetic data were available making it impossible to place them on the phylogenetic tree of primate
malarias. Most importantly, information about the phylogenetic position of lemur (e.g. Plasmodium girardi) and
hominoid (e.g. Plasmodium rodhaini, Plasmodium schwetzi
and Plasmodium pitheci) parasites is lacking. Moreover, it
might be that due to incomplete sampling, some lineages
have not yet been discovered. By adding these missing or
newly discovered parasite species to the parasite tree our
picture about the details of co-speciation or host switching may change. To quantify the risk of the emergence of
new malaria disease that may threaten humans or species
with great concern, it would be crucial to test whether the
remaining hominoid parasites are grouped together with
the falciparum/reichenowi clade, or are spread throughout
the phylogenetic tree. From such information, the likelihood of host switches between hosts closely related to
humans could be estimated. However, from an evolutionary point of view, existing data already show strong evidence for congruence between host and parasite
phylogenies and that host switching plays a key role in the
evolution of malaria parasites of primates including those
that infect humans.

Conclusion
The systematic analysis of patterns of host-parasite co-evolution in the primate malaria system reveals that the phylogenetic history of primate-infecting plasmodia is
constrained by the phylogenetic associations of their
hosts. One of the most important factors that shape this
pattern is hosts switching, and some parasites can preserve
a great flexibility to infect hosts across a large phylogenetic
distance resulting in broad host ranges that can be
observed in nature. The emergence of new malaria disease
in primates including humans cannot be fully predicted
from the phylogeny of parasites.
