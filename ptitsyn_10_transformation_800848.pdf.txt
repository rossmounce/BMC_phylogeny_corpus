Transformation of metabolism with age and
lifestyle in Antarctic seals: a case study of systems
biology approach to cross-species microarray
experiment
Andrey Ptitsyn1, Amber Schlater2, Shane Kanatous2*

Abstract
Background: The metabolic transformation that changes Weddell seal pups born on land into aquatic animals is
not only interesting for the study of general biology, but it also provides a model for the acquired and congenital
muscle disorders which are associated with oxygen metabolism in skeletal muscle. However, the analysis of gene
expression in seals is hampered by the lack of specific microarrays and the very limited annotation of known
Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) genes.
Results: Muscle samples from newborn, juvenile, and adult Weddell seals were collected during an Antarctic
expedition. Extracted RNA was hybridized on Affymetrix Human Expression chips. Preliminary studies showed a
detectable signal from at least 7000 probe sets present in all samples and replicates. Relative expression levels for
these genes was used for further analysis of the biological pathways implicated in the metabolism transformation
which occurs in the transition from newborn, to juvenile, to adult seals. Cytoskeletal remodeling, WNT signaling,
FAK signaling, hypoxia-induced HIF1 activation, and insulin regulation were identified as being among the most
important biological pathways involved in transformation.
Conclusion: In spite of certain losses in specificity and sensitivity, the cross-species application of gene expression
microarrays is capable of solving challenging puzzles in biology. A Systems Biology approach based on gene
interaction patterns can compensate adequately for the lack of species-specific genomics information.

Background
The number of species that come under the spotlight of
biological research by far exceeds the number of model
organisms for which specific gene expression tools are
available. Analysis of gene expression patterns in nonmodel species does not merely serve our inexhaustible
curiosity about our planetary companions. Understanding adaptation in other species provides valuable clues
for understanding our own physiology, molecular
mechanisms of disease, and potential cures. One
remarkable example of this comes from a seemingly
unlikely source: the Weddell seal.

Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) inhabit the
cold waters around the Antarctic continent. During
their lifetime, seals experience a cardinal transformation in lifestyle and physiology. Pups are born on fast
ice and spend the first months of their life as land animals. Then, while juvenile seals are learning to dive,
they have a lifestyle similar to the harbor seals (Phoca
vitulina) which inhabit the shallow coastal waters of
the Northern hemisphere. Later in life, however, Weddell seals develop into elite, deep long duration divers.
During their transition from a land to a marine lifestyle, seal physiology undergoes a series of changes: an
increase in the aerobic efficiency of the skeletal muscles, a shift towards fatty acid catabolism for aerobic
ATP production, enhanced oxygen storage, improved
diffusion capacity, and reduced dependency on bloodborne oxygen and metabolites (e.g. decreased capillary

density) compared with terrestrial mammals [1]. It has
been reported that the seals also undergo transformation in muscle fiber composition and mitochondrial
density from a state similar to athletic terrestrial animals to that of sedentary terrestrial animals of compatible size [1].
Further understanding of this transition requires both
tracing the change in activity of individual genes and a
broad overview of scores of different genes. A microarray survey of activity for a few thousand genes in each
sample provided the needed boost for the study. However, the application of microarray technology, almost
routine in other areas, presents a series of challenges for
the study of Weddell seals. This is because there is no
microarray specifically developed for this or any other
related species of seal. There is also no reference genome sequence available at this point. The development
of custom arrays from the Expressed Sequence Tag
(EST) libraries is possible, but this process is expensive
and time consuming. There are remarkable examples of
gene expression using custom microarrays for dolphins
[2-4]. However, the greatest obstacle for using custom
arrays is the lack of functional annotation for ESTs.
There is also no specific information on gene interaction
for this species. It is reasonable to believe that canonic
biological pathways on Weddell seal muscle are sufficiently similar to those of more closely studied model
organisms; such as mice, rats or humans. Thus, information on major metabolic pathways in general can be
used as a guide to understanding specific changes in
seal physiology; if only it were possible for expression
patterns in seal muscles to be mapped to the database
of metabolic pathways of humans.
The idea of cross-species hybridization is almost as
old as microarray technology (see [5] for review). It has
been used in many different studies on organisms for
which a specific microarray platform were not available:
examples range from cross-hybridization between different species of salmon and trout using salmon-derived
microarray [6] to the application of a tomato microarray
to study eggplants [7]. Cross-species applications of
microarrays can be successfully applied for the analysis
of evolutionary relations and are a boon for naturalists
who are interested in functional genomics. Reproducibility of microarray hybridization seems to correlate with
the phylogenetic distance in branching species [8]. However, the successful identification of a few differentially
expressed genes is insufficient for understanding the
nature and the mechanism of metabolic transformation
associated with age and lifestyle transition in Weddell
seals. We need to acquire a broad scope of gene expression patterns and to identify the molecular structures
and functions implicated in deep diving adaptation.

Methods
Animals

Twenty-four newborn Weddell seal pups (age 3-5 weeks,
mean mass 75 ± 3 kg) were captured over three field
seasons (October-December of 2002, 2005, and 2006) by
using mild physical restraints or a purse string net near
the pupping colonies in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.
Likewise, eighteen juvenile (age 1-2 years, mean mass
120 ± 5 kg) and twenty-six adult Weddell seals (age 7+
years, mean mass 385 ± 13 kg) were captured with a
purse string net along natural tidal cracks in McMurdo
Sound. The ages of all the seals were determined from
flipper tags with the data provided by personal communication with R. Garrott, J. Rotella, and D. Siniff (NSF
grant OPP-0225110). The seals were mildly sedated with
ketamine (1.5 mg/kg, [1]), weighed with a hanging digital scale (accuracy ± 0.5 kg), and muscle biopsies taken
under local anesthesia. In order to standardize our sampling, all biopsies were taken from the same location in
all age classes: the mid-belly of the muscle (1/3 of the
body length from the tail).
Muscle biopsies

Muscle samples of approximately 50 mg each were collected with a 6-mm biopsy cannula (Depuy, Warsaw,
Indiana) from the swimming (M. longissimus dorsi)
muscle of the seals. Muscle samples were placed in
Qiagen “RNA later” and refrigerated overnight. The
samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80°C until analysis.
RNA isolation

Samples intended for micro-array analysis were sorted
into Tripure (Gibco) to maximize RNA recovery. Total
RNA was prepared following standard protocols then
treated with Dnase I using the RNeasy column purification system (Qiagen). A portion of the total RNA was
hybridized to micro-array chips (Affymetrix Human 2.0
gene chip) and analyzed using Affymetrix software.
Overview of the analysis pipeline

The general overview of the analysis pipeline is given in
Figure 1. Our pipeline includes most of the standard analysis steps, with a few important differences. First of all,
we extended the pipeline to maximize the advantage of
pathway analysis. In addition, the genes important for
understanding the biological processes involved in metastatic transformation were not selected based solely on
the difference in the signal emitted by the microarray
probes. Instead, we concentrated on the “group behavior”
of the genes, including their ability to interact and
the pre-existing annotation which places the genes into
the same biological pathway, thereby linking them to the

same cellular function. Thus, the inference (or selection
of potentially meaningful differentially expressed genes)
was done using very liberal selection criteria and was not
adjusted for multiple testing. We selected a large list of
potentially differential genes with the potential to contain
a large number of false-positives. Then we selected biological pathways, molecular functions, and GO terms
which were statistically over-represented in the initial
intensity-based list. This procedure is part of the standard toolbox in the GeneGo MetaCore software package.
The benefits of using pathways and ontological analyses
of the microarray data have been presented previously
[9,10]. The significance of biological pathways was estimated by using a variation of Fisher’s exact test as implemented in GeneGo’s MetaCore software suite, and then
adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg
FDR analysis (which is also a built-in function of the
GeneGo Metacore software). Single genes that do not
map into any statistically significant pathway (i.e. missing
all regulators, downstream targets, ligands, and other
components necessary for a functional molecular
mechanism) may be still considered to be significant if
they are reproducible and can be independently validated
in additional experiments. Our approach relies on the
collective effects of groups of genes which are interlinked
by functional relationships. This approach may be inapplicable to a number of genes which lack information on
function, regulation, and interaction with other genes.
Pre-processing and Normalization

The summation of intensity values and the determination of presence/absence calls were performed using the

DChip2006 software http://www.dchip.org {Cheng Li,
Wing Hung Wong 2001). In addition, the data were
normalized using a quantile algorithm similar to the one
−
described by Bolstad et al. [11]: x norm = F2 1(G( x))
where F is the distribution function of the actual sample, and G is the reference distribution function. Reference distribution is an average of sample distribution for
the entire data set. Bolstad et al. suggest, but do not elaborate on, an additional smoothing procedure for the
sample distribution. In the case of remote cross-species
hybridization we observed fewer spots/probesets with a
detectable signal and large numbers of probesets emitting a signal no higher than the background noise level.
The actual reference distribution is built on a relatively
small number of meaningful probesets and by using a
very limited number of replicates. Under such circumstances smoothing becomes important, so to ensure
smoothing we used a seven-point Savitzky-Golay algorithm [12]. We applied our own C++ software for normalization, which is available from A. Ptitsyn upon
request. Box-plots for pre-normalized and normalized
expression value distributions are shown in the Supplemental Figure 1 (inside Additional File 1).

Preliminary selection of differentially expressed genes

A set of differentially expressed genes was selected using
the University of Pittsburgh Gene Expression Data Analysis suite (GEDA, http://bioinformatics.upmc.edu/GE2/
GEDA.html). For selection, we applied the standard J5
metric with threshold 4 and optional 4 iterations of the
Jackknife procedure to reduce the number of false-positive

Ptitsyn et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:133
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/133

differential genes [13]. This step corresponds to the “Computational Validation” step of the pipeline in Figure 1.
Both the J5 metric and the threshold parameter are standard pre-set values recommended by the developers. We
did not attempt to estimate the confidence level of individual genes. In addition, we didn’t use J5 as a statistical
test, but as a selection procedure for providing a shortlist
of genes which deviated from the expected average value
and were enriched with differential genes. The MA plot
showing the selected differential genes is presented in Supplemental Figure 2 (inside Additional File 1). The complete annotated lists for the analyzed data sets are given in
the Supplemental Table 1 (inside Additional File 1).
Functional annotation and pathway analysis

Analysis of biological pathways was performed using the
MetaCore software (GeneGo Inc.) licensed through the
Colorado State University Center for Bioinformatics.
Validation of Microarray expression data

Five protein spots identified from the primary swimming
muscle (Longissimus dorsi) in pup and adult 2 D gels
match trends shown in microarray data. The results are

presented in Figure 2. The samples are taken from
two animals not used in microarray study. Each identification includes the accession number for the MASCOT
database and the MASCOT statistical score. Spot densities were quantified using Delta2 D (version 3.6)
software.

Results and discussion
Since the development and application of species-specific
custom arrays is, in our case, impractical, and since deep
transcriptome analysis with next-generation sequencing
technology is financially prohibitive; the only option for
large-scale transcription profiling is cross-species hybridization using one of the existing microarray platforms.
Among species for which gene expression microarrays
are available on the market, the nearest evolutionary
neighbor to the Weddell seal is the dog (Canis familiaris). However, there are some obvious disadvantages in
using, for example, Affymetrix canine expression microarrays in our study. First, there is no reason to expect a
high degree of conservation among seal mRNAs and
Affymetrix canine probe sequences. Large numbers of
Affymetrix microarray probes are derived from target

sequences, which in turn are derived from EST clusters.
It is widely accepted that expression microarrays, including the Affymetrix canine GeneChip, are biased towards
the representation of the 3’ untranslated region (UTR).
Unlike exons, UTRs, and 3’ UTR in particular, are less
conserved and tend to diverge, even in closely related
species, with a greater divergence in distantly related

dogs and seals. Second, Canis familiaris is not a popular
model organism for most molecular biology studies and
little specific information is available about canine gene
function, regulation, and interaction. The available functional annotations for gene products represented on the
Affymetrix canine microarray are modest compared to
mouse or human microarrays. The study conducted with

canine microarrays would still rely on the gene interaction and biological pathways data acquired in studies on
mice, rats, and humans; as well as the pathway databases
for human and most common model organisms. Such a
study would also have to rely on a hybridization signal
from the subset of probes targeting the more conservative coding section of the genes represented on the
microarray. The annotation of human expression arrays
is far superior, so why not use the microarrays for these
model organisms directly? There is a certain risk that,
between distantly related species, there might be an
insufficient number and length of conservative sequences
to provide an informative signal. However, the list of differentially expressed genes for which cross-species hybridization is successful would be directly admissible to the
latest pathway analysis software.

The Affymetrix U133 human expression microarray
has yielded in excess of 10,000 probesets (transcripts)
called “present” by the DChip program on each chip. As
many as 7,664 probesets were present on all the chips
used for the experiments. For further analysis we used
only genes (probesets) present on all chips. Since we
have a very limited number of replicates and hybridized
evolutionally divergent mRNA on a human chip we
expect a significant occurrence of imperfect hybridization and cross-hybridization. In cases where the signal is
low it is hard to determine whether the gene is inactive,
expressed at a low level, or simply does not match the
probes which are designed for human genes. In this case
a standard Affymetrix “absent” call may indicate either
absence of a particular gene product or insufficient affinity of the probe due to inter-species differences. Thus,

limiting the scope to only probes which perform well
and which have a quantifiable signal is a reasonable
sacrifice in order to produce more meaningful and
reproducible results.
The immediate observation from the preliminary survey of functional annotation and ontology for the
detected expressed genes is that, at the very least, the
pattern of gene expression is typical for a skeletal muscle tissue. Our previous research has found a significant
increase in Type IIA fibers, changes in myoglobin concentration and aerobic efficiency in the skeletal muscles
of adult seals as compared to pups and juveniles. In
addition, we have shown that these adaptations are associated with changes in calcium signaling [1]. For the
pilot “proof of concept” hybridization on the human
U133 microarray we have used 3 biological replicates of
adult muscle tissue. Further experiments which compare
patterns of gene expression between different ages are
also dominated by the genes and pathways typical for
skeletal muscle; which supports the thesis that seal
mRNAs not only hybridize on human microarrays, but
reflect the underlying biology of the tissue samples (see
Table 1).
Analysis of canonic biological pathways, statistically
overrepresented among differentially expressed genes,
reveals a number of prominent biological pathways.
Table 1 shows ten of the most significantly overrepresented pathways (see complete list in Supplemental
Table 2, inside Additional File 1). As was expected from
the previous studies on the muscle physiology of Weddell seals [1], the group of pathways most affected by
age and lifestyle transformation is associated with cytoskeleton remodeling - the production of different types
of muscle fibers and related signaling pathways. We
have compared pairs of age groups (adults vs. newborn
pups, adults vs. juveniles, and juveniles vs. newborn)
and generated three lists of differentially expressed
genes. These genes were found to be overlapping, with
approximately half of the differential genes found on all
three lists. This means that, in most cases, the difference
in the patterns of gene expression between ages can be
explained by the quantitative difference in activity,
rather than the turning on or off behavior of certain
genes or pathways. This observation is in agreement
with previous studies and speaks in favor of gradual
adaptation rather than the complete restructuring of
metabolism with age. A Venn diagram of differential
genes is presented in Figure 3. The alternative analysis
of gene interaction within the lists of differentially
expressed genes provides additional details (Table 2,
complete lists of significant networks in Supplemental
Tables 2, 3, and 4 inside Additional File 1). The overall
pattern of changes with aging and lifestyle in seal skeletal muscle shows similarity to heart development and

involves profound changes in cytoskeleton structure and
energy metabolism. Table 2 shows the overview of differentially expressed networks of genes in most distant
groups of newborn and adult seals. Comparison of similar tables for newborn versus juvenile and juvenile versus adult seals indicates that most dramatic changes in
muscle metabolism happen between juvenile and adult
ages and associated with adaptation to deep diving
rather than aquatic life itself. Using our previous physiological studies to interpret our current data, we would
have expected the greatest differences in gene expression to occur between the adults and the other two age
classes. Based on the Venn diagram, that is exactly what
we found. The largest number of differentially expressed
genes was found between the adults and pups, followed
by the adults and juveniles and finally the smallest number of differentially expressed genes between the pups
and juveniles. Figure 3 shows a different aspect of the
age and lifestyle-related differences. When different ages

over-represented in each of the three lists, the thesis of
quantitative differences is corroborated. The set of pathways in all ages is also similar, although there is a difference in significance as estimated by GeneGo Metacore.
The p-value shown in the logarithmic scale in Figure 4
is an indicator of the signal-to-noise ratio in detecting
the activity of the pathway as an entity. Assuming that
the noise in all our age-to-age comparisons has the
same technical nature (i.e. it comes from the same

flags are attached to genes present and differentially expressed as estimated by J5 selection. Flags 1-2 correspond to comparison between
adults and juveniles (AJ); flags 2-3 correspond to comparison between adults and pups (AP); flags 5-6 correspond to comparison between pups
and juveniles (PJ). The GeneGo map legend is given in Additional File 1 (Supplemental Figure 5).

and scale, the over-representation of the p-value can be
used to estimate the relative activity of the pathway.
Subsequently, from the diagram in Figure 4 it follows
that certain pathways are significantly over-represented
in all age groups, while others differ in activity between
pups, juveniles, and adult seals. The complete diagram

of significant pathways is given in Supplemental Figure
3 (inside Additional File 1).
Most of the top ten pathways charted in Figure 4 are
different variations of the same Cytoskeleton remodeling
pathway. A general overview of the cytoskeleton remodeling is given in Figure 4 (see also map legend in Additional File 1). Based on our previous studies, we found a

significant shift in muscle fiber type, mitochondrial density, and aerobic efficiency as seals switch from being a
non-diving pup to a deep long duration diver as an
adult. For these reasons we expected to have significant
coverage of the cytoskeleton remodeling pathway, as
well as the cardiac hypertrophy pathway, due to the
importance of calcium signaling and the calcineurin
pathway in driving the majority of these adaptations.
Other pathways can be attributed to either the effects of
hypoxia (such as changes in glycolysis/glyconeogenesis)
or a general re-orientation of the energy metabolism.
One of the interesting observations is that changes in
seal skeletal muscle show a significant similarity, and
have a statistically significant correlation to, the changes
documented for human heart hypertrophy. A map of
the gene interactions implicated in human heart hypertrophy, overlapped with the pattern of gene expression
changes observed in Weddell seals, is given in Supplemental Figure 4 (inside Additional File 1). Like on
Figure 5, individual differentially expressed genes are
marked with indicators of scale and direction of change.
This map is one of the disease pathway template maps
from the GeneGo Metacore database.
Our study demonstrates that, in spite of the sacrificed
specificity, distant and even cross-species hybridization
reflects changes in muscle physiology. The cross-species
application of expression microarrays is equivalent to
the application of poor quality microarrays. However,
the loss of specificity for individual probes and whole
probesets can be compensated for by analysis of the biological pathways. Considering genes jointly in the context of the interaction, as opposed to the more
traditional independent ‘one gene at a time’ approach,
mitigates the effect of the missing probes and poor
hybridization. Our analysis of how gene expression patterns change with the age and lifestyle of Weddell seals
has identified major restructuring in cytoskeleton, calcium signaling, and major metabolic pathways. It seems
possible that further studies on metabolic and structural
transformation of muscle in seals may provide valuable
insight into human muscle disorders.
This study is an ongoing project, and we are at the
very beginning of the process. Further work will be
needed to elucidate the fine species-specific details of
gene interaction and to pinpoint the switches guiding
the process of the metabolic and structural transformation of skeletal muscle. With more sample studies we
might be able to make more quantitative estimations
to replace the coarse-grained patterns which provide
rough indications of the direction of change and the
groups of genes/molecular functions/pathways affected.
The comparative analysis of dynamic changes in transcription patterns creates the potential for new
research on the evolution of large taxons, thereby

branching into a radically different habitat. The most
important lesson in methodology from our study is
that the combination of genomics, physiology, systems
biology, and computational analysis is capable of overcoming the shortcomings of each individual methodology when used in isolation and is able to produce
viable results.
