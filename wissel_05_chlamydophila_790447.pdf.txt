Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniaerat type II pneumocytesTLR4NF-κBcytokines

Abstract
Background: The role of alveolar type II cells in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity is unclear. Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) have been implicated in host defense. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether Chlamydophila
pneumoniae (I) alters the expression of TLR2 and/orTLR4 in type II cells in a (II) Rho-GTPase- and (III) NF-κB-dependent
pathway, subsequently (IV) leading to the production of (IV) pro-inflammatory TNF-α and MIP-2.
Methods: Isolated rat type II pneumocytes were incubated with C. pneumoniae after pre-treatment with calcium chelator
BAPTA-AM, inhibitors of NF-κB (parthenolide, SN50) or with a specific inhibitor of the Rho-GTPase (mevastatin). TLR2 and
TLR4 mRNA expressions were analyzed by PCR. Activation of TLR4, Rac1, RhoA protein and NF-κB was determined by
Western blotting and confocal laser scan microscopy (CLSM) and TNF-α and MIP-2 release by ELISA.
Results: Type II cells constitutively expressed TLR4 and TLR2 mRNA. A prominent induction of TLR4 but not TLR2 mRNA
was detected after 2 hours of incubation with C. pneumoniae. The TLR4 protein expression reached a peak at 30 min, began
to decrease within 1–2 hours and peaked again at 3 hours. Incubation of cells with heat-inactivated bacteria (56°C for 30 min)
significantly reduced the TLR4 expression. Treated bacteria with polymyxin B (2 µg/ml) did not alter TLR4 expression. C.
pneumoniae-induced NF-κB activity was blocked by TLR4 blocking antibodies. TLR4 mRNA and protein expression were
inhibited in the presence of BAPTA-AM, SN50 or parthenolide. TNF-α and MIP-2 release was increased in type II cells in
response to C. pneumoniae, whereas BAPTA-AM, SN50 or parthenolide decreased the C. pneumoniae-induced TNF-α and
MIP-2 release. Mevastatin inhibited C. pneumoniae-mediated Rac1, RhoA and TLR4 expression.
Conclusion: The TLR4 protein expression in rat type II cells is likely to be mediated by a heat-sensitive C. pneumoniae protein
that induces a fast Ca2+-mediated NF-κB activity, necessary for maintenance of TLR4 expression and TNF-α and MIP-2 release
through possibly Rac and Rho protein-dependent mechanism. These results indicate that type II pneumocytes play an important
role in the innate pulmonary immune system and in inflammatory response mechanism of the alveolus.

Background
The lung represents a site for the invasion of various bacteria or bacterial products. Along with alveolar macrophages, pulmonary epithelial cells are the first cells to be
challenged by pathogenic microorganisms. The gram-negative bacterium Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) is an obligate intracellular
pathogen causing acute and chronic pneumonia [1,2].
The Toll-like receptor (TLR)-family is an integral part of
the innate immune system and recognizes conserved
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on
microorganism. The interaction of TLRs with pathogen
components initiates a signaling cascade that activates the
adaptive immune response mechanisms which subsequently lead to inflammatory response and to the elimination of the pathogen [3].
TLRs are mainly expressed in professional immune cells in
the alveolus. However, TLRs have also been found on type
II pneumocytes [4-6] and could thus play an important
role in the innate immune response at the alveolar surface
area.
It is assumed that different TLRs recognize different classes
of PAMPs [7]. TLR2 recognizes lipoproteins, peptidglycans and lipoteichoic acid. TLR4 is the receptor for
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates the LPS signal
transduction together with other molecules such as CD14,
MD-2, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and so
on [8].
Heat-shock protein (HSP) is one of the most phylogenetically conserved proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
[9]. Recent studies suggest, that chlamydial HSP stimulates innate immune and inflammatory responses by a
TLR-mediated pathway, that is independent from LPS
[10,11].
Recognition of PAMPs by TLR results in early host defense
as well as in the activation of an inflammatory response
pathway that involves mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB). Furthermore, recognition of PAMPs induces the production of
cytokines and stimulates the maturation of antigen-presenting cells [8,3].
Type II pneumocytes are responsible for the metabolism
of alveolar surfactant and have recently been suggested to
play an important role in the inflammatory response of
the lung. Little is known about events that are induced by
an interaction of bacteria with type II cells. We have
recently shown that the contact of C. pneumoniae with
microvilli of type II cells induces changes in cytoskeleton
and leads to activation of NF-κB pathway [12]. Here, we

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/51

tested whether C. pneumoniae stimulates expression of
TLR2 and/orTLR4 in type II cells to induce the production
of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and chemokine
MIP-2 via Rho-GTPase-and NF-κB-dependent pathways.
The identification of the involved pathways is essential for
the understanding of the innate immune defense mechanisms and pulmonary inflammatory response of the
alveolus.

Methods
Cell culturing
C. pneumoniae strain TW183 was cultured and purified as
described previously [13]. Briefly TW183 was grown to
high titers in cycloheximide-treated HEp-2 cells. Infected
monolayers were harvested from culture flasks and sonicated for 30 sec. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Titer determination
in cycloheximide-treated HEp-2 cells was performed with
a thawed aliquot (in triplicate). Aliquots diluted with an
equal volume of sucrose-phosphate-glutamate buffer supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) were stored
at -80°C until use. C. pneumoniae concentrations used
were expressed as inclusion forming units (IFU)/ml. Type
II pneumocytes were isolated from the lungs of adult male
Wistar rats (body weight 120–140 g) according to Dobbs
et al. [14].

Rat alveolar macrophages were separated from bronchial
lavage fluid. The lungs were lavaged six times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2 mM EGTA
(ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid). Cells were then collected
by centrifugation at 230 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was
re-suspended in modified Eagle medium (MEM) (PAA
laboratories GmbH, Linz, Austria).
Isolated type II cells were pre-incubated with the following substances: mevastatin (10 µM), also known as compactin, a specific inhibitor of the Rho-GTPase family; the
calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (5 µM); SN50 (50 µg/ml), a
cell-permeable peptide that inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-κB/Rel complexes; SN50M (50 µg/ml), a cellpermeable control peptide; parthenolide (25 µM), an
inhibitor of NF-κB through prevention of IκB phosphorylation (all chemicals were obtained from Calbiochem,
Darmstadt, Germany) or MEM with corresponding concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Bacteria were
treated with polymyxin obtained from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany. Thereafter, type II cells and macrophages
in MEM in absence of FCS were incubated with or without
C. pneumoniae with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
2 (2 × 106 IFU per 1 × 106 target cells) as used in previous
experiments [12].
The viability of isolated alveolar macrophages or type II
cells was assessed by trypan blue staining and was more

than 95% or 98% respectively and remained above 94%
after cell incubation with or without C. pneumoniae and
different inhibitors.

Cell purity, estimated by hematoxylin staining, was more

RNA extraction and Semi-Quantitative Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR)
Cellular RNA was extracted from 5 × 105 type II cells using
an RNeasy™ extraction kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to the manufacturers instructions. RNA concentration was quantified by determining optical density at
260 and 280 nm (Ultraspec 2000 Spectrophotometer,
Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) and adjusted to
100 pg/µl.

Semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to
assess TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression under different
conditions in rat alveolar type II cells. The mRNA expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 genes were determined in
total RNA from pooled samples of three independent
experiments. Reverse transcription (RT) of 1 µg RNA into
cDNA was performed by using random hexamers, AMV
reverse transcriptase and 1× PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCL,
pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl, 100 µg/ml bovine
serum albumin). RT was performed at 42°C for 30 min
followed by 95°C for 5 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase enzyme. The cDNA was amplified by PCR in a
total volume of 50 µl using 2.5 U Ampli-Taq DNA
polymerase, 100 µM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, 50 µM dTTP and
0.5 µM of each primer in 1× PCR buffer. Incorporation of
digoxigenin was performed by addition of 10 µM digoxigenin-11-dUTP to the PCR reaction mixture. For GAPDH
housekeeping gene, PCR was performed with 25 cycles of
1 minute each at 95°C, 54°C and 72°C in a microprocessor-driven thermal cycler (Fa. Landgraf, Hannover, Germany). For TLR2 and TLR4 amplification, PCR was
performed with 35 or 40 cycles of 1 minute each at 95°C,
65°C and 72°C.
Primer sequences for GAPDH were (GenBank BC059110;
product size 303 bp):
5'-CAG TGC CAG CCT CTG CTC AT and
ATA CTC AGC ACC AGC ATC AT-3'.
Primer sequences for rat TLR2 were (GenBank AY151255;
product size 199 bp):
5'-GTC CAT GTC CTG GTT GAC TGG and
GAT ACC ACA GCC CAT GGA AAT-3'.

AGC AAG GAC TTC TCC ACT TTC T-3'.
Products were stained with ethidium bromide and electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel. The PCR products were transferred to nylon membranes by capillary
blotting using 20× SSC as blotting buffer. The nylon membranes were fixed by UV light and the digoxigenin-UTP
that had been incorporated into the PCR products was visualized by staining with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase [15]. Luminescence of the
substrate (Lumigen™ PPD) was documented by short
exposure to X-ray film.
Densitometric calculations of digital film images were
performed with the analysis program Scion Image (Scion
Corporation, Frederick, MD).
Western blot analysis
Isolated type II cells were incubated with C. pneumoniae
in suspension. Nuclear and cytoplasmatic extracts and
membrane fractions were prepared from cells as reported
previously [16,17]. The protein content of nuclear, cytoplasmatic and membrane fraction extracts was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin
(BSA) as a standard method (Bio-Rad Laboratories protein assay kit, Richmond, USA). Protein fractions were
stored at -80°C. TLR4 protein was assayed in membrane
and cytoplasmatic extracts, IκBα protein in cytoplasmatic
extracts, NF-κB p65 protein in nuclear extracts and Rac1
and RhoA protein in membrane extracts of type II cells by
Western blotting. Proteins (40 µg or 60 µg for TLR4, 40 µg
for IκBα, 10 µg for p65 and 40 µg for Rac1 and RhoA)
from each sample were mixed with 2 × sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, heated at 95°C for 5 minutes,
and separated by 10% (TLR4, p65), 12.5% (IκBα) and
15% (Rac1 and RhoA) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 10%
nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffer saline (TBS)-0.05% Tween.
Goat IgG anti-TLR4 (L-14) sc-16240, mouse monoclonal
IgG anti-IκBα (H-4) sc-1643, rabbit IgG anti-NF-κB p65
(C-20) sc-372, goat IgG anti-Rac1 (T-17) sc-6084 and rabbit IgG anti-RhoA (119) sc-179 antibodies (from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) were used for
primary detection. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG,
anti-mouse IgG and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Dianova,
Hamburg, Germany) were employed for secondary detection. The specific protein bands were visualized on film by
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc, Piscataway, NJ) according to the

manufacturers. The bands were quantified by scanning
densitometry using a GS-710 Imaging Densitometer (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
All other standard reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from different suppliers.
Immunocytochemistry and CLSM
The isolated type II cells were plated on glass cover slips
for 3 hours at 37°C.

For TLR4-binding experiments, type II cells were incubated with and without C. pneumoniae for 10 min at
37°C, washed and then without permeabilization incubated with goat anti-TLR4 antibody for 60 min at 22°C.
Cells were pre-incubated with or without drugs or with
corresponding concentrations of DMSO and incubated
with C. pneumoniae as described by Wissel et al. [12,18].
Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde/250 mM Hepes
(pH 7.4) and permeabilized with 0.04% saponin. For
staining of TLR4 cells were incubated with goat anti-TLR4
antibody for 20 hours at 4°C. In experiments designed to
block NF-κB activity, type II cells were pre-incubated with
20 µg/ml anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody (HTA125, preservative free) or isotype control antibody (QBIOGENEALEXIS GmbH, Grünberg, Germany) for 30 min at 37°C
before incubation with C. pneumoniae for 60 min at
37°C. To stain the NF-κB subunits within the cells, the
following antibodies were used: mAb anti-IκBα and mAb
anti-NF-κB p65 subunit, recognizing predominantly p65
only when IκBα is not bound to p65 (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany) and incubated for 20 hours at 4°C. For
staining of Rac1 and Rho protein cells were incubated
with goat anti-Rac1 and rabbit anti-RhoA antibody for 2
hours at 22°C. After washing steps in PBS, cells were incubated with one of the following secondary antibodies:
Alexa® 488 or Alexa® 594 anti-goat IgG, anti-mouse IgG
labeled with Alexa® 488 or Alexa® 594, or with anti-rabbit
IgG labeled with Alexa® 594 (Molecular Probes Europe BV,
Leiden, Netherlands) for 2 hours at 22°C. To study the Factin cytoskeleton, Alexa® 488-conjugated phalloidin
(Molecular Probes) was used (2 hours at 22°C). Nuclear
DNA was stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (Molecular Probes) for 20 minutes.
For TLR4-binding experiments samples were analyzed
with a Leica CLSM (Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), equipped with a krypton-argon laser as
described previously [18]. Images were captured with a
NPL Fluotar 40×/1.3 oil immersion objective. To visualize
the cell boundaries, images were recorded simultaneously
with bright-field contrast in relation with the channel system of CLSM in the equatorial plane of cells.

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/51

The triple staining was analyzed with a Zeiss laser scanning microscope LSM 510 META with Axiovert 200 M
(Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany) as described previously [12]. Images were taken using a Plan-Apochromat
63×/1.4 oil immersion objective and fluorescence excitation at 488 nm (30 mW Ar-Laser), 543 nm (1 mW HeNeLaser) and 405 nm (Diode Laser). To minimize signal
crosstalk, a sequential scan with fast change of excitation
lines was performed.
The semi-quantitative estimation of NF-κB subunits was
made according to the methods described previously by
Wissel et al. [12] and analyzed with Zeiss LSM 510 system
with Axiovert microscope as described above. Thirty randomly chosen cells from six different regions were analyzed. Confocal settings were optimized and maintained
for all images. Images were recorded with a scanning
speed at 8s/frame with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels.
Serial sections of cells (z stack) at a depth of 0.5 µm were
performed. Fluorescence intensity was determined on
confocal images using a computer-based image analysis
system equipped with MetaView™ software (obtained
from Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany) by
measuring the average intensity per pixel within a fixedarea circle placed over the relevant area of the cell.
TNF-α ELISA and MIP-2 ELISA
Three-hour adherent type II cells and macrophages (2 ×
106 cells/ml) on plastic dishes were incubated with or
without C. pneumoniae for different periods of time.
Adherent type II cells were pre-incubated with BAPTA/
AM, SN50, SN50M or parthenolide followed by incubated
with C. pneumoniae for 3 to 6 hours. Cell culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for TNF-α and MIP-2
secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). The levels of TNF-α production were determined
using rat TNF-α Quanticine ELISA (R&D Systems Inc,
Minneapolis, USA). MIP-2 concentration in the samples
was determined using rat MIP-2 ELISA kit (Biosource
Europe, Nivelles, Belgium) following the manufacturer' s
instructions.
Statistics
Statistical comparisons were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent Fisher's protected least
significant difference (PLSD) test. The level of significance
was set at p < 0.05.

Results
C. pneumoniae increase the expression of TLR4 mRNA but
not of TLR2 mRNA
Incubation of rat type II pneumocytes with C. pneumoniae was associated with an increased expression of TLR4
mRNA (Figure 1). The mRNA concentration for TLR4
roughly doubled after 2 hours of incubation with C.

pneumoniae compared to non-infected controls. The
ratio between TLR4 mRNA signal and GAPDH signal was
0.8 in control type II cells and 1.4 after 2 hours of treatment with C. pneumoniae.
In contrast, 2 hours of incubation did not affect TLR2
mRNA expression, the ratio of TLR2 mRNA and GAPDH
signal was 1.3 in control and 1.1 in C. pneumoniae
treated cells (Figure 1).
The density of the shown GAPDH bands was homogenous for both infected and non-infected type II cells. The
second GAPDH band showed a 0.89-fold expression compared to the first band.
Effect of C. pneumoniae on TLR4 protein expression
To test whether C. pneumoniae contact rapidly increases
the TLR4 protein expression and whether newly synthesized TLR4 protein is required, we first characterized C.
pneumoniae-mediated TLR4 protein expression time-

dependent in isolated rat type II cells. The presence of
TLR4-protein was confirmed by Western blotting in noninfected and in type II cells after 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes incubation with C. pneumoniae (Figure 2A and 2B).
As quantified by scanning the chemiluminescence's bands
from four different experiments. The TLR4 protein expression was highest at 30 and 180 min (1.6-fold increase versus control cells). After 60 min and 120 min incubation
with C. pneumoniae the TLR4 expression did not differ
from non-infected cells. These two peeks suggest that after
30 min contact with C. pneumoniae TLR4 protein is
expressed constitutively at a post-transcriptional level
whereas 3 hours incubation with bacteria mediated newly
synthesized TLR4 protein expression.
TLR4 protein was only detectable with a goat polyclonal
anti-TLR4 antibody (L-14), mapping an epitope within
the extra cellular domain.
Distribution of TLR4 in type II cells
Confocal imaging revealed rapid recycling of TLR4 from
cytoplasm to the cell surface in response to C. pneumoniae incubation.

Binding-assays with C. pneumoniae incubation of type II
cells demonstrated a TLR4 expression on the external
membrane of the cells but not on non-infected cells (Figure 3A).
Time-dependent incubation with and without C. pneumoniae at 37°C, that was followed by fixation and permeabilization of the cells, revealed a TLR4 mobilization from
the cytoplasm to the external cell surface that reached a
peak value between 10–30 min after challenge with C.
pneumoniae. The surface TLR4 expression started to
decrease after 60 min in C. pneumoniae incubated cells.
In non-infected cells TLR4 was partially co-localized with
the intact F-actin cytoskeleton close to the cell membrane.
A significant change in the F-actin cytoskeleton was found
in cells after 30 and 60 minutes of C. pneumonia incubation (Figure 3B).
Heat-inactivated C. pneumoniae have no effect on TLR4
expression
Western blot analysis was used to determine the influence
of protein components and/or LPS of C. pneumoniae on
the expression of TLR4 in type II pneumocytes (Figure 4A
and 4B). Incubation of type II cells with C. pneumoniae
for 30 min stimulated TLR4 expression 2.1-fold when
compared with non-infected controls. The TLR4 expression was significantly lower after incubation of cells with
heat-inactivated bacteria (56°C for 30 min) than after 30
min of treatment with viable C. pneumoniae. Pre-treatment of C. pneumoniae with polymyxin B (2 µg/ml) did
not alter the TLR4 expression.

The amount of cytoplasmatic IκBα and of nuclear p65 was
measured by Western blot analysis (Figure 5B and 5C). In
comparison to control cells a 4-fold decrease in the
amount of IκBα protein in the cytoplasm and a 10-fold
increase of p65 in the nucleus was found 30 min after C.
pneumoniae contact. In cells pre-treated with 20 µg/ml
anti-TLR4 (HTA) antibodies, followed by C. pneumoniae
incubation for 30 min neither C. pneumoniae-mediated
IκBα degradation in the cytoplasm nor NF-κB activation
of p65 in the nucleus was found.

Anti-TLR4 antibodies inhibit C. pneumoniae-mediated NFκB- activation
In experiments designed to block NF-κB activity, type II
cells were pre-incubated with 20 µg/ml anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibodies (HTA125 or isotype control antibody)
for 30 min and thereafter incubated with C. pneumoniae
for 30 min. The effect on IκBα and NF-κB p65 was studied
qualitatively (Figure 5A) and semi-quantitatively by
CLSM. In non-infected type II cells IκBα was found in the
cytoplasm and co-localized with the F-actin cytoskeleton.
30 min of bacterial contact caused a significant (p <
0.0001) decrease of the amount of IκBα in the cytoplasm
when compared with control cells (15.9 ± 6 vs. 90.3 ± 16).
Staining with anti-p65 antibody (recognizes p65 only
when IκBα was not bound to p65) showed almost no activation of p65 in cytoplasm and nucleus in non-infected
cells. Activated p65 was significantly (p < 0.0001)
increased in the nucleus after C. pneumoniae contact (114
± 10 vs. 6.3 ± 1.4 in control cells). Pre-treatment of cells

pneumoniae incubation prevented IκBα decrease and p65
activation. Isotype control antibody had no effect on C.

BAPTA-AM, parthenolide and SN50 suppress TLR4 mRNA
and protein
As shown in Figure 6A, mRNA expression for TLR4
approximately doubled in type II cells exposed to C. pneumoniae for 3 hours compared to controls. The TLR4
mRNA concentration remained at baseline values in
BAPTA-AM and SN50 pre-incubated type II cells followed
by 3 hours incubation with C. pneumoniae. The ratio
between TLR4 mRNA signal and GAPDH signal was 1.7 in
control cells, 1.0 in C. pneumoniae treated cells, 1.6 in
BAPTA-AM pre-treated and infected cells and 1.8 in
parthenolide pre-treated and infected cells. The density of
the shown GAPDH bands was homogenous with GAPDH
bands showing a 0.91, 0.98 and 0.84 fold expression compared to the first band, respectively.

The amount of TLR4 protein was analyzed by Western
blot (Figure 6B) and quantified by scanning the chemiluminescence's bands from three different experiments (Figure 6C). TLR4 protein expression exposed to C.
pneumoniae for 3 hours was 2.5-fold higher than in control cells. In contrast, the TLR4 protein expression in
BAPTA-AM and SN50 pre-incubated type II cells followed
by 3 hours of incubation with C. pneumoniae remained
at control levels.
C. pneumoniae-induced secretion of TNF-α and MIP-2 is
NF-κB dependent
Tables 1 and 2 show that C. pneumoniae stimulate the
release of TNF-α and MIP-2 from type II cells in a timedependent manner. TNF-α concentration in the supernatant increased after 3–6 hours incubation with bacteria,
and remained constant over the next 12 hours. The MIP-2
concentration in the supernatant continuously increased
after bacterial incubation. To rule out a stimulatory effect
due to contamination by macrophages (isolated type II
cells contain less than 10% macrophages), the release of
TNF-α and MIP-2 from isolated macrophages obtained
from rat bronchial lavage fluid was measured. As tables 1
and 2 show, an estimated contamination of 10% macrophages would not influence the TNF-α or MIP-2

Next, the Rac1, RhoA and TLR4 expression was examined
by Western blotting of the membrane fractions of cells
incubated with C. pneumoniae for 30 min in absence and

pneumoniae resulted in a greater expression of Rac1 (1.5fold), RhoA (3-fold) and TLR4 (2.5-fold) versus control

To investigate whether C. pneumoniae-mediated TLR4

Rho-GTPase activation, we examined the Rac1 and Rho
protein expression after C. pneumoniae incubation for 30
min by CLSM. C. pneumoniae resulted in an increased
expression of membrane-bound Rac1 and RhoA (Figure

Discussion
Toll like receptors are crucial in mediating cellular
responses to microbial components. The extra cellular
portion of the TLR is directly involved in the recognition
of various pathogens. C. pneumoniae are known to enter
and persist in humane type II pneumocytes in chronic but
not acute pneumonia [2]. The role of TLR in the pulmonary host defense system is unknown.
The present study on the interaction of type II pneumocytes with C. pneumoniae helps to understand the role of
TLR4 within the innate immunity and inflammatory
response mechanism of the lung. The study demonstrates
that TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA is expressed constitutively in
isolated rat type II cells. Incubation of alveolar type II cells
with C. pneumoniae for 2 hours increased TLR4 but not
TLR2 mRNA expression. Thus, TLR4 expression of rat type
II cells is highly responsive to C. pneumoniae.
TLR4 is localized in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of
type II cells. Incubation of type II cells with C. pneumoniae increased the expression of TLR4 at the external cell
membrane surface within 10–30 min. Whereas the
expression of TLR4 reached a peak value 30 min after C.
pneumoniae contact, the TLR4 expression was less prominent after 60–120 min of incubation. An incubation time
of 180 min was again associated with a high TLR4
expression. The data suggests, that constitutively
expressed TLR4 in type II pneumocytes is rapidly responding to C. pneumoniae contact and mediates cellular
responses to C. pneumoniae components at a post-transcriptional level. Thus, it seems as if C. pneumoniae is
captured by constitutively expressed receptors very rapidly. To enable further binding of C. pneumoniae components, newly synthesized TLR4 is required. The decreased
TLR4 expression due to C. pneumoniae binding at the cel-

expression could represent a barrier to prevent uncontrolled stimulation.
Various studies show that TLR4 is constitutively expressed
in distinct human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates the activation of
TLR4 signaling in human alveolar type II-like (A549) and
tracheo-bronchial (BEAS-2B, 16-HBE, and NT-1) epithe-

lial cell lines [6]. Furthermore, LPS increased the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA and protein in human
primary type II pneumocytes [5]. In normal human lung
TLR2 mRNA and protein is mainly expressed in type II
cells [4]. Whereas TLR4 is generally believed to be the
receptor that mediates LPS responses [19], TLR2 mediates
the inflammatory response to components of gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria. However, TLR2 also mediates LPS-induced cellular signaling [20]. Different cells are

activated by C. pneumoniae or cellular chlamydial
components in a TLR2 and/or TLR4-dependent pathway
[10,11,21-23].
Our data demonstrate that the TLR4 protein expression in
rat type II cells is independent of chlamydial LPS. In addition, our results with heat-inactivated bacteria implicate
that TLR4 expression is most likely mediated by a heatsensitive chlamydial protein. C. pneumoniae and LPS free
components of chlamydial heat shock protein 60
(cHSP60) were described to trigger inflammatory and
cytokine responses in a TLR2-or TLR4-dependent way
[10,21,23,24]. It can be speculated that the TLR ligand is
a protein component of the outer membrane of C. pneumoniae, with cHSP60 being a possible candidate.
One regulator of TLR signaling is the NF-κB transcription
factor, which controls the expression of many genes
involved in the inflammatory response [3]. In vivo studies
showed, that LPS induces NF-κB activation of type II cells
[25,26]. The interaction of TLR2 and TLR4 with HSP60
triggers a signal cascade of protein kinase p38 and JNK1/
2, mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and IκB
kinase (IKK) [11,27,28], that subsequently leads to NF-κB
activation. We have recently shown that C. pneumoniae
contact with the type II cell membrane activates the NF-κB
pathway [12]. In the present study blockade of the TLR4
receptor at the cell membrane level reduced the C. pneumoniae-induced NF-κB activation in type II cells. Thus,
results are in accordance with studies on mouse
macrophages and human endothelial cells showing, that
activation of NF-κB by chlamydial heat shock protein 60
(cHSP60) requires TLR4 [10].
We demonstrate that C. pneumoniae-mediated TLR4
mRNA and protein expression is attenuated by the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM and by inhibition of nuclear
factor NF-κB with parthenolide or SN50. LPS-mediated
TLR2 mRNA up-regulation in murine alveolar macrophages was attenuated by inhibition of NF-κB with sulfasalazine or SN50 [29].
BAPTA-AM, SN50 and parthenolide inhibited C. pneumoniae-mediated TNF-α and MIP-2 release in rat type II
pneumocytes. It can be concluded that the calcium-mediated NF-κB activation is required for the transcriptional
induction of TNF-α and MIP-2. Our findings support the
idea that contact of C. pneumoniae with TLR4 triggers signal transduction and cytokine release. Contact of C. pneumoniae with TLR2 and TLR4 bone marrow-derived
murine dendritic cells (BMDDC) leads to the
translocation of NF-κB as well as secretion of TNF-α
[22,24]. HSP60 from C. pneumoniae causes a TLR2-and
TLR4-dependent increase in serum levels of MIP-2 in mice
[11].

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/51

Intrapulmonary administration of Haemophilus influenzae in the mouse leads to TLR4-mediated TNF-α and MIP2 expression by an activation of the NF-κB pathway in epithelial cells of the conducting airways. This suggests that
the airway epithelia contribute to recognition of H. influenzae infection and induction of the innate immune
response [30]. The role of alveolar type II cells in the regulation of lung inflammation is less clear. In vitro studies
suggest that LPS-treatment of primary cultured type II cells
from adult rat lungs leads to a TNF-α release, which initiates the synthesis and release of chemokines like MIP-2.
Subsequently, the recruitment of inflammatory cells into
the lung is promoted. These data indicate that a direct
bacterial stimulation of alveolar epithelial cells can initiate the local host defense [31-33].
Recently, we demonstrated that NF-κB activation is
involved in the calcium-mediated reorganization of the Factin cytoskeleton after C. pneumoniae contact [12]. LPS
induces the depolymerization of the cytoskeleton by
mediating the TNF-α production in alveolar type II cells
and may thus facilitate the migration of inflammatory
cells [32]. Small GTPases of the Rho family (Rac and Rho)
play an important role in several signal networks including actin cytoskeleton dynamics, transcriptional regulation, and membrane trafficking [34]. RhoA controls the
assembly of actin and myosin stress fibers. Rac1 regulates
the formation of membrane ruffles [35]. Data of the
present study demonstrate that C. pneumoniae-induced
TLR4 activation is Rac1 and RhoA protein mediated.
Mevastatin, a specific inhibitor of the Rho-GTPase family,
reduced the C. pneumoniae-mediated activation of TLR4,
Rac1 and RhoA protein. In dendritic cells, TLR activation
stimulates the antigen capture via F-actin remodeling
[36]. Mevastatin (compactin) blocked the invasion of C.
pneumoniae in Hep2 cells [37]. C. pneumoniae infection
of vascular smooth muscle cells increased Rac1 and RhoA
proteins and NF-κB expression that was suppressed by statin [38]. These results suggest a signaling cascade by which
C. pneumoniae contact with the cell membrane leads to
the activation of Rho family GTPases. The subsequent
changes in actin cytoskeletal structure are essential for
TLR4 expression and the activation of the NF-κB signaling
pathway. The latter controls the expression of many genes
involved in the innate immune system and adaptive
inflammatory immune response.
We have recently shown, that C. pneumoniae changes the
cytoskeleton of type II pneumocytes by NF-κB activation
[12]. The current work demonstrates that NF-κB activation induces an inflammatory cascade that could support
the local host defense. In healthy lungs, the pulmonary
surfactant represents a barrier that can prevent the invasion of bacteria. However, C. pneumoniae inhibits the
surfactant metabolism of isolated type II cells [18]. Thus,

C. pneumoniae induce an immune response that prevents
the invasion of C. pneumoniae into type II cells. Simultaneously, the impaired surfactant metabolism will enable
bacteria to enter type II cells. The resulting net effect
remains to be studied in vivo. Clinical data show, that no
intracellular C. pneumoniae are found in patients with
acute pneumonia, but in patients with chronic pneumonia [2]. It could be assumed that C. pneumoniae-induced
alterations of type II cell cytoskeleton and surfactant
metabolism will impair the host defense. Subsequently,
more type II cells are invaded by C. pneumoniae, causing
the clinical picture of chronic pneumonia.

Conclusion
The TLR4 protein expression in rat type II cells is most
likely stimulated by a heat-sensitive C. pneumoniae
protein. The induction of a rapid Ca2+-mediated NF-κB
activity is required for TLR4 expression and TNF-α and
MIP-2release. A Rac1 and RhoA protein-dependent mechanism seems to be involved. These results implicate that
TLR4 plays an important role in the innate pulmonary
immune defense mechanism and in the inflammatory
response of the alveolus.
