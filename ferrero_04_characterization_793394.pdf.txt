Abstract
Background: The CD38 transmembrane glycoprotein is an ADP-ribosyl cyclase that moonlights
as a receptor in cells of the immune system. Both functions are independently implicated in
numerous areas related to human health. This study originated from an inherent interest in
studying CD38 in the cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis), a species closely related to humans
that also represents a cogent animal model for the biomedical analysis of CD38.
Results: A cDNA was isolated from cynomolgus macaque peripheral blood leukocytes and is
predicted to encode a type II membrane protein of 301 amino acids with 92% identity to human
CD38. Both RT-PCR-mediated cDNA cloning and genomic DNA PCR surveying were possible
with heterologous human CD38 primers, demonstrating the striking conservation of CD38 in these
primates. Transfection of the cDNA coincided with: (i) surface expression of cynomolgus macaque
CD38 by immunofluorescence; (ii) detection of ~42 and 84 kDa proteins by Western blot and (iii)
the appearance of ecto-enzymatic activity. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against the
cynomolgus CD38 ectodomain and were either species-specific or cross-reactive with human
CD38, in which case they were directed against a common disulfide-requiring conformational
epitope that was mapped to the C-terminal disulfide loop.
Conclusion: This multi-faceted characterization of CD38 from cynomolgus macaque
demonstrates its high genetic and biochemical similarities with human CD38 while the
immunological comparison adds new insights into the dominant epitopes of the primate CD38
ectodomain. These results open new prospects for the biomedical and pharmacological
investigations of this receptor-enzyme.

Background
Just over a decade after being identified as a leukocyte surface antigen with receptorial activity [1,2], CD38 was reclassified among the ADP-ribosyl (ADPR) cyclases [3,4].
These are a group of related membrane-bound or soluble
enzymes, comprising CD157 and Aplysia ADPR cyclase
[5,6], which have the unique capacity to convert NAD to
cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR) or nicotinic acid-adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), part of a new generation of endogenous activators of intracellular Ca2+ release
[6].
Human CD38 is a broadly expressed type II transmembrane glycoprotein of ~45 kDa in its monomeric form [7].
This consists of a short intracytoplasmic (IC) tail, a transmembrane domain and a major extracellular domain
(ECD) formed by 256 of the 300 constituent amino acids
of the CD38 polypeptide [7]. Homodimeric and homotetrameric forms have also been described [8,9] and a 3-D
dimer structure obtained by homology modeling to Aplysia cyclase [10]. The CD38 ECD, where both receptor and
enzymatic activities reside, harbours a 12 cysteine/6
disulfide signature common to the members of this family. According to a growing body of experimental evidence, the disulfides mediate control of the ECD
conformation and function since reduction modifies
CD38 enzymatic activity and homodimerization [11,12],
and sensitivity to proteolysis and monoclonal antibody
(mAb) binding [13].
The mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ caused by the
CD38/cADPR/NAADP axis has been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including
insulin secretion and diabetes [14], myometrial contractility and pregnancy [15], airway smooth muscle contractility and hyperreactivity [16], vascular smooth muscle
contraction [17], osteoclast activity [18], and the functions of the immune [19], renal [20] and exocrine gland
[21] systems. The assortment of effects caused by CD38
ligation and transmembrane signalling is also broad
though mostly described in hematopoietic cells, and
ranges from lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine
release [2,22-24], regulation of B and myeloid cell development and survival [25-28], inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) entry [29], to induction of
dendritic cell maturation [30]. In addition, ligation of
human pancreatic islet cells by anti-CD38 autoantibodies
induces insulin release [31]. CD38 is also a clinically useful marker of HIV infection progression [32] and therapyrequiring B-CLL [33].
In this study, we describe the molecular cloning and functional expression of CD38 from the cynomolgus
macaque. In addition, with a panel of newly-raised mAbs,
we comparatively analyse the macaque and human CD38

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2172/5/21

ECDs and identify new structural-functional characteristics of CD38 epitopes.

Results
Cloning CD38 cDNA from cynomolgus macaque
Activation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) strongly upregulates expression of CD38 in human T lymphocytes [34].
Therefore, to isolate a CD38 cDNA, PHA-activated
cynomolgus PBMC were chosen as the source of RNA for
amplification by RT-PCR using primers derived from the
human CD38 5' and 3' untranslated regions. The 1113
base-pair (bp) insert contained an open reading frame of
906 bp (Figure 1A) that was 95% identical to the human
CD38 sequence. The cDNA encodes a 301 amino acid (aa)
polypeptide with the typical CD38 type II membrane protein structure, i.e., a short cytosolic tail (residues 1–21), a
transmembrane region (residues 22–44), and an ECD
(residues 45–301) containing the signature 12-cysteine
array. Alignment of the macaque and human CD38
polypeptides showed 92% identity and 94% similarity.
There is complete conservation of the IC region while
there are five conservative changes in the transmembrane
region where macaque CD38 has one more residue than
human CD38. Macaque CD38 has four potential Nlinked glycosylation sites, as in human CD38; three are
co-linear. Furthermore, macaque CD38 shows conservation of the 4 acidic residues (Glu148, Asp149, Asp157,
Glu228) and 2 tryptophans (Trp127 and Trp191) that play a
critical role in the ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cADPR hydrolase
activities of human CD38 [35]. Lys130 is also maintained
suggesting that, like human CD38, binding of ATP to this
residue may lead to inhibition of the hydrolase activity
[36]. Likewise, macaque CD38 conserves Arg271 which is
ADP-ribosylated in human CD38, causing inactivation
[37].
Common genomic organization and regulatory features of
macaque and human CD38 genes
Human CD38 has been characterized as a single-copy, 8exon gene that spans ~70 kb [5,38] and not only CD38
but ADPR cyclase genes in general are highly conserved
from mollusks to humans [39,40]. In addition, the Southern blot hybridization patterns of macaque and human
genomic DNAs digested with EcoRI, BamHI and HindIII
and probed with their homologous CD38 cDNA are similar (data not shown), indicating that the structural organization of macaque and human CD38 is highly conserved.
This was further demonstrated by the finding that the
same primers previously used to amplify the 8 human
CD38 exons [41] also amplified 8 CD38 exons from
macaque genomic DNA. The putative macaque exons
could be perfectly aligned with their human counterparts
[5] in number, size and splice site of their exons (Table 1).
All intron-exon boundaries conformed to the GT-AG rule,

most 5' splice donor and 3' splice acceptor sequences of
the 7 introns were identical.
Transcription of TATA-boxless human CD38 initiates at
multiple start sites [5,38] while induction of gene expression by retinoids is controlled by a retinoic acid responsive element (RARE) at the beginning of intron 1 [42]. To
identify conserved cis-regulatory sequences, ~500 bp
upstream of the initiation codon ATG were amplified by
PCR from genomic DNA of cynomolgus macaque but also
from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), to strengthen the
alignment with the human CD38 promoter sequence, and
numerous conserved general and immune-related potential binding sites were found (Figure 1B). The alignment
of the 5' end of intron 1 from macaque and human CD38
shows the presence of the RARE (Figure 1C), suggesting
that this and perhaps other molecular mechanisms
involved in regulating CD38 are conserved between these
primates.
Expression of macaque CD38 reveals an active cyclase of
~42 kDa
To analyse surface expression and function of macaque
CD38, the cDNA insert was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1
expression vector and a similar construct was prepared
containing the human CD38 cDNA (see Materials & Methods). DNAs were transfected for heterologous expression
in the NIH/3T3 cell line which does not express CD38
[43]. Given that cross-reactivity of OKT10 anti-human
CD38 mAb has been exploited to detect CD38 in rhesus
macaque hematopoietic cells [44,45], clones expressing
cynomolgus CD38 were identified by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) with OKT10 (see below). The stable
cell line expressing macaque CD38 was designated NIH/
mac38, while NIH/hum38 is the human CD38-expressing
cell line.

The ecto-cyclase activity of macaque CD38 was evaluated
by incubating the NIH/mac38 clone with nicotinamide
guanine dinucleotide (NGD), an NAD analog which is
converted by ADP-ribosyl cyclases such as CD38 to cyclic
GDP ribose (cGDPR). Unlike cADPR, cGDPR is a stable,
fluorescent end-product which can be detected in cell
supernatants [46]. Increased fluorescence following incubation with NGD was detected in supernatants of
macaque and human CD38 transfectants, demonstrating
that macaque CD38 is enzymatically active (Figure 2A).
In human red blood cells (RBCs), CD38 is the only source
of ecto-cyclase activity [47] which was also found on the
surface of cynomolgus macaque RBCs (Figure 2A), suggesting a further parallel with human CD38.
To establish the approximate molecular weight of
macaque CD38, SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
were performed with lysates prepared from NIH/mac38
and NIH/hum38 cells. Blots were probed with the AT1
anti-human CD38 mAb which detected a band of ~42
kDa in both transfectants (Figure 2B).
Production of anti-macaque CD38 mAbs
To raise mouse mAbs against macaque CD38, live NIH/
mac38 cells were used for immunization. Four mAbs,
KK1B5 (IgG1), KK4E5 (IgG2a), KK6A11 (IgG2a) and
KK9H4 (IgG1) were selected for further analyses. All four
anti-macaque CD38 mAbs reacted by IF with NIH/mac38
but were negative with the parental cell line (Figure 3).
Only two mAbs (KK1B5 and KK9H4) reacted with NIH/
hum38.

The anti-macaque CD38 mAbs were further assessed by IF
for binding to cynomolgus PBMC and to SL-691 and SL999, two cynomolgus macaque B lymphoblastoid cell
lines. All four mAbs reacted with PBMC from cynomolgus
macaques, indicating they recognize native cynomolgus
CD38, and they strongly stained cells of the two B cell
lines (Table 2).
Additional Western blot analyses were carried out with
the anti-macaque CD38 mAbs. MAbs KK1B5 and KK9H4
confirmed detection of a ~42 kDa band in NIH/mac38
cell lysates but also recognized a second band of ~84 kDa.
(Figure 2C). The doublet was also identified in SL-999
cynomolgus B cells (data not shown). Instead mAbs KK4E5
and KK6A11 only recognized a band of ~84 kDa, even in
reducing conditions. No bands were detected by these
mAbs in parental NIH/3T3 cells.

(4) and human RBCs (5). Each bar represents mean ± SD; (*) means significantly higher than controls (P < 0.05, t-test, n = 3
experiments). Y axis = fluorescence emission 410 nm. B. Western blot of lysates from parental NIH/3T3 cells (NIH), NIH/
hum38 (hum38) and NIH/mac38 cells (mac38) analysed by 10% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing (NR) conditions. Blots were
probed with AT1 anti-human CD38 mAb. C. Western blot of parental NIH/3T3 and NIH/mac38 cell lysates analysed by 8%
SDS-PAGE in non-reducing (NR) or reducing (R) conditions and probed with the indicated anti-cynomolgus CD38 mAbs. In B
and C, molecular weight markers (in kDa) are indicated on the right.

Anti-macaque CD38 mAbs recognize either speciesspecific/DTT-resistant epitopes or a human cross-reactive/
DTT-sensitive epitope
The observation that mAbs KK4E5 and KK6A11 recognize
only cynomolgus CD38 while mAbs KK1B5 and KK9H4
also recognize human CD38 indicates that the two mAb
subsets are directed towards different epitopes. To
evaluate the contribution of disulfides to these epitopes,
mAb reactivity was assessed after treating NIH/mac38
with dithiothreitol (DTT). Reduction had no effect on
binding of the species-specific mAbs (KK4E5 and

KK6A11) but significantly reduced binding of mAbs
KK1B5 and KK9H4 (Figure 4A), indicating that the latter
recognize a disulfide-requiring conformational epitope of
the cynomolgus CD38 ECD, and predicting they should
recognize a similar epitope in human CD38. The results
(Figure 4B) confirm that treatment of NIH/hum38 with
DTT decreased binding of mAbs KK1B5 and KK9H4, indicating that cynomolgus macaque and human CD38 have
a conformational epitope in common.

Anti-human CD38 mAbs are also species-specific/DTTresistant or cross-reactive/DTT-sensitive
Reciprocal experiments were performed to see if the correlation between cross-reactivity and epitope sensitivity to
DTT was also valid for a panel of 6 well-known mAbs

raised against human CD38. MAbs IB4, IB6, OKT10,
SUN-4B7, AT1 and HB7 were assessed for binding to
native and DTT-treated NIH/hum38, and for cross-reactivity with cynomolgus CD38. Binding of mAbs IB4, IB6 and
HB7 to human CD38 was unaffected by DTT and none
bound cynomolgus CD38 (Figure 4C and 4D). On the
contrary, binding of mAbs OKT10, SUN-4B7 and AT1 to
human CD38 was significantly reduced by DTT and all
three mAbs bound cynomolgus CD38 (Figure 4D) in a
DTT-sensitive manner.
The epitope recognized by cross-reactive cynomolgus antiCD38 mAbs maps to the C-terminal disulfide loop
The observation that mAbs KK1B5 and KK9H4 (raised
against cynomolgus CD38) and mAbs OKT10, AT1 and
SUN-4B7 (raised against human CD38) all bind native
but not reduced cynomolgus and human CD38 is compatible with their binding the same epitope. A priori
knowledge of the human CD38 epitope map previously
established that OKT10 binding is abrogated by deletion
of one or both of the C-terminal Cys residues (Cys287 and
Cys296) predicted to pair in disulfide bond formation [48]
and that mAbs OKT10, AT1 and SUN-4B7 mutually
compete for binding to the human CD38 ECD [49]. This

Discussion
In this study, we describe the molecular cloning and functional expression of the CD38 receptor/enzyme from the
cynomolgus macaque. The cDNA described here presents
the expected homology to human CD38 considering that
the macaque-human lineages diverged some 25 million
years ago [50] and their genomes are 93–95% identical.
This homology was exploited in RT-PCR cloning and in
our genomic PCR survey of cynomolgus CD38. Indeed,
human CD38 primers proved to be equally agile with
CD38 in other members of the Primate order such as the
chimpanzee, the gibbon (Hylobates concolor) and the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) (MO, FS and SC, unpublished observations).

would position the common epitope of cynomolgus and
human CD38 in the C-terminal disulfide loop formed by
Cys288 and Cys297 in cynomolgus CD38 (Cys287/Cys296 in
human CD38).
To test this possibility, we analysed reactivity of these
mAbs with the CD38-negative MT2 human T cell line stably transfected with CD38∆285, a human CD38 deletion
mutant which lacks the 15 C-terminal amino acids and
loses OKT10 binding [29]. IF analysis demonstrates that
the 15 C-terminal amino acids of human CD38 are
required for binding of mAbs KK1B5, KK9H4 and OKT10
(Figure 5). In contrast, mAbs SUN-4B7 and AT1 maintained binding to MT2/CD38∆285 (data not shown). These
data are consistent with the presence of two close conformational epitopes in human and cynomolgus CD38: one
identified by mAbs KK1B5, KK9H4 and OKT10 located in
the last (6th) disulfide loop, the other by mAbs SUN-4B7
and AT1 mapping to the penultimate (5th) C-terminal
disulfide loop involving Cys254-Cys275 (Figure 6). Note
that human-cynomolgus CD38 amino acid sequence
identity in the 5th loop is 20/22 amino acids, and 10/10
amino acids in the 6th loop.

The conceptual translation of the cynomolgus macaque
CD38 cDNA yielded a polypeptide with the characteristic
type II structure, size, catalytic core residues and 12cysteine ECD array common to CD38 orthologs. With
respect to human CD38, cynomolgus CD38 has an extra
residue in the transmembrane domain but no difference
was found in the IC tail, where human CD38 is reported
to interact with the SH2 domain of Lck [51] in lipid rafts
[52].
Cross-reactivity of anti-human CD38 mAbs was exploited
in the initial part of the protein analyses although these
give discrepant results in binding to leukocytes from other
primates. For example, OKT10, but not Leu17 or T16,
binds bone marrow from rhesus macaques [44] whereas
HIT2 stains horse lymphocytes but not leukocytes from
baboon, cynomolgus macaque, rhesus macaque, pig,
sheep, cow, dog, cat or rabbit [53]. In addition, the behaviour of cross-reactive mAbs may not be reproducible in
another species as illustrated by anti-human CD34 mAbs:
6 out of 13 mAbs cross-reacted with cynomolgus bone
marrow but only 3 of these correctly identified the functional cynomolgus equivalent of the human progenitor
cell in clonogenic assays [54]. To avoid similar pitfalls, we
raised mAbs to macaque CD38.
The apparent molecular weight of macaque and human
CD38 were indistinguishable by SDS-PAGE. The macaque
polypeptide weighs 34.4 kDa and has four N-linked glycosylation motifs, suggesting it is probably glycosylated,
like human CD38 [55], to give rise to the 42 kDa band.
We wanted to confirm this result with anti-cynomolgus
CD38 mAbs but when lysates were probed with mAbs
KK1B5 and KK9H4, the 42 kDa band was always accompanied by an 84 kDa band, and the doublet was also
observed with lysates obtained from SL-999 macaque B
cells expressing CD38 in its native milieu. The KK4E5 and
KK6A11 mAbs instead detected only the 84 kDa band in
transfectants, and the band was unaffected by addition of
DTT. CD38 dimers and tetramers have been abundantly

reported and postulated to be formed by diverse mechanisms such as intermolecular disulfides [12,51], non-covalent association [56] and transglutamination [9].
Therefore, our interpretation of the upper band is that it
represents a CD38 dimer, possibly a non-covalently associated form compatible with lysate preparation in NP-40
detergent which stabilizes such dimers [56], or a transglutaminase-linked form. Although the data are consistent with KK4E5 and KK6A11 recognizing a unique

epitope in macaque CD38 dimers, it is also possible that
these mAbs have another unknown specificity and that
further experiments are needed to fully characterize their
specificity.
The availability of the macaque CD38 amino acid
sequence and its alignment with the human homolog
gave a new dimension to the analysis of mAb cross-reactivity and ultimately led to a better understanding of

CD38 epitopes. Macaque and human CD38 are strikingly
conserved yet only two of the four anti-macaque CD38
mAbs cross-reacted, as did only three of the six antihuman CD38 mAbs in reciprocal experiments. The key
finding was that a mAb's capacity to cross-react always
correlated with the sensitivity of its target to reduction
which, added to the prior knowledge of the human CD38
epitope map, crystal structure and active site [57], allowed
us to footprint the binding sites of cross-reactive antiCD38 mAbs.
The classification of anti-primate CD38 mAbs as speciesspecific/DTT-resistant (type I) or cross-reactive/DTT-sensitive (type II) and directed against a conformational
epitope may be of practical importance. Firstly, our results
demonstrate the necessity for careful antibody selection
when performing biological assays involving detection of
CD38 expression in circumstances of cell membrane
redox perturbation, e.g., detection of membrane CD38 in
apoptotic cells might be positive according to type I mAbs
and negative by type II (Alla Egorova, personal communication). Secondly, simultaneous use of the two types of
mAbs can provide information about CD38 expression
(type I) while the type II mAb can give indications on its
conformation. Thirdly, it is possible that potent Ca2+mobilizing agonistic mAbs are more likely to be type I
mAbs since this subgroup includes IB4, which is the only
anti-human CD38 mAb to mobilize Ca2+, and NIM-R5, a
rat anti-murine CD38 mAb [58] which also mobilizes
Ca2+ and whose binding to murine CD38 transfectants
was not affected by DTT (EF, personal communication).
Finally, autoantibodies to CD38 have been detected in
diabetes and thyroiditis and it would be interesting to
identify the epitopic culprits.

from the human CD38 sequence (GenBank accession no.
D84278): forward 5'-AGT TTC AGA ACC CAG CCA-3'
(corresponding to nt -84 to -66 upstream of the ATG initiation codon); reverse 5'-ATT GAC CTT ATT GTG GAG G3' (corresponding to nt 102–121 downstream of the TGA
stop codon). After RT for 50°C for 30 min, the cDNA was
amplified by two rounds of PCR: 5 min at 94°C, followed
by 30 (first round) or 35 (second round) cycles at 94°C
for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s and 2 min at 72°C. The product
was gel purified and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega). The inserts of three recombinant clones were
analyzed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems).
Analysis of simian genomic DNAs
Cynomolgus macaque (15 samples) and chimpanzee (5
samples) genomic DNAs were obtained as described [59].
The eight exons of the cynomolgus CD38 gene were
amplified by PCR (45 cycles, annealing temp 52°C) using
primers known to amplify human CD38 exons [41] while
the CD38 promoter of cynomolgus macaque was amplified (15 cycles annealing at 52°C, followed by 35 cycles
with 0.3°C touchdown) with a forward primer from the
human CD38 promoter (5'-GAA GAG GCA AGA AAA
GCC-3') and reverse primer chosen from macaque CD38
exon 1 (5'-AACTCG CAG TTG GCC ATA-3'). The chimpanzee CD38 promoter was amplified with the human
CD38 sequences. The 5' end of cynomolgus CD38 intron
1 was amplified (same conditions used for exon amplification but 57°C annealing and 1.5 M MgCl2) with forward primer 5'-CCG TCC TGG CAC GAT GCG TCA AG-3'
from macaque exon 1, and reverse primer 5'-ACA CCC
TCC TCC CCT ACC ACA GG-3' taken from human CD38
intron 1. Amplicons were gel purified and analysed by
automated sequencing. Alignments were performed with
CLUSTALW (ExPASy, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics).

Conclusions
Some of the essential biological features of CD38 in
Macaca fascicularis have been elucidated and new insights
obtained about the epitopic structure of the CD38 ECD.
We hope that, by providing the reagents for analysis of
CD38 in the cynomolgus macaque, this study may
expedite our understanding of the role of CD38 in human
disease.

Methods
Cynomolgus CD38 cDNA cloning
PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Amersham
Biosciences) centrifugation from whole blood obtained
from a female cynomolgus macaque housed according to
state regulations at the RBM (Ivrea, Italy). Cells were cultured in medium with 5 µg/ml PHA (Sigma-Aldrich) for
72 h, harvested and resuspended in TRIzol RNA extraction
solution (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was carried out using the

Cell lines and antibodies
NIH/3T3 murine fibroblast and COS-7 monkey kidney
cell lines were from the ATCC. Production of SL-691 and
SL-999 cynomolgus B lymphoblastoid cell lines was previously described [60]. The mutant human CD38∆285 plasmid [48] was kindly provided by Dr. Toshiaki Katada
(University of Tokyo, Japan) while the MT2∆285 transfectant was kindly provided by Dr. Umberto Dianzani (A.
Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy)
[29]. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with
10% heat-inactivated FCS, penicillin/streptomycin. The
murine anti-human CD38 mAbs AT1 (hybridoma kindly
provided by Dr. Jo Hilgers, BioProbe AV, Amstelveen, The
Netherlands), SUN-4B7, OKT10, IB4, IB6 and HB7 were
produced in-house from hybridoma culture supernatants.
CBT3G, a murine anti-human CD3 mAb, was used as IgG
control. F(ab')2 goat anti-mouse Ig-FITC was used as
secondary
antibody
(Jackson
ImmunoResearch
Laboratories).
Expression of macaque and human CD38
cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen). Stable transfected cell lines were
produced in NIH/3T3 by electroporation (250 V, 960 µF
at 20°C), selected for 3–4 weeks in G418 after which isolated clones were picked and transferred to 96-well plates.
Ecto-GDPR cyclase activity
Ecto-GDPR cyclase activity of intact cells was determined
as previously described [29,30,61]. Briefly, parental and
transfected NIH/3T3 were used at 2.5 or 5 × 105 cells/ml
in PBS. For RBCs, 420 µl packed volume were brought to
1 ml by addition of NGT buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM glucose, 10 mM Tris. Cl, pH 7.4). To 1 ml cell suspensions 10
µl 10 mM NGD (Sigma) in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4 or 10 µl
buffer (control) were added. After 30 min at 37°C, supernatants were collected after brief centrifugation. Supernatants were analysed by fluorescence spectrometer set at
excitation wavelength 300 nm and emission wavelength
410 nm. Cell lines were measured in triplicate in three
independent experiments; RBCs from two different
animals were tested once; RBCs from humans were tested
in duplicate in two independent experiments.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in NP-40 buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0%
NP-40, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors. Samples (20 µg protein/lane) were analysed by 8 or
10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Membranes were
blocked in 5% milk/TBST, incubated for 2–3 h at RT with
mAb supernatant with 1% milk, and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (PerkinElmer) followed by ECL visualization.

Production of anti-cynomolgus macaque CD38 mAbs
BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were anaesthetized with Avertin i.p. injection and immunized by intrasplenic injection with 300 µl containing 5 × 105 live NIH/
mac38 cells in PBS. Eight days later, mice received an i.p.
boost of NIH/mac38 cells, and mouse sera tested 8 days
later. The spleen of one mouse that responded to immunization was selected for fusion to P3.X63.Ag8.653
murine myeloma cell line. Hybridoma supernatants were
screened for reactivity with the immunizing cells and lack
of reactivity with the parental cell line. Positive hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution. MAbs were used in
the form of supernatants containing NaN3.
Analysis of surface CD38 expression
Surface expression of cynomolgus and human CD38 was
determined by IF. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells/sample were incubated with 100 µl mAb supernatant/NaN3 for 1 h at 4°C,
and 30 min at 4°C with FITC-labeled secondary Ab. Background fluorescence was established with control IgG
antibody. Cells were analysed immediately either by fluorescence microscope, FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(10,000 events acquired) with CellQuest software (Becton
Dickinson) or Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope
with Nomarski optics for differential interference contrast
(DIC) and FluoView 300 software.
Modulation of surface CD38 by treatment with DTT
Cells were detached with 1 mM EDTA/PBS, washed and
resuspended in complete medium at a concentration of 2
× 106 cells/ml. One hundred µl 100 mM DTT stock was
added per ml cell suspension, kept for 45 min in a 37°C
incubator and washed twice with PBS/BSA/NaN3 before
analysis.
