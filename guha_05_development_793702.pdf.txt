Abstract
Background: Characterization of molecular markers and the development of better assays for
precise and rapid detection of wildlife species are always in demand. This study describes a set of
seven novel heminested PCR assays using specific primers designed based on species-specific
polymorphism at the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene for identification of Blackbuck, Goral, Nilgai,
Hog deer, Chital, Sambar and Thamin deer.
Results: The designed heminested PCR assays are two consecutive amplifications of the
mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. In the first stage, ~550 bp region of the 16S rRNA gene was
amplified by PCR using template DNA and universal primers. In the second stage, a species-specific
internal region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the amplicon of the first PCR
along with one universal primer and another species-specific primer as the reverse or forward
primer. The amplicon generated after two consecutive amplifications was highly unique to target
species. These assays were successfully validated for sensitivity, specificity, and ruggedness under a
wide range of conditions.
Conclusion: The validation experiments confirm that the designed heminested PCR assays for
identification of the seven species are highly specific, sensitive, reliable and provide a reproducible
method allowing analysis of low copy number DNA recovered from decomposed or highly
processed tissues. The assays for identification of other species could be devised by extrapolating
the principle of designed heminested PCR.

Background
Characterization of species-specific molecular markers
and designing of species-specific assays for identification
of wildlife species are essential to prevent illegal trade of
parts and products for better conservation and management of endangered species. Illegal trade of skin, bone,
horn, tail-hair, meat, antlers of Pecora family prevalent in
India and have considerable trading value worldwide [1].

Laboratories often receive bio-specimens suspected to be
of bovid and cervid origin. The protected members of Pecora family extensively hunted in India, e.g. Blackbuck,
Goral, Nilgai, Chital, Thamin, Sambar, Hog deer, and
Musk deer. Antilope cervicapra (Blackbuck), Naemorhedus
goral (Goral) and Boselaphus tragocamelus (Nilgai) constitute three main Bovidae species endemic to India and
adjoining countries. The Cervidae family also comprises

of a number of species endemic to the Indian subcontinent e.g. Cervus axis (Chital), Cervus unicolor (Sambar),
Cervus eldi (Thamin deer) and Axis porcinus (Hog deer).
The density and distribution of these species have sharply
declined due to loss of habitat through logging, livestock
grazing and shift agriculture. All these species are prized
for their meat, skin, horn, liver etc. and therefore extensively hunted [2]. All of these species are listed in IUCN
(International Union for Conservation of Nature) and/or
CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) as vulnerable or threatened. In India they are listed in schedule I or III under
Wildlife Protection Act, India (1972).
The conventional methods based upon the structural,
electrophoretic and immunological characteristics of the
species are often used in identification of skin, bone,
horn, tail-hair, meat, antlers etc of poached animals [3,4].
However these methods are of limited use in species identification because of low stability and specificity of the
markers. The biological materials forwarded for species
identification are often of low quality. The analytical
methods should be highly specific, sensitive, robust,
reproducible and reliable. Presently DNA based techniques are extensively used in species identification [511]. Most DNA methods reported involve sequence analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [12-14]. The mitochondrial genome of vertebrates has been extensively
used over nuclear DNA for resolving phylogenetic relationships at different evolutionary depth due to its unique
properties, including presence of strictly orthologous
genes, lack of recombination, and unique substitution
rates [15]. These unique features along with high copy
number of mitochondrial DNA per cell compared to
nuclear DNA makes it a more powerful tool than nuclear
DNA for identification of unknown biological materials
[16-18]. Most of the designed species-specific identification methods are based upon mitochondrial Cytochrome
b (Cytb) gene [19,20] due to the availability of well-doc-

umented universal primers for the gene [21]. The other
genes also harbor species-specific sequences, are un-translated gene regions, e.g. rRNA genes, where base deletion
and insertions can be tolerated without altering protein
sequence, structure and function. Mitochondrial rRNA
genes are also widely studied for evolutionary studies [2224] and some recent studies also have proven the usefulness of unique polymorphisms present in mitochondrial
rRNA genes in species identification [25-27]. However no
report is available for mammalian species identification
using species-specific polymorphism of mitochondrail
rRNA genes.
DNA based methods employed in species identification
comprised of species-specific PCR, RFLP-PCR, RAPD-PCR,
SSCP, OLA etc are highly specific and sensitive but do not
have inbuilt mechanism to assess DNA quality, quantity
and presence of PCR inhibitor due to lack of a control step
[7-10]. This control step ensures the quality of DNA amenable to amplify and detect the presence of any inhibitor
in PCR reaction. The heminested PCR assay could inte-

grate a independent control step with specific primer in
two consecutive PCR reactions with improvement of sensitivity without impairing specificity [28].
In this study, we report a set of seven novel heminested
PCR assays based on the amplification of a species-specific internal sequence region of mitochondrial 16s rRNA
gene for identification of the species Blackbuck, Goral,
Nilgai, Chital, Thamin, Sambar and Hog deer with their
respective specific primers. To our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to develop heminested PCR assay, exploring
species unique polymorphism present in mitochondrial
16s rRNA gene for species identification.

Results and discussion
The DNA based species identification methods often
encounter low quantity and/or poor quality DNA template, and presence of PCR inhibitors. To examine these
common yet serious problems, a independent control of
DNA quality and quantity needs to be integrated in the
identification assays. In this study we have designed and
validated seven novel heminested mitochondrial 16s
rRNA gene-targeted PCR assays for identification of seven
species using designed species-specific primers listed in
table 1. To design the species-specific primers we have
screened the species unique sites or motifs in mitochondrial cytochrome b and 16s rRNA gene of thirty-seven species. Though level of polymorphism was high in
cytochrome b gene compare to 16s rRNA gene, but species-specific motifs were higher in 16s rRNA gene among
studied species [unpublished data. The species-specific
unique sites at 16s rRNA gene were used to design the
primers for identification of the studied species.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/42

In designed heminested PCR assays ~550 bp fragment
were generated with universal outer primers at first cycle
in all the studied species (Fig 2 and table 2). These results
confirmed the quality of DNA amenable to amplification
and nonexistence of any PCR inhibitor within the samples. It also enhanced the number of templates for next
cycle of the assay. In the second PCR, using species-specific inner primers paired with another universal primer,
all the individuals of a species generated species-specific
amplicons (Fig 2 and table 2). The products of both
amplifications for each individual were loaded together in
to 3 % agarose gel for easy visualization. These speciesspecific amplicons are not present to any other non-target
species having the 16s rRNA amplified region included in
the study for testing the specificity of the method. The
schematic diagram of species – specific amplicons with
species – specific primers based on mitochondrial 16s
rRNA gene are presented in fig 1. Though the diagnostic
value of Blackbuck, Goral, Nilgai and Thamin deer specific amplicons are limited in 3 % agarose gel due to their
almost equal fragment length but they are highly specific
with specific primers.
The designed heminested PCR assays with species-specific
primers successfully produced specific amplicon for the
target species with consecutive dilution of DNA templates
ranging from 5 ng to 5 pg (fig 3 and table 3). DNA
extracted from various tissues generated identical result
for all individual of a species using heminested PCR assay.
To ensure the fidelity of the designed heminested PCR, a
comparative experiment have been performed between
heminested and normal PCR using DNA template isolated from a tissue of chital species. The normal PCR with
61°C annealing temperature using chital specific primer
produced two nonspecific bands a long with the target
band. On the otherhand, in heminested PCR assay using
same annealing temperature only one single band of 240
bp size was produced at the second PCR reaction (fig 5).
This experiment clearly reveals the higher fidelity of the
designedheminested PCR compared to normal PCR used
instudied species identification. The highly degraded
DNAsample of a chital individual was also subjected for
mitochondrial (16s rRNA) and nuclear (3' UTR of SON
gene) gene amplification. The universal primers of 3' UTR
of SON gene were not able to amplify the expected fragment of ~175 bp size. While, the universal primers of
mitochondrial 16s rRNA gene successfully amplified a
fragment of ~550 bp size. This result clearly indicates the
usefulness of mitochondrial DNA in the designed assay
over the nuclear DNA.
The designed heminested assays also successfully typed
the target species from mixture of DNA originating from
different species (table 3). The successful amplification of
all the tissue samples treated with different chemical rea-

gents confirms the strength of the assay (table 3). The tissue samples were also incubated at 37°C for different time
period assuming the damp condition influencing the typing result. But all the samples were amplified successfully
after this heat treatment (table 3). The results of analysis
tissue samples subjected to UV irradiation indicate a
minor influence of this factor on designed assay (table 3).
These results confirm substantial stability and robustness
of the assays against considerable influence of various
chemical and physical factors.
The possibility of carry-over contamination is a common
problem in nested or heminested PCR [26]. However
these assays have been designed for highly species-specific
primers that will prevent any non-specific amplification.
Nevertheless, researchers need to setup separate pre- and
post-PCR environments and take other precautions to
avoid the risk of carry-over contamination.

Conclusion
In conclusion, it is found that the designed heminested
PCR assays based on unique species-specific polymorphism at mitochondrial 16s rRNA gene for identification
of seven species are highly specific, simple and sensitive
technique. Validation studies i.e. sensitivity of the
designed assays compare to normal PCR, different DNA
concentrations, species cross reactivity, specificity, and
stability under various physical and chemical environment clearly reveal the applicability of the assays to lessthan-optimal and highly degraded samples. Two consecutive PCRs and agarose gel visualization make the assays
rapid as well as easy to interpret. The designed assays are
more efficient and cost effective technology compared to
other species identification tools, which do not have any
inbuilt independent control of DNA quality and quantity.
Because of highly species-specific primers, the designed
heminested PCR assays provide reliable evidence for wildlife enforcement. These heminested PCR assays based on

species-specific polymorphism in mitochondrial 16s
rRNA gene can also be adapted for the identification of a
wide range of wildlife species.

Methods
Samples and DNA isolation
DNA was extracted from various authenticated tissue samples of the unrelated individuals (N) of Blackbuck (N = 3),
Goral (N = 3), Nilgai (N = 3), Thamin (N = 2), Chital (N
= 5), Sambar (N = 2) and Hog deer (N = 2) by using
standard phenol/chloroform procedure [29]. These samples of known animals species were provided by WII,
Dehradun, India. DNA was concentrated and cleaned
using Microcon 100 (Millipore) concentrators. Negative
controls were included in every extraction. DNA was
quantified using spectrophotometric method.
Designing of primers
In heminested PCR the 16s rRNA gene based universal
primers; 16s rRNA fwd and 16s rRNA rev [30] were chosen
as outer primer and would amplify approximately ~550
bp amplicon. The species-specific internal primers were
designed for blackbuck (BB16), goral (GL16), Nilgai
(NG16), chital (CH16), thamin (TH16), sambar (SM16)
and hog deer (HD16) (table 1). These specific primers
were paired with the universal forward primer of first PCR,
except for sambar where universal reverse primer used in
the second PCR assay. These specific primers in conjunction with universal primers in heminested PCR generated
specific amplicons; 410 bp (blackbuck), 430 bp (goral),
408 bp (Nilgai), 400 bp (Thamin), 240 bp (Chital), 350
bp (Sambar) and 300 bp (Hog deer) (table 1 and Fig 1).
Primer specificity
The designed species-specific primers were subjected to
BLAST search at NCBI GenBank database to rule out any
false similarity with other species. These primers were also
tested for amplification specificity using DNA extracted
from a panel of non-target species belonging to different
classes.
Heminested PCR
DNA samples of individuals of studied species were subjected to heminested PCR assay with outer universal mitochondrial 16s rRNA gene primers at first PCR and with
specific primers paired with one universal primer as
reverse/ forward at second PCR. The first PCR reaction
were carried out in a 25 µl reaction volume with 2 µl of
DNA (10 ng – 30 ng/ µl) from tissue samples, 3 µl 10×
PCR buffer, 2.5 µl of MgCl2 (15 mM), 2 µl of dNTP (2.5
mM each dNTP), 2 µl of both primers (10 pm/µl), 0.5 µl
of Taq polymerase (5 U/µl), under the standardise condition; 94°C for 2 minute pre PCR denaturation, followed
by 94°C for 30 seconds, 47°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 45
seconds, for 30 cycles and a final extension at 72°C for 5

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/42

minutes. The PCR products of the first amplification with
universal primers were diluted to ~1/20th and 1 µl subjected to second PCR with universal 16s rRNA forward
primer and Blackbuck, Goral, Nilgai, Thamin, Chital, and
Hog deer specific primers as reverse at six different sets
and universal 16s rRNA reverse primer and Sambar specific primer in a single set. The second PCR cycles were carried out almost in identical conditions to the first PCR
cycle except the species – specific primer annealing temperature and final MgCl2 concentration. The annealing
temperature and final MgCl2 concentration for Blackbuck
and Goral specific primers is 56°C and 0.9 mM, Nilgai
specific primer is 54°C and 1.5 mM, Chital and Hogdeer
specific primer is 61°C and 1.0 mM, Thamin deer is 58°C
and 1.0 mM and Sambar is 62°C and 1.0 mM. The amplicons of both the PCR were loaded together for an individual of a species in a single lane and visualized in 3%
agarose gel with 100 bp ladder, a negative control and
with other non-target species performed the same assay
(Fig 2). The results of all the heminested PCR assays are
presented at table 2.
Validation study
Sensitivity of these assays were assessed by analysis of consecutive dilution of total DNA extracted from different tissues (muscle, liver, heart, kidney, skin) and blood stains
of unrelated individuals of seven species. The DNA dilutions were prepared in a range of 5 pg to 5 ng and subjected to PCR assay with designed specific primers using
stringent conditions described above (table 3, fig 3).

Fidelity of the designed heminested PCR assays compare
to normal PCR assay was also evaluated by using the DNA
template isolated from tissue sample of chital species
along with chital specific primer.
To check the suitability of using mitochondrial DNA over
nuclear DNA we have extracted DNA from a highly
degraded and mutilated chital tissue sample. No high
molecular DNA was found and the DNA aliquot was subjected to PCR with mitochondrial 16s rRNA gene universal primers and 3' UTR of the SON gene [31] universal
primers (SON Fwd primer 5' – ACATAGCATATGAATACC
– 3' and SON Rev primer 5' – GTCTATCTAGGTGTAGCTGA – 3').
Mixture analysis was also performed with all the designed
species-specific primers to evaluate the sensitivity of detection from mixture of DNA samples of more than one origin. Seven types of DNA mixtures were prepared and
subjected to heminested PCR assays consecutively using
seven designed primers (table 3). Each mixture was prepared by aliquoting 50 pg of DNA of target species and
500 pg of DNA of non-target species.

Exposure of samples to different factors
Biospecimens of known species were exposed to different
chemical reagents (gasoline, soap, 0.1 N NaOH, 5% Acetic acid, 1 M NaCl) and analyzed after 5 days of storage in
ambient temperature. Small pieces of tissue samples were
also placed in dishes floating in a water bath settled at
37°C for periods of 1, 2 and 3 week. After the exposure
samples were kept frozen in -80°C until extraction. Samples were also treated by UV irradiation (302 nm) from a
distance of 15 cm for 1 h, 8 h and 24 h (table 3).
