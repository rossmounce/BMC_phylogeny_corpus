Abstract
Background: The nematode Pristionchus pacificus has originally been developed as a satellite
organism for comparison to Caenorhabditis elegans. A 10X coverage of the whole genome of P.
pacificus is available, making P. pacificus the first non-Caenorhabditis nematode with a fully sequenced
genome. The macroevolutionary comparison between P. pacificus and C. elegans has been
complemented by microevolutionary studies of closely related strains and species within the genus
Pristionchus. In addition, new understanding of the biology of Pristionchus from field studies,
demonstrating a close association with various scarab beetles and the Colorado potato beetle,
supports consideration of this nematode in studies of ecosystems. In the course of field studies on
four continents more than 1,200 isolates were established from 15,000 beetle specimens
representing 18 Pristionchus species. Two remarkable features of the Pristionchus – beetle
association are the high species specificity of the interaction and the interception of the beetle's sex
communication system for host recognition by the nematodes, as suggested by chemotaxis studies.
Evolutionary interpretations of differences in developmental, behavioral and ecological patterns
require a phylogenetic framework of the genus Pristionchus.
Results: Here, we provide a robust phylogeny of all 18 available Pristionchus species based on a set
of 27 ribosomal protein genes encompassing a total of 10,971 bp. The phylogenetic tree provides
evidence for North American and European clades, which are embedded in a deeper clade that
includes Asian species. It also indicates putative invasion events. Of the 18 Pristionchus species, 13
are gonochoristic and five are hermaphroditic. The phylogeny indicates that all hermaphroditic
species have arisen independently within the genus Pristionchus.
Conclusion: Combined ribosomal protein cDNA data can provide the basis for reconstruction of
a robust phylogenetic framework for microevolutionary and biogeographic analyses. An additional
major implication of our studies is the use of Pristionchus for nematode biodiversity assessments.
While some species are represented by more than 100 isolates, others were found less than four
times. Such patterns were observed on all continents and in all phylogenetic clades indicating that
species asymmetry is a widespread phenomenon, which can now be further investigated by
molecular tools.

Background
The nematode Pristionchus pacificus is a laboratory model
organism to study developmental biology, evolutionary
biology, and behavior in comparative context to other
nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans (for review see
[1]). Recent studies indicate a close association of these
nematodes to various scarab beetles and the Colorado
potato beetle (CPB), thus extending the knowledge of
Pristionchus ecology [2-4]. For example, P. pacificus is
found on the Oriental beetle Exomala orientalis in Japan
and the United States, whereas two common European
species P. maupasi and P. entomophagus are predominantly
found on cockchafers (Melolontha ssp.) and dung beetle
(Geotrupes ssp.), respectively [2,4]. Surprisingly, these
studies revealed an notable precision in the species-specificity between Pristionchus nematodes and beetles. Chemotaxis studies indicated that Pristionchus olfaction differs
strongly between closely related species and may be
involved in shaping the nematode-host interactions [1,5].
The genus Pristionchus belongs to the family Diplogastridae, a monophyletic group within the Rhabditidae that
encompasses some 300 described free-living species in 28
genera [6,7]. Most diplogastrids are gonochoristic; hermaphrodites are described only in two genera, Diplogasteroides and Pristionchus. P. pacificus and C. elegans belong
both to clade V nematodes [8,9]. Clade V encompasses C.
elegans and other members of the suborder Rhabditina
with the vertebrate-parasitic order Strongylida, the entomopathogenic genus Heterorhabditis and the order
Diplogasterida. The latter, which includes Pristionchus, is a
sister group of some rhabditids [8]. They resemble each
other in overall morphology, culture conditions, mode of
reproduction and other features, i.e. they both feed on
Escherichia coli bacteria under laboratory conditions and
have a generation time of 3–4 days at 20°C. They develop
by lineage-dependant differentiation through a fixed
number of cells and pass through four juvenile stages.
Both species are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites with a XX
genotype. However, the rare occurrence of spontaneous
males of the XO genotype generated by X-chromosomal
non-disjunction provides a way for outcrossing [10,11].
Despite the many similarities, a number of differences
and peculiarities exist between P. pacificus and C. elegans
that are subject to current investigations. Diplogastrids
differ from rhabditids in a number of morphological,
developmental and behavioral aspects, e.g., by the
absence of a grinder in the terminal bulb, the J1 to J2
moult that occurs in diplogastrids within the egg before
hatching, or chemoattraction profiles [5-7]. Description
of vulva and gonad development at the cellular level
revealed substantial differences in the cell-cell interactions
and the genetic and molecular networks regulating developmental processes [12-14].

To complement the developmental and genetic studies in
P. pacificus, a genetic linkage map and a physical map have
been generated and a whole genome sequencing draft of
P. pacificus is available [15-18]. In addition, the genomes
of two sister species, P. maupasi and P. entomophagus, have
been sequenced at low coverage.
Field studies in the years 2004 – 2006 in western Europe,
North America, South Africa and Japan provided a first
overview of the beetle-associated Pristionchus fauna in the
respected areas [2-4,19]. In the course of these global surveys, 15 distinct Pristionchus species were discovered
(Table 1). Six of them could be identified as the known
species P. pacificus, P. maupasi, P. uniformis, P. entomophagus, P. lheritieri, and P. aerivorus and four others represented novel species, which were described as P.
pseudaerivorus, P. marianneae, P. pauli, and P. americanus
[2,3]. Five other species could not be matched to valid
species names; two of them from western Europe (P. sp. 4,
P. sp. 6) and three from Japan (P. sp. 11, P. sp. 14, P. sp.
15) [2,5].
Species determination of large numbers of nematode isolates from extensive field studies requires a fast, reliable
and easy procedure. This can be achieved by combining
morphological identification of new specimen with easily
obtainable molecular taxonomic markers. We choose to
apply a 471 bp segment of the of the 5' part of the small
subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) for this purpose as
described by Blaxter et al., Floyd et al. and Herrmann et al.
[2-4,8,20]. Briefly, gravid female nematodes were isolated
to establish isogenic female lines. Single offspring worms
were picked, lysed and subjected to SSU-specific PCR
amplification. The resulting fragments were sequenced
directly and their sequences compared to those of Pristionchus species reference strains (Figure 1). A sequence
matching one of a reference strain suggested identical species. The species identification was then verified by crossing the new isolates and reference strains to produce
viable and fertile offspring. Three observations were
made: First, all isolates of a given species had invariably
identical SSU sequences. Second, single nucleotide differences (substitutions or indels) indicated distinct species
(as verified by mating experiments) and not intra-specific
variability (e.g. P. aerivorus and P. americanus) [3]. All
observed differences appeared to be fixed differences
between species. Third, in one case a cryptic species pair
could not be distinguished by the SSU sequence but only
by their mode of reproduction and by mating experiments
(P. maupasi and P. aerivorus). Thus, the SSU proved to be
a powerful tool for species identification within the genus
Pristionchus.
The current research in P. pacificus developmental biology,
behavior, ecology and microevolution requires a detailed

knowledge of the phylogenetic relationships within the
genus Pristionchus, the Diplogastridae family, as well as
clade V nematodes as a whole. While Kiontke and Fitch
have provided a detailed phylogeny of clade V nematodes
in 2005, the phylogeny at the family and genus level has
not been studied with molecular techniques [21]. The
molecular analyses of the SSU sequences as provided by
Herrmann et al. is not sufficient for this purpose since the
data harbor only a limited number of informative characters and provide only a single gene-based phylogeny [2,3].
To obtain a robust phylogeny of all 18 Pristionchus species
currently available in the laboratory we set out to obtain a
molecular data set that should represent an easily accessible unbiased representation of the species' genomes.
Here, we describe 27 ribosomal protein genes that were
concatenated to yield a data set of 10,971 aligned nucleotides. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by various
methods generating a robust phylogeny of the genus Pristionchus. Implications for biogeography, biodiversity and
origin of hermaphroditism are discussed.

SSU sequence with the accession code [GenBank:EF623995]. Male and female worms of this species
do not mate with any of the other 17 Pristionchus species
in our collection. The hermaphroditic species Pristionchus
sp. 10 was found in two isolates from soil samples from
Tato Pani near Pokhara, Nepal. The reference strain is
RS5133. Males and female worms mate successfully
between the two strains of this species but produce no offspring with any of the other 17 Pristionchus species in our
collection. Pristionchus sp. 10 is characterized by the SSU
sequence with the accession code [GenBank:EF623996].
Pristionchus sp. 13 was isolated from a soil sample from
Buftea near Bucharest, Romania. The reference strain is
RS5231. It is characterized by the SSU sequence with the
accession code [GenBank:EF623997]. Males and female
worms of this species do not produce offspring with any
of the other 17 Pristionchus species in our collection. With
these three novel species, a total of 18 Pristionchus species,
of which representative strains are kept as live stocks, has
been isolated from beetle and soil samples on four different continents.

Results
Identification of three novel species
In soil samples collected during the field surveys in the
years 2004–2006 and provided to us by colleagues, we
identified three additional novel Pristionchus species
(Table 1). These species were preliminarily designated as
P. sp. 3, P. sp. 10, and P. sp. 13 and will be taxonomically
described elsewhere. Pristionchus sp. 3 is a gonochoristic
species, represented by the single strain CZ3975, which
originated from a soil sample from a flowerbed at the
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. It is characterized by the

Molecular markers for phylogenetic inference
An expanded multi-locus data set encompassing several
independently evolving genes was obtained by sequence
analysis of EST libraries and the identification of frequently expressed genes. Gene transcripts coding for
ribosomal proteins proved to be easily accessible in cDNA
preparations from all Pristionchus species and could be
assumed to evolve with similar rates. Preliminary tests
showed that intraspecific polymorphism was very low for
these genes and did not obstruct phylogenetic signals

(data not shown). A total of 27 ribosomal protein genes
was selected and amplified by RT-PCR with gene-specific
primers from all 18 Pristionchus species and from the
Koerneria sp. strain RS1982 (see Additional file 1).
Koerneria was used as an outgroup because of its close
morphological relatedness to Pristionchus, thereby reducing long-branch attraction effects, and its availability and
accessibility for experimental studies [6]. The PCR products were sequenced directly with PCR primers. The 5'
cDNA ends of all but the rpl-27 gene in Koerneria sp. could
be obtained with a primer specific for the trans-spliced
leader SL1. The latter cDNA fragment was amplified using
an SL2b primer. The resulting sequences were aligned
manually. Since the first nucleotides at the 5' end could
not be obtained in all cases the first codons were eliminated from further analyses as indicated in Table 2. Only
coding sequences including the stop codons were used
since the highly diverged 3' untranslated regions could
not be aligned unambiguously.

intraspecific polymorphisms or resulted from recent gene
duplication in the reference strain of that species. In the
subsequent analyses the sequences were included using
the standard ambiguity codes and the sites were thus
treated as being polymorphic.

The 27 coding sequences consisted of 132 bp to 783 bp,
encompassing a total of 10,971 aligned nucleotides. The
number of variable sites between the Pristionchus
sequences was 2725, out of which 1571 were parsimonyinformative. Transitions were in excess over transversions
at a ratio of Ts/Tv = 1.51 within the genus Pristionchus. The
number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions was calculated by the modified Nei-Gojobori
method with the help of the MEGA3.1 software resulting
in average values of dS = 0.181 and dN = 0.021 [22-24].
Thus, there was a 8.6-fold excess of synonymous over
non-synonymous substitutions indicative of purifying
selection.

Molecular phylogeny of the genus Pristionchus
The data set of multiple ribosomal protein genes was concatenated to produce a 10,971 bp-long super-gene alignment, which was then used for phylogenetic inference
[25]. Various methods were applied. Prior to all analyses
the best substitutions model for the Pristionchus data set
(excluding Koerneria sp.) was selected by hierarchical likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion
(AIC) in Modeltest 3.7 [26,27]. The selected model corresponded to GTR+G+I. Maximum parsimony analysis
(MP) was performed in PAUP*4.0b10 using the heuristic
search with stepwise-addition option [28]. Multistate taxa
were interpreted as polymorphisms, gaps as fifth character
state. Tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) was chosen as
branch swapping algorithm. Robustness of the tree topology was evaluated by 1000 bootstrap replications (Figure
2A). Neighbor-joining (NJ) analyses were performed in
PAUP*4.0b10 using the BIONJ algorithm with the
HKY85 distance option (Figure 2B) or with maximum
likelihood distance settings as determined by Modeltest
3.7 [27,29,30]. In both cases the resulting tree topology
was identical. The latter settings were also applied for ML
analysis by heuristic search in PAUP*4.0b10 with TBR as
branch swapping algorithm. The topology obtained by all
three methods for phylogenetic reconstruction was identical (Figure 2C).

All putative coding sequences had open reading frames of
conserved lengths except two genes with apparent premature stop codons. The rpl-2 sequence obtained from P.
entomophagus had a nonsense mutation at nucleotide
position 37 leading to a stop codon. Likewise, the rps-8
sequence of P. sp. 4 showed a stop codon at position 493
of the alignment. In both cases the remaining sequence
was highly conserved indicating a recent inactivation of
the genes. For subsequent phylogenetic analyses the complete alignable sequences were used.
Among the 10,971 bp available for each taxon the nucleotide assignment at some variable positions remained
ambiguous. Most species showed one to eight such sites.
The exceptions were P. maupasi with 28, P. entomophagus
with 35, P. marianneae with 55, and P. sp. 14 with 64
ambiguous sites. These ambiguities could be verified in
separate PCR and sequencing reactions, and they occurred
predominantly at synonymous positions that were also
variable between species. We concluded that these particular genes were in a heterozygous state and represent

Sequence comparisons between the taxa revealed uncorrected mean character differences of Koerneria to all Pristionchus species of 18.0 to 18.8%, whereas within the
genus Pristionchus the concatenated ribosomal protein
cDNA sequences differed by merely 1.7 – 10.3%. The
most distant Pristionchus species was P. sp. 15. The majority of species differed by 7 to 8%, while the closest was the
species pair P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus, which differed by only 1.7%. Thus, most of the Pristionchus species
showed comparable or smaller distances than the
Caenorhabditis species C. elegans and C. briggsae, which differed by 8.6% when their orthologous ribosomal protein
genes were included in the analysis.

A significant grouping into three different clades is apparent. Pristionchus pacificus and P. sp. 11 fall into the same
branch as sister species. The American species P. aerivorus,
P. pseudaerivorus, P. americanus, P. marianneae, P. pauli, and
P. sp. 3 group together with the European species P. maupasi. The other mostly European species P. lheritieri, P.
entomophagus, P. uniformis, P. sp. 4, and P. sp. 13 fall into
another distinct clade, which is joined by species P. sp. 6

from Asia are located in deeper clades in the phylogenetic
tree.

by investigating various constellations of taxa did not
improve our understanding of the branching pattern
[32,33].

While the bootstrap values provide very high support for
the phylogenetic relationships within the three major
clades, the nodes interconnecting the major clades
appeared not to be significant. To obtain additional support for the topology a Bayesian analysis was performed
with the help of the MrBayes 3.2.1 software for Macintosh
[31]. The program was run for 150,000 generations, a
total of 1,501 trees were sampled and after burning-in the
trees 376–1501 were evaluated. The resulting phylogenetic consensus tree is displayed in Figure 4 and the posterior probabilities are shown at the nodes. The topology
is identical to the MP, NJ, and ML trees and is highly supported by the posterior probability values. The only node
that is not significantly resolved (posterior probability of
0.82) determines the position of the P. pacificus and P. sp.
11 clade. Here, in 18% of the sampled trees P. pacificus
and P. sp. 11 are joined by P. sp. 14. Attempts to resolve
this node by likelihood mapping with TREE-PUZZLE 5.2

Although the major clades could be clearly identified by
the molecular phylogenetic analysis, the nodes interconnecting these clades were less supported in MP and NJ
phylograms and were separated by short branch lengths
only. This seems to be due to stochastic segregation and
incomplete lineage sorting of the ribosomal protein
genes, which could result from ancestral speciation events
in close succession from a polymorphic population and/
or frequent hybridization and gene introgression before
reproductive barriers were established.

Discussion
Here, we present a first robust phylogeny of 18 available
nematode species of the genus Pristionchus based on the
analysis of 27 ribosomal protein genes totalling 10,971
bp. This molecular phylogeny provides a framework for
mechanistic studies in developmental biology, evolution,
behavior, and ecology.

Evolution of hermaphroditism
The most common mode of reproduction of Pristionchus
nematodes is by gonochorism, i.e. females with XX genotype and males with XO genotype have to mate to produce
offspring. Thirteen of the species in our collection fall into
this category. Five of the Pristionchus species, however, are
self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, presumably of the XX genotype with males emerging at low frequency by X-chromosomal non-disjunction to enable occasional
outcrossing. Among diplogastrid nematodes only one
other genus harbors hermaphrodites, Diplogasteroides,
which was also isolated on cockchafers together with Pristionchus species [7,34]. The diplogastrid species Koerneria
sp., which according to Fürst von Lieven and Sudhaus
(2003), was taken as outgroup in this study as a close relative to Pristionchus, is a gonochoristic species like P. sp. 15
from Japan, which appeared to diverge first in the Pristionchus genealogy [6].

The five hermaphroditic species all occur as terminal taxa
in different clades of different geographic origin (Figure
3). This is a strong indication for multiple and independent origins of hermaphroditism in Pristionchus nematodes. These findings suggest a high plasticity in the sex
determination system regulating hermaphroditic vs.
female development. Furthermore, only a small number
of mutations, which could be experimentally targeted,
might be required for the conversion between the two
modes of reproduction. It is not clear, however, whether
the switch between hermaphroditism and gonochorism
can occur back and forth since those hermaphroditic species (P. sp. 10, P. entomophagus, P. maupasi), which connect to internal ancestral nodes, could have developed
hermaphroditism after divergence from a gonochoristic
ancestral species. One might speculate that hermaphroditic lineages are more likely to go extinct than gonochoristic ones. A similar finding was made in the genus
Caenorhabditis, where hermaphroditism of C. elegans and
C. briggsae has evolved independently [35]. However,
based on the available data, the total number of hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis species seems to be smaller than in
Pristionchus.
Biogeography
One conspicuous observation emerging from the phylogenetic tree reconstructions is the apparent biogeographic
distribution of Pristionchus species. Species from different
geographic origins tend to form clades, such as the European and North American clades or all Asian species
assuming a deeper position (Figure 3). The first and most
striking observation is the grouping of all endemic North
American species into a single highly supported clade.
This monophyletic group includes P. aerivorus, P. pseudaerivorus, P. americanus, P. marianneae, P. pauli, and P. sp. 3.
These species, which are morphologically very similar but

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/104

can be distinguished by molecular analysis, are associated
with scarab beetles (mainly Phyllophaga spp. and Popilia
japonica) and occur in the same areas in the Eastern US. In
the combined CDS of 27 ribosomal protein genes they
exhibit 1.7–5.7% nucleotide difference. Surprisingly, the
only hermaphroditic species in this clade, P. maupasi, a
sibling species to P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus, is widespread in Europe but absent in North America [2,3]. These
results suggest that P. maupasi has American ancestry and
translocation to the European continent and conversion
to hermaphroditism may have been associated with its
speciation.
North America is the home of the two most closely related
species, which differed in their ribosomal protein genes in
less than 6% of their coding nucleotides. The two sister
species, P. aerivorus and P. pseudaerivorus, have even been
shown to mate under laboratory conditions to produce
sterile offspring that follows Haldane's rule [3,36]. The
close relatedness of the members of the North American
species group raises the possibility that occasionally they
still may hybridize and yield fertile offspring leading to
introgression events. This is demonstrated by incomplete
and stochastic lineage sorting of the segregating ribosomal protein alleles and by variable molecular markers
that are shared between species (data not shown). Thus,
certain Pristionchus nematodes could prove to be a powerful system to study recent speciation events.
The species, P. lheritieri, P. entomophagus, P. uniformis, P.
sp. 4, P. sp. 6, and P. sp. 13 cluster together and form a
European branch within the phylogram. Single isolates of
P. entomophagus from North America could have originated from sporadic dispersal from Europe by beetles or
by humans. P. uniformis is associated with the CPB and
represents the only available Pristionchus species with a
non-scarab beetle association. P. uniformis occurs in
Europe and North America and we have previously argued
that P. uniformis might have invaded Europe together with
its insect vector in the late 19th century [3]. However, the
phylogenetic position of P. uniformis in the middle of the
European clade questions this original assumption. Also,
P. sp. 13 is the sister species to P. uniformis within the
European clade, providing additional evidence for a European origin of the CPB-associated P. uniformis. We are currently collecting P. uniformis strains from many additional
locations in Europe and North America to study the origin
of this species using molecular diversity analyses and
relate these studies to similar investigations of the CPB
[37]. Finally, it should be noted that P. sp. 6, which was
found only in the Tübingen area in Germany, lacks a sister
species and is the most diverged species in the European
clade.

Figure 3tree of Pristionchus species based on ribosomal protein genes
Bayesian
Bayesian tree of Pristionchus species based on ribosomal protein genes. The phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed from concatenated ribosomal protein CDS by Bayesian inference using the MrBayes 3.2.1 software [31]. The evolutionary model was set to GTR+I+G. The analysis was run for 150,000 generations, burn-in time was for 37,500 generations,
sampling frequency was 1 in 100 generations. Koerneria sp. was included as the closest related genus to Pristionchus. The tree
was rooted at midpoint. Numbers at nodes indicate posterior probabilities. Hermaphroditic and gonochoristic (male/female)
species are marked. The geographic origins of the species are indicated.
The satellite organism P. pacificus seems to be globally dispersed and was sporadically discovered in various soil
samples and associated with scarab beetles in the United
States, South Africa, China, India, Madagascar, Poland,
Montenegro, and Turkey, but predominantly in Japan,
where it is closely associated with the Oriental beetle
Exomala orientalis (Table 1) [2,3,19]. Interestingly, P.
pacificus is the only Pristionchus species currently available
with a cosmopolitan distribution. In contrast, its sister
species P. sp. 11 has been so far isolated only in soil samples from Japan. This clade appears to be basal to the
North American and European clades. The other Asian
species found in Nepal (P. sp. 10) and Japan (P. sp. 14, P.
sp. 15) all are highly diversified from each other and
assume basal positions in the phylogenetic tree. Several
circumstances could explain these observations. First,
samplings in Europe and North America with several hundreds of Pristionchus strains were more comprehensive
than corresponding samplings in Asia. Therefore, important sister taxa might still be missing in the Asian clade(s),
which, if available, might generate a less diversified phyl-

ogeny. Second, samplings on the missing continents,
Africa, South America and Australia, might provide additional material with important phylogenetic information.
Finally, Pristionchus nematodes might have originated in
Asia and therefore explain the deeper branches. However,
such claims await a detailed analysis of beetles and nematodes of the still missing continents, in particular central
Africa and South America.
Biodiversity
In the course of our surveys of the distribution of Pristionchus nematodes we could demonstrate that the SSU serves
as a fast and reliable barcoding marker for species identification with sufficient resolution within the genus. The
importance of a fast identification procedure as shown
above, which distinguishes morphologically very similar
species, is emphasized by the observation of the frequencies of the different Pristionchus nematodes in the isolates.
Whereas in the total sample size of more than 15,000 beetles and soil samples some species were easily detectable
since they occurred several hundred times or were present

Page 9 of 13

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:104

in at least moderate frequencies, seven species were found
by serendipity only in single or very few isolates (Table 1).
Pristionchus sp. 3 is represented by a single strain isolated
from a soil sample from Cold Spring Harbor (New York),
Pristionchus sp. 11 was found twice in soil samples from
Japan, Pristionchus sp. 14 was isolated once and P. sp. 15
twice from Oriental beetles in Japan. Two isolates of P. sp.
10 were obtained from soil samples from Nepal, two isolates of P. sp. 4 were found on beetles in western Europe,
and P. americanus was detected three times on North
American beetles [2,3]. Thus, 98% of all analyzed Pristionchus isolates belong to only 11 species, the remaining
seven species were found only sporadically (Table 1). Rare
species were usually found at sampling sites that were also
abundant for the more common species showing a total
of up to six species in a sampling area. Such patterns were
observed on all continents and in all phylogenetic clades.
This observation has important consequences for biodiversity assessments. First, it indicates that species asymmetry is a widespread phenomenon in Pristionchus and
maybe other nematodes as well. Second, the biodiversity
of taxa that are as poor in morphological characters as
Pristionchus nematodes can best be assessed by using
molecular tools. Therefore, a fast, reliable and easy barcoding procedure is important for both, species determination and biodiversity and as such complements
taxonomy, phylogenetics and population genetics [38].
Besides these immediate implications, future research will
address the potential co-evolution between Pristionchus
nematodes and scarab beetles. Coevolutionary processes
are subject to detailed investigations and require knowledge of the phylogeny of both groups of organisms taking
part in the coevolutionary process [39]. While the molecular phylogeny of the Coleoptera and scarab beetles is
well defined at the higher taxonomic level, lower level
phylogeny, necessary for the investigation of coevolutionary processes, is not yet available [40]. Given, the higher
number of scarab beetle taxa in all biogeographic groups,
in particular Asia and North America, such an analysis will
be time intensive.

Conclusion
We present an approach based on concatenated ribosomal protein genes to reconstruct a robust phylogenetic
framework of the genus Pristionchus, which represents the
basis for evolutionary interpretations of developmental,
behavioral and ecological patterns. The phylogenic tree
indicates distinct but closely related species, which group
into clades that correspond largely with their geographic
origin. Hermaphroditism has evolved independently in
five Pristionchus species suggesting a frequent conversions
toward hermaphroditism. Our studies also indicate the
use of Pristionchus for nematode biodiversity assessments.
Ninety-eight per cent of the 1,200 analyzed Pristionchus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/104

isolates represent the 11 most common species, whereas
the other seven species are represented by small numbers
of isolates. Such patterns indicate that species asymmetry
is a widespread phenomenon that can best be investigated
by molecular tools.

Methods
Isolate and strain definitions
We use the following definitions to distinguish "isolates"
and "strains". An isolate is an isogenic female line, which
is derived from a beetle sample and subjected to molecular and experimental analysis. After species identification
we established one isolate per species and location as a
strain. The strains are permanently cultured in the lab,
have a strain number and are also kept as frozen stocks.
For each new species designated by molecular sequence
analysis and mating experiments, one strain was defined
as a reference strain (see below). The phylogenetic analysis described here was carried out by using the reference
strains of all available Pristionchus species (Table 1).
Molecular species identification
Species were identified employing the small subunit rRNA
gene (SSU) [2-4]. In short, genomic DNA from single
nematodes was prepared using the NaOH digestion procedure described by Floyd et al. [20]. A single worm was
transferred to 20 µl of 0.25 M NaOH, incubated overnight
at 25°C and heated to 99°C for 3 min before 4 µl of 1 M
HCl, 10 µl of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 µl of 2% Triton X-100 were added. The mixture was heated to 99°C
for 3 min, frozen at -20°C and reheated at 99°C for further 3 min. Two microliters of this extract were used for
subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

A 1 kb fragment of the SSU was amplified by PCR using
the primers SSU18A (5'-AAAGATTAAGCCATGCATG-3')
and
SSU26R
(5'-CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG-3')
[8,20]. The reactions were performed in 25 µl of 1× PCR
buffer (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) containing 2.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.16 mM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 0.5 µM of each primer, 2 µl of the
lysate, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Amersham
Biosciences). The reactions were started by initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min in a T gradient thermocycler
(Biometra, Göttingen, Germany), followed by 35 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 15 sec, primer annealing at
50°C for 15 sec, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. A final
incubation step at 72°C for 7 min concluded the reaction.
For sequencing of approximately 500 bp of the 5'-terminal end of the SSU using the primer SSU9R (5'-AGCTGGAATTACCGCGGCTG-3') one microliter of a 10 to 20
fold dilution of the PCR mixes was directly added to the
Big Dye terminator sequencing mix (Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany). A BLAST search option of Pristionchus SSU sequences will be set up on our web site [18,41].

Mating experiments
To support the species molecular identification of a novel
isolate we performed mating experiments with the reference strain of the respective species (see below for definitions). Five virgin females were put on a plate with a small
spot of E. coli OP50 together with five males of the reference strain of a certain species. On a second plate we
picked the opposite sexes of the two strains to test for reciprocity. If there was no offspring after one week, the
experiments were repeated two more times. If fertile offspring occurred we considered the two strains to belong to
the same species.
Construction and sequencing of expressed sequence tag
(EST) libraries
To search for abundantly expressed genes with similar
expression patterns in different nematode species, total
RNA from 50 to 100 µg of ten nematode reference strains
was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The reference
strains were PS312 (Pristionchus pacificus), SB245 (P. lheritieri), RS0141 (P. uniformis), RS0143 (P. maupasi),
RS0144 (P. entomophagus), RS5050 (P. sp. 4), RS5101 (P.
sp. 6), RS5106 (P. aerivorus), CZ3975 (P. sp. 3) and
RS1982 (Koerneria sp.) as outgroup genus closely related
to Pristionchus. Two microliters of total RNA were used for
double-stranded cDNA synthesis with the help of the BD
SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and the BD Advantage 2 Polymerase
mix (Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturer's
instructions with the following exceptions. The 3' primer
used for first strand cDNA synthesis was RH5620 (5'GAAGATCTAGAGCGGCCGCCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'),
the 5' primer was RH6478 (5'-GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAGCGGG-3'). The sequence of the 5' primer
is derived from the conserved SL1 leader of Pristionchus
and was chosen to specifically amplify the first gene of
trans-spliced polycistronic mRNA. Second-strand synthesis was performed by 17 PCR cycles with the primers
RH6479
(5'-AGTGTCGACGGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3')
and
RH6295
(5'-GAAGATCTAGAGCGGCCGCCC-3') using an annealing temperature of 64°C.
Double-stranded cDNA fragments were purified using
QIAquick columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Single
deoxyadenosyl overhangs were added by incubating the
DNA in Taq reaction buffer with Taq DNA polymerase
(Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 0.2 mM ATP
at 37°C for 15 min before ligation into the pCR2.1-TOPO
vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). The DNA was
electroporated in OneShot E. coli cells (Invitrogen) and
plated onto LB plates containing 50 µg of ampicillin. For
insert sequencing 96 to 384 single colonies were picked,
plasmid DNA was extracted using the QIAprep 96 Turbo
BioRobot Kit (Qiagen). Sequencing reactions were performed with the BDT V 3.1 reaction mix using the SL1-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/104

specific primer BJ234 (5'-GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3').
EST analysis and gene-specific primer design
The proteins encoded by the SL1-transspliced genes in the
initial EST screen were identified by BLASTX searches of
WormBase and the non-redundant database at GenBank
[42-44]. Sequences of selected genes were aligned manually with the help of the Seqpup 0.6 f software for Macintosh. Sequence stretches conserved between Pristionchus
and Koerneria sp. were chosen to design gene-specific
generic RT-PCR primers (Additional file 1). The primers
were checked for secondary structures and compatibility
to the SL1-primer BJ234 and the oligo(dT)-primer
RH5620 with the help of the OLIGO 4.0 software (MedProbe, Oslo, Norway).
RT-PCR of ribosomal proteins genes
RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with the help of
the Omniscript reverse transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) and the primer RH5620 (s. construction of EST
libraries). Complete transcripts were synthesized by RTPCR in two overlapping fragments per gene. The SL1-specific primer BJ234 (5'-GGTTTAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3')
was used together with the gene-specific antisense primers
to obtain the 5' parts of the transcripts and the combination of RH5620 and the sense primers to obtain the 3'
parts. The PCR was performed with the help of the HotStar Taq Plus DNA polymerase kit (Qiagen) including 1×
Q solution in the reaction mix. Conditions were initial
activation of the enzyme at 95°C for 5 min, followed by
40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, primer
annealing at 50°C for 30 sec, and primer extension at
72°C for 3 min. The reaction was completed by incubation at 72°C for 10 min. PCR fragments were electrophoresed through an 1.5% agarose gel, purified using the
Wizard SV gel purification kit (Promega) and sequenced
directly using the respective PCR primers. The sequences
have been deposited to the GenBank database and can be
retrieved under the Accession Numbers [GenBank:EF634493-EF635005].
Phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal protein genes
Sequences were aligned manually using the Seqpup 0.6 f
software for Macintosh [45]. The alignments were
inspected for the presence of coding open reading frames,
which were then confirmed by comparison to the C. elegans and C. briggsae orthologues. Genes that were either
duplicated in Caenorhabditis or appeared to be present in
more than one copy in Pristionchus were omitted from the
analysis. Reliable coding sequences (from codons 3 to 8,
depending on the gene, through the termination codon)
were concatenated and subjected to analysis by Modeltest
3.7 to determine the best-fit nucleotide substitution
model for maximum likelihood analysis (ML) by likeli-

hood ratio tests (LRT) using the Akaike information criterion [27,46]. Only Pristionchus sequences were used for
parameter determination. The selected settings corresponded to the GTR+G+I model with 6 substitution types
(A-C = 0.6105, A-G = 1.3696, A-T = 1.1141, C-G = 0.9545,
C-T = 6.1059, G-T = 1.0000), assumed nucleotide frequencies of A = 0.25540, C = 0.31530, G = 0.25700, T =
0.17230, assumed proportion of invariable sites I =
0.5307, rates at variable sites following the γ distribution
with shape parameter α = 0.7072.
The phylogenetic reconstruction was performed by the
heuristic search algorithm of the PAUP*4.0b10 software
using the parameters of the selected substitution model
and the likelihood optimality criterion [28]. The branchswapping algorithm was set to tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR). Neighbor joining (NJ) trees using the BIONJ
method and maximum parsimony (MP) trees were drawn
by the same program [29,47]. Alignment gaps were eliminated from the analysis. All resulting trees showed the
same topology. Support for the tree topology was
obtained by 1000 bootstrap replications using the NJ or
MP algorithms [48]. Likelihood mapping of individual
nodes was performed with the help of the program TREEPUZZLE 5.2 [32,33]. Additional support for the tree
topology was obtained by Bayesian analysis using the
MrBayes 3.2.1 software for Macintosh [31]. The evolutionary model was set to GTR+I+G. The analysis was run
for 150,000 generations with a burn-in time of 37,500
generations and a sampling frequency of 1 in 100 generations. Frequencies of synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions were determined using the MEGA 3.1 software [24].
