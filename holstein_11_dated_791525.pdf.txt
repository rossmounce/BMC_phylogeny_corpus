A dated phylogeny and collection records reveal
repeated biome shifts in the African genus
Coccinia (Cucurbitaceae)
Norbert Holstein*, Susanne S Renner

Abstract
Background: Conservatism in climatic tolerance may limit geographic range expansion and should enhance the
effects of habitat fragmentation on population subdivision. Here we study the effects of historical climate change,
and the associated habitat fragmentation, on diversification in the mostly sub-Saharan cucurbit genus Coccinia,
which has 27 species in a broad range of biota from semi-arid habitats to mist forests. Species limits were inferred
from morphology, and nuclear and plastid DNA sequence data, using multiple individuals for the widespread
species. Climatic tolerances were assessed from the occurrences of 1189 geo-referenced collections and WorldClim
variables.
Results: Nuclear and plastid gene trees included 35 or 65 accessions, representing up to 25 species. The data
revealed four species groups, one in southern Africa, one in Central and West African rain forest, one widespread
but absent from Central and West African rain forest, and one that occurs from East Africa to southern Africa.
A few individuals are differently placed in the plastid and nuclear (LFY) trees or contain two ITS sequence types,
indicating hybridization. A molecular clock suggests that the diversification of Coccinia began about 6.9 Ma ago,
with most of the extant species diversity dating to the Pliocene. Ancestral biome reconstruction reveals six
switches between semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest, and members of several species pairs differ significantly
in their tolerance of different precipitation regimes.
Conclusions: The most surprising findings of this study are the frequent biome shifts (in a relatively small clade)
over just 6 - 7 million years and the limited diversification during and since the Pleistocene. Pleistocene climate
oscillations may have been too rapid or too shallow for full reproductive barriers to develop among fragmented
populations of Coccinia, which would explain the apparently still ongoing hybridization between certain species.
Steeper ecological gradients in East Africa and South Africa appear to have resulted in more advanced allopatric
speciation there.

Background
Clades will typically retain their ecological characteristics, at least over moderate periods of evolutionary time
[1,2], and where inherited climatic tolerances are narrow, this will limit species’ geographic range expansion.
As long as the inherited component of ecological preference is strong, species evolving in allopatry should initially have similar habitat requirements, and ecological
differences between them should accumulate gradually
[3]. These arguments set up expectations about how

Strasse 67, Munich, Germany

climate niches and species ranges in groups of related
species should correlate with each other. Phylogeographic analyses of several African plant clades have
found strong signal of Neogene habitat fragmentation
and opportunity for allopatric speciation [4-8], but provided no quantitative data on ecological requirements of
the species involved. Davis et al. [9] in their study of 11
species of the Malpighiaceae genus Acridocarpus showed
that aridification in Eastern Africa apparently was
accompanied by a small radiation, possibly involving
niche shifts, but did not have details on species’ drought
tolerances. For a clade of tropical African Annonaceae,
Couvreur et al. [10] inferred divergence events between

East and West African rainforest species during the
Pliocene and Miocen, but provided no data on niche
shifts. A likely reason for the comparative neglect of tropical African plant groups in eco-evolutionary studies is
that ranges are poorly known because the underlying
occurrence data are too incomplete [11,12]. Related
problems are a lack of monographic studies, poorly
understood species boundaries, and few species-level
phylogenies, the precondition for identifying sister
species.
While African plant clades are thus underrepresented
in eco-phylogenetic studies, the immense interest in primate evolution in Africa has resulted in a wealth of data
on vegetation and climate history [13-15]. During the
Middle Miocene, starting from about 16 Ma onwards,
the African continent underwent gradual cooling and
uplift in the east and south, leading to an expansion of
woodlands and savannas, and reducing the ranges of
lowland rain forest species [15-17]. By the Upper Miocene, 7 Ma ago, rifting and volcanism blocked precipitation, amplifying the overall aridification in East Africa
[18,19]. The early Pliocene brought slightly warmer climates until c. 3.2 Ma [20], when the African tropics
began experiencing dramatic climate changes that lasted
throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene [21-24]. During the driest and coolest periods of the Pleistocene
(2.6 Ma - 12,000 years ago), rain forests may have been
restricted to refugia from which they re-expanded during more favorable periods [25-28]. The Quaternary climate oscillations affected all of equatorial Africa [29],
with the most recent catastrophic destruction of rain
forest occurring 2500 years ago [30].
Here we investigate clade diversification and changes in
species’ precipitation niches in the African cucurbit
genus Coccinia. Coccinia comprises 27 species (all of
them dioecious) and is almost confined to sub-Saharan
Africa where it diversified into numerous habitat types.
The only species that “escaped” from sub-Saharan Africa
is C. grandis, which spread to the highlands of the Arabian Peninsula and tropical Asia, and is now an invasive
weed on the Pacific Islands and in the Neotropics [31].
Pollination of Coccinia is by bees [[32]; NH, personal
observation in Tanzania, August 2009], including honeybees. The numerous habitat types occupied by its 27 species make Coccinia a suiTable system in which to study
niche evolution among close relatives. The niche parameters we focus on are annual precipitation and number
of arid months, with species’ tolerances being inferred
from the occurrences of 1189 geo-referenced collections.
Likely past changes in species’ ecological preferences
were inferred from a time-calibrated molecular tree
including all but two of the species. We expected that
close relatives would have similar climatic niche envelopes (e.g., drought tolerances), although clearly there had

to have been at least two shifts since different Coccinia
species occur in semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest,
vegetation types with contrasting precipitation regimes.

Results
Phylogenetic Reconstruction and Divergence Time
Estimates

The concatenated plastid DNA alignment comprised
4551 nucleotides from 65 accessions representing 25 of
the 27 species of Coccinia. Table 1 lists all DNA sources
with their geographic origin, species name and author,
and GenBank accession numbers. A maximum likelihood tree (Figure 1) obtained from the plastid data
(TreeBASE accession 10846) shows four major groups:
A quinqueloba group that occurs in southern Africa, a
barteri clade that mostly occurs in Central and West
African rain forest, an adoensis clade that is widespread,
but absent from Central and West African rain forest,
and a rehmannii clade that occurs from Ethiopia via
East Africa to southern Africa.
The nuclear LFY 2 nd intron alignment (TreeBASE
accession 10846) comprised 463 characters for 35 accessions, representing 20 species of Coccinia plus three
outgroups. A maximum likelihood tree from these data
(Figure 2) does not contradict the plastid tree topology
except for a few accessions in the C. adoensis and
C. barteri clades discussed below, and an accession of
C. sessilifolia, which in the nuclear tree groups with the
quinqueloba group, but in the plastid tree groups with
the adoensis clade.
A tree from the nuclear ITS alignment is almost unresolved (data not shown), but ITS sequences helped pinpoint suspected hybridization (Figure 3; see the section
on Evidence for Hybridization). For example, individuals of C. adoensis from different parts of the species’
range have different ITS sequences.
A chronogram from a slightly reduced plastid DNA
data set (Figure 4a) shows the inferred absolute ages
(with 95% confidence intervals) for nodes with >0.98
posterior probability. The diversification of Coccinia
apparently began 6.9 Ma ago (10.2 - 3.9 Ma, 95% highest posterior density [HPD]), with most of the extant
species diversity dating to the Pliocene.
Climatic Tolerances and Biome Preferences among Close
Relatives

Differences in climatic tolerances for species in wellsupported clades were quantified by pair-wise MannWhitney U tests, focusing on annual precipitation and
number of arid months (Table 2a - c). After each species or unit (in the case of the three genotypes of
C. adoensis) had been assigned to one of three habitat
categories (semi-arid habitats, woodland, or forest; see
Methods), maximum likelihood inference of habitat

Figure 1 Phylogeny for Coccinia based on plastid DNA sequence data. Phylogenetic relationships in Coccinia based on 4,551 nucleotides of
concatenated plastid DNA sequences obtained for 69 accessions and analyzed under maximum likelihood (ML) and the GTR + Γ model.
Numbers below branches refer to ML bootstrap support > 75%. The dots at nodes and behind the two brackets refer to uniquely shared indels
(Methods). The naming of the clades follows that in the nuclear tree (Figure 2). A single accession of C. sessilifolia in the nuclear tree groups with
the C. quinqueloba clade, but the plastid data do not contain sufficient signal to resolve the placement of this species.

shifts on the phylogeny and the Mann-Whitney U tests
revealed at least six habitat changes (marked by red
arrows in Figure 4b), counting only changes in statistically supported sister species or clades. Differentiation
of precipitation preferences within habitat category (e.g.,
in C. quinqueloba versus C. mackenii, Table 2a) was not
counted as a biome shift.
We next tested whether the number of pairs of species
that have the same niche preferences differs from that
obtained if species habitat distributions were drawn at
random (proportion 0.635). Among the 27 nodes in the
phylogeny, 6 involved habitat shifts (red arrows in
Figure 4), which is significantly fewer than the expected

number of 17 (G = 9.4, df = 1, P = 0.0021). Even when
the four most basal nodes are deleted from the analysis
owing to the ambiguity of their character states, the
phylogeny still includes significantly fewer habitat shifts
than expected at random (G = 6.5, df = 1, P = 0.011).
Thus, occupation of one of our three habitat categories
appears to be a statistically conservative trait in the
sense that daughter lineages tend to retain habitat type
more frequently than expected by chance, given that the
random probabilities are estimated from the current distributions of species. The next sections briefly describe
the geography and timing of the inferred six shifts
between semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest.

Figure 2 Phylogeny for Coccinia based on nuclear data. Phylogenetic relationships in Coccinia based on 463 nucleotides of the nuclear LFY
2nd intron, obtained for 35 accessions from 23 species analyzed under maximum likelihood (ML) and the GTR + Γ model. Numbers below
branches refer to ML bootstrap support > 75%. The dots at nodes and behind the two brackets refer to uniquely shared indels. The tree was
rooted on Peponium vogelii (not shown).

The Coccinia quinqueloba group comprises four species and began diversifying c. 5 Ma (7.5 - 2.4 95% HPD)
ago. Its divergence times and habitat preferences are
shown in Figure 4, geographic ranges in Figure 5b, and
precipitation tolerances in Figure 6. The species in this
group occur in two habitat categories (forest and semiarid habitat), and there was at least one niche shift in
terms of the tolerated precipitation regime. The three
forest species (of which C. mackenii and C. quinqueloba
have identical sequences in 3503 nucleotides) diverged
around 2.8 Ma (4.7 - 1.1 95% HPD) ago, during the Late
Pliocene to Pleistocene.
The Coccinia barteri clade includes eight Central and
West African species plus the East African (Tanzanian)

the species’ geographic ranges (except for Coccinia spec.
nov.; Table 1 provides the vouchers and code numbers
for each sequenced plant) and Figure 6 their climatic
tolerances. Diversification of this clade began 5 Ma
(7.6 - 2.7 95% HPD; Figure 4a) ago, that is, at the beginning of the Early Pliocene warming. Most of the species
occur in lowland rain forests or mountain forests at
elevations up to 2900 m, although C. barteri and
C. heterophylla also have been collected in humid semideciduous forests and clearings. Coccinia spec. nov.
represents a biome shift from rain forest to semi-humid
savanna (our woodland category). Coccinia barteri is
morphologically diverse, and based on herbarium material, species boundaries in the barteri clade tend to be
cryptic (Table 3).
The Coccinia adoensis clade comprises nine species
and includes at least two biome shifts (Figure 4b). The
first involves the sister species C. grandiflora and
C. schliebenii, which occur in (rain-) forests of East
Africa (Figures 4b and 7), while their widespread relative
C. adoensis occurs in mountain grasslands, deciduous
woodlands, and rarely in moister bushlands (> 450 mm
annual precipitation, < 7 months of aridity) from South
Africa to Ethiopia and to Nigeria. The deeper split is
dated to the Late Pleistocene (c. 2.1 Ma ago), while
C. grandiflora/C. schliebenii separated from each other

involves C. ogadensis and C. grandis, which are adapted
to semi-arid conditions (Figure 4b).
The Coccinia rehmannii clade, which started diversifying during an arid period at the end of the Miocene 5.2
Ma (7.9 - 2.8 95% HPD) ago (Figure 4a), comprises five
species (Figure 7: blue dots) and two biome switches
(Figure 4b). The split between C. abyssinica and
C. megarrhiza dates to c. 3.9 Ma ago, at the end of the
warm and humid Early Pliocene, and that of C. rehmannii from C. microphylla and C. trilobata to c. 3.2 Ma,
during the humid Late Pliocene. The climate tolerances
of the five species are shown in Figure 6.
Evidence for Hybridization

One of the incongruities between the nuclear and plastid DNA tree topologies concerns C. racemiflora from
rain forests of west equatorial Africa. In the plastid tree

(Figure 1), C. racemiflora 1 and C. racemiflora 2 group
together and share a 490 bp deletion in trnS GCU trnGUCC intergenic spacer. Morphologically, these two
plants appear to represent the same species. However,
in the nuclear LFY tree (Figures 2), C. racemiflora 1
groups with C. barteri 4 while C. racemiflora 2 groups
with C. barteri 6. The latter plant is morphologically
intermediate between C. barteri and C. racemiflora and
may present a hybrid.
Two other incongruities concern C. adoensis (compare
accessions 1 to 9 in Figure 1-3). First, in the plastid tree
(Figure 1), C. adoensis accessions from East Africa cluster with the East African C. grandiflora and C. schliebenii, while pubescent C. adoensis accessions 1 and 6 from
South Africa (originally described as C. pubescens) cluster with a glabrous C. adoensis 9 from southern Zambia.
In the nuclear LFY tree (Figure 2), C. adoensis 2, which
in the plastid tree clustered with East African plants,

instead groups with C. adoensis 9 (South African
C. adoensis plants did not yield LFY sequences). The
ITS alignment (Figure 3) reveals that single individuals
of C. adoensis can have two kinds of sequences:
C. adoensis 5 from Zambia (sister to adoensis 2 in the
plastid DNA data; Figure 1) harbors sequences matching
C. adoensis 1 from South Africa as well as sequences
matching C. adoensis 2 from Namibia. Second, in the
plastid tree, East African C. adoensis are distant from
C. aurantiaca, while in the nuclear tree they are in a
polytomy with C. aurantiaca and C. adoensis 9.

Discussion
At the outset of this study, we expected minimally two
biome shifts, this being the number required to explain
the presence of Coccinia in semi-arid habitats, woodland, and forest. Instead, we found six statistically significant biome shifts among close relatives (marked in
Figure 4b). However, this is still fewer than if the habitats were distributed on the phylogeny at random. The
onset of Coccinia diversification dates to just 6.9 Ma
ago, a time when the warm and humid climate began to
become cooler and drier. Climatic conditions then continued to oscillate during the Pliocene and Quaternary

(Background). Additionally, the East African rifting led
to aridification and more open grasslands starting at 7 8 Ma ago [15], [19]. Depending on species’ ecological
tolerances, these climate fluctuations must have caused
range reduction and fragmentation, or expansion and
merging. The likely ancestral precipitation preferences
of the Coccinia clade remain unresolved (Figure 4b); the
sister genus, Diplocyclos, which comprises four species,
is restricted to rain forest and semi-deciduous woodlands [31].
The 12 forest species of Coccinia all have discontinuous distributional ranges, as exemplified by C. grandiflora (Figure 7), fitting with forest expansion during
Pleistocene interglacials that likely reconnected most
forest refugia [33]. Survival in persisting refugia probably
explains the populations of C. subsessiliflora in the
southern Sudanese Imatong Mts. (Figure 5a), of C. barteri in the mountain region between Zimbabwe and
Mozambique, and of C. mildbraedii in the Eastern Arc
Mts. For C. heterophylla, which occurs in the Angola
Escarpment at 15°30’S (Figure 5a), mist-saturated local
vegetation pockets [34] may have offered survival possibilities during dry periods, while the presence of
C. mildbraedii in the Kenyan highlands (Figure 5a), may

result from introduction by humans (fide label information on the specimen J. B. Gillett 20185, MO, NHT). It
nevertheless shows that Central African species would
probably find suitable habitats in East Africa if forest
expansion advanced further.

The Coccinia barteri clade is interesting in containing
two rain forest species (C. longicarpa and C. keayana) with
overlapping distributions (Figure 5a) and co-occurrence in
the same habitats (e.g., in the Banco Forest Reserve, Abidjan, Ivory Coast). They likely descend from a widespread

ancestral species, the range of which became fragmented during the cool/dry mid-Pliocene, with C. longicarpa becoming restricted to southwestern Ghana and
C. keayana to Liberia, fitting with Maley’s [25] refugia.
Today, C. longicarpa is also distributed east of the
Dahomey Gap (arrow in Figure 5), an abrupt climatically induced rain forest disjunction in West Africa.
Although forest fragmentation during glacial periods
likely was severe, present range disruptions in Central
and West Africa seem to date only to the recent Holocene [35]. Recurrent fragmentation and reconnection
of populations during the Pleistocene apparently led to
hybridization and introgression, which would explain
the high morphological and genetic variability in C.
barteri (Figure 1, Table 3).
Among the few species of Coccinia that appear to
have originated during and since the Pleistocene are the
forest species C. grandiflora/C. schliebenii from East
Africa and C. quinqueloba/C. mackenii (the latter identical in the markers sequenced here) from South Africa.
Each pair comprises morphologically similar species
with partly overlapping ranges (Figure 5 and 7). The
stronger aridity in East and southern Africa compared
to Central and West Africa seems to have led to Pleistocene allopatric speciation in these aridity intolerant species. That the range of C. schliebenii extends into
Ethiopia and the Didinga Mts. in southeastern Sudan
(Figure 7), which have similar amounts of precipitation,
probably reflects long-distance seed dispersal by birds
[36,37], rather than remnant populations from a once
continuous range. This is because intervening forests,

such as those of the Usambara Mts. and Mt. Kenya,
have been well collected, yet have not yielded
C. schliebenii.
Coccinia species of the rehmannii clade and other dryadapted species occur on either side of the Miombo belt
(with 3 - 6 months of aridity), but are absent from the
belt itself (Figure 7). The reason does not appear to be
the belt’s poor lateritic soils [38] since Coccinia species
can grow on such soils (C. microphylla: R. Wingfield
1351 and 2893, DSM; C. trilobata: R. Polhill &S. Paulo
962, K), and so are C. grandis (E. Westphal & J. M.
C. Westphal-Stevels 1385, MO, WAG; J. J. Lavranos &S.
Carter 23258, MO) and C. sessilifolia (G. Germishuizen
9384, MO; S. E. Chadwick 280, MO). Fire is an unlikely
explanation too, since Coccinia species have tubers and
can re-sprout. During the Pleistocene, the Miombo belt
apparently was crossable for ostriches and antelopes
[39,40], making its barrier role for Coccinia even more
difficult to understand.

Conclusions
The at least six biome shifts among the 27 species of
Coccinia analyzed here may be an underestimate
because of our assignments of species into just three
broad biome types, semi-arid habitats, woodland, and
forest. A fuller understanding of the physiological traits
behind tolerated precipitation regimes in Coccinia
would require transplants or common garden experiments [41]. The present results, based on occurrence
data and ecological information from herbarium specimen labels, however show that changes in ecological

tolerances (especially drought tolerance) have played an
important role in the diversification of Coccinia. A
strength of this study is that it is based on consistent
species concepts and geo-referenced data for well over
1000 collections.

GOET, H, HBG, HEID, K, M, MO, MSB, NHT, P, S,
UBT, WAG, and partly C, LISC, and LISU). Collecting
localities (and some ecological information) were taken
from herbarium specimen labels and geo-referenced
1189 of them with Google Earth, Google Maps (Google
Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), and online maps of the
Perry-Castañeda Library Map Collection (http://www.lib.
utexas.edu/maps/). Climate data were extracted from
the WorldClim database (http://www.worldclim.org;
[42]) using DIVA-GIS 7.1.6.2 (http://www.diva-gis.org).
The number of arid months was calculated by counting
how often the arithmetic mean of the monthly minimum and maximum temperature [°C] is larger than half
of the monthly precipitation [mm] [43]. For ancestral
state reconstruction, we assigned 24 species to one of
three habitat categories: Semi-arid habitats (which
includes semi-desert, bushlands, semi-arid savannas),
woodland (including habitats such as mountain shrublands, humid grasslands, semi-humid savannas), or forest (including semi-deciduous forest, lowland rain forest,
and mountain forest). Assignment of specimens/species
to habitats followed information given on herbarium
specimen labels and the WorldClim data for the respective location. Coccinia grandis, which occurs in African
bushlands and savannas as well as in ruderal sites
throughout the humid tropics, was coded as “semi-arid
habitats” to reflect its drought tolerance.
Differences in annual precipitation and number of arid
months tolerated by members of a species pair or a
small clade were tested by pair-wise Mann-Whitney U
tests in SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Trait
reconstructions were carried out in Mesquite 2.71 [44]
under maximum likelihood optimization, using the maximum clade credibility tree (with median heights) from
the plastid DNA data obtained from BEAST (below)
and Lewis’ [45] Markov k-state one parameter model.
Finally, we tested whether the number of pairs of species in which members share the same niche preferences
differs from that obtained if species habitat distributions
were distributed on the tree at random.
Molecular Phylogenetic Taxon Sampling and Methods

We sampled 25 of the 27 species of Coccinia for several
plastid and/or nuclear DNA markers. Only the poorly
collected species Coccinia pwaniensis Holstein [46] and
C. variifolia A. Meeuse could not be included. Trees
were rooted on four outgroups, Cucumis sativus, Cucumis hirsutus, Peponium vogelii, and Scopellaria marginata, based on studies that included species from all
African genera of Cucurbitaceae [47,48]. DNA
was extracted from 3 - 20 mg of leaf tissue from herbarium specimens or silica-dried plant material, using
Macherey-Nagel plant extraction kits (Macherey-Nagel,
Düren, Germany). For some samples, the lysis buffer

Page 14 of 16

was altered by adding sodium meta bisulfite (S9000,
Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany) to a
10 mM final concentration [49]. PCR reactions used
standard conditions, except for the addition of bovine
serum albumine (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany).
We amplified the plastid intergenic spacers trnS GCU trnG UCC and the rpl20-rps12 using the primers of
Hamilton et al. [50], the ndhF-rpl32 spacer using the
primers of Shaw et al. [51], the matK gene and trnK
intron using the primers of Yokoyama et al. [52], and
the trnLUAA intron and trnLUAA-trnFGAA spacer using
the universal primers of Taberlet et al. [53]. PCR products were checked on a 1% agarose gel, and those with
multiple bands were run on a 2% agarose gel, cut,
and treated with the Wizard SV PCR clean-up kit (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Phusion high fidelity DNA
Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) was used for
recalcitrant and low-concentrated samples and to
amplify the 2nd intron in the nuclear LFY gene. Primers
for this region came from Volz and Renner [54] and
from a M.Sc. thesis carried out in our lab [55]: LFYubiq
F1: 5’-CAY CCN TTY ATH GTN CAN GAR CC-3’;
LFYubiq-R1: 5’-GCR TAR CAR TGN ACR TAR TGN
CKC AT- 3’.
The complete ITS region was amplified using the primers of Balthazar et al. [56]. Where necessary, we used
cloning to assess within-plant sequence divergence,
focusing on the polymorphic species. For cloning, we
ligated PCR products into plasmids of the Promega
pGEM-T Vector system (Promega). Plasmids were
transformed in ultra competent E. coli DH5alpha strains
[57]. Positive (white) plasmid colonies were picked from
the ampicillin blue/white selection agar plates, solved in
4 ml LB medium with 100 mg/ml ampicillin, and grown
over-night at 37°C. Plasmids were obtained using GeneElute Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and directly amplified with primer oligonucleotides and settings as
mentioned above. PCR products were purified and
sequenced, using the same primers. Sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 3130 Avant capillary sequencer
using Pop-7 polymer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA), and sequences were edited with Sequencher
v. 4.6 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Alignment, Phylogenetic Inference and Divergence Time
Estimation

Sequences were aligned by eye, using MacClade v. 4.06
[58]. We excluded ambiguously alignable regions and
structurally homoplastic sections. This concerned a total
of 219 alignment positions in the plastid data (mostly
microsatellites) and 42 nucleotides in the nuclear LFY
matrix. Tree inference relied on maximum likelihood
and was carried out in RAxML v. 7.2.2 [59], with the

final parameter evaluation done under the GTR + Γ
substitution model. We used this model to approximate
the best-fit models found with Modeltest v. 3.7 [60],
which under a hierarchical likelihood ratio test indicated
the F81 + I + Γ model as the best fit for the combined
plastid data, while under the Akaike information criterion it found TVM + I + Γ as the best fit. Statistical support for individual nodes was assessed via bootstrapping
with 100 replicates [61]. Nucleotide insertions and deletions (indels) were plotted on the resulting tree to test
whether they contained phylogenetic information.
Divergence times were inferred using the program
BEAST v. 1.5.2 [62], which employs a Bayesian Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to co-estimate
topology, substitution rates, and node ages. The input
data consisted of a matrix comprising 26 accessions
from 24 species of Coccinia (C. mackenii and C. quinqueloba had identical sequences, and the former was
therefore removed) and six outgroup accessions. There
are no Coccinia fossils, and we therefore used a secondary calibration from a fossil-calibrated Cucurbitaceaewide dating analysis [48] that obtained an age of 15
million years (Ma), with a standard deviation of 3.0 Ma,
for the split between Coccinia and Diplocyclos. We used
this age as a prior constraint on the root node of Coccinia, with a normal distribution and a standard deviation
(SD) of 2.6 Ma. A SD of 2.7 Ma (or larger) resulted in
poor convergence of the MCMC chain. We used a strict
clock model (which we preferred because we have a single secondary constraint), a Yule process tree prior, and
MCMC chains of 10 million generation length, with
parameters sampled every 1000th generation. The first
20% of the trees was discarded as burn-in, and convergence and mixing of the chain were assessed by consistency across runs, inspection of trace plots in the
program TRACER v. 1.4.1 [62], and from the effective
sample sizes (ESS), which were well above 1000 for all
estimated parameters. Four independent BEAST runs
yielded the same maximum clade credibility topology,
and we also ran an analysis without the data to verify
that the effective priors do not contradict the original
priors and to assess the informativeness of the data. The
cut-off for nodes to be considered in the chronogram
was ≥ 0.98 posterior probability.
