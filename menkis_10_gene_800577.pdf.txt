Gene genealogies indicates abundant gene
conversions and independent evolutionary
histories of the mating-type chromosomes in the
evolutionary history of Neurospora tetrasperma
Audrius Menkis1, Carrie A Whittle2, Hanna Johannesson2*

Abstract
Background: The self-fertile filamentous ascomycete Neurospora tetrasperma contains a large (~7 Mbp) and young
(< 6 MYA) region of suppressed recombination within its mating-type (mat) chromosomes. The objective of the
present study is to reveal the evolutionary history, including key genomic events, associated with the various
regions of the mat chromosomes among ten strains representing all the nine known species (lineages) contained
within the N. tetrasperma species complex.
Results: Comparative analysis of sequence divergence among alleles of 24 mat-linked genes (mat A and mat a)
indicates that a large region of suppressed recombination exists within the mat chromosome for each of nine
lineages of N. tetrasperma sensu latu. The recombinationally suppressed region varies in size and gene composition
among lineages, and is flanked on both ends by normally recombining regions. Genealogical analyses among
lineages reveals that eight gene conversion events have occurred between homologous mat A and mat a-linked
alleles of genes located within the region of restricted recombination during the evolutionary history of N.
tetrasperma.
Conclusions: We conclude that the region of suppressed recombination in the mat chromosomes has likely been
subjected to independent contraction and/or expansion during the evolutionary history of the N. tetrasperma
species complex. Furthermore, we infer that gene conversion events are likely a common phenomenon within this
recombinationally suppressed genomic region. We argue that gene conversions might provide an efficient
mechanism of adaptive editing of functional genes, including the removal of deleterious mutations, within the
young recombinationally suppressed region of the mat chromosomes.

Background
Neurospora tetrasperma is a self-fertile filamentous
ascomycete containing a large (~7 Mbp) and young (< 6
MYA) region of suppressed recombination within its
mating-type (mat) chromosomes. The mat chromosomes are the largest contained within the N. tetrasperma genome, consisting of more than 9 Mbp and
2000 ORFs http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/neurospora/. As in most filamentous ascomycetes,
the N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes contain the mat
locus, which determines haploid sexual identity and is

composed of two highly dissimilar alleles (mat A and
mat a idiomorphs) [1,2]. In contrast to self-incompatible
(heterothallic) Neurospora species such as N. crassa,
which require a partner containing nuclei of opposite
mating-type for reproduction [2], N. tetrasperma is selffertile (pseudohomothallic), such that heterokaryotic
sexual spores contain haploid nuclei of both mating
types that are required for reproduction [3,4]. Modified
programs of meiosis and spore development in N. tetrasperma lead to the packaging of two haploid nuclei of
opposite mating type into each sexual progeny, and a
key feature of the N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes is
the presence of a large recombinationally suppressed
region surrounding (and including) the mat locus. This

feature makes N. tetrasperma a highly suitable model
system for the study of divergence in recombinationally
suppressed regions, since self-fertilization renders normally recombining genes largely homoallelic while
restriction of recombination leads to allelic divergence
[5,6].
The N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes share many
features with dimorphic plant and animal sex chromosomes. For example, the region of suppressed recombination has been found to contain evolutionary strata, i.e.
segments with different levels of divergence among mat
A and mat a linked alleles, which is consistent with
expansion of the region of suppressed recombination
over time [6]. Furthermore, they contain normally
recombining regions, which flank the segment of suppressed recombination on both ends [6-8]; each of
which are traits found in ancient sex chromosomes
[6,9,10]. In contrast to most sex chromosomes, however,
the N. tetrasperma region of suppressed recombination
is relatively young, and thus has not undergone the massive degeneration observed in sex chromosomes from
most other taxa, e.g. gene losses and saturated divergence levels in the Y chromosome of humans and Drosophila [11,12], which prevents the study of early
genomic changes in sex chromosome evolution in those
systems [9,13]. Thus, the N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes provide an effective model system to reveal the
genomic events associated with early stages of sex chromosome evolution. In particular, this system is especially
suited for the study of the evolutionary history of the
region of recombination suppression, including genomic
events such as gene conversions.
Gene conversion is the non-reciprocal transfer of
information from one DNA duplex to another [14].
Empirical evidence for ectopic gene conversions between
paralogous genes along non-recombining sex chromosomes has been demonstrated for the Y chromosome of
humans and primates [15-17] and for the avian W chromosome [18]. In addition, indications for occasional
ancestral episodes of gene conversion from × to Y have
been found in several organisms including humans
[15,19]. It may be postulated that gene conversions
between non-recombining chromosomes could counteract the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations,
which is predicted to occur in the absence of recombination [9,20,21]. If present, this phenomenon of preventing genomic degeneration by gene conversions might be
highly advantageous in young regions of recombination
suppression, such as in the N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes, because mutations would likely convert functional genes to non-functional genes at this stage of
recombination suppression. Thus, an investigation of
gene conversions in N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes
is warranted.

One highly advantageous feature of N. tetrasperma for
the study of evolutionary history and genomic events
such as gene conversions in the mat chromosomes is
the fact that this taxon is comprised of independent and
closely related species. In particular, recent comparative
analyses of a genetically and geographically diverse
selection of strains have revealed that N. tetrasperma
constitutes a species complex of at least nine species [5]
(with largely unresolved phylogenetic relationships).
These species fulfill phylogenetic species recognition criteria and are by laboratory crossings shown to be reproductively isolated, and are referred to as N. tetrasperma
phylogenetic lineages 1-9 [5]. In addition, all these nine
species are pseudohomothallic [5]. The existence of
independent phylogenetic species of N. tetrasperma provides a novel opportunity to examine the evolutionary
history of the mat chromosomes because genomic
events, including gene conversions and variation in the
border for the region of suppressed recombination, may
be detected by comparison of allelic composition of
genes within and among species.
The objective of the present study is to identify key
genomic events in the evolutionary history of the mat
chromosomes within N. tetrasperma. For this, we
obtained DNA-sequence information from 24 genes
located on each of the mat chromosomes (mat A and
mat a) for each of the nine known lineages in the
N. tetrasperma species complex. Genes were chosen to
represent different parts of the chromosome, and comparative analyses of mat A and mat a-linked alleles of
these genes were performed to identify the location of
the region of suppressed recombination within the
lineages, and to assess whether gene conversions and
other genomic events (e.g., crossovers) play a key role in
the evolution of this region among these lineages.

Results
Sequence divergence of the alleles located on the mat
chromosomes in N. tetrasperma lineages

For our analyses, we generated a dataset consisting of
partial sequences of 24 genes located on the mat chromosomes in N. tetrasperma. The relative chromosomal
location of the genes, based on gene order in N. crassa,
is shown in Figure 1. The sequences were obtained from
20 single mating-type strains of N. tetrasperma (ten
pairs of mat A and mat a strains originating from heterokaryotic strains isolated from nature, see Methods
and Table 1). All known phylogenetic lineages of the N.
tetrasperma species complex were represented by one
pair of strains in our dataset, with the exception of lineage 8 for which two pairs were included as a reference
for intraspecific variation (Table 1). The N. tetrasperma
lineages examined in this study have been assigned
alpha-numeric names ranging between L1 and L9

of investigated genes, the mat locus and the centromere are indicated. Horizontal bars show the region of lineage-specific expansion of nonrecombining region and instances of gene conversions and crossovers between the two chromosomes in nine lineages of N. tetrasperma.

(Table 1). The sequence alignments are available from
TreeBASE (study accession no. S10701). The gene order
within the N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes was
assumed to parallel that observed in N. crassa in all our
analyses (based on previous findings [6,22]; see http://
www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/neurospora/.
The divergence level (dN, dS and intron polymorphisms) between the mat A and mat a-linked alleles for
each of the ten paired comparisons is shown in Table 2.
The data shows that the alleles of nearly all genes
located in the two chromosome flanks were homoallelic
for each pair (Table 2). We interpret the homoallelism
as a consequence of recombination; this is because
genes in a normally recombining chromosomal segment
should be identical or nearly identical between the two
mat chromosomes in a highly self-fertilizing taxon such
as N. tetrasperma [5]. Three exceptions to this pattern
were found for the chromosome pairs: L3A-L3a shows
divergence for genes os-1 and phr, L4A-L4a for the
genes nit-2 and krev-1, and L5A-L5a for the gene prd-4
(Table 2). In each of these cases the divergence was

caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism, and could
result from very rare outcrossing events in this highly
inbred taxon [5]. Altogether, these results demonstrate
that genes are highly homoallelic in the chromosome
flanks of the mat chromosomes of natural strains of
N. tetrasperma, and that this is most likely due to normal recombination.
In contrast to the chromosome flanks, the results
show that the vast majority of the genes located in the
central segment of the mat chromosomes have marked
divergence between the mat A and mat a-linked alleles
(Table 2). We attribute this result to suppressed recombination in this segment of the chromosomes for all
lineages of N. tetrasperma. However, lineage-specific
exceptions to this pattern were also found, for example
the gene lys-4 showed divergence among mat A and
mat a-linked alleles in all lineages except for lineage 4,
in which this gene was homoallelic. Based on the gene
order in N. crassa, this gene is located in the recombinationally suppressed region of the N. tetrasperma mat
chromosomes (Table 2).

Genealogies of genes along the mat chromosomes of
N. tetrasperma

Gene genealogies of the 24 investigated genes, spanning
each of N. tetrasperma lineages examined herein, are
depicted in Figure 2 and in Additional file 1: Figure S1.
Genealogies are depicted in the sequential order of the
genes in N. crassa. For the genes located in the recombining chromosomal ends (ro-10, nit-2, krev-1 and sod-1 on
the left flank and os-1, prd-4, arg-13 and phr on the right
flank), alleles linked to the mat A and mat a chromosomes
do not cluster separately by significantly supported
branches for the various lineages, rather they cluster primarily by lineage (Additional file 1: Figure S1). In contrast,
for the genes in the central part of the mat chromosomes,
ranging from mus-42 to lys-3, the mat A and mat a-linked
alleles cluster separately for at least one of the ten N. tetrasperma pairs examined (Figure 2). The pattern of clustering of the alleles is summarized in Figure 1.
In regions of the mat chromosome where recombination cessation predates divergence of the N. tetrasperma

lineages [6], all alleles from mat A strains are expected
to cluster separately from the alleles of the mat a strains
in the gene genealogies. This pattern was not found in
any of the genealogies (Figure 1), which could be the
result of gene conversions, occasional crossovers, introgressions and/or independent origin of the recombination suppression in different lineages of N. tetrasperma.
Indications of gene conversions between mat
chromosomes in N. tetrasperma

We visually inspected windows of three neighboring
genealogies along the chromosomes (Figure 1), and
interpreted a gene conversion event to have taken place
when two alleles of a pair (i.e., mat A versus mat
a-linked alleles originating from a single lineage) cluster
together in one genealogy, flanked by two genealogies in
which the alleles for this specific pair are found in two
different clades, at least one of which significantly supported by PAUP bootstrap analyses. For example, the
two different alleles of lys-4 gene of L4A and L4a cluster

Figure 2 Gene genealogies of 16 genes in the region of suppressed recombination of the mating-type (mat) chromosomes of
Neurospora tetrasperma. The genes are visualized horizontally in a consecutive order according to gene order in Neurospora crassa, from left
to right flank of the chromosomes. The position of the mat locus and the centromere are indicated. Alleles from mat chromosomes originating
from wild-type heterokaryons are indicated by strain ID given in Table 1, and strains of the same phylogenetic species in the N. tetrasperma
species complex are marked with the same color. Gene conversion events are boxed and indicated by yellow stars. Alleles of genes marked in
bold italic were used as template for gene conversion.

together, while in eth-1 alleles from this pair cluster
separately, similarly as found in the centromere-distal
neighboring gene cys-9: this pattern was interpreted as
the result of a gene conversion between the two lys-4
alleles of L4A and L4a, with the mat a-linked allele
used as a template for gene conversion. Using this
approach to identify potential gene conversions, a total
of eight gene conversion events were found between
homologous alleles of the chromosomal region of suppressed recombination (indicated by stars in Figure 2,
and summarized in Figure 1).
We traced the ancestry of the aforementioned gene
conversions. For this, we identified the alleles subjected
to gene conversion that were identical among multiple
lineages; in these cases we concluded that the gene conversion occurred before the split of the lineages. We
found that one gene conversion (in ser-3) was traced
back to a common ancestor of N. tetrasperma lineages 3
and 8, and one (cys-5) to a common ancestor of N. tetrasperma lineages 5 and 6. In arg-1, a gene conversion
is assumed to have taken place early after the radiation
of the N. tetrasperma phylogenetic lineage 3, affecting
more than one heterokaryon of this lineage (L3A and
L3a do not originate from the same natural heterokaryon, see Table 1). In four genes, cys-5, ser-3, lys-4 and
ad-9, the clustering of the alleles in the genealogies suggests that the mat a-linked alleles were used as template
for gene conversion, and in two genes, ser-3 and arg-1,
our data suggests gene conversions in the opposite
direction, i.e. the mat A-linked alleles were used as template (Figure 1, Figure 2).
Evidence of occasional crossovers between the mat
chromosomes in N. tetrasperma

The study of the gene genealogies (Figure 2) gives indications for a crossover between the mat chromosomes
in phylogenetic lineage 4, at a location between upr-1
and erg-8. For the genes left of erg-8 the alleles of L4a
clusters consistently together with alleles of strains L3a,
L8(1)a and L8(2)a while the alleles for L4A clusters with
alleles of strains L7a and L3A. In contrast, for erg-1 and
the genes right of this gene, the alleles of L4A and L4a
have swapped position in the genealogies (Figure 2). For
several additional pairs of mat chromosomes we found
other, less clear, indications of crossovers in that alleles
from one mating-type component strain clustered
together with alleles from sister-lineages of the opposite
mating-type component (Figure 2).
Independent histories of the mat chromosomes in
N. tetrasperma lineages

The clustering of alleles of the genes located at the
edges between the central and distal chromosomal
region (i.e. mus-42 and rid on the left flank and al-1

Page 7 of 11

and lys-3 on the right flank; Figure 2), suggests a lineage-specific evolutionary history in these regions of the
mat chromosomes. For example, the rid genealogy
shows supported divergence of the mat A and mat alinked alleles in phylogenetic lineage 4 (L4). This is in
contrast to several other lineages, which are homoallelic
for rid and all genes left of this gene (Figure 1, 2 and
Additional file 1: Figure S1). Thus, this observation indicates that rid is located in the region of suppressed
recombination in L4, but is located in the recombining
region in other lineages. A similar pattern is found for
the genes on the right flanking region of the mat chromosomes, e.g. in gene lys-3, alleles of lineage 2 (L2),
lineage 5 (L5) and lineage 6 (L6) are separated by significantly supported branches, while alleles of lineage 4
(L4) are identical. In totality, these data support the
independent evolution of the border between the
recombining and the recombinationally suppressed
region among lineages in the N. tetrasperma species
complex.

Discussion
The present findings have shown that all known lineages
in the N. tetrasperma species complex contain similar
key features within the mat chromosomes. Specifically,
our data have revealed firstly, that the central segment
of the mat chromosomes contains genes wherein alleles
have markedly diverged, and secondly, that this region is
flanked by regions with very low, or no, divergence.
Although this pattern was previously shown for the mat
chromosomes for a single lineage (strain P581; belonging to phylogenetic lineage 6) [6], our present results
demonstrate that this is a general trait observed for all
lineages of N. tetrasperma. Based on the fact that normal recombination would be expected to homogenize
the gene alleles located on the two mat chromosomes in
a highly self-fertilizing taxon such as N. tetrasperma
[5,6], we conclude that the present findings are best
explained by the presence of suppressed recombination
in the central part of the mat chromosomes and normal
recombination within the flanking regions.
Differences in evolutionary history of the mat
chromosomes among lineages

Our data suggests that the evolutionary history of the
mat chromosomes differs among the various lineages of
N. tetrasperma. The phylogenetic relationship between
the lineages of the N. tetrasperma species complex is
unresolved [5], but assuming that lineage 9 is the most
basal lineage of N. tetrasperma, one explanation for this
finding is a contraction in the size of the recombinationally suppressed region in lineages 1-8 following their
divergence from lineage 9. Another plausible explanation for the independent evolution is that the segment

Menkis et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:234
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/234

with suppressed recombination was initially a small
region, which has expanded independently and to a different extent within lineages. Such “evolutionary strata”,
arising from successive expansion of recombination suppression, have been observed in a wide range of sex
chromosomes including those from humans, chickens
and plants [23-25] as well as for the mat chromosomes
for N. tetrasperma phylogenetic lineage 6 (strain P581)
[6]. This process is believed to be driven by natural
selection for linkage between the current region of suppressed recombination and sexually antagonistic loci (i.e.
beneficial to one sex but detrimental to the other)
[13,26,27]. However, given that differentiated sexes do
not exist in N. tetrasperma; individual haploid strains of
either mating-type are able to produce both male and
female reproductive structures, it is not known whether
such sexual antagonistic processes could play a role in
the emergence of evolutionary strata in this taxon.
Gene conversions

Data from our gene genealogies indicates that gene conversions between homologous genes of the mat chromosomes have occurred multiple times during the
evolutionary history of N. tetrasperma, despite the suppression of recombination. For the majority of the gene
conversion events observed in this region, two homologous gene copies of the mat chromosomes were completely homogenized, indicating that gene conversion
tracts (the DNA region affected by conversion) were
large and continuous, and likely extended beyond the
region of the gene investigated herein. Notably, for ser3, the alleles were not completely homogenized; however given that only one or two bp differences were
found among the alleles, it is not possible to differentiate between partial and complete gene conversions for
this specific gene. Although tracts of gene conversion
are usually relatively short in many systems, previous
reports from the fungal kingdom have shown tracts
of gene conversion in the same order of magnitude
(1.5 kb) as the regions studied here [28].
The totality of our findings suggests that gene conversion between homologous alleles of diverging chromosomes could be a significant evolutionary force shaping
young regions of suppressed recombination in the
N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes. The rate of homogenization of individual sites of each gene by gene conversion can be estimated using the equation r=K/(2T),
commonly used for estimating the accumulation of substitutions between pairs of taxa over time [29], where K
is the number of gene conversion events divided by
number of lineages, and T is the time since divergence
of N. tetrasperma lineages from a common ancestor.
Assuming a divergence time of N. tetrasperma lineages
from a common ancestor of 4.6 MYA [6], the rate of

Page 8 of 11

homogenization for each individual site by gene conversion for the genes cys-5, arg-1, lys-4 and ad-9 is 0.012
per million years and for ser-3 0.048 per million years,
which is one order of magnitude higher than the rate of
substitutions for coding sequences (0.0037 per site and
million years [30]). Accordingly, we postulate that frequent gene conversions could arise as a mechanism to
counteract the effects of deleterious mutations that
are predicted to arise in the young recombinationally
suppressed region of the mat chromosomes.
In addition to N. tetrasperma, the role of gene conversions and/or recombination in the evolutionary history
of mating-type chromosomes has been reported for
other fungal systems. For example, it has been found
that the evolution of the mating-type locus of Cryptococcus neoformans likely started by the acquisition of sexdetermining genes into the mating-type region [31], a
process followed by gene conversion and/or recombination giving rise to a region of suppressed recombination
harboring genes of common function, e.g. pheromone
production and sensing, surrounding the mating-type
locus [31-33]. The pheromone genes of C. neoformans
have been found to be arranged in a palindromic fashion, and have been subjected to gene conversion events
similar to the genes involved in spermatogenesis on the
human Y chromosome [10]. These findings further collaborate our conclusion that gene conversions are a
common phenomenon associated with recombination
suppression in the fungal mating-type loci and matingtype chromosomes.
Several mechanisms could be responsible for the onset
of gene conversions in the N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes. Specifically, given that the mat chromosomes in
N. tetrasperma are located in separate haploid nuclei
during vegetative growth, we can infer that the observed
gene conversions must have taken place either during
sexual reproduction (meiosis) or through the process of
parasexuality, i.e. a process of recombination of hereditary determinants outside of the sexual cycle first
reported from the fungal kingdom by Pontecorvo [34].
Since the gene conversions were detected in the recombinationally suppressed region of the mat chromosomes
of N. tetrasperma, it is plausible that the same genetic
mechanism as for ectopic gene conversion could be
important, as this particular process does not necessarily
require the formation of the synaptonemal complex
accompanied by reciprocal exchange [35,36].
Noteworthy issues

It should be noted that an altered gene order in the
different lineages of N. tetrasperma, due to gene translocation or multiple inversions, could result in deviations
in divergence for specific genes. Gene order has previously been found to be highly conserved between

Menkis et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:234
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/234

N. tetrasperma and N. crassa [22] justifying our general
assumption on conserved gene order between the taxa.
Furthermore, in a previous study we specifically confirmed the gene order for the region comprising leu-4,
cys-5 and ser-3 in strain P581 (phylogenetic lineage 6)
[6], and recently acquired large scale genomic data confirms gene order for cys-5, ser-3 and tef-1 in strain
RLM131 (phylogenetic lineage 4, unpublished data).
These confirmations of a conserved gene order between
N. tetrasperma and N. crassa make it possible to rule out
translocation to a recombining chromosomal region as
the cause of the homoallelism for specific genes such as
cys-5 in L6A and L6a and ser-3 in L4A and L4a; and thus
further supports the conclusion that gene conversion
events are responsible for the observed homoallelism in
these two cases. In the future, high coverage genomic
and population data will be needed in order to better
understand the full extent to which gene conversions
contribute to the evolutionary history of N. tetrasperma.

Conclusions
Our present analyses have revealed several fundamental
factors associated with the evolution of N. tetrasperma
mat chromosomes. In particular, our data shows that
the mat chromosomes from the various N. tetrasperma
lineages evolve independently, with certain lineages having different demarcation points between the recombining and the recombinationally suppressed regions as
compared to other lineages. This finding is remarkable
given that these lineages are very closely related and are
not perfectly reproductively isolated [5]. In addition, the
present data has also shown that the mat chromosomes
contain a young region of recombination suppression,
flanked by normally recombining regions, in each of the
nine lineages of N. tetrasperma. These features are consistent with those reported for ancient sex chromosomes
from animals [11,12,37-39]. Furthermore, the data
demonstrates that recombination suppression is not perfectly maintained in the N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes; this is based on the fact that gene genealogies
show that gene conversions and occasional crossovers
have arisen in the recombinationally suppressed region
within this taxonomic group. We conclude that gene
conversions could be a common phenomenon, which
counteracts the deleterious effects of mutations during
early stages of recombination suppression in N. tetrasperma mat chromosomes. Overall, the present data
demonstrate the high utility of this fungal model system
in revealing traits associated with early stages of recombination suppression. Furthermore, the findings
described herein provide a framework for further analysis of how the mat chromosomes evolve within and
among N. tetrasperma lineages, which will be key for
the usage of this taxonomic group as a model system

for the study of early stages of recombination suppression in sex chromosomes.

Methods
N. tetrasperma is a self-fertile taxon. Specifically, sexual
spores and vegetative cells in this taxon contain haploid
nuclei of both mating types (mat A and mat a), resulting
in heterokaryotic individuals capable of completing the
life-cycle on their own; a mating-system called pseudohomothallism [3,4]. Pseudohomothallism is believed to have
evolved in N. tetrasperma less than 6 MYA and is not
present in other, closely related, Neurospora species
which are self-incompatible (heterothallic) and require
mating between haploid individuals of opposite mating
types, mat A and mat a [3,4,6,40-42]. Nonetheless, it has
been found that heterokaryotic N. tetrasperma strains
(containing both mat A and mat a nuclei) can be separated into two homokaryotic (i.e. haploid), single matingtype component strains [3,43], which allows the study of
the divergence among gene alleles located on the mat A
and mat a chromosomes in a single strain [6-8].
Fungal strains

Ten pairs of homokaryotic, single mating-type component, strains of Neurospora tetrasperma were used in
this study. All except one pair (FGSC3998 and
FGSC4245: phylogenetic lineage 3) originates from single wild-type heterokaryons. The material represents the
nine phylogenetically and biologically recognized species
of N. tetrasperma, which are referred to as N. tetrasperma phylogenetic lineages 1-9 until the formal
nomenclature is settled [5]. From each lineage of N. tetrasperma, one pair of single mating-type component
strains were included, except for lineage 8 from which
we included two pairs of strains. The strains were
obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center
(FGSC), University of Missouri. Strain names, origin and
lineage affinity are given in Table 1, and additional
information about the strains can be found in [5].
DNA manipulations

DNA from the 20 single mating-type component strains
was extracted for a previous study [5]. For the present
study, partial or complete sequences of 24 genes (on
average 1460 bp coding sequences/gene) located on the
mat chromosomes, were PCR amplified and sequenced
from all 20 strains. Description of the loci, specific primers for their amplification, PCR conditions, procedures
for DNA sequencing and software used for sequence
analyses can be found in [6].
Evolutionary genetic analyses

Synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide divergence
rates of homologous alleles (dS and dN, respectively) were

Menkis et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:234

estimated for the alleles of the mat chromosomes of heterokaryotic strains, by using DNAsp version 4.10.9 [44].

Phylogenetic analyses

Sequences were aligned for each gene using the Clustal
W algorithm of BioEdit version 7.0.5.2 [45]. Gene trees
were derived by maximum likelihood (ML) analyses
using heuristic searches and the tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping algorithm in PAUP 4.0b10
[46]. Statistical support for phylogenetic grouping was
assessed by bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probability
analyses. For bootstrap analyses in PAUP 4.0b10, we
used 1000 replicate datasets with the random addition
of sequences during each heuristic search, and a threshold for significance of bootstrap branch support values
of ≥70%, which have been shown likely to correspond to
confidence levels of 95% [47]. Bayesian posterior probabilities were calculated for the clades of the trees using
MrBayes 3.1.2. [48], as described previously [5]. The
threshold for significant Bayesian branch support was
set to 0.95 [49].
