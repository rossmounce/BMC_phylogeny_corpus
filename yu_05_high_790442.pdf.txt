Abstract
Background: Interferon-alpha monotherapy is effective in less than one-third patients with
chronic hepatitis C. The dose-effect, tolerability and durability of interferon-alpha treatment and
its long-term effect on the prevention of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in naïve Taiwanese
patients with chronic hepatitis C have not been well investigated. We conducted the present
cohort study treated with high and standard interferon-alpha to illustrate the issues.
Methods: We performed a long-term virologic and histological follow-up of 214 chronic hepatitis
C patients treated with interferon-alpha, 3 million units (3-MU, n = 80) or 6-MU (n = 134) thrice
weekly for 24 weeks, in Taiwan between 1992 and 2001.
Results: There was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation between 3-MU and 6-MU
groups (4/80, 5.0% versus 10/134. 7.5%). The 6-MU group had similar incidence of adverse events
with the 3-MU group, except that 6-MU group had significantly higher incidence of psychological
manifestations, mainly presented as irritability. The rates of sustained virological response (SVR)
were significantly higher in 6-MU regimen (37.1%) than in 3-MU regimen (23.7%, p < 0.05) in per
protocol analysis. Based on multivariate analysis, baseline viral load was strongly associated with
SVR, followed by hepatitis C virus genotype, interferon-alpha regimen, and liver fibrosis. A
histological improvement in necroinflammatory activity, but not in fibrosis was observed in the
follow-up biopsy performed 0.5–5.5 years (mean: 1.9 years, n = 51) after end-of-treatment. Among
patients without SVR, there was more activity improvement in 6-MU group. The durability of SVR
was 100% (18/18) and 97.8% (45/46) for 3-MU and 6-MU group, respectively, in a mean follow-up
period of 6.81 years (5.25–9.18 years). For 163 baseline non-cirrhotic patients, 9 of 84 (10.7%) nonresponders and 3 of 79 (3.8%) sustained responders progressed to cirrhosis during a mean followup period of 5.52 and 5.74 years, respectively (p = 0.067, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank
test). For all 200 patients, hepatocellular carcinoma was detected in 12 of 113 (10.6%) non-

responders and one of 87 (1.1%) sustained responders during a mean follow-up period of 5.67 and
5.73 years, respectively (p < 0.01, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test).
Conclusion: We confirm the dose effect of interferon-alpha in chronic hepatitis C. Six-MU
regimen had better efficacy than 3-MU regimen in virologic and histological responses. Both
regimens had good tolerability and durability in Taiwan. Sustained response could reduce the
incidence of cirrhotic change and hepatocarcinogenesis.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiologic agent in
parenterally transmitted non-A non-B hepatitis and frequently causes persistent infection leading to chronic liver
disease and primary hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC)[1,2]. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) was the first
approved therapy in the 1980s but resulted in a sustained
virological response in only 8–20% of chronic hepatitis C
patients treated with a standard regimen of IFN-α monotherapy, 3 million units (MU) thrice weekly for 24 weeks
[3-8]. A number of factors have been considered in terms
of their potential to predict the response to IFN-α therapy.
These include infection with non-genotype 1b, lower levels of viremia and the absence of cirrhosis, which have
been currently reported to be associated with a better
response[2,9,10]. Several studies in Japan and Western
countries have shown that higher dose (5–10 MU) of IFN
could improve the efficacy on chronic hepatitis C[5,9,11].
Reviewing the Medline, however, only one limited study
on the efficacy of IFN therapy for naïve patients of chronic
hepatitis C has been reported before 1997 in Taiwan[4].
Furthermore, the dose effect, tolerability and durability of
high-dose IFN therapy for naïve Taiwanese chronic hepatitis C patients have never been reported.
Since 1992, we have treated a number of Taiwanese
patients with chronic hepatitis C with a standard IFN regimen, 3 MU thrice weekly for 24 weeks, and since 1995,
with 6 MU thrice weekly for 24 weeks. We have followed
these patients closely for 5–10 years, and we report herein
the end-of-treatment and sustained response, and results
of long-term follow-up to both regimens, as well as the
dose effect, tolerability and durability of high-dose IFN
therapy.

Methods
Patients
Two hundred and fourteen naïve chronic hepatitis C
patients were enrolled in the study. All were positive for
HCV antibodies (second-generation, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, Abbott, North Chicago, IL) and
serum HCV RNA for at least 6 months. Patients with a
concurrent hepatitis B virus, alcohol abuse (м80 mL ethanol per day), overt hepatic failure, a current or past history of psychiatric condition, pregnancy, or with evidence
of hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Two patholo-

gists assessed all biopsy results, which were taken before
IFN treatment, without knowledge of patients' clinical or
laboratory data. Disease activity grade and fibrosis stage
were quantitatively scored according to the histological
activity index described by Knodell et al[12] Cirrhosis was
diagnosed histologically in the presence of a stage 4 of
fibrosis or in the absence of a liver biopsy, by a compatible
ultrasonographic and clinical picture. A follow-up liver
biopsy was performed in 51 patients. The present study
was approved by the ethics committee of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital. After they had given their
informed consent, all patients were treated with recombinant IFN-α 2a (n = 40), IFN-α 2b (n = 102) or lymphoblastoid IFN-α n1 (n = 72), given intramuscularly, in a dose
of 3-or 6-MU thrice weekly for 24 weeks. Group allocation
was chronological and consecutive rather than randomized, because, before 1994, all patients were given a 3MU and then a 6-MU IFN-α regimen. Fourteen patients (4
in 3-MU group, 5.0% and 10 in 6-MU group, 7.5%), who
received IFN-α therapy less than 12 weeks, were excluded
from the present study (Table 1). The presence of HCV
RNA in the serum was assessed every three months for 12
months, and then every 12 months. End-of-treatment
virological responder (ETVR) was defined as patients
showing clearance of HCV RNA at the end of treatment.
Others were defined as non-ETVR. Sustained virological
responder (SVR) was defined as patients showing clearance of HCV RNA by at the end-of-treatment and 6
months after end-of-treatment. The others were classified
as non-SVR. Histological improvement and worsening
was defined as a м2-point decrease and increase in the
total necroinflammatory scores between paired biopsies,
respectively.
Detection/quantification of serum HCV RNA and
genotyping
Detection of serum HCV RNA was performed using a
standardized automated qualitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR, COBAS AMPLICOR Hepatitis C Virus Test, version 2.0; Roche, Branchburg, NJ, USA). The detection limit was 50 IU/mL. HCV
genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b and 3a were determined by
amplification of the core region using genotype-specific
primers described by Okamoto et al[13]. Serum HCV RNA
levels were measured by using the branched DNA assay
(Quantiplex HCV RNA 2.0, Bayer, Emeryville, CA),

performed strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions. The quantification range was 0.2 to 120 million equivalents (Meq) of HCV RNA per ml.
Statistical analyses
Frequency was compared between groups using the chisquare test with Yate's correction or Fisher's exact test.
Group means were compared using the Student t-test.
Serum HCV RNA levels were expressed as the mean ±
standard deviation after logarithmic transformation of
original values. Stepwise logistic regression was used to
analyze factors associated with IFN-α response. Comparisons of paired liver histology were carried out with twosample Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Preventive effects of
antiviral therapy on progression of chronic HCV infection
to liver cirrhosis (LC) and HCC were analyzed by using
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results
Adverse effect
There was no difference of incidence of discontinuation of
treatment between 3-MU and 6-MU groups (Table 1). The

incidence of adverse events was similar between two
groups in the presentation of flu-like symptoms, gastrointestinal and dermatological manifestations, and alopecia.
However, patients in 6-MU group had significantly higher
rate of psychological manifestation than those in 3-MU
group did (74/134, 55.2% versus 34/80, 41.0%, p =
0.028, Table 1).
SVR and factors predicting SVR
Seventy-six patients received 3-MU IFN-α and 124
received 6-MU, thrice weekly for 24 weeks. All were followed-up for at least 6 months after end of treatment.
Baseline clinical and laboratory data were not different in
the two groups (Table 2). At the end of IFN-α therapy, 36
patients (47.4%) in 3-MU group and 103 (83.1%) had
ETVR, the difference being highly significant (P < 0.0001).
Of those with ETVR, 50% (18/36) in 3-MU group and
55.3% (57/103) in 6-MU group had reappearance of
serum HCV RNA within 6 months after end-of-treatment.
The difference was not significant. The SVR was significantly higher in 6-MU group (37.1%, 46/124) than in 3MU group (23.7%, 18/76, P < 0.05).

In univariate analysis, SVR was not related gender, age,
history of transfusion, the necroinflammatory activity of
liver histopathology, or preparations of IFN-α (Table 3). A
significant positive association for SVR was found for pretreatment alanine aminotransferase value and IFN-α dose,
and a negative association with severe fibrosis (score 3 or
4), infected with HCV genotype 1b and pretreatment
serum levels of HCV RNA. Based on multivariate logistic
regression analysis, pretreatment HCV RNA level was
strongly associated with SVR, followed by infected HCV
genotype, IFN-α regimen, and severity of liver fibrosis
(table 4).
Dose effect on SVR according to virological risk factors
Since HCV genotype and baseline viral loads were important predictors for SVR to IFN-α, we divided 200 patients
into three virological unfavorable risk groups according to
the infected HCV genotype and pretreatment HCV RNA
levels[14]: low-risk group, absence of both virological risk

factors (genotype 1b and pretreatment HCV RNA levels >
0.65 Meq/mL); medium-risk group, presence of only one
virological risk factor; and high-risk group, presence of
both two virological risk factors. The 6-MU group had significantly higher ETVR than the 3-MU group in all of the
three risk groups (p < 0.01, <0.001, and <0.01 for low-,
medium-, and high-risk group, respectively, Table 5). The
relapsed rate did not differ between 3-MU and 6-MU
groups whatever the risk groups. In medium-risk group,
patients treated with 6-MU had significantly higher SVR
than those with 3-MU (29.5% vs. 7.7%, p < 0.05). However, SVR did not differ between 3-MU and 6-MU groups
both in low- and high-risk groups.
Paired histological examination
A follow-up liver biopsy was performed 0.5–5.5 years
(mean ± SD, 1.9 ± 1.4 years) after end of treatment in 51
patients. A histological improvement with a significant
decrease in the mean scores for all necroinflammatory

observed in the follow-up biopsy (Table 6). The
necroinflammatory activity improved in 68.2%, remained
stable in 27.3%, and worsened in 4.6% for patients
achieved a SVR, in contrast to 37.9%, 34.5%, and 27.6%,

Cumulative incidence of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients treated with interferon-alpha
Cumulative incidence of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among patients treated with interferon-alpha.
Left side, cumulative incidence of LC among 163 baseline non-cirrhotic patients with sustained virological response (SVR, solid

Long-term follow-up for viral status and the development
of LC and HCC
During the follow-up period, reappearance of serum HCV
RNA was found in one patient, who has achieved SVR in
6-MU group, at the 57th month. The durability of SVR was
100% and 97.8% for 3-MU and 6MU group, respectively,
in a mean follow-up period of 6.81 years (5.25–9.18
years). The SVR remained similar among three IFN preparations at the end of the 10 years.

Of 136 non-responders in the present study, 50 received a
second course of IFN-based treatment. Three of 11
(27.3%) with IFN-α monotherapy and 20 of 39 (51.3%)
with IFN-α/ribavirin combination therapy achieved a second SVR. Clinical evaluation, liver biochemistry, α-fetoprotein, and abdominal sonography were performed
every 3–6 months for patients without baseline cirrhosis,
and every 2–3 months for those with baseline cirrhosis
during the follow-up period.

For 163 baseline non-cirrhotic patients, 9 of 84 (10.7%)
non-responders and 3 of 79 (3.8%) sustained responders
progressed to cirrhosis during a mean follow-up period of
5.52 and 5.74 years, respectively. The difference was borderline significant by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
(p = 0.067, figure 2, left side). For all 200 patients, HCC
was detected in 12 of 113 (10.6%) non-responders and
one of 87 (1.1%) sustained responders during a mean
follow-up period of 5.67 and 5.73 years, respectively. The
difference was significant by using Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis (p < 0.01, figure 2, right side).

Discussion
In the present study, we have investigated the dose effect
of IFN-α therapy on a group of Taiwanese patients with
chronic hepatitis C in a 10-year follow-up. Our results
demonstrated that 6 MU IFN-α, thrice weekly for 24
weeks, had better efficacy (2.3-fold) than 3 MU, thrice
weekly for 24 weeks, in both virological and histological
responses. Improved efficacy was mainly seen in sub-

groups of patients with one of the two unfavorable
virologic factors, the medium-risk group, in the current
study. The 6-MU regimen was as tolerable as standard 3MU regimen for Taiwanese patients. Both regimens had
good durability of SVR.
Treatment with IFN-α was the first approved therapy but
a SVR could be achieved in only 8–20% of chronic hepatitis C patients treated with a standard regimen of IFN-α
monotherapy (3 MU thrice weekly for 24 weeks) [3-8].
Therefore, how to improve the efficacy of IFN-α therapy is
the concern of many studies. Until recently, 48 weeks of
IFN-α, 3 MU thrice weekly was recommended for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C[5]. Concerning the suffering from long-term IFN therapy, we conducted higher
dose of IFN regimen, 6 MU thrice weekly for 24 weeks,
which total dosage was equal to that of 3 MU, thrice
weekly for 48 weeks. In the present study, 6-MU regimen
was observed to achieve significantly higher rates of ETVR
and SVR than 3-MU regimen, but had no benefit on
reducing the relapse rate. In contrast to the duration effect
on improvement of SVR by reducing the relapse rate after
end-of-treatment, our results implicated the dose effect on
the initial response of HCV to IFN therapy[5,7,8]. High
dose regimen as well as induction therapy could result in
early clearance of HCV viremia, which is very important in
the prediction of IFN response[10,15,16].
In the present study, the incidence of discontinuation and
most of the major adverse events were similar between
standard dose and higher dose of IFN therapy, despite that
the higher dose of IFN regimen had significantly higher
incidence of psychological manifestations. However, the
psychological manifestations, mainly presented as irritability, could be controlled well with minor tranquillizers.
Consistent with previous reports[2,3,9,10,14], we confirmed the associations of pretreatment serum HCV RNA
levels, HCV genotype 1b and presence of cirrhosis with
response to IFN-α treatment in chronic hepatitis C
patients by using stepwise logistic regression model.
According to previous studies for Taiwanese patients, we
divided our patients into three virological risk groups
based on the presence/absence of HCV genotype 1b and
the baseline viral loads greater than the cut-off point, 0.65
Meq/mL, or not[14]. As observed in the present study, 6MU regimen could achieve significantly higher rate of
ETVR but could not decrease the relapse rate in all of the
three risk groups. Although our logistic regression model
predicted a 2.3-times increase in probability for a SVR to
occur in the 6-MU regimen versus the 3-MU regimen, the
significantly better efficacy of 6-MU regimen on SVR was
only observed in patients with one virological risk factor.
Therefore, how to enhance the ETVR for the medium- and
high-risk groups and to reduce the relapse rates for all of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/5/27

the three risk groups will be the key to improve SVR.
Extended therapy and/or combination with ribavirin
might be considered to overcome the unfavorable virological risk factors[16,17]. Since the unfavorable virological
risk factors are unchangeable, tailored regimens of IFN
with or without ribavirin combination therapy according
to the virological status are the only way to improve the
efficiency of HCV eradication, as recommended in recent
consensus on management of chronic hepatitis C[18,19].
In accordance with previous studies [20-22], a significant
decrease in necroinflammatory activity of liver histology
was observed in the current study. However, our material
was unable to show whether the IFN treatment resulted in
cessation of fibrogenesis, regardless of IFN regimen and
virological response (data not shown). Indeed, no firm
conclusion can be drawn about whether the fibrosis
remaining at long-term follow-up was irreversible and
established or whether it will diminish with even longer
follow-up[22]. Further analysis of histological response,
stratified by IFN regimen and SVR, we found that 6-MU
regimen could achieve histological improvement not only
in SVR but also in non-SVR. By contrast, most of non-SVR
treated with 3-MU regimen had histological worsening.
These results presumed the prominent benefit of high
dose IFN on the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
Similar to other reports[23,24], the long-term prognosis
was excellent in this well-defined material of SVR. Serum
HCV RNA was persistently undetectable in 63 of 64
patients with SVR. The only one patient, who had
reappearance of serum HCV RNA concomitant with
abnormal ALT level at the 57th month of follow-up, is a
resident of an HCV hyperendemic area, Tzukuan[25].
Whether this is reinfection[26] or recurrence[23,24] of
HCV remains to be clarified by phylogenetic analysis of
viral genome. Also our results confirm that IFN therapy,
when associated with response, reduces the incidence of
LC and HCC among chronic hepatitis C patients[27].
A greater efficacy in treatment of chronic hepatitis C was
observed in combination with IFN-α and ribavirin[24],
which has been available in Taiwan since August 1998
and becomes to be the recommendations for chronic hepatitis C patients[18,19]. More recently, combination of
pegylated IFN-α plus ribavirin shows more effective and
convenient and may replace the current standard of IFNα plus ribavirin[28,29]. The results of current study could
provide decision-making information for future therapeutic strategies of individualizing dose and duration of
standard or pegylated IFN-α treatment in combination
with ribavirin according to the baseline virological predictors to improve the efficiency of HCV eradication. However, pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin combination therapy
is expensive and might carry potential side effects. The

present higher dose regimen of IFN monotherapy might
be suggested for patients who are contraindicated to ribavirin and/or pegylated IFN-α therapy[30].

Conclusion
We confirm the dose effect of IFN in chronic hepatitis C.
Six-MU regimen had better efficacy than standard 3-MU
regimen in both of virological and histological responses,
and was as tolerable as 3-MU regimen. Nearly all sustained virological responders had a durable response and
the sustained response had a preventive effect on the
development of HCV-associated LC and HCC. Since the
unfavorable predictors, high pretreatment HCV RNA levels, infected with genotype 1b, and presence of cirrhosis,
are unchangeable, adjustment of IFN dose and duration
according to the unfavorable factors is important to
achieve a better efficacy/risk ratio. Our results could provide decision-making information for future therapeutic
strategies of individualizing dose and duration of standard or pegylated IFN-α treatment in combination with ribavirin according to baseline predictors.
