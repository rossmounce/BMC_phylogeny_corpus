Abstract
Background: Crustaceans represent an attractive model to study biomineralization and cuticle
matrix formation, as these events are precisely timed to occur at certain stages of the moult cycle.
Moulting, the process by which crustaceans shed their exoskeleton, involves the partial breakdown
of the old exoskeleton and the synthesis of a new cuticle. This cuticle is subdivided into layers,
some of which become calcified while others remain uncalcified. The cuticle matrix consists of
many different proteins that confer the physical properties, such as pliability, of the exoskeleton.
Results: We have used a custom cDNA microarray chip, developed for the blue swimmer crab
Portunus pelagicus, to generate expression profiles of genes involved in exoskeletal formation across
the moult cycle. A total of 21 distinct moult-cycle related differentially expressed transcripts
representing crustacean cuticular proteins were isolated. Of these, 13 contained copies of the
cuticle_1 domain previously isolated from calcified regions of the crustacean exoskeleton, four
transcripts contained a chitin_bind_4 domain (RR consensus sequence) associated with both the
calcified and un-calcified cuticle of crustaceans, and four transcripts contained an unannotated
domain (PfamB_109992) previously isolated from C. pagurus. Additionally, cryptocyanin, a
hemolymph protein involved in cuticle synthesis and structural integrity, also displays differential
expression related to the moult cycle. Moult stage-specific expression analysis of these transcripts
revealed that differential gene expression occurs both among transcripts containing the same
domain and among transcripts containing different domains.
Conclusion: The large variety of genes associated with cuticle formation, and their differential
expression across the crustacean moult cycle, point to the complexity of the processes associated
with cuticle formation and hardening. This study provides a molecular entry path into the
investigation of the gene networks associated with cuticle formation.

Background
Arthropods, such as arachnids, crustaceans and insects,
represent the most abundant phylum in the animal kingdom. They are common throughout marine, freshwater,

terrestrial, and aerial environments. The success of arthropods can partly be attributed to the protection offered by
their characteristic tough exoskeleton. With the advantage
of this protective armour, however, comes the problem of

growth restriction; arthropods overcome this through
periodic moulting, or shedding of the exoskeleton.
The crustacean moult cycle is divided into four discrete
stages; pre-moult, ecdysis, post-moult, and intermoult [1],
based on the morphology of the exoskeleton. During premoult the underlying epidermis separates from the old
cuticle (apolysis), the old cuticle is partially digested and
reabsorbed, and new epi- and exo-cuticle are secreted. The
old exoskeleton is shed during ecdysis. After ecdysis, during the post-moult stage, expansion of the partially
formed new exoskeleton occurs followed by the tanning
and mineralisation of the pre-ecdysial layers, and the deposition and hardening of the endocuticle. At the intermoult stage a mature, fully developed exoskeleton is
formed [2].
The crustacean intermoult integument consists of four layers. The thin outermost layer, the epicuticle, is characterised by an absence of chitin and is principally composed
of proteins, lipids and calcium salts. Beneath it lies the
exocuticle, composed of chitin as well as proteins and calcium salts. The epi- and exo-cuticle are both secreted prior
to ecdysis. The post-ecdysial endocuticle is divided into
two layers, the principle layer consisting of proteins, chitin and calcium salts, and the membranous layer that
remains un-calcified [3-5]. Table 1 summarises the features of arthropod integumental layers.
The exoskeleton of crustaceans and insects is formed by
cells of the hypodermis, an epithelial layer located
beneath the cuticle, during both the pre- and post-moult
stages [5,6]. At the beginning of pre-moult, the hypodermis secretes a moulting fluid containing enzymes for
digestion of the inner layers of the old cuticle. Secretion of
a crustacean's new exoskeleton by the hypodermal cells
begins during pre-moult, before the old exoskeleton is
shed [2,7]. Formation of the new exoskeleton occurs in
layers. The thin epicuticle is formed first, secreted into the
extracellular space between the epidermis and old exoskeleton, and a thicker exocuticle layer then appears beneath
the new epicuticle during late pre-moult. At pre-moult the

developing integument has invaginations over the entire
surface of the animal. This increases the surface area of the
new exoskeleton within the restricted space of the old
exoskeleton. Ecdysis enables the expansion of the new
exoskeleton [8]. Immediately after ecdysis, while the new
exoskeleton is still soft, unfolding and expanding to a
larger size than the old exoskeleton, the crab continues
secreting the endocuticle layer beneath the new exocuticle.
Mineralisation of the new exoskeleton is initiated after
moulting [9]. The endocuticle layer continues to increase
in thickness, while calcification and sclerotization of the
new exoskeleton progresses.
The hypodermis synthesizes almost all of the proteins in
the cuticle, however, hemocytes and several hemolymph
proteins also contribute to the synthesis of the new
exoskeleton [10]. Crustacean cryptocyanin, a member of
the hemocyanin gene family, has been implicated in the
transport of hormones, phenols, and some cuticular proteins to the hypodermis. Cryptocyanin itself may also be
used directly as a structural component of the new
exoskeleton [11-14].
The organic matrix of the crustacean cuticle is a complex
structure composed mainly of α-chitin microfibrils
embedded in a protein matrix [8]. The protein matrices
contain a large number of proteins with different properties. These proteins can be grouped according to the type
of domain that they possess. One domain type, the
chitin_bind_4 domain (Pfam nomenclature), containing
the Rebers-Riddiford (RR) consensus sequence, has chitin
binding properties [15]. While another, the cuticle_1
domain (Pfam nomenclature), is thought to be associated
with calcification as it has been found in proteins
isolated from the calcified regions of the crustacean
cuticle [16,17].
Many genes that are involved in the formation of the new
exoskeleton have been isolated both from insects and
crustaceans. However, despite extensive research, the
molecular events associated with cuticle formation in
crustaceans still remain poorly understood. To investigate

and gain a better understanding of this phenomenon, we
set out to identify genes associated with cuticle formation,
and to study their expression patterns throughout the
moult cycle of the blue swimmer crab Portunus pelagicus.
We used microarray technology, which provides a powerful, holistic approach to study gene expression in relation
to changing physiological states.

Results
Microarray expression analysis
Custom P. pelagicus cDNA arrays were created using transcripts isolated from both whole crabs, and the brain, eyestalk, mandibular organ (MO) and Y-organ of crabs in the
following five moult cycle stages: post-moult, intermoult,
early pre-moult, late pre-moult, and ecdysis. Dual channel
cDNA microarray hybridisation experiments, using RNA
isolated from P. pelagicus crabs in the above mentioned
stages, were used to identify differentially expressed genes
across consecutive stages of the moult cycle. Figure 1
shows a depiction of the hybridisation experiments comparing each moult cycle stage. Many transcripts were identified within the scope of the microarray experiments
described, however only those associated directly with
cuticle formation will be discussed here.
Nomenclature of differentially expressed cuticle protein
transcripts
Cluster and subsequent BLAST analysis revealed 21
unique, differentially expressed transcripts encoding
arthropod cuticle proteins. These were screened in Pfam,
and were each found to contain one of four different
domain types: cuticle_1, chitin_bind_4, Pfam B 109992,
and CBM 14. A total of 13 unique cDNAs, each displaying
differential expression profiles relating to moult stage,

contain the cuticle_1 domain. Four distinct differentially
expressed cDNAs contain the chitin_bind_4 domain
(a variant of the RR consensus sequence). Additionally,
four different cDNAs contain a domain associated with
cuticle protein CPCP1876 of the rock crab Cancer pagurus
(protein accession number P81584), tentatively termed
the Pfam B 109992 domain. Furthermore one transcript
containing the CBM 14 domain also known as the Peritrophin-A domain (found in chitin binding proteins [18])
was also differentially expressed. The common factor linking these transcripts lies in the domain type they contain,
however, they do not appear to be encoded by the same
gene nor code for the same protein. Three transcripts of an
additional type of cuticular protein that displayed
sequence homology to a LDLa domain containing chitin
binding protein from Drosophila (NP_730442), termed
vermiform, also displayed moult cycle-related differential
expression. Apart from the cuticle proteins, cryptocyanin,
a hemolymph protein known to be involved in cuticle formation, also displayed differential expression across the
moult stages. These transcripts have been named according to the type of protein domain identified in the
sequence, and numbered consecutively (Table 2).
The temporal differential expression patterns for genes
relating specifically to cuticle formation are summarised
in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (where multiple values for the same
transcript indicate expression levels for different cDNA
probes on the microarray that make up a contig), listed
according to moult stage. The heat map in Table 8 summarises the differential expression profiles of transcripts
related to cuticle formation isolated in this study.
Post-moult (Cy3) vs intermoult (Cy5)
The transcripts related to cuticle formation that were upregulated in the post-moult stage when compared against
the intermoult stage, are documented in Table 3. Two
transcripts containing the cuticle_1 domain, PpCUT12
and PpCUT13, were up-regulated in the post-moult stage.
Each consisted of several cDNAs grouped together to form
a contig. They were up-regulated by an average of 8.6- and
7.6-fold respectively. Four unique transcripts possessing
the PfamB_109992 domain (PpBD1-4) were also up-regulated in the post-moult stage, they displayed a combined
average up-regulation of 6.4-fold, and represent all of the
PfamB_109992 domain-containing transcripts isolated in
this study. Two of these transcripts were also up-regulated
in intermoult when compared to pre-moult. No differential expression of transcripts containing the chitin_bind_4
domain was observed in the comparison between the
post-moult and intermoult stages of the moult cycle.

The transcripts that display temporal down-regulation in
the post-moult stage, when compared with intermoult,
are listed in Table 4. Four different transcripts containing
the cuticle_1 binding domain (PpCUT7-10) were downregulated in the post-moult stage; they display a
combined average of 6.2-fold down-regulation. These
transcripts were also up-regulated in intermoult when
compared to early pre-moult. Furthermore, PpCUT9 was
also down-regulated in late pre-moult when compared to
ecdysis. Two cryptocyanin transcripts (PpCRYP1 and 2)
were highly down-regulated in the post-moult stage when
compared to intermoult. Both transcripts consist of
several cDNAs grouped together to form contigs, the
combined average down-regulation for cryptocyanin was
9.6-fold.
Intermoult (Cy3) vs early pre-moult (Cy5)
The up-regulated transcripts involved in cuticle formation
that were observed for the intermoult stage when compared against early pre-moult, are listed in Table 5. Briefly,
11 unique cDNAs, all containing the cuticle_1 domain
(PpCUT1-11), were up-regulated (by a combined average
of 9.6-fold) in intermoult. This constitutes the highest
number of cuticle_1 domain transcripts up-regulated in
any of the moult stages. Four cDNAs containing the
chitin_bind_4 (PpCB1-4) domain, were up-regulated at a
combined average of 12-fold in intermoult. This is also
the highest number of chitin_bind_4 domain transcripts
up-regulated in any moult stage. Additionally, two transcripts containing the PfamB_109992 domain (PpBD1
and 2), were up-regulated in the intermoult stage, the
combined average up-regulation for these was 12-fold.

No temporal down-regulation of transcripts involved in
cuticle formation was observed in intermoult when compared to the early pre-moult stage.

Late pre-moult (Cy3) vs ecdysis (Cy5)
Two distinct cryptocyanin transcripts, each containing
several cDNAs that aligned to form a contig, were up-regulated in late pre-moult when compared to ecdysis. The
average up-regulation of both cryptocyanin transcripts in
the late pre-moult stage was 9.2-fold. Table 6 displays the
level of up-regulation for each transcript.

Six cuticle_1 domain-containing transcripts (PpCUT1, 4,
5, 9, 11 and 12) were down-regulated in late pre-moult
when compared to ecdysis (combined average of sevenfold). Five of these cuticle_1 transcripts were up-regulated
in the intermoult stage of the moult cycle when compared
to early pre-moult. Two transcripts containing the
chitin_bind_4 domain, PpCB1 and PpCB3, were also
down-regulated in late pre-moult with a combined average down-regulation of 8.2-fold. Both of these
chitin_bind_4 transcripts were up-regulated in intermoult
when compared to early pre-moult. All of the transcripts
that display temporal down-regulation in late pre-moult
when compared to ecdysis are listed in Table 7.
Ecdysis (Cy3) vs post-moult (Cy5)
Microarray analysis found no statistically significant differential gene expression between ecdysis and the postmoult stage of the moult cycle.
Additional transcripts related to cuticle formation
Additional transcripts that displayed homology to other
previously isolated cuticle proteins, also containing the
above mentioned domains, were identified in this study.
These transcripts, however, failed the stringent statistical
analysis and cannot be defined as differentially expressed.
The details and accession numbers for these transcripts are
documented in Table 9.

Discussion
Early pre-moult (Cy3) vs late pre-moult (Cy5)
Microarray analysis indicates that no statistically significant differential gene expression can be observed between
the early pre-moult and late pre-moult stages.

Moulting is an important biological process in arthropods
as it is essential for growth, metamorphosis and reproduction. The formation of the new exoskeleton is integral to
the moulting process. Although many proteins involved
in cuticle synthesis and structural integrity have been previously isolated, little is known about the expression profiles of genes related to cuticle formation across the entire
moult cycle. The objective of the current study was to use
a P. pelagicus cDNA microarray developed in our laboratory to identify genes (both previously identified and
new) that are involved in the formation of the crustacean
exoskeleton. The microarrays were produced from 5000
cDNAs expressed in both the entire animal and in specific
organs such as the brain, eyestalk, MO and Y-organ from
all moult cycle stages. Thus the arrays were designed to
study global gene expression profiles of genes relevant to
the moulting process, across all moult stages. Microarray
technology offers the potential to examine the expression

patterns of many genes simultaneously, thus gaining a
better understanding of gene function, interaction, and
regulation.
Crustacean cuticles are composed of chitin rods embedded in a protein matrix [4], the physical properties of
which depend, among other things, on the sequence of
the constituent proteins and the extent of mineralisation
[19]. Many of the proteins associated specifically with the
cuticular matrix of crustaceans can be divided into groups,
based on the type of domain that they contain. One group
contains a cuticle_1 domain (Pfam); proteins with this
domain have previously been isolated from the hard, calcified cuticle of crustaceans [16,17]. The restricted occurrence of this domain in calcified crustacean cuticle led to
the suggestion that it could be involved in the calcification
process, either as a nucleation factor for crystal formation
or in regulating the growth and size of the calcium carbonate crystals once they have been formed [16]. We have isolated and profiled the differential expression of 13 unique
transcripts containing such a domain across the moult
cycle of P. pelagicus. Another group contains the RR consensus sequence (chitin_bind_4 in Pfam), demonstrated
to be involved in chitin binding [15]. Proteins with
chitin_bind_4 domains have previously been isolated
from both calcified and un-calcified crustacean cuticle
[16,20], and also from the cuticles of insects [21,22]. In
the present study, four transcripts with the chitin_bind_4
domain were found to be differentially expressed across
the P. pelagicus moult cycle. We have also isolated four
unique, differentially expressed transcripts containing a
domain that as yet remains unannotated, but has previously been isolated from the cuticle of C. pagurus [16],
tentatively termed PfamB_109992 (Pfam). It is likely that
the different domain types found in cuticle proteins are
functionally relevant to the cuticles in which they occur.

The expression of cryptocyanin was also found to be
moult-cycle related. Unlike the other cuticle proteins,
cryptocyanin is a hemolymph protein secreted by the
hepatopancreas that has also been implicated in the
formation of post-ecdysial cuticle [14].
Proteins with the cuticle_1 domain have previously been
isolated from the calcified cuticle of two decapod crustaceans; eight from the crab Cancer pagurus [16] and 10 from
the lobster Homarus americanus [17]. All of the proteins
previously isolated contain either 1 or 2 copies of
cuticle_1 domains. In our study, transcripts with up to
four cuticle_1 domains (see Figure 2) were isolated. Six
transcripts containing the cuticle_1 domain isolated in
this study have a deduced signal peptide, and four of these
also contain a deduced transmembrane region, suggesting
that they are secreted across the membrane (Figure 2). The
lack of a signal peptide in the other transcripts may be due
to an incomplete cDNA sequence, therefore the presence
of a signal peptide in all cuticle_1 domain-containing
transcripts cannot be ruled out. Each cuticle_1 domain
consists of two repeated 15 amino acid motifs with a
spacer sequence typically 9 to 12 amino acids in length.
The alignment in Figure 3 has been created from the
cuticle_1 domain-containing proteins, isolated from C.
pagurus and H. americanus, and from 13 unique differentially expressed cuticle_1 domain-containing transcripts
(conceptually translated) isolated in this study. Figure 3
depicts the location of the cuticle_1 domain (denoted by
shading). While the cuticle_1 domain is common to all
the sequences, many regions outside of this domain do
not share homology. Figure 4 is a phylogram of the proteins described above for Figure 3. A phylogram is a
branching diagram (tree) assumed to be an estimate of a
phylogeny, branch lengths are proportional to the
amount of inferred evolutionary change [23]. Figure 4

apparent functional grouping viewed in the phylogram,
points to a functional variation of the proteins despite
their shared domain.
Of the 13 P. pelagicus transcripts containing the cuticle_1
domain, described above, two transcripts, PpCUT12 and
PpCUT13, were up-regulated (eightfold) in the postmoult stage when compared to intermoult. The 11
remaining transcripts, PpCUT1-11, displayed a combined
average up-regulation of 9.6-fold in the intermoult stage
when compared to crabs in pre-moult. Four of these transcripts, PpCUT7-10, were also down-regulated in postmoult when compared to intermoult by an average of 6.2fold. Additionally, six transcripts (PpCUT1, 4, 5, 9, 11 and
12) were down-regulated in pre-moult when compared to
crabs at ecdysis. No differentially expressed transcripts
were detected between the early and late pre-moult stages
or between ecdysis and post-moult. For a graphical representation of these data see Table 8 and Figure 5. From

these data we can deduce that the up-regulation of many
transcripts containing the cuticle_1 domain begins at ecdysis; expression then differentiates into two groups, those
transcripts up-regulated in post-moult compared to intermoult and those down-regulated in post-moult compared
to intermoult (Figure 5a and Table 8). This converse
expression profile of transcripts with the cuticle_1 domain
further suggests that a functional and perhaps regulatory
difference exists, even between transcripts containing the
same domain. The proteins represented by these cuticle_1
domain-containing transcripts may have different mechanisms or modes of action that facilitate their respective
roles in exoskeleton formation. High levels of expression
of all cuticle_1 domain transcripts (except PpCUT12 and
13) in the intermoult stage compared to early pre-moult
(Figure 5b) indicate that formation and/or repair of the
exoskeleton continue well into intermoult while expression of these transcripts then decreases dramatically during pre-moult. Multiple proteins containing the cuticle_1

domain have previously been identified in crabs. However, until now, the expression patterns of their corresponding genes across the moult cycle have not been
traced. Although the functional role of these proteins, or
specifically the cuticle_1 domain, has not been postulated, the domain is thought to be associated with calcification as it has only been identified in proteins isolated
from the calcified cuticle of crustaceans [16]. The high
level of expression of PpCUT12 and PpCUT13 in postmoult (Figure 5a), and the up-regulation of the other transcripts containing cuticle_1 domains in the intermoult
stage (Figure 5b), further support the proposal that
proteins with this domain confer moult cycle related
changes to the calcified cuticle of crustaceans.
Many proteins containing the chitin_bind_4 domain have
been isolated from the cuticle of both insects and crustaceans. In addition to their role in chitin binding [15], several crustacean proteins containing this domain also
appear to participate in the calcification of the exoskeleton. Calcification associated peptide (CAP) 1 and 2, isolated from the crayfish Procambarus clarkii, are
multifunctional peptides with anti-calcification, calcium
binding and chitin-binding properties [24-26]. Crustocalcin from the prawn Penaeus japonicus on the other hand,

promotes calcification in addition to having calcium
binding properties [27,28]. Despite the commonality of
the chitin_bind_4 domain in these proteins, the promotory role of crustocalcin in the calcification process contrasts with the inhibitory properties described for CAP 1
and 2. To investigate the levels of homology between proteins containing the chitin_bind_4 domain, a phylogram
(Figure 6) was constructed from the seven (conceptually
translated) transcripts isolated in this study (four of these
were differentially expressed), CAP 1 and 2, crustocalcin,
and two cuticle proteins isolated from the crab Callinectes
sapidus, all containing the chitin_bind_4 domain. The
sequences of the chitin_bind_4 domain-containing proteins appear not to group according to species. Variable
regions to either side of the conserved chitin_bind_4
domain are apparent in Figure 7 (the chitin_bind_4
domain is shaded). This points to functional specificity of
the sequence outside the domain that is likely to influence
the role of the chitin_bind_4 domain in the calcification
process. Three of the four differentially expressed transcripts containing chitin_bind_4 domains isolated in this
study contained a deduced signal peptide, and two of
these also contained a deduced transmembrane region
(Figure 8), indicating that they are secreted across the
membrane.

These transcripts were not found to be differentially expressed under the stringent analysis conditions applied to the microarray data.

Moult cycle related differential gene expression was
observed in four unique transcripts containing the
chitin_bind_4 domain, PpCB1-4, in this study. These
transcripts were highly up-regulated (12-fold) in the intermoult stage when compared against early pre-moult
(Figure 5b). We found that only two of these transcripts
(PpCB1 and PpCB3) were up-regulated in ecdysis when
compared to pre-moult (Figure 5c). The lack of differential expression of transcripts containing the chitin_bind_4
domain between the post-moult and intermoult stages
indicates that both stages display similar expression levels
of these genes. The up-regulation of chitin_bind_4 transcripts in the intermoult stage compared to pre-moult suggests that these genes are also expressed in post-moult,
and that expression is significantly reduced in pre-moult.
The high level of expression in intermoult is perhaps
unexpected, certainly in terms of exoskeleton formation,
which is traditionally associated with the pre- and postmoult stages. However, this expression pattern reflects the

expression of other chitin_bind_4 domain-containing
genes, CsAMP8.1 and CsAMP6.0 of C. sapidus, whereby
their expression in arthrodial membranes continued for
32 days post-moult before disappearing [20], apparently
due to the late deposition of the un-calcified membranous
layer within 16 to 32 days post-moult. The down-regulation of chitin_bind_4 transcripts in the pre-moult stage of
the moult cycle when compared with ecdysis, strongly
suggest that at least some members of the chitin_bind_4
domain family of proteins are not involved in the synthesis of pre-ecdysial cuticle in crustaceans but rather, are
"switched on" at the time of moulting in preparation for
the generation of the post-ecdysial, or the hardening of
the pre- and post-ecdysial layers. This is consistent with
findings for other chitin_bind_4 domain-containing
proteins such as CAP 1 and 2, and crustocalcin, which
show that expression of their genes occurs in the epidermal tissue only during the post-moult stage [24-28].

Phylogram of amino acid sequences containing one or more cuticle_1 domain

Four transcripts containing the domain PfamB_109992,
which as yet remains unannotated, were found to display
moult cycle related differential expression profiles in P.
pelagicus. The PfamB_109992 domain was previously
found in a protein isolated from the calcified cuticle of C.
pagurus (CPCP1876, accession number P81584) [16], and
also in the calcified cuticle protein of C. sapidus (CP15.0,
ABB91679). An alignment of their amino acid sequences
(Figure 9), and the phylogram in Figure 10, indicates that
they do not group according to species, suggesting that
they represent distinct genes, perhaps clustering according
to function. The sequence homology may result from
conserved functionality. PpBD1 and 2 both contain a
deduced signal peptide, while only PpBD1 contains a
deduced transmembrane region (Figure 11), suggesting
possible secretion of these proteins across the membrane.
PpBD1-4 were up-regulated (combined average of 6.4fold) in the post-moult stage when compared against
intermoult (Figure 5a), suggesting that they are relevant to
cuticle formation or to changes in the physical properties
of the exoskeleton observed after ecdysis. Two of these

transcripts, PpBD1 and 2, were also highly up-regulated
(by a factor of 12-fold) in the intermoult stage when compared against crabs in the pre-moult period (Figure 5b),
signifying their continued expression well into intermoult
followed by a decrease in expression during pre-moult.
The difference in expression between transcripts containing the PfamB_109992 domain in the intermoult stage
when compared to pre-moult is suggestive of a divergence
in functionality or regulatory mechanisms. To date, little
work has been carried out on proteins containing this
domain. However, moult cycle related differential expression evident from the present study, and the previously
implied specificity of this domain to the calcified cuticle
of crustaceans, signal the importance of proteins carrying
this domain to exoskeletal formation.
PpCBM, a transcript sharing sequence homology with a
peritrophic membrane chitin binding protein from the
cabbage lopper Trichoplusia ni (AAR06266), was found to
be 6.2-fold up-regulated exclusively in the post-moult
stage when compared to intermoult. This transcript

and assists in their movement through the digestive tract
is also referred to as the peritrophic membrane [29].
Within crustaceans, sequences with the CBM 14 domain
have to date only been found in penaeid prawns. The specific up-regulation of the peritrophic membrane chitin
binding protein transcript in post-moult, demonstrates its
increase in expression during a period associated with
cuticle synthesis and hardening. A chitinous portion of

the stomach of crabs, and other higher crustaceans, is shed
along with the exoskeleton at ecdysis [29], which necessitates the synthesis of a new chitinous matrix in the stomach post-ecdysis. Proteins such as those containing the
CBM 14 domain, which has been demonstrated to bind
chitin [30], may be involved in the formation and/or
structural integrity of the digestive tract.

Moult cycle related differential expression profiles were
also observed for three transcripts, PpVER1, PpVER2 and
PpVER3, which displayed sequence homology to a LDLa
domain containing chitin binding protein from Drosophila (Accession number NP_730442), termed vermiform. PpVER1 was up-regulated in both the post-moult
stage compared to intermoult, and during intermoult
when compared to early pre-moult. Whereas PpVER2 was
down-regulated in late pre-moult when compared to ecdysis, while PpVER3 was up-regulated in only in the postmoult stage when compared to intermoult. The specific
up-regulation of each of these transcripts during various
stages of the moult cycle, points to a functional/regulatory
difference between these genes, and implicates their
involvement in distinct aspects of cuticle formation. Vermiform, a gene involved in chitin modification, was found
to affect the structural properties of the chitinous matrix
of the trachean cuticle of Drosophila [31]. The authors
demonstrated that this gene is not required for chitin syn-

thesis, secretion, or accumulation but rather for its normal
morphology and structure. Vermiform codes for a protein
with a LDL-receptor ligand binding motif and chitin
binding and deacetylation domains. Chitin deacetylase
modulates the physical and chemical properties of chitin
by deacetylation, which converts chitin into chitosan [32],
and may influence the structure and orientation of chitin
fibrils in the arthropod cuticle. Luschnig et al [31] demonstrated that vermiform is expressed in epidermal cells of
Drosophila, and that mutations in this gene affect body
shape, presumably by altering the structure and rigidity of
the epidermal cuticle. Further cuticular abnormalities
such as reduced procuticle deposition and aberrant apical
membranes were also observed in Drosophila vermiform
mutants [33]. Proteins with chitin binding properties are
important in the structural modifications occurring in the
post-ecdysial cuticle. This is the first report of vermiform
like proteins in crustaceans, and their expression patterns

indicate that they have a role in the structural modifications occurring in the post-ecdysial cuticle
In contrast to the cuticle proteins discussed above, cryptocyanin was highly up-regulated in the late pre-moult
period (9.2-fold) when compared to crabs in ecdysis, but
was down-regulated in post-moult (9.6-fold) when compared to intermoult. This indicates that levels of cryptocyanin transcript decrease at the time of ecdysis and
continue to remain low throughout the post-moult
period. Cryptocyanin expression then increases in inter-

moult and remains stable during the pre-moult period.
These results concur with those of another study in
C. magister, in which mRNA levels of cryptocyanin were
low immediately post-moult and gradually increased to a
peak two thirds into the moult cycle then decreased prior
to moulting [14]. The authors demonstrated that similar
patterns were exhibited by cryptocyanin protein levels in
the hemolymph, where levels remained low in intermoult, increased in pre-moult and dropped dramatically
in post-moult [14]. Immunohistochemical and mRNA
expression studies in C. magister, demonstrated that

cryptocyanin is synthesised in the hepatopancreas,
secreted into the hemolymph, transferred across the epidermis and incorporated into the extracellular matrix of
the new exoskeleton [14]. The converse expression profiles of cryptocyanin and cuticle protein transcripts across
the P. pelagicus moult cycle observed in this study suggest
that they are involved in chronologically different stages
of cuticle formation. However this temporal delay is likely
due to the different sites of synthesis of each protein, as
both protein types play a role in post-ecdysial cuticle formation. The time required between cryptocyanin synthesis and secretion from the hepatopancreas, transportation
through the hemolymph and final incorporation into the
cuticle, may be responsible for the earlier expression of

cryptocyanin mRNA compared with that observed for the
other cuticle proteins in this study.
Our study describes the temporal expression patterns of
cuticle protein transcripts containing the cuticle_1,
chitin_bind_4, PfamB_109992, and CBM14 domains, as
well as the hemolymph protein cryptocyanin, across the
moult cycle of P. pelagicus. Most of the differentially
expressed cuticle protein transcripts identified in this
study were up-regulated in the intermoult period when
compared to the pre-moult. This suggests that synthesis
and/or repair of the cuticle occurs well into the intermoult
stage of the moult cycle, and that these transcripts are
down-regulated in the pre-moult stage and hence not

Page 21 of 26

BMC Biology 2007, 5:45

involved in the synthesis of the pre-ecdysial layers of the
exoskeleton. Instead these genes may be involved in the
synthesis of the post-ecdysial cuticle, or in the exoskeletal
hardening process associated with post-moult. None of
the cuticle transcripts identified in this study were up-regulated in the pre-moult period, reinforcing the supposition that they are not involved in pre-ecdysial cuticle
formation. Only the hemolymph protein cryptocyanin,
displayed up-regulation in pre-moult, its involvement in
cuticle formation however, also occurs post ecdysis [14].

Conclusion
Temporal variation in individual transcript expression,
both within those transcripts that contain the same
domain and between transcripts containing different cuticle domains, was observed in the present study. Wynn and
Shafer [20] also demonstrated differential temporal and
spatial expression between four genes containing the
chitin_bind_4 domain in both calcified and un-calcified
cuticle, in C. sapidus. This fluctuation in expression levels
between cuticle proteins containing the same domain
type and the presence of various domains in cuticular proteins indicates that numerous genes are involved in the
formation of the crustacean exoskeleton, that they are not
up-regulated simultaneously, and that each may have a
distinct role in cuticle formation. The moult cycle-related
differential expression observed for transcripts containing
the same domain type indicates a difference in functionality and perhaps regulation of the corresponding proteins in the crustacean cuticle. We therefore propose that
the identification of cuticle proteins be based on the type
of domain contained within the protein, rather than the
type of cuticle (be it calcified or un-calcified) from which
the protein was isolated. As more information becomes
available about the role of these domains in the arthropod
exoskeleton, the features present within a cuticle protein
will become pivotal in describing its function.
Tracing the temporal expression patterns of genes
involved in cuticle formation assists in elucidating the
mechanisms of cuticle synthesis. Expression information
about such genes aids in their functional annotation, as
differential gene action underlies the regulation of differential protein accumulation in the cuticle [19]. The
expression data presented here provide a chronological
depiction of moult cycle related changes to the synthesis
of proteins involved in cuticle formation. We have identified a number of candidate genes, by virtue of domain
annotation and differential expression data, that could
play an important role in the formation and hardening of
the crustacean exoskeleton throughout the moult cycle.
The expression pattern of these genes, together with conceptual domain annotation, has enabled the discovery of
new genes likely to be important to cuticle formation that
contain similar motifs to those identified previously. It is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/45

evident that cuticle formation and hardening are complex
processes involving many components and requiring
strict regulatory mechanisms.

Methods
Animal selection
P. pelagicus crabs were supplied by staff at the Department
of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) Bribie Island
Aquaculture Research Centre (BIARC), Queensland,
Australia. The crabs were individually housed in a flowthrough system at an ambient water temperature of
24°C, and fed a commercial diet (Ebistar, Higashimaru,
Japan) twice daily. Two size groups of crabs were used,
small crabs of an average carapace width of 4 cm, and
larger crabs of an average carapace width of 11 cm. All
crabs were moult staged by examination of pleopod paddles for epidermal retraction and grouped into the following moult stages; moult (shedding of the
exoskeleton), post-moult (pliable exoskeleton), intermoult (hard exoskeleton with no evidence of epidermal
retraction) early and late stage pre-moult (based on the
extent of epidermal retraction) [34].
cDNA library construction
Two cDNA libraries were constructed using various source
tissues, selected in order to provide a diverse collection of
transcripts, and representing a broad range of tissue functions and physiological states in all moult stages. One of
the cDNA libraries was synthesised from whole animals in
order to obtain transcripts from each tissue type. For this
library, six small crabs, from each of the following five
moult stages; moult, post-moult, intermoult, early and
late pre-moult stages, were selected, snap frozen and
ground under liquid nitrogen. The other cDNA library,
was derived from organs previously identified as being
important to the moult cycle of crustaceans and served to
enrich the array with sequences particularly relevant to
crustacean moulting. The tissues represented in the P.
pelagicus organ library were brain, eyestalk, MO and Yorgan. These tissues were obtained from six anaesthetised
large P. pelagicus crabs from each of moult, post-moult,
intermoult, and early and late pre-moult stages, and
stored in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).

Total RNA was purified from each tissue sample using
TRIZOL reagent as recommended by the manufacturer
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Concentration and purity of the RNA were determined using a
spectrophotometer (GeneQuant Pro, GE Healthcare UK
Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England) with 230, 260 and 280
nm readings. RNA quality was assessed for all samples by
visualisation on a denaturing formaldehyde RNA gel (protocol recommended by Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and
ethidium bromide staining. Each cDNA library was

Page 22 of 26
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2007, 5:45

constructed by pooling equal amounts of total RNA from
all moult cycle stages.
A commercial cDNA library synthesis system (SMART
cDNA library construction kit, Clontech, Mountain View,
CA, USA) was used for the construction of each library
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Only the
final cloning step was modified so that instead of using
the λ TriplEx2 vector supplied with the kit, the size fractionated cDNA was ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions,
and transformed into XL10 Gold ultracompetent cells
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A total of 80 clones, randomly selected
from each library, were then sequenced and analysed
using a BLAST search [35] to determine gene redundancy.
The primer used for sequencing was the 5' SMARTlibPCR
primer (5' AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT 3') a modification of the SMART IV oligonucleotide supplied with
the SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech).
Screening for redundant clones
Upon examination of 160 clones, from the cDNA libraries
of both whole crab and crab organ, redundancies for 16S
ribosomal RNA were found to be as high as 30%. To
remove 16S ribosomal RNA carrying plasmids, all of the
clones were first screened for the 16S ribosomal RNA
sequence, using a colony hybridisation method [36].
Briefly, three probes, (500, 344 and 300 bp in length)
were designed from separate regions of the 16S Ribosomal RNA sequence. These probes were PCR amplified
and labelled with P32, then hybridised to clones that had
been fixed to nitrocellulose filters. Following an overnight
incubation at 55°C in hybridisation buffer (6 × SSC and
1% SDS), the filters were washed twice at 55°C in a solution of 6 × SSC and 0.2% SDS for 30 min, sealed within
plastic and exposed onto autoradiography films (GE
Healthcare UK Ltd.) at -70°C using intensifying screens.
The films were then developed according to supplier's
instructions.
Construction of custom P. pelagicus cDNA microarrays
A total of 5000 unsequenced clones that had been prescreened for 16S ribosomal RNA were randomly selected
for spotting onto the microarray slides. Of these, 2400
were selected from the whole crab library and 2600 from
the crab organ library. These were grown overnight in LB
containing 50μg/ml ampicillin. The clones were sent to
the AgGenomics microarray printing facility (Bundoora,
Victoria, Australia). The clones were PCR amplified using
kit supplied primers (Clontech) and contact-spotted (in
duplicate) using pins onto amino silane coated glass
slides in 50% DMSO buffer. Known crab genes, which
were identified at the initial sequencing stage, such as
actin (GenBank: EF110528) cryptocyanin (GenBank:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/45

EF102021), hemocyanin (GenBank: EF110534), metallothionein (GenBank: EF110529), opsin (GenBank:
EF110527) and ubiquitin (GenBank: EF110526) were
spotted onto the arrays for use as controls. Genes specifically associated with the moulting process such as moultinhibiting hormone (MIH) (GenBank: EF110524), crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) [GenBank:
EF110525] and farnesoic acid methyl transferase (FaMeT)
long isoform (GenBank: DQ085282) [37], were isolated
separately from P. pelagicus through the design of gene
specific primers and spotted on to the arrays. In addition
universal reference RNA standard controls (Lucidea, GE
Healthcare UK Ltd.) were also spotted onto each array, as
were negative control spots of 50% DMSO (without
cDNA). The cDNA was bound to the slide surface by baking and UV crosslinking.
Experimental design
In order to identify differential gene expression across
moult stages, two consecutive moult stages were compared on each array in a dual colour (Cy3 and Cy5) experiment. RNA samples were pooled across subjects in order
to reduce the effect of biological variation. A formula,
which dictates the total number of subjects and arrays
required for the pooled experiment to obtain gene expression estimates and confidence intervals comparable to
those obtained from a non-pooled experiment [38], gave
90% confidence if nine subjects were pooled across a total
of three arrays. To this effect, equal amounts of total RNA
from three crabs in one moult stage, were pooled, and
compared against equal amounts of total RNA pooled
from three crabs in another moult stage, on one array.
This was repeated three times in total, the different moult
stages were labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 respectively. Consecutive moult stages were compared in the following format; post-moult (Cy3) with intermoult (Cy5), intermoult
(Cy3) with early pre-moult (Cy5), early pre-moult (Cy3)
with late pre-moult (Cy5), late pre-moult (Cy3) with ecdysis (Cy5), and ecdysis (Cy3) with post-moult (Cy5). Figure 1 is a schematic diagram depicting each set of moult
stage comparisons.

Technical variation (that is, array-to-array variability) in
these microarray experiments was addressed through spot
duplication. Two identical grids consisting of each amplified cDNA and including the controls described above
were printed onto the left and right sides of each horizontally orientated array, thus affording spatial separation
between duplicate spots, to allow for the normalisation of
potential hybridisation anomalies.
Microarray hybridisations
RNA from nine small crabs (six of these were also used in
the above-described whole crab cDNA library construction), snap frozen and ground under liquid nitrogen, was

isolated using TRIZOL reagent as recommended by the
manufacturer (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The RNA
was DNase treated using RQ1 RNase free DNase
(Promega) as per manufacturer's instructions and purified
using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as recommended by the
manufacturer. RNA quality was assessed by visualisation
on a denaturing formaldehyde RNA gel (protocol recommended by Qiagen) using ethidium bromide staining.
Concentration and purity of the RNA were determined
using a spectrophotometer (GeneQuant Pro) at absorbencies of 230, 260 and 280 nm. A total of 1μg of Lucidea universal RNA control (GE Healthcare) was added to 10μg of
pooled total RNA for each moult stage sample, the RNA
was converted to cDNA then labelled and hybridised to
the array using the 3DNA Array 900 MPX expression array
detection kit (Genisphere Inc., Hatfield, PA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, RNA was
reverse transcribed using a random primer combined with
an oligo dT primer. The RNA was then degraded and the
cDNA tailed with dTTP followed by ligation to a dendrimer-specific capture oligo (specific for either Cy3 or
Cy5). Microarray slides were denatured prior to use by
immersion in 95°C MilliQ water for 5 min, the slides
were then transferred to 95% ethanol at room temperature for 2 min. Slides were spun dry to reduce streaking at
800 rpm for 2 min. The Cy3 and Cy5 "tagged" cDNAs
were combined and then hybridised to the array by overnight incubation in a humidity chamber at 65°C using
the kit supplied non-formamide SDS-based buffer and a
poly T based blocker, as per manufacturer's specifications.
The "tagged" cDNA was washed with a series of three SSCbased buffers, the first wash occurred at 65°C for 15 min,
the other wash steps were carried out at room temperature
for 10 min each. The slides were spun dry at 800 rpm for
2 min. Fluorescent 3DNA capture reagent (which carries a
sequence complementary to the Cy3 and Cy5 tag) was
then hybridised to the array using the SDS-based buffer
with added Anti-Fade reagent (inhibits photobleaching of
Cy5) at 65°C for 4 h. The fluorescent reagent was then
washed as described above for the cDNA hybridisation.
Data analysis
Microarray slides were scanned using a white-light ArrayWorx Biochip Reader (Applied Precision, LLC, Issaquah,
Washington, USA). ImaGene (BioDiscovery Inc., El Segundo, CA, USA) was then used to process images and create spot intensity reports, while CloneTracker
(Biodiscovery Inc.) was used to generate gene ID mapping
files and assign gene identification. Final intensity reports
were retrieved as raw spot intensities in tab-delimited
files. The data set is deposited in the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database [39] under accession no.
GSE6997.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/45

Microarray data analysis was performed by Emphron
Informatics (Chapel Hill, Queensland, Australia). Briefly,
data was normalised using the robust scatter plot
smoother LOESS (also known as "LOWESS" for locallyweighted regression and smoothing scatter plots) [40].
For each chip, normalisation was applied to the left and
right sides separately (spatial positioning of clones spotted in duplicate was in the format of two grids located on
the left and right side of each array when orientated horizontally). Individual microarray quality was assessed
using M vs A scatter plots. M-A plots were constructed for
each slide, where the log-intensity ration M = log(Cy3/
Cy5) [logCy3-logCy5] were plotted against the mean logintensity A = [(logCy3+logCy5)/2] as described by [41].
Potential dye intensity biases in the microarray data sets
were assessed by examining the back-to-back histograms
of Cy3 and Cy5 expression. As each gene is spotted onto
an array in duplicate, and three biological replicates are
performed per moult stage comparison, a standard error,
a t-statistic, and t-distribution (P value) can be calculated
for each gene represented on the array. Standard errors
were based on the mean of technical replicates for a given
slide. For each of the genes on the slide, a P value for differential expression was calculated using the empirical
Bayes procedure [42]. These P values were then adjusted
using the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure [43]. This
conservative procedure provides control of the familywise error rate (FWER), which is the probability of at least
one false positive. The advantage of controlling the FWER
is that any genes identified as differentially expressed are
highly likely to be so, however, the disadvantage is that it
is easier to omit genes that are differentially expressed.
Differential gene expression was only considered significant if the (FDR) adjusted P value was < 0.05. These genes
are listed in the results section where M is the log2 fold
change in expression and t is the t-statistic. Positive values
of M and t indicate up-regulation in the Cy3 sample
whereas negative values of M and t indicate down-regulation in the Cy3 sample.
Genes were considered up- or down-regulated when
the logarithm of the gene expression ratio (M) was > 1 or
< -1, that is there was a twofold (or greater) difference in
expression levels.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
Following hybridisation experiments, clones that displayed differential expression (P ≤ 0.05) patterns across
moult stages were sequenced. Overlapping cDNA
sequences (contigs), that likely represent the same transcript, and clones without sequence identity to other
cDNAs (singlets) were identified by comparing all
sequences against one another in sequencher (Gene
Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The genes were
annotated with the name of the highest basic local

alignment search tool (BLAST) [44] score from an analysis
of GenBank entries by the BLASTx and BLASTn procedures. Amino acid and nucleotide sequence alignments
were produced using the ClustalW program [45]. Phylogenetic trees (phylograms) were generated in ClustalW using
the Neighbour Joining method [23]. Protein domains
were identified from the Pfam database [46], signal peptides were detected using InterProScan [47].
