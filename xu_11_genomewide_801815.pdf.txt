Genome-wide evidence for positive selection and
recombination in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae
Zhuofei Xu, Huanchun Chen* and Rui Zhou*

Abstract
Background: Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is an economically important animal pathogen that causes
contagious pleuropneumonia in pigs. Currently, the molecular evolutionary trajectories for this pathogenic
bacterium remain to require a better elucidation under the help of comparative genomics data. For this reason, we
employed a comparative phylogenomic approach to obtain a comprehensive understanding of roles of natural
selective pressure and homologous recombination during adaptation of this pathogen to its swine host.
Results: In this study, 12 A. pleuropneumoniae genomes were used to carry out a phylogenomic analyses. We identified
1,587 orthologous core genes as an initial data set for the estimation of genetic recombination and positive selection.
Based on the analyses of four recombination tests, 23% of the core genome of A. pleuropneumoniae showed strong
signals for intragenic homologous recombination. Furthermore, the selection analyses indicated that 57 genes were
undergoing significant positive selection. Extensive function properties underlying these positively selected genes
demonstrated that genes coding for products relevant to bacterial surface structures and pathogenesis are prone to
natural selective pressure, presumably due to their potential roles in the avoidance of the porcine immune system.
Conclusions: Overall, substantial genetic evidence was shown to indicate that recombination and positive
selection indeed play a crucial role in the adaptive evolution of A. pleuropneumoniae. The genome-wide profile of
positively selected genes and/or amino acid residues will provide valuable targets for further research into the
mechanisms of immune evasion and host-pathogen interactions for this serious swine pathogen.

Background
In the evolutionary history of many microorganisms,
positive selection and homologous recombination are
two indispensable driving forces for adaptation to new
niches. Both of them contribute to the genetic variations
that might influence the population diversification and
adaptation of pathogenic microorganisms [1,2]. Recent
studies on the genome-wide evolutionary dynamics have
highlighted the important roles of selection and recombination in the molecular evolution of bacterial pathogens,
including Escherichia coli [1], Listeria monocytogenes [3],
Salmonella spp. [4], Streptococcus spp. [5], and Campylobacter spp. [6]. These analyses have revealed that a certain number of protein-coding genes subject to natural
selection pressure are usually involved in the dynamical
interactions between host and pathogen, especially in the

immune and defense-associated functions [1]. Diversifying selection operating on these genes may be caused by
pathogen-host co-evolutionary arms race [7,8].
In the present study, d N /d S -based methods were
applied to detect evidence of genome-wide positive Darwinian selection. Estimating the ratio (ω) of the rate of
nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions (dN) to that of
synonymous substitutions (dS) is a powerful approach for
measuring selective pressure on the protein-coding level:
ω = 1, < 1, > 1 indicate neutral evolution, purifying (negative) selection, and positive (adaptive) selection, respectively [9,10]. The codon models further developed by
Nielsen and Yang allow variation in ω among sites [11],
which have an extensive capability to find evidence for
adaptive evolution in most functional genes where only a
small fraction of amino acid sites are subject to strong
positive selective pressure [12]. Thus far this approach
has been widely used for genome-wide selection analyses
in pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes [9,13]. A
substantial number of genes encoding highly variable

antigens are identified to undergo adaptive selection particularly on some functional sites for evasion of host
immunity [1,4,14].
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, a Gram-negative
coccobacillus belonging to the Actinobacillus genus of
Pasteurellaceae family, is a strictly swine pathogen and
colonizes in the upper respiratory tract of porcine [15].
This pathogen has caused an economically severe disease
characterized by pulmonary lesions, pleuritis, and pericarditis in pigs [16]. According to the differences in capsular polysaccharides, A. pleuropneumoniae has been
divided into 15 serovars [17]. The recent comparative
genomics studies through both high-throughput
approaches of genome sequencing and microarray have
depicted the compositions of the pan-genome and confirmed the contribution of genes loss or gain to the diversity in virulence and serovar of A. pleuropneumoniae
[18,19]. However, besides large genetic variations resulting from DNA acquisition and genome reduction, small
sequence differences occurring in the conserved genes,
including point mutations, insertions/deletions (indels),
and intragenic recombination, may also play a crucial
part in the alteration of antibiotic resistance, pathogenicity and immunogenicity [20,21]. But to date, no research
pays enough attention to the linkages between genetic
alterations and putative functional roles in intraspecies
conserved genes of A. pleuropneumoniae at the whole
genome level.
In order to further trace evolutionary trajectories on the
core genome of pathogenic bacterium A. pleuropneumoniae, we employed a genome-wide analyses approach to
investigate the effects of natural selection and homologous
recombination operating on the coding genes. Our analyses focused on the evolutionary characterizations of core
genome genes that are shared by 12 A. pleuropneumoniae
genomes. Many genes were shown to be under strong
positive selective pressure and primarily associated with
the fitness and immunogenic properties of this swine
pathogen.

longer than 50 codons were used in this study. Subsequently, the orthologous protein sequences were aligned
using a progressive method implemented in T-Coffee
v8.93 [22].
Frameshift mutations (indels of a number of nucleotides
not divisible by three) can lead to high nonsynonymous
substitution rates, resulting in more false positive results
when positive selection was estimated based on dN /d S
ratios [5]. To avoid incorrect indels in the codon alignments, multiple sequence alignments were initially performed with amino acid sequences from each gene cluster,
followed by conversion to the corresponding codon alignments using custom Perl scripts. The coding sequences
located at the beginning or end of the contigs appeared to
be more prone to frameshift sequencing errors. Therefore,
we further assessed the quality for each alignment through
obtaining the following information: overall identity, and
identity in the first 30 nt and last 30 nt per alignment. The
codon alignment sequences that contain frameshift mutations were checked and edited manually in the software
MEGA4 [23] if identity is low.
Calculation of dN, dS, codon bias, nucleotide diversity and
informative sites

According to the method as defined by Nei and Gojobori
[24], the number of synonymous nucleotide substitutions
per synonymous site (dS) and the number of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions per nonsynonymous site
(d N ) were estimated for the resulting gene alignments
using the program SNAP [25]. Gene-by-gene number of
informative sites and genetic diversity were obtained
from the output of the PhiPack program [26]. The analyses for the codon usage variation was performed by
computing the effective number of codons (Nc), which is
a general measure of bias from equal codon usage in a
gene. The Nc value ranges from 20 for the strongest bias
(where only one codon is used for each amino acid) to 61
for no bias [27,28]. The calculation of Nc were implemented in the program CodonW 1.4 (http://codonw.
sourceforge.net/).

Methods
Genome dataset and alignment

Detection of recombination events

Twelve genome sequences of A. pleuropneumoniae were
retrieved from NCBI Genome database (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genome). The sequences included 3 complete genomes and 9 draft genome assemblies (see details
in Table 1). Orthologous gene content information and
annotation with COG functional classification have been
defined in our recent work and used here [19]. To
increase accuracy and power of selection analyses, an
ortholog set was excluded if it satisfied any of the following criteria: the length of any gene lower than 80% of the
maximum length, more than one gene from each genome
or less than four sequences. Protein-coding sequences

Since recombining fragments among aligned codon
sequences have a profound effect on the detection of
the positively selective evidence [29], we first tested for
recombination signals between sequences in the alignment of orthologous genes. Four statistical procedures
GENECONV [30], pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) [26],
maximum c2 [31] and neighbor similarity score (NSS)
[32] were applied to discover the homologous recombination signals. Besides GENECONV version 1.81, the
other three methods were implemented in the PhiPack
package [26]. For the analyses of GENECONV, the parameter g-scale was set to 1, which allows mismatches

within a recombining fragment. The p-values for inner
fragments using 10,000 random permutations were used
to indicate the significance of putative recombinant
regions. For maximum c2 , a fixed window-size of 2/3
the number of polymorphic sites was used. For PHI, the
window size was set to 100 nucleotides. Simulated
p-values were estimated based on 1,000 permutations
for PHI, maximum c2 and NSS.
Detection of Selection

Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were
reconstructed for each gene in the dataset of the core
genome genes using the PhyML program [33]. A general
time-reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution
with the ML estimates for gamma distributed rate heterogeneity of four categories (Г4 ) and a proportion of
invariable sites were used in all tree reconstruction
methods. The resulting topologies of ML trees were
applied to the subsequent selection analyses.
To detect selective pressure acting on each coding
gene, the rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were estimated site-by-site using the codeml
program from the PAML 4.2b package [34]. According
to the topology of the resulting ML tree per gene alignment, two site-specific models that allow variable nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) rate ratios (ω =
dN/dS) among codons were applied to analyze our data
set: M1a (NearlyNeutral) and M2a (PositiveSelection).
Null hypothesis model M1a was nested with alternative
selection model M2a. The latter model adds an extra
site class for a fraction of positively selected amino acid
sites with ω > 1; whereas models M1a only allows site
classes with ω varying between 0 and 1 [10,35]. A likelihood ratio test (LRT) was carried out to infer the occurrence of sites subject to positive selective pressure
through comparing M1a against M2a. Three replicates
were run with codeml and the maximum likelihood
values for each model were used in the LRT. The LRT

statistic (twice the log-likelihood difference between the
null and the alternative models) was compared with the
c2 distribution with two degrees of freedom. The Bayes
empirical Bayes approach was employed to identify positively selected sites under the likelihood framework [36].
Mapping of positively selected sites to structure models
of proteins

The web server PSORTb v3.0 was used to predict bacterial protein subcellular localization [37]. Integral betabarrel outer membrane proteins were predicted by
BOMP [38]. The three dimensional structure model of
the protein encoded by the gene that showed evidence
for positive Darwinian selection was modeled using the
Phyre server [39]. The sites subject to positive selective
pressure were mapped onto the structure and visualized
by PyMol (http://www.pymol.org/).
Statistical analyses

Multiple testing correction was performed to control for
Type I errors according to the approach presented by
Benjamini & Hochberg [40]. For all genes tested for
recombination and positive selection, q-values were calculated from p-values using the R package qvalue with
the proportion of true null hypothesis set to 1 (π0 = 1)
[41]. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 10% was used for
the recombination analyses. As the tests used for detecting positive selection was conservative [42], an FDR of
20% was set.
The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test was
employed to determine the significance level for the differences among the selected continuous variables (i.e.,
dN, dS, codon bias and nucleotide diversity) between a
given COG functional categories and all other categories. Binomial test was used to estimate association
between each COG category and evolutionary forces
(i.e. positive selection and/or homologous recombination); Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons

were performed according to the number of one-sided
tests. The significance level was set to 5% in this study.
All statistic analyses were carried out using Perl scripts
and R 2.11.1 [43].

Results
Properties of orthologous genes in 12 A.
pleuropneumoniae genomes

In our recent work [19], 2,531 orthologous genes and 772
strain-specific genes have been identified in the pan-genome of 12 A. pleuropneumoniae strains using BlastClust.
The above data set was used to further decode phylogenomic characterizations of pathogenic A. pleuropneumoniae. The evidence for homologous recombination and
natural selection pressure whether operate on the conserved coding genes was estimated at the present study.
After manually editing the aligned gene sequences and
removing the low quality ones, a data set of sequence
alignments of 1,960 orthologs was selected out, 81% (n =
1,587) of which were core genes that are present one copy
per genome and the remaining (n = 373) were distributed
genes present in at least four genomes.
The codon bias for each orthologous gene was measured by the effective number of codons (Nc value) calculated by CodonW [28]. The reduction in N c indicates
strong bias that significantly correlates with high gene
expressivity [44]. A. pleuropneumoniae genes in the COG
functional categories “Energy production and conversion”, “Translation”, “Amino acid transport and metabolism”, “Nucleotide transport and metabolism”, and
“Carbohydrate transport and metabolism” were evident
to have higher codon usage bias (P < 0.001, P < 0.001,
P = 0.003, P = 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively; onetailed U-test) compared with genes in other COG categories. As is well known, genes bearing stronger codon
bias are likely to be highly expressed and have housekeeping features [3,45]. So, high codon bias of genes present in the five COG categories is likely to elucidate the
necessity of relevant coding products for implementing
fundamental life cycle and essential physiological activities of A. pleuropneumoniae.
A. pleuropneumoniae genes in the functional categories “Replication, recombination and repair” and
“Amino acid transport and metabolism” represented a
tendency to have higher rates of synonymous (d S )
nucleotide substitutions (P = 0.006 and P < 0.001,
respectively; one-tailed U-test) in comparison with genes
in other role categories (Table 2). On the other hand,
genes in the functional categories “Replication, recombination and repair”, “Amino acid transport and metabolism”, “Coenzyme transport and metabolism” and
“General functional prediction” showed a tendency to
have higher rates of nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions
(P = 0.012, P = 0.001, P = 0.007, and P = 0.007,

respectively; one-tailed U-test) in comparison with genes
in other COG categories (Table 2). Positive correlation
was observed between dS and dN values for each COG
category of A. pleuropneumoniae genes, indicating that
natural selection might uniformly act on synonymous
and nonsynonymous sites per gene. In addition, it was
worth noting that the average d S and d N values were
significantly lower (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively; one-tailed U-test) for genes in the COGs “Translation” than for genes in other COG categories. It has
been suggested that genes involved in the translation
machinery, e.g. ribosomal proteins and tRNA synthetases, usually evolved slowly with low dS and dN, probably due to structural and functional constraints
required by the fundamental cell life cycle [20,46,47].
A substantial number of genes showing evidence for
recombination in the core genome of A.
pleuropneumoniae

Among the 1,587 orthologous core genes, 2% (29 genes)
had no occurrence of nucleotide substitutions and thus
were not further investigated for evidence of homologous recombination. Furthermore, among the remaining
genes, 197 gene alignments that contain few informative
sites less than two could not be analyzed with programs
in PhiPack and were removed from the ortholog sets.
Finally, 86% of total core genes were selected to conduct
the subsequent recombination analyses through four
approaches. The evolutionarily conserved core genes
(n = 226) were summarized (Additional file 1) and the
biological functions carried out by their coding products
may be essential for the survival of A. pleuropneumoniae. Notably, conserved genes were significantly
enriched in the COG category “Translation” with a low
Bonferroni corrected p-value (P < 0.001; Binomial test);
this result was consistent with low d S and d N values
mentioned before. These translation-associated proteincoding genes are generally involved in the fundamental
cellular activity and thus hardly have any changes at the
amino acid level as a result of functional constraints.
Overall, among 12 A. pleuropneumoniae genomes, 822
orthologous core genes (52% of all 1,587 core genome
genes) were identified to have significant evidence for
recombination (FDR < 10%) that was detected by at
least one of the four tests (Additional file 2). A total of
493, 675, 659 and 559 orthologs were identified to have
recombination signals using GENECONV, Maximum c2,
NSS and PHI, respectively. Additionally, a total of 149,
148, 160, and 365 orthologs exhibiting recombination
signals were identified by using one, two, three, and all
four recombination tests, respectively.
It is worth noting that 23% of all core genes, which were
selected as recombinants by all four methods for testing
recombination, have more informative sites (P < 0.001;

with recombining fragments was estimated (Figure 1).
Core genes that exhibit evidence for recombination were
significantly overrepresented in three COG categories
“Replication, recombination and repair”, “Amino acid
transport and metabolism”, and “Inorganic ion transport
and metabolism” (uncorrected P = 0.007, P < 0.001, and
P = 0.029, respectively; one-sided Binomial test). However,
after Bonferroni correction, only the association for the
COG “Amino acid transport and metabolism” was significant (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.004).
Evidence for 57 A. pleuropneumoniae core genes subject
to positive selection

The analyses of positive selection implemented in
PAML was carried out for 1,587 core genome genes of
A. pleuropneumoniae (in our initial experiment we
included all 1,960 orthologous genes). Based on the LRT
statistic for comparing the null model M1a and the
2
selection model M2a with the χ2 distribution and

corrections for multiple testing (FDR < 20%), a total of
57 genes were identified to be under strong positive
selected pressure (Table 3; Additional file 3). Genes in
the COG category “General function prediction only”
were significantly enriched (P = 0.004; one-sided Binomial test). Except for four positively selected genes in
the COG category “cell wall/membrane biogenesis”,
many genes with homologues in other COG categories
or without homologues in the COG collection were also
predicted to encode proteins localized on surface/membrane and simultaneously subject to positive selective
pressure, e.g. gntT, cysW, apaA, pcaK, aphA, pqiB and
ytfN.
Notably, there was no obvious discrepancy for the values
of d S between genes under positive selection and the
remaining genes; whereas the dN values together with the
number of informative sites and genetic diversity were significantly higher in the positively selected genes (P <
0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.023; one-sided U-test). No association between positive selection and COG categories was
observed, as the number of positively selected genes is low
in each role category.

used in this study. Asterisks mark certain COG categories that significantly enriched with recombining genes (P < 0.05, Binomial test). The COG
categories are coded as follows: J, translation; K, transcription; L, DNA replication, recombination and repair; D, cell division and chromosome
partitioning; V, defense mechanisms; T, signal transduction; M, cell wall/membrane biogenesis; U, intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular
transport; O, posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones; C, energy production and conversion; G, carbohydrate transport
and metabolism; E, amino acid transport and metabolism; F, nucleotide transport and metabolism; H, coenzyme metabolism; I, lipid metabolism;
P, inorganic ion transport and metabolism; Q, secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism; R, general functional prediction only;
S, function-unassigned conserved proteins; -, unknown proteins not in the COG collection.

Among 57 positively selected genes, 24 genes also
showed significant evidence for homologous recombination detected by all four recombination tests. Furthermore, 41 genes under positive selection pressure showed
evidence for recombination identified by at least one
test. It indicates that positive selection should be associated with intragenic recombination, as recombination
can lead to phylogenic incongruence and highly false
positives when selective pressure on protein coding
sequences was estimated [3,29].

Discussion
Gene acquisitions and losses that contribute to the virulence and serotypic diversification of A. pleuropneumoniae have been depicted in detail [18,19], but our
understanding on small genetic variations caused by positive selection and homologous recombination, which also
factually influence the evolutionary trajectories of protein
coding genes, has not been well considered for this swine
pathogen so far. In this report, we chose 12 genomes of
A. pleuropneumoniae to study the evolutionary driving

forces acting on the core genome of this animal pathogen
using a comparative phylogenomic approach.
Intragenic recombination and positive selection both play
a key role in the evolution of A. pleuropneumoniae pangenome

Tests for intragenic homologous recombination and positive selection were performed with 1,587 orthologous
genes present in the core genomes of twelve strains of A.
pleuropneumoniae. Overall, our results indicated that
about a quarter of the genes in A. pleuropneumoniae core
genome showed significant evidence for intragenic recombination. In comparison, core-genome recombination was
also evident in both species of the genus Streptococcus, as
18% and 37% of the core genome for S. agalactiae and S.
pyogenes, respectively, showed evidence for homologous
recombination [5]. Notably, in A. pleuropneumoniae, two
COG categories “Replication, recombination and repair”
and “Amino acid transport and metabolism”, which both
presented high values of dS and dN, were favored by intragenic recombination.

On the other hand, 57 A. pleuropneumoniae genes,
accounting for approximately 3.6% of the core genome,
were identified to be undergoing positive selection.
Another similar study on the identification of genes
under positive selection in E. coli reported that 0.7% of
3,505 genes found in six E. coli genomes showed evidence
for positive selection and no evidence for recombination
[1]. Like other pathogenic bacteria, a substantial number
of positively selected genes in A. pleuropneumoniae
encode protein products involved in the biogenesis and
structural components of bacterial cell wall and/or outer
membrane. These genes are likely to be associated with
co-evolutionary arms races between pathogenic microorganisms and hosts. To further decipher the roles of evolutionary pressure operating on the core genome of
A. pleuropneumoniae, we analyzed the functional properties of the positively selected genes and potentially
important residues subject to positive selection.
Genes subject to positive selection in A.
pleuropneumoniae

We found that many protein products encoded by the
positively selected genes were exposed on the cell surface
or involved in structural constituents of bacterial cell wall.
Some of these proteins have been reported to be important virulence factors associated with bacterial adherence,
colonization and persistence. Therefore, it suggests that
the genes under diversifying selection may dynamically
interact with the host immune and defense systems.
The beta barrel porins are pore proteins that allow the
passive diffusion of small, hydrophilic, or changed molecules across Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes
[48]. The pore proteins have been believed to be crucial
for not only dynamic interactions with the host immune
system, but bacterial pathogenesis as well [1,49]. An
outer membrane protein OmpP2, which was predicted to

be beta barrel porin, showed strong evidence for positive
selection with a low q-value (Table 3). The results of the
Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) analyses showed that
A. pleuropneumoniae OmpP2 amino acid residues 306,
317, and 320 were subject to intense positive selective
pressure (Figure 2). The three residues all located on a
predicted extracellular loop in the C-terminus, perhaps
associated with potential antigenic epitope. In addition,
OmpP2 has been experimentally confirmed to be essential for in vivo survival of A. pleuropneumoniae by signature-tagged mutagenesis and also an immunogenic
surface antigen by the immunoproteomic approach
[50,51]. In our initial selection analyses using a set of
1,960 genes, gene fepA present in 11 A. pleuropneumoniae genomes encodes a beta barrel porin (Figure 2) and
was also identified with evidence for positive selection
(data not shown). FepA of A. pleuropneumoniae shared a
common TonB-dependent receptor plug domain
(PF07715) with E. coli outer membrane protein FepA
that is a receptor for ferric enterobactin and for colicins
B and D [52]. FepA of A. pleuropneumoniae has already
been reported to exhibit immunogenic activity [53]. The
adaptive changes in both porins might be beneficial for
A. pleuropneumoniae to escape from the host immune
systems and attack of phages, antibiotics, and colicins.
Bacterial surface polysaccharides, which are often
involved in adherence and colonization, may be directly
exposed to the host immune pressure. Three A. pleuropneumoniae genes (hcsA, hcsB, and wecF) participated in
biogenesis of surface polysaccharides showed significant
evidence for positive selection. The products of selected
genes hcsA and hcsB code for capsule polysaccharide modification proteins that share 63% and 64% identity with
Haemophilus influenzae HcsA and HcsB, respectively,
which facilitate transport of capsular polysaccharide across
outer membrane and are essential for bacterial virulence

subject to strong positive selection (posterior probability > 95%).

[54]. Besides, the positively selected gene wecF codes for a
4-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase and is located at a wec locus
which has highly conserved colinearity in all A. pleuropneumoniae genomes. The products of wecF together with
other wec genes exhibit high similarity to the E. coli K12
homologues that are involved in the assembly of a cell surface glycolipid [55].
The other gene apaA encoding an antigenic membrane
lipoprotein that could provide cross-protection against
heterologous A. pleuropneumoniae serovars [56], was
also under strong positive selection (q-value = 0.062).
The above analyses strongly demonstrated that the positively selected genes involved in the biosynthesis and
structural composition of cell surface/wall have undergone adaptive functional changes, perhaps allowing bacterial pathogens to escape recognition by the host
immune system and phages. Such phenomena have
already been proposed by the previous studies of natural
selection on the E. coli genome [1,14].
The proteases of A. pleuropneumoniae have been
reviewed to be one of important virulence factors and
contribute to pathogenesis [57]. Overall, 4 protease
genes (i.e., ptrA, lonH, sppA and tldD) showed significant evidence for positive selection. The precise function
of these protease genes identified here, to our knowledge, was not well understood for this pathogen. However, proteolytic enzymes are pivotal to the secretion
processes of Gram-negative pathogens and several of
them have been described as attractive drug targets in
other pathogens, e.g. ClpP [58] and Lon [59].

Conclusion
Our findings indicated that intragenic homologous
recombination and positive Darwinian selection, unsurprisingly, indeed play crucial roles in the evolution of
pathogenic A. pleuropneumoniae. In genes with

extensive functional classification we found genes
involved in the formation of cell surface/membrane are
favored by the positive selective pressure. The adaptive
changes in these positively selected genes and/or residues likely attribute to dynamic interaction caused by
the host immune and defense systems. Of course, the
diversifying selective forces of genes encoding metabolic
functions may be also advantage for improving bacterial
fitness in response to a variety of environmental signals.
More experimental works are required for verifying the
functions of these adaptive genes in future. Overall, the
genetic evidence of positive selection will provide promising targets for further researches in the mechanisms
of immune evasion and the host-pathogen interaction in
A. pleuropneumoniae.
