Abstract
Background: The multilocus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) technique
has been developed for fine typing of many bacterial species. The genomic sequences of Neisseria
meningitidis strains Z2491, MC58 and FAM18 have been available for searching potential VNTR loci
by computer software. In this study, we developed and evaluated a MLVA method for molecular
subtyping and phylogenetic analysis of N. meningitidis strains.
Results: A total of 12 VNTR loci were identified for subtyping and phylogenetic analysis of 100 N.
meningitidis isolates, which had previously been characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. The number of alleles ranges from 3 to 40 for the 12 VNTR
loci; theoretically, the numbers of alleles can generate more than 5 × 1011 MLVA types. In total, 93
MLVA types were identified in the 100 isolates, indicating that MLVA is powerful in discriminating
N. meningitidis strains. In phylogenetic analysis with the minimal spanning tree method, clonal
relationships, established with MLVA types, agreed well with those built with ST types.
Conclusion: Our study indicates that the MLVA method has a higher degree of resolution than
PFGE in discriminating N. meningitidis isolates and may be a useful tool for phylogenetic studies of
strains evolving over different time scales.

Background
Neisseria meningitidis is one of the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis and septicemia in children and young adults
[1]. Periodically, it causes large epidemics in Africa, especially in
the sub-Saharan meningitis belt, and in Asia [1]; however, it is
still a serious problem in many industrialized countries [2,3].
Occasionally, a meningococcal pandemic occurs after large population movements, such as pilgrimages [4,5].
Epidemiological studies of N. meningitidis, using various
subtyping methods, allow the identification of a disease out-

break and investigation of the disseminating meningococcal
strains. With the advent of molecular biology, a number of
molecular methods have been developed for epidemiological studies of N. meningitidis. Among the methods, pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) are the most frequently used subtyping techniques [6,7]. PFGE usually exhibits high discrimination for
bacterial isolates, but it generates fingerprint image data that
makes a comparison between laboratories difficult. In contrast, MLST is based on sequence data from seven conserved
housekeeping genes; sequences that differ at even a single

nucleotide are assigned to different alleles. The combination
of alleles at the seven housekeeping genes is designated the
sequence type (ST) of the isolate; numerous STs can be
obtained. A Neisseria MLST database has been established
that allows STs to be compared electronically via the Internet. STs are grouped into clonal complexes by their similarity to a central allelic profile (genotype). These central
genotypes are identified by a number of heuristic means,
including BURST and split decomposition, along with feedback from public health laboratories and epidemiologists.
Once a central genotype has been identified, clonal complexes are defined as including any ST that matches the central genotype at four or more loci unless it more closely
matches another central genotype [8]. The accumulation of
nucleotide changes in housekeeping genes is a relatively
slow process, and the allelic profile of a meningococcal

strain is stable over time. Therefore, MLST is a powerful tool
for study of global epidemiology of meningococci [6]. However, MLST provides lower discrimination than PFGE for fine
typing of some clonal groups of N. meningitidis [9].
In recent years, the multilocus variable-number tandem
repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) technique has been developed for fine typing of many bacterial species [10-19]]. In
addition, Yazdankhah et al. [20] have recently developed
a MLVA method with four VNTR loci for genotyping of N.
meningitidis isolates and successfully differentiated the
serogroup W135 isolates from sporadic cases and outbreaks. In this study, we successfully developed a MLVA
method with 12 VNTR loci to analyze a panel of N. meningitidis isolates, which had previously been characterized
by PFGE and MLST.

Results
Identification of potential VNTR loci
Initially, 23 potential VNTR loci with short lengths of
repeat units (Ϲ 30 bp) were selected from a list of repeat
loci identified by the VNTRDB program at the three
genomes of N. meningitidis strains Z2491, MC58 and
FAM18. After evaluation with 10 genetically distinct N.
meningitidis strains, 12 VNTR loci were then chosen for
genotyping 100 N. meningitidis isolates. The remaining 11
VNTR loci were abandoned because multiple bands were
produced or no PCR products were detected in all the 10
isolates. Four of the 11 loci were opa genes, which existed
in multiple copies with various repeat numbers in Neisseria spp. [21]. Such loci were too complicated to be useful
for MLVA genotyping. Among the 12 loci, three (NMTR1,
NMTR9, NMTR12) have been characterized by
Yazdankhah et al. [20]. Both VNTR06 and VNTR08 loci,
described by Yazdankhah et al. [20], are actually the same
locus equivalent to the NMTR9 locus described in this
study. In the genomic sequence of N. meningitidis strain
MC58, the primers VNTR06-F and VNTR06-R are at positions 286076–286057 and 285626–285649, and
VNRT08-F and VNTR08-R at 285707–285726 and
286018–285999, respectively. Both primer sets amplify
the same VNTR locus. The lengths of repeat units for the
12 repeat loci ranged from 4 to 30 bp, 7 of the 12 loci were
multiples of 3 bp. NMTR12 is a compound tandem repeat
with 12- and 13-bp repeat units arranging in variable
numbers and sequences. This compound tandem repeat
was verified by sequencing all the amplicons from 100 N.
meningitidis isolates. Of the 12 loci, at least 9 were located
in coding region of annotated genes (Table 1). The
VNTRDB program used each of the three genomic
sequences in turn as a "parent" sequence to search repeat
loci and, then, located each of the loci at the other two
genomes, so that a locus, for example NMTR9a with only
one repeat unit in strains MC58 but with 2 repeat units in

strain Z2491 and 3 repeat units in strain FAM18, could be
found (Table 1).
MLVA genotyping
The MLVA genotyping was performed on 100 N. meningitidis isolates, which were collected between 1996 and
2002, and their PFGE patterns and ST types were characterized previously [9]. The results showed that the majority of the isolates carried only one copy of each of the 12
loci; however, five isolates carried extra copy of NMTR1,
NMTR7, NMTR9 or NMTR18 locus, two isolates did not
carry the NMTR1 locus, and three isolates did not carry the
NMTR12 locus (Table 2). The number of alleles at each of
the 12 loci ranged from 3 to 40 alleles counted on the 100
isolates analyzed (Table 3). Six loci (NMTR1, NMTR2,
NMTR7, NMTR9, NMTR10 and NMTR12) had more than
10 alleles and four loci (NMTR1, NMTR2, NMTR7 and
NMTR9) had a high allelic polymorphism index (≥ 0.9)
(Table 3). Based on the allele number for each of the 12
loci determined in this study, at least 5 × 1011 MLVA allelic
profiles (MLVA types) are expected.

A total of 93 MLVA types were identified for the 100 isolates (Table 2). The majority of MLVA types represented
only one isolate; however, each TW4, TW5, TW51, TW52,
and TW62 types represented two isolates and TW3 represented three isolates. TW62 was identified in two serogroup B isolates (NM255 and NM256), which were
obtained from two cases in a meningococcal disease outbreak in a family. TW52 was identified in two serogroup
C isolates (NM377 and NM378) with a close epidemiological relationship. TW3, TW4, and TW5 were identified
in serogroup Y isolates collected from sporadic cases; the
isolates were derived from a newly imported clone [9].
The two serogroup W135 isolates with TW51 type were
collected in cases at a 2-year interval.

As shown in the previous study [9], PFGE exhibited a
higher degree of discrimination than MLST for the isolates
analyzed. However, the results of this study showed that
MLVA exhibited much higher resolution than PFGE on
the same panel of isolates. MLVA discriminated all of the
serogroup B isolates and 29 of 31 serogroup W135 isolates, which were collected from sporadic cases (Table 2).
In contrast, only two ST type and four PFGE patterns were
identified in the 31 serogroup W135 isolates (Table 2).
Only one ST type and two PFGE patterns were identified
in the 11 serogroup Y isolates (Table 2). However, these
isolates were further discriminated into seven MLVA genotypes.
Phylogenetic analysis
The clonal relationships among the 100 isolates were constructed with the MLVA types by the minimal spanning
tree (MST) method. In the analysis with 12 loci, MLVA
types matching at eight or more loci were regarded as
clonally related. Consequently, eight distinct MLVA
groups were established and the grouping feature established with the MLVA types had good agreement with that
built with ST types (Figure 1). The two serogroup A isolates were characterized as different MLVA types (TW48
and TW59), differing in three loci, both carried ST-7 type
within the ST-5 complex (Table 2). Similar to the results
obtained from the previous MLST analysis, a complicated
clonal relationship was found among the 52 serogroup B
isolates. The majority of MLVA types were distributed in
three major MLVA groups, T2, T3 and T4, and 13 types
were regarded as single clonal lineages. T2 group comprised 10 MLVA types: isolates within this group and with
TW10 (differing in five loci with the closest TW16 in T2
group) carried ST types belonging to the ST-3439 group.
Similar to the T2 group, the T3 group comprised 11 MLVA
types and all the isolates in this group belonged to the ST3200 group. With the exception of TW39, isolates with the
MLVA types within T4 group belonged to the ST-41/44
complex. In the MST analysis with ST types, some isolates
were grouped in the ST-41/44 complex, but with MLVA
allelic profiles they (TW1, TW2, TW27, TW55 and TW63)

were separated from the T4 group. However, they had a
closer genetic relationship with the genotypes within the
T4 group.
All the MLVA types, except TW65 and TW88, representing
the serogroup W135 isolates, were clustered in T7 group.
The two MLVA types (TW25 and TW52), identified in
three serogroup C isolates, had a closer clonal relationship
with the W135 isolates than other serogroup isolates,
although they differed at five loci with the closest MLVA
types within the T7 group. A total of 32 MLVA types were
identified in the 31 serogroup W135 and three serogroup
C isolates; in contrast, only two ST types (ST-11 and its
single locus variant, ST-3016) were found in the isolates
(Table 2). The isolates with TW25 and TW52 types
emerged in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Since TW25 and
TW52 differed in as many as seven loci, the two MLVA
strains should not be derived from a common imported
strain.
The serogroup Y isolates shared a close clonal relationship
as the seven MLVA types, forming a compact cluster. Six
MLVA types differed in only one or two loci with the
founder type, TW3, which was identified in the earliest
collected isolates in Taiwan.
MLVA allelic profiles of isolates from patient-contact
episodes
Five isolates, collected from healthy contacts of four
patients were characterized by MLVA. The MLVA profiles
were identical for isolates from three episodes. Two isolates from the fourth episode differed in a single locus,
NMTR-7 (Table 4).

Discussion
Our data demonstrate that the MLVA method is powerful
for subtyping and useful for phylogenetic investigation of
N. meningitidis isolates. The MLVA exhibited a much
higher discriminatory power than PFGE for the isolates
tested and the resulting data agreed well with the epidemiological observations. Of the 100 N. meningitidis isolates

Page 7 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:44

characterized, 96 were collected from sporadic cases with
no apparently epidemiological links. This MLVA method
with 12 VNTR loci discriminated, not only all the genetically diversified serogroup B isolates, but also exhibited a
high degree of resolution for the serogroup W135 isolates.
Although serogroup W135 meningococci emerged in Taiwan before 1996, only four PFGE patterns, sharing a high
pattern similarity, were identified in the 31 isolates collected from 1996 to 2002 [9]. However, MLVA differentiated the 31 isolates into 30 genotypes. MLVA data also
supported the belief that serogroup Y meningococci were
derived from a recently emerging clone in Taiwan. Serogroup Y meningococci emerged for the first time in 2001
in Taiwan; the 11 isolates collected in 2001 to 2002 were
tightly clustered together. The clustering feature supported
the observation that the serogroup Y clone was recently
introduced into this country. MLVA genotyping also
showed that there were no a major epidemic N. meningitidis strain circulating in the country, where meningococcal disease was infrequent.
Our study showed that the clonal relationships between
the isolates, established with MLVA types, was in good
agreement with those built with ST types. As shown on
Figure 1, strains within a ST complex or ST group shared
more common VNTR loci. Among the 12 loci, four
(NMTR1, NMTR2, NMTR7 and NMTR 12) were highly
polymorphic; they could have higher variation rates. The
remaining loci could have moderate and low variation
rate. Thus, different sets of VNTR loci may be useful for
phylogenetic investigation of isolates evolving over different time scales. Phylogenetic investigations of spreading
of N. meningitidis strains over a long time scale will best be
carried out using loci with a low or moderate variation
rate. Forensics and outbreak investigations may use loci
with a higher variation rate. In our study, the MST grouping features built with 10 or 11 loci, which excluded one
or two highly polymorphic loci, such as NMTR1, NMTR2
or both from 12 loci, remained similar but tighter to that
with 12 loci (data not shown). Therefore, use of more
VNTR loci with a lower variation rate will increase the
power of MLVA in phylogenetic studies of N. meningitidis
strains evolving over a long time scale.
The allelic profiles of the 11 serogroup Y isolates demonstrated the level of stability for the 12 VNTR loci. The comparison of the allelic profiles indicated that VNTR2 had
the highest variation rate; five additional alleles at
NMTR2, but only one at NMTR1, NMTR7 and NMTR9,
evolved in the serogroup Y isolates over a 2-year time
span. The stability of the VNTR loci was also demonstrated by the comparison of the allelic profiles of isolates
from four patient-contact episodes. Although a single
locus variant was observed in isolates from a patient-contact episode (Table 4), this MLVA method should be sta-

ble enough for forensic and outbreak investigations. Since
variation normally occurs in only a small portion of isolates from an outbreak [15], such variation is usually not
a problem for interpretation of MLVA data.
The MLVA is useful for identification of outbreak strains.
In our record, there was no serogroup C meningococcus
identified in 1996–2000. A serogroup C isolate (with
TW25 genotype) was identified for the first time in 2001
and two (TW52 genotype) in 2002. Although the three
isolates differed in PFGE patterns, they had the same ST11 type [9]. Therefore, the 2002 isolates were considered
deriving from the 2001 strain. However, TW25 and TW52
differed in seven loci, including the high polymorphic loci
(NMTR1, NMTR2, NMTR7, and NMTR9) and three moderate polymorphic loci (NMTR12, NMTR18 and
NMTR19). MLVA profiles suggested that the two MLVA
strains should not derive from a common imported
strain. In contrast with, MLVA results suggested that the
serogroup Y isolates were evolved from a newly imported
clone; strains derived from the clone still caused infections in 2003 to 2005 with 2–3 patients a year.
To date, in our study and that of Yazdankhah et al. [20], a
total of 12 VNTR loci have been characterized, and more
could still exist in the genomes. For example, Jordan et al.
[22] identified 22 coding tandem repeat loci that varied in
numbers of repeat units between the three sequenced
strains, of which only five loci were included in this study.
Although the rest of the loci may have lower allelic polymorphism, they may be included in the VNTR set suitable
for phylogenetic investigation of N. meningitidis strains.
Of the 12 loci, five were not with repeat units of multiples
of 3 bp. However, it is not necessary that a repeat unit
needs to be of multiples of 3 bp for having a biological
function. For example, NMTR1 locus, having a 7-bp
repeat unit, is located within the coding sequence of the
glycosyltransferase (PglE) gene that involves in pilin glycosylation and phase variation [23]. Tandem repeat
sequences or repeat sequence tracts are usually involved in
diverse biological functions; to date, more than 100
repeat associated phase-variable genes in Neisseria spp.
have been identified [21,22,24]. Repeat loci may locate
within the coding region of a gene or in the non-coding
region involved in gene regulation [24]. The biological
function of NMTR2, NMTR12 and NMTR19 has not been
elucidated. NMTR12 is a compound repeat locus with 12and 13-bp repeat units; the two repeat units arranged in
variable numbers and sequences. Further investigation is
needed to explore the biological functions associated with
these repeat loci.

Conclusion
MLVA exhibits a higher degree of resolution than PFGE
for fine typing of N. meningitidis isolates and produces
portable data that can easily be used for comparisons
between laboratories via the Internet. MLVA data can also
be used to investigate phylogenetic relationship between
N. meningitidis strains. Therefore, MLVA can be adopted as
an epidemiological tool for forensics and disease outbreak investigations, and for investigating clonal relationship among meningococcal strains. However, the
mutation rate for each VNTR loci is still unknown. To fully
exploit the value of MLVA, more VNTR loci need to be
explored and more N. meningitidis isolates, of known epidemiological history, need to be characterized.

genomic sequences and then locates the positions of each
of the loci at the other two compared genomes. The three
genomic sequences are used in turn as the "parent"
sequence, so that a locus with only one repeat unit at a
genome, but with two or more repeat units at other
genomes, will not be missed. Searches found more than
300 repeat loci that were common to all the three strains
and had variable repeat units between the three strains.
Twenty-three repeat loci that had short repeat unit length
(≤ 30 bp), more than 85% repeat sequence identity, and
no indels were selected for further evaluation with 10
genetic distinct strains. Twelve loci, which were detected
in all of the 10 testing isolates and amplified with only
one amplicon, were chosen for genotyping of N. meningitidis isolates (Table 1).

Methods
Identification of VNTR loci
The genomes of N. meningitidis strains Z2491 (GenBank
accession no. AL157959), MC58 (GenBank accession no.
AE002098) and FAM18 (obtained from The Welcome
Trust Sanger Institute [25]), were explored for potential
VNTR loci using unpublished VNTRDB computer software developed by Kao et al. in National Taiwan University. The program, which incorporates the algorithm of
the Tandem Repeat Sequence Finder software [26],
searches tandem repeat loci from one of the three

Preparation of crude bacterial DNA
Meningococcal isolates, stored at -70°C, were plated onto
trytic soy agar with 5% sheep blood and incubated overnight at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. A loopful (10
µl) of bacterial growth was removed from the plate, suspended in 100 µl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM
EDTA, pH 8.0) in an Eppendorf tube, and boiled for 10
min. After centrifugation at 3700 g for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and used for PCR
amplification.

PCR amplification and analysis of VNTR regions
The primer sets specific to the 12 VNTR regions are listed
on Table 5. The primers were designed using the free program available at the Primer3 website [27]. A primer of
each primer set was labeled on 5' end with an ABI-compatible dye, 6-FAM, NED, VIC or PET by the manufacture
(Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Each 10-µl
PCR mixture contained 1 × PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.4 µM each primer, 200 µM each deoxyribonucleotide,
1.0 unit of the recombinant SuperNew Taq DNA polymerase (Jier Sheng Company, Taipei, Taiwan), and 1 µl of
DNA template prepared as above-mentioned. The samples were placed on a GeneAmp PCR System 9600
(Applied BioSystems) and the PCR reaction was performed with a denaturing step at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of amplification step at 94°C for 30 s,
at 54°C for 45 s, and at 72°C for 45 s, and by an extension
step at 72°C for 10 min. Three microliters of each PCR
products was electrophoresed in 2% SeaKem LE agarose
(Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, ME, USA) to check the
sizes of amplified DNA products and the quality of PCR
amplification.

Before size analysis the fluorescent amplicons were
diluted in water, usually at a 1:100 or 1:200 ratio, then
separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI Prism
3130 Genetic Analyzer with GeneScan 500 LIZ Size Standard (cat # 4322682; Applied BioSystems). Data were collected and lengths of amplicons were determined with
GeneScan Data Analysis Software, ver 3.7 (Applied BioSystems). All amplicons with different lengths from each
locus were subjected to nucleotide sequence determination to verify the repeat sequence and the numbers of
repeat units in the amplicons. The primers (without dye
label) used for nucleotide sequence determination were
the same as the primer sets used for PCR amplification.
DNA sequencing was performed using the ABI Prism Big
Dye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and
an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer. The numbers of
repeat units for the 12 VNTR loci (Table 1) and the predicted sizes of amplicons (Table 5) for the N. meningitidis
strains Z2491, MC58 and FAM18 were taken as the standards to infer the number of repeat unit of each locus for
the isolates tested.
Data analysis
The numbers of repeat units for each locus were saved as
"Character Type" data in BioNumerics software (version
3.5; Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) and then subjected
to cluster analysis using the Minimum Spanning Tree
method. The polymorphism information index or Nei's
diversity index (DI) was calculated for evaluating allele
diversity as 1-Σ (allele frequency)2.

Bacterial strains
A total of 105 N. meningitidis isolates, collected from meningitis patients and healthy contacts, were included in this
study. The collection from patients comprised 2 serogroup A isolates, 52 serogroup B isolates, 3 serogroup C
isolates, 31 serogroup W135 isolates, 11 serogroup Y and
1 non-groupable isolate (Table 2). They were collected
from sporadic cases between 1996 and 2002 in Taiwan,
except two pairs of isolates (NM255 and NM256; NM377
and NM378), which were, respectively, isolated from a
meningococcal disease outbreak in a family and from two
cases with a close temporal and spatial connection. All the
100 isolates from patients have been characterized by
PFGE and MLST in a previous study by Chiou et al. [9].
Five isolates from healthy contacts were collected from
four independent patient-contact episodes (Table 4).

Authors' contributions
JC Liao designed all the primers and MLVA analyzed all
the isolates. CC Li was in charge of searching potential
VNTR loci by computer software and MST clustering analyses. CS Chiou initiated and managed the project, analyzed data, and wrote the report. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.
