Abstract
Ten years ago, we reported that in adult human females the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) is a
source of germ cells. Recently, we also demonstrated that new primary follicles are formed by
assembly of oocytes with nests of primitive granulosa cells in the ovarian cortex. The components
of the new primary follicles, primitive granulosa and germ cells, differentiated sequentially from the
OSE, which arises from cytokeratin positive mesenchymal progenitor cells residing in the ovarian
tunica albuginea. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that the oocytes and granulosa
cells may differentiate in cultures derived from adult human ovaries. Cells were scrapped from the
surface of ovaries and cultured for 5 to 6 days, in the presence or absence of estrogenic stimuli
[phenol red (PhR)]. The OSE cells cultured in the medium without PhR differentiated into small (15
micron) cells of granulosa phenotype, and epithelial, neural, and mesenchymal type cells. In
contrast, OSE cells cultured in the presence of PhR differentiated directly into large (180 micron)
cells of the oocyte phenotype. Such cells exhibited germinal vesicle breakdown, expulsion of the
polar body, and surface expression of zona pellucida proteins, i.e. characteristics of secondary
oocytes. These in vitro studies confirm our in vivo observations that in adult human ovaries, the OSE
is a bipotent source of oocytes and granulosa cells. Development of numerous mature oocytes
from adult ovarian stem cells in vitro offers new strategies for the egg preservation, IVF utilization,
and treatment of female infertility. In addition, other clinical applications aiming to utilize stem cells,
and basic stem cell research as well, may employ totipotent embryonic stem cells developing from
fertilized oocytes.

Background
The origin of oocytes (and primary follicles) in ovaries of
adult mammalian females has been a matter of dispute for
over one hundred years. The resulting dogma was that all
oocytes in adult mammalian females persist from the fetal
period of life [1]. However, from a phylogenetic viewpoint, it seems contradictory that mammalian females,
including humans, would evolve a uniquely retrogressive
reproductive mechanism, requiring preservation of their
gametes from the fetal period for up to several decades.

Such long lasting preservation could cause an accumulation of spontaneous or environmentally induced genetic
alterations of oocytes in resting primary follicles. On the
contrary, oogenesis has been demonstrated in cultured
mouse embryonic stem cells [2], and mitotically active
germ cells have been reported in ovaries of adult prosimian primates [3] and mice [4]. We have shown that mesenchymal cells in ovarian tunica albuginea (TA)
differentiate into surface epithelium, a source of germ
cells entering blood vessels and contributing to follicular

renewal in adult human females [5,6]. These reports represent challenges to established dogma on the fetal origin
of mammalian eggs [7,8].
Regarding follicular renewal in adult human females, our
reports provide direct evidence that the ovarian surface
epithelium (OSE) is a source of germ cells, and new primary follicles are formed by assembly of oocytes with
nests of primitive granulosa cells in the ovarian cortex
[5,6]. Components for the new primary follicles, primitive
granulosa and germ cells, differentiate sequentially and de
novo from mesenchymal progenitor cells residing in the
ovarian TA. It appears that mesenchymal progenitor cells
first contribute to the development of epithelial cells similar to granulosa cells, and these cells subsequently form
epithelial nests descending into the deeper ovarian cortex.
Oogenesis follows later. During this period, the mesenchymal progenitor cells differentiate into OSE cells with
an embryonic character, lining either the ovarian surface
or invaginated epithelial crypts. These cells are a source of
germ cells, which assemble with nests of primitive granulosa cells to form primary follicles. Systemic hormonal
concentrations may influence these processes. The data
presented here indicate that granulosa cells are likely to
develop during a period of low estrogenic stimuli (early
and mid follicular phase). Differentiation of germ cells
and oocytes may be associated with high estrogen concentrations (preovulatory period). The assembly of oocytes
with granulosa cell nests (follicular renewal) may occur
during the luteal phase [6]. Differentiation of primitive
granulosa and germ cells from the bipotent mesenchymal
cell precursors of TA in adult human ovaries possibly represents a sophisticated mechanism created during the evolution of female reproduction. This contrasts with the
continuous preservation of germline stem cells seen in
males [9], and female prosimian primates and mice [3,4].
In culture, the OSE cells undergo an epithelio-mesenchymal transition. These cells are initially cytokeratin (CK)
positive, but lose CK expression with time and passage in
culture [10]. However, upon introduction of E-cadherin,
the mesenchymal type cells can differentiate backward
into the epithelial phenotype [11]. Multipotential progenitor cells exhibiting a mesenchymal phenotype and capable of differentiation into distinct cell types have been
derived from various other adult tissues [12-16]. Mesenchymal-epithelial and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions
may reflect a plasticity of progenitor cells in a particular
microenvironment. They may occur sequentially (mesenchymal-epithelial followed by epithelial-mesenchymal
transitions) under the influence of the extracellular
matrix, cytokines (transforming growth factor β, fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal
growth factor, BMP2 and BMP4), adhesion molecules
(integrins, E-cadherins), membrane receptors, intercellu-

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/17

lar junctions, signaling pathways (MAPK) or transcription
factors (β-catenin), commonly produced in the embryo
and less frequently in adult organisms. Such transitions
are manifestations of cell plasticity and result in dramatic
changes – in lineage commitments to certain cell types
(reviewed in [17]).
In culture, in addition to their characteristic morphology,
oocytes can also be identified by alkaline phosphatase
activity, though nonspecific results have been described in
various tissues [18]. However, zona pellucida (ZP) proteins and some ZP antigens, such as PS1 meiotically
expressed carbohydrate antigen and heat-solubilized porcine zona (HSPZ) proteins, are more specific markers. In
fact, they have been detected in the OSE cells of the rabbit,
cat, monkey, baboon and human [6,19,20]. Hence,
expression of ZP proteins in OSE cells suggests a relationship to oocytes. The oocytes may also express CK18, a
marker of the Balbiani body, but not CK5,6,8,17 markers
of OSE and granulosa cells (reviewed in [6]). Furthermore, oocytes also express the intermediate filament
vimentin, a protein which plays an important role in the
maturation and fertilization of eggs [21].
Our goal for the present study was to investigate mesenchymal-epithelial and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions
in OSE cell cultures from adult human ovaries. An in vitro
approach allows control of the conditions in the initial
medium composition, e.g., presence or absence of estrogenic stimuli, and determination of the secretory products
of cultured cells in the conditioned medium. The study of
OSE cultures was initially a part of a larger project to
establish primary fibroblast cultures from the pelvic floor
(levator ani fascia) and uterine round ligaments. Our preliminary studies indicated that pelvic floor fibroblasts
grow better in the presence of estrogenic stimuli. We also
detected the presence of oocyte phenotype cells in some
OSE cultures. Thus, in the present experiments, we cultured OSE cells in the presence or absence of estrogenic
stimuli. Phase contract microscopy and antibodies against
HSPZ, PS1, CK18, CK5,6,8,17, and vimentin were used in
single and double color peroxidase immunohistochemistry to identify oocytes and granulosa cells in cultures
derived from adult human ovaries.

Materials and methods
Collection and cultures of OSE cells
All chemicals and consumables, except where specified
otherwise, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO. Cultured cells were collected from ovaries
associated with fresh hysterectomy/bilateral salpingooophorectomy specimens (five women, ages 39 – 52
years). The surgery was performed for medical indications, including chronic pelvic pain, uterine fibroids, and/
or uterine bleeding (severe dysmenorrhea) not

responding to the conservative treatment. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board and informed
consent was obtained from the patients.
In order to prevent loss of the OSE cells, no attempts were
made to clean the ovarian surface from blood contamination accompanying the surgery prior to their collection.
Consequently, the marked contamination with erythrocytes, along with our inability to distinguish cell types at
this time, hindered our ability to count cells until the
medium was changes after 24 hours of culture. The surface
of intact ovaries was first gently scraped in the aseptic laminar flow hood with a sterile stainless steel surgery knife
blade No. 21 (Becton Dickinson, AcuteCare, Franklin
Lakes, NJ), leaving the blade edge behind the knife pass
(pertains to data in Figs 1,2,3). This procedure was
selected with an intent to include OSE and some adjacent
TA mesenchymal cells. In some instances, a second type of
culture was also established, where the cells collected
from the ovarian surface were enriched with cells spontaneously released (without scraping) from dissected ovaries (pertains to data in Fig. 4). The intent of this approach
was to test the activity of the alternative pathway for the
origin of germ cells from cortical epithelial crypts (see Fig.
5a and Ref. [6] for details). Such cells were passed through
a sterile 70 µm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) to prevent contamination with larger type cells
and structures.
The cells were collected into sterile petri dishes containing
tissue culture medium supplemented with heat inactivated 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco/BRL, Grand
Island, NY) and antibiotics (50 µg/ml gentamycin, 100 U/
ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin). The tissue
culture media utilized was either Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle Medium/Ham's F12, phenol red free (DMEM/F12;
without estrogenic stimuli) or Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle's Medium containing 25 mM HEPES, 4500 mg/L
glucose, and phenol red (DMEM-HG; with estrogenic
stimuli). The possible influence of additional steroid hormones or promoters of steroidogenesis present in the
serum can not be ruled out. However, at the same serum
concentration, there were apparent differences in the evolution and maturation of oocytes cultured in media with
and without PhR (Fig. 4h–j). There was no other treatment imposed during the culture.
The cells were spun down (1000 × g, 5 min, 24°C),
diluted in 0.75 – 1.5 ml of supplemented media, seeded
in either 3 or 6 wells of a 24-well plate (250 µl per well)
(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and cultured in an
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C. The
number of wells was chosen by the size of ovaries. Cells
collected from small ovaries were seeded into 3 wells, and
from larger ovaries into six wells. All ovaries involved in

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/17

the experiment were anovulatory, as no corpora lutea
were detected. The culture medium was changed once
after 24 hours. This left only adherent (viable) cells in culture, and eliminated non-adherent cells and the majority
of contaminating erythrocytes. The cell cultures were
monitored daily by phase contrast microscopy and live
cells evaluated by immunohistochemistry after 5–6 days
from the initial seeding. Viability of cells was apparent
from their active movement, changes in shape, and movement of their nuclei (compare Fig. 4e and 4f). The number
of adherent cells in a single well of 24-well plate ranged
between ~100 to 1000 during the late culture period (day
5 or 6).
Single and double color peroxidase immunohistochemistry
The medium was aspirated from wells of the 24-well plate,
and cells were allowed to dry under a fan before placing
them in a ventilated hood overnight. This is a procedure
we have utilized for cryostat sections. The bottoms of the
wells were dried in the upright position and found macroscopically dry within a few seconds. The cells were fixed
with 96% ethanol for 5 minutes, allowed to dry again, and
incubated overnight (4°C) with primary antibodies
against ZP proteins: rabbit-anti heat solubilized porcine
zona [19] (HSPZ, 1: 20) or mouse monoclonal PS1 antibody recognizing meiotically expressed ZP carbohydrate
antigen [20,22] diluted 1:10 in phosphate buffered solution (PBS), pH 7.22. The HSPZ and PS1 antibodies were
originally donated by Dr. Dunbar, and an additional
HSPZ antibody by Dr. Prasad. We also used mouse-anti
human CK18, clone CY90, Sigma (diluted 1:50), mouseanti human CK5,6,8,17, clone MNF116, DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA (diluted 1:50), and mouse antihuman vimentin, clone V9, DAKO Corporation (diluted
1:50).

As a control, the HLA-DR antibody donated by Drs.
Hilgert and Horejsi (tissue culture supernatant diluted
1:5), which does not react with OSE cells, was used. We
used an HLA-DR antibody not reacting with fibroblast,
granulosa, epithelial, germ or oocyte cell types, in order to
identify activated tissue macrophages, but did not find
any such cells in day 5 or 6 cultures. This does not exclude
the possibility that activated tissue macrophages may have
been present during the initial stages of culture.
After several washes in PBS (room temperature), the cells
were incubated with peroxidase labeled corresponding
secondary antibodies – goat anti-rabbit IgG, pre-absorbed
with human serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West
Grove, PA), diluted 1:50; or swine anti-mouse IgG
(donated by Dr. Peknicova), diluted 1:50 and absorbed
with rat kidney homogenate to remove background as
described previously [6]. After additional washes in PBS
(room temperature), the bound antibodies were

Comparison of human oogenesis in vivo and in vitro
Figure 5
Comparison of human oogenesis in vivo and in vitro a) A working model of possible pathways for oogenesis and formation of primary follicles in adult human ovaries in vivo (adjusted from Ref. [6]). (1) Ovarian tunica albuginea (ta) stem cells
(green color) first differentiate into the CK+ fibroblasts (blue color) and by mesenchymal-epithelial transition give rise to the
SE cells directly covering the ovarian cortex (arched arrow). (2) Closing of TA results in the formation of epithelial cords in the
upper ovarian cortex. (3) Fragmented epithelial cords give rise to the epithelial nests, which resemble primitive granulosa cells
and descend into the lower ovarian cortex. (4) Depending on certain in situ (stromal and neuronal) and systemic (hormonal)
influences, the TA progenitors differentiate into the SE cells covering TA, which may, by asymmetric division, give rise to the
ZP+ germ cells. (5) These primitive germ cells symmetrically divide, descend into the ovarian cortex, and associate with adjacent cortical vessels (6). Intravascular transport (7) is associated with a substantial increase of germ cell size and with development of ZP+ anchors (green lines), which may serve to slow down the transport speed and signal the epithelial nests to
associate with a particular vascular segment. 8) The intravascular germ cells differentiating into the oocytes are picked up by
epithelial nests associated with the proper cortical vessels. Such oocyte-nest complexes show an "octopus-like" (9) formations
during the early stage of assembly, and a formation of the Balbiani body during the intermediate stage (light blue body, 10). The
Balbiani body persists in resting primary follicles (11), but diminishes upon the growth promoting signals, including Thy-1 dp signaling derived from the follicle-accompanying vessels (12, dashed line). An alternative pathway for the germ cell origin from TA
precursors (4') consists of a constitution of cortical crypts formed by SE-like embryonal type cells, possibly originating from,
but not necessarily connected with the deep SE invaginations, as evidenced from serial sections. The "alternative" pathway of
germ cell origin may supply the oocytes directly to the neighboring nests (dashed arched arrows) and, via vascular transport
(dotted arched arrow), saturate distant nests to form the primary follicles. The oocytes not utilized for follicular renewal accumulate in medullary vessels and degenerate (bottom right) [6]. b) In vitro, the CK5+ oocyte precursors may differentiate into
CK5- cells (see Fig 2g), enlarge and undergo germinal vesicle breakdown followed by first meiotic division with a release of the
polar body (pb) and ZP surface expression (brown color, see Fig. 3e and 4h).

visualized by diaminobenzidine substrate as described
previously [6], but without hematoxylin counterstain,
covered with PBS, and images captured as described
below. The cells stained for CK18 or ZP were processed
further for dual color immunohistochemistry to identify
co-expression of other proteins, and visualized with blue
chromogen substrate as described previously [6]. Finally,
the washed cells were covered with PBS containing 0.01%
azide as a preservative.
Image processing
Two independent observers evaluated the live cells by
phase contrast and subsequent immunohistochemistry
using an inverted microscope (NIKON, Nikon Inc.,
Instrument Division, Garden City, NY) equipped with a
DEI-470 CCD Video Camera System (Optronics Engineering, Goleta, CA) with detail enhancement. The video
images were captured by CG-7 color frame grabber (Scion
Corporation, Frederick, MD) supported by Scion Image
public software developed at the National Institutes of
Health (Wayne Rasband, NIH, Bethesda, MD), and ported
to Windows XP, 2002 release (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmont, WA). To obtain figure panels, the captured
video images were copied into Microsoft® Power-Point® 97
SR-2 (Microsoft Corporation). Each image (including
controls) was further copied into Microsoft Photo Editor
3.0 (Microsoft Corporation), and blue saturation adjusted
(brightness 70, contrast 70, gamma 0.30). In total, more
than 100 images were captured and stored.

Results and discussion
Oogenesis in vitro from ovarian surface epithelium (OSE)
cells
We report data from pure OSE cultures of two cases investigated either under PhR- (age 47) or PhR+ medium conditions (age 40), and pure OSE and mixed cultures (OSE
+ stromal compartments; one patient) studied under both
conditions (age 39 years). Cultures from the remaining
two patients (ages 42 and 52 years) consisted of mesenchymal cells only.
Experiment 1 (Fig. 1)
Primary culture of cells scrapped from the surface of ovaries of the 47 year old female was maintained for 6 days in
the Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham's F12 phenol red free (DMEM/F12), which was supplemented with
20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. The 5–6
day interval was chosen since, except for fibroblasts, other
cell types are not phenotypically distinguishable prior to
day 4 (see Fig. 4). Phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 1a)
shows differentiation of cells toward the mesenchymal
(fibroblast) phenotype with perinuclear accumulation of
cytoplasmic organelles (arrowhead).

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/17

Immunohistochemistry shows ZP expression associated
with the nuclei and perinuclear space of mesenchymal
type cells (arrowhead, Fig. 1b). The culture also showed
clusters of cells of epithelial phenotype, which exhibited
nuclear and perinuclear ZP expression (Fig. 1c). Occasionally, ZP+ cells of neural phenotype with extensions
toward the mesenchymal cells (arrowhead, Fig. 1d) were
observed, including growing cultures (inset). Fig. 1e
shows mesenchymal type cells (arrowhead) and clusters
(arrows) of small (15 µm) cells of granulosa cell phenotype. Beside their characteristic size, these granulosa type
cells showed strong ZP expression, which has been found
to be shared between oocytes and granulosa cells [6,23].
Furthermore, double color ZP/CK5,6,8,17 immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1f) showed additional dark blue staining
(arrows) characteristic of granulosa but not germ or mesenchymal cells [6]. Note only a brown color in mesenchymal type cells (arrowhead). These observations indicate
that numerous small cells exhibiting the phenotype and
biochemical markers of granulosa cells can differentiate in
the OSE culture.
An interesting question is why other cell types, in addition
to the mesenchymal cells, evolved in this culture. As we
have noted, the multipotential progenitor cells exhibiting
a mesenchymal phenotype are capable of differentiation
into distinct cell types, similar to stem cell cultures derived
from other adult tissues [12-16]. In this culture, groups of
cells exhibited either epithelial, neural, of granulosa cell
phenotypes. We speculate that if a single mesenchymal
cell in the given group decides to be, for example, an epithelial cell, the adjacent mesenchymal cells follow the
same pattern. If no such decision is made, the cells in the
group remain mesenchymal (compare groups of cells in
Fig 1b–f). Hence, in this instance, the result is not an artifact of the medium used, but may be a case of distinct differentiation between groups of cells in the same culture.
Experiment 2 (Figs 2 and 3)
In contrast, cells from 40 year old female cultured in the
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium containing 25 mM
HEPES, 4500 mg/L glucose and phenol red (DMEM-HG;
supplemented with 20% FBS and antibiotics as above)
showed a uniform pattern of epithelial type cells, while no
other cell types, including mesenchymal and granulosa
cells, were present. Phenol red is a weak estrogen with
apparent biological effects, and the estrogen receptor
alpha binding affinity in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's
Medium is equivalent to levels of 17β estradiol as high as
0.45 nM [24]. This estrogenic binding affinity of phenol
red is close to that of 17β estradiol serum level during the
preovulatory peak [25]. High estrogen concentrations
prior to ovulation are not only predictive of high oocyte
quality [26], but they may be essential for stimulating
oocytes to enter the first meiotic division and form large

secondary oocytes. Figs 2a and 2b show phase contrast of
large cells exhibiting an oocyte phenotype in the OSE culture maintained in DMEM-HG medium with phenol red
for 5 days. The cell in Fig. 2b reached 180 µm in diameter
and showed a centrally located 40 µm nucleus with nucleolus, and perinuclear accumulation of organelles
(arrowhead).
Fig. 2c shows immunohistochemical staining of the cell in
panel 2b for CK18. The nascent primary follicles in adult
human ovaries show the gradual formation of CK18+ Balbiani bodies, which are undetectable by antibodies
against other cytokeratins expressed by granulosa cells –
CK5,6,8,17 [5,6,27]. A study by Cox and Spradling indicates that during Drosophila oogenesis, follicular cells are
a source of mitochondria, which enter the oocyte cytoplasm via the "ring canal" to form the Balbiani body,
thereby supplying virtually all of the mitochondria of the
oocyte [28]. Dispersion of Balbiani bodies releases mitochondria required for the progressive growth of the
oocyte. In a study of turkey hens, no Balbiani bodies were
detected in stage I oocytes, but they appeared in stage II
oocytes, and diminished in the oocytes of growing follicles, coinciding with the dispersion of mitochondria
throughout the ooplasm [29]. Similar observations were
reported in human oocytes [30]. The staining of the large
oocyte in Fig. 2c shows diffuse CK18 immunoexpression
with a preserved accumulation of staining around the cell
nucleus (arrowhead). The perinuclear space also exhibits
enhanced staining for ZP proteins shown by double color
immunohistochemistry (CK brown/ZP blue color) in the
same cell (arrowhead, Fig. 2d, compare with 2c). Control
immunohistochemical staining is shown in Fig. 2e. Fig. 2f
shows a cluster of OSE cells with perinuclear ZP expression (arrowhead), which differentiates into the large cells
(arrows) that can be released into the free space. This
resembles oocytes leaving the ovary during the perinatal
period [31]. Fig 2g shows another cluster of OSE cells subjected to ZP/CK5,6,8,17 staining. Note the dark blue color
in smaller OSE cells (arrowhead) and a diminution in
larger cells (arrow).
We also observed large cells with two nuclei, where the ZP
expression was apparent in the centrally located nucleus
only (arrowhead vs. arrow, Fig. 3a; note ZP+ intermediate
filaments). These cells of oocyte phenotype did not
express CK5,6,8,17 [6] (Fig. 3b). The cell in Fig. 3c has two
60 µm nuclei and expresses the intermediate filament
vimentin, a protein which plays an important role in the
maturation and fertilization of eggs [21]. This observation
indicates endoreplication of the oocyte nuclei in the
absence of cell division, which has also been described in
Drosophila eggs [32,33]. Interestingly, these multinucleated cells were not observed in the cultures without phenol red. The cell in Fig. 3d was stained for CK18 (brown

color) and ZP proteins (blue). The centrally located
nucleus again shows ZP expression (arrowhead), while
the nucleus to the side, which resembles a polar body, was
unstained (white arrow). Note a lack of surface staining
(black arrow) vs. Fig 3e. The cell in Fig. 3e shows a ZP+
centrally located nucleus (arrowhead), with an adjacent
unstained and fragmented structure (white arrow). Notably, there was surface expression of ZP proteins (solid
arrow), which is important for the sperm-egg interaction
[34]. Note the diminution of ZP+ intermediate filaments
vs. Fig. 3a. Fig. 3f shows nuclear staining (arrowhead) for
PS1, a meiotically expressed lactosaminoglycan-associated carbohydrate antigen of all three ZP glycoproteins
[22,35], with more intense expression in the one of two
nuclear segments, as indicated by the arrow. Two cells in
Fig. 3g show the PS1 unstained nuclei (arrowheads) and
adjacent PS1+ structures resembling expelled polar bodies
(arrows). It has to be noted that similar couples of cells
were often observed in PhR+ cultures, one of which was
usually more developed (left cell in panel g) compared to
the other (right).
Oogenesis in "mixed" ovarian cultures
Experiment 3 (Fig. 4)
Next we decided to compare the PhR+ and PhR- conditions in pure OSE and mixed (OSE + stromal components) cultures derived from ovaries of a 39 year old
female. It is important to note that all cells collected,
including pure surface cultures, were passed through the
cell strainer prior to processing and seeding, a procedure
not applied in experiments 1 and 2. Utilization of a cell
strainer ensured that mostly single cells, and not cell
sheets (see Fig. 2f and 2g) were seeded. The mixed cultures
were established to test the possible involvement of the
alternative pathway for germ cell origin (Fig. 5a). Except
for the occasional mesenchymal cells of the fibroblast
phenotype, there was no evidence of cell commitment
until day 4 of culture. However, the undifferentiated cells
varied in the density of organelles and size, the latter ranging from 15 (arrowhead, Fig. 4a) to 50 µm in diameter
(arrow).

On day 5 (end of the experiment) the cells collected from
the ovarian surface did not progress beyond the state
found on day 3, and no oocytes were detected regardless
of the presence or absence of PhR. However, many cells of
the oocyte phenotype were found in mixed cultures with
PhR. They showed moderate (100 µm) size without zona
pellucida (arrows, Fig. 4b), and were accompanied by
fibroblasts (arrowheads). Larger oocytes (120 µm) accompanied by fibroblasts (arrowheads, Fig. 4c) showed a
developing zona layer (arrow). On the other hand, an
association of small round cells resembling granulosa
cells (arrowheads, Fig. 4d) was characteristic for large
oocytes (200 µm). The oocytes accompanied by fibrob-

lasts (arrowheads, Fig. 4e) with thick zona pellucida
(arrow) observed on day 4 showed no change in size on
day 5 (Fig. 4f). Staining for ZP proteins showed a strong
nuclear localization (black arrowhead, Fig. 4f) but no surface ZP expression (arrow). Note a well-defined separation between the nucleus and cytoplasm (a nuclear
envelope, black arrowhead) of the oocyte. Also note the
cellular and nuclear movements, when the Fig. 4e and 4f
are compared. Fig. 4g shows cytoplasmic staining for CK
5,6,8,17 in mesenchymal cells (black arrowhead, note
unstained nuclei) and moderate nonspecific staining
(peroxidase expression) in the nuclei of other uncommitted cells (white arrowheads) in this culture. The nuclear
peroxidase expression has been recently reported to
increase in bovine oocytes and cumulus cells during in
vitro maturation [36], and this may apply for many cells in
this ovarian culture.
Some large cells in PhR+ mixed cultures showed characteristics of secondary oocytes with surface ZP expression
(black arrow, Fig. 4h), expulsion of the polar body (white
arrowhead) and poor nuclear/cytoplasmic separation
(black arrowhead; see Ref. [37]). Interestingly, the surface
ZP expression was absent in the oocyte segment toward
where the polar body was extruded (white arrow).
Rare oocytes were detected in mixed cultures without PhR.
The four day culture shows a giant (300 µm) oocyte with
persisting germinal vesicle (Fig. 4i). Staining for ZP proteins (brown color) and vimentin (blue) on day 5 shows
no surface ZP expression (arrow, Fig. 4j). This suggests
that estrogenic stimuli may be required for the germinal
vesicle breakdown and the development of secondary
oocytes.
There are several issues to be addressed when experiments
1–3 are compared. For instance, experiment 3 provides
evidence that ovarian fibroblasts may stimulate the
oocytes to develop a thick zona pellucida layer, which
allows their preservation until follicular growth is
induced, when granulosa cells may contribute to oocyte
enlargement. However, when compared to the experiment 2, no oocyte development was apparent in cultures
derived from ovarian surface regardless of the presence of
PhR. In experiment 3, however, the cells collected from
the ovarian surface were passed through a cell strainer,
which probably prevented the passage of the OSE cell
sheets detected in the experiment 2 cultures (Fig. 2f and
2g). Apparently, cells derived from the OSE cell clusters
are capable of transforming directly into secondary
oocytes (Figs 2 and 3). On the other hand, experiment 3
has shown that an alternative origin of oocytes, e.g. from
OSE cells in ovarian crypts (Fig. 5a), is possible in these
mixed ovarian cultures in the presence of PhR. The likelihood that these mixed cultures are contaminated by

http://www.rbej.com/content/3/1/17

migrating germ cells cannot be excluded, although very
few oocytes were detected in PhR- mixed cultures. Nevertheless, many more oocytes of distinct sizes and stages of
development were found in mixed cultures with PhR+.
This suggests that estrogenic stimulation may play an
important role in oocyte development. In addition, the
age of the patients must be taken into account. Five day
cultures of two patients (age 42 and 52) showed only mesenchymal cells. We suggested earlier that OSE in aging
ovaries may be unable to produce germ cells, possibly due
to the lack of local signals from activated tissue macrophages and neural cells, which may produce substances
regulating the fate of progenitor (stem) cells [5] (see also
Background).

Conclusion
Altogether, our observations show for the first time that
granulosa cells (Figs 1e and 1f) and oocytes (Figs 2 and 3)
may develop directly from cultured OSE cells derived
from adult human ovaries. This confirms our in vivo
observations that in adult human ovaries, the OSE is a
bipotent source of oocytes and granulosa cells. In addition, the oocytes developed in vitro undergo the first meiotic division, (Fig. 5b), after which they become suitable
for fertilization. Oocytes may also develop in cultures
containing ovarian stromal components. We speculate
that such oocytes may originate from migrating germ cells
or OSE invaginations (cortical crypts, Fig. 5a). The development and maturation of oocytes appear to be stimulated by estrogens. Depending on culture conditions (type
of media utilized), processing of the collected cells, age of
the ovaries, commitment of neighboring cells, and other
local and hormonal factors, the progenitor mesenchymal
cells in ovarian cultures may differentiate into additional
cell types, including granulosa cells, or persist unchanged.
The ability to produce mature mammalian eggs from
adult ovaries in vitro has several potential applications in
the human and animal reproduction. Firstly, compared to
the collection of follicular oocytes, the technique is easier
(scrapping of the ovarian surface, with or without cortical
component) and the yield might be higher for IVF and
veterinary medicine purposes, since differentiation of primary oocytes in vitro may provide a larger number of secondary (mature) eggs. Secondly, for IVF purposes, this
technique may be successful in women with premature
ovarian failure, who lack follicles in their ovaries. Thirdly,
the development and differentiation of oocytes from OSE
precursors in vitro may help to better understand the process of oocyte renewal in vivo, and the role of accompanying granulosa and mesenchymal cells in the regulation of
oocyte maturation or preservation. Fourthly, frozen OSE
cells (oocyte stem cells) from younger females may be preserved for later production of fresh eggs. This may prevent
the occurrence of fetal genetic alterations, which are often

associated with pregnancies in advanced maternal age,
possibly due to the lack of follicular renewal in aging ovaries. In addition, a colonization of premenopausal ovaries
with younger oocyte and granulosa stem cells may establish a new cohort of primary follicles. This may result in a
10- to 12-year delay of the onset of natural menopause.
Finally, the ovarian stem cells may serve as progenitor
cells for several cell types for stem cell research, and fertilization of evolved mature human oocytes could result in
the production of totipotent embryonic stem cells for
research purposes and therapeutic applications.
