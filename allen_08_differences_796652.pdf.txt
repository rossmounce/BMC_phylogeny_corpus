Abstract
Background: There is spectacular morphological diversity in nature but lineages typically display
a limited range of phenotypes. Because developmental processes generate the phenotypic variation
that fuels natural selection, they are a likely source of evolutionary biases, facilitating some changes
and limiting others. Although shifts in developmental regulation are associated with morphological
differences between taxa, it is unclear how underlying mechanisms affect the rate and direction of
evolutionary change within populations under selection.
Here we focus on two ecologically relevant features of butterfly wing color patterns, eyespot size
and color composition, which are similarly and strongly correlated across the serially repeated
eyespots. Though these two characters show similar patterns of standing variation and covariation
within a population, they differ in key features of their underlying development. We targeted pairs
of eyespots with artificial selection for coordinated (concerted selection) versus independent
(antagonistic selection) change in their color composition and size and compared evolutionary
responses of the two color pattern characters.
Results: The two characters respond to selection in strikingly different ways despite initially similar
patterns of variation in all directions present in the starting population. Size (determined by local
properties of a diffusing inductive signal) evolves flexibly in all selected directions. However, color
composition (determined by a tissue-level response to the signal concentration gradient) evolves
only in the direction of coordinated change. There was no independent evolutionary change in the
color composition of two eyespots in response to antagonistic selection. Moreover, these
differences in the directions of short-term evolutionary change in eyespot size and color
composition within a single species are consistent with the observed wing pattern diversity in the
genus.
Conclusion: Both characters respond rapidly to selection for coordinated change, but there are
striking differences in their response to selection for antagonistic, independent change across
eyespots. While many additional factors may contribute to both short- and long-term evolutionary
response, we argue that the compartmentalization of developmental processes can influence the
diversification of serial repeats such as butterfly eyespots, even under strong selection.

Background
Despite the diversity of animal form in nature, a limited
range of phenotypes is often observed [1-3]. Stasis, convergence, and limits in the direction of morphological
evolution occur within lineages even when strong selection is implicated in divergence [4-7]. The propensity for
phenotypes to evolve, or evolvability [8-11], is determined by the capacity of genetic and developmental systems to produce heritable variation and the action of
selection on those variants [12,13]. Consequently, rates of
adaptive change and diversification are expected to
depend critically on underlying developmental mechanisms [2,5,9,14-16]. Several different lines of evidence
provide more understanding of the role development
plays in determining the direction of evolutionary change,
including the documented association between morphological differences and changes in regulation of developmental-genetic pathways (reviewed in [17]), analysis of
the variational properties of different developmental
mechanisms [18-20], and analyses of the distribution of
morphological characters in a given phylogeny [21]. How
development affects the rate and direction of evolutionary
change in contemporary populations under selection,
however, remains largely unexplored [22].
Diversification of serial repeats
The elaboration and differentiation of serially repeated
characters provides clear examples of the association
between underlying mechanisms and morphological evolution. The complexity and diversity of arthropod body
segments, tetrapod limbs, vertebrate teeth, and nymphalid butterfly wing color patterns all result from the
evolutionary differentiation of homologous serial repeats
[23-26]. Individual elements often covary strongly,
reflecting the effects of shared developmental pathways
and mechanisms coordinating their development [25].
This covariance can affect rates of evolutionary change
[5,15,27], potentially limiting the independent evolution
of serial repeats. As a consequence, development can bias
evolution (sensu [28]), as certain morphological changes
may be more readily achieved than others. However,
recent empirical studies demonstrate that strong limits
predicted by patterns of covariation do not always prevent
the independent evolution of morphological traits under
artificial selection [29-31]. One plausible explanation for
the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and
empirical results is the failure of current evolutionary
genetic models to account for the details of development
that determine how phenotypic variation is generated,
and thereby affect the rate and direction of evolutionary
change [32-34]. Artificial selection experiments are a powerful tool for exploring limits on the process of morphological evolution, particularly in the evolution of
correlated characters [35-43]. Here we focus on two characters with similar patterns of covariation among a set of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/94

serial repeats. These characters, elements of the color pattern on butterfly wings, differ in key aspects of their development. We use artificial selection to explore effects of
these differences on the rate and direction of evolutionary
change in this complex morphological phenotype.
Evolution of eyespot patterns on butterfly wings
Within Bicyclus and other closely related butterfly genera,
wing pattern diversification was probably driven in part
by a long history of sexual and natural selection acting on
the eyespots [44,45], which are serially repeated along the
wing margins. Each eyespot consists of concentric rings of
black and gold color surrounding a white central spot
[46]. Color composition (the relative dimensions of the
gold and black rings) and size are two important functional characteristics of eyespots [47,48] that differ in critical aspects of their development. Properties of an
inductive signal (e.g., signal concentration) produced by
cells in the eyespot organizer, the central focus [49],
largely determine eyespot size [46,50,51], whereas color
composition is determined by the threshold response of
surrounding tissue to the concentration gradient of the
diffusing focal signal [52,53]. Each of these two aspects of
induction (signaling and response) appears to contribute
differently to phenotypic variation in the eyespot pattern
[54] and may have very different consequences for color
pattern evolution.

When selection targets either the color composition or
size of a single eyespot, all eyespots evolve in concert, even
those on different wing surfaces [51,53]. Despite differences in the underlying development of color composition and size, each character is strongly and positively
correlated across serially repeated eyespots and their main
axes of variation [28] in captive B. anynana populations lie
in the direction of concerted changes in two or more eyespots. We used artificial selection to search for limits in
this phenotype space, and selected for concerted (along
the main axis of variation) and antagonistic (orthogonal
to the main axis) change in the color composition or size
of two eyespots. By applying similar selection to both
characters and using a comparative analysis we test
whether the characters differ in their propensity to evolve
independently among serial repeats. Given initial similarities in patterns of standing variation for both characters,
we argue in favor of the hypothesis that known differences
in the developmental determination of eyespot color
composition and eyespot size affect their ability to
respond to antagonistic selection, and thus to evolve independently in a population under selection.

Results and Discussion
Differences in selection response between eyespot color
composition and size
Color composition and size were similarly correlated
between the serially repeated eyespots in the B. anynana
base population before selection (color composition:
rpearson ± SE = 0.42 ± 0.03, N = 1056, between ventral hindwing eyespots E4 and E6; size: rpearson ± SE = 0.52 ± 0.02,
N = 2254, between anterior and posterior dorsal forewing
eyespots). For both characters, most phenotypic variation
in the base population lay in the direction of positive covariation between two eyespots but each exhibited substantial variation around this main axis (Fig. 1a, d). Previous
experiments demonstrated the genetic basis for these phenotypic correlations and the presence of substantial additive genetic variation for the size and color of individual
eyespots [51,53,55,56]. As expected, both color composition and size responded rapidly to concerted selection
imposed along the main axis of phenotypic variation (Fig.
1b, e; Fig. 2a, b). After 10 generations of concerted selection (see Materials and Methods), novel phenotypes well
outside the range of variation in the base population were
produced: color composition diverged ~2–3 SD (standard
deviations, calculated from the base population) in the
'Black-Black' and 'Gold-Gold' directions relative to unselected control lines (Fig. 2a, c), and eyespot size diverged
~4–6 SD in the 'Large-Large' and 'Small-Small' directions
relative to unselected controls (Fig. 2b, d). In contrast,
responses to antagonistic selection demonstrate that the
boundaries of phenotype space are very different for the
two characters in this population (Fig. 1c, f; Fig. 2a, b).
There is little potential for independent evolutionary
change in eyespot color composition, compared with the
strikingly flexible evolution of eyespot sizes.

After 10 generations of antagonistic selection, no novel
'uncoupled' eyespot phenotypes appeared in the 'BlackGold' or 'Gold-Black' directions (Fig. 1c; Fig. 2a, c). The
rate of response to antagonistic selection (scaled to the
cumulative selection differential; Table 1) is clearly lower
than the rate of response to selection for concerted
changes in eyespot color composition. In some replicates
there was no significant response to antagonistic selection
for color composition (Table 1). Although selection can
rapidly shift the mean color composition of the entire eyespot pattern (Fig. 1b; Fig. 2a, c), there are limits on the
independent evolutionary change of individual eyespots.
No comparable limits are apparent for eyespot size; antagonistic selection ('Large-Small' and 'Small-Large' directions; Fig. 1F, Fig. 2b, d) rapidly produced combinations
of large and small eyespots that were not present in the
starting population [57]. Moreover, the rate of response to
antagonistic selection on eyespot size was as high (or
higher, in some replicates) as the rate of response to concerted selection (Table 1).

Potential causes of the difference in selection response
Our results show that under similar selection regimes,
there are strong limits on the independent evolution of
eyespot color composition that do not exist for eyespot
size. This difference in evolutionary response occurred
despite the fact that both characters exhibited substantial
phenotypic variation in both concerted and antagonistic
directions prior to selection (Fig. 1). Genetic correlations
(measured in the outbred stock population; see Materials
and Methods) across the targeted eyespots for color composition (rG ± SE = 0.68 ± 0.15) and size (rG ± SE = 0.58 ±
0.1) suggest that patterns of genetic covariation were also
similar for both characters. The magnitude and direction
of phenotypic and genetic correlations (and the relationship between the two; [58]) is generally taken to indicate
the degree of limitation on the independent evolution of
two or more characters [27,59-62]. Our experimental
approach involved investigating the realized potential for
independent evolution among repeats of two characters
with similar patterns of standing variation known to differ
in important aspects of their developmental determination. We expected to observe qualitatively similar
responses of color composition and size in all selected
directions if the patterns of covariation alone were the
major internal factors governing the independent evolution of eyespot characters. While we argue that the degree
of compartmentalization of the developmental mechanisms differs between color composition and size, we discuss additional factors that may also explain the observed
evolutionary responses.
Compartmentalization of focal signaling
Our results demonstrate much greater flexibility in the
evolutionary response of eyespot sizes compared with
color composition, despite the fact that both are characteristics of the same serially repeated color pattern elements on the wings of B. anynana. One explanation for
this pattern is that the developmental pathways that regulate production of the focal signal (and determine eyespot
size; [50,51,63]) are much more flexible and more easily
decoupled across a wing surface than the pathways that
regulate the threshold level of response to signal concentrations (and determine eyespot color composition;
[52,53,64,65]). Each eyespot-competent area along the
wing margin produces its own eyespot organizer [51,66].
This process appears to involve independent genetic control of organizer properties; single eyespots can be independently added to or eliminated from forewing or
hindwing surfaces, without affecting the characteristics of
eyespots in adjacent wing cells [67,68]. Eyespots are
deleted from wing surfaces when focal establishment fails
in specific wing cells [67,68], and eyespot-specific allelic
effects are associated with changes in size of individual
eyespots [66]. The wing veins act to further compartmentalize the signaling foci across a wing surface [45]. Com-

ranged from N = 179 to N = 228 (color composition) and from N = 191 to N = 245 (size).

partmentalization (or modular organization; [10]) in the
regulation of initially identical developmental programs
is considered critical to the evolutionary divergence of
serial repeats [69]. Selection acting on heritable, independent variation in developmental regulation can promote evolutionary diversification, even when similarities
in underlying developmental programs contribute to positive covariation among the characters [70].
Wing-wide responses to signal thresholds
In contrast, the observed tight coupling of color composition across eyespots may result from a lack of compartmentalization in the regulation of threshold levels of
response to the concentration gradient of the diffusing
focal signal. Cells in the region surrounding the eyespot
focus exhibit a threshold response to local signal concentration, which induces the expression of regulatory genes
that control pigment synthesis (Fig. 3a–f; [45,52,53]).
Earlier experiments clearly demonstrate that the signaling
and response components of eyespot determination can
be selected independently, and that selection for eyespot
color composition affects only the level of threshold
response [51,53]. In our experiment, concerted selection
for eyespot color composition altered the response properties of the wing epidermis, even in regions of the wing
that do not normally produce an eyespot and were not
directly targeted by selection. The color composition of
ectopic eyespots induced on wings of butterflies from concerted selection lines (Fig. 4) further suggest that the
threshold response is not compartmentalized across comparable regions of a wing surface (spanning at least three

wing cells) where there is clear compartmentalization of
focal signaling [67,68]. If threshold response is regulated
across regions spanning several wing cells (or across an
entire wing surface [71]), variation in the color composition of two eyespots (Fig. 1a) might result from random
perturbations during the development of individual wing
compartments, not from independent heritable variation
in response properties. Although the developmentalgenetic architecture of the processes that regulate eyespot
color composition requires further characterization, we
suggest that the extent to which focal signaling and
response thresholds are compartmentalized is a critical
factor determining the potential for evolutionary change
in the wing color pattern.
Sources of covariation across wing surfaces
Selection targeted pairs of eyespots on two wing surfaces
that differ in both morphology and ecological function.
Eyespots on the dorsal [48] and ventral [47] wing surfaces
are thought to function differently in B. anynana; however, all eyespots are determined by similar spatial and
temporal patterns of gene expression [63,72] regardless of
their location. This shared development appears to play a
primary role in shaping covariation and strongly integrating eyespots among all wing surfaces in Nymphalid butterflies [44,73-76], although functional differentiation of
some wing characters can also affect patterns of covariation [77]. Single- [51,53] and multi-trait selection on eyespot size [55] has demonstrated that the evolutionary
potential of eyespots on all wing surfaces is strongly coupled and differs little among wing surfaces, despite differences in morphology or function. Antagonistic selection
targeting the size of the two dorsal forewing eyespots also
uncoupled individual eyespots on the ventral hindwing.
The relative sizes of ventral hindwing eyespots E4 and E6
(the targets of selection for color composition) differed by
~2 SD in the antagonistic selection lines compared to
unselected controls ([55]; ANOVA for effect of selection
direction: F4,495 = 67.7, P < 0.0001; Tukey's HSD for relative size of eyespots 4 and 6 in 'Large-Small' vs 'SmallLarge' lines: t396 = 8.3, Padj < 0.001). Thus the ability to
decouple eyespot sizes by selection is clearly not limited
to the dorsal forewing. In contrast, across a similar spatial
region of the ventral hindwing (two eyespots separated by
an intervening wing cell), eyespot color composition is
strongly coupled and antagonistic selection cannot produce independent evolutionary changes.
Alternative explanations
We suggest that known differences in the developmental
determination of eyespot color composition and size contribute to qualitative differences in their responses to
antagonistic selection. However, our experiments do not
rule out the possibility that other factors contributed to
these differences. In addition to developmental con-

(brown curve). The threshold concentration of morphogen inducing black pigment formation (black horizontal line) is higher
than the gold-inducing threshold (yellow horizontal line). Size and color composition are the same for both eyespots. In F, eyespot foci on a 'derived' wing surface produce different amounts of the morphogen signal (brown curves) and consequently differ in total size. When the threshold for black pigment production is increased, both eyespots are proportionately 'golder,'
since threshold concentration is a property of the whole wing surface.

straints or biases, factors that may limit the evolution of
character combinations include the effects of past selection, the effects of inbreeding or genetic background, the
action of maternal effects or gene-by-environment interactions, asymmetric gene frequencies or other differences
in patterns of allelic effects, linkage disequilibrium or

physical linkage, and correlation with other fitness-related
characters (reviewed in [78,79]). Regardless of the precise
mechanism, differences in selection response are unlikely
to have been caused by differences in the two experimental populations. Both starting populations were derived
from the same outbred stock population, which was well

Figure 4
Selection for eyespot color composition affects response properties of the wing epidermis
Selection for eyespot color composition affects response properties of the wing epidermis. Ectopic eyespots
(arrows) were produced following damage to a non-focal position on the dorsal forewing 17 hours after pupation. Damage
induces spatio-temporal patterns of gene expression in the surrounding tissue that mimic the response to diffusing focal signals
[94] and results in an ectopic eyespot centered on the damaged site [46], located between the anterior (A) and posterior (P)
eyespots. The color composition of ectopic eyespots was significantly different between 'GG' selected lines (A and B) and 'BB'
selected lines (C and D; ANCOVA for effect of selection direction: F2,138 = 4.25, P < 0.01; Tukey's HSD: 'GG' vs. 'BB,' t138 =
6.7, Padj < 0.0001). The ectopic eyespots reveal evolutionary changes in the response properties of wing epidermal tissue after
concerted selection for color composition. Earlier focal grafting and non-focal damage experiments [51, 53] demonstrate that
selection for eyespot size mainly affects properties of the focal signal and the size of ectopic eyespots does not differ between
lines selected for large and small eyespots [53, 95].
adapted to the laboratory and maintained at high effective
population size [80] before selection began, and both
experiments were conducted under similar environmental
conditions. Consequently, neither differences in allele frequencies between the starting populations, nor in the
interactions between genetic background and environmental conditions across experiments [81] are likely to
explain the qualitative differences in selection response
between the two characters.
Differences in the history (form and/or intensity) of natural selection acting on eyespot color composition and eyespot size is one possible source of differences between the
characters that could influence their responses to antagonistic selection. Selection favoring specific character combinations can build or contribute to phenotypic and
genetic covariation [30,36,37,82] via linkage disequilibrium. This type of covariation is expected to break down
rapidly under antagonistic selection [83], and the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium created by past natural
selection on eyespot size (for combinations of overall
larger or smaller eyespots) may have contributed to the
rapid independent evolution of eyespot sizes under antagonistic selection [57]. Differences in past selection acting
on color composition and size provides one possible
mechanism for differences in the underlying basis of cov-

ariation between the two characters. As comparable patterns of covariation may be reached through many
different developmental or genetic mechanisms [84,85],
this does not exclude our developmental hypothesis.
Our experiment explored whether limits exist on the evolution of particular types of eyespot combinations given
standing variation in a population (Fig. 1a, d). Change in
patterns of allelic interaction or allele frequency from
those currently available in the population could affect
the trait combinations or range of morphologies that can
be reached via selection [34,79,84-86]. It is also possible
that antagonistic selection acted on rare variants for eyespot size that, by chance, were not present for eyespot
color composition in the stock population. Though our
experiment does not rule out effects of several different
underlying mechanisms, our results are consistent with
theory suggesting that the mechanistic basis of character
covariation is a more important predictor of evolutionary
change than the correlation estimates alone [5,32,84,85].
Because developmental interactions both shape patterns
of phenotypic and genetic covariation among characters
and evolve in response to selection acting on those characters [9,87], genetic architecture, developmental mechanisms, and population-genetic processes interact in
complex ways [88]. Understanding how these factors

interact to shape the evolution of complex traits, such as
butterfly wing patterns, requires further detailed dissection of underlying mechanisms.
Diversification within the lineage
Phylogenetic patterns of morphological diversity are generally consistent with the idea that development limits the
ability of species to occupy phenotype space (reviewed in
[21]). In B. anynana, despite similar patterns of standing
variation for eyespot color composition and size in the
base population, responses to artificial antagonistic selection show that these two characteristics of the eyespot pattern do not evolve in the same way under similar
antagonistic selection regimes. Moreover, these differences, found within a single B. anynana population, are
consistent with wing pattern diversity across the genus
(Fig. 3g–k; see also [89]). Among Bicyclus species, eyespot
color composition seems to have evolved along a line of
'least resistance' [27,28] parallel to the main axis of variation in B. anynana. In contrast, eyespot size has explored a
larger area of potential phenotype space along the 'uncoupling' axis [90].

Conclusion
A number of studies suggest that natural selection plays a
dominant role in morphological evolution and the distribution
of
lineages
in
phenotype
space
[29,30,36,39,57,91]. However, a growing body of evidence shows that developmental mechanisms and individual components of developmental gene networks can
differ in their effects on phenotypic variation [19,20,54],
and presumably, bias or limit adaptive morphological
evolution. Here we compared two characters that show
similar patterns of standing variation in a population, but
differ in an important aspect of their developmental determination. These characters evolve differently under artificial antagonistic selection, in a manner consistent with
the developmental differences between them, though we
cannot rule out the effects of other internal factors or processes besides, or in addition to, development. Butterfly
color patterns and other complex forms we see in nature
result from novel combinations of their individual elements. We suggest that compartmentalized development
enables the production of novel phenotypes when selection favors independent changes in these elements. Under
similar selection, developmental mechanisms that are less
compartmentalized may limit the range of likely evolutionary outcomes.

Methods
Selected traits
In Bicyclus anynana, two eyespots are present on the dorsal
forewing (anterior, A, and posterior, P) and seven on the
ventral hindwing (eyespots E1–E7). In separate experiments, we selected for the relative size (the ratio of total

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/94

eyespot diameter divided by the distance between the
centers of A and P; [57]) or the color composition (the
size of the black color ring relative to total eyespot diameter) of two eyespots simultaneously. Selection for eyespot size targeted the two dorsal forewing eyespots [57].
The results of size selection showed that selection to
uncouple A and P also uncoupled the relative sizes of
anterior and posterior groups of ventral hindwing eyespots, and that the division between the two groups of
ventral hindwing eyespots lay between E4 and E6 [55].
Thus, we chose to select on the color composition of E4
and E6 because: 1) the size experiment showed that these
two eyespots could be decoupled, even when they were
targeted only indirectly by selection (see Results and Discussion); and 2) color composition is a function of total
eyespot diameter, so it was necessary to choose two eyespots of initially similar size and color composition
before selection.
The starting population for each experiment was derived
from an outbred stock maintained in the laboratory for >
100 generations at high Ne [80]. For each trait we established three types of lines from the stock population: 1)
antagonistic selection lines where two eyespots were
selected in opposite direction (large A and small P, 'LargeSmall,' or the opposite combination 'Small-Large'; E4
gold and E6 black, 'Gold-Black,' or the opposite combination 'Black-Gold'); 2) concerted selection lines where two
eyespots were selected in the same direction ('Gold-Gold,'
or 'Black-Black'; 'Large-Large,' or 'Small-Small'); and 3)
unselected control (UC) lines.
To estimate eyespot color composition, total diameter
and the diameter of the inner black disc of E4 and E6 were
measured in the proximal-distal axis, along the midline of
each eyespot (parallel to the wing veins). Color composition of an eyespot was estimated from the orthogonal
(Type II) regression of black disc diameter on total eyespot
diameter. In this analysis, positive and negative residuals
indicate relatively black and relatively gold eyespots,
respectively. To identify individuals for selection, we performed an additional orthogonal regression of E4 color
composition on E6 color composition (from the previous
regression). The regression line is similar to the axis of the
first principal component. For concerted selection, we
ranked the residuals parallel to the regression line (similar
to individual loadings on the first principal component);
extreme positive or negative residuals indicated that both
eyespots were relatively black or relatively gold, respectively. For antagonistic selection, we ranked the residuals
perpendicular to the regression line (similar to individual
loadings on the second, orthogonal, principal component
axis); extreme positive residuals indicated individuals
where E4 was relatively black compared to E6, and
extreme negative residuals indicated individuals where E6

was relatively black compared to E4. Selection for eyespot
size was made on the basis of the additive combination of
the ranks for each individual eyespot as explained in [44].
There were two replicates of each selection and each UC
line, with one additional UC replicate in the size experiment. To estimate correlations between eyespot characters
in the base population, we calculated Pearson productmoment correlations between the target eyespots in the
starting population for each experiment.

[46,53]. To determine the effect of selection for eyespot
color composition on this threshold response, we damaged the pupal wings of females in each of the BlackBlack, Gold-Gold, and UC lines and measured the color
composition of the resulting ectopic eyespots. The experiment was conducted during generation 14 (lines were
maintained under random mating conditions after generation 10, with 40 females and 55 males selected at random and ~250 offspring reared per line per generation).

Selection procedure
Female butterflies were selected for 10 generations. For
the color composition experiment, 1056 females were
measured and randomly split into two groups and 40
females were randomly drawn from each group to establish the UC lines. Within each group, the remaining
females were ranked and the 40 females with the most
extreme phenotypes in each direction were selected, so
that each selection line was replicated twice in total. For
the size experiment, 2254 females were measured and
randomly split into two groups after 40 females were
drawn to establish the first UC line [44]. All selected
females were placed with ~50 randomly chosen males and
allowed to lay eggs. Rearing conditions for the stock population and selected lines have been described previously
[51]. We maintained similar selection intensities in both
experiments for generations 1–10: each line, per generation, we measured 140–240 females for color composition (mean ± SE: 209 ± 5) and 15–200 females for size
(mean ± SE: 173 ± 3). We selected 40 females per line
every generation in the color experiment; in the size experiment the number decreased to 35 females between generations 5–10 [44].

To reduce the size of native eyespots (A and P) on the dorsal forewing and increase visibility of the induced ectopic,
we first pierced the foci of the anterior and posterior eyespots on the left dorsal forewing of each individual 4.5
hours after pupation with a finely sharpened tungsten
needle [46]. We then induced ectopic eyespots by piercing
each of the left forewings at a site in the fourth wing cell
(immediately distal to the normal location of the eyespots) 17 hours after pupation. We returned operated
pupae to 27°C, froze newly emerged adults (after their
wings had fully hardened), and measured the total diameter and inner black diameter of ectopic eyespots and the
interpupil distance between the reduced A and P eyespots
on each manipulated (left) wing. We also measured the
total diameter and black disc diameter of P on the right
dorsal forewing, and the interpupil distance on this
unmanipulated (right) wing.

Selection response
Each generation, trait values for each replicate line were
calculated relative to their respective UC lines. A leastsquares regression of selection response on cumulative
selection differential was used to estimate the rate of
response to selection for each replicate. We used nested
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test for differences in
the rate of response between selection directions, with
'cumulative selection differential' as the covariate and
'replicate within direction' as a random effect. Tukey's
multiple comparisons were used to compare responses of
individual replicates when there was a significant interaction between the two main factors in the nested ANCOVA.
Analyses were conducted using PROC GLM in SAS version
6.12 (SAS Institute, 1996).
Induction of ectopic eyespots
Damage to pupal wings in the first 18 hours after pupation induces formation of ectopic eyespots on the dorsal
forewing [46] and can be used to assay the threshold
response of wing tissue to eyespot-inducing signals

We used ANCOVA to test for differences in color composition of ectopic eyespots among Black-Black, Gold-Gold,
and UC lines. With 'total ectopic diameter' as the covariate, we examined the fixed effect of 'selection direction
(control, black, or gold)' and the random effect of 'replicate line nested within direction' on the size of the ectopic
black disc. None of the interaction terms (selection direction by covariate and random effect by covariate) were significant and we used Tukey's HSD to test for differences in
the adjusted means between Black-Black, Gold-Gold, and
UC lines.
Estimates of genetic covariation in the stock population
We used a paternal half-sib breeding design [92] to estimate quantitative genetic parameters in our outbred stock
population. We randomly selected 100 virgin males from
the stock population at adult eclosion; each male was
mated sequentially to 2 virgin females. At hatching, ~30
eggs per female were transferred to mesh rearing cages and
fed on young maize plants ad libitum until pupation.
Full-sib offspring were reared together but densities were
kept low to minimize interaction and competition
between individuals. Rearing cages were moved every 4
days to randomize environmental effects within the
growth chamber. Emerging adult offspring were allowed
several hours for their wings to expand and fully harden
before being frozen for later analysis.

Five female offspring were randomly selected from each of
174 full-sib families (representing 87 sires who successfully produced offspring by two dams each) and dorsal
forewing eyespots A and P, and ventral hindwing eyespots
E4 and E6 were measured as described above. We used our
nested breeding design (full-sib dam families nested
within sire families) to estimate sire, dam, and progeny
variance and covariance components in SAS 6.12. Genetic
correlations between eyespot pairs (and their standard
errors) were calculated according to [93]; to eliminate
potential inflation of the estimates by maternal effects,
genetic correlations were calculated from the among-sire
variance components only [92].
