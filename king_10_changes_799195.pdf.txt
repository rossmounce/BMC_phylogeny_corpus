Abstract
Background: Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of human whooping cough (pertussis) and is particularly
severe in infants. Despite worldwide vaccinations, whooping cough remains a public health problem. A significant
increase in the incidence of whooping cough has been observed in many countries since the 1990s. Several
reasons for the re-emergence of this highly contagious disease have been suggested. A particularly intriguing
possibility is based on evidence indicating that pathogen adaptation may play a role in this process. In an attempt
to gain insight into the genomic make-up of B. pertussis over the last 60 years, we used an oligonucleotide DNA
microarray to compare the genomic contents of a collection of 171 strains of B. pertussis isolates from different
countries.
Results: The CGH microarray analysis estimated the core genome of B. pertussis, to consist of 3,281 CDSs that are
conserved among all B. pertussis strains, and represent 84.8% of all CDSs found in the 171 B. pertussis strains. A total
of 64 regions of difference consisting of one or more contiguous CDSs were identified among the variable genes.
CGH data also revealed that the genome size of B. pertussis strains is decreasing progressively over the past 60
years. Phylogenetic analysis of microarray data generated a minimum spanning tree that depicted the
phylogenetic structure of the strains. B. pertussis strains with the same gene content were found in several different
countries. However, geographic specificity of the B. pertussis strains was not observed. The gene content was
determined to highly correlate with the ptxP-type of the strains.
Conclusions: An overview of genomic contents of a large collection of isolates from different countries allowed us
to derive a core genome and a phylogenetic structure of B. pertussis. Our results show that B. pertussis is a dynamic
organism that continues to evolve.

Background
Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of whooping
cough, a highly contagious disease of the respiratory
tract in humans. B. pertussis and the closely related B.
parapertussis have diverged independently by genome
decay of a B. bronchiseptica-like ancestor [1,2]. The
three species have much in common, including a high
degree of sequence similarity in shared genes. However,

they differ in several respects such as severity of disease
and host range specificity [3-6].
Extensive immunization of children reduced the incidence of serious disease and mortality caused by B. pertussis [7]. However, globally, pertussis remains a leading
cause of vaccine preventable hospitalizations and deaths
in children [8,9]. In the last decade, a resurgence of pertussis, especially among adolescents and adults, has been
observed in many industrialized countries with a high
vaccination coverage [10-12]. Numerous studies have
demonstrated that the B. pertussis population has changed since the 1950s. Waning immunity, in combination

with pathogen adaptation, may have contributed to the
continued circulation of B. pertussis strains [13-18].
In most industrialized countries, generalized vaccination with a whole cell pertussis vaccine (WCV) began
between 1950 and 1960. However, in the late 1970s,
concerns over vaccination side effects led to changes in
the vaccine composition, vaccine uptake, or temporary
exclusion of pertussis whole cell immunization in some
countries [19,20]. In order to tackle this problem, the
development of an acellullar pertussis vaccine (ACV)
exhibiting fewer side effects started in the 1980s. Immunization schedules and the type of vaccine used began
to differ in each country, leading to disparities in pertussis vaccination histories. In the Netherlands, pertussis
vaccination, using a WCV produced by the Netherlands
Vaccine Institute, was introduced in 1953. From 1975 to
1985 a lower vaccine dose was used, which most likely
lead to an increase in the incidence of pertussis between
1985 to 1987 [21]. After restoring the vaccine to the
normal dose, a lower incidence of pertussis was noted
until 1996. However, since 1996, the pertussis incidence
has increased. Furthermore, pertussis epidemics have
been frequently observed every 3-5 years. In 2005, the
Netherlands ceased using WCVs and switched to using
an ACV for primary and booster vaccinations. In Sweden, a WCV was used from 1953 until 1978. From 1979
to 1996, pertussis vaccinations were not administered.
Since 1996, ACVs are used for pertussis vaccination in
Sweden [22,23]. The Japanese population received the
WCV from 1949 until 1981, at which time an ACV was
introduced [24,25]. In Australia, a WCV had been used
until 1997. However, in the late 1970’s, the vaccine was
not administered as frequently due to the population’s
decrease in confidence of the vaccine. Since 1999, and
continuing until today, an ACV is used [26]. Senegal
began large scale pertussis vaccinations with a WCV in
the late 1980s, but the vaccination coverage was low
[27]. The pertussis vaccination coverage in Kenya has
also been relatively low [28,29].
A large number of techniques have been used to type
B. pertussis. Commonly used methods are pulsed field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE), Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Multiple-Locus Variable number of
Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA) [23,30-37]. These
methods have generally been effective for grouping
strains of B. pertussis. However, some of these methods
are very laborious, or have little discriminatory potential
to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of the strains.
Microarray technology, combined with mathematical
analysis to determine phylogeny, has provided a sensitive and robust method to examine the genetic relatedness of bacterial populations [38-41]. Comparative
genomic hybridizations (CGH) using genome-wide DNA
microarrays have proven useful in studies of intraspecies

Page 2 of 15

diversity for a number of bacterial species [39]. Also,
several microarray-platforms have been applied to specifically address questions related to the genome of B. pertussis [1,42-45]. In a previous study, we have used
microarray-based CGH to determine the genomic characteristics of the B. pertussis strain involved in the
Dutch 1996-2004 epidemic [45].
In this study, we sought to analyze the changes of the
B. pertussis population in the Netherlands and five other
countries, with different vaccination histories between
1949 and 2008. To this end, we determined the gene
content of B. pertussis strains by using microarray-based
CGH. The overview of gene content in a large collection
of global isolates obtained from the CGH data enabled
us to define the core genome of the B. pertussis species,
and to construct a phylogenetic structure of B. pertussis.
Furthermore, it gives us a better understanding of the
dynamics of the B. pertussis strains circulating in the
immunized population. Insight into the polymorphism
of B. pertussis and its capacity to adapt to population
immunity is important in the understanding of pertussis
epidemiology.

Results
Strain collection

In this study, we analyzed 171 B. pertussis isolates by
microarray-based CGH in order to investigate the
dynamics of B. pertussis gene content, and possibly
reveal temporal and geographic differences. We used a
collection of 171 strains from six different countries (the
Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, Kenya, Senegal and
Japan) isolated between 1949-2008. The collection was
divided into several time periods, chosen around significant events in the pertussis vaccination history of a particular country (Table 1). No strains were available in
the post ACV period in Australia or from the vaccine
free period in Senegal. The majority of the strains are
isolated from the Netherlands; these strains should
represent a sufficient number of B. pertussis populations
in the Netherlands. We selected all strains based on frequency dependent selection using MLST type or PFGE
type to avoid a selection bias. The Dutch strains of B.
pertussis were typed in previous studies for MLST [45]
[Mooi, unpublished results], while the Swedish strains
were typed by PFGE [46]. The strains that were not
typed in previous studies were typed in this study (not
shown).
Microarray

We used two different microarrays to analyze the gene
content of the B. pertussis strains. Forty-two percent of
the strains were analyzed by a previously validated B.
pertussis oligonucleotide microarray based on the
Tohama I genome [45], while the remaining 58% of the

strains were analyzed by a new extended oligonucleotide
microarray based on the B. pertussis sequences supplemented with the additional CDSs from B. parapertussis
and B. bronchiseptica [47]. Nine (5%) strains were analyzed using both microarrays. In total, 3,751 probes
were included in the B. pertussis microarray and 5,910
probes were used in the extended Bordetella microarray
(Additional file 1, Table S1a and Additional file 2, Table
S1b). The efficacy of the extended Bordetella microarray
was assessed in this study by the control hybridizations
of reference DNA (genomic DNA from ATCC BAA-589
Tohama I) vs. reference DNA. The reference strain
ATCC BAA-589 Tohama I did not hybridize to all
probes on the microarray, since the array contains
probes that are not present in this strain. The majority
of the genes (99.83%) in this strain were predicted to be
present/conserved (data not shown). The nine strains
tested on both microarrays gave similar predictions
regarding the absence/divergence and presence/convergence of the genes that were observed in both microarrays. We confirmed the absence of the genes predicted
to be absent/divergent by targeted PCR assays (see
Materials & Methods).
Gene content, core genome and variable genes

We have applied microarray-based CGH to 171 B. pertussis strains in order to predict the gene content for
these strains (Additional file 3, Table S2). In order to
gain insight into which genes found previously in Bp/
Bpp and Bb are present in the Bp species, we counted
all of the different CDSs found in the 171 analyzed

strains. The total number of CDSs predicted to be present in the isolates was 3,871, (i.e. the pan-B. pertussis
genome consists of 3,871 genes). However, the fully
sequenced and annotated B. pertussis strain (Tohama I)
was determined to have 3,816 CDSs, a difference of 55
CDSs. These extra genes are clustered in eight regions
of difference (RDs) (Table 2). Five of these RDs had previously been found in B. pertussis strains [48]. Here, 12
new extra genes, forming three RDs, were identified in
B. pertussis strains; BPP0474/BB0474, BPP0511-12/
BB0516-17 and BPP2338-47/BB1789-98 are also present
in B. parapertussis strain 12822 and B. bronchiseptica
strain RB50. Since the genes that are not present in the
Tohama I genome were not observed in the B. pertussis
microarray, all of the strains analyzed with this array
were also screened by PCR for the eight RDs. In 99% of
the strains, the genes BPP0529-36, BPP0931-50,
BPP4293-4301 and BPP0474 were present (Table 2).
BPP0822-24 and BPP0825-27 were present in 85% or
86% of all strains tested, respectively. The genes
BPP2338-47 and BPP0511-12 were found in only 6% of
the B. pertussis strains (Table 2).
Of the 3,871 genes of the B. pertussis pan-genome,
513 genes (13.3%) were detected as absent/divergent in
one or more of the tested isolates, and were considered
variable genes (Additional file 4, Table S3). The variable
(non-core) genes formed a total of 64 RDs (Additional
file 5, Table S4), each of them consisting of one or
more contiguous CDSs. Sixty-seven percent of the 64
RDs were confirmed to be absent by targeted PCR
assays or were also described by others (see Materials &

genes involved in transport and binding, hypothetical
genes and those encoding unclassified functions are overrepresented in the variable genes by 11%, 19% and 25%,
respectively. Core genes are overrepresented in the genes
involved in energy metabolism and most of the genes
involved in macromolecule metabolism (Figure 3). Variable genes are enriched for pseudo genes, since we found
that 12.5% of the missing genes are pseudo genes, while
9.6% of the Tohama I genes are pseudo genes.

Methods) [42,44]. Our results demonstrated that most
variable genes were present in more than 80% of the
analyzed strains, and only 43 of the non-core genes
were absent frequently and present in less than 20% of
the strains (Figure 1). These genes are BP0910-34,
BP1135-41, BPP0511-12, and BPP2339-47. Besides the
variable genes found in this study, previous studies have
suggested that 76 additional genes are missing in at
least one strain [42,44] (Additional file 6, Table S5).
Based on our studies and reports by others, a total of
589 variable genes have been described for B. pertussis.
Thus, 15.2% of the pan-genome is variable, while 3,282
genes (84.8% from pan-genome) are shared among all
analyzed strains, and form the core genome of B. pertussis (Additional file 7, Table S6). The distribution of core
and variable genes in the B. pertussis Tohama I genome
is illustrated in Figure 2 (see also Additional file 8).
Identification of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG)
enriched for variable genes

The proportions of the variable genes with respect to their
functional category are shown in Figure 3. Genes involved
in housekeeping functions (2,185 in total), such as small
molecule metabolism and macromolecule metabolism,
were found to be relatively conserved; variable genes
accounted for only 8%. In contrast, the variable genes
accounted for 16% of the total genes in the other 8 categories (i.e. transport and binding proteins, regulatory functions, cellular processes, mobile and extra chromosomal
element functions, hypothetical proteins, signal transduction, unclassified and unknown function). In particular,

Lineage relationships revealed by phylogenetic analysis

Next, we investigated the geographic and temporal differences in B. pertussis strains analyzed in this study. In
order to be able to perform cluster analysis on the CGH
data, RDs were categorized as either present (1), or
absent (0) in each strain (Additional file 3, Table S2). In
order to evaluate the relationships among B. pertussis
strains, we performed a clustering analysis on the binary
CGH data by the unweighted-pair group method using
average linkages (UPGMA). This analysis generated a
similarity matrix, as well as a UPGMA tree. Based on
the similarity matrix, a minimum spanning tree was
constructed to give a phylogenetic structure of 148
strains (Figure 4A and 4B). Based on the minimum
spanning tree, 148 strains formed 40 different gene content types (GC-types) that were assigned into one large
complex and two very small complexes.
We compared the frequencies of GC-types in three
periods: 1949-1964, 1965-1992 and 1993-2008 (Table 3)
(Figure 5). The most common GC-types are GC-type 1
(25% of the strains) and GC-type 2 (23% of the strains).
The remaining GC-types found at frequencies lower
than 8% were pooled together. Almost all (84%) of the
strains analyzed from the first period were Dutch
strains, because only a few strains from this period were
available. In the 1st period a dominant GC-type was not
found, while 11 different GC-types were detected at a
frequency of 5-11%. In the 2nd period, strains carrying
GC-type 1 increased in frequency to 41%, however, the
frequency of these strains decreased again to 19% in the
3rd period. Strains of GC-type 2 were detected at a frequency of only 5% in the 2nd period, but were predominant (43%) in the 3rd period. The differences observed

in GC-type frequencies of different countries may be
influenced by many factors, such as differences in vaccine history or other geographic factors. Nevertheless,
we observed that strains carrying the same, or similar,
gene content were found in different countries within
the same time-period, and have seen no clear geographic specificity of the B. pertussis strains. For example, strains with the GC-type 1 and GC-type 2 were
found in 4 and 3 different countries, respectively. Due

to differences in vaccine history, specific lineages can
arise in a country. For example, in the Netherlands, we
observed an increase in strains with GC-type 4, which
was the result of a change in the vaccine dose, and ultimately led to the 1980s pertussis epidemic. However,
strains with this gene content were not found in other
countries.
In order to determine if the gene content was linked
to specific alleles, we combined the gene content data

with the MLST (PtxP-Fim3-Prnregion1) data. The gene
content of B. pertussis strains was found to correlate
highly with the ptxP type of the analyzed strains (Figure
4B). Moreover, clustering based on MLST-type (PtxPFim3-Prnregion1) data resulted in a similar structure
(Figure 4C) compared to clustering based on GC-type
data (Figure 4B). In our previous study, we found that
all Dutch strains carrying the ptxP3 allele were characterized by the absence of the BP1948-66 gene cluster
[45]. Here, we confirm the association of the ptxP3
allele with the absence of these genes also found in
strains isolated from Sweden, Australia and Japan (n
total= 39). Figure 6 shows the average gene content of
all analyzed strains analyzed (n = 171) and is organized
by ptxP type. The ptxP3 strains also miss BP0910-34
and BP1135-41, BPP2338-47 and BPP0511-2 besides the
already mentioned RD: BP1948-66 (Figure 6). Furthermore, we also found that ptxP2 strains (n = 9) are characterized by the absence of BP0593, BP2627-9, BP310410, BP3314-22, and BPP0474 (Figure 6). ptxP6 (n = 9)
strains are characterized by the presence of all RDs
except for, BPP0822-4, BPP0825-7, BPP2338-47 and
BPP0511-2 (Figure 6). Finally, the ptxP1 strains (n = 91)

miss BPP2338-47 and BPP0511-2, as well as BP0910-34
and BP1135-41 in most of the ptxP1 strains. The ptxP1
strains are more diverse in gene content as several
lineages were identified. A lineage of ptxP1 strains
expanded in the 1980’s is characterized by the absence
of BP1698 and BP2167-80 (Figure 4B). A second ptxP1
clone was detected in the Netherlands after the year
2000, and is characterized by the absence of BPP0822-4
and BPP0825-7. A single strain isolated from the Netherlands in the year 2008 carries the ptxP13 allele and
also has the same gene content (Figure 4B).
Estimation of genome size

We calculated an approximate genome size for each
strain based on the CGH data. The total number of
genes per genome varied between 3,851 and 3,684
genes. The genome size of the B. pertussis Tohama I
strain (4,086,186 bp) [47] was used as the starting point.
We added the gene size for additional genes and subtracted the gene size for genes scored as being absent in
a particular strain. Since microarrays can only detect
genes present on the microarray, we estimated the genome size of these strains based on the absence/presence

of the 3,871 genes of the B. pertussis pan-genome only.
Figure 7 shows the estimated genome sizes for all 171
strains organized by isolation date. Remarkably, the genome size of B. pertussis strains appears to be significantly decreasing progressively (P < 0.001). A decrease
in genome size, over time, was observed in strains isolated from the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan and Australia. However, we could not detect a decrease in genome
size of Kenya and Senegal strains since strains from different isolation dates were not available. Strains with the
same estimated genome size were found in different
countries. These strains carried the same gene content
(GC type), but different MLST types (Additional file 3,
Table S2) which suggested that they did not simply arise
from clonal expansion. Two major outliers exhibiting a
smaller genome were also found in the Netherlands.
The largest genome size is estimated to be 4,124,398
bp (strains B0558 and B0572 isolated respectively in
1949 and 1952) and the smallest is 3,937,304 bp (strain
B0295 isolated in 1978). The maximum size difference
is 187,094 bp. The core genome (3,282 genes) is theoretically the smallest genome with which B. pertussis can
survive. Based on the size of the present genes, the size
of the core genome is estimated to be 3,485,846 bp.

Discussion
The main purpose of the present study was to analyze
the changes in gene content of the B. pertussis population in the Netherlands and five other countries between
1949 and 2008. This analysis was conducted using
microarray-based CGH methods in order to gain insight
into the dynamics of the B. pertussis population. Microarray-based CGH has been widely used to assess the
genome variability among bacterial species or closely
related bacteria. Given that sequencing of strains on a
large scale is still time-consuming and laborious, CGH
may resolve the problem to some extent by applying the
available genome sequence information. This method
can supply additional information about the genome
composition and also provide the opportunity to analyze
many more unsequenced strains on a genomic scale.
Even though this technique has several limitations, we
believe that the use of CGH technology, combined with
confirmatory PCRs, allows sufficient assessment of the
genetic diversity and gene content among B. pertussis
strains. The high-throughput capability of microarrays
enabled us to analyze more than 170 strains. One limitation of microarray-based analysis is that the detection of
elements is limited to the presence of a gene in the

microarray. In these studies, we used a microarray that
is based on the sequence of the Tohama I B. pertussis
strain, as well as all of the extra genes found in Bpp
strain 12822 and Bb strain RB50. The Tohama I strain
was shown not to be a good representative for B. pertussis strains [49]. Full genome DNA sequencing of three
other B. pertussis strains by Bouchez et al [48] showed
that not all of the novel genes were found in the
Tohama I strain, but originated from the Bpp or Bb

species. Since B. pertussis does not appear to acquire
any new genetic material [1,42,49], we expect that if
novel genes are present in the B. pertussis strains analyzed in these studies,they are likely to originate from
Bpp or Bb species. By using a Bordetella pan-microarray, most of the genes present in the B. pertussis strains
will be covered. Future DNA sequencing of additional B.
pertussis strains will demonstrate if this assumption is
justified. In this study, indeed the analysis of 171 B.

pertussis strains identified the presence of 12 new genes
in the B. pertussis species, which originate from the B.
parapertussis/B. bronchiseptica species.
CGH analysis for a large series B. pertussis strains, isolated in six different countries, has resulted in an estimate of the core genome composition of B. pertussis.
This analysis has also suggested the degree and nature
of the genome flexibility between strains. A total of
3,282 genes were identified as belonging to the core
genome. These genes were found in every strain analyzed until present time (this study and [42-45]), and
appear to be essential to the lifestyle of this bacterium.
The accessory (variably present) portion (589 genes) of
the B. pertussis genome corresponds to about 15% of
the pan-B. pertussis genome. Genes lost, assumed to not
to be essential for B. pertussis survival in the human
host, are enriched for genes involved in transport and
binding, hypothetical genes and genes encoding unclassified functions. Accessory genes were confined to certain regions (RDs) in the chromosome, mostly flanked
to an IS element (ISE) on at least one side of the RD.
The IS 481 element, which is abundantly present (238
times) in the B. pertussis genome of the Tohama I
strain, may be involved in the process of gene loss by
facilitating homologue recombination between these
perfect repeats within the genome. Previous studies have
shown that repeats can be promoters of gene deletion
[50,51], or can also result in large scale chromosomal
rearrangements leading to disruption of the ancestral
gene order [1].
Three main forces have been found to shape genome
evolution; gene gain, gene loss and gene change [52].
Gene loss seems to be an important event in the genomic evolution of the B. pertussis species. B. pertussis
evolved from a B. bronchiseptica-likeancestor probably
by large scale gene loss [47]. Much of this loss is most
likely due to ISE-mediated deletion events and/or ISE
mediated rearrangements, which reshaped the genome
presumably to benefit from increased virulence expression. In evolution from B. bronchiseptica to B. pertussis
the genes that are lost or inactivated are generally those
involved in membrane transport, small molecule metabolism, regulation of gene expression and synthesis of
surface structures [47]. It seems that gene loss began
during the evolution from B. bronchiseptica, and is continuing during the evolution of B. pertussis. This conclusion is supported by the results presented in this study
that illustrate a progressive decrease in the genome size
over time in strains isolated in different countries.
Moreover, the genes that were lost exhibited similar
functions as the genes lost in the evolution from B.
bronchiseptica to B. pertussis (see above). Gene loss in
B. pertussis has been previously reported for Finnish
[44] and French B. pertussis strains [48]. However, to

Page 10 of 15

our knowledge, such a rapid decline in gene loss during
a period of 60 years has not yet been described. The
loss of genetic material is a dynamic, ongoing process
that is not specific for one country, but observed in several areas of the world. In other examples of bacteria
gene loss, the process has been described as a progressive purging of unnecessary genes from the genome
[53]. Bacteria appear to prefer gene deletions, which
could account for a general drive to lose DNA. It is generally assumed, that the bacterial deletion which offers
the least negative fitness effect on the host will be
selected. However, gene loss can lead to benefits for the
pathogen as well, because some gene products are detrimental to pathogenic lifestyle. For example, loss of the
cadA gene from the Shigella bacterium has been correlated with an increase of Shigella pathogenicity [54].
Additionally, the preferential loss of bacterial cell surface
determinants has been shown to result in an increase in
virulence by reducing the number of targets that could
be recognized by the human immune system [55].
An intriguing question is what other factors influence
the size and content of bacterial genomes? The introduction of vaccination against pertussis has been associated with changes in the B. pertussis population
[12,36]. Thus, we investigated whether pertussis vaccination, during several decades, could influence the size
and genomic content of the B. pertussis population.
Therefore, B. pertussis strains from countries with different pertussis vaccination histories were analyzed. Our
collection of B. pertussis isolates were divided into time
periods of significant events that were observed in the
epidemiology of pertussis. In order to gain more insight
into how the B. pertussis strains are related, we used the
genomic content overview of the B. pertussis isolates to
construct a phylogenetic structure. Recently, this
method was also used, in a similar manner, to decipher
the microevolution of V. parahaemolyticus [40].
Clustering based on genomic content showed that B.
pertussis strains isolated in different countries are mostly
similar and did not reveal a particular geographic region
of a specific strain. However, an analysis of the gene
content of B. pertussis strains over time demonstrated a
gradual change in gene content over a period of 60
years (Figure 5 and Table 3). In the Netherlands, strains
that were found approximately 60 years ago cannot
usually be isolated today. In the last 15 years, strains
with a different gene content (GC-type 2) have emerged
in several countries. The increase of these strains has
most likely caused or influenced the resurgence of pertussis in many countries in the last decade [10-12]. In
general, strains have changed in the Netherlands, Sweden and Japan, somewhat irrespective of any difference
in vaccination history. It is remarkable that the gene
content of strains isolated during certain timeframes is

King et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:64
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/64

similar for all countries, even in the countries with low
vaccination coverage. These results suggest that the differences in vaccination history have little or no influence
in this process.
On the other hand, in the Dutch B. pertussis population we have seen changes that seem to be influenced
by alterations in herd immunity. For example, GC-types
31-36 strains, similar to the vaccine 509-strain, appear
to be completely removed from the population following
the commencement of vaccination. In contrast, strains
with similar gene content to the other vaccine strain
134 (e.g. GC-type 1), have persisted until at least 2008.
Additionally, shortly after a change in the vaccine dose
in the Netherlands, we have detected the expansion of a
clone of B. pertussis strains, characterized by the
absence of BP1698 and BP2167-80, and identified as
GC-types 4 and 9. This clone, also characterized by
MLVA types 130, 132, 134 and 137 [21] was able to
expand between 1978 and 1988, leading to a pertussis
epidemic between 1983 and 1988. However, this clone
disappeared again following restoration of the vaccine
dose to the original level. Herd immunity was possibly
lost because of a decline in vaccine-derived immunity,
which was a result of a change in the vaccine composition. This deviation appears to have selected for a
change in the composition of circulating B. pertussis
strains. In 2007-2008, we found the expansion of
another clone of B. pertussis strains with an additional
deletion (e.g. BPP0822-27). It is not yet known what factor induced the expansion of these strains, although the
introduction of the ACV in 2005 in the Netherlands
may be involved. However, we detected a single strain
with the same gene content for the first time in 1996. In
Sweden, where vaccination was ceased for a longer period, we did not see the rise of new B. pertussis clones
that were involved in epidemics. This may possibly be
due to the low number of isolates tested. During the last
15 years, the expansion of B. pertussis strains in multiple
countries that carry the ptxP3 allele [18,45], may also
have been influenced by intensive pertussis vaccination
for half a century. Since pertussis has shifted to older
age groups [11,56] in immunized populations during the
last decade, it has been suggested that B. pertussis has
adapted to the host population with waning immunity,
in order to maintain the bacterial reservoir among older
hosts [18,57]. Mooi et al [18] proposed that strains surviving better in these hosts are being selected for by vaccination of young infants. Recently, it was shown that
the rise of strains carrying the ptxP3 allele, which are
also characterized by a particular gene content [45]
(GC-types 2, and its derivatives) and seem to have a
benefit in older hosts, has contributed to the resurgence
of pertussis in the Netherlands [18]. Thus, the size and
gene content of the B. pertussis genome appear to be

Page 11 of 15

influenced by vaccination by herd immunity. Immune
pressure may select for certain strains with a particular
advantage, and which may be linked to specific gene
content. The fact that we see the same or similar strains
in different countries during certain time periods suggests that an important advantage for these strains may
be their capability to spread throughout the immunized
population. Importantly, strains with the same GC-type
were found to possess different MLST types, which suggest that they are not a single clone.
In our previous study we found that all Dutch strains
carrying the ptxP3 allele were characterized by the
absence of the BP1948-66 gene cluster [45]. In this
study, we confirmed the similarity of the gene content
of strains carrying the ptxP3 allele in strains isolated in
different countries. Moreover, we found that the ptxP
allele is a good marker for strains that have similar gene
content, since also the ptxP2 and ptxP6 strains are associated with the absence or presence of specific gene
clusters (Figure 6). This indicates that strains with different ptxP types have different genetic backgrounds
and form different lineages. Thus, these strains do not
differ only in one point mutation, and therefore specific
properties of these strains can also be related to this
typical gene content. The ptxP1 strains are the most
diverse in gene content although most gene clusters are
typically lost in one strain or a specific group of strains.
The ptxP1 strains missing BP0910-33, BP1135-41,
BPP0511-2 and BPP2338-47 has the most single locus
and double locus variants indicating that this is the
older type. Strains with these characteristics are found
in at least five different countries. The minimum spanning tree clearly showed that the ptxP3 clone emerged
from the ptxP1 strain.

Conclusions
In conclusion, an overview of genomic contents of a
large collection of isolates from different countries
allowed us to derive a core genome of B. pertussis. Clustering based on CGH analysis showed that strains isolated in different countries are highly similar in gene
content. Furthermore, strains with the same ptxP type,
exhibit great similarity in gene content suggesting that
they form distinct lineages. Additionally, the CGH data
revealed that the genome size of B. pertussis strains has
decreased progressively over a period of 60 years. Our
results show that B. pertussis is dynamic and is continuously evolving. This process seems to be influenced by
adaptive evolution. Seemingly, there is selection for certain strains with smaller genomes. Although other factors may also influence the selection for these strains,
these strains might benefit in the host with waning
immunity by having lower cost of energy, with little
negative effect on the host, or by removing gene

King et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:64

products that are detrimental to the pathogenic lifestyle
in older hosts.

Methods
Strains

B. pertussis isolates were isolated between 1949 and
2008 in six different countries; the Netherlands, Sweden,
Australia, Kenya, Senegal and Japan. The strains selected
for CGH analysis included the vaccine strains that were
part of the Dutch WCV used before 2005. Other strains
were selected based on frequency of occurrence of
MLST types in each time period (see additional file 9,
Table S8 for MLST frequencies). Thus, strains selected
are representative of the most prevalent MLST-types in
each time period. Swedish strains were selected based
on Pulse Field type in accordance with frequency of
occurrence. This work does not require approval of the
ethical commission.
Culture of strains and DNA isolation

The B. pertussis strains used for microarray analysis in
this study are listed in additional file 3, Table S2.
Strains were cultured for 72 hours on Bordet-Gengou
agar plates at 35°C. Subsequently, they were grown at
35°C in Verweij medium (NVI, Bilthoven, Netherlands)
with 200 μg ml-1 heptakis (2, 6-di-o-methyl)-b-cyclodextrine for 24 hours while being shaken at 200 rpm.
Chromosomal DNA was isolated using the Promega
Wizard®Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The precipitated DNA was dissolved in 100 μl of EB
(elution buffer, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0) (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany).
B. pertussis DNA array design and construction

The spotted 70-mer oligonucleotides microarray was
constructed as described previously in [45]. Probes were
spotted non-adjacent and in triplicate. The newly
designed microarrays used in this study were custommade pan-Bordetella microarrays using the 8 × 15 K
format developed by Agilent Technologies, Wilmington,
USA. The set of 5,910 60-mer oligonucleotides (60mer), where one oligonulcleotide corresponds to one
gene, covered 94% of the genes in the three sequenced
Bordetella strains B. pertussis Tohama I, B. parapertussis
12822 and B. bronchiseptica RB50 strain. B. pertussis oligonucleotides (60-mers) were deduced from the 70-mers
used in the spotted microarray. In addition, 98 control
probes were included in the microarray, and all spots
were printed in duplicate (non adjacent). All userdefined probes were uploaded through the Agilent eArray Web portal (http://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray).
All oligonucleotide sequences are listed (additional file
1, Table S1a and additional file 2, Table S1b). Additional

details on the microarray production are available
through the ArrayExpress microarray data repository
(accession number A-MEXP-1695 for the spotted array
and accession number A-MEXP-1697 for the extended
Bordetella microarray).
Labeling of genomic DNA and Microarray hybridization

For each CGH hybridization the DNA of a test strain
and the reference strain ATCC BAA-589 Tohama I
were labeled. Four micrograms of chromosomal DNA of
B. pertussis were mixed with 20 μl of the 2.5 × Random
Primer Mix (BioPrime DNA labeling kit; Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK) in a total volume of 41 μl of water, boiled
for 5 minutes, and then placed on ice. The samples
were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 13,200 rpm and were
mixed with 5 μl 10 × dNTP mix [2 mM dATP, dCTP
and dGTP, 0.5 mM dTTP (Roche, Indianapolis, USA)],
2.5 μl of 1 mM Cy3 dUTP (for reference strain) or Cy5
dUTP (for the test strain) (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and 1 μl Klenow polymerase (40 U μl -1 )
(BioPrime DNA labeling kit; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).
The samples were incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. Subsequently, the test and reference samples were purified
separately using CyScribe GFX Purification Kit (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and then eluted in
60 μl elution buffer. The incorporation of the Cy-dyes
in the labeled target sequences was measured with a
NanoDrop
spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop
Technologies).
For the spotted B. pertussis microarray in each CGH
experiment, equal amounts of Cy3 dye (reference) and
Cy5 dye (test) were used. The volume of the samples
was decreased using a speedvac concentrator (New
Brunswick Scientific, Edison, USA). The labeled test and
reference samples were mixed together with 79.2 μl of
hybridization solution [3.44 × SSC (Invitrogen, Paisley,
UK), 0.32% SDS (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 1.0 mg yeast
tRNA/ml]. Before loading on the microarray, the hybridization solution was heated for 3 minutes at 100°C and
5.8 μl of 10 × DIG blocking buffer was added.
For the Agilent pan-Bordetella microarray, 8 μl of Cy5
and 8 μl Cy3 labeled DNA were used if the specific
activity was between 35-55 pmol/μg for Cy3 labeled
DNA and between 25-40 pmol/μg for Cy5 labeled DNA.
Cy5 and Cy3 labeled DNA were mixed with 4.5 μl Agilent 10 × blocking agent, 2 μl H2O and 22.5 μl Agilent
2 × hybridization buffer. Samples were further treated as
described in Agilent protocols (Agilent oligonucleotide
array-based CGH for genomic DNA analysis).
Spotted microarrays were hybridized and washed as
previously described [45]. Agilent pan-Bordetella microarrays were hybridized and washed following Agilent’s
protocol (Agilent oligonucleotide array-based CGH for
genomic DNA analysis).

Microarray data mining

Clustering and phylogenetic analysis

The hybridized slides were scanned at a 10 μm-resolution using a ScanArray Gx plus microarray scanner
(Perkin Elmer) equipped with ScanArrray express software. Images from spotted microarrays were analyzed as
previously described in [45]. The images from Agilent
pan-Bordetella microarrays were analyzed using ImaGene software (Biodiscovery, El Segundo, USA). Individual arrays were internally normalized between the Cy3
and Cy5 channels by LOWESS normalization [58].
Based on hybridization results of ATCC BAA-589
Tohama I vs ATCC BAA-589 Tohama I, the cut-off for
detection of a deletion was set at -1.5. Thus the normalized intensity ratio of < -1.5 indicates the absence of the
gene. If the absence of these genes was not previously
described, these genes were selected for further analysis
by PCR or sequence analysis. The combined normalized
data were visualized with TIGR MultiExperimentViewer.
The logarithm of the hybridization ratio [log2 (Cy5/
Cy3)] is indicated in the yellow-black-blue color scale.
[log2 (Cy5/Cy3)]= -3 = Yellow, [log2 (Cy5/Cy3)] = 0 =
Black, [log2 (Cy5/Cy3)] = +3 = Blue.

The final determination of absent (0) or present (1) was
assigned to each RD for each strain in the CGH data
and analyzed by BioNumerics version 5.1 (AppliedMaths, St. Maartens-Latem, Belgium). Clustering was
carried out subsequently by the unweighted-pair group
method using average linkages (UPGMA), to calculate a
similarity matrix. A minimum spanning tree was built
based upon the similarity matrix using Bionumerics version 5.1.

PCR confirmation and sequence analysis

For strains analyzed with the spotted B. pertussis microarray, additional PCR confirmations were performed.
Further PCR analysis was also employed in order to
confirm the results predicted by the microarray hybridizations. The PCR primers were designed to target the
flanking regions of each deletion so that the amplified
region spanned the missing locus. The primers used in
this study are listed in additional file 10, Table S9. The
PCRs were performed under the following conditions:
20 μl total reaction volume, 10 μl Hotstart (Qiagen), 10
pmol of each primer (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), 10
ng chromosomal DNA and 5% DMSO or 1.0 M Betaine
(Sigma, St. Louis, USA). The amplification was carried
out in a Geneamp PCR system 9700 thermocycler
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according to
manufacturer’s recommendations. After amplification,
10 μl of each PCR product was observed via 1% agarose
gel electrophoresis with SYBR-Safe (Molecular Probes,
Carlsbad, USA) staining. In order to determine the deletion boundaries, PCR products were purified using ExoSAP-IT® (USB, Cleveland, USA). Subsequently the
purified PCR products were sequenced using standard
Big Dye Terminator v 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, USA). Nucleotide sequencing was performed with
an Applied Biosystems 3700 DNA Analyzer. Sequence
data obtained from the ABI-3700 was compared to the
B. pertussis sequence of Tohama I using the DNAsequence analysis program KODON to determine the
precise location of each deletion.
