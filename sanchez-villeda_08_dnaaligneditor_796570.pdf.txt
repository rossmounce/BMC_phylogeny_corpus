Abstract
Background: With advances in DNA re-sequencing methods and Next-Generation parallel
sequencing approaches, there has been a large increase in genomic efforts to define and analyze the
sequence variability present among individuals within a species. For very polymorphic species such
as maize, this has lead to a need for intuitive, user-friendly software that aids the biologist, often
with naïve programming capability, in tracking, editing, displaying, and exporting multiple individual
sequence alignments. To fill this need we have developed a novel DNA alignment editor.
Results: We have generated a nucleotide sequence alignment editor (DNAAlignEditor) that
provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface for manual editing of multiple sequence alignments with
functions for input, editing, and output of sequence alignments. The color-coding of nucleotide
identity and the display of associated quality score aids in the manual alignment editing process.
DNAAlignEditor works as a client/server tool having two main components: a relational database
that collects the processed alignments and a user interface connected to database through universal
data access connectivity drivers. DNAAlignEditor can be used either as a stand-alone application
or as a network application with multiple users concurrently connected.
Conclusion: We anticipate that this software will be of general interest to biologists and
population genetics in editing DNA sequence alignments and analyzing natural sequence variation
regardless of species, and will be particularly useful for manual alignment editing of sequences in
species with high levels of polymorphism.

Background
Maize is a highly polymorphic species with numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletions (InDel) commonly present among maize alleles
[1,2]. One consequence of this level of polymorphism is
that sequence alignments of maize genes constructed with

standard software such as CLUSTAL W, Muscle, Dialign,
MAFFT, T-Coffee, etc., must be visually inspected and
manually edited to ensure that an optimal alignment is
obtained. This problem, together with the need to make
base calls and alignment decisions in regions of variable
base quality, creates the need for a tool to assist the

researcher in manual editing of sequence alignments.
Researchers in communities other than maize also require
user-friendly tools to facilitate input, processing, and output of the sequence diversity among individuals within
the species. Although there are several improved methods
[3] to generate alignments for multiple nucleotide
sequences, there is a need to improve software for manual
editing to evaluate and fix discrepancies. Our goal was to
produce a sequence alignment tool (DNAAlignEditor)
that provides an efficient path for editing multiple
sequence alignments to improve alignment quality, tracking edited alignments, and exporting sequence files to
external tools for analysis.

Implementation
DNAAlignEditor is written in Visual Basic for the user
interface, MS Access database for the stand-alone version
or PostrgeSQL 8.0 database for the network version, and
embedded ActiveX data object drivers for connectivity
between the database and the user interface. DNAAlignEditor network version is designed to share alignment
information when several users are simultaneously logged
into the system and to manage alignments collected in the
database. Regardless of whether the stand-alone or network version is used, the database aids in the tracking and
manipulation of large numbers of sequences, and the relationship among genes, primers, amplicons, and population groups. The database is also required to track
multiple versions of the same alignments and to combine
alignments. Editing of a handful of gene alignments may
be accomplished without the aid of a database; however,
processing, editing, and finishing hundreds of alignments
requires a more sophisticated system managed by a database.
DNAAlignEditor stores a set of interrelated tables in a relational database (DNADB) supporting alignment information to provide easy editing, querying, importing, and
exporting function from genes, primers, populations,
nucleotide sequence alignments, and quality scores as
shown in the entity relationship diagram [see additional
file 1]. The system is a user-friendly editing tool using
grids, text boxes, combo boxes, and scroll lists to facilitate
data access. DNAAlignEditor tool color codes nucleotide
identity for ease in visual identification of sequence polymorphisms and displays the quality score associated with
each base to aid in manual editing. The quality score-centric view is one of the major and unique features that distinguish DNAAlignEditor from other alignment programs
(Figure 1).
DNAAlignEditor accepts alignments in three different formats and checks the consistency of the information before
addition to the database [see additional file 2]. The first
format uses the information from PHRAP ace files, and a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/154

file that defines the gene information associated with the
alignment. The second format is a fasta format. The last
format accepts a tab delimited text, file having a header
with information related to gene, amplicon, and total
bases followed by a nucleotide sequence row and a quality
scores row (or no-quality where a default quality score of
15 is applied to all base calls) [see additional file 2].
The program validates the data before it is imported, i.e.
that genes, amplicons, and populations exist in DNADB.
For sequences without quality scores, the program assigns
a default quality score of 15 for each base. This value can
be changed in the configuration file. By definition, a phred
quality score of Q ≥ 20 indicates that there is a less than 1
in 100 chance that the base call is incorrect. Consequently, "Q20" bases are considered "high quality" calls
with corresponding low error probabilities [4,5]. By adding a standard quality score of Q = 15, we effectively flag
those bases as unknown quality.
Once the alignment information is in the database, it can
be edited in an intuitive, user-friendly interface. A user
help file can be accessed by pressing the F1 key. The tool
provides several features to edit information stored in the
database such as moving individual sequences up and
down for ease of fixing errors in multiple lines, moving
bases from the 5' direction to the 3' direction and conversely, deleting and inserting individual bases and block
of bases, and deleting and inserting entire columns in the
alignment. DNAAlignEditor forms initial alignments by
executing either of the integrated CLUSTAL W [6] or MUSCLE programs [7], and displays and prints phylogenies
with TreeView [8]. The inclusion of a "Re-CLUSTAL" function allows editing to be preformed as a reiterative process, for instance rerunning CLUSTAL W after trimming
end sequences or removing lower quality individual
sequences for the initial alignment. DNAAlignEditor also
allows the user to export fasta files with quality files and/
or files compatible with DnaSP [9] for further analysis.
Upon editing changes and saving, the tool will generate a
new alignment while maintaining the original for further
use or reference.

Results and discussion
There are several software packages that produce nucleotide sequence alignments such as CLUSTAL W, Muscle,
Dialign, MAFFT, and T-Coffee. However, all of these programs produce alignments that must be manually examined and edited for accuracy. By integrating a highly
intuitive visual display with CLUSTAL functions, DNAAlignEditor allows the researcher move seamlessly between
alignment and editing functions. The inclusion of quality
scores allow the researcher to make informed decisions on
editing InDel containing regions and accessing the certainty of unique nucleotide polymorphisms. The database

functions promote efficient tracking of large sets of primers, genes, amplicons; and the relationships among these
components of diversity sequencing projects. It is the
focus on intuitive manual editing functions, inclusion of
quality scores, and power of tracking components in large
project that distinguish the software from other available
for alignment functions. While a variety of alignment editors are now available include BioEdit [10], JalView [11],
and INTERALIGN [12]. Of these only JalView, like DNAAlignEditor, is open source. None of the other programs is
as intuitive to the naïve user nor uses the quality score feature central to DNAAlignEditor. In addition, the database
functions of DNAAlignEditor for tracking the components
of a re-sequencing projects makes DNAAlignEditor more
appropriate for large DNA sequence diversity projects.
This software has been successfully used by the National
Science Foundation funded "Molecular and Functional
Diversity of the Maize Genome" group at the University of
Missouri [13], University of Wisconsin, and Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratories for manual editing of alignments.

DNAAlignEditor was essential for tracking and exporting
over 4,000 alignments are currently stored in DNADB
with more than 50,000 sequences from several maize,
teosinte, and Tripsacum accessions. In addition the amplicon merge feature was very helpful for extended sequencing of genes of particular interest to the group. The
finished alignments are displayed in a comprehensive
graphical user interface tool included in panzea site [14].

Conclusion
We have developed a nucleotide sequence alignment editor (DNAAlignEditor) that provides an intuitive, userfriendly tool for manual editing of multiple sequence
alignments which can be used for different species to
allow researchers to visualize and edit the alignment
information in a straight forward way, and realign the
sequences using the CLUSTAL W or Muscle software, as
well as export information to different packages for further analysis.
