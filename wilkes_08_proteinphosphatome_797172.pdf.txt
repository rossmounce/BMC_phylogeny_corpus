Abstract
Background: Malaria, caused by the parasitic protist Plasmodium falciparum, represents a major
public health problem in the developing world. The P. falciparum genome has been sequenced,
which provides new opportunities for the identification of novel drug targets. We report an
exhaustive analysis of the P. falciparum genomic database (PlasmoDB) aimed at identifying and
classifying all protein phosphatases (PP) in this organism.
Results: Using a variety of bioinformatics tools, we identified 27 malarial putative PP sequences
within the four major established PP families, plus 7 sequences that we predict to dephosphorylate
"non-protein" substrates. We constructed phylogenetic trees to position these sequences relative
to PPs from other organisms representing all major eukaryotic phyla except Cercozoans (for which
no full genome sequence is available). Predominant observations were: (i) P. falciparum possessed
the smallest phosphatome of any of the organisms investigated in this study; (ii) no malarial PP
clustered with the tyrosine-specific subfamily of the PTP group (iii) a cluster of 7 closely related
members of the PPM/PP2C family is present, and (iv) some P. falciparum protein phosphatases are
present in clades lacking any human homologue.
Conclusion: The considerable phylogenetic distance between Apicomplexa and other Eukaryotes
is reflected by profound divergences between the phosphatome of malaria parasites and those of
representative organisms from all major eukaryotic phyla, which might be exploited in the context
of efforts for the discovery of novel targets for antimalarial chemotherapy.

Background
Eukaryotic protein phosphatases
The reversible phosphorylation of proteins represents a
ubiquitous regulatory mechanism for diverse pathways
and systems in eukaryotic cells. The process is controlled
by a balance between the antagonistic activities of protein
kinases, which catalyse the phosphorylation of serine,
threonine or tyrosine residues predominantly (reviewed
in [1,2]), and more marginally of other residues, notably

histidine [3,4], and those of protein phosphatases, which
cleave the monophosphate esters from the phosphorylated form of the same residues (reviewed in [4-6]). A
large range of kinases have been identified, which seem to
have arisen by multiple gene duplication events with subsequent selection [7]. In contrast the number of different
protein phosphatase catalytic subunits is much lower than
that of kinases, and phosphatases are in general less discriminating than most kinases in substrate selectivity. This

lack of specificity combined with high catalytic efficiency
suggest that a 'naked' protein phosphatase activity is
potentially toxic [6]. The specificity and regulation of
many of these enzymes is in fact mediated by accessory
proteins (the phosphatase regulatory subunits), a wide
variety of which interact with the relatively small repertoire of catalytic subunits (this is not the case for the PTP
group, see below). As a consequence, it is speculated that
the total number of protein phosphatase holoenzymes
involved in regulatory pathways matches, or even exceeds
the protein kinase repertoire [8-10]. There are four broad
families of protein phosphatases with distinct evolutionary histories:
1. The PPP group. PPP sequences (Phospho-Protein
Phosphatases) are highly conserved, and constitute perhaps the most highly conserved set of sequences across
the eukaryotic kingdom [11,12]. They encode a wide variety of phosphatase activities directed not only at phosphoproteins but at other substrates as well. The
dependency of these enzymes on Mn2+, Ca2+ and/or Co2+
led to members of this group being called metallophosphatases. The PPP group, which constitutes a subgroup of
metallophosphatases, is the most extensively studied type
of protein phosphatase. Classically these enzymes were
classified into three major groups, PP1, PP2A and PP2B,
defined in terms of substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity [13]. This classification has been extended in
recent years with the identification of a range of sequences
related to, but distinct from, PP2A, and a of series of
sequences which diverged from the other PPPs early in the
evolutionary history of the eukaryotes [6,14]. Thus the
PPP family (reviewed in [8]) now comprises as many as
eight distinct subtypes of serine/threonine phosphatases:
PP1, PP2A, PP2B (calcineurin, PP3), PP4, PP5, PP6, PP7
and the plant-specific BSU subfamily, which is closely
related to PP1 and characterised by the presence of a diagnostic Kelch motif [15]. Among these subtypes, PP2, -4
and -6 are closely related to each other and have been
grouped in a distinct subfamily [16].
Furthermore, a family of bacterial-like PPP sequences
found in eukaryotes (including in P. falciparum) has
recently been described [17]. Whereas three highly conserved motifs (GDXHG, GDXXDRG and GNH [E/D])
mediating metal coordination in the active centre are considered as the signature of the PPP family, sequences
showing no similarities to the known PPP phosphatases
beyond the presence of the GDXHG and GDXXDRG
motifs were identified in Plants, Plasmodium, Trypanosoma
and some fungi. This revealed the existence in eukaryotes
of "non-conventional" branches of the PPP family
(reviewed in [17]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/412

2. The PPM/PP2C group comprises a highly diverse, evolutionarily recent set of enzymes with Mg2+ or Mn2+dependent serine/threonine phosphatase activities. The
active forms appear to be highly diverse monomeric
polypeptides which in many cases possess regulatory
domains in C- or N-terminal extensions. A number of
defined motifs and conserved residues relate to binding of
activating metal ions, water and phosphate groups, as in
the PPP type enzymes, but there is no discernable
sequence homology between the two groups, despite
remarkable structural similarity [18]. A major part of the
functions of PP2C (PPM) activities in a variety of species
appears to be to modulate stress responses [5,19]. PPM
enzymes form part of a superfamily that includes bacterial
forms (SpoIIE) and a mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. The PPM family of protein phosphatases is greatly expanded in plants [19].
3. The PTP (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase) superfamily,
which is subdivided into three main families: the tyrosinespecific phosphatases, the dual-specificity PTPs (which
include the cdc25-like, the Ccdc14 and the MAPK phosphatase groups [20-22]), and the low molecular weight
phosphatases [23]. The tyrosine and dual-specificity phosphatases are involved in signalling, cell growth and differentiation, and in the control of cell cycle progression (for
example, cdc25 is a major regulator of cyclin-dependent
kinase activity [20], and cdc14 regulates mitosis exit by
dephosphorylating CDK targets [22]). The enzymes share
a common catalytic mechanism mediated by cysteine,
arginine and aspartic acid residues. Supplementary
domains assist in targeting and substrate specificity [24],
in contrast to most other types of phosphatases, which
require interaction with regulatory proteins for proper
substrate binding.
4. The NIF group (NLI interacting factor-like phosphatase) includes the FCP1 (TFIIF-associating C-terminal
domain (CTD) phosphatase 1) and SCP (Small CTD
phosphatases) [25,26]. These phosphatases are responsible for dephosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal
domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II and interact with the
transcription factor TFIIF [27,28]. The function appears to
be the dephosphorylation of serine residues within the
conserved heptad repeat in the C-terminal, which is
required to reactivate the polymerase after termination of
transcription. The NIF phosphatases have a DxDx(T/V)
motif in the active site [29].
The case for a Plasmodium phosphatome study
Malaria remains a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions, bearing a huge socio-economic impact on affected countries, most of which are in
the developing world. Malaria parasites have a complex
life cycle. Infection of human beings by Plasmodium falci-

parum, the species responsible for the lethal form of
human malaria, begins with the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito, which delivers sporozoites into the bloodstream. These cells establish an infection inside
hepatocytes, where they undergo intense multiplication
generating several thousand merozoites, a process called
exo-erythrocytic schizogony. The merozoites invade
erythrocytes, where they also undergo schizogony, the
process that is responsible for malaria pathogenesis. Some
merozoites, however, arrest the cell cycle and differentiate
into male or female gametocytes, which are infective to
the mosquito. Once ingested by the insect, the gametocytes develop into gametes and fuse into a zygote. Further
development in the mosquito involves a process of sporogony, producing sporozoites that accumulate in the salivary glands and are now ready to infect a new human
host (see http://www.malaria.org for information on
malaria).
The study of signalling processes (in particular those
involving protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation)
in malaria parasites presents considerable interest, both in
terms of fundamental biology (how does a eukaryote that
is phylogenetically very distant from model organisms
regulate growth, proliferation, differentiation and transition between its complex developmental stages?) and in
terms of the search for urgently needed novel drug targets
[30,31]. The sequencing of the P. falciparum genome [32]
and the availability of an interactive genomic database
(PlasmoDB, http://www.plasmodb.org) [33] have dramatically facilitated the identification of potential targets.
Probabilistic models of peptide domains sharing an evolutionary history (Hidden Markov Models, HMMs) permit the rapid scanning of a set of conceptual translations
from any organism whose genomic sequence is available
[34]. The plasmodial kinome has thus been characterised
and highlighted profound divergences from the kinomes
of other eukaryotes [35,36]. Although a number of studies
have been published on individual phosphatases of
malaria parasites (see below), a full "phosphatome" analysis has not been reported, while studies of both the
kinomes [37] and phosphatomes [38] of other major parasitic unicellular eukaryotes, the trypanosomatids, have
recently been published. Here, we use the Pfam collection
of HMMs [39] to investigate the phosphatome of P. falciparum in relation to that of members from all major
groups of the eukaryotic kingdom [40].

Results and discussion
Protein phosphatase-encoding genes in representative
organisms from major eukaryotic groups
HMM profiles defining the diverse phosphatase catalytic
domains (see Methods) were used to scan the predicted
proteomes of the following organisms, representing all
major groups within the eukaryotic kingdom (with the

exception or Cercozoans, for which a representative full
genome sequence is not available at present): Homo sapiens (Opisthokonts), Dictyostelium discoideum (Amoebozoa), Arabidopsis thaliana (Plants), P. falciparum
(Alveolates), the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana (Heterokonts), Trypanosma brucei (Discicristates) and Giardia
lamblia (Excavates) (see Fig. 1). This allowed the identification of 633 sequences, with a number of sequences per
genome ranging from 34 sequences for P. falciparum (the
smallest phosphatome in our sample) to 224 sequences
for A. thaliana (see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The distribution of the various phosphatase families in each
phosphatome is illustrated in Fig. 2. The major expansion
of all protein phosphatase types, with the exception of
PTPs, in Arabadopsis thaliana is evident. In Homo sapiens
the major expansion is in the PTP superfamily. These
expansions probably reflect the requirement for flexible
and complex intercellular signalling in these multicellular
organisms, evidently achieved by distinct evolutionary
processes in plants and metazoans. The 34 entries in the
P. falciparum phosphatome include 7 sequences of the
PPP group clustering with subfamilies of phosphatases
whose predicted substrates are distinct from phosphoproteins; see Fig. 3). In the next sections we provide a detailed
description of P. falciparum database mining for each of
the 4 major phosphatase groups (PPP, PPM, PTP and
NIF).

Additional file 1), together with those from the other
organisms cited above, were subjected to multiple

Markov cluster identified (top of the tree in Fig. 3A,
shaded in grey) is clearly separated from the other groupings within the tree. Annotations associated with these
sequences indicate that this cluster consists exclusively of
serine/threonine phosphatases of the PPP class, whereas
the other clusters regroup metallophosphatase classes
whose main substrates are not phosphoproteins. Annotations associated with sequences forming distinct clades
containing P. falciparum entries were used to assign putative function to these enzymes. Of particular interest are
two P. falciparum sequences (PF14_0660 and PFL0300c)
which cluster close to, but are distinct from, the PPP

group. These have been previously identified as similar to
bacterial type PPPases (Shelphs) [17].
The "PPP sequences" region of the tree is shown in greater
detail in Figure 3B. All families of the PPP type protein
phosphatases as identified by Cohen et al. [8] are represented in P. falciparum, as well as an additional type found
only in plants and containing the Kelch motif [41], with
which the plasmodial sequence PF14_0630 [A] clearly
clusters [throughout the article, the capital letter in square
brackets following a PlasmoDB identifier refers to the
labelling on the figures]; this is the only P. falciparum
sequence occurring in a PPP group with no homologues
in humans.
Previously characterised P. falciparum metallophosphatases
Many of the plasmodial sequences in this group have
been the subjects of previous reports in the literature:

PF14_0630 [A] (BSU subfamily)
This protein has been first identified as a PP1-related
enzyme, which is confirmed by the position of this
sequence in our phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3A); this enzyme
was called PfPPÎ±g[42]. Subsequently, it was found that
PfPPÎ± has close relatives in plants, which, like the latter
enzyme, encode tandem Kelch motifs in their N-terminal
extension; the name "PPKLs" (Protein Phosphatases with
Kelch-Like domains) was suggested to designate members
of this subfamily of PP1 enzymes [15]. The PPKL gene
structure is conserved in homologous sequences from the
Apicomplexans Cryptosporidium hominis, Toxoplasma gondii
and Theileria parva (one sequence per genome), as well as
in the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (3 and 4
occurrences respectively). Kelch motifs form distinctive
'propeller like' tertiary structures proposed to mediate
interactions with regulatory subunits [43]. At least one of
the three A. thaliana gene products is found in the nucleus
and appears to be involved in regulating the signal from
the brassinosteroid plant hormones [41]. The limited distribution of PPKLs (these proteins have been found only

in Plants and Apicomplexa, which is consistent with our
phylogenetic tree) is reminiscent with that of other gene
families and in line with the proposed photosynthetic
ancestry of Apicomplexa [44]. The absence of PPKLs in
Opisthokonts suggests PF14_0630 might be a target for
parasite-selective inhibition.
PF14_0142 [B] (PP1 type)
This protein exhibits the properties of a typical PP1 phospho-serine/threonine phosphatase, and an inhibitor profile consistent with PP1 type activity (IC50 values for
tautomycin, I-1, I-2 and okadaic acid being 0.8, 400, 7
and 100 nM, respectively) [45]. The protein appears to be
expressed in all life cycle stages as judged by Western blot
analysis. Microarray analysis indicates a small reduction
in expression during the mid-trophozoite stage. RNAi of
this sequence resulted in the ablation of PP1 expression,
as well as in the impairment of parasite growth (as measured by 3H-hypoxanthine incorporation); the subsequent
finding that P. falciparum does not possess the molecular
machinery that mediates RNA interference makes these
data difficult to interpret. However, the function of this
protein was subsequently confirmed in vivo through complementation of a yeast mutant deficient in PP1 activity
[46].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/412

PF14_0224 [C] (PP7 subgroup)
This protein has been described previously as PfPPJ [47].
The phosphatase activity is okadaic acid-resistant, and
catalysis requires Mn2+ but no other cations (Mg2+ or
Ca2+). Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the
usual metal coordinating, phosphate binding and water
activation motifs, but indicated substantial differences
from the PP1, PP2A and calcineurin subgroups. This is
consistent with our assignment of the sequence to the PP7
subgroup, which appears to have diverged from the other
grouping very early in the evolution of the eukaryotes
[14]. Similar to PF08_0129 discussed above, subsequent
analysis demonstrated the primary PF14_0224 translation product to be much larger than the PP catalytic
domain, with two EF-hand motifs that must be occupied
by calcium for the enzyme to become fully active [48]. The
small size originally predicted for PfPPJ was due to a spurious stop codon in the original cDNA [47], but a fragment corresponding in size to this is apparently produced
by post-translational processing detected by Western blotting.
PFC0595c [D] (PP2/4/6 type)
This protein has been described previously as PfPPÎ² [49].
The initial sequence analysis assigned this enzyme to the
PP2A group of protein phosphatases. Our analysis suggests, however, that the sequence is a member of the
closely related PP2/4/6 family (with closer clustering with
the PP4 subgroup), which has been implicated in cell
cycle regulation [50]. Although gametocyte-specific
expression of PFC0595c mRNA expression was originally
reported, microarray data [51] indicate that the gene is
expressed at all stages of the asexual cycle, as well as in
sporozoites and gametocytes.
PF08_0129 [F] (PP3, PP2B or calcineurin subgroup)
Our phylogenetic analysis indicates this sequence to be
the only one encoding a calcineurin-type enzyme (can) in
the P. falciparum genome. A calcineurin type activity (okadaic acid insensitive, calcium dependent) which is noncompetitively inhibited by cyclosporine/cyclophilin has
been described in the parasite [52] and subsequently
attributed to the protein encoded by PF08_0129, which
contains a calmodulin-binding domain. The protein
appears to be subject to post-translational proteolysis producing a constitutively active core from a large precursor.
A putative regulatory subunit of calcineurin (CnB) was
identified in the context of the same study [48].
PFI1245c [G] (PP2 subgroup)
Previously described by Dobson et al [52], this enzyme
activity was potently inhibited by okadaic acid (IC50 ~ 0.2
nM), and required Mn2+ for activity. These properties led
to its classification as a member of the PP2A group. Our
phylogenetic analysis supports the assignment of this pro-

tein to the PP2 group of protein phosphatases. The same
group then identified PfARP (aspartate-rich protein), a
plasmodial protein with significant similarity to the I2PP2A
family of inhibitors of mammalian PP2A [53]. PfARP was
able to inhibit PFI1245c, but none of the four other P. falciparum protein phosphatases tested [54].
MAL13P1.274 [I] (PP5 subgroup)
This protein has been reported previously independently
by two groups [55,56]. The activity is sensitive to
nanomolar concentrations of okadaic acid. The sequence
of the polypeptide comprises a nuclear targeting sequence
at its N-terminus, as well as TPR (tetratricopeptide)
repeats, which have an autoinhibitory effect on phosphatase activity; in other systems, this inhibition is
relieved by binding unsaturated fatty acids, and indeed,
purified recombinant MAL13P1.274 protein, like the
native protein enriched from P. falciparum extracts, exhibited phosphatase activity that can be enhanced by arachidonic and oleic acids.
Uncharacterised P. falciparum PPPs
The PFI1360c [H] peptide is to our knowledge not
described in the literature. Our phylogenetic analysis (Fig
3A) indicates that PFI1360c is most closely related to the
PP2/4/6 subgroup, although it emerges at the very base of
the cluster, and is therefore relatively divergent from other
members of this subgroup. Members of this subgroup are
involved in a variety of functions in metazoans, including
centrosome maturation, spliceosome assembly, chromatin modification, and regulation of NF-ÎºB and mTOR signalling pathways [16]. As mentioned above, two
plasmodial sequences (PF14_0660 [O] and PFL0300c
[P]) cluster close to the "Shewanella-like phosphatases
("Shelphs") group, confirming a prior report that P. falciparum possesses two members of this bacterial-like phosphatase family [17]. No functional studies have been
reported on these two enzymes; likewise, we are not aware
of any published biochemical studies of any of the 7 phos-

phatases predicted to act on non-protein substrates
(sequences J-P in Fig. 3A) present in the tree.
PPM group
Constitution of the PPM dataset
A HMM search of the P. falciparum peptide sequence set
using the PF00481 (Protein phosphatase 2C) HMM profile produced 10 hits. Markov clustering of the P. falciparum sequences, along with the domain-conformant set
from the model genomes, was performed to generate a
tree.
The PPM phylogenetic tree
Phylogenetic analysis of the PPM-related sequences was
performed as for the PPP group (see above), and the data
are summarised in Figure 4, Table 1 and Additional file 2.
Annotation of PP2c-conformant sequences is less
advanced than that of the PPP family, and a putative function could not be assigned to most sequences. Interestingly, a majority of P. falciparum PPM sequences (7/9)
cluster together, and these sequences are members of an
orthologous group containing only apicomplexan phyla
(data not shown), indicating they evolved following early
divergence from other Eukaryotes. A sub-grouping of
sequences that includes a single P. falciparum member
(PF10_0093 [J]) shows similarity to bacterial SpoIIe
domain-containing PP2c-like enzymes involved in the
control of sporulation [57]. Other significant groupings
consist entirely of Arabadopsis sequences, reflecting the
very large expansion of this family of phosphatases in
plants (see Fig. 2), where PP2c enzymes play major roles
in the mediation of stress responses [19,58].

Where necessary, an update of the PlasmoDB annotations will be submitted to the database curators. The "Motifs" column reports the targeting
signals identified by the following query tools in PlasmoDB: HT, Host Targeting; SP, Signal Peptide; API, Apicoplast targeting. The "Key" column

has been implicated in the regulation of the nucleotide
exchange activity of translation elongation factor 1B,
antagonising its in vitro phosphorylation by mammalian
protein kinase C [60]. In contrast to the monomeric
nature of other PPM enzymes, maximal activity is associated with homodimerization of the peptide. The P. falci-

parum PP2c-conformant sequences are found in two
regions separated by over 400 residues. Mamoun et al.
proposed that the peptide contains two distinct PP2c type
domains, each capable of enzymatic activity on phosphoserine or â threonine [59]. In this model the dimeric
enzyme presents four active sites. Detailed examination of

the sequence indicates that only one full set of the conserved functional and structural groups is present in a single polypeptide, and that this complete set is distributed
between the two distinct regions. However, evidence that
the two peptides interact 'head to tail' may indicate that
the regions in the different peptides complement each
other, to produce two effective active sites. Such an
arrangement may not be uncommon in Plasmodium. Two

other PPM-related sequences (PFE1010w [E] and
MAL8P1.109 [H]) show evidence of the same split of the
PP2c domain, with shorter inserts (200 and 140 residues
respectively); there is no experimental data on the function of the latter sequences. It is noteworthy that both are
members of the same exclusive Apicomplexan-specific
cluster mentioned above that also contains PF11_0396
[G].

PTP Tyrosine phosphatase-like group
Constitution of the PTP dataset
Searching the P. falciparum peptide set with Pfam-derived
HMM profiles of the PTP superfamily identified a small
number of sequences conforming to dual-specificity
phosphatases (DSPs) [61]: [PFC0380w, PF14_0524 (fragment) and PF14_0525 (fragment)], and two low scoring
hit to tyrosine phosphatases (Y-phosphatases) [62]
(PF11_0139, PF11_0281) (See Table 1 and Additional file
3). The two fragments PF14_0524 and PF14_0525 are
immediately adjacent on the genome, and have similar
expression profiles, suggesting that the stop codon separating them may be a misread, or may be read through in
translation, as has been shown to be the case for at least
one P. falciparum gene displaying an internal stop codon
[63]. One of the atypical protein kinases of the Apicomplexan-specific FIKK family has the same configuration,
with a stop codon interrupting an otherwise complete catalytic domain [35,64]. For further analyses, a hybrid
sequence (labelled PF14_052x) was constructed by joining the two sequences. The locus has recently been reannotated in PlasmoDB: a gene model called
"PF14_024_changed" is now proposed, which generates a
single predicted polypeptide with a full phosphatase
domain encompassing sequences that were previously
separated into PF14_0524 and PF14_0525.
The PTP phylogenetic tree
The tree (Fig. 5) confirms that PF14_052x [A] and
PFC0380w [B] are clearly DSP-type proteins [61]. DSPs
include the enzymes that regulate the activity of the
mitogen-activated kinases, which play important role in
adaptive responses of eukaryotic cells to extra- or intra-cellular stimuli [61]. The plasmodial kinome encodes two
MAPKs, the regulation of which (either positive or negative) is not understood [65]. If phosphatase-mediated
negative regulation of MAPKs occurs in the parasite as it
does in mammalian cells, PF14_052x and PFC0380w are
the most likely candidates in the Plasmodium phosphatome to fulfil such a function, in view of their position
in the PTP tree; however, this hypothesis remains to be
tested experimentally. Interestingly, PF14_052x contains
short stretches of positively charged residues near the
amino terminus, similar to the "KIM" (Kinase Interaction
Motif) found on human MAPK phosphatases and known
to mediate binding to the MAPKs [21]. It was shown previously that the activity of one of the plasmodial MAPKs,
Pfmap-2, is susceptible to the action of a (mammalian)
DSP in vitro [66].

Previously characterised P. falciparum PTPs
Two of the four P. falciparum PTPs have been the subject
of biochemical investigations [67,68]. The PFC0380w [B]
polypeptide was assigned to the DSP subgroup, and like
other members of this subgroup, contains a functional
Zn2+-binding domain in addition to its phosphatase catalytic domain. Recombinant PFC0380w exhibits phosphatase activity on both phosphoserine and
phosphotyrosine, in line with its assignment to the DSP
family.

PF11_0139 [C] belongs to the PRL ("Protein of Regenerating Liver") group [69]. This sequence possesses the CaaX
C-terminal motif for farnesylation, a distinguishing feature of this group of phosphatases (the attachment of a
farnesyl group generally promotes membrane association
to the target protein). It was recently demonstrated that
this motif in PF11_0139 (called PfPRL in this study) is
indeed the target of farnesyl transferase activity purified
from parasite extracts, and that recombinant PfPRL displays phosphatase activity. Interestingly, in merozoites
PfPRL co-localises with AMA-1, a membrane-associated
protein associated with invasion [68].
To our knowledge, nothing has been published on the
other two P. falciparum sequences appearing in the tree. It
is noteworthy that PF11_0281 [D] does not cluster with
any branch containing sequences from other Eukaryotes.
Protein tyrosine phosphatase-like proteins (PTPL; Pfam
PF04387) constitute a small family of proteins structurally related to PTPs, but the substitution of proline for an
essential arginine in the catalytic site renders these
polypeptides catalytically inactive. MAL13P1.168 is the
only P. falciparum sequence containing a PTP-like motif
[70]. While the present paper was in revision, a phylogenetic analysis of PTPs in protozoan parasites was published [70], whose conclusion are essentially in agreement
with our own data with respect to the representation of P.
falciparum sequences in the various families of the PTP
group.
The NIF group
Four P. falciparum sequences (see Table 1 and Additional
file 4) containing domains conforming to the NIF profile
were detected. Two of these (PFE0795c [A] and
MAL13P1.275 [D]) have features that are consistent with
phosphatase activity (in particular the presence of a putative active site DxDx(T/V) motif), while a third sequence
(PF10_0124 [C]), although closely related, does not have
an intact DxDx(T/V) motif [29], and hence may be catalytically inactive. Both MAL13P1.275 and PF10_0124 possess BRCT domains (the BRCA-C-terminal domain is an
evolutionarily conserved phospho-binding domain [71])
diagnostic of Fcp1 phosphatases. PFE0795c is a signifi-

related to SCP type phosphatases [26,29]. A distinct clade
within the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6) involves NIF type
domains associated with the TIM50 sub-unit of the mitochondrial translocase complex. This group includes the P.
falciparum sequence PF07_0110 [B]. It is notable that the
DxDx(T/V) motif is disrupted in all these sequences, and
thus these proteins are unlikely to possess phosphatase
activity.

Missing phosphatase groups
CDC25 enzymes form a distinct group of phosphatases
that play a major role in cell cycle control [72]. These
enzymes have little sequence similarity to PTPs, except for
the presence of the catalytic CX5R motif, and appear to
have evolved from Rhodanese domains, many of which

catalyse sulphur transfer reactions. CDC25s can therefore
be identified using a Rhodanese domain HMM profile
(PF00581). The cyclin-dependent kinases that mediate
cell cycle progression possess conserved threonine and
tyrosine residues (T14 and Y15 in human CDK2), whose
phosphorylation inactivates the enzyme and causes cell
cycle arrest. CDC25 enzymes relieve this block by dephos-

phorylating these residues. Several P. falciparum CDKs display the conserved threonine and tyrosine residues that
are the targets of CDC25 in other systems [20,73]. A Rhodanese domain HMM search identified three hits in P. falciparum, (Fig. 7), two of which were present on the same

CDC25s. We were surprised, however, to notice that this
sequence does not contain the CX5R motif essential for
catalytic activity (see Additional files 5 and 6 for an alignment), and may therefore not encode a functional
enzyme. Whether or not plasmodial CDKs are regulated
by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of T14 and Y15
remains to be investigated; either this mechanism of cell
cycle control does not operate in malaria parasite (there is
to date no evidence that the conserved threonine and tyrosine residues are phosphorylated), or the CDC25 functional homologue is too divergent to be detected.
A high-resolution version of this Figure is available as a
PNG file (see additional file 11)
Other protein phosphatase groups for which we found no
evidence in Plasmodium are the Tyrosine phosphatases
(see Fig. 5), the Low Molecular Weight phosphatases [23],
the cdc14 phosphatases [22] and the Styx phosphatases.
Styx sequences are related to those of PTPs and do recognise phosphotyrosine residues, but are non-catalytic proteins (the catalytic cysteine is replaced by a glycine).
Because of their similarity to PTPs, human Styx sequences
were picked up in our HMM search and are highlighted on
the tree in Fig. 5. However, P. falciparum does not possess
obvious Styx homologues. Finally, an HMM search of the
P. falciparum database using the PFAM profile for Myotubularin (MTM) family of lipid phosphatases [74] yielded
only hits with very low scores, indicating that the parasite
does not encode members of this family.
Targeting
The putative P. falciparum phosphoprotein phosphatase
sequences were examined for the presence of signal peptides targeting proteins to various cellular compartments.
PlasmoDB records the presence of apicoplast targeting
sequences [75], the signal peptides predicted by SignalP
[76], and the motif directing proteins to the host erythrocyte [77,78]; the presence of these motifs on PP sequences
is indicated in Table 1. In addition the set of sequences
was analysed by the PlasMit algorithm http://
gecco.org.chemie.uni-frankfurt.de/plasmit/ for putative
mitochondrial targeting. No sequence demonstrated unequivocal (high stringency) mitochondrial targeting with
this algorithm, not even the peptide associated with the
TIM50 mitochondrial translocase (PF07_0110); however
seven sequences yielded a lower score that is still compatible with mitochondrial targeting (in order of probability:
PFE0795c > PF07_0110 > PF11_0362 > MAL8P1.109 >
PF10_0093 > MAL13P1.44 > PFI1245c). The (presumably
inactive, see above) PF10_0124 is borderline in this
respect and is classified as non-mitochondrial. It is relevant to repeat here, as pointed out above, that the PP5-like
MAL13P1.174 possesses a nuclear localisation signal. It is
important to emphasise (i) that the presence or absence of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/412

targeting motifs on any sequence is dependent on gene
predictions and can vary with database re-annotations,
and (ii) that the functionality of such motifs should be
verified experimentally.
Associated domains and motifs
In addition to the accessory domain instances described
earlier, the only sequence containing associated domains
with homologues in other organisms is that annotated as
erythrocyte membrane-associated antigen (PF10_0177).
In the sequence we originally downloaded and used in
our analyses, this large polypeptide had an EF-hand
domain and a putative acid protease domain in addition
to the phosphatase domain. In a recent re-annotation of
this locus, however, the open reading frames encoding the
phosphatase and protease domains are proposed to be
split and expressed as distinct genes. Other domain combinations are discussed above.

Conclusion
A "protein phosphatase" keyword query on PlasmoDB
yielded 18 entries in the annotated P. falciparum genome,
to be compared to the 27 PP sequences we retrieved using
HHM searches. Using "phosphatase" as a query, PlasmoDB yielded 30 entries, a very similar number to the
total number (34) of sequences of enzymes that phosphorylate proteins and non-protein substrates we found using
HMMs. This indicates that in this instance the Plasmodb
annotation is remarkably accurate, but detailed annotation of these genes can be improved â we are addressing
this issue with the database curators.
We based our approach on HMM searches using established profiles, which would of course miss any "cryptic",
non-HMM-conforming enzymes. The list we propose here
must therefore be viewed as the minimal complement of
functional protein phosphatases.
The ratio of protein kinases to protein phosphatases in P.
falciparum is close to 2:1, in line with the smaller numbers
of phosphatase catalytic domains (compared with those
of kinase catalytic domains) present in other eukaryotes.
The A. thaliana phosphatome contains a large number of
PPMs (linked to modulation of stress responses through
the MAPK pathway [19,21,54]), which may be linked to
the observation that Plant genomes contain a much larger
number of genes coding for receptor kinases than other
organisms (reviewed in [79]). Similarly, PTPs linked to
intercellular signalling, and antagonistic to a large repertoire of tyrosine kinases are vastly expanded in the mammalian phosphatome (Fig. 2). In contrast, the
complement of phosphatases in P. falciparum does not
include any markedly expanded family other than the 7member cluster of PPMs described above, despite a major
expansion of FIKK type kinases observed previously

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/412

[35,64]. Interestingly, the diversity of PP types represented
in the malarial phosphatome is relatively high despite a
comparatively small number of enzymes, which is
explained by our observation that subtypes in the four PP
groups are represented by one member only; this is particularly apparent in the PPP group, where subtypes are frequently represented by one member only. Thus the
parasite maintains a large functional capability despite a
small phosphatome. We have not addressed here the
identification of protein phosphatase regulatory subunits.
Undoubtedly the parasite possesses many such polypeptides, which are likely to considerably increase functional
diversity (reviewed in [5]). It will be fascinating to explore
the functional implications, in terms of both specific biochemical processes (signalling, motility, cell cycle and
transcription control, transport, among many others) and
overall parasite development, of the antagonism between
specific instances of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Importantly, phosphatases are gaining recognition as potential targets for chemotherapeutic
intervention [80], and have been estimated to represent
4% of the druggable human genome; in particular, PTPs
appear an important new target for cancer therapy, notably for melanoma (reviewed in [81]). Thus, the P. falciparum phosphatases, like the plasmodial protein kinases
[31], might well, in the near future, join the cohort of
potential targets for novel antimalarials.

Methods
Selection of Hidden Markov Models for protein
phosphatase catalytic domains
In contrast to the catalytic domains of the protein kinase
superfamily, the vast majority of which conform to a single HMM profile (Pfam database entry PF00069; Pkinase), the diversity of protein phosphatases is reflected by
the presence of 7 distinct Pfam profiles defining catalytic
domains with protein phosphatase activity. Please see

The above profiles were downloaded from Pfam [39,82],
and used unaltered to mine the various genomes for conformant sequences.
Two tyrosine phosphatases (PF00102; Y-phosphatase,
PF03162; Y-phosphatase2), and a dual-specificity serine/
threonine/tyrosine phosphatase activity (PF00782; DSP)
are closely related and are grouped in a single clan, the
protein tyrosine-phosphatase superfamily (also referred
to as PTP) [82]. An additional low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase [PF01451] with limited sequence similarity, but possessing the characteristic PTP motif, is also
listed. Serine-threonine phosphatase activities are found
in two distinct groups: a highly conserved group conforming to the Metallophosphatase family (Pfam
profilePF00149; note that this family includes a wide
range of phosphatase activities in addition to protein
phosphatases; the protein phosphatase activities are classified as PPP type) and a structurally unrelated (though
catalytically similar) group, the PP2C family (Pfam profile
PF00481, PPM).
Identification of catalytic domains
Catalytic domains were identified by use of the
hmmsearch option of HMMER [34] using Hidden Markov
Profiles appropriate to the domain of interest using moderately stringent criteria (Expect value [-E] of 10-3, database record number [-Z] 100000). The initial search used
the global model for each domain type, although the local
model was subsequently used where appropriate if multiple or fragmented domains were found.
Extraction of profile conformant sequences (PP domain
plus short flanking sequences)
Peptide sequences were aligned under the guidance of an
appropriate HMM profile [34] using the hmmalign
option of HMMER. Alignment output in ClustalW format
was trimmed down to those blocks encompassing match
states to the profile and ungapped Fasta formatted
sequences extracted from this sub-set of the alignment.
(T_coffee seq_reformat option).
Multiple sequence alignment
MSA of a given sequence set was performed by three independent methods; ClustalW [83], t-coffee [84] and
hmmalign [34] guided by the appropriate profile. The
alignments used the default settings for each method.
Alignments were combined under t-coffee, and quality of
alignment assessed.

Acknowledgements
This work was made possible by the availability of the P. falciparum genome
database PlasmoDB. We are indebted to all members of the team which
contributed to the development of this database, which is proving an invaluable tool for molecular research on malaria. Financial support for the Plasmodium Genome Consortium was provided by the Burroughs Wellcome
Fund, the Wellcome Trust, the National Institutes of Health (NIAID) and
the U.S. Department of Defence, Military Infectious Diseases Research Program. Financial Support for PlasmoDB was provided by the Burroughs
Wellcome Fund. We thank Dr. J. Chevalier (Service Scientifique de
l'Ambassade de France Ã  Londres) for continuing interest and support. The
idea of undertaking the present study was stimulated by the invited participation of C.D. to a FASEB meeting on phosphatases organised by M. Tremblay (McGill Cancer Center) and D. Virshup (Duke-NUS) â many thanks to
them!
Work in the C.D. laboratory is supported by INSERM, the European Commission (FP6 Integrated Project ANTIMAL and Network of Excellence
BioMalPar), a grant from the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases
(NITD, Singapore) and benefits from the Wellcome Trust core funding
towards the Wellcome Centre for Molecular Parasitology, which also supports J.W.
