HYPOTHESIS

Mitochondrial DNA, chloroplast DNA and the
origins of development in eukaryotic organisms
Hypothesis

Arnold J Bendich

Abstract
Background: Several proposals have been made to explain the rise of multicellular life forms. An internal environment
can be created and controlled, germ cells can be protected in novel structures, and increased organismal size allows a
"division of labor" among cell types. These proposals describe advantages of multicellular versus unicellular organisms
at levels of organization at or above the individual cell. I focus on a subsequent phase of evolution, when multicellular
organisms initiated the process of development that later became the more complex embryonic development found
in animals and plants. The advantage here is realized at the level of the mitochondrion and chloroplast.
Hypothesis: The extreme instability of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts has not been widely appreciated even
though it was first reported four decades ago. Here, I show that the evolutionary success of multicellular animals and
plants can be traced to the protection of organellar DNA. Three stages are envisioned. Sequestration allowed
mitochondria and chloroplasts to be placed in "quiet" germ line cells so that their DNA is not exposed to the oxidative
stress produced by these organelles in "active" somatic cells. This advantage then provided Opportunity, a period of
time during which novel processes arose for signaling within and between cells and (in animals) for cell-cell
recognition molecules to evolve. Development then led to the enormous diversity of animals and plants.
Implications: The potency of a somatic stem cell is its potential to generate cell types other than itself, and this is a
systems property. One of the biochemical properties required for stemness to emerge from a population of cells might
be the metabolic quiescence that protects organellar DNA from oxidative stress.
Reviewers: This article was reviewed by John Logsdon, Arcady Mushegian, and Patrick Forterre.
Background
In order for its lineage to persist, an organism must transmit its genetic information to the next generation and it
uses the chromosome as the vehicle of inheritance. Since
DNA is continuously exposed to damaging agents, however, the problem arises as to how to transmit undamaged
chromosomal DNA to the progeny. For the nucleus of a
eukaryotic cell, the DNA repair problem is relatively mild
because damage is relatively low. The DNA repair problem is more severe for mitochondria and chloroplasts
because the energy demands of the cell are met largely by
electron transport in these organelles, which generates
reactive oxygen species (ROS) as unavoidable by-products. The ROS can lead to oxidative stress and on-site
DNA damage. In a unicellular organism, DNA repair is

the only way to maintain pristine chromosomal DNA in
the cytoplasmic organelles. On the other hand, DNA
damage could be avoided if cells specialized for reproduction were available in which oxidative stress is suppressed: a multicellular organism containing somatic and
germ line cells.
A somatic cell needs to be metabolically active. As conditions change during development or in an adult tissue,
energy needs will change. There will be episodes of
increasing and decreasing demand for ATP from mitochondria and chloroplasts, including sudden changes in
growth rate, temperature, light and water availability, and
pathogen and toxin challenge. An active cell is one
responsive to such change and will unavoidably experience episodes of increasing and decreasing ROS and oxidative stress. A quiet cell is not metabolically equipped
for rapid change and thus experiences minimal oxidative
stress, precisely the conditions for protecting germ line
DNA from damage. The segregation of active and quiet

metabolic states into separate cell types created an adaptive advantage that then provided the time required for
the evolutionary "experiments" that led to development
in multicellular organisms (see Appendix 1). Cells that
later will become gametes are kept quiet early in development. After the germ line organellar DNA is sequestered,
somatic tissues and organs develop to the point at which
reproduction is most likely to succeed. Then the gametes
with their pristine organellar genomes are deployed.
The first multicellular organisms probably arose from
preexisting unicellular forms. Subsequently, some multicellular organisms used development to create specialized parts in the adult. I am unaware of any previous
analysis of the origins of development. Several proposals,
however, have been made to explain the rise of multicelluar life forms [1-4]. An internal environment can be created and controlled, germ cells can be protected in novel
structures, and increased organismal size allows a "division of labor" among cell types including germ cell protection. These proposals describe advantages of
multicellular versus unicellular organisms at levels of
organization at or above the individual cell, and the unicellular-to-multicellular phase of evolution preceded the
phase addressed in my hypothesis. In some muliticellular
eukaryotic lineages there are only two cell types, one of
which is a reproductive spore or germling (slime molds or
Volvox, for example; see Appendix 1). My hypothesis concerns those lineages in which a developmental process
arose to sequester germ cells from somatic cells, leading
to the advantages of organellar DNA protection and DNA
repair cost savings. These advantages allowed the evolution of additional somatic cell types and more complicated organisms, some of which employed gastrulation
and others with permanently attached cells did not.

Presentation of the hypothesis

laboratory). (vi) During 6 stages of development of maize
leaf tissue, the size and structural integrity of cpDNA
decreases progressively from branched molecules of multigenomic size in the basal meristem of seedlings to fragments of subgenomic size in adult plants, as observed in
moving pictures of individual ethidium-stained DNA
molecules [10]. A similar degradative progression of individual cpDNA molecules is observed during leaf development for tobacco and the legume Medicago truncatula
[11] and Arabidopsis [12]. (vii) In fully expanded leaves of
adult plants of Arabidopsis [12,13] and maize [10], more
than half the chloroplasts contain no detectable DNA.
How can we explain this remarkable instability of
organellar DNA? I suggest that the ROS generated during
electron transport that accompanies oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis leads to oxidative stress and
extensive damage to the DNA. For Euglena, repair of the
mtDNA and cpDNA is the only option because it is a unicellular organism. For dark-grown mung bean seedlings,
repair again is the only option for mtDNA since respiration must provide the energy for this aerobic organism.
The mtDNA is so extensively damaged that it turns over
completely in one day. For a light-grown plant, however,
there is another option. If some of the organellar DNA
can be sequestered in quiescent germ line cells, the highly
damaged organellar DNA in somatic cells can be left
unrepaired; it is eventually degraded and its nucleotides
are recycled for their nutritive value [14]. Similarly, oxidatively damaged mtDNA in active somatic cells can either
be repaired or abandoned, as long as undamaged mtDNA
is retained in quiet germ line cells. For the mesozoan
Dicyema japonicum, mtDNA is retained in "stem" mitochondria of germ cells, but mtDNA is undetectable in
most somatic cells of mature larvae and adults, a result of
either dilution without replication [15] or, I suggest,
abandonment and degradation of mtDNA.

Instability of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts

The DNA in both mitochondria and chloroplasts can be
extremely unstable, as illustrated by the following examples. (i) The half-life of rat mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
in days, is 6.7 for heart, 9.4 for liver, 10.4 for kidney, and
31 for brain [5]. (ii) In the single-celled alga Euglena, the
half-lives for chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and mtDNA are
1.6 and 1.8 cell doublings, respectively, but nuclear DNA
is so stable that turnover could not be detected [6,7]. (iii)
Two days after sowing mung bean seeds, the mtDNA in
dark-grown seedlings turns over entirely in 24 hours [8].
(iv) The half-life of mtDNA in yeast is ~4 hours (for a
mutant defective in the mtDNA polymerase gamma) [9].
(v) Light triggers the degradation of DNA in maize chloroplasts [10]. Four hours after exposing 10-day-old darkgrown seedlings to light, the leaf begins to green, and the
average DNA content per chloroplast decreases to 54% by
hour 6 and 9% by hour 24 (unpublished results from my

DNA damage and repair in mitochondria and chloroplasts

From an evolutionary perspective, the only objective for
an organism is to replicate its DNA and pass it on to the
next generation. Unintended alterations in chromosomal
DNA molecules can arise in various ways, including DNA
polymerase errors and changes to the DNA template
from internal (ROS, for example) and external (radiation,
for example) sources. I will consider only internal sources
because these can be modulated during development.
Changes in DNA can be perceived and acted upon as
needed during development.
Changes in DNA can occur as nucleotide alterations,
insertions/deletions, inversions, and DNA strand breaks.
Those lesions recognized as "damage" can be either
repaired or removed by degrading the DNA [16]. Most
information on the repair of mtDNA comes from yeast
and somatic cells of mammals [17-21], whereas very little

Bendich Biology Direct 2010, 5:42
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/42

is known about mtDNA repair in plants or about cpDNA
repair [22-25]. A detected change in mtDNA is the result
of both the rate of damage and the efficiency of correcting the damage. The power of genetics can sometimes be
used to study each of these parameters separately in
yeast.
Overall, two conclusions seem generally supported.
First, most DNA damage in mitochondria is due to oxidative damage, as may be expected for the site of respiration, and base excision repair (BER) is the main way to
rectify oxidative damage [18,26,27]. If BER fails, human
mtDNA molecules containing the damage are usually
degraded and base substitution (point mutation) is thus
avoided [28]. Degradation of damaged DNA molecules to
avoid mutation is feasible for the high-genome-copy
cytoplasmic organelles, but not for the diploid nucleus.
Such degradation would mask a higher rate of damage in
the organelles than in the nucleus. The second conclusion
is that the capacity to repair stress-induced DNA damage
is lower in mitochondria than the nucleus, because mitochondria are the principal site of ROS production,
employ fewer repair processes than do nuclei, or lack protective histones on their mtDNA molecules [17,18,27,2931]. Damage to organellar DNA is indicated by a rapidly
increasing mutation rate (point mutations per kb of
mtDNA) as mouse tissues age [26], an accumulation of
mtDNA deletions with age in humans, monkeys, and
rodents [17,32], and a decline in structural integrity of
cpDNA molecules as leaves develop (discussed above).
Thus, it would be advantageous to shelter organellar
DNA before tissues mature in the adult.
Quiet and active metabolism

How might a cell achieve quiet metabolism in order to
protect its organellar DNA? Most of our information on
the regulation of mitochondrial biochemistry comes from
yeast (where embryogenesis does not occur) and mammals (where embryogenesis has been intensively investigated). When grown under nutrient-limited conditions,
yeast cells alternate between glycolytic and respiratory
metabolism; they replicate DNA only during glycolysis,
thereby avoiding oxidative stress and DNA damage (only
nuclear DNA was analyzed) [33]. In early mammalian
embryogenesis, "reducing equivalents (or electron
donors) and metabolic intermediates formed during
mitochondrial oxidative reactions are diverted from ATP
production and redistributed to the cell to supply biosynthetic pathways and regenerate antioxidant defence (a
process called mitochondrial anaplerosis)" [34]. I suggest
that anaplerosis may be used to diminish oxidative stress
and maintain metabolic quiescence in germ line cells of
any organism that undergoes development.
The quiescent cells may be fated to become germ cells
by maternally inherited determinants before, or immedi-

ately following, fertilization ("preformation" or "primordial germ cells"), as in amphibians, for example [35]. But
in most animals, including mammals, germ cells are not
observed until later in development and arise as a result
of inductive signals from surrounding tissues ("epigenesis"). Similarly, plant germ cells are derived epigenetically
from quiet cells originating in the shoot apical meristem
[36]. Thus embryogenesis allows germ cells to arise only
from metabolically quiescent cells, either early (preformation) or later (epigenesis) in development.
Establishing a quiet cell may not be mechanistically
complex. The rapid proliferation of mitochondria in yeast
cells can be initiated by TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) signaling [37,38]. A single nuclear DNA regulatory element
has been proposed to control energy genes in both the
nucleus and mitochondrion [39], and an analogous coordination has been proposed for regulating energy production by chloroplasts [40]. The ground or default state
may be energetically quiet mitochondria that are simply
not activated in germ line cells. The colorless proplastids
in angiosperm meristems are in a ground state and would
not experience the cpDNA-damaging conditions created
by photosynthesis in green chloroplasts. Thus, merely
not turning "on" organellar development may passively
reduce the DNA repair burden.
In summary, organellar DNAs could be sequestered
into a germ cell lineage where oxidative stress was
avoided. The DNA repair burden would also be reduced
in somatic cells because some damage to organellar DNA
could be tolerated. The benefit of reduced DNA repair
cost would increase as the number of somatic cells
increases (Fig. 1).
The hypothesis

The transition from unicellular to multicellar organisms
has been analyzed previously [1-4]. My hypothesis concerns a subsequent phase of evolution, when multicellular organisms initiated the process of development that
led to organisms with more than one type of somatic cell.
Three stages are envisioned. The protection from oxidative stress afforded by Sequestration of organellar DNA
conferred a selective advantage that allowed these organisms to persist for a time period during which evolutionary "experiments" in the Opportunity stage provided the
next advances toward more complicated eukaryotes. One
such advance was novel signaling within and between
cells. Although excess ROS can be deleterious, low levels
of ROS are used as signaling molecules during normal
development in animals and plants [41-43], as are reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO)
[44]. Both ROS and RNS can be produced at cytochrome
c oxidase of the electron transport chain in mitochondria,
depending on the oxygen concentration. Superoxide and
NO can react to form peroxynitrite (another RNS), lead-

Figure 1 DNA repair cost during the evolution of development.
The single cell of a protist is metabolically active (A) and generates ROS
and oxidative stress during mitochondrial respiration. Oxidative stress
leads to mtDNA damage that must be fully repaired at a cost of 100. An
organism containing two A cells gains no selective advantage. Conversion of one A cell to a metabolically quiescent (Q) cell reduces the
damage load and repair cost, but this two-celled organism gains no
advantage. If the Q cell acts as a germ cell, the organism gains an advantage by lowering the repair cost in its A cell, even though some Acell mtDNA remains unrepaired and may be degraded. At this point,
many evolutionary "experiments" can occur with multicellular embryos, and those allowing further reduction in cost-per-A-cell gain a large
advantage. For example, the multi-copy nature of mtDNA in humans
provides sufficient mtDNA of "good enough" quality to reach sexual
maturity, after which degenerating mitochondrial function leads to aging symptoms. An analogous scenario can be made for cpDNA.

ing to sophisticated hypoxic signaling between mitochondrion and nucleus and to intercellular signaling [45].
The potential to increase biological complexity by cell-tocell signaling would be greater in organisms with several
types of somatic cells than in organisms with only one
type of somatic cell (see Appendix 1). Another advance
during the Opportunity stage was the creation of a repertoire of cell adhesion molecules to orchestrate cell movements during gastrulation in animals [46]. Advances such
as these provided the biochemical circuitry used in the
final stage, Development, to produce animals and plants.
Although my hypothesis extends only to the point at
which development first appears in an evolutionary lineage, two comments can be made concerning the forms
of development that appeared later. First, the developmental process became more complicated in some lineages (gastrulation in mammals, for example) than others
(no gastrulation in mesozoans [47] or plants where cells

are permanently attached by rigid cell walls). Second, the
"Cambrian explosion" of animal bodyplans [48] may
reflect the success of the protection-by-sequestration of
organellar DNA.
There are other eukaryotic lineages in which morphologically complex organisms may have arisen by this
three-stage process. Within the Phaeophyceae (brown
algae) and Rhodophyta (red algae), a maturation process
leading to an adult with several cell types occurs, but no
structure that resembles the type of embryo found in animals and plants is observed [49]. Mushrooms are the
morphologically most complex fungi [50]. The mature
fruiting body (the "mushroom") is essentially a swollen
version of the much smaller "embryo" without a great
increase in the number of cells, unlike the embryo-adult
relationship in animals and plants. Furthermore, it is
uncertain whether there is only one or more than one
type of somatic cell, and except for the spore-forming
basidia, all cells are totipotent [50]. Phylogenetic analysis
suggests that animals, plants, brown algae, red algae, and
fungi arose independently, with most eukaryotic diversity
represented by microbial protists (protozoa and algae)
[51,52]. Thus the transition from one to more than one
somatic cell type may have occurred several times,
although it is also possible that this transition occurred
only once and the process of development was lost in
protists. These various issues need to be addressed before
deciding whether my hypothesis for the origin of development applies beyond animals and plants.

Testing the hypothesis
The protection-by-sequestration hypothesis specifies
that ROS production will be much lower in germ line
cells than somatic cells of animals and plants. Certain fluorescent dyes can be used to quantify ROS levels in cells
[53]. To overcome the difficulty in obtaining adequate
numbers of germ line cells from mammals, ROS assays
have been conducted with cultured cells. However, metabolic quiescence may be lost during cultivation in vitro
[38]. Plants like maize are well-suited for such tests
because of the relative ease with which meristematic tissue can be obtained directly from the plant [54]. Comparative ROS assays should also be conducted with nonangiospermous land plants and multicellular algae in the
presence and absence of light.
DNA damage leads to mutation. The nucleotide
sequence of organellar genomes should vary minimally
among individual germ line cells, but greater variation
among individual somatic cells would be expected
because their active metabolism should increase the
mutation rate. Single-cell DNA sequencing would provide data to test this prediction.
The ROS assay and single-cell organellar DNA
sequencing could show whether an organism produces

Bendich Biology Direct 2010, 5:42
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/42

embryos with quiet organelles or whether development is
non-embryogenic, as in fruiting bacteria and cellular
slime molds (see Appendix 1). On the other hand, such
analyses may prove inconclusive. In rhododendron, an
evergreen plant, we found DNA in green chloroplasts
from leaves that remained on the branch for each of the
five years that leaves were produced on that branch
(unpublished results from my laboratory). Embryonic
development provides the organism with a way to reduce
the cost of organellar DNA repair in somatic cells (Fig. 1),
but that cost may be incurred in pursuit of an ecological
niche, such as an evergreen lifestyle.

Implications of the hypothesis
It has been suggested that one requirement for somatic
stem cells in mammals is that they be at least bi-potent
(able to produce at least two cell types other than themselves) [55]. Meristematic cells in the shoot apex of angiosperms would qualify as stem cells, using this bi-potency
criterion, but multicellular slime molds and Volvox would
not contain such stem cells (see Appendix 1). One of the
biochemical properties required for stemness to emerge
from a population of cells might be the metabolic quiescence that protects organellar DNA from oxidative stress.
Endosymbiosis led to mitochondria and chloroplasts
and a great increase in cellular complexity. Development
led to animals and plants and a great increase in organismal complexity. As proposed, the origin of development
can be traced to protection of mtDNA and cpDNA. A
seemingly ironic conclusion emerges: organismal complexity arose primarily because the minor fraction of
genes located in cytoplasmic organelles could be protected from the by-products of their own activities.
Another irony is that the advent of development has more
to do with protecting the few organellar genes than the
many nuclear genes.
Appendix 1. Multicellularity and embryonic
development
Not all multicellular organisms experience embryonic
development. A multicellular organism can result from
the association of previously unattached individual cells
(aggregative development) or by growth and division of a
single cell [56]. In animals and plants, the progenitor cell
can be a zygote or a totipotent stem cell, and embryonic
development proceeds as groups of cells differentiate and
form increasingly specialized structures that lead to the
more complex parts of the adult. A macroscopic fruiting
structure containing two cell types, stalk and spore, can
be produced by aggregative development from prokaryotic cells (fruiting myxobacteria [57]) or eukaryotic protist cells (cellular slime molds Dictyostelium and Acrasis
[56]). In aggregative development, cells of different geno-

Page 5 of 8

type can co-aggregate, whereas in embryonic development all cells are clonal. Volvox carteri is a chlorophytic
(green) alga that produces an adult containing only two
cell types: > 2000 somatic cells and ~16 gonidia, asexual
reproductive cells [58]. Each gonidium initiates cleavage
divisions to produce an "embryo" that contains all the
cells that will be present in an adult of the next generation. For animals and plants, the progression from single
cell to adult clearly includes an embryo. Whether V. carteri experiences embryonic development may be a matter
of semantics.
The spore of bacteria and slime molds and the gonidium are specialized reproductive cells produced after
DNA damage has been repaired, and thus the benefit of
protection-by-damage-avoidance is not realized. This
may be an important distinction between embryogenesis
in animals and plants and the type of multicellular development in the other groups. The damage-avoidance benefit may have allowed animals and plants to produce
many cell types, not just the two (somatic and spore/
gonidium) found in the other groups.

John M. Logsdon, Jr., Department of Biology, University of
Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA
This manuscript puts forward a provocative idea to
connect the genesis of embryonic development with the
protection of organellar genome integrity. The hypothesis
is premised strongly on observations that organellar
genomes are highly unstable in most somatic tissues of
animals and plants, with DNA experiencing considerable
degradation from oxidative metabolism. In such (embryonic) organisms, the segregation of the soma and germ
line is posited to provide a protection for organellar DNA
in the metabolically quiescent germ cells. This organelle
sequestration is then hypothesized to be the initial step
eventually leading to what we now recognize as embryogenesis.
Although the author provides an interesting scenario to
connect organelles, germ lines, and embryonic development, I think that an alternative evolutionary sequence
could also underpin the origin of embryogenesis: that
organelle sequestration and its effect on reducing the
mutational burden of organelle genomes was a (perhaps
necessary) consequence of embryogenesis. In other
words, what is cause and what is consequence?

Bendich Biology Direct 2010, 5:42
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/42

Author's response

My hypothesis (let us call it the forward scenario) is that
the advent of development provided a means (organelle
sequestration) to avoid the repair cost necessary to
reduce the mutational burden. As such, this sequence of
events is clearly beneficial, and that benefit can be seen in
the downward flow of events in Figure 1. The reverse scenario (organelle sequestration was "perhaps necessary" to
reduce the mutational burden) implies that the advent of
development created a mutational burden, which then
had to be alleviated by a subsequent invention, sequestration. The reverse scenario begins with a detrimental
event (embryogenesis somehow increased the mutational
burden--but how and why should this happen?) that was
counteracted by the subsequent sequestration of organelles. Since the benefit in the reverse scenario is not
apparent, I do not consider this scenario in the text.
Reviewer's comment

It is unclear if this hypothesis will find resonance in the
organelle and/or embryogenesis literature. However, the
author provides some suggested tests of its implications.
As evolutionary "origins" questions are often very difficult to solve, suggestions like these may be welcome in
the marketplace of ideas.
Reviewer's report 3

Arcady Mushegian, Department of Binformatics, Stowers
Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, MO 64110,
USA
The hypothesis put forward by Bendich in this manuscript states that:
(a) the energy-producing stations of an eukaryotic
cell, i.e., mitochondria and chloroplasts, do their job
at a peril for the integrity of their own DNA, because
of the ROS and their derivatives that are damaging to
DNA;
(b) multicellularity, and later embryonic development, have originated as the adaptations to damage
and loss of organellar DNA, by sequestration in metabolically quiet subset of cells.
Author's response

The assertion in (b) is not correct. My hypothesis
explains the adaptive significance of development, but
not of multicellularity. The adaptive significance of multicellularity was analyzed in detail by others, cited in my
refs [1-4]. My hypothesis begins with existing multicellular organisms and concerns the subsequent advent of the
process of development.
Reviewer's comment

Part (a) seems to be supported by biochemical and cytological evidence lovingly collected by the author from his
own studied and from the literature. These data are very

Page 6 of 8

interesting. As for Part (b), I am less enthusiastic. Indeed,
the advent of multicellularity and the origin of evolutionary development are two different events that may
require different explanations. Moreover, even if relative
protection from DNA damage is a factor in the evolution
of multicellular organisms, it could be an additional benefit, not the main force behind the emergence of either
multicellularity or embryogenesis. Finally, there are many
other suggestions in the literature concerning the origin
of multicellularity and embryogenesis. As any other
hypothesis, this one has to be evaluated both on its own
merits and in comparison with other hypotheses.
Author's response

The main criticism in this comment is that these are two
different events that may require different explanations. I
agree completely with this notion, and the text now
clearly distinguishes multicelluarity from development,
both in time of origin and proposed benefit. Surprisingly,
despite an extensive effort, I could find no explanation in
the literature for why or how development originated and
no proposal for a benefit provided by multicellularityplus-development versus multicellularity. Although it is
possible that protection from DNA damage is "not the
main force behind the emergence of either multicellularity or embryogenesis", there are simply no other explanations I could find in the literature or in discussions with
colleagues.
Reviewer's comment

Specifically, I think three opportunities are missed in this
proposal:
1. Discuss the hypothesis vis-a-vis those that place
more emphasis on stochastic population effects, most
importantly, the line of argument by M. Lynch.
2. Give considerable attention to unicellular eukaryotes, to fungi that may adopt either unicellular or differentiated lifestyle, and to colonial eukaryotes - can
author's hypothesis be tested by examining these
forms that have organelles but lack defined germline
or embryogenesis?
3. Examine the genomic evidence: under the author's
hypothesis, as a first approximation, should the number of genes (or perhaps the number of gene products
per cell) that encode the organellar repair machinery
scale slower than the number of genes in the genome,
or at least lower than the number of nuclear repair
genes?
Author's response

1. As I state above, I could find no other competing
hypotheses concerning the origin of development. I
sent an email to Michael Lynch in which I asked if he
"could direct me to an article by you (or anyone else)
that addresses the benefits of embryonic development

Bendich Biology Direct 2010, 5:42
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/42

that goes beyond the transition from unicell-to-multicell", but I received no response. In searching Lynch's
articles, the one that seemed most relevant was "The
frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity" [PNAS 104:8597-604, 2007]. I have
no disagreement with the arguments in this article.
However, Lynch's arguments and conclusions are not
relevant to my hypothesis.
2. Unicellular and colonial eukaryotes are already discussed in some detail in Appendix 1 and again in the
Testing the hypothesis section. In The hypothesis
section, I consider groups other than animals and
plants, including protists, and conclude that we presently have insufficient information to extend the
hypothesis beyond animals and plants.
3. I have no insight or predictions concerning the
scaling of the number of genes or gene products for
the DNA repair machinery between organelle and
nucleus. Given the brevity with which this issue is
described, I do not know how to respond.
