The proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria
revisited: a genomic comparison

Abstract
Background: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a group of gram-positive, lactic acid producing Firmicutes. They have
been extensively used in food fermentations, including the production of various dairy products. The proteolytic
system of LAB converts proteins to peptides and then to amino acids, which is essential for bacterial growth and
also contributes significantly to flavor compounds as end-products. Recent developments in high-throughput
genome sequencing and comparative genomics hybridization arrays provide us with opportunities to explore the
diversity of the proteolytic system in various LAB strains.
Results: We performed a genome-wide comparative genomics analysis of proteolytic system components,
including cell-wall bound proteinase, peptide transporters and peptidases, in 22 sequenced LAB strains. The
peptidase families PepP/PepQ/PepM, PepD and PepI/PepR/PepL are described as examples of our in silico
approach to refine the distinction of subfamilies with different enzymatic activities. Comparison of protein 3D
structures of proline peptidases PepI/PepR/PepL and esterase A allowed identification of a conserved core
structure, which was then used to improve phylogenetic analysis and functional annotation within this protein
superfamily.
The diversity of proteolytic system components in 39 Lactococcus lactis strains was explored using pangenome
comparative genome hybridization analysis. Variations were observed in the proteinase PrtP and its maturation protein PrtM, in one of the Opp transport systems and in several peptidases between strains from different Lactococcus subspecies or from different origin.
Conclusions: The improved functional annotation of the proteolytic system components provides an excellent
framework for future experimental validations of predicted enzymatic activities. The genome sequence data can be
coupled to other “omics” data e.g. transcriptomics and metabolomics for prediction of proteolytic and flavorforming potential of LAB strains. Such an integrated approach can be used to tune the strain selection process in
food fermentations.

Background
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been used for centuries
as starter or adjunct cultures in dairy fermentations.
The breakdown of milk proteins (proteolysis) by LAB
plays an important role in generating peptides and
amino acids for bacterial growth and in the formation of
metabolites that contribute to flavor formation of fermented products. The proteolytic system of LAB comprises three major components: (i) cell-wall bound
proteinase that initiates the degradation of extracellular
casein (milk protein) into oligopeptides, (ii) peptide

Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands

transporters that take up the peptides into the cell, and
(iii) various intracellular peptidases that degrade the
peptides into shorter peptides and amino acids. In particular, as caseins are rich in proline, LAB have numerous
proline peptidases for degrading proline-rich peptides
[1-3]. Amino acids can be further converted into various
flavor compounds, such as aldehydes, alcohols and
esters [4].
Several reviews have described the proteolytic system
of LAB with respect to their biochemical and genetic
aspects [1,5-8]. In the past ten years, however, many
LAB genomes have been sequenced, which allows a
thorough comparative analysis of their proteolytic systems at a genome scale. In a preliminary study, we

described a comparative analysis of cell-wall-bound proteinase and various peptidases from 13 fully or incompletely sequenced LAB which were publicly available in
May 2006 [9]. More recently, over ten additional LAB
genomes have become publicly available. These include
8 LAB strains from the Joint Genome Institute and the
LAB Genome Consortium [10], the model laboratory
strain Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 [11], a
Lactobacillus helveticus strain [12] which is known for
its proteolytic capacity as an adjunct culture in cheese,
and the probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG
[13]. Furthermore, a recent comparative genome hybridization (CGH) analysis of 39 L. lactis strains [14] provides opportunities to explore the diversity of the
proteolytic system within the same species.
In this study, we systematically explored the diversity
of the cell-wall bound proteinase, the peptidases and the
peptide transporters in twenty-two completely
sequenced LAB strains. The distinctions between subgroups in large peptidase families such as the PepP/
PepQ/PepM family, the PepD family and the PepI/
PepR/PepL family are described in detail as examples.
The PepI/PepR/PepL family was compared with the
EstA family of esterases, the key enzyme for synthesizing
various ester flavors [4,15], since the members of these
two families share sequence and structure homology.
Furthermore, the results from comparative genomics
analysis were used to explore the diversity of members
of the proteolytic system in 39 Lactococcus lactis strains
by pangenome CGH analysis [14].

Methods
Comparative genome analyses and orthologous groups
identification

Complete genome sequences of LAB were obtained
from the NCBI microbial genome database http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi. The genomes
include: Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (abbreviation
LAC, accession code CP000033), Lactobacillus johnsonii
NCC 533 (LJO, AE017198), Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC
33323 (LGA, CP000413), Lactobacillus delbrueckii

(LBU, CP000412), Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1
(LPL, AL935263), Lactobacillus brevis ATCC 367 (LBE,

Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ1066 (STH,
CP000024), Streptococcus thermophilus LMG18311
(STU, CP000023), Streptococcus thermophilus LMD9
(STM, CP000419), Lactobacillus reuteri F275 (LRF,
CP000705), Lactobacillus helveticus DPC 4571 (LHE,
CP000517) and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LRH,
FM179322). Incomplete genome sequences of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains KF147 and KF282 [16]
were additionally used for analysis of L. lactis strain
diversity by pangenome CGH analysis [14].
Protein sequences of experimentally verified proteolytic
system members, i.e. cell-wall bound proteinase, various
peptidases and peptide transporters, were derived from
the non-redundant protein database Uniprot http://www.
uniprot.org/[17]. These sequences were used to perform a
BLASTP [18] search against all LAB genomes. The corresponding Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of each protein family were obtained from the Pfam database [19] and
utilized to search for homologous genes using the
HMMER 2.3.2 package http://hmmer.janelia.org/. The
homologous sequences of each proteinase, peptidase and
peptide transporter were collected on basis of the BLAST
and HMM search results and redundancies were removed.
Orthologous groups (subfamilies) were identified by an inhouse developed method [4,20]. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were generated for each homologous group
using MUSCLE [21]. Bootstrapped (n = 1000) neighborjoining family trees were constructed with ClustalW [22].
The trees were visualized in LOFT [23] and orthologous
groups were identified. The gene contexts were analyzed
using the ERGO Bioinformatics Suite [24] to improve
ortholog prediction when necessary.
3D structure alignment

Peptidases PepI/PepR/PepL and esterase EstA belong to
the same protein superfamily, but they possess different
functionalities. In order to identify substrate specificity
of each protein subfamily, a comparison of known protein 3D structures was carried out. As described above,
protein sequences of experimentally characterized peptidases PepI, PepR, and PepL, together with EstA
esterases were used to search against all the sequenced
LAB genomes and other prokaryote genomes in the
NCBI database by BLASTP [18]. Moreover, the HMM
of the protein a/b hydrolase fold PF00561 from the
Pfam database [19], to which PepI/PepR/PepL and EstA
belong, was used to search against LAB genomes.
Homologs of both PepI/PepR/PepL and EstA families
were collected. Similarly, the protein sequences of
experimentally verified PepI/PepR/PepL and EstA members were used for BLAST searches against the PDB
database http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/[25]. The protein
sequences, as well as the 3D structures of the best
BLAST hits were collected. Other proteins with similar
structures were retrieved by the Dali server http://

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/36

ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_server/ using the protein structures of the BLAST hits as input.
The retrieved 3D structures of the proteins used as
templates in this study are: the tricorn interacting factor
F1 with proline iminopeptidase (PIP) activity from Thermoplasma acidophilum (PDB ID: 1MTZ), proline iminopeptidases from Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri (PDB
ID: 1AZW) and Serratia marcescens (PDB ID: 1WM1)
as members of PepI/R/L subfamilies, and the esterase
(PDB ID: 2UZ0) from Streptococcus pneumoniae which
belongs to the EstA subfamily. These 3D structures
were superimposed and visualized by the YASARA program (version 6.813, http://www.yasara.org/). Conserved
superimposable regions (core regions) of the catalytic
domain were identified based on the 3D-structure alignment, and these consisted of 4 discontinuous sequence
segments that are connected by loops of variable
structure.
The amino acid sequences of the four core region segments were aligned with MUSCLE or ClustalW as
described [26]. The alignments were manually curated
for ambiguously aligned sequences compared to the 3Dstructure alignment. Sequences with more than 90%
identity were removed. Finally, a MSA was constructed
based on concatenated alignments of all the curated
local alignments of the core regions [see Additional File
1]. A bootstrapped (n = 1000) neighbor-joining tree on
basis of the MSA was constructed and orthologous
groups, so-called subfamilies, were identified automatically by LOFT.
Pangenome CGH diversity analysis

Comparative genome hybridization (CGH) data of 39 L.
lactis strains was acquired from pangenome arrays [14].
The pangenome array was constructed on basis of publicly available complete genome sequences of L. lactis
subsp. lactis IL1403, L. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11, and
incomplete genome sequences of L. lactis strains KF147
and KF282, as described by Bayjanov et al. [14]. The
CGH data used in this study can be found under the
accession number GSE12638 in the NCBI GEO (NCBI
Gene Expression Omnibus) database http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE12638.
The genes encoding predicted proteolytic system components of the three sequenced L. lactis strains were
used to query the database containing pangenome CGH
data. We obtained a statistical score of the hybridization
signal for each gene from the reference strains against
39 L. lactis strains. A cut-off value 5.5 was used to
assign presence or absence of every gene from the proteolytic system in query strains, as described by Bayjanov et al. [14]. In most cases, a gene is regarded present
in a specific strain if it has a maximum score higher
than 5.5 [14].

Results
The distribution of proteolytic system components in
sequenced LAB genomes

An overview of the distribution of components of the
proteolytic system identified in 22 completely sequenced
LAB is given in Figure 1. A detailed list of genes with
GI codes can be found in Additional File 2. The number
of genes encoding putative members of each proteinase,
peptide transporter and peptidase subfamily are shown.
The LAB genomes in the L. acidophilus group [4],
including L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. gasseri, L. bulgaricus, and L. helveticus strains, encode a relatively
higher number and variety of proteolytic system components. Some enzymes are only found in a few LAB
strains, such as the cell-wall bound proteinase (PrtP).
PrtP was only found on the chromosome of L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. rhamnosus and
S. thermophilus strain LMD9, as well as on the plasmid
of L. lactis subsp. cremoris SK11 [27]. Members of both
the PepE/PepG (endopeptidases) and PepI/PepR/PepL
(proline peptidases) superfamilies are absent in lactococci
and streptococci. On the other hand, many of the peptidases seem to be essential for bacterial growth or survival
as they are encoded in all LAB genomes. For instance,
aminopeptidases PepC, PepN, and PepM, and proline
peptidases PepX and PepQ are present in all genomes,
usually with one gene per genome. Some LAB genomes
have two peptidase homologs, possibly with the same
function (shown in brackets in Figure 1), e.g. two PepC
homologs (GI codes: 42518641 and 42518638) in L. johnsonii. Other essential peptidases (found in all LAB genomes) such as endopeptidase PepO and dipeptidase
PepV are encoded by multiple paralogous genes.
L. acidophilus, L. brevis, L. casei, L. rhamnosus and L.
lactis strains possess all three known LAB peptide transport systems, i.e. the di/tripeptide Dpp and DtpT systems and the oligopeptide Opp system [5]. In contrast,
L. reuteri strain only has one functional peptide transport system, the DtpT system. Several peptide transporters or peptidases fall into larger protein superfamilies.
Examples are (i) the oligopeptide-binding protein OppA
and di/tripeptide-binding proteins DppA/DppP in the
same peptide-binding protein family, (ii) aminopeptidase
PepC together with endopeptidases PepE and PepG
belonging to MEROPS peptidase family C1-B, (iii) proline peptidases PepI, PepR and PepL belonging to MEROPS family S33, and (iv) aminopeptidase PepM together
with proline peptidases PepP and PepQ belonging to
MEROPS family M24 (Figure 1). Protein members in
those large superfamilies share high sequence similarity,
and cannot always be distinguished by simple BLAST
sequence homology searches. Using a comparative genomics approach, the large protein families can be divided

genes is indicated. MEROPS families are indicated for proteinase and peptidases. Color shading shows absence of a gene (white), a single gene

into subfamilies with putatively different substrate specificities. For example, the aminopeptidase PepC subfamily can be clearly distinguished from the endopeptidase
PepE/PepG subfamily as they are separated into distinct
groups in a superfamily tree [9]. In other cases, such as
the endopeptidase PepF family, several distinct subgroups can be distinguished but the difference in specificity between the subgroups is still unclear [see
Additional File 3].
Three large peptidase families (PepP/PepQ/PepM,
PepD and PepI/PepR/PepL) will be discussed in detail in
the following sections.
Subfamilies of peptidase family PepP/PepQ/PepM

PepP, PepQ and PepM belong to the MEROPS peptidase family M24 which requires metal ions for catalytic
activity. PepM is a methionyl aminopeptidase cleaving
N-terminal methionine from proteins. PepP is a member
of the proline peptidases which cleave off any N-terminal amino acid linked to proline in an oligopeptide.
PepQ is also a proline peptidase, however specific for

Xaa-Pro dipeptides, where Xaa represents any amino
acid (Figure 1)
Our phylogenetic analysis shows that PepP, PepQ and
PepM are separated into three distinct subgroups in
accordance with the known different substrate specificities of each peptidase (Figure 2). PepP and PepQ seem
to be more closely related than PepM on the basis of
the family tree, which is in agreement with the differences in their catalytic activities. Bacterial PepM is an
aminopeptidase belonging to subfamily M24A which
usually requires cobalt ions for catalysis, while PepP and
PepQ as proline peptidases belong to the subfamily
M24B which prefers manganese [1].
In the PepP subgroup, one gene is found in each LAB
genome except in L. sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus.
The absence of the pepP genes in both genomes is very
likely due to a gene loss event. The family tree also
includes an experimentally verified pepP gene from L.
lactis whose protein product has been purified and characterized [28]. Moreover, LAB-derived pepP genes are

organism abbreviations are followed by GI codes. Homologs from two non-LAB strains are also included, CBO for Clostridium botulinum F str.

always flanked on the chromosome by a gene encoding
an elongation factor for protein translation. The conserved gene context of pepP among LAB genomes is
consistent with the putative important physiological role
of PepP in protein maturation, as suggested by Matos et
al. [28].
Genes from the PepQ cluster are distributed equally in
all LAB genomes, generally as one copy per genome.
However, the L. delbrueckii bulgaricus strains have two
pepQ paralogs. One paralog is clustered with the other
orthologs of LAB, whereas the second paralog is located
in a separate cluster (LBU_116514595 and
LDB_104774485). This might be the result of an ancient
duplication (Figure 2) or horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
event. Rantanen et al. suggested that the second paralogous pepQ of L. bulgaricus is a cryptic gene [29]. Experimentally characterized pepQ genes from L. delbrueckii
bulgaricus [30] and L. helveticus (GI: 3282339) are
added and highlighted in the tree, supporting the annotation of the subgroups.
In the aminopeptidase PepM subgroup, L. brevis has
an extra paralogous gene, which clusters together with
the L. plantarum pepM gene. Gene context analysis suggests that pepM genes in all Lactobacillus strains share
the same neighbor genes, except the pepM gene from L.
plantarum and both the paralogs from L. brevis. One of
the L. brevis pepM genes (LBE_116334483) is located in
the same operon as a transposase. Based on the protein
family tree, we hypothesize that an extra pepM gene was
acquired first in the ancestor of L. brevis and L. plantarum, after which one gene was lost from L. plantarum. The L. plantarum pepM gene (LPL_28377183) is
flanked by a methionine metabolism related operon
(cysK_cblB/cglB_cysE). Therefore, the pepM gene in L.
plantarum may have a broader function, probably utilizing proteins and peptides as methionine pool, in addition to the classic PepM function for N-terminal
maturation of proteins.
One gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides
(LME_116618966) is located as an intermediate between
the PepP/PepQ and PepM subfamilies. It shares higher
sequence homology with a putative pepP gene from
Clostridium botulinum (Figure 2) and has a phagerelated gene in its neighborhood. This suggests that the
pepP gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides might be
acquired from clostridia.
Subfamilies of peptidase family PepD

The PepD dipeptidase family has a broad specificity
toward various dipeptides [1]. PepD has been purified
and characterized from L. helveticus by Vesanto et al.
[31]. The pepD genes are distributed heterogeneously in
LAB genomes, varying from 0 to 6 paralogs. The pepD
gene is absent in Leuconostoc mesenteroides and truncated in S. thermophilus strains, while multiple genes

Page 6 of 15

are mainly observed in Lactobacillus genomes (Figure
1). Recently, Smeianov et al. reported the expression
level of four pepD genes from L. helveticus CNRZ32 by
a microarray analysis [32]. Five major PepD subfamilies
can be clearly distinguished based on the multiple
sequence alignment (Figure 3). PepD1-4 are assigned
with the names according to the four pepD genes from
L. helveticus [32]. Due to the lack of experimental evidence, it is still unclear whether the substrate specificities vary between those subfamilies. Microarray analysis
of L. helveticus has shown that pepD1, pepD2 and
pepD4 were up-regulated in MRS medium compared to
growth in milk, while pepD3 was not differentially
expressed in both media [31]. It suggests that differences
between subgroups of pepD1/pepD2/pepD4 and pepD3
could also be on the level of transcription regulation.
Moreover, several genes are located as intermediate
between the major PepD subgroups in the superfamily
tree. Most of those genes have unclear origins and functions. The protein sequences of LCA_116493607 from
L. casei, LRH_258507036 from L. rhamnosus,
LJO_42518640 from L. johnsonii, and LBU_116514855
from L. bulgaricus have best BLASTP hits to several
recently sequenced lactobacilli, such as L. hilgardii and
L. buchneri, suggesting a possible duplication of the
gene in a specific Lactobacillus group.
3D-structure comparison to distinguish PepI/PepR/PepL
peptidases from EstA family esterases

The proline iminopeptidase PepI possesses aminopeptidase activity toward N-terminal proline peptides, preferably tri-peptides, while prolinase PepR has a broad
specificity for dipeptides including Pro-Xaa dipeptides
[1]. The only characterized PepL is from L. delbrueckii
subsp. lactis DSM7290 and it displays high specificity
for di-/tri- peptides with N-terminal leucine residues
[33]. Interestingly, the PepI/PepR/PepL family and the
esterase EstA family belong to the same a/b hydrolase
superfamily, since the BLASTP analysis of PepI/PepR/
PepL members against the non-redundant protein database also retrieves homologs from the EstA family. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the whole protein
sequences of the homologs from those two protein
families is not reliable, as large insertions and deletions
are present in these sequences, and several regions of
the proteins share very low sequence similarity. Therefore, we first compared the 3D structures of four representative proteins by superposition, including proline
iminopeptidases from Thermoplasma acidophilum (PDB
ID: 1MTZ) [34], Xanthomonas campestris pv. citri (PDB
ID: 1AZW) [35], and Serratia marcescens (PDB ID:
1WM1) [36] as members from the PepI/R/L family, and
an esterase A (PDB ID: 2UZ0) from Streptococcus pneumoniae [37] as a member from the EstA subfamily (Figure 4). The superimposed 3D structures share a highly

similar catalytic domain, which displays a typical canonical a/b hydrolase topology consisting of an eightstranded b-sheet, and have a non-conserved cap domain.
Four conserved structural regions in the catalytic
domain, separated by variable loops, were identified
based on the structure alignment. A detailed comparison
of the residues of the catalytic site and substrate-binding
region can be found in Additional File 4. In contrast,
the cap domain shows a large structural variation, and
the esterase EstA has a much smaller cap domain than
the peptidases (Figure 4). The cap regions of peptidases
cover and close the substrate-binding region, allowing
only the N-terminal proline of a peptide to fit into the
substrate-binding pocket.
A MSA of the concatenated sequences of the four
conserved structural regions of the PepI/PepR/PepL and
EstA superfamily members from various microorganisms
was constructed and manually curated [See Additional
File 1]. On basis of the curated MSA, a much improved
superfamily tree was constructed for the PepI/PepR/
PepL and EstA families, including LAB and other bacteria, as well as the reference proteins with known 3D
structures (Figure 5). In this 3D alignment tree, the
homologs of the superfamily can be clearly separated
into four subclusters (Figure 5). The first cluster PepIa
contains the proline iminopeptidases from Proteobacteria and non-LAB Firmicutes, including the ones from
the known structures 1AZW and 1WM1. The second
cluster contains the esterase members from LAB,
including the representative structure 2UZ0 from S.
pneumoniae. The third cluster PepIb contains proline
iminopeptidases from Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria,
and PepI from Firmicutes (including the ones from
LAB), as well as the known structure 1MTZ from Thermoplasma acidophilum. The last cluster PepR/L consists
of putative PepL proteins from LAB and the subgroup
of prolinase PepR. Experimentally verified proteins PepR
from L. helveticus CNRZ32 [38,39], PepI from L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CNRZ 397 [40,41], PepL from
L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis DSM7290 [33] and EstA
from L. lactis [42] and L. casei BL23 [43] also support
this subdivision within the protein superfamily (Figure
5). Moreover, PepI from L. helveticus strain 53/7 has
also been experimentally characterized [44].
Sequenced lactococcal, streptococcal, leuconostoc and
L. salivarius strains lack the genes encoding proline
peptidases PepI, PepR or PepL. This agrees with the
observation from gene deletion experiments in strains
harboring those peptidase genes that the physiological
role of PepI, PepR or PepL is not essential for cell
growth [39,45,46]. However, in L. helveticus, the growth
rate in milk was slower for a PepI-deletion mutant as
compared to the wild type [45]. Similarly, the activity of
cell extract of L. helveticus and L. rhamnosus toward

Page 8 of 15

several proline dipeptides was significantly reduced in a
PepR-deletion mutant [39,46]. Those observations suggest that PepI/PepR/PepL may contribute specifically to
the proteolytic capacity on proline-containing peptides
of Lactobacillus strains.
Diversity of the proteolytic system in L. lactis strains

The distribution of proteolytic system components in
various L. lactis strains was studied by comparative genome hybridization (CGH) analysis. PanGenome arrays
were made based on ORFs found in four sequenced L.
lactis strains, and subsequently used to determine the
presence or absence of orthologs in 39 L. lactis strains
[14]. Table 1 summarizes only the proteolytic system
genes with variable absence/presence patterns in the 39
L. lactis strains. All other components described in Figure 1 but not shown in Table 1, such as PepC, PepN,
PepM, PepA, PepD, PepV, PepT, PepP, PepQ, DtpT and
most members of the Dpp system, are present in almost
all strains. PepE/PepG and PepI/PepR/PepL family
members are absent in all L. lactis strains. Those genes
are excluded from the table, as well as all genes of
strains P7304 and P7266 (see explanation in Table
legend). Some plant-derived L. lactis strains such as
KF24, NIZOB2244W, LMG9446 and KW10 have the
largest set of proteolytic system genes.
Variations are found for proteinase PrtP and its
maturation protein PrtM, for peptidases Pcp, PepO2,
PepF2 and PepX2, and for genes from peptide transport
systems Opp and Dpp (Table 1). Most of these genes
are known to be present on plasmids [27]: in strain
SK11 the prtP, prtM and pcp genes are located on one
large plasmid, while the pepO2, pepF2 and oppABCDF2
are co-localized on a different plasmid. The co-presence
or co-absence of these genes in other L. lactis strains
(Table 1), is largely consistent with their coupling in
SK11, and suggests that variability is mainly due to the
presence or absence of the plasmids. Cell-wall bound
proteinase PrtP together with PrtM are mainly present
in L. lactis subsp. cremoris, although several L. lactis
subsp. lactis strains also harbor these genes (including
dairy strains e.g. UC317, ML8, and ATCC19435T).
PepX2 is a PepX homolog of L. lactis subsp. lactis
IL1403. It is mainly found in L. lactis subsp. lactis
strains from dairy origin. This putative pepX2 gene was
originally annotated as a hypothetical protein named
YmgC. It contains both a C-terminal domain of X-prolyl
dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and a Peptidase_S15 catalytic
domain which are usually found in PepX, whereas the
PepX N-terminal domain is missing in PepX2. No
experimental evidence for the enzyme activity of PepX2
is known. The family tree of PepX shows that this putative pepX2 gene is not clustered in the same orthologous group as its paralogous gene from L. lactis subsp.
lactis IL1403 [Additional File 5]. The only members of

Asp. The active site is enlarged and rotated by about 180 degrees relative to Panel A. A short stretch of the cap region in both peptidases is
shown, bearing the Glu residues that interact with the positive charge of the peptide substrate N-terminus. Note that the side chains of the two
Glu residues superpose very well, despite coming from different (non-superposable) parts of the cap region.

the PepX2 (YmgC) group in sequenced LAB genomes
are from L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 and Pediococcus.
Their best BLAST hits against the non-redundant protein database are from Listeria monocytogenes, suggesting a HGT event [See Additional File 5].

Discussion
In this study, we performed a systematic genome-wide
analysis of all the proteins involved in proteolysis,
including cell-wall bound proteinase, peptide

transporters, and peptidases, from twenty-two fully
sequenced LAB genomes, including Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc strains. The comparative genomics analysis was
shown to distinguish various subgroups within a protein
superfamily, allowing a highly improved annotation of
genes and clarification caused by inconsistent
annotation.
This information on the distribution of the proteolytic
system genes can be used to predict the proteolytic

potential of various LAB strains. For instance, L. bulgaricus and L. helveticus have a very extensive set of proteolytic enzymes, which is consistent with previous
knowledge that L. bulgaricus serves as the proteolytic
organism in yoghurt rather than S. thermophilus [47]. L.
helveticus is a proteolytic cheese adjunct culture that
has been used to degrade bitter peptides in cheese [48].
Interestingly, L. bulgaricus encodes the Dpp system with
preference for uptake of hydrophobic di/tripeptides,
complementing S. thermophilus which encodes the general di/tripeptide transporter DtpT in its genome,

suggesting that more peptides can be utilized by both
bacteria when grown together. LAB species of plant origin, such as L. plantarum, O. oeni, and Leuconostoc
mesenteroides, encode less proteolytic enzymes in their
genomes, which agrees with their ecological niche that
is fiber-rich but contains less proteins.
Several examples have been provided for the division
of large superfamilies into subfamilies. Clear separation
of major subgroups can be observed from the family
trees. By including the experimentally characterized
genes, different substrate specificities can be assigned to

a. Two Lactococcus strains P7304 and P7266 are not shown in this table since they are grouped separately from other strains phylogenetically [53] and present a distinct pattern of presence and absence of
proteolytic genes. For instance, PepC, PepA, PepO, PepF, PepV, PepX, and PepP appear to be absent in these two strains, but this could also be the result of poor hybridization due to lower sequence homology.
? The score of the signal is not significant enough to conclude the presence or absence of a gene. Most of the assignments of absence/presence are assumed based on coexistence patterns of genes, e.g. PrtP and
PrtM, or OppABCDF are usually encoded in the same operons, thus should be all present or all absent in the genomes. In these cases, a stricter cut-off value for deciding the presence of a gene (5.6-5.7 instead of
5.5) is used.

various subfamilies. The PepP/PepQ/PepM and PepI/
PepR/PepL superfamilies include subfamilies with distinct substrate specificities. The general dipeptidase
superfamily PepD consists of several distinct orthologous groups of which the substrate specificities are still
unknown. In most cases, the prediction of orthologous
groups and the evolutionary events leading to the variation of substrate specificities are straight-forward using
the phylogenetic analysis. However, some orphan genes
are present as intermediate groups between the subfamilies with unknown functions and some of them may originate from HGT events.
Peptidases PepI/R/L and the esterase EstA, which is
also involved in flavor-formation by LAB, belong to the
same a/b hydrolase superfamily. We performed a comparative analysis of 3D structures of representative proteins from each subfamily in order to identify the core
regions of the enzymes and to improve the multiple
sequence alignment of the superfamily. Orthologs could
then be identified more clearly in the protein family tree
as constructed on basis of the curated MSA of the core
regions. The classic catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp of the a/
b hydrolase family is conserved in most of the members
of the PepI/R/L and EstA superfamily. However, in the
PepR subfamily of LAB (Figure 5), the catalytic Asp residues are substituted by Glu residues. Aspartate and glutamate residues are chemically equivalent and differ
only in length of the side chain. The substitution of Asp
by Glu has been observed in prokaryotic subtilases [49],
as well as in an acetylcholinesterase of Torpedo californica and a lipase of Geotrichum candidum [50,51].
Moreover, two additional peptidases from L. plantarum
and L. casei (LPL_28379307 and LCA_116494294)
which are not grouped into the PepR subfamily (Figure
5) also have glutamate catalytic residues instead of
aspartate residues. It suggests that the substitution of
Asp to Glu may have happened in the common ancestor
of these two proteins and the PepR family. Since the
glutamate residue at the catalytic triad is only found to
be conserved in the PepR subfamily, it can be used as
an extra indication for determining whether a peptidase
with unclear function belongs to the PepR subfamily.
One of the applications of our comparative analysis is
to explore the diversity of proteolytic system genes in
various strains of L. lactis by combining the results from
comparative genomics analysis and the hybridization
data from pangenome CGH analysis. Distinct patterns
were found in the presence and absence of proteolytic
enzymes in the two L. lactis subspecies, i.e. subsp. lactis
and subsp. cremoris, confirming the proteolytic diversity
between the subspecies, and now providing a genetic
basis for this diversity. Several strains show corresponding distributions of some proteolytic genes in their genomes, presumably resulting from the presence or

Page 13 of 15

absence of plasmids encoding proteolytic system
components.

Conclusions
We performed a genome-wide comparative study on the
proteolytic system of LAB, and demonstrated that the
functional annotation of proteolytic system genes can be
improved by combining phylogeny, synteny and literature. Examples of the PepP/PepQ/PepM family, the
PepD family and the PepI/PepR/PepL family elucidated
that protein subfamilies with distinct substrate specificities can be identified. In the case of the PepI/PepR/PepL
family, protein 3D-structure alignment allowed us to
more clearly distinguish the peptidase subfamilies and
an esterase family EstA. Moreover, the complete distribution of proteolytic system components in various
sequenced LAB strains was obtained.
The diversity of proteolytic system genes from 39 Lactococcus strains was explored using CGH analysis. Several components including proteinase, oligopeptide
transport system and peptidases were shown to be distributed unevenly among the Lactococcus strains. The
presence or absence of those proteolytic system components are probably the result of the presence or absence
of plasmids that encode them.
Knowledge of the variations in proteolytic system
components may allow the prediction of proteolytic and
flavor-forming potential of bacterial strains, and could
direct future experimental tests into the phenotypes of
various LAB. Ultimately, this knowledge could be used
to improve the sensory characteristics of dairy and other
fermented food products by supporting the strain selection process.
