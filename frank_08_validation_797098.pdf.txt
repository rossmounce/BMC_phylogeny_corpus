Abstract
Background: Gene family identification from ESTs can be a valuable resource for analysis of
genome evolution but presents unique challenges in organisms for which the entire genome is not
yet sequenced. We have developed a novel gene family identification method based on negative
selection patterns (NSP) between family members to screen EST-generated contigs. This strategy
was tested on five known gene families in Arabidopsis to see if individual paralogs could be
identified with accuracy from EST data alone when compared to the actual gene sequences in this
fully sequenced genome.
Results: The NSP method uniquely identified family members in all the gene families tested. Two
members of the FtsH gene family, three members each of the PAL, RF1, and ribosomal L6 gene
families, and four members of the CAD gene family were correctly identified. Additionally all ESTs
from the representative contigs when checked against MapViewer data successfully identify the
gene locus predicted.
Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness of the NSP strategy in identifying specific gene
family members in Arabidopsis using only EST data and we describe how this strategy can be used
to identify many gene families in agronomically important crop species where they are as yet
undiscovered.

Background
A significant proportion of genes that make up a genome
are part of larger families of related genes resulting from
duplications of individual genes [1], genomic segments
[2], or even whole genomes ([3,4]. The accumulation of
mutations in duplicates (paralogs) leads to either loss of

function for one (death), altered function (subfunctionalization), or a new function (neofunctionalization). The
study of the molecular processes by which functional
innovation occurs interests not only evolutionary biologists, but protein engineers and medical and agricultural
biologists. A clearer understanding of the extent to which

gene families contribute to the selected traits in our most
important crop species will help guide decisions regarding
future improvements. Many studies are aimed at the
diversity of function, expression, and regulation among
gene family members in many species (reviewed in [5]).
Others have spawned computational methods to analyze
and predict the evolution of gene families in a phylogenetic context [6] or determine clinically relevant sites in a
protein sequence where amino acid replacements are
likely to have a significant effect on phenotype, including
those that may cause genetic diseases [7].
Therefore, it is not surprising that research aimed at the
identification of specific gene families and their constituent members has proliferated in the last few decades.
Although experimental approaches using degenerate
primers for PCR and oligofingerprinting [8] and cDNA
library screening [9] generally produce the most reliable
results, they can be time consuming and labor-intensive.
Many strategies of gene family identification are computational approaches that take advantage of database mining
and analysis tools to increase the capability and improve
the efficiency of dealing with large amounts of sequenced
data. Naturally, if a significant amount of a genome is
sequenced computational methods can be somewhat
more exhaustive in their search and identification [1015]. However, complete genomic data is available for only
a limited number of species. Expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) on the other hand, are short, unedited, randomly
selected single-pass sequences. They can be easily and
inexpensively obtained directly from cDNA libraries.
Although they were initially used for human gene discovery [16,17], exponential growth in the generation and
accumulation of EST data for many diverse organisms has
occurred in the last decade. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) has a database for ESTs
from over 1300 species totaling more than 48 million
ESTs (as of 14 December 2007). Sixty-three species have
more than 100,000 ESTs in the database making computational analyses more fruitful but complex. Because the
number of ESTs in databases is increasing, computational
techniques, including BLAST and its variants for comparative analysis and CAP3 [18] for sequence assembly, can
be used to speed up gene or gene family identification
processes and improve the feasibility of extracting meaningful information from a large and redundant database
[19] when parameters are properly selected. These ESTbased gene family identification strategies are valuable in
species without fully sequenced genomes [20,21]. Caution must be exercised when assembling contigs from EST
sequences because contigs not representative of real genes
can result from chimera formation during cDNA cloning,
errors in single-pass high-throughput sequencing of ESTs,
or similarity between protein domains of unrelated
sequences. Our group has developed a simple but novel

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S9/S2

method using evidence of negative selection pressure during divergence of the coding sequences to filter artifactual
contigs from those potentially representing actual gene
family members. Molecular evolution researchers studying divergence between well-characterized orthologs or
paralogs often employ an estimation of the number of
synonymous base substitutions per synonymous site versus the number of nonsynonymous base substitutions per
nonsynonymous site [22,23]. A dS/dN ratio > 1 indicates
purifying or negative selection (lower fitness) that tends
to keep amino acid sequences the same if changes were
deleterious. A ratio equal to 1 indicates changes that were
neutral to fitness, while a dS/dN ratio < 1 would indicate
adaptive or positive selection presumably because natural
selection favored the amino acid changes. Differences
between contigs that are artifactual should be proportionally distributed among synonymous and nonsynonymous
sites, whereas differences between contigs that represent
paralogs will often exhibit negative selection, dS/dN > 1.
We understand that negative selection may not be uniform over entire coding regions even assuming that purifying selection was at work in a given gene family. And not
all gene families will exhibit negative selection between
members. However, we believe that the number of gene
families that can be detected by this approach is significant. Evidence has been found for a model whereby complementary deleterious mutations in regulatory elements
between duplicate genes partitions the original function
resulting in sub-functions [24]. It has also been discovered
that the number of shared regulatory elements between
duplicated genes in yeast decreases with evolutionary time
[25]. The age of the duplicates was estimated by the accumulation of synonymous substitutions in the coding
regions. Clearly, some forms of subfunctionalization can
occur by changes in regulatory elements whereby some
degree of negative selection has maintained protein function. Coding regions of paralogs that have subfunctionalized via changes to regulatory elements should exhibit a
bias toward synonymous substitutions. In plants, a significantly greater proportion of genes belong to gene families
than in animals or other major taxa [26]. Either gene
duplication events have been more common in plants, or
more duplicates have been retained during the evolutionary history of plants [27]. If this is the case, there should
exist a significant number of gene families that can be
identified by a bias toward synonymous substitutions
when contigs are assembled from a significantly large
database of ESTs. We have demonstrated previously that a
simple strategy to detect negative selection patterns (NSP)
among assembled ESTs provides a good screen for real
versus artifactual contigs [28]. We have modified the filtering criterion to an empirically determined dS/dN
threshold and decided to test the negative selection pattern (NSP) strategy on an EST database for which a large

percentage of the ESTs have already been mapped to a
fully-sequenced genome, Arabidopsis thaliana.
In this article we demonstrate the NSP strategy and report
how well it was able to identify ESTs representing distinct
family members in a genome where it is testable.

Methods
Gene family identification by NSP method
The five gene families chosen to validate the NSP strategy
were, eukaryotic release factor 1 (RF1), ribosomal protein
L6 (L6), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and an FtsH protease
(FtsH). One member of the selected gene family was chosen as query for a tblastn search of the Arabidopsis thaliana
dbEST. All hits with an E value < 1 × 10-10 (maximum of
150 sequences) were selected and the resulting EST
sequences were assembled using a contig assembly program (AssemblyLIGN, Oxford Molecular) with 100%
match over a minimum 100 nucleotide overlap. The largest open reading frame greater than 100 codons was identified in each resulting non-singleton contig (MacVector,
Accelrys). Open reading frames were translated and the
resulting polypeptides aligned using ClustalX. The
PAL2NAL program [29] produced a codon alignment of
all contig open reading frames, and the SNAP program
[30] at http://www.hiv.lanl.gov was used to calculate dS/
dN for all pairwise comparisons of contig open reading
frames.

The empirically determined threshold for dS/dN was set
to 2.00 and all pairs of contigs with a dS/dN ratio greater
than this were classified as putative paralogs. A graph was
constructed using vertices to represent contigs, and edges
to represent whether pairs of contigs are putative paralogs.
In such a graph, the largest fully connected sub-graph (the
maximum clique) will be made up of vertices that represent markers (contigs) to the members of the same gene
family as the query protein. This sub-graph was determined using a brute-force algorithm. A brute-force algorithm works by checking every possible sub-graph for
connectedness. This operation is computationally expensive, and its time complexity increases exponentially, as
the factorial of the number of vertices. Fortunately, the
contigs that these vertices represent are usually quite few
in number. Some contigs can also be excluded from the
graph since they do not pass the dS/dN threshold to pair
with any other contig. This can be observed in Figure 1
where only 5 pairwise comparisons of contigs obtained a
dS/dN of more than 2.00.
Figure 1 shows the dS/dN ratios between contigs generated using the PAL1 gene as the protein query. Note that
there are two maximum cliques in this graph. When there
are more than one maximum cliques, we arbitrarily

choose one of these cliques. The contigs represented by
the vertices belonging to this clique are then identified as
members of the same gene family. Any vertices that are
not part of this clique are classified as either a possible
marker to a distinct gene, or as a duplicate marker to an
identified gene family member (in the maximum clique)
which was different enough to be assembled into a different contig. In the case of Contig3 and Contig9 from Figure
1, it was found that these contigs were extremely similar
to each other. They were later found to be duplicate markers to the PAL4 gene.
The representative contig for each putative gene family
member identified was then compared to each of the
actual gene family member sequences (NCBI) using
bl2seq [31] to determine how closely contigs filtered
through NSP represented the gene family. Either all or a
subset of ESTs from each NSP-identified contig were
checked on MapViewer (NCBI) to determine if ESTs from
the same contig mapped to different gene family members
or if ESTs from different contigs mapped to the same gene
family member.

Results
Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene family
The tblastn search of using AtPAL1 protein as query
resulted in ESTs and contigs reported previously [28].
Here we report the refinement of using dS/dN ratio rather
than a tally of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd position differences as well
as the MapViewer results that validate the accuracy of gene
family member identification. The dS/dN data for the
assembled contigs are shown in Table 1 and the resulting

SNAP output results for all 21 pairwise comparisons of 7 contigs in which an ORF was identified. A ds/dn value greater than 2.00 was chosen as
threshold to indicate contigs that potentially represent distinct gene family members.

maximum clique graph indicating putative paralog relationships is shown in Figure 1. The 2.0 dS/dN threshold
was established empirically by dS/dN measurements
among actual members of several Arabidopsis gene families. Pairwise comparison of contigs 1, 3, and 4 with the
actual Arabidopsis gene sequences, reported previously
[28] indicate that these three contigs represent AtPAL1,
AtPAL4, and AtPAL2, respectively with greater than 96%
similarity. The contigs selected by NSP as representative of
real gene family members were further validated by checking to see if each EST comprising a single contig is
assigned to a single gene family member on the Arabidopsis genome by NCBI MapViewer. Table 2 shows that all
ESTs that comprise a single contig map to the same gene
locus and confirms that contigs 1, 3, and 4 represent the
PAL1, PAL4, and PAL2 genes of Arabidopsis, respectively.
For the following four additional NSP-identified gene
families only the validating data is shown, not the dS/dN
data or maximum clique graphs.
Ribosomal protein L6 gene family
AtRPL6A protein was used as query for the tblastn search
of A. thaliana dbEST yielding 150 EST sequences that
assembled into eight contigs ranging from 449 to 953
bases and 2 to 36 ESTs each. Following ORF identification
the 28 pairwise codon alignments and subsequent dS/dN
values were analyzed to sort contigs into putative gene

family members. From that analysis contig1, contig3 and
contig8 were assigned to putative geneA, contig2, contig4,
and contig5 to geneB, and contig6 to geneC. Table 3
shows that each of these contig groups identified, by
greater than 98% similarity, a different member of the
Arabidopsis ribosomal protein L6 gene family when
aligned to the actual gene sequences.
In Table 2 for ribosomal protein L6 it can be seen that all
ESTs from the same contig as well as all ESTs from the
same gene grouping are assigned to the same gene locus.
Also, in no instances did ESTs belonging to different gene
groupings by NSP ever map to the same gene locus.
Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase gene family
The tblastn search of using AtCAD5 protein as query
resulted in 150 EST sequences. The ESTs assembled into
eight contigs ranging from 592 to 1248 bases and 2 to 21
ESTs each. Following ORF identification the 28 pairwise
codon alignments and subsequent dS/dN values were
analyzed to sort contigs into putative gene family members as described above (data not shown). The eight contigs assorted into four groups based on their negative
selection pattern with each other contig. These four
groups were arbitrarily designated GeneA represented by
contig4, contig6, and contig8, GeneB, represented by
contig3, contig5, and possibly contig7, GeneC represented by contig1, and GeneD represented by contig2.

Individual ESTs of representative contigs for putative gene family members of the 5 Arabidopsis families tested were located to a specific locus by
NCBI MapViewer.

The results of the comparison of representative contigs to
the actual gene sequences for the CAD gene family of Arabidopsis are shown in Table 4. Each contig group identified, by greater than 99% similarity, a different member of

the CAD gene family. MapViewer analysis for the CAD
gene family (Table 2) shows that all ESTs from the same
contig are assigned to the same gene locus, and no ESTs
belonging to different contigs map to the same gene locus.

Representative contigs for 3 putative gene family members, GeneA, GeneB, and GeneC, identified by the NSP method were aligned with actual
Arabidopsis gene family members and percent similarity determined.

Contigs validated by alignment to actual genes but not
shown in Table 2 are comprised of ESTs that have not yet
been mapped to specific loci by MapViewer.
Release Factor 1 gene family
AtRF1-3 protein was used as query for the tblastn search of
A. thaliana dbEST yielding 109 EST sequences that assembled into six contigs ranging from 591 to 930 bases and
three to 19 ESTs each. Following ORF identification the 15
pairwise codon alignments by the NSP program resulted
in three contigs exhibiting NSP. These were arbitrarily
assigned as contig1 representing geneA, contig3 representing geneB, and contig6 representing geneC. Each of these

ESTs each. Following ORF identification the 15 pairwise
alignments by the NSP program resulted in two contig
groups exhibiting NSP. Contig1 and contig5 represent
geneA, and contig3 and contig6 represent geneB. Each of
these contig groups identified, by greater than 97% similarity, a different member of the Arabidopsis FtsH gene
family when aligned to the actual gene sequences, as
shown in Table 6. MapViewer results again show that ESTs
comprising NSP-selected contigs are unambiguous in the
gene locus to which they have been assigned (Table 2).

Discussion
It has been observed for some time that contig assembly
from EST sequences can produce artifactual sequences
resulting from relatively high error in EST sequences, chimeras generated in cDNA cloning, and regions of highly
conserved domains interspersed in related genes. Therefore, it is necessary that strategies involving the generation
of contigs from ESTs employ some criterion for either
eliminating unauthentic coding regions or selecting for
authentic ones. We have found that contigs representing
gene families where the paralogous coding regions have
been constrained by negative (purifying) selection pressure can be identified by screening for amino acid substitution patterns indicative of such (NSP, Negative
Selection Patterns). However, if differences between contigs are artifacts no pattern among codon positions should
be exhibited. If no negative selection pattern is detected
we do not conclude that the contigs necessarily represent
the same gene. Our goal is only to identify contigs that

represent different genes of the same family. We do not
expect that all members of a particular family will be
detectable by this method. Other members may be identified with iterative searches using previously identified
contigs.
To illustrate that this method can identify members of a
gene family with some accuracy using only EST data we
tested it on five well-characterized gene families in Arabidopsis. Each case resulted in successful identification of
one to three additional gene family members distinct
from the member used as initial query. Of the eight initial
contigs generated from EST hits when AtCAD5 was used as
query the NSP strategy identified those representing
AtCAD1, AtCAD2, and AtCAD4, in addition to one representing AtCAD5 (Table 4). Moreover, each of these contigs exhibited less than 87% similarity to other actual
members of the gene family. No contigs generated at the
parameters specified in the assembly program represented
AtCAD3, 6, 7, 8 or 9. This could be the result of relative
expression levels of those genes, limits on the necessary
similarity between gene family members, or limitations
on the method which are discussed elsewhere [28]. Similarly, when ribosomal protein L6A was used as query the
NSP strategy identified contigs accurately representing all
three genes of the family, L6A, L6B, and L6C (Table 3).
Furthermore, all three members of the RF1 gene family
were accurately represented by NSP-screened contigs
(Table 5), as were AtFtsH2 and AtFtsH8 of that 12-member
gene family (Table 6). We previously reported the accurate
identification of AtPAL1, 2, and 4 of phenylalanine
ammonia-lyase gene family and show here further validation that the contigs identified the appropriate gene family members.

In addition, we were able to show that all the ESTs of a single contig defined the same actual gene family member
according to MapViewer (Table 2), i.e., all ESTs of a single
contig mapped to the same locus, and perhaps more
importantly, no ESTs from different contigs of the same
gene family ever mapped to the same locus. This would
suggest that although the initial assembly of related ESTs
may indeed generate non-valid contigs, screening by NSP
allows one to determine which contigs represent real gene
loci.
A limitation to the NSP strategy is the fact that only paralogs that exhibit purifying selection can be identified and
that selection pattern must be evident in the portion of the
coding region reconstructed by contig assembly, roughly
the 3' two-thirds of the protein by our experience. For this
reason the NSP strategy in it current phase will only identify a subset of gene families. However, when we consider
that estimates of the number of gene families in a plant
species may be 10–12,000 [32], that subset may comprise
a significant portion in which NSP can detect two to three
additional family members. Our goal is to broaden the
NSP approach to identify as many gene families as possible without sacrificing the accuracy reported here. We
have already automated the four basic steps, 1) BLAST collection of related ESTs, 2) contig assembly, 3) ORF identification, and 4) NSP screening of contigs, such that the
input is a query protein of a potential gene family member
and the output is contigs representing at least two gene
family members. Since the query can be an orthologous
sequence, we are currently working on identifying, in Glycine max, every gene family for which at least one member
has been identified in another plant species. The specific
objectives for accomplishing this are to:
1) use all known Glycine max mRNAs as queries to identify
other family members, if any.
2) use mRNAs from related species as queries to identify
gene families not identified above.
3) use Arabidopsis gene families as queries (currently
about 1000 gene families in TAIR).
4) use other Arabidopsis genes, not currently associated
with a family as queries to identify potential genes existing
as a family in soybean but not so in Arabidopsis.
5) use all Glycine max ESTs not included in contigs from
above searches in clustering experiments to potentially
identify novel gene families.
Objectives 1–4 above are identical in protocol. They differ
only in the species of origin for the protein query. There
are currently about 1350 known Glycine max gene

sequences in the NCBI database, mostly mRNA sequences
but some genomic. Some of these already represent multiple members of the same gene family (e.g. glycinin and
conglycinin seed storage proteins, uricase, ascorbate peroxidase, lipoxygenase, rubicase small subunit, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, etc) [33]. Objective 1 will use all
known genes of soybean as queries to identify other members of the gene family. Objective 2 involves genes from
species more closely related to soybean than Arabidopsis.
These include other eurosids I and particularly other legumes that have significant sequence data available such as
Pisum sativum, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Medicago truncatula.
Objective 3 will involve queries chosen from Arabidopsis
genes that are known to exist as part of a gene family. Currently, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) has
genomic, coding region, and amino acid sequence data
for 996 gene families comprised of 8,331 genes. Objective
4 will use as initial queries all remaining Arabidopsis
genes not already identified in soybean and not associated
with a gene family in TAIR. It is possible that of the
remaining 16,000 genes of Arabidopsis there could be
some that are associated with a family in Glycine max.
Objective 5 does not start with a query sequence but
rather a set of ESTs clustered by similarity to each other.
Several clustering algorithms could be used for this, UniGene (at NCBI), PACE [34], or one developed in our laboratory several years ago. The majority of UniGene
clusters are annotated with "strongly similar to," moderately similar to," or "weakly similar to" gene or protein
functions of other organisms. Others are labeled simply as
"Transcribed locus" to indicate that they represent RNA
sequences that do not show similarity to any currently
known gene or protein (Build #31 has 6812 such clusters). We have run a few of these clusters through the NSP
strategy and found that some will generate contigs that
indicate the cluster may represent ESTs from distinct
members of a gene family. More work in this direction
will allow us to expand the strategy to include identification of yet undiscovered gene families.

Conclusion
Although the NSP strategy is not a global gene family
identification protocol, our tests on the Arabidopsis EST
dataset indicate that it performs well in distinguishing
contigs that represent real genes from contigs that are artifacts. Every EST tested, from contigs that NSP predicted to
be distinct gene family members, mapped to the appropriate gene in Arabidopsis. Further expansion of the strategy
to clustered ESTs eliminating the need for individual
query sequences and further automation of the steps will
allow the identification of a significant proportion of gene
families with reliable accuracy.
