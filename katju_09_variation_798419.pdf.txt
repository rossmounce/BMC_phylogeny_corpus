<p>Differences between
Young gene duplicates yeast and worm duplicates result from differences in mechanisms of duplication and effective population size.</

Abstract
Background: The direct examination of large, unbiased samples of young gene duplicates in their
early stages of evolution is crucial to understanding the origin, divergence and preservation of new
genes. Furthermore, comparative analysis of multiple genomes is necessary to determine whether
patterns of gene duplication can be generalized across diverse lineages or are species-specific. Here
we present results from an analysis comprising 68 duplication events in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
genome. We partition the yeast duplicates into ohnologs (generated by a whole-genome
duplication) and non-ohnologs (from small-scale duplication events) to determine whether their
disparate origins commit them to divergent evolutionary trajectories and genomic attributes.
Results: We conclude that, for the most part, ohnologs tend to appear remarkably similar to nonohnologs in their structural attributes (specifically the relative composition frequencies of
complete, partial and chimeric duplicates), the discernible length of the duplicated region
(duplication span) as well as genomic location. Furthermore, we find notable differences in the
features of S. cerevisiae gene duplicates relative to those of another eukaryote, Caenorhabditis
elegans, with respect to chromosomal location, extent of duplication and the relative frequencies
of complete, partial and chimeric duplications.
Conclusions: We conclude that the variation between yeast and worm duplicates can be
attributed to differing mechanisms of duplication in conjunction with the varying efficacy of natural
selection in these two genomes as dictated by their disparate effective population sizes.

Background

Gene duplication is widely regarded as one of the major contributing factors to the origin of novel biochemical processes
and new lineages bearing morphological innovations during
the course of evolution [1-10]. The direct examination of
large, unbiased samples of young gene duplicates in the early
stages of evolution is crucial to understanding the origin,
preservation and diversification of new genes. The phyloge-

netic breadth of completed sequencing projects is now sufficient to enable comparisons of gene duplication patterns
across diverse taxa and determine whether the structural/
genomic features of gene paralogs are lineage-specific or display phylogenetic independence. Additionally, if gene duplicate patterns and features do vary markedly amongst diverse
taxa, it begs the question as to which evolutionary forces are
paramount in driving this inter-taxa variation.

In preceding studies, one of us investigated the structural features and other genomic attributes of a large sample of evolutionarily young gene duplicates in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans in an attempt to further infer the
dominant patterns of gene duplication within this genome
[11,12]. Despite observable diversity among gene duplicate
pairs with regard to the structural and genomic features
under scrutiny, some dominant patterns were apparent. First,
newly originated gene duplicates tend to arise intra-chromosomally relative to the progenitor copy, often present in tandem placement. Second, aside from a few segmental-scale
duplications, gene duplication tracts tended to be relatively
compact, often failing to encompass open reading frames
(ORFs) in their entirety and resulting in the creation of structurally heterogeneous gene duplicates relative to the progenitor locus. Third, structural heterogeneity between paralogs,
manifested as one or both paralogs containing unique exonic
regions to the exclusion of the other copy, was evident even in
the newborn cohort of gene duplicates despite zero synonymous divergence over their homologous regions. Fourth,
newborn duplicates were often observed as adjacent loci in
inverted orientation, suggesting that inversions may be part
and parcel of the original duplication event. As a first step
towards determining whether these patterns of gene duplication are prevalent in other eukaryotic genomes, we conducted
a similar analysis of gene duplicates with low synonymous
divergence in the genome of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
The evolution of redundant sequences in the S. cerevisiae
genome differs in several notable ways from their counterparts in C. elegans. Most importantly, the yeast genome has
multiple duplicated segments that are remnants of a single
ancestral whole-genome duplication (WGD) event preceding
the divergence of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species
complex with subsequent genome-wide deletions resulting in
the restoration of functional normal ploidy [13-21]. It is
important to recognize that the cohort of gene duplicate pairs
with low synonymous divergence in the S. cerevisiae genome
comprises a mixed population of evolutionarily older gene
duplicates homogenized by the action of codon usage bias
selection and/or gene conversion, and gene duplicates of possibly recent evolutionary origins. Hence, where possible, we
conduct analyses at three levels: the cumulative dataset comprising both evolutionarily older and recently derived gene
duplicate pairs; putative evolutionarily older gene duplicates
residing within duplicated blocks referred to as 'ohnologs' as
per Wolfe [22,23] (we follow that nomenclature here); and
putative evolutionarily recent gene duplicates (henceforth
referred to as 'non-ohnologs'). Preceding studies have
referred to ohnologs and non-ohnologs as WGD and smallscale duplication (SSD) genes, respectively [24-26].

Results
Final data set
The final data set considered in this study is composed of 68
duplication tracts comprising 93 duplicate pairs with KS values ranging from 0 to 0.35 (Tables 1 and 2). Of these 68 cases,
56 appear to constitute single-locus gene duplications (Table
1). The other 12 duplication events comprise what we classify
as 'linked sets' involving the duplication of more than one
gene locus (Table 2). The duplication of these 12 linked sets
resulted in an additional 37 gene duplicate pairs (minimum
estimate).
Of the 56 single-locus gene duplication events, all but 10 have
been previously characterized as paralogous S. cerevisiae
gene pairs or ohnologs resulting from a WGD event [1719,23]. In contrast, 11 of the 12 linked sets are thought to have
originated from more localized, SSD events, as is the case for
10 single-locus duplication events. We seek to make the distinction between putative ohnologs and non-ohnologs in
order to investigate if the genomic and structural features of
these two classes of gene duplicates in the S. cerevisiae
genome differ significantly.

The majority of duplication events appear to span a
single locus
The determination of the extent of sequence homology
between paralogs in their 5' and 3' flanking regions enabled us
to determine a minimum estimate for the number of loci
duplicated in a given duplication event. The range for the
minimum number of loci duplicated is one to seven genes. In
most cases, the duplication event appeared to span only a single locus (Figure 1). Together, duplication events leading to
linked sets (duplication of two or more genes in one event)
comprised 18% of all duplication events.
We bring these patterns to attention with the caveat that the
extent of sequence homology discernible between two paralogs may not reflect the ancestral duplication span. This is
particularly salient given that some S. cerevisiae paralogs
thought to be evolutionarily older appear to be of recent origin (low levels of synonymous sequence divergence) due to
the homogenizing effects of gene conversion and/or codon
usage bias [19,27,28]. In these cases, while the original duplication event may have encompassed large segments of DNA
or entire chromosomes (as would be the case for ohnologs),
subsequent sequence divergence at selectively neutral sites,
intergenic deletions as well as local rearrangements over evolutionary time will serve to diminish the extent of discernible
sequence homology between the two copies, particularly in
flanking regions, thereby leading to an underestimation of the
number of loci encompassed in the ancestral duplication
event.
Interestingly, all but one of the twelve linked sets involving
the duplication of multiple loci are considered non-ohnologs
(Table 2). If these duplication events have occurred subse-

Columns 1 and 2 list the systematic names of the two paralogs in question as per the Saccharomyces Genome Database. *A gene duplicate pair that
has been classified as an ohnolog resulting from a WGD event. †An ancestrally single locus that currently exists as three adjacent genes due to frameshift mutations. Column 3 lists the synonymous-site divergence (KS) between the two paralogs as computed by the Nei and Gojobori method with a
correction for multiple hits. Column 4 lists the particular category of structural resemblance (complete, partial or chimeric). Column 5 lists the
chromosomal location of paralogs 1 and 2, respectively. Column 6 provides a minimal estimate of the length of the duplicated region, based on
current visual inspection of the extent of sequence homology across the paralogs' coding and flanking regions. Columns 7 and 8 list the extent of
discernible sequence homology between the paralogs in their 5' and 3' flanking regions, respectively.

quent to the WGD event within the S. cerevisiae lineage, their
presence suggests that duplication events spanning multiple
loci are relatively frequent and/or selectively advantageous
within this genome. In contrast, 46 of the 56 single-locus
duplications have been previously classified as ohnologs,
indicating an erosion of sequence homology between the two
paralogs in their intergenic regions in the post-duplication
period.

Most S. cerevisiae paralogs reside on different
chromosomes
With respect to genomic location, we determined whether the
two paralogs comprising a gene duplicate pair reside on the
same chromosome versus different chromosomes (Figure 2)
for the cumulative data, ohnologs in isolation and nonohnologs in isolation. Within the cumulative data set comprising both ohnologs and non-ohnologs (n = 68 duplication
events), the two paralogs reside on different chromosomes in
the majority of cases (82%; 56 of 68 duplicate pairs).
A comparison of ohnologs versus non-ohnologs in isolation
with respect to the chromosomal location of paralogs appears
to yield differential frequencies of paralogs on the same versus different chromosomes between these two classes of gene
duplicates. Eighty-seven percent of all ohnologs comprise
paralogs residing on different chromosomes. The remaining
13% of ohnologs comprising paralogs located on the same
chromosome must be owing to secondary movement in the
post-duplication period, if these duplicate pairs did indeed
originate from a WGD event or whole-chromosomal duplications. Non-ohnologs appear to comprise fewer gene duplicate
pairs, with paralogs residing on different chromosomes (71%)
relative to ohnologs. However, a G-test for goodness of fit
revealed no significant differences in the chromosomal location of ohnologs versus non-ohnologs (Gadj = 2.18, d.f. = 1, 0.1
<P < 0.5). Hence, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that
the chromosomal location of paralogs (same versus different

chromosomes) is independent of whether they arose from the
WGD event or not, with extant S. cerevisiae paralogs more
likely to exist on different chromosomes.

Preponderance of complete duplicates
A direct comparison of the intron/exon structure of the paralogs across the 56 single-locus duplication events comprising
both ohnologs and non-ohnologs revealed most gene duplicates in this data set (91%) as complete duplicates, with an
absolute absence of partial duplicates and a low incidence of
duplicates with chimeric structure (Figure 3). Among the 47
ohnologs, only two pairs exhibit structural heterogeneity
(both chimeric). The frequency of structurally heterogeneous
duplicate pairs within the non-ohnologs class thought to have
originated from SSD events is slightly different. Of these 21
non-ohnologs, 10 (48%) and 11 (52%) comprise what appear
to be single-locus duplications and linked sets, respectively.
Only one of the ten putative single-locus duplication events
involving non-ohnologs exhibits a chimeric structure. Of the
11 linked sets, eight comprise complete duplications of all loci
duplicated within that particular duplication event (range of
number of loci duplicated is two to seven). The remaining
three linked sets are characterized as: two linked sets (of two
and six simultaneously duplicated loci, respectively) wherein
one terminal/flanking locus within the duplication tract displays a partial structure; and one linked set of four loci
wherein both terminal/flanking loci exhibit a chimeric structure. Cumulatively speaking, only 18% (4 of 22) of nonohnologs in yeast display some facet of structural heterogeneity. Moreover, there is no significant difference in the frequencies of these three structural categories when the data set
is further partitioned on the basis of ohnologs versus nonohnologs (Gadj = 1.26, d.f. = 1, 0.1 <P < 0.5).

Number of Loci Duplicated
Figure 1
Frequency distribution of the minimum number of loci duplicated
Frequency distribution of the minimum number of loci duplicated. The
data set comprises 68 duplication events in the S. cerevisiae genome. The
displayed data encompass ohnologs and non-ohnologs, duplications of a
single-locus as well as multiple loci in the same duplication events (linked
sets).

Reduced duplication span in ohnologs relative to nonohnologs
Figure 4a illustrates the distribution of duplication spans for
all 68 duplications events. The range of duplication spans for
the composite data set (n = 68) is 113 to 19,614 bp with a
median value of 1,004 bp. All but one of the duplication span
values were < 7.5 kb, with the lone exception spanning
approximately 19.6 kb. The L-shaped distribution implies
that the discernible extent of duplication is relatively short for
extant yeast duplicates and this pattern could be due to the
duplication of relatively short sequence tracts and/or the
duplication of lengthier sequence tracts with subsequent erosion of sequence homology in the flanking regions of paralogs
over evolutionary time (due to sequence divergence or intergenic deletions), as would be the case for paralogs resulting
from the ancient WGD event or segmental duplication events.
We investigated whether ohnologs and non-ohnologs differ
significantly with respect to their duplication spans (Figure
4b). For instance, one might expect that gene duplicates
owing their origin to the WGD event, on average, tend to have
lengthier duplication spans relative to non-ohnologs. The frequency distribution of extant duplication spans for ohnologs
appears to be restricted to short sequence tracts ranging from
113 bp to 6.9 kb with a median value of 984 bp. Approximately
66% of all duplication span values for ohnologs fall short of
the median gene length of 1,071 bp in S. cerevisiae. In con-

trast, the duplication spans of non-ohnologs are dispersed
across a wider range of values (310 bp to 19.6 kb) with a
median value of approximately 2.5 kb, which greatly exceeds
the median gene length in S. cerevisiae. In addition, the
duplication spans of ohnologs and non-ohnologs were found
to differ significantly (Wilcoxon two-sample test, P =
0.0003).

Limited sequence homology in flanking regions
The nucleotide sequences of 5' and 3' flanking regions for
each of the two paralogs within each duplicate pair were
aligned to determine the duplication termination points. This
also enabled the determination of the extent of sequence
homology between the paralogs in their upstream and downstream flanking regions. The extent of 5' and 3' flanking
region homology between paralogs was calculated for 56
duplicate pairs that appear as single-locus duplications. The
12 linked sets comprising the simultaneous duplication of
multiple genes were excluded from this analysis.
The frequency distribution of the extent of 5' sequence
homology between two paralogs for n = 56 duplicate pairs is
displayed in Figure 5a. For approximately 80% of duplicate
pairs, the detectable sequence homology in the 5' region is
limited to 0 to 10 bp. The range of discernible 5' sequence
homology between paralogs in this data set is 0 to 816 bp with
a median value of 3.5 bp. A comparison of the very same distributions for putative ohnologs versus non-ohnologs (Figure
5b) demonstrates that, on average, both these classes of
duplicate pairs exhibit a similar L-shaped distribution of
extremely limited 5' sequence homology between paralogs,
with a range of 0 to 56 bp and 0 to 816 bp, respectively.

intron-containing genes are overwhelmingly ribosomal proteins, which, in turn, comprise a significant fraction of this
data set.

We found no cases of intron loss in the gene duplicates analyzed here. Half of the ohnologs (22 of 44 cases) appearing as
single-locus duplications contain intron(s) that have been
retained in both copies. Three pairs of non-ohnologs comprising a single-locus duplication also contain introns. In each of
these three cases, the two copies reside on different chromosomes. Therefore, we do not have any evidence that retrotransposition contributes to duplicates that occur in radically
different locations in the yeast genome.

Composition frequencies of three structural categories of gene duplicates
within the S. cerevisiae genome. Results are displayed for ohnologs only,
non-ohnologs only and the cumulative data (ohnologs and non-ohnologs).
Methodology for the structural characterization of gene duplicates is
based on [11].

Although the 5' sequence homology distribution for ohnologs
appears to have a far greater right skew relative to that for
non-ohnologs, these two classes of gene duplicates were not
found to be statistically different with respect to the extent of
5' sequence homology between paralogs (Wilcoxon two-sample test, P = 0.1253).
The distribution of extant 3' sequence homology between paralogs comprising the 56 single-locus duplication events mirrors that observed for 5' flanking regions (Figure 6), if not
more downwardly biased. Approximately 86% of duplicate
pairs have detectable 3' sequence homology limited to a mere
0 to 10 bp. The range of discernible 3' sequence homology
between paralogs in this data set is 0 to 423 bp with a median
value of a mere 1 bp. When the data are further differentiated
into ohnologs and non-ohnologs, these two classes of duplicate pairs are found to differ significantly with respect to the
extent of 3' sequence homology between paralogs (Wilcoxon
two-sample test, P = 0.0172). Ohnologs appear to have more
restricted 3' sequence homology relative to non-ohnologs
with a median value of 1 bp and a range of 0 to 35 bp. In contrast, the median value and range of 3' sequence homology for
non-ohnologs is 20.5 bp and 0 to 423 bp, respectively. Taken
together, S. cerevisiae paralogs exhibit extremely limited
tracts of sequence identity in their 5' and 3' flanking regions.

Intron preservation in paralogs
Intron-bearing genes comprise only 4% of the total ORFs
found in the S. cerevisiae genome [29]. In contrast, our data
set of gene duplicates contains an unusually high frequency of

The incidence of highly diverged introns in ribosomal
protein duplicates
Our sequence alignments of paralogs across their flanking
regions, exons and introns revealed an interesting observation, namely the presence of nonhomologous introns between
paralogs across 24 pairs of ribosomal protein duplicates with
varying KS values (ranging from approximately 0.039 to
0.336) that have all previously been characterized as
ohnologs (Table 3). These represent 35% of the duplication
events in this dataset. In each case, the exonic regions are
conserved in addition to short tracts of the intron(s) near the
splice junctions. Most of the intronic regions appear nonhomologous between the two paralogs and are characterized by
both nucleotide sequence and size differences. It is possible
that this divergence in intronic sequences represents some
form of intron conversion event. Alternatively, a more plausible scenario is that the paralogs are evolutionarily older than
they appear based on their KS values with a saturation of substitutions in the intronic regions that are presumably under
no selection for sequence conservation. The conservation of
short intronic sequence tracts between the paralogs in the
vicinity of their splice junctions suggests strong purifying
selection for the maintenance of correct sequence signals for
the accurate excision of introns by the RNA splicing machinery.

Discussion

Given the importance of gene duplication to the origin of biological innovations, a deeper understanding of the evolutionary process might be gained from investigating the
differential contributions, if any, of gene duplication to the
genome architecture within diverse lineages. Genomes can be
variably shaped by the mutational input of duplicate
sequences (the frequency and the flavor of redundant genetic
sequences being generated) and their differential preservation/degeneration dictated by the strength of natural selection and random genetic drift. Some effort has been made
towards such comparative genomic analyses of the gene
duplication process, both at the level of closely and distantly
related eukaryotic genomes (for example, [30-42]). In a sim-

deleterious selection coefficients may be subject to loss by
purifying selection due to the efficacy of natural selection
within the yeast genome. The role of effective population size
(and, hence, strength of selection) in influencing patterns of
genomic sequence evolution has been recently championed
by Lynch and colleagues [44-46], although the associated theoretical underpinnings in relation to molecular sequence evolution can be traced back to the proponents of the neutral
theory [47,48].
The extant group of gene duplicate pairs with low synonymous divergence in the S. cerevisiae genome comprise a
mixed population. Most of these pairs (approximately 69%)
are derived from evolutionarily older duplications wherein
sequence divergence between paralogs has been curbed by
the processes of codon selection usage bias, sometimes in
conjunction with gene conversion [19,27,28], whereas a

smaller subset of gene duplicates (approximately 31%)
referred to as non-ohnologs in this study are thought to be of
relatively more recent origin, probably occurring subsequent
to the WGD event. Furthermore, codon selection usage bias/
gene conversion appears to have affected sequence evolution
in some of these non-ohnologs as well given that different
paralogous pairs within the same linked set (presumably arising from the same duplication event) have extremely divergent KS values (Table 2). For these reasons, KS values between
gene paralogs cannot be taken as a blanket proxy for estimating the evolutionary age of all gene duplicates, at least in the
S. cerevisiae genome. The mixed nature of this population of
yeast gene duplicates is also apparent during sequence alignments of ribosomal protein paralogs comprising at least one
intron. Twenty-four pairs of ribosomal protein yeast duplicates in the ohnolog class have no discernible sequence identity over most of their intronic regions (barring small

sequence tracts ranging from 1 to 10 bp at their splice junctions), despite relatively low levels of synonymous divergence
in their coding sequences. This lends credence to view that
these previously classified ohnologs are indeed of older evolutionary origin [19,23]. Given the presence of ancient gene
duplicates with low degrees of synonymous divergence in the
S. cerevisiae genome, it is reasonable to question whether
gene duplicates with low synonymous divergence in other
genomes are necessarily young, evolutionarily speaking. A
preceding study applied statistical tests for detecting gene
conversion to a subset of gene duplicates in the C. elegans
genome and found that most gene conversion events were
restricted to members of large gene families [49], suggesting
that the degree of synonymous divergence may be an accurate
indicator of evolutionary age for paralogs belonging to small
gene families in this genome. Therefore, the worm and yeast
genomes may differ in the degree to which concerted evolution or codon usage bias selection effectively homogenizes
gene paralogs based on the size of the gene family and the
effective population size of the species (and, hence, the
strength of natural selection).
We charted out the extent of homology between two paralogs
by aligning their genic as well as upstream and downstream
flanking regions, thereby calculating a minimal estimate of
the extent of duplication by visual inspection. For evolutionarily older duplicates, erosion of sequence homology in the
intergenic regions would lead us to underestimate the original duplication span. This expectation is borne out by the fact
that 56 of the 93 duplicate pairs in our data set appear to
involve the duplication of a single locus. Yet, preceding studies have identified 46 of these 56 gene duplicate pairs as
ohnologs. The remaining 37 duplicate genes were generated
by 12 duplication events referred to as 'linked sets' (16% of all
duplications in this data set) that involved the simultaneous
duplication of multiple gene loci (range two to seven genes).
Interestingly, only one of these twelve duplication events is
thought to have originated from the WGD, suggesting that
duplication of lengthier DNA segments encompassing multiple loci is an ongoing process in the yeast genome. Indeed,
gene duplication during experimental evolution in yeast frequently involves large chromosomal blocks comprising multiple loci [43,50,51]. Segmental duplications in C. elegans
encompassing more than one locus, on the other hand, only
comprise 7.1% of all observed duplications [34]. This contrast
in the patterns of segmental duplication between worm and
yeast suggests that duplication events spanning multiple loci
occur with a greater frequency and/or are selectively advantageous in the yeast genome relative to C. elegans.
Based on a determination of the extent of sequence homology
visible between yeast paralogs in their flanking regions, we
calculated the minimum duplication span for each duplicate
pair and also determined the minimum number of loci that
appear to be duplicated. In the majority of the cases, the
duplications appear to span only a single locus (approxi-

mately 82%; 56 of 68) and the median duplication span for
the cumulative data set comprising both ohnologs and nonohnologs in yeast is 1,004 bp, slightly lower than the median
duplication span of 1.4 kb for C. elegans gene duplicates.
These results appear paradoxical when we consider that the
majority of yeast duplicate pairs comprising this data set
(69%; 47 of 68) originated via a WGD event. The median
duplication span for ohnologs is significantly lower than that
for non-ohnologs (958 bp and approximately 2,500 bp,
respectively). Furthermore, ohnolog duplication spans are far
more restricted in their size range than non-ohnologs. This
shorter span of duplication for gene duplicates arising from a
WGD are in accord with an older evolutionary age for
ohnologs in conjunction with the erosion of sequence homology in their intergenic regions over evolutionary time due to
sequence divergence, deletions and/or local rearrangements.
Yeast paralogs were characterized as possessing complete,
partial or chimeric structural homology based on the extent of
sequence homology using techniques previously described
for C. elegans paralogs [11]. The genomes of these two
eukaryotes are in stark contrast with respect to the frequency
of these three structural categories of gene duplicate pairs.
The C. elegans genome has a high frequency of structurally
heterogeneous gene duplicates, with approximately 50% of
all evolutionarily young gene duplicate pairs categorized as
partials or chimerics [11]. S. cerevisiae, on the other hand, has
a preponderance of complete duplicates, a handful of chimeric duplicates and a complete absence of partial duplicates.
When yeast duplicates are partitioned based on their mechanism of duplication, ohnologs and non-ohnologs are found to
be similar with respect to the frequencies of these three structural categories of duplicates. Several factors in combination
probably contribute to the paucity of structurally heterogeneous duplicates in the yeast genome. Given a WGD origin for
the majority of these duplicates, they are likely to have originated as structural replicas of the ancestral copy with concomitant inheritance of the full repertoire of ancestral cisregulatory elements. Evolutionarily older duplicates such as
the ohnologs in this data are likely to have experienced local
rearrangements, insertion or deletions that could potentially
convert one or both paralogs such that the paralogs appear
structurally heterogeneous. However, we observe a remarkable level of structural preservation between evolutionarily
older paralogs in S. cerevisiae, suggesting purifying selection
against mutations modifying ancestral ORF structure and/or
pervasive gene conversion leading to structural homogeneity.
Indeed, gene conversion is known to operate at an appreciable frequency in the yeast genome and is commonly invoked
as one of the factors responsible for the low synonymous
divergence among S. cerevisiae ohnologs [19,27,28].
Despite the fact that both yeast non-ohnologs and C. elegans
gene duplicates resulted from SSD events, it is interesting to
note that the genomes of these two species differ with respect
to the degree of structural homogeneity observed between

Genome Biology 2009,

paralogs. Approximately 82% of yeast non-ohnologs are
structurally homogeneous compared to only 40% of gene
duplicate pairs with low synonymous divergence in the C. elegans genome [11]. This difference may be attributed to an
interplay between the median gene length, median duplication span and the strength of natural selection in these two
genomes. The median gene length in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans is 1.1 and 1.4 kb, respectively. The median duplication
span for extant S. cerevisiae (minimal discernible estimate
and excluding ohnologs) and C. elegans duplicates is 2.5 and
1.4 kb, respectively. If the median duplication span of extant
yeast duplicates accurately approximates that of the entire
population of gene duplicates (both preserved and extinct), a
SSD event in S. cerevisiae, on average, is more likely to
encompass the entire ORF of the ancestral copy relative to C.
elegans. It is also possible that the average length of a SSD
event in S. cerevisiae may be much shorter than that of extant
duplicates. If newly originated duplicates are mildly deleterious because they lack structural and functional redundancy
with the progenitor copy, they may be rapidly weeded out in
the yeast genome owing to the greater efficacy of natural
selection. However, a recent study demonstrates that most
spontaneous duplications in yeast experimental lines tend to
be fairly large [43]. A smaller Ne for C. elegans relative to
yeast means that such structurally heterogeneous gene duplicates, if mildly deleterious, may be more likely to persist in
the worm genome due to an attenuated strength of natural
selection.
The genomic location of paralogs relative to one another can
provide clues to the mechanism(s) of duplication and the general patterns of their genomic movement subsequent to their
origin. Overall, 82% of duplicate pairs in this yeast data set
comprise paralogs located on different chromosomes, a pattern that is not surprising given that the vast majority of these
gene duplicates are ohnologs that owe their origin to the
WGD. Barring the possibility of misidentification of nonohnologs as ohnologs, the presence of ohnologs with both
copies residing on the same chromosome can probably be
explained by the secondary movement of one paralog in proximity to its sister copy in the post-duplication period. Interestingly, ohnologs and non-ohnologs display no significant
differences with respect to the chromosomal location of paralogs (same versus different chromosomes). While genome- or
chromosome-wide duplication events are expected to initially
yield paralogs residing on different chromosomes, SSD
events do not necessitate such a pattern of paralog location.
While approximately 90% of newborn gene duplicates in the
C. elegans genome comprise both copies residing on the same
chromosome [11], only 29% of yeast non-ohnologs are in such
close genomic proximity. If gene duplication by retrotransposition is a frequent mechanism of duplication in the yeast
genomes due to the presence of Ty elements [43,52-55], there
should be a further decrease in the likelihood of a paralog
originating on the same chromosome as the ancestral locus.
However, we have no evidence for the origin of gene dupli-

cates via retrotransposition in this yeast dataset. That is to
say, wherever introns are present, both yeast paralogs bear
them. Duplications in experimental yeast populations are frequently translocative [43,50]. Furthermore, there is evidence
that translocated segmental duplicates in yeast have
enhanced stability relative to tandem duplications [56]. Both
of these factors likely contribute to the preponderance of
yeast non-ohonologs residing on different chromosomes.
Functional diversification between paralogs can be effected
by both coding and regulatory sequence divergence. Studies
focusing on the absence/presence of a correlation between
coding sequence divergence and expression divergence
across a breadth of model organisms have yielded contrasting
results, reporting the two variables as coupled (for example,
[36,57-59]) as well as decoupled [35,60-62]. High levels of
gene conversion and/or codon usage bias, which serve to
homogenize the coding sequences of paralogs, may restrict
the potential for expression and functional divergence
between them if coding sequence evolution was the only contributing factor to functional diversification. Given these
regimes of pervasive gene conversion and/or codon usage
bias in the yeast genome, functional diversification via cisregulatory sequence divergence can greatly facilitate functional diversification of paralogs, independent of coding
sequence divergence. Papp and colleagues [63] demonstrated
a rapid reduction in the number of shared cis-regulatory
motifs between yeast duplicates as a function of increasing
synonymous divergence despite constancy in the total
number of regulatory motifs. Our analysis of the extent of
sequence homology in the 5' and 3' flanking regions of yeast
paralogs suggests extremely limited levels of sequence preservation in the flanking regions of yeast paralogs, for
ohnologs and non-ohnologs alike; 80% and 86% of yeast gene
duplicate pairs have detectable sequence homology of only 0
to 10 bp in their 5' and 3' flanking regions, respectively. This
diminished sequence identity between paralogs in their flanking regions can be explained by sequence divergence of initially paralogous regions by mutational saturation over
evolutionary time, deletions and other rearrangements or a
failure to inherit ancestral regulatory elements during the
duplication process. Given that many of these gene duplicate
pairs are thought to have arisen from a WGD event, the first
two scenarios are the most likely explanations for the limited
flanking region homology between putative ohnologs comprising this data set. Irrespective of the specific mechanism
driving the divergence of flanking regions of S. cerevisie paralogs, there exists an appreciable potential for functional
diversification between paralogs due to the lack of shared regulatory elements despite complete sequence homology across
their ORFs. The causes for the lack of shared flanking region
sequence between yeast paralogs are likely to differ for the
ohnolog and non-ohnolog classes (rapid molecular divergence versus limited duplication span). However, the
sequence divergence in flanking regions of both classes of
yeast duplicates is likely to play an important role in driving

Genome Biology 2009, 10:R75

http://genomebiology.com/2009/10/7/R75

Genome Biology 2009,

expression divergence between yeast paralogs, despite the
maintenance of sequence homology in their coding regions.
Interestingly, ohnologs and non-ohnologs show both similarities and disparities with respect to their flanking region
homology. Ohnologs and non-ohnologs were not found to be
statistically different with respect to the extent of 5' sequence
homology. These results are not in agreement with a previous
study that found ohnologs to have more diverged upstream
regulatory regions relative to non-ohnologs [25], although
this discrepancy between the two studies could be due to both
differences in sample size and methodology. In contrast to
our 5' flanking region results, there exists a significant difference in the extent of 3' sequence homology between these two
classes of yeast duplicates, with ohnologs displaying far more
restricted 3' flanking sequence homology relative to nonohnologs. It is reasonable to suggest that this highly limited
extent of homology in the downstream flanking regions of
ohnologs is due to diminished selection for conservation of
sequence in this area relative to the upstream flanking
sequence.

Conclusions

Ohnologs and non-ohnologs initially need to be considered as
separate populations of gene duplicates in the S. cerevisiae
genome, given their disparate mechanisms of origin as well as
their evolutionary ages [24-26]. In general, we find yeast
ohnologs and non-ohnologs both share as well as differ in
their genomic attributes, with the latter occurring often in
unexpected directions. The older evolutionary age of the
ohnologs with the concomitant erosion of intergenic
sequence homology make them superficially appear as singlelocus duplications, akin to other gene duplicates resulting
from SSD events. Both ohnologs and non-ohnologs comprise
similar frequencies of complete, partial and chimeric duplicates with a strong trend towards a paucity of structurally heterogeneous gene duplicates (partial and chimeric),
suggesting a strong role for purifying selection in their elimination. In addition, ohnologs and non-ohnologs do not differ
with respect to the chromosomal location of the paralogs,
despite presumably disparate mechanisms of duplication
leading to their origin. Finally, ohnologs and non-ohnologs
both appear to have extremely limited tracts of sequence
homology in their upstream and downstream flanking
regions, suggesting a possibly greater role for regulatory elements in expression and functional divergence between yeast
paralogs. In addition, we concur with other studies that the
disparate mechanisms of origin for ohnologs and nonohnologs may dictate divergent evolutionary fates and trajectories for these two classes of gene paralogs due to varying
levels of gene-dosage selection [25,64-66]. However, we conclude that, for the most part, yeast ohnologs and nonohnologs tend to appear remarkably similar in their structural attributes and genomic locations.

The patterns and features of S. cerevisiae gene duplicates
show notable differences relative to their counterparts in
another model eukaryote, the nematode C. elegans. The
physical organization and location of the gene duplicates in
the two genomes provide evidence for differential mechanisms of duplication. A whole genome duplication event is
known to have occurred in the ancestor of S. cerevisiae,
thereby contributing to different chromosomal locations of
the majority of yeast paralogs while these are relatively rare in
C. elegans [11,31,34]. Additionally, yeast paralogs from SSD
events are more likely to be found on different chromosomes
as well, either due to translocative duplications, association
with mobile elements or selective maintenance [32]. Moreover, the near complete absence of structurally heterogeneous
gene duplicates in S. cerevisiae also suggests a role for purifying selection in their elimination from the genome. A large Ne
for S. cerevisiae results in greater efficacy of natural selection,
which may serve to weed out partial and chimeric duplicates
if they are even mildly deleterious with respect to function in
their early evolutionary life. We conclude that these differences among gene duplicates in yeast and worm reflect both
variable duplication regimes as well as varying strengths of
selection owing to the differences in the effective population
sizes of the two species.

Materials and methods
The S. cerevisiae genome
The genome of S. cerevisiae, the first eukaryotic genome to be
sequenced, is approximately 12 million base pairs (Mb) in
length and organized across 16 chromosomes [29]. This
genome is relatively compact with almost 70% of the genome
comprising ORFs. According to the latest annotated version
in the Saccharomyces Genome Database [67], the genome
encodes 4,649 ORFS, which means that a protein-coding
gene is located every 2.6 kb of genome sequence. Of the 4,649
ORFs, 70.34% have been verified experimentally while
17.32% and 12.33% have been assigned to the 'uncharacterized' and 'dubious' categories, respectively.

Identification of gene duplicates with low synonymous
divergence in the S. cerevisiae genome
The complete set of available nucleotide sequences for all
putative ORFs in the S. cerevisiae genome were downloaded
from the Saccharomyces Genome Database [67]. A WUBLAST was used to query each ORF nucleotide sequence
against all other sequences in this data set, retaining those
pairs with E-values less than 10-6 to reduce the frequency of
chance alignments. The resulting BLAST reports were further
screened to identify alignments with at least 90% sequence
identity and lengths exceeding 30 bp. We excluded multigene
families involving three or more members, focusing entirely
on cases with only two gene copies in the S. cerevisiae
genome.

Katju et al. R75.14

Using the final set of BLAST alignments as a guide, we proceeded to retrieve the ORF nucleotide sequence (both the
spliced and unspliced if intron(s) were present) as well as 5 kb
of upstream and downstream nucleotide sequence for both
putative paralogs. All nucleotide sequences corresponding to
the two paralogs were visualized and aligned in Se-AL, version 2.0A11 [68]. We aligned the 5' upstream and 3' downstream nucleotide sequences of the paralogs, accessing
additional sequence if necessary, until no homology was
apparent for 2 kb. This enabled us to identify the duplication
termination points, calculate the length of the duplication
span [11] and determine if additional ORFs aside from the
focal loci comprising the duplicate pair were included in the
duplication event.

5' and 3' directions were identified as the nucleotide beyond
which no homology was apparent between the paralogs for a
continuous stretch of 1 kb on either end despite accounting
for indels. The duplication span was measured as the length
of sequence between the 5' and 3' duplication termination
points. This methodology therefore underestimates the true
duplication span at the time of the duplication event and only
offers a minimal estimate of the extent of homology still
apparent between the two paralogs. For example, in the
instance of an indel exceeding 1 kb in one paralog, we would
fail to detect the resumption of homology between the two
copies beyond the indel location. Likewise, we would prematurely designate duplication termination points in intergenic
sequence tracts wherein sequence homology between the paralogs has been eroded due to rapid rates of molecular evolution or a lack of selective pressure for sequence conservation.

substitutions

Identification of duplication termination points and
linked groups

For each set of paralogs, we calculated the number of nucleotide substitutions per synonymous and nonsynonymous site
using the Nei and Gojobori method [69] corrected for multiple hits via the online molecular software SNAP [70].

Characterization of duplicate pairs into structural
categories
We also used the alignments of spliced, unspliced (if available) and upstream/downstream flanking regions of the two
paralogs to determine the degree of structural resemblance
between them, as per the protocol used in Katju and Lynch
[11]. Gene duplicates with complete structural resemblance
exhibit complete sequence homology between the initiation
and termination codons. For gene duplicates with amino acid
sequences of differing lengths, duplicates were still designated as possessing complete structure if the shorter copy
exhibited nucleotide sequence homology to the lengthier copy
throughout the latter's ORF, irrespective of differential annotation, if present, with respect to exon-intron and flanking
region boundaries. Insertions/deletions (indels) resulting in
frameshifts or in-frame gaps were ignored as long as nucleotide sequence homology between the two copies was
resumed within the ORF boundaries of the lengthier reference sequence, before the start of flanking region(s). Partial
duplicates comprised paralogs of differing amino acid lengths
wherein the entire ORF of the shorter gene was homologous
to the lengthier gene's ORF but the latter ORF had unique
sequence to the exclusion of the shorter gene copy. Finally,
chimeric duplicates comprised cases wherein both paralogs,
in addition to homologous regions, had unique ORF sequence
to the exclusion of the other gene copy.
