Abstract
Background: Mucins are large glycoproteins that cover epithelial surfaces of the body. All mucins
contain at least one PTS domain, a region rich in proline, threonine and serine. Mucins are also
characterized by von Willebrand D (VWD) domains or SEA domains. We have developed
computational methods to identify mucin genes and proteins based on these properties of the
proteins. Using such methods we are able to characterize different organisms where genome
sequence is available with respect to their mucin repertoire.
Results: We have here made a comprehensive analysis of potential mucins encoded by the chicken
(Gallus gallus) genome. Three transmembrane mucins (Muc4, Muc13, and Muc16) and four gelforming mucins (Muc6, Muc2, Muc5ac, and Muc5b) were identified. The gel-forming mucins are
encoded within a locus similar to the corresponding human mucins. However, the chicken has an
additional gene inserted between Muc2 and Muc5ac that encodes the the α-subunit of ovomucin,
a protein similar to Muc2, but it is lacking a PTS domain. We also show that the β-subunit of
ovomucin is the orthologue of human MUC6. The transmembrane Muc13 gene is in chicken as well
as in mammals adjacent to the HEG (heart of glass) gene. HEG has PTS, EGF and transmembrane
domains like Muc13, suggesting that these two proteins are evolutionary related. Unlike previously
known mucins, the PTS domain of Muc13 is encoded by multiple exons, where each exon encodes
a repeat unit of the PTS domain.
Conclusion: We report new mucin homologues in chicken and this information will aid in
understanding the evolution of mucins in vertebrates. The fact that ovomucin, a protein not found
in mammals, was located in the same locus as other gel-forming mucins provides strong support
that these proteins are evolutionary related. Furthermore, a relationship of HEG and the
transmembrane Muc13 is suggested on the basis of their biochemical properties and their presence
in the same locus. Finally, our finding that the chicken Muc13 is distributed between multiple exons
raises the interesting possibility that the length of the PTS domain could be controlled by alternative
splicing.

Background
The mucosal surfaces are all covered by mucus largely
made up of the large glycoproteins referred to as mucins.
Mucins play an important role in protection, but some
mucins also take part in cell surface signaling and are
important for cancer development and progression. Typical for the mucins are the large mucin (PTS) domains rich
in the amino acids Ser, Thr and Pro, often characterized by
perfect or imperfect tandem repeats [1]. Most mucins also
have other characteristic domains such as von Willebrand
D (VWD) or SEA (sea urchin sperm protein-enterokinaseagrin) domains. We have developed bioinformatics methods to identify and characterize mucin genes based on
these distinct properties of mucins [2]. Using such methods, we recently carried out an analysis of the puffer fish
Fugu rubripes [2].
There are two major types of mucins, membrane-bound
and secreted. In human, nine membrane-bound (MUC1,
MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC4, MUC12, MUC13, MUC16 and
MUC17) [3-9] and seven secreted mucins (MUC2,
MUC5B, MUC5AC, MUC6, MUC7, MUC19 and MUC20)
[10-16] have been identified. The secreted mucins can be
further sub-divided as being either gel-forming (MUC2,
MUC5B, MUC5AC, MUC6 and MUC19) or not (MUC7
and MUC20). The ability to form gels is dependent on the
capacity of monomers to form polymeric structures. Gelforming mucins have three VWD domains in their N-terminal ends that are involved in polymerization through
intermolecular disulfide-bonds. They also have a cysteineknot (CK) domain at their C-terminal ends (reviewed in
[17]). The VWD domain was first identified in the preprovon Willebrand factor [18], hence its name. The gel forming mucins and the von Willebrand factor dimerize with
the help of their C-terminal VWD domains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [17-19] and oligomerize through
their N-terminal VWD domains in the acidic compartments of the Golgi complex [17,20]. The human transmembrane mucins are all characterized by either a SEA
domain or a special variant of the VWD domain that is
lacking cysteines. Several of the human transmembrane
mucins are known to or predicted to be cleaved in their
SEA or VWD domains [21].
To understand the evolution of mucins, we are systematically examining the distribution and structure of mucins
in different organisms. The results of such analysis will
ultimately provide a better understanding of the function
of the human mucins. It is also important to study mucins
from organisms such as C. elegans, Drosophila, zebrafish
and mouse as these are important experimental model
systems. The previously analyzed puffer fish Fugu rubripes
[2] has a gene repertoire similar in size to that of man, but
according to our analysis it seems to lack several of the
mucins found in the human genome. In particular, this is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/197

the case for the transmembrane mucins as only one such
gene was identified in the fish whereas the human
genome encodes at least nine different.
Sequencing and annotating mucin genes is notoriously
difficult due to their large size and repetitive nature.
Therefore, the identification and classification of putative
novel mucins requires a variety of bioinformatics tools as
well as expert biological knowledge. Continuing our analysis of animal mucin genes, we now report on novel
mucins identified in the chicken genome. Previously, a
chicken MUC4-related protein was known and Muc16
was identified by Duraisamy et al [22]. In addition, two
chicken mucin-related proteins have been reported and
are referred to as the α- and β-subunits of ovomucin, the
major component of egg white and responsible for its gellike properties [23]. We now show that the previously
reported β-subunit is the chicken orthologue of human
MUC6. We also report on a chicken Muc13 gene. This
gene has an unusual organization as the tandem repeats of
the PTS domain is encoded by multiple exons where each
exon encodes one repeat.

Results and discussion
Mucin genes may be reliably predicted using
bioinformatics methods
To identify mucins we have used a method (PTSpred) to
predict PTS/mucin domains where we analyzed both predicted proteins as well as genomic sequences translated in
all six possible reading frames. We have previously
applied this method to analyze the puffer fish Fugu
rubripes [2]. We have here used that method to analyze
human and chicken proteins as well as genomic
sequences. We have also taken advantage of the fact that
all mucins (MUC7 and MUC20 excluded) contain either
von Willebrand D (VWD) or SEA domains. Thus, we have
analyzed proteins with Pfam models of the VWD and SEA
domains and Genewise [24] was used to screen genomic
sequences using the same models.

We considered a protein sequence to be a potential mucin
if it contained at least one PTS domain as well as a VWD
or SEA domain. Such candidates were further evaluated by
phylogenetic analyses of SEA/VWD domains. A protein
was considered a strong mucin candidate only in case the
phylogenetic analysis supported a relationship between
its SEA or VWD domain(s) to those of previously characterized mammalian mucins.
To test the efficiency of our computational methods we
first analyzed available human protein sequences as well
as the human genome assembly (for details see Materials
and Methods). All human mucins, except MUC7 and
MUC20, contain PTS domains as well as either VWD or
SEA domains. In summary, our methods successfully

identified all of these previously known mucins. In addition, we identified MUC19 [15,25] that was not known at
the time we carried out this work. With the help of EST,
mRNA, protein and genome sequences we were also able
to reconstruct more complete and accurate human mucin
protein sequences and elucidate gene structures (T. Lang
et al., unpublished). These results show that our computational methods are reliable in terms of mucin gene predictions and that rigorous analysis of available sequence
information is necessary in order to derive reliable predictions of gene and protein sequences.
Prediction of chicken mucin genes
We have now analyzed the chicken genome for mucin
genes making use of the assembled genomic sequence and
the proteins predicted by ENSEMBL [26]. The genome
assembly used in this work is expected to be approximately 90% complete. We have used methods described
above for screening of the human and F. rubripes
genomes. Most of the VWD and SEA domains identified
in searches with hmmer and Genewise could be attributed
either to mucins or to other previously known human
proteins containing these domains. The predicted chicken
mucin genes were characterized by a variety of bioinformatics tools and comparisons with known mucin genes
and proteins from other species. For instance, all the
sequences of the known mucin genes were aligned to the
chicken genome. In this way, we could not only identify
the human homologues, but also obtain a more complete

sequence and understanding of the predicted chicken
mucin. For more information on our current assembly of
chicken mucins genes, including a comparison to the
ENSEMBL predictions, the reader is referred to our mucin
web site [27]. A summary of our current inventory of
mucins in man, mouse, chicken and the fish Fugu rubripes
is shown in Table 1.
A total of eight strong mucin candidates in chicken were
identified, all with PTS domains and with either VWD (5)
or SEA (3) domains. Analysis of the proteins with VWD
domains revealed Muc2, Muc5ac, Muc5b, and Muc6 genes
that are located in a cluster on chicken chromosome 5 and
are discussed in more detail below. In addition we found
a homologue to Muc4 on chromosome 9. We observed
that a protein predicted by ENSEMBL contained the major
portion of Muc4, including a part of the PTS domain followed by AMOP, VWD, EGF1, EGF2, and TM domains
characteristic for the human MUC4 [6]. The missing Nterminal part, including a signal sequence and the major
part of the PTS domain, was reconstructed from the
genome sequence. The resulting protein sequence is partially identical to a protein previously described as Muc4related (Genbank: XP_426704.1) [22]. The VWD domain
of the human MUC4 is unusual in that it lacks cysteines,
and this is also true for the chicken Muc4. The sequences
of the human and chicken VWD domains are similar (Fig.
1) and taken together our information about the chicken

protein strongly supports an orthologous relationship to
human MUC4.
An analysis of predicted proteins with SEA domains identified chicken Muc13 and Muc16 homologues as well as a
weak Muc1 candidate. Muc13 is described further below.
The chicken Muc16 protein, previously identified by
Duraisamy et al [22], is encoded on chromosome 28 and
has a PTS domain followed by at least four SEA domains.
The assignment as Muc16 based on phylogenetic analysis
(Fig. 2) agrees with previous results [22] and is also consistent with the fact that human MUC16 is the only mucin
known to have multiple SEA domains [8].
Two different proteins with SEA domains related to
human MUC1 were identified. One of these were previously analyzed and it was proposed that it is more closely
related to a heparin sulfate proteoglycan than to mammalian Muc1 [22]. The other MUC1-related protein was analyzed here. However, it did not convincingly cluster with
the SEA domains of other Muc1 proteins ('unknown' in
Fig. 2). Furthermore, the SEA domain of this protein is
preceded by a PTS domain, but a transmembrane domain
characteristic of MUC1 could not be identified. Finally,
the N-terminal region of this putative mucin gene cannot

be analyzed due to a gap in the genomic sequence. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to predict the existence
of a chicken Muc1.
We expect the predicted genes to be bona fide mucin
genes because of the strong similarity to mucins from
other species with respect to protein sequence, protein
domain structure as well as gene structure. In general, it is
difficult to distinguish between bona fide genes and pseudogenes. However, an analysis of available chicken ESTs
provides evidence of expression for a majority of mucins
genes that we have identified (Table 1). Thus, only in the
case of Muc4, Muc16 and for the protein distantly related
to Muc1 we were not able to find a corresponding EST
sequence. The absence of EST support is not conclusive, as
the available chicken EST data is not expected to be comprehensive.
At the same time it must be pointed out that there are limitations to our approach. We are not able to effectively
identify mucins that are lacking VWD and SEA domains,
mainly because that PTSpred will give rise to a number of

false positive sequences. In addition, we might fail to
detect mucin candidates because genome assemblies are
incomplete, particularly with respect to mucin genes, and
because of limitations in gene prediction procedures.

its 3'-end preventing further comparison. Also for Muc6
the domain structure is identical to the human orthologue
(Fig. 4), but a gap in the 3' genomic sequence makes it
impossible to compare this region.

The ovomucin gene is part of a gene cluster with gelforming mucins Muc2, Muc5ac, Muc5b and Muc6
Five VWD-containing proteins were found within a region
of chromosome 5, covering 12 million bases. The domain
structure of the proteins on chromosome 5 suggested that
this region has an organization similar to the human
MUC2/5AC/5B/6 gene cluster. The relative gene order and
polarity was identical to the corresponding human
mucins as shown in Fig. 3. Thus, the Muc6 mucin is positioned next to and in the opposite direction to Muc2,
Muc5ac and Muc5b.

All VWD domains identified by a screen of the chicken
genome with Genewise were also compared to previously
known VWD domains using BLAST and ClustalW. The
phylogenetic tree from a ClustalW analysis is shown in
Fig. 1. Interestingly, all the mucin VWD domains are clustered in a characteristic manner based on their position in
the mucins as we have previously shown for Fugu rubripes
mucins [2]. The different VWD domains numbered 1–4 in
Fig. 1 are clearly homologous such that the chicken VWD1 is most closely related to the human VWD-1, etc. The
grouping of the human and chicken VWD domains
strongly supports our assignment of the chicken mucins
as Muc2, Muc5ac, Muc5b and Muc6, respectively.

The domain structures of the individual chicken gel-forming mucins were analyzed and the results are shown in Fig.
4. Typically, these mucins have three VWD domains followed by alternating PTS and CysD domains, and at the
C-terminal end a cysteine-knot (CK) domain. The Muc2
and ovomucin proteins have an additional VWD domain.
The chicken Muc2 ortholog was identified as the protein
most similar to the human MUC2. However, the central
part of the predicted molecule contained at least three
CysD and four PTS domains, whereas the human protein
only has two CysD and two PTS domains. A gap in the
genomic sequence precludes further comparison and a
conclusion as to the differences. The chicken Muc5ac and
Muc5b proteins have a similar domain structure with central repeated CysD and PTS domains as in the human
orthologues. However, chicken Muc5B lacks the C-terminal VWD domain in contrast to the human orthologue.
The chicken Muc5ac genomic sequence has a large gap in

When the chromosome 5 locus of chicken is compared to
the corresponding locus in human, the most notable difference is the presence of one additional gene in the
chicken. The predicted protein contains four VWD
domains organized as for the gel-forming mucins (Fig. 4).
This protein was recently cloned by Watanabe et al [23]
and referred to as the α-subunit of ovomucin. An additional subunit called β has also been described [23]. Both
subunits are abundant in egg white and are responsible
for its gel-like properties. However, from the results presented here it is obvious that the β-subunit of ovomucin
is an orthologue to the human MUC6. In the following,
the α-subunit of ovomucin is simply referred to as ovomucin as this protein is specific to the chicken mucin
locus. Ovomucin has a similar domain structure as the

other proteins in the cluster except that it does not contain
the PTS domain characteristic of mucins (Fig. 4).
Interestingly, from the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1 it seems
that the VWD domains of ovomucin are more deeply
branched than Muc2/5ac/5b, suggesting that this ovomucin is a more ancient protein. It will be interesting to further study this issue by identifying homologues of the gelforming mucins in other species. Preliminary results suggest that there are ovomucin homologues in X. tropicalis
and in the fishes F. rubripes, T. nigroviridis and D. rerio
(zebrafish). However, ovomucin is not present in man
and rodents. The tree in Fig. 1 also seems to suggest that
Muc6 is more deeply branched than the other gel-forming
mucins of the same locus, raising the possibility that this
protein is the ancestral form of the Muc2/5ac/5b/Muc6
proteins.
The PTS domain of Muc13 is encoded by multiple exons
where each exon corresponds to a repeated unit
A gene encoding the chicken Muc13 orthologue was identified on chromosome 7. The protein has an N-terminal
signal sequence, followed by one PTS, one SEA, one transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail. There is a gap
in the genome assembly encoding the PTS domain and
therefore the full sequence of this domain cannot be predicted. However, the PTS domain is composed of at least
12 repeats, each 20 amino acids in length (Fig. 5).

Typical for the PTS domains of previously known mucins
are that these are built from tandem repeats that often
show a remarkable length polymorphism (VNTR, variable
number of tandem repeats) [1,28]. The mechanism and

functional significance of this variability in length is currently not known, but there are several indications that
such variation is associated with disease. The allele length
of MUC1 has been linked to susceptibility to Helicobacter
pylori infection and gastric cancer [29,30]. Furthermore, it
has recently been suggested that the allele length of MUC1
influences the expression of tumor associated carbohydrate antigens and possibly also the aggressiveness of gastric cancer [31].
For all previously described mucins, including the human
MUC13, the PTS domain is found within a single large
exon. However, the chicken Muc13 PTS domain is
encoded by multiple exons. There is a chicken EST (Genbank accession AJ452523) that gives support to this conclusion. As with most other mucins, the chicken Muc13
PTS domain contains repeats. It is interesting to note that
the sequences encoded by the exons are nearly identical,
i.e. the sequence encoded by one exon corresponds to a
repeat unit of the PTS domain (Fig. 5).
The chicken Muc13 tandem repeats thus have a different
genomic organization as compared to higher animals. An
analysis of zebrafish proteins (unpublished) identified a
Muc13 homologue (Fig. 2) with its gene encoding the PTS
domain divided into several exons. These findings suggest
that this organization of the PTS domain represents an
ancestral design of the vertebrate Muc13 gene and perhaps
of other mucins.
The genomic organization of the Muc13 gene raises the
possibility that a variation in length of the PTS domain
may be accomplished not only by recombination events,

as is the case for the human MUC1 polymorphism, but
also by a regulation of splicing of mucin domain exons.
This will allow a length variation not only between individuals, but also within one and the same individual.
Relationship of Muc13 and HEG
The HEG (heart of glass) gene was first identified in
zebrafish where it regulates the growth of the heart [32].
Three isoforms are generated, one of which is predicted to
be transmembrane and two secreted. Homologues have
been identified in vertebrates, including man, and we now
identified a chicken homologue. We observed that this
protein is encoded by a gene adjacent to the Muc13 gene
on chromosome 7 and these two genes have the same
polarity. Synteny between chicken and man extends even
beyond these two genes in both directions. Analysis of the
human and mouse genomes shows that the HEG and
Muc13 genes are organized in the same manner in these
animals. Although Muc13 has an SEA domain which is
absent in HEG, there are interesting similiarities between
the two proteins as both have transmembrane, EGF and
PTS domains. This observation together with the fact that
the genes are in the same locus suggest an evolutionary
relationship.
The evolution of vertebrate mucins
The results of our inventory of mucins in vertebrates are
summarized in Table 1. In our previous study of F. rubripes
mucins, we concluded that this vertebrate has a set of gelforming mucins comparable to those of man and rodents.
Further analysis of F. rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis, and
Danio rerio as well as Ciona intestinalis suggest that some of
the mucins are quite different to the higher vertebrate
mucins (in preparation). In the chicken however, we
found obvious homologues of the primate and rodent
Muc2, Muc5ac, Muc5b, and Muc6. They are homologous
both with respect to sequence of the VWD domains as
well as to their localization and direction in the gene cluster. Interestingly, the chicken cluster contains an additional gene encoding ovomucin, found in egg white. This
gene seems to be present also in frogs and fishes (Lang, T.,
et al., unpublished observation), but has disappeared during the development of mammals and might not be
needed by animals where the fertilized egg is developed
within the female body. A more detailed study of the phylogenetic distribution of ovomucin will probably give
more clues as to its evolutionary history.

Whereas fish, chicken, and man have a reasonably similar
set of gel-forming mucins, many of the transmembrane
type mucins are missing in chicken and fish. In particular,
this is true for fish as only genes encoding Muc13 and a
MUC1-like protein was identified in F. rubripes. In the
chicken, also the transmembrane mucins Muc4 and
Muc16 were identified. Still the transmembrane mucins

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/197

homologous to the human MUC3, MUC12, and MUC17
seem to be missing in chicken as well as in fishes. These
mucins might therefore be a more recent development in
vertebrates. A more detailed view of the phylogeny of
these proteins will be crucial to better understand the evolution of mucins. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a
careful inventory of mucins in more animals.

Conclusion
We have identified several novel mucin homologues in
chicken. We have shown that chicken has a set of mucins
comparable to that of human although we fail to identify
a homologue to the gel-forming MUC19 and to the transmembrane MUC3, MUC12, MUC15 and MUC17 proteins.
Ovomucin, similar to Muc2 but without a PTS domain, is
a protein found in chicken but not in mammals. We now
have shown that the gene encoding ovomucin is part of a
locus highly homologous to a human locus containing
the Muc6, Muc2, Muc5ac, and Muc5b genes. We have also
demonstrated that the protein referred to as the β-subunit
of ovomucin is a protein homologous to human MUC6.
The chicken transmembrane mucin Muc13, as well as the
homologues in man and mouse, contains SEA, EGF and
PTS domains on the extracellular side of the membrane.
Both in chicken and mammals the HEG gene was found
to be located adjacent to the Muc13 gene. HEG is a transmembrane protein with EGF and PTS domains as Muc13,
although no SEA domain can be identified in HEG. Therefore, an evolutionary relationship between Muc13 and
HEG is implied.
Finally, we have shown that the PTS domain of Muc13 is
encoded by multiple exons, where each exon encodes a
repeat unit of the PTS domain. This is in contrast to previously described PTS domains that are all encoded by one
exon only. Allelic polymorphism affecting the length of
the PTS domain is observed in human mucins. The gene
organization in chicken suggests that a variability in the
PTS domain could also be accomplished within an individual through alternative splicing.

Methods
Sources of sequence information
As sources for protein and genomic sequences we used
UCSC [33], Ensembl [26], NCBI [34], and Celera [35].
Protein domain profiles were from Pfam [36]. We made
use of the ENSEMBL version of the chicken genome,
27.1d. The genomic DNA sequence had 111864 contigs,
with a total of 1,08 × 109 bases.

Bioinformatic methods
For identification of PTS domains we made use of
PTSpred that can be used to search both DNA and protein
sequences [2]. To identify Pfam domains we used for protein sequences hmmpfam of the hmmer package [37] and
for nucleotide sequences Genewise [24]. Transmembrane
domains were identified by TMHMM [38] and signal
sequences by SignalP [39]. For exon prediction Genscan
[40] was used. Alignments of proteins and DNA were
done by BLAST, ClustalW [41] or programs of the GCG
package (GCG, Madison, WI). The repetitive nature of the
PTS domains was analyzed with Dotplot of the GCG package. In house Perl scripts were used for additional tasks.
Analysis of chicken PTS, VWD and SEA domains of chicken
Two different sets of proteins were considered, on the one
hand, proteins predicted by ENSEMBL and on the other
hand, proteins predicted by ab initio methods. When analyzing the ENSEMBL proteins the PTS domain, VWD and
SEA domain analysis identified 146, 53 and 26 proteins,
respectively. Analysis of the corresponding set of proteins
predicted by ab initio methods resulted in 78 PTS, 52
VWD and 17 SEA domain candidates. Ten different proteins had both PTS and either VWD or SEA domains. Two
were identified as related to otogelin. The remaining eight
proteins were identified as Muc1 (weak candidate), Muc2,
Muc4, Muc5ac, Muc5b, Muc6, Muc13, and Muc16 and are
described under Results and Discussion. We also used
Genewise to scan the chicken genome sequence but that
analysis did not result in any additional strong mucin candidates.
