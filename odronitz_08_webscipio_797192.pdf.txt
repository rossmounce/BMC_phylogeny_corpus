Abstract
Background: Obtaining the gene structure for a given protein encoding gene is an important step
in many analyses. A software suited for this task should be readily accessible, accurate, easy to
handle and should provide the user with a coherent representation of the most probable gene
structure. It should be rigorous enough to optimise features on the level of single bases and at the
same time flexible enough to allow for cross-species searches.
Results: WebScipio, a web interface to the Scipio software, allows a user to obtain the
corresponding coding sequence structure of a here given a query protein sequence that belongs to
an already assembled eukaryotic genome. The resulting gene structure is presented in various
human readable formats like a schematic representation, and a detailed alignment of the query and
the target sequence highlighting any discrepancies. WebScipio can also be used to identify and
characterise the gene structures of homologs in related organisms. In addition, it offers a web
service for integration with other programs.
Conclusion: WebScipio is a tool that allows users to get a high-quality gene structure prediction
from a protein query. It offers more than 250 eukaryotic genomes that can be searched and
produces predictions that are close to what can be achieved by manual annotation, for in-species
and cross-species searches alike. WebScipio is freely accessible at http://www.webscipio.org.

Background
Gene prediction is one of the most important steps in
analyzing genome sequences. Mostly, de novo gene
prediction is based on sophisticated algorithms that
model open reading frames, consensus splice sites, and
start and stop codon sequences. Often additional data
like EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) sequences or information from cross-species multiple sequence alignments are
used. Cross-species DNA sequence comparisons are
increasingly being used to identify both coding regions

and functional DNA elements [1, 2]. These functional
elements might be promoter sequences, transcription
factor binding sites, termination signals or other
regulatory elements. Comparisons of sequences of
multiple species have either been performed at a
genomic level (e.g. [3, 4]) or at the single gene and
gene family scale (e.g. [5]).
One important aim of most of the large-scale comparative studies has been to improve the annotation of the

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:422

genomes, like the identification of new genes [6] or new
constitutive and alternative exons [7]. These studies have
also resulted in the prediction of regulatory regions [8].
However, only a limited number of the conserved noncoding sequences that have been identified by these
studies have been functionally characterized.
Cross-species DNA sequence alignments of entire genomes
are available for several eukaryotes [9, 10]. These genomes,
however, cover only a small part of the about 330 eukaryotic
genomes for which genome assemblies are available http://
www.diark.org, as of Feb. 2008 [11]). Thus, a comparison of
the genomic DNA sequences of a specific gene or gene
family of a certain set of species would require a lot of time
consuming manual steps. These involve obtaining the
desired eukaryotic genome assemblies, identifying all
homologous genes, and predicting their gene structures.
To retrieve gene data and non-coding sequence, some
programs and web-tools are available. The Retrieval of
Regulative Regions (RRE) tool is a Java application which
parses annotation and homology data from NCBI [12].
RRE is available as a web application, which however only
hosts a small number of eukaryotic genomes and annotation data only from NCBI, or requires local installation and
local copies of the desired genome and annotation files. In
addition, the non-coding sequences retrieval system
(NCSRS) has been developed [13] which offers access to
16 genomes and annotation data from both Ensembl [14]
and NCBI. Access to most vertebrates and some other
eukaryotes is offered by Ensembl and the UCSC browser
[15]. Both web interfaces allow to search for genes and to
recover any part of the gene of interest. However, when
searching the genomes with descriptive terms or accession
numbers, the output is mainly based on results from the
various gene prediction programs, although it is often
supported by evidence from cDNA or manual curation.
When using BLAST [16] or BLAT [17], the quality of the
resulting gene structure is limited by the parameters of
these programs. Of course there are further species-specific
genome pages providing access to gene data. But there is no
service offering the retrieval of the gene structures
corresponding to protein queries of almost all sequenced
and assembled eukaryotic genomes.
We have developed WebScipio, a web interface to the
Scipio software [18], which can determine the precise
gene structure given a protein sequence. WebScipio
provides access to a continuously updated list of almost
all eukaryotic genome assemblies that are available
worldwide (for a comprehensive list see http://www.
diark.org. Additionally, the user can retrieve all relevant
data in human readable format in a very convenient way.
For the integration with other programs, WebScipio
provides a web service.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/422

Implementation
The web application is implemented in the Ruby
programming language [19] using the Ruby on Rails
[20] framework. The list of the genome files available for
search are stored in an index file which is generated from
the diArk database [11]. We are searching for new
releases of genome data on a weekly basis, and as soon
as new data is released it will be available to WebScipio.
The index file contains metadata about the genomes, the
sequencing projects and the species (see also speciesselection section). As the user types into the text box, the
index file is searched at every keystroke and the matching
species are shown in a pulldown menu. The genome files
are updated manually by regularly searching the various
genome sequencing project pages for updates and new
genomes. After a genome file is selected, one or several
protein sequences are provided by the user, and the
parameters for BLAT and Scipio are collected. The
information needed for the run is then complete.
In order to improve the response time a script splits the
genome file into several files and starts a predefined
number of parallel BLAT jobs. This allows using the
multi-core architecture of modern servers without reimplementing the BLAT algorithm. The resulting PSLFiles are concatenated and Scipio [18] is started to
assemble and refine BLATs search results. Scipio saves
the results as a YAML file [21]. YAML is a simple data
serialization format which can store nested data structures. It is human readable and parsers exist for a great
number of programming languages.
The YAML file is then parsed and a graphical representation
is generated. WebScipio determines the optimal ratio for
the scaling of exons and introns so that large intron
sequences do not render the visualization useless. The
pictures of the gene structure are generated as publication
quality SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics [22]) but are
automatically be converted to PNG (Portable Network
Graphics [23]) if SVG is not supported by the browser.
The web service was also implemented using Ruby on Rails
and can be used with RPC (Remote Procedure Call) or SOAP
(Simple Object Access Protocol). The methods of the
application programming interface resemble the functionality of the website. A normal usage would be to call a series of
functions in order to arrive at a gene structure and a
visualization: SearchSpecies, SearchGenomes, Query, GetSvg.

Results and discussion
Web interface
WebScipio offers a clean and simple web interface that
can easily be used by inexperienced users. At the same
time expert users have enough options to adjust the

Page 2 of 13

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:422

underlying algorithm to get the best possible results,
even in difficult cases.
Species selection
Species are selected using an auto-completion field. The
user starts typing and a selection of species matching the
search term is shown. Apart from searching for the
scientific name of a species, many different types of
information can be searched for: Alternative scientific
names, common names, anamorph names (for fungi),
and taxonomy (Figure 1). Users can also search for
abbreviations of sequencing centers (e.g. 'JGI' for Joint
Genome Institute) or type of genome files (e.g.
'chromosome').
Genomes
WebScipio offers 751 genome files from 256 eukaryotes
(as of Feb. 2008) for searching, which amounts to more
than 360 gigabytes of sequence data. Genome data is
kept up to date, but at the same time older versions are
offered. Many different types of genome data can be
searched: Chromosomes, supercontigs, contigs, unplaced
reads/contigs as well as genome sequences from mitochondria, chloroplasts and apicoplasts, if available.
Protein query
The query for the search is one or several protein
sequences, which are entered plain or in FASTA format.
Search options
The search options define how tolerant the algorithm is
regarding contigs and exons (Figure 2). 'Best Size' defines
the minimum fraction of the query that has to be found
on one single contig. If, for example, the genome
sequence is in an early stage of assembly and highly
fragmented, the largest part that is found on one contig
might only be 20% of the query. 'Min Identity' defines
the minimal identity within a stretch of DNA in order to
be taken into account by WebScipio. 'Max Mismatch'
defines the maximum number of mismatches between
the query sequence and a contig in order to be included
in the results. The values for these parameters largely
depend on the quality of the genome. 'Region Size'
defines the length of the up-and downstream regions
that can be retrieved. 'BLAT Tilesize' determines the
width of the search window used to scan the genome.
Decreasing this value makes it more likely that small
exons are found but also slows down the search process.
Visualization
A characteristic of conventional spliced alignment tools
is that they produce lists of hits, maybe alongside with
basic graphics, but most of the time the user does not see
at a glance, what the gene structure might be. WebScipio

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/422

generates a graphical representation of the gene that
clearly indicates the length and position of exons and
introns and shows, where discrepancies are located. It also
shows the identifiers of the target sequences (Figure 3).
In order not to make small exons vanish when very
large intronic stretches are found, the scaling of introns
and exons is automatically balanced to make the picture visually meaningful. Tooltips show additional
information.
Alignments, DNA and target translation
For detailed inspection of the hits, WebScipio generates
an easy to read alignment of the query and the genome.
It is grouped by exons, and mismatches and frame shifts
are highlighted. Different stretches of DNA can be
viewed: Up- and downstream DNA, genomic DNA
from the first to the last exon including introns, or the
coding DNA. The translation of the coding DNA as
determined by the algorithm can also be viewed.
File download
Six types of files can be downloaded: A FASTA file
containing all types of DNA sequences as described
above, a FASTA file containing the protein translation, a
log file with alignments and detailed reports, a GFF file
(General Feature Format) for use with genome software,
an SVG file containing the graphical representation of
the gene structure, and a YAML file which contains all
information generated by WebScipio.
File upload
WebScipio can also be used as a viewer for Scipio result
files. When a YAML file of a previous search is uploaded,
all result views are available. This way, users can store the
results of their searches locally and can look at them any
time, instead of repeating extensive searches. WebScipio
can thus also be used as a viewer for results obtained
from Scipio, the command line version of the program.
Web service
All functions of WebScipio can also be used remotely as
a web service. This allows for seamless integration with
existing programs. Many modern programming languages offer built-in support for the required protocols.
This frees programmers from the need to locally install
software and to download and store large genome files.
By using this service, it is easy to augment existing data
with information produced by WebScipio. In-house, we
use WebScipio's web service to determine the gene
structure of thousands of motor proteins stored in
CyMoBase (http://www.cymobase.org, [24]). Storing
the YAML data produced by WebScipio in a database
and parsing it on demand is a powerful way of using this

data structures can be obtained upon request.
Cross-species analysis of myosins in Human, Orangutan,
Common marmoset, and Mouse
The performance of Scipio and therefore WebScipio in
an in-species scenario has been demonstrated already
[18]. To test the capability of WebScipio when searching
in species other than the origin of the query, we
performed searches in four species, Homo sapiens
(Human), as a reference, and Pongo pygmaeus (Orangutan), Callithrix jacchus (Common marmoset), and Mus
musculus (Mouse) (ordered by increasing phylogenetic
distance to Human). As queries we used a set of 40
manually annotated myosin protein sequences as
described in ([25], see Additional file 1). For each
species two searches were performed, one with the
myosins from the species itself and one with the myosins
from Human, giving a total of 280 searches.

We are confident that the manually annotated sequences
we used as queries contain the least possible number of
errors, since we compared them to EST data and dozens
of homologues sequences from other species. Thus, most
discrepancies with their source genomes are due to
sequencing errors and low coverage. For each search we
provide two percentages: The first and most significant
number is the percentage of protein stretches that could
be mapped onto the genome, allowing for mismatches
that naturally occur when doing cross-species searches.
The second number is the percentage of individual
amino acids that could be aligned with codons on the
genome, counting all discrepancies.
As expected the agreement is very high when searching
with queries from the target genome itself. But also when
queries from Humans are used to search genomes from
other species, WebScipio is able to map most of the
genes correctly. For Pongo and Callitrix, on average, more
than 96% percent of the Human query sequences were
successfully found in the genomes. Even in Mouse,
which is much more diverged, the difference between

Searches were performed using a tile size of 5.

searching with a native query and searching with a query
from Human is below 5%, meaning than in most cases,
the structure of genes can be predicted with only minor
gaps and inaccuracies. Figures 4, 5, 6, 7 show typical
examples of in-species searches and cross-species
searches for myosin class-I proteins. The searches against
the source genome are all almost perfect matches. Only
in the Pongo and mouse genomes, three genes could only
be mapped with gaps (PpyMyo1B, MmMyo1A,
MmMyo1F). Cross-species searches are, apart from the
expected mismatches, almost as complete as the inspecies searches.
For Pongo, three cross-species searches resulted in a
reduction of the matching rate of less than five percent
(Myo1A, Myo1B, Myo1E), three stayed the same
(Myo1C, Myo1D, Myo1H), one got considerable worse
(Myo1F), which can be attributed to the poor genome
sequence in this region which contains stretches of N's.
Using HsMyo1G as query, the Pongo homolog was found
with better agreement since in this case WebScipio found
a perfect 27 bp match on another contig, which was not
present in the search results using the PpyMyo1G
sequence as query.
In Callitrix, six out of the eight Human sequences where
found with the same percentage as the Callitrix sequences
(Myo1A, Myo1B, Myo1D, Myo1E, Myo1F, Myo1H) and
two with minor losses (Myo1C, Myo1G). In the Mouse
genome, three sequences where found with the same
(Myo1B, Myo1C, Myo1D), two with very similar
(Myo1E, Myo1G) agreement. For HsMyo1H, the percentage decreased considerable. Myo1F was not found;
instead, it was matched with the gene of Myo1E, a close
homolog. The reason for this probably is the high degree
of fragmentation or the occurrence of large gaps in the
region of the Myo1F gene. The observation that Human
Myo1A can be slightly better mapped than the one from
Mouse can be attributed to noise, since both hits have a
low percentage of agreement (less than 40%).
Future developments
For many applications it is useful to have information
about the structures of genes in closely related species.
Therefore, we plan on implementing a feature to select
species based on a taxonomic tree. Also, we plan to
include an option to search in several genomes
simultaneously using the same query sequence.

Conclusion
WebScipio is a service that maps protein queries onto a
genome. All functionality and data resides on the server,
so it is not required that the user installs software or
downloads large files. WebScipio can be used through its

result of a search is a coherent prediction of the gene
structure, consisting of a plausible combination of DNA

contigs, searches in genomes that are in an early stage of
assembly are possible. The success rate of in-species
searches is very high and the quality approaches the one

of manual annotation. For cross-species searches, the
tolerance of WebScipio makes it possible to find gene
structures even in species with considerable phylogenetic
distance to the source organism of the protein sequence.

We think that WebScipio can in many cases provide even
non-specialists with gene structure predictions that are
coherent and precise, therefore leading to more meaningful analyses.
