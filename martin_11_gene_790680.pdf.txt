The gene transformer-2 of Sciara (Diptera,
Nematocera) and its effect on Drosophila
sexual development
Iker Martín1, María F Ruiz1*, Lucas Sánchez2*

Abstract
Background: The gene transformer-2, which is involved in sex determination, has been studied in Drosophila,
Musca, Ceratitis, Anastrepha and Lucilia. All these members of Diptera belong to the suborder Brachycera. In this
work, it is reported the isolation and characterisation of genes transformer-2 of the dipterans Sciara ocellaris and
Bradysia coprophila (formerly Sciara coprophila), which belong to the much less extensively analysed Sciaridae
Family of the Suborder Nematocera, which is paraphyletic with respect to Suborder Brachycera.
Results: The transformer-2 genes of the studied Sciara species were found to be transcribed in both sexes during
development and adult life, in both the soma and germ lines. They produced a single primary transcript, which
follows the same alternative splicing in both sexes, giving rise to different mRNAs isoforms. In S. ocellaris the most
abundant mRNA isoform encoded a full-length protein of 251 amino acids, while that of B. coprophila encoded a
protein of 246 amino acids. Both showed the features of the SR protein family. The less significant mRNA isoforms
of both species encoded truncated, presumably non-functional Transformer-2 proteins. The comparison of the
functional Sciara Transformer-2 proteins among themselves and those of other insects revealed the greatest
degree of conservation in the RRM domain and linker region. In contrast, the RS1 and RS2 domains showed
extensive variation with respect to their number of amino acids and their arginine-serine (RS) dipeptide content.
The expression of S. ocellaris Transformer-2 protein in Drosophila XX pseudomales lacking the endogenous
transformer-2 function caused their partial feminisation.
Conclusions: The transformer-2 genes of both Sciaridae species encode a single protein in both sexes that shares the
characteristics of the Transformer-2 proteins of other insects. These proteins showed conserved sex-determination
function in Drosophila; i.e., they were able to form a complex with the endogenous Drosophila Transformer protein that
controls the female-specific splicing of the Drosophila doublesex pre-mRNA. However, it appears that the complex formed
between the Drosophila Transformer protein and the Sciara Transformer-2 protein is less effective at inducing the femalespecific splicing of the endogenous Drosophila doublesex pre-mRNA than the DrosophilaTransformer-Transformer2
complex. This suggests the existence of species-specific co-evolution of the Transformer and Transformer-2 proteins.

Background
Sex determination refers to the developmental programme that commits the embryo to following either the
male or the female pathway. Recent years have seen a
great amount of interest in the evolution of developmental mechanisms at the genetic and molecular levels, and

in determining the evolutionary processes by which these
mechanisms came into existence. Given the great variety
of sex determination mechanisms, this process is exceptionally suitable for comparative study. Indeed, sex determination has long been of major interest not only as a
developmental process but also because of the evolutionary problem it poses - a problem that can only be solved
by identifying and comparing the genetic structures of
sex determination pathways. Molecular genetic technologies now allow such comparisons to be made. In addition, sex determination in the Drosophila melanogaster

reference system is known in fine detail, making truly
informative comparisons possible.
The characterisation of the sex determination genes in
D. melanogaster has shown that their control during
development is governed by the sex-specific splicing of
their products (reviewed in [1]). The product of a gene
controls the sex-specific splicing of the pre-mRNA from
the downstream gene in the genetic cascade. Sex-lethal
(Sxl) is at the top of this cascade and acts as the memory device for female sexual development via its autoregulatory function: its product controls the splicing of
its own pre-mRNA [2,3]. In addition, Sxl controls the
splicing of the pre-mRNA from the downstream gene
transformer (tra) [4-6]. The Tra product and the product of the constitutive gene transformer-2 (tra-2) control the sex-specific splicing of pre-mRNA from the
gene doublesex (dsx) [7-10], which is transcribed in both
sexes but gives rise to two different proteins, DsxF and
DsxM [11,12]. These are transcription factors that
impose female and male sexual development respectively
via the sex-specific regulation of the so-called sexual
cytodifferentiation genes.
Genes homologous to the sex determination genes of
D. melanogaster have been sought in other insects
(reviewed in [13-15]). In the sciarid flies, which belong
to the dipteran suborder Nematocera, only the orthologues of gene Sxl have been characterised in Sciara ocellaris [16], Bradysia coprophila, Rynchosciara americana
and Trichosia pubescens [17]. The Sxl gene of these species is not regulated in a sex-specific fashion, and therefore the same Sxl transcript encoding the functional Sxl
protein is found in both males and females. Thus, in the
sciarids, Sxl does not appear to play the key discriminating role in sex determination that it plays in Drosophila.
Apart from in D. melanogaster, the gene tra-2 has
been studied in D. virilis [18], and has been characterised in the housefly Musca domestica [19], in the
tephritid Ceratitis capitata [20,21], in twelve Anastrepha
species [22], and in the calliphorid Lucilia cuprina [23].
Outside the dipterans, tra-2 has been isolated in the
lepidopteron Bombyx mori [24]. In all cases tra-2 is
transcribed in both sexes during development, producing the same protein in males and females. The injection of Musca tra-2 dsRNA into Musca embryos results
in the complete transformation of genotypically female
embryos into fertile adult males, highlighting the role of
tra-2 in Musca sex determination. This gene is required
for the female-specific splicing of Musca dsx premRNA. It also participates in the autocatalytic activity
of gene F [19], i.e., the Musca tra orthologous gene [25],
the key sex-determining gene in the housefly [26]. The
injection of the respective tra2-dsRNA into Ceratitis
[21] and Anastrepha [22] results in the destruction of
endogenous tra-2 function in both species and the

subsequent male-specific splicing of the endogenous tra
and dsx pre-mRNAs, leading to the transformation of
genotypically female embryos into adult pseudomales.
This highlights the role of tra-2 in Ceratitis and Anastrepha sex determination.
The present paper reports the isolation and characterisation of tra-2 of S. ocellaris and B. coprophila (formerly
Sciara coprophila). Their Tra2 proteins were compared
to other known insect Tra2 proteins and the effect of
Sciara tra-2 on Drosophila sex determination analysed.

Results and discussion
Molecular organisation of tra-2 in S. ocellaris and B.
coprophila

The first step in the isolation of the S. ocellaris tra-2
gene (Sotra2) was to perform RT-PCR on total RNA
from adults. Reverse transcription was performed using
the primer oligo-dT, while two-nested PCR reactions
were performed with three degenerated primers: Mar17,
Mar26 and Tra2.B (the location and the sequences of
the primers used in this work are shown in Additional
file 1). The first PCR reaction was performed using the
primer pair Mar26 plus Mar17, the second using Mar26
plus Tra2.B. An amplicon of 133 bp was amplified,
cloned and sequenced. The conceptual amino acid
sequence of this amplicon showed a high degree of similarity with the 3’ region of the RRM domain of the
D. melanogaster Tra2 protein, indicating that a fragment
of the putative SoTra2 protein had been isolated.
Nested PCR reactions were then performed in 3’ and 5’
RACE analyses. The amplicons were then cloned and
sequenced. A GenomeWalker library for S. ocellaris was
then synthesised and used to perform PCR genome-walking on the genomic DNA of S. ocellaris from the initial
amplicon towards the 5’ and 3’ directions. The genomic
amplicons were cloned and sequenced. The sequences of
the genomic fragments thus generated were compared
with the cDNA sequences previously determined. In this
way, the exon/intron junctions were unambiguously identified. Figure 1A shows the molecular organisation of
Sotra2. Its transcription unit was made up of 4601 bp and
was composed of six exons and five introns (Figure 1A).
The transcription start site was located 94 bp upstream of
the translation initiation codon.
Overlapping PCR on total RNA of S. ocellaris males
and females showed that the gene Sotra2 mainly produced the transcript Sotra2-251, formed by exons E1E2-E3-E4b-E5-E6 (1177 bp). This encoded a full-length
putative Tra2 protein of 251 amino acids that included
the RS1, RS2 and RRM domains characteristic of the
Tra2 proteins. Two other less abundant transcripts were
also detected: Sotra2-204 and Sotra2-130 (Figure 1A)
(see Methods). The Sotra2-204 transcript differed from
Sotra2-251 in its lack of exon 3, and it encoded a

putative Tra2 protein of 204 amino acids that differed
from the full Tra2 protein in its shorter RS1 domain.
The Sotra2-130 transcript differed from Sotra2-251 by
the inclusion of exon E4a. The latter carries translation
stop codons causing the production of a truncated Tra2
protein 130 amino acids long and lacking both the RRM
and RS2 domains.
To isolate the gene tra-2 of B. coprophila (Bctra2), the
same strategy used for the isolation of this gene in
S. ocellaris was followed, except that the initial step
involved PCR amplification of the genomic DNA of
adults using primers expSoT2.1 and expSoT2.2, corresponding to exons 5 and 6 of Sotra2. A genomic fragment of 1069 bp was amplified, cloned and sequenced.
Its sequence showed 61% similarity to the corresponding
region of Sotra2, suggesting that a genomic fragment of
Bctra2 had been cloned. As for Sotra2, 5’RACE, 3’RACE
and genome-walking methodologies were used to determine the molecular organisation of Bctra2 (Figure 1B).
Its transcription unit was made up of 4255 bp and was
composed of six exons and five introns.
Overlapping PCR performed on total RNA of males
and females of B. coprophila showed that the gene
Bctra2 mainly produced the transcript Bctra2-246,
formed by exons E1-E2-E3-E4b-E5-E6 (1444 bp). This
encoded a full putative Tra2 protein of 246 amino acids
and included the RS1, RS2 and RRM domains characteristic of Tra2 proteins. Three other less abundant transcripts were also detected: Bctra2-203, Bctra2-99 and
Bctra2-75 (Figure 1B) (see Methods). The Bctra2-203
transcript differed from Bctra2-246 in its lack of exon 3;
it encoded a putative Tra2 protein of 203 amino acids.
The Bctra2-99 transcript varied from Bctra2-246 by the
inclusion of exon E4a, which carries translation stop
codons. Thus, it produced a truncated Tra2 protein of
99 amino acids that lacked both the RRM and RS2
domains. Finally, the Bctra2-75 transcript, made up by
exons E1, E2 and E6, encoded a truncated Tra2 protein
with short RS1, RRM and RS2 domains.

both Sciara species. The expression of the constitutive
gene rpL10, which encodes the ribosomal protein L10,
was used as a control in RT-PCR. In all cases, a fragment of 273 bp was amplified (Figure 2B,C). This was
cloned and sequenced, confirming that it corresponded
to the expected Sotra2 or Bctra2 fragment. Negative
controls in all these PCR reactions produced no amplicons (see Methods). These results indicate that the
genes Sotra2 and Bctra2 are expressed at all developmental stages and during adult life in both sexes, including in the gonads of males and females.

Expression pattern of tra-2 in S. ocellaris and B. coprophila

Comparison of the Tra2 protein of Sciara with that of
other insects

The expression of tra2 in S. ocellaris was studied by
performing RT-PCR on total RNA from a mixture of
male plus female embryos, from a mixture of male plus
female larvae at different developmental stages, from the
heads plus thoraces of male and female adults (separately), from the abdomens of male and female adults
(separately), and from adult ovaries and testis (separately). The expression of tra2 in B. coprophila was
similarly analysed, although in this case it was possible
to distinguish male from female embryos as well as
male from female larvae (see Methods). The primers
used were expSoT2.1 from exon 5 and expSoT2.2 from
exon 6 (Figure 2A), which have the same sequence in

Comparison of the molecular organisation of Sciara tra-2
gene with that of other insects

The gene tra-2 of D. melanogaster gives rise to three
mRNAs by alternative splicing pathways and alternative
promoters, which encode three distinct isoforms of the
Tra2 protein [27,28]. In B. mori, tra-2 produces six different transcripts by alternative splicing pathways, which
encode six distinct isoforms of the Tra2 protein [24]. In
the case of other dipterans such as C. capitata [20,21],
Anastrepha species [22], M. domestica [19] and
L. cuprina [23], only a single tra-2 mRNA was detected.
Figure 3 compares the molecular organisation of Sciara
tra-2 with tra-2 of Drosophila, Ceratitis, Musca and
Bombyx. The number of exons varies: six in Sciara, seven
in Drosophila, eight in Ceratitis and Musca, and nine in
Bombyx. In Sciara, all the exon/intron junctions agree
with the consensus GT/AG. These joints are found in the
same position in S. ocellaris and B. coprophila. Similarly,
the connection between exons 5 and 6 is in the same
position in all these species. The RS1 and RRM domains
of the putative Tra2 proteins are encoded by the exons
E2-E4 and exons E5-E6 respectively in all species. However, the RS2 domain is encoded by exon E6 in Sciara, by
exons E6-E7 in Drosophila, by exons E6b-E7 in Ceratitis,
by exons E6-E7 in Musca, and by exons E7-E8 in Bombyx. The gene tra-2 has a single promoter except in
Drosophila, which carries two promoters.

The conceptual translation of the Sotra2-251 and
Bctra2-246 mRNAs showed them to encode a polypeptide with the main structural features characteristic of
the SR protein family, i.e., the RNA-binding motif
(RRM) and two RS-domains. These are rich in serinearginine dipeptides and confer upon these proteins the
capacity to interact with others.
The putative Tra2 protein of the dipterans S. ocellaris
and B. coprophila (Sciaridae, suborder Nematocera)
were compared to those of the dipterans belonging to
the suborder Brachycera, i.e., D. melanogaster (Drosophilidae), C. capitata (Tephritidae), M. domestica

D. melanogaster 264, C. capitata 251, M. domestica 232,
L. cuprina 271, and B. mori 274. These differences are

due to changes throughout the Tra2 protein except in
the RRM domain and the linker region (72 and 19
amino acids respectively) in all these species. The highest degree of similarity (measured as identical plus conserved amino acids) to S. ocellaris was shown by
B. coprophila (86%) (as expected for species belonging

to the same Family), followed by Musca (46.9%), Bombyx (44.6%), Ceratitis (42.6%), Lucilia (39,4%) and Drosophila (36.3%). The highest degree of similarity was
observed in the RRM (55.5-94.4%) and the linker region
(68.4-100%). In fact, the linker region is a signature
motif of Tra2 proteins [29]. This conservation agrees
with the fundamental role of RRM in the function of
the Tra-Tra2 complex, conferring upon the complex its

capacity to interact with the tra and dsx pre-mRNAs
and thus regulate its sex-specific splicing. The similarity
of the RS1 (21.8-87.6%) and RS2 (28.2-81.6%) domains
was lower and a variable number of SR dipeptides were
seen, ranging from 11 to 18 for RS1 and 3 to 6 for RS2.
Variation in the content of RS dipeptides seems to be a
feature of the SR proteins whenever they are maintained
enough to preserve their function [30].

Effect of the gene tra-2 of Sciara on the somatic sexual
development of Drosophila

Outside Drosophila, the function of tra-2 in sex determination has been unambiguously demonstrated in
M. domestica [19], in C. capitata [21] and in Anastrepha [22] using the interference-RNA technique, which
permits functional studies of genes in genetically less
amenable organisms. An imperative of this technique is
to have markers that allow one to determine whether
male survivors really do correspond to XX females that
have been transformed into pseudomales by the destruction of the endogenous tra-2 gene function, or to normal XY males. In the case of the insects mentioned
above, this distinction was possible thanks to the existence of molecular markers located on the Y chromosome [19,21] and to the different morphology of the X
and Y chromosomes [22]. However, the lack of molecular makers, plus the fact that Sciara females are XX and
males are X0, together with the extreme fragility of their
tiny eggs, makes this RNAi procedure unfeasible for
these insects at the present time. Thus, direct proof of
the role of tra-2 in Sciara sex determination remains
elusive.
Notwithstanding, we were able to study whether the
Sciara Tra2 protein shows conserved sex-determination
function in Drosophila. The rationale of the experiment
was to express transgenic SoTra2 protein in Drosophila
XX pseudomales lacking the tra-2 gene function and
checked whether these pseudomales showed feminisation. The GAL4-UAS system was used to analyse the
effect of the Sciara tra-2 gene in Drosophila.
The systemic expression of SoTra2 with the ubiquitous-expression da-GAL4 or hs-GAL4 drivers was found
to be lethal to both male and female flies. The same
lethality has been observed in Drosophila males and
females that ectopically express their own Tra2 protein
[31]. Therefore, the rn-GAL4 local expression driver was
used. This driver expresses GAL4 in agreement with the
expression domain of the gene rotund (rn), which is
expressed in the tarsal region of the foreleg imaginal
disc [32], a well-characterised sexually dimorphic region
of Drosophila. For details of the experimental design see
Methods.
Figure 5 shows the effect of expressing the SoTra2
protein on the sexually dimorphic development of the
foreleg basitarsus in XX pseudomales and in their
brother XY males, both mutant for tra-2 and carrying
Sotra2-UAS, rn-GAL4 and Tub-GAL80 ts . The foreleg
basitarsus contained several transversal rows, the last
one forming the sex comb structure (SC) in males and
in XX pseudomales mutants for tra-2. This is composed
of dark, thick bristles, and is rotated to lie parallel to the
proximal-distal leg axis (Figure 5C). Females lack the sex
comb (Figure 5B). A significant reduction (P < 0.0001,

Page 8 of 13

one-way ANOVA) was seen in the number of bristles
forming the male sex comb structure in the foreleg basitarsus of XX pseudomales raised at 25°C (expressing the
SoTra2 protein) (see Figure 5D and the enlargement in
Figure 5E) compared to those raised at 18°C (no expression of the SoTra2 protein) (see Figure 5C). The sex
comb size of these latter pseudomales was the same as
the sex comb of their XY brothers whether raised at 18
or 25°C (Figure 5A). Thus, the Sciara Tra-2 protein supplies tra-2 function in Drosophila.
This reversion of the male towards the female phenotype of the foreleg basitarsus in XX pseudomales mutant
for tra-2 and expressing the SoTra2 protein is probably
caused by the presence of the endogenous Drosophila
DsxF protein. As mentioned in the Introduction, the
Tra-Tra2 complex controls the female-specific splicing
of the dsx pre-mRNA. If the Sciara Tra2 protein is capable of forming a complex with the endogenous Drosophila Tra protein, then this complex could bind to
specific sequences in the female-specific exon of dsx
pre-mRNA. This would promote its inclusion in mature
dsxF mRNA, which encodes the DsxF protein that
establishes female development. This expectation was
confirmed at the molecular level.
The effect of Sciara Tra2 protein on the splicing control of Drosophila dsx pre-mRNA was studied in transgenic Drosophila XX flies mutant for tra-2 and
expressing the Sciara Tra2 protein (Figure 6). The inducible hs-GAL4 driver was used to express the Sotra2
transgene. XX pseudomales yw/w; Df(2R)trix,tra-2[-]/tra2B; Sotra2/hs-GAL4 were produced at 25°C (see cross in
the legend to Figure 6). After the hatching of the adults
the flies were divided into two populations; one was
maintained at 25°C (control flies) and one subjected to
heat-shock pulses (experimental flies) to induce the
expression of the Sotra2 transgene. Total RNA was
extracted and used in RT-PCR to determine the splicing
pattern of the endogenous dsx primary transcript. rp49,
which codes for the constitutive ribosomal protein 49
[33], was used as an RT-PCR control. At 25°C, the four
transgenic lines only expressed the male dsx mRNA isoform (data not shown); this was to be expected since
they lack the endogenous tra-2 function and do not
express the Sotra2 transgene. After the heat shocks, however, these transgenic lines expressed the female dsx
mRNA isoform (Figure 6B). Two amplicons were
detected. The smaller one (646 bp) corresponded to the
female dsxF mRNA. The larger amplicon (758 bp) was to
be expected if the intron 3 were retained (Figure 6A,B).
The cloning and sequencing of both fragments confirmed
these suppositions. These results were not the consequence of the heat-shocks since their brothers (males yw/
Y; Df(2R)trix,tra2[-]/tra-2B; Sotra2/hs-GAL4) expressing
the Sotra2 transgene did not express the female dsx

mRNA isoform (Figure 6C). Negative controls for all
these PCR reactions produced no amplicons (see Methods). Thus, the Sciara Tra2 protein is able to promote
the female-specific splicing of the Drosophila dsx premRNA.
Whereas the expression of Sciara Tra2 protein in the
XX pseudomales produced their feminisation, its expression in their XY normal brothers mutant for tra-2 did
not affect their normal male development. This different
effect is explained by the presence of Tra protein in the
XX pseudomales and its absence in XY normal males.
The Drosophila Tra protein seems to lack an RNA binding domain, thus its influence in female development is
exerted at the level of its interaction (via SR domains)
with other proteins carrying RNA-binding domains,
such as Tra2 (reviewed in [34]). Therefore, the Sciara
Tra2 protein would form a complex with the endogenous Drosophila Tra protein to promote the femalespecific splicing of the Drosophila dsx pre-mRNA.
The feminisation produced by the Sciara Tra2 protein
was, however, partial, indicating that the function of this
protein in Drosophila was incomplete. There are two
possible explanations for this. It might be due to an
insufficient quantity of Sciara Tra2 protein being produced in the Drosophila transgenic flies; it was necessary
to restrict the amount of Sciara Tra2 protein that was
expressed since the production of any greater amount is
lethal. However, although this possibility cannot be
rejected outright it seems unlikely since Drosophila XX
flies with a single dose of tra-2 develop as normal
females; i.e., a single dose of the endogenous tra-2 gene
supplies enough Drosophila Tra2 protein for normal
female development to be followed. Alternatively, the
interaction between the endogenous Drosophila Tra
protein and the transgenic Sciara Tra2 protein might be
affected such that the DrosophilaTra-SciaraTra2 complex is less efficient than the DrosophilaTra-Tra2 complex at inducing the female-specific splicing of the
endogenous Drosophila dsx pre-mRNA. This explanation agrees with the presence of the aberrant spliced
dsxF mRNA isoform in XX pseudomales expressing the
Sciara Tra2 protein in addition to the normally spliced
dsxF mRNA. Note that this isoform contains intron 3,
the target where the Tra-Tra2 complex binds to promote its inclusion into mature dsxF mRNA [7-10].
Further, the retention of intron 3 does not appear to be
the consequence of any general trouble in the splicing
of dsx pre-mRNA since intron 2 (and probably also
intron 1) is normally spliced.
This aberrant dsxF mRNA isoform has been also
found in Drosophila XX pseudomales mutant for the
endogenous tra gene and expressing the Anastrepha Tra
protein, whereas Drosophila XX flies with different

doses of the endogenous tra and tra-2 genes do not
show this abnormally spliced dsxF mRNA isoform [35].
With respect to the proposed inefficient interaction
between the endogenous Drosophila Tra protein and the
transgenic Sciara Tra2 protein, the high degree of divergence between the Sciara and the Drosophila Tra2 proteins should be noted. This divergence was mainly
observed in the RS domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. Hence, the interaction between
the Sciara Tra2 protein and the Drosophila Tra protein
might be impeded as a consequence of changes accumulated in these proteins after the Sciara and Drosophila
phylogenetic lineages separated. These results suggest
that Tra and Tra2 proteins co-evolved to exert their
functions in sex determination. To this respect, it is
worth mentioning that the D. virilis tra-2 gene can fully
replace the endogenous tra-2 function of D. melanogaster for normal female sexual development [18]. The
similarity between the D. melanogaster and D. virilis
Tra-2 proteins is 51,5% [22], whereas the similarity
between the D. melanogaster and S. ocellaris Tra-2 proteins is 36.3% [this work].

Conclusions
The transformer-2 genes of both Sciaridae species
encode a single protein in both sexes that shares the
characteristics of the Transformer-2 proteins of other
insects. These proteins showed conserved sex-determination function in Drosophila; i.e., they were able to
form a complex with the endogenous Drosophila Transformer protein that controls the female-specific splicing
of the Drosophila doublesex pre-mRNA. However, it
appears that the complex formed between the Drosophila Transformer protein and the Sciara Transformer2 protein is less effective at inducing the female-specific
splicing of the endogenous Drosophila doublesex premRNA than the DrosophilaTransformer-Transformer2
complex. This suggests the existence of species-specific
co-evolution of the Transformer and Transformer-2
proteins.
Methods
Flies and crosses

Sciarid flies were raised on “Compost Villacasa” medium
for culturing mushrooms. S. ocellaris is a digenic species
so that females produce both sexes, whereas B. coprophila is a monogenic species with two types of females:
gynogenic females, which produce only females, and
androgenic females, which produce only males.
Drosophila flies were cultured on standard food. For
the description of the mutant alleles and GAL4 constructs see Lindsley and Zimm [36] and FlyBase. Flies
used for the analysis of the adult forelegs were kept in a
mixture of ethanol:glycerol (3:1) for several days. They

were then macerated in 10% KOH at 60°C for 15 min,
thoroughly washed with water, and mounted in Faure’s
solution for inspection under a compound microscope.
Experimental design to analyse the effect of the gene
tra-2 of Sciara on the somatic sexual development of
Drosophila

As mentioned in the text, the systemic expression of
SoTra2 with the ubiquitous-expression da-GAL4 or
hs-GAL4 drivers was found to be lethal to both male
and female flies. Therefore, the rn-GAL4 local expression driver was used. Nevertheless, it was necessary to
find out the experimental conditions that allowed us to
study the effect of the gene tra-2 of Sciara on the
somatic sexual development of Drosophila. The rnGAL4 driver expresses GAL4 in agreement with the
expression domain of the gene rotund (rn) [32]. This
gene is expressed in imaginal discs as well as in the
embryonic and larval central nervous systems (CNS)
[32]. The expression of rn in the tarsal region of the
foreleg imaginal disc commences during the early third
larval instar, but is no longer evident in the late third
instar [32]. This methodology has been used to ablate
the sex comb in Drosophila males expressing the Transformer protein under the rn-GAL4 driver [37]. The
expression of Sotra2 by the rn-GAL4 driver was also
lethal to both males and females. This might be due to
the expression of Sotra2 in the embryonic and/or larval
CNS, as mentioned above. To prevent embryonic lethality a strategy was followed that allowed the temporal
control of Sotra2 expression under the rn-GAL4 driver
during development. For this purpose the GAL4/GAL80
system was used. The GAL80 protein inhibits GAL4
function. GAL80 is temperature sensitive, with 18°C the
most permissive temperature and 29°C the most restrictive [38]. Drosophila XX pseudomales mutant for tra-2
and carrying Sotra-2-UAS together with rn-GAL4 and
Tub-GAL80ts were produced. The cross producing these
pseudomales was performed at 18°C, and several twodays egg collections were made. Three days later each
collection was transferred to 29°C environment. By this
time the larvae had hatched, which were maintained at
this temperature for the rest of their development. This
treatment eliminated the embryonic lethality caused by
the expression of the SoTra2 protein; at 18°C the UASSotra2 transgen is not expressed since the GAL4 protein
from the rn-GAL4 driver is not functional due to the
function of GAL80ts protein. However, the expression of
Sotra2 during the larval stage could not be prevented
since at 29°C this transgene is expressed due to the
inactivation of the GAL80ts protein. Even under these
conditions, the males and females expressing the SoTra2
protein were lethally affected, probably because of an
excess of this transgenic protein affecting the

Martín et al. BMC Developmental Biology 2011, 11:19

development of the larval CNS. Finally, we took advantage of the fact that at 25°C the GAL80ts protein retains
some function [38]. It was reasoned that if XX pseudomales mutant for tra-2 and carrying Sotra-2-UAS, rnGAL4 and Tub-GAL80ts can develop at that temperature, the GAL4 from the rn-GAL4 driver ought not to
be completely inhibited. Consequently a certain amount
of SoTra2 protein ought to be produced (less than at
29°C) but which might not be lethal. Thus, these pseudomales might be able to survive to adulthood. This was
the case.

Molecular analyses

Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen specimens as
described in Maniatis et al. [39]. Total RNA from adult
female ovaries, adult male testis, embryos, larvae, and
adult male and female somatic cells was prepared using
the Ultraspec-II RNA isolation kit (Biotecx) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Five micrograms of total
RNA from each sample were reverse transcribed with
Superscript (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with an oligo-dT. Two percent of the synthesised
cDNA was amplified by PCR. All amplicons were analysed by electrophoresis in agarose gels, cloned using the
TOPO TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen) or PGEM-T vector
(Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and
sequenced. In all cases, PCR reactions with RNA samples
were performed to guarantee there was no contamination
with genomic DNA (negative controls of PCR reactions).
The relative abundance of distinct mRNA isoforms was
inferred from the different intensity of their corresponding amplicons in the agarose gels showing the products
of the RT-PCR reactions. In some cases, the amplicons
were not clearly visible in the gel.
The GenomeWalker genomic libraries of S. ocellaris
and B. coprophila were synthesised using the BD GenomeWalker Universal kit (BD Biosciences), following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
For the construction of the Sotra2 transgene, the tra-2
ORF of S. ocellaris was amplified by RT-PCR. The PCR
reaction was performed using primers 5’SoT2 and
3’SoT2. The resulting amplicon was cloned in pUAST.
The microinjections for generating the TDSo (UAS::
Sotra-2 cDNA) transgenic D. melanogaster lines were
performed by Genetic Services (Sudbury, MA, USA). To
ascertain that each transgenic line was carrying the correct transgene, PCR on genomic DNA was used to
amplify the whole transgene. The amplicons were then
cloned and sequenced.
DNA sequencing

Sequencing was performed using an automated 377
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The analysis of
