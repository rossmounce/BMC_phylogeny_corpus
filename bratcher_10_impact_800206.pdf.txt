The impact of antiretroviral therapy on HPV and
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: current evidence
and directions for future research
Review

Lara F Bratcher1 and Vikrant V Sahasrabuddhe*2

Abstract
Increasing numbers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women are now accessing life-prolonging highly
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in developing countries. There is a need for better understanding of interactions
of human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV, especially in the context of increasing life expectancy due to HAART. The data
regarding the impact of HAART on reducing the incidence and progression and facilitating the regression of HPV
infection and cervical abnormalities is largely inconsistent. Published studies differ in their study designs (prospective
or retrospective cohorts or record linkage studies), screening and diagnostic protocols, duration and type of HAART
use, recruitment and referral strategies, and definitions of screening test and disease positivity. Due to the ethical and
resource limitations in conducting randomized trials of the impact of HAART on incidence of HPV, CIN, and cervical
cancer among HIV-infected women, it is important to consider innovative study designs, including quasi-experimental
trials and operations research in sentinel populations to answer the critical research questions in this area.
Background
Invasive cervical cancer (ICC), although entirely preventable by early detection and treatment, remains one of the
most common malignancies among women worldwide[1]. ICC and its precursor, cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN), are associated with persistent infection
with oncogenic 'high-risk' (HR) types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Products of HPV oncogenes E6 and E7
alter normal genetic and cellular functions and induce
malignant transformation. In women with healthy
immune systems, most HPV infections are cleared. However, for those with persistent HR-HPV infection, gradual
accumulation of altered cellular genetic material may
progress, leading to development of CIN (grades 1, 2, 3)
and eventually ICC. These changes tend to originate at
the squamocolumnar junction of the cervix and may
increasingly involve surrounding cells. Characteristic
changes in cervical cells throughout this progression can
be detected at the pre-clinical stage, allowing for treatment of precursor lesions long before ICC occurs.

The developing world carries the largest burden (over
80%) of ICC, largely as a result of the expense and logistical challenges in establishing and sustaining populationlevel screening and treatment programs. (Figure 1) In
many resource-limited areas, it is the most common
cause of death from malignancies in women[1]. Those
same areas also carry a large burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) (Figure 2). HIV-infected women face
an increased risk for the incidence,[2,3] persistence,[4,5]
and recurrence [6,7] of HPV-induced anogenital and cervical neoplastic disease[8]. Although ICC has been
labeled an AIDS-defining malignancy, there is still a limited understanding of the natural history and epidemiology of HPV-induced neoplastic disease in HIV-infected
women.
The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART*) in the late nineties resulted in dramatic
improvement of clinical outcomes and life expectancies
for people living with HIV/AIDS. It also gave hope that
improved immunological status would result in better
clearance of HPV infection in HIV-infected women,
much like other opportunistic and AIDS-associated
infections, and result in a gradual decrease in the inci-

dence and progression of cervical neoplasia. However,
data from the industrialized world does not point to a
clear reduction in the burden and severity of cervical disease with introduction of HAART, in contrast to other
AIDS-related malignancies, most notably Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [9-12].
The need for better understanding of the interactions
between HIV and HPV in the context of HAART is therefore even more pressing as increasing numbers of HIVinfected women are living longer with a persistent risk of
ICC. Guidelines for prevention and treatment strategies
for cervical cancer among HIV-infected women are
largely based on limited evidence, or in the case of
resource limited settings, are completely lacking. In this
review, we summarize the available epidemiological evidence in this area, nearly all of which originates from
industrialized nations. We discuss the priorities for further research in relation to resource-limited settings,
home to over 90% of women living with HIV/AIDS.

Methods
A systematic review of literature documenting the impact
of HAART on development of HPV-induced cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in HIV-infected women
was conducted using PubMed. Article selection criteria

included any clinic-based observational or populationbased linkage studies documenting both HAART status
and HPV/CIN/ICC rates. PubMed was searched with an
end date of January 2009 using Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms" OR "AlphaPapillomavirus" AND "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active"
limiting to English language literature. A total of 59 articles retrieved through this search were reviewed manually and additional articles were retrieved by cross
referencing. The final analysis included 22 papers that are
tabulated in Table 1. We did not include studies that were
not published as full manuscripts in peer-reviewed literature (e.g. conference abstracts or proceedings) or any
unpublished or gray literature (e.g. project reports) to
ensure inclusion of studies with completed (not interim)
analyses.

Results
The published literature on this subject is striking in lack
of standardization in study designs and methods of
screening as well as the dearth of studies among populations from resource-limited settings. The differences in
clinical versus population-based study designs, use of
prevalent versus incident lesions as endpoints, different
thresholds of diagnostic criteria for CIN, differing stan-

dards of lengths of follow-up evaluation periods, and
nonuniform use of diagnostic assessments by colposcopy
and/or histopathology make it difficult to draw overall
conclusions about the impact of HAART on cervical disease. We discuss these differences by stage of HPV infection/cervical disease and highlight trends and
similarities, as well as differences, in conclusions.
The definition of HAART also varies across studies,
reflecting the evolution in terminology as well as the time
horizon of adoption of newer classes of drugs over the
past decade and a half. Several authors have defined
HAART conventionally, i.e. as consisting of 2 nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) + 1 protease
inhibitor (PI) or 1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor (NNRTI) [13-15]. Some referred to definitions
of HAART prevalent at their institutions, [16-19] while
others have listed multiple definitions in their
work[13,14,20,21]. Since viral suppression and immune
reconstitution appears to be dependent on the class of
drug and duration of treatment, this is an important
source of variation to be considered before drawing broad
conclusions. Furthermore, in several studies, HAART use
was measured by self-report. Some studies compared
patient groups using HAART to groups using unspecified
combinations of antiretroviral drugs [17,20,22,23] while
other studies have used antiretroviral-naïve patients in
comparison groups[14,15]. CD4+ cell count has been
uniformly used as a surrogate of immune status, with
most studies controlling for CD4+ counts in the analysis[15,17,20,23,24]. Lower CD4+ cell counts have been

shown to independently predict both incidence and progression of lesions,[25] and evidence of a dose-dependent
relationship between CD4+ counts and regression of
lesions has also been documented for women on
HAART[13].
There are significant differences between studies in the
utilization of the screening/diagnostic methods for cervical pathology. Most investigators have used cytological
(Pap smear) changes with reporting based on the revised
Bethesda classification, relying on low and high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) as endpoints.
However, cervical cytology has only moderate clinical
sensitivity (55%-65%) for detection of histopathologically
confirmed 'true disease status' [18], and with low inter- or
intraobserver'true correlation, even one grade of misclassification can result in highly distorted outcomes on incidence or regression, especially with varying thresholds of
disease positivity. Very few studies report diagnosis of
CIN by colposcopy and histopathology[20,26]. While
most investigators have measured progression of cervical
lesions independently, a prominent study has combined
persistence and progression into one comparison
group[14]. Researchers also differed in their treatment of
atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance
(ASCUS). Some considered a change of cytology result
from low grade SIL (LSIL) to ASCUS as regression, [13]
others resolved diagnoses of ASCUS with colposcopy and
histology,[27] and still others left ASCUS diagnoses out
of analysis[28].

Our review covers studies that evaluate the effects of
HAART on incidence, progression, and regression of
HPV infection and CIN lesions/ICC. We only include
studies among HIV-infected women which have controlled for cervical treatment to tease out the independent effect of HAART on recurrent lesions. We present
salient features of studies grouped by impact of HAART
on HPV infection, on CIN, and on ICC, in Tables 2, 3, 4, 5
and 6.
In the sections below, we discuss the salient study findings that highlight the heterogeneity in studies and the
current dearth of evidence to definitively demonstrate the
impact of HAART on HPV-associated cervical neoplastic
disease in HIV-infected women.
Studies on impact of HAART and Incidence, Prevalence and
Clearance of HPV infection

Studies that evaluate HPV infection have been limited,
primarily because of limited availability of high quality
HPV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) typing on cervical
samples, while simultaneously evaluating the outcomes of
cytological/colposcopic abnormalities over time among

HIV-infected women seeking HAART. (Table 2) In an
Italian cohort study of 201 HIV-infected women followed
for up to 6 years, antiretroviral therapy regimens were not
associated with increased prevalence/persistence or
regression of HPV infection[14]. Another Italian prospective cohort of 168 HIV-infected women also found
no independent effect of receiving HAART with progression or regression of HPV infection, although higher and
increasing CD4+ T-cell counts were associated with
lower rates of HPV persistence[15]. This same study
reported, however lower incidence of HPV-16 and 18
infections in women receiving HAART compared to
women not on any treatment or women treated only with
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs)[15]. A recent analysis from the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS),
a longitudinal multi-centric cohort of HIV-infected or atrisk HIV-uninfected women in the US, has also found an
increased rate of HPV clearance among HIV-infected
women on HAART who were diagnosed with SIL[23].
(Table 2) HAART did not have an impact on HIVinfected women with normal or ASCUS Pap results.

In summary, the evidence about the impact of HAART
on incidence, progression and clearance of HPV infection
and lesions remains inconsistent and inconclusive. While
these cohort studies are limited by their modest sample
sizes in general, this limitation is especially significant
when establishing impact on individual HPV types or
phylogenetically similar types of HPV. It is expected that
with improved techniques, expanded availability, and
standardization of HPV primers that is being attempted
at an international level, [29], future studies will be able to
address these limitations. This will be even more important in the era of HPV vaccination targeted at high-risk
HIV-infected women[30]. Yet, measurement of HPV
infection is always confounded by the fact that most, if
not all, detected HPV infections are transient, especially
with the constantly fluctuating immunological milieu
among HIV-infected women.
Studies evaluating the impact of HAART on incidence of
cervical lesions

Since the goal of early detection (screening) for cervical
cancer is to target precancerous lesions, studies that measure the impact of HAART on these lesions have significant implications for informing clinical practice as well as
public health guidelines. Results from a pre-protease
inhibitor-era cohort of HIV-infected women from the
United States did not report a protective effect of antiretroviral treatment on SIL, even after controlling for CD4+
status and HPV-DNA status[31]. In a well-characterized
French cohort with a median follow-up period of 28
months, there was no independent effect of receiving
antiretroviral therapy or restored immune status (evi-

HAART vs. other NRTI
or no ARV therapy,
adjusted for CD4+

denced by higher CD4+ T-cell counts) on incident SIL,
which were significantly associated only with being in the
30-39 years age group[22]. In a retrospective analysis of a
cohort from Spain of HIV-infected women with CD4+
cell counts >350 cells/mm3 and with no previous SIL,
there was no significant difference in SIL incidence
between groups receiving versus not receiving
HAART[28].
Similar findings are also reported from another Spanish
cohort that indirectly assessed the impact of HAART on
incidence of SIL as outcome on its effect on CD4+ T-cell
counts or its effect on HIV-1 viral loads[24]. The HERS
cohort results also report no decreased relative risk of
incident SIL in HIV-infected women on HAART[25].
Only one prospective cohort study, following 101 HIVinfected women in Italy, has reported that being on
HAART reduced SIL incidence as compared to not being
on HAART, but was not able to distinguish the independent effect of HAART versus NRTI combination antiretroviral therapy on SIL incidence[20].
Thus, most published literature [22,24,25,28,32] (except
one prospective cohort study [20]) suggests that being on
HAART does not reduce the incidence of cervical precancerous lesions in HIV-infected women. (Table 3)
While studies have been limited by the nature and duration of treatment regimens, there are other hypothesized
explanations for this finding. SIL/CIN represent accumulative oncogenic changes in cells of the squamocolumnar
junction of the cervix caused due to persistent HPV
infections that may not be readily altered by the changing
nature of immunological status induced in the short term
by HAART. Additional evidence in this area will continue

and periodic detecting incident SIL/CIN lesions.
Studies evaluating the impact of HAART on progression of
cervical lesions

Studies evaluating the impact of HAART on progression
of preexisting SIL have reported mixed results. (Table 4)
Studies from the HERS cohort do not report an independent impact of HAART on progression of cervical
lesions. A 2003 paper from HERS cohort reported that
being on HAART was not an independent predictor of
progression of SIL, although poorer immune status
(reflected by CD4+ cell counts <200/mm3) was associated
with significantly higher odds of progression[25]. A more
recent analysis from the same cohort found that women
on HAART with SIL were 30% less likely to progress, but
the difference was not statistically significant[23]. The
two Italian cohorts discussed above also reported no significant difference in rates of progression between those
treated with HAART compared to those not receiving
any treatment[14,15]. However, a 2001 paper from the
other well-characterized multicentric cohort in the

United States, the Woman's Interagency Health Study
(WIHS), reported that HAART significantly decreased
cytological progression even after controlling for CD4+
count and baseline Pap result [17] in a 6-month follow-up
paired analysis (pair of consecutive visits). Cytological
progression was less likely among those with lower HIV
viral loads but was not associated with CD4+ status. Progression was more likely among those with persistent
HPV infection.
Thus, data on impact of HAART on progression from
low to higher grade SIL/CIN remains inconclusive with
conflicting study results. While it is biologically possible
that immune competence restored due to HAART may in
fact prevent the progression, it appears more likely that
progressive lesions are reflective of slow oncogenic
changes due to persistent HPV infection that are possibly
unaffected to the relatively short duration and typically
moderate immunocompetence induced due to HAART.
Comparison across studies is difficult since they differ in
how they adjust for markers of immunological status of
the patient (e.g. CD4+ counts, duration of being HIVinfected) as well as differences in HAART (e.g. duration
of being on HAART, adherence and effectiveness of
HAART).

Studies evaluating the impact of HAART on regression of
cervical lesions

A 2001 report from the WIHS study concluded that
women on ART who were infected with at least 1 highrisk HPV genotype were 40% more likely to experience
regression of SIL than those not receiving ART, after
adjustment for CD4+ cell counts and baseline cytology
status[17]. The follow-up study report from the WIHS
cohort found a regression rate of 12.5 per 100 person
years among HAART recipients (significantly associated
with lower post-HAART CD4+ counts) compared to no
regression of lesions among HIV-infected women before
HAART was introduced [13] Yet, this regression rate was
five times lower than that of HIV negative women. The
French cohort (discussed previously) reported first in
1998 and then in 2002 that women on HAART had 2-3
times the risk of regression than in women not on
HAART[27,33]. A 2004 Italian study also found that the

rate of regression of LSIL was higher among HAART
recipients[14]. However, the findings from the HERS
cohort suggests that regression of SIL is not independently associated with HAART status. In the 2003 report,
SIL decreased by 22% for every log10 increase in HIV viral
load, but this decline was not independently related to
CD4+ counts or HAART status[25]. Also, although in the
recent HERS analysis, while HIV-infected women on
HAART were 30% more likely to exhibit regression on
their cytology results than those not on HAART, this difference did not reach statistical significance[23]. Other
studies have measured impact of surgical excisive treatment on recurrence of HPV-mediated cervical lesions,
and correlated it with HAART status[34,35]. However, it
is not possible to tease out the independent effect of
HAART in such situations and hence we have not discussed these studies in our review.

Thus, the evidence that HAART causes regression of
lesions is also mixed just as the evidence about HAART
on progression of lesions. In addition to the challenges in
controlling for the markers of immune suppression and
the type and nature of HAART, these cohort studies also
differ by varying definitions of clinical endpoints of SIL/
CIN, possible misclassification of results, and the small
sample sizes. Moreover, in the context of regression, the
immunological and virological interplay between HIV,
HPV, and HAART is not particularly well-understood.
The pathways by which HIV may interact with HPV are
still under investigation[36]. The HIV-1 tat gene has been
shown to enhance HPV early gene expression, which is
important in the cell transformation and the process of
SIL development [37,38]. Some studies in HIV-infected
women have also shown a decrease in vaginal Langerhans' cells, which promote local cervical cellular immunity[39,40]. Other mucosal cytokine factors have also
been suggested as influencing local disease manifestation
in HIV/HPV coinfection[41]. There is some limited invitro data to suggest that some HAART drugs, particularly protease inhibitors, may have an anti-tumor effect
independent of increased immunocompetence, [42],
although this has not been proven in clinical studies.
Studies evaluating the impact of HAART on rates of
invasive cervical cancer

In 2000, the International Collaboration on HIV and
Cancer pooled incidence estimates of ICC among all tilldate prospective cohort studies in North America,
Europe, and Australia in the pre-HAART and postHAART eras. The study reports no difference in ICC
incidence rates pre- or post HAART, although the pooled
cases of ICC in the study were too few (36) to make definitive comparisons with the impact of HAART on other
AIDS-associated cancers such d non-Hodgkin lymphoma[9]. The Italianas Kaposi's Seroconversion Study
followed a prospective cohort of 483 women through pre
and post-HAART eras found increased hazards of incidence of ICC in the post-HAART period but was also
limited by the small sample size[10]. AIDS-Cancer Registry Matching studies have been attempted in both Europe
(Italy, Switzerland) [19,21] and in the United
States[11,12,16]. The data has revealed mixed evidence
with some suggesting higher risk in the post-HAART era
[11,16] and others the opposite[12,19]. However, none of
the reported associations in these studies are statistically
significant, given their low absolute numbers of incident
cases of invasive cervical cancer.
It has been suggested, however, that some record linkage methodologies may have underestimated the risks of
some cancers among people withAIDS[43]. Thus, it is
difficult to interpret the significance of these findings that
suggest little change in the numbers of ICC between the

Page 10 of 13

pre- and post-HAART eras. Most authors also note the
difficulty in comparing incidence of ICC across time due
to competing mortality from other causes in HIVinfected women. Additionally, all these studies were conducted in industrialized settings, where the greater access
to frequent cytological screening and early treatment services (rather than HAART) may have actually prevented
ICC among the population of HIV-infected women.
Gaps in evidence and directions for further research

Evident in this review is that most research on the impact
of HAART on cervical cancer has been conducted and
reported from high-income nations while the developing
world unquestionably shoulders a disproportionate burden of the morbidity and mortality associated with cervical cancer[1]. The same nations, especially those in
Africa, also struggle with significant burden due to HIV/
AIDS, disproportionately affecting women[44,45]. The
need for clear, evidence-based screening and treatment
guidelines is especially imperative in these settings as
hundreds of thousands of HIV-infected women are now
accessing HAART and are starting to live longer in a
moderately immunocompetent state. In these settings, a
clearer understanding of the impact of HAART on cervical cancer in HIV-infected women is necessary not only
from an academic and scientific perspective but also from
a resource allocation and program implementation point
of view. Prevention research in cervical cancer is often
within the context of clinical care. Recent efforts through
vertical HIV/AIDS care and treatment programs such as
the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
(PEPFAR) have started focusing on including cervical
cancer screening as an integral component of HIV/AIDS
care and treatment [46-48]. Newer screening methods
such as HPV testing also need to be incorporated into
more sensitive screening protocols for HIV-infected
women[49,50].
Clearly, a trial randomizing women to HAART versus
no HAART to study impact of HAART on incidence,
progression or regression of HPV infection or CIN would
be unethical. Yet, opportunities for answering these questions abound. It is quite feasible to nest outcomes
research studies in HIV/AIDS care and treatment settings that may allow for accumulation of data in developing evidence-based guidelines for cervical cancer
prevention in HIV-infected women. Some possible
approaches to develop this evidence in the context of
public health implementation programs and clinical, epidemiological, or implementation research studies could
include:
1. Nesting observational studies within pre-existing HIVrelated study cohorts

Dovetailing observational studies within pre-existing
cohorts of HIV-infected women followed-up primarily

Bratcher and Sahasrabuddhe Infectious Agents and Cancer 2010, 5:8
http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/5/1/8

for other HIV/AIDS related (non-cervical cancer) outcomes could be valuable. In many such cohort studies,
especially those in middle incomes countries, data of
varying degrees of completeness exists for cervical disease status (determined by cytology, visual inspectionbased screening, or colposcopy/histology) and HAART
status for HIV-infected women. These data can be gainfully exploited for evaluating associations between the
HAART and cervical neoplasia that may have context
specific significance.
2. Conducting quasi-experimental studies in HAART delivery
settings

In settings where HAART programs are being newly
instituted, it may be possible to conduct innovative quasiexperimental studies to answer some important research
questions. In these settings, a large proportion of HIVinfected women have never been screened for cervical
cancer. By providing cervical cancer screening services
through cost-effective and locally appropriate methods, it
is possible to compare CIN disease status (baseline and
follow-up) of cervical screening-naïve women who are
initiating HAART newly and those who are HAART
experienced for longer periods (e.g. >6 months). This
design may provide valuable research opportunities without additional investments or formal randomization procedures for HAART exposure.
3. Nesting studies within HIV-related randomized trials

Multiple studies are underway evaluating the utility of
early versus deferred initiation of HAART among HIVinfected persons[51,52]. Such studies provide ideal experimental venues for answering questions related to the
degree of impact of HAART on HPV/cervical outcomes,
especially considering that by design randomization
would control for differences in HAART status in the two
groups of women being compared.
4. Sentinel surveys

In settings with large numbers of women being treated
with HAART, sentinel surveys can be conducted by documenting cervical disease status at predetermined frequencies and pre-determined sample sizes to assess
changes in CIN outcomes over time. With careful data
collection approaches and quality assurance measures,
such sentinel sites will serve as important resources for
monitoring disease trends over longer periods of time.

Conclusion
There remain significant challenges for elucidating the
impact of ART on CIN disease outcomes. As evidenced
in the review of studies above, the interactions between
HIV, HPV, HAART and the development of cervical neoplasia are not clearly understood. Evidence of the impact
of HAART on incidence, progression and regression of
CIN is largely mixed. Given the small absolute numbers
of invasive cervical cancer cases in HIV-infected women

Page 11 of 13

in industrialized nations, the role of HAART on ICC outcomes is difficult to determine with certainty. The reasons for the wide variation in the medical literature likely
reflect complex immunological or viral-immune interactions yet to be elucidated. The heterogeneity of HPV and
its ubiquity in populations, the difficulty in diagnosing
CIN, and its long natural history may also play a role.
Certainly, the biological interactions between HIV, HPV,
and HAART appear different from other cancers of viral
origins common in HIV-infected persons.
Innovative approaches are needed to elucidate the
impact of HAART in HIV-infected women in resourcelimited settings. Given that the nature of this research is
intertwined with clinical care, conduct of such epidemiology studies dovetailed within existing public health care
and treatment programs for HIV-infected women can
have significant patient benefits as well as provide
insights to the interplay between two preventable diseases: AIDS and cervical cancer.
Footnote to manuscript

* Significant differences exist while describing the drug
treatments for HIV
(antiretroviral therapy). In this article, we use the term
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) broadly in
place of antiretroviral therapy (ART), although but most
published literature only uses the terminology HAART to
describe the more effective combination regimens introduced after 1996 and those currently recommended by
the World Health Organization.
