Abstract
Background: The functional repertoire of the human proteome is an incremental collection of
functions accomplished by protein domains evolved along the Homo sapiens lineage. Therefore,
knowledge on the origin of these functionalities provides a better understanding of the domain and
protein evolution in human. The lack of proper comprehension about such origin has impelled us
to study the evolutionary origin of human proteome in a unique way as detailed in this study.
Results: This study reports a unique approach for understanding the evolution of human
proteome by tracing the origin of its constituting domains hierarchically, along the Homo sapiens
lineage. The uniqueness of this method lies in subtractive searching of functional and conserved
domains in the human proteome resulting in higher efficiency of detecting their origins. From these
analyses the nature of protein evolution and trends in domain evolution can be observed in the
context of the entire human proteome data. The method adopted here also helps delineate the
degree of divergence of functional families occurred during the course of evolution.
Conclusion: This approach to trace the evolutionary origin of functional domains in the human
proteome facilitates better understanding of their functional versatility as well as provides insights
into the functionality of hypothetical proteins present in the human proteome. This work elucidates
the origin of functional and conserved domains in human proteins, their distribution along the
Homo sapiens lineage, occurrence frequency of different domain combinations and proteome-wide
patterns of their distribution, providing insights into the evolutionary solution to the increased
complexity of the human proteome.

Background
One of the biggest challenges in the post-genomic era is to
better understand the evolutionary origins of the human
proteome. This task can be better accomplished by analyzing the building blocks of proteins (protein domains)
rather than entire proteins [1]. Proteins are generally

modular in nature where each module or domain is a general designation for recurrent protein fragments with distinct structure, function and/or evolutionary history with
autonomous folding and function retaining capability
[2,3]. Hence, different proteins can be found with same
domain content but with different architectures, or with

entirely different domain structures in combination with
other domains. It has been suggested that domain combinations are evolutionarily conserved and evolution creates novel functions predominantly by combining
existing domains [4,5], often creating Rosetta Stone proteins in different organisms [6]. Moreover, these domain
combination networks are known to exhibit small-world
and scale-free topologies, where a few domain superfamilies are connected to many different domains, while
most domains are adjacent to only one or two types of
neighbors [7,8]. Diversity of domain combinations and
evolution of domain superfamilies has been attributed to
evolutionary processes such as gene recombination, gene
duplication, gene fusion and fission, loss of fragments at
the terminal region, alternative splicing, etc., creating
complexity in the proteomes of higher eukaryotes including human [4,9-13]. It has been known that the fraction
of multi-domain proteins in eukaryotes is about 65%
compared to only 40% in prokaryotes [14]. However it is
to be noted that evolution in cis-regulatory regions plays
a significant role to create the differences in complexity
among different species (especially in animals) as they
can rapidly produce major changes in gene expression
patterns [15].
A general limitation in studying the origins of protein
domains is the lack of assigned functional domains for
about half of the residues in known proteins in eukaryotic
species. Widely used methods for protein domain assignment are: (i) based on three-dimensional structure that
include independently foldable units or structural
domains and (ii) based on conserved primary sequences
that include independently evolving units or conserved
functional domains. Despite the differences in the assignment, comparative analysis between these two types of
domains revealed overall equivalency in the domain families [16]. A number of resources offer domain information that include structure-based databases, such as SCOP
(Structural Classification of Proteins) [17], CATH (Class
Architecture Topology Homology) [18], FSSP (Families of
Structurally Similar Proteins), [19] etc., or evolutionarybased databases, such as Pfam [20], ProDom [21], SMART
[22], etc.. Structure-based domain assignments have been
extensively used in the literature [9,23,24] for better
understanding of biological functions at the molecular
level. Nevertheless, evolutionary-based databases have
higher coverage of domains than structure-based databases [14,25].
Domains in protein sequences are basic evolutionary
units [17,26] that constantly evolve to attain new functionality either by combining with other domains or by
completely changing into a new domain. Sequence-based
analyses have demonstrated that some domains have
ancient origin with wide spread occurrence in all three

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/91

kingdoms of life, i.e. archaea, bacteria and eukarya [2],
implying their indispensable role in fundamental cellular
processes. Thus, many enzymatic domains of central
metabolism as well as other non-enzymatic domains
appear to owe their heritage to common ancestors in
archaea, bacteria and eukarya [8]. On the other hand,
newer domain families also emerged in more complex
forms of life [27,28] raising one fundamental question:
what is the evolutionary origin of these domains?
Whether they have emerged from preexisting domain
families or novel domain families are generated ab initio.
Several efforts have been made to solve these questions
using comparative analysis of proteomes from different
organisms [23,29]. The abundance of protein sequence
data available for the entire spectrum of life has prompted
us to address these questions for domains in the human
proteome. To accomplish this, we have traced back the
origin of its constituent domains hierarchically, along the
Homo sapiens lineage to see at what stage the functional
and conserved domains have evolved during the course of
evolution. Such understanding of the evolutionary origin
of domains helps to elucidate the functional versatility of
known proteins as well as the functionality of hypothetical proteins in human. It also helps to understand the
divergent evolution of domain families and their degree
of divergence to accomplish complex functions in multicellular organisms. In this study, we have correlated the
functional versatility and evolution of human proteins in
the context of its domain evolution. To our knowledge,
this is the first report on the origins of functional domains
in the entire human proteome carried out by subtractive
searching along the evolutionary lineage of Homo sapiens.

Results
Figure 1 shows the broad taxonomic classification of the
Homo sapiens lineage comprising of seven major hierarchical nodes, representing distinct groups of species in the
hierarchy. Along these nodes, we have searched for the
origin of human protein domains hierarchically, using
subtractive searching method illustrated in Figure 2 (see
Methods). The results of this study are presented in four
sections as follows: First section reports about the origin
of human domains at different nodes along the lineage.
As each domain is assigned based on Pfam domain definition, corresponding Pfam families can also be distributed over different nodes of origin and the second section
describes about the evolutionary distribution of Pfam
families along the lineage. Due to the modular nature of
proteins, different functional domain architectures in different proteins reflect the functional versatility of those
domains as described in section three. Finally, the last section details the patterns of domain origins at different
nodes in the context of protein evolution.

Each side box (other than archaea and bacteria) was derived

domains originated at archaea, bacteria and eukaryotic nodes
are given in parenthesis. For archaea and bacteria, the
number of domains with their remote homologs found both
in archaea and bacteria (archaea+bacteria subnode) is 13,052,
found only in archaea not in bacteria (archaea_only subnode)
is 1,021 and found only in bacteria not in archaea
(bacteria_only subnode) is 15,294 (see Methods).

Origin of functional and conserved domains in the human
proteome
We have used the HHpred method [30] for identification
of functional domains (see Methods) in the human proteome. HHpred employs both sequence and secondary
structure-based information in HMM-HMM comparison
method and hence, is more sensitive than the 'hmmpfam'
search (from HMMER package) [31] in finding remote
homologs. As shown in Table 1, HHpred outperformed

'hmmpfam' with 10% more functional domain coverage
and 20% higher residue coverage in the human proteome
against Pfam-A families. Out of 35,641 protein sequences
in the human proteome, 28,190 have been found to contain at least one hit with Pfam families that include 3,853
unique Pfam-A families and 5,149 unique Pfam-B families. Out of 28,190 sequences, 19,252 have matches with
Pfam-A families only, 1,971 sequences have matches with
Pfam-B only, while, 6,967 sequences have matching
domains both with Pfam-A and Pfam-B families.
Followed by HHpred search, we have obtained 225,360
overlapping domains from 28,190 sequences, each corresponding to at least one Pfam-A or Pfam-B family. Each
domain was individually traced for its origin along the
Homo sapiens lineage, using the subtractive searching
method as shown in Figure 2 (see Methods). Because of
the high sensitivity of HHpred in detecting functional
domains, these domains can be distinct but often, they are
partly or fully overlapping (subsets) with each other
resulting in different Pfam assignments for overlapping
regions. To reduce the overlap, we have merged two or
more overlapping domains (within the same node of origin) with either of the boundaries differing by utmost 10
residues (based on the minimum inter-domain linker
region) [32], into a new domain. Hence these merged

domains have more than one Pfam annotation. Overlapping domains with different nodes of origin (Figure 1)
were not merged due to the possibility that a domain may
be subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different nodes and hence evolve differently. Ultimately, for
28,190 sequences in the human proteome, we have
obtained 88,025 domains, each assigned to at least one
Pfam-A or Pfam-B family.
The distribution of human domains (88,025) originated
from archaea, bacteria and eukaryotic nodes along the
Homo sapiens lineage is given in Figure 1. The node of origin for a domain is the first node in the hierarchy where
its remote homolog is found. Among domains with
prokaryotic origin (~ 33%), bacteria_only subnode
(remote homologs first found only in bacteria but not in
archaea) covers the highest fraction of 17% (15,294
domains). Among domains with eukaryotic origin, the
percentage of new domains originated at different nodes
of origin gradually diminishes from nodes eukaryota
(27%, 23,391 domains) to primates (1%, 500 domains).
Finally, only 1,581 domains (~ 2%) were found to have
originated at the Homo sapiens node. These domain distributions suggest that about 60% of human domains have
their origins at very early stages of evolution (archaea, bacteria and eukaryota nodes) before the metazoan era. A
gradual reduction in the origin of new domains in higher
nodes also suggests that proteins in the higher forms of
life have evolved mostly by reusing existing domains from
the protein repertoire rather than acquiring completely
new domains [9].
Evolutionary distribution of Pfam families assigned to the
human proteome
All the human domains identified in this study have at
least one annotation with either Pfam-A or Pfam-B families. Based on the nodes of origin of human domains, we
have mapped the node-wise distribution of corresponding Pfam families (Figure 3). Most of the Pfam-A families
are found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryota nodes,
implying that most of the known functions in the human
proteome were emerged at very early stages of evolution.
Alternatively, this could be partly due to the fact that
domains appearing in the early stages of evolution have
been well characterized in the literature compared to

those seen at the later stages. On the contrary, a vast
majority of Pfam-B families (conserved families with no
functional annotation) are found at eukaryota, metazoa
and chordata nodes indicating that these newer functionalities have evolved with the lower eukaryotic species.
Interestingly, very few unannotated families (Pfam-B)
have their origin at primates and Homo sapiens nodes.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the assigned Pfam-A
or Pfam-B families cover only 79% of proteins and 67%
of residues in the human proteome and the remainder
could possibly contain new domains specific to higher
eukaryotic species.
Trends in domain evolution
Ideally, each unique Pfam-A family should find remote
homologs only at one node (the node of origin) since we
have used the subtractive searching method (Figure 2) for
detecting the origin of domains. Nevertheless, we have
used a very sensitive HMM-HMM comparison method for
annotating human domains but searched for the node of
origin of those domains using a sequence-profile based
method. Highly diverse Pfam-A families (often members
of a clan) have found their remote homologs at multiple
nodes since the sequence diversity of such families is
beyond recognition by the profile-based method (PSIBLAST) used in this study. Figure 4 illustrates such an
example of Pfam-A family, EGF (epidermal growth factor), an important building block in numerous extracellular matrix proteins including growth factors,
transmembrane receptors, and soluble secreted proteins.
While the node of origin for EGF family is bacteria, its
remote homologs have been found at different nodes
along the lineage in different proteins using the subtractive searching method. Since domain evolution and protein evolution are interdependent, well-distributed

families are expected to show higher diversity resulting in
their identification in multiple nodes. We have tested this
hypothesis as follows. First, we grouped all Pfam-A families assigned to human domains based on the number of
nodes where their remote homologs were found such as:
1-node, 2-node ... up to 8-node. Then we counted the frequency of human domains belonging to each Pfam-A
family and calculated the average number of human
domains in each group of families. Figure 5A demonstrates contrasting behavior between the number of PfamA families in each group and the average number of
human domains in those groups, suggesting that the
number of Pfam-A families gets smaller (decaying curve)
and the size of Pfam-A families gets larger (rising curve),
with increasing number of nodes where their remote
homologs are found. The decaying curve depicts the relationship between the number of functional families and
degree of divergent evolution for a family which is best
approximated by a power-law (which means few functional families undergo high degree of divergent evolution), where Y ~ X-1.7, with R2 = 0.95. The rising curve
represents the number of human domains in such divergent functional families which is best approximated by
exponential decay curve with Y ~ e-0.7X (R2 = 0.97).
We have further calculated the average global sequence
identity among human domains belonging to the same
Pfam-A family, as sequence identity is generally regarded
as an inverse metric of sequence diversity. Figure 5B shows
the group-wise distribution of Pfam-A families sorted by
average percentage sequence identities among their
domains. The lower limits for all groups generally start
below 15%, except in 7-node and 8-node groups with
average sequence identities lower than 10%. Similarly, the
upper limits gradually decrease as the number of nodes
goes up indicating that families with remote homologs at
more nodes show decreasing range of sequence identities
among their members. In other words, if a functional family finds remote homologs in 8 nodes, it has gone through
the highest degree of divergent evolution as measured by
the sequence identity among its members. Hence, the
number of nodes associated with different groups of
Pfam-A families indicate the degree of divergence of that
family during the course of evolution. Correlating both
Figures 5A and 5B, we can conclude that abundant functional families undergo higher degree of divergent evolution but, they are less frequent. Table 2 reports some of the
functionally known Pfam-A families in each group in Figure 5A. One can observe the presence of functional families related with more diverse functions (such as
immunoglobulin domain, zinc-finger domain, protein
kinase, ankyrin repeat, SH3 domain, 7 transmembrane
receptors, epidermal growth factors, etc.) at multiple node
groups.

sapiens. Other functionally significant domain names in protein sequences are given in the legend.

Origin of functional families
Since we have used the subtractive searching method, ideally, all human domains assigned to a Pfam-A family
should detect their remote homologs only at a single
node, which is considered the origin of that family. Nevertheless, about 45% of Pfam-A families (1,741) have
their remote homologs from multiple nodes for reasons
explained in the above paragraph. In these cases, the origin of a functional family is at the lowest node where a
remote homolog was first found along the Homo sapiens
lineage. Nevertheless, no hierarchy was applied between
archaea and bacteria. The distribution of Pfam-A families
assigned to human domains among three kingdoms of
life is illustrated using a Venn diagram in Figure 6, while
Table 3 provides the data for evolutionary origin of PfamA families in different eukaryotic nodes. Out of 3,853
unique Pfam-A families observed in human domains, ~
56% (2,141 families) have prokaryotic origin (Figure 6)

ated with metazoans (370, ~ 10%) and ultimately there
are 44 (~ 1.14%) Pfam-A families associated with only
Homo sapiens node. Pfam-A families with multiple nodes
of origin are mostly associated with archaea and bacteria
while their numbers decreased gradually down the hierarchy. From Figures 4, 6 and Table 3 we can see that a vast
majority of the protein domain repertoire has evolved
between the nodes eukaryota to chordata and the combination of these domains rather than the new domains are
significant (supporting previous analyses) [9] for the functional diversity of proteomes from the mammalian node
and onwards.

of which, 926 families are also shared in eukaryotic species. Among families with eukaryotic origin, the highest
number of unique families is exclusive to the eukaryota
node (1001, ~ 26%), with 667 (~ 17%) families originated only at eukaryota node which could explain the
number of newer functions acquired by early eukaryotes
to make the transition from their simpler prokaryotic
ancestors. The next highest number of families are associ-

Table 4 reports some of the most frequent Pfam-A families
with origin at different evolutionary nodes. In the archaea
node, functions related with fundamental processes of life
such as ribosomal proteins, RNA and DNA polymerases,
translation initiation factors, etc. are prominent. In addition to these, bacterial node showed more enzymatic
functions where sulfotransferase family appeared with
high frequency. In the eukaryotic node, ion-channel
related families, calponin homology domain, eukaryotic
vesicle transport processes (involved in secretory pathway), motor proteins of eukaryotic cells, etc. – all characteristic of eukaryotes start to emerge. Metazoans are
multicellular animals having cells differentiated into tissues and organs with distinct nervous system. Several
functions related to the development of nervous system
such as wnt, T-box, FEZ, ephrin, sema were seen for the
first time at the metazoan node. The chordata node
includes the characteristics of invertebrates as well as vertebrates, though vertebrate-specific functions are more
observable at this node. Connexins, gap junction protein
forming hemichannels, found only in vertebrates, are first
found at chordata node. Other frequently found functions
are related with immune system (interferon,
MHC_II_alpha, etc.) and cell adhesion (protocadherin,
fibronectin, etc.). Appearance of less frequent, but characteristic vertebrate-specific functions (based on Pfam annotation) at chordata node is noteworthy, like, functions
associated with the development of vertebrate nervous
system, regulating microtubules during mitotic metaphase, mature olfactory sensory receptor neurons, etc.
Mammalians are characterized by the presence of mammary glands and several mammalia-specific functions are
evolved at this node. These functions include casein –
major milk protein, mammalian apolipoprotein CIII
sequences, immunoglobulin C2-set domain – present in
mammalian T-cell surface antigen CD2 proteins, etc.
There are very few Pfam-A families which are first seen at
the primates node. Of these, the noteworthy is SPAN-X
which is a cancer-testis antigen and potential target for
cancer immunotherapy. Lastly at the Homo sapiens node,
Pfam-A families related to viral diseases or proteins with
unknown function such as, L1 Late protein, Early protein

E2_N, E6, E7; GP120; Fusion_Gly; peptidase_C3, BAGE –

BAGE gene encodes a human tumor antigen that is recognized by a cytolytic T lymphocyte. The high abundance of
viral disease-related Pfam-A families associated with

gene transfer from viruses to human. Thus, it is interesting
to note how species-specific functions are originated at
different stages of life, reflecting increased functional
complexity from unicellular lower organisms to multicellular higher organisms.
Functional versatility of domains in the human proteome
To identify the number of unique functions conferred by
the constituent domains of a protein, related Pfam-A families were grouped together according to Pfam clans as
they were thought to have the same evolutionary origin
[33]. In each full-length sequence, we counted the
number of unique Pfam-A families/clans which reflects
the general functional complexity of a protein (Figure 7).
In the human proteome, about 26,219 sequences (~ 74%)
have matches with at least one Pfam-A family. Out of
these, about 44% have only one Pfam-A annotation, ~
36% have 2–5 annotations, ~ 5% have 6–10 annotations
while a surprising 15% have more than 10 annotations
(Figure 7). Proteins belonging to the last category include
functionally diverse enzymes, structural families, and a
large number of virus-related pfam-A families.

To better understand the functional versatility of human
domains, we have analyzed the frequency of individual
functional families in proteins with increasing order of
functionalities i.e., proteins containing 1 to 5 different
Pfam-A annotations. Table 5 lists the top 10, most frequent Pfam-A families/clans in human protein sequences
containing 1–5 Pfam-A annotations. Among protein
sequences with only one Pfam-A annotation, the most
commonly found family/clan is immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig) including member families such as V-set, I-set,
C1-set, C2-set, etc. The other two most frequent families
in this category are zinc finger family and protein kinase
superfamily. Zinc finger family becomes the most fre-

quently found in protein sequences with two functional
annotations, followed by kruppel-associated box and Ig
superfamily. Among those with three Pfam-A annotations, G-protein superfamily becomes the most prominent while Ig superfamily again leads the group with four
Pfam-A annotations. Moreover, the Ig clan is one of the
top 4, most frequent families from all groups except the
group with 5 annotations. Also, Atrophoin-1 family
which is associated with DRPLA disease (Dentatorubral
pallidoluysian atrophy or Smith's disease) is a frequent
member of proteins with four or five functional annotations. In the group with five functional annotations, a
strikingly high frequency observed in the first five families/clans (Table 5) is noteworthy. These families include
Frizzled superfamily, family-A G-protein coupled receptor-like superfamily, mammalian taste receptor proteins,
C. elegans chemosensory receptor and C. elegans Srg family
integral membrane proteins. Interestingly, the origin of all
these domains is either at eukaryota or at metazoa nodes.
Frizzled proteins function in multiple signal transduction
pathways and are essential for embryonic development
[34]. It is also noteworthy that domains corresponding to
three families/clans – Ig superfamily, zinc finger proteins
and protein kinase superfamily were among the most frequent families in protein sequences with one, two and
three functional annotations. This suggests that these
domains can carry out essential functions as standalone
domains and also extend their functionality to accom-

plish complex tasks in combination with one or more
other domains.
We have further investigated the occurrence frequency of
functional domain combinations in human proteins, as it
is interesting to note which combinations are prevalent
over the others. A number of Pfam-A domains detected in
our study are not reported in the UniProt annotation for
individual proteins. HHpred method used in this study
has enabled us to assign more functional domains to
human proteome (Table 1) and consequently makes the
analysis described in this section more meaningful. Table
6 reports some commonly occurring domain combinations (not ordered) in the protein sequences with more
than one Pfam-A annotation. The most abundant combination in the proteins with two Pfam-A annotations is the
zinc-finger (zf-C2H2) family with Kruppel-associated box
(KRAB), which are mainly involved in transcriptional regulation [35,36]. The next most frequent combination is Ig
superfamily with Marek's disease glycoprotein A. These
proteins are mainly glycoprotein precursors or immunoglobulin-like receptors containing immunoglobulinlike domains. UniProt annotations for these proteins do
not show Marek's disease glycoprotein-A annotation.
However, immunoglobulin gene superfamily is thought
to play an immunoevasive role in the pathogenesis of
Marek's disease mainly found in birds [37]. Similarly, protein sequences containing IKI3 and WD-40 families correspond to various functions such as substrate selectivity,
catalytic activity, development in peripheral and central
nervous system, etc. [38,39]. The most abundant combi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/91

nation in the proteins with three-domain architecture is
G-protein alpha subunit, G-protein superfamily and
dynein light intermediate chain. These are mainly GTPbinding proteins and Ras-related inhibitors of cell growth.
Another frequently found combination in this category
includes major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) class-I,
class-II beta domain and immunoglobulin superfamily,
which are mainly found in class II histocompatibility antigen, beta chain precursor proteins. Similarly, in several
Kelch-like proteins, frequently found domain combinations are POZ domain superfamily, recombination activating protein and Kelch repeats. These proteins are
involved in many aspects of cell function, such as actinassociated proteins, cell morphology and organization,
gene expression, viral binding partners and have extracellular roles [40]. Histocompatibility antigen proteins,
found in three-domain combinations, are again found in
sequences with four domain combinations with an additional family, C-terminal region of class I histocompatibility antigen. These proteins are mainly class-I
histocompatibility antigen, alpha chain precursor proteins. Another frequently found domain combination in
this category include ATPase proteins with cation transporter/ATPase N-terminus, E1–E2 ATPase, haloacid
dehalogenase superfamily and cation transporter C-terminus, which are known to play a crucial role in ion transportation across biological membranes [41]. A large
fraction (~ 58%) of the protein sequences among the
sequences with five domain architecture (1136 sequences,
shown in Table 5) include the domain combination of (i)
C. elegans chemosensory receptor superfamily, (ii) C. elegans Srg family integral membrane protein, (iii) Frizzled/
OA1/CAR/Secretin receptor-like superfamily, (iv) mammalian taste receptor protein family and (v) Family A G
protein-coupled receptor-like superfamily. Similar combination without Srg family is found in proteins with four
domain combinations, but in much less frequency compared to this five domain combinations. These proteins
are part of the well-known G-protein-coupled receptors
superfamily with highly diverse structure and function,
and are highly abundant in C. elegans [42].
Proteome-wide patterns of nodes of origin in human
proteins
Analyses of origin of domains at the protein level reveal
that domain(s) within a human protein sequence may
originate from a single node or from multiple nodes along
the evolutionary lineage. Protein sequences are grouped
according to the number of nodes of origin of its constituent domains to show the distribution of these groups in
the human proteome (Figure 8). We have found a spectrum of proteins with multiple nodes of origin, while only
one sequence claimed a maximum of eight nodes of origin. Figure 8 follows an exponential decay curve [Y = 2.6
× 104.e-0.65.X with R2 = 0.99], implying that very few pro-

teins can sustain such intense evolutionary pressure of
acquiring new domains at each node.
Figure 9 illustrates the patterns of nodes of origins for proteins in each group in Figure 8. The constituent domains
of a large fraction of human proteins (13,665, ~ 38.5%)
have their origins at a single evolutionary node (number
of protein sequences for each node are shown in Figure
9a) out of which, 217 sequences have originated only
from the Homo sapiens node. Out of these single node
sequences, most protein sequences (36.2%) have their
origin from bacteria (bacteria_only (B) plus archaea+bacteria (R)) followed by the eukaryotic node (28.2%). Careful study of the functions of proteins containing domains
first seen at a specific node reveals how basic functions
have evolved into complex ones from unicellular to multicellular organisms (as shown in Table 4). Proteins with
domains originating from last three nodes- mammalia,
primates and Homo sapiens are fewer indicating that more
domain recombinations have evolved rather than newer
domains in higher organisms. These protein sequences
are generally single domain proteins (one Pfam-A family
covering the full length of the protein) or some have single known domains (a segment of the protein assigned to
Pfam-A or Pfam-B). Examples of new domains emerged at
these higher nodes include ApoA-II, IL2, Resistin, SPANX, BAGE, etc.
Since a vast majority of human domains (~ 77%) originate from species early in the evolutionary lineage such as
bacteria, archaea, eukaryota and metazoa (Figure 3), these
nodes are the most visible in proteins with multi-node
origin, such as eukaryota-metazoa combination (Figure

9b), eukaryota-metazoa-chordata combination (Figure
9c), bacteria-eukaryota-metazoa-chordata combination
(Figure 9d), and so on. In these combinations, generally
the domains with origin at higher nodes are assigned to
Pfam-A families which have already found their
homologs at the lower nodes (Pfam-A families with
homologs at multiple nodes). We have noticed the high
occurrence of Pfam-B families among eukaryota, metazoa
and chordata nodes (Figure 3), which are part of many
proteins in the multi-node combinations. Another important observation in these patterns of nodes in proteins
with multi-node combination (Figure 9) is that lower

nodes, like, bacteria, eukaryota, or metazoa, are almost
always present in 5-, 6- or 7- node combinations. All these
observations support the fact that complex proteins have
evolved by extending the functionality of existing
domains by insertion, deletion or recombination of
domains in the protein repertoire [4,9]. In contrast, when
entirely new functionalities emerge in higher nodes, they
generally appear from completely new proteins, not in
combination with existing domains. Here, we present one
such example on the evolution of human metalloproteinase proteins (Figure 10) where new domains are added at
different stages of evolution to cope up with the increased
complexity in protein functions.

Metalloproteinase proteins generally have metalloendopeptidase activity which catalyses the hydrolysis of
non-terminal peptide linkages in oligopeptides or
polypeptides. Enzymes of this class contain a chelated
metal ion essential to their catalytic activity at their active
sites. O43923_HUMAN is such metalloproteinase protein
with single known domain, peptidase_M10, with its origin at archaea+bacteria node. This peptidase_M10
domain is found in combination with peptidoglycan
binding domain (PG_binding_1) of eukaryotic origin at
its N-terminal end in MMP7_HUMAN (matrilysin precursor/matrix metalloproteinase-7). Peptidoglycan binding
domain is generally involved in the bacterial cell wall degradation with general peptidoglycan binding function
[43]. Keeping this combination of domains intact, hemopexin domain, of metazoan origin, at the C-terminal end
of the protein is found in MMP25_HUMAN, matrix metalloproteinase-25 precursor. Hemopexin is a serum glycoprotein that binds to haem and transports it to the liver for
breakdown and iron recovery, after which the free hemopexin returns to circulation, it prevents haem-mediated
oxidative stress. In MMP25_HUMAN, hemopexin
domain has been shown to facilitate binding and denaturation of the macromolecular substrates [44]. In
MMP9_HUMAN, a matrix metalloproteinase-9 precursor/
gelatinase B [45], fibronectin type II domain was inserted
at the chordate node, along with all other previously men-

tioned domains. This domain is found to be responsible
for the elastase activity of the protein [46] and involved in
binding to gelatin [44], unique to gelatinases. The evolution of human metalloproteinases shows that addition of
new domains at different stages of evolution extends the
functionality of proteins while preserving their core functionality.

Discussion
Whether protein structure and/or function space is continuous, or evolutions leap to create new functions in this
universe – these are long sought questions over the decade
[1,47]. These questions are addressed repeatedly by several researchers in several ways – either by creating phylogenetic trees of life, or by analyzing domain
organizations/combinations in different proteomes from
different organisms [8,10,23,29,48]. Here, we address
these questions by tracing the evolutionary origins of constituent domain in the human proteome.
In this report, assignment of functional domains was carried out by a very sensitive method HHpred [30], which
uses both sequence and secondary structural information
in HMM-HMM comparison method. The useful outcomes
of this method include: (i) better functional space coverage in human proteome compared to regular hmmpfam
method and (ii) better detection of remote homologs
beyond the capacity of simple profile-sequence comparison method, especially for those families where structure
diverges more slowly than sequence [49]. In this study, we
came across several instances where functional annotation of a domain by HHpred is not observed in UniProt
annotation. One such example is the detection of all
members of G-protein coupled receptor superfamily
which are very diverse in nature often lacking significant
sequence similarity. The high abundance of the members
of this superfamily in human proteome (proteins with
five functional annotations, Table 6) is in accordance with
the results obtained using a hidden Markov model specially designed for this superfamily [42].
We have addressed the origin of functional domains in
the entire human proteome by tracing them hierarchically
along the Homo sapiens lineage. For better understanding
of the evolutionary origin of these domains, we used a
subtractive searching method, where the origin of a
human domain is detected by hierarchically searching for
its remote homologs in a database specific to an evolutionary node (see Methods). A common idea is that similar sequences should be searched with 'hard' matrices
(created from less divergent sequences) and remote
sequences should be searched with 'soft' matrices (built
from more divergent sequences) [50]. When a human
domain is searched against the entire dataset (containing
sequences from all nodes) using PSI-BLAST, the PSSMs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/91

become too 'soft' meaning that they are better at finding
remote homologs but not so in finding closer homologs.
Since the domain repertoire in the human proteome is an
incremental collection along its evolutionary lineage, soft
matrices need not always be effective in finding all
homologs. For this reason, the subtractive searching
method adopted in this report creates both soft as well as
hard matrices as appropriate depending on the node to be
searched. For instance, to search bacterial and archael
databases, PSSMs are created against eukaryota node (creates soft matrices) while, to search the mammalia node,
PSSMs are created against primates node (creates hard
matrices) and searched against 'other_mammalia' node
that includes all mammalian sequences except those from
primates. The unique combination of steps explained
above has enabled us to efficiently detect human domains
and to search for their origins along the lineage of Homo
sapiens. It is indeed the differences in the sensitivity of
HHpred and PSI_BLAST methods that help delineate the
degree of divergence of functional domain families during
the course of evolution (Figure 5). How far different functional families can diverge during evolution can be best
represented by their power-law behavior (Figure 5A). Previous works [7,8] have reported about the scale-free network behavior of domain combinations revealing the fact
that very few domain superfamilies can be connected with
many different domains, while most of them remain adjacent to only one or two types of neighbors. Based on the
functional importance of the highly connected domains
within different proteomes, increase in complexity of
multi-cellular from single-celled organisms was explained
analogously [7]. In our study, we explain this gradation of
functional importance or evolution of functional families
in a quantitative way using the number of nodes associated with it. It is very interesting to note that functions
which are related with fundamental processes of life and
those very specific to a particular species are predominantly associated with a single node of origin (Table 4). In
contrast, functions which have diverse applications in
function space, such as cell-cell interactions, eukaryotic
kinases, structure stabilizing factors, transmembrane
receptors, etc., exhibit different degrees of divergence as
necessitated by the complexity of proteomes. Thus, like
domain combinations, domain evolution is also showing
power-law behavior, which means few functional families
undergo high degree of divergent evolution whereas most
of the functional families generally evolve maintaining
sequence identity detectable within the range of profilesequence comparison method.
While domain evolution is best represented by its powerlaw behavior, protein evolution follows the exponential
decay (Figure 8) along different nodes in Homo sapiens lineage. Thus, it is very unlikely for a protein sequence to
undergo changes at every stage of evolution. In this study,

Page 14 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:91

we have seen a spectrum of patterns of protein sequences
originated at different nodes of origin (Figure 9). We have
observed a large number of Pfam-B assignments in proteins originated from multiple nodes, mainly at eukaryota, metazoa or chordata nodes (Figure 4). Despite the
lack of definite functional annotation for these Pfam-B
families, their conservation in multiple species (we used
those families with at least 5 members) have implications
in future research. Functional domains seen at early stages
of evolution have evolved in various ways to cope with the
complexity in multi-cellular organism while new functionalities specific to a node generally appear anew, not in
combination with other already known domains.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this work provides enhanced understanding of the origin of the human domain repertoire along its
evolutionary lineage with implications in domain evolution as well as protein evolution of human proteins. The
knowledge on the nodes of origin, frequency and combination of functional modules in proteins, functional versatility and the degree of divergence of these modules will
provide better understanding of the evolutionary solution
to the increased complexity of human proteome.

primates and Homo sapiens (taxonomy ids are 131567,
2759, 33208, 7711, 40674, 9443 and 9606 respectively),
where each 'node' represents a distinct group of species in
the hierarchy, arranged in the ascending order (lower
node to higher node) along the lineage (Figure 1). The
term 'other_node' was used to denote a group of organisms excluding the next higher node in the lineage. For
example, if node B is next to node A in the lineage,
'other_nodeA' refers to all species from 'nodeA minus
nodeB'. Thus, for node eukaryota, 'other_eukaryota' refers
to all species from eukaryota minus metazoan, and for
node metazoa, 'other_metazoa' refers to all species under
metazoa except those under chordata, and so on and so
forth for other major nodes in the lineage (Figure 1). For
cellular organisms, such 'other_node' consists of two different kingdoms of life, archaea and bacteria (with taxonomy ids, 2157 and 2, respectively). Hence they were
treated as two separate subnodes under 'other_node' category and referred with their names.
Data collection and preparation
We have collected the complete proteome of Homo sapiens
containing 35,641 sequences from the Integr8 database
(release 26) [51]. Protein sequences belonging to different

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/91

nodes in the Homo sapiens lineage were retrieved from the
NCBI taxonomy database [52,53] through E-Utilities program [collected by September 12th, 2005]. Datasets were
cleaned by filtering out those annotated as 'environmental', 'unidentified', 'uncultured' and 'unclassified', and
organized into datasets of nodes and other_nodes as
explained above. For instance, sequences in
other_eukaryota were collected by excluding all metazoan
sequences from the eukaryota node. Sequences at each
node (eukaryota, metazoa, chordata, mammalia, primates and Homo sapiens) and also sequences from archaea
and bacteria were clustered at 90% sequence identity
using CD-HIT program [54] to eliminate highly homologous sequences within each dataset. Number of protein
sequences (after clustering) for archaea, bacteria and
eukaryotic nodes are: for archaea 57,811; bacteria
9,14,421; eukaryota 7,62,692; metazoa 4,14,798; chordata 2,78,611; mammalia 1,80,488; primates 80,339 and
for Homo sapiens 61,939. Sequences in other_node databases (other_eukaryota, other_metazoa, other_chordata,
other_mammalia and other_primates) were not clustered
since they were derived from the clustered sets.
Assignment of functional domains to the human proteome
We used domain definitions from the Pfam database version 19.0 [20] which is a collection of protein families
compiled based on profile hidden Markov models
(HMMs). This release contains 8,183 Pfam-A families. To
identify functional domains in protein sequences, we
used a sensitive HMM-HMM comparison method,
HHpred [30,55], which employs both sequence and secondary structure information to identify remote
homologs. HHpred builds a HMM for each query
sequence following a series of steps that include: (i)
searching the query sequence against the 'nr' (non-redundant) database using PSI-BLAST program [56]; (ii) multiple alignment of sequences obtained from the PSI-BLAST
output; (iii) addition of secondary structure information
to the multiple alignment, as predicted by PSIPRED program [57], and (iv) building a HMM for this multiple
alignment. For PSI-BLAST searches, we have clustered the
NCBI's non-redundant (nr) database to increase the speed
of searching; clustering was done at 90% identity (nr90)
for the first two iterations as PSI-BLAST requires more seed
sequences to build up its position specific scoring matrices, followed by nr70 (clustered at 70% identity) for the
next 2 iterations when searching for remote homologs
with less sequence identity becomes more important. An
inclusion E-value threshold of 1E-05 was used in both the
steps. Each query HMM was searched against the Pfam-A
database of HMMs (functionally known protein families)
using HHSearch program version 1.2.0 (supplied in
HHpred), to identify functional domains at a domain Evalue cut-off of 1E-05, a very stringent cut-off with the
probability of finding remote homolog as 95%. Protein

sequences which are very small (less than 10 residues) and
very large (greater than 6000 residues in length) cannot be
detected by this method and hence they were excluded
from our dataset. This functional domain detection step
took ~ 60 hours for every 1000 query sequences using
Dell's dual Xeon node processor with 3.2 GHz clock speed
and 4 GB of RAM. We have used a compute-node cluster
containing 16 dual node processors to carry out these
large-scale computational tasks.
Detection of conserved domains with unknown function
Segments of protein sequences with Pfam-A assignments
were separated, and the rest of the proteome including full
or partial sequences longer than 50 residues (unannotated
human proteome) were searched against the Pfam-B database, version 19.0 to identify the conserved domains.
Pfam-B families include conserved domains of unknown
function that do not overlap with Pfam-A families and are
automatically generated from the ProDom database [21].
We have selected only those Pfam-B families (30,463 families) with at least five members and built HMMs using
HMMER 2.3.2 program. Conserved domains in the unannotated human proteome were identified by searching
against Pfam-B HMMs at a domain E-value cut-off of 1E05, using a faster 'hmmpfam' program supplied in the
SledgeHMMER package [58].
Pfam clans
Pfam-C database [33] version 19.0 was used to track the
superfamily members (clans) classified in separate PfamA families. Pfam-C contains 205 clans where each clan
contains more than one Pfam-A member families.
Tracing the nodes of origin for human domains by
subtractive searching method
In this method, we create target databases by 'subtracting'
higher node sequences from a lower node database and
then we 'search' human domains against them for detecting remote homologs – so we use the term 'subtractive
searching' method for this type of tracing process.
Assigned domains in the human proteome were traced for
their first appearance (origin) along the Homo sapiens lineage (Figure 1), as shown in the flow diagram in Figure 2.
We created PSSMs (Position Specific Scoring Matrices) for
each human protein domain against a node database
(source database), using 3 iterations of PSI-BLAST with an
inclusion E-value threshold of 1E-05. These PSSMs were
then used as scoring matrices to search against the lower
other_node database (target database), using a single iteration of PSI-BLAST at an expectation value of 1E-05. For
each human domain, remote homologs with an E-value
lower than 1E-05 were retrieved from the target database.
For those human domains with no hits at the target database, the same process is iterated against the next higher
node followed by searching against lower other_node

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/91

database. Hence, domains with remote homologs are subtracted at each node and only domains with no hits at the
lower other_node databases will be forwarded to search
against the next higher other_node until all other_nodes
are searched along the Homo sapiens lineage. When a
remote homolog of the domain is found at one
other_node, then its node of origin will be its immediate
lower node. That means, if a domain is found at
other_mammalia node, then it's node of origin will be
mammalia node. For detecting the origins of human protein domains in archaea or bacteria, we created PSSMs
against the eukaryota node to search against archaeal and
bacterial databases. Between archaea and bacteria, since it
is difficult to say which one has earlier origin, we used
three types of subnodes of origin depending on the occurrence of remote homologs, i.e. 'archaea_only' (remote
homologs first found only in archaea, but not in bacteria),
'bacteria_only' (remote homologs first found only in bacteria but not in archaea) and 'archaea+bacteria' (remote
homologs found both in archaea and bacteria). When a
domain fails to find a homolog at none of the other_node
databases, then it's node of origin will be considered as
Homo sapiens which is the last node. This step of tracing
the evolutionary origin took ~ 20 hours for every 1000
identified domains, using Dell's dual Xeon node processor with 3.2 GHz clock speed and 4 GB of RAM.
Average percentage sequence identity within Pfam-A
family members
We have used a pair-wise global alignment program, Needle (from EMBOSS version 3.0.0) [59] for determining
percentage sequence identity among the human domains
assigned to the same Pfam-A family with a gap opening
penalty of 10.0 and gap extension penalty of 0.5. For a
given Pfam-A family, average percentage sequence identity was calculated by taking the average of all-to-all pairwise percentage identities between its members. Nevertheless for statistical reasons, Pfam-A families containing
less than 10 members were eliminated and redundancy
within families was removed by clustering at 100% identity.
