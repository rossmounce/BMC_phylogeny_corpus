Abstract
Background: Most current DNA diagnostic tests for identifying organisms use specific
oligonucleotide probes that are complementary in sequence to, and hence only hybridise with the
DNA of one target species. By contrast, in traditional taxonomy, specimens are usually identified
by 'dichotomous keys' that use combinations of characters shared by different members of the
target set. Using one specific character for each target is the least efficient strategy for
identification. Using combinations of shared bisectionally-distributed characters is much more
efficient, and this strategy is most efficient when they separate the targets in a progressively binary
way.
Results: We have developed a practical method for finding minimal sets of sub-sequences that
identify individual sequences, and could be targeted by combinations of probes, so that the efficient
strategy of traditional taxonomic identification could be used in DNA diagnosis. The sizes of
minimal sub-sequence sets depended mostly on sequence diversity and sub-sequence length and
interactions between these parameters. We found that 201 distinct cytochrome oxidase subunit1 (CO1) genes from moths (Lepidoptera) were distinguished using only 15 sub-sequences 20
nucleotides long, whereas only 8–10 sub-sequences 6–10 nucleotides long were required to
distinguish the CO1 genes of 92 species from the 9 largest orders of insects.
Conclusion: The presence/absence of sub-sequences in a set of gene sequences can be used like
the questions in a traditional dichotomous taxonomic key; hybridisation probes complementary to
such sub-sequences should provide a very efficient means for identifying individual species, subtypes
or genotypes. Sequence diversity and sub-sequence length are the major factors that determine the
numbers of distinguishing sub-sequences in any set of sequences.

Background
In contemporary biological research, organisms are often
identified by firstly sequencing one or more of their genes
and then comparing the sequences with those of known
species, either by inferring phylogenies or by database
searches [1]. Once a sequence is available it may be used
to design oligonucleotide probes, and these are used for

most routine DNA diagnostic work, because probe
hybridisation tests are far less expensive and less technically complex than sequence analysis. Specific oligonucleotide probes are used that are complementary in sequence
to, and hence hybridise with, selected regions of the DNA,
RNA or cDNA of the target species or genotype. Most such
routine tests aim to identify specimens of a single species,

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:90

or only a very few. Each probe is at least 18 nucleotides
long and often twice as long, and is chosen so that it is
unique and only hybridises with a single target. As a
result, at least one specific probe is required for every target, although usually several different probes are used for
each. In some tests, sets of species- or genotype-specific
probes are deposited as arrays on solid supports, so that it
is possible to check simultaneously if an unknown organism belongs to one or other of many different taxa or genotypes; this strategy is widely used for gene expression
analysis. 'High density arrays' of such probes have been
used on occasion for identifying pathogens [2], but they
are not used routinely because, like sequence analysis,
they are costly and technically complex [3], nonetheless
the potential market for identifying pathogens in this way
is very large (see Discussion).
By contrast, in traditional taxonomy, specimens are rarely
identified using characters specific for an individual target, but, instead, by using combinations of characters
shared by different members of a set of target organisms.
In practice the characters are used to devise a series of presence/absence questions arranged as a 'dichotomous taxonomic key', so that answering these questions sequentially
leads to the identification of a specimen. The main advantage of this strategy is that far fewer characters and questions are required to uniquely identify an individual
target. The strategy is most efficient when each character
bisects the targets into two equal groups, i.e. it is bisectionally distributed, and when different characters bisect
the targets differently, ideally in a progressively binary
way. In theory the minimum number of characters
required to distinguish a finite number of targets by this
method is defined by the binary logarithm X = log2Y,
where X is the number of characters and Y is the number
of targets. For example, ten ideal characters would, in theory, identify each of a set of 1024 targets, and only 20
ideal characters could identify more than a million targets; 1013 and 1,048,555 fewer tests respectively than
using target-specific characters.
Using target-specific characters (i.e. one specific character
for each target) is the least efficient strategy for identification when efficiency is measured as the number of characters required to identify a target. Using combinations of
shared bisectionally-distributed characters can be much
more efficient. The use of such shared characters is most
efficient when they separate the targets in a progressively
binary way.
In this paper we report that gene sequences contain subsequences that are present in quasi-randomly distributed
sets of around half of the sequences, and hence their presence or absence could be used like the questions in a traditional taxonomic key. These sub-sequences could be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/90

detected by sets of probes with complementary sequences.
A suitable set of such 'combinatorial probes' could be
used to uniquely identify different individual DNAs as
these would give different patterns of hybridisation, 'fingerprints', with different individual DNAs Sub-sequences
that are suitable targets for probe combinations are most
commonly 6–30 nts long. Sub-sequences of such lengths
are not unique to the set of target genes, and so the target
genes must first be separated from other 'contaminating'
DNAs. Various physical or chemical techniques could be
used to isolate the target sequences, but perhaps the most
convenient would be by PCR using target region-specific
primer mixtures (i.e. 'redundant' primers).
Attempts have been made to use algorithms based on suffix trees to find sub-sequences that could be used in combinations to distinguish between gene sequences [4], and
others have used selection algorithms based on entropy
maximisation [5,6] or on Lagrangian relaxation [6] to
optimise probe selection. These studies focussed on the
algorithmics of probe selection and demonstrated that
sets of sub-sequences 5–8 nts long could distinguish individual sequences. Probes that are only 5 to 8 nts long are
not widely used because they usually require unusual
hybridisation conditions. In the work reported here we
looked at a range of sub-sequence lengths and used a simple greedy algorithm, where sub-sequences were successively chosen that merely maximised the number of pairs
of gene-sequences that were distinguished; the algorithm
was based on suffix arrays because they use less computer
memory than suffix trees to manipulate as large sets. Our
study focussed on understanding the effect of genesequence diversity on the number and diversity of subsequences of different lengths that might be targeted by
probes, as these factors will affect their use in practical
applications. Here we report a study of three published
sets of cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (CO-1) genes from
representative groups of animal species [7,8]. These data
were chosen because each set is consistent in length and
composition, but differs greatly from the others in phylogenetic range and diversity. We have also studied, in less
detail, several sets of sequences of plant and animal
viruses and the ribosomal genes of bacteria.

Results
Three sets of CO1 sequences were used; the details of
which are available via the Internet [7,8]. The "CO1-animal" data was from 96 species of animals representing the
seven dominant phyla of animals, the "CO1-insect" data
was from 92 species of insects representing eight of the
largest orders of insects and the "CO1-moth" data was
from 201 species from three superfamilies of moths found
near Guelph, Canada. After being aligned using ClustalX
[9] with default parameters, the same region was selected
from all three datasets for analysis; see Methods. The

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:90

selected regions, the "test-sequences", were 604, 603 and
595 nucleotides long respectively in the three sets. Comparable random test-sequence datasets were constructed.
The three sets differed greatly in diversity: the CO1-animal
set was the most diverse with an average nucleotide difference, ignoring positions that had gaps for alignment,
between all pairs of sequences of 35.2% (S.D. 8.3%) with
a range from 12.4% to 57%; the CO1-insect set had a
mean nucleotide difference of 22.2% (S.D. 4.2%) with a
range from 7.4% to 39.5%, and the CO1-moth set had a
mean difference of 12.9% (S.D. 1.9%) with a range from
1.0% to 19.4%. Random sequence datasets were constructed that matched the length and average nucleotide
composition of each test-sequence dataset, and had mean
nucleotide differences of 72.1% to 73.3% (S.D. 1.8% to
1.9%). The CO1-animal sequences yielded a pool of
112,800 sub-sequences 6 nts long that included all replicates. Pools of sub-sequences up to 31 nts long were also
produced and these were, of course, a little smaller. The
CO1-insect sequences produced pools that were almost
the same size, whereas those from the larger CO1-moth
dataset were about twice as large.
Distinguishing sub-sequences
It was assumed that two test sequences could be distinguished if one of them contained a sub-sequence and the
other did not, even if the second contained a subsequence that differed from one in the first at only one
position, as hybridisation methods to distinguish such
sequences are well established for the assay of single
nucleotide polymorphisms [10,11]. To find subsequences that could be used like questions in a taxonomic key we searched among those that were shared and
bisectionally distributed. We excluded specific subsequences, namely sub-sequences that were singletons,
and also all sub-sequences found in all the test sequence
set. Therefore, the search was confined to "distinguishing
sub-sequences" (DSSs), namely those that were present in
at least two test-sequences but not present in all the testsequences.

Distinguishing sub-sequences (DSSs) constituted, at
most, 15% of the sub-sequences in the pools from each
CO1 sequence set (Fig. 1). Almost all nucleotide combinations up to 6 nucleotides (nts) long were present in all
the sequences and, as they were uninformative and therefore eliminated, the percentage of DSSs tended towards
zero for lengths less than 6 nts. The proportion of DSSs
increased in pools of longer sub-sequences, but the
number of singletons also increased with length, and so as
sub-sequence length increased the percentage of DSSs in
the sub-sequence pool peaked and then decreased. The
position of the peak depended on sequence variation; the
peak was found at lengths of 8 or 9 nts in pools from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/90

random sequences, and at 9, 10 and 20 nts in those from
the CO1-animal, CO1-insect and CO1-moth sequences
respectively. Only a few short sub-sequences were
repeated within any one sequence and so these had only
a minor effect on the size of the DSS pool.
Plots of the number of DSSs in each 'occupancy' category,
namely the percentage of test-sequences in which each
DSS occurred, showed large variations between the datasets (Fig. 2A &2B), and this mostly reflected the diversity
of the sequences. Whereas the CO1-moth set yielded DSSs
with 50% occupancy over the complete range of lengths
tested, the CO1-insect sequences yielded none longer
than 17 nts, and the CO1-animal sequences yielded none
longer than 7 nts. In general, as the length increased so the
number of DSSs in each occupancy category declined at
approximately a negatively exponential rate, but there
were large variations between the datasets. For all pools,
most DSSs were present in fewer than 10% of the
sequences and singletons were most common in pools of
the longest DSSs, especially from the diverse CO1-animal
data.
Minimum complete sets (MC-sets) of CO1 sequences
Sets of DSSs that, in combination, would distinguish
between test sequences were selected. A set of DSSs that
could distinguish all the test-sequences in a dataset, in a
manner like a taxonomic key, was considered a "complete
set". A minimum complete set (MC-set) was defined as a
set that contained the fewest DSS found by a random trajectory method (see Methods). Table 1 gives a MC-set for
the CO1-moth sequences, and Table 2 gives the 'DSS signatures', binary barcodes or 'fingerprints' for some representative moths.

MC-sets obtained from twenty searches each of the CO1animal, CO1-insect and CO1-moth data consisted of only
9, 8 and 11 sub-sequences respectively (Fig. 3). In theory,
7 DSSs behaving in a perfectly dichotomous way would
be required to distinguish all the sequences in the CO1animal and CO1-insect data, and the CO1-moth data
should require 8 DSSs. Thus, the MC-sets of the shortest
DSSs were close to the theoretically predicted size. However, as DSS length and sequence diversity increased, so
too did the sizes of the MC-sets. The increase was
smoothly curvilinear with the random data, but more variable with real sequences. The more diverse sequences
usually required larger MC-sets, although the greater size
of the CO1-moth dataset also increased the MC-set size.
Each of the DSS pools was shown to contain several independent equally parsimonious MC-sets by successively
excluding MC-sets from the pools and searching the
depleted pools for new MC-sets. When this was done
using the CO1-animal data and DSSs 8 nts long, the first

using the random DSS choice method and compared, it
was clear that many DSSs from different MC-sets were
interchangeable.
Sub-sequence efficiency
The relative efficiency of each DSS within a complete set
was assessed by calculating the percentage of sequence
pairs it distinguished, from among those remaining to be
distinguished when it was chosen. In this way, it was
found that relative efficiency depended on whether suitable DSSs were available for selection, so whereas the first
DSS selected from the CO1-animal sub-sequences 6 nts
long was able to distinguish 50% of the sequences, the
first DSSs that were 10 nts and 14 nts long only distinguished 41% and 28% of the sequences respectively (Fig.
4A &4B).
Sequence groups
Our search method also allows groups of the sequences to
be defined, so that the resulting MC-sets only contain
DSSs that distinguished between members of different
groups of sequences, but not necessarily between
sequences of the same group. This enabled, for example,
the 96 different CO1-animal sequences to be grouped
into seven phyla (e.g. Chordata, Annelida, Nematoda, etc)
but this only decreased the size of the MC-set for DSSs six
nts long from 9 to 8 DSSs, and for DSS 12 nts long from
26 to 23. However grouping was more valuable for
sequence sets containing many nearly identical variant

sequences. For example a set of sequences from 240 isolates of Potyvirus, a genus of plant viruses, gave MC-sets of
22, 38 and 50 DSSs with sub-sequences 7, 10 and 12 nts
long respectively, but when the sequences were grouped
as the 62 recognized species the MC-sets were less than
half the size; only 10, 14 and 19 DSSs respectively.

Speed
The search method took 54 seconds to select an MC-set of
16 DSS 20 nts long from the 201 CO1-moth sequences
when using one processor on a dual Opteron 242
processor machine running at 1.6 GHz. The same system
took 13 seconds to select an MC-set of 17 DSSs 10 nts long
from the 96 CO1-animal sequences. These tasks took 8
minutes 14 seconds and 85 seconds respectively in a PC
with a Pentium CPU at 2.4 GHz. A version of the program
is available for use for research purposes over the Internet,
contact the corresponding author (MJG) for details.

Discussion
All the studies described above in which the three sets of
CO1 sequences were compared, illustrate the fact that the
number of DSSs in a set of sequences is mostly determined by its diversity and by the length of the subsequences being sought. Short sub-sequences for probe
targeting could readily be found, but longer subsequences that would be more useful for identification in
standard hybridisation reactions were less common and
more likely to be found among closely related, well conserved, gene sequences. The most useful sub-sequences for
identification were, as predicted, those that were present

in about half of the targets (i.e. those with occupancy
scores of about 50%). Most gene sub-sequences less than
18 nts long are not unique to particular genes. Therefore
they can only be used as targets for diagnostic tests when
the target nucleic acids that contain them have been preselected in some way. This could be accomplished most
conveniently by PCR using region-specific primers or
primer mixtures.
One advantage of combining region-specific amplification with identification using combinatorial probes is that
related but previously unrecognised or uncharacterised
species or subtypes may be found. The chosen region,
even from unknown species or subtypes, is likely to be
amplified using the region-specific primers or primer mixture, and it is then also likely that the combinatorial
probes will hybridise with at least some of the target subsequences, but will give DSS 'signatures' that have not
been seen before. This is because each MC-set that we
have found is many-fold redundant, and has the potential
to generate many more different signatures than would be
generated from the known test-sequences. For example,
the MC-sets 18 nucleotides long that distinguished the
201 CO1-moth sequences were of 16 DSSs. Sixteen DSSs
could, if they behaved in a perfectly dichotomous way,
uniquely identify 65,536 different gene sequences or species (i.e. 216). Thus the MC-sets we found were 99.7%
redundant, and the combinations of DSSs not represented
among the target sequences would be available to distinguish previously unknown variants of the selected gene
region.
The aim of the work reported in this paper was to investigate the factors that influenced the numbers of subsequences that, in combination, could distinguish
sequences or groups thereof. We therefore tested our selection algorithm using three published sets of CO1
sequences that were consistent in length and composition, but differed greatly from one another in phylogenetic range and diversity. We have also examined, but in
less detail, a set of ribosomal RNA genes from 17 bacterial
species representing 12 genera and also gene sequences
from several groups of animal and plant viruses, namely
flaviviruses, orthomyxoviruses, potyviruses and tobamoviruses (unpublished results). The results obtained with the
bacterial and viral sequences did not differ in any significant way from those obtained with CO1 sequences, which
suggests that there is no a priori reason to believe that DSSs
for targeting by probe combinations are not present in all
genes.
The design of practical diagnostic tests, based on the principles outlined in this paper, would involve several stages.
First, known sequences of potential targets would be
examined to find regions of convenient length and varia-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/90

bility bracketed by conserved sites for PCR primers. The
region-specific primers would be tested and optimised
using a range of variant sequences. Then all known
sequences of the region would be used to identify MC-sets
of DSSs, whose complements could be used as probes in
hybridisation-based tests to identify individual variants.
However an iterative process will be required to design a
working set of combinatorial probes as it is well known
that a significant proportion of sub-sequences selected as
hybridisation probes fail to behave as expected because of
secondary structures in the target nucleic acid or the probe
[12]. First an initial MC-set would be selected bioinformatically, then tested biochemically, and the probes that
performed correctly used as a 'starter set' for further
rounds of bioinformatic and biochemical selection, until
a working MC-set was obtained. When this DSS set is used
in practice, variant sequences giving unknown DSS signatures are likely to be found. These would then be
sequenced and added to the trainer set, and the MC-set
might have to be redesigned.
The value of target-specific 'high-density microarrays' of
DNA probes was most spectacularly demonstrated when
the pathogen causing SARS was shown to be a coronavirus. It was detected using an array of about 10,000 different oligonucleotides from some of the most conserved
regions of about 1,000 reference viral genomes [2,13,14].
However, the microarrays used for SARS were not standard diagnostic tools, and high-density microarrays are also
not used routinely in infectious disease diagnostics
because of their cost and complexity [3]. Nonetheless
multiplexing offers clear benefits [15] as more information is provided by each test.
At present non-multiplexed tests or tests that use just a few
specific probes are the standard. These tests are used routinely for screening donor blood for viruses, including
human immunodeficiency lentiviruses and hepatitis C
hepaciviruses, and as the primary or confirmatory diagnostic tests for sexually transmitted pathogens and pathogens that cause meningitis [3,16-20]. These nucleic acid
probe-based medical diagnostics have a very large market
value [21].
Probes, which identify by being used in combinations,
could be most usefully used in low-density DNA microarrays. Low-density microarrays typically comprise fewer
than 100 probes and often fewer than 40 probes, and it
seems likely that such microarrays could outperform
high-density microarrays for routine diagnostic applications because of their reliability, simpler data analysis and
much lesser cost [22-24]. Different combinatorial probe
sets could be combined in each low-density array to
achieve greater redundancy and accuracy; they might not
merely replicate one another but could optimally target

different major organism groups or different epidemiologically important strains with each replicate MC-set
[19,25].

Conclusion
This paper reports a method that finds sub-sequences
which, in combinations, distinguish the individual gene
sequences or groups of gene sequences from which they
came, and that could be used as targets for DNA probes.
Sequence diversity and sub-sequence length were found
to be the major factors influencing the number of subsequences available as probe targets.

Methods
DATA
Three previously described datasets of CO1 sequences
[7,8] were used, although certain sequences were not
included either because they could not be retrieved from
GenBank, or they were incomplete. The CO1-animal data
was from 96 species of animals and lacks sequences
AF310721, AJ271612, NC_002767 and AF370851 in the
reported set; the CO1-insect data was from 92 species of
insects and lacks sequences NC_003372, AY165779,
AF146683, AB010925, NC_001566, NC_002084,
NC_000857 and NC_001322, and the CO1-moth data
was from 201 species of Lepidoptera. The sequences were
aligned using Clustal X [9] with the default parameters,
and the region providing the 'test sequences' was that
bounded by the semi-conserved sequences 5'GTNGGNACNGCNNT-3' and 5'-GGNGGNGGNGAYCC3', which are potential gene specific PCR primer sites.
Random sequence datasets were constructed that matched
the length and average nucleotide composition of each
test-sequence dataset.

tinguished. The DSS with the largest distinguishing-score
was chosen. This DSS and the pairs that it distinguished
were then eliminated from the distinguishing array. The
process of DSS selection was then repeated either until a
set of DSSs had been found that, in combination, distinguished all the test-sequences, or until no DSS could be
found that would distinguish the remaining testsequences. The set of DSSs that could distinguish all the
test-sequences, was considered a "complete set". The
ability of a complete set to distinguish the test-sequences
in a dataset was independently confirmed by using a separate program to search the test-sequences for every DSS
in the set, and by checking that the resulting pattern of its
presence/absence, its "DSS signature", was unique.
During most searches, the greatest distinguishing score at
each step of the search was achieved by more than one
DSS, so one was chosen at random from among those
with the greatest score at each step of the search for a complete set. This allowed a search to have a random trajectory through a succession of DSS choices, and often
produced MC-sets of different sizes for the DSSs of the
same length; the smallest were sometimes 3 DSSs smaller
than the largest.
To aid the discovery of probe sets for different applications, options were included in the programs that
permitted: (i) the exclusion of particular DSSs from the
minimum set, (ii) inclusion of particular DSSs in the minimum set, (iii) exclusion of DSSs that, as double-stranded
DNA, would 'melt' outside a chosen temperature range
[26,27], and (iv) the exclusion of DSSs with runs of more
than a defined number of consecutive residues of the
same nucleotide.

Sets of sub-sequences that could distinguish the testsequences were found using research programs written in
Lahey Fortran 95. Test-sequences were degapped, and
then every test-sequence in a dataset was initially converted into a pool of all the possible overlapping subsequences of a chosen length that it contained. Pools of
sub-sequences of different lengths, ranging from 6 to 31
nucleotides (nts), were analysed separately. The uninformative sub-sequences that were discarded were singletons, replicates and sub-sequences found in all the testsequences.

Authors' contributions

Sets of DSSs that, in combination, would distinguish
between test sequences were selected by a "greedy algorithm". First, an array was constructed that recorded the
DSSs in each test-sequence. A "distinguishing array" was
then constructed that recorded for every pair of testsequences, the DSSs that distinguished the pair. A "distinguishing-score" was then calculated for each DSS by
summing the number of pairs of test-sequences that it dis-
