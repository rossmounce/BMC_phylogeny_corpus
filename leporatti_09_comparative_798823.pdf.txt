Abstract
Background: Italy and Tunisia (Africa for the Romans), facing each other on the opposite sides of
the Mediterranean Sea, have been historically linked since the ancient times. Over the centuries
both countries were mutually dominated so the vestiges and traces of a mutual influence are still
present. The aim of the present study is to conduct a comparative analysis of the medicinal species
present in the respective Floras in order to explore potential analogies and differences in popular
phytotherapy that have come out from those reciprocal exchanges having taken place over the
centuries
Methods: The comparative analysis based on the respective floras of both countries takes into
consideration the bulk of medicinal species mutually present in Italy and Tunisia, but it focuses on
the species growing in areas which are similar in climate. The medicinal uses of these species are
considered in accordance with the ethnobotanical literature.
Results: A list of 153 medicinal species belonging to 60 families, present in both floras and used in
traditional medicine, was drawn. A considerable convergence in therapeutic uses of many species
emerged from these data.
Conclusion: This comparative analysis strengthens the firm belief that ethno-botanical findings
represent not only an important shared heritage, developed over the centuries, but also a
considerable mass of data that should be exploited in order to provide new and useful knowledge.

Background
Italy and Tunisia (Africa for the Romans), facing each
other on the opposite sides of Mediterranean Sea [Figure
1], have been historically linked since the ancient times
and they still show the vestiges of a mutual influence. In
fact both countries were themselves mutually dominated.
The Roman Conquest began with the Punic wars (from
264 to 146 BC) whereas Arabian domination in southern
Italy, mainly in Sicily, took place in the 9th century. The

traces of both dominations were so important and long
lasting that they are still present even now, not only as
archaeological evidences but also as names of Italian
towns or localities, e.g. Caltanissetta, Caltagirone, these
toponyms derive from arabian Kalaat = castle; Gibilmanna, Gibellina from gebel = mountain, Marsala from
marsa = port, and the town Mazara del Vallo from Mazraet
el wali that means Field of the Governor. Many other examples can be given. In Tunisia, the name of the city of Ghar

el Melh, till the independence of Tunisia (1956), was Porto
Farina. Two small islands, situated in the north-east of the
bay of Tunis, are named Zembra and Zembretta. The 7 km
road which connects the isle of Jerba to the continent
(Tunisia), built by the Romans, is still in service and
named "The Roman roadway" [1].
The landscapes of these countries alternate fertile flatlands
to mountainous chains.
In Tunisia, the typical Mediterranean climate which prevails in the Northern and Eastern part of the country collides with the desertic one in the South. In Italy, the
climate is generally temperate; although, from North to
South, three distinct climatic belts are distinguishable.
People living in rural areas have been engaged in agriculture. In the Tunisian villages far from the towns, popular
or traditional use of medicinal plants is still familiar to
ordinary people. Whilst in Italy, it survives mainly amidst
shepherds and older farmers.

Methodology
The aim of the present study is to compare the medicinal
species present in both floras as well as their therapeutic
uses. Tunisian floras [2-5] consider as medicinal about
200 species among the 2150 recorded. Italian flora by Pignatti [6] lists 5559 species, among which about 1163 are
considered medicinal [7]. Specific ethnobotanical literature of both countries has been consulted. The considered
plants are mainly those growing in areas of northern and
central Tunisia, as well as in the regions of central and
southern Italy (so including Abruzzo, Marche and
Toscana regions all belonging to Central Italy and where
the same medicinal species are used). We excluded areas
such as Apennines and Alps, or more generally northern
Italy and the arid and desertic regions of central and
southern Tunisia. So a list of about 153 medicinal species
(belonging to 60 families), has been drawn, according to
specific ethnobotanical literature [8-48]

Results
In additional file 1 we reported the results of the present
comparative study. For each species we have included the
following details: scientific and vernacular name, therapeutic properties, used part, preparation and eventual
additional note. The interesting therapeutic uses are highlighted in bold, as well as the mutual ones. Most of the
documented plants are involved in the cure of more than
one disease and this is recorded in different apparatuses.
So the 153 species have a manifold of different uses
exceeding more and more the number of the quoted species. Because of the high number of recipes and customs
of plant uses in the different considered areas, information about their manipulation is necessarily synthetic e.g.
infusion, decoction, and so on, without further specifications about doses or time required for the cure. The relative percentage of use for each single apparatus has been
calculated on the basis of the total amount of uses.

1-Digestive system
One hundred and fifteen species are used to treat troubles
of gastro-intestinal tract. About 23 of them have the same
or comparable therapeutic uses in both countries and 15
species have identical manipulation as far as the drugs are
identical. Only one species is used for really opposite purposes: Globularia alypum. In Italy, it is considered a purgative and in Tunisia it is a remedy for gastric ulcer
[12,17,26,28,29]. It seems amazing since a purgative generally acts as a stimulator of peristalsis whilst a spasmolytic action is beneficial for gastric ulcer. It is interesting to
observe that the species are considered not only as generically digestive, appetizer, aromatizing or carminative
etc..., but are claimed to be effective in the case of significant ailments, e.g jaundice (e.g. Ecballium elaterium (L.) A.
Richard, Cichorium intybus L., Marrubium vulgare L. Rham-

nus alaternus L.) or gastric ulcer (Pimpinella anisum L.
Artemisia campestris L. Conyza canadensis L., Glycyrrhiza glabra L.). Numerous species are employed for gastralgia,
including the spasmolytic ones and those soothing colic
pain (e.g. Anethum graveolens L., Mentha spicata L., Malva
sylvestris L. Polygonum aviculare L., et).
The number of liver protecting species, such as Cichorium
intybus L., Cynara scolymus L., Silybum marianum L., Sonchus
oleraceus L. Raphanus raphanistrum L. Marrubium vulgare L.,
is also relevant. This protection is essentially due to their
cholagogue, choleretic and depurative activities. Most of
the species are used mainly as purgative or antidiarrhoeic
remedies.
2- Cutaneous system
There are 127 species involved in the skin care: this is the
highest number of species among all of the groups.
Twenty-eight of them have similar uses, but only 4 (Artemisia campestris L. [9-11,21], Borago officinalis L. [7,9,1418,22,24-26,28-30,45,47,48] Capsella bursa-pastoris L.
[10,14,18,25,26,48] and Ficus carica L. [7,12,1518,20,24,28,29,31,41,45,47,48]) have identical uses in
both countries. The differences in uses between the two
countries are remarkable. In Italy, the main frequent uses
of these species are cosmetic, lenitive, emollient or cicatrizing of sores and little wounds, or at least, for minor
troubles as furunculosis, chilblains, warts and corns. The
uses are nevertheless interesting: Ecballium elaterium (L.)
A. Richards, Verbascum sinuatum L. and Verbena officinalis
L. were used for psoriasis treatment in Sicily [9]. These
plants, from a different phylogenetic point of view and
exhibiting strongly different chemical contents, are collected in spring and used in mixtures with other species
not quoted in the present list. A decoction, prepared with
hot water and untreated wine, is boiled and left to evaporate at room temperature then filtered and stored in a
refrigerator [8].

In the Sardinian region, the so called "sapa" which is the
boiled must of Vitis vinifera L., is considered effective for
psoriasis [10].
On the contrary, in Tunisia, a considerable set of species
fights serious illnesses e.g. eczema and dermatosis. Noteworthy among these species is the Nerium oleander L. used
as antigangrenous, Citrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad. and
Linum usitatissimum L. used for impetigo, a skin infection
due to the Streptococcus bacteria. Ricinus communis L. leaves
are employed in soothing acne not a very serious but
unpleasent illness affecting mostly young people. Moreover, sap from Solanum nigrum L., generally considered as
toxic plant, is used for erysipelas that is due to Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp., two pyogenes bacteria. In

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/5/1/31

Tunisia Lycium europaeum L., Morus alba L. and also Solanum nigrum L. are used for eczema.
3- Circulatory system
This set of 73 species diverges in the two countries and not
only in the therapeutic uses. Only 9 species are used in
both countries and 3 of them have the same use (Cupressus
sempervirens L. [7,16-18,27-29], Allium sativum L.
[7,9,17,18,29]
and
Olea
europaea
L.
[7,1318,20,22,28,29,39,40,42,48]) while the others clearly differ: e.g. in Italy 3 species (Fumaria capreolata L., Ruta graveolens L. and Vitis vinifera L.) are claimed to improve blood
capillary vessel circulation. The Tunisian use of Allium
cepa L. in case of stroke is noteworthy, whilst Allium sativum L. is considered as a good cardiotonic medication.
Many of these species such as Pistacia lentiscus L., Calendula arvensis L., Capparis spinosa L. or Lycopersicum esculentum L. are employed for the treatment of very serious
diseases such as hypertension or cardiac diseases e.g.
Carum carvi L., Conyza canadensis L., Marrubium vulgare L.,
Teucrium capitatum L. and Nigella damascena L. Species
such as Cytrullus colocynthis (L.) Schrad., Allium sativum L.,
Marrubium vulgare L. are employed to treat haemorrhoids
or varicose ulcers.
4- Skeletal and muscular system
Among the 67 species used for this purpose, only 9 are
used in both countries. Twenty-nine are used in Tunisia
and act exclusively as antirheumatic or in painful joints. A
very small number of species also have a role in soothing
muscular pain (lumbago). The 25 Italian ones are also
used mainly for this purpose, but in Italy some species
have precise indication for gout, arthritic and neuralgic
(sciatic and trigeminal) pains e.g. Conyza canadensis L.,
Capparis spinosa L., Sambucus nigra L., Lavandula stoechas L.,
Ranunculus bulbosus L. A small number of species give
relief to muscular pains like the stiff neck e.g. Melissa officinalis L., Rosmarinus officinalis L. It is important to point
out that not all species have a really anti-inflammatory
role, but act as revulsive, fit for healing locally the painful
part, or worse, act only as vesicatory as Thapsia garganica L.
and Arum italicum Miller. These two species are able to
provoke erythema or even skin damage. Only Sambucus
nigra L. is used in case of dislocated bones (sprains), and
it is effective against the swelling consequent to the dislocation [7,12,16-18,28-30].
5- Oral hollow, eye and ear
Looking at the repertory of 64 plants concerning troubles
of mouth, eye and ear, we noted that in Tunisia people
have recourse to these plants more frequently than in Italy
(38 and 17 species are respectively quoted). Most part of
the uses refer generally to treatment of inflammation of
the mouth and throat mucous membrane etc., or also to
soothe toothache (decay only in one case of pyorrhea)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2009, 5:31

and gingival abscesses as mouth wash and gargling. Only
Ficus carica L. [7,16-18,28,29], Punica granatum L.
[7,17,18,28,45] and Rubus ulmifolius L. [7,17-19,28,45]
are used in both countries for gingivitis treatment. Inflammation of the eye and ear are treated by eye salve and
drops to instill. Two species: Reseda alba L. and Vitis vinfera
L. [7,16,17,27-29] share an identical use. It is very interesting to note that several Tunisian prescriptions are used
against important eye diseases e.g. Sonchus oleraceus L. and
Reseda alba L. in case of ocular leukoma. Whilst Marrubium
vulgare L. and Nigella damascena L. are considered effective
in case of trachoma. Cattle and sheep trachoma is on the
contrary treated by the fruits of Capsicum annuum L. Concerning ear troubles, a considerable number of species are
employed in Tunisia whereas only Olea europaea L. is used
in Italy.
6- Respiratory system
It is not easy to focus clearly on the role of the 72
employed species in the troubles of respiratory tract
because, compared to the other systems, they have a larger
fan of widely overlapping activities. So the emollient and
the lenitive ones can act at the same time as antitussive,
expectorant, mucolytic and hence are useful in bronchitis,
laryngitis or in flu and cold. In Tunisia, the species are
mainly used as antitussive, whilst in Italy they are considered also as generic expectorant, balsamic and lenitive.
Only 16 species are employed in both traditional phytotherapies, but 7 of them have the same purposes. Among
these, five are mutually used as antitussive. Some interesting properties must be noted. In both countries, the popular experience recognizes the effectiveness of Raphanus
sativus L. for whooping cough [17,18,28,29]. It is remarkable that this property is completely unknown in Central
and Southern Italy. On the contrary, in Veneto region and
in the near north-eastern areas, people commonly have
recourse to this plant.

According to the Tunisian tradition, asthma benefits from
the use of several plants e.g. Pistacia lentiscus L., P. terebinthus L. and Ajuga iva (L.) Schreb., whilst in Italy, the properties of these species are not known. Marrubium vulgare L.
in Tunisia and two species of Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus sp. pl.
and Myrtus communis L.) are claimed in Italy as antiseptic
for the lungs. In Italy, the importance ascribed to Equisetum telmateja Ehrh. as restructuring of lung cartilage must
not be undervalued owing to its richness in Silicium (it is
also important in the treatment of bone trouble).
7- Urinary system
Among the 66 species involving the urinary apparatus
only 10 are used in both countries, and 9 are prescribed in
both countries to promote diuresis which is the main
application of the considered entities. The species used for
the treatment of kidney stones differ widely, but only one

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/5/1/31

of them is reported in both countries: Ammi visnaga (L.)
[16-18,26,28,29]Lam. In Tunisia, a small number of them
have antiseptic properties or are employed in children's
enuresis (Carum carvi L. [16-18,28,29])
8- Antipyretic and Head ache
The 35 species of this group, related to both symptoms,
are considered altogether since the headache is often a
consequence of the fever or it is a simultaneous symptom.
The number of species employed in Tunisia is higher than
those used in Italy. In Tunisia, the popular medicine suggests in fact 11 species against headache but none of them
is used in Italy for the same purpose.

Many species have a generic antipyretic employ, others are
used specifically for malarial fever e.g. Globularia alypum L.
(in Tunisia) [16-18,29], Artemisia absinthium L. [7,27],
Buxus sempervirens L. [27,37,45] and Marrubium vulgare L.
[27] (in Italy). In Tunisia, Ammi visnaga (L.) Lam. [1618,28,29] and Cucurbita pepo L. [17,18,29] are considered
in the treatment of thyphoid fever. However it is not really
clear if their activity concerns only the symptom fever or
have any capacity to fight the respective pathogenous
agents: Plasmodium and Rickettsia. In Tunisia, Helianthus
annuus L. and Allium cepa L. are used to treat fever due to
sunstroke [16-18,29]
9- Antihelmintic, antiparasitic, etc...
The 37 species of this group, except the antihelmintic
ones, have chiefly an external use in repelling insects or
skin parasites. Few of them are generically considered as
antiseptic and antibacterial agents without any specification about which kind of bacteria they act against. Among
the species listed, four are equally considered antihelmintic.

Cucurbita pepo L., Globularia alypum L. and Corydothymus
capitatus (L.) Reichenb. Fil. are specific in Tunisia for tinea
[16-18,28,29], whilst in Italy the latter is considered effective specifically against Ancylostoma duodenalis, a Nemathelminthe worm [7]. These data point out the use of
Cucurbita pepo L. and Globularia alypum L., respectively in
the treatment of malaria and thyphoid fevers and they
strenghten the assumption of a real effectiveness against
several kinds of pathogenous agents.
10- Hypoglycemic
This little set of species (fifteen), 9 in Tunisia and 6 in
Italy, is of great importance. Only one of them (Cichorium
intybus L. [7,16-18,27-29]), is reported in both countries
for the ability to lower blood level of glycemia, since diabetes is a very serious disease affecting millions of people
in the world. So it is strange enough that in the two countries the plants used for this purpose are so different. In
any case, their action is likely more preventive than sub-

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2009, 5:31

stantially therapeutic especially when the illness is already
diagnosed. The use of Allium cepa L. as well as Lupinus sp.
pl. well known remedies, is strongly limited by the presence in the seeds of lupanine and lupinine alkaloids
which are very dangerous to renal apparatus that can't be
used without severe side effects.
11- Reconstituent, Vitaminic action
The 27 reconstituent species include mainly those with a
large range of activity like vitaminic (chiefly A, C), tonic,
remineralizing (Fe, Si) appetizer, etc. Four species are used
in both countries: Nasturtium
officinale
R.Br.
[7,18,26,28,29,45], Medicago sativa L. [18,26,28,29], Trigonella foenum-graecum L. [7,16-18,28,29] and Rosa canina
L. [7,16-18,28,29]. Many of these species (Daucus carota
L., Cynara cardunculus L., Allium cepa L., Prunus persica (L.)
Batsch., Capsicum annuum L. and Lycopersicum esculentum
L.) could be considered nowadays the so -called
"nutraceuticals", foods able to protect from or even to
ward off several illnesses related to bad food habits.
12- Genital system
The 50 species involved in the reproductive apparatus act
mainly in female troubles: many of them are emmenagogue or abortive (respectively 11 in Tunisia and 15 in
Italy) or are used in regulating or in soothing painful menstruation. There are species that facilitate delivery, such as
Corydothymus capitatus (L.) Reichenb. Fil. [16-18,28,29]
and Linum usitatissimum L. [16-18,28,29], or that stop
post-partum haemorrhage as Vitis vinifera L. leaves [1618,28,29]. Petroselinum crispum L. is used to stop lactation
in both countries [16-18,27-29,40,41,47], whereas Carum
carvi L. [9-11,21,25,26] and Pimpinella anisum L. [7,1618,26,29,41] are used to increase it. While Capparis spinosa
L. is employed as galactogenous exclusively in Tunisia
[16-18,28,29], Marrubium vulgare L. [37] is used in Italy
for the same employment. Several important diseases are
treated by Tunisian popular remedies: gonorrhea by Ajuga
iva (L.) Scrheb. [16-18,28,29] (aerial parts), Cynodon dactylon L. (roots), Zea mays L. (stigmata) [16-18,28,29]. The
Tunisian use of Daucus carota L. against orchitis is probably ascribed to a generical antiinflammatory effect [1618,28,29] as well as the effect of Glycirrhyza glabra L.
against prostatic adenoma in Italy [12].
13- CNS
Only 10 species are considered for CNS troubles. Many of
them, considered sedative in Italy, are absent, not known
or not used at all in Tunisia and vice-versa. Only Papaver
rhoeas
L.
[7,10,14,16-18,20,21,23-25,2830,32,33,39,45,48] and Verbena officinalis L. [1618,26,28,29,40] have the same use in both countries. The
use of Peganum harmala L. in Parkinsons' disease is noteworthy.

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/5/1/31

From the recorded data it is possible to make some observations:
The more numerically present and more used families are:
Cruciferae (16 species), Compositae (15), Umbelliferae (10),
Labiatae (9), Leguminosae and Gramineae (5), Rosaceae and
Liliaceae (4). Independently of the number of species, it is
noteworthy that in the family of Lamiaceae every species is
present at least in 5 systems (Mentha sp. pl., Lavandula
stoechas) or in 9 systems (Teucrium capitatum) or even in
11 (Marrubium vulgare), while for Compositae family, species are utilized in 6 systems (Artemisia absinthium and A.
campestris) and for Cruciferae no more than 5 systems
(Carum carvi) [Figure 2]. On the contrary, the few species
of Liliaceae play a role in several important diseases as
hypotensive, hypoglycemic, cardiotonic etc. (Allium cepa,
A. sativum, Urginea maritima).
Several species are really considered as "panacea" and it
would be interesting to carry out further phytochemical
investigations to validate these empirical uses e.g. Ricinus
communis L. which acts (according to different used parts)
as purgative, antitussive and in rheumatic pains, acne, and
as corn plaster.
Marrubium vulgare L. [Figure 3] has 21 different uses in
Italy and 18 in Tunisia, covering a large range of troubles
and also important diseases (cardiotonic, antimalarial,
hypoglycemic, hypotensive, anti decays etc...), as well as
Artemisia absinthium, Rosmarinus officinalis (9). While
Peganum harmala L., Ajuga iva Schreb., Nigella damascena
L., Rubus ulmifolius Schott. and Lavandula stoechas L. are
largely used for the treatment of a great range of diseases
(8). Among the 153 species, seventy have similar uses in
both countries.
Toxic species such as Ecballim elaterium (L.) A. Richard,
Bryonia dioica Jacq., Ranunculus sp. pl., Arum italicum
Miller, Nerium oleander L., Thapsia garganica L. etc... are
also used for both internal and external uses.
It is important to underline the value of oil from Olea
europaea L., not only as an irreplaceable and precious
nutriment, but also as a good excipient which is often
employed to vehicle and combine the drugs especially
those used for external use. Its affinity for the skin justifies
the frequent recourse to olive oil. Moreover, it is wellknown since the ancient time for its important role as a
protector in a large range of diseases such as liver and vessel troubles or as an anti-atherosclerosis and as hypotensive. The Tunisian use of olive oil against trachoma is
noteworthy. Olea europaea is already mentioned in the
Old and the New Testament in which it is said "Olea prima
arborum omnium est" (that means "Olive tree, is the first
among all trees") as well as in the Kuran "Olive tree is the

metic, whilst in Tunisia the drug obtained from leaves is
used in respiratory troubles, rheumatic pains and even
against acne.

Conclusion

The Resolution of the World Health Organization issued
in 1990 states that " The use done for a long period of time

The present research shows a considerable convergence in
therapeutic uses of many species belonging to Italian and
Tunisian Floras, while those utilized for different purposes often bear the evidence of noteworthy and interesting properties [Table 1]. On the contrary, there are scarce
different or clashing uses of medicinal plants e.g. Globularia alypum L. proposed for the treatment of gastric ulcer
in Tunisia [16-18,29] while in Italy it is considered as purgative [12,26]; Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. is used as an
antiulcer remedy in Tunisia [16,17] and simply as antiinflammatory in Italy [12,14,22,26,40]. Buxus sempervirens L. is considered as an antineoplastic in Tunisia [11]
and employed as antimalarial in Italy [7,27,37]. Sometimes different therapeutic uses of several species are
related to the different considered parts (this is a consequence of different phytochemical composition) e.g.
Cuminum cyminum L., used in Tunisia as a decoction of
unripe fruits, acts as abortive, while in Italy only the
decoction of ripe fruits is used as bitter tonic and carminative. Ricinus communis L. whose Italian use envisages only
the oil from the seeds as purgative or externally as cos-
