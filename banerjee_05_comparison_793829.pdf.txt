Abstract
Background: M.tb icd-1 and M.tb icd-2, have been identified in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis
genome as probable isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) genes. Earlier we demonstrated that the two
isoforms can elicit B cell response in TB patients and significantly differentiate TB infected
population from healthy, BCG-vaccinated controls. Even though immunoassays suggest that these
proteins are closely related in terms of antigenic determinants, we now show that M.tb icd-1 and
M.tb icd-2 code for functional energy cycle enzymes and document the differences in their
biochemical properties, oligomeric assembly and phylogenetic affiliation.
Results: Functionally, both M.tb ICD-1 and ICD-2 proteins are dimers. Zn+2 can act as a cofactor
for ICD-1 apart from Mg+2, but not for ICD-2. ICD-1 has higher affinity for metal substrate complex
(Km (isocitrate) with Mg++:10 µM ± 5) than ICD-2 (Km (isocitrate) with Mg++:20 µM ± 1). ICD-1
is active across a wider pH range than ICD-2, retaining 33–35% activity in an acidic pH upto 5.5.
Difference in thermal behaviour is also observed with ICD-2 being active across wider temperature
range (20°C to 40°C) than ICD-1 (optimum temperature 40°C). The isozymes are NADP+
dependent with distinct phylogenetic affiliations; unlike M.tb ICD-2 that groups with bacterial ICDs,
M.tb ICD-1 exhibits a closer lineage to eukaryotic NADP+ dependent ICDs.
Conclusion: The data provide experimental evidence to show that the two open reading frames,
Rv3339c (ICD-1) and Rv0066c (ICD-2), annotated as probable ICDs are functional TCA cycle
enzymes with identical enzymatic function but different physio-chemical and kinetic properties. The
differences in biochemical and kinetic properties suggest the possibility of differential expression of
the two ICDs during different stages of growth, despite having identical metabolic function.

Background
The central metabolic pathways in bacteria, especially in
E.coli, have been extensively studied to understand the

physiology of the organisms under altered carbon sources
[1]. One of the key regulatory enzymes in the universal tricarboxylic acid energy cycle is the isocitrate

M. tb genome has two isoforms of isocitrate dehyrogenase, Rv3339c (ICD-1) and Rv0066c (ICD-2), both annotated as probable isocitrate dehydrogenase based on
homology with other enzymes of the ICD family [13]. The
two isoenzymes are share only ~14% identity at amino
acid level. Earlier, we have pointed to a very unusual property of this TCA cycle enzyme demonstrating that the two
isoforms can elicit B cell response in TB patients and significantly discriminate healthy, BCG-vaccinated controls
from different groups of TB-infected population when
compared to PPD and control antigen M.tb HSP 60 [14].
Although the two isoforms have primarily similar antigenic properties, little is known about their enzymatic
properties. We now document differences in their biochemical properties, subunit composition and phylogenetic association. Our study provides experimental
evidence to show that the two ORFs are TCA cycle
enzymes with identical enzymatic function but different
physio-chemical and kinetic properties.

dehydrodenase that allosterically regulates the conversion
of oxidative decarboxylation of D-isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate and CO2 in presence of a cofactor [2]. This rate-limiting step is the first NADPH yielding reaction of the TCA
cycle [2]. Isocitrate dehydrogenase belongs to a family of
enzymes that exhibits diversity with regard to amino acid
composition, cofactor specificity, metal ion requirement
and oligomeric state. NADP-linked ICDs have been purified and studied from a variety of eukaryotes and prokaryotes with detail investigations on their subunit
composition and kinetic properties [3-11]. ICD from different organisms has been phylogenetically affiliated to
three subfamilies [12]. Majority of the bacterial ICDs fall
into subfamily I that includes archaeal and bacterial
NADP dependent ICDs.

Results
Expression, purification and quantification of M.tb ICD-1
and ICD-2
The over-expressed N-terminal His-tagged M.tb ICD-1 and
M.tb ICD-2 were purified on a Nickel affinity column to
95% and 90% homogeneity, respectively (Figure 1, inset).
The molecular sizes of the recombinant proteins M.tb
ICD-1 and M.tb ICD-2 were determined by SDS-PAGE
analyses and were found to be ~ 49 kDa and ~ 86 kDa
respectively. The purification was carried out under native
conditions for both the proteins from soluble fractions
with an yield of 3.25 mg for M.tb ICD-1 and 10.21 mg for
M.tb ICD-2 per 500 ml start culture [14].
The ORFs encoding hypothetical protein M. tb ICD-1
(Rv3339c) and the probable ICD2 (Rv0066c) are
functionally expressed as evident from serological
evidences
The M. tb icd-1 and M. tb icd-2, both are annotated as the
probable isocitrate dehydrogenase based on the sequence
homology with ICD-family of enzymes. Serological evidences reveal the presence of antibody titers against both
the purified proteins ICD-1 and ICD-2 in the infected sera
samples [14]. Figure 1 is a sample representation of ten
patients each for ICD-1 (sample 1–10) and ICD-2 (sample 11–20) with their respective healthy controls (Figure
1; 21–25, control reactions for ICD-1 and 26–30, control
reactions for ICD-2) suggesting that both the ORFs encoding ICDs are expressed at the protein level as evident from
antibodies in TB infected patient sera.
Biochemical characterization reveals differences between
ICD-1 and ICD-2 in terms of pH and heat stability
In order to determine the kinetic parameters, the stabilizing components in the reaction like pH, temperature, salt

Figure 2 shows relative percentage of activity retained by
the enzymes with respect to different pH. While the optimum pH for both isoenzyme is 7.5, M. tb ICD-1could tolerate a wider pH range retaining ~30% activity in acidic
pH 5.5 to ~ 90% activity in alkaline pH 9.5 (Figure 2). In
contrast, M. tb ICD-2 could retain only 10.22% of activity
at a pH of 5.5, which gradually decreased to only 3.4% at
pH 4, and less than 40% at 9.5 (Figure 2). These results
clearly suggest that M. tb ICD-1 is active across a wider
range of pH than M. tb ICD-2.

M. tb ICD-1 was active across a wider range of pH
than M. tb ICD-2. Activity of M. tb ICD-1 and M. tb ICD-2
was tested as a function of pH (4 to 10). The buffers used for
the experiment were: 30 mM Na-acetate buffer (pH 4.0 to
pH 5.5), 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.7 to pH 7), 30 mM
imidazole buffer (pH 6 to pH 7) and 20 mM Tris buffer (pH
7.5 to pH 10).

Optimum temperature and thermostability of M. tb ICD1 and M.tb ICD-2 were studied by varying the temperature
of the reaction from 20°C to 70°C with incubation time
of 30 minutes for each reaction. The optimum temperature for the activity of M. tb ICD-1 is ~40°C (Figure 3)
while M. tb ICD-2 shows almost similar activity across
20°C to 40°C. Thermal stability of the two enzymes,
however, varied. M. tb ICD-1 retained ~40% activity till
60°C, where M. tb ICD-2 was only ~5% active at that temperature (Figure 3). Thermal inactivation remained irreversible after incubation at 65°C for half an hour for M. tb
ICD-1. M. tb ICD-2 could be renatured upon slow cooling
till 55°C where partial activity was restored. Complete
denaturation of the protein was observed at about 60°C
(Figure 3). Similarity in thermal behaviour of the two
enzymes is apparent, however fine differences could be
registered.

ICD-1 and ICD-2 exhibit differential activity as a

assayed at different temperatures (20°C to 70°C).

The decrease in the activity at higher salt concentration
indicates involvement of ionic interactions during catalysis
of M. tb ICD-1 and ICD-2
We determined the effect of NaCl on the stability as well
as activity of the enzymes. The absence of NaCl in the
reaction buffer did not affect the activity of M. tb ICD-1
significantly but M. tb ICD-2 showed higher activity in
presence of upto 200 mM of NaCl as compared when no
NaCl was added in the reaction. Presence of salt in the
reaction buffer probably maintains the integrity of the
enzymes. Higher concentrations of salt (above 200 mM)
proved to be detrimental for the activities of both the
enzymes (Figure 4a and 4b). The purified recombinant
proteins, ICD-1 and ICD-2 degraded less at room temperature when dialysed against atleast 100 mM NaCl. The
decrease in the activity at higher salt concentration indicates involvement of ionic interactions during catalysis.
The reversibility of the inactivation of the enzyme activities after removal of excess salt has not been tested as the
enzymes had a tendency to precipitate upon long exposure to room temperature or even 4°C during dialysis.

that M. tb ICDs are NADP+ – dependent members of the
isocitrate dehydrogenase family and shows no activity
whatsoever in presence of NAD+.

The two enzymes were tested for metal ion requirement
with respect to four divalent metal ions, namely, Mg++,
Zn++ and Mn++ and Ca++. It was apparent that M. tb ICD-1
accepts both Mg++and Zn++ as divalent metal ion cofactor

a complete saturation at 10 mM of metal ion for both

Kinetic parameters and feedback inhibition of M. tb ICDs
The basic enzyme kinetics parameters Km, Vmax and Kcat

ICD-1 and ICD-2 (Table 1). Km (isocitrate) in presence of
either Mg++ or Zn++ for M. tb ICD-1 was calculated to be 10
µM ± 5 and 22 µM ± 7, respectively. For M. tb ICD-2, the
value is 20 µM ± 1 in presence of Mg++ suggesting that M.

tb ICD-1 has higher affinity for Mg-substrate complex
than
Zn-substrate and also more readily binds to metal-substrate complex than M.tb ICD-2. The observation that
these enzymes showed no activity upon pre-incubation
with isocitrate and NADP+ in absence of metal ions suggests that they are unable to utilize free isocitrate as a
substrate. Km (NADP) values in presence of Mg++ for M.tb
ICD-1 and M. tb ICD-2 are 125 µM ± 5 and 19.6 µM ± 6,
respectively. Competitive inhibition was observed with
NADPH versus NADP+for M. tb ICD-2 (Figure 7). The
mean inhibitor constant, Ki, was calculated to be 0.46 ×
10-5 M. Competitive inhibition of M.tb ICD-2 by NADPH
indicates the regulation of this enzyme by feedback
mechanism (Figure 7). Since M. tb ICD-1 showed very
poor affinity for NADP+ (125 µM ± 5), similar feedback
inhibition was not observed.
Oligomeric assemblies of M. tb ICDs
Size exclusion chromatography was performed to check
the oligomeric assembly of the recombinant M.tb ICD-1
and M.tb ICD-2. The chromatogram for M.tb ICD-1
showed two distinct peaks indicating presence of two
oligomeric species in the solution (Figure 8). The first

peak corresponds to a mass of ~200 kDa (tetrameric)
while the major peak showed migration of the molecule
as a mass of ~100 kDa (dimeric). The results show M.tb
ICD-1 to exist in either minor tetrameric or major dimeric
state. In order to evaluate the functional significance of
the two oligomeric states in catalysis of M.tb ICD-1, each
fraction was collected separately and checked for the activity. While the dimeric fraction showed complete activity,
the tetrameric fraction displayed a rather insignificant
activity (Figure 8, inset). A few dimeric species that might
have originated due to distintegration of the tetrameric
form may account for the insignificant activity of the collected tetrameric fraction. The monomeric form was previously checked for the activity and was found to be
inactive (data not shown). Thus, the oligomeric functional form of the M.tb ICD-1 is a dimer.
The gel filtration analysis were performed with high performance column Superose™ 6 10/300 GL for higher resolution
using
an
automated
chromatographic
workstation (BioRad BioLogic Duoflow™) to confirm the
oligomeric state of M. tb ICD-2. The experiments were performed with the concentrated protein (~400 µg) under
both low (100 mM NaCl) and high (1 M NaCl) salt
conditions. The chromatogram showed a peak

hyde was more efficient and it showed bands corresponding to both dimer and trimer forms of M. tb ICD2.
We also performed chemical crosslinking in presence and
absence of coenzyme (NADP) and substrate (Isocitrate). A
band corresponding to a trimer was consistently present
with the dimeric band (figure 10c). Since the gel filtration
data under low salt condition showed a tendency of forming lower oligomeric states, we further explored if under
any salt condition a trimeric species that was observed in
crosslinking could be obtained. Therefore the gel filtration
assay was repeated under an intermediate (500 mM) salt
concentration. Figure 10d shows a peak representing a
mixture of trimeric and dimeric species under this buffer
condition. Therefore, we conclude that M. tb ICD-2 is not
a monomeric protein under any conditions tested in this
study. Eventhough it can exist in higher oligomerc forms,
dimer represented the most stable form that could not be
further dissociated into monomers in our buffer condition. The above result equivocally demonstrate that M. tb
ICD-2 is not a monomer and exists in higher oligomeric
state in contrary to what has been reported in the annotation of H37Rv genome.

corresponding to a tetramer (~320 KDa) under low salt
condition, which was dissociated into a dimer (~180
KDa) at a high salt concentration of 1 M, but not into a
monomer (Figure 9, lower panel). The broadening of the
ICD-2 peak under low salt concentration at higher elution
volume points to the existence of lower oligomeric species. Sharpness of the peak under 1 M salt corresponding
to a dimeric size provides strong evidence that the most
stable oligomeric state is a dimer.
These conclusions were further supported by UV (figure
10a) and chemical crosslinking data (figure 10b). It was
observed that UV crosslinking gave a distinct dimeric
species. However, chemical crosslinking with glutaralde-

M. tb ICD-1 and M. tb ICD-2 have different phylogenetic
affiliations
The ICD-1 and ICD-2 were aligned at the protein
sequence level, with the corresponding sequences from a
range of organism from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
after a BLAST search (data not shown, but available upon
request). Based on the sequence alignment using CLUSTAL, phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Neighbour
Joining rooted trees with Thermotoga maritima isocitrate
dehydrogenase as outgroup were constructed for both
ICD-1 and ICD-2. The confidence was assessed by
bootstrap analysis as described in Materials and Methods.
The results reveal a closer relationship of the functionally
conserved residues of M. tb ICD-1 with eukaryotic NADP+
dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases (Figure 11). The
closest prokaryotic neighbour of M. tb ICD-1 was Bifidobacterium longum. The NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases of the following prokaryotes were found to
cluster with M. tb ICD-1: Spingobium yanoikuyae, Caulobacter crescentes, Agrobacterium tumefacians, Brucella sp.,
Sinnorhizobium meliloti etc (Figure 11). M. tb ICD-1
showed no similarity with any of the mycobacterial ICDs
in the protein database, including the second isoform of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. tb ICD-2. The phylogenetic
tree of M. tb ICD-2 however, is a total contrast of M. tb
ICD-1, where it clusters with other NADP+ dependent
ICDs of gram-ve bacteria (Figure 12).

Discussion
Our results demonstrate for the first time experimentally
that the two M. tb ORFs Rv3339c and Rv0066c code for

functional TCA cycle enzyme that can catalyze the conversion of D-isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate and CO2 in presence of NADP as cofactor and differ in their biochemical
properties. Interestingly, an altogether different
functionality of these two isoforms in immune recognition was evident from our earlier work [14]. We have biochemically characterized the two isoforms of M. tb ICDs
and established the differences between them.
Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an important regulatory
enzyme of TCA cycle that has been intensively studied in
both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (3–11). It lies at the

branchpoint between glyoxylate shunt and citric acid
cycle in prokaryotes where the switchover from TCA cycle
to glyoxylate shunt depends upon the alteration in the
biochemical parameters of isocitrate dehydrogenase.
Isocitrate lyase of glyoxylate shunt pathway has much
lower affinity for the isocitrate and cannot compete with
isocitrate dehydrogenase for the substrate under normal
conditions. It has been reported that phosphorylation of
ICD controls the flux of isocitrate between the Krebs cycle
and the glyoxylate pathway [15,16]. In E.coli, where
glyoxylate bypass and citric acid cycle operate concurrently, the activity of a single, functional isocitrate

dehydrogenase is closely monitored [17,18]. In M. tb,
however, glyoxylate bypass is observed inside macrophages where C2 substrate is the main carbon source [19].
The occurrence of two isoforms of ICD in M. tb genome
with the possibility of each having characteristic biochemical properties is interesting under such circumstances.
M. tb ICD-1 and ICD-2 follow a first order reaction and
exhibit typical saturation kinetics. Km (isocitrate) value

for M. tb ICD-1 clearly indicates a high affinity of this
enzyme for isocitric acid as compared to M. tb ICD-2. Km

has been presented in Table 2 for reference and comparison [3-11]. Several other probable substrates for M. tb
ICD-1 with close structural similarity were tested. Two
such substrates were aspartate and glutamate. Both the
compounds have close similarity with isocitric acid. However, the poor activity of the enzyme with these substrates

a substrate (data not shown).
The fact that M. tb ICD-1 could tolerate a broad range of
both pH and temperature (Figure 2, 3) than M. tb ICD-2
indicates its robustness. The difference in the pH tolerance
helps to postulate the possibility of differential expression
of the two isoforms with ICD-1 being expressed during
stationary phase when the intracellular pH is expected to
vary over a wider range than log phase.
Km (NADP+) of M. tb ICD-1 showed poor affinity for
NADP+ as compared to M. tb ICD-2 and other known
NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases (Table 2).
The poor affinity of M. tb ICD-1 to NADP+ warranted an
investigation on whether dual co-enzyme specificity
occurs in M. tb ICD-1 as reported in some archaeal
bacteria [12]. We, therefore, compared the enzymatic
activity of both the enzymes in presence of NADP+ and

NAD+ (Figure 5a and 5b). It can be clearly seen that M. tb
ICD-1 as well as M. tb ICD-2 accepts NADP+ and not
NAD+ as a proton acceptor.
The homodimeric state of M. tb ICD-1 is the functionally
active species, even though residual activity was noticed in
tetrameric fraction which could be a reflection of the presence of a few dimeric species as a consequence of disintegration of the tetrameric forms. The chromatogram peak
for M. tb ICD-2 corresponding to a tetramer (~320 KDa)
under low salt condition, which was dissociated into a
dimer (~180 KDa) at a high salt concentration of 1 M, but
not into a monomer (Figure 9) provided a strong evidence
that the most stable form of M. tb ICD-2 is a dimer. An
intermediary trimeric form was observed in chemical
crosslinking assays (Figure 10b and 10c), both in presence
and absence of coenzyme NADP and substrate isocitric
acid. The data were consistent with the gel filtration profile under an intermediate (500 mM) salt concentration

(Figure 10d) where it showed a peak representing a
mixture of trimeric and dimeric species. We therefore
could conclude that M. tb ICD-2 is not a monomeric
protein. Our result indicates M. tb ICD-2 exists in different
higher oligomeric states which may follow the following
equilibria: [tetramer] ⇔ [trimer] ⇔ [dimer]. However, the
physiological relevance of the different oligomers could
not be concluded from our experiments.
Earlier attempt to trace the evolution of ICDs to understand the adaptive role of isocitrate dehydrogenase in
intracellular persistence of this pathogen by Steen et al
[12] does not place M. tb ICD-2 phylogenetically. Proximity of the two M. tb ICDs with other isocitrate dehydrogenases was determined. Our results on phylogenetic
analysis of M. tb ICD-1 revealed a closer relationship with
eukaryotic NADP+ dependent ICDs (Figure 11) with more
than 65% identity with that of Glycine max, Sus scrofa, Bos
and Homo sapiens. M. tb ICD-1, indeed, is correctly placed
in subfamily II that includes eukaryotic NADP dependent
ICDs and a single bacterial ICD (Sphingomonas yanoikuyae)
[12]. With NADP+ dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase of
Sphingomonas yanoikuyae, M. tb ICD-1 has more than 65%
similarity at primary structure level. Phylogenetic analysis
of M. tb ICD-2 showed that the classical nomenclature
applies to ICD-2 and it can be placed in subfamily I, the
closest being M. leprae (Figure 12). The closest bacterial
relative of M. tb ICD-1 as inferred by our study is NADP
dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase of Bifidobacterium
longum (Figure 11). Bifidobacterium sp. are gram positive,
anaerobic, natural components of human intestinal
microbiota [20]. This might be argued as a case of horizontal transfer or lateral transfer of gene amongst unrelated organisms across the boundaries of phylogenetic
domains. Horizontal transfer of genes is a common

occurrence in nature and accounts for almost 10–50% of
genes in bacteria [21,22].

Conclusion
Several ORFs have been characterized since deciphering of
M. tb genome [23-25]. Our data represent conclusive
proof that the two ORFs, Rv3339c and Rv0066c, are functional TCA cycle enzyme and represent the first attempt to
characterize these important members of the TCA cycle of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our studies conclusively reveal
that both ICD-1 and ICD-2 are NADP+ dependent
members of ICD family with the former having closer
homology with eukaryotic ICDs and latter with prokaryotes. ICD-1 is a homodimer, while ICD-2 annotated as a
monomer, exists in higher oligomeric forms, the dimer
being the most stable. The two isoforms differ in their
affinity for coenzyme NADP as represented by their
Km(NADP) values (Table 1) and also with respect to pH
tolerance and thermostability.M. tb ICD-2 is a more efficient enzyme as inferred by comparing Vmax(NADP)/
Km(NADP) ratios for the two enzymes but M. tb ICD-1 is
more robust in terms of pH tolerance and thermostability.
The possibilities of differential expression of these two
isoforms during different stages and conditions of growth
cannot be ruled out even though the two isoforms have
identical enzymatic function.

Methods
Cloning and purification of M. tb ICDs
The 1.230 kb (ICD-1) and 2.238 kb (ICD-2) long ORF
was amplified from H37Rv genomic DNA and overexpressed in the pRSET-A/E.coli BL-21 (DE3) expression
system as described earlier [14]. The overexpressed histagged recombinant protein was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate affinity chromatography.

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
ELISAs were performed with purified recombinant proteins, as described earlier [14], to check the B cell immune
response in TB patient sera as evidence to the in vivo
expression of the proteins.
Dehydrogenase kinetics/biochemical assays
Dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the time dependent reduction of
NADP+ to NADPH at 25°C in Unicam UV/Vis
spectrometer at 340 nm, the absorbance maximum of
NADPH. The standard assay solution contained 20 mM
triethanolamine chloride buffer pH 7.5, 2 mM NADP+,
0.03 mM DL-isocitrate, 10 mM MgCl2/10 mM ZnCl2, 100
mM NaCl and 10 -100 pM of the enzyme in a final volume of 400 µL. Environmental parameters for the
enzymes were measured by altering the pH of the buffer
(range 4 – 10), temperature (20 – 65°C), concentration of
substrate (0.01 mM – 0.18 mM), cofactor (0.1 – 2 mM),
metal ion (Mg++, Zn++, Mn++; 1 – 12.5 mM) and salt
(100 mM – 500 mM) requirement (as indicated in the
respective figure legends. The pH dependence of the
enzyme was measured using the following buffers: 30 mM
Na-acetate buffer (pH 4.0 to pH 5.5), 20 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 5.7 to pH 7), 30 mM imidazole buffer (pH 6
to pH 7) and 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5 to pH 10). The
cofactor specificity was checked with both NADP+ and
NAD+. The heat denaturation was studied in 20 mm triethanolamine chloride buffer pH 7.5 in presence of 1%
bovine serum albumin. Enzyme aliquotes were placed in
tubes and incubated for 30 minutes in a water bath set at
the required temperature (20°C – 65°C). After heating,
aliquotes were immediately placed on ice and then
assayed for remaining enzyme activity.

The kinetic analysis was carried out at 25°C and pH 7.5 in
presence of either Mg++ or Zn++. Km was determined by
altering the concentration of either the substrate or the
coenzyme. The substrate concentration gradient varied
from 0.01 mM to 0.75 mM, while NADP+ concentration
was taken from 0.1 mM to 2 mM. The values were plotted
as V vs S for calculating Km and Vmax for this first order
reaction. The results were counter checked by double
inverse Lineweaver-Burk plot. Competitive inhibition was
observed with reduced NADP (NADPH) versus NADP to
estimate inhibitor constant, Ki. Standard Km analysis was
performed followed by repeating the assay with NADPH.
Two concentrations of the inhibitor were tested, 0.002
mM and 0.005 mM. The uninhibited run provided the
value of Km for the reaction and the inhibited run
provided the apparent Km (Kmapp) for the reaction. Ki
for the competitive inhibition was calculated by the formula (Km) (I)/Kmapp – Km.

Size exclusion chromatography
Size exclusion chromatography was performed at room
temperature using FPLC equipped with Superdex-200 HR
10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and
SuperoseTM 6 10/300 GL (BioRad BioLogic Duo-flow™).
Calibration of the columns were performed using protein
molecular-mass standards for gel-filtration (Sigma, USA)
as described elsewhere [26]. The void volume (Vo) was
determined by running Blue Dextran on the column. The
calibration curve was plotted as Ve/Vo versus log of
molecular mass. A 2.4 mg/ml (for ICD-1) and 1.06 mg/ml
(for ICD-2) concentrations of recombinant proteins were
used for all gel filtration experiments. The columns were
equilibrated with three bed volumes of the elution buffer
prior to each run. Protein elution was monitored at A280.
UV and chemical crosslinking
UV crosslinking assays were performed to check the oligomeric assembly of M. tb ICD2. 5 µg of protein per
reaction, in TrisCl buffer pH 8, was taken and exposed to
UV in a UVP CL-1000 Ultraviolet crosslinker for 1 to 10
minutes at the rate of 1600 Joules/minute and fractioned
later on 10% SDS-PAGE along with similar amount of
untreated M. tb ICD2 as control. For chemical
crosslinking, the protein was equilibrated in 20 mM phosphate buffer pH7.8. 10 mM Glutaraldehyde was used for
all the chemical crosslinking reactions. The protein samples were incubated at 37°C, with or without glutaraldehyde. The reaction was stopped at different time points
(10' or 20') using SDS loading dye containing 400 mM
glycine and subsequently fractionated on 7% SDS-PAGE.
1 mM of either NADP or Isocitrate was used wherever
required.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid sequence of M.tb ICD-1 and M.tb ICD-2
were compared against the NCBI protein database [27].
The sequences with the BLAST score upto e-153 or 65%
identity were selected for construction of the phylogenetic
tree. The sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL program. Manual alignment was done by Jalview [28]
wherever required. The sequence alignment is available
on request from the authors. Rooted phylogenetic tree
were constructed using the software MEGA3 [29] using
the amino acid sequence of Thermotoga maritima isocitrate
dehydrogenase as outgroup. The confidence was assessed
by bootstrap analysis (thousand replicates using default
parameters).
