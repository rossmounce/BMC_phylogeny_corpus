Abstract
Background: The antimalarial drug atovaquone specifically targets Plasmodium falciparum
cytochrome b (Pfcytb), a mitochondrial gene with uniparental inheritance. Cases of resistance to
atovaquone associated with mutant Pfcytb have been reported, justifying efforts to better document
the natural polymorphism of this gene. To this end, a large molecular survey was conducted in
several malaria endemic areas where atovaquone was not yet in regular use.
Methods: The polymorphism of the Pfcytb was analysed by direct sequencing of PCR products
corresponding to the full length coding region. Sequence was generated for 671 isolates originating
from three continents: Africa (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Central African Republic and Madagascar), Asia
(Cambodia) and South America (French Guiana).
Results: Overall, 11 polymorphic sites were observed, of which eight were novel mutations. There
was a large disparity in the geographic distribution of the mutants. All isolates from Senegal, Central
African Republic and Madagascar displayed a Camp/3D7 wild type Pfcytb sequence, as did most
samples originating from Cambodia and Ivory Coast. One synonymous (t759a at codon V253V) and
two non-synonymous (t553g and a581g at codons F185V and H194R, respectively) singletons were
detected in Ivory Coast. Likewise, two synonymous (a126t and c793t at codons -T42T and L265L,
respectively) singletons were observed in Cambodia. In contrast, seven mutated sites, affecting
seven codons and defining four mutant haplotypes were observed in French Guiana. The wild type
allele was observed in only 14% of the French Guiana isolates. The synonymous c688t mutation at
position L230L was highly prevalent; the most frequent allele was the c688t single mutant, observed
in 84% of the isolates. The other alleles were singletons (a126t/a165c, a4g/a20t/a1024c and a20t/
t341c/c688t corresponding to T42T/S55S, N2D/N71I/I342L, N71I/L114S/L230L, respectively"

please replace with ' corresponding to T42T/S55S, N2D/N71I/I342L and N71I/L114S/L230L,
respectively). The codon 268 polymorphisms associated with atovaquone resistance were not
observed in the panel the isolates studied. Overall, the wild type PfCYTb protein isoform was highly
predominant in all study areas, including French Guiana, suggesting stringent functional constraints.
Conclusion: These data along with previously identified Pfcytb field polymorphisms indicate a
clustering of molecular signatures, suggesting different ancestral types in South America and other
continents. The absence of mutations associated with most atovaquone-proguanil clinical failures
indicates that the atovaquone-proguanil association is an interesting treatment option in the study
areas.

Background
A high rate of treatment failure for commonly anti-malarial drugs used in Plasmodium falciparum infections has
been reported in numerous endemic areas. The recommended treatment policy is now to use drug combinations [1]. The atovaquone-proguanil (AP) drug
combination, distributed under the trade name of Malarone®, is one of the treatment and prophylaxis options. AP
has a high cure rate, limited mild side effects [2] and
proved efficacious against multi-drug resistant P. falciparum malaria [3,4]. Atovaquone (a hydroxy-naphthoquinone) is a potent inhibitor of the cytochrome bc1
(cytbc1) complex [5-8], a key respiratory enzyme from the
mitochondrial membrane, while proguanil (an isopropylbiguanide) inhibits the plasmodial dihydrofolate reductase [4,9,10]. The association synergizes to collapse the
mitochondrial membrane [8,11].
Plasmodium falciparum in vitro resistance to atovaquone
has been associated with specific point mutations in the
cytochrome b gene (Pfcytb) in the region spanning codons
271–284 [7,12]. A high frequency of recrudescence was
observed in patients receiving atovaquone as a single drug
therapy against P. falciparum [13,14]. A Y268S point
mutation in the Pfcytb gene, distinct from the mutations
observed in the lines selected in vitro for atovaquone
resistance, was detected in the recrudescing parasites [7].
Codon 268 polymorphism was used as marker for a
molecular surveillance of atovaquone-proguanil resistance [15-19]. AP treatment failures were increasingly
reported a few years after its introduction, with recrudescing parasites presenting a markedly increased IC50 for
atovaquone [15,20,21]. In most cases, recrudescence was
associated with a mutant 268 codon, either a Y268S
[3,12,20,22-26], a Y268N [15] or a Y268C mutation [21].
However, the presence of a mutant 268 codon was not
observed in all cases of AP failure [21,27].
Along with the key issue of emergence and spreading of
polymorphisms conferring atovaquone resistance, analysis of Pfcytb field diversity presents an interest in population genetics [28-31]. Indeed, the cytb gene is encoded by
the mitochondrial DNA and as a consequence, is of uni-

parental inheritance and under quite different evolution
constraints compared to nuclear genes [32,33]. In particular, interallelic recombination is not possible and polymorphisms such as base substitutions or insertions may
accumulate over time. In mammals, the cytb locus displays
an approximately 10-fold higher mutation rate than
nuclear genes [34]. A rapid mutation rate (one mutation
in 105 parasites) was reported for Pfcytb [35], but
100–1,000 lower rates were described subsequently [7].
Sequence polymorphism of the near to full gene sequence
has been explored in laboratory [7,36] and in vitro resistant isolates [7,12]. It has also been looked for in cases of
treatment failures from several countries, mostly African
countries [7,12,15,21,22,24-26]. Systematic analysis of
field polymorphism in African settings [37,38] and in isolates from the Thai Myanmar border [39] essentially
focused on the region coding for the atovaquone-binding
site. Full gene sequence analysis of field samples has been
restricted to isolates from few patients in India [36] and
from patients returning to France from West Africa, Central Africa or the Indian Ocean [21,25,40]. This provides
an interesting picture of the overall polymorphism of the
gene, but little clues on possible population signatures
related to this gene. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial
DNA from 100 independent isolates collected worlwide
provided evidence for geographical clustering [29,30].
To further document Pfcytb population polymorphism,
671 isolates from six different areas: Africa (Senegal, Ivory
Coast, Central African Republic, and Madagascar), Asia
(Cambodia) and South America (French Guiana) were AP
had not been in regular use were analysed. This identified
numerous novel, low frequency polymorphisms in Africa
and Cambodia, most of which were country-specific,
together with a high frequency signature that was specific
for the South American isolates. None of the polymorphisms previously associated with atovaquone resistance
in vitro or AP treatment failure was observed in this panel
of isolates.

Methods
Study-sites and sample collection
Isolates were collected during the drug susceptibility surveillance programme conducted by the reference laboratory based in French Guiana, as such they were exempt
from consent. Additional isolates originating from Senegal [41], Madagascar, Cambodia [42], Ivory Coast [43]
and Central African Republic [44] were collected from
patients recruited at home or at health centres during regular control surveys. Informed consent was obtained for
these studies.

Blood samples were collected in each country from
patients with mild malaria in the years 2000–2003, except
in Central African Republic where blood was collected in
the year 2004. After blood smear analysis, patients with
mixed species infections were excluded. Only patients
with positive slides for P. falciparum were included (Senegal : Sn, N = 45 ; Madagascar : Mg, N = 192 ; Ivory Coast
: IC, N = 44 ; Cambodia : Kh, N = 179 ; French Guiana :
FG, N = 160 ; Central African Republic : RCA, N = 51).
Blood was stored frozen before being processed for
genomic DNA isolation and amplification.

Sequencing reactions conditions were as follows: 1 cycle
at 96°C for 60 sec, followed by 25 cycles [96°C for 10 sec,
50°C for 5 sec, 60°C for 4 min]. The product was ethanol
precipitated and washed with 70% Ethanol. The pellets
were resuspended in 10 μL 0.3 mM EDTA and sequenced
using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
The isolates from Ivory Coast were sequenced on both
strands with the internal primers PfCYTB33 (5'atttatgatatttattgtaactgc) and PfCYTB4R (5'agttggttaaacttctttgttctgc), covering codons 122 to 294 (i.e. encompassing the
binding site of atovaquone).
Data analysis
Sequence analysis was done using Phred Phrap consed
package [46]. Sequences with segments ≥ 1000 bp called
with a quality over 20 per base were retained. Only unambiguous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
considered. Sequences of insufficient quality were either
resequenced or rejected. The sequence assembly was done
with the Seqscape software v.2.0. (Applied Biosystems).

Results
DNA extraction and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
amplification
Parasite DNA was extracted from frozen blood aliquots
using the phenol/chloroform method [45]. Amplifications were performed in 50 μL final reaction volume containing DNA template, 1 μM each primer, 200 μM each
dNTP, 1.75 mM MgCl2 and 2.5 U Taq polymerase
(Promega) using a Mastercycler Gradient 5331, Eppendorf. The primers were designed to amplify the full length
Pfcytb gene, using as reference sequence the atovaquonesensitive P. falciparum 3D7 clone (accession No
AY282930), and carried an extension sequence (bold)
that was used as sequencing primer as well: cytb1-sense
(ctcgaggaattcggatcctatgaacttttactctattaatt) and cytb2-antisense (tctagaaagcttggatcctatatgtttgcttgggagct). The PCR
amplification conditions were: 1 cycle denaturation at
94°C for 3 min, followed by 5 cycles [94°C for 30 sec,
56°C for 90 sec, 65°C for 150 sec] and 35 cycles [94°C for
10 sec, 53°C for 90 sec, 65°C for 150 sec]. A final extension was done at 65°C during 15 min. The isolates from
Ivory Coast were amplified using the primers CYTb1 and
CYTb2 [12].
Direct sequencing of PCR products
The PCR products were purified using a P-100 Gel Fine
solution (Bio-Rad) and Multiscreen MAVN45 kit system
(Millipore). The amount of PCR product (1131 bp) was
estimated on a 1.2% agarose gel. Sequencing reactions
were performed on both strands using the extension primers (sequence in bold indicated above) and internal primers using ABI Prism BigDye Terminator chemistry.

Among the 671 isolates, a full length Pfcytb sequence was
successfully established for 576 isolates and partial
sequence was obtained for 95 isolates (Figure 1). Overall,
11 polymorphic sites were observed (Figure 1), of which
eight were novel mutations compared with published
data (Figure 2).
All isolates from Senegal, Central African Republic and
Madagascar had the same sequence, which was identical
to the Camp/3D7 reference sequence. One synonymous
point mutation and two coding mutations were observed
in the set of isolates from Ivory Coast (Figure 1). None of
these had been published previously and each was
observed in a single isolate.
In Cambodia, two synonymous mutations (T42T and
L265L) were observed (Figure 1). Each was detected in
one isolate, the remaining 177 isolates harboured the
Camp/3D7 reference Pfcytb gene sequence.
The French Guiana samples presented the largest polymorphism, with seven mutated sites affecting seven
codons. Five alleles were observed (Figure 1). Unlike the
other settings where alleles had a single mutated position,
three out of the five alleles from French Guiana were multiple mutants with two (allele FG2) or three (alleles FG3
and FG4) mutated codons. The Camp/3D7 reference
allele was present in 22 out of 160 isolates (14%). Allele
FG1, which carried a silent L230L mutation, was highly
predominant, accounting for 135 of 160 (84%) isolates
(Figures 1 and 3). The same mutation was associated with

additional SNPs in allele FG4, which therefore probably
derive from FG1. Allele FG4 which carried additional
mutations N7I and L114S, was observed only once (frequency 0.6%). The N7I polymorphism was detected in
allele FG3 as well, but in this case it was associated with
N2D and I342L (Figure 1).

Discussion
In the panel of isolates studied here, 11 polymorphic sites
were observed, resulting in 11 codons displaying a single
point mutation. Ten distinct alleles could be identified, as
shown in Figure 1. Apart from the a126t and c688t silent
mutations at codon T42T and L230L, respectively, and
a581g non synonymous mutation at codon H194R, all
mutations observed here were novel (Figures 1 and 2).
Five synonymous and six non-synonymous mutations
were detected. The observed ratio of synonymous to non
synonymous mutations is in line with four synonymous
and five non synonymous mutations detected in 270 full
gene sequences of isolates from West Africa and the
Indian Ocean [25] and four synonymous and six non synonymous mutations in 14 isolates from India [36], but
lower than the three to one ratio observed in Gabon [37]
and the nine to three ratio reported for 135 isolates from
West and Central Africa [40]. The compilation of all Pfcytb
field polymorphisms identified so far (Figure 2) high-

lights 50 polymorphic sites, affecting 45 codons, with 30
mutant amino acid residues.
There was a clear geographical heterogeneity in the level
and type of polymorphism (Figure 3). The Camp/3D7
type was the single allelic form detected in three African
settings studied here (Madagascar, Senegal and Central
African Republic). Similar observations were made in
Ethiopia [37]. In Ivory Coast, the same allele was observed
in 93% of the patients, a frequency similar to the 90%
prevalence observed in Gabon [37], or in travellers returning to France from West and Central Africa [40]. As
observed in other African endemic settings [37], the
mutant alleles were single mutants and each mutant had
a low frequency, being observed in one or two isolates. A
similar low frequency of single mutant alleles has been
observed in the panel of isolates from patients returning
from travel to West and Central Africa and the Indian
Ocean [25,40].
In Cambodia, the Camp/3D7 wild type allele was also
highly predominant, consistent with recent sequence data
of the atovaquone binding site in patients from the Thai/
Myanmar border [39]. The two mutations observed were
both synonymous and detected at low frequency.

Compilation of the polymorphic sites of the Pfcytb gene in field isolates (in blue) and in lines selected for atovaquone-resistance
Figure 2
in vitro (in yellow)
Compilation of the polymorphic sites of the Pfcytb gene in field isolates (in blue) and in lines selected for
atovaquone-resistance in vitro (in yellow). The figure does not include silent mutations, which were not described [36]
or whose nucleotide numbering does not match with the reported reference sequences [37, 40]. Numbering indicated refers
to data reported from 1-Korzinczky et al [7]; 2-Schwöbel et al. [12]; 3-Sharma et al. [36]; 4-Musset et al. [25]; 5-Fivelman et al.
[15]; 6-Berry et al. [40]; 7-Happi et al. [38]; 8-Kuhn et al. [24]; 9-Färnert et al. [23]; 10-David et al. [22]; 11-Schwartz et al. [26];
12-Musset et al. [21]; 13-Joy et al. [30]; 14-Conway et al. [29]; 15-Legrand et al. [20]. # Single Nucleotide Polymorphism found
in this study; * Musset personal communication; ** codon 282 is GTA : nucleotide 846 is an A and not a C as quoted by Berry
et al [40], we assume that the T to C mutation affects nucleotide 845

French Guiana showed a quite different profile, and was
the most polymorphic of the six countries explored. Seven
of 11 mutant sites were observed in the set of isolates from
French Guiana. Furthermore, this area was the only one
where multiple mutant alleles were detected. Importantly,
the Camp/3D7 wild type allele, which was dominant in
the other settings was observed with a 14% frequency
only, while the dominant allele (84% frequency) was a
single, silent L230L mutant. This was in accordance with
data from other localities from South America [29,30].
Triple mutants, most probably originating from the L230L
parent for FG4 isolate, were observed along with a double
mutant possibly derived from the Camp/3D7 type. Thus,

the French Guiana parasite population had a Pfcytb pattern dissimilar from the African and Cambodian settings.
This was consistent with data from others [29,30]. A specific, high frequency geographical signature seems to prevail in India as well, where 13 or 14 isolates carried a N2N
F3Y Y4Y haplotype [36]. However, polymorphism in
French Guiana was larger than in India, where three allelic
forms have been reported. Thus, of all geographical areas
studied so far, French Guiana presents the largest Pfcytb
gene polymorphism. This is interpreted as a consequence
of its population structure, with hypoendemic, isolated
foci that are propitious to genetic drift [47].

Figure 3 distribution of the Pfcytb gene polymorphism studied here
Geographic
Geographic distribution of the Pfcytb gene polymorphism studied here. Country's code: FG: French Guiana, Sn: Senegal, IC: Ivory Coast, RCA: Central Africa, Mg: Madagascar, Kh: Cambodia. Allelic frequency in each site is depicted in colour
coded pie charts: brown, blue and orange referring to Ivory Coast, Cambodia and French Guiana, respectively. The wild type
allele (WT) is indicated in white.

Pfcytb nucleotide polymorphism was larger than the
deduced protein sequence. All three alleles from Cambodia coded for the same, wild type protein sequence. In
French Guiana the wild type deduced protein sequence
accounted for 158 of 160 alleles. Thus in all geographic
regions, the wild type protein sequence was the highly
dominant if not the only predicted isoform. Altogether,
these data point to an elevated mutation rate of the locus,
with albeit a large dominance of the wild type protein
sequence, probably indicating its optimal fitness. At the
nucleotide level, interesting geographic clustering of
molecular signatures were observed (Figure 4), suggesting
different ancestral types in French Guiana (and in South
America) as well as in India [36]. Specificities of the parasite population in India is also suggested by polymorphism of the Pfcrt locus [48]. The data reported here
further support the evidence that the present parasite population from South America differs from the parasites
from Africa, regarding surface antigens [49], loci such as
Pfcg2 [31], Pfcrt [50-52], Pfdhfr and Pfdhps [51] and
numerous genome-wide scattered SNPs [53]. The large
Pfcytb polymorphism together with the observation that

the var gene repertoire in Brazilian isolates is small and
highly redundant unlike in Africa and Southeast Asia [54],
raises the question of the structuring of the South American P. falciparum population.
None of the field polymorphism observed here or in other
settings concerned the residues that are mutated in lines
selected in vitro for atovaquone resistance [5,7,12]. Furthermore, no mutant Y268S, Y268C and Y268N Pfcytb,
selected
under
atovaquone
or
AP
pressure
[3,7,12,15,21,22,24-26] was detected in any of the settings explored here. The 268N mutant, which has been
observed with a 4.5% frequency in Nigeria in the absence
of AP pressure [38] was not detected. This mutation has
been reported so far essentially in Nigeria [15,38] and, as
discussed by Happi et al [38] may have arisen under pressure by related drugs. The Y268S polymorphism was not
detected in the isolates from French Guiana studied here,
which were collected before implementation of AP as

Phylogenetic relationship among 20 Pfcytb alleles from various geographical origin
Phylogenetic relationship among 20 Pfcytb alleles from various geographical origin. The tree was estimated using
the Phylip DNAdist program and the neighbour-joining method (100 replications), and drawn using Drawtree software. Among
the various Pfcytb haplotypes previously published, only those corresponding to a natural polymorphism of the gene (i.e. not
selected under atovaquone pressure) were considered for the phylogenetic analysis. The 3D7 sequence
>gi|31789515|gb|AY282930 was used as reference. The haplotypes were as follows: Nga1: G757A [40]; Nga2: T802A, Nga3:
C796A [38]; Sen1: G160C, Sen2: G209A, Mali1: T918A, Mali2: T1086A, Ben1: A126T, Com: C234T, Burk1: C1059T, RCA1:

ond line AP-treatment failure [20], further substantiating
the interpretation of its selection during AP treatment.

Conclusion
Overall, the available data indicate an elevated mutation
frequency of the Pfcytb locus, with multiple polymorphic
sites, and in some cases more than one polymorphism per
site, consistent with the elevated mutation frequency of
mitochondrial genes [34,35]. The geographical clustering
observed here adds further support to the evidence that
the parasite population from South America differs from
the parasites from Africa. Importantly, the absence of a
mutated codon 268 in all settings investigated here indicates that AP remains an interesting treatment option for
these areas. In view of the high mutation rate and of the
rapid selection of mutants under AP pressure, careful surveillance of emerging Pfcytb mutants and resistance to
atovaquone used as prophylaxis in travellers or as treatment is warranted.
