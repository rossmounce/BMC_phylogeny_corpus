A critical assessment of cross-species detection of
gene duplicates using comparative genomic
hybridization
Research article

Heather E Machado and Suzy CP Renn*

Abstract
Background: Comparison of genomic DNA among closely related strains or species is a powerful approach for
identifying variation in evolutionary processes. One potent source of genomic variation is gene duplication, which is
prevalent among individuals and species. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has been successfully
utilized to detect this variation among lineages. Here, beyond the demonstration that gene duplicates among species
can be quantified with aCGH, we consider the effect of sequence divergence on the ability to detect gene duplicates.
Results: Using the X chromosome genomic content difference between male D. melanogaster and female D. yakuba
and D. simulans, we describe a decrease in the ability to accurately measure genomic content (copy number) for
orthologs that are only 90% identical. We demonstrate that genome characteristics (e.g. chromatin environment and
non-orthologous sequence similarity) can also affect the ability to accurately measure genomic content. We describe a
normalization strategy and statistical criteria to be used for the identification of gene duplicates among any species
group for which an array platform is available from a closely related species.
Conclusions: Array CGH can be used to effectively identify gene duplication and genome content; however, certain
biases are present due to sequence divergence and other genome characteristics resulting from the divergence
between lineages. Highly conserved gene duplicates will be more readily recovered by aCGH. Duplicates that have
been retained for a selective advantage due to directional selection acting on many loci in one or both gene copies are
likely to be under-represented. The results of this study should inform the interpretation of both previously published
and future work that employs this powerful technique.
Background
It is well established that gene duplication and the subsequent evolution of duplicates is an important source of
functional novelty [for review see [1]]. For example, gene
duplications are known to be involved in adaptive evolution in response to diet [2-4], chemical challenge [5,6],
and reproductive incompatibility [7,8]. Such adaptations
can allow diversification into new niches, as has been
suggested for cold adaptation [plants: [9], Antarctic ice
fish: [10]] novel metabolic processes [C-4 photosynthesis:
[11]]. Appreciation for the pervasive nature of gene duplication has been reinforced by genomic studies that identify dramatic variation in gene copy number between
individuals and between species [[12], human: [13],

[17], Arabidopsis: [18]].
One genomic technique for identifying gene duplications among lineages is array-based comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH). This technique can identify duplicates that may be collapsed during shotgun sequence
assembly [19]. Furthermore, unlike next-generation DNA
sequencing technologies, this technique does not rely on
a full genome assembly as a reference [[20], e.g. [21]]. In
addition to the assessment of copy number variation
within a species [e.g. [22]] and between closely related
lineages [Drosophila: [23], D. discoideum: [24], experimental evolution in yeast: [25]], array CGH has been
applied to the identification of chromosomal aberrations
underlying cancer [for review see [26]] and genotyping of
individuals within and between populations according to
single nucleotide polymorphisms [e.g. Arabidopsis: [27],

tify genomic content with increased sequence divergence,
suggesting that array CGH will be biased toward the
identification of recent duplicates or otherwise conserved
duplicates. We further discuss other potential confounding factors that may affect duplicate detection.

Results
High aCGH success for within-species duplicate detection

In the D. melanogaster male versus female analysis, 3146
of the 18849 analyzed features represented genes located
on the X chromosome. Consistent with their X chromosome location, over 93% of these features were correctly
identified as having greater genomic content in the
female as measured by an increased log2 hybridization
ratio that was statistically greater than zero (P < 0.1 FDR
corrected)(Figure 1). Among the "false negatives" (X
chromosome orthologs for which an excess genomic content was not identified by hybridization ratio), over half
(138 of 206) are highly similar (E < 10-14) to one or more
autosomal sequence. Furthermore, there was a small but
significantly positive correlation (R = 0.181, P = 0.034)
between the hybridization ratio and copy number ratio
for false negatives.

In order to assess the potential for aCGH to detect duplication events in a heterologous species relative to the

Hyb Ratio (log2)

stickleback fish: [28]]. For each of these applications,
when gDNA isolated from one sample is competitively
hybridized against gDNA isolated from another sample,
genomic regions that have been deleted (or are highly
diverged) in the genome of the first sample will fail to
hybridize to the array features resulting in a log ratio less
than zero. Conversely, genomic regions that have been
duplicated in the first sample will hybridize at a ratio of
2:1 (or greater), resulting in a log ratio greater than zero.
When using aCGH to compare genome content between
two different species, only one of these gDNA samples is
isolated from the species for which the microarray was
constructed, and the other gDNA sample is isolated from
a heterologous species of interest. Through repetition
with multiple heterologous species, a phylogenetic study
can be performed that can address genome content in a
broad range of related organisms. The aCGH technique
has been used to reveal genomic regions likely involved in
an organism's ability to inhabit a specific environment
[Chlamydia trachomatis tissue specificity: [29],
Sinorhizobium meliloti root symbiont: [30], Clostridium
difficile host specificity: [31]], pathogenicity [[32], Yersinia pesits: [33], Mycobacterium tuberculosis: [34], Vibrio
cholerae: [35]], genomic duplications and deletions associated with population divergence and speciation
[Anopheles gambiae: [36,37]], and genomic regions that
differentiate humans from other primate species [38,39].
Array-based genomic comparisons can also identify
orthologs with high sequence divergence because an
increased number of basepair differences between the
platform species and the heterologous species will cause a
detectable reduction in hybridization strength for the
heterologous species [40,41]. We have shown a consistent
linear relationship between hybridization ratio and
sequence divergence. While 40% of the variation in
hybridization ratio was accounted for by variation in
sequence identity of the heterologous sample to the platform sample, other characteristics of the DNA sequence,
such as GC content and alignment characteristics, also
contributed to variation in hybridization ratio [40]. The
extent to which reduced hybridization due to sequence
divergence compromises the ability to accurately identify
gene duplications has not been rigorously addressed, nor
have the resultant biases in types of gene duplicates been
identified. Here we quantify this effect by using genomic
content as a model for gene duplication by specifically
focusing on X-linked genes, such that these genes are
"duplicated" in female individuals (XX) relative to male
individuals (XY). Using three Drosophilid species for
which complete genome assemblies are available [42], we
survey thousands of orthologs over a range of sequence
divergence. We quantify the ability to accurately detect
increased genomic content of D. simulans and D. yakuba
relative to D. melanogaster males using CGH on a D. melanogaster microarray. We find a decreased ability to iden-

array platform species, we tested for significantly female
biased hybridization ratios using females from two additional species relative to D. melanogaster males. X chromosome orthologs were successfully found to have
greater genomic content in both heterologous species,
although at a reduced rate compared to the D. melanogaster within-species analysis. For D. simulans, approximately 37% of the analyzed X chromosome features were
correctly identified, and for the more distantly related D.
yakuba this true positive rate dropped to 26% (P < 0.1
FDR) (Table 1).

mosome orthologs in D. simulans and percent identity of
the D. simulans sequence to that of D. melanogaster. We
found a strong relationship between percent identity and
correct identification. While the true positive rate was
roughly 50% for X chromosome D. simulans orthologs
with a sequence divergence of 2-4%, this rate fell off
quickly and bottomed out at about 10% success for
orthologs of 9-15% divergence (Figure 2). A similar pattern was observed for D. yakuba (data not shown).

Reduced false positive rate using conserved genes for
normalization

We accounted for four confounding factors that are
expected to decrease the apparent genomic content and
thereby lead to false negatives (Table 2). First, we identified D. melanogaster X chromosome features that had
BLAST hits only to autosomes in the heterologous species (possible deletion or movement off the X). Second,
we identified features for which there were a greater
number of regions of sequence similarity in D. melanogaster than in the heterologous species (differences in
copy number or paralogs). Third, we identified features
that had no sequence similarity to any region in the heterologous species (possible deletions). Finally, we identified
features with hits to heterochromatin in the chromosomal characteristics that might contribute to false negatives. The appropriateness of including this factor is
supported by the D. melanogaster analysis, where nearly
50% of the features on the array with hits to heterochromatin (130 features total) were either X features not
found to be in genomic excess (50) or autosomal features
found to be in excess (13). These four confounding factors account for 47% of the false negatives in D. simulans
and 23% of the false negatives in D. yakuba (Figure 3).
We accounted for three confounding factors that may
lead to false positives (Table 3). First, we identified D.
melanogaster autosomal features that had a top BLAST

The false positive rate (the percent of array features found
to be in genomic excess that map to autosomes) was
greater in the heterologous species than in D. melanogaster (D. melanogaster: 16%, D. simulans: 18%, D.
yakuba: 45%). If the entire complement of genes on the
array had been used for normalization, rather than using
a set of 1000 genes with sequence conservation, then
there would have been an even greater increase in the
false positive rate in D. simulans (39%) and D. yakuba
(67%) relative to the platform species, D. melanogaster
(12%). We also tested this conserved gene normalization
strategy with a set of only 100 conserved genes. Normalizing with this reduced set of genes, there is still significant reduction in false positives, but with reduced true
positive rate (D. simulans: 10% false positives, 29% true
positive; D. yakuba: 21% false positives, 17% true positive).
Reduced true positive rate with sequence divergence

In order to determine the extent to which DNA sequence
divergence between orthologs hinders the ability to accurately detect increased genome content, we examined the
relationship between successful identification of X chro-

hit to the heterologous X chromosome (possible movement onto the X). Second, we identified D. melanogaster
autosomal features with a greater number of BLAST hits
to the heterologous species than D. melanogaster (possible real duplications). We also considered heterochromatic regions as possible false positives. These three
confounding factors account for 23% of the false positives
in D. simulans and 30% of the false positives in D. yakuba
(Figure 3). Features with hits to telomeric regions were
also considered, as these have a greater tendency to duplicate; however, very few incidences of false positive hits to
telomeres were found.

Discussion
Uncovering incidences and patterns of gene duplication
can increase our understanding of this important source
of functional novelty [e.g. [43,44]]. It is well documented
that aCGH can be used to identify gene dosage, as seen in
tumor studies for cancer diagnosis [reviewed by [26]],
and in studies of within-species copy number variation
[e.g. [23]]. There have also been multiple studies that have
successfully used aCGH to identify duplications between
species [12,20,39]. Although both hybridization biases

resulting from copy number variation for within-species
duplicate detection [45,46] and hybridization biases
resulting from sequence variation for between-species
analysis of single genes [29,40,47] have been addressed,
the complexities of duplicate detection under conditions
of sequence divergence have not been well addressed.
Among the between-species studies of copy number differences in primates, no technical or computational
assessment of the influence of sequence divergence has
been made. Instead, the result that more lineage-specific
copy number increases were found relative to decreases
has been taken to indicate that sequence divergence does
not significantly contribute to copy number estimates
[12]. While full genome sequence does exist for primate
species such that a computational validation of aCGH
results could be conducted [e.g. [20]], we instead chose an
empirical test. We used X-linked array features as a
model for duplication and studied three Drosophilid species for which full genome sequence was available. The

thousands of X-linked orthologs allowed us to address
systematic biases of aCGH duplicate detection that could
not have been addressed by the lesser number of known
duplicates among Drosophilids [17,48,49]. These systematic biases are introduced by sequence divergence in heterologous the species and by other confounding genomic
characteristics related to species divergence.
Within-species duplicate detection

Consistent with previous aCGH surveys of gene duplication, the 93% true positive rate for D. melanogaster Xlinked genes demonstrates a strong ability of aCGH to
detect copy number variation among individuals of a species. The fact that approximately half of the false negatives had BLAST hits to one or more autosomal
sequences reflects an ability to quantify relative genomic
content other than straightforward duplication. The significant correlation between the number of similar autosomal sequences and the hybridization ratio reflects the
ability to estimate relative copy number. Such a quantitative relationship between copy number and hybridization
ratio is integral to cancer diagnostics [50]. Such withinspecies correlations have been validated repeatedly
[26,51]. For example, male and female samples mixed in
different amounts were used to assess the ability to identify tumor cells in heterogeneous (tumor and normal) tissues samples [52]. Our within-species results from D.
melanogaster add evidence that this quantitative relationship persists even when the additional copies do not
share perfect sequence identity. As such, the existence of
large gene families can interfere with the ability to detect
specific gene duplicates with aCGH.
Duplicate detection in heterologous species will decrease
with sequence divergence

Because aCGH relies on sequence similarity for DNA
hybridization, sequence dissimilarity of sample DNA to a
microarray probe is expected to decrease hybridization of
that sample to the array when competitively hybridized
with DNA of greater sequence similarity. A roughly linear
relationship between sequence divergence and hybridization ratio has been demonstrated repeatedly for single
copy genes [29,40,47]. Variation in sequence divergence

explains ~ 45-60% of the variation in hybridization ratio
[40,53], and our results demonstrate that this will affect
our ability to detect gene duplicates in a heterologous
species. Successful detection of X-linked genes decreased
for heterologous species, and sequence similarity to the
array feature had a strong impact on this success. At successively greater sequence divergence there was a lower
true positive rate for X chromosome orthologs. When
translated to non-model studies of gene duplication
among evolutionarily interesting lineages, this predicts of
a discovery rate biased toward highly similar gene duplicates.
The biased discovery of highly similar gene duplicates
means that many of those recovered by aCGH are likely
to be the products of evolutionarily recent events having
occurred between closely related species. Therefore, the
current results indicate that fewer duplicates will be
detected in more distantly related taxa in general, a conclusion that should impact experimental design and phylogenetic inference. Older gene duplicates will be
recovered only if they are highly conserved. Such conserved duplicates are thought to be retained when there is
a selective advantage for greater protein production of a
particular gene product [for review see [1]] as suggested
for cold adaptation genes in Antarctic ice fish [10]. Similarly, a selective advantage for spatially or temporally
divided expression can produce highly conserved protein
coding regions (a type of subfunctionalization) due to
mutations in the enhancer regions [54]. Such changes in
enhancer regions have been reported to occur in recent
duplicates [55]. In some cases, novel function may come
about with only a small level of sequence divergence of
the protein coding region. Such highly similar duplicates,
which can result from a limited number of point mutations, will be retained when the closely related gene products confer a selective advantage, as suggested for the
evolution of olfactory receptor family [reviewed by [56]]
and opsin genes [e.g. [57]]. Highly conserved duplicates
may also be the product of gene conversion [yeast: [58],
roundworm: [59]]. Such highly similar duplicates could
be recovered with reasonable success by aCGH.

Machado and Renn BMC Genomics 2010, 11:304
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/304

It is important to note that sequence divergence among
duplicates is likely to be a complex process, not completely modeled here with the use of the X chromosome.
Here we detect a duplication of 1N to 2N and both copies
of the gene in the heterologous species exhibit the same
percent sequence identity to the array feature. Because
competitive hybridization relies on ratios rather than
absolute levels, the technique should work equally well
for duplications of 2N to 4N, as would occur on autosomes. However, in a natural, between-species comparisons, the gene duplicates present will include those for
which two copies are diverged to varying degrees. From
the data presented here, it is unclear what the success rate
would be for a gene duplicate pair in which one copy was
conserved and the other had diverged. This is exactly the
case in the proposed processes described by "neofunctionalization" [60]. The rapid evolution of one or both
copies following gene duplication has been suggested to
accompany adaptive evolution in several instances [e.g.
[61,62]]. While theoretical hypotheses regarding the
adaptive significance of gene duplicate function or the
selective forces that have maintained gene duplicates are
tempting, it should be noted that aCGH will also recover
gene duplicates that have acquired psuedogene status
[63] or that have been fixed in a population due to nonadaptive processes. In all cases, the individual sequence
characteristics (GC content, distribution of mismatches,
presence of indels, etc.) will influence the hybridization
kinetics [40,47,64] and therefore the duplicate discovery
rate using aCGH.
Additional factors affecting duplicate detection

Genomic factors other than sequence divergence can
affect duplicate detection in heterologous species. The
seven factors that we took into consideration account for
a large portion of the false positives and false negatives of
the D. simulans and D. yakuba analyses. If we omit these
sets genes from the calculations, our true positive rate for
duplicate detection increases to 53% in D. simulans and
32% in D. yakuba, with the false positive rate reduced to
14% in D. simulans and 32% in D. yakuba. The remaining
false negatives are due to sequence divergence, microarray technical error, or a variable that we did not quantify.
However, for gene duplicate discovery in non-model
organisms, such detailed sequence information is unlikely
to be available and as such would not factor into the analysis. The remaining false positives detected in this study
potentially represent actual duplications that were not
identified by the BLAST queries due to improper
sequence assembly. Algorithms for genome assembly
cluster together similar sequences. This legitimately collapses alleles into a single physical location, but also
potentially collapses duplicated loci, thus reducing duplications identified by BLAST [19]. However, by determin-

Page 6 of 9

ing depth of coverage from raw sequence reads such
errors can be addressed and compared to the current
array results [e.g. [20]].
Use of conserved genes for normalization

When detecting duplication levels in heterologous species, it is important to use a normalization method that
accounts for hybridization bias [40,41]. Multiple techniques have been proposed for the normalization of
aCGH data in order to account for biases due to dramatic
sequence divergence in a heterologous test species [65]
and the large biases due to extreme copy number, or large
segmental duplications associated with cancer [e.g.
[45,66]]. In this study, we find support for the use of a set
of conserved genes for normalization, such as proposed
by van Hijum et al. [65]. In the cross-species experiments,
this normalization technique provided a substantial
decrease in the false positive rate.
For non-model species lacking substantial genomic
DNA sequence data, the set of conserved genes to be
used for normalization can be selected according to high
sequence conservation across more distantly related and
sequenced organisms. Here we use a gene set of 1000
conserved Drosophila features for normalization (4.5% of
the array). However, we also test a reduced set of only
~100 conserved genes (0.5% of the array features), which
represents a gene set size that would be more easily
obtainable for species lacking substantial sequence information. This reduced gene set still provides significant
reduction in false positives. Van Hijum et al. [65] noted
"satisfactory" results using 1.2% array features for normalization, or 20 features per block for print-tip normalization.

Conclusions
Array CGH can be used to effectively identify gene duplication and genome content; however, certain biases are
present due to sequence divergence and other genome
characteristics resulting from the divergence between lineages. Using the X chromosome as a proof-of-concept,
we demonstrated high true positive rates for genome
content in heterologous species. However, we do find a
strong negative effect of gene sequence divergence on the
ability to identify X-linked genes. X-linked orthologs with
less than 90%-95% identity were much less likely to be
detected. The false negative rate for these diverged genes
should be taken into consideration when making phylogenetic inferences with aCGH because both false positive
and false negative rates increase with phylogenetic distance. Furthermore, a biased set of duplicates will be
recovered such that those with high sequence similarity
will be over-represented. This means that aCGH will be
more likely to recover gene duplicates that have been
retained due to a selective advantage that relies on con-

Machado and Renn BMC Genomics 2010, 11:304
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/304

served gene function, such as increased gene product.
Duplicates that have been retained for a selective advantage due to directional selection acting on many loci in
one or both copies will be under-represented. Due to this
differential representation of gene duplicate classes, one
must be cautious when evaluating the relative contribution of different evolutionary processes to the interspecific diversity under study. The aCGH technique is
strongly applicable to the growing number of non-model
species groups for which a single microarray platform is
available. Sequence information provided by EST analysis
can be used to select the appropriate set of conserved
genes for array normalization that will substantially
reduce the false positive rate. Through sequence analysis
and functional testing of aCGH-identified gene duplicates, researchers will be able to further address the role
of gene duplication in adaptation, speciation, and population dynamics.

Microarray Analysis

We used a Drosophila melanogaster microarray with
~22,000 features containing PCR products (~500 base
pairs long) generated from custom primers designed to
predict open reading frames [23] (GEO platform number
GPL6056). The microarray was printed on poly-L-lysine
slides (Thermo Scientific) in a 48 pin format using an
OmniGrid-100 arrayer (GeneMachines). Following
hydration, snap drying and UV cross-linking, the slides
were blocked with succinic anhydride and sodium borate
in 1-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidinone, rinsed, dried according to
standard procedure [67] and stored dry until used.

Hybridized arrays were scanned with an Axon 4000B
scanner (Axon Instruments) using Genepix 5.0 software
(Axon Instruments). Features of poor quality (fluorescence < 2 standard deviations above background) or
known technical error (poor PCR, improper primer
design, unexpected PCR length etc.) were flagged and
excluded from the analysis. Features that survived this
quality control on less than two arrays per species were
excluded from the analysis. Raw data from Genepix was
imported into R. LIMMA [Linear Models for Microarray
Data, [68]] was used to apply a background correction
("minimum") and each of three (see below) within-array
intensity normalization ("loess") procedures. Raw and
normalized data are submitted to the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) repository under the series identifier
GSE19584. A linear model was fitted to the data using
"lmFit", and "eBayes" provided a correction of variation by
borrowing information across genes. Significance was
assessed after a FDR multiple testing correction at P <
0.1. In order to not confound statistical power and phylogenetic distance within our study, GEL50 measurements
of statistical power [69] were held equivalent such that
the D. yakuba analysis (GEL50 = 0.456) employed 4
hybridizations and the D. simulans analysis (GEL50 =
0.455) employed 6 hybridizations. This difference in
required technical replication was likely due to array
quality.

Sample Preparation and aCGH

Assessment of Normalization

Isogenic Drosophila melanogaster, D. simulans and D.
yakuba (strain # 14021-0231.36; 14021-0251.195; 140210261.01) were obtained from the UCSD Drosophila stock
center. Genomic DNA from D. melanogaster males and
virgin females of each species was extracted according to
a standard ProteinaseK/Phenol:Chloroform protocol and
quantified (Nanodrop 1000). The DNA was diluted to 0.3
μg/μl and size reduced using the Hydroshear (Genome
Solutions/Digilab) standard orifice to an average size of
1.5 - 2 Kb, verified by gel electrophoresis. Three micrograms of genomic DNA were fluorescently labeled with
Alexa-Fluors conjugated dCTP by Klenow fragment
polymerization (Invitrogen, Bio-Prime), the efficiency of
which was quantified (Nanodrop 1000) such that competitive hybridizations were matched for DNA concentration. Male D. melanogaster samples were used in
competitive hybridizations with six female D. melanogaster samples, six female D. simulans samples, and four
female D. yakuba samples, in dye swaps to account for
dye bias. Hybridizations proceeded for ~16 hours at 65°C

Since we expect the normalization of cross-species arrays
to be affected by a substantial number of diverged genes
in the non-platform species (and in this case, also a substantial number of duplicated loci), we compared our
preferred normalization technique, using a set of ~1000
genes that are highly conserved among the three Drosophila species (determined with NCBI megaBLAST 1/
2009), to a normalization based on a set of 100 conserved
genes and to a traditional normalization using the full
complement of array features. In each case, statistical
analysis for hybridization bias was performed (see above).

Methods
Array Production

Sequence Analysis

Features representing X chromosome genes were identified by the top BLAST hit of the feature sequence to D.
melanogaster genome sequence. Sequence divergence of
X chromosome orthologs was assessed as the percent
sequence identity (%ID) of the feature sequence to the top
BLAST hit in D. simulans and D. yakuba genome
sequence (E < 10-14, NCBI megaBLAST 1/2009).

Additional autosomal regions of high sequence similarity in each species were identified (E < 10-14) and a measure of the relative number of occurrences of a sequence
in the two genomes of interest was determined as the
ratio of the number of BLAST hits to the heterologous
species to number of BLAST hits to the reference species
(E < 10-10). Movement off of the X chromosome was predicted by the lack of any BLAST hit of the feature
sequence to the heterologous X chromosome. Conversely
movement onto the X chromosome was predicted by the
presence of any BLAST hit of an autosomal feature
sequence to the heterologous X chromosome. Furthermore, any hits to heterochromatin or to telomeric regions
(25 Kb from the end of a chromosome) were also
recorded. These factors represent between-genome chromosomal differences that can confound duplicate detection for cross-species aCGH analyses.
