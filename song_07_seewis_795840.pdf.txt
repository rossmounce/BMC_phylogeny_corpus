Abstract
More than 20 years ago, hantaviral antigens were reported in tissues of the Eurasian common
shrew (Sorex araneus), Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens) and common mole (Talpa europea),
suggesting that insectivores, or soricomorphs, might serve as reservoirs of unique hantaviruses.
Using RT-PCR, sequences of a genetically distinct hantavirus, designated Seewis virus (SWSV), were
amplified from lung tissue of a Eurasian common shrew, captured in October 2006 in Graubünden,
Switzerland. Pair-wise analysis of the full-length S and partial M and L segments of SWSV indicated
approximately 55%–72% similarity with hantaviruses harbored by Murinae, Arvicolinae,
Neotominae and Sigmodontinae rodents. Phylogenetically, SWSV grouped with other recently
identified shrew-borne hantaviruses. Intensified efforts are underway to clarify the genetic diversity
of SWSV throughout the geographic range of the Eurasian common shrew, as well as to determine
its relevance to human health.

Findings
Viruses antigenically related to Hantaan virus (HTNV),
the prototype virus of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, have been isolated from the Asian house shrew
(Suncus murinus), greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura
russula) and Chinese mole shrew (Anourosorex squamipes)
[1-4], indicating that shrews are capable of serving as incidental hosts of hantaviruses typically harbored by
rodents. Insectivores, or soricomorphs, also appear to harbor genetically distinct hantaviruses, as evidenced by the
recent demonstration of Camp Ripley virus (RPLV) in the
northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) [5], Cao

Bang virus (CBNV) in the Chinese mole shrew [6], Tanganya virus (TGNV) in the Therese shrew (Crocidura theresae) [7], and Ash River virus and Jemez Springs virus in the
masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) and the dusky shrew (Sorex
monticolus), respectively [8]. Moreover, Thottapalayam
virus (TPMV), a previously unclassified virus isolated
from the Asian house shrew [9,10], is now known to be a
bona fide shrew-borne hantavirus [11-14].
Earlier reports of hantaviral antigens in tissues of the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), alpine shrew (Sorex
alpinus), Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens) and comPage 1 of 5

mon mole (Talpa europea), captured in European Russia
and the former Yugoslavia [15-17], have largely gone
unnoticed. In this short report, we present the genetic and
phylogenetic analyses of a new hantavirus, designated
Seewis virus (SWSV), detected in the Eurasian common
shrew. These findings add to the expanding database on
soricid-associated hantaviruses and forecast that many
more hantaviruses will be found in diverse shrew species
throughout Eurasia.
Liver tissue from three Crocidura leucodon and lung tissue
from one Neomys anomalus and five Sorex araneus, captured during August and October 2006, in the village of
Seewis (46°59'N, 9°38'E), located in the Swiss canton of
Graubünden, a region endemic for Borna disease located
approximately 130 kilometers east of Zurich [18], were
studied. Total RNA, extracted from 20–50 mg of each tissue, using the RNA-Bee™ isolation kit (TEL-TEST, Inc.,
Friendswood, TX), was reverse transcribed, using M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) and a conserved primer (OSM55: 5'-TAGTAGTAGACTCC-3' and
SWS S1093F: 5'-TACAGCTGAGGAGAAGC-3' for the S
segments; OSM55 and SWS L1351F: 5'-CAAGGCCCAGCAAAACATAC-3' for the L segment; and OSV697: 5'GGACCAGGTGCADCTTGTGAAGC-3' for the M segment).
Gene-amplification reactions were performed in 50-μL
mixtures, containing 200 μM dNTP, 0.5 U of super-therm
polymerase (PureTech Co., Ltd. Seoul, Korea), 1 μg of
cDNA and 10 pM of each primer. Oligonucleotide primer
sequences for nested PCR, designed from TPMV and other
hantaviruses, were OSM55 and OSV845: 5'-CTTAGCTCGGGATCCATRTC-3', then OSM55 and OSV847: 5'-TATCATCACCMAGRTGGAA-3',
SWS
S1130F:
5'TACCAATCTTATCTGCGTC-3' and CBS-3'endR: 5'-TAGTAGTAKRCTCCYTRAA-3' for the S segment; OSV697 and
T-M1485R: 5'-CCAGCCAAARCARAATGT-3', then TM1199F: 5'-TAAVTTCAMCAAC ATGTCT-3' and TM1485R for the M segment; and OSM55 and T-L1454R:
5'-ATGCCC WATATGCCATGC-3', then OSM55 and TL390R: 5'-GTCACWGTRACCTC-3', MJN L181F: 5'-ATGAGATGATAAARCATGA-3' and T-L1454R, SWS L1351F and
PHL 3445R: 5'-GRTTAAACATACTCTTCCTCCACATCTC3', then SWS L1351F and SWS L2180R: 5'-GTA ACCTCAGATATCAAGC-3' for the L segment. Initial denaturation
was at 94°C for 5 min, followed by touchdown cycling
with denaturation at 94°C for 40 sec, annealing from
50°C to 37°C for 40 sec, elongation at 68°C for 1 min 20
sec, then 25 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 40 sec,
annealing at 40°C for 40 sec and elongation at 68°C for
1 min 20 sec in a Mastercycler ep gradient S (Eppendorf
AG, Hamburg, Germany). PCR products were purified by
the Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System
(Promega), and DNA sequences of at least three clones of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/114

each amplicon were determined in both directions, using
the dye primer cycle sequencing ready reaction kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an automated
sequencer (Model 377, Perkin Elmer Co.) [19]. DNA
sequences were then aligned using Clustal W [20] and
transAlign [21] with publicly available hantavirus
sequences and analyzed phylogenetically by PAUP version 4.0 [22] and RAxML [23]. The maximum likelihood
(ML) method under the GTR+I+G model of evolution, as
selected by Modeltest v.3.7 [24], was used, and ML bootstrap support was generated using the RAxML web-server
prototype that implements a novel rapid bootstrapping
algorithm [25].
Host identification was confirmed by mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) sequencing. Briefly, the cytochrome b region of
mtDNA was amplified by PCR, using previously described
universal primers, which permit amplification of a 482-bp
product (L14115: 5'-CGAAGCTTGATATGA AAAACCATCGTTG-3'; L14532: 5'-GCAGCCCCTCAGAATGATATTTGTCCAC-3') [26].
Unique hantavirus sequences of the S, M and L segments
were amplified from lung tissue of a single S. araneus. The
full-length S-genomic segment of SWSV strain mp70 was
1,641 nucleotides, with a predicted nucleocapsid protein
of 429 amino acids, starting at nucleotide position 40,
and a 314-nucleotide 3'-noncoding region. Pair-wise
alignment and comparison of the coding region of the S
segment indicated genetic similarities of 55.3–58.1% and
55.8–61.0% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels,
respectively, from representative Murinae, Arvicolinae,
Neotominae and Sigmodontinae rodent-borne hantaviruses. Unexpectedly, SWSV was even less similar to TPMV
VRC-66412 (49.3% at the nucleotide and 44.2% at the
amino acid level). As in other soricid-borne hantaviruses
discovered to date, the hypothetical NSs opening reading
frame, typically found in Arvicolinae and Neotominae
rodent-borne hantaviruses, was not found in SWSV.
Analysis of a 250-nucleotide region of the Gn glycoprotein-encoding M segment also exhibited low nucleotide
sequence similarity to rodent-associated hantaviruses,
including HTNV 76–118 (68.8%), Dobrava virus (DOBV)
AP99 (69.9%), Soochong virus (SOOV) SC-1 (72.4%),
Seoul virus (SEOV) HR80-39 (72.0%), Puumala virus
(PUUV) Sotkamo (65.0%), Tula virus (TULV) M5302v
(66.4%) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV) NMH10 (68.8%).
And comparison of a 3,327-nucleotide region of the L segment showed similar degrees of sequence identity of
approximately 65% between SWSV and rodent-borne
hantaviruses.
Phylogenetic analyses, based on the full-length S and partial M and L segments, generated by the ML method, indi-

cated that SWSV was distinct from rodent-borne
hantaviruses (Figure 1). In the representative ML trees,
based on M- and L-segment sequences, SWSV clustered
with CBNV and RPLV, two recently identified hantaviruses harbored by soricine shrews. S-segment analysis further supported the close relationship between SWS and
CBNV. While TPMV was consistently more divergent phylogenetically from SWSV than even the rodent-borne
hantaviruses, TGNV was not (Figure 1). In such trees,
SWSV, although distinct, shared a more recent common
ancestor with Murinae rodent-borne hantaviruses than
with TPMV, suggesting a possible host-switching event in
the distant past.
RT-PCR amplification of SWSV presented unanticipated
challenges. While still cool on arrival, the small amount of
tissue from the single infected shrew had thawed in transit, resulting in a low RNA yield, which limited the
options in cDNA synthesis. Also, the divergent genome of
SWSV made difficult the designing of suitable primers.
Although these difficulties were partly overcome, they
contributed to our inability to obtain the full genome of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/4/1/114

SWSV. Future work will be necessary to complete this task
and to isolate SWSV in cell culture.
Although several viruses have been isolated from soricomorphs, including Erve virus from Crocidura russula [27],
tick-borne encephalitis virus from Talpa europea [28] and
S. araneus [29], and a canine distemper-like paramyxovirus from Erinaceus europeus [30], their detection has been
largely incidental or accidental. By contrast, our study specifically targeted the identification of new hantaviruses in
shrews, as a means of better understanding their evolutionary origins. In some ways, however, the demonstration of a phylogenetically distinct hantavirus in the
Eurasian common shrew was not surprising and was thoroughly consistent with decades-old reports of hantavirus
antigens in S. araneus in the former Yugoslavia and Russia
[15-17]. The important distinction is that we now have
sequence data to substantiate the existence of a hantavirus
in the Eurasian common shrew. Further support for this
long co-evolutionary relationship is provided by the
recent detection of SWSV sequences in S. araneus captured

in Hungary and Finland (S. Arai and R. Yanagihara,
unpublished observations).
Found in woodlands, grasslands and hedgelands throughout Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and Great
Britain (but excluding Ireland), and extending throughout
Russia, S. araneus (family Soricidae, subfamily Soricinae)
is among the most widely dispersed small mammal species in Eurasia. Although their nests are generally made
underground or under dense vegetation, they occasionally
occupy burrows of mice, voles and moles. While solitary,
their extremely aggressive territorial behavior and carnivorous eating habits make plausible the acquisition and
transmission of hantavirus infection through wounding.
However, to what extent such host-switching events might
have occurred in the distant past is unknown. Nevertheless, as judged by the nucleotide sequence analyses of the
S-, M- and L-genomic segments, the polyphylogenetic
relationships of SWSV and other soricid- and rodent-associated hantaviruses are suggestive. The discovery and
genetic characterization of other soricid-borne hantaviruses will clarify whether the reservoir host of the primordial hantavirus was harbored by a soricid or rodent
ancestor.

As recently estimated from sequence analysis of cytochrome b mtDNA and nuclear genes BRCA1 and ApoB,
the Palearctic and Nearctic Soricinae (i.e., Sorex in Eurasia
and Otisorex in North America) diverged approximately
14 million years before present [31]. In this regard, the
identification of genetically distinct hantaviruses in North
American soricines, such as S. cinereus and S. monticolus in
the United States [8], will aid in the elucidation of the
phylogeography and parallel co-evolution of Sorex-borne
hantaviruses in the Old and New Worlds. Also, intensified
efforts to isolate SWSV and other hantaviruses harbored
by shrews will clarify their importance to human health.
