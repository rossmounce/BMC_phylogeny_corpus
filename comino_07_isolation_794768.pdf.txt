Abstract
Background: Cynara cardunculus L. is an edible plant of pharmaceutical interest, in particular with
respect to the polyphenolic content of its leaves. It includes three taxa: globe artichoke, cultivated
cardoon, and wild cardoon. The dominating phenolics are the di-caffeoylquinic acids (such as
cynarin), which are largely restricted to Cynara species, along with their precursor, chlorogenic acid
(CGA). The scope of this study is to better understand CGA synthesis in this plant.
Results: A gene sequence encoding a hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) involved in the
synthesis of CGA, was identified. Isolation of the gene sequence was achieved by using a PCR
strategy with degenerated primers targeted to conserved regions of orthologous HCT sequences
available. We have isolated a 717 bp cDNA which shares 84% aminoacid identity and 92% similarity
with a tobacco gene responsible for the biosynthesis of CGA from p-coumaroyl-CoA and quinic
acid. In silico studies revealed the globe artichoke HCT sequence clustering with one of the main
acyltransferase groups (i.e. anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase). Heterologous
expression of the full length HCT (GenBank accession DQ104740) cDNA in E. coli demonstrated
that the recombinant enzyme efficiently synthesizes both chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroyl quinate
from quinic acid and caffeoyl-CoA or p-coumaroyl-CoA, respectively, confirming its identity as a
hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: quinate HCT. Variable levels of HCT expression were shown among wild
and cultivated forms of C. cardunculus subspecies. The level of expression was correlated with CGA
content.
Conclusion: The data support the predicted involvement of the Cynara cardunculus HCT in the
biosynthesis of CGA before and/or after the hydroxylation step of hydroxycinnamoyl esters.

Background

Results

Cynara cardunculus L. is a perennial member of the Asteraceae family and has been sub-classified into three taxa:
globe artichoke (var. scolymus L.), cultivated cardoon (var.
altilis DC), and wild cardoon [var. sylvestris (Lamk) Fiori].
Molecular, cytogenetic and isozyme evidence suggests
that wild cardoon is the ancestor of both cultivated forms
[1-3].

Isolation of acyltransferase gene in globe artichoke
Using CODEHOP, targeting conserved regions of acyl
transferase proteins (Fig. 1, black frames; Table 1), a 717
bp incomplete globe artichoke acyltransferase sequence
was amplified. This sequence was extended towards both
the 3'- and 5'-ends of the gene by RACE-PCR and a 1480
bp sequence was isolated. The resulting 1308 bp ORF
(GenBank accession DQ104740) encodes a 436-residue
protein (Fig. 1 in bold) with a predicted molecular weight
of ~50 kDa. Its closest in silico match is with a tobacco
shikimate/quinate HCT [21], with which it shares 84%
identity and 92% similarity; both proteins belong to a
multifunctional superfamily of plant acyltransferases
[22]. The globe artichoke acyltransferase has a histidinecontaining motif (HHAAD, aa 153–157, Fig. 1, gray
boxes) identical to the highly conserved motif HXXXD
which is characteristic for acyl transfer catalysis. A second
consensus sequence, the DFGWG block found in other
acyltransferases [22-24], is present from aa 382 to 386
(Fig. 1, gray boxes). The next most closely related
sequence to the globe artichoke acyltransferase is an Arabidopsis thaliana HCT (80% identity and 89% similarity)
(Fig. 2). More distantly related acyltransferases are those
annotated as hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate: hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT) from tobacco and tomato
[25].

Globe artichoke plays an important role in human nutrition, mainly in Mediterranean diet: immature inflorescences (capitula), commonly referred to as 'heads' or
'buds', are consumed as a fresh, canned or frozen vegetable, while more recently, demand has been driven by its
reputation as health food.
The species has interesting applications in pharmacology
[4]. The roots contain inulin, a natural fibre found to
improve the balance of beneficial bacteria in the human
gut, while the leaves and heads represent natural sources
of bioactives such as luteolin and mono- and di-caffeoylquinic acids [5-8]. These compounds have been implicated in (i) the protection of proteins, lipids and DNA
from oxidative damage caused by free radicals [9-11], (ii)
the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, contributing to
the prevention of arteriosclerosis and other vascular disorders [10,12,13], (iii) hepatoprotective, choleretic, diuretic
and bile-expelling activities [4], (iv) the inhibition of HIV
integrase, a key player in HIV replication and its insertion
into host DNA [14,15], and (v) antibacterial and antifungal activities [16-18]. All of these bioactivities have been
attributed to the phenolics in the phenylpropanoid pathway [7], which is plant-specific [19]. The pathway catalyses the conversion of phenylalanine into a variety of
hydroxycinnamic acids, which are the precursors for flavonoids, hydroxycinnamic acid conjugates and lignins
[20]. Among phenolics, mono- and di-caffeoylquinic
acids play a key-role in the overall anti-oxidant/health
value of globe artichoke [8]. However, no information is
available yet about the synthesis of these compounds in
C. cardunculus.
This paper describes the cloning and biochemical characterization of an acyltransferase cDNA from globe artichoke. We explore the relationship between
acyltransferases transcription and polyphenolic content in
leaves, and establish a positive correlation between acyltransferase expression in various C. cardunculus accessions
and polyphenolic content, especially CGA. Our observations suggest this acyltransferase is implicated in the biosynthesis of CGA and its derivatives.

Heterologous expression of the identified acyltransferase
To assess the activity of the globe artichoke isolated acyltransferase, the cDNA was cloned and heterologously
expressed in E. coli, through the expression vector pET3a.
The recombinant plasmid or the void pET3a vector (control) were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE cells,
and expression of soluble acyltransferase was first tested at
standard induction temperature (37°C for 8 h). SDSPAGE analysis indicated that the pellet fraction of recombinant bacteria contained an overexpressed protein with
an apparent molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa,
consistent with the expected mass for the translation
product of the acyltransferase cDNA (Fig. 3). No acyltransferase protein could be detected by SDS-PAGE in the
supernatant fraction of lysed recombinant cells. Reducing
the temperature to 28°C during IPTG induction for 8
hours allows to increase the amount of soluble recombinant enzyme produced (Fig. 3) which can be detected in
both fraction: pellet and supernatant. No corresponding
protein is observed in samples prepared from bacteria carrying the control void vector.
Enzyme assay
The recombinant acyltransferase was used for substrate
specificity studies. HPLC profiles were generated after
incubation of the substrates caffeoyl-CoA or p-coumaroylCoA, with quinate or shikimate in the presence of recom-

shikimate, to synthesize caffeoylquinate (i.e. chlorogenic
acid), p-coumaroyl quinate, caffeoylshikimate or p-coumaroyl shikimate, depending on the substrates supplied.
In presence of the recombinant proteins, a new product

We also successfully investigated the ability of the isolated

described in other species [21,26,27]: caffeoyl-CoA was

CoEnzyme A in presence of the recombinant protein (Fig.
4b).
Determination of kinetic parameters
Kinetic parameters of the HCT enzyme were evaluated for
the different substrates (Table 2). The affinity of the
enzyme for quinate as acceptor was higher than for shikimate. Moreover p-coumaroyl-CoA was the most efficient
donor, with a Vmax/Km of 0.041, followed by caffeoyl-CoA,
with a value of 0.01.
Identification and quantification of polyphenolics
Six compounds belonging to quinic acid esters were quantified (Table 3, see Fig. 6 for chromatograms). 'Violet Margot' and wild cardoon leaves presented a high mean
content of total caffeoylquinic acid (respectively, 60.8 ±
1.98 and 59.9 ± 4.30 mg/g dry matter) while the cultivated cardoon and 'Romanesco C3' leaves showed lower
contents (17.1 ± 2.59 and 15.0 ± 3.10 mg/g dry matter).

but was less represented than di-caffeoylquinic acids in
wild cardoon. All samples contained very low levels of pcoumaroylquinic acid.
Northern blot analysis
A northern blot approach was taken to identify a possible
correlation between HCT expression and polyphenolics/
chlorogenic acid content. As the different plant species
probably not exhibit exactly the same HCT sequence, PCR
was performed on each genomic DNA in order to isolate
a highly specific HCT probe (probe 1 from globe artichoke, probe 2 from cultivated cardoon, and probe 3 from
wild cardoon). A sequence alignment established a high
level of similarity (99%) between probe 2 and 3 (respectively isolated from cultivated cardoon and wild cardoon), but a rather lower level (80%) between probes 2
(or 3) and probe 1, from globe artichoke (data not
reported). When 'Romanesco C3' and 'Violet Margot' RNA

northern blot on cultivated and wild cardoon RNAs challenged with either probe 2 and 3, showing that a higher
level of HCT transcript was present in the wild form (Fig.

Discussion
Phenolic compounds are by far the commonest of plant
therapeutic molecules [28], and the major species present
in globe artichoke leaves are the di-caffeoylquinic acids
(e.g. cynarin), and their precursor CGA, a soluble phenolic which is widespread throughout the plant kingdom.
The definition of the CGA biosynthetic pathway remains
controversial, with three alternative routes (Fig. 8) under
current consideration [25]. These are (1) CGA synthesis
using a caffeoyl-glucoside as the active intermediate; (2)
synthesis of CGA from caffeoyl-CoA and quinic acid by
means of HQT (hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: quinate HCT),
which differs from HCT in its preference for quinate over
shikimate as a substrate; and (3) synthesis of p-coumaroyl-quinate by HCT or HQT and its subsequent
hydroxylation by p-coumarate-3'-hydroxylase (C3'H) to
form CGA. The first route has been identified in sweet
potato by Villegas and Kojima [29], who were able to
purify hydroxycinnamoyl D-glucose:quinate HCT and
show that caffeoyl D-glucose and quinic acid are the substrates for the biosynthesis of CGA. Routes (2) and (3)
were unequivocally established by Ulbrich and Zenk in
several differentiated plants and undifferentiated cell suspension cultures [27].
Recently, both the second and third CGA synthesis routes
have received experimental support. The biochemical
characterization of C3'H [30,31] and hydroxycinnamoyl-

CoA transferase HCT [21] suggests that CGA can be synthesized via the third route. However, since both HCT and
C3'H are active in A. thaliana, a species which does not
accumulate CGA, it is unlikely that this route can be generally exploited by plants which accumulate significant
amounts of CGA [25]. In tomato, it was difficult to establish whether HQT acts directly on caffeoyl-CoA and quinic
acid to produce CGA, or whether it synthesizes p-coumaroyl quinate from p-coumaroyl-CoA and quinic acid,
which is subsequently converted to CGA by the activity of
C3'H [25]. The second route was assumed to be dependent on the relative sizes of the caffeoyl-CoA and p-coumaroyl-CoA pools present. Nevertheless, strong support
for the prevalence of the second route, at least in tomato,
was provided by experiments in which the silencing of
HQT caused the level of leaf CGA to fall by 98%, and to
rise by 85% when it was over-expressed.
In a study of the phenolic content in various globe artichoke tissues and organs, total phenol concentration was
shown to be greatest in the leaves, and declined in the
heads during their development [8]. The variation in antioxidant activity (generated by phenolic compounds) in
globe artichoke extracts may, therefore, be attributed to
the choice of plant tissue used as the source of extract,
rather than to any variation in genotype or environment.
Thus we used leaf as our source of mRNA in order to generate the necessary cDNA, and exploited CODEHOP to
isolate globe artichoke HCT. The heterologous (in E. coli)
expression product of the cloned HCT sequence was a ~50
kDa recombinant protein, which was active when provided with either p-coumaroyl-CoA or caffeoyl-CoA ester
as acyl donors, at comparable Km values of 53.0 ± 13.0 μM
and 61.7 ± 0.004 μM, respectively. Moreover, the artichoke HCT showed a preference for quinic acid over

shikimic acid as an acceptor (53.0 ± 13.0 μM vs 701.7 ±
52.0 μM). This behaviour contrasts with that of tobacco
HCT [21], but is consistent with the activity of HQT isolated from tobacco and tomato [25]. Interestingly,

although the globe artichoke HCT sequence is closely
related to that of its tobacco ortholog, its activity appears
to be more similar to that of tobacco and tomato HQT.

The Km and Vmax values were calculated from triplicates by the Lineweaver-Burk method.

In order to evaluate the role of HCT in the biosynthetic
pathway of CGA in globe artichoke, the purified enzyme
was provided in vitro with quinic acid and either p-coumaroyl-CoA or caffeoyl-CoA. Since the enzyme was active
with both p-coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA, it is clear
that this HCT can act either before and/or after 3'-hydroxylation step. Other experiments have demonstrated that
the heterologously expressed HCT, in the presence of
quinic acid as the acyl donor, is four times more efficient
when provided with p-coumaroyl-CoA rather than with
caffeoyl-CoA (Vmax/Km values of, respectively, 0.041 and
0.01). However, these observations do not constitute an
absolute proof that the third biosynthetic route is preferred over the second, since the level of HCT is not necessarily limiting in vivo. Note that CGA synthesis is also
regulated by its interaction with C3'H, a P450 whose
enzymatic turnover was found to be low [32].

globe artichoke HCT was found to cluster with the major
anthranilate
N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase
group defined by Burhenne et al. [33]. It is clearly closely
related to its tobacco and A. thaliana orthologs.
C. cardunculus includes two crop species, the globe artichoke and the cultivated cardoon, along with the ancestral
wild cardoon. In our samples, p-coumaroylquinic acid
was ubiquitously detected at a low concentration (Table
3), presumably because this quinate ester is a transient
intermediate, unlike chlorogenic acid, which is considered to be an accumulation product in several plant species [30]. Di-caffeoylquinic acid synthesis remains
unknown in higher plants. However, due to their close
structural relationship with CGA, it is reasonable to suppose that the di-caffeoylquinic acids are derived from simple quinic acid monoesters. CGA and di-caffeoylquinic
acid quantification studies on the leaves of four plant
accessions were carried out to identify any correlations
between these two families of molecule (Table 3). The
globe artichoke 'Violet Margot' and the cultivated cardoon
contained comparable levels of CGA and di-caffeoylquinic acids. On the other hand, in the globe artichoke
'Romanesco C3' there was ten fold more CGA than di-

Globe artichoke HCT belongs to a versatile plant acyltransferase family that shares certain structural motifs
(Fig. 1, grey boxes), including several plant members
involved in a number of secondary metabolism pathways.

caffeoylquinic acids, while in the wild cardoon, this difference was about two fold. Therefore, the regulation of the
synthesis of di-caffeoylquinic acids should be, possibly,
genotype-dependent.

Northern blots, using cDNA from the same three C. cardunculus subspecies analysed above, were performed to
study patterns of HCT expression. As these diverse genotypes could carry distinct allelic forms of HCT, we devel-

cultivated forms of C. cardunculus, the expression of HCT
appears to be correlated with leaf polyphenolic content,
especially with respect to caffeoylquinic acid derivatives,
suggesting that this HCT has an essential role in the synthesis of CGA and related esters.
In a recent report [25], caffeoyl-CoA has been firmly established as a major substrate for the acylation of quinic acid
and the synthesis of CGA in Solanaceous plants. Our
future research activity will be focused in analysing the in
vivo expression of HCT, as well as on the isolation of other
acyltransferases, such as HQT, which may be involved in
the phenylpropanoid pathway of C. cardunculus

oped three species-specific probes [probes 1 (globe
artichoke), 2 (cultivated cardoon) and 3 (wild cardoon).
A positive relationship between the quantity of HCT transcript and the content of caffeoylquinic acids was
observed in all accessions. Since HCT silencing induces an
increase (or no significant change) in the amount of caffeoylquinic compounds in tobacco [34], whereas HQT
silencing (in tomato) results in a decrease in CGA content
[25], HQT transcripts may well play a pivotal role in determining the make-up of the CGA pool, and the behaviour
of HCT in globe artichoke is fully consistent with this
model.

Conclusion
CGA is particularly abundant in species belonging to the
Asteracaeae, Solanaceae and Rubiaceae families [35], but its
mode of biosynthesis is still unclear in many plants. We
have described the cloning and expression of HCT, an
acyltransferase acting both upstream and downstream of
the 3'-hydroxylation step. In addition, for both wild and

Plant material and RNA extraction
Leaves of globe artichoke, cultivated cardoon and wild
cardoon were collected from experimental fields at the
University of Catania in Cassibile, Sicily (Italy). Total RNA
was extracted from approximately 100 mg fresh tissue
using the "RNAwiz" reagent (Ambion, USA), following
the manufacturer's instructions. Final RNA concentration
was determined by spectrophotometry, and its integrity
was assessed by electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) formaldehyde-agarose gel [36].
Purification and cloning of globe artichoke HCT
Reverse transcription from total RNA was achieved using
poly(dT)primer and M-MuLV RNaseH- RT (Finnzymes,
Finland), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Incomplete cDNAs were derived by PCR, using as template the cDNA generated by reverse transcription. Based
on conserved regions of the acyltransferase amino acid
sequence (Fig. 1), primers COD1For and COD1Rev
(Table 1) were designed, with each primer consisting of a
short 3' degenerate core and a longer 5' consensus clamp
region. As recommended by Morant et al. [37], a cDNA
amplification step was first performed, and the fragment
of expected size was isolated from 1% agarose gel separations of the total amplicon. DNA sequences were resolved
by BMR genomics [38]. Specific primers were designed for
3'- and 5'-end amplification of the HCT transcript, based
on the derived incomplete cDNA sequence (Table 1). For
the 3'-end, the template was the poly(dT) reverse transcription product, and the primers consisted of poly(dT)
oligonucleotides in combination with the specific primers
ART2For and ART2For-nested (Table 1). The fragment of
expected size was isolated from an agarose gel separation,
cloned into pCR®2.1 (Invitrogen, USA), and sequenced.
For the 5'-end, full-length cDNA produced with the SuperScript™ Plasmid System (Invitrogen, USA) was inserted
into the pCMV•SPORT6 plasmid. PCR was performed on
this cDNA library using the antisense primer ART2Rev and
ART2Rev-nested (Table 1), along with the universal SP6
specific primer. The expected fragment was isolated from

an agarose gel separation, cloned into pCR®2.1 (Invitrogen, USA) and sequenced. The full length sequence was
validated by an amplification using primers UTR5' and
UTR3' (Table 1), designed from the sequence of the 5'and 3'-ends of the HCT transcript. Multiple sequence
alignments were performed using ClustalW [39], with
standard parameters. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA version 3.0 [40].
Heterologous expression in E. coli
The HCT open reading frame (ORF) was amplified using
HCTFor and HCTRev primers (Table 1), which additional
recognition sites NdeI (5'-end) and BamHI (3'-end). The
amplified fragment was restricted with NdeI and BamHI,
and ligated into the cloning site of digested pET3a plasmid (Novagen, USA). The resulting recombinant pET3aHCT plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain
BL21(DE)pLysE, and grown on a selective medium (LB,
Luria-Bertani, broth agar with 50 mg/l ampicillin and 34
mg/l chloramphenicol). Individual colonies were transferred to 4 ml overnight cultures in the same medium, and
2 ml of bacterial cell suspensions were then grown for 3 h
at 28°C in 50 ml of LB liquid medium with shaking (200
rpm). Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was
added to a final concentration of 1 mM and the cultures

were grown for further 8 h at 28°C. After centrifugation
for 10 min at 5000 g, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml
of phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.5 and lysed by three
cycles of freezing (in liquid nitrogen) and thawing (at
37°C), followed by three bursts of 30 s sonication on ice.
Sonicated cells were centrifuged at 4°C and 14,000 g for 5
min, and both supernatant and pellet were assayed for
HCT activity, and profiled by SDS-PAGE (10% resolving
gel, 5% stacking gel) using Coomassie brilliant blue staining [36]. Negative controls used comparable preparations
harbouring a void vector.
Enzyme assay and the determination of kinetic parameters
CGA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany), and
quinic acid from Fluka (Switzerland). CoA esters (substrates) were kindly provided by Dr. Legrand (CNRS-IBMP
laboratory Strasbourg, France) and then synthesised using
the procedure proposed by Beuerle and Pichersky [41].
4CL enzyme was kindly provided by Dr. Douglas (University of British Columbia Vancouver). The 20 μl reaction
mixture contained 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH
7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, between 50 ng and 1 μg of
enzyme, and the various substrates (p-coumaroyl-CoA,
caffeoyl-CoA, quinic acid and shikimic acid) at concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 5 mM. The reverse reaction,

Page 11 of 14

BMC Plant Biology 2007, 7:14

i.e. conversion of chlorogenic acid and CoA into caffeoylCoA, was tested as follow: 0.8 μg enzyme was incubated
in presence of 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM of chlorogenate and 100 μM CoA. Reactions were initiated by enzyme
addition, incubated at 30°C for 30 min, and terminated
by the addition of 20 μl of acetonitrile/HCl (99:1). Reaction products were analysed by reverse-phase HPLC on a
C18 column (LiChroCART 125-4, Merck), using the pair
of solvents 90% H2O, 9.9% CH3CN, 0.1% HCOOH and
80% CH3CN, 19.9% H2O, 0.1% CH3COOH. The percentage of the latter reached the 60% over a 15 min run time,
and 100% after 28 min.
Varying substrate-dependent concentrations were used for
Km determination. These consisted of 0.8 μg enzyme, 300
μM p-coumaroyl-CoA and 0.1–30 mM quinate for Km of
quinate. Km of p-coumaroyl-CoA was established with 10–
400 μM p-coumaroyl-CoA with quinate (20 mM) or 100–
600 μM with shikimate (20 mM) as acceptors and 0.8 μg
enzyme. For caffeoyl-CoA Km determination, 0.8 μg
enzyme, 20 mM quinate and 10–100 μM caffeoyl-CoA
were used. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 10 min.
An HPLC calibration curve was established for each molecule for quantification purpose. Km and Vmax values were
calculated from triplicated by Lineweaver-Burk plots.
Extraction of polyphenolic compounds, HPLC/DAD and
HPLC/MS analyses
On the basis of a genetic diversity assessment of 118 globe
artichoke accessions [2] about 30 entries were chosen to
represent the genetic variation present. Leaves of these
entries were assayed in triplicate for leaf polyphenolic
composition using HPLC/DAD/MS. Mono- and di-caffeoylquinic derivatives, apigenin and luteolin glycosides
were characterised and quantified. On the basis of these
observations, two globe artichoke entries ('Romanesco
C3' and 'Violet Margot'), one cultivated cardoon (accession '41') and one wild cardoon (accession 'Kamaryna')
were carried forward for a detailed study of the correlation
between leaf polyphenolic composition and HCT expression.

Leaf tissues from these four different plants at 22–23 fullyexpanded leaves stage were collected. Growth conditions
and management practices were similar to those used in
commercial cultivation. Half of the plant material has
been freezed immediately in liquid nitrogen, whereas the
other part was lyophylized within 12 h of collection and
the dried materials were ground to a powder and stored in
sealed bags at room temperature. The powders (2 g) were
extracted in 70% v/v ethanol (pH 2), cleared through a
0.45 μm filter, and the extractants first concentrated under
vacuum (Rotavapor 144 R, Büchi, Switzerland) then
rinsed with ultra pure acid water (MilliQ system, Waters
Co., USA) adjusted to pH 2 with formic acid. Defatting

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/14

was achieved by the addition of n-hexane, and the samples were re-concentrated under vacuum to a final volume
of 25 ml. Lyophilised extracts were stored at -20°C.
Leaves polyphenolic composition were analysed using
HPLC/DAD and HPLC/MS. HPLC/DAD analyses were
performed via a HP-1100 liquid chromatograph
equipped with a DAD detector and a HP 1100 MSD APIelectrospray (Agilent Technologies, USA). Polyphenol
compounds were separated using a 150 × 4.6 mm (5 μm)
Luna RP18 (Phenomenex) maintained at 27°C. The eluents were H2O (pH 3.2 adjusted with formic acid), and
CH3CN. A four-step linear solvent gradient system was
used, starting from 0% and reaching 100% CH3CN over a
30 min run, using a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The percentage of CH3CN was 20% from 0–5 min, 30% from 7–13
min, and 100% from 20–30 min. UV-vis spectra were
recorded in the range 190–600 nm, and chromatograms
were obtained at 330 nm.
HPLC/MS analyses were performed using a HP 1100L liquid chromatograph linked to a HP 1100 MSD mass spectrometer with an API/ESI interface (Agilent Technologies,
California, USA). The mass spectrometer operating conditions were: gas temperature, 350°C; nitrogen flow rate,
10.5 L/min; nebulizer pressure, 40 psi; quadrupole temperature, 40°C; and capillary voltage, 3500 V. The orthogonal position of the nebulizer with respect to the capillary
inlet enabled the use of the same conditions as for HPLCDAD analysis. The mass spectrometer was operated in
negative mode; and the fragmentor was set at 120 eV for
the standard and the isolated compounds.
Individual polyphenols were identified by comparison
and combination of their retention time, UV-Vis and mass
spectra of the peaks with those of authentic samples or
isolated compounds previously characterized [42].
Cynarin was obtained from Roth (Germany) and chlorogenic acid from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Quantification of individual polyphenols was performed directly
by HPLC-DAD using a four-point regression built with the
available standards. Curves with a correlation factor above
0.9998 were considered to be significant. Quantification
of caffeoylquinic mono- and di-esters was inferred from
330 nm chromatograms using CGA and cynarin for reference.
Development of C. cardunculus probes and northern blot
analysis
For northern blot analyses, 3 probes were developed by
applying a PCR Dig Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied
Science, Switzerland) with ART3For and ART3Rev primers
(Table 1) designed from the C. cardunculus HCT sequence:
probe 1 from globe artichoke, probe 2 from cultivated cardoon, and probe 3 from wild cardoon.

RNA were extracted from the second freezed part of the
plant material described above. Total RNA separated on
formaldehyde-agarose gels [36] before blotting to a nylon
membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) via overnight capillarity transfer. RNAs quality was confirmed by
ethidium bromide staining of the gel (Fig. 7, first panel)
following electrophoresis. Furthermore, RNA analysis was
normalized by using a constitutively expressed gene (RNA
18S, Fig. 7, second panel). Hybridization was performed
at 50°C for 16 h with a denatured DNA probe. After
hybridization, stringency washes (2 × 15 min at RT in 2×
SSC, 0.1% SDS and 2 × 15 min at 68°C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1%
SDS) was performed. The membrane subsequently was
incubated with anti-DIG-AP conjugate (diluted
1:20,000), and visualised using CDPStar reagents (Roche
Applied Science, Switzerland) by a 15–60 min exposure to
X-ray film.
