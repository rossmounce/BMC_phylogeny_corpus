Abstract
Background: The small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) is an important agricultural pest that not only
damages rice plants by sap-sucking, but also acts as a vector that transmits rice stripe virus (RSV), which can cause even
more serious yield loss. Despite being a model organism for studying entomology, population biology, plant
protection, molecular interactions among plants, viruses and insects, only a few genomic sequences are available for
this species. To investigate its transcriptome and determine the differences between viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus,
we employed 454-FLX high-throughput pyrosequencing to generate EST databases of this insect.
Results: We obtained 201,281 and 218,681 high-quality reads from viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus, respectively, with
an average read length as 230 bp. These reads were assembled into contigs and two EST databases were generated.
When all reads were combined, 16,885 contigs and 24,607 singletons (a total of 41,492 unigenes) were obtained, which
represents a transcriptome of the insect. BlastX search against the NCBI-NR database revealed that only 6,873 (16.6%) of
these unigenes have significant matches. Comparison of the distribution of GO classification among viruliferous, naïve,
and combined EST databases indicated that these libraries are broadly representative of the L. striatellus transcriptomes.
Functionally diverse transcripts from RSV, endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia and yeast-like symbiotes were identified,
which reflects the possible lifestyles of these microbial symbionts that live in the cells of the host insect. Comparative
genomic analysis revealed that L. striatellus encodes similar innate immunity regulatory systems as other insects, such
as RNA interference, JAK/STAT and partial Imd cascades, which might be involved in defense against viral infection. In
addition, we determined the differences in gene expression between vector and naïve samples, which generated a list
of candidate genes that are potentially involved in the symbiosis of L. striatellus and RSV.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, the present study is the first description of a genomic project for L. striatellus. The
identification of transcripts from RSV, Wolbachia, yeast-like symbiotes and genes abundantly expressed in viruliferous
insect, provided a starting-point for investigating the molecular basis of symbiosis among these organisms.

Most insects act as vectors for the transmission of viruses
and are thus one of the most important factors in the

study of the epidemiology and molecular pathology of
plant or animal virus diseases. In the plant kingdom, it
has been estimated that as much as 76% of viral diseases
are transmitted by insects [1,2]. As the insects feed,
insect-borne viruses easily penetrate the impermeable
cuticle that covers the plant epidermis and are directly
delivered into tissues or the cytoplasm. Insects belonging
to Hemiptera, such as planthoppers, aphids, leafhoppers
and whiteflies, have distinct piercing-sucking mouthparts

that include needle-like stylet bundles and it is not surprising that Hemipteran insects transmit the majority
(>55%) of the vectored plant viruses [1]. The mechanisms
of virus transmission are diverse. Based on differences in
the length of the time that insects can harbor infectious
viral particles, the transmission mechanisms can be classified into nonpersistent (harboring viruses for a few seconds/minutes), semipersistent (a few hours/days, but lost
upon molting), and persistent (often throughout the
lifespan of the vectors) [3]. Taking advantage of insect
transmission, viruses can spread among plant individuals,
usually resulting in epidemic outbreaks of viral disease
and severe agricultural yield loss. Therefore, understanding the biology of vector insects and the viral transmission mechanisms will provide insight into interactions
among insects, viruses, and plants, which will promote
the development of effective techniques to prevent viral
diseases of plants.
The small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus
Fallén), which was previously deposited in the deprecated, paraphyletic order Homoptera, is a notorious rice
pest that is now classified into the Delphacidae of
Hemiptera [4]. Besides injuring rice plants (Oryza sativa)
by sap-sucking with its piercing-sucking mouthparts, L.
striatellus also acts as the most important vector of rice
stripe virus (RSV, belonging to Tenuivirus) in a persistent
and propagative manner [5]. After invading L. striatellus,
RSV can escape from the midgut, salivary, and ovary barriers and propagate in L. striatellus. Evidences have
revealed that amorphous or filamentous inclusions of
RSV exist in the cytoplasm of midgut epithelial cells, salivary glands, and the fat body. Moreover, it has been confirmed that RSV particles exist in follicular cells of the
ovarioles and can be transmitted from female adults to
their progeny via eggs [6]. Concomitant with the changes
in global climate and agricultural systems, the damage
caused by L. striatellus and RSV increased dramatically
after 1960s. For example, in Jiangsu Province, one of the
major grain producing areas in China, rice fields suffering
from L. striatellus and RSV reached 1.57 million hectares
in recent years, accounting for about 80% of the rice fields
and causing 30 - 40% yield loss in that area [7]. In practice, controlling the outbreak of populations of L. striatellus is the most effective way to prevent RSV infection. As
a consequence, L. striatellus has long been used as a
model organism in the study of insect ecology, physiology, biochemistry, as well as molecular interactions
between vectors and plant viruses.
Although L. striatellus is important in both theoretical
and applied studies, genomic information for this insect
is quite limited. For example, to date, there is no wholegenome sequencing project for this species, and only a
few DNA sequences are available in the public databases
(< 100 entries). To collect genomic data efficiently, identi-

fication of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that represent
the transcribed genes from a given set of tissues or individuals is a cost-effective approach. We employed massively parallel pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-GS-FLX
platform to create EST databases of L. striatellus. In total
we identified 41,492 different unigenes from both viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus. Gene Ontology (GO) classification indicated they were involved in various biological
processes. Within these transcripts, we identified 1,451
potential microsatellite loci that can be used as DNA
markers. Transcripts from symbiotic microorganisms,
including RSV, Wolbachia and yeast-like symbiotes, were
identified, and functional annotation revealed the possible lifestyle of these microorganisms within the insect
cells. Comparison of our EST database with known insect
immune systems showed that L. striatellus encodes similar immune regulatory systems, such as RNA interference, and JAK/STAT and Imd pathways that might be
involved in resistance to viral infection [8-10]. In addition, comparative analysis of the two transcriptomes generated from viruliferous (RSV-infected) and naïve (noninfected) L. striatellus provided a list of candidate transcripts that potentially represent the biological response
to viral infection. To our knowledge, this work is the first
to study the transcriptome of L. striatellus. The transcriptional information provided will have an immediate effect
on gene cloning, annotation, and functional studies of
insect-plant-virus symbiosis.

Results and Discussion
Pyrosequencing and contig assembly of ESTs

As described in the Methods, viruliferous and naïve L.
striatellus whole body cDNA libraries were subjected to a
full-plate production run on the 454-GS-FLX sequencing
instrument, resulting in 207,918 and 225,158 reads,
respectively. The length distribution of these reads is
depicted in Additional file 1. After filtering for adaptors
and low-quality sequences, the two libraries generated
201,281 (viruliferous sample) and 218,681 reads (naïve
sample), respectively, with a total of 96,567,749 bases
(Table 1). Files containing these data were deposited in
the Short Read Archive of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with accession numbers
of SRX016333 (viruliferous) and SRX016334 (naïve),
respectively. As shown in Table 1, the general features of
the contig assembly from the two libraries are similar: a
total of 9,936 and 9,417 contigs were obtained from the
viruliferous and naïve datasets, with average lengths of
376 bps and 362 bps, respectively. When sequence data
from the two libraries were combined, the average length
of the high quality reads was 229 bp. These combined
reads were assembled into 16,885 contigs with an average
length of 384 bp (ranging from 61 to 8,651 bp). In addition, there were 24,607 reads that failed to be covered by

Similarity searches and gene ontology analysis

ESTs were subjected to BlastX similarity search against
the NCBI-NR protein database to determine their putative function. As shown in Fig. 1A, among the 41,492
unique sequences that contain ESTs from both viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus, 6,873 (16.6%) showed significant matches at the cutoff e-value ≤ 10-3, whereas 5,659
(13.6%) showed poor matches with e-values between 10-3
and 10. The remaining 28,960 (69.8%) ESTs exhibited no
useful matches (e-value > 10). As a result, we estimated
that the majority of the genes of L. striatellus (> 80%) are
function-unknown. To compare the similarity of L. striatellus genes with those of the other arthropods, EST
sequences were also subjected to BlastX search against
putative protein sequences (e-value ≤ 10-3) of eleven species of arthropod whose complete or draft genomes are
available. As shown in Fig. 1B, the smallest number of
database matches (8,959; 21.6%) was from deer tick
(Ixodes scapularis). This can be explained by the fact that
I. scapularis belongs to Arachnida and is not a species of
Insecta. The other species belong to Insecta are phylogenetically distributed into Phthiraptera (Pediculus
humanus), Coleoptera (Tribolium castaneum), Lepidoptera (Bombyx mori), Hymenoptera (Apis mellifera and
Nasonia vitripennis), Diptera (Drosophila melanogaster,
Anopheles gambiae, Culex pipiens and Aedes aegypti),
and Hemiptera (Acyrthosiphon pisum); however, the
numbers of matched sequences are very similar (from

10,290 - 11,646). Unexpectedly, although pea aphid (A.
pisum) belongs to Hemiptera, as does L. striatellus, and
currently its draft genome has the largest set of putative
protein coding sequences (37,994), only 10,979 (26.5%)
ESTs of L. striatellus were found to be similar to the proteome of A. pisum. This number is smaller than that of
parasitoid of flies (N. vitripennis, 11,162; 26.9%), head
louse (P. humanus, 11,203; 27.0%), honey bee (A. mellifera, 11,321; 27.3%), and red flour beetle (T. castaneum,
11,646; 28.1%). The number of matched sequences does
not entirely reflect the phylogenetic relationships and
genome sizes. This discordance might be simply attributed to the reason that our understanding of the genomes
of insect is relatively inadequate.
To assess whether our EST libraries were substantial
representative samples of the transcriptome of L. striatellus, the search results of BlastX against the Swiss-Prot/
TrEMBL database were combined, and matches were
assigned GO (gene ontology) categories with biological
process, molecular function, and cellular components
[11], respectively. Fig. 2 depicts the results of GO classification of molecular function and reveals that, for EST
libraries of viruliferous, naïve, and combined samples, the
percentages of transcripts in each GO category are quite
similar. This is also true for those ESTs classified as biological process as well as cellular components. These
results suggested that our EST libraries sampled widely
across the GO sub-categories and provided a good representation of the L. striatellus transcriptome.
The coverage of the combined EST library of L. striatellus was assessed by two analyses. Firstly, 366 contigs and
singletons of this library are found to encode possible
ribosomal proteins. We then compared these sequences
by BlastX search against a database of the ribosomal pro-

teins of D. melanogaster (e-value < 10-3), which contains
88 cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins and 79 mitochondrial
ribosomal proteins. Except four ribosomal proteins of D.
melanogaster (ribosomal protein L41, mitochondrial
ribosomal protein S5, S31 and L51), the others have significantly matched orthologs in the EST library of L. striatellus. The second analysis used the 41,492 unigenes of
L. striatellus to search against recently reported protein
sequences of its close-relative pea aphid (OGS 1.0 of A.
pisium, including 34,821 sequences from NCBI RefSeq
plus non redundant GLEAN) [12]. A total of 12,361 nonredundant protein sequences of A. pisium exhibited significant similarity to the sequences from L. striatellus
(BlastX, e-value < 10-3). The remaining unigenes that did
not show significant matches to A. pisum, were used to
search again against the protein sequences of D. melanogaster (containing 21,603 sequences). An extra 1,719 hits
were obtained, suggesting that the combined transcrip-

tome of L. striatellus has at least 14,080 protein coding
genes (12,361 from A. pisium plus 1,719 from D. melanogaster). We suppose that the remaining ~20,000 unigenes
which did not return significant BlastX hit may encode
previously uncharacterized proteins, non-coding RNAs,
or products from microbial endosymbionts.
Identification of microsatellites

Microsatellites (or simple sequence repeats, SSRs) are
hyper-polymorphic DNA fragments that contain repeating units of 1 - 6 base pairs [13]. Although they are widely
used as molecular markers, no microsatellite sequences
have been reported for L. striatellus. We identified many
microsatellite loci with di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats (minimum repeats > 6) from the combined EST library using SciRoKo ver 3.4 software [14].
Table 2 shows that, when perfect repeat motifs were considered, a total of 423 microsatellite markers were identified (ranging from 15 - 128 bps) and the mean
microsatellite density is one per 27.7 kb. Among these
molecular markers, tri-nucleotide repeats are predominant (76.6%), with (AAC)n being the most frequent motif
(32.4%). When a conserved degree of base-pair mismatch
(≤ 2 bps) was applied in the repeat motif search, a total of
1,451 microsatellite loci were identified (ranging from 15
- 132 bps) and the mean microsatellite density was one
per 8.07 kb. Of them, only 564 (38.9%) were found in protein coding transcripts, including those annotated as
hypothetical and conserved hypothetical proteins. Similar to the perfect repeats, tri-nucleotide repeats are also
predominant (56.2%) and the motif (AAC)n (18.7%) is the
most frequent, followed by (AAG)n (8.2%), (AAT)n
(7.7%), (AGC)n (6.3%) and (AGG)n (5.1%). Among all
possible di-nucleotide microsatellites [(CA)n, (GA)n,
(AT)n and (GC)n], no perfect or imperfect (GC)n
sequence repeat was found in EST library of L. striatellus.
These identified microsatellites have the potential to be
used in genetic mapping, parentage analysis, genotyping,
gene flow, and in population genetics.
Identification of transcripts of endosymbiotic microbes
Rice stripe virus (RSV)

RSV is the type member of the genus Tenuivirus that has
an unusual thread-like morphology under the electron
microscope [5]. The RSV genome contains four segmented single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), which encode
seven open reading frames (ORFs). Among them, RNA1
encodes a part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRP)[15]. RNA2, RNA3, and RNA4 are ambisense.
Each of them has two ORFs: one located on the 5' part of
the viral RNA and the other on the 5' part of the viral
cRNA. RNA2 encodes a function-unknown protein
(NS2) and a putative membrane glycoprotein, NSvc2.
RNA3 encodes a suppressor protein (NS3) and a nucleo-

capsid, NCP. RNA4 encodes a nonstructural disease-specific protein (SP) and a movement protein, NSvc4 [5,16].
To investigate the expression level of these ORFs in L.
striatellus, each RSV ORF sequence was searched against
our EST libraries. No RSV transcript was found in the
ESTs of naïve insects, confirming the naivety of this sample. For ESTs of the viruliferous insect, the abundance of
RSV transcripts is shown in Fig. 3. NS3 is the most abundant transcript (46 reads in total) and is a 23 kDa protein
that was experimentally demonstrated as a suppressor of
gene silencing because it can significantly reduce the
accumulation of small interference RNA (siRNA) in plant
cells, and can bind 21-nucleotide single-strand (ss)
siRNA, siRNA duplexes, and long ssRNA [17]. The dominant presence of the NS3 transcript suggests that after
invading L. striatellus, RSV must suppress the immune
response of the host insect as well as the host plant.
Therefore, it would be interesting to identify the host cellular target that is suppressed by RSV NS3 in a future
study. The other transcripts, including RdRP, NS2,
NSvc2, NCP, and SP, were present in very low levels in the
EST library of L. striatellus (matched reads from 1-5),

suggesting that replication and assembly of RSV is not
very active in the insect. In addition, we failed to identify
transcripts of the movement protein NSvc4, which agrees
with the existing hypothesis that the movement protein
usually functions in planta during virus spreading to
neighboring cells through the plasmodesmata [16], and
thus its expression might be shut down or at a very low
level in the insect.
Wolbachia

Wolbachia are obligatory, intracellular, Gram-negative
bacteria that infect a wide range of arthropods and nematodes [18]. Wolbachia can enhance their maternal transmission by manipulating host reproductive systems
through strategies such as cytoplasmic incompatibility,
parthenogenesis, feminization, and male killing [7]. Interestingly, it has been recently discovered that this bacterial
endosymbiont can reduce the RNA virus load in D. melanogaster and thus promote the antiviral potential of host
insect [19,20]. In L. striatellus, Wolbachia infection is
familiar and it was reported that the bacterium is distributed in the head, thorax, abdomen, salivary gland, guts,
ovary, and testis [21]. To investigate whether our samples

are infected by Wolbachia and to determine the gene
expression pattern of the bacterium, we searched the EST
libraries and annotated a total of 103 Wolbachia genes.
Both viruliferous and naïve EST libraries contain transcripts of Wolbachia, and the number of matched reads
in the naïve sample is four times larger than that of the
viruliferous sample (528 vs. 132 reads). It is not clear
whether this expression bias is associated with RSV infection.
The available sequenced genomes of Wolbachia encode
approximately 1,000-1,400 proteins [22]; therefore, we
estimated that the Wolbachia transcripts identified in our
study represent about 10-13% of the transcriptome of the
bacteria. Additional file 2 shows that the annotated Wol-

bachia genes can be classified into four major functional
categories. (1) Function-unknown genes: this group contains 53 transcripts (51.5%) of Wolbachia, including the
first three most abundant genes. (2) Genes essential for
cell processes such as DNA and RNA synthesis, ribosomal assembly, and electronic transportation. (3) Genes
responsible for de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides and
cofactors, including purine, riboflavin, coenzyme A, and
ubiquinone. Identification of these gene transcripts suggests that Wolbachia cannot obtain these chemicals from
the host insect cells and have to synthesize them themselves, as predicted by genomic annotation [7]. (4) Gene
products involved in transport, including an ABC transporter, proprotein translocase, permease, Na+/H+ antiporter, and a set of chaperones (DnaK, GroES, and a cold
shock protein). Among them, a gene encoding multidrug
resistance protein D was identified. The product of this
gene has an AcrF-like domain and belongs to the RND
efflux pump family [23]. We hypothesize that the protein
is responsible for pumping harmful host-derived chemicals out of the bacterial cell envelope to maintain homeostasis. Besides the above-mentioned genes, an ATPdependent protease, Lon, was identified. In bacteria, this
kind of protease degrades naturally unstable proteins and
thus takes part in diverse cell processes. It has been
reported that inactivation of Lon genes will attenuate the
virulence of various pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella enterica, Yersinia pestis, and Pseudomonas syringae
[24]. Based on this, we speculate that Lon of Wolbachia
plays an important role in symbiosis with L. striatellus.
Taken together, these identified Wolbachia genes may
reveal facets of how an endosymbiotic bacterium adapts
to the living environment within cells of host insects.

The YLS are microbial, transovarially inherited endosymbiotes being found in the fat body of Laodelphax striatellus. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that the YLS
consists of fungal species from the ascomycetes and

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:303
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/303

pyrenomycetes [25,26]. These endosymbiotes can benefit
their hosts by providing nutrition such as vitamins and
sterols, and loss of the YLS under high temperature can
cause deleterious effect on the host insect [27]. In this
study, although the whole bodies, rather than the fat bodies of insects, were used as samples to generate EST
sequences, and the strategy constructing cDNA libraries
(see Methods) has pre-excluded the large-scale contamination of 18S rRNA sequences that can be used to identify the species of YLS, close examination of the
combined EST library retrieved 3,061 unigenes that
matched well with the fungal species belonging to 45 genera (Additional file 3). Among them, 2,028 unigenes
exhibit significantly matches (Blastx search, e-value < 103), and the majority of these unigenes (2,637, 86.1%)
encode function-unknown proteins. For lacking of 18S
rRNA sequences, it is hard to determine whether a unigene derives from the YLS. However, among the matched
45 fungal genera, 20 of them have been previously
reported to be the YLS and their transcripts can provide
useful information [25,26]. For example, in our library
there are 44 unigenes matched well with Aspergillus
fumigatus. Among them, seven genes encode products
that may be involved in cell signaling, including two zinc
finger proteins, two ankyrin-repeat domain containing
proteins, a RING-finger protein and two proteins related
to the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Future
functional studies will reveal whether they have association with the regulation of expression of the symbiosisrelated genes.
Putative immune regulatory proteins

One of the long-term goals in studying vector-virus symbiosis is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
viruses manipulate the host innate immune system to
avoid injury from the defensive response. Therefore,
understanding the host immune system is fundamental to
answering this question. By comparing our EST database
with known immune proteins encoded by other insects,
especially D. melanogaster, putative regulatory pathways
of L. striatellus immune system were annotated. Among
them, we focused on antivirus related cascades, including
RNAi silencing, JAK/STAT, and Imd pathways (Table 3).
Putative RNA silencing related proteins

Currently RNA interference (RNAi) is the only mechanism that has been revealed to target viruses directly in
insects [9,28]. The model insect D. melanogaster encodes
two Dicers (Dicer-1 and Dicer-2), five Argonautes (AGO1 ~AGO3, PIWI, and Aubergine), and two dsRNA-binding proteins (dsRBP, including R2D2 and R3D1) that are
involved in RNAi. Among them, Dicer-2, AGO-2, and
R2D2 are responsible for the antiviral response. After
viral double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are recognized,
RNAse III enzyme Dicer-2 forms a complex with dsRBP

Page 7 of 13

R2D2, and then cleaves newly synthesized viral dsRNA to
produce small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide the
AGO-2 containing RISC complex to specifically recognize and degrade viral RNA [29]. Among the ESTs of L.
striatellus, five and seven contigs that might encode
Dicer- and AGO-like proteins, respectively, were identified (Table 3). However, because Dicer and AGO proteins
are similar in structure and our transcripts are not fulllength, it is difficult to discriminate these Dicer- and
AGO-like proteins into different sub-classes. In addition,
we obtained an R3D1 homologous transcript
(FQ92HJ001EMI2C) but failed to retrieve any R2D2
homologs from our database. Comparative analysis of
EST abundance showed that there was no substantial difference in the levels of putative RNAi related genes
between viruliferous and naïve samples of L. striatellus.
This is in accordance with previous results showing that,
even when challenged with pathogenic viruses, insect
RNAi pathway genes are constitutively expressed and are
not upregulated by viral infection [30,31]. Consequently,
which RNAi process of L. striatellus is suppressed by RSV
is an open question.
Putative JAK/STAT proteins

The JAK/STAT pathway consists of four major components: the ligand UPD, the receptor Domeless, the Janus
kinase (JAK), and the signal transduction and activators
of transcription (STAT) [9,32]. After receiving a specific
signal, UPD binds to the fat body receptor Domeless and
activates phosphorylation of the non-receptor tyrosine
kinase JAK. In due course, STAT is phosphorylated by
JAK to form dimmers and is recruited into the nucleus
where it binds to palindromic region of promoters of
downstream genes to activate their transcription [33]. In
D. melanogaster, the JAK/STAT pathway is usually
involved in differentiation of hemocytes and resistance to
bacterial or fungal infection. However, evidences have
accumulated that reveal that this pathway is also associated with the antiviral response, possibly through sensing
cytokine signals and inducing antiviral response genes
[30,34]. Using the above-mentioned proteins of D. melanogaster as search queries, we found that L. striatellus
encodes homologs of JAK, Domeless, and STAT (Table
3), suggesting it contains a JAK/STAT cascade and that
these matched proteins are conserved during insect evolution. However, no UPD transcript (UPD, UPD2, or
UPD3) was found. This can be explained by that UPD
transcripts are not present in our EST library or L. striatellus does not encode similar proteins. Considering that
many other insects whose genomes have been sequenced
(such as A. gambiae and B. mori) also lack UPD-like
genes, we believe that the JAK/STAT pathway of L. striatellus might be activated by sensing ligands that differ
from UPD of D. melanogaster.

c. This indicates that although there are significant matches, but it is hard to determine the preferred one since these matched proteins are
highly similar in predicted secondary structure.

Putative Imd pathway proteins

The Imd pathway regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes by perception of signals from
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such
as the diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan of
Gram-negative bacteria [35]. The Imd pathway can be
activated through peptidoglycan recognition proteins
PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE [36]. After receiving signals

from PAMPs, these receptors drive the activation of a
critical NF-κB-like transcription factor Relish (Rel)
through a complicated signaling cascade that consists of
IMD, dTAK1, dTAB2, IKKγ, IKKβ, ird5, and dFADD proteins to modulate AMP gene expression [37]. Studies
revealed that mutations in several Imd pathway genes,
including PGRP-LC, Tak1, ird5, key, and rel genes (but
not imd and dFADD), resulted in high levels of suscepti-

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:303
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/303

bility to viral infection in D. melanogaster [38,39]. Moreover, the mammalian tumor necrosis factor receptor
(TNFR) pathway, which is the counterpart of the insect
Imd pathway, has long been known to regulate the
immune response to viral infections [40]. These results
indicated that a branch of the Imd pathway is also
required in defense against viruses. Interestingly, recent
genomic annotation of pea aphid (A. pisum), a close relative of L. striatellus in phylogeny, revealed that this insect
lacks the principal Imd, dFADD, Dredd, Relish and even
PGRP proteins [41]. In the EST libraries of L. striatellus,
homologs of Imd pathway gene transcripts, including
Imd, TAB2, DIAP2, dFADD, and NF-κB like protein Relish, were identified, but it is noticeable that the homologs
of Imd, Relish and dFADD have a relatively lower
matched score (Table 3). In addition, the PGRP-like proteins are present in the EST libraries, which is different
from that of the A. pisum (Table 3). Furthermore,
although there are a number of matched targets that are
similar to protein kinases TAK1, IKKγ, and IKKβ, it is
hard to separate these transcripts from other kind of
kinases because their predicted secondary structures (by
pfam search, e < 0.1) are quite similar. In addition, we
failed to identify a homolog of the Dredd caspase (Table
3). Taken the above information together, we suppose
that the Imd pathway of L. striatellus, if it exists, is different from that of D. melanogaster and A. pisum. It will be
interesting to determine whether this genetically differentiated immune pathway also has an association in
defending RSV infection.
Comparative analyses of EST libraries

There were 15,746 and 14,318 unigenes specifically identified in viruliferous and naïve EST databases, respectively (Table 1). However, due to the non-saturated nature
of our EST databases and the relatively short average unigene length derived from pyrosequencing, these specific
sequences cannot be a reliable representation of the transcriptional differences between the different samples.
Therefore, we compared the differences in transcript
abundance between viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus.
Additional file 4 lists the top 30 contigs that are more
abundant in the viruliferous sample. Although care must
be taken in draw the conclusion that highly abundant
ESTs play critical roles in symbiosis with RSV, the analysis provided a candidate gene list to further investigate
the molecular basis of L. striatellus - RSV interactions.
It is interesting to note that transcripts encoding vitellogenin are the most abundant in the viruliferous insect
sample (Additional file 4). We then retrieved all 34 unigenes of L. striatellus encoding vitellogenin and mapped
them onto their ortholog (BAF75351.1) of brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) by BlastX. The protein
products of these unigenes have overlapped regions and a

Page 9 of 13

plenty of single nucleotide polymorphism were identified
within these regions, indicating that L. striatellus contains multiple copies of vitellogenin genes. Vitellogenin is
an egg yolk precursor for lipoproteins and phosphoproteins that is expressed in female insects. The protein is
synthesized extraovarially in the fat body, transported
through the hemolymph, and eventually internalized by
competent oocytes through membrane-bound receptors
named vitellogenin/lipophorin receptors [42]. Thus, it
was suggested that the vitellogenin traffic pathway might
be exploited by viruses to overcome the physical barrier
between follicle cells and oocytes [43]. In fact, in D. melanogaster, it has been observed that when genes responsible for endosomal trafficking of vitellogenin from the
follicle cells to the oocyte were mutated, the transport of
retrovirus ZAM viral particles from follicle cells to
oocytes was arrested. This result strongly supported the
hypothesis that ZAM uses the vitellogenin traffic pathway to gain access to the oocyte to affect the maternal
germ line [44]. Similarly, the extraordinary abundance of
vitellogenin transcripts in viruliferous L. striatellus EST
library suggested that RSV might modulate the host vitellogenin pathway genes to facilitate its persistent transmission via the insect ovum.
Expression profiling by RT-PCR

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to confirm
the expression of 52 selected contigs of L. striatellus.
Most of these unigenes are selected because they exhibited high abundance in the EST library of viruliferous
samples. A non-structural protein gene (Contig12404)
that was supposed to be encoded by Himetobi P virus,
another virus being reported to infect L. striatellus, was
also included. The results of amplification showed that 45
of the transcripts (Additional file 5) are indeed expressed
in both viruliferous and naïve L. striatellus (Fig. 4), demonstrating that they are not sequencing artifacts. This
strongly supports the view that the parallel sequencing
technique is a quick and highly effective approach for
investigating the transcriptome of poorly-understand
organisms.
Among successfully amplified contigs, 18 candidate
genes showed reproducibly up-regulated expression patterns in viruliferous insects (Fig. 4), including genes
encoding transferrin (Contig3086 and Contig6985), ribosomal protein L4 (Contig2551), ribosomal protein L15
(Contig5503), G-protein (Contig1243), malic enzyme
(Contig7591), ATP-citrate synthase (Contig2280), and
mitochondrial ATP synthase alpha subunit (Contig2413).
The expression patterns are in accordance with the reads
abundance of pyrosequencing, suggesting that these
genes are indeed upregulated in viruliferous L. striatellus.
Before in-depth functional study being carried out, how
did these genes relate to symbiosis with RSV remains illu-

sive. For example, it has been found that ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) is a subunit of NF-κB transcriptional
complexes in vertebrate. It forms a complex with NF-κB
subunit p65 and promotes the selective affinity of NF-κB
complexes for activating the expression of a group of
immune-related genes [45]. This implies that ribosomal
protein may be involved in regulating immune response
by protein-DNA interactions. Our RT-PCR assay confirmed that two ribosomal large-subunit proteins, L4 and
L15, were up-regulated in the viruliferous insects. The
two proteins have quite different secondary structures
compared with the RPS3 so that how they are involved in
innate immunity system of L. striatellus will be an opening question.
Both Contig3086 and Contig6985 encode transferrins.
Of them, there is no read of Contig6985 identified in the
naïve insect samples whereas 300 reads were found in the
viruliferous samples. Transferrins are glycoproteins that
bind iron ion with high affinity. These proteins often take
part in antibacterial response since they decrease the
concentration of available iron ions in the animal tissues
so that pathogenic bacteria can not grow and proliferate
because the starvation of iron. However, excess cellular
iron is also associated with increased infection rate for
viral diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) and hepatitis caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV)
[46]. Viruses can affect the expression of host proteins
involved in iron homeostasis and benefit from iron overload. For example, the HIV-1 Nef protein regulates the
localization of HFE, a host nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I protein that binds to
transferrin receptors. This process causes accumulation
of iron in macrophages [47]. In addition, if the concentration of cellular iron is low, the activity of iron-dependent
viral enzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductase, will be
decreased and then through negative impact on viral rep-

lication [48]. Based on this, it will be interesting to determine the functional role of these transferrin genes during
RSV infection and how they are up-regulated.

Conclusions
Understanding the molecular interactions between L.
striatellus and its symbiotic microbes is useful, not only
for studies on the biology of species relationships, but
also for agricultural practice that aims to develop effective strategies to prevent viral disease via controlling vector insects. However, these studies have been hampered
by the lack of genomic resources of L. striatellus. Here,
we employed the massively parallel pyrosequencing technique to collect ESTs from viruliferous and naïve samples
of L. striatellus. When these ESTs were combined, 16,885
contigs and 24,607 singletons were generated, of which
about 16.6% can be assigned a biological function. This
genome-scale transcriptional information provides a
basis for further investigation of the biology of L. striatellus. For example, we annotated a set of putative innate
immunity regulatory genes that are similar to those of
well-defined insects, including RNAi, JAK/STAT, and
Imd pathways genes. This result will facilitate future
studies on investigating the immune response of L. striatellus to microbial attack. Transcripts from RSV, the
endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia and the yeast-like
symbiotes were identified from our EST libraries. Functional annotation of these genes indicates that microbial
processes, such as suppressor activity, de novo biosynthesis of cofactors, as well as molecule transportation, are
critical for their survival in cells of L. striatellus. In addition, comparative genomic analysis advanced a repertoire
of candidate genes that might be involved in the L. striatellus - RSV interaction. At present we are using more
precise methods to investigate the functional roles of
these candidate genes during RSV infection and transmission.

Insect rearing and RNA isolation

The culture of L. striatellus used in this study was collected from Jiangsu Province, China, and was maintained
in laboratory for nearly six years. Both viruliferous and
naïve L. striatellus were reared separately in glass beakers
as stock populations. Rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare)
plants were used as the planthoppers' diet throughout
this experiment. Plants were grown in soil at 25°C under a
long day photoperiod of 16 h under light and 8 h under
dark in a growth incubator. The beakers were enclosed
with a piece of nylon mesh after insects had been introduced into 2-3 cm high rice seedlings. The planthoppers
were transferred to fresh seedlings every 10 - 14 days to
assure sufficient nutrition.

Zhang et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:303
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/303

For each sample, approximately 300 insect individuals
were used for RNA extraction. The insects were anesthetized with ether and frozen with liquid nitrogen in mortars. Total RNA was isolated from whole bodies collected
from populations of viruliferous and naïve insect populations, respectively, following the standard protocol of
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The concentration and quality of total RNA were determined by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
cDNA library construction and sequencing

Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the two
RNA pools according to Ng' s full-length cDNA synthesis
protocol [49] with modifications. A GsuI-oligo dT primer
was used to prime first-strand cDNA synthesis from 20
μg of mRNA, using 1,000 units of Superscript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). The diol group of the CAP
structure of mRNA was then oxidized by NaIO4, followed by biotinylation with biotin hydrazide (long arm,
Vector Laboratories). After RNaseONE digestion, Dynal
M280 streptavidin Dynabeads were used to select biotinylated RNA/cDNA. The first-strand cDNA was then
released by alkaline hydrolysis, and two 5' adaptors (N5
and N6 adaptors) were ligated to the 5'-end of the firststrand cDNA. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized
by primer extension using Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa).
The polyA tail was removed by GsuI digestion, and
cDNA size fractionation was performed using a cDNA
size fractionation column (Invitrogen). Each cDNA fraction larger than 800 bp was sonicated to the range of 300800 bp, and then pooled together with the other cDNA
samples ranging from 300 bp to 800 bp. The prepared
cDNAs were transformed into single-stranded template
DNA (sstDNA) libraries by using the GS DNA Library
Preparation kit (Roche Applied Science). sstDNA libraries were clonally amplified in a bead-immobilized form
by using the GS emPCR kit (Roche Applied Science) and
sequenced on the 454 Genome Sequencer FLX instrument.
EST analyses and assembly

The 454 sequencing reads were filtered by an in-house
developed program to remove 5' adaptor sequences and
low quality reads. The qualified reads were then assembled by CAP3 [50] using default parameters. Two kinds of
assembly method were used: (1) assembly of the viruliferous and naïve read libraries, separately; (2) combining the
viruliferous and naïve reads and assembly of all reads as
one library. A cluster containing ≥ 2 ESTs was named as a
contig and those containing only one sequence were
termed as singletons. The contigs and singletons were
generally referred to as unigenes.

Page 11 of 13

Gene annotation

After assembly, the unigene sequences (contigs and singletons) were subjected to BlastX similarity search
against NCBI-NR non-redundant protein database. The
parameters were set to: amino acid substitution matrix
BLOSUM62, a statistical significance threshold of 10 for
similarity matches, and costs to open an alignment gap
and extend a gap of 11 and 1, respectively. Furthermore,
to compare our results with other arthropods, additional
searches (BlastX) were also performed against putative
proteomes of 11 arthropod species whose genomes are in
draft or completed, including Acyrthosiphon pisum,
Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Bombyx mori, Culex pipiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Ixodes
scapularis, Nasonia vitripennis, Pediculus humanus, and
Tribolium castaneum. For prediction of the secondary
structure of proteins, the pfam database was searched
using HMMER 2.0 program. For Gene Ontology (GO)
analysis, outputs of the results from BlastX search against
Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL databases (e-value ≤ 10-3) were combined. Non-redundant matches were then functionally
annotated with GO terminology using Go-Diff [51]. For
identification of microsatellite markers that can be used
in genetic mapping and population genetics, SciRoKo
v3.4 software was used to search 41,492 unigenes generated from the combined EST library. Searches were carried out to identify both perfect and interrupted (≤ 2 bp
mismatch) motifs, with a minimum number of repeat
unit of six.
Expression profiling by semi-quantitative RT-PCR

To verify the results of pyrosequencing of the ESTs of L.
striatellus, we selected a total of 50 unigenes for RTPCR profiling. Total RNAs from viruliferous and naïve
samples were treated with RNase-free DNase I
(TaKaRa), and about 2 μg of total RNA of each sample
was reverse-transcribed by SuperScript™ III Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) as primer.
The PCR was carried out using the following thermal
cycling profile: 95°C for 4 min, followed by 20-25 cycles
of amplification (95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and
72°C for 45 sec), and 72°C for 10 min. Primers were
designed based on contig sequences generated from
ESTs of the same cluster (Additional file 6). The PCR
products and their sizes were examined using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide
staining. The elongation factor 2 (EF2) gene of L. striatellus was amplified as an endogenous loading control
for testing the validity of template preparation. The
expression of each gene was confirmed in at least two
rounds of independent RT-PCR reactions.
