Abstract
Background: Trofile® is the prospectively validated HIV-1 tropism assay. Its use is limited by high costs, long turnaround time, and inability to test patients with very low or undetectable viremia. We aimed at assessing the efficiency
of population genotypic assays based on gp120 V3-loop sequencing for the determination of tropism in plasma viral
RNA and in whole-blood viral DNA. Contemporary and follow-up plasma and whole-blood samples from patients
undergoing tropism testing via the enhanced sensitivity Trofile® (ESTA) were collected. Clinical and clonal
geno2pheno[coreceptor] (G2P) models at 10% and at optimised 5.7% false positive rate cutoff were evaluated using viral
DNA and RNA samples, compared against each other and ESTA, using Cohen's kappa, phylogenetic analysis, and area
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC).
Results: Both clinical and clonal G2P (with different false positive rates) showed good performances in predicting the
ESTA outcome (for V3 RNA-based clinical G2P at 10% false positive rate AUROC = 0.83, sensitivity = 90%, specificity =
75%). The rate of agreement between DNA- and RNA-based clinical G2P was fair (kappa = 0.74, p < 0.0001), and DNAbased clinical G2P accurately predicted the plasma ESTA (AUROC = 0.86). Significant differences in the viral populations
were detected when comparing inter/intra patient diversity of viral DNA with RNA sequences.
Conclusions: Plasma HIV RNA or whole-blood HIV DNA V3-loop sequencing interpreted with clinical G2P is cheap and
can be a good surrogate for ESTA. Although there may be differences among viral RNA and DNA populations in the
same host, DNA-based G2P may be used as an indication of viral tropism in patients with undetectable plasma viremia.
Background
Maraviroc (MVC) is the first CCR5 antagonist approved
for the treatment of HIV-1 infection [1] following the
demonstration of its virological efficacy in treatmentexperienced patients [2,3]. There is reasonable expectation that MVC or other CCR5-antagonists can be even
better administered to treatment-naïve patients due to a
higher prevalence of CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 in this population as compared to more advanced patients [4]. Due
to the lack of virologic activity against CXCR4-tropic
(X4) virus [5], the administration of MVC is subject to the
verification of an R5 virus population in the candidate

patient. The enhanced sensitivity Trofile® assay (ESTA) is
the current gold standard phenotypic method for the
determination of co-receptor tropism for the replicating
viral population (i.e. plasma RNA), although other inhouse or commercial tests are available, some of which
use peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC DNA)
[6,7]. The drawbacks of any phenotypic test include high
costs, long turn-around time, and reduced efficiency in
patients with low viremia. For this reason, there is a
demand for a fast and cheap HIV-1 tropism assay to fully
exploit CCR5 antagonists as a treatment option in clinical
routine [8,9].
Given that most of the determinants of viral co-receptor tropism are based on polymorphisms of the third
hypervariable region (V3) of the gp120, an alternative to

the phenotypic approach is the usage of machine learning
tools based on viral genotypic information. So called insilico or virtual phenotype models may be indeed convenient for clinical practice due to the reduction of costs
and turn-around time. During the recent years, several
prediction models have been studied, from the first simple rule based on the polymorphisms at V3 codons 11
and 25, to the position specific scoring matrices (PSSM),
neural networks, support vector machines, random forests and logistic models [10-20]. Some of these studies
identified additional factors possibly impacting viral tropism, such as viral subtype and CD4 cell counts
[14,16,20]. Comparisons among genotypic and phenotypic tests have been carried out. The genotypic
geno2pheno[coreceptor] system [16] was compared with the
first generation Trofile® and the TRT phenotypic assays
[21], showing 86.5% and 79.7% concordance, respectively.
A study comparing the predictive performance of
geno2pheno[coreceptor], PSSM [12] and other methods
against the first-generation Trofile® assay, concluded that
current default implementations of co-receptor prediction algorithms were inadequate for predicting CXCR4
co-receptor usage in clinical samples, due to inability to
detect low-level X4 virus [22]. Another study found the
concordance among genotype-based predictors and firstgeneration Trofile® being as high as 91% [23]. Variable
performance of in-silico models was shown when considering non-B HIV-1 variants [24-26].
Concerning the clinical validation of phenotypic assays,
another recent work focused on the performance of the
Trofile® test in predicting the virological response to a
short-term maraviroc exposure in HIV-infected patients
[27]. Concomitantly, a few attempts to unveil mutational
patterns associated to selection by CCR5 antagonists or
resistance have been carried out [28,29], but the frequency and rate at which maraviroc resistance mutations
emerge are not yet known.
The most awaited information is how in-silico tropism
prediction models predict virological response to CCR5antagonists, particularly when genotypic and phenotypic
results disagree. In fact, although the ESTA should detect
lower amounts of X4 virus compared to bulk genotyping,
the X4 level threshold compromising in vivo CCR5antagonist activity in vivo is currently unknown. In addition, ESTA cannot be performed at low or undetectable
viral load (VL), while HIV-1 DNA genotyping can be easily performed in such cases; and this information, if adequately validated, might be easily employed for guiding
treatment switches to CCR5 antagonists in virologically
suppressed patients, due to toxicity or simplification
issues. Finally, genotyping can also be used to detect HIV1 mutations selected by MVC and possibly decreasing its

effectiveness. Our study aimed at evaluating the accuracy
of HIV-1 co-receptor tropism prediction by viral RNA
and DNA genotyping, as well as the selection of V3
mutants in MVC-failing individuals.

Methods
Patients

Contemporary plasma and whole-blood samples were
prospectively collected from HIV-infected patients followed up at a single centre of the Infectious Diseases
Clinic of Catholic University of Sacred Heart in Rome,
Italy, all failing antiretroviral treatment and potentially
candidates for treatment with a CCR5-antagonists, in the
period between November 2007 and July 2009 (n = 55).
Some of these patients underwent tropism testing via the
ESTA (n = 51). Follow-up plasma and whole-blood samples from these patients were also collected, regardless of
MVC treatment.
Viral amplification and sequencing

Plasma RNA and whole-blood DNA were obtained from
citrated blood by spin column extraction (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Plasma underwent 1-hour centrifugation at 23,000 x g at 4°C to concentrate virus prior to
extraction. Whole blood was used without pre-processing steps. A 419-bp region encompassing the HIV-1
gp120 V3 domain was amplified by (RT)-PCR and
sequenced in both strands by infrared-labelled primers
on a Licor IR2 system. Plasma RNA was reverse transcribed with primer P151 (5'-CTACTTTATATTTATATAATTCAYTTCTC-3', coordinates 7661-7689 in
the reference HXB2 genome). The reverse transcription
reaction was run for 30 minutes at 37°C and included 10
μL of RNA extract, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 25°C), 75
mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 3 mM MgCl2, 200μM each dNTP,
200 U ImProm II RT (Promega), 20 U RNasin (Promega)
and 5 pmol primer P151. The cDNA obtained (one third
of the reverse transcription mixture) or blood DNA (1 μg)
extracted from whole-blood was amplified by a nested
PCR protocol using primer P150 (5'-AATGTCAGCACAGTACAATGYACACAT-3', 6945-6971) and P151 in
the outer amplification step and primer LR33 (5'-CAGTACAATGTACACATGGAAT-3', 6955-6976) and LR34
(5'-GAAAAATTCCCCTCCACAATT-3', 7353-7373) in
the inner amplification step. Both outer and inner PCR
mixtures contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25°C), 50
mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 200 μM each dNTP, 1.25 U
GoTaq polymerase (Promega) and 8 pmol each primer.
The cycling profile was 20 seconds at 52°C, 40 seconds at
72°C and 30 seconds at 94°C for both steps but the number of cycles was 25 in the outer PCR and 32 in the inner
PCR. The final product was sequenced by the IRD700-

Prosperi et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:56

labelled sense primer IR25 (5'-GCTGTTAAATGGCAGTCTAGCAGAA-3', 7011-7035) and the IRD800labelled antisense primer IR77 (5'-GAAAAATTCTCCTCYACAATTRA-3', 7351-7373) using the DYEnamic
Direct Cycle Sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP (GE
Healthcare). Sequence contigs were assembled by the
DNASTAR SeqMan II version 5.07 module. Only one
PCR product per sample was subjected to standard population sequencing, expected to allow detection of minority species contributing at least 20% of the whole virus
quasispecies.
Sequence analysis: tropism prediction and its evaluation

The geno2pheno[coreceptor] in-silico genotypic tropism prediction system was employed, using both clinical (requiring VL, nadir CD4 and CD8 count) and clonal
interpretations at 10% false positive rate (FPR) [17], and
by considering a clonal interpretation at the optimised
cutoff of 5.75% FPR, based on analysis of clinical data
from MOTIVATE and MERIT studies [30,31]. Concordances among geno2pheno predictors and ESTA were
assessed by Cohen's kappa statistic [32]. The predictive
ability of the systems was evaluated by receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis [33,34].
The distance between nucleotide V3 sequences was calculated by the maximum composite likelihood [35], over
a multiple alignment obtained via MUSCLE [36]. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the MEGA 4 software [37], estimating tree and branch support with a
bootstrapped neighbour-joining method.
Analysis of selection of env mutations by MVC exposure was performed by considering patients with a RNA
sequence before (the closest to the start date) and after
(considering the latest after at least one month of therapy) MVC initiation. Amino acid mutations were
extracted by local pairwise alignments against the HXB2
reference sequence. Fisher's exact test on frequency
counts of individual mutations and pre- post-MVC strata
was executed; obtained p-values were also corrected with
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
The R mathematical programming suite was used to
perform all statistical analyses [38].

Results
Study population and samples

We processed 178 samples (99 plasma RNA and 79
whole-blood DNA) and successfully amplified 155 samples [78 (78.8%) plasma RNA and 77 (97.5%) whole-blood
DNA] from 55 patients. By stratifying for contemporary
VL, the rate of successful sequencing from RNA was 40%,
88.2%, and 96.2% at < = 50 cp/ml, 51-500 cp/ml, and >500
cp/ml respectively. The rate of successful sequencing
from DNA was 95.1%, 100%, and 100% at < = 50 cp/ml,
50-500 cp/ml, and >500 cp/ml, respectively.

Fifty-one of the 55 patients had their baseline plasma
tested by ESTA, and 28 were subsequently administered
MVC. Patients' baseline characteristics are summarized
in Table 1.
In a cross sectional crude analysis, using dichotomized
ESTA results (R5-tropic versus X4- plus dual/mixedtropic), we did not find any significant association with
contemporary patients characteristics, except for the
time from HIV-1 diagnosis [median (IQR) 16 years (1318) for R5, and 18 years (17-22) for X4 or dual/mixedtropic isolates p = 0.007], and nadir CD4 count [median
(IQR) 138 cells/mm3 (31-200) for R5 and 14 cells/mm3
(6-41) for X4 or dual/mixed-tropic isolates p = 0.05].
Comparison between geno2pheno[coreceptor] classification of
plasma HIV-1 RNA, DNA V3 sequences and ESTA tropism
results

We first compared the prediction performance of
geno2pheno versus the ESTA result. For this analysis, we
excluded samples not reportable by ESTA. To match
geno2pheno categories, the dual/mixed virus classification by ESTA was pooled with the X4 virus classification.
Figure 1 depicts ROC plots with the performance of two
RNA-based geno2pheno models predicting the ESTA X4
or dual/mixed tropism. Using nucleotide V3 loop
sequences obtained from RNA samples contemporary to
ESTA testing (n = 35), the resulting area under the ROC
curve (AUROC) was 0.83 for geno2pheno clinical interpretation, 0.67 for geno2pheno clonal interpretation at
10% FPR, and 0.75 using the optimised 5.75% FPR cutoff.
When comparing differences in AUROC with respect to
the clinical interpretation reference, neither the clonal
interpretation at 10% FPR nor that at 5.75% FPR cutoff
exhibited a statistically significant lower area (p = 0.17
and p = 0.48, respectively).
As a second performance test, we obtained
geno2pheno tropism predictions for V3 sequences
obtained from DNA samples (n = 17, with 16 sequences
from patients with contemporary RNA genotyping). The
resulting prediction of ESTA X4-D/M tropism showed an
AUROC of 0.86 using geno2pheno clinical interpretation,
0.69 using the geno2pheno clonal interpretation at 10%
FPR, and 0.76 using the optimised 5.75% FPR cutoff (Figure 2). We did not find significant differences in AUROC
when comparing either the clonal interpretation (p =
0.34) at 10% FPR or that at 5.75% FPR cutoff (p = 0.58)
against the clinical geno2pheno interpretation at 10%
FPR.
Table 2 shows accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the
clinical, and clonal interpretation at 10% or 5.75% FPR
cutoff of RNA/DNA geno2pheno interpretation modes in
predicting ESTA X4-D/M-tropism.

Comparison of HIV-1 V3 RNA and DNA sequence
population and their inferred coreceptor tropisms

The median intrapatient distance among HIV RNA or
DNA sequences was, as expected, significantly smaller
than the interpatient distance (see Additional files 1 and
2). However, the intrapatient variability with RNA (0.007)
or with DNA (0.015) sequences was significantly lower
than the intrapatient variability between RNA and DNA
sequences (0.023), suggesting that the HIV-1 V3 DNA
and RNA populations may contribute different information and complement each other in a patient. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that clusters of sequences with
high support values (bootstrap >90%) corresponded to
sequences drawn from the same patients, and there were
no clusters composed of sequences from different
patients. Clusters were preferentially (but not exclusively)
composed of either paired RNA or DNA samples (phylogenetic tree is available as Additional file 1).
We next investigated whether a certain degree of intrapatient diversity between DNA and RNA populations
results in a different co-receptor tropism prediction.
When comparing geno2pheno clinical interpretation
based on paired HIV-1 V3 DNA-RNA sequences
obtained from 29 distinct patients, we observed 35/40
(87.5%) concordant predictions, 3/40 (7.5%) false positives, and 2/40 (5%) false negatives, using RNA-predicted
X4-tropism as the reference outcome. The kappa statistics yielded a strength of agreement of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.530.95), with a Fisher's p-value < 0.0001. The AUROC
obtained by predicting the geno2pheno RNA tropism
from contemporary DNA sequences was 0.875.
Viro-immunological follow up

Out of 28 patients with an R5-tropic virus by ESTA subsequently starting MVC, 22 had an available virological
follow up at 12 weeks. All patients had a VL below 50 cp/
ml, except two patients with 120 and 292 cp/ml. Virological follow-up at 24 weeks was available for 19 patients. All
of these had a VL below 50 cp/ml, except two patients
(different from those at three months) with a VL of 2,003
and 88 cp/ml.
Immunological follow-up at 12 weeks was available for
20 out of the 28 patients that started MVC. The median

(IQR) CD4 increase was 84 (range -9 to 165) cells/mm3.
A Wilcoxon test showed that this increase from baseline
was statistically significant (p = 0.019). After 24 weeks of
therapy, immunological follow-up was available for 19
patients. The median (IQR) CD4 increase was 46 (-9 to
143) cells/mm3(p = 0.053).
Evolution of V3 sequences during MVC therapy

Finally, we executed statistical tests for difference in proportions by looking at the whole set of mutations
retrieved in the RNA samples with respect to HIV-1
HXB2 envelope reference, grouping sequences in preand post-MVC initiation (n = 18, 9 sequences pre-MVC,
9 post-MVC). Of the 9 pre-MVC sequences (all R5 by
ESTA), 4 (44%) were classified as X4 by clinical
geno2pheno interpretation, with FPR of 4.8%, 7.8%, 0.2%,
and 0.8%. Tropism prediction did not change for any
patient when considering post-MVC samples. No substitution was significantly associated with MVC exposure
by correcting test statistics with Benjamini Hochberg (all
p-values = 1) nor retaining raw unadjusted p-values;
nonetheless a deletion at position 354, mutation 355K,
369L, and 259Q (all in the V3 loop) showed an increase in
prevalence after MVC initiation. Figure 3 depicts mutations detected in the V3 loop in pre- and post-MVC samples with the lowest unadjusted p-values.

Discussion
In the present study, viral tropism prediction by the HIV1 gp120 V3-loop RNA genotype-based geno2pheno[coreceptor] interpretation in treatment-experienced subjects
proved to be a valid alternative to ESTA tropism, yielding
an AUROC of 0.83 using the clinical interpretation. The
clonal interpretation showed a lower AUROC, although
the difference with the clinical interpretation showed
only a trend, probably due to the limited sample size. The
geno2pheno[coreceptor] website suggests that only the clonal
interpretation should be used for treatment-experienced
patients, since the clinical system was trained only on
treatment-naïve patients. However, our results show that
the clinical interpretation is better (at least not inferior)
than the clonal interpretation even in treatment-experienced patients. It is important to highlight the fact that

the clinical interpretation needs contemporary VL, nadir
CD4 and CD8 information in order to work properly.
Interestingly, the clinical mode improved sensitivity
much more than specificity with respect to the clonal
mode. The sensitivity of V3 RNA genotyping followed by
clonal geno2pheno[coreceptor] interpretation has been
recently shown to increase by testing multiple aliquots of
the plasma RNA extract [39], likely as a consequence of
stochastic fluctuations of a minority X4 populations.
Although repeated testing has not yet been established as
a standard procedure, it is expected that its implementation would result in a higher concordance between tro-

pism results obtained by V3 genotyping and the reference
ESTA.
Another area under investigation is the optimal FPR to
use with geno2pheno[coreceptor] as a cut-off for classification of R5 and X4-D/M viruses. Recent retrospective
analysis of the MERIT trial data indicated that the most
accurate FPR cutoff may be in the range from 2% to
5.75%, when triplicate PCR testing and fully automated
sequencing is used [30]. However, there is currently no
consensus on which cut-off to use in clinical practice. As
for any classification test aimed at orienting a clinical
intervention, the trade-off between specificity and sensi-

tivity must be taken into account. A higher cut-off such as
the 10% FPR was originally proposed [17] and is still recommended by the expert panel developing and maintaining the geno2pheno[coreceptor] system (see the German
recommendations [40]). Using a higher cut-off translates
into a conservative attitude, i.e. a lower probability to
treat with maraviroc patients who may not benefit from
it, at the expense of a higher probability not to treat
patients who may benefit from the drug. It remains to be
established whether this lower cut-off can be clinically
more convenient in the genotypic screening of the gen-

eral HIV patient population candidate to treatment with
maraviroc.
One major advantage with genotyping is that even
patients with non-reportable ESTA can be given prediction of tropism. By definition, ESTA is subject to a larger
proportion of failures with respect to genotype due to
virus polymorphisms invalidating the cloning procedure
and an inherently lower rate of reverse transcription of a
far larger virus genome region. Moreover, our efficiency
of RNA genotyping at VL between 50 and 500 cp/ml
(where ESTA is not even attempted) was 88%, whilst that
of DNA genotyping was 100% at these viral loads.

Interestingly, in-silico tropism prediction using wholeblood DNA genotyping may be a solution when considering treatment switch to a CCR5-antagonists for patients
with undetectable viral load. The perspective for treatment switches in these patients may be attractive,
because of the good tolerability of MVC and because
patients that are not at a late stage of disease are more
likely to harbour a CCR5- rather than a CXCR4-tropic
virus [4]. In these cases ESTA cannot be used, and RNA
genotyping is often not sufficiently efficient. The performance of DNA-based clinical geno2pheno in predicting
the ESTA result was comparable to that of RNA-based
clinical geno2pheno (AUROC = 0.86). Thus, the use of
V3 DNA sequence data for predicting co-receptor tropism definitely warrants further investigation as an
appealing alternative to RNA.
As expected, we found some differences when comparing paired DNA and RNA sequences, consistent with the
notion that the archived population may not correspond
to the most prevalent virus in plasma, whose source are
the productively infected cells. However, when comparing DNA and RNA tropism prediction by looking at contemporary samples, the degree of agreement was good,
implying that such minor differences may not commonly
translate into inappropriate indications. It remains to be
established whether an X4 virus population detected in
PBMC DNA in the context of R5 virus in plasma RNA
can impair response to maraviroc. Although reported on
a limited number of cases, this did not appear to be the
case in the French GenoTropism study [41,42].

Conclusion
HIV-1 tropism determination via plasma viral V3 RNA
genotyping coupled with geno2pheno interpretation may
represent a valid alternative to ESTA. The clinical validation of genotypic determination of viral tropism has been
recently performed using retrospective samples from the
MOTIVATE study [40] as well as in the GenoTropism
study where the genotypic tropism test was able to predict response to maraviroc even in the group of patients
with an R5 virus population as detected by standard Trofile® [41,42]. As shown here, RNA tropism genotyping carries the advantage of a higher efficiency of tropism
determination in patients with low copy number detectable viral loads. In addition to that, in perspective, DNAbased tropism prediction could be used in patients with
undetectable VL who are candidates for treatment simplification/switch to a CCR5-antagonist. This option can
support a more effective use of this class of agents at earlier stages when the probability of harbouring an R5 virus
population is maximal. However, further investigations to
unveil the evolutionary relationships between DNA and
RNA populations are advisable before DNA genotyping
can be indicated in clinical practice. In this context, ultradeep sequencing studies may be appropriate to dissect
the dynamics and role of DNA and RNA minority variants [43,44]. Most importantly, clinical validation of the
use of HIV-1 genotyping, particularly with proviral DNA,
for tropism assignment is also required before its widespread implementation.

Figure 3 Prevalence of mutations (with respect to HIV-1 HXB2) in the V3 loop from RNA samples, stratified by MVC exposure (n = 18, 9 sequences pre-MVC, 9 post-MVC). Mutations are shown in decreasing order by unadjusted p-value obtained from a Fisher's test comparing
pre- vs. post-MVC prevalence

Additional material
Additional file 1 Evolutionary relationships of 155 V3 sequences
obtained from 51 patients at different time points joining RNA and
DNA samples + 1 outgroup (HIV-1 group J, V3 loop). Sequences are
labelled by DNA/RNA type, by sampling date (the number before the type),
and by patient's identifier (first one or two numbers). When considering all
the 155 viral DNA/RNA V3 sequences obtained from all the 55 patients, the
median (IQR) distance among all samples was 0.126 (0.101-0.159). The
median (IQR) interpatient RNA-RNA distance was 0.133 (0.110-0.166) (n =
2,946 pairs) and DNA-DNA (n = 2,874) distance was 0.121 (0.095-0.152). The
median (IQR) intrapatient RNA-RNA (n = 56), DNA-DNA (n = 52) and paired
RNA-DNA (n = 120) distances were 0.007 (0.000-0.017), 0.015 (0.007-0.031)
and 0.023 (0.015-0.031), respectively, with a Kruskal's p-value < 0.0001.
