Results: Around 300 candidate defense proteins are identified based on sequence similarity to
homologs known to participate in immune responses. In most cases, paralog counts are lower than
those of Drosophila melanogaster or Anopheles gambiae but are substantially higher than those of Apis
mellifera. The genome contains probable orthologs for nearly all members of the Toll, IMD, and
JAK/STAT pathways. While total numbers of the clip-domain serine proteinases are approximately
equal in the fly (29), mosquito (32) and beetle (30), lineage-specific expansion of the family is
discovered in all three species. Sixteen of the thirty-one serpin genes form a large cluster in a 50
kb region that resulted from extensive gene duplications. Among the nine Toll-like proteins, four
are orthologous to Drosophila Toll. The presence of scavenger receptors and other related proteins
indicates a role of cellular responses in the entire system. The structures of some antimicrobial
peptides drastically differ from those in other orders of insects.

Background: Tribolium castaneum is a species of Coleoptera, the largest and most diverse order
of all eukaryotes. Components of the innate immune system are hardly known in this insect, which
is in a key phylogenetic position to inform us about genetic innovations accompanying the evolution
of holometabolous insects. We have annotated immunity-related genes and compared them with
homologous molecules from other species.

Conclusion: A framework of information on Tribolium immunity is established, which may serve
as a stepping stone for future genetic analyses of defense responses in a nondrosophiline genetic
model insect.

Tribolium beetles harbor a range of natural pathogens and
parasites, from bacteria to fungi, microsporidians and tapeworms [1,2]. There is good evidence for genetic variation in

resistance to the tapeworm and a linked cost of resistance in
terms of growth and reproduction [3]. Cross-generational
transfer of immune traits [4] may occur in Tenebrio molitor,
a close relative of Tribolium castaneum. RNA interference

experiments demonstrate that Tribolium laccase-2 is responsible for cuticle pigmentation and sclerotization [5]. While
these observations are interesting, our knowledge of the
genetic constituents of Tribolium immunity is almost blank at
the cellular and molecular levels, in contrast to the vast
amount of information regarding Drosophila melanogaster
and Anopheles gambiae defense responses [6,7]. Given the
high efficiency of RNA interference and powerful tools of
molecular genetics [8], it is particularly appealing to use T.
castaneum for the dissection of insect immune pathways.
Acquired knowledge may be useful in controlling beetle pests
that feed on crop plants or stored products.
In the broader field of beetle immunity, research has been
focused mainly on two effector mechanisms, namely antimicrobial peptide synthesis and prophenoloxidase (proPO) activation [9]. Defensins, coleoptericins, cecropin and antifungal
peptides have been isolated from coleopteran insects and
characterized biochemically [10-12]. A homolog of human
NF-κB (Allomyrina dichotoma Rel A) up-regulates the transcription of a coleoptericin gene [13]. Active phenoloxidase
generates quinones for melanin formation, wound healing,
and microbe killing. ProPO activation has been investigated
in Holotrichia diomphalia [14-16]. ProPO activating factor 1
(Hd-PPAF1) cleaves proPO to generate active phenoloxidase
in the presence of Hd-PPAF2, the precursor of which is activated by Hd-PPAF3 via limited proteolysis. While all these
PPAFs contain an amino-terminal clip domain, PPAF2 (in
contrast to PPAF1 or PPAF3) does not have catalytic activity
since its carboxy-terminal serine proteinase-like domain
lacks the active site serine. A 43 kDa inhibitor down-regulates
the melanization response in H. diomphalia [17].
To date, components of the innate immune system are hardly
known in T. castaneum and neither is it clear how they differ
from homologous molecules in the honeybee, mosquito or
fruitfly [6,7,18]. This lack of knowledge does not seem to reconcile with the critical phylogenetic position of this coleopteran species, which should inform us a lot about genetic
variations in the evolution of holometabolous insects. Information regarding defense responses in T. castaneum, a member of the largest and most diverse order of eukaryotes, is
highly desirable for the biological control of crop pests and
disease vectors. Consequently, we have used its newly available genome assembly to annotate immunity-related genes
and analyze their phylogenetic relationships with homologous sequences from other insects. In this comparative overview of the Tribolium defense system, we describe plausible
immune pathway models and present information regarding
the molecular evolution of innate immunity in holometabolous species.

Results and discussion
Overview of the Tribolium immune system
T. castaneum has a sizable repertoire of immune proteins
predicted to participate in various humoral and cellular
responses against wounding or infection (Additional data file
1). Like other insects [6,7,19], cuticle and epithelia lining its
body surfaces, tracheae and alimentary tract may serve as a
physiochemical barrier and local molecular defense by producing antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen/nitrogen
species (ROS/RNS). While this line of defense may block
most pathogens, others enter the hemocoel where a coordinated acute-phase reaction could occur to immobilize and kill
the opportunists. This reaction, including phagocytosis,
encapsulation, coagulation and melanization, is probably
mediated by hemocytes and molecules constitutively present
in the circulation. These first responders may not only control
minor infections but also call fat body and hematopoietic tissues for secondary responses if necessary. At the molecular
level, the following events should take place in all insects,
including the beetle: recognition of invading organisms by
plasma proteins or cell surface receptors, extra- and intracellular signal transduction and modulation, transcriptional
regulation of immunity-related genes, as well as controlled
release of defense molecules.

Pathogen recognition
Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) serve as an
important surveillance mechanism for microbial infection by
binding to Lys- and diaminopimelate-type peptidoglycans of
walled bacteria [20]. Some Drosophila PGRPs (for example,
LC and SA) are responsible for cell-mediated or plasma-based
pathogen recognition; others (that is, LB and SB) may hydrolyze peptidoglycans to turn on/off immune responses [21,22].
In T. castaneum, PGRP-LA, -LC and -LD contain a transmembrane segment; PGRP-SA and -SB are probably
secreted; PGRP-LE (without a signal peptide or transmembrane region) may exist in cytoplasm or enter the plasma via
a nonclassical secretory pathway. Bootstrap analysis and
domain organization clearly indicate that Tribolium and Drosophila PGRP-LEs are orthologs - so far no PGRP-LE has
been identified in Anopheles, Bombyx or Apis. Other orthologous relationships (for example, TcPGRP-LC and AmPGRPLC) are also supported by the phylogenetic analysis (Figure
1). The beetle and mosquito PGRP-LA genes encode two alternative splice forms (PGRP-LAa and -LAb). Like Drosophila
and Anopheles, Tribolium PGRP-LA and -LC genes are next
to each other in the same cluster. Most of the beetle PGRPs
resulted from ancient family diversification that occurred
before the emergence of holometabolous insects. In contrast,
gene duplication occurred several times in the lineages of
mosquito and fly (Figure 1).
Multiple sequence alignment suggests that β-1,3-glucan-recognition proteins (β GRPs) and Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs) are descendents of invertebrate β-1,3glucanases [23]. Lacking one or more of the catalytic residues,

group that arose before the radiation of holometabolous
insects (Additional data file 2). Since Drosophila has no β
GRP-B and Anopheles has five, the presence of a single gene
(encoding Tc-β GRP1) in the beetle can be useful for elucidating function of this orthologous group. In addition to the glucanase-like domain, members of the second group contain an
amino-terminal extension of about 100 residues. In Bombyx

mori β GRP, this region recognizes β-1,3-glucan also [24]. M.
sexta β GRP2 binds to insoluble β-1,3-glucan and triggers a
serine proteinase cascade for proPO activation [25].
C-type lectins (CTLs) comprise a wide variety of soluble and
membrane-bound proteins that associate with carbohydrates
in a Ca2+-dependent manner [26]. Some insect CTLs recognize microorganisms and enhance their clearance by hemocytes [19]. Gene duplication and sequence divergence,
particularly in the sugar-interacting residues, lead to a broad
spectrum of binding specificities for mannose, galactose and
other sugar moieties. These proteins associate with microbes
and hemocytes to form nodules [27] and stimulate melanization response [28]. T. castaneum encodes sixteen CTLs: ten
(Tc-CTL1, 2, 4 through 10, and 13) with a single carbohydrate
recognition domain and one (Tc-CTL3) with two. Five other
proteins, tentatively named Tc-CTL11, 12, 14, 15 and 16, contain a CTL domain, a transmembrane region (except for TcCTL11), and other structural modules: CTL11 has three CUB
and three EGF; CTL12 has six Ig and three FN3; CTL14 has
one LDLrA, three CUB, ten Sushi, nineteen EGF, two discoidin, one laminin G and one hyalin repeat; CTL15 has one FTP,
eleven Sushi and two EFh; CTL16 has one FTP and four Sushi.
While lineage-specific expansion of the gene family is
remarkable in D. melanogaster and A. gambiae [29], we have
not found any evidence for that in T. castaneum (or A. mellifera): Tc-CTL1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12 through 16 have clear orthologs
in the other insect species whereas Tc-CTL7, 10 and 11 are
deeply rooted (Additional data file 3).
Galectins are β-galactoside recognition proteins with significant sequence similarity in their carbohydrate-binding sites
characteristic of the family. Drosophila DL1 binds to E. coli
and Erwinia chrysanthemi [30]. Leishmania uses a sandfly
galectin as a receptor for specific binding to the insect midgut
[31]. Tc-galectin1 has two carbohydrate recognition domains;
Tc-galectin2 and 3 are orthologous to Am-galectin1 and 2,
respectively (Additional data file 4).
All fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) contain a carboxyterminal fibrinogen-like domain associated with different
amino-terminal regions. In mammals, three classes of FREPs
have been identified: ficolin, tenascins, and microfibril-associated proteins [32]. They take part in phagocytosis, wound
repair, and cellular adhesion [33]. In invertebrates, FREPs
are involved in cell-cell interaction, bacterial recognition, and
antimicrobial responses [34-36]. The Tribolium genome contains seven FREP genes, which fall into three groups (Additional data file 5): the expansion of group I yielded four family
members: Tc-FREP1 through 4. Sitting next to each other on
chromosome 3, these beetle genes encode polypeptides most
similar to angiopoietin-like proteins. During angiogenesis,
the human plasma proteins interact with tyrosine kinase
receptors (for example, Tie) and lead to wound repair and tissue regeneration [37]. In group II, Tc-FREP5 is orthologous
to Dm-scabrous, which is required for Notch signaling during

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/8/R177

tissue differentiation [38]. Interestingly, Notch is also needed
for proper differentiation of Drosophila hemocytes [39].
Group III includes Tc-FREP6, Tc-FREP7, Ag-FREP9 and
Dm-CG9593. No major expansion has occurred in the beetle
or honeybee, in sharp contrast to the situations in the fly and
mosquitoes - there are 61 FREP genes in the A. gambiae
genome [29].
Thioester-containing proteins (TEPs), initially identified in
D. melanogaster [39], contain a sequence motif (GCGEQ)
commonly found in members of the complement C3/α 2macroglobulin superfamily. After cleavage activation, some
TEPs use the metastable thioester bond between the cysteine
and glutamine residues to covalently attach to pathogens and
'mark' them for clearance by phagocytosis [40]. One of the 15
TEPs in Anopheles, Ag-TEP1, plays a key role in the host
response against Plasmodium infection and ten other AgTEPs are results of extensive gene duplications. This kind of
family expansion did not happen in the beetle (or bee): Tribolium encodes four TEPs, perhaps for different physiological
purposes. Our phylogenetic analysis supports the following
orthologous relationships: TcA-AmA-Ag13-Dm6, TcB-AmBAg15-Dm3, and TcC-AmC (Additional data file 6).

Extracellular signal transduction and modulation
Similar to the alternative and lectin pathways for activation of
human complements, insect plasma factors play critical roles
in pathogen detection, signal relaying/tuning, and execution
mechanisms. Serine proteinases (SPs) and their noncatalytic
homologs (SPHs) are actively involved in these processes.
Some SPs are robust enzymes that hydrolyze dietary proteins;
others are delicate and specific - they cleave a single peptide
bond in the protein substrates. The latter interact among
themselves and with pathogen recognition proteins to mediate local responses against nonself. The specificity of such
molecular interactions could be enhanced by SPHs, adaptor
proteins that lack proteolytic activity due to substitution of
the catalytic triad residues. SPs and SPHs constitute one of
the largest protein families in insects [29,41,42]. We have
identified 103 SP genes and 65 SPH genes in the Tribolium
genome, 77 of which encode polypeptides with a SP or SP-like
domain and other structural modules. These include thirty
SPs and eighteen SPHs containing one or more regulatory
clip domains. Clip-domain SPs, and occasionally clip-domain
SPHs, act in the final steps of arthropod SP pathways [43].
Other recognition/regulation modules (for example, LDLrA,
Sushi, CUB and CTL) also exist in long SPs (>300 residues),
some of which act in the beginning steps of SP pathways.
T. castaneum clip-domain proteins are divided into four subfamilies (Figure 2). Even though the catalytic or proteinaselike domains used for comparison were similar in length and
sequence, we found subfamily A is composed of SPHs solely
whereas subfamilies B, C and D comprise SPs mainly. Apparently, it is easier for SPs to lose activity and become SPHs during evolution than for SPHs to regain catalytic activity. The

The IMD pathway is critical for fighting certain Gram-negative bacteria in Drosophila. Upon recognition of diaminopimelate-peptidoglycan by PGRPs, the 'danger' signal is
transduced into the cell through IMD (Figure 5b). IMD contains a death domain that recruits dFADD (dTAK1 activator)
and Dredd (a caspase). Active dTAK1 is a protein kinase that
triggers the JNK pathway (through Hep, Basket, Jra and Kay)
and Relish phosphorylation (through Ird5 and Kenny). The
presence of 1:1 orthologs in T. castaneum strongly suggests
that IMD-mediated immunity is conserved in the beetle. Furthermore, the modulation of these pathways may also resemble each other - we have identified putative 1:1 orthologs of
IAP2, Tab2 and caspar in the Tribolium genome (Figure 5b).

Phenoloxidases are copper-containing enzymes involved in
multiple steps of several immune responses against pathogens and parasites (that is, clot reinforcement, melanin formation, ROS/RNS generation, and microbe killing) [53].
Synthesized and released as an inactive zymogen, proPO
requires a SP cascade for its cleavage activation. SPHs and
serpins ensure that the proteolytic activation occurs locally
and transiently in response to infection. We have identified
three proPO genes in the Tribolium genome, designated
proPO1, 2 and 3. Tc-proPO2 and proPO3 are 98.8% identical

interactions

Execution mechanisms

refereed research

The transcription of Drosophila TEPs and some other
immune molecules is under the control of the JAK-STAT
pathway [52]. This pathway, triggered by a cytokine-like molecule, Upd3, promotes phagocytosis and participates in an
antiviral response. Based on sequence similarity, we predict
that the conserved signaling pathway in the beetle is composed of the orthologs of Dm-Domeless, Hopscotch and
STAT92 (Figure 5c). However, we have not identified any
ortholog of Dm-upd, upd2, or upd3, possibly due to high
sequence variation in the cytokine-like proteins.

deposited research

Drosophila Toll is a transmembrane protein that binds spätzle and relays developmental and immune signals [48].
Resulting from ancient family expansion, a total of five spätzle homologs and eight Toll-like receptors are present in the
fly. There are seven Tribolium genes coding for spätzle-like
proteins, most of which have putative orthologs in Drosophila and Anopheles (Additional data file 7). Like their ligands, Toll-like proteins have also experienced major family
expansion and sequence divergence. The receptors are separated into two clusters, with the fly and beetle Toll-9 located
near the tree center (Figure 4). While Toll-6, -7, -8 and -10
from different insect species constitute tight orthologous
groups in one cluster, lineage-specific gene duplications have
given rise to Drosophila Toll-3 and -4, Anopheles Toll-1 and 5, as well as Tribolium Toll-1 through -4. Located on the same
branch with Drosophila Toll, the four Tribolium receptors
could play different yet complementary roles in the beetle
defense and development. In addition, we have identified
eight MD2-related genes in the beetle. Mammalian MD2,
Toll-like receptor-4 and CD14 form a complex that recognizes
lipopolysaccharides [49]. The Anopheles MD2-like receptor

Contrary to the ligand-receptor diversification, components
of the intracellular pathway appear to be highly conserved in
insects studied so far (Figure 5a). In Drosophila, multimerization of Toll receptors caused by spätzle binding leads to the
association of dMyD88, Tube, Pelle, Pellino and dTRAF6
[51]. With 1:1 orthologs identified in the beetle (as well as the
other insects with known genomes), we postulate that a similar protein complex also forms to phosphorylate a cactus-like
molecule (Tc02003). The modified substrate protein then
dissociates from its partner (Tc07697 or Tc0896), allowing
the Rel transcription factors to translocate into the nucleus
and activate effector genes (for example, antimicrobial peptides). Functional tests are required to verify the suggested
roles of individual components during defense and development in the beetle.

reviews

Most members of the serpin superfamily are irreversible
inhibitors of SPs and, by forming covalent complexes with
diffusing proteinases, they ensure a transient, focused
defense response [47]. There are totally 31 serpin genes in T.
castaneum, more than that in D. melanogaster (28), A. gambiae (14) or A. mellifera (7). This number increase is mainly
caused by a recent family explosion at a specific genomic location - we have identified a cluster of 16 serpin genes in a small
region of 50 kilobases on chromosome 8. These closely
related genes constitute a single clade in the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 3). Sequence divergence, especially in the reactive site
loop region, is anticipated to alleviate the selection pressure
imposed by the SP family expansion (Figure 2). Exon duplication and alternative splicing, found in 4 of the 31 serpin genes,
also generate sequence diversity and inhibitory selectivity.

comment

four groups of SP-related genes may represent lineages
derived from ancient evolutionary events since similar subfamilies also exist in Anopheles and Drosophila. Moreover,
expansion of individual subfamilies must have occurred several times to account for the gene clusters observed in the Tribolium genome (Figure 2). Evidence for lineage-specific gene
duplication and movement is also present in the mosquito
and fly genomes [29,41]. Based on the results of genetic/biochemical analysis performed in other insects [14-16,19,44,45]
and sequence similarity, we are able to predict the physiological functions for some Tribolium clip-domain SPs and SPHs
during proPO activation and spätzle processing. For instance,
Tc-SPH2, SPH3 or SPH4 (similar to Hd-PPAF2) may serve as
a cofactor for Tc-SP7, SP8 or SP10 (putative proPO activating
proteinases); Tc-SP44 or SP66 may function like Drosophila
persephone [46]; Tc-SP136 or SP138 may activate spätzle
precursors by limited proteolysis [44,45].

long), 21 of the 24 substitutions are synonymous, corresponding to 0.0102 changes/site. These two genes are 530 kb apart
and their aligned intron regions are 88.5% identical. Using
the relative rate of nucleotide substitutions derived from an
analysis of Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase genes [54], we

estimate that Tc-proPO2 and Tc-proPO3 arose by gene duplication approximately 0.6 million years ago. The phylogenetic
analysis suggests that such evolutionary events are sporadic
for this family: the total numbers of proPO genes in different
insect species did not change significantly, except for the
malaria mosquito (Additional data file 8). Of the nine Ag-

Local production of free radicals is a critical component of the
acute-phase oxidative defense, involving nitric oxide synthase, NADPH oxidase, peroxidase, phenoloxidase and other
enzymes [53,55]. Due to the cytotoxicity of ROS and RNS,
their conversion and concentrations must be tightly regulated
by superoxide dismutases (SODs), glutathione oxidases
(GTXs), catalases, thioredoxins, thioredoxin reductases, melanin intermediates, and certain metal ions. Changes in the
free radical levels by gene mutation or knock-down affect the

fecundity and antimalarial response of the mosquito [56]. We
have annotated some of these genes in Tribolium, including
peroxidases, GTXs, SODs, peroxiredoxins (TPXs) and catalases. T. castaneum GTX1-GTX2 and TPX2-TPX6 gene pairs
are results of recent gene duplications, whereas several
orthologous relationships have been identified in the SOD
and TPX families in the phylogenetic analysis (Additional

A major family expansion of Tribolium serpins and their phylogenetic relationships with the serpins from other insect species. The sequences of 29 Tribolium
(Tc), 3 Drosophila (Dm), 3 Anopheles (Ag), 4 Apis (Am) and 5 Manduca (Ms) serpins are compared. Tribolium serpin2 (758 residues) and serpin26 (568
residues), much longer than a typical serpin (40-50 kDa), are excluded from the analysis. For simplicity, Tribolium serpins 1b, 15a, 20b and 28a are also
eliminated because they are products of alternative splicing of the genes 1a, 15b, 20a and 28b, which differ only in the region coding for reactive site loop.
As shown in the tree (left panel), extensive expansion gives rise to this group of highly similar genes (shaded blue) located in a small chromosomal region
(right panel). Pink arrowheads at nodes denote bootstrap values greater than 800 for 1,000 trials. Putative 1:1, 1:1:1 or 1:1:1:1 orthologous relationship is

cysteine-rich sequence. The corresponding gene (Tc11324)
encodes a 104 residue polypeptide containing 2 whey acidic
protein motifs. While mammalian proteins with this motif
possess antibacterial activities [59], expression and biochemical analyses are needed to test if the Tribolium protein has a
similar function. Due to the presence of species-specific
AMPs and severe sequence diversity of these molecules, our
homology-based search has probably missed some AMP
genes. Should there be a thorough exploration by sequence
similarity, biochemical separation and activity assays (not
only against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, but

also against yeasts and filamentous fungi), we expect the total
number of AMPs (currently 12) in T. castaneum may
approach that (20) in D. melanogaster. In addition to these,
we have found a cluster of four lysozyme genes in the Tribolium genome (Additional data file 10). Similar but independent family growths have occurred in different insect groups,
giving rise to thirteen such genes in Drosophila, eight in
Anopheles, three in Apis, and four in Tribolium.

The summary of putative immune gene counts, families and
functions (Additional data file 11) suggests that T. castaneum
has a more general defense than A. gambiae does. While this
system is critical for the survival of this beetle, we are unclear
whether or not it correlates with the prosperity of coleopteran
insects. Drastic lineage-specific expansions seem sporadic
and, in most cases, Tribolium paralog counts are lower than

refereed research

Through this comparative genome analysis, we have provided
evidence in the red flour beetle for the functional conservation of intracellular immune signaling pathways (Toll, IMD
and JAK/SAT) and for the evolutionary diversification of over
20 families of proteins (for example, PGRPs, clip-domain
proteins, serpins, Toll-related receptors, antimicrobial proteins and scavenger receptors) involved in different mechanisms of insect defense against infection. The observed
differences in conservation are likely related to distinct needs
for specific molecular interactions and changes in
microorganisms encountered by the host insects. For
instance, Drosophila Myd88, Tube, Pelle, Pellino and TRAF,
which form a macromolecular complex with the Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain (Figure 5), have 1:1 orthologs in
Anopheles, Apis and Tribolium. In contrast, family expansion
and sequence divergence in the PGRP and AMP families are
perhaps important for specific recognition and effective elimination of evolving pathogens.

deposited research

Transcriptional regulation is not limited to pattern recognition molecules or extracellular signal mediators/modulators:
we detected differential expression of ligand and their receptors (for example, Tc-spätzle1, Toll-1 through Toll-4, and
IMD). mRNA level changes for the latter genes were small
except for IMD (Figure 8). Toll-3 and Toll-4 induction after
the C. albicans or M. luteus challenge was apparent, although
not as notable as IMD. The subtle changes in Toll-1 transcript
levels were somewhat different from those of Toll-2, -3 and 4, indicating that there could be functional differences and
overlaps in antimicrobial responses for these closely related
receptors (Figure 4).

Cluster analysis of the expression patterns has revealed several trends of the transcriptional control of these immune
genes. Buffer injected and uninjured adults form one cluster
with the lowest mRNA levels, whereas E. coli- and S. cerevisiae-treated insects have the next higher level of overall gene
expression (Figure 8). The yeast-injected beetles, instead of
grouping with E. coli-treated insects, are found in the same
cluster with C. albicans-challenged adults. Interestingly,
immune responses toward the opportunistic fungal pathogen
are greater than those toward S. cerevisiae, an environmental
non-pathogen present in the diet. The responses toward M.
luteus and C. albicans were significantly stronger than those
towards E. coli, implying that the Toll pathway triggered by
the Gram-positive bacteria and filamentous fungi more effectively up-regulated target gene expression than the IMD pathway did, which may be activated by the Gram-negative
bacterial infection (Figure 5).

reports

One characteristic of the innate immune system is that some
of its components are transcriptionally up-regulated after a
microbial challenge. To acquire evidence that the genes we
annotated are involved in defense responses, we have
exposed the adult beetles to E. coli, Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans or Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells and isolated
total RNA from the control and treated insects for expression
analysis. Real-time PCR experiments indicated that transcript levels of some genes dramatically changed (Figure 8).
TcPGRP-SA and TcPGRP-SB mRNA became more abundant
after the bacterial infection, whereas the increase was much
less significant for TcPGRP-LA, -LE, galectin1 or TEP-C after
the C. albicans or M. luteus treatment. Following the Grampositive bacterial or fungal challenge, we detected some elevations in Tc-cSP66, serpin29 and serpin30 transcripts.

We have also examined genes whose products are plasma
proteins directly involved in microbe immobilization or killing. The transcripts of Tc-proPOs, lysozyme1 or lysozyme4
did not significantly change when compared with the controls, whereas those of Tc-lysozyme2 and 3 increased remarkably (Figure 8). The most dramatic increase in mRNA levels
occurred in the AMP group of effector molecules, including
Tc-attacin2, cecropin3, coleoptericin1, defensin1, and
defensin2.

comment

[60]. In the past few years, breakthroughs have been made in
the molecular dissection of these processes [61]. Drosophila
Peste, Eater, scavenger receptor (SR)-CI, Dscam, TEPs, and
PGRP-SC1a seem to be implicated in the phagocytosis. Multiple SR-B genes are present in the Tribolium (16), Drosophila
(12) and Anopheles (16) genomes, indicative of important
functions of the subfamily. A phylogenetic analysis of the SRBs (Figure 7) demonstrates that nearly half of the members
arose from ancient gene duplication events - we can easily
identify orthologs from different insect species. More recent
family expansions in the mosquito [29] and beetle account for
the other half of the subfamily. There are two SR-B gene clusters in the Tribolium genome, one of which (TcSR-B14, -B15
and -B16) is located in the same branch containing Dm-peste.
In addition to SR-Bs, Drosophila Nimrods are also involved
in cellular responses [62]. The plasmatocyte-specific NimC1
directly participates in the phagocytosis of bacteria. For Tribolium, all three subclasses are represented: NimA, NimB
and NimC, just like in the fly, mosquito and bee. However,
unlike the other insects, the syntenic relationship is broken
up in the beetle NimC homologs: the two NimC paralogs
(Tc02053 and Tc15258) are not closely linked to the NimA
and NimB homologs (Tc11427 and Tc11428). In the other
insects, the order of nimA, nimB and nimC genes is well
conserved.

Known defense proteins from other insects were used as queries to perform BLASTP searches of Tcastaneum Glean Predictions (2005.10.11) [63]. Protein sequences with E-values
lower than 0.1 were listed, and every 5th sequence was
retrieved for use as a query for another round of search. Based
on the combined lists, respective protein sequences were
retrieved, compiled in the order of ascending E-values, and
improved by two methods. Firstly, Tcastaneum ESTs
(2005.9.20) at the same HGSC site were searched with the
corresponding nucleotide sequences to identify possible
cDNA clones. The EST sequences were assembled using CAP3
[64] and the resulting contigs were used in pairwise comparison [65] to validate the gene predictions. Secondly, retrieved
protein sequences were analyzed by CDART [66], PROSITE
[67], and SMART [68] to detect conserved domain structures
required for specific functions. Necessary changes were made
after each step to improve the original predictions. Chromo-

It is noteworthy that the functions of Tribolium immunityrelated genes are mostly assumed based on sequence similarity to studied proteins in Drosophila or other insect species.
Functional analyses using the strong reverse genetic techniques available in Tribolium are necessary to test the
hypotheses. Nevertheless, the framework of information
established in this work should help clarify immune functions
in an important agricultural pest from the most diverse insect
order and a species that can serve as a tractable model for an
innate immune system more generally.

Execution

This comparative analysis has also uncovered interesting
genes and gene families for future research. For instance, the
existence of a 1:1 ortholog of Drosophila PGRP-LE in Tribolium (but not in Anopheles or Apis) may allow us to test
whether or not TcPGRP-LE has a similar function. It can be
interesting to explore the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary pathways of the large serpin and SP gene clusters in
the beetle. The presence of TcToll-1 through -4 and subtle
changes in their mRNA levels after immune challenges call
for detailed analysis of their transcriptional regulation and
physiological functions. Of course, the proposed extracellular
and intracellular signaling pathways need to be tested, even
though we have confidence in their general structures. The
possible AMP function of Tc11324, which contains two whey
acidic protein motifs, needs to be established experimentally.

played a role in the converted evolution of both families and
in the maintenance of homeostasis.

somal location and exon-intron boundaries for each annotated sequence were acquired from Genboree [69]. To locate
orthologs not identified by BLASTP, Tribolium Genome
Assembly 2.0 [70] was searched using TBLASTN. The hits
detected were analyzed using multiple gene prediction tools
Genescan and Genemark [71,72]. All curated sequences then
were deposited in the annotation database [73] as a part of
Tribolium Genome Assembly 2.0.

Phylogenetic analyses
Unless otherwise specified, full-length Tribolium sequences
were aligned with their homologs from other insects, including D. melanogaster, A. gambiae and A. mellifera. The
sequences were retrieved from NCBI [74], Flybase [75], or
Ensembl [76]. Multiple sequence alignments were carried out
using ClustalX [77] and Blosum series of weight matrices
[78]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on algorithm
of neighbor-joining using PHYLIP [79] or maximum-parsimony using PAUP [80]. The divergence time of Tc-proPO2
and proPO3 were calculated using the rate of 1.7 × 10-8 synonymous substitutions/nucleotide/year derived from the Drosophila species [54].

repeated twice and, in each of the three experimental replicates, the transcripts were normalized relative to the levels of
Tribolium ribosomal protein S3. Averaged transcript abundance values (Ctcontrol - Cttarget) were then compared across
genes and samples using average-linking clustering (Cluster

Gene expression analysis
To study pathogen-induced gene expression, adult red flour
beetles (approximately 240 per group) were pricked at the
ventral thorax with needles dipped in sterile phosphate-buffered saline or the buffer containing concentrated live E. coli,
M. luteus, C. albicans or S. cerevisiae cells. Uninjured and
aseptically injured insects were employed as controls. Total
RNA samples were extracted from the control and challenged
insects (approximately 160 per group) 24 h later, using
Micro-to-mid RNA Purification System (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). After DNA removal, each RNA sample
(1.0-3.4 μg), oligo(dT) (0.5 μg, 1 μl) and dNTPs (10 mM each,
1 μl) were mixed with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O in a
final volume of 12 μl, and denatured at 65°C for 5 minutes.
First strand cDNA was synthesized for 50 minutes at 42°C
using SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/μl, 1 μl; Invitrogen) mixed with 5 × buffer (4 μl), 0.1 M dithiothreitol (2
μl), RNase OUT (40 U/μl, 1 μl; Invitrogen) and the denatured
RNA sample (12 μl). Specific primer pairs were designed for a
total of 35 immunity-related genes (Additional data file 12)
using Primer 3 [81] with annealing temperatures of 59.560.5°C and expected product sizes of 80-150 bp. Each primer
pair was located in adjacent exons flanking an intron. Realtime PCR was performed in parallel reactions on 96-well
