Abstract
Background: The histone H2A family encompasses the greatest number of core histone variants
of which the replacement variant H2A.Z is currently one of the most heavily studied. No clear
mechanism for the functional variability that H2A.Z imparts to chromatin has yet been proposed.
While most of the past studies have referred to H2A.Z generically as a single protein, in vertebrates
it is a mixture of two protein forms H2A.Z-1 (previously H2A.Z) and H2A.Z-2 (previously H2A.F/
Z or H2A.V) that differ by three amino acids.
Results: We have performed an extensive study on the long-term evolution of H2A.Z across
metazoans with special emphasis on the possible selective mechanisms responsible for the
differentiation between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2. Our results reveal a common origin of both forms
early in chordate evolution. The evolutionary process responsible for the differentiation involves
refined stepwise mutation change within the codons of the three differential residues. This
eventually led to differences in the intensity of the selective constraints acting upon the different
H2A.Z forms in vertebrates.
Conclusion: The results presented in this work definitively reveal that the existence of H2A.Z-1
and H2A.Z-2 is not a whim of random genetic drift. Our analyses demonstrate that H2A.Z-2 is not
only subject to a strong purifying selection but it is significantly more evolutionarily constrained
than H2A.Z-1. Whether or not the evolutionary drift between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 has resulted
in a functional diversification of these proteins awaits further research. Nevertheless, the present
work suggests that in the process of their differently constrained evolutionary pathways, these two
forms may have acquired new or complementary functions.

Background
In eurkaryotic organisms, DNA is found associated with
histone proteins constituting a nucleoprotein complex
called chromatin. Approximately 146 base pairs of DNA

wrap around a core histone octamer to form a nucleosome which is the basic subunit of chromatin. This nucleoprotein complex allows for the high extent of
compaction of genomic DNA within the cell nucleus and

provides the support on which most DNA metabolic processes take place [1]. There are five histone families which
can be classified into core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and
H4) and linker histones (H1) according to structural and
functional features. The histone H1 and H2A families
show the most diversity of isoforms that have dedicated
functions in many cellular processes including organization of chromatin structure in somatic and germinal cells,
gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair
among others [2-9].
The histone H2A family contains the greatest number of
variants among the core histones, some of which are
essential for the maintenance of genome integrity and viability such as H2A.Z and H2A.X [2,10,11]. At present,
H2A.Z is one of the most heavily studied histone variants
and it has been ascribed multiple functions that may differ among species. In yeast, H2A.Z (Htz1) is present at
active and inactive gene promoters in euchromatin, it is
depleted at the silenced subtelomeric heterochromatin
and it is enriched at the boundaries between euchromatin
and heterochromatin [12]. Although studies concerning
the function of H2A.Z in mammalian cells have always
yielded results that seem difficult to reconcile, a growing
body of evidence suggests that H2A.Z is present at gene
promoters and that in an acetylated form, its presence correlates with gene expression [13,14]. However, it appears
there are also at least two populations of H2A.Z present in
heterochromatin. Greaves and colleagues show that
H2A.Z is a feature of pericentric heterochromatin and
contributes to the structure of the centromere [15].
Another fraction of H2A.Z stains the length of the inactive
X chromosome though intriguingly this fraction can be
distinguished by monoubiquitination at K120, K121 or
K125 [16].
Analysis of the H2A.Z-containing nucleosome has also
yielded conflicting results [3,17,18]. The crystal structure
of this nucleosome initially suggested a subtle destabilization between the H2A.Z-H2B dimer and the H3-H4
tetramer [19]. However, FRET and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis using native H2A.Z have indicated that the
H2A.Z nucleosome is in fact slightly more stable than the
canonical H2A nucleosome [20,21]. Also, when H2A.Z is
present in nucleosome arrays it facilitates the formation of
the 30 nm chromatin fiber [22]. The recent study by
Sarcinella and colleagues showed that it is a monoubiquitinated form of H2A.Z that is present on the inactive X
chromosome [16]. This study is a clear demonstration
that a post-translational modification has the potential to
define a subpopulation of H2A.Z. Indeed, a similar situation can be seen with H2A.Z N-terminal acetylation and
active gene transcription [14]. The difference in PTMs
could reflect the different functional constraints of the
H2A.Z-containing mono-nucleosomes in the in vivo setting. Conversely, the tendency to fold the chromatin fiber

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/31

in arrays consisting of contiguous H2A.Z-containing
nucleosomes may account for the presence of this variant
in physiologically relevant situations such as that found in
association with PcG proteins in the polycomb genes [23]
or at the flanking sites of the insulator protein CTCF [24].
Mass spectrometry analysis showed that purified H2A.Z
consists of an almost equimolar amount of two similar yet
distinct proteins that differ by three amino acids [25]
which are labeled here as H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2. In the
present work we have explored the long-term evolutionary pathway of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 differentiation
across metazoans and have analyzed the possible selective
mechanisms and the constraints responsible for the
potential functionalization of both variants. Our results
have important implications for histone evolution and
function as they show for the first time that H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2 represent two very closely related variants that
share a common evolutionary origin early in chordate
evolution. Furthermore, our results show that the evolutionary constraints leading to the differentiation of both
variants are primarily acting at the nucleotide level. This
involves a refined process of stepwise mutation change
within the codons of their three characteristic amino acid
residues. Finally, we show that H2A.Z-2 is more tightly
controlled (constrained) by selection than H2A.Z-1.

Results and Discussion
The phylogenetic context of H2A histone variants
The phylogeny including the sequences for all H2A histone variants known to date is shown in Fig. 1 (see Additional file 1 for a complete list of the sequences used and
their accession numbers). It can be seen that some of these
variants including histone H2A.Bbd [5,26], macroH2A
[4,27], and the group comprising H2A.Z variants [28]
have a monophyletic origin. Histone H2A.X shows a
recurrent differentiation across evolution, implying that it
has had multiple evolutionary origins as previously
reported [2,11]. The single evolutionary origin of the
remaining H2A variants is strongly supported by high levels of confidence in topology. Their distinctive identity
with respect to the canonical H2A histones has been
maintained since this origin. The clustering pattern in the
tree is consistent with the functional diversification and
differentiation of the histone subtypes based on a birthand-death model of evolution [28], ruling out a major
effect of a concerted evolution mechanism.

As mentioned earlier, purified H2A.Z consists of two different forms. While one component of this mixture is
referred to as H2A.Z, the other component is represented
by a protein which was initially labeled as H2A.F/Z or
H2A.V, which in humans differs at three residues from
H2A.Z as follows: H2A.Z-Thr → H2A.V-Ala (pos. 15, Ala
in canonical H2A), H2A.Z-Ser → H2A.V-Thr (pos. 39, Lys
in canonical H2A), H2A.Z-Val → H2A.V-Ala (pos. 128,

Lys in canonical H2A). Considering the small amino acid
differences existing among H2A.Z, H2A.F and H2A.V and
given that any of their protein sequences is closer to
H2A.Z than to any other histone H2A variant, we will refer
to them here as H2A.Z-1 (H2A.Z), H2A.Z-2 (H2A.V/F)
and H2A.Z-e. The latter corresponds to histone H2A.Z
from organisms preceding and including the early chordates, which is present previous to the differentiation
between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 that takes place in vertebrates (see Fig. 2 for details). Histone H2A.Z-2 has been
mainly identified from cDNA libraries and during the
annotation process of different genomes yet exhaustive
studies on this variant are still lacking. Our preliminary
biochemical results (manuscript in preparation) reveal
the co-existence of both H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 mRNAs in
chicken as well as in mammalian cells, showing significant differences in their expression levels across different
tissues. Despite being preliminary, these results may lend
support to the notion that H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 are functionally distinct and that they could act independently to
fulfill the different roles played by the histone H2A.Z fraction in chromatin structure and function.
We have performed extensive DNA and protein database
mining based on the differences exhibited by H2A.Z-1
(H2A.Z) and H2A.Z-2 (H2A.V) in three amino acid residues (referred to as triresidue hereafter, see Fig. 3A). The
analysis made use of all the H2A.Z-2 sequences available,
including those whose functionality has been assessed,
predicted and even sequences in silico isolated from draft
genomes. We obtained 21 H2A.Z-1 and 26 H2A.Z-2
sequences from chordates, which in many instances had
been incorrectly annotated in the databases (see Additional file 2 for complete details). Inclusion of all H2A.Z1 and H2A.Z-2 variants in the H2A protein phylogeny
(Additional file 3) shows that their sequences overlap
extensively without any evident functional clustering pattern or high confidence levels for the groups defined by
the topology. This suggests that the differentiation
between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 has occurred beyond the
triresidue difference that is observed in vertebrates.
Therefore, a phylogeny based on the complete nucleotide
coding regions was reconstructed in order to further investigate the mechanisms of differentiation between H2A.Z1 and H2A.Z-2. In contrast to the protein phylogeny, this
defines a clear pattern between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 in
vertebrates (Fig. 2), with a monophyletic origin which is
already independent from that of H2A.Z-e genes in early
chordates, protostomes and fungi.
Two exceptions to this clustering pattern were detected. In
the first instance, histones H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 from
zebrafish are included in the same group. This could be
due to a recent gene duplication within a short period of
time (not enough time elapsed to allow for the accumula-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/31

tion of nucleotide substitutions). Under such circumstances, the presence of gene conversion would be
unlikely because H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 genes are located
on different chromosomes in zebrafish. Another exception was observed for the H2A.Z-1 genes from X. laevis
which fall into an independent group outside both the
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 clusters. Given that the H2A.Z-1
gene from X. tropicalis and those of X. laevis and X. tropicalis H2A.Z-2 fall within their corresponding groups in the
tree, the independent position of X. laevis H2A.Z-1 could
be due to the extensive nucleotide variation exhibited
among H2A genes.
The phylogeny from Fig. 2 represents a very useful tool in
defining the identity of vertebrate H2A variants as either
H2A.Z-1 or H2A.Z-2 on the basis of their nucleotide
sequences. Indeed, the current topology allowed us to
define 24 sequences previously annotated as H2A either
as H2A.Z-1 or H2A.Z-2 following their position on the
tree. Furthermore, 20 of those sequences were previously
annotated as unknown in the databases, and thus the
present analysis helped to reveal their true identity. In two
instances (chicken and rhesus monkey) these sequences
were wrongly defined as H2A.Z-2 in the databases, and
our analyses unveiled their H2A.Z-1 identity (see Additional file 2). Such a clear differentiation between both
histone H2A.Z forms using nucleotide phylogeny suggests
not only a common phylogenetic origin early in metazoan evolution, but also the presence of a process of functional differentiation similar to that described for other
histone multigene families [28-31]. However, the differentiation among other histone family members commonly encompasses extensive synonymous divergence
under strong purifying selection at the protein level
[28,29,32-34]. In contrast, the differentiation between
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 seems to primarily involve variation at the nucleotide level which in vertebrates resulted
in a subtle protein differentiation encompassing three different amino acid residues. Such structural amino acid
refinement represents a new mechanism among those
previously known in histone diversification and is further
investigated below.
Protein and nucleotide variation in H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
variants
The amino acid sequence alignments shown in Fig. 3A
and Additional file 4 highlight the high extent of protein
similarity between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2. This is especially evident when comparing the sequences in the same
species, as in the case of human H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
(Fig. 3A). The alignment reveals the presence in vertebrates of only three residue differences (triresidue)
defined as: Thr → Ala (pos. 15, N-terminal region), Ser →
Thr (pos. 39, central globular region), and Val → Ala
(pos.128, C-terminal region). The amino acid residues

ably involved in interchromosomal contacts within the
chromatin fibre [36] are maintained in both H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2 in contrast to what has been observed in other
H2A variants such as H2ABbd [26,37]. Although the second amino acid of the triresidue falls within the a-helix 1
domain of the histone fold [38], a computer analysis
using molecular dynamic simulation (see materials and
methods) indicated that such variation has no structural
implications for secondary or tertiary structure of these
histone variants (Additional file 4).
Given the highly charged nature of histones and their
involvement in protein-DNA interactions that modulate
chromatin dynamics, the electrostatic interaction properties of the different H2A variants were analyzed. Electrostatic potentials and the corresponding similarity indices
were calculated for all H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 proteins
listed in Additional file 2, allowing us to calculate the electrostatic distances between proteins (Additional file 5). As
expected from Additional file 4, this analysis showed that
the differentiation process between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
does not involve significant differences in electrostatic
potentials within different taxonomic groups
The low levels of protein variation observed in the course
of evolution both within and between H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2 variants are clearly emphasized when estimating
the amino acid p-distances (pAA, Table 1). However, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/31

amino acid sequence variation is slightly higher among
H2A.Z-1 (0.058 ± 0.009 amino acid substitutions per site)
compared to H2A.Z-2 or even to H2A.Z-e (0.032 ± 0.006
and 0.016 ± 0.007, respectively). Analysis of the variation
at the nucleotide level (pNT, Table 1) reveals an inverse correlation with respect to the amino acid variation of
H2A.Z-1, H2A.Z-2 and H2A.Z-e from early chordates
(highest in this latter case with 0.148 ± 0.013 substitutions per site). The nature of the nucleotide variation is
essentially synonymous and significantly greater than the
nonsynonymous variation in all cases (**P < 0.001 in all
codon-based Z-test comparisons). In an attempt to gain
further insight into the evolutionary processes underlying
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 variability, we analyzed the
amounts of total and synonymous nucleotide variation
across both molecules as well as in the case of H2A.Z-e
from early chordates. Such analyses provide useful information regarding the presence of functional constraints
affecting the structural domains of proteins and have been
successfully used in previous studies [26,28,32,39].
An additional insight into the evolution of H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2 can be obtained from their overall variation. The
values shown in Table 2, indicate the presence of an extensive silent divergence between histones H2A.Z-1, H2A.Z-2
and H2A.Z-e with very similar magnitudes (ranging form
0.668 to 0.691 synonymous substitutions/site). However,
protein distances reveal a different picture that is charac-

terized by the close proximity between H2A.Z-2 and
H2A.Z-e (0.028 substitutions/site), which is lower than
the distance between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-e (0.038 substitutions/site) and significantly lower than the overall distance between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 variants from
vertebrates (0.053 substitutions/site). These results support the presence of a mechanism of functional diversification and differentiation which most likely fits a birthand-death model of evolution. This is based on the extensive synonymous nucleotide variation observed within
and between variants as well as on the strong purifying
selection constraining H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 at the protein level, which is similar to what is observed for all other
histone families studied until now [28,32]. Contrary to
other multigene families, the contribution of concerted
evolution (gene conversion or interlocus recombination)
to H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 long-term evolution can be disregarded considering the different chromosomal location
of both forms in all organisms studied (see Additional file
2). In addition, both H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 seem to be
more closely related to H2A.Z-e from early chordates than
to one another, supporting the idea of a common origin
for both variants in early deuterostomes following a subsequent process of differentiation later on in evolution.
Indeed, the constraints operating on H2A.Z-1 at the nucleotide level during this differentiation process seem to be
somewhat more relaxed compared with those operating
on H2A.Z-2 and H2A.Z-e. Our results also reveal that
H2A.Z-2 is as divergent from H2A.Z-1 as they both are
from canonical H2A, a divergence that at the nucleotide
level operates in all instances over the same regions of the
protein (loop 1 and 2, as well as the docking domain).
This diversification between H2A.Z-1/H2A.Z-2 and
canonical H2A should be clearly distinguished from the
relaxation in the constraints bewtween H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2 to which we are going to subsequently refer in
the text.
The nature of the selective constraints operating on
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 histones
At the protein level, the evolutionary mechanisms leading
to the differential identity of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 seem

to be operating beyond a process of purifying selection.
Therefore, we decided to investigate the levels of codon
usage bias in both genes in order to analyze the effect of
selection at the nucleotide level. Differences in codon bias
are common between different histone multigene families, more or less independently of the particular organisms studied [28,40,41]. Indeed, our results reveal
significant differences between the H2A variants analyzed,
with H2A.Z-2 (47.122 ± 2.456) exhibiting a significantly
higher bias than H2A.Z-1 (55.106 ± 1.098; t-test = -6.799,
P = 0.000). Such results have important implications for
the evolutionary constraints affecting both histone types
at the nucleotide level. Interestingly, no such significant
difference in codon bias has ever been previously reported
between histone variants belonging to the same histone
multigene family, due to the presence of a strong purifying selection acting at the protein level as a major evolutionary force that leads to an extensive and homogeneous
silent variation at the nucleotide level [28,29,32-34]. Also,
the codon bias analyses are in agreement with the previous results at the amino acid level indicating also that
H2A.Z-1 is less constrained than H2A.Z-2 at the nucleotide level. Furthermore, histone H2A.Z-e from early
chordates displays an intermediate overall codon bias
magnitude (49.666 ± 2.546) which is not significantly different from either H2A.Z-1 or from H2A.Z-2 (P > 0.05 in
Duncan multiple range-test). These results suggest that the
differences in the intensity of the selective constraints
operating on H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 probably arose during
the differentiation of both variants from a common ancestor, represented here by H2A.Z-e from early chordates.
Among other potential causes, differences in codon usage
bias can be related to the preferential use of certain preferred triplets encoding overrepresented amino acids in
the proteins, as occurs in highly basic proteins such as histones [28,42]. The most abundant residues in H2A.Z-1
and H2A.Z-2 proteins are represented by glycine and
alanine (GC-rich amino acids) and lysine and isoleucine
(GC-poor amino acids). The presence of selection for such
biased amino acids in these classes was thus analyzed by
studying the correlation between the frequency of GC-rich

and GC-poor amino acids with the genomic GC content
(see Additional files 6 and 7). We found that correlations
between GC content and the frequency of GC-rich amino
acids and GC-poor amino acids were not significant neither in H2A.Z-1 nor H2A.Z-2 (Fig. 3B and Fig. 3C). Similarly, the correlations between GC content and the most
represented amino acids in each class (P > 0.05 in all
Spearman rank correlations) were not significant either, as
indicated in Table 3. These results indicate a departure
from the neutral model of molecular evolution, which
hypothesizes that GC-rich and GC-poor amino acids will
be positively and negatively correlated with genomic GC
content, respectively [43-46].
An additional method to gauge the significance of mutation bias and selection at the nucleotide level involves the
comparison of changes at first codon positions (all nonsynonymous) with changes at fourfold positions (all synonymous) in the most frequent residues in H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2. Under the neutral model the nucleotide frequencies at both positions should not be significantly different [47]. Codons for glycine and alanine (GC-rich)
contain G at first codon positions, whereas codons for
lysine and isoleucine (GC-poor) have A at first codon
positions. Analysis of the mean G + A content at first
codon positions in H2A.Z-1 (74.94 ± 0.67) and H2A.Z-2
(77.49 ± 0.84) showed that their values were significantly
larger than the mean G + A content at fourfold degenerate
positions in H2A.Z-1 (41.76 ± 4.73) and H2A.Z-2 (44.88
± 2.86), (H2A.Z-1, t-test = 44.627, P = 0.000; H2A.Z-2, ttest = 37.901, P = 0.000). The values are significantly dif-

ferent in all species analyzed (see Additional files 6 and
7). While the neutral model of molecular evolution predicts that amino acid and nucleotide compositions are
driven by the underlying GC content as a result of mutation bias, our results strongly suggest that selection has
acted to maintain high levels of glycine, alanine, lysine
and isoleucine in H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 variants, biasing
their nucleotide composition. Few studies have shown
that natural selection is more important than mutation
bias in determining amino acid composition of proteins
[28,42,47-49]. In this regard, our observations with
H2A.Z stand in contrast to the neutral model.
The progressive differentiation of H2A variants is mediated
by stepwise mutations
The analyses presented in this work indicate that selective
constraints governing H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 evolution go
far beyond the protein level, as shown by the significant
differences detected in codon usage bias and the presence
of selection for highly biased amino acid composition
that influences the nucleotide composition. However, the
specific mechanisms responsible for the subtle differentiation between both forms and the functional meaning of
this process remain obscure. In order to define possible
functional selective targets in these proteins we decided to
look at the codon usage of the amino acids of the triresidue that defines the identity of vertebrate H2A.Z-1 (Thr/
Ser/Val) and H2A.Z-2 (Ala/Thr/Ala). The codons
involved, which are indicated near each of the H2A
sequences analyzed in the phylogeny shown in Fig. 2,

show a high degree of conservation of codon in each histone form and within each taxonomic group.
Starting from early chordates, the amino acid triresidue
defined as Ala/Asp/Thr eventually leads to the actual
triresidues from both mammalian H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2.
Paying attention to the triplet encoding the first amino
acid in the triresidue of H2A.Z-e from early chordates, we
can trace a stepwise mutation pathway leading to the
actual residue in the corresponding position of mammalian H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2. For instance the first amino
acid in the triresidue from early chordates is alanine
(encoded by GCG), which undergoes two synonymous
mutations leading to the corresponding actual residue in
mammalian H2A.Z-2 (alanine, GCT), with an intermediate synonymous mutation step represented by H2A.Z-2
from amphibians (Xenopus, alanine GCC). Similarly, the
pathway leading to the first residue of H2A.Z-1 would
involve an intermediate synonymous mutation step in
amphibians (Xenopus, alanine, GCA) and a final nonsynonymous step in the first codon position leading to mammalian H2A.Z-1 (threonine, ACA). It is important to
point out that only one nucleotide at a given position in
the codon changes in every step, with the remaining two
positions being invariable. This mechanism is schematically shown in Fig. 4 which outlines the pathways starting
from the amino acids in the triresidue from early chordates to the triresidue from mammalian H2A.Z-1 and
H2A.Z-2, through an intermediate step represented by
nonmammalian vertebrates (amphibians and zebrafish).
This phenomenom reveals a very unique evolutionary
process in which the evolution of the whole protein, leading either towards H2A.Z-1 or H2A.Z-2, is driven by the
composition of the triresidue both at the amino acid and
at the nucleotide levels.
Although the overall mutation pathway is stepwise, there
are two instances in which more than one nucleotide
change occurs in the same step: the change from AAC
(Asp) to TCT (Ser) in the second amino acid of the triresidue, and from ACA (Thr) to GTC (Val) in the third amino
acid of the triresidue. These multiple changes occur in the
pathway towards H2A.Z-1, further illustrating the less
constrained status of this variant compared to H2A.Z-2.
Indeed, the pathways leading towards H2A.Z-2 involve an
overall number of two amino acid replacements and four
synonymous subtitutions, compared to the three amino
acid replacements and two synonymous substitutions in
the case of the H2A.Z-1. It is important to note here that
the pathway leading towards H2A.Z-2 always ends using
the triplet with higher relative synonymous codon usage
within each of the three residues, while the codons in the
case of H2A.Z-1 are always less preferred with the excep-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/31

tion of serine. It is thus possible to identify a trend underlying the codon usage across these pathways, starting with
triplets with low relative synonymous codon usage
(RSCU) in the triresidue from early chordates, triplets
with medium RSCU in the second step and triplets with
maximum RSCU in the case of H2A.Z-2 and minimum
RSCU in H2A.Z-1. Additional support for the higher levels
of variation within H2A.Z-1 can be obtained from the estimation of the pattern of nucleotide substitutions shown
in Table 4. By examining the overall number of nucleotide
substitutions involved in the stepwise mutation model
previously described, we found that from the six nucleotide changes involved in the pathway leading to mammalian H2A.Z-2, two reach maximum levels of
probability as estimated in Table 4. In contrast, the same
observation is made in six out of the nine nucleotide
changes leading to H2A.Z-1. This suggests that this variant
accumulates a sufficiently large number of nucleotide
changes as to influence the maximum composite likelihood estimation of the probability of substitution of one
nucleotide for another in H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2.

Conclusion
The function of histone H2A.Z in gene activation/silencing is still an important topic in chromatin research, as no
clear mechanism for its structural and functional variability has yet been proposed. In this regard, the presence of
two different H2A.Z forms is especially interesting [25].
Although very little is known about H2A.Z-2, the results
presented in this work definitively reveal that its existence
is not a whim of random genetic drift. The functional significance of H2A.Z-2 is still obscure, however our group
has been able to demonstrate the coexistence of both
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 in chicken and human tissues, and
that significant differences in their mRNA expression levels exist and in this regard, it is very likely that the key to
the existence of these two functional H2A.Z forms resides
within their promoter regions (manuscript in preparation). Our analyses demonstrate not only that H2A.Z-2 is
subject to a strong purifying selection (as most histones
are) but that in fact it is significantly more evolutionarily
constrained than H2A.Z-1.
Nevertheless, it appears that this selection does not proceed in conventional ways. While phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses reveal a typical process of birth-anddeath evolution with strong purifying selection leading to
the differentiation of H2A family members [28], an
almost identical primary structure has been conserved
between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 except for three amino
acid differences. This is surprising considering that the
two forms occupy different chromosomal locations (as
revealed by the in silico analyses performed in the present

Schematic representation of the stepwise mutation model leading from the early chordate triresidue to the mammalian H2A.ZSchematic representation of the stepwise mutation model leading from the early chordate triresidue to the
mammalian H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 triresidues. The model is presented independently for each of the positions in the
triresidue. In the first step, the amino acid at a given position of the triresdue from early chordates is indicated. The second
step involves the choice of either the H2A.Z-1 or the H2A.Z-2 pathway through a substitution of one of the positions in the
codon which can result in a synonymous change or a residue replacement, configuring the triresidue in H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2
proteins from non-mammalian vertebrates (usually Xenopus and zebrafish). The third step involves the transition of the already
differentiated triresidues from non-mammalian vertebrates to those observed in mammalian H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 forms,
through a single mutation in each of the three codons in most cases. The nature of the nucleotide substitutions mediating the
transition from one step to another is indicated by open blue boxes (synonymous) and solid blue boxes (nonsynonymous)
detailing the nucleotide change and the position at which it occurs. Multiple substitutions are indicated by solid grey boxes. The
relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for each codon (black) is compared with the RSCU value for the preferred codon in

ancestor early in chordate evolution. The main evolutionary constraints directing the limited amino acid variation
between H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 are primarily acting at the
nucleotide level. This defines a process of stepwise mutation change in the codons constituting the triresidue
which mirrors H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 evolution.
According to Clapier et al., the amino acid sequence

highly constrained evolution of histones, are of little
structural but decisive functional consequences [50].
Indeed, is worthwhile to mention that knocking out
H2A.Z-1 in mice results in lethality and therefore (at least
during early development), H2A.Z-2 cannot replace
H2A.Z-1 (either in terms of abundance or function). In
the instance of H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2, the difference in
amino acid sequence variability is minimal and it affects
only three residues. Yet, we have observed a much closer
proximity of the constraints imposed at the nucleotide
level between the sequence of the genes encoding H2A.Z2 and the histone H2A.Z ancestor (H2A.Z-e) when compared to H2AZ-1. This suggests that in the transition from
chordates to vertebrates, the H2A.Z-1 has arisen to acquire
a novel, or most likely complementary functions.

Methods
Mining of H2A nucleotide data
A total of 109 nonredundant H2A nucleotide coding
sequences available from eukaryotes was collected from
the histone database [51] and GenBank through BLAST
searches, including 64 canonical H2A sequences, 30
H2A.X sequences, 8 macro H2A sequences, and 7
H2A.Bbd sequences (see Additional file 1). Additional

data mining performed on complete and draft genome
databases resulted in the identification of 69 nucleotide
sequences encoding H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 histone variants from eukaryotes (see Additional file 2). In vertebrates, these variants were identified based on the
differences shown in three residues (triresidue) characteristic either of H2A.Z-1 (21 sequences identified) or
H2A.Z-2 (26 sequences identified), correcting sequence
nomenclature when necessary (see Additional file 2).
Given that sequences from early chordates contain mixed
characteristics of both H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2, these were
called H2A.Z-e (4 sequences).

The extent of nucleotide and amino acid divergence
between sequences was estimated using uncorrected differences (p-distance) as this distance is known to give better results than more complicated methods when the
number of sequences is large and the number of positions
used is relatively small, because of its smaller variance
[60]. The numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous
nucleotide differences per site were computed by means
of the modified Nei-Gojobori method [61]. Distances
were estimated using the complete-deletion option in all
cases and standard errors were calculated by the bootstrap
method (1000 replicates).

Variation in H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 histone variants
Nucleotide coding sequences were aligned on the basis of
their translated amino acid sequences using the BioEdit
and CLUSTAL_X programs with the default parameters
[52,53]. A bar chart representation was used in order show
the frequency of each residue at every position of the
alignment of vertebrate H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 forms
using the LogoBar program [54]. The 3D structures of
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 proteins from vertebrates as well as
H2A.Z-e from early chordates were modeled using the
coordinates determined for the crystal structure of a nucleosome particle containing the variant histone H2A.Z-1
from human (PDB accession code 1F66) as a reference
[19]. Evaluation of model qualities in homology modeling was performed by two approaches: 1) GROMOS
empirical force energy to estimate the local quality of the
predicted structure, with the y-axis representing the energy
for each amino acid of the protein (negative and positive
energy values represent favorable and unfavorable energy
environments, respectively, for a given amino acid); 2)
Verify3D to analyze the compatibility of an atomic model
with its own amino acid sequence, in which the y-axis represents the average profile score for each residue in a 21residue sliding window with scores ranging from -1 (bad
score) to +1 (good score). All modeling and evaluation
analyses were performed using the SWISS-MODEL workspace [55] and structures were rendered using the MacPyMOL program [56].

All molecular and evolutionary analyses in this work were
conducted using the program MEGA ver. 4.0 [62], as well
as the calculation of amino acid and nucleotide frequencies, the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) and
the maximum composite likelihood estimation of the
nucleotide substitution patterns. The codon usage bias in
H2A variants was referred to as the effective number of
codons (ENC), which ranges from 61 (no bias) to 20
(maximum bias) and does not need any previous information on codon usage preferences in the genomes analyzed [63]. The analysis of the nucleotide variation across
the different protein domains of H2A variants was performed by estimating the proportion (p) of nucleotide
sites at which the two sequences being compared are different and the numbers of synonymous substitutions per
site (pS), following a sliding-window approach (window
length of 20 bp and step size of 5 bp for p, window length
of 5 bp and step size of 1 bp for pS) implemented in the
program DnaSP ver. 4.0 [64].

The comparisons between H2A protein variants with
respect to their electrostatic properties were conducted in
the webPIPSA pipeline [57], starting with a set of 3D structures modeled for all proteins listed in Additional file 2
and using human H2A.Z-1 as a reference. Electrostatic
potentials were calculated using the University of Houston Brownian Dynamics (UHBD) program [58], and the
absolute distances calculated from the similarity indices
for the electrostatic potentials were represented in a colorized matrix and an epogram (tree representation of the
relationships among potentials). The representation of
the electrostatic potentials in the modeled 3D structures
was implemented with the VMD program [59].

Gauge of selection and selective constraints acting on
H2A.Z-1 and H2A.Z-2 variants
The presence and nature of selection was studied following two strategies: 1) using the codon-based Z-test for
selection [60] comparing the numbers of synonymous
and nonsynonymous substitutions per site [61] in H2A
genes, establishing the alternative hypothesis as H1: pN <pS
and the null hypothesis as H0: pN = pS; 2) analyzing deviations from neutrality following two different approaches.
First, the influence of selection on overrepresented amino
acids was revealed by determining the correlation
between the genomic GC content and the proportion of
GC-rich (GAPW) and GC-poor amino acids (FYMINK). In
this case, while GC-rich amino acids will be positively correlated with genomic GC content and vice-versa under the
neutral model [43-46], they will not show any correlation
if they are influenced by selection. In both cases, the GC
content at fourfold degenerate positions was assumed to
represent the genomic GC content, given that the latter
has already been shown to be a good approximation of
the former [65] and was also used as a good approximation to the neutral expectation. Correlations were com-

puted using Spearman rank correlation analyses and
statistical significance was assessed using standard regression analyses. Second, the effect of mutation and selection
bias at the nucleotide level was studied by comparing
nucleotide frequencies at first codon positions (always
nonsynonymous in the case of the residues studied here)
and at fourfold positions (always synonymous). Under
the neutral model, nucleotide frequencies should not be
significantly different between both positions [47].
Inference of the phylogenetic relationships among H2A
variants
Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed from the obtained
p-distances using the neighbor-joining method [66]. To
assess that our results are not dependent on this choice,
phylogenetic inference analyses were completed by the
reconstruction of maximum-parsimony trees [67] using
the close-neighbor-interchange (CNI) search method. The
bootstrap [68] and the interior branch-test [67,69] methods were combined in order to test the reliability of the
trees, producing the bootstrap probability (BS) and the
confidence probability (CP) values for each internal
branch, assuming BP > 80% and CP ≥ 95% as statistically
significant [70]. Histone H2A sequences of the diplomonad protist Giardia were used as outgroups, given that
this lineage is believed to be the first to diverge from all
other eukaryotes [71].
