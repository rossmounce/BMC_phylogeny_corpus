Abstract
Background: The genus Arachis includes Arachis hypogaea (cultivated peanut) and wild species that
are used in peanut breeding or as forage. Molecular markers have been employed in several studies
of this genus, but microsatellite markers have only been used in few investigations. Microsatellites
are very informative and are useful to assess genetic variability, analyze mating systems and in
genetic mapping. The objectives of this study were to develop A. hypogaea microsatellite loci and
to evaluate the transferability of these markers to other Arachis species.
Results: Thirteen loci were isolated and characterized using 16 accessions of A. hypogaea. The level
of variation found in A. hypogaea using microsatellites was higher than with other markers. Crosstransferability of the markers was also high. Sequencing of the fragments amplified using the primer
pair Ah11 from 17 wild Arachis species showed that almost all wild species had similar repeated
sequence to the one observed in A. hypogaea. Sequence data suggested that there is no correlation
between taxonomic relationship of a wild species to A. hypogaea and the number of repeats found
in its microsatellite loci.
Conclusion: These results show that microsatellite primer pairs from A. hypogaea have multiple
uses. A higher level of variation among A. hypogaea accessions can be detected using microsatellite
markers in comparison to other markers, such as RFLP, RAPD and AFLP. The microsatellite
primers of A. hypogaea showed a very high rate of transferability to other species of the genus.
These primer pairs provide important tools to evaluate the genetic variability and to assess the
mating system in Arachis species.

Background
The origin and the diversity center of the genus Arachis are
in South America [1]. This genus comprises 69 species,
most of which are diploid and wild. The cultivated species
include A. hypogaea L., the cultivated peanut, A. glabrata

and A. pintoi, which have been used in forage production
[2,3]. This genus is divided into nine sections (Arachis,
Erectoides, Heteranthae, Caulorrhizae, Rhizomatosae, Extranervosae, Triseminatae, Procumbentes and Trierectoides)

according to their morphology, geographic distribution
and sexual compatibility [1].
The extensive morphological variation in A. hypogaea has
led to the identification of subspecies, although studies
using molecular markers have found little polymorphism
in the germplasm of this species [4-6]. The observed
restriction in genetic variation limits the use of several
approaches, such as molecular marker-assisted selection
and the construction of a molecular map that are essential
tools in A. hypogaea breeding.
Cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid that contains
genomes A and B, which are found in wild diploid species
of section Arachis. This species has arisen probably from a
unique cross between the wild diploid species A. duranensis (A genome) and A. ipaënsis (B genome) resulting in a
hybrid whose chromosome number was spontaneously
duplicated [7]. This duplication isolated A. hypogaea from
the wild diploid species not allowing allele exchange with
them. The origin through a single and recent polyplodization event, followed by successive selection during breeding efforts, resulted in a highly conserved genome [8]. The
morphological variation observed among accessions of A.
hypogaea is most probably due to the variation in few
genes [9].
Microsatellites are highly polymorphic molecular markers
[10], which have been used to analyze genetic variability
and to construct molecular maps in several plant species
[11-14]. Hopkins and colleagues [15] analyzed the genetic
variation using six microsatellite primer pairs and 19
accessions of A. hypogaea and three accessions of wild Arachis species (A. duranensis, A. ipaënsis, A. monticola). These
authors have observed that despite the low frequency of
polymorphism found in A. hypogaea, these microsatellite
loci were very informative and could provide a useful tool
to identify and partition genetic variation in the cultivated
peanut. Fergurson and colleagues [16] developed 226
microsatellite primer pairs for A. hypogaea and from the
192 that amplified well 110 putative loci showed polymorphism in a diverse array of 24 cultivated peanut accessions. Moretzsohn and colleagues [17] analyzing 36
species of Arachis observed the cross species amplification
rate of A. hypogaea microsatellite primers was up 76% to
species of section Arachis and up to 45% to species of the
other eight section of genus Arachis.
Microsatellite markers could be useful to analyze the
genetic variation in the germplasm of wild Arachis species.
These species have more intraspecific genetic variation
detectable than A. hypogaea, as shown by using molecular
markers [18,19], and are resistant to numerous pests and
diseases that affect the cultivated peanut [20]. The high
cost of developing microsatellite markers is the main fac-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/9

tor limiting their widespread use in this genus. A good
alternative would be the use of a set of primers to obtain
cross-species transferability, as reported in other studies
[21-24].
The objectives of this study were to isolate and characterize the microsatellite loci of A. hypogaea and to assess the
cross-transferability of these markers to other Arachis species.

Results and Discussion
A total of 68 random clones were selected and sequenced.
Thirty-eight (55.9%) of them contained microsatellites.
Repeat length ranged from 12 bp to 47 bp. Twenty-four
(63.1%) microsatellites were perfect, two (5.3%) were
imperfect and 12 (31.6%) were compound repeats. From
those, 16 clones were chosen to design the primers, since
they had more than 10 repeats. Microsatellite sequences
formed by less than 10 repeats are considered to be less
polymorphic, and thus not very informative.
Seven clones contained AG/TC repeats, three contained
AC/TG repeats, five contained AT/TA repeats, and one
contained a poly A repeat [(A)35GG(A)9]. Sixty-three percent of the selected clones (10/16) had complementary
sequences to the oligonucleotides used in the enrichment
procedure. However, the other 37% had different repeats
(AT and A) that were not totally complementary to the
probes used. The selection of AT sequences using AC and
AG oligonucleotides were not reported in other studies
where libraries were enriched for these two types of
sequences [25-27]. In the previous studies the hybridization between the probes and single stranded clones were
performed at temperatures superior to 50°C, thus under
very stringent conditions, reducing the possibility of selection of clones due to mismatches. In this study, the
enrichment was performed at room temperature (around
25°C). Some sequences did not contain repeated
sequence indicating that mismatches have happened.
However, the frequency of AT in this group was high. This
high percentage could be due to the probes used (AC15
and AG15), which could have had up to 50% of their
sequences complementary to AT/TA regions. Taking into
account only the adenines in these probes, since adenines
would pair to the timidines of target or part of the target
sequence, temperatures above 35°C would be necessary
to break the nitrogen bonds, since 35°C is the melting
point of an oligonucleotide formed by 15 adenines. The
forementioned temperature is 10°C higher than the room
temperature, allowing a more stable association between
the probe and the adenine-rich target (AT and poliA) than
in adenine-poor targets, increasing the frequency of these
motifs in the group of selected sequences due to the mismatch.

Primers were designed and synthesized to 13 of the 16
sequences selected. This set of primers and a primer pair
developed by Hopkins and colleagues [15] were used to
amplify microsatellite loci in A. hypogaea and in wild diploid species of eight sections of genus Arachis.
The 14 primer pairs allowed the detection of 18 putative
loci in A. hypogaea (Table 1). Thus, a number of primer
pairs amplified loci in both genomes of A. hypogaea. Four
primer pairs (Ah7, Ah21, Ah30 and Ah282) amplified two
putative loci in A. hypogaea and one locus in A. duranensis
(genome A) and A. ipaënsis (genome B) and the other ten
pairs allowed the amplification of a single putative locus
that was amplified in A. hypogaea and in A. duranensis or
A. ipaënsis (data not shown). Thus, the primers pairs fall
into three groups based on the amplification events
observed in A. hypogaea and in A. ipaënsis and A. duranensis: 1) those allowing the amplification in A. hypogaea and
A. duranensis and detect a putative locus in the A genome,
2) those allowing the amplification of a putative locus in
A. hypogaea and A. ipaënsis and detect a locus in the B
genome, and 3) those allowing the amplification in A.
hypogaea, A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis and detect putative
loci in both genomes.
The level of polymorphism varied greatly among the polymorphic loci. Ah51 allowed the amplification of seven
alleles and the PIC was 0.79, whereas the least polymorphic primer pair Ah282 amplified only two alleles and
presented PIC = 0.11. Primers Ah51 flank a region that
comprises the largest number of repeats (34) and the
motif was formed by two nucleotides (A and G) whereas
Ah282 flanked a region containing two microsatellites,
each composed of six trinucleotide repeats. Hopkins and
colleagues [15] and He and colleagues [28] observed that
some loci, despite their long repeats (20–40), were invariant among the cultivated accessions tested. The difference
observed in the studies cited above may have been due to
the following: 1 – distinct number of loci were analyzed
in these studies; 2 – distinct sets of A. hypogaea accessions
were used. Moreover, the invariant microsatellites may be
located in genes, what make them less variable despite
their long repeats.
Overall, the mean percentage of polymorphic loci was
33%, the mean number of alleles per primer pair within
the accessions of A. hypogaea was 4.02, and the PIC was
0.48. In this study, the percentage of polymorphic microsatellite loci was lower than those found in other studies
where microsatellite markers were used to evaluate
genetic variability within A. hypogaea. Ferguson and colleagues [16] studying a set of 24 accessions of A. hypogaea
from 7 countries from different continents found 57.3%
of polymorphic microsatellite loci. He and colleagues [28]
found that 34% of the microsatellite primer pairs showed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/9

polymorphism in a sample that comprised A. hypogaea
accessions from eight Latin America countries. Despite the
lower percentage of microsatellite loci found in this study,
it was higher than the percentage of polymorphic loci in
A. hypogaea observed using RAPD [6.6% (29)], and AFLP
[6.7% (6); 6.4 %, (30)]. Besides the large percentage of
polymorphic loci, Hopkins and colleagues [15] observed
that the amount of useful information obtained per polymorphic microsatellite locus was quite high. For instance,
in this study, the mean number of alleles was 4.02, and
several primer pairs were highly informative, such as
primer pair Ah51, which allowed the amplification of
seven different fragments.
PCR products were obtained for most of the wild species
analyzed (Table 2). In general, fragments close to the size
of the fragment expected for A. hypogaea were detected.
The transferability of the markers was variable, ranging
from 54% for the locus Ah6–125 to 100% for Ah30. The
level of polymorphism also varied among loci, ranging
from 25 alleles in Ah30 and Ah126 to 15 alleles in Ah11
and Ah20.
The annealing temperatures used to amplify microsatellite
loci in wild Arachis species ranged from 10°C below the
melting temperature (Tm) of a given pair of primers to the
melting temperature of the primer. The necessity of lower
annealing temperatures for some pairs of primer suggested that some microsatellite flanking regions were
more conserved than others in the Arachis species analyzed. The data also suggested that changes in the flanking
regions most probably resulted from point mutations and
small deletions and insertions, since if major rearrangements were responsible for causing the changes, they
would probably have resulted in no amplification due to
the interruption or deletion of primer-annealing sites.
Point mutations and small rearrangements (deletions
and/or insertions) were detected in the flanking regions of
the Ah11 locus of some species analyzed (Figure 1). For
instance, a sequence of five bases (positions 112 to 116)
was absent from A. triseminata.
The cross-transferability of A. hypogaea markers to species
of section Arachis was very high, ranging from 60% for
Ah20 to 100% for Ah30. A similar level of microsatellite
marker transferability was observed from Triticum aestivum L. to its ancestral diploid species [24]. Section Arachis
comprises species with genomes (AA and BB) similar to
those found in the cultivated peanut (AABB) showing
agronomical value characteristics, which are introgressed
into cultivated peanut mainly by means of crosses with
synthetic amphidiploids resultant from crosses between A
and B genome species. The resulting F1 has to be backcrossed many times to get an off-spring that has the introgressed characteristic and most of the recurrent parental

genome. A genetic map constructed using wild diploid
species would be useful to guide the introgression of genes
from wild species to A. hypogaea. A map would allow the
discovery of markers linked to gene(s) or chromosome
regions that are responsible or involved in the expressions
of introgressed characteristic. Similarly, it would allow the
selection of markers distributed all over both genomes of
A. hypogaea, helping the selection of plants showing largest percentages of the recurrent parental genome. This
approach would be the most efficient way to integrate
molecular markers into breeding programs of cultivated
peanut, since genetic polymorphism in A. hypogaea is very
low [4,15,31] and insufficient to construct a genetic map.
Figure 2 shows the relationships among species of Arachis
section based on amplification events observed using
eight pairs of microsatellite loci from A. hypogaea. Two
groups were identified. The first consisting of A. hypogaea,
A. monticola and all analyzed genome Aspecies, the second
contained the species classified as genome B and A. glandulifera Stalker, classified as genome D [32]. The division
into two main groups was based essentially on the

absence of amplification of two loci (Ah20 and Ah6–125)
in genome B species. Despite the few loci analyzed (8), the
groups defined by the dendrogram agreed with previous
studies that classified species of the Arachis section into
genomes A, B and D. In this study A genomes species were
placed closer to A. hypogaea than the B genomes. Tallury
and colleages [33] using AFLPs found A ipaënsis and A. williamsii, both B genome species, closer to A. hypogaea than
A genome species. This difference on affinities of A and B
genome species with A. hypogaea may be due to the type
and number of markers used. The data also agreed with
the close relationship between A. glandulifera and B
genome species [33]. These findings suggested that flanking regions contain useful phylogenetic information.
PCR products were also obtained for species from sections
Caulorrhizae, Erectoides, Extranervosae, Procumbentes, Rhizomatosae, Trierectoides and Triseminatae (Table 3). Five
primer pairs, namely Ah2, Ah11, Ah19, Ah30 and Ah126,
from the eight primers (62.5%) tested resulted in amplifications from all sections. The pair Ah6–125 (12.5%) produced amplification in six sections, and Ah20 and Ah21

Alignment of nucleotide sequences of 18 Arachis species amplified using primer pair Ah11
Alignment of nucleotide sequences of 18 Arachis species amplified using primer pair Ah11. Species analyzed: A. valida (1), A.
triseminata (2), A. subcoreacea (3), A. cardenasii (4), A. guaranitica (5), A. batizocoi (6), A. repens (7), A. duranensis (8), A. paraguariensis (9), A. burkartii (10), A. ipaënsis (11), A. kuhlmannii (12), A. kempff-mercadoi (13), A. magna (14), A. hoehnei (15), A. decora (16),
A. macedoi (17) and A. hypogaea (18). The sequences of all species comprised microsatellites, but the number of repeats varied
a lot among them.

in five sections (25%). Taking into account that 33% of
the primers pairs allowed the detection of polymorphism
among accessions of A. hypogaea, this set of primers will
probably show polymorphism in wild Arachis species, so
they could be analyzed using microsatellite loci with no
costs to primer development. Cross-transferability of Arachis microsatellite markers was also observed in other
studies. Hopkins and colleagues [15] using A. hypogaea
microsatellite primers observed cross-amplification in A.
monticola, A. ipaënsis and A. duranensis, species that are
closely related to A. hypogaea. Moretzsohn and colleagues
[17] also using A. hypogaea microsatellite primers
observed up to 76% of transferability to species of Arachis
section and up to 45% to species of the other eight section
of genus Arachis. Moretzsohn and colleagues [34]
observed cross amplification and detected polymorphism
between A. duranensis (A genome) and A. stenosperma (A
genome) using a large number of pair of primers developed for different Arachis species.
The existence of repeated sequences in microsatellite
primer-amplified fragments for locus Ah11 of A. hypogaea
and DNA of 18 species (A. batizocoi A. burkartii, A. cardenasii, A. decora, A. duranensis, A. guaranitica, A. hoehnei, A.
hypogaea, A. ipaënsis, A. kempff-mercadoi, A. kuhlmannii, A.
macedoi, A. magna, A. paraguariensis, A. repens, A. subcoriacea, A. triseminata and A. valida) was confirmed by
sequencing. The sequences of the fragments of each species analyzed are shown in Figure 1. All species showed
repeated sequences similar to those found in Ah11 locus
of the cultivated peanut, regardless of the section to which
the species belonged. These sequences differed from each

other only in the number of repeated motifs. Thus, primers for A. hypogaea were able to amplify microsatellites in
other Arachis species.
A neighbor-joining tree constructed based on a small part
of the flanking regions and on the repeated sequences of
the Ah11 locus in 18 species is shown in Figure 3. The species of the different sections of Arachis were scattered
throughout the tree and some were located close to species from other sections. The majority of the variation
among species reflected differences in the number of
motifs among the species and not in the flanking regions.
These results suggested that there was no correlation
between the number of repeated sequences and the taxonomic relationship among these species, and that the
level of information contained in a microsatellite locus
did not necessarily positively correlate to the degree of
relatedness to A. hypogaea. For instance, A. hoehnei and A.
cardenasii, both from section Arachis, had shorter microsatellites than A. repens (Section Caulorrhizae) and A.
triseminata (section Triseminatae). A larger number of
plants from each species would need to be analyzed in
order to test this hypothesis because microsatellites are
highly polymorphic and the accessions of the species analyzed may have been extreme in the range of variation
found at each analyzed locus.
An analysis of the cross-transferability of microsatellite
loci in Vitaceae showed that microsatellite repeats were
present in most of the species examined and that flanking
sequences were conserved and could be used to examine
evolutionary relationships [35]. The potential usefulness

of flanking regions to assess taxonomic relationship in
Arachis was not approached in this study. However, our
results indicate that these regions could be useful for
establishing genetic relationship in Arachis, since the relationship established based on amplification events (Figure 2), which depend on the conservation of the flanking
regions, agreed with the division of the species of Arachis
section into genomes A and B.
Some species had more than one fragment amplified
using some primer pairs, including accessions of the diploid species A. simpsonii, A. aff. cardenasii, A. linearifolia, A.
hermannii, and A. pseudovillosa, which showed more than
one fragment using Ah21 (Table 4). These results suggested that the accessions of the above species were heterozygous. Arachis species were expected to be homozygous
since they are considered to be autogamous simply by
analogy to cultivated peanut [36]. In addition, these species are diploid, a fact that excludes the possibility of exist-

ence of two homozygous loci with different alleles, as
observed for Ah21 and Ah30 in A. hypogaea, which is an
allotetraploid (Table 3). The data suggested that cross-pollination happens in some Arachis species. Evidences of
cross-pollination in A. duranensis were found when different accessions were analyzed using RFLP [37]. The extensive polymorphism detected within accessions of A.
cardenasii using cDNA and seed storage proteins probes
[5,38,39] has also been suggested to be related to high frequency of cross-pollination. As polymorphic codominant
markers, microsatellites are useful tools to analyze the
mating system of wild species of Arachis.

Conclusion
These results show that microsatellite primer pairs of A.
hypogaea have multiple uses. A higher level of variation
among A. hypogaea accessions is detected using microsatellite markers in comparison to other markers, such as
RFLP, RAPD and AFLP. The microsatellite primer pairs of

A. hypogaea showed high transferability rate to other species of the genus. These primer pairs are useful tools to
evaluate the genetic variability and to assess the mating
system among Arachis species.

Methods
Plant material
Sixteen accessions of A. hypogaea and 38 accessions of species from eight of the nine sections of the genus Arachis
were analyzed (Table 3). The samples were obtained from
Arachis Germplasm Bank (EMBRAPA Recursos Genéticos
e Biotecnologia – Brasília, DF, Brazil).
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted using the procedure of Grattapaglia
and Sederoff [40]. The quality of the DNA was checked on
1% agarose gels and the DNA concentrations were estimated spectrophotometrically (Genesys 5 – Spectronic
Instruments).
Library construction and primer design
Nine micrograms of genomic DNA from A. hypogaea were
digested using 1.35 μl of HaeIII (10 U/μl), 2 μl of AluI (10
U/μl) and 1 μl of RsaI (10 U/μl) (New England Biolabs).
The reaction products were electrophoresed on 1% low
melting point agarose gels and fragments 200–600 bp in
size were excised from the gel, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and ligated into pBluescript (Stratagene). The
ligated clones were used to transform Escherichia coli XL1blue MRF' (Stratagene). The library was amplified overnight at 30°C with shaking (300 rpm) and the plasmids

then isolated by phenol extraction. The library was
enriched for AC and AG repeats using a GeneTrapper®
cDNA positive selection system (Invitrogen). The selected
clones were used to transform XL1-blue MRF' bacterial
cells. The white colonies were grown overnight in LB-liquid medium supplemented ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The
plasmids were extracted using a Concert® rapid plasmid
purification system (Invitrogen). Sequencing was done
using T3 and T7 primers. The sequencing reaction mixture
consisted of 2 μl of plasmid DNA, 2 μl of Big Dye terminator, 8 pmol of primer and water to a final volume of 10
μl. Sequencing was carried out in an ABI Prism 377
sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The primers were
designed using Primer3 software [41].
PCR
Fourteen primer pairs were used for PCR amplification,
being 13 designed using the sequences selected in the
above step and one reported by Hopkins and colleagues
[15] (Table 4). Each amplification reaction contained 1 U
of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 1 × amplification
buffer (200 mM Tris pH 8.4, 500 mM KCl), 200 μM of
each dNTP, 1.5–2.5 mM MgCl2 (Table 2), 0.2 μM of each
primer, 15 ng genomic DNA, and water to a final volume
of 17 μl. The following thermocycling conditions were
used: 1 cycle: 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles: 94°C for 30 s, ×
°C for 45 s and 72°C for 1 min, and a final cycle: 72°C for
10 min. The annealing temperatures (X) and MgCl2 concentrations were optimized for each pair of primers to
allow amplification in the wild species. The amplifications were done in a PTC100 thermocycler (MJ Research).

Electrophoresis
The sequence variation in A. hypogaea and two wild diploid species (A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis) was analyzed
using 4% denaturating polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 7 M urea) that were silver stained.
The sizes of the fragments were estimated based on a 10
bp ladder (Invitrogen).

The PCR products obtained using DNA from wild species
were electrophoresed on 3% metaphor (FMC Bioproducts) agarose gels for 3 h at 120 V. The agarose gels were
stained with ethidium bromide and PCR products viewed
under UV light. The size of fragments was estimated based
on a 100 bp ladder (GE).
Analysis of variation in A. hypogaea
The allelic and genotypic frequencies were calculated for
the samples analyzed. The genetic variability of the sample as a whole was estimated based on the number of alleles per locus (total number of alleles/number of loci), the
percentage of polymorphic loci (number of polymorphic
loci/total number of loci analyzed) and Polymorphism

Information Content (PIC = 1 -

∑ Pi2 − ∑ ∑ Pi2Pj2 ).
i =1

i =1 j=i +1

Analysis of the locus cross-species transferability
The cross-species transferability of eight loci was evaluated using 37 accessions of 37 species from eight sections
of the genus Arachis. The percentage of transferability was
calculated for each locus for section Arachis (22 species)
and for the whole sample (37 species) as the number of
species in which the expected fragment was detected/the
total number of species analyzed. A binary matrix based
on the amplification events for section Arachis alone was

prepared based on the data in Table 4. In this matrix, 1
indicated amplification and 0, no amplification. A genetic
distance matrix was calculated using the Nei and Li distance [42] and a dendrogram was constructed using the
UPGMA method (unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic mean) [43].
Sequencing of PCR products and sequence analysis
The PCR products obtained using the pair of primers for
locus Ah11 and DNA of 18 species (A. batizocoi A. burkartii, A. cardenasii, A. decora, A. duranensis, A. guaranitica, A.
hoehnei, A. hypogaea, A. ipaënsis, A. kempff-mercadoi, A.
kuhlmannii, A. macedoi, A. magna, A. paraguariensis, A.
repens, A. subcoriacea, A. triseminata and A. valida) were
purified using the Concert® Rapid PCR purification system
(Invitrogen). The sequencing reaction mixture had a total
volume of 10 μl: 2 μl of purified PCR product, 2 μl of Big
Dye Terminator, 6 pmol of one primer, and 5.4 μl of
water. The sequencing cycle consisted of 25 cycles of 96°C
for 45 s, 55°C for 55 s, and 60°C for 4 min. The reactions
were run in a PTC 100 cycler (MJ Research) followed by
sequencing in an ABI Prism 377 sequencer. The sequences
were edited using the Sequencer program (version 3.1)
(GeneCodes). Sequence alignment and a neighbor-joining tree were obtained using Clustal X (version 1.8) [44].
