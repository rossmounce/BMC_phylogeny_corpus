PhyDesign: an online application for profiling
phylogenetic informativeness
Francesc López-Giráldez* and Jeffrey P Townsend*

Abstract
Background: The rapid increase in number of sequenced genomes for species across of the tree of life is
revealing a diverse suite of orthologous genes that could potentially be employed to inform molecular
phylogenetic studies that encompass broader taxonomic sampling. Optimal usage of this diversity of loci requires
user-friendly tools to facilitate widespread cost-effective locus prioritization for phylogenetic sampling. The
Townsend (2007) phylogenetic informativeness provides a unique empirical metric for guiding marker selection.
However, no software or automated methodology to evaluate sequence alignments and estimate the phylogenetic
informativeness metric has been available.
Results: Here, we present PhyDesign, a platform-independent online application that implements the Townsend
(2007) phylogenetic informativeness analysis, providing a quantitative prediction of the utility of loci to solve
specific phylogenetic questions. An easy-to-use interface facilitates uploading of alignments and ultrametric trees to
calculate and depict profiles of informativeness over specified time ranges, and provides rankings of locus
prioritization for epochs of interest.
Conclusions: By providing these profiles, PhyDesign facilitates locus prioritization increasing the efficiency of
sequencing for phylogenetic purposes compared to traditional studies with more laborious and low capacity
screening methods, as well as increasing the accuracy of phylogenetic studies. Together with a manual and sample
files, the application is freely accessible at http://phydesign.townsend.yale.edu.

Background
Due to advances in sequencing technologies and
decreasing costs, the number of genomes sequenced for
species across the tree of life is increasing dramatically.
Tools and databases for selecting single-copy orthologous loci [1,2] and designing successful primers for
them [3,4] are available. However, orthology assessments
for multiple genomes can provide thousands of candidate loci to sequence, and yet only a few of those have
been commonly used as markers for phylogenetic studies [5]. To address the challenge of locus selection for
sequencing in designing a phylogenetic study, Townsend
[6] proposed a metric that provides a quantitative prediction of phylogenetic signal across historical times.
Based on estimates of rates across sites, the phylogenetic
informativeness metric facilitates prioritization of loci
even when the taxa of interest have never been

Haven, Connecticut, USA

sequenced for a given locus. To estimate phylogenetic
informativeness, prior data on the molecular evolutionary pattern of a locus is required. This prior information
may be derived from three potential sources: 1) preliminary data on the candidate loci from a well-studied
subset of the taxa of interest; 2) data on the candidate
loci from a well-studied sister clade; or 3) comparative
genomic data from sequenced genomes within and/or
outside the clade of interest. Using this information for
a number of classic and recent data sets for different
time scales, the method successfully recapitulates the
qualitative utility of loci [6-10]. However, no software or
automated methodology to apply the phylogenetic informativeness metric has been available.
To facilitate wider application of phylogenetic informativeness analysis, we have developed the online application PhyDesign. PhyDesign features:
• Online accessibility, platform independence, and
immediate access to software updates.

Firefox, Chrome and Safari. Although graphical representations of phylogenetic informativeness profiles are typically best kept to lower numbers of loci for purposes of
display, PhyDesign was able to profile and produce quantitative results for 2000 loci of a length of 1000 bp each.
For a higher volume of data, a Perl module to calculate
the profiles is available for download.

PhyDesign is freely accessible online at http://phydesign.townsend.yale.edu. A manual and sample files to be
used with the application, as well as a FAQ section, can
be also found at the site. In addition, the source code
and a Perl module to calculate the profiles are available
for download.

Implementation
To estimate phylogenetic informativeness profiles [6],
the PhyDesign application consists of 3 components:
1. A form to upload information and choose an
application to calculate the evolutionary rates for
each alignment site.
2. A table listing the evolutionary rate results.
3. A graphical interface to plot the phylogenetic profiles and calculate integration values.
On the client-side, these components of PhyDesign
are coded in JavaScript/AJAX using jQuery libraries,
facilitating dynamic communication between the server
and the user without page reloading. Online input
undergoes validation to detect possible errors before
engaging the next step in the process. To communicate
validation success or failure and its causes, unobtrusive
temporary message boxes are featured. In addition, the
web site uses modal windows to provide optional
advanced settings. On the server-side, PhyDesign is
implemented as a collection of Perl scripts and modules,
integrated with third-party software used to calculate
the evolutionary rates for each site in the alignment.
To run, PhyDesign requires at minimum an internet
browser equipped with JavaScript, and SVG for the graphical output. The latest versions of major modern browsers have native support for JavaScript and for rendering
SVG markup directly. Internet Explorer 8 and older versions require a plug-in to render SVG content. SVG format, as vector graphics format, is resolution-independent
and easy to edit for final publication with common vector
graphic editors such as Adobe Illustrator (commercially
available) and Inkscape (open source). The online application has been tested as rendered by Internet Explorer,

Input form

To obtain the site rate distributions for each locus, two
data entries are needed: (1) an alignment of loci of interest, pruned to contain a set of taxa for which the tree
topology is fairly well known, and (2) an ultrametric tree
for those taxa. The ultrametric tree can be a chronogram
(an ultrametric tree with branch lengths proportional to
time). Alternatively, branch lengths can be in unspecified
molecular evolutionary units. PhyDesign reads amino
acid and DNA alignments in NEXUS, FASTA, and Phylip
formats, and trees in NEXUS and Newick formats. Formats are carefully checked via custom and BioPerl modules [11]. Data partitioning is permitted via NEXUS
format. Once files are uploaded and checked, PhyDesign
provides an interface for selecting and parameterizing
any one of several third-party programs that estimate the
site rates - HyPhy [12], DNArates [Olsen, unpublished]
and Rate4site [13]. DNArates and Rate4site are called by
the application “as is"; a de novo HyPhy script was implemented to estimate rates under the full diversity of timereversible models. Due to the ability to specify of the evolutionary model and its parameters, HyPhy is the recommended and default option for DNA sequences. For
amino acid sequences, Rate4site is available. To facilitate
extensive analyses of large datasets, a link to the rates
results is sent by email. A site rate file with the proper
formatting will be generated after analysis of the alignments and the corresponding ultrametric tree. Supplied
alignments are deleted from the server immediately after
the site rates are calculated, and the site rate results are
stored in the server for 24 hours. During this time, results
can only be accessed by the link submitted. It is convenient, then, to save the site rate file for future use. Alternatively, if the rate distribution for each locus is known,
PhyDesign also accepts direct supply of these rates to
obtain the phylogenetic informativeness profiles.

Results and Discussion
Output of rate vectors

The first result provided features a table with basic
information about each locus analyzed, including the
program used to analyze the rates, locus length, the
number of sites for which a substitution rate could be
calculated, and the number of faulty sites for which this
calculation was not possible. Two files are offered as
downloads: (1) a compressed file containing individual

rate files for each locus, and (2) a single file containing
rate site vectors for all loci. The latter can be downloaded for future uploading in the rate vectors form,
eliminating the need to repeat rate calculations. Partitions to be profiled and the colors for representing them
may then be specified interactively.

quantitative measures of informativeness. Two graphs
are shown in the main section: the ultrametric tree and,
aligned to it, the phylogenetic informativeness profiles
(Figure 1).
These graphs can be readily downloaded in manipulable SVG format as displayed. In addition, a downloadable spreadsheet file with the profile data points is
provided in the left panel, so that profiles can be
replotted or reanalyzed with diverse software. The left
panel facilitates further customization of the plots,

Profiles and area calculations

The second result provided is a graphical representation
of phylogenetic informativeness and calculations of

Figure 1 Screenshot of PhyDesign. Phylogenetic informativeness profiles are shown for five loci, aligned to a corresponding chronogram. The
side bar is the interface through which the user can select loci and colors, adjust the range of time values, integrate over different epochs, and
download the results.

including selection of loci to display, colors of profiles,
adjustment of the range of time values, integration
over different epochs, and downloading of the results.
Integrating phylogenetic informativeness over specific
epochs provides a metric for ranking loci. Integration
values will be largest for the loci that have the highest
probability of substitution in the given epoch that will
not be obscured by subsequent evolution. Note, however, that phylogenetic informativeness plots display
predicted signal and do not account for phylogenetic
noise (homoplasy) caused by convergence or parallelism in divergent lineages. Thus, quantitative results
should be thoughtfully considered in light of homoplasy that is likely to arise, significantly diminishing
utility during epochs deeper than the peak of informativeness for a given profile. All informativeness values
can be calculated on a net or per site basis. While the
net phylogenetic informativeness quantifies signal as a
whole, it is more subject to phylogenetic noise [14,15]
than is phylogenetic informativeness per site, which
maximizes both informativeness and cost-effectiveness,
and more effectively minimizes noise. It also of conceptual interest to characterize the phylogenetic informativeness per site to compare relative power of genes
without the confounding influence of gene length.
A combination of shorter genes with a sequencing
effort equal to that of a longer gene can lead to better
results.

Conclusions
By providing these profiles, PhyDesign facilitates locus
prioritization, increasing the efficiency of sequencing for
phylogenetic purposes compared to traditional studies
with more laborious and low capacity screening methods, as well as increasing the accuracy of phylogenetic
studies. Future website implementations will include the
latest theoretical advances developed in our research
group, expanding the current phylogenetic informativeness methodology to quantify the effects of parallelism
and convergence, as well as quantifying the utility of
taxon addition [16].
