Abstract
Background: During the last two decades, DNA sequencing has led to the identification of numerous genes in
key species; however, in most cases, their functions are still unknown. In this situation, reverse genetics is the most
suitable method to assign function to a gene. TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a reversegenetic strategy that combines random chemical mutagenesis with high-throughput discovery of the induced
mutations in target genes. The method has been applied to a variety of plant and animal species. Screening of the
induced mutations is the most important step in TILLING. Currently, direct sequencing or nuclease-mediated
screening of heteroduplexes is widely used for detection of mutations in TILLING. Both methods are useful, but the
costs are substantial and turnaround times are relatively long. Thus, there is a need for an alternative method that
is of higher throughput and more cost effective.
Results: In this study, we developed a high resolution melting (HRM) assay and evaluated its effectiveness for
screening ENU-induced mutations in a medaka TILLING library. We had previously screened mutations in the p53
gene by direct sequencing. Therefore, we first tested the efficiency of the HRM assay by screening mutations in
p53, which indicated that the HRM assay is as useful as direct sequencing. Next, we screened mutations in the atr
and atm genes with the HRM assay. Nonsense mutations were identified in each gene, and the phenotypes of
these nonsense mutants confirmed their loss-of-function nature.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the HRM assay is useful for screening mutations in TILLING.
Furthermore, the phenotype of the obtained mutants indicates that medaka is an excellent animal model for
investigating genome stability and gene function, especially when combined with TILLING.

Background
Our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying
most biological processes has been transformed by the
systematic application of mutational analysis. Traditionally, forward genetics, driven by the identification of
mutant phenotypes, has been the most widely used
approach. On the other hand, genome sequencing projects over the past few decades have identified numerous
genes in key species, and the completion of these
sequences produced a situation in which most of the

genes are known, but most of their phenotypes are
obscure. In this situation, reverse genetics, which provides targeted inactivation of genes identified by
sequence analysis followed by phenotype analysis of the
mutant, has become an important tool for many biologists. In mice, reverse genetics is usually carried out
using homologous recombination in embryonic stem
cells, which allow a precise mutation to be constructed
in nearly any gene. However, embryonic stem cells are
only available in a limited number of organisms. Thus, a
general method that is applicable to many organisms
would be in great demand, and several approaches have
been tried.
One of these approaches is TILLING (Targeting
Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes). TILLING is a

reverse-genetic strategy that combines random chemical
mutagenesis with high-throughput discovery of the
induced mutations in target genes. The method is general and, following its original application to the model
plant Arabidopsis thaliana [1,2], has been applied to a
variety of plant and animal species including maize,
lotus, barley, wheat, Drosophila, zebrafish, and medaka
[3-9]. The first step in TILLING is chemical mutagenesis. For mutagenesis in animals, males are mutagenized
using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and then used to
generate a large population of F1 animals that consequently harbor many random heterozygous mutations in
their genomes. Next, the DNA from these animals is
analyzed for mutations in a specific gene of interest.
Once a mutation is identified, homozygous mutant animals can be obtained by crossing progeny from heterozygous F1 matings.
Among the vertebrates, small laboratory fish are suitable for the study of gene function due to their ease of
handling, large numbers of progeny per generation, and,
in particular, their translucent embryos. In many species,
embryos develop outside the mother’s body, enabling
easy visual inspection and manipulation of their tissues
and cells. One such fish is the zebrafish, Danio rerio,
which is the most widely used laboratory fish. The success of forward genetics in the past two decades has
established the zebrafish as the premier vertebrate for
the study of gene function. Medaka, Oryzias latipes, is
another small laboratory fish that has been used as an
experimental model animal since the 1920s. Medaka has
a small genome size (one-half of that of zebrafish) and
is phylogenetically distinct from zebrafish, having
diverged about 110 million years ago [10], making it
useful for comparisons of conserved and divergent gene
function in teleost evolution. For these reasons, both the
zebrafish and medaka are currently widely used in comparative mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and genomic
instability studies. Shimada and Shima [11] showed that
the mutation response of the medaka male germ cell is
comparable to that of the mouse, and therefore medaka
could serve as a vertebrate model system of DNA
damage response in germ cells.
All cells have elaborate mechanisms to protect their
genomes. DNA can be damaged by reactive metabolic
byproducts and by environmental mutagens, and the
response to DNA damage and its repair are crucial for
cell viability and disease prevention. The DNA-damage
response is a signal-transduction pathway that coordinates cell-cycle transitions, DNA replication, DNA
repair, and apoptosis [12,13]. The major regulators of
the DNA-damage response are two protein kinases,
ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM and
Rad3-related (ATR) [14-17]. These two large kinases
have significant sequence homology and play important

Page 2 of 17

roles in the initiation of cell cycle checkpoints by targeting an overlapping set of substrates that promote cellcycle arrest and DNA repair [18]. Another key player
that mediates cell cycle checkpoints is the tumor suppressor p53, which is activated and stabilized by ATM
and serves as a transcription factor for the downstream
cell cycle regulator [19]. The p53 pathway depends on
the transcription of its downstream genes and its activity
is therefore delayed after DNA damage. Thus, its role
lies in the maintenance of the cell cycle checkpoint.
The most widely used reverse genetics’ tool in zebrafish and medaka is undoubtedly morpholinos, but they
are not used as a substitute for mutations because they
can only be used in transient methods and for early
developmental stages. Recently, TILLING was applied to
zebrafish, and several mutants have been described [8].
The success of this reverse genetics approach in zebrafish allowed us to apply TILLING to medaka. Once
males have been mutagenizaed with ENU, the TILLING
procedure can be divided into two steps, construction of
a library and screening of the library. The library consists of pair sets of genomic DNA and frozen sperm of
F1 offspring from each ENU-mutagenized male. We
established a medaka TILLING library from 5771 F1
male fish derived from ENU-mutagenized G0 [9,20].
In the next screening step, two methods are widely
used for the detection of mutations, direct sequencing
[9] and CelI nuclease-mediated screening for heteroduplex formation with wild-type and mutant alleles [2].
Both methods are effective; however, costs are substantial and turnaround time is relatively long. These disadvantages have resulted in the development of alternative
methods that are more cost effective, faster, and easier
to perform. The high resolution melting (HRM) analysis
is a recently developed, promising technology used for
the detection of variations in DNA [21,22]. It is an intube method that can be performed in a fast, cheap, and
robust manner. The thermal stability of a DNA fragment is determined by its base sequence. When the
DNA fragment contains an altered sequence, the duplex
stability is changed, leading to different melting behavior, which can be identified with HRM analysis. During
HRM analysis, melting curves are produced using intercalating DNA dyes that fluoresce in the presence of
double-stranded DNA and a specialized instrument
designed to monitor fluorescence during heating [23,24].
When the temperature increases, the DNA-intercalating
dye is released from the DNA and the fluorescence
decreases. This process produces a characteristic melting
profile that can be monitored with precision. Changes in
the sequence within the DNA fragment, as in SNPs or
mutations, alter the melting profile. The HRM assay has
successfully been used to detect point mutations in
ethyl methanesulfonate-mutated plant populations [25].

In the present study, we developed HRM assays to
evaluate the effectiveness of this methodology for
screening ENU-induced mutations in the TILLING
library. We first used the HRM assay to screen mutations in exons 5 and 6 of the p53 gene because the
same library was previously screened with the direct
sequencing method [9], enabling comparison of the two
methods. We detected mutations in exons 5 and 6 of
p53 with efficiency equivalent to that of the direct
sequencing method. Then we screened for mutations in
the atr and atm genes. We identified 15 mutations in
atr and 11 in atm, including one nonsense mutation in
each gene. The phenotypes of these nonsense mutants
confirmed their loss-of-function nature. The results
demonstrate the utility of the HRM assay for mutant
screening using TILLING.

Results
Screening of mutations in p53 gene

To evaluate whether the HRM assay is applicable to the
screening of a TILLING library, we first used it to screen
in exons 5 and 6 of the p53 gene (Fig. 1) and compared
the results with those obtained previously by screening
the same library with direct sequencing [9]. The p53
HRM assay yielded 5 HRM-positive samples that

displayed aberrant melting curves. To magnify the
changes in the contour of the melting curve, subtraction
plots are generated from the melting curve by subtracting
the test curve from that of the wild type (see Materials
and Methods). Examples of the melting curves and subtraction plots are shown in Figs. 1B and 1C, respectively.
Subsequent sequencing of the positive samples revealed
mutations (Table 1) that were correctly identified by the
HRM assay except for three mutations, N220D, E241X,
and a splicing site mutation (Table 2). Of these, E241X
and the splicing site mutation were located close to the
end of the primer used for PCR amplification (Additional
file 1, Fig. S1). A previous report demonstrated that the
sensitivity (error rate) of HRM scanning does not depend
on the position of the mutation within the PCR product
when the mutations are positioned more than 50 bp
from each end [26], but our result shows a lower sensitivity for mutations located near the end of the PCR products. Interestingly, the HRM assay identified two
additional mutations, an intronic mutation and S222X,
which were not identified by the previous sequencing
method. The sensitivity of the HRM assay was 62% (5/8),
which is considerably lower than the 75% (6/8) for the
sequencing. However, when the PCR primers were
designed far enough from each end of the target exon,

the sensitivity improved to 83% (5/6), which is adequate
for screening the TILLING library.
Screening of mutations in atr and atm genes

We next performed the HRM assay to screen for mutations in the atr and atm genes for each of 4 different
amplicons covering 6 and 5 exons, respectively (Figs. 2,
3 and Additional file 2, Table S1). After subsequent
sequencing of HRM-positive PCR amplicons, we identified 23 independent mutations in atr and 27 in atm
(Tables 1 and 3). Figs. 2 and 3 show melting curves and
subtraction plots from the HRM assay of PCR amplicons with amino-acid-substitution-type mutations. We
retrieved highly likely loss-of-function mutations for
each gene by screening for nonsense mutations, and
found point mutations in exon 24 of atr and in exon 9
of atm that created premature stop codons in the proteins (S1339X and S444X for atr and atm, respectively).
These two exons were well conserved when compared
with the corresponding exons of mammals and teleost
atr or atm genes (see Figs. 4A and 8A). To demonstrate
their loss-of-function nature, heterozygotes obtained by
artificial insemination were backcrossed twice to wildtype fish, and then homozygous mutants for each mutation were established by mutual crossing of the
heterozygotes.
atr is required for cellular proliferation

In mice, Atr is essential for early embryonic development, and Atr -/- embryos die in early developmental

stages [27,28]. To test whether atr is also essential for
development in medaka, we generated homozygous atrdeficient fishes by intercrossing atr+/S1339X fishes and
determined their viability. Surprisingly, atrS1339X/S1339X
embryos developed and hatched successfully. No apparent abnormality was observed under the stereomicroscope in the atr S1339X/S1339X embryo during
development. The hatched fry survived at rates similar
to the wild-type and atr+/S1339X fishes for 15 days after
fertilization; however, they subsequently started to die
gradually, and none of the atrS1339X/S1339X mutants was
as alive at day 30 after fertilization (Fig. 5). The growth
of the hatched atr S1339X/S1339X fry was slightly poorer
than that of the wild type (average body height of
atr S1339X/S1339X fry = 0.48 mm at day 15, which is
shorter than 0.58 mm of atr+/+or atr+/S1339X; Additional
file 3, Fig. S2); this was associated with a high rate of
generalized edema, followed by death on days 20-25.
These results indicate that atrS1339X mutation produces milder phenotype in medaka than in mice. However, we also have to consider possible involvement of
undetected ENU-induced mutations in the phenotype
observed for atrS1339X/S1339X mutant. We cannot exclude
possibility that undetected ENU-induced mutations still
remain after several backcrossing to wild type fish and
the remaining mutation affect the phenotype.
These viable fry were used to verify the knockout phenotype. We could not confirm the knockout phenotype
at the protein level in the atr S1339X/S1339X , due to the
lack of an appropriate anti-ATR antibody that

recognizes the medaka protein. However, we were able
to show the knockout phenotype by quantitative PCR.
Quantitative PCR was carried out using two sets of PCR
primers; each was designed to amplify the 5’ or 3’ region
of the atr transcript. Both primer sets yielded the same
results. The atr transcript levels decreased to ~70% of
the wild-type for heterozygous mutants and ~40% for
homozygous mutants, presumably due to nonsensemediated decay of the transcript containing the premature stop codon (Fig. 4C). Finally, we confirmed the
nonsense mutation in the transcript by sequencing the
cDNA from the homozygous mutant (Fig. 4B).
The atmS444X mutant is sensitive to radiation, but
partially infertile

Patients with the recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia
and atm-deficient mice are sensitive to ionizing radiation [15,29-31]. To determine the radiosensitivity of the
atmS444X/S444X mutant, we established culture cell lines
from atm+/+, atm+/S444X, or atmS444X/S444X embryos and
determined their radiosensitivities by their ability to
form colonies. As expected, atm S444X/S444X cells displayed increased sensitivity to X-rays, as manifested by a

profound fall in survival rate with increased exposure
dose (Fig. 6).
Another apparent phenotype of Atm-deficient mice is
infertility due to severe disruption of gametogenesis in
both males and females [29-31]. To determine the fertility of fish homozygous for the atm disruption, we
mated mutant and wild-type fish. However, surprisingly,
both male and female atmS444X/S444X fish were only partially infertile. When mated with wild-type males, 25%
of atmS444X/S444X females spawned eggs. The number of
spawned eggs was normal and almost all the fertilized
eggs developed normally. In contrast, when mated with
wild-type females, 57% of atm S444X/S444X males were
able to fertilize the eggs, but the fertilization rate was
extremely low compared with the wild type. On average,
the fertilization rate of atmS444X/S444X males was 1.16%
versus 93.4% in the wild-type male. Histological examination of ovaries from wild-type adult females showed
oocytes at various phases of development (Fig. 7A, top
panels). In contrast, ovaries of infertile mutants contained no mature oocytes and disorganized interstitial
cells (Fig. 7A, bottom panels), whereas those from the
fertile mutant fish showed normally developed oocytes,

similar to the wild type (Fig. 7A, middle panels). Interestingly, ovaries of the infertile mutant seemed to have
hyperplastic germ cell-clusters among the disorganized
interstitial cells. The cell-clusters resembled cysts
formed by several rounds of pre-meiotic divisions in
normal development [32]. Differences in testicular structure were also observed between the wild type and
mutants (Fig. 7B). The normal testicular architecture of
the wild type showed the presence of cells in all stages

of spermatogenesis (e.g., spermatogonia, spermatocytes,
spermatids, and mature sperm in the lobules (Fig. 7B,
top panels)). The testes of the infertile mutants contained spermatogonia and spermatocytes, but not spermatids or sperm (Fig. 7B, bottom panels). The testes of
fertile mutant fish contained cells in all stages of spermatogenesis, but the spermatids and sperm were abnormal in size; in the testes of the wild-type fish all
spermatids and sperm were quite uniform in size, but

they varied in size in the testes of the mutant fish (more
than 50% of the cells were larger than those in wild-type
male, Fig. 7B, right panels). These results suggest the
presence of a unique damage response mechanism in
medaka. However, as in the case of the atrS1339X/S1339X
mutant, we also have to consider possible involvement
of undetected ENU-induced mutations in the phenotype
observed for atmS444X/S444X mutant. We cannot exclude
possibility that undetected ENU-induced mutations still
remain after several backcrossing to wild type fish and
the remaining mutation affect the phenotype.
We next examined the knockout phenotype of atmS444X/
S444X
by quantitative PCR. Interestingly, the 5’ and 3’ PCR
primer set yielded different quantitative values. The level
of atm transcript determined by quantitative PCR using
the 3’ primer set was ~66% of the wild-type in heterozygous mutants and ~27% in homozygous mutants (Fig. 8C,
gray bars). The decrease was even more pronounced when
the 5’ PCR primer was used: ~50% of wild type in heterozygous mutants and ~7% in homozygous mutants (Fig. 8C
black bars). Furthermore, the S444X mutant allele was not
detected in the cDNA obtained from atm+/S444X cells, as
confirmed by sequencing, although both S444X and S444
wild alleles were detected in the genomic DNA (Fig.
8Batm+/S444X). These results suggest that transcripts containing the S444X mutation remain at very low levels in
atmS444X/S444X cells due to extensive decay of the transcript containing the premature stop codon, but atm transcripts containing the 3’ region still remain at substantial

levels in the same cells. In fact, amplification of the cDNA
fragment containing the S446X mutation (exon 9) of
atmS444X/S444X cells was very difficult. Only after three
repeated nested PCRs we were able to obtain sufficient
PCR product for sequencing (Fig. 8BatmS444X/S444X). One
possible explanation for the difference between the 5’ and
3’ quantitative PCR is the presence of a short transcript
that lacks the N-terminal coding region involving the S444
coding site but contains the 3’ atm coding region. To test
this possibility and to determine which region of the atm

transcript is present in atmS444X/S444X cells, we amplified
several exons in the atm gene by RT-PCR using cDNA
from the wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous
mutant cells. We successfully amplified cDNA fragments
containing exons 14-17, exons 19-20, and exons 55-56 in
cDNA from all type of cells, whereas cDNA fragments
containing exons 7-10 and exons 12-15 could not be
amplified in cDNA from atmS444X/S444X cells, suggesting
the presence of a short transcript that starts from the
region around exon 12-13 (Fig. 9). Consistent with this

notion, we found a full-length-cDNA clone (DK103188)
starting from exon 13 by searching a full-length-cDNA
database (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/). The starting sequence in the cDNA was also confirmed by 5’ RACE
(data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate
the existence of two atm transcript variants in medaka
cells. These variants encode a longer isoform 1 and a
shorter isoform 2 that has a truncated N-terminus compared to isoform 1.

Discussion
The critical step in the TILLING procedure is the
screening for mutations, but to successfully identify
mutations in the target genes, it is necessary to have an
efficient mutation discovery system. The TILLING
library is constructed from F1s derived from chemical
mutagen-treated G0s, and thus the mutations induced
in each F1 are heterozygous; therefore, methods that
quickly distinguish heteroduplex DNA from the homoduplex counterpart can be applied to the discovery of
these mutations. HRM was recently introduced as a
screening method for mutation detection and reported
to be useful for heteroduplex detection [21,22]. It is an
in-tube method that can be performed in a fast, cheap,
and robust manner. To evaluate the HRM assay as an
alternative mutation screening method for TILLING, in
this report we used the HRM assay to screen a total of
17.3 Mb in a medaka TILLING library. We identified 55
independent mutations (Table 1) and found that the
average mutation frequency of the library was 1 mutation per 314 kb. The value is slightly higher than that
obtained by direct sequencing the same library; 1 mutation per 345 kb [9]. The higher rate of mutation detection by the HRM assay relative to that by the direct

sequencing method is unexpected because direct
sequencing is the gold standard for identifying mutations and thus would be expected to detect mutations
more efficiently than any other method. Misclassification
of SNPs by the HRM assay might be the reason for the
discrepancy. The genomic DNA library used contains a
substantial level of SNPs. When the same base change
was identified more than twice, it was classified not as a
mutation but as a SNP (see Materials and Methods). In
the HRM assay, screening was carried out using 96-well
PCR plates. Melting curve analysis was performed on
each plate, but comparison between plates could not be
performed. If one type of SNP appeared only once in
one plate and appeared more than twice in other plates,
the former was misclassified as a mutation and confirmed by sequencing, whereas the latter were correctly
classified as SNPs and not subjected to checking by
sequencing. However, misclassification could not have
been common because the mutation detection rate was
only slightly higher in the HRM assay than in the direct
sequencing method. Despite this issue of classification,
our results demonstrate the utility of the HRM assay for
the screening of mutations in the TILLING library.
In this report, we used the HRM assay to identify
medaka mutants producing truncated forms of the
ATM or ATR proteins, atmS444X and atrS1339X,
respectively. Atm and Atr orchestrate overlapping DNA
damage responses to different forms of DNA strand discontinuities. However, knockout mouse models have
also suggested that Atr, in contrast to Atm, is essential
for viability, and that Atr-null mice die at an early
embryonic stage [27,28]. Interestingly, atrS1339X/S1339X
medaka can continue normal development during
embryogenesis and hatch successfully, but the hatched

Ishikawa et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/70

fry all die before day 30 postfertilization. We tried to
establish a culture cell line from atr S1339X/S1339X
embryos, but the cells died within a few weeks and no
cell line was obtained (data not shown), a finding similar
to results with cells from Atr-null mice [27,28]. It is not
clear at present why atr-deficient embryos can survive
for several weeks; however, the viable atr fry provide a
good model system for analyzing atr function at the
organismal level.
Meiosis is a specialized cell division program to generate hemizygous gametes. An important feature of meiosis is the exchange of genetic information between
maternal and paternal chromatids, a process called
meiotic recombination [33,34]. Meiotic recombination is
initiated by Spo11-catalyzed meiotic DNA double-strand
breaks (DSBs), followed by their repair using an intact
homologous non-sister chromatid [35]. DSBs are highly
hazardous for genome integrity, but meiotic cells deliberately introduce them into their genome in order to
initiate homologous recombination. Therefore, DSBs left
unrepaired are checked by a stringent surveillance
mechanism, the meiotic recombination checkpoint,
which delays meiosis I until DSB repair is completed.
Another important genome surveillance mechanism is
the DNA damage checkpoint, which senses DSBs that
arise at unpredictable locations as a consequence of
DNA damage during both mitosis and meiosis
[13,33,36,37]. Mechanistically, the meiotic recombination checkpoint is related to the DNA damage checkpoint; however, many aspects of the meiotic
recombination checkpoint are considerably less well
understood than those of mitotic DNA damage checkpoint. Given the well established role of ATM in DSB
repair in mitosis, ATM might play an important role in
the signaling and processing of the programmed meiotic
DSBs. In this study, we found defective meiosis in the
medaka atm S444X mutant. The striking difference
between Atm mice and the mutant fish is the fertility of
the latter; the Atm mice are completely infertile,
whereas the mutant fish are partially infertile, and 25%
of females and 57% of males remain fertile. In mice,
Atm deficiency results in early arrest in prophase I followed by apoptotic degeneration, which results in the
complete absence of mature gametes and spermatocytes
in various stages of degeneration [29,30,38]. Similar premeiotic arrest was observed in tissue sections of the
infertile mutant fish, but the spermatocytes did not
show any stage of degeneration (Fig. 7B). Instead, a high
percentage of abnormally large spermatids and/or sperm
were noted in the testes of the fertile mutants. These
observations suggest that, in medaka, many cells bearing
unrepaired meiotic DSBs are removed by apoptosis, but
a substantial fraction proceed to completion of meiosis,
resulting in the production of abnormal sperm. In fact,

Page 13 of 17

a similar partially sterile phenotype has been reported in
Arabidopsis ATM mutants [39], whose ATM meiocytes
did not appear to undergo apoptosis before the end of
meiosis despite the observed chromosomal fragmentation during anaphase I and II. The histology presented
in the current report suggests that the infertility in atmdeficient medaka is possibly due to disorganized gonads
in both males and females. At present, the precise role
of the meiotic recombination checkpoint defect in atm
medaka in causing the reproductive defects is not clear.
More precise characterization of the abnormal sperm
and oocytes should provide important information
about the meiotic recombination checkpoint in atm
mutant fish.
Finally, we should emphasize again the possible involvement of undetected ENU-induced mutations in the
observed phenotype. The single major drawback of TILLING as a method for reverse genetics is that a mutation
of interest that is identified in any given F1 fish is only
one of many heterozygous mutations in its genome. By
multiplying the estimated size of medaka genome by the
mutation rate detected in the present TILLING genomic
DNA library, an estimate of the number of ENU-induced
mutations per F1 fish is ~2300. More than 80% of these
mutations were removed after backcrossing to wild-type
fish three times, however significant levels of mutations
still remain. As a result, we cannot exclude possibility
that the remaining mutations affect the phenotype. Most
strong evidence for the direct relationship between the
observed phenotype and the mutated gene is the phenotype rescue with the wild-type gene. Further studies
including the phenotype rescue with BAC (Bacterial artificial chromosome) clone, will clarify a possible involvement of these unknown mutations.
ATM contains three domains that are important for its
function, a FAT domain, a protein kinase domain, and a
FATC domain, which are positioned in the C-terminal
half of the protein. In addition to these domains, several
known ATM substrates bind to the substrate binding
site, a region near the N-terminus of the protein [15].
The N-terminus is a crucial region of the ATM because
its deletion inactivates the protein [40,41]. In this study,
we demonstrated the presence of a short atm transcript
variant in medaka cells that encodes an isoform (isoform
2) lacking the N-terminal 767 residues of the full-length
ATM protein. A similar short isoform has also been
reported in human cells (GenBank Accession No. NM
138242 or Ensemble Transcript: ENST00000452508).
These short isoforms lack the substrate binding site and
thus cannot complement the radiosensitivity of atm-deficient mutants. Mutations in ataxia telangiectasia patients
are well characterized: over 200 different ATM mutations
have been described, and approximately 85% of the
mutants reported in ataxia telangiectasia patients are

Methods

ATR or ATM gene revealed one homologous gene each
(Olatr or Olatm, respectively) in the medaka genome and
no paralogous genes. The degrees of conservation with the
human ATR or ATM are 59.4% or 51.9% identity, respectively. Each genomic DNA in the library was amplified by
PCR with gene-specific primers. To design the gene-specific primers, parts of the cDNA sequences of atm and atr
were determined by RT-PCR and used to retrieve the
genomic sequences from two Medaka databases (http://
www.ensembl.org/Oryzias_latipes/index.html and http://
medaka.utgenome.org/). The following 3 criteria were
used for selection of the target exon for each gene: 1) location in the N-terminal region, 2) correspondence to the
region encoding conserved amino acid residues, and 3)
sufficient length (more than 150 base pairs). The first two
criteria were employed to obtain null-function mutants.
The third criterion was selected for high cost performance.
We designed the primer set using Light Scanner Primer
Design software (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT,
USA). The designed primers were further checked for
simulated melting curves using MeltSim 1.0-beta for
Windows (http://bioinformatics.org/meltsim/wiki/).
The primers used are summarized in Additional file 2,
Table S1.

Medaka TILLING Library

PCR

Mutagenesis was carried out as described previously
[9,43]. Briefly, 102 male Kyoto-Cab, a substrain of Cab,
were mutagenized by 3 consecutive treatments every
week with 3 mM ENU (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
One month after the last ENU treatment, 97 surviving
fertile fish were crossed with wild-type females to obtain
the mutagenized F1 male library. The number of offspring produced from a single mutagenized male founder
varied from 1 to 239. The sperm from each F1 medaka
was cryopreserved, as described previously (Medaka
Book, http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/medaka/medakabook/
). After removal of the testes, the fish was kept at -80°C
until DNA was extracted. The posterior half of the fish
was incubated overnight at 55°C in lysis buffer containing
10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 120
mM sodium chloride, 12 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.0),
1% SDS, and 200 μg/mL proteinase K. The lysate was
extracted with phenol and precipitated with isopropanol.
The DNA pellet was dissolved in 1 mL TE (10 mM Tris
pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The concentration was
adjusted to 4 ng/μL, aliquoted into 96-deep-well plates,
and stored at -20°C. Finally, sets of frozen sperm and
genomic DNA were prepared from 5771 F1 males and
used as the TILLING library.

PCR reactions were performed in 96-well microtiter
plates in 7-μL volumes. Reactions included 7 ng of
genomic DNA in 1 × KOD Plus PCR buffer (Toyobo,
Tokyo), with 1 mM MgSO4, 200 μM of deoxynucleotide
triphosphate, 0.6 × LC Green PLUS (Idaho Technology),
0.14 U of KOD Plus polymerase (Toyobo, Tokyo), and
300 nM of each primer. DMSO (10% vol/vol) was added
when the amplified region was GC-rich. Reactions were
overlaid with 10 μL of mineral oil (Nacalai, Kyoto,
Japan), the plates were centrifuged (1500 × g for 3 min),
and PCR was performed in an iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) or PXE0.2 Thermal Cycler
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The cycling and melting conditions were set as follows: one cycle of 94°C for
2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 94°C for 15 seconds;
a primer-specific annealing temperature for 25 seconds,
and then 68°C for 25 seconds; and a final denaturing
and re-annealing step (one cycle of 94°C for 30 seconds
followed by rapid cooling to 28°C. The final step was
included to redistribute DNA strands derived from
mutant and wild-type alleles in order to maximize
heteroduplex formation.

predicted to truncate the protein, but the mutations are
mapped uniformly over the gene, which includes the
N-terminal region truncated in the short isoform [41,42].
Therefore, at present we do not know the function of the
short isoform, and there is no answer to why the short
isoform is conserved in both human and fish. However,
the medaka atmS444X/S444X mutant provides an excellent
model for analyzing the function of this short atm
isoform.

Conclusions
In the present study we demonstrate that the HRM assay
is useful for screening mutations in TILLING. The present
study also demonstrates that mutations in medaka atr
affect viability and in atm affect fertility and radiosensitivity, similar to findings in mice and humans. However, the
phenotypes of these mutants show milder effects in
medaka than in mammals. On the basis of our results and
those of others, we conclude that medaka is a useful
model for the analysis of genome stability, and can be
used to complement studies in zebrafish, mouse and
human.

After PCR, the plates were centrifuged (1500 × g for
3 min) and imaged in a 96-well LightScanner (Idaho
Technology). The plates were heated at 0.3°C/second,
and fluorescence measurements were collected from
65°C to 98°C. Melting curves were analyzed as described
previously [44] using the LightScanner software. Briefly,

Ishikawa et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:70
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/70

after exponential background subtraction, melting
curves were normalized between 0% and 100%. Normalized and temperature-overlaid curves were viewed on
the subtraction plots to magnify differences in the
shapes of the melting curves. The subtraction plots were
generated by subtracting each curve from the mean
wild-type curve, defined as the most common genotype.
The subtraction plot helps to cluster the samples into
groups. Clustering of the melting curves for genotype
identification was performed manually using the LightScanner software on high sensitivity.
The fluorescence data generated during DNA melting
can be analyzed based on the melting temperature (Tm)
or on the shape of the melting curve. Most homozygous
sequence changes produce a Tm shift compared to the
wild type [45]. In contrast, heterozygous samples are
identified not by product Tm, but by differences in
melting curve configuration [46]. In the TILLING
library, all the induced mutations were heterozygous.
PCR amplification of heterozygotes followed by heat
denaturing and annealing resulted in the formation of 4
duplexes: two homoduplexes and two heteroduplexes.
Each duplex has a characteristic melting temperature,
and the sum of all transitions can be observed by melting curve analysis. The subtraction plot was used to
detect changes in the contour of the melting curve.
HRM screening of the TILLING library was carried
out in two steps. First, each of the 5771 genomic DNAs
was assayed by HRM, and the genomic DNAs showing
melting curves different from the wild-type allele were
selected as mutant candidates (first positive). The HRM
assay was repeated for the first positive genomic DNAs,
and the genomic DNAs showing melting curves different from the wild-type allele were picked up again as
second positives. Proof of induced mutation was
obtained by sequencing the PCR product of the second
positive genomic DNAs. As reported previously [9], substantial numbers of SNPs exist in the genomic DNA of
the library used. Therefore, the second positive DNAs
included both SNPs and true mutations. SNPs were
discriminated from true mutations by defining the same
type of base change detected in more than two sequencing reactions as an SNP.
Sequencing

PCR products containing the second positive HRM
amplicons were purified using a Sephadex G50 (Fine
DNA Grade) column and then used as a template for
the sequencing reaction. Sequencing reactions were carried out by using BigDye Terminator version 3.1
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the ABI
3730xl sequencing platform.

Generation of atm and atr mutant fish

F2 fish carrying the atmS444X or atrS1339X mutation
were obtained by artificial insemination using the frozen
sperm from the TILLING library. Artificial insemination
was performed as described previously [47]. Briefly,
about 100 unfertilized eggs were obtained from the
wild-type females. A single glass capillary containing
10 μL of sperm from the F1 fish identified in the screening was removed from the liquid nitrogen and thawed at
ambient temperature. Immediately after thawing, the
content was placed in balanced salt solution (BSS; 0.65%
sodium chloride, 0.04% potassium chloride, 0.02% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 0.02% calcium chloride
dihydrate, 0.00005% phenol red, 0.01% sodium hydrogen
carbonate, pH 7.3) and incubated with eggs for 20 minutes with occasional pipetting. Eggs that were not fertilized were removed 3 h later, and BSS was replaced
with 0.03% Red Sea salt water. The eggs were incubated
at 28°C until hatching. Artificial insemination was conducted using atmS444X or atrS1339X sperm with a Cab
or HdrR female, respectively. Each resultant fish was
crossed out twice to wild-type Cab or HdrR fish, respectively. Three independent in-crosses of heterozygous
progeny were then performed, from which homozygous
mutant males were obtained and used for this study.
Fish were genotyped by PCR analysis or sequencing of
fin-clip DNA. For PCR genotyping, PCR reactions were
performed using two primer sets, wild-type and mutant,
which have the wild-type or mutant allele sequence,
respectively, at the 3’ end. The primers used for genotyping are listed in Additional file 4, Table S2. For genotyping by sequencing, PCR reactions were performed
with the same primers as used for the screening of the
library.
Primary cell culture

Cell cultures were established from embryos as
described previously (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/
medaka/medakabook/). Cells were cultured at 27°C.
Briefly the embryos were sterilized for at least 40 s in
Dakin’s solution (58 mM NaOCl, 6 mM HCl, and 93
mM NaHCO 3 ), washed in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), resterilized for 10 s in 70% ethanol, and washed
in PBS. The chorion and yolk sac were removed from
each embryo, transferred to L-15 medium, and minced
using a 22G needle connected to a 1-mL syringe to
obtain fibroblast-like cells. Cells were cultured in L-15
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY), 50 mg/mL streptomycin, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 10 mM 2-[4-(-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH
7.5), and incubated at 27°C.

Sensitivity to X-ray irradiation

Cultured cells were exposed to g-rays from a 137 Cs
source at a dose rate of 0.93 Gy/min (Gamma Cell 6000
Elan, MDS Nordion, Ottawa, Canada). OLCAB-e3 cells
were irradiated with g-rays at the dose of 100 Gy and
used for feeder cells. After irradiation, atm +/+ or
atmS444X/S444X cells were cultured in 6-well plates in the
presence of feeder cells (7 × 105 cells/well) and incubated at 27°C. Two weeks after irradiation, the cells
were fixed with ethanol and stained with 0.006% crystal
violet, the formed colonies were counted, and the survival rate was calculated.

Survival of ATR-/- fish

atr+/S1339X fishes were intercrossed and eggs were cultured at 27°C in a 10-cm plastic dish. After culture for
7, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 days, the genotypes of surviving
eggs or fry (80-100 for each fraction) were determined
by PCR or by sequencing.
Histopathological analysis

The gonads were dissected and fixed in Bouin’s solution.
Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks. Crosssections were cut at a 5-μm thickness and stained with
hematoxylin-eosin. Sections were examined and photographed under light microscopy.
Reverse-transcription PCR and quantitative PCR

RNA was isolated from cultured cells established from
mutant or wild-type fish using Sepasol RNAI Super
(Nacalai Tesque) and reverse transcribed by using the
ReverTra Ace R qPCR kit (Toyobo). For atr and atm
quantitative PCR, cDNA-specific primers were designed
to amplify either the 5’ or 3’ region of the atm and atr
transcripts (5’ regions were within exons 1-3, 3-4, 7-8
for atr and exons 2-3 for atm; 3’ regions were within
exons 47-48 for atr and exons 33-34 for atm). The
sequences of all oligonucleotides that were used are
listed in Additional file 4, Table S2.
