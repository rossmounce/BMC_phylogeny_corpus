Abstract
Background: So far very limited knowledge exists on L-arginine catabolism in cyanobacteria, although six major L-argininedegrading pathways have been described for prokaryotes. Thus, we have performed a bioinformatic analysis of possible Larginine-degrading pathways in cyanobacteria. Further, we chose Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 for a more detailed bioinformatic
analysis and for validation of the bioinformatic predictions on L-arginine catabolism with a transcript analysis.
Results: We have evaluated 24 cyanobacterial genomes of freshwater or marine strains for the presence of putative L-argininedegrading enzymes. We identified an L-arginine decarboxylase pathway in all 24 strains. In addition, cyanobacteria have one or
two further pathways representing either an arginase pathway or L-arginine deiminase pathway or an L-arginine oxidase/
dehydrogenase pathway. An L-arginine amidinotransferase pathway as a major L-arginine-degrading pathway is not likely but can
not be entirely excluded. A rather unusual finding was that the cyanobacterial L-arginine deiminases are substantially larger than
the enzymes in non-photosynthetic bacteria and that they are membrane-bound. A more detailed bioinformatic analysis of
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 revealed that three different L-arginine-degrading pathways may in principle be functional in this
cyanobacterium. These are (i) an L-arginine decarboxylase pathway, (ii) an L-arginine deiminase pathway, and (iii) an L-arginine
oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. A transcript analysis of cells grown either with nitrate or L-arginine as sole N-source and with
an illumination of 50 μmol photons m-2 s-1 showed that the transcripts for the first enzyme(s) of all three pathways were present,
but that the transcript levels for the L-arginine deiminase and the L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase were substantially higher
than that of the three isoenzymes of L-arginine decarboxylase.
Conclusion: The evaluation of 24 cyanobacterial genomes revealed that five different L-arginine-degrading pathways are
present in the investigated cyanobacterial species. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 an L-arginine deiminase pathway and an Larginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway represent the major pathways, while the L-arginine decarboxylase pathway most likely
only functions in polyamine biosynthesis. The transcripts encoding the enzymes of the two major pathways were constitutively
expressed with the exception of the transcript for the carbamate kinase, which was substantially up-regulated in cells grown
with L-arginine.

Background
L-arginine metabolism is more complex than the majority
of other metabolic pathways in living organisms. This is
due to (1) the occurrence of a biosynthetic branch point
at the level of carbamoylphosphate, a precursor for Larginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, (2) the fact that Larginine is a potential precursor of polyamines, (3) the
fact that L-arginine can be a precursor of 4-aminobutyrate,
having a role as neurotransmitter in mammals, (4) the
function of L-arginine as a precursor for nitric oxide, acting as an abundant signal molecule in bacteria, mammals,
and plants, and (5) the existence of an impressive variety
of L-arginine-degrading pathways in eubacteria and
archaea. Compared to heterotrophically-growing prokaryotes, L-arginine has specific additional roles in cyanobacteria, because some strains have an alternative carbon
dioxide fixation pathway with carbamoylphosphate as the
first carbon dioxide fixation product. This pathway leads
to the formation of L-citrulline and subsequently to Larginine [1,2]. Moreover, a number of cyanobacteria is
able to synthesize the polymer cyanophycin (multi-L-arginyl-poly-L-aspartate), which consists of an aspartic acid
backbone with L-arginine residues being attached to the
β-carboxyl group of aspartate by isopeptide bonds [3-6].
Cyanophycin has been shown to have a complex dynamic
metabolism, which is not yet completely understood [612].
L-Arginine serves as a source of nitrogen, carbon, and
energy through a variety of catabolic pathways in archaea
and eubacteria [13-16]. In eubacteria, six major Larginine-degrading pathways have been described (Fig.
1). The first enzymes of these six pathways are an arginase,
an L-arginine deiminase, an L-arginine decarboxylase, an

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/437

L-arginine amidino-transferase, an L-arginine succinyl
transferase, and an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase,
respectively. Heterotrophically growing bacteria contain
either only one of these pathways or have multiple catabolic pathways, as e.g. shown for several Pseudomonas species [13,14]. In Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa four L-arginine-degrading pathways are functional. The L-arginine succinyl transferase pathway and
the L-arginine deiminase pathway serve as major routes of
L-arginine catabolism under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. In addition, an L-arginine oxidase/
dehydrogenase pathway also contributes to L-arginine
catabolism under aerobic conditions. The role of a fourth
pathway, the L-arginine decarboxylase pathway, still
remains somewhat unclear. Although it may provide
ammonium from L-arginine, it does not seem to play a
major role in L-arginine utilization as carbon source. It
may have its major function in the biosynthesis of the
polyamines agmatine and putrescine [16].
The understanding of cyanobacterial L-arginine catabolism is scarce and only a few studies on L-arginine-degrading enzymes exist. This work includes the detection of
arginase and L-arginine deiminase activity in Anabaena
cylindrica (being synonymous with Nostoc sp. PCC 7120
and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120) [17], Anabaena variabilis
[18], Aphanocapsa PCC 6308 [19], and Nostoc sp. PCC
73102 [20]. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 two genes
encoding ureohydrolase-type enzymes (Sll1077 and
Sll0228) have been identified using bioinformatic tools
[21]. L-Ornithine was detected as a major initial product
of L-arginine degradation. Based on the detected products,
a model of L-arginine catabolism with a putative arginase
as the first enzyme has been proposed [21]. In this model

L-arginine degradation via arginase is suggested to lead to
L-ornithine as first product and subsequently to the production of L-glutamate, and also L-proline. Since L-citrulline and a minor amount of argininosuccinate were also
detected as products, an urea cycle-type pathway, besides
an arginase pathway, was included in the model [21].

genes encoding enzymes involved in L-arginine degradation in various archaea and heterotrophically growing
eubacteria were used to identify corresponding genes in
cyanobacteria (Table 2). The results of the bioinformatic
analyses of the 24 cyanobacterial genomes are given in
Tables 3 and 4.

In the two closely related strains Synechococcus elongatus
PCC 6301 and PCC 7942 an L-amino acid oxidase (AoxA)
with a high specificity for basic L-amino acids and with Larginine as preferred substrate has been partially characterized [22-24]. Recently, such an enzyme has also been
identified by enzymatic activity tests in Synechococcus
cedrorum PCC 6908 [23]. The aoxA genes in Synechococcus
elongatus PCC 6301 and PCC 7942 have also been identified [23].

In total, we found evidence for the presence of five putative pathways for L-arginine catabolism in the investigated
genomes. These are an L-arginine decarboxylase pathway,
an arginase pathway, an L-arginine amidinotransferase
pathway, an L-arginine deiminase pathway, and an Larginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. These pathways are outlined (Fig. 2), and the accession numbers of
the corresponding genes are given as supplement in
Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. No evidence has been found for the
presence of an L-arginine succinyl transferase pathway.

Since L-arginine catabolism in heterotrophically growing
eubacteria is very diverse and since the knowledge on Larginine catabolism in cyanobacteria is rather limited, the
genomes of 24 cyanobacterial strains were screened for
the presence of genes encoding putative L-argininedegrading enzymes in order to obtain an overview on Larginine catabolism in cyanobacteria. We chose Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a model organism and validated
the results of our bioinformatic analysis for this strain
with a transcript analysis. We chose Synechocystis sp. PCC
6803, because results on the products of L-arginine degradation have been published more recently [21].

Results and Discussion
Evaluation of 24 cyanobacterial genomes for the presence
of genes encoding enzymes of L-arginine-degrading
pathways
We used a bioinformatic approach to analyze 24 cyanobacterial strains with fully sequenced and annotated
genomes for the presence of genes encoding putative
enzymes being involved in the degradation of L-arginine.
Among the marine cyanobacteria, the genomes of six
Prochlorococcus and six Synechococcus species as well as the
genomes of two N2-fixing species (Crocosphaera watsonii
WH 8501 and Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101) were
investigated. The investigated freshwater cyanobacteria
included three mesophilic strains, Synechococcus elongatus
PCC 6301, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and three thermophilic strains,
Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, and two Synechococcus
Yellowstone species. The latter two thermophilic strains
are capable of N2-fixation with a diurnal rhythm. Moreover, three heterocyst-forming N2-fixing species Anabaena
variabilis ATCC 29413, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, and Nostoc
punctiforme PCC 73102 as well as Gloeobacter violaceus PCC
7421, a strain which lacks thylakoid membranes, were
investigated. The origins of the evaluated cyanobacterial
genome sequences are listed in Table 1. Sequences of

L-arginine decarboxylase pathway
One or several genes encoding L-arginine decarboxylasetype enzymes, which catalyze the formation of agmatine
from L-arginine, are present in all investigated cyanobacteria (Fig. 2, Tables 3 and 5). A putative agmatinase that
converts agmatine to putrescine and urea is present in
nineteen cyanobacterial strains. No such gene was identified in Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942,
Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421. These strains, with the exception of Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501, convert agmatine to
putrescine via an agmatine deiminase and an N-carbamoylputrescine hydrolase. Since in none of the investigated cyanobacteria a putrescine oxidase or a putrescine
transaminase encoding gene has been found, we consider
the L-arginine decarboxylase pathway to be mainly
responsible for the synthesis of the polyamines agmatine
and putrescine as well as for production of ammonium
from L-arginine. Putrescine can subsequently be converted to spermidine or spermine. Evidence for the utilization of putrescine by γ-glutamylation like in E. coli [25]
was not found. However, since transaminases frequently
show broad substrate specificity, we can not entirely
exclude that a rather unspecific transaminase, which is not
annotated as a putrescine transaminase, catalyzes the conversion of putrescine to 4-aminobutyr aldehyde. The subsequent dehydrogenase that converts the aldehyde to 4aminobutyrate is present in 23 of the 24 investigated
strains. Such an enzyme is absent in Synechococcus sp. WH
7805. The two enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of
4-aminobutyrate to succinate (4-aminobutyrate transaminase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) are
present in all 24 strains. However, since 4-aminobutyrate
also is an intermediate of the L-amino oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway and can additionally be formed by decarboxylation of L-glutamate, the presence of genes encoding

the latter two enzymes not necessarily implies that a complete L-arginine decarboxylase pathway is present. Therefore, the question whether the L-arginine decarboxylase
pathway only provides polyamines and ammonium or
also allows for utilization of L-arginine as C-source can
not be answered on the basis of the bioinformatic considerations.
A phylogenetic tree of the L-arginine decarboxylases,
which are present in the investigated cyanobacterial
genomes, is given (Fig. 3) and shows that the cyanobacterial L-arginine decarboxylases cluster into four distinct
groups. The clusters marked in green and yellow exclusively contain L-arginine decarboxylases of the marine

non-N2-fixing strains, while the red and blue clusters contain L-arginine decarboxylases of freshwater cyanobacteria
and of the two marine N2-fixing species Crocosphaera
watsonii and Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101. It should
be pointed out that in species with more than several Larginine decarboxylase(s) the corresponding enzymes
always group into two different clusters. Thus, the marine
as well as the fresh water cyanobacteria seem to have two
distinct types of L-arginine decarboxylases.
It has previously been shown by Sandmeier et al. [26] that
amino acid decarboxylases in general can be subdivided
into four different groups. These groups seem to be evolutionary unrelated to each other. In these subdivisions, the

A sequence from Synechococcus sp. Yellowstone B JA-2-3B'a 2–13 was used to screen for L-arginine amidinotransferase sequences. The screen for Larginine oxidase/dehydrogenases was performed with the aoxA sequence from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301/PCC 7942.

groups III and IV contain decarboxylases with specificity
for basic L-amino acids. In addition, there is evidence that
E. coli has two different L-arginine decarboxylases – a biosynthetic and a biodegradable form. The biodegradable Larginine decarboxylase (P28629 – group III decarboxylase) is only induced in large amounts when cells are
grown in rich medium containing L-arginine, while the
biosynthetic enzyme (P21170 – group IV decarboxylase)
is expressed constitutively [26,27]. On the basis of this
classification, the red and green clusters (Fig. 3) contain Larginine decarboxylases being more similar to group IV Larginine decarboxylases, while the blue and yellow clusters contain L-arginine decarboxylases with higher similarity to group III L-arginine decarboxylases. The
similarity of the biodegradable and the biosynthetic Larginine decarboxylase of E. coli to selected marine and
fresh water cyanobacterial L-arginine decarboxylases is
presented in Table 10. E.g. the L-arginine decarboxylases
Slr0662 and Slr1312 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in the

red cluster have a higher similarity to the biosynthetic Larginine decarboxylase (P21170) of group IV than to the
biodegradable L-arginine decarboxylase P28629 of group
III. In contrast, Sll1683 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has
a higher similarity to P28629 (group III) than to P21170
(group IV) (Table 10). Thus, it is likely that the green and
the red cluster (Fig. 3) contain L-arginine decarboxylases
of the biosynthetic-type, while the yellow and blue clusters contain L-arginine decarboxylases of the biodegradative type.
Arginase pathway
Urea is released from L-arginine by an arginase in the arginase pathway, and the resulting L-ornithine is further catabolized to L-glutamate by L-ornithine transaminase and
Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (Fig. 2). In the
presence of urease, urea is further degraded to ammonium. The arginase pathway seems to be widely distributed among the investigated cyanobacteria. Genes

L-ornithine is formed from L-arginine by the enzymes arginase or L-arginine amidinotransferase. It is also formed in the 2nd reaction of the L-arginine
deiminase pathway. Enzymes A5 and E3 are identical enzymes and both represent a 4-aminobutyrate transaminase. Enzymes A6 and E4 are identical and
both represent a succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Fig. 2). Enzymes A2.1, B1, and C1 represent ureohydrolases, and the same gene(s) is (are)
annotated as an agmatinase (A2.1), an arginase (B1) or a 4-guanidinobutyrase (E2). The genes encoding the enzymes C1 and D1 are annotated as Larginine amidinotransferase as well as L-arginine deiminase (see text for further details). N.d. = not detected.

encoding the putative second and third enzyme of this
pathway, the L-ornithine transaminase and the
Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, are present in
all 24 investigated cyanobacteria. A gene encoding a putative arginase is only present in 19 of the investigated
genomes (Tables 4 and 6). Such a gene is absent in Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501, Synechococcus elongatus PCC
6301, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421.
The likely absence of an arginase-type enzyme in five of
the investigated 24 cyanobacterial strains is somewhat
surprising, since arginases have been shown to be present
in all so far investigated higher plants [28]. However,
since plant-type arginases represent a distinct group of
ureohydrolases [28] (Fig. 4, ARGAH1 and AT4G08870)
and localize in mitochondria [29], they may have originated from the predecessor organism, which gave rise to
the evolutionary lineage of mitochondria.

L-arginine amidinotransferase pathway
In addition to arginases, L-ornithine may also be synthesized by L-arginine amidinotransferases (Fig. 2). A gene
for such an enzyme was detected in the N2-fixing species
Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102, Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, Trichodesmium erythraeum
IMS 101, Crocosphaera watsonii WH 8501, Synechococcus
Yellowstone sp. JA-2-3Ba' (2–13), and in the non-N2 fixing
cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421
(Table 4 and 7). Three of the five cyanobacteria without
an arginase-type enzyme have a putative L-arginine amidinotransferase-type enzyme (Crocosphaera watsonii WH
8501, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, and Gloeobacter
violaceus PCC 7421). Thus, Synechococcus elongatus PCC
6301 and PCC 7942 are probably the only cyanobacterial
strains among the 24 investigated ones, which are unable
to form L-ornithine from L-arginine. Interestingly, they

have a very active L-amino acid oxidase (AoxA) with high
specificity for basic amino acids and a preference for Larginine, utilizing molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor [22-24].
L-arginine deiminase pathway
The L-arginine deiminase pathway is widely distributed
among eubacteria and archaea [13,14,16] and has also
been discovered in a few primitive eukaryotes, e.g. in Giardia intestinalis [30], Trichomonas vaginalis [31], and Tritrichomonas foetus [32]. However, it has so far not been
detected in multi-cellular organisms. The L-arginine deiminase pathway consists of three enzymes and catalyzes the
production of ATP in its final enzymatic step. The first
enzyme of this pathway is an L-arginine deiminase, which
irreversibly converts L-arginine to L-citrulline and ammonium. The second and third enzymes are an L-ornithine
transcarbamoylase and a carbamate kinase, respectively
(Fig. 2). A gene encoding a putative L-arginine deiminase
was detected in the N2-fixing species Nostoc sp. PCC 7120,

Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102, Anabaena variabilis ATCC
29413, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS 101, Crocosphaera
watsonii WH 8501, and Synechococcus Yellowstone sp. JA-23Ba' 2–13 as well as in the non-N2 fixing cyanobacteria
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Thermosynechococcus elongatus
BP-1, and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 (Tables 4 and 8).
This gene is the same as the one being annotated encoding
a putative L-arginine amidinotransferase (see below for
discussion of this aspect). An L-ornithine transcarbamoylase is present in all investigated cyanobacteria. Since the
majority of the investigated cyanobacteria have two genes
encoding a putative L-ornithine transcarbamoylase, it is
likely that they contain a catabolic and an anabolic
enzyme [13,33]. Surprisingly, a carbamate kinase, which
catalyzes the last step of the deiminase pathway, has only
been detected in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. An L-arginine
deiminase activity has previously been detected in Anabaena cylindrica [17], Anabaena variabilis [18], Nostoc sp.
PCC 73102 [20], and Aphanocapsa PCC 6308 [19].

Schematic presentation of putative L-arginine-degrading pathways in cyanobacteria with the corresponding
enzymes, intermediate metabolites, and final products. Numbering of enzymes refers to the one used in Table 3, 4,
and 5–9.

L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway
The fifth putative L-arginine catabolic pathway starts with
an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase-type enzyme. In
this pathway L-arginine is converted to succinate via 2ketoarginine, 4-guanidinobutyrate, and 4-aminobutyrate
with a concomitant production of ammonium, carbon
dioxide, and urea (Fig. 2). Ten out of 24 cyanobacterial
species have one or two gene(s) encoding an L-arginine
oxidase/dehydrogenase (Tables 4 and 9), which is similar

to an L-amino acid oxidase that is present in the two
closely related strains Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301
and PCC 7942 [22-24]. The corresponding L-amino acid
oxidase of these two cyanobacteria is encoded by the aoxA
genes YP_171306 and ZP_00164087 for Synechococcus
elongatus PCC 6301 and PCC 7942, respectively, and has
been purified and partially characterized. This AoxA has a
high specificity for basic L-amino acids as substrate with a
preference for L-arginine. AoxA converts L-arginine to 2-

(Synechococcus sp. CC 9605, Synechococcus sp. WH 7805,
Synechococcus sp. WH 5701, Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS
101, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, and
Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102), while the enzyme is
absent in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, Synechococcus
elongatus PCC 7942, and Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421.
The genes encoding the two enzymes which convert 4aminobutyrate to succinate (4-aminobutyrate transaminase and succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase) are
present in all investigated cyanobacteria. The fact that 4aminobutyrate is also an intermediate in the L-arginine
decarboxylase pathway and can additionally be formed by
decarboxylation of L-glutamate might explain the pres-

ence of these two enzymes even in those cyanobacteria
that do not have an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase. An
L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway, converting Larginine to 4-aminobutyrate, was first described on the
basis of detected products for Streptomyces griseus [34] and
is also present in Pseudomonas putida (Trevisan) Migula P2
ATCC 25571. However, the first enzyme has not yet been
characterized biochemically [16,35,36].
L-arginine succinyl transferase pathway
We did not find evidence for the presence of an L-arginine
succinyl transferase pathway in the genome sequences of
the investigated 24 cyanobacterial strains. This pathway is
suggested to be mainly limited to those heterotrophically

growing eubacteria that have the ability to use L-arginine
as both, a nitrogen and a carbon source [13,14,16].
Problems related to the bioinformatic analysis
All 24 investigated cyanobacterial genomes have a putative L-arginine decarboxylase pathway and one or several
additional L-arginine-degrading pathways. These can
either be an arginase pathway, an L-arginine amidinotransferase pathway, an L-arginine deiminase or an Larginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. Thus, all investigated cyanobacteria have at least two putative Larginine-degrading pathways. However, the performed
similarity searches do not always allow a statement
whether all enzymes of the corresponding pathways are
present and whether the gene products have indeed the
enzymatic activity that has been assigned to them on the
basis of the corresponding similarity searches and domain
predictions. No matter what similarity search results sug-

gest, a proof is only provided by activity measurements
with purified enzymes. Therefore, uncertainties related to
this aspect will be briefly discussed with respect to the
enzymes being annotated as ureohydrolases [37] and
enzymes being annotated as L-arginine amidinotransferases or L-arginine deiminases. The latter two types of
enzymes belong to the family of guanidino group modifiers [38].
Ureohydrolases
The bioinformatic evaluation of the 24 cyanobacterial
genome sequences suggests the presence of (a) gene(s)
encoding an arginase, an agmatinase, or a 4-guanidino
butyrase in 19 cyanobacterial genomes. Five cyanobacterial species have neither an arginase- nor an agmatinasenor a 4-guanidino butyrase-encoding gene (Tables 4 and
11). Arginases, agmatinases, and 4-guanidino butyrases
release urea from L-arginine (guanidino amino acid),

belong to the group of ureohydrolases (C-N hydrolases),

enzyme with broad substrate specificity has progressively
been evolved to gain narrower substrate specificity during
evolution. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to annotate

hydrolases (Table 11). The eukaryotic non-plant arginases
cluster in one group (marked in red), while the majority
of the cyanobacterial enzymes form two clusters containing either the enzymes from marine cyanobacteria
(marked in yellow) or from freshwater cyanobacteria
(marked in blue). The two plant arginases form a separate
group [28] and are more closely related to agmatinases
(encoded by speB) than to the arginases from non-photosynthetic organisms of the red cluster. The green cluster
contains 4-guanidino butyrases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida (GbuA_Paeru and
GbuA_Pputi) and the cyanobacterial enzyme Sll1077 of
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (for relevance of this finding
see below) as well as the enzymes of Synechococcus sp. CC
9605, Synechococcus sp. WH 8102, and Synechococcus sp.
WH 5701. The similarity of these cyanobacterial enzymes
to known 4-guanidino butyrases [40] suggests that these
enzymes also have a 4-guanidino butyrase activity (Fig.
4). Since all other cyanobacterial ureohydrolases group
into two separate clusters (blue and yellow cluster), it is
likely that they do not represent 4-guanidino butyrases,
but represent either an arginase or an agmatinase or an

enzyme with both activities – albeit with different substrate affinities. It has been shown that the two arginases
of Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato), which have an arginase activity, also have a very low agmatinase activity
(0.2–0.5% of the arginase activity) [28]. Since the blue
cluster contains sll0228 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803,
which has been shown to encode an agmatinase [21,37],
it is likely that at least some of the enzymes in the blue
cluster are true agmatinases. To further investigate the real
activity of the putative cyanobacterial ureohydrolases, the
expression of the corresponding proteins in E. coli is
required to allow activity measurements as was done for
Sll0228 and Sll1077 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.
Although originally being annotated as arginases, neither
Sll0228 nor Sll1077 have arginase activity [21,37].
Sll0228 has been shown to have agmatinase activity,
while Sll1077 has neither arginase nor an agmatinase
activity [37] and thus, most likely is a 4-guanidino
butyrase (alignment of Sll1077 and GbuA from Pseudomonas putida F1, ZP_00902038 is given in Fig. 5).

P28629 represents a biodegradable and inducible L-arginine decarboxylase (group III); P21270 represents a biosynthetic and constitutively expressed Larginine decarboxylase (group IV) in E. coli [26]. Score values were calculated with the ClustalW software [62]. The L-arginine decarboxylases in the
yellow, blue, green, and red cluster are identical to those L-arginine decarboxylases given in Fig. 3.

Enzymes modifying the guanidino group
This family of enzymes comprises L-arginine deiminases
and L-arginine amidinotransferases [38,41], which share
common structural features [41]. L-arginine deiminases
participate in L-arginine catabolism and are found in
prokaryotes [13,16,42] and primitive eukaryotes [30]. Larginine amidinotransferases have been shown to have a
function as L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase in creatine biosynthesis in vertebrates [43,44], as L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase in the biosynthesis of the toxin
cylindrospermopsin in various cyanobacteria [45], as Larginine:inosamine phosphate amidinotransferase in
streptomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces spp. [45], and
as L-arginine:L-lysine amidinotransferase in the phaseolotoxin biosynthesis in Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola

[46]. In nine cyanobacteria an identical gene was annotated as L-arginine amidinotransferase as well as Larginine deiminase (Table 4). Thus, a decision, which of
the two putative pathways is present, can not be made
with certainty. The similarity of the cyanobacterial
enzymes to characterized L-arginine deiminases is rather
low and is even lower to L-arginine amidinotransferases
(Table 12). However, since L-arginine amidinotransferases have so far only been shown to function in antibiotic or toxin biosynthesis in prokaryotes and since an Larginine deiminase activity has been detected in several
fresh water cyanobacteria [17-20], we think that it is more
likely that the corresponding gene in the nine cyanobacteria (Tables 4, 7, and 8) encodes an L-arginine deiminase
and not an L-arginine amidinotransferase. One reason,

Figure 4
Phylogenetic tree of ureohydrolases
Phylogenetic tree of ureohydrolases. For construction of the tree, selected sequences from eubacteria, fungi, plants, and
animals were used in addition to the cyanobacterial sequences given (Tables 3 and 4). For details on the non-cyanobacterial
sequences see Sekowska et al. [37] and Chen et al. [28]. Details on the cyanobacterial sequences are given (Tables 5, 6, and 9).

why these genes have not yet been annotated as L-arginine
deiminases in the databases, may be related to the fact
that so far well characterized prokaryotic L-arginine deiminases consist of about 400 amino acid residues (Table
12) [47-49] and that the L-arginine deiminase of the
primitive eukaryote Giardia intestinalis consists of 580
amino acid residues [30]. In contrast, the corresponding
nine cyanobacterial genes encode proteins of 699 to 710
amino acid residues length with a molecular mass of 77.5
to 78.3 kDa. Among the cyanobacterial proteins a high
similarity of about 80% exists (Table 12). Another unique
property of cyanobacterial L-arginine deiminases is that
they contain two transmembrane helixes in their C-terminal region. This implies that the cyanobacterial enzymes
are membrane-bound or at least membrane-associated.
Whether the enzymes are bound to the cytoplasmic or the
thylakoid membrane is not yet known.

Identification of genes encoding enzymes of L-arginine
catabolizing pathways in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
We chose Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a model organism
to present more details on the enzymes of the L-argininedegrading pathways and to validate the bioinformatic
results by a transcript analysis. The reason for choosing
this cyanobacterium is based on previously published
results, showing that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 possesses
a very effective uptake system for L-arginine [50]. Moreover, several products of L-arginine degradation have
already been identified [51]. In addition, substantial differences in the utilization of L-arginine as sole N-source in
the growth medium have been observed between Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 WT and a PsbO-free Synechocystis
mutant [10].

Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains genes encoding
enzymes of a putative L-arginine decarboxylase pathway,
an L-arginine deiminase pathway, and an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway (Tables 3, 4, 13, and Fig. 6).

N.d. = not detected. *These ureohydrolases are annotated as arginases, as agmatinases as well as 4-guanidino butyrases. The (+) in Table 3 for A2.1,
B1, and E2 refers to an identical gene, because the gene annotation does not distinguish between arginases, agmatinases, and 4-guanidino butyrases.
A classification is only possible in a few cases, in which enzymatic activity has been measured or the similarity values are very high to already
biochemically well-characterized enzymes (see text for details).

Three genes, sll1683, slr0662, and slr1312, encoding
enzymes with similarity to L-arginine decarboxylases, are
present. As shown in Table 10, Sll1683 has a higher similarity to the biodegradable than to the biosynthetic Larginine decarboxylase of E. coli. In contrast, Slr0662 and
Slr1312 have higher similarity to the biosynthetic than to
the biodegradable enzyme. Moreover, two genes, sll1077
and sll0228, encoding proteins with similarity to ureohydrolases, were detected. Sll0228, but not Sll1077, has
been shown to have agmatinase activity, catalyzing the
synthesis of putrescine [21,37]. However, no true
putrescine oxidase or putrescine transaminase encoding
genes were found in the genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC
6803. Therefore, the L-arginine decarboxylase pathway
may mainly serve as a route for polyamine biosynthesis
and for the production of ammonium from L-arginine.
This assumption is in agreement with results obtained for

pseudomonads, which were shown to an L-arginine
decarboxylase pathway [13,14,16].
Sll1336 has the common features of an L-arginine amidinotransferase as well as of an L-arginine deiminase. However,
since
L-arginine
amidinotransferases
are
predominantly involved in antibiotic or toxin synthesis in
prokaryotes, it is more likely that Sll1336 is an L-arginine
deiminase. This is supported by the fact that Sll1336 has a
slightly higher similarity to sequenced L-arginine deiminases than to L-arginine amidinotransferases (Table 12).
The highest similarity of Sll1336 (705 aa) exists to the Larginine deiminase ArcA from Giardia intestinales (580 aa,
43% overall similar amino acid residues: 10% identical,
19% strongly similar, and 14% weakly similar amino acid
residues). Thus, Sll1336 (705 aa) is substantially larger
than the average L-arginine deiminases of primitive
eukaryotes (~580 aa) or of heterotrophically growing

prokaryotes (~400 aa) (Table 12 and Fig. 7). In contrast to
the bacterial enzymes, the L-arginine deiminase of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (and of all other investigated
cyanobacterial species) also has two putative transmembrane helices in the C-terminal region between the amino
acid residues 630 to 651 and between the amino acid residues 674 and 692 (Fig. 7). The prediction was carried out
with three different software packages (DAS Transmembrane Prediction Server [52]; TMpred Server [53]; TopPred
Server [54]. Therefore, Sll1336 is bound either to the cytoplasmic or the thylakoid membrane.
Like all other investigated cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803 has an L-ornithine transcarbamoylase
(Slr1022), but it is the only species among the investigated strains, which has a gene encoding a carbamate
kinase (sll0573). This enzyme shows an intriguingly high
degree of similarity to carbamate kinases from other
eubacteria. Sll0573 (32 kDa and calculated pI 5.66) has
an overall similarity of 71% (41% identical, 19% strongly
similar, and 11% weakly similar amino acid residues) to
the carbamate kinase ArcC from Enterococcus faecalis (32.9
kDa and calculated pI 5.13) and an overall similarity of
82% (55% identical, 18% strongly similar, 9% weakly
similar amino acid residues) to ArcC from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (33 kDa and calculated pI 5.25) (Fig. 8). Thus,

it is likely that the second possible route for L-arginine
degradation in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is an L-arginine
deiminase pathway leading to synthesis of L-citrulline and
subsequently to L-ornithine, carbon dioxide, ammonium,
and ATP (Fig. 6). L-ornithine becomes further metabolized to L-glutamate by an L-ornithine transaminase
(Slr1022) and a Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase
(Slr0370) (Table 11). This pathway also leads to the synthesis of L-proline via a Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (ProC, Slr0661), and L-proline can be converted back
to this intermediate by a proline oxidase (PutA, Sll1561)
[21].
The third possible route of L-arginine catabolism in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 may be an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. The gene slr0782 encodes a putative
L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase, sll1077 and sll0228
encode putative ureohydrolases, slr1022 and sll0017
encode putative 4-aminobutyrate transaminases, and
slr0370, sll1561, and slr0091 encode putative succinate
semialdehyde dehydrogenases. Thus, L-arginine becomes
degraded to succinate, carbon dioxide, and ammonium,
via 2-ketoarginine, 4-guanidinobutyrate, and 4-aminobutyrate. Since the ureohydrolase Sll1077 groups with
known 4-guanidino butyrases (Fig. 4), and the heterologously expressed enzyme has neither an arginase nor an

L-arginine deiminases and L-arginine amidinotransferases belong to a superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the modification of guanidino groups. The
number of amino acid residues, the molecular mass, and the calculated isoelectric point is given. Moreover, the similarity of the selected reference
enzymes to Sll1336 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is given. Values for % identity and similarity to Sll1336 were determined with the EMBOSS Pairwise
alignment algorithm [65]. The percentage identity and similarity does not include weakly similar amino acid residues.

agmatinase activity [37], this enzyme may indeed be a 4guanidino butyrase. An alignment of the enzyme with the
biochemically identified 4-guanidino butyrase of Pseudomonas putida strain F1 (ZP_00902038) is given (Fig. 5).
The first enzyme of the L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase
pathway (Slr0782) in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has 58%
similarity (20% identical, 24% similar, and 14% weakly
similar amino acid residues) to an L-amino acid oxidase
(AoxA) from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301, encoded
by the aoxA gene (YP_171306) [22-24]. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative deamination of basic L-amino acids
with a preference for L-arginine. An alignment of Slr0782
with AoxA of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301 is given
and shows that Slr0782 has a dinucleotide-binding site
(GxGxxG) [55] like the AoxA enzyme (Fig. 9). Thus,
Slr0782 may also be a FAD-containing enzyme. Since we
were never able to detect an L-arginine oxidizing activity
with utilization of molecular oxygen in intact cells or cell
extracts of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 so far (unpublished
results), it is more likely that Slr0782 interacts in a com-

plex not yet understood way with the electron transport
chain. This is in agreement with the fact that the enzyme
has two hydrophobic regions possibly being transmembrane helices. We would like to also point out that Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301 has an additional gene
encoding a protein called AoxB (YP_171854), which has
59% similarity (25% identical, 21% similar, and 13%
weakly similar amino acid residues) to AoxA [24]. AoxB
has not yet been characterized biochemically. Slr0782 of
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has a higher similarity to AoxB
(in total 66% similarity: 31% identical, 22% similar, and
13% weakly similar amino acid residues) than to AoxA (in
total 58% similarity). It should also be mentioned that the
genomes of different Pseudomonas species contain a gene
encoding an enzyme, which has similarity to Slr0782 (P.
putida KT2440, NP_747085; P. putida F1, ZP_00902633;
P. aeruginosa PAO-1, NP_249112; P fluorescens PfO-1,
YP_348469). The similarity of Slr0782 to the enzyme of P.
fluorescens corresponds to 47% (27% identical, 17% similar, and 13% weakly similar amino acid residues). All
these enzymes contain a dinucleotide-binding GxGxxG

The letters with numbers in parenthesis behind the enzyme names correspond to those given in Tables 3 and 4, and Fig. 2. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
the gene slr1022 has similarity to L-ornithine transaminases and to 4-aminobutyrate transaminases. The L-ornithine transferase (D2) and the 4aminobutyrate transferase (E3) both belong to the group of class III aminotransferases (InterProScan), which explains why the same gene slr1022 is
annotated either as L-ornithine transaminase or as 4-aminobutyrate transaminase. The gene slr0370 has similarity to the Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate
dehydrogenase (D5) and to succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (E4). Both enzymes belong to the NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases
(InterProScan), which explains why the same gene slr0370 is either annotated as Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase or succinate semialdehyde
dehydrogenase Thus, it can not be decided in a bioinformatic approach whether the gene products Slr1022 and Slr0370 are components of the L-arginine
deiminase pathway or the L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway or of both pathways. N.d. = not detected.

motif and thus, are likely FAD-containing dehydrogenases
and not aminotransferases [35,36]. For Pseudomonas putida (Trevisan) Migula P2 ATCC 2557 the Rodwell group
has indeed suggested that an L-amino acid oxidase is the
first enzyme degrading L-arginine via 2-ketoarginine, 4-

guanidinobutyrate, and 4-aminobutyrate to succinate
[35,36].

Schematic
Schematic presentation of the three L-arginine-degrading pathways in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with the
corresponding enzymes, intermediates, cofactors, and final products. A). L-arginine decarboxylase pathway most
likely only provides polyamines and ammonia. B) L-arginine deiminase pathway degrades L-arginine via L-citrulline to L-ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate. L-ornithine is further metabolized via glutamate semialdehyde to L-glutamate. Glutamate semialdehyde can also be converted to L-proline via Δ1pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Carbamoyl phosphate is further metabolized to
ammonium and carbon dioxide. This enzymatic reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme carbamate kinase and is coupled to ATP
synthesis. C) The L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway converts L-arginine to succinate via 2-ketoarginine, 4-guanidinobutyrate, 4-aminobutyrate, and succinate semialdehyde.

Detection of transcripts for L-arginine-degrading enzymes
in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
The bioinformatic evaluation suggests the presence of
three putative L-arginine-degrading pathways in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. These putative pathways are an Larginine decarboxylase pathway (three isoenzymes as first
enzyme: Sll1683, Slr0662, and Slr1312), an L-arginine
deiminase pathway (first enzyme Sll1336), and an Larginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway (first enzyme
Slr0782) (Fig. 6).

For detection of the corresponding transcripts, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was cultivated with nitrate or with
L-arginine as sole N-source and with an illumination of
50 μmol photons m-2 s-1 for three days. These growth conditions were similar to those published previously [51] for

experiments to determine products of L-arginine degradation. The growth curves and the chlorophyll content are
given in Fig. 10. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 grew about
equally well with nitrate as with L-arginine. Total RNA
was isolated from the corresponding cultures and was
applied to RNA slot-blot hybridization with selected DigdUTP-labeled gene-specific DNA probes (Fig. 11). Equal
length, concentration, almost equal GC-content of the
probes, and equal exposure time allowed for semi-quantitative comparison of mRNA levels of all five investigated
transcripts: sll1683, sll0662, and slr1312 encoding isoenzymes of L-arginine decarboxylases, sll1336 encoding an
L-arginine deiminase, and slr0782 encoding an L-arginine
oxidase/dehydrogenase. The transcript level for the three
L-arginine decarboxylase-encoding genes was low when
the cells grew with nitrate and did not or only slightly

for sll0228 transcript (not shown), which encodes an
agmatinase-type enzyme [37,51] – the second enzyme in
the L-arginine decarboxylase pathway. This implies that
the L-arginine decarboxylase pathway probably has its
only function in polyamine biosynthesis and does not
represent a major pathway for L-arginine degradation in
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 when cells grew with Larginine as sole N-source.

for the three L-arginine decarboxylase isoenzymes. The
steady-state transcript levels for these two enzymes were as
high in nitrate-grown cells as in L-arginine-grown cells.
This suggests that these two genes are transcribed constitutively. The same is true for the transcripts of the subsequent enzymes of the two pathways with the exception of
the carbamate kinase transcript (Fig. 12 and 13). The
mRNA for the carbamate kinase was lower than for the
other enzymes and the steady-state transcript level was
found to be highly increased in L-arginine-grown cells.

As shown in Fig. 11, the transcript levels for the L-arginine
deiminase (Sll1336) as well as for the L-arginine oxidase/

ylase-, an arginase-, an L-arginine amidinotransferase-, an
L-arginine deiminase-, and an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway in the investigated cyanobacteria
(Tables 3 and 4, and Fig. 2). All investigated strains contain an L-arginine decarboxylase pathway, which most
likely mainly facilitates polyamine biosynthesis. Since
extracellularly added putrescine has been shown to be
toxic, at least for some cyanobacteria [56], it is unlikely
that this pathway is a major pathway for L-arginine degradation. In addition to the L-arginine decarboxylase pathway, one or two further L-arginine-degrading pathway(s)
is (are) present, which is either an arginase pathway, an Larginine deiminase pathway or an L-arginine oxidase/
dehydrogenase pathway. Although an L-arginine amidinotransferase pathway can not be excluded entirely, this
pathway is rather unlikely to have a major function in Larginine degradation, since L-arginine amidinotransferases seem to mainly function in antibiotic and toxin
production in prokaryotes [44-46].
An interesting result of the bioinformatic analysis is the
observation that the cyanobacterial L-arginine deiminases, being present in nine cyanobacterial strains (Table
4), are substantially larger than the corresponding
enzymes from non-photosynthetic eubacteria (Table 12).
Further, they seem to be bound either to the cytoplasmic
or the thylakoid membrane. In bacteria it has been shown
that the L-arginine deiminase pathway is regulated in a
rather complex way in dependence of the L-arginine and

oxygen concentration, the redox poise, and/or energy status of the cell [13,14,48,49]. On the basis of the larger size
and the predicted membrane association of the cyanobacterial L-arginine deiminases, the regulation of the Larginine deiminase pathway in cyanobacteria maybe even
more complex than in bacteria. This has also to be seen
under the aspect that this pathway leads to ATP synthesis
in the last enzymatic step providing an additional substrate-level phosphorylation site.
The second rather unexpected observation is the presence
of a putative L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway
in ten cyanobacteria (Table 4). The first enzyme of this
pathway has similarity to an L-amino acid oxidase, catalyzing the oxidative deamination of basic L-amino acids
with a preference for L-arginine and with oxygen as electron acceptor in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301 and
PCC 7942. This pathway has not yet been investigated in
detail. However, preliminary results, which had been
obtained with Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, suggest that the
first enzyme of this pathway does not represent an Larginine oxidase with oxygen as electron acceptor, but
rather represents an L-arginine dehydrogenase, which
interacts in a complex not yet understood with the electron transport chain. An interaction of amino acid dehydrogenases with the respiratory electron transport chain
has previously been shown for E. coli [57].

were grown for 24, 48, or 72 h with nitrate or L-arginine as
sole N-source and with a constant illumination of 50 μmol

allows for a direct comparison of the various transcript concentrations. Moreover, changes in transcript level can be
compared in cells grown with L-arginine (increase or
decrease) to that grown with nitrate.

In addition to the overview on L-arginine-degrading pathways in 24 cyanobacteria, we have performed a more
detailed evaluation of the pathways in Synechocystis sp.
PCC 6803. This investigation provided evidence that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has three putative L-argininedegrading pathways, being an L-arginine decarboxylase
pathway, an L-arginine deiminase pathway, and an Larginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway. An arginase
pathway does not seem to exist, since the two proteins,
originally annotated as arginases, do not possess an arginase activity [37,51]. Transcript analyses revealed that the
mRNA levels for the three isoenzymes of L-arginine decarboxylase (Slr1312, Slr0662, and Sll1683) and also for the
agmatinase Sll0228 were rather low in Synechocystis sp.

PCC 6803 in nitrate- or L-arginine-grown cells. Thus, this
pathway probably has its major function in polyamine
biosynthesis. In contrast, the transcript levels for a putative L-arginine deiminase pathway (first enzyme: Sll1336)
and an L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase pathway (first
enzyme: Slr0782) were high whether L-arginine or nitrate
was the N-source, suggesting that these two pathways are
the major L-arginine-degrading pathways and that they
are expressed constitutively. The only exception is the carbamate kinase, whose transcript was found at elevated levels in L-arginine-grown cells. The lack of a substantial upregulation of these transcripts, when cells were transferred
from a nitrate-containing medium to an L-arginine-containing medium and an illumination of 50 μmol photons
m-2 s-1 light, suggests that these pathways, besides having

(KEGG). Database searches and similarity searches were
done as described in Rueckert et al.[58] with nucleotide
and amino acid sequences using the BlastN- and BlastPalgorithms [59]. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the DIALIGN2 software [60]. The phylogenetic trees were calculated using the neighbor-joining
method [61], which is integrated in the ClustalX software
package [62]. The results were visualized as a radial tree

have a role in the complex dynamic metabolism of cyanophycin, which is not yet fully understood [8]. Such a
functional L-arginine deiminase pathway would account
for the products of L-arginine degradation identified in
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [51]. The bioinformatic evaluation in combination with the transcript analysis suggests
that Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has an unusual L-arginine
deiminase and an unusual L-arginine oxidase/dehydrogenase as the major L-arginine-degrading enzymes. An
extended biochemical investigation of these two enzymes
and the corresponding pathways is required before a statement can be made on how these two pathways are integrated in the overall C- and N-metabolism in Synechocystis
sp. PCC 6803.

Cyanobacterial strains, growth conditions, and cell harvest
Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was obtained from the
Pasteur Culture Collection of Cyanobacterial Strains,
Paris, France. Cells were grown in gas wash bottles with a
capacity of 250 ml in a stream of 2% carbon dioxide in air
at 30°C. Growth either with nitrate or L-arginine as sole
nitrogen source was performed basically according to
Stephan et al.[10] except that the light intensity has been
reduced from 200 to 50 μmol photons m-2 s-1. Under
these conditions the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 can grow
with L-arginine without a stress phenotype. The standard
inoculation corresponded to an absorbance of 0.3 at 750
nm (OD750 nm). Growth was determined as OD750 nm of
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cultures. After 24, 48, and 72 h
cells were mixed 1:1 with crushed ice and harvested by
centrifugation for 5 min at 4.000 × g in a table top centrifuge. Isolation of total RNA was performed as described
previously [64] combined with an on-column DNase
digestion step with the RNase-free DNase set from Qiagen
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Quantification of steady-state mRNA pools of selected
transcripts with slot-blot RNA hybridization analysis
For slot-blot RNA hybridization experiments, 5 μg RNA
were denatured for 10 min at 68°C in a formaldehyde/
formamide-containing buffer and transferred to
HybondN+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Freiburg, Germany) using the BioRad-Dot-blot SF Microfiltration Apparatus (BioRad) as described in the corresponding manual. RNA was UV cross-linked to the
membrane and samples were probed with different PCRderived digoxygenin-dUTP (Dig-dUTP) labeled gene-specific DNA probes (Table 14). Slot-blot RNA detection
were performed using the CDP-Star ready-to-use system
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The rnpB probe was used in all
experiments to ensure equal loading.
