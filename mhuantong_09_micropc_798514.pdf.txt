Abstract
Background: Plant microRNA (miRNA) has an important role in controlling gene regulation in
various biological processes such as cell development, signal transduction, and environmental
responses. While information on plant miRNAs and their targets is widely available, accessible
online plant miRNA resources are limited; most of them are intended for economically important
crops or plant model organisms. With abundant sequence data of numerous plants in public
databases such as NCBI and PlantGDB, the identification of their miRNAs and targets would benefit
researchers as a central resource for the comparative studies of plant miRNAs.
Results: MicroPC (μPC) is an online plant miRNA resource resulted from large-scale Expressed
Sequence Tag (EST) analysis. It consists of 4,006 potential miRNA candidates in 128 families of 125
plant species and 2,995 proteins (4,953 EST sequences) potentially targeted by 78 families of
miRNA candidates. In addition, it is incorporated with 1,727 previously reported plant mature
miRNA sequences from miRBase. The μPC enables users to compare stored mature or precursor
miRNAs and user-supplied sequences among plant species. The search utility allows users to
investigate the predicted miRNAs and miRNA targets in detail via various search options such as
miRNA family and plant species. To enhance the database usage, the prediction utility provides
interactive steps for determining a miRNA or miRNA targets from an input nucleotide sequence
and links the prediction results to their homologs in the μPC.
Conclusion: The μPC constitutes the first online resource that enables users to comprehensively
compare and predict plant miRNAs and their targets. It imparts a basis for further research on
revealing miRNA conservation, function, and evolution across plant species and classification. The
μPC is available at http://www.biotec.or.th/isl/micropc.

Background
MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of non-coding small RNAs
with a single strand molecule of 18–22 nucleotides. It
plays a pivotal role in gene regulation in various species
by targeting mRNAs at the post-transcriptional levels [1].

In plants, miRNA involves in organ development and
environmental responses [2-4].
Despite accumulating studies in the identification of plant
miRNAs and their targets based on both computational

[5-12] and experimental [13-16] approaches, existing
public resources focusing on plant miRNAs and their targets are limited to economically important crops or specially implemented for plant model organisms such as
Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. Among them, miRU [17] is a
web server for plant miRNA target prediction utilizing the
concepts of nearly perfect binding between a miRNA and
its targets. Plant MPSS (Massively Parallel Signature
Sequencing) databases [18] of Arabidopsis, rice, grape, and
rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) were developed to
provide an online resource for mRNA and small RNA
analyses. ASRP (Arabidopsis Small RNA Project) [19,20]
provides a repository with tools for analysis and visualization of small RNA sequences cloned from various ecotypes and tissues of Arabidopsis. CSRDB (Cereal Small RNA
Database) [21] consists of maize and rice small RNA
sequences generated by high-throughput pyrosequencing
with the provided maps to the available rice and maize
genomes.

mental stem-loop sequences and applied the criteria in
[25] to remove structural sequences which have (1) the
number of mismatches between miRNA and miRNA*
greater than 4, and/or (2) the number of asymmetric
bulges greater than 1, and/or (3) the size of the asymmetric bulge greater than 2 [see excluded sequences in Additional file 2]. We then manually curated remaining 513
sequences and deployed them together with all sequences
with experiments as source sequences for miRNA prediction. All 5,306,503 EST sequences of 173 plant species
were downloaded from PlantGDB in November, 2008
[see Additional file 3]. We compiled 1,372 RNA families
from Rfam 9.1 (January, 2009) [31] to filter out non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are not miRNAs in the step of
miRNA prediction. For EST functional annotation, the
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL protein
data sets release 14.9 were obtained from UniProt [32].
These data sets will be updated periodically when their
new releases are available.

Here, we developed MicroPC (μPC) as a comprehensive
online resource for predicting and comparing plant miRNAs and their targets. The μPC is resulted from applying
previous steps and criteria [7,22-25] with known plant
mature miRNA sequences from miRBase [26,27] and
large-scale EST sequences from PlantGDB [28,29]. The
μPC database consists of 4,006 predicted miRNA candidates in 128 families of 125 plant species and 2,995 proteins (4,953 EST sequences) potentially targeted by 78
families of potential miRNA candidates. It characterizes
the predicted miRNAs and their targets according to plant
classification (e.g., monocots, dicots, mosses) and incorporated with previously discovered 1,727 plant mature
miRNAs from miRBase. With stored data, it offers users a
comparative and integrative view of previously reported
miRNAs and our predicted miRNA candidates among various plant species. The sequence alignment feature enables users to explore the relation and evolution of either
mature or precursor miRNA sequences within a family
across plant species. Moreover, the search utility provides
various search options for users to explore the predicted
miRNA candidates and their potential targets in detail.
The prediction utility helps to predict potential miRNA
candidates for an input nucleotide sequence and to scan
for EST sequences of a plant species that might be targeted
by an input mature miRNA sequence.

Prediction of potential miRNA candidates
The prediction of plant miRNA candidates was primarily
inferred from the study of Zhang et al. [7], consisting of six
main steps (Figure 1A). First, known mature miRNA
sequences from miRBase were searched against EST
sequences of 173 plant species from PlantGDB using
BLASTN [33] version 2.2.18 (with E-value < 100 and window size = 4) for identifying homologs. Second, EST
sequences containing homolog mature miRNA sequences
with the number of mismatches fewer than 4 were
searched against UniProt protein database using BLASTX
(with E-value < e-20) for removing protein-coding
sequences. EST sequences that did not significantly hit any
proteins in UniProt from the second step would be further
searched against Rfam database using BLASTN (with Evalue < e-8) for removing homologs of non-coding RNAs
other than miRNAs. Fourth, remaining EST sequences
were predicted for the secondary structure of primary
miRNA (pri-miRNA) and precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA)
by UNAFold which resulted in RNA secondary structures
ranked by their minimal free energies (MFEs). Next, predicted precursor miRNA sequences were searched against
UniProt protein database using BLASTX (with E-value < e20) for removing possible protein-coding sequences. An
EST sequence will be determined as a miRNA gene if its
pre-miRNA structures with lowest MFE satisfy the criteria
proposed by Ambros et al. [23]: (1) the mature miRNA
sequence has to be within one arm of the hairpin secondary structure, (2) the number of mismatches between
mature miRNA sequence and its miRNA* sequence is
fewer than 6, and (3) there is no muti-loop in pre-miRNA
hairpin secondary structure. The total 1,153 EST
sequences were predicted as potential miRNA candidates
in 128 families of 125 plant species. These sequences with
their secondary structures, MFEs, source mature miRNA

sequences from miRBase, and other prediction detailed
results are collected in the μPC database.
Prediction of ESTs targeted by miRNA candidates
The prediction of plant miRNA targets is a straightforward
process since plant mature miRNAs can bind with specific
mRNA targets through perfect or nearly-perfect complementarities [13,34]. Sequences of potential miRNA candidates were scanned for complementary sites on EST
sequences that significantly hit some proteins in UniProt
database based on BLASTX (E-value < e-20). An EST
sequence would be considered as a potential target if it
passes the criteria used in Rhoades et al. [22,35]: (1) the
number of mismatches (including G:U pair [36]) between
sequence of potential miRNA candidate and its complementary site on the EST is fewer than 4, and (2) there is no
gap in the complementary site. As specific positions of
mismatches affect miRNA targeting [37,38], we also collected these positions to enable the query of predicted targets with specific mismatch positions of interest. Total
2,995 proteins (4,953 EST sequences) potentially targeted
by 78 families of miRNA candidates were assigned with
Gene Ontology (GO) [39], categorized by GO ID (e.g.,

GO:0000166) and GO term (e.g., nucleotide binding),
and stored in the μPC database. Figure 1B shows the procedure of potential miRNA target prediction.
Prediction accuracy and coverage
To assess the prediction accuracy and coverage, 936 experimental precursor miRNA sequences from miRBase were
used as input for the miRNA prediction procedure and
761 out of 936 (81.3%) were correctly predicted as
miRNA genes [see Additional file 4]. Other sequences
were mostly ruled out during the secondary structure prediction. With one thousand repeats of 936 randomly generated sequences, the average number of random
sequences predicted as miRNA genes is extremely low
(0.00064%). To assess whether variable source mature
miRNA sequences affect prediction results, we applied the
same prediction steps to the 936 precursor miRNA
sequences with leave-one-out of source mature miRNA
sequences. The removal of common miRNAs or miRNAs
with several members in a family has little or no effects on
prediction results. In contrast, a removed species-specific
miRNA sequence such as miRNA 1063 in moss will
reduce the number of prediction coverage [see Additional

files 5 and 6]. These measurements suggest that our
miRNA prediction procedure could predict potential
miRNA candidates with confidence and has limitation in
coverage due to homology-based approach.

Utility and discussion

The μPC offers three main interactive pages for comparing, searching, and predicting plant miRNAs and their targets as described below.
Comparative miRNAs
The comparative utility enables users to explore the conservation of known and predicted miRNAs among plant
species in integrative views. Users may select miRNAs of
interest and submit for their availability among plant species. Cells with different colors in a matrix view of selected
miRNAs and plants represent available miRNAs from
three sources: our EST analysis, all previous reports from
miRBase, or both. Figure 2A reveals the conservation of
miRNA 156, miRNA 159, miRNA 172 across plant
groups, while miRNA 444 seems to be monocot-specific.
miRNA 1062 and miRNA 1076 appear to be moss-specific
and miRNA 1082, miRNA 1091, miRNA 1094, miRNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/366

1095, and miRNA 1098 seem to be spike moss-specific.
Besides the comparative matrix view, users may explore
the multiple sequence alignment and evolution of either
mature or precursor miRNA sequences from miRBase, our
prediction results, and user-supplied sequences via incorporated CLUSTALW [40] and Jalview [41] (Figures 2B and
2C).
Search
The search utility provides various ways for users to access
predicted miRNA candidates and potential miRNA targets
in detail. Users may search for predicted miRNAs by
miRNA family (e.g., miR156), plant species (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana), mature miRNA sequence (e.g., ugacagaagagagugagcac), and miRBase AC or ID (e.g.,
MIMAT0000166 or ath-MIR156a). The miRNA search
result mainly includes a list of EST accession numbers
potentially encoding miRNAs, their referenced mature
miRNA sequences from miRBase, and a link to detailed
prediction results such as the secondary structure of premiRNA sequence, mature miRNA sequence, positions,
number of mismatches, GC content, and MFEI (minimal
folding free energy index) [42]. Users could also export

the EST source sequence and its secondary structure of
pre-miRNA for a specific record (Figure 3A). Users may
search for ESTs potentially targeted by miRNA candidates
through miRNA family, plant species, UniProt accession
number (e.g., [Swiss-Prot:P93015]; SPL3 protein in Arabidopsis), and GO term (e.g., rhythmic process). Figure 3B
shows an example of the search by UniProt accession
number [Swiss-Prot:P93015], where all targeted ESTs
annotated with [Swiss-Prot:P93015] will be returned. The
"Export Result" button on both the miRNA and Target
search result pages allows users to download a search
result as a text file containing detailed prediction results of
all records.
Tools for miRNA and miRNA target predictions
The prediction utility helps to predict whether an input
nucleotide sequence (< 3000 bp) is a potential miRNA
candidate, and to scan for EST sequences of a plant species
potentially targeted by an input mature miRNA sequence
(in range of 18–26 nt). For miRNA prediction, users could
reduce the number of hit mature miRNAs from miRBase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/366

via E-value and the maximum number of alignments setting. It will return all mature miRNA sequences that satisfy
setting conditions and found within the input sequence.
They are also linked to their potential miRNA homologs
in the μPC database. The input sequence with a specific
mature miRNA positioned could be further predicted by
UNAFold for its secondary structure and substructure of
stem-loop with mature miRNA sequence on one arm (Figure 4). To predict miRNA targets, users may reduce the
number of possible targets via numbers of allowed mismatches and G:U pairs. Its result includes targeted EST
accession numbers from PlantGDB, target site alignment
and position, numbers of mismatches and G:U pairs, and
its functional annotation.

Conclusion

The μPC represents the first online resource that facilitates
users with the inclusive comparing and predicting plant
miRNAs and miRNA targets across plant species and classification. The comparative utility enables users to explore
the conservation and evolution of stored miRNAs and

explore miRNAs and their targets predicted by large-scale
EST analysis via search utility and predict a miRNA or its
possible targets for an input sequence via prediction utility. With stored data and incorporated utilities, the μPC
conveys a basis for additional research on plant miRNA
functions and evolution.
