Abstract
Background: Hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) is a key enzyme in plant oxylipin metabolism that catalyses the
cleavage of polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides produced by the action of lipoxygenase (LOX) to
volatile aldehydes and oxo acids. The synthesis of these volatile aldehydes is rapidly induced in plant tissues
upon mechanical wounding and insect or pathogen attack. Together with their direct defence role towards
different pathogens, these compounds are believed to play an important role in signalling within and
between plants, and in the molecular cross-talk between plants and other organisms surrounding them.
We have recently described the targeting of a seed 9-HPL to microsomes and putative lipid bodies and
were interested to compare the localisation patterns of both a 13-HPL and a 9/13-HPL from Medicago
truncatula, which were known to be expressed in leaves and roots, respectively.
Results: To study the subcellular localisation of plant 9/13-HPLs, a set of YFP-tagged chimeric constructs
were prepared using two M. truncatula HPL cDNAs and the localisation of the corresponding chimeras
were verified by confocal microscopy in tobacco protoplasts and leaves. Results reported here indicated
a distribution of M.truncatula 9/13-HPL (HPLF) between cytosol and lipid droplets (LD) whereas, as
expected, M.truncatula 13-HPL (HPLE) was targeted to plastids. Notably, such endocellular localisation has
not yet been reported previously for any 9/13-HPL. To verify a possible physiological significance of such
association, purified recombinant HPLF was used in activation experiments with purified seed lipid bodies.
Our results showed that lipid bodies can fully activate HPLF.
Conclusion: We provide evidence for the first CYP74C enzyme, to be targeted to cytosol and LD. We
also showed by sedimentation and kinetic analyses that the association with LD or lipid bodies can result
in the protein conformational changes required for full activation of the enzyme. This activation
mechanism, which supports previous in vitro work with synthetic detergent micelle, fits well with a
mechanism for regulating the rate of release of volatile aldehydes that is observed soon after wounding or
tissue disruption.

Background
Hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) is a key enzyme in plant oxylipin metabolism that catalyses the cleavage of polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides produced by the action
of lipoxygenase (LOX) to volatile aldehydes and oxo
acids. Depending on the substrate specificity of HPL, 6carbon or 9-carbon aldehydes are produced from 13hydroperoxides or 9-hydroperoxides respectively [1,2].
The synthesis of these volatile aldehydes is rapidly
induced in plant tissues upon mechanical wounding and
insect or pathogen attack. Together with the direct role of
C9 and C6 aldehydes in defence towards different pathogens [1-3], these compounds are believed to play an
important role in signalling within and between plants,
and in the molecular cross-talk between plants and other
organisms surrounding them [4-6]. HPL together with
allene oxide synthase (AOS) and divinyl ether synthase
(DES) form a cytochrome P450 (CYP) subfamily, named
CYP74 (cytochrome P450, subfamily 74), specialised for
the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides. Unlike "classical" P450 enzymes, members of the
CYP74 subfamily have atypical reaction mechanisms and
require neither oxygen nor a NADPH reductase. CYP74
enzymes are currently divided into four different groups
on the basis of their sequence relatedness: CYP74A and B
include AOS and HPL respectively, showing a strict preference for 13-hydroperoxides, CYP74C includes AOS and
HPL which can convert either 9- and 13-hydroperoxides.
Finally, DES are classified as CYP74D [7]. A new nomenclature for CYP74 enzymes, based upon the confirmed
substrate and product specificities of recombinant proteins, has recently been proposed [8] and which assigns
CYP74C to only HPLs with dual specificity.
As far as the endocellular distribution of CYP74 members
is concerned, even if a plastidial localisation for AOS and
HPL in CYP74A and B groups, respectively is well established, there is very little information on the subcellular
localisation of plant HPLs belonging to the CYP74C subfamily. Apart from almond seed 9-HPL which is targeted
to the endomembrane system and to putative lipid bodies
[9], and two HPLs recently reported from rice (OsHPL1
and OsHPL2) targeted to plastids [10], there is no information about the localisation of the other HPLs in this
subfamily. In contrast to almond 9-HPL which shows a
strict preference for 9-hydroperoxides [9], the other members of the CYP74C subfamily can metabolise both 9- and
13-hydroperoxides and are therefore commonly referred
to as 9/13-HPLs. 9/13-HPLs have been reported so far
from only a few plant species, namely M. truncatula (Acc.
No. AJ316562; [11]), melon (Acc. No. AF081955; [12]),
cucumber (Acc. No. AF229811; [13]) and rice (OsHPL1,
Acc. No. AK105964, OsHPL2, Acc. No. AK107161; [10]).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/58

In the present work, we have investigated the endocellular
localisation of M. truncatula 9/13-HPL (HPLF), a member
of the CYP74C subfamily and its localisation pattern was
compared with that of another HPL from M. truncatula
(HPLE) that was predicted from phylogenetic analysis [7]
and confirmed through analysis of the recombinant protein (Hughes et al., unpublished work) to be a 13-HPL, a
member of the CYP74B subfamily. The link between the
unexpected localisation of a member of the CYP74C subfamily and the possible activation of the enzyme in vivo is
therefore proposed.

Results
M. truncatula HPLs show different subcellular distributions
Two different cDNA clones from M. truncatula were used
in this study: the first clone (HPLF; Acc. No. AJ316562)
encodes a 9/13-HPL [11] and was produced from mRNA
extracted from four-week old Rhizobium melitoti-inoculated roots and nodules; the second clone (HPLE; Acc. No.
DQ011231) encodes a 13-HPL [7] (Hughes et al., unpublished work) and was produced from mRNA extracted
from M. truncatula leaves fed upon by Spodoptera exigua
(beet armyworm) for 24 hours. Similar to other 9/13HPLs, HPLF was not predicted to contain any canonical
chloroplast transit peptide, despite having an unusual predicted N-terminal sequence enriched with serine and threonine residues (five serine residues and two threonine
residues in the first eleven amino acids). Differently from
HPLF, a plastidial localisation was predicted for HPLE, a
putative N-terminal transit peptide of 59 amino acids was
predicted by ChloroP prediction software. To study in
more detail the endocellular localisation of both M. truncatula HPLs, a set of YFP-tagged gene fusions were prepared and the localisation of the corresponding chimeric
proteins was verified by confocal microscopy after transient expression in tobacco protoplasts and leaves. Three
different chimeric constructs were prepared to verify the
localisation of the full length protein (pG2HPLF1-YFP)
and the role of the first eleven amino acids at its N-terminus in the final targeting of HPLF (pG2HPLF2-YFP and
pG2HPLF3-YFP). Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation
of the four chimeric constructs used to investigate the
localisation of HPLF and HPLE. Fluorescence patterns
were monitored up to twenty four hours after transformation.

As expected the two M. truncatula HPLs showed different
endocellular localisations (Fig. 2). Indeed, in tobacco protoplasts expressing HPLE1-YFP, the chimera was detected
as small fluorescence spots on the plastids (Fig. 2a),
whereas in the case of HPLF1-YFP the fluorescence distribution was mostly cytosolic but also showed association
with some small spherical bodies (Fig. 2b). A similar
localisation was observed for HPLF2-YFP (Fig. 2c),
whereas only a cytosolic distribution of fluorescence was

found in the case of HPLF3-YFP (Fig. 2d), thus indicating
that the N-terminus of HPLF does not influence the final
localisation of the protein
Similar localisation results were obtained in Nicotiana
benthamiana leaves transiently transformed with
pG2HPLF-YFP and pG2HPLE-YFP chimeric constructs
(data not shown).
HPLF association with lipid droplets
When expressed in tobacco protoplasts, HPLF1/2-YFP chimeras were able to label some spherical bodies (Fig. 2) of
similar size and shape to small lipid droplets (LD) which
can be selectively stained in different plant tissues by Nile
red, a dye which interacts with neutral lipids. Fig. 3A
shows a typical visualisation of LD in tobacco and A. thaliana protoplasts or in M. truncatula and A. thaliana hairyroots, selectively stained by Nile red. Co-localisation of
YFP and Nile red fluorescences was also verified in
tobacco protoplasts expressing the HPLF-YFP chimera
(Fig. 3B).

To verify if LD could be also the main destination of
ectopically expressed oleosin, tobacco protoplasts were
transformed with oleosin-GFP chimeric construct and
stained with Nile red. As shown in Fig. 4a, the two fluorescences showed a prevalent co-localisation, even if in some
cases, some spots were labelled only by GFP fluorescence
or Nile red staining. These data could reflect the fact that
LD are already pre-formed in tobacco protoplasts (as
already shown in Fig. 3A) and that, some of newly synthesised oleosins are not yet incorporated in LD.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/58

To better study the relationship between LD and the ER,
oleosin-RFP (OLE-RFP) was co-expressed together with
GFP-KDEL (to label the ER) in tobacco protoplasts. Our
results (Fig. 4b) indicated that oleosin-RFP is rapidly
sorted to LD which in some cases (see the large red spots
of Fig. 4b) appeared to be labelled by RFP alone. Considering that LD were very close to the ER, it was very difficult
to discriminate exactly about the relationship that existed
between them. Finally, we isolated lipid bodies, microsomal and cytosolic protein fractions from tobacco protoplasts expressing oleosin-GFP and carried out westernblot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig.
4c, oleosin-GFP was detected in the ER fraction, thus indicating that, in our experimental conditions, LD are recovered in such a fraction. A faint band of the molecular mass
predicted for oleosin-GFP was also found in the lipid
body fraction at longer exposure (data not shown). This
observation supports the hypothesis that, in our experimental conditions, LD are recovered mostly from the ER
fraction.
With the aim to better study the association of HPLF with
LD, we carried out co-expression of YFP-tagged M. truncatula HPLs and oleosin-RFP chimeric constructs in tobacco
protoplasts. As shown in Fig. 5b–c, HPLF1/2-YFP chimeras showed a prevalent, even though not complete, colocalisation with oleosin-RFP fluorescence in LD. Coexpression of OLE-RFP and HPLF3-YFP chimeras did not
succeed in targeting YPF to LD, which were only labelled
by RFP (Fig. 5d).
Finally, in tobacco protoplasts co-expressing OLE-RFP
and HPLE1-YFP, YFP fluorescence was detected on the
plastids as small spots similar to those reported in Fig. 2a
and was physically separated by RFP fluorescence (Fig.
5a). However, in some cases LD, labelled by oleosin RFP,
were very close to plastids and RFP and YFP fluorescences
seemed to co-localise. The physiological significance of
such an association is currently unclear and further experiments are in progress to clarify it.
To confirm the confocal microscopy results, we carried
out sub cellular fractionation of tobacco protoplasts coexpressing OLE-RFP and HPLE/F-YFP. Plastidial, microsomal, lipid bodies and cytosolic protein fractions were
isolated as described in the Materials section. As shown in
Fig. 5e, the full chimera of HPLE1-YFP was detected only
in the plastidial fraction. The lower molecular weight
polypeptide immunodetected in the soluble protein sample may be due to some proteolytic degradation of the chimera which produces a soluble polypeptide. Since no
cytosolic distribution of fluorescence was observed in
confocal images, it appeared evident that this fragment
was unable to fold correctly and be fluorescent.

HPLF1-YFP was mainly found in the cytosolic protein
fraction, even though a clear band was also detected in the
microsomal fraction, thus confirming the localisation of
HPLF1 with ER associated LD. A faint band was also
detected in the plastid fraction. These results could be
indicative of a limited interaction of HPLF with the outer
membrane of this organelle. In this context, confocal
images showed that, in some cases, YFP fluorescence was
very close to plastids (Figs. 2 and 5). Confocal images also
showed a nuclear localisation for HPLF-YFP (Figs. 2, 5, 6).
This pattern was interpreted as a sign of solubility of the
chimera in the cytosol. Despite the large size of HPLF-YFP,
the negligible amount of degraded YFP detected in western blot (see Fig. 5e) confirmed this interpretation.
Interestingly, in tobacco protoplasts co-expressing OLERFP and HPLF1/2-YFP chimeric proteins, the amount of
YFP fluorescence associated with LD showed a significant
increase (compare Figs. 2 and 5). A precise quantification
of this change in fluorescence distribution appeared difficult since each cell can express a different amount of pro-

tein within the same population. Therefore, we counted
the LD detected in several tobacco protoplasts expressing
HPLF1/2-YFP or co-expressing HPLF1/2-YFP and oleosinRFP. In the protoplasts expressing both the chimeric proteins the number of LD detected was three/four times
greater than that found in protoplasts expressing HPLFYFP alone. A representative image of HPLF1-YFP fluorescence distribution in the presence and absence of oleosin
is shown in Fig. 6.
Purified seed lipid bodies can activate HPLF
In a previous work [11], we showed that recombinant
HPLF purified to homogeneity from E. coli cultures is
active in the absence of detergent. Nevertheless, the specific activity of the detergent-free protein is greatly reduced
in comparison with the activity recorded with the enzyme
solubilised in a detergent-containing buffer, or after treatment of the detergent-free protein with detergent micelles.
To verify if purified seed lipid bodies could induce the
conformational changes required for HPLF activation, the
enzyme was purified to homogeneity by immobilised

metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 7A). Sedimentation
analyses on linear sucrose gradients were than compared
of the native detergent-free HPLF with the same enzyme
solubilised in the presence of seed lipid bodies (purified
by sequential washing steps without any detergent) or 5
mM Emulphogene. As shown in Fig. 7B and 7C, HPLF solubilised in the presence of lipid bodies or detergent
peaked at the same fractions (about 8% sucrose concentration), thus showing the same sedimentation constant.
In contrast, the native detergent-free HPLF showed a different sedimentation constant (it peaked one fraction earlier, about 8.4% sucrose concentration; Fig. 7D).
Furthermore, the different fractions recovered from
sucrose gradients after HPLF solubilisation in the presence
of lipid bodies, were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained
by Coomassie blue (data not shown). Our results indicated that oleosin and HPLF peaked at the same fractions,
thus confirming the association between HPLF and lipid
bodies.

Finally, we determined the Km and kcat of purified HPLF
with 13-HPOT, the preferred substrate of the enzyme, in
the presence and absence of purified lipid bodies. A comparison of Figs. 7F and 7F shows clearly that the kinetics
of the interaction between the preferred substrate 13HPOT and HPLF is dramatically affected by the presence
of lipid bodies. The kcat was increased 11-fold in the presence of lipid bodies, which was very similar to the foldincrease observed using synthetic detergent micelle [11];
the kcat value of 724 s-1 indicates that HPLF was fully activated by lipid bodies. Despite the fact that the overall kcat/
Km ratio is relatively unchanged after binding to lipid bodies, it is clear from a plot of substrate concentration vs fold
activation (Fig. 7E, calculated as the ratio of activity with
lipid bodies/activity without lipid bodies using the fitted
data in Figs. 7C, 7D) that HPLF is increasingly activated in
response to substrate supply, and would almost certainly
be activated at physiologically relevant concentrations.

This demonstrates unambiguously that HPLF was activated in the presence of lipid bodies.

Discussion
Volatile aldehydes, produced by the action of HPL are an
essential component of plant oxylipin metabolism, and
play an important role in the plant-environment interaction [4-6]. Most results obtained to date refer to members
of the CYP74B subfamily, which includes 13-HPLs that
are expressed in aerial tissues and associated with plastids.
In the case of HPLE, we have similarly shown that the full
length sequence was able to route YFP to plastids in transiently transformed tobacco protoplasts and leaves. The
fluorescence patterns observed during transient expression of HPLE1-YFP were similar to those recently reported
for potato HPL and AOS enzymes, where the corresponding GFP-tagged chimeras resulted in fluorescent dots associated with thylakoid membranes [14]. Further
experiments are in progress to verify if M. truncatula HPLE
can share a similar localisation inside the plastids.
We have presented new data on the subcellular distribution of 9/13-HPLs belonging to the CYP74C subfamily. 9/
13-HPLs were initially thought to be restricted to the
Cucurbitaceae family, but their occurrence in other plant
species, such as Medicago spp. and rice have been reported
only recently [10,11]. Transient expression in tobacco
protoplasts and leaves, of YFP-tagged HPLF enabled us to

carry out a detailed localisation of this enzyme. Our
results indicated that a cytosolic distribution of fluorescence co-exists with the fluorescence associated with small
spherical organelles.
In previous work [9] we showed that another member of
the CYP74C sub-family, a 9-HPL from almond seed, associates with similar organelles even though it was mainly
localised in the microsomes. In this context, the localisation pattern of the almond 9-HPL differs significantly
from the cytosolic distribution of HPLF and this is the first
report showing such a localisation for HPL.
In the present work, we first showed, by co-localisation
experiments either with oleosin-GFP/Nile red and oleosin
RFP/GFP-KDEL (shown in Fig. 4), that oleosins, when
ectopically expressed in tobacco protoplasts, are specifically targeted to lipid droplets (LD). LD consist of a core
of neutral lipids surrounded by a surface monolayer of
phospholipids and form from specific ER sub-compartments, where neutral lipids are synthesised and accumulated [for a review see [15] and [16]]. Western blot
analyses indicated a main microsomal localisation for
oleosin, when expressed in tobacco protoplasts (Fig. 4c).
Together with the confocal images shown in Fig. 4a and
4b, these results could indicate that, in such a system, LD
are mainly connected to the ER. A support to this interpretation may come from studies in animals, where they have

been extensively studied as a fundamental components of
intracellular lipid homeostasis [16]. A prevalent ER localisation was recently reported for adipophilin one of the
main LD-associated proteins in animal cell [17]. In this
study it was also reported the association of adipophilin
with the cytoplasmic leaflet of ER, closely apposed to the
LD envelope, Noteworthy, they demonstrated for the first
time that LD is not situated within the ER membrane; but
rather both ER membranes follow the contour and
enclose LD. If such ER localisation can be shared by oleosin, when expressed in leaves, still awaits to be confirmed.
The presence of LD showing different size and features
cannon be excluded from results reported in Fig. 4. Indeed
in some cases Nile red and oleosin-GFP do not co-localise
and some LD appeared labelled by only one fluorescence.
Moreover, the size of several LD increased significantly in
the presence of oleosins. The presence of LD of different
size was already reported by Liu et co-workers [18]. They
reported a different localisation for a GFP-tagged barley
caleosin (HvClo1-GFP) and RFP-tagged oleosin (HvOleRFP) in leaf epidermal cells after six hours post-transformation. Indeed, HvClo1-GFP was initially associated with
small lipid droplet, whereas oleosin-RFP associated with
bigger bona fide lipid bodies. Interestingly, the size of these
lipid bodies increased with time together with the colocalisation between the two proteins.
Our results also indicated that M. truncatula HPLF specifically interacts with LD. In this context, co-localisation
experiments with Nile red/oleosin-RFP and HPLF-YFP
were further confirmed by western-blot analyses showing
that HPLF was also detected in the ER fraction, where LD
are recovered, together with the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 5).
The cytosolic distribution of HPLF-YFP was characterised
by the labelling of the nucleus. Such a nuclear localisation
was unexpected because of the large size of chimera. Anyway, it was certainly due to the full chimera since no significant degradation products were detected by western
blot analysis (Fig. 5e).
Interestingly, our results indicated that the amount of
HPLF associated with lipid bodies increased in the presence of oleosin (Fig. 6). The interpretation of images in
this sense was supported by the observation that in all
images analysed, the number of LD significantly increased
in the presence of OLE-RFP.
A key role has been proposed for LD in re-mobilisation of
membrane lipids during senescence of some, an possibly
all, plant tissues [19]. Results here presented together with
others [9,20] pointed out the specific association with LD

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/58

of enzymes, i.e. HPL and peroxygenase, involved in plant
lipid metabolism and oxylipins biosynthesis.
At present the factors governing the association of HPLF
with LD are unclear. However, it is possible to hypothesise
a peripheral interaction between the phospholipid monolayer of LD and a hydrophobic feature displayed on the
surface of the HPLF protein.
The HPLF cDNA clone was isolated from mRNA extracted
from four-week old R. melitoti-inoculated roots and nodules. Notably, several LD were labelled with Nile red in M.
truncatula and A. thaliana hairy roots, thus demonstrating
the presence in vivo of lipid storage compartments in this
non-oil storing tissue where HPLF is expressed (Fig. 3A).
The molecular organisation of root LD is still debated and
currently it is unclear if they can share a similar organisation with seed lipid bodies. In the roots of A. thaliana
plants expressing a sunflower oleosin, the protein was
detected in the ER but not in the lipid body fraction [21].
However, in rapeseed root tips, it was reported that both
caleosin and oleosin were detected, by immunoblotting
and immunolocalisation analyses, in the lipid body fraction [22].
The kinetic analyses we carried out on purified HPLF,
clearly indicated that the interaction with substrate is dramatically affected by the presence of purified lipid bodies.
The increase (11-fold) in the kcat observed in the presence
of lipid bodies was very similar to the fold-increase
observed using synthetic detergent micelle [11] and demonstrates unambiguously that HPLF was fully activated in
the presence of lipid bodies. Unexpectedly, this increase
in kcat was associated with a 13-fold reduction in substrate
affinity, which was opposite to that observed with synthetic detergent micelle. This probably reflects differences
in HPLF binding to the smaller, more defined, detergent
micelles which is presumably much tighter than binding
to the larger, more irregular lipid bodies. Nevertheless, the
looser binding to lipid bodies is clearly sufficient to promote the changes in protein conformation required to
induce the rapid increases in substrate turnover.
Future studies will hopefully be directed at examining the
effects of other purified membrane fractions, on CYP74
enzyme activation.

Conclusion
We provide evidence for the first CYP74C enzyme, to be
targeted to the cytosol and lipid droplets (a schematic representation is shown in Fig. 8). We have also showed by
sedimentation and kinetic analyses carried out on purified
HPLF, that the association with LD or lipid bodies can
result in the protein conformational changes required to
fully activate the enzyme. This activation mechanism,

pG2HPLF1-YFP construct and 5'-TAGGCGCGCCATGCTCCCCTTGAAACCAATCCCAG-3' for pG2HPLF2-YFP
construct and a common reverse primer: 5'-TGCGGCCGCCGACGGTGGATGAAGCCTTAACAAGTG-3'. The
5' end of M. truncatula HPLF encoding the first 11 amino
acids was tagged with YFP using the following two primers: 5'-CGCGCCATGGCTTCCTCATCAGAAACCTCCTCA
ACCAACGGC-3' (forward) and 5'-GGCCGCCGTTGGTTGAGGAGGTTTCTGATGAGGAAGCCATGG-3' (reverse) to
obtain the chimeric construct named pG2HPLF3-YFP. The
cross-dimer produced was subsequently cloned into the
expression vector digested with AscI and NotI.

which supports previous in vitro work with synthetic
detergent micelle, fits well with a mechanism for regulating the rate of release of volatile aldehydes that is
observed soon after wounding or tissue disruption. Further work is needed to identify the molecular mechanisms
governing the distribution of HPLF inside the cell.

Methods
Gene constructs and vector mobilization
HPLE (Acc. No. DQ011231) was tagged with YFP by
directional cloning to the 5' end of the enhanced YFP
(EYFP) gene (Clontech) through the AscI, NotI restriction
sites. The restriction sites were inserted in the HPLE
sequence using the following primers: 5'-TAGGCGCGCCATGTCACTCCCACCACCGATACC-3'
(forward) and 5'-TGCGGCCGCCTTTGGCCTTCCTTAAGGCA
GTAATGG-3' (reverse). The amplified product was cloned
into a modified pGreenII0029 plant expression vector
[23] upstream of the YFP coding sequence. Expression was
driven by a double 35S promoter and 35S terminator. The
final construct was named pG2HPLE1-YFP.

Various fragments of HPLF (Accession No. DQ011231)
were tagged with YFP using the same restriction sites and
the same expression vector as that used for HPLE. Restriction sites were inserted into the M. truncatula HPLF cDNA
using the following forward primers: 5'-TAGGCGCGCCATGGCTTCCTCATCAGAAACCTCC-3'
for

Oleosin-GFP (OLE-GFP) construct was obtained as above
reported [9]. Oleosin-RFP (OLE-RFP) construct was
obtained replacing GFP with RFP (kindly provided by Dr.
Tsien) using the following primers: RFPNhe (5'-AAA GCT
AGC ATG GCC TCC TCC GAG GAC GTC- 3') was used to
insert the NheI site and the reverse primer RFPSph (5'-AAA
GCA TGC TTA GGC GCC GGT GGA GTG GCG- 3') was
used to insert the SphI site.
The GFP-KDEL chimeric construct was prepared as
described [24]. Expression was driven by the 35S promoter and nos terminator.
Plant cultivation and protoplast transient expression
Seeds of Nicotiana tabacum (cv. SR1), A. thaliana (ecotype
Columbia), M. truncatula were germinated and grown in
sterile conditions on solid Murashige and Skoog (MS)
medium supplemented with 3% sucrose at 26°C under
continuous illumination. For root observation and easy
removal before staining, seedlings were grown on vertically oriented MS plates for 5 days [25]. Tobacco and A.
thaliana protoplasts were isolated as previously reported
[26], then cultured and rinsed using the indicated media
and transformed by PEG-mediated direct gene transfer
essentially as described [27,28]. Ten micrograms of plasmid were used for the transformation of about 600000
tobacco protoplasts. Two hours after addition of PEG and
plasmid DNA, the protoplasts were rinsed to remove the
PEG, resuspended in 2 ml culture medium and incubated
at 26°C in the dark.
Lipid staining
Protoplast staining with Nile red was carried out as
reported [9], with the only exception that Nile red was
used instead of Nile blue. Protoplasts were observed after
10 min. incubation in protoplast medium supplemented
with 1 mg/ml dye solution, without any washing step. For
root staining, A. thaliana roots were incubated in a solution of 1 mg/ml Nile red for 5 min., washed with sterile
water and observed by confocal microscopy.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy
Protoplasts transiently expressing fluorescent constructs
were observed by fluorescence microscopy in their culture
medium at different times after transformation. They were
examined with a confocal laser-microscope (LSM Pascal
Zeiss). GFP and YFP were detected with the filter set for
FITC (505–530 nm), RFP with a 560–615 nm filter set,
while chlorophyll epifluorescence was detected with the
filter set for TRITC (> 650 nm). An excitation wavelength
of 488 nm was used. To detect Nile red fluorescence, an
excitation wavelength of 488 nm was used and the emission was recorded with the 560–615 nm filter set. The
"profile" function of Zeiss Pascal software was used to
estimate the YFP fluorescence in adjacent areas/lines of
the same cell. Fluorescence in lipid bodies labelled by
HPLF1/2-YFP was always stronger than in other unidentified areas/structures. The ratio between these fluorescence
values was calculated in the presence and absence of OLERFP chimera and led us to appreciate a 3–4 fold increase
in all analysed images when OLE-RFP was co-expressed.

HPLF purification, kinetic analyses and purification of
seed lipid bodies
Recombinant HPLF was purified to homogeneity from E.
coli BL21 (DE3) cells by immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) as described previously [11]. Steady
state kinetic data were collected using Shimadzu kinetics
software (version 2.7). Activity was determined at 25°C in
a standard assay containing 100 mM sodium phosphate
buffer, pH 6.5 by monitoring the disappearance of substrate at 234 nm. Substrate was diluted from a 20 mM
stock that was stored at -70°C in ethanol; the exact concentration after dilution was determined using a molar
extinction of 25 mM-1.cm-1. Km and kcat for 13-HPOT were
calculated by fitting the data sets to a one site saturation
model for simple ligand binding using SigmaPlot 8
(Sigma-Aldrich). Lipid bodies were isolated from water
melon seeds, by two-layer flotation as previously reported
[9], further purified by two sequential washings with 2.0
M NaCl and finally resuspended in 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, containing 0.6 M sucrose.

Protoplast fractionation
Protoplast pellets (6 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 5 ml
sucrose buffer (0.5 M sucrose in 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,
1 mM EDTA, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma) and lysed by
three consecutive freezing-thawing cycles. Intact cells and
debris were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 ×
g. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 5000 × g to
separate the crude plastidial fraction (fraction A) from the
other proteins (fraction B). The fraction A was resuspended in sucrose buffer and layered onto a three steps
sucrose gradient consisting of 1.45, 0.84, 0.45 M sucrose
and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 hr at 4°C as previously described [29]. After centrifugation intact plastids
were recovered at the interface between 1.45 and 0.80 M
sucrose, diluted with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and centrifuged again at 10000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet
(plastid fraction) was resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample
buffer.

Rate zonal sucrose gradients
Different aliquots of purified HPLF (about 10 µg) were
incubated with 100 mM sodium-phosphate buffer pH
6.5, purified lipid bodies or 5 mM Emulphogene for 15
min at 25°C and than loaded onto linear 5 to 20% (w/w)
sucrose gradients (in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM
NaCl) and centrifuged at 150000 × g for 20 h. After centrifugation, 1 ml fractions were collected from the bottom
of the tube and the sucrose concentration determined.
Proteins from each aliquot were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample
buffer. Western blot analyses were performed according to
the ECL protocol (Amersham) and a 1:4000 dilution of an
anti-His antiserum (Sigma).

Fraction B was used to separate lipid bodies (LB), microsomes and cytosol fractions by two-layer flotation as
above described [9]. After centrifugation at 100000 × g for
1 h at 4°C, the following fractions were recovered: the LB
fraction from the top of the gradient; the cytosolic protein
fraction (10000 × g supernatant); and the microsomal
fraction (100000 × g pellet). The pellet (microsomes) was
resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, whereas the
proteins from the LB and cytosolic protein fraction were
precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in
SDS-PAGE sample buffer.

SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis
Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). Western blot
analyses were performed according to the ECL protocol
(Amersham) and a 1:10000 dilution of an anti-GFP
antiserum (Sigma).
