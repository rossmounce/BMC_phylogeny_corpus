Abstract
Background: The maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, ID1, is a key regulator of the transition to
flowering and the founding member of a transcription factor gene family that encodes a protein
with a distinct arrangement of zinc finger motifs. The zinc fingers and surrounding sequence make
up the signature ID domain (IDD), which appears to be found in all higher plant genomes. The
presence of zinc finger domains and previous biochemical studies showing that ID1 binds to DNA
suggests that members of this gene family are involved in transcriptional regulation.
Results: Comparison of IDD genes identified in Arabidopsis and rice genomes, and all IDD genes
discovered in maize EST and genomic databases, suggest that ID1 is a unique member of this gene
family. High levels of sequence similarity amongst all IDD genes from maize, rice and Arabidopsis
suggest that they are derived from a common ancestor. Several unique features of ID1 suggest that
it is a divergent member of the maize IDD family. Although no clear ID1 ortholog was identified in
the Arabidopsis genome, highly similar genes that encode proteins with identity extending beyond
the ID domain were isolated from rice and sorghum. Phylogenetic comparisons show that these
putative orthologs, along with maize ID1, form a group separate from other IDD genes. In contrast
to ID1 mRNA, which is detected exclusively in immature leaves, several maize IDD genes showed
a broad range of expression in various tissues. Further, Western analysis with an antibody that
cross-reacts with ID1 protein and potential orthologs from rice and sorghum shows that all three
proteins are detected in immature leaves only.
Conclusion: Comparative genomic analysis shows that the IDD zinc finger family is highly
conserved among both monocots and dicots. The leaf-specific ID1 expression pattern distinguishes
it from other maize IDD genes examined. A similar leaf-specific localization pattern was observed
for the putative ID1 protein orthologs from rice and sorghum. These similarities between ID1 and
closely related genes in other grasses point to possible similarities in function.

Background
Comparison of gene families from different plants provides insights into gene functions that have evolved from
common ancestral genes in order to meet unique requirements of each species. The availability of the complete
genome sequences of two plants, the small flowering
dicot, Arabidopsis thaliana [1], and the agronomically
important monocot, rice (Oryza sativa), [2,3] allows for
analysis of gene functions that are shared between these
diverse species. An important but little understood function that is common to all higher plants involves the
mechanism underlying the signals that control time to
flowering. Recent studies suggest that some of the genes
that regulate the floral transition in Arabidopsis have
homologous counterparts with a similar function in rice
[4,5]. Conversely, other genes that control flowering in
rice and maize have no apparent functional equivalent in
Arabidopsis [6,7]. The transition to flowering is mediated
by a complex network of pathways that integrate both
environmental and developmental signals [8] so it is not
surprising that some gene functions are conserved,
whereas other genes appear to have evolved distinctive
functions to meet the specific floral transition requirements within a particular species.
The maize INDETERMINATE1 gene , ID1, may exemplify
a situation where one member of a gene family has
acquired a function that is distinct from other family
members. Loss-of-function id1 mutants remain in a prolonged state of vegetative growth and form aberrant flowers [9,10]. So far, ID1 is the only gene known to have a
major role in controlling the transition to flowering in
maize. Analysis of genes related to ID1 could provide
insights into how modification of an ancestral function
has lead to its current function and could reveal whether
functional homologs of ID1 exist in other plant species.
Recent studies in species such as Arabidopsis and rice
show that transcription factor genes are key components
of genetic networks that control the transition to flowering [11]. Presumably loss of key regulators would affect
the expression of batteries of downstream genes that
mediate the complex transition process [12]. Evidence for
recent genome duplications throughout eukaryotic evolution [13-15], might imply that the functions of many
genes are redundant and may not be uncovered by singlegene mutation analysis. Therefore it is of interest to analyze entire gene families at the genomic level in order to
predict possible gene functions and to examine how new
functions evolve from those of shared ancestral genes.
This may be especially significant in the case of transcription factors, which are modular in nature; i.e., they typically contain a DNA-binding domain and a separate
activator or repressor domain. The latter domain is important for controlling the expression of genes that contain cis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/158

elements that are recognized by the DNA-binding domain
[16]. Diverse new functions may be generated from the
"mixing and matching" of DNA binding domains with
other elements of the proteins, resulting in the control of
other networks of genes.
The ID1 protein contains Cys2His2 type zinc finger motifs
that are related to animal regulator proteins such as Krüppel in Drosophila and Xfin in Xenopus [17]. Zinc fingers are
one of the most abundant class of regulatory proteins represented in the eukaryotic genomes that have been
sequenced to date [18,19] and, in Arabidopsis, zinc fingers apparently comprise the largest group of putative regulatory genes [20]. As the complete sequences of more
genomes become available, greater effort is being directed
at comparative studies of genes and gene families from
different organisms [21]. Genome-based approaches
focus on questions about specific genes and gene families
with regard to the function of ancestral genes, and how
these genes evolved to suit the specific developmental
requirements of particular organisms.
Here we analyze the zinc finger proteins encoded by the
family of IDD genes found in two plants with sequenced
genomes, rice and Arabidopsis, and compare them with
the ID1 gene and all known ID1-related genes identified
in available maize sequence databases. Comparison of the
sequences and structures of the IDD genes in these three
species suggests that maize ID1 is a unique member of this
gene family, although putative functional homologs of
ID1 were discovered in the related grass species rice, as
well as sorghum.

Results
Maize ID1 defines the ID-domain containing transcription
factor gene family
The ID1 gene was tagged with a Ds2 transposable element
that facilitated isolation of a full-length coding sequence
[22]. In initial attempts to isolate the ID1 coding
sequence, cDNA libraries made from 3-leaf seedling, vegetative apex, and developing inflorescence were screened
with a portion of the ID1 genomic sequence. More than
50 hybridizing clones were isolated from these libraries
and found to correspond to 4 different classes of cDNAs
that were similar to ID1, however none of them corresponded to the maize ID1 gene. These clones were designated ID-domain genes (IDD), and given the names
ZmIDDp1, ZmIDDp10, ZmIDDveg7 and ZmIDDveg9.
Comparison of the ID1 cDNA sequence with the four
related cDNA clones revealed that they shared a highly
conserved region of ~170 amino acids (Figures 1, 2). This
conserved ID-domain (IDD), has a putative nuclear localization sequence at the N-terminal border consisting of
charged lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues [23], followed by four distinct zinc finger motifs. Two of the ID-

domain zinc fingers have the hallmarks of the TFIIIA zinc
finger class of proteins, whereas the other two zinc fingers
have atypical structures and were identified by visual
inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence and biochemical analysis of DNA binding properties [24].
Low-stringency BLAST searches of available NCBI nucleotide and protein databases with ID1 and the maize IDD
genes (ZmIDD) as query sequences revealed significant
similarity to zinc finger proteins from animals and yeast,
as well as plants. The highest level of similarity, however,
was found in a particular sub-group of plant zinc finger
genes, as described below. That is, the extent of similarity
of maize ID1 and ZmIDD genes to animal and yeast
sequences was limited mostly to the positioning of the
zinc-interacting C and H residues and the conserved
hydrophobic residues that define this protein class. [25],
whereas the plant sequences have extensive similarity
throughout the ID-domain (Figure 2) as well as some conserved domains in the C-terminal region (Figure 3). ID-

domain proteins therefore define a sub-group of zinc fingers that is highly conserved in higher plants.
A complete, annotated maize genome sequence is not yet
available, but a large number of sequences have been collected in the GSS (Genome Survey Sequence) database,
which contains gene-enriched maize DNA sequences
derived by methylation filtration [13,26], High-Cot
enrichment and other methods that reduce repetitive
sequences [44]. We extracted and reconstructed 20 partial
and full-length maize IDD genes from the GSS collection.
A large collection of maize EST and cDNA sequences
recently made available by biotechnology companies and
distributed by the National Corn Growers Association
(NCGA) were used to complete most maize IDD
sequences [[47]]. Derivation of IDD cDNAs from these
resources allowed the intron-exon structure and fulllength versions of 20 IDD genes to be deciphered, except
for ZmIDD8, for which a definitive stop codon could not
be assigned (Figure 1). Only one IDD gene, ZmIDD7, was

found in the NCGA collection that was not found also in
GSS or the public EST/cDNA databases. This suggests that
the combined sequences of these two databases have
extensive overlap and likely represent a large portion of
the maize gene space. A similar level of coverage was
reported for 78 full-length cDNAs that were used to determine the level of coverage of the GSS database and public
EST and cDNA collections.

Although the Arabidopsis and rice genomes each have
clearly identifiable IDD genes (described below, Figure 2),
no phenotype associated with the loss of IDD gene function has been reported yet in these species. Maize has at
least 20 IDD genes (Figure 2), but so far only mutations in
the ID1 gene have been shown to have an effect on plant
growth; i.e., a severe effect on flowering time and floral
development [22].

Maize IDD and ID1 genes have diverse expression
patterns
A previous study found that ID1 mRNA is expressed only
in immature leaves and is not detectable in the shoot apical meristem region, leaf primordia or in mature leaves
[22]. This highly specific expression pattern suggests that
ID1 has a role in mediating the production or the transmission of a leaf-derived floral inductive signal [10]. To
compare the ID1 expression pattern with other maize IDD
genes we used Northern hybridization and gene-specific
probes to the 4 IDD genes isolated from maize cDNA
libraries: ZmIDDp1, ZmIDDp10, ZmIDDveg7 and
ZmIDDveg9, as well as 3 other ZmIDD genes, ZmIDD3,
ZmIDD7, ZmIDD13, with probes isolated by PCR (Figure
4). We found that each of these 7 maize IDD genes had
distinct expression patterns and that none of them exhibited tissue-specific expression similar to ID1 (Figure 4). In
all cases the range of expression is broader than ID1, with
mRNA of ZmIDD genes detected in most plant tissues
(Figure 4). For example, whereas ID1 mRNA is confined
to immature leaves and is clearly absent from other shoot
tissues, ZmIDDp1 mRNA is detected in all vegetative tissues, and is especially abundant in tissues enriched for
shoot and root apical meristems (Figure 4A). Similar to
ID1, the ZmIDDp10 gene is detected in immature leaves,
albeit at a much lower level, but it is also expressed at low
levels in root and is barely detectable in floral tissues (Figure 4A). ZmIDDveg9, which was isolated from a vegetative
shoot apex cDNA library, is detected in apical meristemenriched tissues, but is also found in immature leaves,
roots and, at a lesser level, in tassels (Figure 4A). In contrast, ZmIDDveg7, which was isolated from the same vegetative meristem cDNA library as ZmIDDveg9, shows a
similar expression pattern, except that it is expressed at
higher levels in floral tissues and it is detected in apical
regions and leaf primordia but to a lesser extent in more
developed immature leaves.

Transcripts of ZmIDD3 and ZmIDD7 show nearly identical patterns; they are present in all tissues tested but highest amounts are seen in the stem region below the shoot
apex (Figure 4B). In contrast, ZmIDD13 mRNA is abundant in flag leaf, tassel inflorescence and roots, but is
barely detectable in stem, the shoot apex region or developing leaves (Figure 4B). Further, transcripts of all ZmIDD
genes examined, except for ID1, are detected in the tassel
inflorescence (Figure 4). Overall, the 7 maize IDD genes
tested show wide-ranging expression in all shoot tissues
tested and, unlike ID1, are not confined to immature leaf
tissue.
Isolation of putative ID1 orthologs from rice and sorghum
Before the first annotated draft of the rice genomic
sequence was released, a genomic BAC (Bacterial Artificial
Chromosome) library from the Clemson University
Genomics Institute [[45]] with ten times genome coverage
of the Japonica variety of Oryza sativa was screened for
IDD genes. From this screen 137 BACs that hybridized to
a full-length maize ID1 probe were identified. Of these, a
subset of 14 BACs hybridized to a probe derived from ID1
sequences outside the ID domain (data not shown). A 6.6
kb fragment common to all 14 BACs was isolated and
found to contain a coding region with a high level of similarity to maize ID1; this gene was designated OsID. Maize
ID1 and rice OsID have a similar exon/intron structure
common to most IDD genes; i.e., a small intron in the 5'
region and a large intron that splits the fourth zinc finger
(Figure 1). However, widespread regions of similarity
were also found outside the ID-domain in both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the deduced OsID protein (Figure 2). That is, upstream of the putative nuclear
localization sequence that delineates the left border of the
ID domain and downstream of the fourth zinc finger
(ZF4), which marks the right border.

The OsID gene was identified in the first draft of the rice
genome [2,3] and no other gene with greater similarity to
maize ID1 than OsID was detected. Although the current
draft of the rice genome may not contain all genes [28],
the fact that we only detected OsID in the BAC library
screening suggests that it is the closest homolog to ID1 in
the rice genome. Further, analysis of syntenic regions of
the rice and maize genomes indicate that OsID, which is
located on rice chromosome 10, lies in a region syntenic
with maize chromosome 1, in the region where ID1 is
located [28].
In addition to rice, we searched recently available Sorghum
bicolor methylation filtered genomic sequences [29] and
identified a closely related IDD gene, designated SbID,
with significant homology to maize ID1 and rice OsID. As
with OsID, SbID has extensive regions of identity outside
the ID domain (Figure 3). Overall, the full-length SbID

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/158

and OsID proteins are 84% and 61% identical to ID1 protein, respectively. Thus, the level of identity of sorghum
SbID to maize ID1 is the highest of any gene identified so
far. The level of similarity shared by ID1, OsID and SbID,
indicate that these genes are closely related and could
share homologous functions.
To investigate whether these related grass genes have similar expression patterns, an anti-ID1 antibody specific for
the C-terminal 20 amino acids of ID1 was used to analyse
where OsID and SbID proteins are localized in developing
rice and sorghum. The deduced C-terminal peptide
sequences of SbID and OsID proteins are nearly identical
to the C-terminal 20 amino acids of ID1; i.e., SbID and
OsID share 19/20 and 18/20 amino acids, respectively
(Figure 5). Figure 6 shows that this antibody cross-reacts
with a single protein of the expected size in each species.
Interestingly, similar to maize ID1, OsID and SbID proteins are detected exclusively in immature leaves and are
absent in mature leaves and the region of the shoot apex
(Figure 6). Furthermore, all three IDD proteins are absent
in floral tissues in all species. Therefore the identical localization patterns of ID1 and its putative orthologs SbID
and OsID show that all three genes have similar expression patterns.
The Arabidopsis and rice genomes have similar numbers of
IDD genes
The conserved ID-domain encoding sequence of maize
ID1 was used to search for related genes in the Arabidopsis genome. We found 16 Arabidopsis ID-domain encoding genes with comparable levels of similarity to ID1 and
the IDD genes from maize (Table 1). The Arabidopsis IDD
genes, designated as AtIDD, share levels of amino acid
identity with the ID-domain of maize ID1 that range from
63% to 84% (Table 1), but, as was found with the ZmIDD
genes, there is little homology in sequences outside the 5'
and 3' ID-domain coding regions, except in a few defined
regions of certain genes, as described below (Figure 2).
However, within this group of 16 genes, AtIDD14,
AtIDD15 and AtIDD16 are more closely related to one
another and diverge from the other 13 AtIDD genes,
showing only 63 to 64% identity to ID1 (Table 1). Some
of this divergence is the result of absence of conserved
sequences outside regions encoding the ID domain. No
other zinc finger families in Arabidopsis exhibit this level
of similarity.

Englbrecht et al [20] defined a subfamily of 24 genes in
Arabidopsis, called A1, that encode proteins with a configuration of four zinc fingers. They designated the 16 AtIDD
genes defined here as a subclass of this group of 24, with
the 13 genes most similar to maize ID1 termed A1a and 3
divergent members, AtIDD14, AtIDD15 and AtIDD16,
comprising the A1b group. However, as a group the 16

corresponding sequences in rice and sorghum.

AtIDD genes are much more divergent from the other 8
genes of the A1 grouping (A1c and A1d). That is, the zinc
finger domains encoded by AtIDD genes are 63% to 84%
identical to the maize ID1 zinc finger domain (Table 1),
whereas they share less than 40% amino acid identity to
the A1c and A1d members. Therefore we designate AtIDD
genes as a separate family based on their similarity to
maize ID1. Furthermore, the similarity between AtIDD
genes extends beyond the zinc binding motifs and
includes amino acid sequences that extend upstream and
downstream of this region (Figure 3). Overall, the IDdomain is the defining feature shared by IDD proteins
from Arabidopsis and maize.
Sequences searches of the current draft of the rice genome
have revealed 15 ID-related genes, including OsID, which
is comparable to the 16 IDD genes of Arabidopsis. This
number of ID1-related genes in rice is in the range
expected based on the 137 IDD-hybridizing BACs
described above. Members of the rice family encoding IDdomain zinc finger proteins are designated OsIDD genes.
The deduced proteins of OsIDD genes have a comparable

level of similarity to each other and to IDD proteins of
both maize and Arabidopsis (Table 1). In addition,
OsIDD gene structures are similar to the structure of
ZmIDD and AtIDD genes. For example, an intron splits
the fourth zinc finger, ZF4, in all IDD genes from these
three species, except for maize ZmIDD3 and ZmIDD4
genes (Figure 1). A common structural feature shared by
all IDD genes is an intron that separates the 5' end of the
gene from the ID-domain coding region (Figure 1).
A feature unique to the maize ID1 sequence is an intron
that splits the second zinc finger, ZF2 (Figure 1). Even
though OsID has extensive regions of identity to maize
ID1 within the ID domain coding region as well as outside
the domain, it does not have an intron within ZF2. The
SbID gene, like ID1, is the only other IDD gene with an
intron splitting the coding region of ZF2 (Figure 1). This
shared feature of ID1 and SbID likely reflects the closer
evolutionary distance between these two plants relative to
rice; i.e., 16.5 million years between sorghum and maize
vs. 70 million years between rice and maize [14]. Overall,
comparison of the structure of maize and Arabidopsis

IDD genes, including ID1, showed that, with a few exceptions, overall intron/exon structure is conserved (Figure
1).
Other conserved motifs are found outside the ID domain of
IDD proteins
Apart from the Iarge ID-domain, many IDD family members have small domains of similarity in the C-terminal
region of the deduced protein (Figure 3). Two conserved
regions that stand out are the "TRDFLG" domain, which
is found in maize ID1 and many IDD proteins that are
most similar to ID1, such as OsID and SbID, and the MSATALLQKAA domain. The TRDFLG motif is largely invariant, except in cases such as AtIDD1 and OsIDD1 where
the sequence is TLDFLG, OsIDD7 and ZmIDD7, which
contain the sequence TQDFLG, and the potato PCP1
deduced protein, which has the sequence TKDFLG (Figure
3).

The MSATALLQKAA motif is present in most of the Arabidopsis IDD genes and many maize and rice IDD genes,
but it does not occur in ID1, OsID or SbID proteins (Figure 3). The presence of the TRDFLG sequence does not

exclude the presence of MSTALLQKAA domains, and may
reflect the modular nature of IDD regulatory proteins.
Phylogenetic comparison of IDD genes from diverse plant
species
Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from genomic DNA
sequences from the conserved zinc finger region of all
known IDD genes from maize, Arabidopsis and rice,
along with the single PCP1 sequence from potato and
SbID from sorghum showed extensive divergence of ID1like sequences in all well-sampled species (Figure 7). No
clear outgroup could be identified to root the tree in such
a way that would allow conclusions about ancestral
sequences, as the sequences are only alignable in the zinc
finger domains that define the group and no other related
sequences could be found that had a sufficient degree of
overlap. However, the unrooted (not shown) and midpoint rooted phylograms both suggested independent
diversification of the gene family in grasses compared to
those in potato and Arabidopsis (Figure 7).

In Arabidopsis, AtIDD14, AtIDD15, and AtIDD16 (classified as A1b by Englbrecht et al [20]) were clearly divergent
from the rest of the AtIDD sequences, whose relationships

Phylogenetic analyses based on amino acid sequences
gave different trees than those based on nucleotide
sequences, but may reflect functional similarities among
highly divergent proteins between species (compare Figures 7 and 8). In particular, the amino acid analyses indicated mixed clustering of genes between Arabidopsis and
grasses whereas this was not seen in the genomic DNA
analysis. Circled sets of sequences with the same letters are
those that form highly supported "mixed" groups in the
amino acid but not the nucleotide-based analyses. Note in
particular that the two most divergent groups of
sequences within each group clustered together in the
amino acid analysis (circles labeled 'A'), based on sharing
of unique domains not found in the other sequence types
(although the branch lengths separating them are very
long). Similarly, AtIDD1 and AtIDD2 appeared to be functionally related to ZmIDD1 and OsIDD1 (circles labeled
'B') and ZmIDD7/OsIDD7 appeared to be most functionally related to Arabidopsis sequences AtIDD9, AtIDD10,
AtIDD12 and AtIDD13 (circles labeled 'C'). Sequences in
rectangles labeled 'D' are quite divergent from one
another but formed a weakly supported (pp = 87) grouping between grasses and Arabidopsis (and potato)
sequences. Importantly, no functional equivalent was
found for the ID1/OsID/SbID group (circle labeled 'E') in
Arabidopsis and their relationship to the ZmIDD6/
OsIDD9 and ZmIDD8/ZmIDD10/OsIDD5 groups was not
well resolved in the amino acid analysis.

Discussion
The maize ID1 flowering time gene encodes a putative
transcription factor with four distinct types of zinc finger
motifs [24]. Initial searches for similar genes revealed that
ID1 is the first, genetically defined member of a highly
conserved family of proteins that are found in all plant
genome databases. The high level of similarity of IDD
genes from species as diverse as monocots and dicots is a
striking feature of this gene family. Here we have performed a comparative analysis of all available members of
the IDD family from three species: maize, rice and Arabidopsis, as well as individual sequences from potato and
sorghum. The complete genome sequences available for
rice and Arabidopsis show that these species have 15 and
16 IDD genes, respectively. Analysis of GSS sequence data
and an extensive maize cDNA/EST collection defined at
least 21 IDD genes in maize, including ID1. The finding
that maize has significantly more genes than either rice or
Arabidopsis is likely due to the possible allotetraploid origin of the maize genome [14]. Given that the maize

genome sequence is incomplete, it is possible that more
IDD genes will be found. However, a recent evaluation of
available maize genomic resources suggests that approximately 95% of the maize gene space has been at least partially uncovered [27]. A notable finding of our study is
that, with the exception of one gene, unambiguous full-

The functions of most IDD genes are not known
The IDD genes most closely related to maize ID1 are the
rice OsID gene and the sorghum SbID gene (Figure 5).
OsID maps to chromosome 10 of the rice genome and
does not coincide with any genes known to influence
heading date, nor for other QTLs for flowering time in rice
[30,31]. However, QTL analysis can be limited by the populations examined, therefore analysis of rice from different geographical locations may yet uncover QTLs that
correspond to OsID. Transgenic experiments where OsID
is over-expressed or its expression is eliminated or reduced
by gene silencing techniques are in progress to reveal
whether OsID has a role in controlling flowering time in
rice, and also if maize ID1 can control flowering in a heterologous grass species (A. Kozaki and J. Colasanti,
unpublished).

Apart from the role of ID1 in controlling the transition to
flowering in maize, no other IDD gene with a genetically
defined biological function has been reported. The IDD
gene from potato, PCP1, was isolated in a screen for
cDNAs that could rescue a yeast strain deficient in sucrose
transport [32]. As a possible explanation for this finding
the authors suggest that PCP1 may activate a previously
unidentified sucrose transport system in yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae normally is not capable of this function
because yeast excretes invertase to metabolize external disaccharides and converts them into hexoses that are transported into the cell. The in planta biological role of PCP1
remains unresolved, and no follow-up reports have been
forthcoming. However, it is intriguing to speculate that
PCP1, and perhaps other IDD genes, may have a role in
sugar metabolism in higher plants. This is especially interesting in light of evidence that sucrose, perhaps in combination with other metabolites, may play an important
role in signaling the transition to flowering [33]. If any of
the IDD genes have a role in linking sucrose metabolism
to plant development, it might be propitious to look for
such a function amongst the maize, rice and Arabidopsis
IDD genes that are most closely related to PCP1 (Figure 8,
rectangle labeled 'D'). Of course such speculation needs to
be supported by functional determination.
The extensive reverse genetic resources available for Arabidopsis allow for a functional genomic analysis of AtIDD
genes. For example, we have recently discovered that loss
of function of one of the divergent IDD genes, AtIDD15,
has an effect on lateral shoot branching in Arabidopsis (H.
Tanimoto, R. Tremblay, S. Chatfield and J. Colasanti,
unpublished). Whether mutations in other AtIDD genes
affect Arabidopsis growth and development is a subject of
current investigation.

Conserved regions exist outside the ID-domain
The designated ID-domain starts with a putative nuclear
localization signal (usually KKKR or KRKR) and ends 9
amino acid residues beyond the last C residue of the
fourth zinc finger (Figure 2). The high degree of conservation of this region in IDD proteins clearly delineates
members of the ID1-related gene family. However, there
are sequence motifs outside the ID-domain that allow for
further sub-groupings of this gene family. A prominent
conserved sequence found in maize ID1 and most other
IDD genes is the TR/L/Q/DFLG sequence located near the
C-terminus. In Arabidopsis, 13 of the 16 AtIDD proteins
have either a TRDFLG or TLDFLG sequence, and 11 of the
15 rice OsIDD sequences have this motif. In both rice and
Arabidopsis, IDD peptides without this sequence fall into
a more divergent group, with the exception of OsIDD9
and ZmIDD6, which both lack this sequence and are
closely related to each other (Figures 7 and 8). Clearly this
motif has been conserved across lineages, suggesting a
possible function such as in mediating protein-protein
interactions. However, at present it is difficult to unambiguously assign activator or repressor function to
domains within transcription factors without biochemical
characterization [16]. BLAST analyses of short peptide
sequences with TRDFLG, TLDFLG and TQDFLG as a query
sequence show no other type of protein consistently harboring this motif except for IDD genes from higher plants.

The MSATALLQKAA sequence is another small motif outside of the ID-domain that is shared by some ID1-related
gene family members. This motif is absent in maize ID1,
yet is present in other ZmIDD peptides for which
sequences are available. The divergent group of IDD proteins from maize, rice and Arabidopsis (the 'A' cluster in
Figure 8) that do not have the TR/L/Q/DFLG motif similarly lack the MSATALLQKAA motif. It is interesting to
note that these deduced proteins, which group together
based on the similarities in their IDD sequences only, also
show major differences outside the ID domain. This suggests that these sequences diverged early in angiosperm
evolution and may have acquired separate and distinct
functions.
Maize ID1 has several distinctive features
Several lines of evidence suggest that maize ID1 is functionally distinct from IDD genes. First, maize id1 mutants
have a dramatic late flowering phenotype, whereas mutations in other ZmIDD genes have not been reported. Second, a 45 amino acid spacer separates zinc fingers ZF1 and
ZF2 of the ID1 protein, whereas the majority of IDD proteins examined here have 20 or 21 amino acids between
the first two zinc fingers. The putative ID1 orthologs from
rice (OsID) and sorghum (SbID) also have longer spacers
between the first two zinc fingers than most IDD genes,
with 29 and 35 amino acids, respectively. Other excep-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/158

tions include ZmIDD16 and OsIDD14, but these genes
belong to the divergent class of IDD genes found in all
three species (the 'A' grouping in Figure 6) and therefore
it is unlikely that they share a common function. Other
exceptions include ZmIDD6 and OsIDD9, which have an
additional 7 amino acids between ZF1 and ZF2. It is interesting to note that phylogenetic comparison reveals these
two genes to be more closely related to each other than to
other IDD genes from their own species and that ZmIDD6
and OsIDD9 appear to be the most closely related to the
ID1/SbID/OsID cluster (Figures 7 and 8).
Finally, ID1 has a distinctive expression pattern that is not
shared by the 7 ZmIDD genes examined here. So far, ID1
is the only maize IDD gene whose mRNA is detected
exclusively in immature leaves, thus leading to speculation that ID1 regulates the transmission of leaf-derived
floral inductive signals [10]. The finding that, similar to
ID1, proteins encoded by the prospective ID1 orthologs
from rice (OsID) and sorghum (SbID) are localized to
immature leaves exclusively is intriguing because it suggests that these genes may regulate flowering time in
related grass species. Genetic analysis of OsID and SbID is
required to confirm this possibility.
One mechanism to target the activity of a regulatory protein is to restrict its expression to a particular tissue. A
recent study found that one member of the 11 gene cytokinin oxidase family in rice, OsCKX2, had an expression
pattern that differed from all other family members [34].
Although other members of the family had similar enzymatic activity in reducing cytokinin levels, the higher level
of OsCKX expression in high yielding rice is suggested to
explain phenotypic differences correlated with high yield
rice. Similarly, the restriction of ID1 expression to developing leaves of maize may be explained by a specific function of this putative regulatory protein in controlling leaf
derived floral inductive signals. No maize IDD genes
examined here had an expression pattern similar to or
restrictive as ID1. It is possible that one or more of the
other ZmIDD genes that were not examined have expression patterns similar to ID1, however the degree of divergence of ID1 from all other ZmIDD genes suggest that they
might not perform the same function, even if they had
similar expression patterns. This can be tested once probes
for all ZmIDD genes are available. Whether differences in
the activity of each IDD gene is the result of its expression
or because of subtle differences in regulatory action might
be revealed by further genetic analyses of the function of
each gene.
Origin of the ID-domain gene family
Eukaryotic transcription factors can be classified into two
basic groups based on their origins; those common to all
lineages (plants, animals and fungi), and those specific to

Page 13 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:158

a particular lineage that evolved novel functions to carry
out particular developmental needs of the organisms [35].
The IDD zinc finger proteins appear to be a hybrid of both
types of transcription factor [24]. Zinc finger proteins are
found in all eukaryotic lineages, suggesting that they are
derived from a common eukaryote ancestor. However, the
zinc finger family of transcription factors is diverse and
can be divided into many subgroups based on a common
structural feature; i.e., cysteine and/or histidine residues
in a configuration that facilitates protein folding such that
each finger interacts with a particular nucleotide
sequence. Given the modular nature of zinc finger proteins, it is possible that during the course of evolution a
"mixing and matching" of zinc finger units could occur to
generate binding domains of a particular type. For example the CONSTANS family of transcription factors, some
of which have an important role in photoperiod induced
floral induction, appear to have a unique combination of
zinc fingers [36].
We suggest that the arrangement of zinc finger modules in
the ID domain has evolved to generate a class of zinc fingers that is unique to plants. That is, IDD proteins are
derived from common zinc finger domains and act
together to form a plant lineage-specific regulatory family.
In addition to two canonical zinc fingers, IDD proteins
also contain two unusual CCHC fingers, one of which is
related to a zinc finger found in the S. cerevisiae SWI5 protein [24]. This combination of standard and unique zinc
finger domains defines the IDD family found in all plants.

Conclusion
Maize ID1 defines the IDD gene family that is present in
higher plants. Analysis of the Arabidopsis and rice
genomes reveals 16 and 15 IDD genes, respectively. Therefore the highly conserved IDD gene family is common to
both monocots and dicots. From available genomic and
EST/cDNA resources we have discovered 20 additional
full-length IDD genes in maize, indicating that a large portion of the maize gene space may be represented. Within
maize, expression of the ID1 gene is limited to a particular
tissue, whereas expression patterns of several ZmIDD
genes are broader. Phylogenetic comparison of IDD genes
reveals that ID1 and putative ID1 orthologs from rice and
sorghum form a subgroup distinct from other IDD genes.
Further, the finding that OsID and SbID proteins, like
ID1, are confined to immature leaf tissue during development supports the possibility that they have a similar
function in regulating the floral transition in these species.
Overall, it seems likely that the zinc finger configuration
of IDD proteins was established in an ancestral plant species and has been maintained throughout evolution. The
reason for the maintenance of the ID-domain suggests a
general, plant-specific function but, apart from for the role

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/158

of maize ID1 in regulating the transition to flowering, the
functions of all other IDD genes remain to be elucidated.

Methods
Plant growth conditions
All plants (maize, rice and sorghum) were grown in soil
pots in greenhouses from August to November with
sodium vapor lamps providing supplemental lighting for
16 hours day/8 hours night. Temperature was maintained
at 26°C during the day and 20°C at night.
Isolation of maize ID1 and IDD cDNA clones
ID1 cDNA was isolated from a B73 immature leaf library
made from 3 week old seedlings. Immature leaf tissue
included all non-green leaves extending from 4 cm to 10
cm above the vegetative shoot apex. Total RNA was
extracted from this tissue with TRIZOL reagent (GibcoBRL) and polyA+ mRNA was selected from total RNA with
an Oligotex mRNA purification kit (Qiagen). A primary
cDNA library of 1.3 × 106 plaques was constructed in the
pBluescriptSK- vector using the λ-ZAP cDNA library construction kit (Stratagene). Approximately 106 plaques
were plated on nylon filters and hybridized with a P32labeled 666 bp probe amplified from the unique 3' end of
the ID1 coding region as deduced from the genomic
sequence. The cDNA clones from four positive plaques
were isolated, analysed and found to correspond to the
ID1 mRNA; three of the ID1 cDNA clones were fulllength.

ZmIDD genes were isolated from similar screens as
described above except that a 575 bp probe derived from
the conserved region of the ID1 genomic sequence (from
nucleotide 127 to 702) was used to screen ~106 plaques
each from a vegetative shoot apex library (a gift from the
Hake Laboratory, USDA-Plant Gene Expression Center,
Albany, CA) and a 3-leaf seedling library (a gift of Alice
Barkan, University of Oregon); both libraries were made
with mRNA from maize inbred B73. A total of 23 clones
were isolated and sequenced; 6 from the 3-leaf seedling
library and 17 clones from the vegetative apex library.
These represented 4 different IDD cDNAs, none of which
corresponded to ID1. ZmIDDp1 and ZmIDDp10 cDNAs
were found in both libraries, and ZmIDDveg7 and
ZmIDDveg9 were found only in the vegetative apex
library. Full-length sequences of each cDNA were determined and the sequences submitted to GenBank. Partial
amino acid sequence of ZmIDDp1 was reported in the
original paper describing isolation of the ID1 gene [22].
Northern blotting and expression analysis of maize
ZmIDD genes
Expression of ID1 and ZmIDD genes was examined by
Northern analysis with poly A+ selected mRNAs from various tissues as described previously [22]. Probes specific

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:158

for ZmIDDp1, ZmIDDp10, ZmIDDveg7 and ZmIDDveg9
were derived from restriction fragments excised from each
cDNA plasmids. The specific DNA fragments were SacI/
XhoI (580 bp) from pZmIDDp1, SacI/XhoI (485 bp) from
pZmIDDp10, SacI/XhoI (550 bp) from pZmIDDveg7 and
XhoI (970 bp) from pZmIDDveg9. Probe DNA for other
ZmIDD genes were isolated by PCR amplification with
specific primers in non-conserved regions of each gene.
Only 3 specific probes for the remaining 16 ZmIDD genes
could be isolated from genomic DNA. The ZmIDD3
probe was amplified with 3L (AGGGACAGCTTCATCACG) and 3R (AATCCCTGGTCTCCTCCCTC), ZmIDD7
with 7L (CACACACGTCGGAAGAAGAATC) and 7R
(TCCTCTGCTTCAGCTTCCATG) and ZmIDD13 with 13L
(ACGTTAACCTCCTGGACATTG)
and
13R
(TACTAGTCTCCCGGACGCTG). Attempts to isolate PCR
products for the remaining ZmIDD genes were not successful. A specific probe for the maize CDC2 gene
(ZmCDC2) was derived from a cDNA clone as previously
described [37]. The actin probe was amplified from B73
maize genomic DNA with primers described by Vollbrecht et al. [38]. All DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels and labeled with [32P]dCTP with a random
primed labeling kit (Fermentas). Nylon membranes were
stripped and probed sequentially with each probe for
Northern blots in Figure 4A and 4B separately.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Proteins were extracted from vegetative tissues (mature
leaf (ML), immature leaf (IL) and apical regions (Ap) of 3week old maize (Zea mays) B73 seedlings, 6 to7 week old
rice plants (Oryza sativa, var. Japonica) and 4 to 6 week red
sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Proteins from maize floral tissues were extracted from 2 cm ear primordia (FP). Proteins extracted from rice floral tissues included main
inflorescence primordia (FP) at the 2 to 4 cm stage and
mature floral spikelets before anther dehiscence (F);
equivalent tissues were used for protein extraction from
sorghum. Visualization of ID1, OsID and SbID proteins
with anti-ID1 antibody by Western blotting required
enrichment for nuclear proteins following a modification
of the protocol by Steinmuller and Apel [39]. Briefly,
plant tissues (0.5 to 1.0 gm) were collected, ground to a
fine powder in liquid nitrogen and put in 5 mL of cold
Isolation Buffer (IB: 20 mM Tris-HCl, ph 7.8, 250 mM
sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, 40% (v/v) glycerol,
0.25% (v/v) TritonX-100, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). This suspension was filtered through 50 μM nylon
mesh, centrifuged at 6,000 g for 10 minutes and the pellet
was washed twice with cold IB, and resuspended in 50 μL
of IB. A portion of this was used for quantification with a
protein assay kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and 50 μL of Laemmli loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% (w/
v) SDS, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromophenol
blue) was added to the remainder. Duplicate samples of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/158

proteins (50 to 100 μg) were resolved on 11% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes by semi-dry blotting (Owl Scientific),
or stained with Coomassie blue to confirm protein quantity and assess protein integrity. For Western blots PVDF
membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk
in Tris-buffered saline, TBS (20 mM Tris-buffered, 137
mM NaCl, pH 7.7) with 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20. Affinitypurified anti-ID1 antibody was used at 1/300 to 1/500
dilution in TBS-Tween/5% milk solution and incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature. Blots were washed with
TBS-Tween 6 times for 10 min each and then incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
antibody (Amersham) at 1/10,0000 dilution, and then
washed as above. Bound antibodies were detected with
Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate
(Pierce, Woburn, MA) and exposure to XAR X-ray film
(Kodak).
Genomic and protein sequence analysis alignment
TBLASTX searches were performed using databases available from the National Center for Biological Information
web site. The nucleotide sequence of the ID domain of
ID1 was used to search both Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza
sativa genomic databases for IDD genes. For maize IDD
genes, the GSS database was used. Sequence reconstruction was performed using BioEdit Sequence Alignment
Editor [40]. Alignments of deduced IDD proteins were
performed using CLUSTALW software and manually corrected.
Phylogenetic analysis of the IDD gene family
Nucleotide sequences were aligned by first translating to
proteins and then using Se-Al version 2.0. Se-Al: Sequence
alignment editor, version 1.0 alpha1 [46] was used to
manually align protein motifs. Most sequences were
alignable only in the region of the ID domain. Sequences
were pruned to include only these shared domains, which
included sequence from the NLS motif at the amino terminus to 9 amino acids after the last C residue of ZF4 (and
any intervening regions that could be aligned for all
sequences without ambiguity), resulting in a 708 bp fragment after back-translating to nucleotide sequences. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for both nucleotide and
amino acid alignments using Mr. Bayes version 3.0 [41].
For nucleotide sequences, the most appropriate model of
evolution to explain the data (general time reversible
model estimating separate rates of change for each type of
nucleotide substitution, with both invariant sites and
gamma distribution shape parameter estimated to
account for rate heterogeneity) was determined using
Model Test version 3.5 [42], in conjunction with PAUP*
4.0b10 [42], PAUP*4.0b10. Sinauer Associates Inc., Massachusetts). For amino acid sequences, the mixed model
available in Mr. Bayes, which assigns equal prior probabil-

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:158

ity to 10 different models of amino acid substitution, was
used as the underlying model of evolution. Analyses were
run with the following parameters: number of generations
= 1,000,000; sampling frequency = 10 generations;
number of chains = 4. Posterior probability values (which
allow assessment of relative support for particular branching relationships) were computed after discarding the first
1500 generations (burn-in period) and computing a consensus of trees saved in the remaining generations. Trees
were visualized using PAUP*, with branch lengths optimized using maximum likelihood.
