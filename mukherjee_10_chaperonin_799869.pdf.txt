Chaperonin genes on the rise: new divergent
classes and intense duplication in human and
other vertebrate genomes
Krishanu Mukherjee1,2, Everly Conway de Macario3, Alberto JL Macario3*, Luciano Brocchieri1,2*

Abstract
Background: Chaperonin proteins are well known for the critical role they play in protein folding and in disease.
However, the recent identification of three diverged chaperonin paralogs associated with the human Bardet-Biedl
and McKusick-Kaufman Syndromes (BBS and MKKS, respectively) indicates that the eukaryotic chaperonin-gene
family is larger and more differentiated than previously thought. The availability of complete genome sequences
makes possible a definitive characterization of the complete set of chaperonin sequences in human and other
species.
Results: We identified fifty-four chaperonin-like sequences in the human genome and similar numbers in the
genomes of the model organisms mouse and rat. In mammal genomes we identified, besides the well-known CCT
chaperonin genes and the three genes associated with the MKKS and BBS pathological conditions, a newly-defined
class of chaperonin genes named CCT8L, represented in human by the two sequences CCT8L1 and CCT8L2.
Comparative analyses from several vertebrate genomes established the monophyletic origin of chaperonin-like
MKKS and BBS genes from the CCT8 lineage. The CCT8L gene originated from a later duplication also in the CCT8
lineage at the onset of mammal evolution and duplicated in primate genomes. The functionality of CCT8L genes
in different species was confirmed by evolutionary analyses and in human by expression data. Detailed sequence
analysis and structural predictions of MKKS, BBS and CCT8L proteins strongly suggested that they conserve a
typical chaperonin-like core structure but that they are unlikely to form a CCT-like oligomeric complex. The
characterization of many newly-discovered chaperonin pseudogenes uncovered the intense duplication activity of
eukaryotic chaperonin genes.
Conclusions: In vertebrates, chaperonin genes, driven by intense duplication processes, have diversified into
multiple classes and functionalities that extend beyond their well-known protein-folding role as part of the typical
oligomeric chaperonin complex, emphasizing previous observations on the involvement of individual CCT
monomers in microtubule elongation. The functional characterization of newly identified chaperonin genes will be
a challenge for future experimental analyses.

Background
Hsp60-like chaperonin proteins are well known for their
role in assisting protein folding and in protecting cells
from the deleterious effects of stress [1-5]. The eukaryotic cell expresses representatives of two distinct groups
of chaperonin genes that are otherwise typical of

bacteria (Group I) or archaea (Group II). In eukaryotes,
Group I chaperonins are mostly expressed in mitochondria and chloroplasts, and Group II chaperonins are
found in the eukaryotic cytosol [1,6-10]. Chaperonin
proteins form typical multi-subunit double-ringed structures collectively called “chaperonins” [9-13]. The Group
I chaperonins are typically formed by the products of a
single gene (groEL in bacteria; hsp60/cpn60 in mitochondria) assembled into a 14-subunit double-ringed
structure in bacteria and into a double or single-ringed
structure in mitochondria [14]. Eukaryotic Group II

chaperonin proteins assemble in a similar double-ringed
oligomeric structure, called TRiC or CCT complex [15],
composed of 16 subunits that in human are encoded by
nine distinct genes (tcp1/cct1, cct2-5, cct6A-B, cct7-8)
[8-10]. The CCT complex is mostly known for its role
in folding the cytoskeleton proteins actin and tubulin
[7,16] and mutations in individual CCT subunits lead to
defects in the functioning of the cytoskeleton and mitosis arrest [17].
As for other chaperones, the malfunctioning of chaperonin proteins has been associated with various
human pathological conditions, the chaperonopathies
[18-20]. In this respect, besides the canonical cct and
cpn60 genes described above, three divergent hsp60-like
genes have been more recently identified [21-23] in
association with pathological conditions. One gene,
MKKS [21], was named for its association with the
developmental disease McKusick-Kaufman Syndrome
and was soon after also identified as BBS6 [24] for its
association with the Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS),
another developmental condition involving ciliumrelated dysfunction [25]. More recently two other
hsp60-like BBS genes, named BBS10 [22] and BBS12
[23], have been identified among fourteen genes (BBS1
to BBS14) so far associated with BBS. The protein products of MKKS/BBS6, BBS10 and BBS12 localize to the
basal body of cilia and to the centrosome [26-28]. We
will hereafter refer to the MKKS/BBS6 gene as MKKS,
and collectively to the three hsp60-like BBS genes as the
“BBS genes”. The identification of these genes provides
new perspectives on the spectrum of functionalities of
Hsp60-like proteins in eukaryotes and on their role in
development.
The recognition of chaperonopathies has increased the
importance of elucidating the entire set of chaperone
genes present in the human genome [19]. The work
reported here was conceived to: a) identify all Hsp60like sequences encoded in the human and other genomes including all diverged chaperonin genes; b) reconstruct the evolutionary origins and relations of diverged
chaperonin genes; c) distinguish with bioinformatics
methods functional genes from pseudogenes; d) characterize structural properties of the corresponding proteins. We mostly devoted our attention to the
characterization of the evolutionary history and structural properties of newly or recently identified
sequences, referring the reader to the vast amount of
published literature for information on functional/structural properties and the evolutionary history of mitochondrial Cpn60 or CCT-complex proteins.
Exhaustive searches of hsp60-like sequences were carried out in human and other genomes following and
extending our “chaperonomics” methodological protocol
[29]. The extensive analysis of the genomes of human

Page 2 of 19

and other vertebrate species lead to the identification
and characterization of many previously unknown
sequences and to the discovery of a new, mammal-specific class of chaperonin proteins. Classification, evolutionary analysis and structural characterization of
diverged chaperonin-like sequences should provide valuable information for future studies on the functional
roles of these proteins.

Results
Chaperonin sequences in the human genome

To identify all human hsp60-like sequences we queried
the human genome using the nine human CCT subunit
and mitochondrial Cpn60 sequences. Analogous extensive searches were performed in the mouse and rat genomes using corresponding queries. In the human
genome, we found a total of 54 sequences with significant similarity to Hsp60 proteins (Tables 1 and 2). Fifteen sequences had a NCBI Entrez [30] gene descriptor
assigned. Nine of these corresponded to the canonical
CCT-subunit sequences and one, HSPD1, encoded the
mitochondrial Cpn60 protein. Three sequences corresponded to the BBS genes MKKS, BBS10 and BBS12.
We recovered two additional uncharacterized sequences
designated in the NCBI Entrez Gene database as
CCT8L1 and CCT8L2. Besides these complete Hsp60like sequences, a sequence domain conserved across
eukaryote species with highest similarity to the apical
domain of the CCT3 protein has also been reported in
PIKFYVE [31], a kinase belonging to the Fab1p protein
family involved in corneal pathological conditions [32].
In addition, we identified 39 other human hsp60
sequences that did not correspond to a gene descriptor
in the NCBI Entrez Gene database (Table 2). All of
these sequences contained in-frame stop codons or
frame-shifts, suggesting that they were most likely pseudogenes. Thirty-five of these had not been described in
the Pseudogene.org pseudogene database [33] and 33
were not listed in the Ensembl database [34], and are
here annotated and classified for the first time. In analogous searches of the complete genomes of mouse and
rat, we identified in each genome 14 chaperonin genes
(nine for the canonical CCT monomers, one for the
mitochondrial Cpn60, three BBS genes and one CCT8L
gene), 38 pseudogenes in mouse and 61 pseudogenes in
rat (see additional file 1: Table S1, for mouse sequences,
and additional file 2: Table S2, for rat sequences).
Evolutionary origins of human BBS and CCT8L genes

A maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree of
human chaperonin-like proteins (Figure 1a) indicated
that Hsp60-like BBS proteins are monophyletic (bootstrap support 86%) and that their common ancestor
derived from a duplication event in the CCT8 lineage

(bootstrap support 88%). The tree also showed that the
unique ancestor of the two closely related genes
CCT8L1 and CCT8L2 also originated in the CCT8 lineage from a more recent duplication event (bootstrap
support 75%). The relation of BBS and CCT8L proteins
with the CCT8 chaperonin subunit was confirmed with
strong conditional probability support (0.99) by Bayesian
tree construction (Figure 1b).
Although the association of BBS and CCT8L proteins
with the CCT lineage was robustly supported, the high
divergence of these sequences could produce clustering
in the trees due to long-branch attraction. To address
this concern, we built independent ML trees for each
BBS or CCT8L sequence adding them separately to the
tree of CCT subunits. All individual trees confirmed
with strong bootstrap support the association of each
BBS or CCT8L lineage with the CCT8 lineage (see additional file 3: Figure S1, additional file 4: Figure S2, additional file 5: Figure S3 and additional file 6: Figure S4).
A ML evolutionary tree including hsp60-gene homologs
found in the genomes of eighteen other vertebrate species, including representatives of several mammals,
chicken, frogs, and fish, also confirmed the origin of
BBS and CCT8L genes from the CCT8 lineage (see
additional file 7: Figure S5).
We did not find CCT8L genes in the genomes of
chicken, Xenopus laevis, or Danio rerio, representatives
respectively of the reptile/bird, amphibian and fish
lineages. However, among mammals we identified

orthologs of CCT8L genes in genomes not only of placental mammals (Eutheria), but also of the marsupial opossum (Metatheria) and of the egg-laying platypus
(Prototheria), suggesting that the CCT8L gene class originated at the onset of mammal evolution. All CCT8L gene
orthologs were intron-less, indicating that their ancestor
originated from a retro-transposition event. Two copies of
CCT8L sequences were found in human and chimp and
one CCT8L gene in all other genomes examined, including those from the other primate rhesus monkey (Macaca
mulatta) and gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus)
(Figure 2), suggesting that a duplication of the CCT8L
gene occurred in Hominoidea after their separation from
old world monkeys. However, the lone gene copy of
CCT8L identified in rhesus monkey clustered with
CCT8L1 in evolutionary trees (Figure 2), suggesting an
earlier duplication of the gene and successive loss of the
CCT8L2 copy from the genome of rhesus monkey. Close
inspection of protein alignments revealed that the rhesus
monkey CCT8L sequence included an anomalously
diverged segment of about 50 amino acids of uncertain
alignment. Excluding this segment from the analysis we
obtained a different and more robustly supported tree
topology (75% vs. 20% bootstrap value, see additional file
8: Figure S6, panels a and b), consistent with a later duplication of the CCT8L gene in Hominoidea. The tree also
indicated that the removed segment was alone responsible
for the overall higher evolutionary rate predicted for this
sequence (see additional file 8: Figure S6).

monomers, MKKS, BBS10, BBS12 and the two members, CCT8L1 and CCT8L2, of the newly defined CCT8L class. Numbers associated with each
branch indicate bootstrap support from 100 replicates. Tree rooted by the archaeal thermosome alpha subunit of Sulfolobus solfataricus
(Ss_ThsA). (b) Bayesian evolutionary tree of the same sequences shown in (a). The numbers assigned to each branch indicate posterior
probabilities. Tree rooted by the thermosome alpha subunit of Thermoplasma acidophilum (Ta_ThsA). The scale bars represent the indicated
number of substitutions per position for a unit branch length.

Differentiation rate of BBS and CCT8L proteins

The branch lengths of the trees shown in Figure 1 indicate that BBS and CCT8L proteins have differentiated at
much higher rates than CCT subunits. We applied a
newly-developed, unbiased measure of differentiation
called “B-index” (see Methods) to calculate differentiation of MKKS, BBS10 and BBS12 proteins from their
respective last ancestor common to Actinopterygii (rayfinned fishes) and Sarcopterygii (including tetrapods),
determined by rooting the trees with CCT8 proteins
from corresponding fish and tetrapod species. Similarly,
we calculated differentiation of CCT8L proteins from a
eutherial ancestor rooting their tree with corresponding
sets of CCT8 proteins (see footnotes of Table 3 and
legend for Figure 2 for species represented in each tree).
We estimated for the MKKS family an average evolutionary distance from their root of almost 0.7 substitutions per site, corresponding to a 6-fold higher rate of
differentiation compared to the number of substitutions
estimated in CCT8 proteins over the same period of
time. For BBS10 and BBS12, we calculated a distance of

about 1.0-1.2 substitutions per site, corresponding to a
substitution rate about 8-10 times higher than in CCT8.
Finally, for the mammal-specific family of CCT8L proteins, we estimated an evolutionary distance from their
mammal root of about 0.3 substitutions per site. The
smaller divergence of CCT8L proteins compared to BBS
proteins reflects the more recent origin of the CCT8L
gene. However, when scaled to the evolution of CCT8
sequences over the same periods of time, the substitution rate of CCT8L proteins was about 14-15 times
higher than in CCT8 and 1.4-2.3 times higher than in
BBS proteins.
Functional constraints in the evolution of CCT8L genes

We tested functionality of CCT8L genes from several
species estimating ratios of non-synonymous and synonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks) along their respective
lineages (see Methods). The results of this analysis are
shown in Table 4, which indicates the gene(s) analyzed
(foreground), the two genes used to identify foreground
and background branches, the estimated Ka/Ks values

families of paralogs. This topology is in agreement with
the evolutionary tree of CCT8L genes (Figure 2) with the
only exception of the weakly supported position of the
CCT8L sequence from rhesus monkey (see above). The
highly significant constraints in non-synonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks < 1.0) estimated in the overall evolution
of the CCT8L family (Table 4, foreground genes: “All
CCT8L1/2”) indicated that the CCT8L sequences are
genes generally expressing functional proteins. In evaluating Ka/Ks ratios for individual CCT8L gene lineages
(Table 4), significantly constrained evolution (Ka/Ks < 1.0)
was detected for branches leading to most sequences,
including those of murids, lemur, cow, dog, elephant, marsupial, and to the human CCT8L1 and CCT8L2 group

also estimated for the CCT8L genes of armadillo and rhesus monkey, and for human CCT8L1 and human and

CCT8L2 genes, the lack of significance can be related to
the loss of power of the test since few mutations accumulated after separation of these sequences (see additional
file 9: Table S3). In the case of rhesus monkey CCT8L, we
found that its relatively high estimate of Ka/Ks (= 0.73)
was due to the previously mentioned 50-amino-acid
diverged region within this sequence. After removing this
region we estimated Ka/Ks = 0.55. Only for the lineage of
chimp CCT8L1 we estimated Ka/Ks ≅ 1, consistent with
differentiation of a non-functional sequence. Since this
sequence was also characterized by an internal stop codon
and a frame-shift, all evidence strongly suggests that
chimp CCT8L1 is a pseudogene.
To assess the functionality of human CCT8L sequences
we investigated their expression profiles in comparison to
those of human CCT monomers and BBS genes (see additional file 10: Table S4). Expression of CCT8L2 was confirmed by fifteen ESTs mostly identified from the testis,
whereas only one EST identified as a CCT8L1 transcript
has been so far reported (NCBI UniGene database,
November 20, 2009). Querying the NCBI GEO microarray
database, we found 542 expression-profile records identifying expression of CCT8L2, and none identifying expression of CCT8L1 (as of November 20, 2009). It must be
noted, however, that CCT8L2 and CCT8L1 have similarity
of 97.3% at the DNA level. Similarly to CCT8L2, another
mammal-specific chaperonin gene, CCT6B, is also
expressed almost exclusively in the testis, from which 160
ESTs have been reported versus an average of 4.4 ESTs
(from 0 to 10 per tissue) found in all other tissues.
Pseudogenes

We identified in the human genome 39 sequences with
significant similarity to CCT or HSPD1 genes that either
were short fragments or were characterized by in-frame
stop codons or frame-shifts. Based on their corruption,
we classified these sequences as pseudogenes (Table 2).
Similarly, searching the mouse and rat genomes we
identified 38 and 61 pseudogenes, respectively (see additional file 1: Table S1 and additional file 2: Table S2).
Most of these sequences have not been previously
reported and are here systematically annotated and classified for the first time.
Based on phylogenetic-tree reconstructions (see additional file 11: Figure S7) or on similarity for the most corrupted sequences, we identified the association of 17
pseudogenes from human, 16 from mouse and 29 from
rat with one of the nine CCT genes. None of the pseudogenes were related to MKKS, BBS10, BBS12 or CCT8L.
To estimate the time of origin of the pseudogenes, we
constructed trees using their translated sequences and
chaperonin subunits from various vertebrate species (see
additional file 12: Figures S8, and additional file 13: Figure S9). The trees indicated that all recognizable human

Page 8 of 19

CCT pseudogenes originated in the mammal lineage after
separation from the reptile/bird lineage.
Of particular interest were the evolutionary relations
of CCT6 genes and pseudogenes. Two CCT6 gene
copies (CCT6A and CCT6B) were found, besides placental mammals, also in platypus and in opossum (see
additional file 11: Figure S7), suggesting that the duplication of the CCT6 gene occurred in mammal evolution
before separation of Theria (marsupial and placental
mammals) and Prototheria (monotremes). We constructed an evolutionary tree of mammal CCT6 genes
and pseudogenes (Figure 4) rooted by the corresponding
gene sequences from chicken and frog (the diverged
sequence Oa_con2651 from platypus was excluded from
this tree to avoid long-branch attraction). Surprisingly,
all recognizable human, mouse, and rat pseudogenes
belonging to the CCT6 class branched in the tree from
the CCT6A lineage after separation of the platypus,
marsupial and placental mammal lineages.
Twenty-two pseudogenes in human (Table 2), and 22
and 32 pseudogenes in mouse and rat, respectively (see
additional file 1: Table S1 and additional file 2: Table
S2), associated with the mitochondrial HSPD1 gene
(Group I cpn60). Evolutionary trees incorporating all
pseudogenes from different vertebrate species were
uninformative due to the presence among the pseudogenes of highly corrupted sequences, resulting in extensive long-branch attraction (not shown). An ML tree
built using only translations of the most conserved pseudogenes (Figure 5) showed weakly supported but consistent association of the human pseudogenes with HSPD1
from primates, whereas pseudogenes from mouse and
rat all associated with murid Hspd1 sequences, also
indicating their relatively recent origin.
Ka/Ks ratio in the evolution of putative pseudogene
sequences

Our characterization of many hsp60 sequences as pseudogenes was based on the presence of signs of corruption in the sequence (in-frame stop codons and frameshifts). However, in-frame stop codons and frame-shifts
may correspond to truncated proteins that are still functional. For example, although human HSPD1-5P and
HSPD1-6P sequences contain signs of sequence corruption, EST data indicate that these sequences are
expressed and possibly functional (see additional file 14:
Table S5). To confirm our characterization, we estimated Ka/Ks ratios in trees that identified the pseudogene-sequence lineage (branch) including as out-group
its parental gene and the orthologous gene sequence
from chicken (see Methods). The results of these analyses (Table 2) showed in most cases Ka/Ks values not
significantly different from 1.0, as expected in the differentiation of pseudogene sequences not constrained by

in mutation rate were estimated in the case of four
sequences. These sequences, however, contained multiple in-frame stop codons and frame-shifts (Table 2).
Structural features of BBS and CCT8L proteins

Because of their high sequence divergence, it is unclear
whether BBS and CCT8L Hsp60-like proteins conserve

the typical fold of chaperonin subunits and their ability
to assemble into typical oligomeric chaperonin complexes. Chaperonin monomers are characterized by
three structural domains (apical, intermediate and equatorial) with distinct functional roles and it was relevant
to investigate whether BBS and CCT8L proteins conserve each of the domains typical of chaperonins.

chaperonins are not available but their structural properties can be inferred by comparison with their closest
relative, the archaeal thermosome. To infer tertiarystructure conservation in BBS and CCT8L proteins we
predicted the secondary structure for each family from

and sequence information from other families. The

description of ThsA is shown (line “1a6d“) in relation to
the position of the equatorial, intermediate, and apical
domains. The position of these elements in the tertiary
structure of ThsA is represented in Figure 6b. Results of
a blind test of the performance of the method on the
corresponding ThsA sequence are also shown (Figure
6a, line “Ta_ThsA”). In this test most strand and helix
elements (all “core” helices) described in the crystal
structure were correctly predicted by the method,
increasing our confidence in the reliability of other predictions. As expected, extensive conservation of predicted secondary-structure elements were also obtained
from the alignment of human CCT sequences (Figure
6a, line “CCT”) with only few discrepancies involving
mostly short beta strands (4, 5, 18, and 21) and one
short helix (P) exposed at the external surface of the
archaeal thermosome complex. Secondary-structure predictions for mammal CCT8L and for vertebrate MKKS,
BBS10 or BBS12 sequences were also largely consistent
with the secondary-structure description of thermosome
proteins. In the equatorial domain, CCT8L and BBS
structure predictions corresponded to the mostly alphahelical composition of this region. Variations were more
obvious in BBS12 and involved mostly terminal elements of helices (most notably helices P and Q) and
exposed beta-strands (strands 19-21). In the intermediate domain the core helical-bundle elements (helices F,
G, and K) as well as the extensive beta-sheet composition of this region were predicted in all BBS and CCT8L
proteins. Exceptions were, in all sequences, the two
short strands 5 and 6, which are part of an external
elongated loop in the thermosome structure, and, in
BBS12, the N-terminal part of helix K, which in the
thermosome protrudes towards the central cavity covering the ATP hydrolysis site (Figure 6b). The apical
domain is formed in the thermosome by a 4-strand
anti-parallel beta-sheet (strands 9, 10, 15, and 16) with
strand 10 extending into a second parallel beta-sheet
(strands 10, 12, 13, and 14). The two sheets are flanked
by a helix (J) and are surmounted by a structure composed of two contacting helices (H and I) and an
extended loop including strand 11. All helices and most
strands of the apical domain were recognized in BBS
sequences. Most obvious differences were observed in
BBS12 proteins, where the long apical helix H was predicted to be shortened, and in CCT8L, where helix I
and strand 11 were not predicted.
Differentiation of monomer-monomer interaction regions
in BBS and CCT8L proteins

To investigate the potential of CCT8L and BBS proteins to
establish intra-ring and inter-ring monomer-monomer
contacts, we investigated the relative conservation of predicted contact positions in CCT, BBS and CCT8L

Page 12 of 19

sequences. We identified potential contact positions in
these families based on homology to the positions involved
in inter-monomer contacts in the crystal structure of the
T. acidophilum thermosome complex (PDB code 1a6d).
After identifying all contact positions in CCT monomers,
we distinguished among them those that conserved similar
amino acid types across the nine monomers. We counted
how many amino acid types observed in all or in conserved contact positions of CCT monomers were also
observed in the T. acidophilum Thsa sequence, in human
CCT8Ls or in human BBS sequences (Table 5). A complete list of all and conserved positions considered and of
the residue types observed in these positions in all
sequences can be found in additional file 21: Table S6.
Thsa and CCT subunits conserve 89% similarity in monomer-monomer contact positions, which is substantially
higher than the average similarity (62%-66%) of all homologous positions between the two families. The higher
similarity of monomer-monomer contact regions is consistent with functional conservation between the two
families of these positions. In contrast, the high rate of differentiation in comparison to global average differentiation
shown in putative monomer-monomer contact positions
in BBS or CCT8L sequences (Table 5), suggests a loss of
capability to associate into a typical CCT-like oligomeric
complex. This result is consistent with the presence in

Conservation of archaeal ThsA and human BBS and CCT8L sequences relative
to human CCT monomers. Sequence-positions are considered conserved if
they are occupied by residue-types appearing in the homologous position in
any of the human CCT sequences. Ninety-three intra-ring contact positions
and 15 inter-ring contact positions were identified from the thermosome
structure (1ad6). Contact positions were defined by a distance of their sidechain heavy atoms of at most 4.0Å from any heavy atom of the nearby
monomer in the thermosome structure. For each protein family, the table
indicates the number and percentage (in parenthesis) of positions conserved
among: all 93 intra-ring contact positions (MM); seventeen intra-ring contactpositions conserved among human CCT monomers (CMM); all 15 inter-ring
contact positions, none of which were conserved among CCT monomers (RR).

Conservation of substrate-binding positions

Three positions crucial in determining substrate-specificity of CCT monomers have been identified in the distal
region of helix I in the apical domain [37]. We analyzed
conservation at these positions across vertebrate species
in all Group II chaperonin families and in the
Fab1_TCP domain across vertebrate orthologs of the
PIKFYVE protein kinase (Table 6). These positions are
strikingly conserved within each CCT monomer type
(with the exception of CCT6B) across species and are
characteristically different between monomer types.
They are mostly conserved also in the Fab1_TCP
domain across vertebrate sequences. In contrast, in BBS
and, particularly, in CCT8L sequences, the homologous
positions are significantly more differentiated.

Discussion
We identified the full complement of chaperonin hsp60
genes and pseudogenes encoded in the human genome
and, for comparison, in the genomes of the model
organisms mouse and rat. We delimited the set of hsp60
genes encoded in the human genome to: a) nine canonical cct genes (CCT1 to CCT8 including CCT6A and
CCT6B) involved in formation of the CCT complex; b)
the cpn60 gene (HSPD1) of mitochondrial origin; c) the
three highly diverged hsp60-like BBS genes MKKS,
BBS10 and BBS12; and d) a newly characterized class of
genes, CCT8L, represented in human by CCT8L1 and
CCT8L2. We also identified a plethora of pseudogene
sequences, many of which had not been previously

Although there is considerable variation among BBS and
CCT8L sequences at some of the ATP-binding positions, we observed complete conservation of the crucial
ATP-binding dipeptide Gly-Pro, suggesting that these
otherwise divergent proteins conserve ATP-binding ability. In the ATP-hydrolysis sites, substantial loss of conservation has been reported in MKKS [27] and in BBS12
[23]. In the CCT8L, MKKS and BBS10 families, unusual
substitutions are observed in phosphate-binding positions and within the catalytic triad, where only Asp is
conserved in MKKS. The effect that these mutations
may have on the hydrolytic activity in these protein
families is unclear. The high level of differentiation of
this region in BBS12 (where the ATP-hydrolysis motif is
not recognizable) strongly suggests that BBS12 has lost
hydrolytic activity.

reported. The comparative analyses of these families of
functional genes and of their pseudogenes revealed their
evolutionary history and relationships.
In contrast to the uncertainty of the duplication pattern of canonical CCT subunits (our results and [38,39])
the origin of Hsp60-like BBS and CCT8L proteins was
unambiguously identified by phylogenetic tree reconstructions. Our analyses indicated that hsp60-like BBS
genes originated monophyletically from a gene duplication event in the CCT8 gene lineage. In addition, we
determined that the CCT8L family also originated in the
CCT8 lineage, from a more recent retrotransposition
event. The presence of this gene family in placental
mammals, marsupials and monotremes but not in reptiles/birds or other vertebrate species, indicates that this
family originated at the onset of mammal evolution,
before divergence of Theria and Prototheria. Presence
of two highly similar CCT8L genes (CCT8L1 and
CCT8L2) in the genomes of human and chimp and of a
single copy in other mammal genomes, including rhesus
monkey, suggests that the duplication of this gene
occurred in the ape lineage (Hominoidea) after its divergence from the old-world monkeys (Cercopithecidae).
Multiple evidence gathered in this work indicates that
CCT8L sequences (and at least one of the two paralogs
in Hominoidea) encode for functional genes: (i) reduced
rates of non-synonymous mutation were estimated
along their lineages, as expected for functionally-constrained protein-coding genes; (ii) pseudogenes as
ancient or more recent than the CCT8L genes were
heavily degenerated and no pseudogenes pre-dating
mammal evolution could be identified. In contrast,
although CCT8L sequences originated early in mammal
evolution, they did not show signs of degeneration (with
the exception of the chimp CCT8L1 ortholog); (iii) multiple EST and microarray data have been collected for
CCT8L2, mostly from testis, and one EST for CCT8L1
has been reported from placental tissue (as per the UniGene EST and GEO expression data, November 23,
2009). These features taken together are strong evidence
that at least CCT8L2 in Hominoidea and the lone
CCT8L gene in other mammal lineages encode for functional proteins. The sparse expression of CCT8L1 in
human and the presence of one in-frame stop codon
and one frame-shift in its orthologous sequence from
chimp raise doubts about the functionality of this
sequence.
Numerous sequences associated with cct or cpn60
genes found in the human, mouse or rat genomes were
classified as pseudogenes based on the presence of internal stop codons, frame-shifts and non-significant difference in synonymous and non-synonymous mutation
rates. Among them, the sequences HSPD1-5P and
HSPD1-6P appear to be expressed based on EST

Page 14 of 19

analysis (see additional file 14: Table S5) and may represent instances of expressed pseudogenes [40]. A general
explosion of pseudogene generation in the human and
murid lineages after they separated from the carnivore
lineage has been reported [41]. Our analysis of chaperonin pseudogenes is consistent with this observation,
although their relatively high rate of degeneration suggests that pseudogenes generated before the origin of
mammals may have degraded beyond recognition. The
intense duplication of chaperonin sequences witnessed
by the many pseudogenes identified in the human and
murid genomes, very likely provided opportunities for
multiple paralogy, resulting in the proliferation of chaperonin classes in the vertebrate and mammal lineages.
Although the Hsp60-like BBS and CCT8L protein
families have considerably differentiated from the canonical CCT subunits and within themselves, our analyses
indicated that they still conserve the overall threedomain structure typical of CCT proteins. Structure and
sequence variations predicted for their apical domains
may reflect distinctive substrate specificities. In particular, lack of conservation at positions crucial in providing
substrate-specificity to CCT monomers [37] suggests
that BBS and CCT8L proteins may interact with their
substrate(s) in different regions as compared with the
canonical CCT subunits. Sequence differentiation patterns and acquisition of inserted elements in correspondence to potential monomer-monomer contact regions
suggested that BBS and CCT8L proteins do not assemble in a CCT-like complex. This prediction is supported
by experimental evidence showing that MKKS localizes
as a free monomer at the pericentriolar material of centrosomes [27]. In this respect, it is also interesting to
observe that among BBS and CCT8L sequences the
ATP-hydrolysis motif “Gly-Asp-Gly-Thr”, remarkably
conserved among canonical chaperonins [42], has differentiated in MKKS and in BBS12 [23,27]. This condition
may indicate that these families have lost the hydrolytic
activity necessary for the functionality of the chaperonin
complex [43-52]. It has been shown for the archaeal
thermosome complex that mutation of the ATP-hydrolysis-motif Asp residue prevents hydrolysis and productive protein folding [49] and that some CCT subunits,
among which CCT8, dissociate in vitro from the complex in conditions that prevent hydrolysis of ATP [53].
Functionalities independent from formation of the
complex have also been reported for canonical CCT
subunits. TCP1 monomers not in complex confer
enhanced salt tolerance in plants [54]. Individual CCT
subunits have been reported to associate in vitro with
cytoskeleton structures, selectively binding to microtubule filaments [55] or to actin polymerizing filaments
[56]. The localization of Hsp60-like BBS proteins at the
cilium basal body and at the centrosome [26-28]

Mukherjee et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:64
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/64

suggests that they may also interact and associate with,
for example, cytoskeleton structures in promoting the
correct development of cilia [28,57]. The multiple structural and experimental evidence that BBS and CCT8L
proteins do not form a canonical CCT-like complex
provides strong indication that eukaryotic Group II chaperonin-protein functionalities extend beyond those of
the typical oligomeric complex.

Conclusions
Chaperonin proteins are key players in ensuring and
preserving cell and organism functionality under normal
and stressful conditions and their biological and medical
importance is undeniable. The recent discovery of hsp60
genes directly implicated in specific pathological conditions, the chaperonopathies, extends our understanding
of the roles of chaperonin proteins in cellular processes
and enhances awareness of their importance in pathology [18-20]. Here, we have provided a comprehensive,
unifying framework encompassing all members of the
extended hsp60 family of genes and pseudogenes. This
unifying framework contributes to our understanding of
the evolutionary history of the extended hsp60 family
and widens our perspectives on the multiple roles that
chaperonin proteins have acquired in vertebrates. Our
findings highlight how differentiation of the chaperonin
protein family in mammals has been facilitated by
intense processes of gene duplication. The roles,
mechanisms of action, and involvement in pathogenesis
of individual chaperonin molecules beyond those typical
of their canonical oligomeric complexes constitute
aspects of chaperonin physiology particularly promising
for future experimental testing.
Methods
Identification of chaperonin genes in eukaryotic genomes

Searches of genes for Hsp60-like proteins were exhaustively performed using TBLASTN [58] at Ensembl [34]
and BLAT [59] at UCSC [60] on the genome sequences
of human (NCBI Assembly 36, Genebuild Ensembl Dec
2006), mouse (NCBI Assembly m37, Genebuild Ensembl
Apr 2007) and rat (Assembly RGSC 3.4, Genebuild
Ensembl Feb 2006). We used the nine canonical human
CCT proteins and the Cpn60 protein (mitochondrial
Hsp60) as queries. We recursively queried the genomes
with the sequences recovered from previous searches
until no other Hsp60 sequences were detected. We used
both search engines also to recover the full list of annotated hsp60-like genes in several other mammal genomes and in chicken. Sequences from frog (Xenopus sp.)
were retrieved from the NCBI nr (non-redundant) database using PSI-BLAST [61] with Cpn60 and the individual CCT subunits as queries. To recover complete
hsp60 gene and pseudogene sequences, after the

Page 15 of 19

TBLASTN searches the genomic sequences from
approximately 2,000 nt upstream to 2,000 nt downstream of the hit-regions were excised and the hsp60
sequences were extracted using the homology-based
gene prediction method implemented in FGENESH+
[62] at the Softberry web site [63]. For pseudogenes,
when FGENESH+ failed to recognize the complete
sequence due to in-frame stop codons or frame shifts in
the sequence, the coding region was manually reconstructed, aligning the three-frame-translations of the
genomic sequence to the query sequence with the multiple protein alignment program ITERALIGN [64]. The
Pseudogene.org [33,65] database and Ensembl [34],
Entrez [30] and HUGO [66] annotations were consulted
for the presence of annotated human pseudogenes, as
recorded in our tables of results.
Multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure
prediction

Multiple sequence alignments were obtained using
MUSCLE [67], which in previous analyses [68,69] performed well when aligning divergent sequences. Alignments were manually adjusted as needed. Predictions of
secondary structure for each protein family were performed from their multiple alignment using the Jnet
algorithm as implemented in the JPRED-3 secondary
structure prediction server [70,71].
Evolutionary tree reconstructions

To infer phylogenetic relationships, evolutionary trees
were obtained using the maximum-likelihood (ML) treebuilding procedure implemented in PHYML [72] using
the default JTT substitution model and 100 bootstrap
resampling replicates (each ML tree reconstruction
being quite time consuming). Selected trees were compared with those obtained with the Bayesian approach
implemented in MrBayes 3.1 [73] using the WAG substitution model and 10,000 iterations for the MCMC
process. Conditional probabilities were estimated sampling the MCMC process every 10 iterations after 2,500
burn-in iterations (sample size 750).
Estimates of evolutionary divergence of sequence families

We obtained rates of divergence among families of
sequences using a newly developed estimator, called “Bindex”. The B-index is an unbiased estimator of the
average divergence of a family of sequences from its last
common ancestor (root) that takes into consideration
the correlations among sequences determined by their
phylogenetic tree. Briefly, given a rooted tree, a terminal
branch of length di of the original tree is considered a
“cluster” of size w i = 1 and length d = d i . Each forkstructure comprising two terminal branches (clusters) of
lengths d1 and d2 and sizes w1 and w2 bifurcating from

Mukherjee et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:64
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/64

a stem-branch of length ds is considered in turn. The
average length d of each fork-structure is computed as
d = (d1 + d2)/2 + ds and the average size w of the structure is defined as w = [2(d1 + d2)/2 + 1ds]/[(d1 + d2)/2
+ ds] = (d1 + d2 + ds)/d. Each fork-structure is progressively replaced by a corresponding cluster of length d
and size w. The procedure is repeated merging bifurcating clusters of lengths d1 and d2 and sizes w1 and w 2
connected to a stem-branch of length ds into a larger
cluster of average length d = (w1d1 + w2d2)/(w1 + w2) +
ds and average size w = (d1w1 + d2w2 + ds)/d, until the
tree is reduced to two clusters connected to the root (ds
= 0). The global average differentiation D ("B-index”)
and size W can finally be computed as D = (w 1 d 1 +
w2d2)/(w1 + w2) and W = w1 + w2. It can be shown that
DW = L is the length of the tree (sum of all branch
lengths). If two sequence families A and B are sampled
from the same set of species and WA = WB, then DB/DA
= L B/L A and the relative rate of differentiation of the
two families of sequences can be estimated by the ratio
of their tree lengths. The B-index has several advantages
compared to the most commonly used average pair-wise
sequence-similarity measure: (i) it takes into account the
correlation among sequences imposed by the topology
of the evolutionary tree; (ii) in contrast to average pairwise similarity, its expectations are invariant over the
number and phylogenetic relations of sequences
sampled from a cluster with the same common ancestor
and evolutionary model; and (iii) with the B-index, the
average differentiation rate of a protein family relative to
a reference family sharing the same evolutionary relations (e.g., sampled from the same set of species) is simply estimated by the ratio of the lengths of the
evolutionary trees of the two families.
Estimates of ratios of non-synonymous vs. synonymous
mutation rate (Ka/Ks)

Classification of hsp60 sequences as functional genes or
pseudogenes was supported by the absence or presence
of in-frame stop codons and frame-shifts, and by estimating non-synonymous vs. synonymous mutation-rate
ratios (Ka/Ks) along relevant branches of evolutionary
trees. Estimates were obtained using the maximum-likelihood branch-specific model implemented in PAML4
[74]. In the case of pseudogenes, Ka/Ks values are
expected not to significantly differ from 1 (absence of
positive or negative selection at the protein level)
whereas protein-coding genes, whose evolution is dominated by negative or positive selection, are expected to
be characterized, respectively, by Ka/Ks < 1 or Ka/Ks >
1. Briefly, we applied the PAML4 “branch-specific
model” creating an evolutionary tree including the
sequences whose evolutionary lineage was tested, the

Page 16 of 19

appropriate sister sequence (in the case of pseudogenes,
the gene sequence from whose lineage the pseudogene
originated) and an out-group sequence. The tree branch
(es) to be tested are designated as “foreground” and
other branches as “background.” Using the branch-specific model the Ka/Ks ratio is estimated for the foreground branch(es) and an analogous ratio is estimated
for the background branches. The likelihood L1 generated using this evolutionary model is compared to the
likelihood L 0 of a null model where Ka/Ks for foreground branches is fixed to 1.0. In the Log-likelihood
Ratio Test (LRT) the significance of the likelihood differences between the model with free estimate of Ka/Ks
and the null model is estimated by the quantity 2•ln(L1/
L0), which approximates a c2 distribution.
