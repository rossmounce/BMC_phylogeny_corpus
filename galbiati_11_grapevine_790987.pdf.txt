Abstract
Background: Under drought, plants accumulate the signaling hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which induces the
rapid closure of stomatal pores to prevent water loss. This event is trigged by a series of signals produced inside
guard cells which finally reduce their turgor. Many of these events are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level,
including the control exerted by MYB proteins. In a previous study, while identifying the grapevine R2R3 MYB
family, two closely related genes, VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 were found with high similarity to AtMYB60, an
Arabidopsis guard cell-related drought responsive gene.
Results: Promoter-GUS transcriptional fusion assays showed that expression of VvMYB60 was restricted to stomatal
guard cells and was attenuated in response to ABA. Unlike VvMYB30, VvMYB60 was able to complement the loss-offunction atmyb60-1 mutant, indicating that VvMYB60 is the only true ortholog of AtMYB60 in the grape genome. In
addition, VvMYB60 was differentially regulated during development of grape organs and in response to ABA and
drought-related stress conditions.
Conclusions: These results show that VvMYB60 modulates physiological responses in guard cells, leading to the
possibility of engineering stomatal conductance in grapevine, reducing water loss and helping this species to
tolerate drought under extreme climatic conditions.

Background
Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a fruit crop traditionally
subjected to moderate or severe water stress, as this is an
efficient strategy to improve fruit and wine quality
(reviewed in [1,2]). Vitis species adapt well to drought conditions due to good osmotic adjustment, large and deep
root systems, efficient control of stomatal aperture and
xylem embolism [3,4]. The strength and timing of these
responses varies between different cultivars and major differences in water stress tolerance can be found when compared to other species or hybrids from the Vitis genus [5].
Although these genotype-related variations involve

different aspects of the physiology of the plant, they are
largely linked to differences in stomatal conductance (gs)
[6]. Stomata are microscopic pores distributed on the surface of leaves and stems, surrounded by two highly specialized guard cells. The opening and closure of the pore, in
response to internal signals and environmental cues,
allows the plant to cope with the conflicting needs of
ensuring adequate uptake of CO2 for photosynthesis and
preventing water loss by transpiration [7]. Under drought,
abscisic acid (ABA) is accumulated, inducing rapid stomatal closure to limit water loss.
Increasing evidence indicates a role for transcription factors belonging to the R2R3 MYB subfamily as key modulators of physiological responses in stomata [8,9]. In
particular, AtMYB60 has been shown to be differentially
expressed in guard cells in response to ABA, and the lossof function atmyb60-1 mutant displays constitutive

reduction of light-induced stomatal opening and enhanced
tolerance to dehydration [10]. Guard cell-specific MYB
genes are thus focal points in understanding stomatal regulation in plants and represent molecular targets to modulate guard cell activity to improve crop survival and
productivity during drought.
The grapevine genome has been estimated to contain a
total of 279 MYB genes [11], of which 108 belong to the
R2R3 subfamily [12]. A phylogenetic tree, constructed
with the complete grape, Arabidopsis and rice R2R3MYB
subfamilies, showed that many genes sharing similar
functions were clustered in the same phylogenetic
groups. Some of these clades were conserved in gene
copy number (e.g. those related to trichome development) while in those controlling flavonoid synthesis several expansions events may have occurred [12].
In this work, we report the identification of two close
homologues of the guard cell-related AtMYB60 gene in
the grape genome, namely VvMYB60 and VvMYB30.
Analysis of gene expression in grape tissues revealed that
both VvMYB60 and VvMYB30 were expressed in green
tissues and developing seeds. As opposite to VvMYB30,
VvMYB60 transcript abundance was greatly reduced by
ABA and osmotic stress. A GUS reporter gene approach
in Arabidopsis showed that activity of the VvMYB60 promoter was restricted to stomatal guard cells and was
down-regulated by ABA. Comparative analysis of regulatory regions revealed the presence of common guard
cell-specific motifs in the promoters of the grape and
Arabidopsis MYB60 genes. Finally, VvMYB60, unlike
VvMYB30, fully complemented the stomatal defects of
the atmyb60-1 mutant, thus indicating that VvMYB60 is
a functional ortholog of the Arabidopsis AtMYB60 stomatal regulator.

Results
Phylogenetic relationships of MYB60 homologues

As a first approach to identify grape homologues of the
AtMYB60 transcription factor, we searched the 108 R2R3
MYB proteins identified in the Vitis vinifera PN40024 genome [12], for the presence of a distinctive C-terminal
motif (CtM2, YaSST/AeNIA/SR/KLl), found in members of
Subgroup 1 of the Arabidopsis MYB family [13]. This subgroup includes: AtMYB60, regulating light-induced stomatal aperture [10,14]; AtMYB30, related to the regulation of
brassinosteroid-induced gene expression [15] and to the
biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids involved in
hypersensitive cell death [16]; AtMYB96, an ABA/auxin
cross-talker, mediating ABA signaling during drought
stress and involved in promoting pathogen resistance
[17,18] and AtMYB94, whose function is still unknown.
Our search yielded two grape close homologues in the
grape genome version 12x: the annotated gene models
GSVIVT01008005001 (protein accession ABK59040) and

Page 2 of 14

GSVIVT01029904001 (protein accession ACF21938).
A parsimony consensus tree was constructed to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within these grape
proteins and members of Arabidopsis R2R3 MYB
Subgroup 1. Subgroup 2 was also included as some of its
members are involved in drought responses and ABA signaling [19,20]. From this subgroup, a grape MYB14
homologue had also been previously isolated [12].
AtMYB61, regulating stomatal activity [21], but not
belonging to any of these subgroups, was included as an
out-group. As shown in Figure 1A, the two grape proteins ACF21938 and ABK59040 clustered with members
of the Arabidopsis Subgroup 1. Interestingly, AtMYB60,
the most distant member of Subgroup 1, was more
closely related to the grape protein accession ACF21938
than to the other members of the subgroup (AtMYB30,
31, 94 and 96). On the other hand, the grape accession
protein ABK59040 was closely related to AtMYB30 and
AtMYB31 and to a lesser extent to AtMYB94 and
AtMYB96 (Figure 1A). Hereafter, we will refer to
ACF21938 and ABK59040 as VvMYB60 and VvMYB30,
respectively. Based on these results, we further divided
Subgroup1 into Subgroup 1.1, (AtMYB30, AtMYB31,
AtMYB94 and AtMYB96) and Subgroup 1.2 (AtMYB60
and VvMYB60) (Figure 1A).
As expected, all the proteins included in the tree disclosed a highly conserved R2R3 DNA binding domain
(Figure 1B). The identity between the R2R3 domain of
AtMYB60 and VvMYB60 and VvMYB30 was 99%, and
90%, respectively. In addition, AtMYB60 and VvMYB60
disclosed a distinctive PHEEG signature, encompassing
the two highly conserved glutamic acid residues, located
in the loop connecting the R2 and R3 repeats (Figure 1B).
The complete protein sequence of AtMYB60 showed 51%
amino acid identity to VvMYB60, and 48% identity to
VvMYB30. All of these proteins share two C-terminal
motifs (CtM2 and CtM3) which are only found in subgroup 1. In addition, AtMYB30, 31, 96 and 94 possess a
third MYB domain (CtM1), which is absent in AtMYB60
and VvMYB60 (Figure 1B). The function of these C-terminal domains is still unknown although they might reflect
the functional differences between subgroups 1.1 and 1.2.
We determined the precise gene structure of both
VvMYB30 and VvMYB60, by comparing the complete
coding sequence with the full length cDNA sequence,
amplified from Pinot noir PN40024 genomic DNA and
leaf cDNA, respectively (Additional file 1). It was interesting to note that in the 12x version of the grape genome,
GSVIVP01008005001, representing the VvMYB60 gene
model, was misannotated in terms of exon number.
Indeed, our results indicate the presence of three exons, as
opposed to the five exons predicted by the gene model,
thus revealing a conserved exon/intron organization for
VvMYB30, VvMYB60 and AtMYB60 (Additional file 1).

Based on gene structure, MYB genes have been classified
in four different groups [12]. VvMYB30, VvMYB60 and
AtMYB60 all belong to Group I, which contains genes
with a characteristic R2 domain split between exons 1 and
2, and a R3 domain split between exons 2 and 3 (Additional file 1). The biggest differences in lengths were found
in the first intron and the third exon, which were longer in
the grape genes compared to AtMYB60.
Expression of VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 in grape tissues
and in response to hormonal and stress factors

qPCR analysis of gene expression in different grape
organs indicated that VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 transcripts were most abundant in leaves, seeds and ripened
berry skins (Figure 2A). Interestingly, VvMYB30 and
VvMYB60 revealed completely opposite expression patterns during seed development; while VvMYB60 expression was gradually down-regulated towards the onset of
ripening (veraison), VvMYB30 expression was rapidly
activated (Figure 2B). During berry skin development,
VvMYB60 expression also showed a dramatic decrease to
full repression at veraison, followed by a slight increase
towards ripening (Figure 2C). In this tissue, VvMYB30
was mostly constantly expressed throughout the green
and ripening stages (Figure 2C).
In Arabidopsis, it has been shown that the expression
of the AtMYB60 gene is rapidly down-regulated following
treatment with ABA [10]. We thus analysed the expression of the grape genes in leaves treated with 50 or
100 μM ABA (Figure 2D and 2E). As reported in Figure
2D, VvMYB60 showed a significant decrease in expression levels in both 50 and 100 μM ABA treated samples,
when compared to the mock treated leaves. Conversely,
VvMYB30 did not show any change in expression after
exposure to the hormone under these conditions (Figure
2E). To further investigate the expression of VvMYB60
and VvMYB30 in response to osmotic stresses, we
designed an in vitro long-term salt stress experiment.
Nodal explants were placed vertically on sterile MS
media supplemented with 3 (standard), 100 or 200 mM
NaCl. Explants were maintained for a month in a growth
chamber until roots and/or leaves were visible and fully
expanded. At the end of the experiment, plantlets from
the 100 mM NaCl treatment had a small radicule and
high leaf anthocyanin accumulation, as a clear sign of
stress in the plant, while plants at 200 mM showed more
severe symptoms, including systemic wilting and brown
pigmentation (Additional file 2). Under these conditions,
VvMYB60 and VvMYB30 showed opposite responses to
the increasing salt concentrations; while VvMYB60
expression was reduced five-fold at both concentrations
when compared to the control treatment, VvMYB30
expression increased three-fold on addition of 200 mM
NaCl (Figure 2F).

Activity of the VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 promoters in
Arabidopsis transgenic lines

We employed a reporter gene approach in the heterologous model system Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the
activity of both VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 promoters. A
region of approximately 2 kb located upstream of the
ATG codon of VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 was fused to the
b-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and the resulting
pVvMYB30:GUS and pVvMYB60:GUS constructs were
introduced in Arabidopsis by Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation [22].
We assessed the cell and tissue specificity of reporter
gene expression in ten independent T3 transgenic lines for
each promoter:GUS combination. Fifteen-day-old
pVvMYB30:GUS seedlings displayed expression of the
reporter at the shoot apex, at the base of trichomes located
on leaf primordia, and in the emerging lateral roots
(Figure 3A, B and 3C). At the same developmental stage,
pVvMYB60:GUS seedlings showed GUS expression exclusively in guard cells distributed on cotyledons, hypocotyls
and developing leaves (Figure 3D and 3E). No expression
of the reporter gene was detected in rosette leaves from
mature pVvMYB30:GUS plants, even after prolonged incubation of plant tissues in the GUS solution (data not
shown). On the other hand, we observed guard cell-specific signals in mature leaves of pVvMYB60:GUS plants,
consistent with the GUS profile observed in young seedlings (Figure 3F).
Next, we investigated expression of the reporter in
flowers and siliques from adult plants. Prior to pollination, pVvMYB30:GUS flowers revealed a diffuse staining
of carpels and stigmatic tissues (Additional file 3A). We
did not observe GUS expression in pre- and post-fertilization flowers from most pVvMYB60:GUS lines. In two
transgenic lines, a weak staining was occasionally
detected in stamens, at the interface of filaments and
anthers (Additional file 3B). Finally, we did not detect
expression of the reporter in developing seeds from
either pVvMYB30:GUS or pVvMYB60:GUS transgenic
lines (Additional file 3C).
Expression of both the endogenous Arabidopsis and
grape MYB60 genes is rapidly down-regulated following
treatment with ABA [10] (Figure 2D). We thus investigated changes in GUS expression in the pVvMYB60:GUS
lines in response to exogenous applications of this hormone, using both qPCR and histochemical analyses. A
previously described transgenic line carrying a transcriptional fusion between the Arabidopsis AtMYB60 promoter
and the reporter GUS (pAtMYB60:GUS) was used as a
control for the experiment [10]. As expected, qPCR analysis of GUS expression revealed a significant and rapid
decrease in the accumulation of GUS transcripts in the
control pAtMYB60:GUS plants following exposure to ABA
(P < 0.001) (Figure 3G). We observed a comparable

significantly affect the expression of the reporter (data not
shown).
Occurrence of guard cell-specific motifs in the VvMYB60
promoter

The conserved activity of the Arabidopsis and grape
MYB60 promoters, as emphasized by the analysis of the
corresponding promoter:GUS transgenic lines, suggests
that these two regulatory regions might share common
cis-elements responsible for the guard cell-specific
expression of the reporter. Previous evidence indicates a
role for DNA consensus sequences for DOF-type transcription factors ([A/T]AAAG) as guard cell-specific cisactive enhancers [23]. Specifically, clusters of at least
three [A/T]AAAG motifs located on the same strand
within a region of at most 100 bp were identified as putative guard cell-specific cis-regulatory elements [24].
The Arabidopsis AtMYB60 promoter contains multiple
[A/T]AAAG clusters, of which the most proximal to the
translation start codon (-143 bp), is necessary and sufficient to drive expression in guard cells (Cominelli,
unpublished results) (Additional file 4). We thus searched
the grape VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 promoters for the
occurrence of [A/T]AAAG oligonucleotides, in a region
of 300 bp upstream of the translation start site. We identified a cluster of three [A/T]AAAG motifs in the
VvMYB60 promoter, located at -169 bp from the ATG
codon of the endogenous gene, a distance comparable to
the position of the guard cell regulatory element found in
the promoter of AtMYB60. Consistent with the lack of
activity in Arabidopsis guard cells no [A/T]AAAG clusters were identified in the promoter of the grape
VvMYB30 gene (Additional file 4).
The cellular specificity of gene expression has been
investigated for a very limited number of grape genes.
Among these, VvSIRK, encoding a K+ channel, has been
reported to be specifically expressed in guard cells [25].
Interestingly, we discovered an [A/T]AAAG cluster
upstream of the translation start codon (-200 bp) of
VvSIRK, in the opposite orientation relative to the direction of transcription (Additional file 4).
Functional complementation of the Arabidopsis atmyb601 mutant by VvMYB60

A null allele of the Arabidopsis AtMYB60 gene (atmyb601) displays constitutive reduction of the opening of the
stomatal pores and reduced water loss during drought
[10]. Interestingly, despite its increased tolerance to dehydration relative to the wild type, the atmyb60-1 mutant
does not show obvious alterations in the sensitivity of
guard cells to ABA [10].
We used the atmyb60-1 allele to investigate the role of
VvMYB60 in the regulation of stomatal activity and to

Page 7 of 14

explore the conservation of the MYB60 gene function
between grape and Arabidopsis. To this end, we introduced
the full length VvMYB60 cDNA in transgenic mutant
plants (atmyb60-C60 lines) to assess the ability of the grape
gene to rescue the stomatal defects of the atmyb60-1 allele.
As a control for the complementation, we generated a second series of transgenic plants, in which we transformed
the full length VvMYB30 cDNA in the atmyb60-1 background (atmyb60-C30 lines). It is important to note that
the two VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 promoters displayed
very different patterns of activity in Arabidopsis (Figure
3A, B, C, D, E and 3F). Hence, for a more robust and reliable comparison of the two grape genes in the atmyb60-1
background we used the 1.3 kb AtMYB60 promoter [10] to
drive the expression of VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 in guard
cells. Three independent transgenic mutant lines with a
single insertion locus and comparable levels of expression
of the transgene were selected for further analysis of each
grape gene (Additional file 5).
We performed an in-vitro assay to evaluate the aperture
of the stomatal pore in epidermal strips excised from
mutant and transgenic lines. In agreement with a previous
report [10], light-induced stomatal opening was reduced
in the atmyb60-1 mutant compared to the wild-type (Figure 4A and 4B). Mutant lines expressing the VvMYB30
gene did not display significant differences in the aperture
of the stomatal pores compared to atmyb60-1 (Figure 4A).
Conversely, all the mutant lines transformed with the
VvMYB60 gene displayed a wild-type response in terms of
light-induced stomatal opening, indicating full complementation of the atmyb60-1 mutation (Figure 4B).
To substantiate the results obtained in vitro, we investigated the effect of both VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 in vivo,
by estimating whole-plant transpiration under stress conditions. Wild-type, atmyb60-1, atmyb60-C30 and
atmyb60-C60 plants were grown in soil and pots were
covered with tin foil to prevent evaporation, so that
water loss occurring through stomatal transpiration
could be quantified. Pots were regularly watered for 20
days, and subsequently drought stress was imposed by
terminating irrigation. As expected, transpirational water
loss, as determined by soil water content measurements,
was significantly reduced in atmyb60-1 compared to the
wild-type (P < 0.01 at 2, 4 and 10 days, P < 0.001 at 6, 8,
12-18 days) (Figure 4C and 4D). Consistently with results
from the in vitro assay, mutant lines expressing the
VvMYB30 gene did not show any difference in term of
water loss compared to the atmyb60-1 mutant (Figure
4C). Conversely, under the same conditions, the lines
expressing the VvMYB60 gene displayed a rate of water
loss indistinguishable from the one observed in the wildtype, thus demonstrating complete rescue of the stomatal
defects of the atmyb60-1 mutant (Figure 4D).

Discussion
Identification of a Grape ortholog of the AtMYB60
Transcription Factor

The MYB superfamily constitutes the most abundant
group of transcription factors found in plants, with at least
198 members in Arabidopsis and 183 in rice [26]. In
grape, 108 putative R2R3- MYB family genes were found
in the first genome version (8x coverage) [12], whereas
more than 125 R2R3 MYB genes can be found using the
12x version (Matus, unpublished results). Plant R2R3-type
MYB transcription factors are implicated in several processes related to cell fate, plant development, hormonal
responses, pathogen-disease resistance, drought and cold
tolerance, light sensing and flavonoid biosynthesis, among
many other functions [27]. MYB genes have been intensively investigated in grape, yet most studies have focused
on members of the R2R3 clade involved in the regulation
of the anthocyanin and pro-anthocyanidin biosynthetic
pathway, as the accumulation of these flavonoid compounds in fruit tissues is a key determinant of berry and
wine quality [28]. Conversely, MYB genes clustered outside the flavonoid biosynthesis functional group received
little attention.
This work shows the identification of the grape
VvMYB60 gene, as a functional ortholog of the Arabidopsis AtMYB60 gene, involved in the regulation of lightinduced stomatal aperture [10]. Four lines of evidence
support this conclusion: i) the aminoacidic sequence of
the VvMYB60 and AtMYB60 proteins is highly conserved, ii) the VvMYB60 and AtMYB60 genes show very
similar expression profiles, both in terms of tissue- and
cell-specificity and response to ABA, iii) the VvMYB60
and AtMYB60 promoters drive expression of reporter
genes exclusively in guard cells and share common cisregulatory elements, iv) the expression of VvMYB60 in
the atmyb60-1 mutant background completely rescues
the loss of the AtMYB60 function.
The Arabidopsis and grape MYB60 proteins resulted
more similar to each other than to any other MYB in
grape or Arabidopsis, even inside subgroup 1, reason why
we denoted subgroups 1.1 and 1.2 for further classification. Two main features discriminate between the Arabidopsis and grape MYB60 proteins and other closely
related proteins from subgroup 1: a distinctive PHEEG signature in the MYB domain, located in the loop connecting
the R2 and R3 repeats, and the lack of the first (CtM1) of
three C-terminal motifs present in all the other MYB proteins assigned to subgroup 1 (Figure 1B). Notably, both
characteristics are conserved in putative MYB60 orthologs
that we identified in other plant genomes, including oilseed rape, tomato, cucumber and poplar (data not shown).
Even though a role for the PHEEG and CtM1 motifs has
not yet been described, it is intriguing to speculate that

the presence of the former and the absence of the latter,
might contribute to the specificity of the MYB60 function
in guard cells.
Expression features of VvMYB60 in grape organs

It has been previously shown that the Arabidopsis
AtMYB60 gene is expressed in seedlings, rosette leaves,
stems and flowers and its level of expression is rapidly
down-regulated by the stress hormone ABA [10]. In addition, publicly available repositories of microarray-based
gene profiling experiments indicate that AtMYB60 is
transiently expressed during seed development, peaking
in stage 7 seeds (walking stick embryos) and rapidly
declining in mature seeds (The Bio-Array Resource for
Plant Functional Genomics, http://bar.utoronto.ca/).
Our survey of VvMYB30 and VvMYB60 expression in
grape tissues revealed that both genes are preferentially
expressed in leaves, berry skin and seeds (Figure 2A).
Similarly to AtMYB60, and opposite to VvMYB30, expression of VvMYB60 in seeds was down-regulated during
seed development (Figure 2B). In berry skin VvMYB60
expression was higher before veraison, when the grape
berry is photosynthetically active and stomata are functional, and was reduced after veraison, when stomata
evolve into non-functional lenticels [29] (Figure 2C). Interestingly, at this stage, the onset of ripening and the accumulation of sugars are correlated to increasing levels of
ABA in the berry [30], suggesting a possible negative effect
of the hormone on the expression of VvMYB60 in grape
tissues. Indeed, treatment of leaves with exogenous ABA
resulted in the rapid down-regulation of VvMYB60 expression (Figure 2D). In contrast, the hormone did not have
any effect on the accumulation of the VvMYB30 transcripts (Figure 2E). Additionally, osmotic stresses which
trigger ABA-mediated responses, as high concentrations
of NaCl, caused the rapid down-regulation of VvMYB60
expression in grape tissues (Figure 2F). Interestingly, it has
been recently shown that applications of low concentrations of ABA can trigger a transient up-regulation of
MYB60 expression in Arabidopsis seedlings [31]. This suggests that the pattern of AtMYB60 expression in response
to osmotic stress might be rather complex and dosedependent. Even though the detailed analysis of the
mechanisms that regulate the expression of the VvMYB60
gene extends beyond the scope of this work, it will be
intriguing to further investigate the expression profile of
VvMYB60 in different grape tissues in response to a wider
range of ABA concentrations.
The VvMYB60 promoter specifically drives reporter gene
expression in Arabidopsis guard cells

Reporter gene analysis and RT-PCR experiments
performed on purified Arabidopsis stomata, clearly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/142

demonstrated that in green tissues, AtMYB60 is exclusively expressed in guard cells [8,24].
We produced Arabidopsis lines harboring the GUS
marker gene under the control of the VvMYB30 and
VvMYB60 promoters to establish the cellular localization of gene expression. Histochemical analysis of GUS
expression in several independent lines indicated that
the activity of the VvMYB60 promoter is restricted to
guard cells (Figure 3D, E and 3F). This result is consistent with the expression of the endogenous VvMYB60
gene in leaves and berry skin, which both contain stomata, and with the lack of expression in roots (Figure
2A). Reporter gene approaches in Arabidopsis provide
efficient and reliable tools to investigate the expression
of grape genes and to identify gene regulatory elements
[25]. Yet, we did not observe reporter activity in developing seeds of the pVvMYB30:GUS and pVvMYB60:
GUS lines (Additional file 3C). This finding is in contrast with data from qPCR experiments, which showed
that both genes are highly expressed in grape seeds (Figure 2A and 2B). This discrepancy could simply be artefactual, because of the heterologous genetic background.
However, it is important to note that we did not detect
GUS activity in developing seeds of pAtMYB60:GUS
plants, used as a positive control in this study, despite
the high expression of the endogenous Arabidopsis gene
in these organs [32]. Different hypotheses can be formulated to explain the lack of activity of the AtMYB60 and
VvMYB60 promoters in seeds. First, cis-elements
responsible for the seed expression of the endogenous
genes could be located outside the regulatory genomic
regions considered in this work. However, Cominelli
and colleagues reported that the complete 5’ and 3’
AtMYB60 intergenic regions, cloned upstream and
downstream of the GUS gene, do not drive expression
of the reporter in seeds [10]. Alternatively, expression of
AtMYB60 and VvMYB60 in seeds could be mediated by
intragenic regulatory elements. Cis-acting motifs, located
in introns, have been demonstrated to be required to
establish the correct expression domain of transcription
factors, such as the MADS-box AGAMOUS gene [33].
Most interestingly, seed-specific enhancers have been
mapped in the intronic regions of seed-expressed genes
in different plant species [34]. Finally, the finding that
the AtMYB60 mRNA is associated with polyribosomes
purified from guard cells but not from other plant tissues [35], opens the possibility for a translational level
of regulation for MYB60 expression in seeds. Clearly,
more work is needed to unravel the nature of the cisregulatory elements that modulate MYB60 expression in
seeds, together with revealing the function of this gene
in these organs. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to conclude that the stomata-specific activity of the VvMYB60

Page 10 of 14

promoter in Arabidopsis mirrors the expression of the
endogenous gene in grape guard cells.
While the identity of the cis-acting elements required for
the expression of AtMYB60 and VvMYB60 in seeds
remains elusive, their expression in stomata is most likely
regulated, in cis, by DOF recognition DNA motifs. We
identified a cluster of [A/T]AAAG DOF target sites in
close proximity to the VvMYB60 translational start codon
(Additional file 4). Such a cluster has been described as a
guard cell-specific cis-regulatory element in different plant
species, including Arabidopsis and potato [23,24]. The
occurrence of [A/T]AAAG motifs in the guard cell-specific VvMYB60 and VvSIRK grape promoters lends further
support to the conservation of the cis- and, possibly, transmechanisms that direct expression in guard cells in
distantly related plant species. Interestingly, strong conservation across a wide range of flowering plant species has
also been reported for other cell-specific cis-motifs, such
as the root hair-specific cis-elements (RHEs) [36].
VvMYB60 is a functional ortholog of AtMYB60

The ability of VvMYB60 to fully complement, both in vitro
and in vivo, the stomatal defects exhibited by the atmy60-1
mutant unequivocally demonstrates that VvMYB60 is a
true ortholog of the Arabidopsis AtMYB60 transcription
factor. Importantly, the VvMYB30 gene product, which
shares 47% identity to VvMYB60, did not complement the
atmyb60-1 mutation. This result is in agreement with
functional studies which indicate that, despite the high
degree of homology between the AtMYB30 and AtMYB60
aminoacidic sequences, these two proteins play two distinct functional roles. In Arabidopsis, AtMYB30 mediates
brassinosteroid-induced gene expression [15] and pathogen-induced hypersensitive response [16], whereas
AtMYB60 positively regulates light-induced stomatal
opening and modulates water loss under drought [10].
As a whole, our findings indicate a role for VvMYB60 in
the regulation of guard cell activity and transpiration rate
in grapevine. Stomatal conductance is a key trait in grapevine, as it directly determines the isohydric/anisohydric
behavior displayed by different genotypes. These differences are due to stomatal control over evaporative demand
rather than stomatal density in vegetative tissues [37]. Cultivar-specific differences have also been described for the
effects of water deficit on ABA metabolism and signaling
[38]. Anisohydric cultivars such as Pinot Noir possess
insufficient stomatal regulation and show high transpiration rates and stomatal conductance, whereas isohydric
cultivars as Shiraz, display much lower values [39]. In this
perspective, it will be interesting to survey variations in
naturally occurring VvMYB60 alleles and to establish their
contribution to differences in stomatal activity in different
Vitis species and cultivars.

Conclusions
VvMYB60 could represent a valuable target for downstream biotechnological applications. Although grapevine
is a highly productive water stress-adapted plant, the availability of molecular targets for engineering or breeding of
new cultivars with enhanced stomatal responses represents
an attractive approach to increase water use efficiency and,
possibly, to reduce pathogen penetration through the stomatal pore [40,41].

For salt treatments, nodal explants of Vitis vinifera cv.
Cabernet Sauvignon were placed vertically on sterile MS
medium supplemented with 3 mM NaCl (standard),
100 mM NaCl or 200 mM NaCl and left for a month in a
growth chamber (20°C; 16 h photoperiod). At the end of
the experiment, complete plantlets were collected for
RNA extraction.

Methods

Relative transcript quantification of isolated genes was
achieved by real time RT-PCR, using the Brilliant® SYBR®
Green QPCR Master Reagent Kit (Stratagene) and the
Mx3000P detection system (Stratagene) as described in
the manufacturer’s manual. Primers qPCR_VvMYB30fw
(5’-CTCAAGTCCCTCTCACAATG-3’) and qPCR_VvM
YB30rev (5’-TGTCAATTAGGTCTTCTTGTTC-3’),
qPCR_VvMYB60fw (5’-TTGAGTACGAAAACCTGAATGAT-3’) and qPCR_VvMYB60rev (5’-GGAGGGTT
GTGCTTCTTCTGAT-3’) were used for amplification
and qPCR quantification of VvMYB30 (81 bp) and
VvMYB60 (121 bp), respectively. Amplification of the UBIQUITIN (99 bp) or GLYCERALDEHYDE 3-PHOSPHATE
DEHYDROGENASE (G3PDH) genes was used for normalization [44], depending on their expression variations for
each experimental condition. PCR conditions, standard
quantification curves for each gene and relative gene
expression calculations were conducted according to
Matus et al. [45].

Phylogeny reconstruction and bootstrap analysis

Alignments were performed using the BLOSUM matrix
(Gap opening and extension penalties of 10 and 5, respectively) of the ClustalW algorithm-based AlignX® module
from Mega4 Software [42]. A rooted tree was constructed
using the Neighbour Joining Method (NJ) in MEGA4 and
confirmed with MEGA3. Tree nodes were evaluated by
bootstrap analysis for 100 replicates (pairwise deletion,
uniform rates and Poisson correction options). Publicly
available sequences were collected from Genbank via
NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The corresponding
cDNAs of the complete coding sequences of VvMYB30
and VvMYB60 were amplified from PN40024 genomic
DNA and leaf cDNA, respectively, using the following primer combinations: VvMYB30F1-VvMYB30R3 and
Vv60L2F4-Vv60L2R4 (see below for primer sequences).
Field sampling of grape organs and nucleic acid
extraction

Grapevine organs (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) were collected from a commercial vineyard in
the Maipo Valley, Chile, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for
RNA extraction. For grape berry skin and seed sampling,
a total of nine grape clusters were collected from three
plants every two weeks during fruit development, beginning two weeks after fruit set and ending at eight weeks
after veraison. Total RNA was isolated from all grapevine
tissues as described [43]. For cDNA synthesis, one μg of
total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamer
primers using StrataScript® reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
ABA and salt treatment experiments

For ABA treatments, young leaves of Vitis vinifera cv.
Cabernet Sauvignon were cut from two month old plantlets cultivated in vitro and placed in petri dishes supplemented with 50 μM, 100 μM ABA (+/- cis, trans ABA;
SIGMA), dissolved in 100% ethanol, or with an equal
amount of 100% ethanol (mock solution). Samples were
maintained in a growth chamber at 20°C in the light (120
μmol m-2 sec-1 of measured light irradiance), and every
two hours three leaves from each treatment were collected for RNA extraction.

Quantitative comparison of gene expression in grape
tissues

Plasmid constructs, generation and analysis of
Arabidopsis transgenic lines

To generate the pVvMYB30:GUS construct, a region of
2,173 bp upstream of the translational start codon was
amplified from grape genomic DNA (Pinot noir,
PN40024), using primers VvMYB30F3 (5’-AAGCTTCTGACGCAGTTTTCAACCATC-3’), containing a HindIII
site, and VvMYB30R4 (5’-TCTAGAGGTGGCCTCCCC
TTGGCT-3’), containing an XbaI site. The HindIII-XbaI
fragment was cloned upstream of the uidA coding sequence in the pBI101.3 binary vector (Stratagene). Similarly,
the 2,239 bp putative pVvMYB60:GUS promoter was
amplified with primers Vv60F3 (5’-AAGCTTATGAGA
GGTCGTATAAGTA-3’), containing a HindIII site, and
Vv60R3 (5’-TCTAGAGGCCTTCCTATGGCTT-3’), containing an XbaI site, and the PCR fragment was cloned in
the pBI101.3 vector. The VvMYB30 full length cDNA, was
obtained by amplification of PN40024 leaf cDNA with the
primers VvMYB30F1 (5’-GGATCCATGGGGAGGCCA
CCTTG-3’), containing a BamHI site and VvMYB30R3
(5’-GATATCTAGAAGAGCTGAGCAGTGTCCT-3’),
containing an EcoRV site. The full length VvMYB60
cDNA was amplified with the primer Vv60L2F4 (5’-GGA
TCCATGGGAAGGCCTCCTTGCTGTG-3’), containing

Galbiati et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:142
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/142

a BamHI site and the primer Vv60L2R4 (5’-GAGCTCTCAGAATATTGGAGAGAGTTGATCC-3’), containing a
SacI site. Amplified cDNAs were sequenced and then
cloned in a modified version of the pPZP221 binary vector,
containing the 1.3 kb AtMYB60 promoter and the nos terminator (Galbiati, unpublished). All constructs were introduced in Arabidopsis (Col-0) by Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation as described [22]. Transformed lines were
selected on antibiotic containing media, and the presence
of the transgene was confirmed by PCR. For analysis of
transgene expression, total RNA was isolated with the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed with
the RT Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). Semi-quantitative
RT-PCRs were performed for 25 cycles with primer pairs:
Vv30F2 (5’-GGATCCATGGGAAGGCCTCCTTGCT-3’)
and Vv30R2 (5’-AAGTCTGACAGTGATGAGAGGAGC3’); Vv60F2 (5’-CTCCTTGCTGTGATAAAGTTGGTAT3’) and Vv60R2 (5’-ATTCAGGTTTTCGTACTCAAGAATG-3’). The control AtACTIN2 gene (At3g18780)
[46] was amplified using primers AtACT2F (5’-GTGT
TGGACTCTGGAGATGGTGTG-3’) and AtACT2R (5’GCCAAAGCAGTGATCTCTTTGCTC-3’). Homozygous
T3 lines were selected for GUS staining and functional
complementation analyses.
Arabidopsis growth, ABA treatment and analysis of GUS
expression

Seeds were surface-sterilized overnight in a sealed chamber in the presence of 100 ml of commercial bleach and
3 ml of 37% HCl, and germinated in Petri dishes containing Murashige and Skoog medium, 1% w/v sucrose and
0.8% w/v agar. Plants were grown under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark, at 100 μmol m-2 sec-1) at 22°C
in a controlled growth chamber. For ABA treatments,
plants were transferred to liquid MS medium with 3% w/
v sucrose and 0.5 g/l MES, supplemented with 100 μM
ABA (+/- cis, trans ABA; SIGMA), dissolved in 100%
ethanol, or with an equal amount of 100% ethanol (mock
solution). For detection of GUS activity, tissues were
incubated for 6 hr, at 37°C, in 0.5 mg/ml X-glucuronic
acid, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mM ferrocyanidine in
100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7). Tissues were cleared
with 70% ethanol and examined using a Leica M205 FA
stereoscope or a Leica DM2500 optical microscope.
qPCR analysis of GUS expression was performed as
described for the grape samples, using primers
qPCR_GUSF1 (5’-TACGGCAAAGTGTGGGTCAATA
ATCA-3’) and qPCR_GUSR1 (5’-CAGGTGTTCGGC
GTGGTGTAGAG-3’). GUS expression was normalized
using the control AtACTIN2 gene (At3g18780) [46],
amplified with primers qPCR_AtACT2fw (5’-TGCTTCT
CCATTTGTTTGTTTC-3’) and qPCR_AtACT2rev (5’GGCATCAATTCGATCACTCA-3’).

Stomatal aperture and water loss measurements

Stomatal assays were performed on abaxial epidermis
strips, incubated in 30 mM KCl, 10 mM MES-KOH, pH
6.5, at 22°C, and exposed to light (300 μmol m-2 sec-1) for 4
h. Measurements of stomatal aperture were performed
using a Leica DM2500 optical microscope and the LAS
Image Analysis software. For drought experiments, seeds
were germinated in individual pots each containing the
same amount of pre-wetted soil. Plants were regularly irrigated for 20 days. Before watering was terminated, pots
were covered with tin foil to minimize evaporation from
soil. Pots were weighed every other day at the same time
for 18 days. At the end of the treatment, pots were dried
for three days at 65°C to determine the dry weight. Water
content was estimated as [(Wtn-DW)/(Wt0-DW)] × 100,
where Wtn = total weight of the pot at day n; DW = dry
weight of the pot and Wt0 = total weight of the pot at day 0.
