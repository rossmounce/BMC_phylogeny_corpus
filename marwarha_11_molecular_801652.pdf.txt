Molecular interplay between leptin, insulin-like
growth factor-1, and b-amyloid in organotypic
slices from rabbit hippocampus

Abstract
Background: Evidence shows that the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and leptin reduce b-amyloid (Ab)
production and tau phosphorylation, two major hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). IGF-1 expression involves the
JAK/STAT pathway and the expression of leptin is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1). We have previously shown that Ab reduces leptin by inhibiting the mTORC1 pathway and Ab was also
suggested to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway, potentially attenuating IGF-1 expression. As IGF-1 can activate mTORC1
and leptin can modulate JAK/STAT pathway, we determined the extent to which IGF-1 and leptin can upregulate
the expression of one another and protect against Ab-induced downregulation.
Results: We demonstrate that incubation of organotypic slices from adult rabbit hippocampus with Ab42
downregulates IGF-1 expression by inhibiting JAK2/STAT5 pathway. Leptin treatment reverses these Ab42 effects
on IGF-1 and treatment with the STAT5 inhibitor completely abrogated the leptin-induced increase in IGF-1.
Furthermore, EMSA and ChIP analyses revealed that leptin increases the STAT5 binding to the IGF-1 promoter. We
also show that IGF-1 increases the expression of leptin and reverses the Ab42-induced attenuation in leptin
expression via the activation of mTORC1 signaling as the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin completely precluded the
IGF-1-induced increase in leptin expression.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate for the first time that Ab42 downregulates IGF-1 expression and that leptin
and IGF-1 rescue one another from downregulation by Ab42. Our study provides a valuable insight into the leptin/
IGF-1/Ab interplay that may be relevant to the pathophysiology of AD.

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically characterized
by the deposition and accumulation of b-amyloid (Ab)
peptide in extracellular plaques, the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in intracellular neurofibrillary tangles
(NFT’s), oxidative stress and synaptic loss. Increased
levels of Ab42 (soluble and insoluble) are suggested to
play a key role in the neurodegenerative processes that
characterize AD. Reduction in the accumulation of this
peptide is widely viewed as a potential strategy to protect
against AD. There is compelling evidence that the

insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is involved in the
metabolism and clearance of Ab [1,2]. Several studies
have shown that serum levels of IGF-1 are decreased in
AD patients [3-5]. IGF-1 is endogenously produced in
the central nervous system [6-8] and is also transported
into the brain from the periphery across the blood-brain
barrier [9]. In the peripheral system, IGF-1 expression is
contingent on the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway,
involving the transcription factor STAT5 [10,11].
Leptin, an adipocytokine produced endogenously in the
brain [12-15], has also been shown to reduce Ab levels in
vitro [16] as well as in vivo [17,18] and circulating leptin
levels are reduced in AD [19]. Expression levels of leptin
are regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) [20-22]. Interestingly, IGF-1 and

leptin are interconnected. While IGF-1 activates
mTORC1 [23,24], potentially increasing expression levels
of leptin, numerous studies have demonstrated the activation of STAT5 by leptin [25-28] suggesting that leptin
may control IGF-1 expression via STAT5 activation. We
have recently demonstrated that Ab42 downregulates
leptin expression levels in organotypic hippocampal slices
via inhibition of the mTORC1 signaling pathway [15].
However, the extent to which Ab42 may inhibit IGF-1
expression by inhibiting JAK2/STAT5 has not been
determined. Furthermore, the extent to which IGF-1
treatment activates mTORC1 and treatment with leptin
activates JAK2/STAT5 respectively precluding Ab42induced leptin and IGF-1 downregulation are not known.
In this study we found that Ab42 reduces IGF-1 expression levels by inhibiting JAK2/STAT5 pathway and treatment with leptin prevented these Ab42 effects. IGF-1
treatment also upregulated leptin levels and prevented
Ab42-induced leptin downregulation by mechanisms
involving mTORC1 activation. As increased levels of
Ab42 is a major pathogenic factor in AD, understanding
the cellular mechanisms by which IGF-1 and leptin interact to modulate Ab42 effects may be relevant to the
search of agents that preclude the deleterious effects of
this peptide.

that leptin activates the JAK2/STAT5 pathway, we
determined the effects of Ab42 on the activation status
of JAK2/STAT5 in the presence and absence of leptin.
Western blotting and densitometric analysis show that
Ab42 significantly attenuates JAK2/STAT5 signaling in
hippocampal organotypic slices as evidenced with a
decrease in p-Tyr 1007/1008 JAK2 (Figure 2a,b) and
p-Tyr694 STAT5 levels (Figure 2c,d). Leptin treatment
elicited a significant increase in p-Tyr1007/1008 JAK2 (Figure 2a,b) and p-Tyr 694 STAT5 levels (Figure 2c,d).
While leptin treatment partially, yet significantly,
reversed the effect of Ab42 on p-Tyr 1007/1008 JAK2 it
completely restored p-Tyr 694 STAT5 levels from the
attenuation induced by Ab42 (Figure 2c,d).
Furthermore, as the nuclear translocation and subsequent transcriptional activity of STAT5 is contingent on
phosphorylation, we determined the effect of Ab42 and
leptin treatment on levels of p-Tyr 694 STAT5 in the
nuclear extracts. We found that Ab42 treatment completely abolished the translocation of STAT5 to the
nucleus, thus mitigating STAT5 transcriptional activity
(Figure 2e,f). Leptin treatment, either alone or concomitant with Ab42, elicited a profound rise in STAT5 translocation to the nucleus (Figure 2e,f).
Leptin induces IGF-1 expression levels via STAT5

Results
Ab42 decreases IGF-1 expression levels and treatment
with exogenous leptin reverses the effects of Ab42

Western blotting and densitometric analysis (Figure 1a,
b) show a decrease in IGF-1 levels in the organotypic
hippocampal slices treated with Ab42 compared to
untreated organotypic slices. Interestingly, treatment
with leptin completely restores the decrease in IGF-1
levels induced by Ab42. Leptin treatment also increases
basal IGF-1 levels. Quantitative determination of IGF-1
levels by ELISA immunoassay (Figure 1c) corroborates
Western blotting data and demonstrates that Ab42
treatment decreases IGF-1 protein levels and concomitant treatment with leptin reverses the decrease induced
by Ab42. ELISA immunoassay also clearly depicts the
increase in basal IGF-1 protein levels induced by leptin
treatment. Real time RT-PCR analysis (Figure 1d) shows
a significant decrease in IGF-1 mRNA in organotypic
hippocampal slices treated with Ab42 compared to
untreated organotypic slices. Treatment with leptin
completely restores the decrease in IGF-1 mRNA
induced by Ab42. Leptin treatment also increases the
basal IGF-1 mRNA levels.

with exogenous leptin restores JAK2/STAT5 signaling

the regulation of peripheral IGF-1 expression and given

As we observed a significant increase in IGF-1 protein
levels and IGF-1 mRNA expression with leptin treatment, we examined the extent to which activated
STAT5 regulates IGF-1 expression levels and mediates
the leptin-induced upregulation in IGF-1 expression
levels in the hippocampus. To characterize the involvement of STAT5 as the mediator of leptin-induced
increase in IGF-1 expression levels, we systematically
treated organotypic slices with a specific inhibitor of
STAT5. The STAT5 inhibitor 573108 we used has an
IC 50 of ~ 47 μM and selectively targets the SH2
domains of STAT5, preventing its phosphorylation,
activation, dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation [29]. The STAT5 inhibitor 573108 targets
STAT5 specifically while eliciting no effect on STAT1
or STAT3 even at 600 μM [29]. Treatment of organotypic slices with the STAT5 inhibitor significantly
attenuated IGF-1 protein levels as measured by Western blotting (Figure 3a,b) and ELISA immunoassay
(Figure 3c). The STAT5 inhibitor significantly attenuated IGF-1 mRNA expression as demonstrated by real
time RT-PCR (Figure 3d) suggesting the importance
of STAT5 in basal and leptin-mediated increase in
IGF-1 expression. Concomitant leptin treatment with
STAT5 inhibitor failed to rescue the attenuated IGF-1
expression levels induced by the STAT5 inhibitor,
thus suggesting that leptin induces IGF-1 expression
via STAT5.

Leptin induces IGF-1 expression levels by increasing the
binding of STAT5 to the IGF-1 promoter region

To elucidate the mechanism of leptin-induced STAT5mediated increase in expression levels of IGF-1 and further
characterize the role of STAT5 in IGF-1 transcription, we
performed an Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)
with a double stranded DNA probe corresponding to the
STAT5 binding consensus sequence on the rabbit IGF-1
promoter. The STAT5 binding site in the IGF-1 distal promoter region has been well characterized in humans [30]
and in mouse [31]. EMSA analysis was performed using
double stranded oligonucleotide probes that correspond to
two evolutionary conserved STAT5 binding sites in the
IGF-1 promoter region (GenBank Accession # AF022961). EMSA (Figure 4a) analysis clearly demonstrates increased STAT5 binding to the labeled exogenous
double stranded oligonucleotide probe that corresponds to
the STAT5 binding site in the IGF-1 promoter region in
response to leptin treatment. Furthermore, treatment with
Ab42 completely abolished STAT5 binding to this exogenous oligonucleotide probe, therefore indicating that Ab42
attenuates STAT5 binding to the IGF-1 promoter. Co-

treatment of organotypic slices with leptin and Ab42 completely restored the STAT5 binding to the exogenous oligonucleotide probe. We next performed ChIP analysis to
evaluate the extent of STAT5 binding in the IGF-1 promoter region. ChIP assay (Figure 4b) clearly shows increased
STAT5 binding in the IGF-1 promoter region in response
to leptin treatment as demonstrated by a 6 fold enrichment
of the STAT5 binding site upon qPCR compared to control after normalization to % input. In a stark contrast,
treatment with Ab42 results in a marked loss of STAT5
binding in the IGF-1 promoter region as determined by
amplification of STAT5 binding site using qPCR, thus
accounting for a decrease in IGF-1 expression observed
with Ab42 treatment. Leptin treatment completely reverses
the inhibitory effects of Ab42 on STAT5 binding in the
IGF-1 promoter and therefore reverses the inhibition
induced by Ab42 treatment on IGF-1 transcription.
IGF-1 increases leptin expression levels and reverses the
Ab42-induced attenuation in leptin expression

leptin expression levels by attenuating mTORC1

Figure 2 Leptin treatment activates JAK2/STAT5 pathway and reverses the inhibition by Ab42 of the JAK2/STAT5 activation. (a)
Representative Western blot and (b) densitometric analyses show that treatment of organotypic slices with Ab42 for 72 hours significantly
decreases phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr1007/1008 residues. Leptin treatment increases basal levels and opposes Ab42-induced decrease in pTyr1007/1008 JAK2 levels. (c,d) Treatment of organotypic slices with Ab42 for 72 hours also decreases phosphorylation of STAT5 at Tyr694,
potentially mitigating STAT5 activation. Leptin treatment increases basal levels of p-Tyr694 STAT5 and prevents the reduction in p-Tyr694 STAT5
induced by Ab42. (e,f) Treatment of organotypic slices with Ab42 reduces the translocation of p-Tyr694 STAT5 into the nucleus as evidenced by
reduced levels of p-Tyr694 STAT5 in the nuclear fractions. Leptin treatment, alone or in the presence of Ab42, increases the nuclear levels of pTyr694 STAT5. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 versus control; † p < 0.05 and † † p < 0.01 versus Ab42.

activation and signaling [15]. There is preponderance of
evidence that IGF-1 activates mTORC1 signaling
through IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway [23,24,32]. We determined the effects of IGF-1 treatment on leptin expression in the presence and absence of Ab42. Western
blotting and densitometric analysis (Figure 5a,b) show
that IGF-1 treatment significantly increases the levels of
leptin compared to basal levels in control untreated
slices. Immunoassay using ELISA also clearly demonstrates that IGF-1 increases leptin protein levels (Figure

5c). Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrates that IGF-1
treatment increases leptin mRNA expression (Figure
5d). Furthermore, IGF-1 treatment also completely
reverses the attenuation in leptin protein levels induced
by Ab42 as demonstrated by Western blotting and densitometric analyses (Figure 5a,b) as well as by ELISA
immunoassay (Figure 5c). IGF-1 treatment also completely reverses the attenuation in leptin mRNA expression
induced by Ab42 as demonstrated by real time RT-PCR
analysis (Figure 5d).

IGF-1 increases leptin expression levels via the activation
of mTORC1

As we found in this study that IGF-1 increases leptin
expression levels and our previous studies have demonstrated that mTORC1 activation is a requisite for leptin
expression, we determined whether IGF-1 treatment
activates mTORC1 signaling. Several other studies have
demonstrated that IGF-1 increases mTORC1 activation
and signaling through Akt activation [33]. We determined the effects of IGF-1 on the phosphorylation status of mTOR (measuring levels of p-Ser2448 mTOR) and
on the phosphorylation status of p70S6K1 (p-Thr 389
p70S6K1), the downstream substrate and indicator of
mTOR activation. Ab42 treatment caused a significant
reduction in the levels of p-Ser2448 mTOR (Figure 6a,b)
and p-Thr 389 p70S6K1 (Figure 6c,d), suggesting that
treatment with Ab42 results in downregulation of
mTORC1 activation and signaling. This is in accordance
with our previously published study [15]. In a stark contrast, treatment with IGF-1 resulted in a significant
increase in the phosphorylation of mTOR and p70S6K1
(Figure 6a-d). Furthermore, IGF-1 treatment completely

reversed the Ab42-induced attenuation of mTORC1
activation and signaling. To further characterize the
involvement of mTORC1 in the IGF-1 induced increase
in leptin expression levels, we treated the organotypic
slices with rapamycin, an allosteric inhibitor of
mTORC1. In the presence of rapamycin, IGF-1 was
ineffective in augmenting leptin expression levels (Figure
7a-d). This suggests that mTORC1 activation and signaling are a requisite for IGF-1 induced increase in leptin expression.
IGF-1 treatment enhances translation and increases levels
of the transcription factor C-EBPa, which mediates
increased leptin transcription

Several lines of evidence suggest that mTORC1 regulates
leptin biosynthesis at the level of translation [20-22]. In
this study and our previous studies [15] we have demonstrated that treatment of organotypic slices with rapamycin, in addition to reducing leptin protein levels, also
reduced leptin mRNA. This data suggests that mTORC1
may also control the translation of some of the transcription factors involved in leptin transcription. There is

Figure 4 Effects of Ab42 and leptin on the binding of STAT5 to
IGF-1 promoter region. (a) Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
(EMSA) demonstrates that Ab42 abrogates STAT5 binding to the
exogenous oligonucleotide probes. Leptin treatment restores STAT5
binding to the oligonucleotide probe. (b) A Chromatin
Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrates that treatment with
leptin results in about 7-fold increase in STAT5 binding in the IGF-1
promoter region. ChIP analysis also revealed that treatment with
Ab42 attenuates binding of STAT5 to the IGF-1 promoter, while
concomitant leptin treatment precludes this deleterious effect.

substantial evidence that mTORC1 translationally controls
the protein levels of the transcription factor C-EBPa [34].
C-EBPa is the most abundant transcription factor regulating leptin expression in the adipose tissue [35,35,36,38].
Other transcription factors involved in leptin expression
include Sp1, LP1, and AP-2b [35,36]. However, there is no
general consensus suggesting regulation of these transcription factors by mTORC1 or rapamycin. A scan of the rabbit leptin gene promoter region present between 10000

Page 6 of 18

nucleotides upstream and the leptin transcription initiation site using the “TFsearch” program revealed multiple
C-EBPa consensus binding motifs (GenBank Accession #:
NC013675). We therefore investigated the involvement of
C-EBPa transcription factor in leptin expression and specifically in IGF-1-induced increase or Ab42-induced
decrease in leptin expression. Our results demonstrate
that in response to IGF-1 treatment, expression and subsequent translocation of C-EBPa into the nucleus are
increased as demonstrated by Western blotting (Figure 8ad). On the other hand, treatment with Ab42 results in a
substantial attenuation of C-EBPa expression levels and
subsequent translocation to the nucleus (Figure 8a-d).
Remarkably, IGF-1 treatment completely reverses the
attenuation induced by Ab42 on the expression levels and
subsequent nuclear translocation of C-EBPa. To correlate
the nuclear levels of C-EBPa with its transcriptional activity modulating leptin expression, we next performed a
ChIP assay analysis to establish the extent of binding of CEBPa to the leptin promoter. ChIP analysis revealed a 3.5
fold increase in binding of C-EBPa in the leptin promoter
region in response to IGF-1 treatment (Figure 8e). Analogous to a decrease in C-EBPa expression and subsequent
nuclear translocation, Ab42 treatment also attenuated the
binding of C-EBPa to the leptin promoter. This effect
induced by Ab42 was completely reversed by concomitant
IGF-1 treatment, thereby implicating C-EBPa as the molecular element utilized by Ab42 and IGF-1 to modulate
leptin expression.
We also determined the extent to which mTORC1
activation and signaling is involved in the regulation of
C-EBPa expression levels in the rabbit hippocampus.
The mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin significantly reduced
the protein levels of C-EBPa and consequently reduced
the translocation of C-EBPa into the nucleus in
response to IGF-1 treatment (Figure 9a-d). Furthermore,
in the presence of rapamycin, IGF-1 treatment failed to
increase the expression of C-EBPa and to induce its
translocation into the nucleus. This implicates C-EBPa
as the mediator of the activated mTORC1-induced
increase in leptin transcription. This suggests that IGF1-induced upregulation in leptin expression is a consequence of increased binding of the transcription factor
C-EBPa in the leptin promoter region and this is
mediated by mTORC1 activation and signaling.

Discussion
This study was conceived to examine the impact of Ab
on the expression of IGF-1 in the hippocampus and
assess the role of leptin signaling in the modulation of
IGF-1 expression. We demonstrate that Ab42 induces a
marked reduction in IGF-1 expression and treatment
with the adipocytokine leptin increases the basal expression levels of IGF-1 and reverses the Ab42-induced

expression levels. IGF-1 treatment increases basal leptin levels and opposes the reduction induced by Ab42 on leptin levels. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01

attenuation in IGF-1 expression levels. We further
demonstrate that the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT5
underlies Ab42 and leptin effects on IGF-1 expression,
and that IGF-1 expression is mediated by the transcription factor STAT5. We also demonstrate that IGF-1 regulates leptin expression via the mTORC1 signaling
pathway by a mechanism that involves the transcription
factor C-EBPa. This suggests a mutual positive feedback
loop between IGF-1 and leptin and indicates that both
IGF-1 and leptin reinforce the expression and activation
of each other.
This study demonstrates that Ab42 inhibits the JAK2/
STAT5 pathway. There is evidence that extracellular Ab
is internalized by glial cells via phagocytosis, pinocytosis,
and endocytosis [39,40]. Neurons uptake Ab from the
extracellular milieu as well and this contributes to the
accumulation of intraneuronal Ab [41]. Intraneuronal
accumulation of Ab has been implicated in loss of
synaptic plasticity and shown to adversely affect neuronal function and survival [42-44]. Furthermore, it has
been demonstrated that intraneuronal Ab causes

memory impairment by attenuating JAK-STAT signaling
in hippocampal neurons [45]. IGF-1 expression in the
peripheral system is regulated by the transcription factor
STAT5 [10,11,46]. The functional long-form of leptin
receptor (Ob-Rb) is coupled to the JAK2/STAT5 pathway and is highly expressed in the hippocampus [47,48].
Leptin phosphorylates Ob-Rb at Tyr1138 upon binding
and activates the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway [49]. Leptin binding to Ob-Rb has been shown to
activate STAT5 via JAK2 [50-52]. We demonstrate in
this study that Ab42 induces a decrease in p-Tyr1007/1008
JAK2 and p-Tyr694 STAT5 levels, consequently reducing
the nuclear translocation of STAT5 and mitigating
JAK2/STAT5 signaling. On the other hand, treatment
with leptin elicited a significant increase in JAK2/
STAT5 activation and reversed the effects of Ab42 on
JAK2/STAT5 signaling, as shown with increased translocation of STAT5 to the nucleus. To determine the
extent to which STAT5 mediates leptin effects, we treated organotypic slices with a specific inhibitor of STAT5
in the presence and absence of leptin. We found that

Figure 6 Ab42 inhibits mTORC1 and treatment with IGF-1 alleviates the mTORC1 inhibition. (a) Representative Western blot and (b)
densitometric analysis demonstrate that treatment of organotypic slices with Ab42 for 72 hours significantly attenuates the phosphorylation of
mTOR. IGF-1 treatment increases the phosphorylation of mTOR by 2 fold and reverses the reduction conferred by Ab42 on mTOR
phosphorylation. (c,d) Treatment of organotypic slices with Ab42 significantly attenuates the phosphorylation of p70S6K1, the downstream
substrate and indicator of mTORC1 activation. IGF-1 treatment increases phosphorylation of p70S6K1 by 1.7 fold and reverses the reduction
induced by Ab42 on p70S6K1 phosphorylation. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 versus control; † † p < 0.01 and † † † p < 0.001 versus Ab42.

STAT5 inhibition markedly reduced IGF-1 expression.
As this attenuation of IGF-1 expression by STAT5 inhibition was not alleviated by leptin, such a result suggests
that STAT5 is required for leptin-induced increase in
IGF-1 expression. We further studied the IGF-1 promoter using EMSA and ChIP analyses to determine the
effects of Ab42 and leptin treatments on IGF-1 transcription and delineate the role of STAT5. We found
that Ab42 reduces the binding of STAT5 in the IGF-1
promoter region. In contrast, both EMSA and ChIP analyses showed that leptin treatment increases STAT5
binding to the IGF-1 promoter region and reverses the
attenuating effects of Ab42 on STAT5 binding in the
IGF-1 promoter region. Our data strongly suggest that
STAT5 plays an important role in leptin-induced
increase in IGF-1 expression.
The findings that Ab42 reduces IGF-1 expression in
the brain and leptin increases the basal levels of this neurotrophic factor and reverses the Ab-induced decrease in
IGF-1 may be of relevance to AD as IGF-1 exhibits neurotrophic, neuromodulatory, neuroendocrine, and metabolic actions in the brain [53]. IGF-1 reduces amyloid
burden by increasing its clearance through Ab carrier
proteins like albumin and transthyretin [1]. IGF-1 effects

are transduced via the cell surface IGF-1 receptors
(IGF1R) belonging to the tyrosine kinase receptor family
[54,55]. The IGF1R are coupled to the PI3K/Akt/
mTORC1 pathway [56]. IGF-1 signaling through IGF-1
receptors has been demonstrated to induce the activation
of IRS1/PI3K/AkT/mTORC1 pathway and inhibit GSK3b, thus attenuating tau phosphorylation in NT2N cells
[57] and in primary rat cortical neurons [58]. IGF-1 precludes the b-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons [59,60] by the activation of PI3K/Akt/
mTORC1 pathway [56]. Consistent with this observation,
Ab has been shown to uncouple PI3K/Akt/mTORC1
pathway [61-63]. Furthermore Ab42 downregulates
mTORC1 signaling in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and
mTORC1 signaling is attenuated in APP/PS1 mice model
of AD [64].
We have demonstrated that leptin decreases both
basal and Ab42-induced increase in levels of phosphorylated tau [15]. This study shows that leptin treatment
increases IGF-1 expression. We have previously shown
that leptin reduces the oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterolinduced increase in Ab and phosphorylated tau levels
[14]. Several studies have reported the pivotal role of
leptin in reducing Ab production and load [16-18] as

well as tau phosphorylation [65,66]. It is thus conceivable that leptin may, in part, reduce tau phosphorylation
by increasing the expression of IGF-1.
Our results demonstrating that IGF-1 regulates leptin
suggest that IGF-1 and leptin mutually regulate the
expression of each other. We have demonstrated previously that mTORC1 activation is necessary for leptin
expression and that the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin
inhibits leptin expression levels [15]. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that Ab42 inhibits mTORC1 activation
and inhibits leptin expression [15]. It is well known that
IGF-1 activates the mTORC1 signaling via the Akt signaling pathway [23,24,32]. We speculated that IGF-1
may regulate leptin expression through mTORC1 activation and may potentially reverse the deleterious effects
of Ab42 on leptin expression. To this end, we treated
organotypic slices with IGF-1 in presence or absence of
the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. We found that IGF-1
activates mTORC1 signaling and increases leptin protein
and mRNA expression levels. However, in the presence
of rapamycin, IGF-1 failed to exert any effect on leptin
expression, suggesting that IGF-1 regulates leptin

expression via the activation of mTORC1. To determine
the effects of IGF-1 treatment on Ab42-induced downregulation of leptin expression, we incubated organotypic slices with IGF-1 and Ab42. We found that IGF-1
alleviates the reduction induced by Ab42 on leptin protein and mRNA expression levels.
Rapamycin is an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1 that
subsequently inhibits translation of proteins that are regulated by mTORC1, including leptin. Although, it is the
consensus that rapamycin is a selective inhibitor of
mTORC1, recent studies have suggested that under certain conditions, prolonged rapamycin treatment may also
inhibit mTORC2 complex [67-69]. mTORC2 was identified as the kinase that activates Akt by phosphorylation at
Ser473 [70]. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Akt
activates mTORC1 [71,72]. The fact that mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at Ser 473 , and given that Akt activates
mTORC1 signaling, indicates that mTORC2 positively
regulates mTORC1 signaling. Therefore, inhibition of
mTORC2 by rapamycin would result in further indirect
inhibition of mTORC1, in addition to the direct allosteric
inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin [68]. Our results

Figure 8 Ab42 reduces levels of the transcription factor C-EBPa and IGF-1 reverses the reduction in levels of C-EBPa. (a,b) Treatment of
organotypic slices with Ab42 for 72 hours significantly decreases expression levels of the transcription factor C-EBPa in the cytosolic fraction. IGF1 treatment increases basal levels of C-EBPa in the cytosol by ~1.6 fold and restores Ab42-induced reduction in C-EBPa levels. (c,d) Treatment
with Ab42 for 72 hours significantly decreases levels of the C-EBPa in the nuclear fractions, suggesting that Ab42 reduces the activation and
nuclear translocation of C-EBPa. IGF-1 treatment increases the nuclear translocation of C-EBPa by ~1.8 fold and reverses the attenuation induced
by Ab42 of nuclear levels of C-EBPa. (e) ChIP analysis demonstrates that treatment with IGF-1 results in an about 3.5-fold increase in C-EBPa
binding to the leptin promoter region. Ab42 treatment results in a pronounced attenuation of C-EBPa binding to the leptin promoter region.
Concomitant treatment with IGF-1 completely reverses the effects of Ab42 on C-EBPa binding to the leptin promoter and produces a 3-fold
increase in binding compared to control. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 versus control; † p < 0.05, † †p < 0.01, and † †† p < 0.001 versus

Figure 9 IGF-1 fails to regulate C-EBPa expression levels in presence of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. Western blot and
densitometric analyses show that treatment of organotypic slices with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin for 72 hours significantly decreases
expression levels of the transcription factor C-EBPa in the cytosol (a,b) and in the nuclear fractions (c,d). IGF-1 treatment does not affect the
reduction in cytosolic and nuclear levels of C-EBPa induced by rapamycin, suggesting that the upregulation of the transcription factor C-EBPa is
mediated via mTORC1. **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 versus control.

showing that rapamycin also decreases the leptin mRNA
levels suggest that mTORC1 is also involved in leptin transcription. To elucidate the role of mTORC1 in the regulation of leptin transcription, we determined the effects of
rapamycin on the transcription factors involved in leptin
expression. Evidence suggests that the transcription factor
C-EBPa plays an indispensable role in leptin expression in
the peripheral adipose tissue [35-38]. There are also multiple studies demonstrating the critical role of mTORC1 in
the translation of C-EBPa [34]. We found that rapamycin
decreases protein levels of C-EBPa in the cytosol as well
as in the nucleus. We also determined the involvement of
C-EBPa in the Ab42-induced reduction and IGF-1induced increase in leptin expression as both Ab42 and
IGF-1 regulate mTORC1 activation and signaling. Western blotting clearly showed that Ab42 decreases C-EBPa
protein levels, while IGF-1 treatment increases the basal
levels of C-EBPa and reverses the Ab42-induced reduction
in C-EBPa protein levels. Additionally, ChIP analysis
showed that Ab42 treatment reduces the binding of CEBPa to the leptin promoter, while treatment with IGF-1
induces an increase in C-EBPa to the leptin promoter.

Conclusion
Our study is the first to demonstrate that IGF-1 and leptin mutually regulate and reinforce the expression of

each other in the hippocampus, while Ab attenuates the
expression of both IGF-1 and leptin. Leptin increases the
basal expression levels of IGF-1 and reverses the Ab42induced decrease in IGF-1 levels. Similarly, IGF-1 also
increases basal expression and reverses Ab42-induced
decrease in leptin levels. The overall findings and signal
transduction mechanisms involved are summarized in
Figure 10. Our results are of high importance to AD studies as leptin and IGF-1 exert neuroprotective effects by
reducing the accumulation of Ab and phosphorylated
tau. Understanding the cellular mechanisms involved in
the regulation of leptin and IGF-1 expression levels is
paramount for the search of agents that protect against
AD by reducing Ab accumulation and subsequent deleterious effects.

Figure 10 Schematic representation of the interplay between leptin, IGF-1 and Ab42. Leptin activates JAK2/STAT5 pathway (1), resulting in
increased levels of p-Tyr694 STAT5 in the cytosol (2) and its translocation into the nucleus (3). Increased levels of p-Tyr694 STAT5 in the nucleus
leads to increased expression of IGF-1 (4), which through an effect on IGF-1R (5), activates the Akt/mTORC1 pathway (6). Activation of mTORC1
results in the increased expression levels of the transcription factor C-EBPa (7) and its translocation to the nucleus (8). Increased nuclear levels of
C-EBPa result in its increased binding to the leptin promoter and augmentation in leptin expression (9). Ab42 inhibits the activation of the JAK2/
STAT5 pathway (10) and attenuates the levels of p-Tyr694 STAT5 in the cytosol and the nucleus (11), resulting in reduced IGF-1 expression. Ab42
also decreases mTORC1 activation and signaling (12) leading to reduction in C-EBPa levels in the cytosol and nucleus (13), effects that reduce
leptin expression.

and 0.05 μM/ml streptomycin) were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All other supplies for
the culture of organotypic slices (Neurobasal medium,
B27, horse serum, and glutamine) were purchased from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
Organotypic slice preparation and treatment

We chose to use the organotypic slice system for our studies. The organotypic slice system has many advantages
in that connectivity between neurons, interneurons and
glia is maintained. In addition, we prepared organotypic

slices from hippocampus of adult rabbits (2 year-old), a
brain region and age that are relevant to the pathophysiology of AD. Additionally, rabbits have a phylogeny closer to humans than rodents [73], and their Ab sequence,
unlike that of rodents, is similar to the Ab sequence of
the human [74]. Organotypic hippocampal slices were
prepared as we have previously shown [14,15] and as follows. Hippocampi from adult male rabbits (n = 6) were
dissected, trimmed of excess white matter and placed
into chilled dissection media composed of hibernate A
containing 20% horse serum and 0.5 mM l-glutamine.

Marwarha et al. Molecular Neurodegeneration 2011, 6:41

Isolated tissue was placed on a wetted filter paper on the
Teflon stage of a MacIlwain chopper for coronal sectioning (300 μm thick). From each rabbit hippocampi, about
50 sections were cut (100 sections per rabbit). Sections
were placed in new dissection media and allowed to rest
five minutes on ice before separating and plating on
membrane inserts. Five sections were placed on each
insert with a total of 10 inserts per hippocampus (20
inserts per rabbit). Inserts were placed in 35 mm culture
dishes containing 1.1 ml growth media (Neurobasal A
with 20% horse serum, 0.5 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 0.05 μM/ml streptomycin), and warmed
30 min prior to plating to ensure complete equilibration.
Slices were exposed to a humidified incubator atmosphere (4.5% CO2 and 35°C). Media was changed at 24 h
and, at day 4, slices were switched to a defined medium
consisting of Neurobasal A, 2% B27 supplement and
0.5 mM l-glutamine. At day 10, organotypic slices from
each rabbit were divided into the following treatment
groups: (1) vehicle, (2) 125 nM leptin, (3) 80 nM IGF-1,
(4) 10 μM Ab42, (5) 125 nM leptin + 10 μM Ab42, (6) 80
nM IGF-1 + 10 μM Ab42, (7) 100 nM rapamycin, (8)
100 nM rapamycin + 80 nM IGF-1, (9) 100 μM STAT5
inhibitor, and (10) 100 μM STAT5 inhibitor + 125 nM
leptin. A stock solution of leptin of 62.5 μM (1 mg/ml)
was prepared in sterile distilled water and diluted in
media at 1:500 to a concentration of 125 nM (2 μg/ml).
IGF-1 was procured as a 100 μg lyophilized powder, was
dissolved in 1.11 ml sterile distilled water to yield a
12 μM (90 μg/ml) stock solution. The IGF-1 stock solution was further diluted in media at 1:150 to a concentration of 80 nM (600 ng/ml). Ab42 peptide was dissolved
in sterile distilled water to yield a 250 μM (1 mg/ml)
stock solution and diluted in media at 1:25 to a final concentration of 10 μM (40 μg/ml). Rapamycin was purchased as a 2.5 mg/ml (2.74 mM) stock solution in
DMSO and was diluted in media at 1:274 to yield a working stock solution of 10 μM. The rapamycin solution was
further diluted at 1:100 in media to yield a final concentration of 100 nM. Each treatment was delivered into the
media of 2 inserts with 5 sections from each of the 6 rabbits. Sections were harvested after 72 h of treatment. The
chosen concentrations of leptin (125 nM), Ab42 (10 μM),
and rapamycin (100 nM) were based on our previously
published study [15]. The concentration of leptin selected
(125 nM) was based on a dose response assay conducted
to determine the minimum concentration of leptin that
induces phosphorylation of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb)
at Tyr1138 in our organotypic slice paradigm [15]. Other
studies have employed 100 nM leptin in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells [16] and primary neuronal cultures
[65,66]. The rapamycin concentration (100 nM) used was
the empirically determined minimum concentration that
inhibits mTORC1 activation in our paradigm [15].

Page 13 of 18

Several other studies have utilized up to 1 μM rapamycin
to inhibit mTORC1 activation and signaling in SH-SY5Y
neuroblastoma cells [64,75]. The IGF-1 concentration
used (80 nM) was empirically determined by a dose
response assay with the concentration chosen depicting
the minimum concentration that evokes IGF-1 receptor
(IGF1R) phosphorylation at Tyr1135/1136 residues in our
organotypic slice paradigm. All animal procedures were
carried out in accordance with the U.S. Public Health
Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of North
Dakota.
Immunoprecipitation

Immunoprecipitation from tissue homogenate was performed for IGF-1 by using “Catch and Release” immunoprecipitation kit from Millipore (Bedford, MA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, organotypic slices
were homogenized in T-PER tissue protein extraction
reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Tissue homogenate containing the equivalent to 500 μg of total protein
content was incubated with 2 μg of the anti-IGF-1 goat
antibody (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight in the
spin columns followed by elution using the denatured elution buffer containing 5% b-mercaptoethanol. 5 μL of the
eluate was resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel followed by transfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioRad,
Hercules, CA) and incubation with IGF-1 antibody followed by development with enhanced chemiluminescence
(Immun-star HRP chemiluminescent kit, Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA). Bands were visualized on a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane and analyzed by LabWorks 4.5 software on a UVP Bioimaging System (Upland, CA). Quantification of results was performed by densitometry and the
results analyzed as total integrated densitometric values
(arbitrary units). Rabbit liver tissue homogenate was used
as a positive control, while the eluate from the column
that did not contain the IGF-1 primary antibody as well as
the column that was devoid of the tissue homogenate
were used as the negative controls.
Western blot analysis

Organotypic slices were homogenized in NE-PER tissue
protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations from the cytosolic and
nuclear homogenates were determined with BCA protein assay. Proteins (10 μg) were separated in SDSPAGE gels followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and incubation with the following monoclonal antibodies: antiJAK2 rabbit antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Boston,

antibody (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), antiphospho (Tyr694) STAT5 mouse antibody (1:200; Cell
Signaling, Boston, MA), anti-IGF1 goat antibody (1:500;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti C-EBPa rabbit antibody
(Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). b-actin and lamin A were
used as a gel loading control for cytosolic homogenates
and nuclear homogenates respectively. The blots were
developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Immunstar HRP chemiluminescent kit, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Bands were visualized on a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane and analyzed by LabWorks 4.5 software on a
UVP Bioimaging System (Upland, CA). Quantification
of results was performed by densitometry and the
results analyzed as total integrated densitometric values
(arbitrary units).

IL) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations from tissue homogenates
were determined with BCA protein assay. The tissue
homogenates belonging to different treatments were
further diluted in PBS to yield a protein concentration
of 1 mg/ml. 1 μL of the tissue homogenate from each
treatment group normalized to 1 mg/ml protein concentration was further diluted 1:100 in the assay diluent
buffer provided with the kit. A total of 100 μL of this
diluted homogenate was added to each well of the
ELISA plate for the assay. The optical density of each
well was determined using a microplate reader set at
450 nm. The concentrations obtained were multiplied
by a factor of 100 to account for the 100-fold dilution.
The leptin levels were measured in triplicate for each
treatment in each of the 6 rabbits. The final results are
expressed as ng of leptin/ml of tissue homogenate.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Quantitative Real time RT-PCR analysis

IGF-1 levels were quantified in the organotypic slices
using a quantitative sandwich ELISA kit (R & D systems,
Minneapolis, MN) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Organotypic slices were homogenized in T-PER tissue
protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations from tissue homogenates
were determined with BCA protein assay. The tissue
homogenates belonging to different treatments were
further diluted in PBS to yield a protein concentration
of 1 mg/ml. 20 μL of the tissue homogenate from each
treatment group normalized to 1 mg/ml protein concentration was diluted 1:20 and then further 1:5 in the special buffers provided with the kit to release any IGF-1
that is bound to IGFBP’s (IGF-1 binding proteins). A
total of 50 μL of this 100-fold diluted homogenate was
added to each well of the ELISA plate for the assay. The
entire procedure for the assay was performed at 4°C.
The optical density of each well was determined using a
microplate reader set at 450 nm. The optical density of
each well was also determined at 540 nm. The optical
density values read at 540 nm were subtracted from the
optical density values at 450 nm for each well to
account for any optical imperfections of the ELISA plate
in accordance with manufacturer’s protocol. The concentrations obtained were multiplied by a factor of 100
to account for the 100-fold dilution. The IGF-1 levels
were measured in triplicate for each treatment in each
of the 6 rabbits. The final results are expressed as ng of
IGF-1/ml of tissue homogenate.
Leptin levels were quantified in the organotypic slices
using a quantitative sandwich ELISA kit (R & D systems,
Minneapolis, MN) as per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Organotypic slices were homogenized in T-PER tissue
protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,

Total RNA was isolated and extracted from organotypic
slices using the 5 prime “PerfectPure RNA tissue kit” (5
Prime, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). RNA estimation was
performed using “Quant-iT RNA Assay Kit” using a
Qubit fluorometer according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was obtained by
reverse transcribing 1 μg of extracted RNA using an
iScript cDNA synthesis kit” (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The
oligomeric primers (Sigma, St Louis, MO) used to
amplify the leptin mRNA and IGF-1 mRNA in the hippocampal organotypic slices are enumerated in Table 1.
The cDNA amplification was performed using an iQ
SYBR Green Supermix kit following the manufacturer’s
instructions (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The amplification
was performed using an iCycler iQ Multicolor Real
Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
The expression of specific leptin and IGF-1 transcripts
amplified were normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)

The Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) to
study the STAT5-IGF-1 promoter interaction was performed using a kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA)
following manufacturer’s protocol. Nuclear extract was
prepared using NE-PER protein extraction reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). The human IGF-1 promoter contains
two STAT5 binding consensus sequences and these are
evolutionary conserved across all mammalian species
[30]. The rabbit IGF-1 promoter region spanning 8000
nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site
in IGF-1 gene was scanned for STAT5 binding consensus sequences using the “TFsearch” online program that
searches highly correlated sequence fragments against

database in ‘TRANSFAC’ databases [76,77]. The 5’-biotin labeled and unlabeled oligonucleotide probes that
correspond to the STAT5 binding site in the IGF-1 promoter region (Table 1) were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (St Louis, MO). 10 μg of hippocampal nuclear
proteins were incubated with either 20 femto moles of
biotin labeled oligonucleotide probe or 4 pico moles of
unlabelled oligonucleotide. To exhibit specificity of the
oligonucleotide probes, unlabelled oligonucleotide probe
was used as a specific competitor for binding reactions
at a concentration of 200 fold of the concentration of
the biotin labeled probe. 1 μg of Poly d(I-C) was used as
a non-specific competitor for binding reactions. The
resulting binding reaction mix was loaded and resolved
on a 5% TBE gel (BioRad, Hercules, CA) followed by
transfer onto a nylon membrane. The bands were visualized using the HRP-Streptavidin - Chemiluminescent
reaction mix provided with the kit on a UVP Bioimaging
System (Upland, CA).
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis

ChIP analysis was performed to evaluate the extent of
STAT5 and C-EBPa binding to the DNA elements in the
IGF-1 promoter and leptin promoter regions respectively
using “SimpleChIPTM Enzymatic Chromatic IP kit” from
Cell Signaling (Boston, MA). Briefly, organotypic slices
from each treatment group (~100 mg) were taken and
cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min followed
by the addition of 500 μL of 1.25M glycine solution to
cease the cross-linking reaction. The tissue was washed
with 4x volumes of 1x PBS and centrifuged at ~220g for
5 min. The pellet was resuspended and incubated for 10
min in 5 ml of tissue lysis buffer containing DTT,

protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The subsequent
steps to isolate the cross-linked chromatin were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. One
third of the cross-linked chromatin from each sample
was set aside as “input” and the rest was subjected to
immunoprecipitation. One third of the cross-linked chromatin from each sample was incubated with 5 μg of antiphospho (Tyr694) STAT5 mouse antibody (Cell Signaling,
Boston, MA) or with 5 μg of anti-C-EBPa mouse antibody (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA). One third of the
cross-linked chromatin was also incubated with 5 μg of
normal Rabbit IgG to serve as negative control. The
DNA-protein complexes were collected with Protein G
agarose beads and reverse cross-linked by incubation
Proteinase K for 2 hours at 65°C followed by elution and
purification. The relative abundance of STAT5 binding
element in the STAT5 antibody precipitated chromatin
and C/EBPa binding element in the C-EBPa antibody
precipitated chromatin was determined by qPCR using
an iQ SYBR Green Supermix kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and sequence
specific primers (Table 1). The amplification was performed using an iCycler iQ Multicolor Real Time PCR
Detection System (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The fold
enrichment of the STAT5 binding element and C-EBPa
binding element was calculated using the ΔΔCt method
[78] which normalizes ChIP Ct values of each sample to
the % input and background.
Statistical analysis

The significance of differences among the samples was
assessed by One Way Analysis of Variance (One Way
ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. Statistical
analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software
