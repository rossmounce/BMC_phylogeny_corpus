Multiple endosymbionts in populations of the
ant Formica cinerea
Anu Sirviö1*, Pekka Pamilo1,2

Abstract
Background: Many insects, including ants, are infected by maternally inherited Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria
though other secondary endosymbionts have not been reported in ants. It has been suggested that the ability of
Wolbachia to invade and remain in an ant population depends on the number of coexisting queens in a colony.
We study the genetic and social structure of populations in the ant Formica cinerea which is known to have
populations with either monogynous or polygynous colonies. We screen populations for several endosymbiotic
bacteria to evaluate the presence of different endosymbionts, possible association between their prevalence and
the social structure, and the association between endosymbiont prevalence and genetic differentiation of ant
populations.
Results: We found three endosymbiotic bacteria; 19% of the nests were infected by Wolbachia, 3.8% by Cardinium
and 33% by Serratia. There was significant variation among the populations regarding the proportion of nests
infected by Serratia, Wolbachia and the pooled set of all the endosymbionts. Some individuals and colonies carried
two of the bacteria, the frequency of double infections agreeing with the random expectation. The proportion of
infected ants (individuals or colonies) did not correlate significantly with the population level relatedness values.
The difference in the prevalence of Wolbachia between population pairs correlated significantly with the genetic
distance (microsatellites) of the populations.
Conclusions: The discovery of several endosymbionts and co-infections by Wolbachia and Cardinium demonstrate
the importance of screening several endosymbionts when evaluating their possible effects on social life and
queen-worker conflicts over sex allocation. The low prevalence of Wolbachia in F. cinerea departs from the pattern
observed in many other Formica ants in which all workers have been infected. It is likely that the strain of
Wolbachia in F. cinerea differs from those in other Formica species. The correlation between the difference in
Wolbachia prevalence and the pair-wise genetic distance of populations suggests that spreading of the bacteria is
restricted by the isolation of the host populations.

Background
Insects carry several endosymbiotic bacteria which can
affect the life of their hosts [1]. Primary (or obligate)
endosymbionts are usually mutualistic, host-specific and
are restricted to vertical transmission in the maternal line
and have long-term coevolution with their host. These
include Buchnera in aphids, Blochmannia in Camponotus
carpenter ants, Wigglesworthia glossinidium in tsetse flies
and Baumannia cicadellinicola in leafhoppers [2]. Secondary (or facultative) endosymbionts can be either

parasitic or mutualistic, they are found in a variety of
host taxa, and are characterised by obvious horizontal
transmission. Screening of secondary endosymbionts in
insects is often restricted to Wolbachia which is inherited
vertically from mother to offspring and can manipulate
the reproduction of the host in ways that increase the
number of female offspring [3]. Other secondary endosymbionts, including Rickettsia, Spiroplasma and
Cardinium have been found in various groups of arthropods and they are also characterized by vertical transmission and reproductive manipulation [1]. They have been
shown to induce cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis, feminisation of male embryos and male killing
[2,4]. In addition to the manipulation of reproduction,

some of the secondary endosymbionts can give direct
benefits to the host by delivering nutrients, by giving
defence against natural enemies, by improving thermal
tolerance, by enhancing fecundity and by inducing variation in breeding behaviour of the host [2,5]. Such features
have raised questions about the role of endosymbiotic
bacteria in inducing and controlling various phenotypic
features of their arthropod hosts.
Reproductive manipulation by endosymbionts can be
particularly important in the evolution of social Hymenoptera (ants, social bees and wasps) as it interferes
with the sex ratio conflict between queens and workers
[3,6,7]. Queens have commonly equal interest in the
production of both sexes but workers can manipulate
the sex ratio by preferentially caring either male or
female larvae according to the relatedness asymmetry. If
relatedness between nest mates is high workers favor
the survival of females and when it is low they may care
more male offspring. Workers of many social insect species do not reproduce, and if they do, they produce haploid males and thus prevent vertical transmission of
endosymbionts. Yet, workers are numerous and form an
important source for horizontal transmission. Mutualistic endosymbionts can also enhance the evolution of
social behaviour and group living by forcing individuals
to interact in order to obtain or receive benefits delivered by beneficial bacteria [see [8]].
Cytoplasmic incompatibility appears to be the most
widespread Wolbachia-induced manipulation in insects
and causes a serious load on the host population when
the prevalence is close to 50% and incompatible matings
are common. Selection is therefore expected to drive the
prevalence towards zero or 100% [9]. In social insects
colonies with many reproductive queens (polygynous
colonies), the cost of incompatible mating can be
reduced if other queens in the colony have compatible
mating and produce a healthy colony. Based on this
argument, it has been suggested that ants with polygynous colonies may have an intermediate prevalence of
Wolbacia infection, whereas ants with monogynous
colonies suffer from incompatible mating and should
either lack infection or be all infected [10,11]. It should,
however, be pointed out that the influence of Wolbachia
on ant hosts has not been confirmed yet. Few laboratory
and molecular studies have been done, without clear
results despite widespread occurrence of different
Wolbachia strains in various ant species [12]. So far, the
studies have largely focused on the prevalence and
patterns of transmission [13-16]. There are very few studies that have examined infection of social insects by
bacteria other than Wolbachia [3,17,18] or the overall
diversity of microorganisms in ants [19,20].
Because of the potential importance of endosymbiotic
bacteria in social insect biology, we aimed to study the

prevalence of several host-manipulating endosymbionts
in the ant Formica cinerea, known also as the velvet or
silky ant. The species inhabits open sandy areas and is
distributed from South Western Asia to Central Europe,
with local and seemingly isolated populations in northern Europe. Even though isolated on the map, the
North-European populations have been found to be
genetically relatively homogeneous with no obvious
long-term isolation [21]. Formica cinerea is on a short
list of ant species in which the social organisation of
colonies varies among populations in such a way that
colonies in some populations normally have a single
queen (monogynous type) while they have multiple
queens (polygynous type) in other populations [21,22].
This allows testing the hypotheses relating the prevalence of endosymbionts to the colonial type. Our study
included ten populations in one geographical area (at
most 50 km distance between populations) and we characterised the social type of colonies and inferred the
gene flow between populations by using genetic markers
(nuclear and mitochondrial), and screened the occurrence of several endosymbionts. Major questions we
aimed to answer were: 1) Are there multiple endosymbionts in F. cinerea and do the endosymbionts compete
with each other or do multiple infections occur frequently? 2) Is the prevalence of endosymbionts associated with the social type of colonies and is there any
association between the prevalence of endosymbionts
and the genetic distance between pairs of populations?
Furthermore, we tested whether the social type influences gene flow in the ants as observed in other socially
polymorphic ants [23]. We found three endosymbiotic
bacteria (Candidatus Cardinium, Candidatus Serratia
symbiotica and Wolbachia) infecting F. cinerea. This is
the first study reporting potentially manipulative endosymbionts other than Wolbachia in ants.

Results
Genetic structure of the ant populations

The total number of alleles per microsatellite locus
varied between 8 (FL20) and 12 (Fe16) across all the
populations, and single populations had from 3 to 9
alleles per locus. The overall inbreeding coefficient was
significantly positive in population 5 (Koppana sand pit,
F = 0.16 with 95% CI 0.06 - 0.27) (Table 1). The statistical tests are problematic because related individuals are
not independent of each other, but there was no clear
tendency for any specific locus to show departures from
the expected Hardy-Weinberg frequencies.
Mean genetic relatedness (r) of colonial nest-mates
within populations varied from 0.04 to 0.59 (Table 1)
indicating different social forms in the populations. The
relatedness estimates divided the populations in two
groups (Table 1). The relatedness estimates in Tauvo (r

Nn and Nall refer to the number of nests and microsatellite alleles. Five worker ants were screened from each nest. Hexp = expected heterozygosity, r =
relatedness and F = inbreeding coefficient. The standard error of relatedness was obtained by jackknifing over the nests. Number of infected nests is given for
each bacterium (Serr, Wolb, Card) and for double infections (SW, SC and WC).

= 0.04) and Koppana beach (r = 0.12) were significantly
smaller than in the other six populations (in which r ≥
0.40), whereas there were no significant relatedness differences among the populations within the two groups
(pair-wise comparisons with t-test). The level of polygyny in the Koppana sand pit population was unclear as
the estimate of relatedness was r = 0.40 but there was
also an excess of homozygotes, and the inbreedingadjusted relatedness [24] was r* = 0.17. The high initial
relatedness, however, indicates that the nests were
genetically separate and did not form colonial networks
exchanging workers.
Colonies within populations had a wide range of relatedness values, but it should be noted that such individual estimates have a large sampling variance. The two
populations with low average worker relatedness had
10% of nests (3 out 32) with relatedness r > 0.3. Likewise, the six populations with a high average relatedness
had 10% of nests (8 out of 82) with relatedness r < 0.11.
The pair-wise estimates of F ST ranged from 0.01 to
0.17 (Table 2). Populations 1, 3, 4 and 5 did not differ
significantly from each other (permutation test, P >
0.05), but the other populations showed significant differences (FST larger than obtained by permutation of the

nests) to any other population. The population on the
island of Hailuoto (7, Mäntyniemi) was the most differentiated population (Table 2, Additional File 1). The
correlation between the genetic distance and the geographical distance was not significant (rm = 0.20, P = 0.25,
Mantel’s test). Notably, the two closely located Koppana
populations (2 and 5) that were separated by only 1.5
km differed significantly from each other with F ST =
0.05.
The mitochondrial sequences revealed five haplotypes
A-E (Additional file 2) [GenBank: haplotype A:
GU592755, B: GU592752, C: GU592754, D: GU592751
and E: GU592753]. Haplotype E was prevailing and
included most samples from all the populations. Haplotype A was found in four individuals from two colonies
of population 4 (Jääli) and had a single transition in the
tRNA-Ser part of the amplified region. Haplotypes B
and C had single nucleotide changes, both leading to an
amino acid change (I to V and L to I). Haplotype B was
detected in individuals from four colonies of population
5 (Koppana sand pit). Haplotype C occurred in two
populations, in individuals from four colonies of population 1 (Juurussuo) and from three colonies of population
4 (Jääli). Haplotype D could be derived from the haplotype C by a synonymous transition and was observed in
only a single colony in population 3 (Haukipudas). In
the populations that had two haplotypes, only one haplotype was found in each nest.
Wolbachia

No amplification was initially detected when the
wsp-primer pair was used for all 656 F. cinerea individuals, while positive controls (F. aquilonia, F. rufa,
F. polyctena, F. lugubris, F. paralugubris, F. lemani) produced a strong band that was confirmed to belong to
Wolbachia by sequencing. Different concentrations
(20-60 ng/ul) of genomic template were tested for a

subset of samples, as well as different annealing temperatures (50-60°C) and several MgCl2 concentrations
(1-3 mM) but PCR produced either almost invisibly
faint bands that had a correct fragment size or mostly
no bands at all for F. cinerea wsp. When hemi-nested
PCR with several bacteria-specific primer pairs was used
to amplify 16SrDNA, we successfully amplified Wolbachia, Serratia and Cardinium from F. cinerea. The other
bacteria (Ricketsia, Spiroplasma, Buchnera) were not
detected.
Wolbachia was found in eight out of ten populations
and the proportion of infected individuals in those ranged from 1.2% (population 5) to 33% (population 7)
(Table 1, Figure 1). In total, 5.6% of the individuals and
19% of the nests were infected by Wolbachia. Some

singleton sites of the obtained sequence (896 bp) can
represent PCR errors, but there were 49 parsimony
informative sites. Among the haplotypes, four from
Liminka (population 6) differed from all the others at
21-27 sites (mean difference p = 0.025). Among the
other haplotypes, the largest number of pair-wise
nucleotide differences was 13 (p = 0.014) and the largest
differences were between sequences from Haukipudas
(population 3) and the island of Hailuoto (populations
7, 10). In a neighbour-joining tree, the sequences from
these two areas tended to form groups of their own,
otherwise there were no clear geographical groupings
(Additional file 3). A BLAST search showed that the
majority of Wolbachia sequences of the 16SrDNA from
F. cinerea [GenBank GU592769-GU592781] were 98-

99% similar to Wolbachia-like uncultured bacterial
clones from the ant lion Myrmeleon mobilis, fly Cacoxenus indagator, and giant scale insect Drosicha pinicola
as well as to Wolbachia from several Drosophila species
and Diabroticite beetles (Additional files 3, 4 and 5).
In order to compare the Wolbachia in F. cinerea with
the strains found earlier in other Formica ants, we
sequenced bacteria from several Formica species
(F. aquilonia: Finland, F. polyctena: Russia and Sweden,
F. lugubris: France, F. rufa: Russia) that were known to
carry different wFex-strains of Wolbachia determined by
the wsp sequences [[15] and our unpublished sequences
for F. aquilonia]. The 16SrDNA sequences obtained
from these hosts were either identical to one of the
sequences found in the major group from F. cinerea or
differed by only one nucleotide (see Additional file 5).
[GenBank:F. rufa GU592782, F. aquilonia GU592783GU592785, F. lugubris GU592786, F. polyctena
GU592787-GU592788, F. lugubris GU592789]. The
deviating sequences from the Liminka population of
F. cinerea fell outside this group.
Cardinium

Cardinium was present in seven individuals that came
from four populations (1, 2, 5 and 10), and the proportion of infected individuals ranged from 1.3% (population 5) to 5% (population 10) (Table 1, Figure 1). In
total, only 1.1% of the individuals and 3.8% of the nests
were infected. The sequences (450 bp) had 11
parsimony informative sites [GenBank GU592742GU592750]. The neighbour-joining tree of the haplotypes showed no clear geographical pattern.
The maximum number of pair-wise nucleotide differences was ten (p = 0.022, total length 450 bp). The parsimony informative sites separated three haplotypes in
the Juurussuo population (population 1) from the others
by five specific differences. The main group of
sequences was 98-99% similar to Cardinium sequences
obtained earlier from several species of Brevipalpus
mites, Metaseiulus occidentalis, leafhopper Scaphoideus
titanus and spider mite Oligonychus ilicis (Figure 2,
Additional file 6).
Serratia

Sequences produced by the PASS primers [GenBank
GU592756-GU592768] gave 98% similarities with symbiont S from Acyrthosiphon pea aphid (M27040), secondary symbiont type-R of Aphis craccivora (AY822593,
AY822592, AY822591, AY822594), secondary symbiont
of Acyrthosiphon pisum (AB033777, AB033778), and
Candidatus Serratia symbiotica (AF293617, AY296732)
(see Additonal file 7). Thus our sequences could be considered to belong to the recently named new species
Candidatus Serratia symbiotica (formerly known as
PASS or R-type secondary symbiont of aphids) [25]. Serratia was found in all populations except Liminka

(population 6). Not all the nests in the infected populations had Serratia, and the proportion of infected individuals within populations ranged from 2% (population 3,
Haukipudas) to 43% (population 5, Koppana sand pit)
(Table 1, Figure 1), and a total of 13.2% of all the F.
cinerea individuals and 33% of the nests were infected.
The sequence (471 bp) had 19 parsimony informative
sites. The largest pair-wise difference was 7 nucleotides
(p = 0.014), and the neighbour-joining tree showed no
clear geographical clustering of the haplotypes (Additional file 8).
Connections with the genetic structure of the ant
populations and multiple infections

There was significant variation among the populations
regarding the fraction of nests infected by Serratia (c2 =
26.2, df = 7, P < 0.001), by Wolbachia (c2 = 21.7, df = 7,
P < 0.01) and by the pooled set of all the endosymbionts
(c2 = 21.0, df = 7, P < 0.01). The infection frequencies
of the two most common endosymbionts, Serratia and

Sirviö and Pamilo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:335
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/335

Wolbachia, showed no significant correlation when the
frequencies of infected nests in the eight populations
were compared (Spearman’s rs = -0.09, df = 6, ns).
We next tested whether the observed heterogeneity in
the infection frequencies was correlated with the genetic
structure of the ant populations. No significant correlation between the fraction of infected nests and the
mean relatedness in the eight populations was observed
(rs = -0.45 for Serratia, rs = 0.19 for Wolbachia and rs =
-0.43 when pooling all the endosymbionts, df = 6, ns).
As the power of the test at the level of populations may
be restricted by the small number of populations, we
also tested for a possible association by pooling populations. For this we used only populations with a somewhat similar average relatedness (0.40 < r < 0.59) and
tested whether the relatedness estimates calculated for
each nest were different in infected and non-infected
nests. No significant difference was found when testing
for Serratia, Wolbachia or all the endosymbionts
(Mann-Whitney test).
The number of workers infected by Serratia in a nest
showed significant positive correlation with the nest
relatedness in population 7 (Mäntyniemi) (Spearman rs
= 0.70, n = 9, P < 0.05). No significant correlation was
found in other populations or for Wolbachia infections.
Infection by all three bacteria was not found in any individuals or colonies, though some double infections were
found within both individuals and colonies. Serratia-Wolbachia infections were detected in some individuals from
population 7 (Mäntyniemi, 2 individuals out of 43), population 3 (Haukipudas, 1/99) and population 4 (Jääli, 1/84).
Double infection by Serratia and Cardinium was found
only in population 1 (Juurussuo) where a single ant out of
110 carried both bacteria. Wolbachia-Cardinium double
infection was found in population 2 (Koppana beach)
where two ants from the same colony were infected out of
100 individuals.
When pooling all the material, the frequency of
infected nests was 42/132 for Serratia, 25/132 for Wolbachia and 5/132 for Cardinium. The observed number
of nests with two different bacteria matched the random
expectation well based on these frequencies, 9 nests
with Serratia and Wolbachia, 3 nests with Serratia and
Cardinium and 2 nests with Wolbachia and Cardinium.
As the spreading of endosymbionts should be associated with the dispersal of the ant hosts, we next tested
whether the level of genetic differentiation between
population pairs (FST) was correlated with the difference
in the infection frequency between the same population
pairs. The difference in the prevalence of Wolbachia
increased with the genetic distance between populations
(rm = 0.62, P = 0.05, Mantel’s test), but no correlation
was found for Serratia (rm = 0.11, P = 0.25). The correlation between the geographical distance (measured in

Page 6 of 12

km) and the difference in the infection frequency was
not significant for either Wolbachia (r m = 0.27, P =
0.17) or Serratia (rm = - 0.22, P = 0.88). The latter correlation was even negative.
The only indication for a possible association between
mitochondrial haplotype and endosymbiont infection
was seen in mtDNA haplotype B. It was found in four
colonies and three of these carried also Serratia while
no other endosymbionts were detected in these colonies.
In total seven colonies (from two populations) had the
haplotype C, and Wolbachia was detected in two of
these, Cardinium in one and Serrata in none. The two
colonies with haplotype A and the only colony with
haplotype D had none of the endosymbionts.

Discussion
We found that the F. cinerea ants were infected by multiple endosymbiotic bacterial species Wolbachia, Cardinium and Serratia. The prevalence of both Wolbachia
and Serratia varied significantly among the populations
and colonies. This variation allowed the investigation of
whether the prevalence of endosymbionts was associated
with the social structure of colonies [10,11], whether the
infections were associated with specific genetic lines
defined by mitochondrial haplotypes [13] or genetic differentiation of populations, and whether the endosymbiont species competed with each other or co-infected
receptive hosts. This is the first study to reveal Cardinium and Serratia in ants.
Endosymbionts and the genetic structure of populations

Two of the detected endosymbionts, Wolbachia and
Cardinium, are known as reproductive manipulators in
insects. If the endosymbiotic bacteria cause cytoplasmic
incompatibility in the host, the infection frequency is
expected to be either low or high, as intermediate frequencies would commonly lead to incompatibilities [9].
The fraction of infected nests was low (3.8%) for Cardinium and moderate for Wolbachia (19.0%). Our results
on Wolbachia depart from the general pattern observed
in Formica ants, as in several species in northern Europe
all or almost all individuals have been infected by the
same Wolbachia strains [15,26]. The prevalence in F.
cinerea was low and the wsp primers did not amplify
the bacteria, indicating that F. cinerea could be infected
by a different strain. The frequency of Cardinium infections was very low for reliable statistical comparisons,
but the two endosymbionts seemed to coexist as
expected on the basis of random association. In other
studies, double infections of unrelated manipulative bacterial species have been reported to be relatively rare
[1]. The density and location of endosymbionts within
the host has been shown to depend on co-infection, as
observed for Wolbachia and Spiroplasma, as well as on

Sirviö and Pamilo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:335
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/335

the host genotype and environmental conditions [27,28].
If different bacteria, or different strains of the same bacteria, cause reproductive incompatibility, selection could
increase the frequency of all of them and lead to multiple infections as observed for Wolbachia in the ants Formica exsecta [26] and Acromyrmex [29].
Wenseleers et al. [10] proposed that while Wolbachia
may have problems invading an ant population with
monogynous colonies, it could spread in populations
with polygynous colonies. Their data also supported this
hypothesis as Wolbachia was found more commonly in
polygynous species of South-East Asian ants than in
monogynous species. Later, Shoemaker et al. [11] predicted that in monogynous species selection will tend to
maintain high rates of infection because of the high
costs of incompatible matings. This, indeed, seemed to
be the case in Solenopsis invicta fire ants. Thus,
the hypotheses make opposing predictions concerning
the association between the infection frequency and the
level of polygyny. The arguments were based on the fact
that some strains of Wolbachia are known to cause
cytoplasmic incompatibility in insects, but it should be
noted that the effects of endosymbionts on ant reproduction have not been documented. Formica cinerea is
known to show social polymorphism in the sense that
colonies tend to be monogynous in some populations
while polygynous in others [21,22]. The colonies in
polygynous populations can also form large supercolonies that consist of networks of interconnected nests.
Such differences in social organisation were also
detected in the present study with genetic relatedness
among worker nest mates ranging from 0.04 to 0.59.
However, the fraction of infected F. cinerea ants (individuals or colonies) was not significantly correlated with
the relatedness. We can conclude that no clear association existed between the endosymbionts and the social
type of the colonies.
There are three possible explanations for why the prevalence of Wolbachia in F. cinerea was low compared to
the other European Formica ants. First, our material
consisted of worker ants and it has been suggested that
workers can clear an infection, even though no clearance has been found in several Formica species that
have multiple infections [15,26]. Infected workers may
suffer an energetic cost which harmfully affects the
whole colony, both ants and endosymbionts [7]. Some
previous ant-Wolbachia studies have revealed that the
infection level tends to decrease with development; the
worker brood and female reproductives have higher
infection levels than the adult workers and males [7,30].
Such clearance does not necessarily harm the interests
of the bacteria as a non-reproductive worker can be a
dead-end to a vertically transmitted endosymbiont.
However, due to the large number of worker individuals,

Page 7 of 12

they offer a suitable source for horizontal transfer of
endosymbionts and it is therefore not evident that clearance is beneficial for the bacteria. The infection frequencies in F. cinerea were so small that it is doubtful
whether they could be explained by clearance, and it is
reasonable to suggest that not all the nests had infected
queens.
Second, the ants may have lost infections due to
population processes. For example the Wolbachia prevalence in invasive ant species is lower in the introduced
range than the native range [12,14,31]. The complete
lack of Wolbachia or low level of infection has been
considered as a sign of success of ants without the Wolbachia load in new habitats [11,31]. Formica cinerea has
distributed to northern latitudes after the withdrawal of
the last glacial period and is specialised in living in
sandy habitats that often appear as patchy areas. The
habitat patches (open sandy areas) are temporary and
the populations have been forced to track them, creating
local bottlenecks as is seen in invading species. In agreement with this view, genotypic variation indicates past
contacts between the F. cinerea populations in northern
Europe even though they appear isolated today [21].
The low overall level of nucleotide diversity in mtDNA
found in this study is also compatible with this view and
resembles the situation in several other Formica ants in
northern Europe [32].
Third, the low prevalence in F. cinerea compared to
other Formica species could result from an infection by
a different strain of Wolbachia. The commonly used primers for the wsp gene failed to produce any visible band
from F. cinerea samples even though the primers work
well in other Formica ants [[10,15,26], this study]. We
also sequenced 16SrDNA from several species from the
Formica rufa group, known to harbour strains wFex1,
wFex2 and wFex4 as defined by their wsp sequences
[15]. The wsp sequences of these strains differ from
each other by 10-21% of nucleotides. The 16SrDNA
sequences from these samples were identical to or differed by only one nucleotide from the common
sequences found in F. cinerea, and the most divergent
16SrDNA haplotypes observed from F. cinerea differed
by about 3% from each other. 16SrDNA is more conservative than the wsp gene, and recombination between
different Wolbachia strains may make it difficult to infer
the type of strain from a single gene. Sequencing of
Wolbachia genome from Drosophila simulans has
revealed that Wolbachia wRi has the most highly
recombining intracellular bacterial genome known to
date [33]. Recombination in Wolbachia breaks the
anticipated correlations between gene history, genome
history and strain phenotype, thus no single sequence
can correctly determine relationships between different
Wolbachia strains [33]. Furthermore recent finding that

Sirviö and Pamilo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:335
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/335

massive amount of Wolbachia sequences (177 kb) have
been transferred into the nuclear genomes of some
hosts adds further complexity in interpretation of the
infection status [33-35].
Some population pairs showed considerable genetic
differentiation as indicated by the pair-wise F ST estimates and the genetic differentiation of the hosts was
significantly correlated with a difference in Wolbachia
prevalence. The two Koppana populations (beach and
sand pit) give a good example of this as they showed a
significant genetic difference in spite of their close
proximity (separated by 1.5 km). The clustering of the
mtDNA haplotype B in the Koppana sand pit population, even though in only four colonies, agreed with the
pattern of differentiation seen in microsatellites. The
Koppana populations showed widely different endosymbiont prevalences (Table 1, Figure 1). About 45% of
individuals were infected in Koppana sand pit (pooling
all the three bacteria) but only 25% in Koppana beach.
The correlational evidence does not tell whether limited
dispersal of the ants has restricted the spreading of the
endosymbionts or whether incompatibilities caused by
the endosymbionts have restricted the gene flow of the
host. Intraspecific comparisons of nearby populations
with different social organisation have in other Formica
species shown that the polygynous colonies have less
genetic variation than the neighbouring monogynous
populations, particularly in mitochondrial DNA [F.
exsecta [23] and F. truncorum [36]]. This has been taken
to indicate that polygynous supercolonies may originate
through a population bottleneck and grow by budding
of colonies with restricted dispersal, as also observed in
introduced ant species that form unicolonial populations
[e.g. [37]]. In agreement with this, none of the rare
mtDNA variants (A, B, C and D) in F. cinerea were
found in the most polygynous populations.
Endosymbiont diversity in F. cinerea

Various maternally inherited bacteria are estimated to
infect approximately one third of arthropod species [1].
Wolbachia has been found to infect around 66% of the
species whereas other reproductive endosymbionts (Cardinium, Arsenophonus, Spiroplasma) occur in 4% to 7%
of studied arthropods [1,38]. At the population level, the
range of Wolbachia infections has been reported from
3% to 100%, generally being fixed or close to fixation
[1,39]. Wolbachia infections vary in F. cinerea between
1.2%-33% in populations and when taking into consideration the average infection percentage 5.6% we can
conclude that Wolbachia has low prevalence in F.
cinerea.
Six to seven percent of the studied insects and mites
and 22% of spider species are reported to have Cardinium infection [40,41] and it has been reported from

Page 8 of 12

Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Acari and Aranea
[1,42]. Cardinium has not been earlier reported from
ants even though three ant species (Cataglyphis sp.,
Messor capitatus, Platythyrea punctata) were included
along with 96 other invertebrates in a study where it
was screened [40]. We found Cardinium at low frequency (1-2% of individuals) in F. cinerea. Cardinium is
known to induce CI in parasitoid wasps Encarsia spp
and in spider mites Eotetranychus suginamensis [43,44],
parthenogenesis in parasitoid wasps Encarsia spp [45]
and feminization in false spider mites Brevipalpus spp
[2]. In predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis, Cardinium is reported to enhance the fecundity of the species
[46]. Historical evidence for horizontal transfer has been
reported for Cardinium [40], even though some studies
failed to find evidence for it even between parasitoids
and their hosts [e.g. [47]].
Serratia symbiotica is known as a secondary endosymbiont of aphids [25] and was detected in all but one
population of F. cinerea with the infection percentage
varying from 2% to 42%, and the overall percentage was
33% of the nests. In several populations Serratia was the
most common of the endosymbionts studied here and
in Koppana sand pit (population number 5) almost all
the colonies (13/16) were infected. A few sequences of
Serratia differed clearly from the others (by 1.4%), indicating two separate bacterial lineages. This difference is
similar to that between Serratia haplotypes from
F. cinerea and some aphids (0.4 - 1.5%). It is likely that
the bacteria have been transferred horizontally both
within and between species as has been detected in
other S. symbiotica studies [25,48].
The fact that Serratia is found in both ants and aphids
could be related to the fact that many ants, including
F. cinerea, prey on aphids and also tend them for honeydew. This can offer a potential transmission route
because honeydew does not contain only plant sap but
also excretions from the aphid. Oral ingestion has been
suggested to provide a transmission route also among
aphids either via honeydew, squashed aphids or phloem
sap of plants heavily populated by aphids [49]. It is not
sure whether F. cinerea has Serratia as a true endosymbiont or whether it is only transient gut bacterium in
ants. We successfully amplified both Wolbachia and
Cardinium from the heads and thoraces of the ants,
Wolbachia also from legs, suggesting that these bacteria
exist as true endosymbionts. Other Serratia species (e.g.
S. marcescens) are known to associate with many insects
as a pathogen [50]. It will be interesting to explore the
role of Serratia in the biology of F. cinerea as various gut
symbionts have been shown to be a major force in ant
evolution [20]. It has also been shown that Wolbachia
can be an essential symbiont in insects, providing vitamins to the host [51]. Although many endosymbionts are

Sirviö and Pamilo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:335
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/335

mainly vertically transmitted, many cases of horizontal
transfer between host species have been reported. Our
study clearly indicates the need for a large scale screening
not only for Wolbachia but also for other endosymbionts
that are capable for manipulation of the reproduction
and sexual bias of the host species.

Conclusions
We found three endosymbiotic bacteria, Wolbachia, Cardinium and Serratia with significantly varying infection
frequencies among Formica cinerea colonies and populations. This is the first report of Cardinium and Serratia in
ants. Both Wolbachia and Cardinium are known to
manipulate reproduction of their hosts, even though the
effects have not been demonstrated in ants. Our discovery
of several endosymbionts and co-infections by Wolbachia
and Cardinium demonstrate the importance of screening
several endosymbionts when evaluating their possible
effects on social life and queen-worker conflicts over sex
allocation. Whether Serratia is an endosymbiont or a transient gut bacterium in F. cinerea needs to be clarified. All
three bacteria had low to moderate prevalence in ants.
This differs from the pattern seen earlier in many Formica
species in which all worker ants have been infected, and it
is likely that F. cinerea carries a different strain of Wolbachia. The ant populations could be divided into two
groups, one characterised by highly polygynous nests/
relatedness among worker nest mates r ≤ 0.12) and the
other by largely monogynous nests (r ≥ 0.40). The prevalence of the endosymbionts did not correlate significantly
with the relatedness, suggesting that there is no evident
association between the endosymbiont infections and the
social type of the colonies at the geographical scale studied. The difference in Wolbachia prevalence correlated
significantly with the pair-wise genetic distance of populations suggesting that spreading of the bacteria is connected to the isolation of the host populations. However,
it is not possible to conclude whether limited dispersal of
the ants has restricted the spreading of the endosymbionts
or whether incompatibilities caused by the endosymbionts
have restricted the gene flow of the host.
Methods
Samples

The material came from 656 worker ants sampled in 10
Formica cinerea populations (Table 1) around Oulu
region in central Finland in September and October
2001. We sampled 3 to 22 colonies per population and
five workers per colony. Only eight populations with at
least nine nests were used for the population analyses.
The distance between the sampled nests was at least 5
metres to increase the probability that different colonies
were selected. The distance between populations varied
from 1.5 to 50 km. Samples were stored in 90% ethanol

Page 9 of 12

(which helps to separate the ectoparasitic mites), and we
also visually checked to make sure that the ants did not
carry any mites. Genomic DNA was extracted using the
Qiagen DNeasy Tissue Kit that purifies also mitochondrial and bacterial DNA. Individual ants were placed in
separate 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes that were dipped in
liquid nitrogen and ground by using disposable microtube pestles. The following steps in DNA extraction were
done according to manufacturer’s protocol for animal tissue. DNA concentration and purity of samples were measured by spectrophotometer (Eppendorf biophotometer)
and concentration values ranged between 20-60 ng/ul (in
final volume of 200 ul) and purity of DNA was measured
as ratio of absorbances at wavelengths of 260 and 280
nm, the values ranged between 1.5-1.8 when using sterile
water as diluent. We also checked the presence of Wolbachia and Cardinium in different body parts separately
and succesfully amplified and sequenced them from
DNA extracted from both heads and thoraces. Wolbachia
was also found in gasters and legs of the ants.
Mitochondrial sequences

Primer pair cytb3-tRNA-Ser [52] was used to amplify
about 500 bp of mitochondrial DNA including the 3’
region of the gene cytochrome oxidase b, short intervening
region and 5’ sequence of the gene tRNA-Ser. The total
volume of the PCR reactions was 15 ul and contained 1×
PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM of each nucleotide,
0.5 μM primers cytb and tRNASer, 0.3 units of enzyme
(Dynazyme II by Finnzymes). The following PCR program
was used for amplification: denaturation at 94°C for 3 min,
94°C for 1 min, 50°C 50 sec, 72°C for 1 min, cycles 30,
final extension at 72°C for 10 min using PCR machine
PTC-200. The PCR products were run in 2% agarose gels
at 100 V for 2-3 hours to verify the success of amplification. Thereafter they were run on Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) gels to study haplotype
variation. Three gel temperatures were tested, +4°C, +15°C
and +37°C and temperature +37°C gave the best results
and was used for all the samples. Prerun of SSCP was
done at 200 V for 30 minutes to warm up the acrylamide
gels and to remove additional traces of acrylamide from
wells where denatured samples were run for 5 hours at
200 V. The gels were stained using the AgNO3 method
[53] and dried on frames in room temperature for two
days before scoring. One individual per nest and the samples that had a deviating banding pattern on SSCP were
selected for further sequencing. To strengthen the intensity of the amplification products for direct sequencing, we
did secondary PCR by using 1 ul of the initial PCR product
as a template. Otherwise the protocol was the same as in
the first PCR. Secondary PCR products were purified by
using the MinElute kit (Qiagen) for direct sequencing
reactions where 1/8 part reactions of Big Dye Terminator

Sirviö and Pamilo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:335

v 3.0 were done according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing
reactions were purified by the Sephadex-method (Sigma
Aldrich) before the run in the capillary sequencer
ABI3730. Sequences were inspected by the program
Sequencher v 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation) and alignments were done by ClustalW in MEGA v 3.1 [54].
Microsatellites

Fifteen microsatellite loci were tested with gradient PCR
(45-64°C) and the products were run in 2% agarose gel
and in ABI377. Four highly polymorphic loci (Fe13, Fe16,
Fe38, FL20) [55,56] were selected. The primer pairs Fe13,
FL20 and FL20 had been used in an earlier study on F.
cinerea [21,22]. The microsatellite PCR-program consisted
of predenaturation at 94°C for 3 min, 35 cycles consisting
94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 40 sec (for Fe13 primer pair 53°C
for 40 sec), 72°C for 50 sec. In the end an elongated extension time of 45 minutes was applied at 72°C to assure
the proper extension of PCR products. PCR products
were run in an ABI prism 377 Sequencer and fragments
were analysed by using the GeneScan and Genotyper software packages (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
Endosymbionts

The same DNA samples that were used in the analysis
of nuclear and mitochondrial markers were studied for
several endosymbionts. Thus we could be certain that
the DNA extractions were successful and the genomic
DNA was of good quality. The following primer pairs
were tested for Wolbachia by direct PCR: wsp 81F-691R
[57], Wolb 16SrDNA [12] and general 16SrDNA [58].
PCR reactions for the wsp-primer pair contained 1×
PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM of each nucleotide,
0.5 μM of primer 81F and 691R, and 0.3 U of DynazymeII (Finnzymes). Gradient PCR (50°C-60°C) was used
to test optimal amplification conditions for Wsp by
using F. cinerea individuals and positive controls (F.
aquilonia and F. lemani individuals) as test samples.
The annealing temperature that gave the strongest
bands (for positive controls) was selected for use in a
further PCR program for wsp. In addition, primer pairs
were used for several additional positive controls from
different Formica species, including F. polyctena (colonies U-11 and S-33 studied for mtDNA [32] and for
wsp [15]), F. rufa (S-35), F. lugubris (S-42, U-36), F. pratensis (S-44). The PCR program included steps of denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, 94°C 1 min, 53°C 50 sec, 72°
C 1 min, cycled 40 times, final extension at 72°C for 10
min. Positive (F. lemani and F. aquilonia) and negative
(sterile water) controls were included in all the PCRruns. The amount of template used was 1 ul (20 ng/ul).
Hemi-nested PCR [46] was used to screen several
endosymbiotic bacteria. In the first PCR reactions we

Page 10 of 12

used universal primer pair 27Forward 5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’ and 1513Reverse 5’-ACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’ for 16SrDNA that amplify
a 1.5 kb fragment from all eubacteria [59]. In the second
PCR, the diluted PCR-product (1:46) was used as a template for each bacteria specific primer pair that amplify
fragments from the Ricketsia (27F and Rick16SR 5’CATCCATCAGCGATAAATCTTTC-3’) [60], Spiroplasma (27F and TKSSsp 5’-TAGCCG TGGCT
TTCTGGTAA -3’) [61], Buchnera (Buch16S1F 5’GAGCTTGCTCTCTTTGTCGGCAA-3’ and Buch16S1R
5’-CTTCTGCGGGTAACGTCACGAA-3’) [60], PASS=Candidatus Serratia symbiotica (27F and PASScmp:
5’GCAATGTCTTATTAACACAT-3’) [50], Cardinium
(CLOf 5’-GCGGTGTAAAATGAGCGTG -3’ and
CLOr1 5’- ACCTMTTCTTAACTCAAGCCT -3’ and
CLOF and CLOr2 5’-TGTGTACAAGGTCCG AGA
ACG -3’) [46], EPS (EPS-f 5’-TACAATCTTTATTAACCCATGTT -’3 and EPS-r 5’- TTCAAAGTAGCAAAATACATTC-3’) [45] and Wolbachia (w76F
5’- TTGTAGCCTGCTATGGTATAACT -3’ and
w1012R 5’ GAATAGGTATGATTTTCATGT -3’) [58].
A PCR reaction for each primer pair was done according to the protocol described in the references. In each
PCR plate we used sterile water as a negative control.
As positive controls we used samples that were known
to contain Wolbachia (F. lemani, F. aquilonia), but no
positive control for the other bacteria was available in
the beginning. In later steps samples that were shown to
include the desired bacteria were used as positive control. PCR products were run on 1.5% agarose gel stained
with ethidium bromide and the bands were visualized
under ultraviolet illumination. The bands of a correct
size were cut and purified with the MinElute Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Purified DNA was cloned using
TOPO TA-cloning kit (Invitrogen) and after the extraction of plasmids the success of cloning was determined
by PCR [1 × buffer, 0.25 mM of each nucleotide, 0.5
uM of primer M13F and M13R and Dynazyme II (Finnzymes) 0.3 U] done in the total volume of 15 μl. The
PCR program included the steps of denaturation at 94°C
for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, at 46°C for 50
sec, at 72°C for 1 min and final extension at 72°C for 10
min. Three microlitres of the product was run on 1.5%
agarose gel to verify the success of cloning and the correct size of the band by using M13 forward and reverse
primers flanking the insertion site in the cloning vector
(pCR 2.1-TOPO). The rest of the reaction was purified
with the MinElute 96 UF PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen).
Both strands were sequenced from PCR products from
one to five clones per individual by a vector-specific primer pair (included in the TOPO TA-cloning kit) and
sequencing was done with the Big Dye Ready Reaction
Kit as 1/8 part reaction according to the instructions of

Sirviö and Pamilo BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:335
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/335

the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were
inspected by the program Sequencher v. 4.7 and the
alignments were done in MEGA v 3.1 [54].
Statistical analyses

The genetic relatedness (r) and inbreeding (F) coefficients
for ant nests and populations were calculated using the
algorithms of Queller and Goodnight [62] and Pamilo [24].
Relatedness is the probability of allele sharing between
individuals above the average probability given by the gene
frequencies in the population. Genetic diversity was analysed using the GENEPOP package version on the web
[63] and genetic differentiation was estimated as FST [64]
by sampling repeatedly (20 repeats) one individual from
each nest. The FST estimates between populations were
tested by comparing the initial estimates against the distribution obtained by permutation of the nests (100 times).
The genetic distances and phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA version 3.1 [54]. The haplotype network scheme for mitochondrial DNA was constructed by
using the statistical parsimony method implemented in the
program TCS v. 1.21. Other statistical analyses were done
by using the SPSS (v 16.0) software program.
