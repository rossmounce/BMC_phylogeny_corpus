Abstract
Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as defined here are single base sequence
changes or short insertion/deletions between or within individuals of a given species. As a result of
their abundance and the availability of high throughput analysis technologies SNP markers have
begun to replace other traditional markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(RFLPs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and simple sequence repeats (SSRs or
microsatellite) markers for fine mapping and association studies in several species. For SNP
discovery from chromatogram data, several bioinformatics programs have to be combined to
generate an analysis pipeline. Results have to be stored in a relational database to facilitate
interrogation through queries or to generate data for further analyses such as determination of
linkage disequilibrium and identification of common haplotypes. Although these tasks are routinely
performed by several groups, an integrated open source SNP discovery pipeline that can be easily
adapted by new groups interested in SNP marker development is currently unavailable.
Results: We developed SNP-PHAGE (SNP discovery Pipeline with additional features for
identification of common haplotypes within a sequence tagged site (Haplotype Analysis) and
GenBank (-dbSNP) submissions. This tool was applied for analyzing sequence traces from diverse
soybean genotypes to discover over 10,000 SNPs. This package was developed on UNIX/Linux
platform, written in Perl and uses a MySQL database. Scripts to generate a user-friendly web
interface are also provided with common queries for preliminary data analysis. A machine learning
tool developed by this group for increasing the efficiency of SNP discovery is integrated as a part
of this package as an optional feature. The SNP-PHAGE package is being made available open
source at http://bfgl.anri.barc.usda.gov/ML/snp-phage/.
Conclusion: SNP-PHAGE provides a bioinformatics solution for high throughput SNP discovery,
identification of common haplotypes within an amplicon, and GenBank (dbSNP) submissions. SNP
selection and visualization are aided through a user-friendly web interface. This tool is useful for
analyzing sequence tagged sites (STSs) of genomic sequences, and this software can serve as a
starting point for groups interested in developing SNP markers.

Background
When undertaking polymorphism discovery, the selection
of an optimal tool depends on the nature of input
sequences. For sequences that are derived from individual
clones where there is no heterogeneity, SNP discovery can
be accomplished by comparing sequence information.
When relatively few reads are available, PolyBayes[1] in
combination with Phrap[2] can be used. In this case,
Phrap performs the sequence assembly and PolyBayes
detects SNPs by implementing a Bayesian algorithm. The
PolyBayes algorithm estimates the conditional probabilities accounting for Phred quality scores and depth of
reads. However, for analyzing a large sequence dataset,
such as shotgun sequence reads from a finished genome,
ssahaSNP[3] may be optimal. The ssahaSNP software performs fast searches through custom hashing algorithm for
making alignments and screens for SNP candidates using
neighborhood quality standard, NQS[4]. The NQS algorithm accounts for the quality value of the bases with variation as well as the quality values in the neighboring
bases. Mining of SNPs from EST sequences is an attractive
proposition in some plant and animal species when
genome sequences are not yet available. The steps
involved in SNP discovery from EST sequences include
clustering, sequence assembly and SNP detection and
there are several software options available to handle each
of these steps. It is important to use Phred quality scores
and multiple sequence evidences in calling a putative
SNP. However EST data can only provide very limited
putative polymorphisms as this approach requires
sequences from different genotypes and depth of reads to
reduce the likelihood of false positives. Except for the
most abundantly expressed genes, the numbers of redundant EST sequences are relatively low. Also other factors
such as alternative splicing, reverse transcription errors,
and RNA editing further interfere with the predictions
even after including sequence quality scores. By constructing a software data analysis pipeline SNP discovery from
EST sequences was successfully implemented for maize
[5], human [6] and pine [7] species. In polyploid species
like soybean SNP, discovery efforts are further complicated by polyploidy where paralog sequences have to be
delineated before SNP calling can be done (manuscript in
preparation).
For large-scale targeted SNP discovery from PCR amplified
sequence tagged sites containing potential sequence variation(s) using a set of flanking primers, PolyPhred [8] is
widely used because it can detect heterozygous bases from
the two alleles within an individual. Along with the
release of PolyPhred version 5.0 [9], other software such
as InSNP [10], novoSNP [11] and SNPdetector [12] have
recently been released. These packages are specially
designed for re-sequencing projects and most of them
require an anchor sequence to align individual reads to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/468

form a sequence assembly. InSNP [10] is a windows based
package and can be helpful for users not familiar with
Linux. SNPdetector [12] scripts work only on Unix/Linux
platforms and uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm for
aligning reads, as well as a modified version of the NQS
[4] method for detecting homozygous SNPs among different individuals. In addition, SNPdetector requires a minimum of a 30% threshold for a secondary peak intensity
for detecting heterozygous SNPs. NovoSNP [11] is
designed with a graphical interface and is written in Tcl,
so, it can work on windows and Unix/Linux based platforms. NovoSNP uses BLAST [13] for aligning sequence
reads and uses a series of filters to reduce false positives.
This package is configured to work with a database, and,
hence, it makes polymorphism discovery and data storage
seamless. Other polymorphism discovery software, such
as autoSNP [14], that rely on redundancy and co-segregation of markers within a sequence are useful when trace
data are not available.
A high-throughput polymorphism discovery project
involves the analysis and management of different types
of data including sequences, polymorphisms, genotypes,
and haplotypes, and, hence, all of the analytical steps
need to be automated and the information stored in a
relational database. Bioperl [15] is a rich resource for performing several bioinformatics analyses, however, there
are currently no modules available for parsing the output
generated by PolyBayes and PolyPhred. The Perl package,
POSA [16], contains a script for executing PhredPhrap and
parsing the PolyPhred output. However, that script
ignored indels, so, that program was extensively modified
and used in the development of this package. The objective of the work reported here was to develop an open
source package for facilitating polymorphism discovery
through application of the widely used software, PolyBayes [1] and PolyPhred [8], for analysis, storing, and
editing of polymorphism information in a relational database through a user friendly web interface. Additional features were desired for identifying common haplotypes
within a sequence tagged site (STS) fragment and for generating data in the formats required for dbSNP submissions. Using a large annotated training dataset derived
from PolyBayes predictions, our group has implemented
a machine learning algorithm [17] that improved the efficiency of SNP discovery in soybean by reducing the need
for expert intervention by 85%. The machine learning
component is integrated as a part of SNP-PHAGE software.

Implementation
The SNP-PHAGE software pipeline is run through a combination of UNIX/Linux command line and web browser
interfaces. It was implemented in Perl and uses standard
open source modules such as Bioperl [15]. SNP-PHAGE,

however, requires other packages, such as Phred [18,19],
Phrap [2], CrossMatch [2], PolyPhred [8], PolyBayes [1]
and C4.5 [20]. All of this software is freely available for
academic use from the links provided at the SNP-PHAGE
website. An installation guide is provided with the SNPPHAGE package that contains test scripts to check for prerequisite software availability. These test scripts also
include test data to check the installation success, the
database install, and the web interface [see Additional file
1].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/468

• Phred was used for base calling because it provides quality scores along with the base calls. While our internal test
runs (not reported) with the demo version of the TraceTuner commercial software provided similar results as
Phred for high quality bases, the two base-calling software
packages gave variable results with low quality bases. Neither software was consistently superior.
• Phrap was used for sequence assembly of chromatograms from STSs, because it has more flexible parameters
than CAP3 [21] to force alignment at lower match scores.

SNP-PHAGE software has three components:
a) Relational database schema and tables for storing information about the STS, sample chromatograms and genotypes, consensus sequence, and polymorphisms and
haplotypes;
b) Scripts for analyzing chromatograms by executing the
programs described above in a given sequence (Phred,
Phrap, PolyPhred and PolyBayes), parsing the program
outputs for putative SNPs, and making database entries.
c) Implementation of a web interface for viewing putative
SNPs; adding new SNPs; validating SNPs; and editing consensus sequence and generating a report containing confirmed SNPs. The genotype output is of the highest quality
base from duplicate samples and/or sequencing reads
from both forward and reverse directions. Haplotypes
present in each STS are also determined.
A flow-chart containing data processing and analysis steps
in SNP-PHAGE is presented in Figure 1. Some parameters
such as directory locations, database connection parameters, and program options are system specific hence they
require customization. These parameters are defined in
the Config directory and are not hard-coded in the software implementation. The scripts refer to this directory for
obtaining the parameters required for their execution.
Understanding and implementing these steps will require
some technical expertise with the UNIX/Linux operating
systems. A user manual is also provided that explains the
use of various features.
SNP-PHAGE software was implemented with the following features.
• A standard chromatogram naming convention is
required to facilitate sequence assembly by following the
St. Louis convention described in the Phrap documentation [2] for easy association with sequence tag sites and
individual genotypes. A file renaming script (renameFiles.pl) is also provided with this software for help with
filename conversion.

• The SNP discovery pipeline includes: 1) PolyBayes,
which uses a Bayesian inference engine to calculate the
probability that a given site is polymorphic primarily optimized for detecting SNPs among homozygous individuals; and 2) PolyPhred, which is optimized for detecting
SNPs in heterozygous individuals. PolyBayes software has
been used to accurately predict SNPs in humans with EST
sequences aligned to finished and working-draft quality
genomic sequences[22]. It can also be used to analyze
amplified STSs from inbred species such as soybean [23].
• Chromatograms from several STSs can be combined
into a batch for automated analysis. The output files from
PolyBayes and PolyPhred containing the candidate polymorphisms are parsed and entries are made to a relational
database.
• A web interface provides access to search or browse
options through a list of STSs to analyze and validate candidate polymorphisms (Figure 2). Additional options
include the ability to edit the consensus sequence, add
new SNPs, and to generate reports for each STS containing
confirmed SNPs.
• SNP validation can be performed for local or global
alignments with candidate SNPs visualized from a web
based graphical interface similar to the Consed [24] output screen. The quality of the base at the polymorphism
position can be ascertained from the background color of
the base on the screen as in Consed.
• The SNP-PHAGE software currently has a limitation in
viewing the underlying trace files. Hence, heterozygous
SNPs marked by PolyPhred have to be visualized using
the Consed interface. A software update to incorporate
this feature will be released at a later date.
• The results generated from a machine learning algorithm along with the multiple features used in the analysis
are displayed to aid the decision making process.
• Candidate polymorphisms can be either confirmed or
eliminated from the web interface after manual inspec-

tion. These expert-confirmed polymorphisms are then
used to create new database entries of validated SNPs, to
assign a genotype for each sample, to identify haplotypes
within an STS, and to make database entries to facilitate
dbSNP submissions.

Results and discussion
SNP-PHAGE has been applied to amplified STSs of soybean to discover SNPs [23]. Following studies have used
SNP-PHAGE for the discovery of over 10,000 SNPs in soybean STSs. A subset of 1,185 SNPs from this set was used
to generate a high density soybean linkage map (manuscript in preparation). SNP-PHAGE was also used in comparative legume analysis. A set of 1,165 soybean primers
were used to amplify genomic regions from seven legumes
and resulting inter-species polymorphisms were used to
study the evolutionary relationships between these legumes (manuscript in preparation). SNP-PHAGE was also
used to validate in-silico predicted SNPs in soybean using
EST data (manuscript in preparation).
SNP-PHAGE is designed to identify a set of putative SNPs
by applying PolyBayes and PolyPhred. PolyBayes and
PolyPhred were optimized for different SNP detection sce-

narios (homozygous and heterozygous SNPs) and inclusion of both packages in the software pipeline enhances
flexibility. Depending on the species or DNA/RNA source
considered, one of the algorithms may be more appropriate. Application of machine learning in polymorphism
discovery was shown to improve the efficiency of SNP discovery by 85% with SNPs predicted by PolyBayes. Inclusion of machine learning inference along with a visual
interface for easy and quick visualization of SNPs is likely
to also improve the efficiency of SNP validation.
SNP-PHAGE accounts for differences in SNPs detected by
PolyBayes and PolyPhred. When a SNP is called by both
algorithms, genotypes generated from PolyPhred are
used, because it finds both homozygous and heterozygous bases. PolyBayes marks each position in a multiple
indel as a separate SNP, whereas PolyPhred combines the
multiple indels into a single SNP, as is required for dbSNP
submission. The SNP positions in such multiple indels
from PolyBayes can be flagged during SNP validation so
that they can be combined into a single indel in subsequent analysis. The consensus sequence at SNP positions
depends on the individuals genotyped, because bases in
those positions are derived from the most frequently

observed genotypes. For indels, the change is more striking to the user, because it can offset other SNP positions
in the consensus sequence.

Bayes. One of the features that can be added for heterozygous SNPs is the ratio of peak heights, as SNPdetector
implementation requires this ratio to be at least 0.3.

SNP-PHAGE can, in principle, be extended to work with
other UNIX/Linux based SNP detection packages such as
novoSNP [11] and SNPdetector [12]. However, these
packages use different sequence matching and assembly
algorithms, including programs such as BLAST and SIM
that may result in different alignments, and thus SNP
positions may differ.

SNP-PHAGE provides the basic framework for SNP detection and validation. Other supplementary features and
functions are being considered for addition to the interface. These additional features will be provided as updates
in future with notifications by email for all registered
users. This open source resource is intended to be further
improved through user suggestions and encourages participation through provision of their custom scripts to be
included in SNP-PHAGE. Some of these features planned
will require availability of additional data such as whole
genome sequence to provide genome coordinates, EST
sequence to annotate the location of intron and exon
sites, and protein sequence for annotation as synonymous
vs. non-synonymous SNPs. Other scripts that are being
customized for incorporation into the SNP-PHAGE
include trio validation, estimation of θ and Fst values [25]
and data formatting to provide data in the formats
required for performing other analyses such as Phylogeny,
and PHASE [26] or HaploView [27].

The interface allows the user to deal with some exceptional cases encountered during the expert SNP validation
such as (i) identification of a high quality SNP not called
by the prediction programs, (2) poor consensus sequence
trimming, and (3) an incorrect consensus base at the SNP
position. The interface allows for the addition of the SNP,
along with the entry of the associated genotype into the
database, custom consensus sequence trimming, and editing of consensus sequence bases.

Conclusion
SNP-PHAGE is a simple, user friendly package for automated high-throughput polymorphism discovery. The
package is provided with an installation guide and user
manual to assist in deployment and implementation of
this application. Additional pre-requisites for installing
this application are minimal and only require those
needed for base calling, sequence assembly and polymorphism detection.

Polymorphism discovery and validation requires a balance between sensitivity (minimize the false negative
SNPs) and specificity (minimize the false positive SNPs).
However, these requirements may vary for individual
projects. Projects driven by the need to reduce sequencing
costs may wish to investigate all putative SNPs thus allowing for false positives; whereas other targeted projects such
as those using SNPs as a biomarker for disease validation
cannot tolerate false positives. The polymorphism detection programs attempt to fulfill these requirements by
ranking SNPs by a score/probability value. The number of
false positive SNPs predicted by PolyBayes and PolyPhred
has been shown to be reduced by additionally considering
the alignment and quality of the neighboring bases (NQS
[4]). The modified version of NQS has been used in SNPDetector [12]; whereas, in the machine learning (ML)
approach, the required feature values are automatically
determined from an expert-annotated dataset [17]. SNPPHAGE software calculates and makes database entries for
a number of additional features not implemented by
other SNP detection software. These features can also be
used to generate a new custom set of rules for filtering
SNPs. ML was applied only on the SNPs detected by Poly-
