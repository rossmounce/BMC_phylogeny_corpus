Abstract
Background: High Salinity is a major environmental stress influencing growth and development of rice.
Comparative proteomic analysis of hybrid rice shoot proteins from Shanyou 10 seedlings, a salt-tolerant hybrid
variety, and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, a salt-sensitive hybrid variety, was performed to identify new components
involved in salt-stress signaling.
Results: Phenotypic analysis of one protein that was upregulated during salt-induced stress, cyclophilin 2 (OsCYP2),
indicated that OsCYP2 transgenic rice seedlings had better tolerance to salt stress than did wild-type seedlings.
Interestingly, wild-type seedlings exhibited a marked reduction in maximal photochemical efficiency under salt
stress, whereas no such change was observed for OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings. OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings had
lower levels of lipid peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type seedlings.
Spatiotemporal expression analysis of OsCYP2 showed that it could be induced by salt stress in both Shanyou 10
and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, but Shanyou 10 seedlings showed higher OsCYP2 expression levels. Moreover,
circadian rhythm expression of OsCYP2 in Shanyou 10 seedlings occurred earlier than in Liangyoupeijiu seedlings.
Treatment with PEG, heat, or ABA induced OsCYP2 expression in Shanyou 10 seedlings but inhibited its expression
in Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. Cold stress inhibited OsCYP2 expression in Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. In
addition, OsCYP2 was strongly expressed in shoots but rarely in roots in two rice hybrid varieties.
Conclusions: Together, these data suggest that OsCYP2 may act as a key regulator that controls ROS level by
modulating activities of antioxidant enzymes at translation level. OsCYP2 expression is not only induced by salt
stress, but also regulated by circadian rhythm. Moreover, OsCYP2 is also likely to act as a key component that is
involved in signal pathways of other types of stresses-PEG, heat, cold, or ABA.

Background
Rice is a salt-sensitive cereal crop. High salinity may
cause delayed seed germination, slow seedling growth,
and reduced rate of seed set, leading to decreased rice
yield. These disorders are generally due to the combined
effects of ion imbalance, hyperosmotic stress, and oxidative damage. In the early period, rice can rapidly perceive a salt stress signal via plasma membrane receptors
in root cells and can rapidly initiate an intracellular

signal that modulates gene expression to elicit an adaptive response.
Functional genomics is an effective tool for identifying
new genes, determining gene expression patterns in
response to salt stress, and understanding their functions in stress adaptation. Initially, gene expression is
examined at the mRNA level using large-scale screening
techniques such as cDNA microarrays, serial analysis of
gene expression, and cDNA-amplified fragment-length
polymorphism. cDNA microarrays containing 1728
cDNAs were used to analyze gene expression profiles
during the initial phase of salt stress in rice roots, and
found that approximately 10% of the transcripts in Pokkali were significantly upregulated or downregulated

within 1 h of salt stress [1]. To date, cDNA microarray
analyses have identified approximately 450 salt-responsive unigenes in shoots of the highly salt-tolerant rice
variety, Nona Bokra, and most of them were not known
to be involved in salt stress [2]. In addition, forward and
reverse genetics have identified gene functions during
salt stress. Interestingly, map-based cloning was used to
isolate a rice quantitative trait loci gene, SKC1 that
encoded an HKT-type transporter selective for Na + .
Analysis of transgenic rice plants with loss-of-function
or gain-of-function phenotypes that were changed by
forward and reverse genetics revealed that SKC1 was
involved in regulating K+/Na+ homeostasis under salt
stress [3]. Also, in Arabidopsis, overexpression of SOS1,
which encoded a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter,
improved salt tolerance [4].
Recently, proteome profiles of rice in response to salt
stress were presented for various tissues or organs such
as roots, leaf lamina, leaf sheaths and young panicles
[5-8]. Although some differential proteins of interest
have been identified, little is known about the functions
of these proteins.
Here, OsCYP2, a salt-induced rice cyclophilin, was
separated and identified by 2-DE, MALDI-TOF MS and
ESI-MS/MS. OsCYP2 had peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase or rotamase) activity that was specifically
inhibited by cyclosporine A [9]. Moreover, OsCYP2 lacks
introns, and the 5’ end of transcript contains an AT-rich
region, suggesting that OsCYP2 was likely to be preferentially translated during stress conditions [10]. Actually,
OsCYP2 could respond to multiple environmental stresses such as high salt, drought, heat and oxidative stress.
For example, heterologous expression of OsCYP2 was
able to enhance ability of E. coli to survive, to complement the yeast mutant lacking native OsCYP2 and to
improve the growth of wild type yeast under the above
mentioned abiotic stresses [9]. In addition, significantly
differential changes in transcript abundance of OsCYP2
were found in shoots of salt sensitive (IR64) and tolerant
(Pokkali) rice cultivars at different developmental stages
under normal and salt stress conditions [9].
We have therefore focused on the effect of OsCYP2
expression on salt tolerance in rice seedlings. Overexpression of OsCYP2 conferred salt tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings. Although OsCYP2-transgenic
seedlings did not predominate over wild-type seedlings
in ion homeostasis (K+/Na+ ratio) and osmotic regulation (free proline), they displayed lower levels of lipid
peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type seedlings, suggesting that
the involvement of OsCYP2 in the response of rice seedling to salt stress is required, but also it can enhance salt
tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings by controlling ROS
levels. In addition to salt stress, OsCYP2 can respond to

other types of stresses, such as drought, heat and cold,
indicating that OsCYP2 is likely to act as a general integrator of environmental stresses.

Results
Evaluation of the salt tolerance of two rice hybrid
varieties

To compare the salt tolerance of the two rice hybrid
varieties, Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu, relative length
and dry weight of shoots and roots were determined
after exposure to salt stress, respectively. The roots and
shoots of Shanyou 10 were longer and heavier than
those of Liangyoupeijiu (Figure 1B, C). Phenotypic analysis showed that Shanyou 10 seedlings grew faster than
Liangyoupeijiu seedlings under salt stress conditions
(Figure 1A), suggesting that Shanyou 10 seedlings were
relatively more tolerant to salt.
Separation and identification of differentially expressed
salt-responsive proteins of rice seedlings

To understand the differences between Shanyou 10 and
Liangyoupeijiu at the protein expression level, 2-DE and
MS were used to separate and identify differentially
expressed salt-responsive proteins of rice seedlings in
Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu. More than 1050 rice
shoot proteins (more than 950 proteins from IPG5-8 and
more than 100 proteins from IPG7-10) were detected by
image match analysis. Of these, 34 proteins were up- or
downregulated in response to salt stress. Nine upregulated proteins consistently showed significant and reproducible increases in abundance (1- to 4-fold) under NaCl
stress (Figure 2A, B) and were selected for MALDI-TOF
MS analysis. They were identified as a putative glutathione S-transferase, manganese superoxide dismutase,
dehydroascorbate reductase (free radical scavenging), a
putative phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (pentose
phosphate pathway), putative l-aspartate oxidase (protein
metabolism), putative cold shock protein-1(cold stress
response), prohibitin (cell proliferation), a putative membrane protein (unknown function), a putative oxygenevolving enhancer protein 3-1 (photosynthesis) and
cyclophilin 2 (OsCYP2)(protein folding) (Table 1).
The p8 protein spot in Figure 2B was selected for
further analysis using ESI-MS/MS to determine peptide
sequence. Three peptides from the p8 spot were
sequenced and matched to OsCYP2 in the MASCOT
database (Table 2). Two peptides (m/z 1424.64 and
1656.64) were found in matched peptides from PMF
(Additional file 1). These results identified the p8 spot
as OsCYP2. The other protein spots were also validated
using ESI-MS/MS (Additional file 2).
OsCYP2 (accession no. AAA57046) was predicted to
encode a protein of 172 amino acids with a molecular
mass of 18.6 kDa and a pI of 8.61.In the conserved

region of OsCYP2, the residues His-61, Arg-62, Phe-67,
Gln-118, Phe-120, Trp-128 and His-33 appeared to be
associated with PPIase catalysis. Three of these, including His-61, Arg-62 and Phe-120, are most essential for
PPIase activity of OsCYP2. The residue Trp-128 is a
binding site of OsCYP2 with immunosuppressant
cyclosporin A (Figure 3A). OsCYP2 had significant
homology with other known cyclophilins from various
plant species (Figure 3A). The deduced amino acid
sequence of OsCYP2 displayed higher identity with the
cyclophilins of three cereal crops, T. aestivum, Zea mays
and Sorghum bicolor (86% each), while OsCYP2 showed
relatively lower identity with three cyclophilins of Arabidopsis, including AtCYP19-2 (78%), AtCYP20-2 (63%)
and AtCYP20-3 (58%). Moreover, a closer relationship
between OsCYP2 and the cyclophilins of three cereal
crops was observed compared to Arabidopsis (Figure 3B).

in relation to non-treated. Data represent the average of four
treatments (mean ± S.E.). Identical letters above a pair of bars
indicate that the values are not significantly different at the p = 0.05
level according to Duncan’s multiple range test.

To understand the response of transgenic rice seedlings
with OsCYP2 overexpression to salt stress, we introduced this gene into wild-type rice (O. sativa cv. Aichi
ashahi) to obtain T3 transgenic seedlings with single
copy insertion (Additional file 3). Ten-day-old transgenic and wild-type seedlings were treated with 200 mM
NaCl. After 5 days, leaves of wild-type seedlings exhibited the chlorotic phenotype, and in some cases died,
whereas leaves of the transgenic seedlings remained
green (Figure 4A). Similar phenotypes were observed in
three-week-old wild type and transgenic seedlings treated with 150 mM NaCl for 7 d under water culture
(Additional file 4). Significantly, two transgenic lines
(OE1and OE2) showed OsCYP2 overexpression under
normal condition compared to wild-type (Figure 4B, C).
Although OsCYP2 expression was inhibited in two
transgenic lines and was induced in wild type under salt
stress, salt-stressed seedlings of two transgenic lines
showed close or higher levels of OsCYP2 expression to
or than that of wild type (Figure 4C). Similarly, two
transgenic lines showed higher levels of PPIase activity
under normal condition compared to wild type. Saltstressed seedlings of wild type exhibited higher level of
PPIase activity than unstressed seedlings, while no significant changes in levels of PPIase activity were found
between salt-stressed and unstressed seedlings of two
transgenic lines. Salt-stressed seedlings of two transgenic
lines still kept close or higher levels of PPIase activity to
or than that of wild type (Figure 4D). The addition of
CsA significantly suppressed the PPIase activity of wild
type and two transgenic lines (Figure 4D). Therefore, it

was suggested that OsCYP2 was likely to play an important role in the response of rice seedlings to salt stress.

OsCYP2 over-expression protected the photosynthetic
components in rice leaves against oxidative stress.

Effect of salt stress on maximal photochemical efficiency
(Fv/Fm) of OsCYP2 transgenic rice seedlings

Effect of salt stress on lipid peroxidation and ROS
scavenging in OsCYP2 transgenic rice seedlings

Based on the observation that the OsCYP2-transgenic
seedlings retained green color in their leaves, we speculated that OsCYP2 was likely to protect the photosynthetic components in rice leaves from oxidative stress
caused by salt. We compared the effects of salt stress on
the maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) in
OsCYP2 transgenic and wild-type seedlings. Salt stress
significantly reduced the Fv/Fm in wild-type seedlings,
but no significant change was observed in Fv/Fm for
OsCYP2 transgenic seedlings (Figure 5), suggesting that

To further validate the protective effects of OsCYP2 on the
photosynthesis machinery in rice leaves, we compared salt
stress-induced changes in the lipid peroxidation product
(MDA) and ROS scavenging in OsCYP2-transgenic and
wild-type seedlings. The level of MDA in plant tissues was
used as an indicator of lipid peroxidation [11]. Under normal conditions (no NaCl treatment), the MDA levels were
lower in OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings than in wild-type
seedlings (Figure 6A). By comparison, under salt stress
(200 mM NaCl), the MDA levels were significantly

OsCYP2 with cyclophilins of various plant species by the Jalview multiple alignment editor. Seven residues (His-61, Arg-62, Phe-67, Gln-118, Phe120, Trp-128 and His-33) associated with PPIase catalysis are marked by filled triangle (▲). Three of these, His-61, Arg-62 and Phe-120, are

MDA levels increased in wild-type seedlings (Figure 6A),
indicating that OsCYP2 over-expression could decrease
lipid peroxidation levels in transgenic rice seedlings.
Stress-induced H 2 O 2 accumulation could increase
lipid peroxidation [12]. Under normal conditions,
OsCYP2-transgenic rice seedlings contained lower H2O2

levels than wild-type seedlings. At 24 h after treatment
with 200 mM NaCl, each type of seedlings exhibited a
decrease in H2O2 levels (Figure 6B). Similarly, the H2O2
levels in OsCYP2-transgenic rice seedlings were lower
than that in wild-type seedlings.
Accumulation of H2O2 was accompanied by changes
in ROS scavenging enzyme activities [13,14]. Here, we

Expression pattern of OsCYP2 in hybrid rice seedlings

To better understand OsCYP2 function, we utilized RTPCR to detect temporal and spatial expression patterns of
OsCYP2 in hybrid rice seedlings. Based on the data in Figure 7A, it appeared that the OsCYP2 expression in roots
was less than that in shoots. OsCYP2 expression was
strongly induced by salt stress (Figure 7B). At different
time points (0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h) after salt treatment
(100 mM NaCl), OsCYP2 exhibited circadian rhythm
expression as time went. Maximal OsCYP2 expression
occurred at 3 h in Shanyou 10 seedlings and at 6 h in
Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, whereas minimal OsCYP2
expression occurred at 12 h in Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings (Figure 7B). Another peak of OsCYP2
expression appeared at 24 h in Shanyou 10 seedlings but
not significantly in Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. Interestingly,
Shanyou 10 seedlings showed higher maximal OsCYP2
expression than Liangyoupeijiu seedlings (Figure 7B). In
addition to salt stress, OsCYP2 expression was affected by
other types of stresses-PEG, heat, cold, or ABA. In Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings, OsCYP2 expression
was induced by PEG and heat but inhibited by cold (Figure 7C). ABA slightly induced expression in Shanyou 10

Figure 6 Comparison of lipid peroxidation and ROS scavenging of OsCYP2-transgenic rice seedlings and wild-type seedlings under
salt stress. OsCYP2-transgenic rice seedlings had lower malonaldehyde (MDA) content and H2O2 and higher antioxidant enzyme activities than
wild-type seedlings. Ten-day-old rice seedlings were treated with 200 mM NaCl for 24 h. The levels of MDA (A) and H2O2 (B) were determined
with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and ferric-xylenol orange complex, respectively. The activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD (C), CAT (D), and APX
(E) were assayed. Each value was the mean ± S.E. of four treatments.

seedlings but inhibited expression in Liangyoupeijiu seedlings. Generally, Shanyou 10 seedlings showed higher
OsCYP2 expression than Liangyoupeijiu seedlings under
the above mentioned stresses.

Discussion
The amino acid sequence alignment shows that OsCYP2
is likely to have peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase
or rotamase) activity, which catalyzes the cis-trans

isomerization of the amide bond between a proline residue
and the preceding residue, and functions as a molecular
chaperone involved in protein folding, and refolding of
denatured proteins. OsCYP2 possesses seven residues,
including His-61, Arg-62, Phe-67, Gln-118, Phe-120, Trp128 and His-33 that show to be associated with PPIase
catalysis. Three of these, including His-61, Arg-62 and
Phe-120, are most essential for PPIase activity of OsCYP2.
The residue Trp-128 is a site binding to cyclosporin A.

Figure 7 Expression of OsCYP2 in hybrid rice seedlings. (A) West blot showed expression of OsCYP2 in roots and shoots in 10-day-old rice
seedlings. (B) RT-PCR showed time-course expression of OsCYP2 in seedlings of rice hybrid varieties, Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu, treated
with 100 mM NaCl. (C) RT-PCR showed expression of OsCYP2 in hybrid seedlings under various stresses. Conc.: non-treated controls. Salt:
100 mM NaCl at 25°C for 3 h. PEG: 20% (w/v) PEG at 25°C for 3 h. Heat: 45°C for 3 h. Cold treatment: 4°C for 3 h. ABA: 50 mM ABA at 25°C for
3 h. Expression of OsCYP2 in hybrid rice seedlings was analyzed by RT-PCR. Actin (Os03g0718100) was used as an internal standard.

Seven residues were also found in AtCYP20-2 that had the
PPIase activity. In our study, two transgenic lines with
OsCYP2 overexpression maintain higher levels of total
PPIase activity compared to wild type. The addition of
CsA is able to reduce total PPIase activity of both wild
type and two transgenic lines. Although it has been
demonstrated by heterologous expression that OsCYP2

possessed PPIase activity [9], our findings provide powerful evidence at in vivo level to validate it.
The mechanisms of plant response or tolerance to salt
stress can fall into three categories: tolerance to osmotic
stress, Na+ exclusion from leaf blades and tissue tolerance [15]. Osmotic stress response is the first phase that
plant responds to salt stress, resulting in the decrease in

Ruan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/34

the rate of leaf growth and rate of photosynthesis. The
reduced rate of photosynthesis accelerates the formation
of ROS, and increases the activity of enzymes that
detoxify ROS [16,17]. These enzymes include SOD,
APX, CAT, and the various peroxidases [16,18]. The
coordinated activity of the multiple forms of these
enzymes in the different cell compartments maintain a
balance between the rate of formation and removal of
ROS, and control H2O 2 at the levels required for cell
signaling. Ionic stresses occur at a later stage, which
then leads to senescence of mature leaves. The main
site of Na + toxicity for most plants is the leaf blade,
where Na + accumulates after being deposited in the
transpiration stream rather than in the roots [19]. Most
Na + that is transported to the shoot remains in the
shoot, because for most plants, the movement of Na+
from the shoot to the roots in the phloem can likely
recirculate only a small amount of the Na+ that is transported to the shoot [15]. Therefore, Na+ accumulation
in the shoot is dependent on the net delivery of Na +
into the root xylem. Interestingly, several genes that are
involved in controlling the net delivery of Na+ into the
root xylem have been identified. The plasma membrane
Na+/H+ antiporter, SOS1, is expressed in stelar cells and
could be involved in the efflux of Na+ from stelar cells
into the xylem [15]. Meanwhile, SOS1 has also been
implicated in retrieval of Na + from the xylem [20].
Moreover, there is much evidence showing that some
members of the high-affinity K+ transporter (HKT) gene
family play important role in retrieval of Na + from
the xylem. AtHKT1;1, a member of Arabidopsis HKT
gene family, that is involved in the retrieval of Na+ from
the xylem before it reaches the shoot [15]. A similar
function for the closely related HKT1;5 gene family has
been identified in rice [3] and wheat [21-23]. Unlike
SOS1 or members of HKT gene family, OsCYP2,
encodes a rice cyclophilin, inferring that it is likely to
function as a molecular chaperone that is involved in
protein folding. Over-expression of OsCYP2 confers salt
tolerance in rice. However, higher leaf or root K+/Na+
ratio was not shown in OsCYP2 transgenic seedlings
under salt stress as compared to wild type (Additional
file 5), suggesting that OsCYP2 is not implicated in Na+
accumulation and transport in rice seedlings. Similarly,
OsCYP2 transgenic seedlings displayed lower free proline level than wild type (Additional file 6), indicating
that OsCYP2 does not play a role in osmotic protection
of rice seedlings against salt stress. Interestingly, wildtype seedlings exhibited a marked reduction in maximal
photochemical efficiency under salt stress, whereas no
such change was observed for OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings. OsCYP2-transgenic seedlings had lower levels of
lipid peroxidation products and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes than wild-type seedlings. However, no

Page 10 of 15

significant correlations were found between gene expression level and activity level of antioxidant enzymes
(Additional file 7, 8). It is suggested that H2O2 levels are
controlled by OsCYP2 up-regulating the activities of
SOD, CAT, and APX at post-translation level, not at
transcription level, thus resulting in reduced MDA level.
This, in turn, protected photosynthesis components of
rice leaves against oxidative stress by maintaining the
activity of PSII. Therefore, OsCYP2 may be a key regulator that controls ROS level by modulating activities of
antioxidant enzymes at translation level.
Here, our results show that OsCYP2 plays a key role
in preventing oxidative damage to photosystems. Generally, the two processes that avoid photoinhibition owing
to excess light are heat dissipation by the xanthophyll
pigments and electron transfer to oxygen acceptors
other than water. The latter response necessitates the
upregulation of key enzymes for regulating ROS levels
such as SOD, APX, CAT, and the various peroxidases
[16,18]. Obviously, the above knowledge leads us to
infer that OsCYP2 may be implicated in the process of
electron transfer to oxygen acceptors. However, sufficient evidence is still lacking, further studies are needed
to address this possibility.
In this study, OsCYP2 expression is induced by salt
stress. Interestingly, OsCYP2 shows circadian rhythm
expression as time goes. As a result, we speculate that
response of OsCYP2 to salt stress is likely to be regulated by circadian rhythm. Moreover, circadian rhythm
expression of OsCYP2 in Shanyou 10, a salt-tolerant
hybrid variety, occurs earlier than that in Liangyoupeijiu,
a salt-sensitive hybrid variety, suggesting earlier response
of OsCYP2 to salt stress is likely to be associated with
salt tolerance of rice seedlings. In addition to salt stress,
OsCYP2 expression is affected by other types of stresses-PEG, heat, or ABA induced expression in Shanyou
10 seedlings but inhibited expression in Liangyoupeijiu
seedlings. In addition, cold stress inhibits OsCYP2
expression in Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu seedlings.
These data suggest that OsCYP2 expression is not specific in salt stress, but is ubiquitous in the response of rice
seedlings to other types of stresses, including drought,
heat and cold. Importantly, the above conclusion is consistent with the previous findings that OsCYP2 can
respond to various stresses including high salt, drought,
heat, oxidative stress and hypoxia stress [9,24]. Therefore, we speculate that OsCYP2 may function as a key
integrator in response to multiple stresses.

Conclusions
Comparative proteomics identified a rice cyclophilin,
OsCYP2 that is up-regulated during salt-induced stress.
Over-expression of OsCYP2 confers salt tolerance in
rice. Under salt stress, OsCYP2 is likely to up-regulate

Ruan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/34

the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and
APX) at post-translation level to control H2 O2 levels,
resulting in reduced MDA levels, which may prevent
oxidative damage to photosystems. Unfortunately,
OsCYP2 is not implicated in Na + accumulation and
transport and osmotic protection in rice seedlings.
OsCYP2 expression is not only induced by salt stress,
but also regulated by circadian rhythm. Moreover,
OsCYP2 is also likely to act as a key component that is
involved in signal pathways of other type of stressesPEG, heat, cold, or ABA.

Methods
Plant material and salt treatment

Seeds of Shanyou 10 and Liangyoupeijiu were supplied
by the Wu Wang Nong Seed Group (Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China). Four replicates of 50 seeds for
each treatment of each genotype were placed in germination boxes (18 cm × 13 cm × 10 cm) containing two
layers of moistened blotters with 10 ml of 100 mM
NaCl. The seeds were germinated for 10 days at 25°C.
The NaCl solution was changed every day to maintain a
constant concentration of NaCl.

15 min at 15000 × g. The supernatant was collected in a
1.5-ml tube, and a 40 μl sample was taken to determine
the protein concentration. Protein concentration was
determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum
albumin as the standard.
2-D electrophoresis analysis

For analytical and preparative gels of 2-DE, 120 μg and
300 μg of shoot proteins were loaded onto a single IPG
gel strip (170 mm, pH 5-8 or pH 7-10, Bio-Rad, USA),
respectively. IEF was carried out using the PROTEAN
IEF system (Bio-Rad). IPG strips were rehydrated in
rehydration buffer (8M urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (v/
v) Ampholine (pH 3-10), 50 mM DTT and protein samples) for 12 h at 50 V. IEF was performed in three steps:
250 V for 15 min, 10000 V for 5 h and then for a total
of 60000 Vh at 10000 V. The gel strips were equilibrated in two steps: 6 ml equilibration buffer I (6 M
urea, 2% SDS, 0.375 M Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol and 130 mM DTT) for 10 min and 6 ml equilibration buffer II (buffer I lacking DTT but containing
135 mM iodoacetamide) for 10 min.
Image and data analysis

Relative biomass and length of rice seedlings

Four replicates of 10 fresh shoots or 10 fresh roots of
10-day-old seedlings for each treatment of each genotype were weighed. These shoots or roots were then
oven dried at 70°C until they reached a constant dry
weight (DW) [25]. The lengths of 10 shoots or 10 roots
from the four replicates of 10-day-old seedlings for each
treatment of each cultivar were measured. The distance
from the basal part of shoot to tip of the longest leaf
was calculated as the length of seedling. The standard
error (SE) on the mean fresh weight (FW), dry weight
(DW) or length of shoot and root was calculated. The
percentage of relative FW, DW, or shoot/root length of
the salt treated samples was calculated in relation to
non-treated.

Silver-stained gels were scanned using a Microtek 6180
scanner at a resolution of 600 dots per inch (dpi), and
data were analyzed using PDQuest 8.0 software (BioRad). Specifically, gel image filter, spot detection, background subtraction and spot matching were performed.
Prior to spot matching among gel images, one gel image
was selected as a reference. After automatic matching,
the unmatched spots of the member gels were added to
the reference gel. The area of each spot was defined as
the sum of the intensities of all pixels that made up the
spot. To compare quantitative variations in intensity of
protein spots, the spot areas were normalized as a percentage of the total area in all of the spots present in
the gel. The resulting data from image analysis were
transferred to PDQuest 8.0 software for query protein
spots showing quantitative or qualitative variations.

Protein extraction

The shoots of 10-day-old rice seedlings were harvested.
1 g FW of shoots were ground in liquid nitrogen and
suspended in 5 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in
acetone with 0.07% (w/v) b-mercaptoethanol at -20°C
for 1 h, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 35000
× g. The pellets were resuspended in acetone with 0.07%
(w/v) b-mercaptoethanol and incubated at -20°C for 1 h
and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C. This step was
repeated three times, and the pellets were lyophilized.
The crude protein power was solubilized in lysis buffer
(8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% Ampholine
(pH 3-10), 50 mM DTT, and 1 mM PMSF) for 1 h at
room temperature, followed by centrifugation for

In-gel digestion, MALDI-TOF MS, and ESI-MS/MS analysis

In-gel digestion of proteins was performed as described
[26] with some modifications. Protein spots were excised
from the preparative gels and washed twice with Milli-Q
water, and then were destained twice for 5 min with 200 μl
of freshly prepared equi-volume solution of 100 mM
Na2S2O3 and 30 mM K3Fe(CN)6. The samples were washed
twice for 5 min with Milli-Q water and were cut into
pieces, dried in a vacuum system, and then digested overnight at 37°C with 10 μg/ml sequencing-grade modified
trypsin (Roche, Germany) in 25 mM NH4HCO3. The peptide mixtures were extracted with 40 μl 0.5% trifluoroacetic
acid for 1 h at 40°C, 40 μl 0.25% trifluoroacetic acid in

Ruan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/34

50% ACN for 1 h at 30°C, and 25 μl ACN for 5 min,
respectively. All three extracts for each sample were combined and lyophilized. The resulting lyophilized tryptic
peptides were dissolved in 5 mg/ml a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) containing 50% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. MS analysis of tryptic peptides was
performed using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer
(reflex; Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The peptide calibration standard “mono” (Bruker Daltonics) was used for
internal calibration to ensure the accuracy of protein identification. Masslynx software (version 3.5) was used for
peak-picking. The S/N of peaks was set at three. Peaks
below 1000 m/z were ignored. Mass range was from 1000
up to 4000 m/z. Resolution was set at 10000. The PMF
data were analyzed using MASCOT searching tools (version 1.9, http://www.matrixscience.com Matrix Science,
London, UK). NCBInr (version 20050513) and rice were
selected as the database and taxonomy, respectively. All
peptide masses were assumed to be monoisotopic and [M
+H]+. Modifications of carbamidomethylation and oxidation were considered. The mass accuracy was set at ± 100
ppm, and the maximum number of missed cleavages was
set at one. The identified protein had to have the top
MASCOT score and ≥ 4 matched peptides. The coverage
of the protein by the matching peptides was > 10%. Protein scores that were obtained from the analysis with Mascot software indicated the probability of a true positive
identification (p < 0.05) and must be at least 60.
Several tryptic peptides of interest were analyzed using
ESI MS/MS. Raw MS/MS data were processed using
MaxEnt software (version 3) which performed peak list
geneation. MASCOT search engine (version 1.9, http://
www.matrixscience.com; Matrix Science, London, UK)
was used for all MS/MS ions search. NCBInr (version
20050513) and rice were selected as the database and
taxonomy, respectively. All peptide masses were
assumed to be monoisotopic and [M+H]+. Cysteine carbamidomethylation and methionine oxidation were
selected as variable modifications. One missing cleavage
was allowed. Precursor error tolerance was set to
<0.2 Da and MS/MS fragment error tolerance < 0.2 Da.
The identified protein should have at least two peptides
matched and individual ions scores greater than 38 with
expected value < 0.05. Maximal number of protein
entries was set at five. Cut-off score for accepting individual MS/MS spectra was set at zero.
Gene cloning and transformation

The OsCYP2 coding region was obtained by RT-PCR
amplification with the following primers: OsCYP2-F, 5’TCTAGAATGTCGAACACGAGGGTGTT-3’; OsCYP2R, 5’-GGTACCCTAGGAGAGCTGGCCGCAGT-3’.
PCR products were recovered with a glass milk kit (BioDev Company, Beijing, China). Recovered fragments

Page 12 of 15

were ligated into the PMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan).
The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli
DH5a competent cells (TaKaRa, Japan). Twenty positive
colonies were selected and identified by PCR. The positive plasmids extracted from these colonies were
digested with EcoRI or PstI (TaKaRa, Japan) to confirm
that target fragments were inserted into PMD18-T, and
then positive plasmids were sequenced using an ABI
3700 (ABI, USA).
Each correct PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and
KpnI and inserted into the binary vector pCAMBIA1300based super promoter [27]. Agrobacterium strain EHA105
was introduced into rice (O. sativa cv. Aichi ashahi) using
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [28,29]. A total of
120 lines of hygromycin- resistant (1 μg/ml) transgenic
plants were selected, and their T3 plants were analyzed for
phenotypic changes under salt stress.
Phenotypic analysis of OsCYP2 transgenic seedlings under
salt stress

Three replicates of 50 T3-transgenic rice seeds with a
single copy insertion of hygr+ (Additional file 3) or wildtype seeds were placed in germination boxes (18 cm ×
13 cm × 10 cm) containing two layers of blotters moistened with distilled water. The boxes were then transferred to the chamber, and seeds were germinated at
25°C under 16 h light/8 h dark at an illumination intensity of 60 mmol m -2 s -1 for 10 days. Transgenic and
wild-type seedlings were transferred to germination
boxes (18 cm × 13 cm × 10 cm) containing two layers
of blotters moistened with 200 mM NaCl solution or
distilled water. After 5 days, the phenotypes of seedlings
were observed and photographed using a digital camera.
Assay of maximal photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm)

Chlorophyll fluorescence was determined with chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system (IMAGING PAM;
Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). To measure the maximal quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), rice seedlings
were dark-adapted for 30 min. The measured light
intensity for normal light and saturating light were 1
and 10, respectively. Fv/Fm was also measured by FMS2 pulse amplitude fluorimeter (Hansatech Instruments
Ltd., Kings Lynn, Norfolk, UK). Rice seedlings were
maintained in darkness for 30 min before measurement
of Fv/Fm. Minimal fluorescence (Fo) was measured
under a weak pulse of modulating light over a 0.8-s period, and maximal fluorescence (Fm) was obtained after a
saturating pulse of 0.7 s at 8000 μmol m-2 s-1.
Antioxidant enzyme extraction and activity assay

For the enzyme assays, 0.5 g FW of shoots were ground
with 3 ml of ice-cold 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.8) containing 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM ascorbate

Ruan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/34

acid (AsA) and 2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone. The suspensions were centrifuged at 4°C for 20 min at 12,000 ×
g, and the resulting supernatants were used to determine
enzymatic activity. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity
was assayed by measuring the ability to inhibit the
photochemical reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)
as described [30]. Catalase (CAT) activity was measured
as the decline in absorbance at 240 nm due to the
decrease of extinction of H2O2 as described [31]. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) was measured by the decrease in
absorbance at 290 nm as described [32].
Determination of MDA and H2O2 content in rice shoots

Lipid peroxidation was measured as the amount of malondialdehyde (MDA) determined by the TBA reaction as
described [33]. Shoot samples (0.5 g) were homogenized
in 3 ml of 50 mM PBS (pH 7.8) containing 2% (v/v)
polyvinylpyrrolidone, and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g
for 20 min. Three ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid
containing 0.6% (w/v) TBA was added to 1 ml of the
supernatant aliquot. The mixture was heated at 100°C for
30 min and then quickly cooled in an ice bath. The mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and their
absorbance was measured at 532 nm. The value for nonspecific absorption at 600 nm was subtracted from the
532 nm reading. The MDA content was calculated using
its extinction coefficient of 155 mM-1 cm-1 and expressed
as μmol g-1 FW.
Plant tissue H 2 O 2 was extracted by cold acetone as
described [33]. Shoots (1 g FW) were homogenized in
5 ml cold acetone and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g
for 10 min. To 1 ml of the supernatant aliquot, 3 ml of
extract containing a 3:1 (v/v) ratio of CCl4 and CHCl3
and 5 ml of distilled water were added and mixed successively, and then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 1 min.
The supernatant was removed and tested for H 2 O 2 .
H2O2 content was determined by ferric-xylenol orange
complex as described [34].
Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans activity assay

Rice shoots (0.3 g FW) were homogenized in 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM EDTA, and centrifuged at 13000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. 50 μl supernatant
was used for peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase)
activity. PPIase activity was assayed in a coupled reaction with chymotrypsin, as described9 with some modifications. The assays were performed at 0°C for 120 s.
The 1 ml assay mixture contained 80 μM N-succinylala-ala-prophe-p-nitroanilidine (Sigma, USA) as test
peptide and assay buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0),
150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100], The reaction was
initiated by the addition of 100 μl chymotrypsin (5 mg/ml)
(Sigma, USA) and the change in absorbance at 390 nm
was monitored using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu

Page 13 of 15

UV2550). Cyclophilin associated PPIase activities were
determined by the extent of inhibition of reaction in the
presence of cyclosporin A (Sigma, USA). The inhibitor
was added to the assay mix 30 min before the start of the
reaction and incubated at 4°C.
Real-time PCR

Frozen leaf tissue was homogenized in liquid nitrogen
using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted using
Trizol according to the supplier’s recommendation (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Residual DNA was removed
with an RNase-free DNase (Fermentas, EU). One microgram total RNA was reverse-transcribed using 0.5 μg of
Oligo (dT) 20 and 200 units of ReverTra Ace (TOYOBO,
Japan) following the supplier’s recommendation. Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Opticon 2
Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). PCRs were performed using the SYBR Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad). The PCR conditions consisted of 40
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 59°C
for 45 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s. A dissociation
curve was generated at the end of each PCR cycle to verify
that a single product was amplified using software provided with the Opticon 2 Real-time PCR Detection System. To minimize sample variations, mRNA expression of
the target gene was normalized relative to the expression
of the housekeeping gene actin. All experiments were
repeated three times for cDNA prepared for two samples.
The quantification of mRNA levels is based on the method
of Livak and Schmittgen (2001). The threshold cycle (Ct)
value of actin (Os03g0718100) as internal standard was
subtracted from that of the gene of interest to obtain a
ΔCt value. The Ct value of untreated control sample was
subtracted from the ΔCt value to obtain a ΔΔCt value.
The fold changes in expression level relative to the control
were expressed as 2 -ΔΔCt. The following primers were
designed for gene-specific transcript amplification:
OsCYP2-F: 5’-GCCTTTCGCCAGTATCAGTC-3’, OsCYP2-R: 5’-CAGATCCAACTCCACCGAAT-3’; Actin-F:
5’-GACCTTGCTGGGCGTGAT-3’, Actin-R: 5’-GTCATAGTCCAGGGCGATGT-3’.
Preparation of antiserum and western blot analysis

According to the OsCYP2 amino acid sequence, the
peptide fragment 44-KGVGKSGKPLHYKG-57 was
determined as a protein-surface antigen. The peptide
containing an additional N-terminal cysteine was
synthesized and purified on a resin. The purified peptide
was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits
(HuaAn Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China).
Rice shoots (0.5 g FW) were ground into a fine powder in
liquid nitrogen and then added to 2 ml of protein extraction
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA,
10 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol,

Ruan et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:34
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/34

0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM DTT and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100,
and ground until shoot power was well homogenized. The
mixtures were centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at 14,000 × g,
and the supernatant was transferred into a 5-ml centrifuge
tube. The protein concentration was determined using the
RC DC protein assay kit II (Bio-Rad, USA). Total protein
(20 μg) from each sample was subjected to electrophoresis
on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins in the gel were transferred to PVDF membranes by an electric transforming system, and the membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim
milk. The blot was incubated with the rabbit antiserum
raised against OsCYP2 diluted 1:1000 in TBST containing
25 mM Tris base pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl and
0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h and washed three times for
5 min each in TBST (Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20). The
blot was then probed with the secondary antibody (HRPlabeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)) diluted 1:5000, and the
reactive band was visualized using ECL (Multiscience
Biotech Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China).
Statistical analysis

The experimental design was set up with genotypes as
main plots and treatments as subplots. The treatment
combinations were completely randomized with respect
to the placement of the germination boxes in a germination chamber with five layers of rack for each genotype.
Three replications of the experiment were conducted on
different dates. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted by Duncan’s multiple range test. Before analysis
of variance, percentages were transformed according to
y = arcsin[sqr(x/100)]. All data were analyzed according
to a factorial model and replicates as random effects.
Means were compared among treatments by LSD (least
significant difference) at 0.05 confidence level.
