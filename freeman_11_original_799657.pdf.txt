LETTER TO THE EDITOR

Open Access

Original observations of Desmozoon
lepeophtherii, a microsporidian hyperparasite
infecting the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus
salmonis, and its subsequent detection by other
researchers
Mark A Freeman1* and Christina Sommerville2

Abstract
A microsporidian hyperparasite, Desmozoon lepeophtherii, of the parasitic copepod Lepeophtheirus salmonis (salmon
louse), infecting farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), was first discovered in the west of Scotland in 2000. Heavily
infected salmon lice are easily recognised as they have large opaque inclusions distributed throughout the body.
The prevalence of salmon lice with visible signs of microsporidiosis can be up to 10% of the population from
certain farm sites. The microsporidian was also isolated from the host Atlantic salmon suggesting it may have a
two host life cycle. The authors believe that the infection in immunocompetent salmon may be latent, becoming
acute during periods of infection with another pathogen or during sexual maturation. Since its first discovery in
Scotland, Desmozoon lepeophtherii has been subsequently reported from Norway, and more recently from the
Pacific coast of North America.
Keywords: Desmozoon, Paranucleospora, Lepeophtheirus, Microsporidian, Copepod, opportunistic, Immunocompromised, Grilse

Background
The microsporidian hyperparasite Desmozoon
lepeophtherii was originally discovered in Scotland during a PhD programme carried out at the Institute of
Aquaculture, University of Stirling, between October
1998 and September 2002. The primary objective of the
research was to screen parasitic copepods (salmon lice)
infecting farmed and wild Atlantic salmon for potential
microbial candidates that could be evaluated for use in
alternative control strategies. The study was jointly
funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC) and the Scottish Salmon
Growers Association (SSGA), now the Scottish Salmon
Producers’ Organisation (SSPO).

Original discovery of a hyperparasitic microsporidian
from Lepeophtheirus salmonis

A microsporidian was first isolated from the salmon
louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, infecting farmed Atlantic
salmon from Western Scotland in December 2000 [1].
The characteristic gross pathology observed in microsporidian-infected salmon lice had, however, been
observed during previous lice collections from farmed
salmon in 1999 and early 2000, but was not confirmed
as a microsporidian hyperparasite until December 2000
[1]. Lepeophtheirus salmonis exhibiting the clinical signs
of microsporidiosis, i.e. numerous opaque internal inclusions distributed throughout the body, were found at
three of fifteen farm sites sampled between 13/10/1998
and 15/05/2002 [1]. The number of L. salmonis infected
with the microsporidian per farm site varied between
1% and 10%, with an average of 5% of adult female L.
salmonis having the microsporidian infection when present at the farm site. Infection with the microsporidian

in female salmon lice was often associated with poorly
developed or aborted egg strings [1,2]. When the microsporidian was present in adult female L. salmonis, adult
male lice from the same population were also infected
with a similar prevalence [1]. One site that was known
to harbour microsporidian-infected L. salmonis was
sampled 17 times over a 22 month period, but no clear
seasonal trend in occurrence emerged [1]. However, the
maximum percentage prevalence of 10% was considered
to be a conservative estimate as it only included L. salmonis that were showing visible signs of infection, and
many more lice may have had less advanced infections.
As heavily infected L. salmonis showed advanced signs
of pathology, such as the inability to produce viable egg
strings, a patent application was made in 2001. The
patent “Microbiological control of sea lice” United Kingdom patent GB2371053, international patent PCT/
GB02/00134 included the microsporidian among other
candidates for use in alternative control strategies for
sea lice.
The microsporidian was initially characterised using
both molecular and ultrastructural studies which were
documented in the PhD thesis, completed in 2002 [1].
Subsequently, the molecular identification of the microsporidian was published in a peer reviewed journal article in 2003 [2] and the partial ribosomal DNA sequence
data (1411 bp including the ITS region) was deposited
in GenBank (Feb 2002) with the accession number
AJ431366. The ultrastructure, including a full taxonomic
description of the new genus and species, Desmozoon
lepeophtherii, followed in another peer reviewed article
in 2009 [3] with specimens collected during January
2001, consisting of two EM grids showing spores and
developmental stages deposited as hapanotypes in the
Natural History Museum, London.
Once the molecular identification had been completed, and the microsporidian from L. salmonis was
shown to be related to the salmonid microsporidian
parasite Nucleospora salmonis, farmed Atlantic salmon
from the same farm location were tested using a specific
PCR for the presence of the microsporidian parasite.
The microsporidian DNA was successfully amplified
from four fish kidney tissues and a contiguous sequence
of 860 bp, including the ITS region, was constructed.
This sequence matched the original salmon lice
sequence, commencing from base 260 to base 1120, and
shared 99.4% similarity, differing in only 5 bases and
was considered to be from the same microsporidian
parasite [1]. Additional Atlantic salmon from the same
farm site (those with two or more visibly infected salmon lice) were further sampled for the microsporidian,
which was successfully detected from the kidney, liver,
heart, gill and peripheral blood mononucleocytes [1].

DNA sequencing of these samples showed 100% identity
with the 860 bp of data from the first four fish kidneys.
Desmozoon lepeophtherii, from the type location in
Scotland, was resampled from L. salmonis and resequenced in early 2010 to resolve the minor differences
seen between the original sequence from L. salmonis
and the subsequent one obtained from Atlantic salmon
tissues. The new sequence, compiled from four infected
L. salmonis, extended the original 1411 bp of data to
include the complete small subunit (16S) to 1787 bp.
During this sequence update in March 2010, it became
clear that the initial sequence obtained from L. salmonis
contained some very minor sequencing errors, and the
correct sequence was the one reported from Atlantic
salmon in the PhD study [1]. These minor sequencing
errors (9 bases of 1411 (0.64%)) in the initial sequence
were attributed to the relative lack of experience of the
PhD student (MAF), at the time, in using slab gel DNA
sequencers.
Discovery of Desmozoon lepeophtherii in Norway

Shortly after the formal description of Desmozoon
lepeophtherii from L. salmonis in Scotland had been
published in 2009 [3], a new microsporidian genus and
species description, Paranucleospora theridion, infecting
both L. salmonis and Atlantic salmon from Norway, was
published in 2010 [4]. In this publication the authors
mentioned the microsporidian DNA sequence obtained
from Scottish L. salmonis in 2003, but surprisingly failed
to include it in their phylogenetic analyses. However,
they concluded that the microsporidian from Scottish L.
salmonis was “now identified with P. theridion“ and
claimed it to be a synonym. The present authors
assumed that this had been a timing oversight, by the
Norwegian group, due to the fairly recent publication of
the D. lepeophtherii description [3]. Yet, a second manuscript on the same microsporidian from Norway, by the
same group, was published in 2011 [5], which also failed
to recognise the validity of the D. lepeophtherii publication. In that manuscript, they refer to an earlier publication naming P. theridion [6], which predates the D.
lepeophtherii publication [3], and claimed that P. theridion was the first published name for this parasite, to
endorse their continued use of the name in the 2011
manuscript [5]. The publication they refer to [6] is an
article in a non peer-reviewed ‘popular scientific journal’
(Pers. Comm. Christine Elgen; Naturen), hence not
appropriate for the naming of a novel scientific species.
Furthermore, the article in question did not actually
attempt to describe the microsporidian or even mention
it as a new species, but did refer to it as P. theridion,
and cite the forthcoming descriptive manuscript [4] as
‘submitted’.

Discovery of Desmozoon lepeophtherii in the Pacific

In a recent study of sea lice from the Pacific coast of
North America, three different microsporidian parasites
were sampled and identified using partial ribosomal
DNA sequences and ultrastructural studies [7]. One,
exclusively isolated from L. salmonis on cultured Atlantic salmon, was identified as Desmozoon lepeophtherii
and is the first report of D. lepeophtherii from the Pacific Ocean. The other two microsporidians were not
restricted to L. salmonis and were found in other parasitic copepods sampled from different fish. They clustered
within a clade of microsporidians that infect other crustacean hosts and were not closely related to D.
lepeophtherii and the Enterocytozoonidae. Desmozoon
lepeophtherii occurred only in L. salmonis from cultured
Atlantic salmon and was not found in other
Lepeophtheirus spp. and no evidence of D. lepeophtherii
was observed in the salmon host [7]
Pathology of Desmozoon lepeophtherii in Atlantic salmon

During the original discovery of D. lepeophtherii
(between 1999 and 2002) from L. salmonis on farmed
Atlantic salmon in Scotland, and its subsequent isolation
from fish tissues, no new epizootics were apparent and
no unexplained increases in fish mortalities were
reported. Fish that were confirmed as positive for the
presence of the microsporidian using diagnostic PCRs
appeared externally normal except for an occasional
mild gill pallor. However, the kidneys of some fish,
which were confirmed as strongly positive with the diagnostic PCR, were moderately enlarged and discoloured
to a greenish-grey and contained numerous white flecks.
Histopathology of the kidney tissue showed moderate
hyperplasia in the renal interstitium, with numerous
mitotically active immature white blood cells. Heart tissue showed endocardial activation and hyperplasia with
the occasional hypertrophy of myocardial nuclei. Other
tissues appeared normal except for the occasional reticular cell proliferation of ellipsoids in the spleen [1]. It
was also reported that the microsporidian was far more
readily detected (strongly positive in diagnostic PCRs) in
fish showing secondary sexual characteristics (grilse),
suggesting that grilse fish were more heavily infected
with the microsporidian [1].
Nylund et al. [4] state that D. lepeophtherii has been
associated with up to 80% mortality in commercial
farms producing Atlantic salmon in Norway, but, unfortunately, do not include any supporting data. In addition, they suggest that D. lepeophtherii is associated with
the disease conditions proliferative gill inflammation
(PGI), pancreas disease (PD), heart and skeletal muscle
inflammation (HSMI), and cardiac myopathy syndrome
(CMS) in Atlantic salmon [4]. But, the following year,
Nylund et al. [5] report that D. lepeophtherii only

Page 3 of 4

appears as a possible primary agent in cases with high
mortality in connection with PGI, and not the other
conditions, which all occurred in the absence of D.
lepeophtherii [5].
In higher vertebrates, microsporidian and other fungal
infections as primary pathogens are largely asymptomatic and typically result in few clinical signs; exposure
to microsporidia in humans is common and chronic
microsporidiosis is not linked to any clinical manifestation in healthy individuals [8]. However, microsporidia
are known to be opportunistic parasites that can proliferate considerably at times when the host is immunosuppressed due to existing conditions such as HIV/
AIDS and others [9]. As such they can be considered to
be latent parasites that opportunistically use periods of
host immunosuppression to proliferate, causing the diseased condition microsporidiosis [8,10]. We believe that
a similar situation exists with D. lepeophtherii infection
in Atlantic salmon. Desmozoon lepeophtherii may be a
common microsporidian parasite of farmed Atlantic salmon with only chronic or even latent infection levels in
the fish host, resulting in no obvious clinical signs.
However, like other microsporidian parasites, D.
lepeophtherii is highly opportunistic in nature and can
proliferate to cause acute disease, with associated clinical
signs, when the host is immunocompromised. Therefore, during the onset of other diseases, such as heart
and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), pancreas disease (PD), proliferative gill inflammation (PGI) and cardiac myopathy syndrome (CMS), it is likely that a latent
microsporidian parasite will multiply and cause additional clinical signs or exacerbate the ones associated
with the primary pathogen. Furthermore, during the original description of D. lepeophtherii, it was reported that
infection rates seemed to be far higher in grilse salmon
[1]. Grilse salmon are known to be far more susceptible
to certain parasitic infections such as Kudoa thyrsites,
where infection rates in grilse fish may reach 70% but
are below 10% in non-sexually maturing fish [11].
Therefore, it is possible that the immunosuppression
associated with sexual maturation in salmonid fish may
predispose them to infection and allow opportunistic
latent parasites to become problematic and cause complicated multifactorial etiologies for some disease
conditions.

Conclusion
Desmozoon lepeophtherii is the valid name for the
microsporidian parasite (Family: Enterocytozoonidae)
found infecting both L. salmonis and Atlantic salmon in
Northern Europe and the North Pacific. This formal
binominal nomenclature was assigned in a peerreviewed publication and published in 2009 [3], before
the Norwegian description of P. theridion in 2010 [4].

http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/231

The earlier publication, in the non peer-reviewed popular journal, Naturen [6], cannot be considered to be a
valid description, as suggested by Nylund et al. 2011 [5].
Desmozoon lepeophtherii is therefore the senior synonym and is registered on the World Register of Marine
Species (WoRMS) as such, with Paranucleospora theridion noted as a junior synonymised taxon. http://www.
marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id = 565086
Nylund et al. [4] described the parasite as having two
cycles of development in the Atlantic salmon and one in
the salmon louse. Transmission mechanisms between
Atlantic salmon and L. salmonis have not been identified but both hosts are thought to be involved in the life
cycle [4]. It is very interesting that D. lepeophtherii has
been reported from the Pacific and that it has only been
found infecting L. salmonis from farmed Atlantic salmon. Lepeophtheirus salmonis from the Pacific are
believed to be genetically different from L. salmonis in
the Atlantic and they are suggested to have independently co-evolved with Pacific and Atlantic salmonids
respectively, showing a level of genetic divergence consistent with an independent evolution over the last 2.511 million years [12]. Therefore, it would be extremely
interesting to know whether Atlantic salmon, that were
introduced to the Pacific for aquaculture purposes,
arrived with asymptomatic D. lepeophtherii infections
and were able to infect native (Pacific) L. salmonis
populations that presumably had not been infected by
D. lepeophtherii for millions of years, or if the infected
salmon lice in the Pacific are ‘Atlantic’ L. salmonis.
