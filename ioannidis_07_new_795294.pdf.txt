Abstract
Background: The annotated genomes of two closely related strains of the intracellular bacterium
Wolbachia pipientis have been reported without the identifications of the putative origin of
replication (ori). Identifying the ori of these bacteria and related alpha-Proteobacteria as well as their
patterns of sequence evolution will aid studies of cell replication and cell density, as well as the
potential genetic manipulation of these widespread intracellular bacteria.
Results: Using features that have been previously experimentally verified in the alphaProteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus, the origin of DNA replication (ori) regions were identified
in silico for Wolbachia strains and eleven other related bacteria belonging to Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and
Rickettsia genera. These features include DnaA-, CtrA- and IHF-binding sites as well as the flanking
genes in C. crescentus. The Wolbachia ori boundary genes were found to be hemE and COG1253
protein (CBS domain protein). Comparisons of the putative ori region among related Wolbachia
strains showed higher conservation of bases within binding sites.
Conclusion: The sequences of the ori regions described here are only similar among closely
related bacteria while fundamental characteristics like presence of DnaA and IHF binding sites as
well as the boundary genes are more widely conserved. The relative paucity of CtrA binding sites
in the ori regions, as well as the absence of key enzymes associated with DNA replication in the
respective genomes, suggest that several of these obligate intracellular bacteria may have altered
replication mechanisms. Based on these analyses, criteria are set forth for identifying the ori region
in genome sequencing projects.

Background

Wolbachia are Gram-negative, intracellular α-Proteobacteria that infect many invertebrates including terrestrial
crustaceans, mites, spiders and filarial nematodes [1-4].
Much of the success of Wolbachia can be attributed to the
diverse phenotypes they induce in hosts. These range from
classical mutualism to reproductive parasitism as characterized by the ability to override chromosomal sex determination, induce parthenogenesis, selectively kill males
and induce cytoplasmic incompatibility in early embryos
[2-4]. The unique biology of Wolbachia has attracted a
growing number of researchers interested in questions
ranging from the evolutionary implications of infection to
the use of this agent for pest and disease control [5-9].
These endosymbiotic bacteria are typically transmitted
through the eggs of their hosts and their replication rate is
regulated to avoid overgrowth prior to host reproduction
[2-4]. The replication control mechanisms are not known
for this growth limitation. The intensity of Wolbachia's
effects has often been correlated with bacterial copy
number, as reported in different host species [10-13]. A
factor that may influence bacterial proliferation is the
organization of the ori region. Identifying the ori of these
bacteria is a key step in understanding the mechanisms of
bacterial replication and for developing methods for
genetic manipulation of these bacteria. Recently, the
closed and annotated genomes of two Wolbachia strains
have been reported [14,15]. However, neither of these
studies identified the putative origin of replication (ori)
for Wolbachia.
DNA replication in bacteria takes place by uncoiling the
double stranded helix and breaking the hydrogen bonds
between the complementary strands at a specific chromosomal locus, the ori region. Early events in DNA replication are subdivided into the following three steps: (i)
binding of the initiator proteins to sites located within the
ori region; (ii) local unwinding of the ori region; and (iii)
loading of the DNA helicase and other proteins required
to form the Y-shaped replication forks [16]. Typically, bacteria have a single ori region [17], although in some
prokaryotes two chromosomal ori regions were experimentally identified, probably reflecting a temporal mode
of DNA replication [18,19].
Chromosomal replication initiates at ori, proceeds bidirectionally and terminates when the replication forks
reach the termination site, terC (in the case of circular
chromosomes) or the chromosome ends (in the case of
linear chromosomes) [20]. The initiation of bacterial
chromosome replication is mediated by the DnaA protein, which binds to specific 9-mer cis-regulatory elements
called DnaA boxes located in the ori region. Usually,
about ten to twenty DnaA molecules bind to five DnaA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/182

boxes and promote unwinding of the AT-rich ori region.
The sequences of ori are conserved only among closely
related microorganisms and vary greatly in size (from
200–1000 bp) [17]. A common feature is the presence of
several DnaA boxes and an AT-rich region; a cluster of four
or more DnaA boxes is indicative of a functional origin of
replication [17]. In γ-Proteobacteria, the ori region is frequently located within the rnpA-rmpH-dnaA-dnaN-recFgyrB gene cluster and usually next to the dnaA gene [17],
with the Escherichia coli ori being the most thoroughly
studied [21,22].
The location of the ori region can be diverse across the bacterial lineages [23]. Among the α-Proteobacteria, which
includes Wolbachia, only the ori region of C. crescentus
(Cori) has been experimentally identified [24]. Independent methods have provided a consistent location for Cori
between hemE (CC3763) and a gene encoding a conserved hypothetical protein (CC0001) (in the present
study, this gene is referred to by its NCBI COG number,
COG1806) [24]. The hemE gene encodes for uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase – a component in heme biosynthesis, and the COG1806 gene has no known function but
contains the conserved domain of unknown function,
DUF299. The hemE/COG1806 boundary genes of Cori are
present in the sequenced genomes of several other α-Proteobacteria [25]. While Cori shows some apparent similarities with the E. coli ori such as a 40 bp AT-rich region,
presence of DnaA boxes and an IHF (integration host factor) binding site, it has an additional regulatory protein,
CtrA. CtrA is a global cell cycle regulator that controls 26%
of the transcripts that vary during the cell cycle [26]. In
vitro footprint experiments revealed five CtrA binding sites
within Cori, centered over the consensus TTAA-N7-TTAA
[27]. CtrA binding sites appear to be strategically organized spanning the entire length of Cori [24]. Phosphorylated CtrA binds two perfect or imperfect halves of the
recognition sequence, probably as a dimer and represses
chromosomal replication.
Comparison of over 30 bacterial genomes with Cori
reveals a noticeable conservation of binding sites and
flanking genes, although in some bacteria, chromosomal
rearrangements appear to have taken place (unpublished
observations). GC-skew analysis has also been used to
predict the origin of DNA replication [17,28-32], but it is
not a good universal predictor of the ori [33], and was not
predictive for the two annotated Wolbachia genomes
[14,15]. In contrast, for the closely related Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia, and Anaplasma, GC-skew has been used to
approximate the origin position in the chromosome more
reliably [34-36]. However, the actual shift can occur over
a fairly large region and thus this feature alone cannot
reveal the precise location for the ori region.

Given that GC-skew analysis was insufficient at predicting
the ori region in several α-Proteobacteria species, a different approach was developed. The origin of replication in
C. crescentus is located between orthologs of hemE
(CC_3763) and COG1806 (CC_0001), and it contains
five DnaA boxes, a single binding site for IHF and five
CtrA binding sites [37]. In Rickettsia prowazekii, the ori
region is also located between the hemE (RP_885) and
COG1806 orthologs [37].
The guidelines used by Brassinga et al. [37] for detecting
Cori were applied in the present study to identify the origin of DNA replication in Wolbachia and in ten closely
related α-Proteobacteria. Computational analyses indicate that the origin of DNA replication in the wMel and
wBm Wolbachia strains [14,15] lies between a gene encoding a cystathione-β-synthase (CBS) domain protein and
the Wolbachia hemE gene. The evidence relies mainly on
boundary gene recognition as well as DnaA-, CtrA- and
IHF-binding site identification, as described by [37]. Analysis of the corresponding sequences from an additional
fifty-one Wolbachia strains supports the predicted ori as
well as identifying frequent recombination at the edges of
the sequences. Using the same guidelines, the ori region
was also identified in the sequenced representatives of the
closely related Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia and Rickettsia.

Results
In silico prediction of the Wolbachia origin of replication
The origin of replication of C. crescentus is located between
orthologs of hemE (CC_3763) and a conserved hypothetical protein, COG1806, and contains DnaA, CtrA and IHF
binding sites [37]: In R. prowazekii, the ori region is also
located between the hemE (RP_885) and COG1806
orthologs.

Based on a slightly modified approach and findings of
Brassinga et al. [37], the Wolbachia ori was predicted in silico. Our approach was based on four criteria: (a) position
near either hemE or COG1806 orthologs; (b) an intergenic
region (that is, the putative ori region) containing an
appropriate number of binding sites for the DnaA, CtrA
and IHF factors; (c) genome-wide searches confirming
that no other appropriately sized intergenic region (>300
bp) contains a significant number of these three characteristic binding sites and (d) the AT-content of the predicted
origins that is higher than the average for the respective
genome.
First, the Wolbachia orthologs of hemE and COG1806
were searched in the recently published Wolbachia wMel
genome [15] and identified as the loci WD_1028 and
WD_0341, respectively. The great distance between the
two genes in Wolbachia (>600 kb) indicated no conserva-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/182

tion of the hemE-COG1806 region in Wolbachia. The lack
of conservation is most likely due to a single chromosomal rearrangement resulting in two possible locations
for ori: WD_0340-WD_0341 or WD_1027-WD_1028. The
first region is between the heme exporter WD_0340
(ccmC) and the COG1806 homolog (WD_0341). The second region is between the CBS domain protein WD_1027
(referred to in the present study after its NCBI COG
number, COG1253) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase WD_1028 (hemE).
Both regions were examined for the presence of DnaA-,
CtrA-, and IHF-binding sites, essential components of ori
[37]. Only the intergenic region (IGR) between the
COG1253 and hemE gene (position 988364–988765, 402
bp) was found to have all three characteristic binding
sites. In addition, out of all 110 IGRs of greater than 300
bp, this region has the highest number of CtrA, DnaA and
IHF binding sites (eight total, p = 1/110 = 0.009), the
highest density of total binding domains per IGR bp
(0.020 per bp). The next closest is the IGR between
WD_0248-WD_0249, which has a much lower total
number of binding sites (six) and binding site density
(0.013 per bp). However, it lacks putative DnaA boxes, a
prerequisite for an ori region. The putative ori region is one
of only two IGRs > 300 bp that have all three binding site
types (p = 2/110 = 0.018). However, the IGR between
WD_0100-WD_0102 has only 4 total binding domains
(compared to 8) and, due to it's larger size (545 bp) a
binding site density 1/3 that of the putative ori (0.007 vs
0.020). These data, combined with the association of the
WD_1027-WD_1028 IGR with the same genes shown to
be flanking the ori region in C. crescentus and R. prowazekii,
provides compelling evidence that this is most likely, the
origin of replication. More specifically, there are 3 DnaA,
4 CtrA and 1 IHF binding sites in the 404 bp region
between COG1253 and hemE. In contrast, the region
between ccmC and COG1806 has only a single IHF binding site and is only 130 bp long, which is rather short
compared to the ori of related bacteria (e.g. R. prowazekii
and C. crescentus, have replication origins >400 bp [37]).
Another feature of origins is that they typically contain an
AT-rich region to facilitate dissociation of the DNA during
replication initiation [17]. As a result, the overall AT-content of ori is higher when compared to the respective
genome. Consistent with this feature, the putative wMel
origin is 76% AT-rich compared to the 65% average ATcontent for the genome. In addition, the ori region is significantly more AT-rich than the average found for other
intergenic regions of >300 bp. Of 110 intergenic regions
>300 bp, only 6 have AT-content greater or equal to the ori
(p = 6/110 = 0.055). Indeed, the AT-contents of all origins
detected in this study were higher than their respective
genome averages (Table 1). It has been proposed in E. coli

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:182

that this exceptionally AT-rich DNA is the place where the
initiator factor of DNA replication, the DnaA protein, first
unwinds the origin [38,39]. These AT-rich sequences are
also conspicuous because they are tandem repeats. For
example, the E. coli oriC region is composed of three
imperfect 13-mer sequences with the consensus sequence
GATCTNTTNTTTT [38]. Similar tandem repeats were
detected in all bacterial species and strains studied except
in A. marginale, E. canis and N. sennetsu. In most cases the
repeats were 10–12 bp long and appeared in two copies
(data not shown).
These lines of in silico evidence suggest that Wolbachia has
an origin of replication on its chromosome that lies
between the COG1253 and hemE genes. One of the
boundary genes, hemE (WD_1028), encodes for uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase – a component in heme biosynthesis. The other, COG1253 (WD_1027), encodes for
a CBS domain protein. CBS domains have been shown to
bind ligands with an adenosyl group such as AMP, ATP
and S-AdoMet [40]. Using the publicly available HMMer
program [41], it was found that this protein has a CBS
domain pair and a CorC_HlyC transporter associated
domain.
The putative ori regions were also identified in other complete and/or partial publicly available Wolbachia genomes
by using the above mentioned criteria. The orthologs of
the COG1253 (WD_1027) and hemE (WD_1028) genes
were identified by BLAST searches [42] of the genomes of
the wAna [43], wSim [43], wWil [44], wPip [45] and wBm
Wolbachia strains [14] (see Table 1). Both flanking genes
are highly conserved in position and in sequence. Based
on criteria set forth by Zyskind et al. [46], the regions of
the wMel and wBm strains for which their genome
sequence is available [14,15], were compared indicating
that: (a) 266 of 347, or 77%, of the amino acids are conserved, while 790 of 1044 (76%) of the nucleotides are
conserved in the flanking gene hemE and (b) 216 of 279,
or 77%, of the amino acids are conserved, while 609 of
819 (74%) of the nucleotides are conserved in the flanking gene COG1253. The ori regions of the two genomes
present 73% identity at the nucleotide level. The putative
ori-region-related binding sites for the wAna, wSim and
wWil strains (all members of the A-supergroup), wPip
strain (B-supergroup), and the wBm strain (D-supergroup) have been depicted [see Additional Table 3]. A
schematic representation is depicted in Figure 1 while the
length and genome coordinates are shown in Table 1
(where applicable).
Based on the consensus sequence of the flanking genes of
the putative ori region in Wolbachia [see Additional Text
File 1], a PCR strategy [see Additional Figure 1 and Additional Table 2] was developed to amplify and sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/182

the putative ori regions of other Wolbachia strains infecting
different Drosophila species: wMelPop, wRi, wAu, wHa,
wYak, wTei, wSan, wNo, wMa and wMau [see Additional
Table 1] [47-57]. Further sequencing of the putative ori
region of an additional 37 Wolbachia strains from diverse
hosts confirmed the overall characteristics of this region
both in size and sequence [see Figure 1 and Additional
Table 1]. Wolbachia strains belong to eight supergroups AH [58-61]. The present study includes representative
strains from supergroups A, B, D, E and F. All strains
present three DnaA and a single IHF boxes while they differ in the number of CtrA binding sites (two to seven). The
sequenced putative ori regions of some Wolbachia strains
present a peculiar pattern of binding sites [see Figure 1
and Additional Table 1]. It is worth noting that the pseudoscorpion Wolbachia ori does not have any CtrA binding
motifs while it presents three DnaA boxes and a single IHF
binding site suggesting either the existence of a very
diverged CtrA binding motif (which could not be identified when compared to the consensus sequence used in
the present study) or the CtrA factor may not play an
important regulatory role in the DNA replication of this
Wolbachia strain.
We tested for selective constraints on the binding sites for
DnaA, CtrA and IHF by comparing the frequencies of polymorphic base positions in binding domain sites versus
non-binding domain sites within the same IGR in different clades containing closely related Wolbachia strains
(B1, B2 and A1, figure 2). The proportion of positions
showing polymorphism was lower in the binding domain
sites than non-binding sites for all three clades (B1 0.08 vs
0.19, p = 0.035; B2 0 vs 0.12, p = 0.001; A1 0.02 vs 0.08, p
= 0.081; Fisher Exact Test), with two showing significant
reductions in polymorphisms within domain positions.
Combining the data give 25.3 percent lower proportion of
positions with polymorphisms in the binding domains
relative to flanking non-binding positions (p < 0.0001
Fisher Exact Test), indicating some selective constraint on
these positions.
In silico prediction of the origin of DNA replication in
closely related bacteria
Applying the same criteria, the origin of DNA replication
was predicted in silico for the closely related A. marginale
St. Maries, A. phagocytophilum HZ, E. ruminantium Welgevonden, E. ruminantium Gardel, E. canis Jake and E. chaffeensis Arkansas (Table 1). Annotation, BLAST analysis
and/or domain searches (using HMMer) were used to
identify the two flanking genes of the putative ori regions
(Table 1).

The length of the predicted ori region differs markedly by
300 bp between the two Anaplasma spp [34,36]. In A. marginale, the ori is 620 bp; in A. phagocytophilum it is just 385

and a single IHF binding site that differ in both sequence
and position. A. marginale has two DnaA boxes while A.
phagocytophilum has four [see Figure 1 and Additional

Origin of replication features of the different Ehrlichia spp.
examined in this study are summarized in Table 1. Multiple possible IHF binding sites are found for each member
(depicted in Figure 1). Of special interest is the absence of
CtrA binding sites in E. ruminantium. However, if two mismatches are allowed two putative CtrA sites are found.

F. candida, C. lectularius, C. scorpioides, P. hoffmeyeri, and A. encedon. Note also that in A. marginale the ori region appears to be
significantly longer due to the differently annotated hemE gene

The putative ori region of the four different Rickettsia spp.
examined here was predicted by searching for the previously described hemE/COG1806 [37] [see Figure 1, Table
1 and Additional Table 1]. Following the same type of
analysis, two putative ori regions can be identified in N.
sennetsu that are unlike other bacteria examined in this
study [see Table 1 and Additional Table 1]. The first region
is located between COG1806 and COG1253, is 553 bp
long, and has no DnaA, no CtrA and no IHF binding site.
This intergenic region contains a hypothetical gene (92
amino acids long) and a predicted tRNA-Arg. The second
region is located between hemE and an uncharacterized
phage protein, is 408 bp long, and has no DnaA, no CtrA
and two IHF binding sites. Although less clearly defined
by the binding sites, this latter region is close to the shift
in GC-skew [36] and its AT-content is higher when compared to the respective genome. Additionally, when it is
compared with the first one, it appears to have more IHF
binding sites in its immediate neighborhood. The above
data indicate that the second region may be the putative
ori region of N. sennetsu (Figure 1); however, it is possible
that the proposed search criteria may not be appropriate
for the identification of the origin of replication of N. sennetsu.
Taken together, the in silico approach can predict the putative origin of replication of most bacterial species closely
related to Wolbachia including Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and
Rickettsia. In addition, the Maximum Likelihood derived
trees demonstrate a clear concordance of the ori region
and 16S rRNA phylogenies for the Rickettsia genus, Anaplasma/Ehrlichia genera, and Wolbachia supergroups [see
Additional Figure 2].
Recombination of the Wolbachia ori region
Significant recombination events at the ori region of Wolbachia were detected within both supergroup A and B and
between the two supergroups (MaxChi, P < 0.001). Most
of the recombination breakpoints fell at one of the two
edges of the intergenic region (see graph in Figure 3A).
The majority of binding sites (excluding DnaA_2 and
CtrA_2) occur within a region that experienced a similar

low number of recombination events, suggesting that usually these sites, when recombining, are exchanged as a
unique sequence tract. A likely recombination breakpoint
occurred in the nucleotide region between IHF_1 and
DnaA_2 (see arrow, Fig. 3A) indicating a potential shuffling among binding sites at this region.
Most of the recombination breakpoints per sequence were
single and thus involved recombination of sequences
encompassing one of the two halves of the alignment.
Clear examples of recombinant tracts can be visualized by
simple examination of the shared nucleotide polymorphisms among triplets of sequences (see example in Figure 3B). For instance, the ori region of wAenc_B, a strain

from the host A. encedon belonging to supergroup B,
shows a clear recombinant pattern between A- and B-type
sequences. Specifically, the first 210 bp of the sequence
from the wAenc_B strain shares most of the polymorphisms (70) with the B strain wMa_B, from D. simulans,
while the remaining sequence portion shares most of polymorphisms (42) with the A strain wMel-A, from D. melanogaster. As a result, wAenc_B places as a deep branch of
supergroup B, separated by a great distance from other Bstrains (bootstrap value, P = 82; data not shown); this
apparent phylogenetic divergence is actually due to
recombination within the sequence. A similar case of
recombination is found for the wCalt_B strain and
involves B-type sequences. The first 500 bp of the wCalt_B

sequence shares most of the polymorphisms with the
wVul sequence, while the following 173 bp share most
polymorphisms with the wOscaB sequence. Other
instances of recombination involve the Wolbachia Astrains from A. albopictus, A. sparsa, C. pennsylvanicus and
S. invicta, denoted A2 in figure 2. These four ori sequences
are recombinant between A and B-types sequences (MaxChi, P < 0.001).

Discussion
In the present study, we provide in silico evidence for the
location of the origin of replication in Wolbachia and its
close relatives: Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Neorickettsia. The analysis included fifty-three Wolbachia strains
and ten additional strains from the other closely related
bacterial species. All the origins predicted here are 383–
620 bp long. The Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Neorickettsia, and
Rickettsia predicted origins herein do align appropriately
with the shift of GC-skew found in these genomes [36].
However, the actual shift occurs over a fairly large region
(~20 kB) and thus is not sufficient for identifying the precise ori. The Wolbachia genomes have no clear shift in GCskew which could indicate a putative origin of replication
[14,15,17]. The fact that Wolbachia genomes do not
present a strong shift of GC-skew may be due to extensive
intragenomic recombination events that in addition may
have also eliminated the synteny between the genomes of
the genes flanking the ori, another feature of the Wolbachia
lineage. Recombination has been recently shown to be
widespread across Wolbachia genomes [62]. Based on our
analyses, it has clearly played a role in shaping the ori
region of Wolbachia and potentially shuffled the binding
sites, thus giving rise to chimeric sequences. Whether and
how these DNA rearrangements have affected the replication performance in the recombinant strains remains a
subject of future investigation.
Prediction of origins in genomes
As a non-coding region, the ori region is often overlooked
and not annotated in genomes. However, this is a significant issue since it has an essential role in DNA replication.
Therefore, we have established several criteria that should
be used to identify the origin from genome sequencing
data including: (a) boundary genes that are homologous
to those of closely related bacteria, (b) an intergenic
region 200–1000 bp in size, (c) presence of appropriate
binding sites (primarily for DnaA and IHF), (d) an
increased distribution of the appropriate binding sites
when compared to other intergenic regions, (e) increased
AT content relative to the genome, (f) increased homology to closely related sequences relative to the genome,
and (g) a shift in GC-skew. Although all seven elements
may not be present in all genomes, a significant combination of these elements should allow for a better prediction
of this important region.

The origin of replication and the CtrA, DnaA and IHF
binding sites
The presumed ori regions of the bacterial species and
strains of the present study are characterized by the presence of DnaA, CtrA and IHF boxes (the exception being N.
sennetsu). The DnaA and IHF boxes are present in all bacterial ori regions characterized. However, the CtrA boxes
seem to be restricted, as yet, to the ori regions of the α-Proteobacteria. In C. crescentus, CtrA is a global cell cycle regulator [26] and more specifically, the response regulator
protein of a two-component signal transduction signal.
Upon phosphorylation by a sensor histidine kinase, CtrA
binds to its corresponding binding sites and represses
chromosomal replication [63]. CtrA's binding sites are
overlapping with a DnaA box and the IHF binding site.
Thus, binding of CtrA prevents binding of DnaA and IHF
[37]. CtrA is degraded before the onset of the S phase by
the protease ClpXP allowing DnaA and IHF binding
[64,65]. Despite A. marginale CtrA having 59% amino acid
identity with its wMel ortholog, A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum ori regions have only a single CtrA binding site,
as opposed to four in wMel. E. ruminantium has no CtrA
binding site in its putative ori region while its CtrA protein
is 80% identical to the A. marginale ortholog. Similarly,
the putative ori regions of the pseudoscorpion C. scorpioides Wolbachia strain, E. chaffeensis, E. canis, R. conorii and
the filarial nematode B. malayi Wolbachia strain (wBm)
have zero, one, three, two and two CtrA binding sites
respectively. These observations suggest that CtrA may be
dispensable in these bacteria. Interestingly, the bacteria
with zero to three CtrA binding sites in their ori region are
not associated with insects. In contrast, insect-associated
Wolbachia and Rickettsia bacteria usually present high
number of CtrA binding sites present in their ori region
ranging from four to seven (the exception being R. felis
which has three CtrA binding sites). Whether bacterial
growth control is host-dependent and is regulated
through the number of the CtrA binding sites in the origin
of replication region awaits experimental confirmation.

It is worth noting that there are orthologs to dnaA, ctrA
and ihfAB in the bacterial genomes studied except N. sennetsu and A. marginale. They are both missing IHF-β but
have retained the IHF-α subunit [see Additional Table 3].
Another interesting observation is that the filarial nematode B. malayi Wolbachia strain (wBm) and A. phagocytophilum are missing both parA and parB, which are
involved in partitioning the chromosomes [14,36]. This
suggests that Wolbachia and Anaplasma replication may be
quite interesting; experimental work is needed in order to
clarify the roles of replication-associated proteins in binding the ori and initiating DNA replication initiation process.

IHF binding sites were found in all bacteria using the consensus WATCAN5WTR [37]. In some Wolbachia strains,
two to three such candidate sites were found within their
putative ori regions. In these cases, only the common one
was retained [37]. In contrast, A. marginale and A. phagocytophilum had different IHF binding sites in both in
sequence and in position. Two conserved putative IHF
binding sites were detected in the putative ori region of E.
canis and the two E. ruminantium strains, with all of them
being similar both in sequence and position while a single
putative IHF binding site was present in E. chaffeensis
which was the only common IHF binding site found in all
four Ehrlichia strains. IHF positioning varied between the
four Rickettsia species. The only exception appears to be
the conservation in position as well as in sequence
between R. prowazekii and R. typhi. The IHF-β subunit is
missing from the genome of A. marginale. The only IHF
identified, AM_006, is 43.2% identical (amino acid level)
to the wMel IHF-α subunit (WD_0057). A. phagocytophilum, all four Ehrlichia, and all four Rickettsia species
have both IHF subunits. N. sennetsu also lacks IHF-β [see
Additional Table 3]. Whether the absence of the IHF-β
subunit is somehow correlated with the divergence/
absence of IHF binding sites in Anaplasma and Neorickettsia is not known.
The evolution of the origin of replication of Wolbachia,
Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Neorickettsia
The difference in the boundary genes observed between
the closely related Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Wolbachia and the
other α-Proteobacteria is likely due to chromosomal rearrangements that have taken place in the ori region. All of
the origins examined have as boundaries either the
COG1253 – hemE pair (Wolbachia, Ehrlichia and Anaplasma), or the hemE – COG1806 pair (Caulobacter and
Rickettsia), or the hemE – uncharacterized phage protein
pair (N. sennetsu). Overlaying these observations on the
phylogeny of the α-Proteobacteria [36], the most likely
ancestral configuration is that found in Caulobacter and
Rickettsia. Sometime after the branching of the Anaplasmataceae, a rearrangement took place that repositioned
the COG1253 gene to the position of COG1806
orthologs in Wolbachia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma with a
second rearrangement occurring in N. sennetsu. The exact
nature of these rearrangements cannot be determined
since the synteny of the chromosomes has been lost. As
discussed earlier, the distribution of ori-specific binding
sites (DnaA, CtrA and IHF) is consistent with the currently
accepted phylogeny of Wolbachia.
Growth control, infection levels and Wolbachia-induced
phenotypes
It has been widely accepted that bacterial infection levels
are positively correlated with the virulent and/or pathogenic properties of bacterial pathogens [66]. Similarly,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/182

several studies have shown that Wolbachia's ability to
induce reproductive and/or virulent phenotypes is positively correlated with their intra-host infection levels [1113,54,67]. Furthermore, intracellular bacteria that are
transmitted through the eggs of their hosts must be "prudent replicators" in order to ensure their transmission to
future generations by preventing overgrowth that could
lead to host death prior to reproduction. This raises the
question: is the DNA replication and growth of an obligate intracellular bacterium under bacterial control, host
control, phage control or some combination? Overreplication by the "popcorn" strain of Wolbachia in D. melanogaster suggests that the bacterial strain has a strong
influence on replication rates within the host [54],
although effects of the host also occur [12] and effects of
phage have not been tested [10].
The results of the present study clearly indicate that no
major differences could be detected between the ori
regions of Wolbachia strains differing in ability to induce
CI, virulence, parthenogenesis or feminization. All Wolbachia strains presented the same organization in their
putative origin of replication: COG1253 and hemE as
boundary genes, three DnaA boxes, two to seven CtrA
boxes and a single IHF binding site. A notable exception
is the pseudoscorpion Wolbachia strain which presents
zero CtrA binding sites. The possibility that DNA binding
specificity of CtrA has changed in these bacteria is an
intriguing hypothesis. CtrA contains two domains, a
receiver domain at the N-terminus and a transcriptional
regulatory (DNA binding) effector domain at the C-terminus. These domains are nearly identical between wMel
and wBm with only one positive amino acid substitution
in each domain. All other changes are located at the far Cterminus where no domains are found. Since a single
amino acid change can greatly affect DNA binding, it is
conceivable that these two positive substitutions can alter
CtrA's binding specificity. A second hypothesis is that
CtrA's DNA-binding specificity did not change in wBm,
and only the number of CtrA binding sites reduced. This
CtrA binding site reduction may be associated with the
mutualistic nature of the Wolbachia – B. malayi association
and may have resulted in a novel control of bacterial replication. These hypotheses need to be tested experimentally.
Origin of replication and genetic transformation system
Evidence presented here for the prediction of ori location,
is based on the boundary genes and on the in silico finding
of characteristic DnaA, CtrA, and IHF binding sites that
have been experimentally confirmed only in C. cresentus
and partially in R. prowazekii [37]. Lack of a robust genetic
transformation system for Wolbachia, Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia and most Anaplasma and Rickettsia precludes experimental verification in the bacterial species of the present

study. However, significant progress has been made
toward the development of a robust genetic transformation for A. phagocytophilum and R. prowazekii using homologous recombination-based and transposon-based
approaches [68-70]. The fact that these bacteria (both
Wolbachia and relatives) can be maintained in different
cell lines [3,71,72], the availability of complete genomic
information [14,15,34-36,73-76] and, the presence in
some of them, such as Wolbachia, of endogenous phages
and insertion sequences [77,78] will certainly facilitate
current efforts for the genetic transformation of these
intracellular bacteria.

Conclusion
We provide in silico evidence for the location of the origin
of replication in Wolbachia and its close relatives: Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Neorickettsia. Putative origins of replication, which are usually 200–1000 bp long,
have features in common that were used to establish a set
of guidelines for properly predicting the origin in
genomes. Several of the bacteria had variable sequences/
numbers of key binding sites suggesting altered modes of
replication. This is supported by the lack of specific replication associated enzymes.
Intracellular bacteria that are transmitted through the eggs
of their hosts are thought to be "prudent replicators" in
order to ensure their transmission to future generations by
not causing lethality of their host prior to reproduction.
This raises the question: is the DNA replication and
growth of an obligate intracellular bacterium under bacterial control, host control, phage control or some combination? The results of the present study clearly indicate that
no major differences could be detected between the ori
regions of Wolbachia strains inducing or non-inducing CI,
being virulent or non-virulent, inducing parthenogenesis
or feminization. In addition, recombination across the ori
region was demonstrated for the main arthropod supergroups, A and B. Lastly and surprisingly, the origin boundary genes have changed twice in the evolution of this order
of bacteria.

Methods
DNA extraction
Various insect hosts and Wolbachia strains were used for
DNA extraction in the present study [see Additional Table
1]. Fly stocks were reared on standard corn flour – sugar –
yeast medium at 25°C. Bacterial DNA was extracted using
the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
PCR amplification and sequencing of the Wolbachia ori
region
A PCR strategy [see Results, Additional Figure 1 and Additional Table 2] was developed to amplify the ori region

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/182

from the following Wolbachia strains belonging to supergroup A and B: wMel, wMelPop, wAu, wRi, wHa, wYak,
wTei, wSan, wNo, wMa and wMau. Various PCR primers
were used for the amplification reactions [see Additional
Table 1]. PCR reaction mixtures contained 1× Taq buffer
(750 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.8, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.1%
Tween 20), 2 mM MgCl2, 125 µM dNTPs, 12.5 pmol of
each primer, 1 unit Taq polymerase (Promega) and 25 ng/
µl template DNA and were cycled with an initial denaturing step at 94°C for 10 minutes, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30
seconds, 54°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 3 minutes followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. PCR
reactions were purified with Qiagen nucleotide removal
kit or Qiagen gel extraction kit depending on the existence
or not, of byproducts. Sequencing was performed by Macrogen (Korea). Sequence trace files from sequencing reactions were processed using the DNAStar 5.0 suite of
programs.
A smaller region of ori was amplified and sequenced from
a greater variety of Wolbachia strains according to the
methods mentioned in [79]. Reactions to generate these
smaller amplicons were attempted for 52 Wolbachia
strains from almost all described supergroups using standard PCR conditions with HotStarTaq (Qiagen), according
to the manufacturer's suggestions, with 0.5 µM of each
WD_1027_R and WD_1028_R. Reactions were initiated
with a 15 minute incubation at 95°C followed by 50
cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, 72°C
for 1 min. The primers WD_1027_R and WD_1028_R had
5'-tags of M13 forward and reverse primer sequences,
respectively, to serve as anchors for the degenerate primers
in later stages of amplification and were later used for
sequencing. Amplification reactions (8 µL) were treated
with 0.5 U shrimp alkaline phosphatase and 1.0 U exonuclease I (Amersham) in the supplied buffer. Sequencing
reactions were performed at the J. Craig Venter Joint Technology Center (Rockville, MD) with M13 forward and
reverse primers. Assembly was done with the TIGR assembler and manually curated with Cloe (ClosureEditor, a
TIGR program for editing assemblies). The alignment was
initially generated using CLUSTALW and curated in
Bioedit v. 7.0.4.1.
The nucleotide sequences reported in this study have been
deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
DQ498834 – DQ498882.
Sequence acquisition and analysis from publicly available
genomes
Sequence information was used from publicly available
genome data (GenBank) of Wolbachia and other closely
related bacterial species and strains (Table 1).

In silico prediction of the ori region
For ori-boundary identification, genes homologous to
COG1253 (see results for the new proposed gene name of
the CBS domain protein) and hemE were identified using
BLAST. Moreover, the CBS domain protein gene was
searched for conserved domains using the HMMer program [41] and the Pfam_fs hidden markov model (HMM)
database.

Binding sites were identified using local perl scripts based
on the previously determined consensus sequences [37].
For the CtrA binding site (TTAA-N7-TTAA), a single mismatch was allowed only in the A's and only if these mismatches followed the looser consensus TTWW-N7-TTWW
described previously [37]. For the DnaA binding site, the
consensus TTATNCACA was used [80]. For the IHF-binding site, the consensus WATCAN5WTR was used [81,82].
In order to examine the distribution of the CtrA-, IHF-,
and DnaA-binding sites in the intergenic regions of each
genome were identified using fuzznuc from the EMBOSS
package [83] and locally developed scripts.
Phylogenetic analysis
The alignment for the figure 2 tree was generated using
ClustalX 1.83 for Windows [84] with the default parameters and trimmed using BioEdit for Windows [85]. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods were used to infer
phylogenetic relationships. Prior to ML analysis, a DNA
substitution model was selected using Modeltest v3.06
and the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The selected
model of evolution was based on a 382 bp ori region with
indels excluded (TVM+G). ML heuristic searches were performed using 100 random taxon addition replicates with
tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch swapping.
ML bootstrap support was determined using 100 bootstrap replicates, each using 10 random taxon addition replicates with TBR branch swapping. Searches were
performed in parallel on a Beowulf cluster using a clusterpaup program and PAUP version 4.0b10 [86].

Conservation of binding domains in the Wolbachia ori
region was investigated within three clades of closely
related Wolbachia (B1, B2 and A1). It should be noted here
that the A2 clade (see Figure 2) was not used because it is
recombinant between the A and B supergroups in the ori
region (see text for details). Binding site positions were
identified based on a reference strain within each clade;
this was straightforward due to relatively low variation
within each clade. Positions were then classified as binding or non-binding. Positions within binding domains
with free nucleotide designations (N) were classified as
non-binding sites. In cases where binding domains were
overlapping, if both positions were N sites, then the position was classified as non-binding, otherwise it was classi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/182

fied as a binding position. All positions within the IGR
were then scored as polymorphic (containing at least one
polymorphism) or not. Fisher Exat Tests were used to
compare the proportions of polymorphic and non-polymorphic positions in binding sites versus non-binding
sites.
Recombination analyses
The ori region of Wolbachia was searched for recombination signature by using the Maximum Chi Square
(MaxChi2) program, implemented in the RDP2 program
[87]. MaxChi is a local method that uses a sliding window
approach to search for putative recombination breakpoints in a set of aligned DNA sequences. Significant discrepancies between the two partitions of the window are
calculated based on the difference in the number of variable sites (VI) on either sides of the central partition. A Chisquare statistics is applied. The step size was set to 20
nucleotides and the window size set to 20 VI, gaps were
included and a Bonferroni correction was applied. The
highest acceptable P-value cut-off was set to 0.001 and
1000 permutation were generated. We analyzed only
strains belonging to supergroup A and B and having
sequences of equal length encompassing a portion of
both flanking genes. The final alignment was 673 base
pairs long and included 38 strains (19 A- and 19 Bstrains). The alignment was partitioned in dataset A and B
(from the two supergroups) and recombination analyses
were run on both single and combined datasets.

Additional Figure 2 – The Maximum Likelihood derived trees demonstrate a clear concordance of the ori region and 16S rRNA phylogenies for
the Rickettsia genus (Figure 2C), Anaplasma/Ehrlichia genera (Figure
2B), and Wolbachia supergroups with one minor exception (Figure 2A).
There is a weakly supported trifurcation in the 16S rRNA phylogeny
(spanning supergroups A, B, and E, 64% bootstrap support) that is inconsistent with the ori phylogeny (98% bootstrap support). Supergroups A, B,
D, E, and F are represented by sequences from D. melanogaster, C. pipiens, B. malayi, F. candida, and C. lectularius, respectively. The likelihood-based Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test for alternative tree
topologies [90] however revealed no significant difference between any of
the Figure 2 topologies, specifying the ori region as a sufficient genetic
marker for the broad evolutionary relationships in this intracellular clade.
Selected DNA substitution models of evolution were selected using Modeltest v3.06 and the Akaike information criterion (AIC). They were based
on a 655 bp ori region (TVM+I) and 1377 bp 16S rRNA sequence
(HKY) for Wolbachia, a 395 bp ori region (GTR+I) and 1454 bp 16S
rRNA sequence (GTR+I) for the Anaplasma/Ehrlichia genera, and a
382 bp ori region (HKY+I) and 1498 bp 16S rRNA sequence (TrN) for
Rickettsia. ML heuristic searches were performed using 500 random
taxon addition replicates with tree bisection and reconnection (TBR)
branch swapping. ML bootstrap support was determined using 500 bootstrap replicates, each using 10 random taxon addition replicates with TBR
branch swapping. Searches were performed in parallel on a Beowulf cluster using a clusterpaup program and PAUP version 4.0b10 [86].
