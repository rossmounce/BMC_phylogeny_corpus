Abstract
Background: Because bacteria do not have a robust fossil record, attempts to infer the timing of
events in their evolutionary history requires comparisons of molecular sequences. This use of
molecular clocks is based on the assumptions that substitution rates for homologous genes or sites
are fairly constant through time and across taxa. Violation of these conditions can lead to
erroneous inferences and result in estimates that are off by orders of magnitude. In this study, we
examine the consistency of substitution rates among a set of conserved genes in diverse bacterial
lineages, and address the questions regarding the validity of molecular dating.
Results: By examining the evolution of 16S rRNA gene in obligate endosymbionts, which can be
calibrated by the fossil record of their hosts, we found that the rates are consistent within a clade
but varied widely across different bacterial lineages. Genome-wide estimates of nonsynonymous
and synonymous substitutions suggest that these two measures are highly variable in their rates
across bacterial taxa. Genetic drift plays a fundamental role in determining the accumulation of
substitutions in 16S rRNA genes and at nonsynonymous sites. Moreover, divergence estimates
based on a set of universally conserved protein-coding genes also exhibit low correspondence to
those based on 16S rRNA genes.
Conclusion: Our results document a wide range of substitution rates across genes and bacterial
taxa. This high level of variation cautions against the assumption of a universal molecular clock for
inferring divergence times in bacteria. However, by applying relative-rate tests to homologous
genes, it is possible to derive reliable local clocks that can be used to calibrate bacterial evolution.

Background
Dating the age of a lineage is fundamental to understanding evolutionary processes. This knowledge allows biologists to address questions concerning the ancestry and
emergence of a lineage, its relationship to and coincidence

with specific biological and geological events, the speed
with which particular taxonomic groups have diversified,
and the rates of molecular and phenotypic evolution
[1,2]. In some cases, the age of a lineage can be determined directly from fossils [3,4]; but for the vast majority

This is largely the situation in bacteria. Despite being the
most ancient, abundant and diverse group of organisms
on the planet, bacteria have virtually no fossil record due
both to their size and to the lack of fossilizable components. As a result, molecular clocks have been widely
applied to estimate divergence times in bacteria [1,2,5,6],
as well as in other organisms [7,8]. By assuming that
nucleotide or amino acid substitutions accumulate at a
fairly constant rate across taxa over evolutionary timescales, the association of one bacterial lineage to an event
that occurred at a known time in the geologic record can
yield the age of all other lineages by extrapolation. For
example, aerobic bacteria can be linked to a time when
atmospheric conditions was sufficient to support aerobic
life; and similarly, obligate pathogens could not have
evolved prior to the appearance of their hosts. Unfortunately, because there may be a gap between the availability of the requisite resource and its exploitation by
bacteria, such events provide only an upper bound to the
date of appearance of a bacterial lineage and are therefore
of limited used for calibrating the molecular clocks. Furthermore, calibrating molecular clocks using events that
have occurred in the distant past is complicated by the
issue of large confidence intervals and rate heterogeneity
[8].
A similar, but much more accurate, procedure for calibrating molecular clocks is based on the coincidence of speciation events between obligate symbionts and their
eukaryotic hosts [9,10]. As observed in several primary
endosymbionts of insects, there is complete concordance
between the molecular phylogenies of the bacteria and
their hosts [9,11-18]. This concordance is the results of
strict vertical transmission and permits the unequivocal
application of the hosts' fossil record to their endosymbionts, thereby providing the accuracy of fossil-derived
dates to bacterial evolution. But because these endosymbionts have been shown to accumulate substitutions at a
faster rate than do some free-living bacteria [10], certain
corrections might be required to assign dates to particular
groups of bacteria.

per year in natural populations or over evolutionary time
scales is not known. Moreover, laboratory-derived mutation rates can differ from one another, and from those in
natural habitats, by orders of magnitude, thus rendering
the extrapolation to broad evolutionary time scales unreliable [22,23].
The purpose of this paper is to determine the extent to
which bacterial divergence times can be derived from
molecular data. Using a series of internal and external calibration points, we ask if there is any gene or set of sites
that can serve as a reliable molecular clock, and whether
the molecular characters themselves portray a consistent
view of bacterial evolution. Finally, we discuss which
applications of bacterial molecular clocks are valid and
justified or whether such attempts might be better abandoned.

Results
Calibrating rates of 16S rRNA divergence
Due to its universal distribution and slow rate of sequence
evolution, 16S rRNA has been the most widely used gene
for the identification and taxonomic assignment of bacteria, with nearly one million sequences representing all
known bacterial diversity [24]. Our first goal was to determine if the rate of 16S rRNA sequence evolution could
serve as a reliable molecular chronometer. To test this, we
focused on bacterial endosymbionts whose ages have
been established from the fossil records of their hosts
[9,11-13,16,25-27].

Figure 1 presents the extent of 16S rRNA sequence divergence (K16S) relative to the fossil-derived divergence times
for six lineages of obligate bacterial endosymbionts infecting three orders of insects. Evolutionary rates vary approximately four-fold across all bacterial lineages considered
(0.025 to 0.091% per million years) but appear to be

An alternative way to calibrate molecular clocks for estimating the age of bacterial lineages is to determine
directly the rates at which mutations accumulate in experimental systems [19-21]. Despite the appeal of this
method, such empirical estimates of mutation rates are of
rather limited use when inferring the age of most bacterial
lineages. First, the rates derived from mutation are usually
calculated on a 'per generation' basis and are difficult to
convert to actual time because the number of generations

fairly consistent for members within a clade. Estimates
from the Buchnera-aphid association, for which the most
abundant and accurate data are available, varied from
0.05 to 0.08% per million years, with an average of 0.06%
per million years. Compared to their insect hosts, the rates
of 16S rRNA divergence in endosymbiont lineages are
highly variable. Applying the same fossil-derived divergence times, the 16S rRNA genes in Buchnera evolve 36
times faster than the analogous gene (i.e., 18S rRNA) in
their insect hosts [10]; however, in the Blattabacteriumcockroach/termite association, the small subunit RNA
genes of the endosymbionts and their hosts evolve at
roughly the same rate [13].
Sequence divergence in protein-coding genes
Based on their evolutionary distance, we selected 42 pairs
of bacterial genomes (Additional file 1) to evaluate variation in substitution rates across genes and lineages. The
genome pairs represent eight bacterial phyla and include
strains or species that are sufficiently closely related to
obtain unambiguous sequence alignments and reliable
estimates of substitution rate. Remembering that up to a
3% difference in 16S rRNA genes is the usual cut-off for
assigning bacteria to the same species [28], the K16S values
between members of a genome-pair range from 0.07% to
3.4% (average = 0.98%).

As alternative measures of sequence divergence, we calculated the synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous (Ka) substitution rates for all protein-coding genes shared between
the two members of a genome-pair; to avoid the distortion caused by genes that are under strong positive or
purifying selection, we used the median value as the

genome-wide level of sequence divergence. As expected
from genome-pairs spanning such a broad range of 16S
rRNA divergences, median Ks values ranged from 0.11 to
1.29 (average = 0.6), and median Ka values, from 0.006 to
0.058 (average = 0.03). In those genome pairs whose
members were most divergent, there was much greater
variation in Ka and Ks values across genes, which is due
both to stochastic factors and to the metrics of multiple
hit corrections.
To determine if these commonly used measures of bacterial sequence divergence - K16S, Ks, and Ka - increase in a
correlated manner across all organisms (and thus provide
largely consistent measurements of divergence times), we
plotted their values against one another for the 42
genome-pairs. Because the evolution of 16S rRNA and at
nonsynonymous sites of protein-coding regions are under
selective constraints, both K16S and Ka will be affected by
the level of genetic drift, which underlies the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations. For this reason, we
grouped lineages according to particular lifestyles that are
known to give rise to different levels of genetic drift (Figure 2).
As noted previously [e.g., [29,30]], bacteria that form obligate associations with eukaryotic hosts have significantly
higher Ka/Ks ratios (Figure 2A, ANOVA test P-value = 8.0 Ã
10-9), a consequence of their smaller effective population
sizes (Ne) compared to bacteria that are free-living or form
facultative associations. Likewise, rates of 16S rRNA evolution are elevated in obligate pathogens and symbionts
(Figure 2B, ANOVA test P-value = 7.2 Ã 10-4), as resulting
from increased levels of genetic drift. Because the effects of

genetic drift are genome-wide, both Ka and K16S are similarly affected by reductions in Ne, and therefore, Ka/K16S
ratios are not expected to differ significantly between the
three lifestyle-groups (Figure 2C, ANOVA test P-value =
0.37).
As presented in Figure 2C, nonsynonymous sites evolve,
on average, at about twice the rate of 16S rRNA, but the
broad scatter of points indicates that this is not a general
trend across genomes. This lack of a consistent association
implies that divergence times obtained by applying a
molecular clock to one of these measures of sequence
divergence will rarely match those calibrated to another.
There is, however, a fairly reliable relationship between Ka
and Ks within each of the lifestyle groups. Looking across
the lineages considered, synonymous sites evolve 25
times faster than do nonsynonymous sites in free-living
bacteria, but only 10 times faster in bacteria that form
obligate associations with eukaryotic hosts.
Core Gene Evolution
Aside from 16S rRNA, several universally conserved genes
have been used to determine the relationships among
bacteria [1,2,31,32]. Although neither the genome-wide
median Ka nor Ks values show a strong association with
16S rRNA divergence (Figure 2), it is possible that particular genes evolve in a fashion that would make suitable
molecular clock. We examined 37 single-copy genes
present in all of the 82 genomes sampled (Additional file
2), estimated the Ks and Ka for each gene, and determined
the correlation of each with median Ks and Ka values and
with 16S rRNA divergence. As observed for the genomewide estimates, there is usually a much better correlation
in between Ka and K16S than between Ks and K16S (Figure
3). In fact, for 90% of the universally conserved singlecopy genes, there is no significant relationship between
their divergence at synonymous sites and divergence of
16S rRNA. The situation differs from that observed
between divergence at individual genes and the median Ks
and Ka values; as expected, individual genes are generally
significantly correlated with their respective median values. However, there is a notable exception: In every ribosomal protein (Rpl and Rps) considered, neither the Ka nor
the Ks values is significantly correlated with median Ks.
Although the genes encoding ribosomal proteins are short
and might be subject to stochastic variation, the more
likely reason that these genes depart from the majority of
genes in a genome is because their sequences are highly
conserved at both nonsynonymous and synonymous sites
due to constraints on protein function and to codon usage
bias, respectively.

Discussion
Bacteria have played a vital role in shaping life on Earth
throughout their long history of evolution. Although

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/35

accurate timescales have been fundamental to studying
evolutionary processes, there is, with the exception of very
few milestones, virtually no fossil record by which we can
chronicle the history and diversification of bacteria. This
circumstance has resulted in the broad application of
molecular clocks to obtain divergence times, and in this
paper, we investigated the extent to which molecules are
accurate chronometers of bacterial evolution.
The short answer is that no gene, nor class of sites within
genes, can serve as a reliable molecular clock for bacteria.
Despite early claims of similar substitution rates among
bacteria [5,9] and the application of eukaryotic substitution rates to bacteria [e.g., [33]], no single evolutionary
rate can be applied across diverse bacterial lineages or over
broad evolutionary periods. We first applied the most
direct approach by evaluating rate constancy for the 16S
rRNA genes of insect endosymbionts whose divergence
times are echoed in the fossil record of their insect hosts.
Although the 16S rRNA gene homologs of aphid endosymbionts were originally estimated to evolve at a rate
only slightly faster than that obtained for free-living bacteria (i.e., 1-2% per 50 million years), the inclusion of several additional taxa now provides clear evidence of much
wider variation. When considering only insect endosymbionts, whose intercellular lifestyles might be thought to
engender similar selective constraints and similarly fast
mutation rates, we detected nearly a 4-fold difference in
16S rRNA gene substitution rates. This difference in rates
is not due to vagaries in the fossil record: in the case of
sharpshooter insects, which contain obligate co-symbionts within the same host, the 16S rRNA genes of the gammaproteobacterial Baumannia evolve at nearly five times
the rate of homologs in the bacteroidales Sulcia [17].
If 16S rRNA genes cannot serve as a reliable chronometer
for bacterial evolution, perhaps there are other genes that
evolve in a more consistent manner. The original molecular clock hypothesis [34] was formulated based on the
accumulation of amino acid variants in proteins. On a
genome-wide scale, nonsynonymous substitution rates
are strongly correlated with those in 16S rRNA genes, indicating that use of this class of sites is as problematic as 16S
rRNA genes. Note that the relationship between Ka and
K16S is the same for bacteria of different lifestyles (statistically indistinguishable slopes of lines in Figure 2C), so
despite the lineage-specific differences in mutation rates,
population sizes, generation times and genetic drift, the
population-level parameters affecting each group exert
comparable effects on the evolution of 16S rRNA and
nonsynonymous sites.
In theory, the synonymous sites of protein-coding genes
reflect the underlying rate and pattern of mutation, and
are not affected by either selection or genetic drift. This is

apparent in the plots of Ks against both Ka (Figure 2A) and
K16S (Figure 2B), in which those bacteria subject to higher
levels of drift have elevated divergence at slightly deleterious sites (Ka and K16S) relative to neutral sites (Ks). However, mutation rates are not the same in all bacteria [22],

and are known to vary within lineages depending on
growth conditions [35] and within genomes depending
on the chromosomal location or transcriptional status of
a gene [36-38]. Moreover, synonymous sites reach saturation relatively rapidly [39,40] and, in many genes, are

under selective constraints for translational efficiency [41]
or mRNA secondary structure [42,43], all of which limit
their utility as molecular clocks.
There appears to be no panacea when attempting to
assemble a timescale for bacterial evolution. The high
level of variation in substitution rates across genes and lineages suggests that no single molecule can ever serve as a
universal clock in bacteria. Furthermore, the lack of clear
calibration points, particularly for free-living bacteria,
remains a major challenge in dating bacterial evolution.
However, there is some hope: the example of the Buchnera-aphid association has demonstrated that estimating
divergence times based on a local, more lineage-specific
clock is feasible [9]. Because the consistency of substitution rates in gene or protein can be tested by a relative-rate
test [44,45], it is possible to determine whether particular
genes evolve at a uniform rate for a set of lineages (but see
[46] for the limitations). Once a reliable phylogeny is produced, the use of a single calibration point will provide,
by extrapolation, estimates of divergence time for all other
lineages. So while we oppose the indiscriminate application of a single rate to calibrate the whole of bacterial history, it is possible to make robust statements about
bacterial divergence times and to calibrate key dates in
bacterial evolution.

Methods
Data source and genome-pair selection
To examine substitution rates across loci and taxa, we
selected 42 pairs of bacterial genomes that encompassed a
range of genome-wide average Ks values from 0.19 to 1.02
[29]. Genome sequences were downloaded from NCBI
GenBank [47] on October 1, 2008; genome project ID and
species names of the 84 genomes are listed in Additional
file 1. Data parsing and processing were performed with a
set of custom Perl scripts written with Bioperl modules
[48].
Sequence divergence of 16S rRNA genes
To calibrate rates of 16S rRNA divergence (K16S) in bacteria, we obtained the estimates of sequence divergence and
fossil-based divergence times from the literature [9,1113,16,25-27]. For each of the 42 selected genome-pairs,
we calculated the K16S between their constituent members
by first aligning the nucleotide sequences in MUSCLE [49]
using the default parameters and then applying the
DNADIST program in the PHYLIP package [50] to calculate the level of sequence identity. In cases where there are
multiple 16S rRNA genes within a single genome, we performed all possible pair-wise comparisons of 16S rRNA
genes between both members of the genome-pair and
used the median value to denote the level of divergence.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/35

Orthologous protein-coding gene identification
To identify orthologous protein-coding genes between the
members of a genome-pair, we performed reciprocal
BLASTP [51] sequence similarity searches on every annotated protein sequence in the two genomes. A pair of
genes were defined as orthologs in the two genomes if: (1)
the protein sequences were reciprocal best-hits, (2) the
BLASTP E-value was less than or equal to 1 Ã 10-15, (3) the
difference in length was no more than 20% of the shorter
sequence, (4) the high-scoring pair (HSP) accounted for at
least 80% of the shorter gene, and (5) the amino acid
sequence similarity was at least 90% within the HSP. The
close relationship of the genomes within each of the 42
selected pairs coupled with the high stringency of our
ortholog selection minimized, if not entirely eliminated,
the inclusion of paralogs in the subsequent substitution
rate calculations.
Defining the core gene set
To define a set of conserved genes for cross-taxa comparison, we used OrthoMCL [52] to identify orthologous gene
clusters among the 42 genome-pairs. Only single-copy
genes that were shared by all 84 genomes were considered. The set of 37 genes recovered from this procedure are
listed in Additional file 2.
Substitution rate calculations
To calculate the synonymous (Ks) and nonsynonymous
(Ka) substitution rates between pairs of orthologous protein-coding genes, we aligned the amino acid sequences in
MUSCLE [49] using default settings. The resulting protein
alignments were reverse-translated to codon-based nucleotide alignments with PAL2NAL [53]. Because many
highly reduced genomes have a strong base compositional bias, we applied the YN00 method [54] implemented in the PAML package [55] to estimate the
substitution rates. The mutation model used in the YN00
method accounts for the biases in base composition,
codon usage, and transition/transversion rate.
Statistical analyses
To test if the lifestyle of a bacterial lineage is a significant
factor in determining the correlation between divergence
rates, we separated the 42 sampled genome-pairs into
three groups: free-living, facultatively host-associated, and
obligately host-associated. The type of lifestyle was used
as the independent variable in the analysis of variance
(ANOVA) model implemented in the R statistical package.

Reviewers' comments
Reviewer's report 1
Dr Adam Eyre-Walker, University of Sussex, Brighton,

Reviewer comments
In this interesting manuscript Kuo and Ochman investigate whether the rate of molecular evolution in bacteria is
constant across lineages. Unfortunately, measuring the
rate of evolution is generally difficult in bacteria because
they have no fossil record. This leaves two alternatives, relative rate tests and using the fossil record of the host of
vertically transmitted endosymbionts. The authors
employ this latter strategy. They find that rates of 16S
rRNA evolution vary by about 4-fold across different
groups of bacteria, but that within each group, rates are
relatively constant. Unfortunately, they do not perform
any statistical test, so it is unclear whether this apparent
variation is significant, and if it is, whether the apparent
differences in rate could be removed by the application of
a different method to correct for multiple hits. It is a
shame that they do not apply their method to synonymous and non-synonymous sites within protein coding
genes; with many more genes they would have more
power to determine if there are genuine differences
between species.
Authors' response
The nature of the data set limits our analyses. In the case
of 16 rRNA gene, only the Buchnera lineage has multiple
calibration points, whereas each of the other lineages is
represented by a single point. Therefore, we can describe
the range of values and their dispersion but not test statistically the differences between different endosymbiont
lineages. Unfortunately, comparisons of synonymous and
non-synonymous substitution rates between different
symbiont lineages are similarly limited.
Reviewer comments
They go on to show that Ka and Ks are correlated across
species, in both endosymbionts and free-living bacteria,
and that the relationship appears to be different for obligate symbionts and free-living bacteria. Again it is unclear
whether this difference is statistically significant, but I suspect it is. Surprisingly the correlation between K16S and
Ks is very weak and probably would be non-significant if
the regression was not forced through the origin (this
seems justified). The fact that the relationship between Ka

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/35

or K16S, and Ks is different between obligate symbionts
and their free-living relatives does suggest that there is
unlikely to be a universal clock involving either Ka or
K16S. They also show that the relationship between Ka
and K16S is very similar for obligate and free living bacteria. This suggests that if effective population size is affecting Ka and K16S, then it does so to a similar extent, which
would imply that the distribution of fitness effects is similar for proteins and 16S rRNA.
Authors' response
We performed the statistical tests suggested by the
reviewer and have revised the Results and Methods sections accordingly.
Reviewer comments
The authors suggest that there might be a molecular clock
within a group of bacteria for certain genes and that to
determine the suitable genes one should run relative rate
tests to exclude inappropriate data. However, one has to
be careful in doing this, because as Bromham et al.
showed, this can still leave you with biased estimates,
because methods to detect rate heterogeneity are weak (J.
Mol. Evol. 50, 296).
Authors' response
We have revised the paragraph to address this issue.
Reviewer's report 2
Dr Simonetta Gribaldo, Institut Pasteur, Paris Cedex 15,
France
Reviewer comments
This is an interesting paper dealing with an important
issue, i.e. the possibility of dating the age of bacteria and
different bacterial lineages. The answer is that there is no
universal clock for bacteria: not for 16S nor for conserved
orthologues. The heterogeneity of evolutionary rates
across lineages is indeed a well-known phenomenon and
one of the most important issues in phylogenetic reconstruction.

For molecular dating of eukaryotes, many problems have
been put forward, of which heterogeneity of rates appear
to be only one (as reviewed for example in Roger AJ and
Hug LA 2006). I am not an expert of the field, but I think
that the use of relaxed clocks and accurate models of
sequence evolution can overcome the problem of rate heterogeneity?
For molecular dating of prokaryotes, I have the feeling
that the major problem lies in the use of global clocks, the
absence of clear calibration points and the use of calibration points very far in time, such as the plant/animal split
to date the divergence of a specific bacterial lineage, which

has produced obvious overestimations in the literature
(see papers by Hedges and colleagues). I think that the
introduction would benefit of a more complete discussion of past analyses and their potential problems.
Authors' response
Although the use of relaxed clocks and more realistic
models of sequence evolution can mitigate the problem
of rate heterogeneity, the lack of robust calibration points
remains a major challenge to established a timescale for
bacterial evolution. We agree with the reviewer's comments and have expanded the introduction as suggested.
Reviewer comments
On a more specific issue, is Ka/Ks applicable to large evolutionary distances such as those analyzed here considering molecular saturation?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/35

do not include a Conclusions section. The comprehensive
abstracts required of Biology Direct articles seem to reduce
the need for a separate Conclusions section.
Reviewer comments
Page 3: when referring to past analyses on dating of bacteria I think it would be the right place to cite Hedges (1,2).
Authors' response
We have added the suggested citations.
Reviewer comments
Page 4: a large audience would benefit for a clear definition of calibration point.
Authors' response
We have revised the sentence to clarify the definition.

Authors' response
We selected pairs of genomes that are sufficiently, but not
excessively, diverged so that we would obtain reliable estimates of Ka and Ks. Of the 42 selected genome-pairs, the
median genome-wide Ks values ranged from 0.11 to 1.29
(average = 0.6), and Ka values ranged from 0.006 to 0.058
(average = 0.03). This range of Ks values suggests that saturation is unlikely to cause strong bias in our analysis.

Reviewer comments
Page 5: could you please mention in the text the 6 taxa,
what phyla they belong to, and a rapid overview of their
associations?

Reviewer comments
The authors suggest that it may be possible to date specific
lineages once at time by using genes that evolve uniformly
among the group (local clock). This suggestion is correct,
but I would have expected that the authors move over to
show a practical example. However, even in the presence
of such a clock, how would the authors deal with the
absence of clear calibration points? Finally, this is a short
interesting contribution on the problem of molecular dating for prokaryotes, which nevertheless leaves me hungry
for more.

Reviewer comments
Page 6: it may be better to say that the 42 pairs of bacterial
genomes were selected based on their evolutionary distance rather than on their sequence divergence, since it
may give the impression of circular reasoning.

Authors' response
The Buchnera-aphid system shows the feasibility of using
local clocks to date bacterial evolution. Unfortunately,
there is a paucity of accurate calibration points for free-living bacteria. We have expanded the last paragraph in the
Discussions to address this issue.

Authors' response
We have updated the legend of Figure 1 to provide an
overview of symbiont-insect associations.

Authors' response
We have revised the sentence accordingly.
Reviewer comments
Discussion page 9: that Bacteria were the first cellular
organisms is a big statement, in my opinion the issue
remains open. By the way, the Archaea are never mentioned in the text, although molecular dating has been
done for this domain, could the authors comment?

Reviewer comments
Each paragraph is very short and ends a bit brutally, I
would suggest merging results and discussion, and then
write a conclusion session.

Authors' response
Since our manuscript is not concerned with the priority of
any particular Domain, we have revised the sentence
accordingly. We did not include Archaea in this paper
because the taxon sampling of available genome sequence
is still too sparse to perform analyses that involve closely
related pairs.

Authors' response
Perhaps we are being overly traditional, but our manuscripts typically partition the Results and Discussion, and
