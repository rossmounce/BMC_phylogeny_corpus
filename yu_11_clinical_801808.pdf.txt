Clinical epidemiology and molecular analysis of
hospitalized children with hand-foot and mouth
disease during 2009 in Shanghai

Introduction / objectives
We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features and
epidemiology of 1386 children with hand-foot and
mouth disease during 2009 at Children’s Hospital of
Fudan University and investigated some risk factors with
fatal cases. Besides, we also identified the pathogen of
116 patients.
Methods
All the clinical records and laboratory results were collected. A retrospective study was performed and reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was
used to identify the pathogen.
Results
A total of 1386 patients were enrolled in this report,
with onset median age 25 months. Among them, 62.4%
patients aged between 1 to 3 years and 67% patients
came from rural area. Fever (88.3%), rashes (99.2%),
cough (22.5%), vomiting (25.4%) were the most frequent
symptoms while myoclonus jerk, hypertension and
tachycardia mainly occurred in those fatal cases. Fatal
patients had higher fever, white-blood-cell counts and
blood glucose compared to those in stage 1and 2
(P<0.05), but not in C-reaction protein or cerebrospinal
fluid white-blood-cell counts. Besides these, we also
made etiologic analysis of 116 patients to identify 76
cases of enterovirus 71 infection, 4 cases of CA16 infection and 8 cases of other enterovirus infection. And we
found the Shanghai EV71 belonged to subgenotype C4
by the phylogenetic analysis.

Conclusion
The children under 3 years especially from rural area
are susceptible to the HFMD infection. Persistent high
fever and frequent vomiting, or myoclonus jerk, hypertension and tachycardiamay indicate severe tendency.
Some laboratory examinations can help us find the fatal
cases earlier. But a early pathogen identification especially enterovirus 71 is so important.
Disclosure of interest
None declared.
