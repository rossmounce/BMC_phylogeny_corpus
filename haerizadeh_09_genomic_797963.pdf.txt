Abstract
Background: Pollen, the male partner in the reproduction of flowering plants, comprises either
two or three cells at maturity. The current knowledge of the pollen transcriptome is limited to the
model plant systems Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa which have tri-cellular pollen grains at
maturity. Comparative studies on pollen of other genera, particularly crop plants, are needed to
understand the pollen gene networks that are subject to functional and evolutionary conservation.
In this study, we used the Affymetrix Soybean GeneChip® to perform transcriptional profiling on
mature bi-cellular soybean pollen.
Results: Compared to the sporophyte transcriptome, the soybean pollen transcriptome revealed
a restricted and unique repertoire of genes, with a significantly greater proportion of specifically
expressed genes than is found in the sporophyte tissue. Comparative analysis shows that, among
the 37,500 soybean transcripts addressed in this study, 10,299 transcripts (27.46%) are expressed
in pollen. Of the pollen-expressed sequences, about 9,489 (92.13%) are also expressed in
sporophytic tissues, and 810 (7.87%) are selectively expressed in pollen. Overall, the soybean
pollen transcriptome shows an enrichment of transcription factors (mostly zinc finger family
proteins), signal recognition receptors, transporters, heat shock-related proteins and members of
the ubiquitin proteasome proteolytic pathway.
Conclusion: This is the first report of a soybean pollen transcriptional profile. These data extend
our current knowledge regarding regulatory pathways that govern the gene regulation and
development of pollen. A comparison between transcription factors up-regulated in soybean and
those in Arabidopsis revealed some divergence in the numbers and kinds of regulatory proteins
expressed in both species.

Background
In flowering plants, pollen development occurs in the
anthers. The meiotic division of diploid sporogenous cells
gives rise to a tetrad of haploid microspores. The microspores then undergo an asymmetric mitotic division, giving rise to a smaller generative cell enveloped within a
larger vegetative cell [1]. The generative cell divides once
again to give rise to the two haploid sperm cells required
for double fertilization. In most plants, the pollen is bicellular at anther dehiscence, with the division of generative cells taking place during pollen tube growth in the
female tissues. However, in some cases such as crucifers
and grasses, this division takes place while the pollen is
still undergoing maturation in the anther.
In the last decade, the knowledge of pollen transcriptome
has emerged with the development of large-scale transcriptional profiling techniques. This is exemplified by a
number of studies carried out using model species such as
Arabidopsis thaliana [2-5] or Oryza sativa with a recent
report on allergen transcripts [6]. Studies on Arabidopsis
pollen transcriptome showed that 9.7% of the 13,977 pollen-expressed mRNAs were selectively expressed in pollen;
among them, many genes had an unknown function or
were reported to be functionally associated with signalling
pathways and cell wall metabolism [4]. These studies also
revealed differences among the cell cycle regulators,
cytoskeleton genes, and signalling in pollen as compared
to sporophytic tissues [2-5].

leaves and stems of 10-day-old soybean seedlings. The
raw intensity data generated from the microarray hybridization experiment were imported into AffylmGUI [7] and
were analysed as outlined in Materials and Methods.
When the normalized data were visually displayed by
scatter-plotting the log2-transformed signal intensities of
the two different samples, there was much complexity and
differences on the transcript pattern between pollen and
sporophytic tissues as indicated by the greater scatter of
the points in the plot in comparison to a similar plot
between sporophytic tissues [i.e.] stems, roots and leaves
(this study) versus shoot apical meristem (Haerizadeh et
al., unpublished) (Figure 1).
The soybean GeneChip® used contains probe sets for
37,500 transcripts and the resulting analysis revealed that
approximately 27% of these are expressed in the soybean
pollen while 75% are being expressed in sporophytic tissues. This difference reflects the specialization of pollen as

The current knowledge of the pollen transcriptome however,
is limited to Arabidopsis and rice that have tri-cellular pollen
grains at maturity. Comparative studies on pollen of other
genera, particularly legume crop plants, are needed to understand the pollen gene networks that are subjected to functional and evolutionary conservation. In this study, we
present the transcript profile of the mature soybean pollen
that is bi-cellular as compared to sporophytic tissues assayed
on the soybean GeneChip®. Among the transcripts identified
to be up-regulated in the pollen in comparison to the sporophytic tissues, we observed many that are unknown as well
as transcripts with putative annotation. That has allowed us
to infer pollen regulatory roles for various families of transcription factors as well as products associated with protein
destination and storage, signal transduction, transporters
and heat shock-associated proteins. The data presented here
represent a rich source of novel target genes for further studies into molecular processes that govern the development of
pollen.

Results and discussion

compared to other tissues with respect to providing a specific set of transcripts for specific functions such as germination, pollen tube growth, and the subsequent process of
fertilization. Meanwhile, only 7.87% of the pollenexpressed genes are likely to be pollen-specific as no
'present' calls were detected for the corresponding probe
sets in the sporophytic tissues. A total of 8,763 transcripts
show statistically significant differential regulation in pollen as compared to sporophytic tissues with 1,686 of them
showing higher expression levels in the pollen than the
sporophytic tissues (at adjusted p-value < 0.05; Additional
File 1 and Additional File 2). When the expression pattern
for sporophytic tissue-expressed chlorophyll a/b binding
protein family members were examined, none of these
transcripts were represented in the pollen-expressed dataset and hence validate our experimental approach.
Functional categories of transcripts differentially
expressed in pollen
The transcripts represented by the soybean GeneChip®
have been annoated as described in Materials and Methods. This allowed us to examine functional categories of
transcripts that are up- or down-regulated in the pollen. As
shown in Figure 2, although many of the genes fall into
"unclassified" or "no homology to known protein" categories, the general distribution and over-representation of
categories such as intracellular trafficking, signal transduction and transcription are evident. The up-regulated transcripts in the "no homology to known protein" category
provide a valuable opportunity for the initiation of many
functional analysis experiments toward an in-depth

understanding of the pollen gene regulatory system and
its components, which are presently incomplete.
It is interesting to note that none of the significantly upregulated transcripts encode products that are related to
the small RNA pathways (Additional File 1). A closer
inspection of the expression values revealed that all of the
small RNA pathways associated transcripts have signals
below the detection threshold. This is consistent with a
previous report [3] although a recent study by the same
group has revealed the detection of 3 out of 15 genes of
the ARGONAUTE family that were previously below the
detection limit. The authors have attributed this discrepancy to "improved chemistry for sample processing, array
hybridization, and staining that resulted in a better signal
to noise ratio and thus a higher sensitivity" [8]. It is
equally likely that the small RNA pathways are only active
in the generative cells and hence further transcript profiling work on gametes shall resolve this issue.
Top 30 candidates up-regulated in the pollen
The top 30 most highly up-regulated transcripts in pollen
in comparison to sporophytic tissues are those predicted
to encode cell wall-related proteins such as pectate lyase
and pectin esterase family proteins, rapid alkalinization
factor (RALF), multi-copper oxidase, and some transporters, along with unknown and novel genes (Table 1). RALF,
a 5 kDa ubiquitous polypeptide in plants was first
reported as RALF gene in tobacco encoding a ubiquitous
115-amino acid protein, which is processed into a 5-kD
signaling peptide [9]. The peptide induced a rapid alkalinization of the culture medium of tobacco suspensioncultured cells and a concomitant activation of an intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase [9]. RALF is considered as a potential signaling molecule and a putative RALF
receptor has been detected in plasma membranes [10].
RALF-LIKE 10 is selectively expressed in Arabidopsis pollen [5]. In our data on soybean pollen two RALF isoforms,
RALF-Like 11 and RALF-LIKE 19 show selective expression
in pollen. The conserved up-regulation of genes encoding
RALF-like signaling peptides in soybean and Arabidopsis
pollen implicates its essential role in pollen development.
However, further experiments involving gain-of-function
or loss-of-function mutants are required to address this
hypothesis.

Meanwhile, 9 out of 30 highly abundant transcripts in
mature soybean pollen are predicted to encode members
of pectin esterase and pectate lyase families of cell-wall
loosening enzymes (Table 1). Corresponding genes in
Arabidopsis were among those with the highest expression
in pollen [2,4,5]. It has been proposed that besides their
possible involvement in pollen tube wall modification,
these hydrolytic enzymes may be important for the penetration of the stigmatic tissues.

Transcription factors up-regulated in the soybean pollen
A search using the matching AGI of the soybean probe set
was performed at the Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/AtT
FDB/ to explore the different families of transcription factors represented by the up-regulated transcripts in the pollen to see which transcription factors might have a major
role in regulating activities in the mature pollen. Although
many of the transcripts are annotated as transcription factors, the corresponding Arabidopsis orthologues are yet to
be grouped under the 50 different families at the AtTFDB
collection and this is likely due to the lack of functional
knowledge of the genes concerned. Nevertheless, at least
16 different families of transcription factors are represented as listed in Table 2.

Zinc finger transcription factors are prominent in our differentially regulated gene data (25 genes). Although
reported as pollen-specific genes in 1992 [11], zinc finger
proteins act as master regulators (transcriptional repressors) in neuronal development, animal germ cells, and
spermatogenesis [12]. For instance, Blimp1/Prdm1, a zinc
finger transcriptional repressor, is the key regulator of
early axis formation and primordial germ cell specifica-

tion in animals [13]. Also, it has been shown that a targeted silencing of Ovol1 (also known as movo1), a zincfinger transcription factor, leads to germ cell degeneration
and defective sperm production in mice [14]. These proteins are also reported to be important regulatory molecules in various plant developmental processes, such as
apical meristem development via chromatin remodeling
process, anther development, and flowering.
It has been recently reported that a class of MYB factors
regulate sperm cell formation in plants [15]. We identified
three members of the MYB family as up-regulated in soybean pollen (Table 2). Certain MADS box proteins have
been identified as pollen-specific in Antirrhinum [16] and
have also been reported as an important non-classical
transcriptional factor family in Arabidopsis pollen. Pina et
al reported the over-representation of MADS box genes in
the Arabidopsis pollen transcriptome, with 17 genes
expressed in pollen and nine showing enrichment in pollen [3].
Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger transcription factors
are up-regulated in soybean pollen. The PHD finger may
promote both gene expression and repression through

To investigate the different types of transcription factor families
represented in the up-regulated transcripts in soybean pollen, a
search using the matching AGI of the soybean probe set was
performed at the Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server
http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/AtTFDB/.

interactions with trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3
(H3K4), a universal modification seen at the beginning of
active genes [17,18]. PHDs are associated with chromatin
condensation during mitosis or meiosis, general transcriptional machinery, and a transcriptional regulator
required for proper development, flowering, and fertility
of plants [19,20].
Meanwhile, very little is known about the physiological
and developmental roles of WRKY proteins, another family of transcription factor up-regulated in the soybean pollen. Although the DNA binding site of WRKY proteins is
well-defined, determining the individual role of WRKY
factors remains a challenge [21,22]. Though the function
of WRKY proteins in pollen is not clear, our data suggest
an important and novel regulatory role for these proteins
in soybean pollen.
A member of the basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factor also shows differential expression in soybean
pollen; this group also shows a similar pattern of expression in Arabidopsis pollen. bHLH proteins are a family of
transcription factors that bind to their DNA targets as dimmers [23,24]. They have been characterized in non-plant
eukaryotes as important regulatory components in diverse
biological processes such as the control of cell proliferation and the development of specific cell lineages. It has
been shown that Tcfl5, a testis-specific bHLH protein,
interacts with the regulatory region of the Calmegin gene
promoter as a testis-specific activator of this gene and
other testis-specific genes in mouse spermatogenesis [25].

Whether pollen-expressed bHLH transcription factors regulate sperm cell specific gene expression remains to be
determined. Two NAC transcription factor family members are up-regulated in soybean pollen, suggesting a role
of this family of proteins in the regulation of pollen genes,
a function that to the best of our knowledge has not been
reported for this class of genes.
Transcripts associated with the ubiquitin system
Post-translational protein modifications play a critical
role in most cellular processes through their unique ability to rapidly and reversibly alter the functions of synthesized proteins, multi-protein complexes, and intracellular
structures. In eukaryotes, such modifications frequently
occur by attaching a small polypeptide to the target protein. Ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-related modifiers
(SUMO) are among those polypeptides [26]. Approximately 5% of Arabidopsis genes encode proteins that are
predicted to be involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and the regulation of protein degradation by ubiquitination is important in many plant processes [27].
Ubiquitin ligases that are associated with membraneenclosed organelles are required for polarized pollen tube
growth [28]. Furthermore, there has been a report of the
enrichment of ubiquitin family genes in Arabidopsis
sperm cells [8]. Our data contain many ubiquitin family
genes, suggesting a role for this group of genes in pollen
development through ubiquitin-mediated protein turnover (Table 3).
Signal transduction and transporters
Approximately, 100 different signalling proteins, such as
14-3-3 proteins and kinases are up-regulated at the gene
level in the soybean pollen. 14-3-3 proteins are among the
most important and versatile proteins in eukaryotes [29].
They interact with many regulatory proteins like transcription factors (by protein-protein interaction) and alter
their activity, in addition to performing regulatory roles
by shuttling proteins between various cellular locations.
In plants, it has been reported that 14-3-3 proteins regulate the H-ATPase pumps of the plasma membrane [30].
As expected, calcium-related proteins are enriched in soybean pollen, as they are important regulators of pollen
germination and tube growth. Calcium and calcium sensor proteins such as calmodulin (CaM), a universal calcium sensor protein, play important roles in gene
regulation, and hence plant growth and development
[31,32]. It has been shown that calcium transporters are
key regulators of pollen tube development and fertilization in flowering plants [33]. In addition, CaM binding
proteins, such as maize pollen calmodulin-binding protein (MPCBP) and NPG1 (no pollen germination1) in Arabidopsis, are specifically expressed in pollen and regulate
pollen germination, as supported by the observation that
down-regulation of these genes resulted in the inability of

the pollen to germinate [34,35]. As expected, we identified many calcium-related genes in our soybean dataset
(Table 4). Some of these proteins are already known to be
pollen-specific, and many are highly up-regulated (up to
256-fold) as compared to sporophytic tissues, highlighting the importance of these proteins in pollen biology.
Transport proteins, including membrane pumps, represent one of the largest up-regulated gene sets in the soybean pollen (Additional File 1). Table 5 shows a
representative list of transcripts classified under the functional category of "transporter" and this includes those
predicted to encode SUGAR TRANSPORTER 4 (STP4),
ARABIDOPSIS H(+)-ATPASE 8 (AHA8), AHA9, monosac-

charide/H+ symporter (STP), amino acid transporter, Ca2+
pumps and a putative phosphate translocator. Similar categories of transcripts have been reported to be up-regulated in Arabidopsis pollen [36].
Higher plants possess two distinct families of sugar carriers: the disaccharide transporters that primarily catalyse
sucrose transport and the monosaccharide transporters
that mediate the transport of a variable range of monosaccharides [37]. The STP4 gene encodes a membrane
located monosachharide H+ symporter that can catalyze
the uptake of various monosaccharides [38]. High expression of monosachharide transporter in soybean pollen
points towards glucose and fructose as preferred source of

nutrition for pollen germination and tube growth. A similar pollen specific expression of a putative hexose transporter gene was reported in Arabidopsis and Petunia
[39,40]. It has been proposed that in species where monosachharides are taken up preferentially, sucrose might be
hydrolysed to glucose and fructose by a cell-wall invertase
before uptake by monosachharide transporters in the
growing pollen tube.
High up-regulation of H+ATPases including those encoding AHA8 and AHA9 in soybean pollen points to an essential role similar to their Arabidopsis and Nicotiana
counterparts. The expression of AHA8 and AHA9 has been
shown to be pollen-specific in Arabidopsis [3]. Recently, a
pollen H+ ATPases has been shown to be associated with
the tip growth in Nicotiana pollen tubes [41]. Uptake and
translocation of cationic nutrients play essential roles in

plant growth, nutrition, signal transduction, and development [42]. The plant cation transporter gene families
include potassium transporters and channels, sodium
transporters, calcium antiporters, cyclic nucleotide-gated
channels and cation diffusion facilitator proteins. Our
data show that several of the members of cation/proton
exchanger family proteins are expressed at a higher level in
the soybean pollen in comparison to those of sporophytic
tissues. Bock et al [36] reported that fourteen members of
the cation/proton exchanger (CHX) gene family are
expressed late in pollen development and also raised
questions about their roles and multiplicity. The possibility that they are localized to different intracellular compartments was proposed. It is noteworthy that a similar
multiplicity of cation/proton exchanger family genes that
are up-regulated in the soybean pollen is apparent in our
data.

WD-40 repeat proteins
WD-40 repeat proteins are defined by the presence of four
or more repeating units containing a conserved core of
approximately 40 amino acids that usually end with tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD). WD-repeat proteins are conserved in animals and plants, where they participate in
complexes involved in chromatin metabolism and gene
expression [43-45]. They also have been reported to be
transcriptional repressors that interact either with corepressors or in a complex with histone deacetylases, to
regulate spermatogenesis, and to function as mitotic
checkpoints to ensure accurate chromosome segregation.
A number of WD-repeat protein are up-regulated in the
soybean pollen (Table 6) implicating their likely involvement in regulating pollen development.
Heat shock proteins
Heat shock proteins (HSPs)/chaperones) are divided in
five major families: the HSP70, the HSP60, the HSP 90,
the HSP 100 families and a small HSP family [46]. The
accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) under heat
and other abiotic stresses has been suggested to play a key
role in the acquisition of thermotolerance in plants and
other organisms. At the cell level these proteins are
responsible for protein folding, assembly, and translocation, and can assist in protein re-folding under stress conditions. Some studies could not detect heat shock
response in developing microspores or mature pollen of
various species [47,48] while others have shown that
many HSPs are expressed in microspores and mature pollen [49].

It is interesting to note that in our present study on mature
soybean pollen transcriptome, there is significant up-regulation of transcripts encoding heat shock proteins as well
as heat shock transcription factors HSFB2A and HSFA5
(Table 7; Figure 3). A recent study on transcriptome
changes during pollen germination showed significant
up-regulation of HSPs during pollen germination and

tube growth, and many of these HSPs are undetectable at
the expression level in mature pollen [50]. These authors
proposed that these HSPs might function as molecular
chaperones for protein modification processes during
pollen germination and tube growth. Heat shock factors
are the primary molecules responsible for activating genes
responsive to both heat stress and other stressors [51]. The
up-regulation of heat shock transcription factor HSFB2A
and HSFA5 in soybean pollen matches similar up regulation of its counterpart in Arabidopsis pollen [51]. The plant
HSF family has been reported to comprise more than 20
members with recent evidence pointing towards the
unique functions of individual HSFs in signal transduction pathways activated in response to environmental
stress and during development. Conserved up-regulation
of HSFB2A and HSFA5 in both soybean and Arabidopsis
pollen points towards unique role of these transcription
factors in pollen development and possibly in gamete
development. It is interesting to note that heat shock proteins are known for their role in animal spermatogenesis
by acting as molecular chaperones to assist with protein
folding [52].

Conclusion
This is the first report on transcriptional profiling of the
pollen of a major legume crop. The current knowledge
from pollen transcriptome profiling with microarrays is
limited to the model plant, Arabidopsis. Our data will
extend the current understanding of pollen biology and
gene regulation by providing a set of robustly selected, differentially expressed genes in soybean pollen. We also
provide a number of genes with unknown functions that
are highly expressed in the pollen and could be tested in
many functional analyses to increase our understanding
of gene regulation in pollen. Most of the genes important
for sporophytic organs are highly repressed in pollen. Regulation of these genes is probably controlled at the transcriptional level by transcriptional factors and chromatin
remodelling machinery, as pollen contains a variety of

reported in this study should provide new insights into
the understanding of plant male gametophyte development other than the current knowledge provided by
research on model plants.

Methods
Plant growth and pollen collection
Soybean plants [Glycine max. (L) Merr. Cv. Bragg] were
used in this study. The plants used for pollen collection
were grown in a temperature-controlled greenhouse with
a 16 hour light/8 hour dark photoperiod at 30°C. They
were grown in vermiculite with the addition of a slow
release fertilizer (osmocote). When the plants had
matured and developed significant biomass, flowering
was induced by changing the photoperiod to 12 hours.
Pollen was collected on coverslips by rubbing isolated
anthers together, and anther tissue was removed from the
coverslip prior to freezing at -80°C. Pollen purity and viability was assessed by microscopic observations and fluorescein diacetate test (Figure 4).

RNA isolation and microarray hybridization
Total RNA from pollen or sporophytic tissues (primary
stem, primary roots and mature leaves of 10-day-old soybean seedlings) was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy
Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and eluted with nuclease-free water.
Subsequent cDNA labelling and Affymetrix Soybean
GeneChip hybridization was carried out by AGRF (Australian Genome Research Facility, Melbourne, Australia)
using 3 μg of total RNA according to protocols outlined in
http://www.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manu

Analysis of expression data
The GeneChip® Soybean Genome Array (Affymetrix, Inc.)
containing probe sets for 37,500 transcripts was used in
this study. Three biological replicates for pollen and two
biological replicates for sporophytic tissues were used.
Raw numeric values representing the signal of each feature
were imported into AffylmGUI (Affymetrix linear modeling Graphical User Interface [7] that uses the Empirical
Bayes linear modeling approach of Smyth (2005)[53] for
identifying differentially expressed genes in pollen. The
data were normalized using Robust Multiarray Averaging
(RMA) method and a linear model was then used to average data between replicate arrays and to look for variability between them [7]. The list of transcripts that were
detected to be differentially expressed at adjusted p-value
of < 0.05 were used for all subsequent analysis. All microarray data have been submitted to Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) at NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo under the accession GSE 12286.

To obtain the number of pollen-expressed genes
(expressed in pollen and sporophytic tissues), we collect
the expression signals, average expression values, and
present/absent calls from AffylmGUI (RMA data) and
sorted the data in Excel. To find pollen-specific group of
genes, we used the following criteria: 1) showed statistically significant differential expression at adjusted pvalue
< 0.05; 2) possessed a signal greater than or equal to 100
on each replicate; 3) had a cut-off value of a 2-fold change;
and 4) had "Absence" calls on all of the sporophytic replicates.
The annotation for the transcripts represented by the soybean GeneChip® was downloaded from the Seed Development website http://estdb.biology.ucla.edu/seed/. The
annotation is based on the best BLASTX match of the corresponding soybean sequences against TAIR Arabidopsis
protein database or NCBI non-redundant protein database (expect value < 0.01). Functional categories for these
