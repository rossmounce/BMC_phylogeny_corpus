Vanishing native American dog lineages

Abstract
Background: Dogs were an important element in many native American cultures at the time Europeans arrived.
Although previous ancient DNA studies revealed the existence of unique native American mitochondrial
sequences, these have not been found in modern dogs, mainly purebred, studied so far.
Results: We identified many previously undescribed mitochondrial control region sequences in 400 dogs from
rural and isolated areas as well as street dogs from across the Americas. However, sequences of native American
origin proved to be exceedingly rare, and we estimate that the native population contributed only a minor fraction
of the gene pool that constitutes the modern population.
Conclusions: The high number of previously unidentified haplotypes in our sample suggests that a lot of
unsampled genetic variation exists in non-breed dogs. Our results also suggest that the arrival of European
colonists to the Americas may have led to an extensive replacement of the native American dog population by
the dogs of the invaders.

Background
Dogs colonized the Americas with early human groups
from Asia [1] and were widespread by the time Europeans arrived late in the 15th century [2]. Most of the
dogs around the world today have mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) control region sequences that form a welldefined phylogenetic clade (Clade I) [3]. Genetic characterization of ancient American dogs (samples obtained
from human settlements that had not been in contact
with Europeans, hereafter referred to as native American
dogs) revealed a unique set of mtDNA sequences that
clustered within this clade, but have not been observed
in extant dogs [e.g. [3-6]]. Most notably, a subclade (Ia)
has so far only been identified in ancient American dogs
and had a frequency of 62% in ancient Latin American
animals [1]. However, most genetic studies are based on
purebred dogs, and since most internationally recognized breeds today are primarily European or Asian in
origin, it is possible that American dog lineages have
been excluded.
To determine contemporary distribution and frequency of the native American dog lineages in the

Americas (both North America and South America), we
analyzed the fragment of the mtDNA control region
comparable to available genetic data for ancient native
American dogs in 400 village and non-breed dogs from
Alaska to Patagonia. These included dogs living in small
isolated settlements in Canada, Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, the Orinoco Llanos, the Andes, the
Amazon basin and Patagonia (Figure 1). This novel data
set allowed us to compare the genetic composition of
past and present populations, and to use statistical
population genetic models to estimate the maximum
possible contribution of pre-Columbian dogs to the
extant population.

Results and discussion
In the total sample of 400 modern American dogs (Genbank numbers in Table S1), we identified 40 unique
mtDNA haplotypes, of which 23 (57.5%) had not been
identified in previous studies that included samples
from around the world. Haplotypes were widespread
across sampled localities and we did not detect any geographic pattern. This shows that significant undescribed
diversity is likely to be present in non-purebred dogs
[5]. In addition, the level of mtDNA nucleotide diversity
in the present Latin American population (θπ = 0.017,
ˆ
Ne = 40,000) indicates an effective population size simiˆ
lar to that in ancient America (θπ = 0.015, Ne = 35,000).

More than half of the haplotypes (23/40) and individuals (259/400) belonged to the common Clade I. However, none of the sequences was identical to nor
clustered within the ancient native American dog Clade
Ia (Figure 2). This striking difference in haplogroup frequencies between ancient and modern dogs suggests
that very little of the mtDNAs present in the extant
population trace back to the native American population
This could be due to either genetic drift or population
discontinuity between the two time points.
We investigated the probability of this result under different demographic models and found that the observation of a private haplogroup in the ancient sample with a
frequency as high as Ia allows rejection of complete continuity between ancient and present populations for an
extensive range of assumptions. For the constant size
population model (see Methods), we found that all models
with an assumed Ne > 3,000 could be rejected at the 5%
significance level, and the population expansion scenario
was similarly rejected for initial Ne > 2,100 (P < 0.05).

However, complete continuity is not a realistic model
since introduction of European dogs is known to have
occurred. Thus, we also tested the possible contribution of
the ancient population under a model where the current
Latin American dog population is a mixture of Old- and
New World populations (Figure 3). The simulations indiˆ
cated that given the estimated mitochondrial Ne, less than
10% of the ancestors of the modern American dog population are ancient American dogs (Figure 4). While based on
inferences from a single genetic marker, this upper limit
for the average genetic contribution of the ancient population is expected to apply also to the autosomal genomes of
extant dogs. However, we caution that the average genome-wide native American ancestry in the extant

population could be different if male and female dogs contributed an unequal number of offspring to the population
(i.e. there was an unequal sex ratio), the mitochondrion
has been subject to selection, or if other assumptions in
the demographic model (see Methods) have been violated
in the recent history of the population.
We also examined if ancient American haplotypes other
than those in Clade Ia were present in the modern sample,
and identified a single modern haplotype derived from a
pre-Columbian haplotype (Figure 5). This previously undescribed haplotype was found in two dogs from the Maya
villages of Pisté and Chan Kom, both in the State of Yucatán, Mexico (M64, M76; Additional file 1: Table S1) and is
most closely related to the ancient Mexican haplotype

D32 [1], from which it differed by a single substitution.
Although these communities are in close contact with
modern life, they still live largely according to indigenous
traditions, including a lack of organized dog husbandry.
The mtDNA of these two individuals may be inherited
from the pre-Columbian population, and thus indicate that
not all ancient lineages went completely extinct.
Arrival by Columbus to the Americas in 1492 was
quickly followed by the arrival of conquistadors, missionaries and colonists from Europe with their livestock, pets,
commensals and pathogens, all of which had an important impact on native American populations and culture
[7,8]. Our results show that native American dog populations were also impacted. The extent of this impact is
unexpected because of the large historical population size
of dogs in the Americas and the existence of potential
refugia (e.g. isolated human groups) where native lineages
could have survived. Several factors might have contributed to this replacement, including direct persecution
[7,9], preference for the often larger newly arrived dogs,
or susceptibility to introduced infectious diseases. Future
studies including more ancient and modern dogs and
more genetic markers, such as neutral autosomal markers, genes of known function and Y-chromosome markers, will contribute to a deeper understanding of the
causes of and extent to which the native American dog
population has changed since the arrival of Columbus.

Conclusions
Using molecular data and statistical modeling, we
demonstrate that an important amount of mitochondrial

Castroviejo-Fisher et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:73
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/73

haplotype diversity exists in undersampled non-breed
dog populations, and that the breadth of the impact of
post-Columbian colonization on the Americas has been
underestimated. The extensive replacement of the native
American dog population inferred from our data set
illustrates that even cultural and biological elements that
are not specific targets of invaders can be profoundly
affected at a continental scale and in a short period of
time.

Methods
We used published primers (ThrL and DLHc) and PCR
conditions [1] to amplify and sequence in both directions a fragment of 425 bp from the mitochondrial control region (Table S1). Sequences were compared to
available sequences in GenBank with megablast to check
for nuclear insertions and new haplotypes. Additional
published sequences from dogs [1,3,4,10] and wolves
[10-14] were included to place our study in a historical
and geographical framework (e.g. to root phylogenetic
trees) as in [1-4].
We used the E-INS-i option in MAFFT [15] to align
all sequences included in the study. We performed phylogenetic analysis of the complete dataset with and without removing redundant haplotypes using MacClade
4.06 [16]. We ran 1000 searches and 2000 bootstrap
replicates in Garli0.96 [17] to search for a maximum
likelihood topology under the model TrN+I+G selected
by Modeltest 3.7 [18] using the Akaike information criterion. Sequences that clustered in Clade I [3], were
further analyzed by constructing haplotype networks.
We focused on Clade I because all but one of the
ancient American dog sequences cluster within this
clade. We built median-joining [19] haplotype networks
in NETWORK 4.5 http://www.fluxus-engineering.com/
and a statistical parsimony network in TCS 1.21 [20]
with gaps as an informative fifth state. Both methods
yielded similar results and only the result of the former
analysis is shown.
We estimated mitochondrial effective population size
ˆ
( Ne) for the ancient sequences described by reference
[1] and a corresponding subset of our modern
sequences where all samples collected north of Mexico
were excluded in order to better match the geographical
range of the ancient dogs from reference [1] that died
before Columbus first arrived to the Americas. We used
nucleotide diversity π as a direct estimate of the population-scaled mutation rate θπ and the expression θ π =
2Neμ where μ is the mutation rate per nucleotide and
generation (note that Ne will be affected by inclusion of
multiple clades). We computed π using DNAsp
v.5.00.07 [21], and used a conservative estimate of μ in
the dog mitochondrial control region that assumed a

divergence time between gray wolves and coyotes 2 million years ago (2.13 × 10-7 per generation) [4]. We note
that assuming a 1 million year divergence time (e.g.
ˆ
[22]) would result in higher estimates of Ne and thus
decrease the probability of observing large differences
between samples from different time points even
further. We also note that mtDNA data is not optimal
ˆ
for accurately estimating Ne in natural populations, but
its use here is motivated by our interest for the possible
magnitude of genetic drift acting on American dog
mitochondria, particularly in the last ~1000 years (see
below), and by the fact that no autosomal sequence data
is currently available.
We investigated the probability of observing a private
haplogroup in the ancient sample with a frequency as
high as Clade Ia in a hypothesis-testing framework for
three different population genetic models for the demographic history of American dogs using Serial Sim-Coal
[23,24], the only coalescent simulator currently available
that allows modeling of both population structure and
samples from different time points. By simulating 10,000
independent genealogical histories and investigating the
resulting topologies with custom scripts, we approximated the probability that at least 8 of 13 lineages
sampled 1000 years ago (corresponding to the ancient
Latin American samples) [1] would be monophyletic
with respect to 299 lineages sampled at the present (corresponding to modern Latin American samples included
in the study; Figure 3A), given different assumptions
about Ne. The general approach of estimating the possible contribution of Native American dogs to the extant
gene pool in a simulation-based hypothesis-testing framework was chosen because few analytical tools (i.e.
mathematical models) have been developed to deal with
probabilities under the structured coalescent with temporal samples. Simulations thus provide a flexible
alternative.
First, we tested a demographic model with a single
continuous population that either maintained a constant
size during all of its history or started growing exponentially 200 generations ago to an Ne of 15,000. To investigate the possible contribution of the native American
dog population to the current population, we constructed an isolation-admixture model more in agreement with historical evidence (Figure 3B). Starting from
a single population at the present, the lineages in the
population were divided into two isolated populations
400 years ago (representing the post-Columbian colonization of the Americas by Europeans) with probability c
and 1-c, respectively. At 1000 years ago, 13 new samples
were taken from one of the subpopulations (New
World, representing the data available on ancient Latin
American dogs [1]). At 13,000 years further in the past

Castroviejo-Fisher et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:73

the American population underwent a bottleneck,
implying a tenfold reduction on its effective size, and
was joined together again with the Old World population at 14,000 years ago, representing the isolation of
American dogs from the Eurasian populations from
which they originated [1]. The exact time American and
Eurasian populations were isolated is the subject of
much controversy, so we use this conservative number
(14,000 years before present). However, we found that
the timing of this event and the severity of the bottleneck had only marginal effects on the probability of a
private ancient haplogroup compared to the admixture
proportions. We investigated the effect of assuming a
generation time of both 2 and 3 years.
