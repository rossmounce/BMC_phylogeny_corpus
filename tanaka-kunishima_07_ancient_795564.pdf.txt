Abstract
Background: In spite of the recent accumulation of genomic data, the evolutionary pathway in the
individual genes of present-day living taxa is still elusive for most genes. Among ion channels, inward
K+ rectifier (IRK) channels are the fundamental and well-defined protein group. We analyzed the
genomic structures of this group and compared them among a phylogenetically wide range with
our sequenced Halocynthia roretzi, a tunicate, IRK genomic genes.
Results: A total of 131 IRK genomic genes were analyzed. The phylogenic trees of amino acid
sequences revealed a clear diversification of deuterostomic IRKs from protostomic IRKs and
suggested that the tunicate IRKs are possibly representatives of the descendants of ancestor forms
of three major groups of IRKs in the vertebrate. However, the exon-intron structures of the
tunicate IRK genomes showed considerable similarities to those of Caenorhabditis. In the vertebrate
clade, the members in each major group increased at least four times those in the tunicate by
various types of global gene duplication. The generation of some major groups was inferred to be
due to anti-tandem (palindromic) duplication in early history. The intron insertion points greatly
decreased during the evolution of the vertebrates, remaining as a unique conservation of an intron
insertion site in the portion of protein-protein interaction within the coding regions of all
vertebrate G-protein-activated IRK genes.
Conclusion: From the genomic survey of a family of IRK genes, it was suggested that the ancient
intron insertion sites and the unique palindromic genomic duplication evolutionally shaped this
membrane protein family.

Background
Although a vast amount of data on the genomic structures
of genes of major phyla in animal, plant, and microbial
kingdoms has been accumulated as a result of many

recent successful projects of whole genome shotgun DNA
sequencing of biologically and medically important taxa
[1-7], the evolutional pathway and physiological significance of individual genome gene structures, such as the

conservation of intron insertions, duplication of genes,
and development of gene regulatory sequences of the
present-day living taxa are still elusive and unclear for
most genes. Recent large population studies derived from
the established genome databases have promoted our
understanding of intron significance, favoring the exon
theory or the intron early theory, though many points
remain to be discussed and clarified [8-12]. Similarly, we
know that gene duplication by the tandem repeat or chromosomal duplication must be the major evolutional
power to drive simple to complex living systems at least in
the vertebrate clade [13-17]. However, for individual
genes the exact evidence is still in short availability
because of the gene divergence of the whole genome chromosomes in the present-day organisms on the evolutionary pathway from the ancestor organisms, though the
recent excellent whole genome studies on the Saccharomycetes have greatly advanced our understanding about
these matters [18-20]. Further, although the eukaryotic
genomic complexity may be initiated by the non-adaptive
fixation of genetic drift resulting from a reduction of the
effective population size [21], at least in the secondary
development, it is plausible to correlate the evolution of
the genomic structure to the adaptation of organisms to
new environmental niches, such as, the functional evolution of the proteins as the gene products [22]. However,
little is known regarding the mechanisms except the proposal that the borders of domains in the protein are represented by the exon boundaries, thus being a proposal of
physiological support for the exon theory [23-25].
Ion channels are one of the major and important protein
groups functioning for regulating the intra- and extracellular ionic environments and for the signal transduction
of intracellular and intercellular systems [26]. Among ion
channels, the inward K+ rectifier (IRK) channels comprise
the most fundamental and simple protein group, having
two transmembrane segments and one pore-forming
region [27,28]. The physiological functions are well studied in both protostomia and deuterostomia, and almost
all members of genes have been sequenced at least in the
mammals, such as human, mouse, and rat, by cDNA cloning or by genome projects [26,28].
Recently, we have sequenced three Halocynthia roretzi IRK
genomic clones, of which cDNA clones have been known
[29,30], being TuIRKA, TuGIRKAa, and TuGIRKB clones.
Furthermore, the urochordate, Ciona intestinalis, genome
projects [4] have allowed a genomic survey of tunicate IRK
channel genes for molecular evolutionary analysis in
comparison with the genes of both deuterostomal and
protostomal clades. This has occurred because the urochordate genes have been known to locate at the branching point for the early vertebrate divergence within the
deuterostomal clades, as shown in the recent exhaustive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/143

comparative study of ion channel genes viewed from the
annotation of the Ciona unochordate genes [31].
In the present study, we attempted to analyze the genomic
structures of a group of proteins, which are definitely
defined functionally, and to compare them among a phylogenetically wide range, including protostomal to deuterostomal clades. We also aimed to elucidate the functional
and evolutional significance of intronic insertion, intronic
preservation, gene duplication on the chromosomes, and
the relationship between the genome structure and the
expressed protein structure or physiological function of
the organism.

Results
Genomic sequences of tunicate inward K+ rectifier genes
We determined genomic sequences of three inward K+ rectifier genes, TuIRKA, TuGIRKAa, and TuGIRKB, cloned
from a genomic library of a tunicate, Halocynthia roretzi
[see Additional file 1]. With previously reported respective
cDNA sequences [29,30] [see Additional file 2], their
exons and introns in their coding regions were precisely
determined [see Additional files 1 and 2]. These sequences
covered entire coding regions, including all introns, 5'
upper stream regions, and most of the 3' lower stream
regions (Fig. 1 and [see Additional file 3]). All intron exon
junctions, which existed in the coding regions, revealed
the
mammalian-conserved
splicing
characteristic
sequences, such as the GT of splice donor sites at the initiation of introns and the AG of splice acceptor sites at the
3' terminal of respective introns (Fig. 2 and [see Additional file 4]). The average exon length was about 100 bp
and was considerably short in comparison with those
found in mammalian Kcnj genes. The average intron
length was about 500 bp; thus these genomic sequences
revealed considerably large numbers of intron insertions,
from 8 to 11, within a rather short whole coding length of
about 1000 bp of IRK genes [see Additional file 1].
Although the insertions were apparently evenly distributed among the coding regions, all three IRK genomes
revealed characteristic intron insertions in the functionally important and thereby the strongly conserved
sequence portions of the membrane-spanning regions
and the ion pore regions or limes of those regions (Fig. 1).
The phylogenetic tree and a comparison of Halocynthia
IRK AA sequences with those of other animal IRK genes
Thanks to many recent whole genome projects, there are
many numbers of IRK genomic sequences, which are
determined over their whole genome regions. Among
them, as the first step, the genomic sequences of the same
tunicate Ciona IRK genes, human IRK genes, Caenorhabditis elegans IRK genes, Drosophila melanogaster, and Anopheles gambiae genes were compared with the sequences of
Halocynthia roretzi IRK genes. With the amino acid (AA)

sequences inferred from the JGI Ciona genome database,
from the NCBI GenBank and Genome database, or from
the Ensembl database, the AA sequences of all IRK proteins from the seven taxa were aligned by using the
ClustalX1.83 program, and their phylogenetic tree was
made by the Neighbor Joining Method in the Mega3 v3.1
program (Fig. 3). As the outgroup, the seven bacterial IRKlike proteins were chosen, including KirBAC1.1, of which
the molecular structure was recently determined by X-rays
[32]. Although some branches were not significant
according to Bootstrap values, i.e., less than 50%, the tree
revealed the following three points. First, the three IRK
proteins in Halocynthia roretzi revealed corresponding
close homologues in Ciona intestinalis, respectively. Moreover, one other IRK gene existed in the tunicates. Second,
the three types of tunicate IRK, elementary IRK, GIRK, and
possibly ATP-regulated IRK, were representatives of three
major groups of the human IRK proteins. All protostomic
IRKs were grouped differently from Halocynthia IRKs,
though they may show some similarity to a putative Ciona
ATP-regulated type IRK. Prokaryotic IRKs are all evolutionally different from those eukaryotic ones. To illustrate
the major phylogenetic evolution of IRK genes more simply and clearly, we aligned the AA sequences of tunicate,
Caenorhabditis, and bacterial IRK proteins, and the tree
was made, as shown in Fig. 4. All internal branches in the
tree were verified by a Bootstrap test, suggesting that the
elementary IRK group and G-protein-activated group
diversified from the putative ATP-regulated type in the
tunicate clade later than the deuterostomic and protostomic diversification in the ancestor IRKs, possibly one of
the putative ATP-regulated types. The results further confirmed that the IRKs of protostomic clade were different
from those of the deuterostomic clade, but they evolved
after the eukaryotic diversification from prokaryotic evolution.
Comparison of intron exon structures of IRK genes
between protostomic and deuterostomic clades
As described above, 6 to 11 introns were inserted in the
coding regions of the Halocynthia IRK genes. However,
108 IRK genes of the vertebrate clade, which are extracted
from recently established genomic databases listed in
Additional file 5 [see Additional file 5], revealed relatively
few or no introns in their coding regions. Figure 5 illustrates frequency histograms of intron numbers in all IRK
genes examined. Figure 5A, 5B, and 5C represents the histograms for the three major groups of IRKs of the vertebrates, that is, ATP-regulated, elementary, and G-proteinactivated IRKs, respectively. The results indicate that the
intron numbers were significantly larger in the tunicate
IRKs, but they were rather few either in the amniotic or
anamniotic vertebrates, though the anamniotic vertebrates might show some larger numbers, especially in the
case of ATP-regulated IRKs. For the protostomic clade, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/143

Caenorhabditis definitely revealed the large number of 9,
but the Drosophila and Anopheles revealed relatively small
numbers of less than 4, as shown in Fig. 5D. In Figure 6
and 7, 7 tunicate, 6 Caenorhabditis, and 7 bacterial IRK AA
sequences were aligned, and the portions of intron insertion are illustrated [see Additional file 6]. In either tunicates or Caenorhabditis, the sites for insertions were strictly
conserved between the orthologous protein pairs, at least
in the major feature regions of IRK genes. As in the case of
tunicates, the Caenorhabditis IRK genes revealed insertion
sites at the physiologically important membrane regions
and the ion pore regions. The further three common insertion sites were found between the tunicates and the
Caenorhabditis (Fig. 6 and 7, yellow background and
boxed characters). Thus in terms of the AA sequences, the
Caenorhabditis and the tunicate IRKs were separately
grouped and evolved differently, but the macroscopic
genomic structures seemed to keep commonality between
them.
Naturally bacterial IRK protein AA sequences show no
intron insertion, but in alignment with eukaryotic IRK AA
sequences, they revealed six intrinsic gaps in their conserved and feature regions as the IRK sequences, showing
that no eukaryotic equivalent sequences existed in the
modern prokaryotes. However, it should be noted that
either edge of the respective gap seemed to correspond at
least to some of the intron insertion sites in the
Caenorhabditis genomes in the five cases out of these six
gaps (Fig. 6 and 7; purple background characters in the
bacterial AA sequences).
Comparison of AA sequences and genomic structures
among 7 tunicate IRK genes and 108 vertebrate IRK genes
In Figure 8, the phylogenetic tree obtained from the alignment of a total of 115 IRK AA sequences of tunicates and
vertebrates is illustrated. As shown above in the tree composed of human and tunicate sequences, the 3 major
functional groups of IRK proteins are exactly represented
in the major branches of the tree composed from 115 IRK
sequences. And it was concluded that the 2 representative
IRKs of tunicate GIRKs, TuGIRKAa and B, and the elementary IRK, TuIRKA, must be descendants of the ancestor
forms of vertebrate GIRK and IRK, respectively. Although
grouping the putative Ciona ATP-regulated IRK as a
descendant of the ancestor sequence for ATP-regulated
IRKs, including ROMKs, was not supported by a Bootstrap
test, there were suggestive data to assign the common
ancestor for all vertebrate IRKs to one of the relatives of
the ATP-regulated types. From the survey of the genomic
databases, a novel evolutional correlation was found
between ATP-regulated IRK genes and G-protein-activated
IRK genes, revealing the antitandem or palindromic
duplication (Table 1).

using the Amino Poisson correction model with Gamma-distributed Rates among sites (Gamma parameter 2.0) and Bootstrap
as the test of inferred branches (Repetition 500), including 295 sites with a pair-wise deletion of Gap/Missing Data. As an outgroup, the seven bacterial IRK-like proteins were chosen, including KirBAC1.1, of which the molecular structure was recently
determined by X-ray [32]. Those bacterial AA sequences were also referred from an NCBI microbial genome database. The

Phylogenetic tree derived from selected 20 IRK AA
Phylogenetic tree derived from selected 20 IRK AA
sequences. To show the major phylogenetic evolution of
IRK genes more visually, the 20 sequences were selected
from the 44 IRK data used for the previous Fig. 3, that is,
three Halocynthia roretzi IRKs, four Ciona IRKs, three
Caenorhabditis elegans IRKs, and three Caenorhabditis briggsae
IRKs. The seven bacterial IRK-like proteins were taken as the
outgroup, which was the same as in Fig. 3. The position of
KirBAC1.1 was underlined. Alignment, phylogenetic tree
building, and Bootstrap for the internal branch test were the
same as in Fig. 3. The gaps within nonpreserved regions were
carefully deleted manually by the BioEdit program. Then the
phylogenetic tree derived from the aligned data was made by
the Neighbor Joining Method in the Mega3 v3.1 program,
including 269 sites with pairwise deletion of Gap/Missing
Data. In Additional file 5, Excel data of intron insertion
in various IRK genomes, intron numbers, sizes, and locations for 123 IRK genes used for the analysis of the present
study were listed. The identification numbers in GenBank or
Ensembl for the genes and their locations in the chromosomes were also included. [see Additional file 5]

On the tree derived from the AA sequences, the GIRK subbranch was distantly located from the subbranch of ATPregulated IRKs. However, as illustrated in Table 1, the
genome structures of respective IRKs in the one subbranch
had their partners in the other subbranch, and each pair
was located very closely together on the same chromosome in an antitandem or a palindromic way. For example, the 5' terminals of Kcnj 1 or ROMK1 genomes of
human, mouse, rat, and chick were only 20 to 80 Kbp
apart from the 5' terminals of Kcnj5 or GIRK2 genomes of
respective species, and their 5' to 3' directions were just

opposite to each other (green characters enclosed by interrupted lines in Fig. 8). There were two other similarly
paired subbranches of Kcnj10 and Kcnj9 (orange characters) and of Kcnj15 and Kcnj6 (dark blue characters). The
separation distances on the respective chromosomes were
10 to 20 Kbp for the former pairs and 260 to 450 Kbp for
the latter. This type of pairing could be expected to apply
also to the remaining subbranches of Kcnj 3 and Kcnj13.
The genomes of the Kcnj 3 subbranch were all located on
the equivalent chromosomes, where HoxDs were located
in human, mouse, rat, and chick genomes, but only
human Kcnj13 gene was located on the same chromosome as that of HoxD, with a relatively large separation
distance from the human Kcnj3 genome.
These results suggested that both ancestors of GIRK and
ATP-regulated IRK genes were antitandemly or palindromically aligned duplicates of each other possibly on the
chromosome of ancestor chordates. After the event, two
round duplications of chromosome numbers in the
ancestor vertebrates [16] made approximately 4 times the
members of genes in each major branch in the vertebrate
clade, as suggested in the case of HOX genes [14]. As also
suggested in the case of HOX genes, there may be some
extra chromosome duplications in teleost fish or amphibians [17], because we could find some extra members of
the IRK genes of puffer fish, zebra fish, and Xenopus in the
respective subbranches. A recently reported Ciona
genomic database from Ensembl suggested that the Ciona
ATP-regulated
IRK
gene
(Protein,
ENSCINP00000010507; gene, ENSCING00000005094)
is located at Chromosome 4q-373, but there was no information yet on the location of the Ciona G-protein-activated IRK gene (JGI; ci0100138554). The functional
significance for the preservation of the proximity of paired
IRK genomes on the vertebrate chromosomes will be discussed later.
There was also evidence of genuine tandem duplication
within the branch of the elementary IRK gene group, as
shown in the paired Kcnj2 and Kcnj16 subbranches (Fig.
8; Table 1). In this case, the directions from the 5' terminal
to the 3' terminal were the same within respective pairs.
This tandem duplication in the mouse IRK genome was
noted previously [33], and this pairing was considered to
be of an origin different from the above antitandem pairings. No other evidence of pairing was found in the elementary IRK gene group, except that a possible weak
linkage between Kcnj12 and Kcnj2 subbranches was
found as listed chromosomal location in Additional file 5
[see Additional file 5].

Frequency histograms of intron numbers in all 108 IRK genes examined. Figure A, B, and C represent the histograms for three major groups of vertebrate IRKs, that is, ATP-regulated, elementary, and G-protein-activated IRK groups,
respectively. Anamniotic vertebrates mean fish and amphibians, and amniotic birds and mammals. Abscissa, Intron numbers.

melanogaster and Anofeles gambiae.

A uniquely conserved intron insertion site among the
vertebrate GIRK gene group and tunicate GIRK genes
As described above, intron insertions in the vertebrate IRK
coding regions are very few in comparison with those of
the tunicate IRKs. Thus the intron and exon structures of
the vertebrate IRK genes were quite different from those of
the tunicates, though the AA sequences are phylogenetically closely related to their tunicate orthologs, as shown
in the tree in Fig. 8. However, in the group of GIRK genes
there is only one uniquely conserved intron insertion site
among all vertebrate GIRKs and tunicate GIRKs in Fig. 9
and Fig. 10 [see Additional file 7]. As shown Fig. 11, this
site was between the first and second nucleotide in the glycine codon and was preserved exclusively in the group of
vertebrate and tunicate GIRKs. The site corresponded to
G307 residue in the mouse GIRK1 or Kcnj3 and was
located at the loop region near the hydrogen bonded turn

a304–306 and between two beta strands a294–303 and
a309. The site was suggested to be in the hinge region in
the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, which could be
important for open-close transition by G-protein beta and
gamma binding, and the residue seemed to be exposed to
the cytoplasmic surface, as inferred from the mouse
GIRK1 cytoplasmic crystal structure reported by Nishida
and MacKinnon[34]. It is also noted that two exclusively
conserved AA sequence regions in the C-terminal domain
of the GIRK were located in the upper stream and downstream within 75 and 25 AA residue distances, respectively, from this intron insertion site and. The former,
a234–237, were included in the beta-strand region a223–
237 and seemed to be located on the cytoplasmic surface(Fig. 12). The latter, L333, was previously suggested to
be the most effective activation site by G-protein beta and
gamma (Fig. 13) [35]. The above-described conserved

Alignment of 7 tunicate, 6 Caenorhabditis, and 7 bacterial IRK AA sequences. Alignments were performed by using
the Clustalx1.83 program. No gaps were deleted. Intron-intervening sites are illustrated by changes in colors of AA code characters. Red to black transition or vice versa represents phase 0 intron insertion (the case for the intron intervention between
two neighboring AA codes). Green and sky blue indicate phase 1 intron (intron insertion between first and second nucleotides of an AA code), and phase 2 intron (between second and third nucleotides in an AA code) insertions, respectively.
Characters with a yellow background and boxed indicate the conservation of intron sites between tunicate and Caenorhabditis. They were also noted by red rods in the lowest Clustal Consensus line. Purple background characters indicate either
edges of intrinsic gaps in the bacterial AA sequences corresponding to some intron insertion sites in the Caenorhabditis. Upper

three regions seemed to be all located on the probable Gprotein binding surface, making the solid triangle of
molecular flame for the binding surface. The conserved
intron insertion site, G307, seemed to be an especially
important hinge region by which the working angle could
be used to adapt to the global configuration of the binding surface.
Phylogenic analysis and comparison of genomic structures
of G-protein beta(GNB)s
Since the intron insertion site, which was supposed to be
in the G-protein beta binding region, was exclusively con-

served in the group of GIRK genes, we attempted to analyze the genomic structures of G-protein betas interacting
with these GIRKs. The data were all obtained from the
established genomic databases [see Additional file 8]. Figure 14 illustrates the phylogenetic tree derived from 54 Gprotein beta AA sequences and 7 bacterial WD-repeat protein AA sequences as the outgroup. Because this case was
different from the IRK sequences, two major groups of Gprotein beta very likely existed within the ancestor
sequences of both protostomic and deuterostomic clades,
that is, the first group of GNB1 to 4 and the second group
of GNB5. In the vertebrate clade after diversification from

17). However, fly and mosquito GNBs did not conserve
the intron insertion sites. The alignment of GNB5 protein
AA sequences illustrated similar results [see Additional file
9]. The physiological significance of intron insertion site
conservation will be discussed later.

In terms of intron-exon structures, the frequency histograms in Fig. 15 demonstrated that the 7 to 11 intron
insertions in the coding region were rather constant
among all vertebrate GNBs and Ciona GNBs. Two groups
of GNBs in Caenorhabditis revealed 8 and 7 intron insertions, similar to those in Ciona, respectively. However, the
GNBs in fly and mosquito revealed a much lower number
of intron insertions than Caenorhabditis did. An alignment
of GNB1 protein sequences illustrated not only strict
amino acid residue conservation, but also strict intron
insertion site preservation among human, mouse, rat,
fish, Ciona, and Caenorhabditis GNB1 proteins (Fig. 16 and

Discussion
Summary of results
We sequenced three Halocynthia IRK genomic genes and
determined their genomic structures. Furthermore, a total
of 131 IRK genomic genes were inferred from the established genomic databases. The phylogenic trees derived
from the known or inferred AA sequences revealed the
clear diversification of deuterostomic IRK from protostomic IRK, and the tunicate IRKs were possibly representatives of ancestor forms of three major groups of IRKs in
the vertebrate. However, the genomic structures, including intron-exon connections of the tunicate IRKs, showed

seven bacterial IRK genes. Except for Halocynthia data, AA sequences are inferred from the established genome data bases, JGI,
NCBI and GenBank, and Ensembl. Alignment was carried out by the ClustalX1.83 program. The gaps within nonpreserved
regions were carefully deleted manually by the BioEdit program. The phylogenetic tree derived from the aligned data was then
made by the Neighbor Joining Method in the Mega3 v3.1 program, using the Amino Poisson correction model with Gammadistributed Rates among sites (Gamma parameter 2.0) and Bootstrap as the test of inferred branches (Repetition 500), including 270 sites with a pairwise deletion of Gaps/Missing Data. The character of the same color indicates the proximity of the
chromosomal location of gene pairs between two subbranches. The closure by an interrupted line indicated that the chromosomal location between paired genes was very close in the order of 10 to 200 Kbp. The closure by dotted line indicates that
linkage is weak. The Hox name in the parentheses indicates the equivalence of the chromosomal locations among different taxa
by the presence of the specific Hox gene group. See also Additional file 5, chromosomal locations of genes. [see Additional file

Although the major groups of tunicate IRK proteins
included only one or two members, in the vertebrate clade
the members in one major group increased at least four
times. The generation of paralogues can be achieved by
various types of gene duplication, such as tandem and/or
chromosomal. However, the generation of the major
groups in the tunicates and vertebrates may be of more
ancient origin, and some of the mechanism may be
derived from the unique palindromic duplication. Finally
the strong conservation of intron insertion sites in the

introns, and exon shuffling introduced new functions into
the gene product proteins [23]. Provocative evidence for
the theory is provided by the high-frequency insertion of
introns between codon sequences, phase 0 intron, and the
conservation of intron insertion sites in the coding
regions of orthologous proteins from a phylogenetically
wide range of taxis [23]. However, because of massive
intron loss during the evolutionary process and the significant production of new intron insertion in the highly
evolved taxis, such as human and Drosophila, the ancient
intron insertion sites may be vastly lost in the genomes of
present-day organisms [9]. Those situations have facilitated several types of late intron theory or synthetic theory
of intron evolution [10-12].

Intron early theory
The significance of intron insertion has been considerably
notified by the claim of exon theory [8]. The exon theory
persisted that the ancestral eukaryotic genes are generated
from numerous short exons connected with ancient

In the present study, we purposefully limited observation
and discussion to within the gene group of definitely functionally defined proteins, that is, IRK channels. Results
indicated that both the tunicate IRK genes and the

intron insertion sites in the functionally important transmembrane and pore regions. Further, three insertion sites
were commonly conserved in terms of AA sequences
between the tunicates and the Caenorhabditis, indicating
that some of the cornerstones of early evolutional history
remained.
Although there is an intriguing hypothesis that the exon
corresponds to protein domains [23,36], the conserved
insertion sites seemed not always to exist at the borders of
domains. Instead, they were at the structurally critical
points, such as the membrane spanning region or inside
the pore regions in the present study. This point will be
further discussed below.
In both chordates and protostomal clades, when the
respective members increased within functionally differ-

ent major groups of IRK genes, the number of intron
insertions abruptly decreased. In the tunicates or the
Caenorhabditis, the members remained small in number
possibly because of the size constraint of whole genomes,
and the intron insertion sites were conserved. Our observation could suggest no points about intron insertions in
bacterial genes; however, we were inclined to consider
that the intron appearance is closely related to the early
appearance of eukaryotic organisms, because some residual gaps of IRK amino acid sequences were left in the
modern bacteria, roughly corresponding to the conserved
intron insertion sites of the ancestral eukaryotes reflected
in the Caenorhabditis or tunicate genomes. This suggested
that the intron insertion mechanism newly appeared at
least at the time of diversification between the eukaryotic
and prokaryotic ancestors, or that the introns in the
prokaryotic and eukaryotic common ancestor, the prog-

(B) does the lower part. a and a , and b and b' indicate the continuation of branches from the upper part to the lower. A total
of 54 AA sequences of eukaryotic G-protein beta and two beta-like AA sequences were analyzed [see Additional file 8]. The
outgroup was 7 bacterial WD-repeat protein AA sequences. Tunicate GNBs were underlined. AA sequences are inferred from
the established genome data bases, JGI, NCBI genomes, and Ensembl. Alignment was carried out by the ClustalX 1.83 program.
The gaps within nonpreserved regions were carefully deleted manually by the BioEdit program. The phylogenetic tree derived
from the aligned data was then made by the Neighbor Joining Method in the Mega3 v3.1 program, using the Amino Poisson
correction model with Gamma-distributed Rates among sites (Gamma parameter 2.0) and Bootstrap as the test of inferred
branches (Repetition 500), including 471 sites with a pairwise deletion of Gaps/Missing Data. Drosophila and Anopheles
Gbeta76C genes may be differently grouped from the vertebrate-type GNBs according to this phylogenetic tree. Those bacterial AA sequences of WD-repeat proteins were also referred from the NCBI microbial genome database. Abbreviations: GNB,

enote, genomes disappeared in the prokaryotes, as suggested previously [23]. This consideration supported the
exon theory in the evolution of the IRK gene family.
There remains the possibility that the common intron
insertion between tunicates and Caenorhabditis could be
derived from convergent evolution during later history
way after eukaryotic diversification from prokaryotes.
However, it was totally unclear what kinds of adaptive

merits produced by the multiple intron insertion commonly existed in their phylogenetically different ancestors, although convergent evolution of the AA sequences
might be derived from the functional similarity of IRK
proteins [37].

tion [15,16,19,38]. There are many examples of tandem
duplication, which could produce the paralogues of genes
[39]. It could be inferred that one of the duplicated pair
became free from the functional constraining and
acquired the new function or degenerated as nonfunctional by the accumulation of mutations. It is generally
understood that the duplication by random insertion
could be derived from the genomic insertion of reverse
transcript of the original gene by various transposon-like
mechanisms and that the exact duplication of gene regulatory sequence, such as promoters and enhancers, are
rather difficult. Thus block duplication or chromosomal
duplication of the concerned gene groups should be an
easier way to produce new functional paralogues. The
famous two-round duplication of the chromosome set
has been proposed by Ohno in the ancestor vertebrate

[13], and the theory has strong support by the existence of
four sets of tandemly aligned Hox gene groups in the
amniotic vertebrate genomes and the recent analysis on
the whole genome sequences derived from a wide-range
of vertebrate taxa including both anamniotes and amniotes [14-16]. The presence of extra sets of Hox gene groups
in fish has been explained by the extra duplication of
chromosomal sets in the teleosts[17].
In the present study, two major gene groups, ATP-regulated IRK and G-protein-activated IRK, of which gene
branches were placed quite distantly on the phylogenetic
tree derived from the IRK AA sequences, were found to be
physically correlated closely and franked anti-tandemly as
pairs on the individual chromosomes. This is so-called
palindromic duplication, which has recently attracted

much attention in the adaptive gene expansion of carcinoma stem cell or fungi, Saccharomyces, genomes [1820,38]. The unique palindromic duplication during evolutional time found in the present study would forcibly
make the gene pair share the gene regulatory regions.
Although the promoters may be separately placed, the
coincidental transcriptional activity should be difficult
between the gene pair. The expression must be mutually
exclusive. Actually, G-protein-activated IRKs are exclusively expressed in the neuronal cells of the nervous tissues and heart cells [40], and the paired ATP-regulated
IRKs are expressed in the epithelial cells and the glia of the
nervous tissue [41-45].
This rather unique type of palindromic duplication must
have been originated before the subbranching in respec-

tive major groups of genes, that is, at the time of the ancestors common to the tunicate and the vertebrates. Then the
parallel but independent functional evolution during
long archeological history could occur in the gene pairs
deriving, respectively, two major distinct gene groups as a
result of mutual and physical constraining in the gene regulatory regions. Therefore the palindromic duplication
was highly expected to exist also in the modern tunicate
genome. However, no evidence of this type duplication of
IRK genes has remained in the genome though the physical maps of the tunicate chromosomes have not yet been
completed as described in the Results section. In the
Ascidia, the tandem arrangement of Hox genes was dispersed, as previously reported [46,47]. Similarly, it was
possible that the evolutional evidence of the antitandem
or palindromic duplication of the IRK genes may disap-

pear because of the gene dispersion in the Ascidia during
the evolutionary time. As Ferrier and Holland [47] have
suggested, the dispersion of the Hox gene groups may be
deduced from the inference that the temporal colinearity
as well as constraint on the cluster organization might
have been removed from animals that undergo rapid
embryogenesis with a low cell number and predominantly mosaic development. However, it may also be
plausible that the dispersion in the genome itself could
lead the rapid embryogenesis with a low cell number and
predominantly mosaic development, resulting from the
removal of the spatial and temporal colinearity in the
genomic structure and regulation, without which the animals had to become adaptable.
Two rather marginal but important points could be discussed in relation to the palindromic duplication. First,
according to the constructed phylogenetic tree the G-protein-activated IRK gene may be diverged from the ATP-regulated IRK gene. After the palindromic duplication of
ancestoral ATP-regulated IRK genes, the G-protein binding segment on the duplicated genes could be forced to
evolve in parallel with G-protein beta and gamma genes.
On the other hand, the coupled evolution between G-protein-activated and ATP-regulated IRKs as a result of the
possible joint ownership of the gene regulatory regions
must be related to apparently independent but actually
interdependent functions of the epithelial system derived
from mesenchymal or endodermal sheet and the tubular
nervous system from ectodermal sheet in the common
ancestor of the tunicates and vertebrates. Ionic balance,
especially potassium, resulting from the IRK function in
the epithelial transport systems and neural excitable epithelium must have been important adaptive factors to

coordinate the regulations of K ion transport activities of
kidney and neurons in the freshwater or landed vertebrate
evolution to balance their effects on the internal milieu
and membrane excitability. For example, the high activity
of ROMK in the kidney, one of the members of ATP-regulated IRK, will produce low K+ concentration in the internal milieu, and, if occurring simultaneously, the high
activity of GIRKs in neurons or heart cells will be
extremely inhibitory for membrane excitability. In the
above respect, it was interesting that the seawater living
tunicates have a dispersed location between the ATP-regulated and G-protein activated IRK genes, where the ionic
internal milieu is balanced mainly by the seawater composition. In this discussion, it was important to notice
that the ATP-sensitive or SUR-coupled IRKs, such as Kcnj8
and Kcnj11, were evolutionally different from ATP-regulated IRKs, such as ROMK (see Fig. 5), and that ATP-sensitive IRK genes were not paired with G-protein-activated
IRK genes. Actually ATP-sensitive IRK did coexist with
GIRKs in the heart cells and neurons.
Second, by closely looking at the phylogenetic tree, we see
that the branching in the respective subbranches was not
exactly parallel between the two paired major IRK gene
branches, as shown in Fig. 8. The exchange of partners
resulting from one round of homologous recombination
between the two members of gene pairs within four members during the two-round chromosomal duplications
nicely explained the slight difference of the subbranching
pattern between two major branches of ATP-regulated and
G-protein-activated IRK groups.

Figure 18 phylogenetic trees for the IRK N terminal plus membrane-spanning region and for the IRK C terminal region
Two separate
Two separate phylogenetic trees for the IRK N terminal plus membrane-spanning region and for the IRK C
terminal region. This figure illustrates only the upper halves of the trees and the following figure 19 does the lower halves. a,
b, c and d , and m, n, o and p indicate the continuation of branches from the upper halves in this figure to the lower halves in
the following figure. Two sets of AA sequence alignments are obtained from two sets of AA sequences divided at the 3' terminal of respective M2 regions in a total of 7 (underlined) and 108 IRK AA sequences of tunicates and vertebrates, inferred from
the established genome databases, JGI, GenBank, and Ensembl, except Halocynthia data, the same data as in Fig. 5. In this figure
the 270 sites used in the tree of Fig. 5 were divided into 123 sites from the membrane and pore regions and into 147 sites from
the C-terminal region. This region was defined as from the 3' end of the M2 region to the end. Both trees for these two
regions were made by the Mega3 v3.1 program, as described in the legend of Fig. 5, that is, phylogenetic trees being constructed by the Neighbor-joining methods of Mega 3 v3.1 with the Bootstrap test (500 repetition) and with the Gamma distance model of alpha parameter 2.0. The outgroups were two sets of seven bacterial IRK genes similarly divided at the 3'
terminal of respective M2 regions. It was concluded that the C-terminal region of the G-protein-activated IRK group (a total
147 AA sites) revealed a rather slower evolutionary rate or lower mutational rate than that of the ATP-regulated IRK group,
except for the Kcnj1 subgroup, and the N-terminal and membrane-spanning region (123 AA sites) of the ATP-regulated IRKs
revealed slower evolutionary rates than the same region of the G-protein-activated IRK group.

Functional significance of intron insertion
Most introns in the IRK genomes disappeared in the vertebrate genomes after gene diversification. However,
unique intron insertion sites remained precisely conserved in respect to both AA code and intracodon insertion sites exclusively in the G-protein-activated IRK gene
group, including the tunicate ones. As AA sequences, the
conservation of the site was partially conceived in the
genes of other major groups. The site is the hinge region
that is important for the opening-closing of the IRK channel correlated with G-protein beta and gamma binding, as
described in the Results. The exclusively conserved Glycine, which was also the conserved intron insertion site,
composed the hinge region that must bend or rotate as the
pivotal role in adjusting against the G-protein beta and
gamma binding and accordingly to change the open or
closed state of channels. Thus the strongest evolutionary
conservative pressure must be applied to the hinge site.
Here it could be inferred that the conservation of intron
insertion with phase 1 but not phase 0 or 2, which has a
redundancy at the 5' or 3' side of introns, was probably
the most plausible mechanism to result in an all-or-none
or alternative mutation, that is, conservation or fetal. This
is because any addition, deletion, or point mutation in the
neighborhood of the insertion site would produce mostly
a disruption of intron insertions, or even in rare cases a
dysfunctional change in an amino acid residue, even if the
intron insertions were kept. Thus it could be easily imagined that both sides of the conserved phase 1 intron insertion site could be confronted by the high evolutional
conservative pressure or strict parallel evolution to be
adaptable for binding to the partner proteins.

In the above, it was interesting that our survey on the
genome structures of G-protein betas (GNBs), of which
GNB1 is especially the well-known partner of GIRKs and
also other many G-protein activated proteins [48-50],
revealed the extremely conserved intron insertion sites
from the tunicate genes to the human genes in the vertebrate clade. Among the GNB genes, the vertebrate evolution seemed to introduce the functional diversification of
only marginal activity by the member increase because of
whole genome duplication in the specialized groups on
the phylogenic tree. It was suggested instead that because
of the multi-interactive nature of the protein, the high
conservative pressure on the pivotal sites in their molecular structure made their intron insertion sites, including
AA codes, constant during the evolutional time. Actually,
the conserved sites of phase 1 intron insertion are placed
on the hinge regions between two beta sheets or helix
structures, as inferred from rat GNB1 crystal structures
reported [51,52]. Thus it could be inferred that the site
conservation of intron insertion, especially phase 1
intron, is one of the representatives of the genome structures constrained by the protein structures for the adapta-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/143

tion to the protein-protein interaction. On the other
hand, it has been well discussed that phase 0 or phase 2
introns have a significant role in exon shuffling or domain
exchange for protein structural evolution [23].
Structure and evolutionary rate
It has been hotly debated that protein structural constraints because of protein-protein interaction could
introduce a slow evolutionary rate in AA sequences of the
contacting regions of both proteins, because of the necessity of the preservation of functionally significant structures and of the parallel evolution between the paired
interacting regions [53-55]. This inference was also reasonably conceived in the C-terminal regions of the IRKs in
comparison with the N-terminal and membrane region of
the IRKs. As shown in Fig. 18 and 19, two separate phylogenetic trees for the IRK N terminal and membrane-spanning region and for the IRK C terminal region illustrate
that the C-terminal region of G-protein activated IRK
group revealed rather slower evolutionary rates or lower
mutational rates than those of ATP-regulated IRK group
except the Kcnj1 subgroup. The N-terminal and membrane-spanning regions of the ATP-regulated IRKs
revealed slower evolutionary rates than those of the GIRK.
This may be derived from the protein-protein or proteinligand interactions occurring in the intramolecularly different regions between the GIRKs and the ATP-regulated
IRKs. The exceptional Kcnj1 subgroup, which revealed a
slower rate in the C-terminal region, has been known to
have the ATP/PIP2-binding site in a 39-amino-acid region
of the C-terminal [56]. Thus it was suggested that the
structural constraints of the proteins limit the evolutionary rates of the particular protein regions. The conservation of intron-insertion sites at the functionally significant
regions described above could be one of the important
mechanisms to facilitate this general tendency.

Conclusion
In the present study, we attempted to analyze the genomic
structures of a group of proteins, which are functionally
well defined, and to compare them among a phylogenetically wide range from protostomal to deuterostomal
clades. We aimed to elucidate the functional significance
in evolutional changes in the genome structure, such as
intron insertion and gene duplication, and the interactive
relation between the expressed protein structure and the
genomic structural changes. The results follow. First, the
general inron-exon structures may be derived from the
early time of eukaryotic evolution, when the protein family revealed the first and elemental function with their
unique molecular structures. Second, the various types of
gene duplication could contribute to the gene diversification resulting in the functional evolution, but some constraints in the genomic structures because the unique
molecular mechanisms of the duplication, such as palin-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:143

dromic duplication, may produce the adaptive parallel or
coordinate evolution among the protein family members
between organs or tissues that were functioning differently. Third, the conserved intron insertion site, especially
in the case of phase 1 intron, could be correlated with
amino acid residues that were structurally pivotal roles in
the protein-protein interaction. Thus it was suggested that
the ancient intron insertion sites, which are intrinsically
related to the functionally key region of the proteins, in
the eukaryotic genome, or possibly in the prokaryotic and
eukaryotic common ancestor, and the unique palindromic genomic duplication in the genomes of vertebrate
clade shaped an elementally functioning membrane protein family during evolution.

Methods
Halocynthia roretzi (HR) IRK cDNA
The cDNAs, TuIRKA, TuGIRKAa, and TuGIRKB were gifts
from Dr. Y. Kubo in the Division of Biophysics and Neurobiology, Department of Molecular Physiology, National
Institute for Physiological Sciences, and were subcloned
into pBluescript II SK2 (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) in
accordance with the manufacturer's protocol and
sequenced [see Additional file 2].
Genomic library screening
A Halocynthia roretzi genomic library constructed in
λEMBL3/BamH I Vector (Stratagene) was a gift from Dr.
H. Okado of the Department of Molecular Physiology,
Function Research Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute
for Neurosciences. This library was screened using specific
EcoRI fragments of respective HR IRK cDNAs as probes.
Filters were prehybridized in a solution containing 50%
formamide, 53 SSC, 53 Denhardt's solution, and 0.1%
SDS for 1 h at 42°C, then hybridized overnight at 42°C in
the same solution containing Digoxigenin-labeled
probes. The DNA probes were random primed, labeled
with Digoxigenin-11-dUTP using DIG-High Prime, a 5 ×
concentrated labeling mixture of random hexamers, dNTP
mix containing alkali-labile Digoxigenin-11-dUTP, and
labeling grade Klenow enzyme, and optimized according
to the manufacturer's manual (Roche; DIG-High Prime
DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II). The filters
were washed twice in 23 SSC and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 20 min and once in 13 SSC and 0.1% SDS at
55°C for 2 h. They were then treated with chemiluminescence reaction buffer (Roche; DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II). Positive clones were
detected by exposing the luminescence to X-ray films contacted with the filters. The λEmble3 clones containing
these positive inserts were amplified and used for the
genomic sequencing. The obtained clones were 2 for the
TuIRKA gene, the TuIRKA11 clone, and the TuIRKA14
clone, 2 for the TuGIRKAa gene, the TuGIRKAa3 clone,
and the TuGIRKAa9 clone, and 1 for the TuGIRKB gene

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/143

and the TuGIRKB2 clone, showing the possible coverage
of all ORFs, 5' UTRs, and 3' UTRs with restriction maps
[see Additional file 3]. And later the coverage was all confirmed with the sequencing. These 5 clones corresponding
to respective cDNAs were digested with Xho I and Sal I,
and the digests were subcloned into pBluescript II SK2
using an Xho I or Sal I restriction site, respectively. For the
TuIRKA gene, the obtained subclones were 17 from the
first λEMBLE3 clone and the TuIRKA11 clone and 3 from
the second λEMBLE3 clone and the TuIRKA14 clone. For
the TuGIRKAa gene, 7 subclones from the TuGIRKAa3
clone and 3 from the TuGIRKAa9 clone were obtained.
For TuGIRKB, the subclone was recloned into pBluescript
II SK2 from the TuGIRKB2 clone itself. All subclones were
sequenced with appropriate primer combinations at least
in both directions, and in some cases a third sequencing
was carried out. In the case of the TuGIRKA gene, PCR
clonings of the two gap regions between subclones were
performed on the original λEMBLE3 clones, using part of
the decided flanking sequences as primers, and also subcloned into pBluescript II SK2 and sequenced. All suspected boundaries between the neighboring subclones
were subjected to perform PCR on the original λEMBLE3
clones, using appropriate primers for the tagged sequence
derived from the sequenced regions placed at both ends of
the boundaries. And the continuation beyond the boundaries of subcloned fragments were all confirmed.
DNA sequencing
DNA was sequenced by the Dye Terminator method,
using an automated laser fluorescent DNA sequencer (ABI
PRISM model 3100, Applied Biosystems, Foster city CA,
USA) and a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster city CA, USA). DNA
sequences were analyzed by using the computer program
DNASIS3.2-MAC (Hitachi Software, Tokyo, Japan). Exonintron boundaries were identified by comparing the
genomic and cDNA sequences. All obtained genomic and
cDNA sequences necessary for the present experimental
conclusions are listed in Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4 [see
Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4].
Retrieving sequences from the C. intestinalis genome and
a cDNA/EST database
The C. intestinalis IRK channel protein sequences were
tBLASTn searched against the draft or completed genome
sequence (Ref.: [4], and Ensembl and DOE Joint Genome
Institute [JGI] Ciona intestinalis v2.0 [JGI site for the complete C. intestinalis genome sequence and gene annotations]: [57]) and a cDNA/EST database (Ref.: [7], and
Ghost Database: [58]) using human and HR IRK channel
protein AA sequences [29,30]. IRK channel proteins were
identified by using the following basic method. Briefly,
when the corresponding cDNA sequence covering the
diagnostic sequences for an IRK channel molecule, such as

a channel pore region and two franking transmembrane
regions, and available by InterPro search [59], the
deduced protein sequence was used for the analyses.
When the cDNA sequence was not available and grail EXP
or genewise confidently predicted the gene encompassing
the entire channel region, the peptide sequence deduced
from the gene model was used. When the predicted gene
model was not perfect, but the ESTs covered either the
entire region or the region lacking the gene model, the
peptide sequence was deduced from the assembled
sequence obtained by using either a set of ESTs (5' and 3'
EST pair), multiple sets of ESTs, or both an EST and the
gene model. After the protein AA sequence was identified,
the respective genomic sequences were retrieved from
databases. All analyzed Ciona IRK genomic genes and
other genes are listed in Additional file 5 [see Additional
file 5].

the analyses shown in Figs. 3, 4, 8, 18 and 19 when the NJ
trees were constructed, branch points were considered significant only when the bootstrap tests gave a significant
value >50%. The sequences used are designated in succession by the abbreviation of the species and the gene name.
Abbreviations of the species are as follows: HR for Halocynthia roretzi, CI for Ciona intestinalis, HS for human, MM
for M. musculus, RN for Rattus norvegicus, GG for Gallus gallus, DR for Danio rerio, FR for Takifugu rubripes, XT for
Xenopus tropicalis, DM for D. melanogaster, AG for Anopheles gambiae, CE for C. elegans, and CB for C. briggsae. After
the protein AA sequences were identified and the trees
obtained, all respective genomic sequences were retrieved
from the databases. And the inferred sites of exon intron
junctions and the length of respective introns were used
for a comparison of genomic structures among the organisms examined.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis
The identified or predicted IRK channel protein sequences
from human (database version: NCBI Build 36.2), mouse
(database version: NCBI Build 36.1), Takifugu rubripes
(database version: IMCB/JGI FUGU 4.0), zebra fish
(Danio rerio, database version: Ensembl Zv 6), rat (Rattus
norvegicus, database version: RGSC v3.4), chicken (Gallus
gallus, database version: WASHUC 1), and frog (Xenopus
tropicalis, database version: JGI 4.1) were retrieved from
NCBI Genomes [60] and/or Ensembl [61]. Diagnostic
sequences for each retrieved IRK channel molecule, such
as a channel pore region and two franking transmembrane regions, were identified by InterPro search [59]. To
delineate vertebrate gene families, a similarity search was
performed (tBLASTn, [62]; E-value cutoff E-10) with all
IRK channel proteins from the organisms listed in Additional file 5 [see Additional file 5], that is, the proteins of
HR and Ciona intestinalis (database version JGI2.0), Drosophila melanogaster (database version BDGP 4),
Caenorhabditis elegans (database version WS 150), Anopheles gambiae (database version AgamP3), and seven
prokaryotic IRK channel proteins that were added as the
outgroup species (NCBI Genomes Prokaryotic Projects).
The prokaryotic sequence was used to root the phylogenetic tree. Redundancy between the families was removed.
The sequences were aligned by using the ClustalX 1.83
program [63,64]. Alignments in nonconserved regions of
channel proteins were carefully checked by eye, and
regions with ambiguous alignments, in particular at the
less-conserved cytoplasmic region and extracellular
region, were eliminated. Thus verified alignments were
used to construct phylogenetic trees. Neighboring joining
trees (with 500 bootstrap replicates) were constructed
using MEGA3 [65,66] by using a substitution model of
Amino: Poisson correction with Gamma Distributed
Rates among sites (Gamma Parameter 2.0) and including
sites with a pairwise deletion of Gaps/Missing data. For

Relative dating of duplication events
The presence of various palindromic gene duplication
events was systematically analyzed on the Phylogenetic
trees with standard distance metrics obtained above.
Duplication events were evaluated by relative dating and
thus were based on the relative position of the duplicated
genes compared to speciation events in the phylogenetic
tree.
Retrieving G-protein beta (GNB) AA sequences and their
genome structures from the genome databases
A total of 54 AA sequences of eukaryotic G-protein beta
and two beta-like AA sequences were inferred from
genome databases, NCBI genome projects, and Ensembl.
To delineate GNB gene families, a similarity search was
performed by using human G-protein beta1 and beta5 AA
sequences (tBLASTn, [62]; E-value cutoff E-10), and all
GNB AA sequences retrieved from both protostomal and
deuterostomal clades were listed in Additional file 8 [see
Additional file 8]. Moreover, seven bacterial WD-repeat
protein AA sequences were retrieved from the NCBI
prokaryotic genome data projects and were used as the
outgroup for the construction of GNB trees. After the Gprotein beta AA sequences were identified and the trees
obtained, all respective genomic sequences were also
retrieved from the databases. And the exon intron junctions, length of introns, and numbers of intron insertions
within coding regions were inferred, as listed in Additional file 8 [see Additional file 8]. Tunicate GNB data
were obtained from the JGI database, Ciona intestinalis
v2.0. Alignment was carried out by the ClustalX 1.83 program [see Additional file 9]. The phylogenetic tree derived
from the aligned data was made by the Neighbor Joining
Method in the Mega3 v3.1 program, using the Amino
Poisson correction model with Gamma-distributed rates
among sites.
