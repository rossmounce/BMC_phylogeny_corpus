Abstract
Background: A genealogy based on gene sequences within a species plays an essential role in the
estimation of the character, structure, and evolutionary history of that species. Because intraspecific
sequences are more closely related than interspecific ones, detailed information on the evolutionary
process may be available by determining all the node sequences of trees and provide insight into functional
constraints and adaptations. However, strong evolutionary correlations on a few lineages make this
determination difficult as a whole, and the maximum parsimony (MP) method frequently allows a number
of topologies with a same total branching length.
Results: Kitazoe et al. developed multidimensional vector-space representation of phylogeny. It converts
additivity of evolutionary distances to orthogonality among the vectors expressing branches, and provides
a unified index to measure deviations from the orthogoality. In this paper, this index is used to detect and
exclude sequences with large deviations from orthogonality, and then selects a maximum subset ("core
set") of sequences for which MP generates a single solution. Once the core set tree is formed whose all
the node sequences are given, the excluded sequences are found to have basically two phylogenetic
positions on this tree, respectively. Fortunately, since multiple substitutions are rare in intra-species
sequences, the variance of nucleotide transitions is confined to a small range. By applying the core set
approach to 38 partial env sequences of HIV-1 in a single patient and also 198 mitochondrial COI and COII
DNA sequences of Anopheles dirus, we demonstrate how consistently this approach constructs the tree.
Conclusion: In the HIV dataset, we confirmed that the obtained core set tree is the unique maximum set
for which MP proposes a single tree. In the mosquito data set, the fluctuation of nucleotide transitions
caused by the sequences excluded from the core set was very small. We reproduced this core-set tree by
simulation based on random process, and applied our approach to many sets of the obtained endpoint
sequences. Consequently, the ninety percent of the endpoint sequences was identified as the core sets and
the obtained node sequences were perfectly identical to the true ones.

Background
Molecular phylogeny at the intraspecific level has proven
to be very useful for a variety of studies, such as estimating
the genealogical relationships among genes, determining
the common ancestor of a group of organisms, evaluating
the development of drug resistance in infectious diseases,
detecting positive selection for immune escape, and predicting future trends of diseases [1-7]. The sequences
within a species are similar each other compared with
those from different species. Therefore, it is generally
expected that the pairwise difference is a good approximation to the evolutionary distance, and the estimated phylogeny by existing methods (maximum parsimony (MP)
[8,9], statistical parsimony (SP) [13-17] and maximum
likelihood (ML) [11,12]) is reliable and has little uncertainty. However, there appear sometimes abnormal phenomena in which MP picks up a prohibitive number of
equally parsimonious trees [13]. Such phenomena suggest the presence of strong evolutionary correlations
among different lineages. Then, a nested analysis
approach [18-24] makes a complicated network mapping
in a nested analysis and makes it impossible to trace the
evolutionary history. In this situation, when the approximation of the pairwise difference is well satisfied as a
whole, we can expect that the above abnormal phenomena are caused by a small number of sequences in a given
dataset.
Recently, Kitazoe et al. [25,26] proposed multidimensional vector-space (MVS) representation in which the
estimated pairwise distances can be reproduced by using
Pythagorean theorem. When a distance matrix is compatible with a tree structure, sequences are expressed by the
composites of branch vectors that are orthogonal among
others. Therefore, MVS representation enables to measure
the deviation from the tree structure which subsists in the
initial pairwise differences. In this paper, this measured
deviation serves as a unified index in the core set approach
developed below.
We principally select a maximum subset ("core set") of
sequences for which MP generates a single solution, by
excluding sequences with large values of the deviation
index, and we can uniquely determine all the node
sequences of the core set tree. Here, we assume that this
core set tree is robust and preserved by insertion of the
excluded sequences. This assumption seems to be reasonable when the number of the excluded sequences is small.
The core set approach makes the reason of the exclusion
clear, and therefore makes it possible to estimate the
nucleotide transitions within a small range of uncertainty.
Indeed, we found through applications that the excluded
sequences without recombination have two phylogenetic
positions, respectively. A more detailed procedure of the
core set approach is documented in the followings:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/41

We first select a maximum number ("primary core (Pcore) set") of sequences (the procedure (a) in Methods)
whose distance sub-matrix gives no deviation from additivity of evolutionary distances. Existing methods (MP, SP,
ML and NJ) produce the same single tree as the P-core set
tree. Second, the excluded sequences are added on the Pcore set (the procedure (b) in Methods). This insertion
provides a maximum set ("secondary core (S-core) set") of
sequences for which MP produces a single tree, and the Score set comprises a global mainframe of the final tree
structure. However, long branching attractions may sometimes prevent a further restore of the excluded sequences
into the S-core set. In such a case, we divide the S-core set
into several subgroups and the two procedures of exclusion and insertion are repeated in the subgroups on the
additional condition of preserving the S-core set tree structure.
We apply the core set method to partial env sequences of
HIV-1 (C2-V5), to demonstrate how our approach realizes
reasonable tree building. We next employ the method for
a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial sequences of
Anopheles dirus, which characterize a simultaneous radiation pattern. Then, we perform simulation studies and
confirm that our core-set is mostly a large proportion of
the original dataset and that the inferred tree for the S-core
set is consistent with the true tree of the whole sequences.

Results
1) HIV phylogeny inference by constructing only a S-core
set tree
We applied our method to partial env sequences of HIV-1
(C2-V5) that were obtained in a longitudinal study [27] of
many patients. We analyzed a subgroup of 38 nucleotide
sequences from the patient-1, which comprise an obvious
monophyletic tree and are separated from the other subgroups in MP consensus tree. Hence, there unlikely exist
substitutions which make phylogenetic inference much
difficult and this data set provided a good example to
demonstrate the validity of our method (these sequences
and their accession numbers are listed in Additional file 1
1). We first selected a P-core set of sequences, which made
the total deviation index W (Eq. (3) in Methods) equal to
zero by performing the procedure (a) in Methods. The
sequence number 1–21 in Fig. 1b stands for this P-core set
member. Here, standard methods such as NJ, MP and SP
provided the same tree, because there were no multiple
substitutions in the P-core set. We next tried to incorporate the excluded 17 sequences sequentially into the Pcore set by performing the procedure (b) in Methods. As a
result, the sequence number 22–27 were further deposited
on the P-core set tree, and a S-core set tree of the total 27
sequences was obtained (Fig. 1b). Here, the S-core set produced the set of maximum number of sequences for
which MP provides a single tree. Indeed, we confirmed

our S-core set which has a single MP tree by examining all
possible combinations between 27 (and more) sequences
and the remaining sequences. The number of sequences
in the other subsets was always less than 27. We further
performed the procedure (c) that decomposes the S-core
set into subgroups. However, we found that there was no
more sequence which could be added by the criterion of
procedure (c). In this way, our final tree was constructed
by only once performing the two procedures (a) and (b)
in Methods. We here note by investigating all possible
combinations of two groups that the P-core set of 21
sequences is a maximum number set that satisfies the
additivity but the second P-core set is given by replacing
the 16th sequence by the 22th sequence. With starting this
second set, however, the original S-core set of 27
sequences did not change.
As an extension of our core-set approach, we could add
further seven sequences on the S-core set (sequences 28–
34, designated # marks (Fig. 2b)), which could be given
unique phylogenetic positions on the condition of preserving this tree by the criterion of procedure (b). Consequently, the T-core set was constructed (procedure (b) in
Methods). Here, MP method provided multiple solutions
of phylogeny (300 tree patterns with MP software package
PAUP* [9]) (Fig. 1). A further inclusion of sequences 35–
38 with larger deviations (denoted *) generated an explosion of topologies (14529 tree patterns) with PAUP*.
Some of these patterns disrupted even the core set tree
(Fig. 2c). SP tree (TCS version 1.13 software package) [28]
inferred from the S-core set (1–27) separated two
sequences (19 and 27) from the core set, and the inclusion
of all sequences disrupted the S-core set tree (Fig. 2d). One
way to address these topological uncertainties of MP and
SP is to first fix the topology using ML, and then to determine the node sequences using MP [29]. However, ML +
PAUP* also disrupted the core set (Additional file 2). The
topology and node sequences were calculated with ML,
software package PHYLIP (ML) [12] and PAUP*, respectively.

2) Mosquito phylogeny inference by constructing local

The core set approach was applied to a data set of mitochondrial COI and COII DNA sequences of Anopheles
dirus species A and D of Southeast Asia [30,31]. NJ tree of
which the outgroup was the 29th haplotype was highly
distorted and many of branching lengths on the tree represented smaller numbers of single substitutions (Fig. 3).
Such abnormal phenomena were due to strongly evolutionary correlations among many different branches.

We first constructed a global core set (S-core set) consisting of 71 haplotypes by using the procedures (a) and (b)
in Methods (the black lines of Fig. 4a). The tree structure

Core set tree of A. dirus mosquitoes and evolutionary simulation of this tree. (a) The black lines represent branches
for the global core set (71 haplotypes), which satisfies the orthogonality perfectly. The global core set was decomposed into
nine groups (the vertical bold lines). Here, each group had the 29th haplotype in common. The blue lines denote the 35 haplotypes of the local P-core set, while the red lines show the 58 haplotypes of the local S-core set. The remaining 34 haplotypes
were excluded because of the shared-site uncertainty explained in Fig. 7. (b) We simulated a Markov process of sequence evolution, which resulted in the same phylogenetic tree as the core-set tree (a). Application of the core set approach to a set of
the terminal sequences retained 154 sequences of the whole 164 sequences as the global core-set member without requiring
any local core-set trees. The obtained node sequences were perfectly identical to the true ones. The global core set produced
a unique MP tree. The inclusion of the remaining 10 sequences allowed MP to propose a number of topologies (804).

of this core set represents a simultaneous radiation (starlike) pattern centered on the 29th haplotype. We next
decomposed the global core set into subgroups by using
the procedure (c) in Methods. The subgroups obtained by
this procedure are shown by the vertical bold lines of Fig.
4a. Here, the 29th haplotype was included in all groups as
their common ancestor. The procedure (a) was then
applied to the individual subgroups, and the total 35 haplotypes were added in the seven subgroups (the blue lines
of Fig. 4a). Fifty-eight of the remaining 92 haplotypes
were inserted into each of the obtained local P-core sets by
using the procedure (b) (the red lines of Fig. 4a). The second, third, and fourth columns of Table 1 give the haplotype numbers corresponding to the global core set, the
local P-core sets, and the local S-core sets in each group,
respectively. As a result, our final tree consists of 164 haplotypes (Fig. 4a). This tree has a finely resolved structure
with definite number of substitutions on each branch, in
contrast to NJ tree (Fig. 3). The asterisks denote the haplotypes of A. dirus D, whereas those of A. dirus A are
unmarked. Haplotypes of A. dirus species A and D are
intermingled across the tree. This can be interpreted as
resulting from the introgression of mtDNA between the
two A. dirus species. Details of the biological interpretations will be reported by O'Loughlin et al. [30].
Since we could definitely determine the node sequences
in the final tree (Fig. 4a), we estimated the frequencies of

nucleotide substitutions. We counted all the nucleotide
substitutions from the 29th haplotype (radiation centre)
toward the endpoints. Of the 1537 sites, 176 sites showed
nucleotide substitutions (Table 2). Of these, 55 sites had
undergone multiple substitutions within the genealogy of
the final tree. On the other hand, thirty-one sites had
undergone non-synonymous changes, among which only
five sites had experienced multiple substitutions. The
multiplicity of the 176 variable sites averaged out to 1.8
because there were 312 substitutions in total. However
the multiplicity was not distributed homogeneously
among the variable sites. The largest number of multiple
substitutions at one site which we observed was 15 (Table
2). Of these 312 substitutions, 269 were transitions and
43 were transversions (Table 3a). Non-synonymous
changes comprised 10% of the total, and T→C and A→G
transitions predominated. This feature became more
obvious at small multiplicities with n < 4 (Table 3b). We
finally estimated the number of nucleotide transitions by
incorporating the 19 sequences excluded from the core set
(Table 4a). Although these sequences have two phylogenetic positions, respectively, the collection of all possible
patterns provided a small fluctuation in each transition
matrix, as seen in this Table.
3) Efficacy of the core set approach by evolutionary
simulation of random process
To examine the efficacy of the core set approach, we simulated a Markov process of sequence evolution, which
resulted in the same phylogenetic tree as the core-set tree
derived from the 164 mitochondrial COI and COII DNA
sequences of Anopheles dirus (Fig. 4a). Here, the root
sequences were randomly generated according to the
nucleotide frequency distribution of the 29th haplotype in
Fig. 4a. Each nucleotide substitution was randomly generated according to the weight given in Table 3a. Since nonsynonymous substitutions were rare in the above analysis,
we only changed the third codon positions. Although the
site heterogeneity of the evolutionary rate was neglected

This shows that T→ C and A→ G transitions predominated (Table
3a), especially in the case of small numbers (n < 4) of multiple
substitutions (Table 3b).

for simplicity, there is more chance of multiple substitutions because we kept the branch lengths. Application of
the core set approach to 10 sets of the terminal sequences
retained 90 % of the whole sequences as the global S-core
set member and did not require any local core-set trees
because of random process without strong evolutionary
correlations (long-branch attractions). The global S-core
set produced a unique MP tree which is consistent with

the simulated tree. Furthermore, the estimated sequences
at the internal nodes of the S-core set were perfectly identical to the true ones. Figure 4b illustrates the global S-core
set tree in one event (the endpoint sequences of this event
are listed in Additional file 3). The inclusion of the
remaining 10 % sequences allowed MP to provide a
number of topologies around 800. This implies that the
only sequences with phylogenetic uncertainty were
excluded by the core set approach.

Discussion
The core set approach first determines a set of the
sequences (P-core) that form the tree structure without
multiple substitutions by using only the total deviation
index. The approach next tries to sequentially insert the
excluded sequences into the P-core set tree, according to
the min-max criterion. If these sequences have the unique
phylogenetic positions on the P-core set, they are incorporated into the P-core set as the S-core set. The min-max criterion is useful for determining order of the insertion. In
fact, in the present demonstration of the HIV sequences
(Fig. 1), the S-core set was formed without any missing by
just stopping the insertion when MP gives multiple solutions. In this way, the core-set approach takes into explicit
account of the tree-building process to construct a consistent and robust tree.
A systematic analysis of the mosquito mitochondrial DNA
data set also showed that the maximum parsimony criterion was insufficient to produce a single tree structure. To
demonstrate this lucidly, we consider only two groups, 3
and 5 in Fig. 4a, which consist of nine and 17 haplotypes
including the 29th haplotype, respectively. The 25 haplo-

Figure 5
Core set tree compared to MP tree
Core set tree compared to MP tree. We considered the 25 haplotypes of groups 3 and 5 in Fig. 4a. PAUP* yielded 15 different branch patterns on the maximum parsimony criterion. One of them gave the same result as the core set approach (Fig.
5a), while another of them gave a very different pattern from our result (Fig. 5b). The bold lines indicated by block letters in
Fig. 5a denote parallel changes of four pairs.

types of the two groups were analysed by using PAUP*.
The analysis generated 15 different branch patterns, five of
which were consistent with the branch pattern of the global core set. Only one of these five trees corresponded to
our result (Fig. 5a). The other trees showed very different
branch patterns from ours, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Using
our approach, we first selected the global core set of seven
sequences (black lines), then the local P-core set of 10
sequences (blue lines), and then eight sequences (red
lines) with the local S-core set. The fifteen topologies generated by PAUP* were the result of parallel changes
between four sites and four branching pairs in the two
groups (see the bold lines of Fig. 5a). The application of

PAUP* to all 164 haplotypes of Fig. 4a generated more
than 100,000 topologies. In this way, the core set
approach makes neighbor-joining trees robust by avoiding evolutionary correlations with other groups.
By contrast, SP reduced the topological uncertainty of
PAUP* to a large extent. On the other hand, the network
representation made it difficult to follow the evolutionary
process strictly. Complicated network mapping was demonstrated by applying TCS to the 26 haplotypes of groups
2 and 3 in Fig. 4a (Fig. 6b). The reticulated pattern can be
explained by parallel changes (six pairs and one triplet of
branches, shown with bold lines in Fig. 6a) mainly

our result (Fig. 6a), which was also uniquely reproduced by PAUP*. The occurrence of loops could be explained by parallel
changes. The bold lines in Fig. 6a denote parallel changes of six pairs and one triplet.

Figure 8
Typical example of two phylogenetic positions in mosquitoes
Typical example of two phylogenetic positions in mosquitoes. Example of alternative phylogenetic positions caused by
the shared-site uncertainty illustrated in Fig. 7a. It remains ambiguous whether the 15th haplotype should be branched from the
7th haplotype (node) in group 2 or from the 72nd haplotype (node) in group 5. This uncertainty was a major influence on the
phylogeny, because the 72nd haplotype became the ancestor of the 250th, 271st, 127th, 221st, 36th, 97th, and 197th haplotypes. Here, the last three haplotypes yielded an additional uncertainty of their locations. Here, An→C denotes a substitution

between the two groups. In Fig. 6b, removal of the
branches marked with asterisks and changing the dotted
line to a solid one produces our result (Fig. 6a). Note that
PAUP* reproduced the same unique solution as ours.
Applying the TCS to all the haplotypes of Fig. 4a generated
a much more complicated reticulated genealogy. We
applied ML + PAUP* to the 164 haplotypes in Fig. 4a. The
result obtained was rather different from that of the core
set approach. We demonstrate a typical example of these
differences using the two sub-groups 7–1 and 7–2 in Fig.
4a (Additional file 4).
Of the 198 haplotypes, 34 had alternative phylogenetic
positions, as discussed in Methods. Thirty-three haplotypes gave the one-site sharing pattern of Fig. 7a, and one
haplotype gave the two-site sharing pattern of Fig. 7c. Figure 8 illustrates a typical example of uncertainty whether

the 15th haplotype should be inserted into the 7th haplotype (node) in group 2 or into the 72nd haplotype (node)
in group 5. This uncertainty exerts a strong influence on
the phylogeny, because the 15th haplotype becomes the
ancestor of the 250th, 271st, 127th, 221st, 36th, 97th, and
197th haplotypes, and the last three of these haplotypes
confer a further ambiguity because the 97th haplotype
produces the one-site sharing pattern.
The present core set approach implicitly assumes the condition that the global core set includes a majority of
sequences and constructs a main frame of tree structure.
When we cannot assume this condition, we decompose
the total sequences into some groups, by using the criterion of the 100 % branching resolution in MP consensus
tree. Then, the present core set approach is applied to each
group. The phylogeny among the groups is determined so

Page 12 of 17

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:41

that the branching lengths to connect them may be minimized. Details of this subject will be discussed elsewhere.

Conclusion
The global core-set member was first selected from the
complete set of sequences by the procedures (a) and (b)
in Methods, and comprised the mainframe for the further
tree-building construction. The local core-set trees were
second constructed by preserving this mainframe. Only
the sequences with alternative phylogenetic positions
finally remained out of the tree. The core-set approach is
assigned so that MP provides single trees for the global
core-set and for each of local core-sets. Hence, MP allows
multiple solutions for our final set of sequences given by
combining the local core-sets. This approach provides a
definite and unique tree structure without relying upon
probabilistic models of sequence evolution, by excluding
the sequences casusing phylogenetic uncertainty. Such a
set of well-defined evolutionary pathways will provide
increased power in making inferences of demographic
history, and be useful in clarifying the precise mechanisms of molecular evolution. One of our next tasks is to
detect definitely the sequences associated with recombination [32,33], by systematically analysing data sets of
many HIV-1 patients [27].

Methods
General idea of the core set approach
There is generally considerable uncertainty in the inference of a phylogenetic tree. However, in the study of
molecular evolution within a population, it may be possible to make more precise inferences because the intraspecific variability of sequences is much less than the
interspecific ones. Unfortunately, the existing procedures
of phylogenetic inference do not fully incorporate this feature.

In our core set approach, we collect a large subset of
sequences from a population, for which a reliable phylogenetic tree can be uniquely estimated. We take the infinite allele model, which neglects multiple substitutions at
a nucleotide site, as a first approximation to the molecular
evolution within a population. Therefore, we start by finding a subset for which the matrix of pairwise differences
(numbers of different sites) is compatible with some
unknown tree. This compatibility is measured by the
index of deviation from the orthogonality, which we
developed via MVS representation of sequences [26]. It is
possible to calculate the deviation without constructing a
tree. We sequentially exclude sequences that contribute
greatly to the deviation until the deviation reaches the
value of zero. This procedure provides a maximum set of
sequences for a unique tree without multiple substitutions, which is easily estimated by any methods of phylogenetic inference. The second procedure sequentially

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/41

inserts the excluded sequences into the obtained core-set
tree until MP gives multiple trees, to obtain a global core
set. The above-mentioned two procedures are repeated in
subsets of the global set to obtain a further inclusion of
the excluded sequences by removing long branching correlations.
MVS representation of phylogeny and index of deviation
from additivity
The orthogonal feature of the spatial branch vectors in
MVS is essential for resolving the tree structure. Because
MVS cannot be directly visualized, we use the spatial vectors of some sequences as probes ("search vectors") and
investigate how other sequences are branched around the
probes. A sequence o is selected as one of the probes and
placed at the coordinate origin of MVS, from which the
spatial positions, Ro, i, of other sequences i are measured.
The inner product, Si, j(o), of two vectors, Ro, i and Ro, j,
gives the branch length from the origin o to the most
recent common ancestor c of sequences i and j, if the
branch vectors are orthogonal (Fig. 9a). This is proved by
the relation Si, j(o) = Ro, i·Ro, j = (Ro, c + Rc, i)·(Ro, c + Rc, j) =
Ro, c2 = Do, c, sinceRo, c⊥Rc, j, Ro, c⊥Rc, i,and Rc, i⊥Rc, j. Here,
Di, jis the pairwise difference between the two sequences i
and j and is define das equal to Ri, j2. The branch length
can be rewritten as Si, j(o) = Ro, iRo, j cos(θi, j), with the angle
θi, j between the vectors Ro, i and Ro, j. Using the cosine theorem (Ri, j2 = Ro, i2 + Ro, j2-2Ro, i Ro, jcos(θi, j)) about the triangle (o, i, j) gives the equation,

Si, j(o) = (Do, i + Do, j - Di, j)/2.

(1)

MVS representation of a tree is expressed using two other
probes, a and b. We make a scatter diagram in terms of Si,
a(o) and Si, b(o), which are taken to be the x and y values,
respectively. Figure 9 illustrates the relationship between
the standard tree expression (Fig. 9b) and the corresponding MVS representation (Fig. 9c). In Fig. 9c, o = 1, a = 11,
and b = 14 were taken as a triplet of probes. Here, all
sequences (solid circles) lie on the three lines A, B, and C
(hereafter called the "orthogonal lines"), and fulfil the following equations for orthogonality: S11,8(1) = S11,9(1) =
S14,8(1) = S14,9(1) = D1,2; S11,10(1) = S14,10(1) = D1,3; and
S11,13(1) = S11,14(1) = S14,12(1) = D1,4. Endpoints (8–10),
12 and 13 are arrayed along the orthogonal lines in the
order of branching from the probes, because their branch
vectors are orthogonal to the probe vectors R1,11 and R1,14.
Points (8–10) outside the common ancestor 4 of the
probes 11 and 14 lie on the diagonal line A. Point 12, closest to probe 11, is located on line B, and point 13, closest
to probe 14, is located on line C. Points 8 and 9 have been
degenerated into the position of node 2. The degeneracy
can be resolved using other triplets of probes. In this way,
the tree structure is analysed using a variety of triplets.

The deviation of a sequence i is defined as the distance
from the position of this sequence to the nearest orthogonal line in each triplet (o, a, b). Because Sa, b(o) gives the y
value of the line B and the x value of line C in Fig. 9c, the
deviation of i is expressed as follows:
Vo, a, b, i = | Sb, i(o) - Sa, i(o) | + E (Sa, i(o)), if Sa, i(o) < Sa, b(o)
and Sb, i(o) < Sa, b(o)
= | Sb, i(o) - Sa, b(o) | + E (Sa, i(o)), if Sa, i(o) > Sa, b(o) and
Sa, i(o) > Sb, i(o)
= | Sa, i(o) - Sa, b(o) | + E (Sb, i(o)), if Sb, i(o) > Sa, b(o) and
Sb, i(o) > Sa, i(o). (2)

For a practical inference of the phylogeny, the pairwise
distances must be estimated initially. Because the core set
approach focuses on describing the evolutionary process
within a species, the initial distances can be approximated
well by the pairwise differences. Any multiple substitutions that have occurred on the evolutionary pathway
between the two sequences cause an underestimate of the
corresponding pairwise difference, which violates orthogonality. For example, when we consider parallel changes
between the two branches (3)–(10) and (7)–(11), MVS
representation expresses these changes as a deviation of
endpoint 10 from the diagonal line A, as shown by the triangle in Fig. 9c.

the triplet of probes o = 1, a = 11, and b = 14 were used.
The endpoints (8, 9), 10, 12, and 13 are degenerated into the
positions of the nodes 2,3,7, and 5, respectively. When the
pairwise differences satisfy orthogonality, the scatter plots
are placed on the orthogonal lines A, B and C. Convergent
evolution between the two branches (3→ 10) and (7→ 11)
underestimates the pairwise difference between 10 and 11,
causing a deviation of point 10 from the orthogonal line A,
which moves it to the position of the triangle.

E(x) = 0 if x is an integer, and E(x) = 0.5 if x is a half-integer. The total deviation W of a system is given by summing
all possible quartets of o, a, b, and i.
W = ∑iWi = ∑i ∑o, a, b Vo, a, b, i.

(3)

Core set approach
Our core set approach is achieved by an iteration of the
following two procedures (a) and (b):
(a) Exclusion of sequences with deviations from the orthogonality
The first procedure identifies the sequence that gives the
largest deviation (Wi value in Eq. (3)), and then excludes
it. By repeating this procedure until any Wi values become
zero, we obtain a P-core set of sequences that satisfies the
orthogonality. The obtained core-set tree contains no correlated mutations and satisfies the compatibility. Therefore, it can be strictly reproduced by existing methods
(MP, SP, ML and NJ). Each node sequence in this tree can
be easily determined using three sequences which are of
the nearest neighbour to this node.
(b) Insertion of excluded sequences based on a min-max criterion
The second procedure is to insert the excluded sequences
into the P-core set tree, using a min-max criterion. By
depositing each of these sequences into this tree, we can

Page 14 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:41

select a triplet (o, a, b) of probes that gives a maximum
deviation, maxD, for this sequence, since the core set
sequences satisfy the orthogonality perfectly. The
sequence with the minimum value of maxD is the candidate. If PAUP* (HSEARCH with option of RANDOM)
estimates a single MP tree, the expanded set becomes an
updated core set and becomes the "current core set" in the
next step. If not, the sequence is suspended in the remaining sequences and the sequence with the second smallest
maxD becomes the candidate. Once the core set is
updated, the maximum deviation from the updated core
set becomes a new maxD values. This process continues as
far as the core set is updated. As a result, we obtain the Score set. We further expand the core set with the same
process except that the tree of the current core set is
regarded as real and fixed. If the phylogenetic location of
the candidate sequence is uniquely determined by maximum parsimony, the sequence is added to the current
core set resulting in the updated core set. Continuing this
process until the core set cannot be updated, we obtain
the T-core set. One insertion creates one node, the
sequence of which is determined using the sequence to be
inserted and the two node or endpoint sequences of the
nearest neighbour. Here, the distances between this
sequence and the other nodes and endpoints are modified
so as to satisfy the additivity (Wi = 0). Consequently, this
sequence is identified as a core set member. The procedure
of T-core set tree-building is so useful that the S-core set
tree may be almost constructed by this procedure and
finally confirmed by using the PAUP*. Software is available using Additional file 5.
(c) Local core sets to remove long-branch attractions
The first performance of the above-mentioned two procedures provides a "global core set" containing the maximum number of sequences for which MP has a single
solution. However, attractions among long branches may
make it difficult to further incorporate the excluded
sequences into the global core set. To solve this problem,
we decompose the global core set tree into two subgroups
(each subgroup has to include more than three
sequences). All the excluded sequences are merged into
the first subgroup of core-set member and the procedure
(a) is applied to the merged group (first subgroup +
excluded sequence) with keeping a condition of preserving the tree structure of the global core-set. Then, the
sequences that satisfy the orthogonality within this group
are drawn out to construct a local P-core set. Here, when
added sequences form the outside branches (outgroup) in
this subgroup tree, they are suspended. We next insert the
remaining excluded sequences by using the procedure (b),
and get a local S-core set in which MP gives a unique tree
within this subgroup. The two procedures are applied also
to the second subgroup of core set. Here, the sequences
inserted, as a result, into the two subgroups are sus-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/41

pended. The two procedures are applied to all possible
pairs of subgroups. The procedure of T-core set tree-building is finally applied to the whole system for the remaining excluded sequences.
We furthermore decompose the global core set tree into
more than three subgroups, and repeat the above-mentioned procedure. As a result, we obtain a maximum set of
sequences in which there is no more sequence to be incorporated at a certain number of subgroups. It is here noted
that MP proposes multiple solutions for the sequences
containing the local S-core sets due to long-branch attractions.
(d) Remaining sequences with two phylogenetic positions.
The core set approach detected through practical applications that the remaining sequences despite the procedures
(a)-(c) have two phylogenetic positions. The following
three patterns were found for these unplaced sequences.
Figure 7 shows three branching patterns that an ancestral
sequence 1 with a sequence of the same nucleotide (A,
adenine) splits into three sequences of 2, 3 and 4. Here, A
n→C denotes a substitution from A to C at the n th site.
The dotted lines denote alternative positions of sequence
4. One of two sites is shared in Fig. 7a. Two of three sites
are shared in Fig. 7b. Two of four sites are shared in Fig.
7c. In this situation, sequence 4 cannot be uniquely
placed by the maximum parsimony criterion. However,
since the alternative positions is explicitly indicated, we
can estimate the nucleotide transitions in all possible
branching patterns with the variance around their average
value.
(e) CPU time of numerical calculations.
The majority of the CPU time is the calculation of the
deviation index value, which includes the four DOLOOPS in a FORTRAN program with double precision.
This means that the CPU is proportional to N4 with the
number N of sequences. It took about 12 seconds for N =
36 sequences and 8 hours for N = 198 sequences with a
standard personal computer (for instance, Pentium
2GHz). Therefore, the proportional constant is about
50000-1 seconds. On the other hand, we used the PAUP*
for the MP method, but this software has a limit (the
number of sequences is less than 14) in the "exhaust"
option in which all the possible topologies can be
searched. Since it is well known that the number of topologies explodes with increase of N, our approach has an
advantage in this respect.

given by the two-step procedure (b), in which the lineage of the 207th,
242nd, 284th and 245th haplotypes moved from group 7–2 to group 7–
