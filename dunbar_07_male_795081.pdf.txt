Abstract
The claim that differences in brain size across primate species has mainly been driven by the
demands of sociality (the "social brain" hypothesis) is now widely accepted. Some of the evidence
to support this comes from the fact that species that live in large social groups have larger brains,
and in particular larger neocortices. Lindenfors and colleagues (BMC Biology 5:20) add significantly
to our appreciation of this process by showing that there are striking differences between the two
sexes in the social mechanisms and brain units involved. Female sociality (which is more affiliative)
is related most closely to neocortex volume, but male sociality (which is more competitive and
combative) is more closely related to subcortical units (notably those associated with emotional
responses). Thus different brain units have responded to different selection pressures.

Lindenfors and colleagues [1] provide us with an elegant
example of how to use comparative methods to test complex hypotheses so as to reveal something novel and previously unappreciated about the world. They argue that
sex differences in the nature of sociality might mean that
the brains of the two sexes have been influenced by different selection pressures. In primates, the intensity of social
life imposes massive cognitive requirements in a way that
is probably unique to this order. Nonetheless, sexual
selection is a powerful influence on male behaviour and
anatomy [2], and this raises the question of whether it is
conflict or cooperation that underpins primate sociality.
Testing between these hypotheses directly is all but
impossible, as none of the brain databases available provide sufficiently large samples for the two sexes to be separated. Instead, Lindenfors et al make the novel
suggestion that we might gain some insights by asking
whether simple indices of the costs of sociality (typical
number of females in a group) and sexual selection

(number of males) correlate differentially with different
brain units.
This study provides a nice example of a kind of analysis
that could not have been performed other than by using
the comparative methods of evolutionary biology. The
past decade has witnessed the rise of two quite separate
approaches to the study of brain evolution. One derives
from evolutionary biology, and uses cross-species analyses to test statistical hypotheses; the other derives from
neuroscience, and uses single-species descriptions or
experimental tests comparing (usually) just two or three
species.
The discovery of novel cell units (notably spindle cells in
the Anterior Cingulate Cortex [3] or mirror neurones [4])
that may be unique to humans and apes, or that are implicated in complex social behaviour, has attracted particular
attention. Similarly, specific genes such as GLUD2 (a ret-

rogene, responsible for clearing the by-products of neurone firing) [5] and ASPM and microcephalin (both of
which are implicated in brain growth) [6,7] have been
heralded as the way ahead because they seem to be specifically associated with the rapid evolution of the unusually
large brains and more sophisticated cognitive abilities of
humans [8,9].
Exciting as these developments are, they have one serious
drawback: they fail to address two key issues of fundamental importance. First, they merely provide explanations for how the changes in brain size (and hence
cognitive ability) were brought about; they tell us nothing
at all about why such changes occurred. The second is that,
no matter how exciting they may be, small changes in
minor bits of wetware do not explain the one really spectacular feature of brain evolution – the sheer size of the
brains with which some species saddle themselves. Brains
are exceptionally expensive in terms of energy consumption, accounting for 8–10 times more energy per unit
mass than the average for the body as a whole [10]. For it
to be worthwhile for an organism to grow a large brain,
there must be a proportional benefit. The consensus, for
primates at least, is that the benefit comes from the capacity to create and maintain complex societies that provide
individuals with much more effective means for solving
the problems of everyday survival and reproduction (conventionally known as the "social brain" hypothesis)
[11,12].
In my experience, there is a widespread perception in the
neurosciences that evolutionary hypotheses can best be
tested by comparing two species at the micro-neurobiology level (better still by a transgenic experiment).
Although we should not underestimate the importance of
such studies, these are at best rather weak tests of any
underlying hypotheses. A comparison of two species that
differ in some gross trait (e.g. monogamous prairie voles
versus polygamous montane voles [13]) hardly comes
close to being a serious attempt to control for the vast
arrays of behaviour and physiology by which any two species differ. At worst, it falls foul of the classic logical error
of inferring all from some (the well known "composition
fallacy"). Most biological phenomena are quantitative,
and only a "dose-response" design is really acceptable.
In practice, there is only one way to test hypotheses of this
kind, and that is by comparative analyses using modern
statistical methods. These have two advantages that experimental manipulations simply cannot hope to match.
First, they can draw on very large samples of species. This
is important because it allows us to cope with the inevitably large amount of error variance present in all biological
phenomena. Second, statistical methods allow us to
incorporate many confounding variables at the same time

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/21

in such a way as to partial out their effects [12]. Experimental manipulations are intended to spread the noise in
natural phenomena evenly across experimental conditions, the underlying assumption being that biological
processes are univariate and everything else is irrelevant
noise [14]. In fact, most biological phenomena are multivariate, and the "noise" is not noise, but rather part of the
organism's response to the complexities of the real world.
The experimental method was designed to deal with very
simple systems; with complex systems, they often destroy
the very thing under study [14].
In the present case, Lindenfors et al demonstrate, with
appropriate controls for phylogenetic relatedness (always
a problem in comparative analyses), that the number of
females in a primate group correlates positively only with
the relative size of the telencephalon (controlling for total
brain volume), and especially with neocortex volume,
and not with the volume of other major brain units. In
contrast, the number of males correlates positively only
with the relative size of the diencephalon (which includes
the limbic system and the hypothalamus). Significantly,
the septum (which plays a role in controlling aggression)
correlates negatively with male group size, suggesting that,
as the level of competition between males increases, the
level of cortical control over aggression is actually reduced
(presumably in order to ensure that males respond aggressively, rather than submissively, to challenges).
This suggests that male and female brains have responded
to different kinds of social pressures: females to social
integration, males to male-male competition and fighting. This concurs nicely with the evidence from genomic
imprinting that neocortex size (broadly considered to be
the brain unit most relevant to sociality) is inherited
maternally, but the limbic system (perhaps most closely
involved in male responsiveness in agonistic contexts) is
paternally inherited [15].
These findings address another dispute that has been rumbling on for more than a decade. Developmental neurobiologists [16,17] have been impressed by the degree of
scaling between brain components, and have argued that
this is an inevitable consequence of the processes of brain
ontogeny. In contrast, evolutionary biologists have argued
for a mosaic view of brain evolution: individual components can evolve at different rates under different selection
pressures [18]. The present findings clearly support the
latter claim.
Nonetheless, the bottom line is, perhaps, that we need
much closer integration than hitherto seems to have been
the case between those who work on the neurobiology
and those who work on the larger comparative scale, and
a better understanding by both sides of each other's con-

tributions. The current stand-off between neuroscientists
and comparative biologists is unproductive for both sides.
This is especially true in the context of primate brain evolution, because there has been a consistent (if perhaps
understandable) tendency for neuroscientists to use
naively simplistic measures of sociality.
