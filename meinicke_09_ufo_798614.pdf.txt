Abstract
Background: Functional profiling is a key technique to characterize and compare the functional
potential of entire genomes. The estimation of profiles according to an assignment of sequences to
functional categories is a computationally expensive task because it requires the comparison of all
protein sequences from a genome with a usually large database of annotated sequences or
sequence families.
Description: Based on machine learning techniques for Pfam domain detection, the UFO web
server for ultra-fast functional profiling allows researchers to process large protein sequence
collections instantaneously. Besides the frequencies of Pfam and GO categories, the user also
obtains the sequence specific assignments to Pfam domain families. In addition, a comparison with
existing genomes provides dissimilarity scores with respect to 821 reference proteomes.
Considering the underlying UFO domain detection, the results on 206 test genomes indicate a high
sensitivity of the approach. In comparison with current state-of-the-art HMMs, the runtime
measurements show a considerable speed up in the range of four orders of magnitude. For an
average size prokaryotic genome, the computation of a functional profile together with its
comparison typically requires about 10 seconds of processing time.
Conclusion: For the first time the UFO web server makes it possible to get a quick overview on
the functional inventory of newly sequenced organisms. The genome scale comparison with a large
number of precomputed profiles allows a first guess about functionally related organisms. The
service is freely available and does not require user registration or specification of a valid email
address.

Background
The assignment of genes to certain functional categories is
a central task in genome annotation. The distribution of
assignments, i.e. the functional profile, provides a highly
informative summary of a genome. Functional profiling
plays a key role in comparative genomics for studying
aspects of systems biology on a genome wide scale [1].
Without the restriction of DNA sequencing to culturable

organisms, metagenomics allows to study the genomic
potential of whole microbial communities. Functional
profiling of metagenomes is an essential tool for comparative analysis of microbial ecosystems [2]. In the context
of functional genomics, gene clusters and protein
domains are widely used for homology-based annotation.
Both approaches cover different aspects of the annotation
and are often used in parallel to obtain a comprehensive

description. While gene clusters as used for COGs [3] or
within the SEED framework [4] provide a valuable
resource for functional annotation based on the identification of homologous genes, the domain based approach
is focussed on modelling and detection of functional
modules which usually involve only parts of a gene. At the
level of functional modules, the Pfam domain family
database [5] currently provides the highest coverage.
State-of-the-art methods for protein domain detection,
like HMMER [6], are computationally expensive and several approximation techniques have been suggested to
accelerate the model based prediction of protein domains.
With a slight loss of sensitivity fast prefiltering methods
can achieve speed ups of about two orders of magnitude
as compared with HMMER [7]. Computational speed is of
particular importance for the design of web-based
sequence analysis tools. Due to computational expense
most web servers for protein domain search only provide
a single-sequence submission interface [8,9]. In addition
to single sequence submission, the Pfam web server [5]
also offers a batch option which allows the user to submit
small multiple fasta files. These files are restricted to a
maximum of 1000 protein sequences with a maximum
sequence length of 2000 residues.
Using machine learning techniques for feature-based protein sequence classification [10-12], the UFO web server
for ultra-fast functional profiling provides an instantaneous estimation of Pfam profiles, i.e. frequencies of Pfam
domains, for large sets of protein sequences. With a speed
up of four orders of magnitude, UFO is well prepared to
cope with the rapidly growing amount of genomic and
metagenomic sequence data.

Construction and content
The UFO web server has been built around an efficient
implementation of machine learning techniques for protein sequence classification which have been described in
[10-12]. Fast feature-based techniques for protein
sequence representation have been combined with a
multi-class multi-label approach [12] to assign protein
sequences to Pfam domain families. While our previous
model was obtained from training with about 1.5 × 105
sequences from the Pfam A release 22 seed alignments,
UFO is based on training with the complete Pfam A
release 23 full alignments which comprise more than 6 ×
106 domain sequences. As an important difference, our
previous publication [12] only considers a prefiltering
method that uses the family specific scores from feature
space discriminants to produce a ranking of domain models which in turn can be used to reduce the set of HMMER
models in subsequent searches. UFO also uses a highdimensional word-based feature space [11] according to a
word length of 20 amino acids, but in addition the discri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/409

minant scores of the five highest scoring domain families
are passed to a small neural network to decide whether a
score actually indicates a valid match. The neural network
architecture and its training has been described in [13] for
the case of metagenomic gene prediction. UFO uses a network with five hidden units and with three inputs which
correspond to the particular discriminant score and the
mean and maximum score over all models. The output
corresponds to an estimated posterior probability of a true
match. Currently, domain families with a probability
above 0.5 are reported as valid matches. In comparison
with profile hidden Markov models [6], the feature-based
machine learning approach does not provide a localization of protein domains but merely an indication of the
presence or absence of a certain domain within a protein
sequence. This implies that also the order or the repetition
of domains cannot be predicted by the utilized approach.
However, for the purpose of functional profiling this kind
of "pure" domain detection usually does not mean a limitation. Actually, it has been shown that the prediction of
protein function can be realized fairly well without considering domain repetitions or the ordering of domains
[14]. For reasons of speed, another restriction as compared with Pfam/HMMER arises from the maximum
number of domain families which can be detected within
a single sequence. Currently, a protein sequence can be
assigned to at most five different families. Only in rare
cases we observed that this number was exceeded in the
existing annotations.
In the first instance, the UFO server provides an ultra-fast
search engine for detection of protein domains [5] according to the Pfam A release 23 from July 2008 which comprises 10340 domain families. In addition, UFO contains
the precomputed profiles of 821 genomes from the
HAMAP database (release from March 2009) [15] which
are used for profile comparison. These reference genomes
include 54 archaeal, 721 bacterial, and 46 eukaryotic proteomes, respectively. The complete list of reference
genomes can be found in one of the UFO output files
which are described in the next section. As a dissimilarity
measure UFO utilizes the "profile divergence" with
respect to these proteomes, which is computed in terms of
Jeffreys' J-divergence, a symmetrized version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions [16]. Given two profiles P, Q with estimated domain
probabilities pi, qi for n domain families the profile divergence is

suitable value of c was determined by hierarchical cluster
analysis based on the above divergence measure. For that
purpose, a complete linkage clustering was applied to a
collection of 1017 prokaryotic profiles from 21 different
phyla. To cope with the typical database bias towards particular culturable organisms [17], from all profiles that
correspond to the same genus only the medoid profile,
which by definition yields the minimal sum of divergences to the members of that genus, was selected for clustering. For a varying pseudocount parameter with 101
logarithmically spaced values in the interval [10-8, 102]
and each partition in the range between 10 and 50 clusters
the agreement of the clustering with the given taxonomic
groups on phylum level was measured by the adjusted
Rand index [18]. The best agreement was obtained for a
pseudo count c = 0.01 with 22 clusters which resulted in a
maximal adjusted Rand index of 5.17. For that partition
the maximal within cluster divergence was dc = 3.53. This
value is actually used by the UFO server to scale the profile
divergence by D(P, Q)/dc to a more meaningful range,
where values clearly below 1 usually correspond to phylogenetically and functionally related organisms.

Utility and discussion
User interface
Considering the functionality of the UFO web server
application, its use proceeds in the following manner:
first, the user submits a collection of protein sequences in
multiple fasta format either by pasting into the sequence
input window or by uploading a valid multiple fasta file
(see Figure 1). The maximum overall input size is 30
Mbyte. Sequences longer than 5000 amino acids are truncated and a corresponding warning is displayed. After submission the status of the processing is displayed in
intervals of two seconds until the output files have been
written. Then the results are shown on a new page which

Figure 1

UFO job submission page.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/409

provides several statistics, links for additional information, and a download section (see Figure 2). The statistics
comprise runtime, the total number of detected domains
and a top ten list of the most abundant domain families
together with hyperlinks to the corresponding Pfam family description. Further information about the functional
profile can be obtained on two additional results pages.
The first page shows a more detailed view on the UFO
assignments (see Figure 3): in a scrollable window, for
each input sequence (fasta header) the Pfam domain
assignments are displayed together with the associated
Gene Ontology [19] annotation. While the name of the
Pfam and GO categories is shown directly, the corresponding identifiers provide hyperlinks to a detailed
description of the associated categories. In addition, the
output probability score of the neural network is shown
for the particular assignment. The value is in the range
between 0.5 and 1.0 with high values above 0.9 usually
indicating good matches. On another page the 10 nearest
species in terms of the profile divergence with respect to a
collection of precomputed reference profiles are shown in
a sorted list (see Figure 4). The genome identifiers in that
list provide hyperlinks to the corresponding HAMAP
description for further information about the associated
species. The complete list of 821 reference species together
with the corresponding profile divergences (in ascending
order) can be obtained as a text file by some link at the
bottom of that page.
In the "Downloads" section of the main results page, several output files are available in plain ascii format. In addition a Perl script "ufo2hmmer" for postprocessing of the
UFO assignments by means of selected HMMER/Pfam
searches can be obtained. This script requires local
HMMER and Perl installations and can be used to further
increase the specificity of the domain detection. In addition, postprocessing of UFO matches with HMMER provides additional information about sequence positions,
repetitions, and the order of the domains.
Output files
The first output file contains the complete Pfam profile in
terms of domain specific detection counts sorted in
descending order. The second file contains the corresponding GO profile which shows the assignment frequencies with respect to Gene Ontology categories. The
GO counts result from applying the Pfam2GO mapping
to the Pfam profile and again the frequencies are shown in
descending order. The third file contains the sequence
specific assignments to Pfam domain families together
with the corresponding GO annotation and the match
probability score of the neural network. This file may also
be used for further processing, e.g. for Pfam/HMMER
search of the UFO detected domains using the provided
"ufo2hmmer" script.

Performance analysis
The performance of UFO was evaluated in two aspects:
first, the accuracy of profiling was measured in terms of
the underlying domain detection sensitivity and specificity on whole genome protein collections. Secondly, the
speed of UFO was measured in terms of the run time
required for the profiling of proteomes. To avoid direct
overlap with the training sequences from the Pfam 23
(July 2008) release, I used the (multiple fasta) protein
sequence files of 206 genomes from the "latest species"
section of the Integr8 web site [20] where these genomes
have been included since release 90/91 from January/February 2009. For a complete list of the test genomes see
Additional file 1. Sensitivity and specificity were measured
by means of a comparison with the available InterPro [21]
Pfam hits from the Integr8 ftp site. Considering a single
protein sequence, a true positive (TP) is counted if a protein domain family that has been detected by UFO is

among the InterPro reference hits. A false negative (FN)
occurs if the domain of a reference hit is overseen by UFO
and a false positive (FP) is counted if an UFO detected
domain family does not occur in the corresponding InterPro reference. For each of the 206 genomes the sensitivity
is estimated by #TP/(#TP+#FN) and the specificity by
#TP/(#TP+#FP). The mean (median) sensitivity and specificity over all genomes is 97.7 (98.8) and 81.1 (81.8),
respectively. The histograms in Figure 5 show that by far
in most cases the sensitivity is above 95% with a slightly
worse distribution of the specificity. However, because of
the high sensitivity, UFO is well suitable for prefiltering.
By selective postprocessing with a Pfam/HMMER search
for the UFO detected domains (see "ufo2hmmer" in
download section) a 100% specificity according to the
above definition can easily be achieved. With an average
number of 3750 genes, UFO profiling of all 206 genomes
took about half an hour corresponding to an average runt-

ime of 9.7 seconds per genome. For comparison the RPSBLAST tool with the conserved domains database [9],
which is widely used for accelerated protein domain
searches, was locally installed and applied to the 206 test
proteomes. All Pfam 23 domain searches were performed
with default parameters and an E-value threshold of
0.001. Comparing the results with the InterPro reference,
RPS-BLAST showed a mean (median) sensitivity of 90.6
(90.7) percent and a mean (median) specificity of 69.8
(70.2) percent, which are significantly lower than the corresponding UFO rates. The histograms in Figure 6 show a
low variation of the sensitivity but for the specificity some
outliers at the lower end increase the range of values.
Referring to the runtime, RPS-BLAST took 59 CPU hours
for processing of all 206 proteomes, with an average runt-

ime of 17 minutes. Thus, UFO is about 100 times faster
than RPS-BLAST.
Table 1 shows a comparison of runtimes for five of the
smallest genomes which could also be processed by the
batch option at the Pfam web site. The HMMER (version
2.3.2, Oct 2003), RPS-BLAST (version 2.2.16, Mar 2007),
and UFO runtimes were measured as (single thread) user
times on the same CPU (AMD Opteron 2.0 GHz) showing
an UFO speed up of about four and two orders of magnitude if compared to HMMER and RPS-BLAST, respectively. This speed up makes it possible to pass UFO results
directly to the user, whereas the Pfam web server (March
2009) with an average processing time of more than 8
hours for the small genomes sends the results by email.

Example application and discussion
For an example application the proteome of a novel
Clostridium thermocellum strain (DSM 4150, Integr8 ID:
32332) from the above collection of 206 test genomes
was used to demonstrate the servers capabilities. Specifying the multiple fasta file of protein sequences on the UFO
job submission page (see Figure 1) and pressing the "Start
UFO" button initiates uploading and subsequent analysis
of that file. After the processing of all 2916 sequences

which takes about 7 seconds, the results page is generated
and displayed. The results are based on 3021 assignments
to Pfam domains which have been found in a total
number of 2087 sequences. This implies that no domains
have been found for 829 sequences. Besides the "assignments" page (see Figure 3) and the output files (hyperlinks) which allow a more detailed analysis of the profile
properties, the "top ten" lists provide a brief summary of

the most prevalent features. In the example (see Figure 2),
the most abundant Pfam family is the "Dockerin type I
repeat" PF00404 which has been found in 67 sequences.
Clicking the identifier shows the corresponding Pfam
description of the family which indicates a key role of that
domain in cellulose metabolization. Among the top 10
Pfams, also the "Cellulose binding domain" PF00942
found in 18 sequences indicates the importance of cellulose metabolism. The first entry of the nearest species list
(see Figure 4) corresponds to another strain of C. thermocellum (ATCC 27405/DSM 1237) with a slightly bigger
proteome set including 3102 proteins. According to the
corresponding HAMAP description (hyperlink), C. thermocellum is a gram-positive, anaerobic, and thermophilic
organism capable of cellulose degradation. The remaining
species in the list also belong to the class of Clostridia,
most of them are thermophilic. The closest five species are
all able to ferment organic substrates.
As indicated by the application example above, the
strength of UFO is its capability to produce a quick overview on the functional inventory of whole genomes in
terms of the most abundant protein domains and in terms
of the closest organisms with the most similar profiles. In
comparison to full annotation servers like RAST [22] the
UFO server only covers a particular aspect of genome
annotation. It merely provides a first step of a functional
analysis which can nevertheless be of great utility for
addressing many biological questions and problems. It is
not restricted to the analysis of prokaryotic genomes, and
it can be applied to eukaryotes as well, if gene predictions
are available. The runtimes for complete eukaryotic proteomes are usually above the average runtime for prokaryotes. For example, the proteome set of D. melanogaster
(15410 sequences) takes 64 seconds of processing time,
the C. elegans proteome (22984 sequences) requires 80
seconds. In addition, UFO can also be used to annotate
large collections of (translated) expressed sequence tags.
For prokaryotes the UFO domain detection can be used as
a basis for the prediction of operons or regulons. Furthermore, the server supports researchers in the identification
of functionally related species that can be used for annotation. For the analysis of microbial communities, gene

prediction tools specialized on short anonymous DNA
fragments [13,23,24] or a simple six-frame translation can
be used to apply UFO in functional metagenomics. In
comparison to the more comprehensive MG-RAST server
[25], UFO provides an easy-to-use interface with immediate response. For example, UFO profiling of the first of ten
depth-specific data sets from the hypersaline microbial
mat metagenome [26], which contains 12218 sequencing
reads with an average length of 700 bp, requires 75 seconds for processing of the six-frame translated reads. The
processing of all ten data sets takes about 15 minutes.
Inspection of the top ten Pfams shows a remarkable count
for sulfatase (PF00884) assignments in lower layers with
a maximum of 135 assignments in the fifth layer (4-5 mm
depth), which is in accordance with the results in [26]. In
general, the profile divergence with respect to the reference genomes is of limited use for metagenome analysis
because a metagenomic profile actually corresponds to a
mixture of several different species. However, if the habitat is dominated by a few closely related species, the UFO
"top 10 nearest species" list may nevertheless be informative. In case of the hypersaline microbial mat the UFO
results indicate a dominant role of Cyanobacteria in the
two upmost layers (0-1 mm and 1-2 mm) with 9 and 6
out of 10 nearest species, respectively. This observation is
in agreement with the analysis in [26] which indicates
that Cyanobacteria together with Alphaproteobacteria are
the most abundant phyla in these layers. Especially in
metagenomics, the GO profile may facilitate the analysis
because Pfam assignments are accumulated in categories,
which directly relate to the biological questions. For
example, considering the frequencies of the "chemotaxis"
term (GO:0006935) for the hypersaline microbial mat
data, the maximum count (55 assignments) is found in
the third layer (2-3 mm) at the oxic-anoxic boundary,
which agrees well with the original study [26].

Conclusion
With a considerable speed up of protein domain detection, UFO shows a new perspective in web-based large
scale analysis of protein sequence data. As a consequence
of its speed it can be used for instantaneous profiling of
genome scale protein sequence files. The processing time

Page 7 of 9

roughly corresponds to the duration of a single sequence
analysis as provided by current protein database servers.
On the scale of prokaryotic genomes, UFO can process
thousands of whole genome protein sets a day. In that
way UFO is well prepared for next generation sequencing
technologies like single cell sequencing [27], which allows
to extract whole genomes from highly diverse metagenomic samples.
