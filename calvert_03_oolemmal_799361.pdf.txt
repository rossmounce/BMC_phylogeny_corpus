Abstract
Background: The mature mouse egg contains the full complement of maternal proteins required
for fertilization, the transition to zygotic transcription, and the beginning stages of embryogenesis.
Many of these proteins remain to be characterized, therefore in this study we have identified highly
abundant egg proteins using a proteomic approach and found that several of these proteins also
appear to localize to the egg surface. Characterization of such molecules will provide important
insight into the cellular events of fertilization and early development.
Methods: In order to identify some of the more abundant egg proteins, whole egg extracts were
resolved on coomassie-stained two-dimensional (2D) PAGE gels. Several highly abundant protein
spots were cored and microsequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (TMS), and determined to
be molecular chaperone proteins. Concurrent experiments were performed to identify oolemmal
proteins using 2D avidin blotting. Proteins spots that appeared to be surface labeled by biotinylation
were correlated with the initial coomassie-stained reference gel. Surprisingly, some of the surface
labelled proteins corresponded to those abundant chaperone proteins previously identified. To
confirm whether these molecules are accumulating at the oolemmal surface in eggs, we performed
immunofluoresence on live, zona-free eggs using antibodies to HSP70, HSP90, GRP94, GRP78,
calreticulin and calnexin.
Results: The putative surface-labeled proteins identified by biotinylation included the molecular
chaperones HSP70 (MW 70 KDa, pI 5.5), HSP90a (MW 85 KDa, pI 4.9), GRP94 (MW 92 KDa, pI
4.7), GRP78 (MW 72 KDa, pI 5.0), Oxygen regulated protein 150 (ORP150; MW 111 KDa, pI 5.1),
Calreticulin (MW 48 KDa, pI 4.3), Calnexin (MW 65 KDa, pI 4.5), and Protein disulfide isomerase
(PDI; MW 57 KDa, pI 4.8). Immunofluoresence results showed that antibodies to HSP90, GRP94,
GRP78 and calreticulin were reactive with oolemmal proteins. We were unable to confirm surface
localization of HSP70 or calnexin by this method.
Conclusions: We report here the identification of nine highly abundant molecular chaperones in
the mouse egg proteome. In addition, we present preliminary data suggesting that these molecules
localize to the oolemma of the mature mouse egg.

Background
The egg is a transcriptionally inactive cell and as such is a
storehouse of maternal proteins and mRNA required for
fertilization and the initiation of zygotic development.
However, many of the proteins comprising the mature egg
proteome have yet to be identified. Identification and molecular characterization of such proteins will provide
much insight into the regulation of fertilization and early
embryogenesis. The surface of the egg consists of an extracellular matrix, or zona pellucida, and plasma membrane,
or oolemma, which sits beneath. The three proteins that
comprise the zona pellucida (ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3) and their
roles in sperm-binding are well characterized [1]. In contrast, little is known about the surface proteins of the egg
plasma membrane. Almeida et al. [2] demonstrated the
presence of α6β1 and αvβ3 integrins at the egg surface by
indirect immunofluorescence and PCR, and showed involvement of the α6β1 integrin in sperm-egg fusion by
peptide and antibody inhibition assays. Currently, however, the functional significance of egg surface integrins is
unclear. Data from Zhu and Evans [3] substantiates the involvement of α4/α9 integrin and α6 integrin in sperm-egg
binding, while other results have been contradictory
([4,5], see Primakoff and Myles, [6] for review). There is
now compelling evidence demonstrating that CD9, a tetraspan membrane protein, is present on the oolemma and
essential for sperm-egg fusion, possibly by organizing
functional multimolecular complexes in the egg [7]. Glycosyl-phophatidyniositol (GPI)-anchored proteins have
also been described on the oolemma and implicated in
sperm-egg fusion; removal of GPI-anchored protein from
the egg plasma membrane results in greatly reduced fertilization rates without affecting sperm-zona pellucida
binding [8]. Other egg surface molecules are the adhesion
molecules NCAM, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and ECAD [9], and
the selectins [10]. Additionally, the IgG receptor [11],
complement receptors C1q [12], CD35 and CD11b, [13]
and the Fc gamma receptors [14] exhibit oolemmal expression in a variety of mammalian species.
Molecular chaperones bind to nascent proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), promote proper protein folding, and prevent the aggregation of nonnative and
misfolded proteins. Most are constitutively expressed at
low levels in almost all cell-types, but a number are upregulated in response to cellular stresses and these are known
as the heat shock proteins (HSPs). A number of molecular
chaperones are retained in the ER, due to a conserved signal sequence at the C-terminal end of the protein,
(KDEL), which binds to a receptor in the Golgi apparatus
[15]. More recently, however molecular chaperones bearing the ER retention signal have been localized to the surface of different cell types. Calnexin, Calreticulin, GRP94
(glycoprotein 96) and GRP78 (BiP) have been identified

http://www.RBEj.com/content/1/1/27

on the cell surface of immature thymocytes [16,17]. Cell
surface expression of GRP94 is found in lymphocytes and
lymphoid-like cells from several vertebrate species and is
phylogenetically conserved [18]. Calnexin has been found
on the surface of pro-B cells [19], as well as in a variety of
mammalian culture cells [20] and a number of HSPs are
found expressed on the cell surface in human and murine
tumor cells [21–24]. Calreticulin, GRP78 and PDI were
described on the plasma membrane of different cell types
[25–28]; GRP78, GRP94, and PDI, have been found on
the surface of rat exocrine pancreatic cells [29,30], and
GRP78 cell surface expression was recently shown in human endothelial cells [31].
A number of reports have characterized constitutive expression of HSP70 and HSP90 in both immature oocytes
and ovulated eggs from various species [32–36]. HSP70
and HSP89 are constitutively synthesized in the immature, preovulatory mouse oocyte, although the expression
is not heat-inducible [37]. Levels of HSP70 mRNA decrease following oocyte maturation and ovulation [38],
and HSP70 is one of the first genes to be transcribed at the
onset of zygotic gene activation in the early 2-cell mouse
embryo [39,40]. Interestingly, while previous investigators did not localize HSP70 to the oolemma, they did
demonstrate that the presence of anti-HSP70 antibody reduces bovine sperm-egg binding in vitro. indicating a possible role for HSP70 in fertilization [41]). An egg-surface
sperm receptor, identified on sea urchin oocytes, bears a
sperm-binding domain with sequence similarity to
HSP70 and its recombinant protein binds sperm and inhibits fertilization in vitro [42]. Among the other molecular chaperones described here, calreticulin has been found
in oocytes from a number of species [43]. Interestingly,
Munoz-Gotera et al. [44] showed that calreticulin localizes to cortical granules in guinea pig oocytes and is released
into the perivitelline space following activation. PDI has
been identified in sea urchin eggs [45], though localized
only to the ER. Calnexin, GRP78, GRP94, and ORP150
have not been previously identified in oocytes of any
species.
In order to identify maternal proteins present in the ovulated mouse egg, we performed 2D gel electrophoresis of
proteins extracted from 2850 whole mature eggs and
cored those protein spots that appeared to be most abundant. Concurrently, we surface labelled zona-free eggs
with biotin and performed 2D avidin blotting to attempt
to identify surface proteins. Proteins that appeared to be
surface labelled were then cross-referenced between corresponding silver-stained 2D gels of egg extracts and compared to microsequence data from the coomassie-stained
reference gel. We report here the preliminary identification of nine highly abundant HSPs and related chaperones in the mature mouse egg that also appear to be

surface labelled. To support the hypothesis that these molecular chaperones localize to the egg surface, we performed indirect immunofluorescence analysis and found
that antibodies to HSP90α, GRP94, GRP78 and Calreticulin specifically bind to proteins on the oolemma.

Methods
All experiments requiring the use of animals were performed according to USDA-condoned protocols and received prior approval by the University of Virginia IACUC
committee.
Egg isolation
Mature, metaphase II-arrested mouse eggs were collected
from superovulated 24-gram ICR female mice (Harlan
Breeders, Indianapolis; Hilltop Labs, Philadelphia)
primed with 7 IU PMSG 48 hr and 7 IU HCG 15 hr prior
to egg collection. Cumulus – oocyte complexes were collected from oviducts of superovulated ICR strain females,
in medium-199 (M199, Gibco-BRL (Invitrogen),
Carlsbad, CA). Cumulus cells were removed by treating
eggs for 3 min with 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) in M199; eggs were washed through four 50ml drops of M199 medium covered with mineral oil using
a pulled , heat-polished, Pasteur pipette (employed in all
experiments). Zonae pellucidae were removed by treating
the eggs for 3 min with 10 µg/ml α-chymotrypsin (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) followed by mechanical shearing. Eggs
were washed in M199 medium and incubated in M199
medium overlaid with light mineral oil for 3 h at 37°C in
a 5% CO2 incubator to allow for recovery before use.
2D Electrophoresis
The eggs were extracted in Celis lysis buffer (see [46]) containing 2% (v:v) NP-40, 9.8 M urea, 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 2% ampholines (pH 3.5–10), and protease
inhibitors for 30 min at room temperature, according to
the protocol described in [47]. Isoelectric focusing of the
egg extracts (IEF) was performed using the Mini-PROTEAN II tube cell apparatus according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) with ampholines of
pH 3.5–5 (30%), 3.5–10 (40%), 5–7 (20%), and 7–9
(10%), (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The tube
gels were placed on 12% minislab gels and the focused
proteins were separated in the second dimension at 20
mA per gel. The gel was stained with coomassie (BioRad,
Hercules, CA) for 30 min., washed and abundant protein
spots (as determined by intensity of staining) were cored
and submitted for microsequencing by TMS.
Protein microsequencing
Peptide sequencing was performed by the W.M. Keck
Foundation Center for Biomedical Mass Spectrometry at
the University of Virginia. Surface-labeled egg proteins
were identified on 2D streptavidin immunoblots, and cor-

responding silver-stained protein spots were cored from a
1.5 mm-thick 2D SDS-PAGE gel that had been run in tandem. The gel core was diced into small pieces, destained
with 1:1 v/v 30 mM potassium ferricyanide and 100 mM
sodium thiosulfate, reduced in 10 mM DTT, and alkylated
in 50 mM iodoacetamide in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate. After reagents were removed, the gel pieces were incubated with 12.5 ng/µl trypsin in 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate overnight at 37°C. Digested peptides were extracted from the gel fragments in 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid and evaporated to 25 µl for microsequencing.
Peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a capillary HPLC column interfaced to a Finnigan MAT
TSQ7000 electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole
mass spectrometer. Selected peptides were mass analyzed
using capillary liquid chromatography, yielding a collision-activated dissociation (CAD) spectra from which the
amino acid sequence could be determined. Amino acid
sequences were entered into and searched against the protein and DNA databanks using Sequest software available
from GenBank.
Surface labeling
This procedure is explained in detail in Coonrod et al,
1999 [8]. Briefly, after collection zona-free eggs were
washed six times in BWW medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 100 µg/ml polyvinylalcohol (PVA,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO), biotinylated with 2 mg/ml SulfoNHS biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in BWW/PVA for 7 min
at room temperature, and washed six times in BWW/PVA.
Biotinylated eggs were extracted in Celis buffer and run on
a 2D gel as described above. The proteins were then electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes at 125 mA for 45
min. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in PBS
with 0.1% Tween and 5% dried milk for 30 min at room
temperature, washed 1 × in PBS/0.1% Tween, and probed
with 20 mg/ml streptavidin-HRP (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for
30 min at room temperature. The blots were washed 3 ×
15 min in PBS/0.1% Tween and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 5 min. An identical number of eggs
were collected and remained untreated prior to protein extraction, and proteins from these eggs were separated according to the same protocol outlined above. This gel was
silver-stained according to Hochstrasser et al. [48].
Indirect immunofluorescence with zona-free Eggs
Antibody Reagents: All antibodies used in these experiments were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents, Golden,
CO and all were diluted in M199 media to desired concentration. Anti-GRP94 (clone 9G10) is a rat monoclonal
IgG antibody used at 50 µg/ml. Purified rat IgG was diluted to 50 µg/ml for use as a negative control. Anti-calnexin
(clone AF18), Anti-HSP90 (clone 3B6), and anti-HSP70
(5A5) are mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies, and were

Zona-free eggs were prepared as described above and allowed to recover for 3 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator
before use. After the recovery period, eggs were washed
through 4 × 50 µl wash drops of M199 media (see [8] for
recipe). Live eggs were then incubated with primary antibody or control IgG as noted. The eggs were subsequently
washed in M199 media and incubated in the appropriate
secondary antibody for 1 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator, to determine the localization of primary antibody reactivity. Eggs were then washed in M199 media and
incubated in 10 µg/ml Hoechst chromatin stain at 37°C
for 10 min. Staining of the live eggs was visualized using
ultra violet light and a fluorescent filter on a light microscope (Standard 18 model, Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY).

1:100 for use as a negative control. The secondary antibodies used were cy3-conjugated anti-rat or mouse antibody at 1:200. Anti-calreticulin (cat. # PA3-900) and antiGRP78 (cat. # PA1-014) are rabbit polyclonal antibodies
and were used at a 1:200 dilution. Normal rabbit serum
was used at 1:200 as a negative control. The secondary antibody used was a cy3-conjgated anti-rabbit antibody at
1:200. Hoechst chromatin stain was used at 10 µg/ml in
PBS in order to determine which, if any, eggs had been activated or were undergoing degeneration as a consequence
of manipulation.

2D Electrophoresis and TMS identification of abundant
egg proteins
2D gel electrophoresis of whole egg extract from 2850 mature, metaphase II-arrested, untreated mouse eggs was performed in order to identify some of the more abundant
proteins of the egg proteome. The 2D gel repertoire of
whole, untreated eggs is presented in Fig. 1. Abundant,
coomassie stained egg protein spots were cored from the
gel and submitted for TMS analysis. Of the spots submitted, a subset matched known chaperones/HSP proteins;
these are HSP70, HSP90α, GRP78, GRP94, Calreticulin,
Calnexin, PDI, and ORP150, as indicated by labelled arrows in Fig. 1, displayed in Table 1.
Biotinylation and avidin blotting identifies surface-labeled
egg proteins
Separation of surface-labeled biotinylated egg proteins
followed by avidin blotting was utilized to identify surface-labeled proteins. For these experiments, proteins
from 800 zona-free biotinylated mouse eggs were extracted. The extracts from the treated eggs were separated by
2D gel electrophoresis, electroblotted to nitrocellulose
membranes, and probed with streptavidin-HRP. Biotinylated proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Another 800, untreated zona-free eggs were
extracted, separated by 2D electrophoresis and the gel was
silver-stained. The 2D gel repertoire of biotin-labeled oolemmal surface proteins is presented in Fig. 2A. The corresponding silver stained 2D gel of untreated eggs (from
which protein spots were cored for TMS) is presented in
Fig. 2B. To ensure that plasma membrane proteins were
biotinylated and cytoplasmic proteins were not, the blot
shown in Fig. 2B was stripped of streptavidin-HRP and reprobed with antibodies to tubulin and actin (two known
cytoskeletal proteins). The antibodies to the cytoplasmic
markers only recognized two spots on the blot and these
spots correspond to the expected mass and pI of tubulin
and actin (data not shown). No surface-labeling of these

alone did not result in any antibody reactivity (Fig. 3B). It
is not clear from these preliminary results what common
feature this subpopulation of positively staining eggs
shared in common, but there does not appear to be an association between activation status and the degree of positive staining. Anti-HSP90 antibodies reacted very strongly
with the egg plasma membrane of the majority of those
eggs examined (Fig. 4A). Incubating eggs in mouse IgG
alone did not result in any reactivity (Fig. 4B). Intriguingly, HSP90 staining was primarily localized to the microvillar region of normal eggs (the region opposite the pole
containing the metaphase chromatin) whereas the staining became delocalized and more intense following activation. Anti-calreticulin antibodies bound to the plasma
membrane in approximately half of the eggs, and no association with activation status was observed (Fig. 5A). AntiGRP78 antibodies bound to the plasma membrane in the
majority of the eggs examined (Fig. 5B). Incubating eggs
in normal rabbit sera alone did not result in any reactivity
(Fig. 5C). Neither anti-HSP70 nor anti-calnexin antibodies resulted in positive immunostaining in any of the eggs
examined (data not shown). A more rigorous quantitative
analysis of the surface localization of these molecular
chaperones to the oolemma is now required.

It has been estimated that individual mammalian cells express from 5,000, to 10,000 proteins at any given point in
time [49]. Analysis of the 2D gel shown in Fig. 1 shows
from ~3000 eggs, only several hundred proteins can be
resolved by coomassie-staining, and therefore these proteins are likely some of the most abundant proteins in the
ovulated mouse egg. In this study we have found that a
subset of these highly abundant proteins are molecular
chaperones. It will be of interest to establish the functional role of these proteins in the egg and early embryo.
HSP70 is one of the first genes to be expressed following
zygotic gene activation in the two-cell mouse embryo
[38–40] and appears to play a role in developmental processes in a number of species [50–53]. Endogenous HSP90
has also been implicated in developmental regulation in
the mouse [52], and GRP78 is described as having a stressresponse function during avian development [54]. Activation of the zygotic genome initiates an accumulation of
embryonic transcripts in the early two-cell embryo, and
this likely requires machinery to ensure the accurate translation and folding of nascent proteins. The HSPs and
chaperones found in the mature egg may represent a maternal stockpile of such folding machinery.

any reactivity (Fig. 3A). In contrast, incubating in rat IgG

Another preliminary finding of this study is that several
molecular chaperones appear to be localized to the egg
surface. Although HSPs were originally identified as a
family of proteins that are upregulated in response to cell
stress, most are also endogenously expressed under

physiological conditions. Constitutive expression of a
number of HSPs and molecular chaperones has been
characterized in immature oocytes and mature mouse
eggs [38–40], though none as yet have been localized to
the oolemma. Members of the chaperone/HSP protein
families, including those containing an ER retention signal (e.g. KDEL, KKXX) have been described on the cell surface in a wide variety of cell types [16–23,27,26,28,30,31],
though this phenomenon has not been previously described in oocytes or eggs. How these proteins are escaping ER retention is not yet known. It is possible that in
association with another protein or protein complex, the
chaperone's KDEL sequence is sterically prevented from
binding with ER retention receptors, and this allows the
protein to be transported to the plasma membrane. Another hypothesis is that alternative folding of the chaperone protein itself masks the retention sequence, allowing
it to escape the ER. Further studies are needed to confirm
the surface localization of these molecules and to determine which, if any, of these potential mechanisms are being employed.
The functional significance of surface expression of ER
chaperones in different cell types has yet to be determined. A sperm receptor identified on the surface of sea
urchin oocytes has an extracellular domain that shows
sequence similarity to HSP70 and appears to be required
for fertilization [42]. Additionally, members of the HSP
family are known to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis (see [55] for review). HSP70 and GRP78 both
have anti-apoptotic activity, whereas HSP90 appears to
have both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities, depending on the specific stimuli received. Early bovine embryos cultured in the presence of HSP70 antibodies
exhibit increased apoptosis and reduced embryo viability
[41]. However, it is still controversial as to whether the
unfertilized egg is actively apoptotic or undergoes necrosis
in the reproductive tract. During development, selective
cell death by apoptosis becomes crucial, and chaperone
molecules in the egg may play a role in later apoptotic
events. Future experiments need to be performed before
the significance of findings presented here can be addressed, both at the functional and mechanistic level. In
general, the molecular chaperones are proving to play a
wide variety of roles in diverse cellular processes and this
list will likely grow as our understanding of these molecules increases.

These results provide preilimary evidence for the presence
of these molecular chaperones on the egg surface.

Conclusions
Using 2D electrophoresis and TMS, we have identified
eight molecular chaperone proteins that are abundantly
expressed in the mature mouse egg. Of these proteins,
GRP 94, GRP 78, Calreticulin and HSP 90 can be surfacelabeled by biotin and appear to be localizing to the egg
surface based on preliminary immunofluoresence data.
