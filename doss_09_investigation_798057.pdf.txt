Abstract
Background: A central focus of cancer genetics is the study of mutations that are causally
implicated in tumorigenesis. The identification of such causal mutations not only provides insight
into cancer biology but also presents anticancer therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.
Missense mutations are nucleotide substitutions that change an amino acid in a protein, the
deleterious effects of these mutations are commonly attributed to their impact on primary amino
acid sequence and protein structure.
Methods: The method to identify functional SNPs from a pool, containing both functional and
neutral SNPs is challenging by experimental protocols. To explore possible relationships between
genetic mutation and phenotypic variation, we employed different bioinformatics algorithms like
Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT), Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen), and PupaSuite to
predict the impact of these amino acid substitutions on protein activity of mismatch repair (MMR)
genes causing hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).
Results: SIFT classified 22 of 125 variants (18%) as 'Intolerant." PolyPhen classified 40 of 125 amino
acid substitutions (32%) as "Probably or possibly damaging". The PupaSuite predicted the
phenotypic effect of SNPs on the structure and function of the affected protein. Based on the
PolyPhen scores and availability of three-dimensional structures, structure analysis was carried out
with the major mutations that occurred in the native protein coded by MSH2 and MSH6 genes. The
amino acid residues in the native and mutant model protein were further analyzed for solvent
accessibility and secondary structure to check the stability of the proteins.
Conclusion: Based on this approach, we have shown that four nsSNPs, which were predicted to
have functional consequences (MSH2-Y43C, MSH6-Y538S, MSH6-S580L, and MSH6-K854M), were
already found to be associated with cancer risk. Our study demonstrates the presence of other
deleterious mutations and also endorses with in vivo experimental studies.

Background
Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer
death in the western countries after lung cancer. Colorec-

tal cancer manifests itself after an accumulation of several
genetic alterations. These mutations can be either somatic
or inherited. The most common forms of heritable color-

ectal cancer are hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer
(HNPCC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).
Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is an autosomal dominant syndrome which accounts for about 1–
5% of colorectal cancer [1]. Lynch syndrome, also known
as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (MIM#
114500) is the most common form of inherited colorectal
cancer caused by mutations in high-penetrance genes.
Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is a dominant
condition, meaning that people with HNPCC have a 50%
chance of passing the HNPCC gene mutation (change) to
each of their children. With HNPCC, the lifetime risk for
colorectal cancer (CRC) is approximately 80% and the
lifetime risk of endometrial cancer is 40%. HNPCC is
associated with germline genetic alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The primary function of the
mismatch repair system is to eliminate single base substitutions and insertion-deletion errors that may arise during
DNA replication. The system involves several proteins
encoded by 5 different genes namely [MLH1 (MIM#
120436), MSH2 (MIM# 609309), MSH6 (MIM#
600678), PMS1 (MIM# 600258), and PMS2 (MIM#
600259)] have been implicated in HNPCC [2]. Loss of
mismatch repair gene activity leads to an accumulation of
replication errors and genetic instability that is exhibited
as micro satellite instability (MSI). Germline mutations in
MLH1 and MSH2 account for approximately 90% of
detected mutations in families with HNPCC where as
mutations in MSH6 account for about 7%–10%, and
PMS2 mutations in fewer than 5% of families with Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and risk of developing colorectal cancer is also increased among MSH2
mutation carriers as compared with MLH1 mutation carriers [3].
In human genome more than 99% genetic nucleotides are
same, only less than 1% genetic variations are different.
These genetic variations widely spread on species genome
which form a ubiquitous phenomenon cause the differences and diversities of the species. The variation in DNA
may consist of deletions where some pieces are missing,
insertions of new genetic material or changes in nucleotides, where a sequence is changed to another. Most of
the variation in human genome consists of substitutions
in single nucleotide, where one of the four nucleotides (A,
T, G, and C) has changed to another one. The phenomenon of having such a varying nucleotide at a certain locus
is referred as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).
Common definition of the SNP requires that the relative
frequency of the least frequent allele is greater than 0.01.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms are generally the most
common form polymorphisms of DNA sequence variation in the species genome and resource for mapping
complex genetic traits. There are now several databases
with these variations of single nucleotide polymorphisms,

http://www.jbiomedsci.com/content/16/1/42

such as the human genome variation database, HGVBase
[4] and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, dbSNP [5]. With exception of variants lying in promoters or splice site donors or acceptors,
it is difficult to determine the effect of non-coding SNPs
on gene expression. For this reason, particular attention
has been focused towards nonsynonymous coding SNPs
(nsSNPs), SNPs that cause amino acid alteration. These
types of alterations are believed to be more likely to cause
a change in structure and as such compromise the function of a protein. Our literature survey shows that nsSNPs
affect the functional roles of proteins in signal transduction of visual, hormonal and other stimulants [6,7] in
gene regulation by altering DNA and transcription factor
binding [8,9]. nsSNPs may inactivate functional sites of
enzymes or alter splice sites and thereby form defective
gene products [10,11]. They may destabilize proteins, or
reduce protein solubility [12], may have functional effects
on transcriptional regulation, by affecting transcription
factor binding sites in promoter or intronic enhancer
regions [13], or alternatively splicing regulation by disrupting exonic splicing enhancers or silencers [14]. To
understand the mechanism of phenotypic variations due
to nsSNPs, it is important to assess the structural consequences of the alteration of amino acid residue. With the
advent of high-throughput SNP detection techniques, the
number of known nsSNPs is growing rapidly, providing
an important source of information for studying the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes of human
diseases.
Over the past few years, quite a lot of studies have
attempted to predict the functional consequences of an
nsSNPs whether it is disease-related or neutral, based on
sequence information and structural attributes [15] using
computational algorithms such as SIFT and PolyPhen
algorithms to screen for deleterious nsSNPs [16,17]. The
structure of a protein can change in various ways due to
the biochemical differences of the amino acid variant
(acidic, basic, or hydrophobic) and by the location of the
variant in the protein sequence (by affecting tertiary or
quaternary structure or the active site where substrate
binds) which can have a deleterious effect on the structure
and/or function of the proteins [18]. Therefore, it is
important to determine whether an nsSNP that affects the
amino acid sequence of a gene product can alter protein
function and contribute to disease will be a challenge in
the coming years [19]. Several groups have tried to evaluate the deleterious nsSNPs based on 3-dimensional (3D)
structure information of proteins by in-silico analysis.
They indicated that the residue solvent accessibility,
which could identify the buried residues, was confidently
proposed as predictors of deleterious substitutions
[20,21]. Deleterious nsSNPs analyses for the HNPCC
genes have not been estimated computationally until

now, although they have been the focus for experimental
researchers. Therefore, in this work, the computational
algorithms namely SIFT, PolyPhen, PupaSuite, ASA View
and DSSP were used to identify the deleterious nsSNPs
that are likely to affect the function and structure of the
protein. Based on PolyPhen, we identified the possible
mutation, proposed a model structure for the mutant proteins and compared this with the native protein in the 3D modeled structure of the MSH2 and MSH6 gene. We
further analyzed native and mutant modeled proteins for
solvent accessibility and secondary structure analysis. Sec-

ondary structures and solvent accessibilities of amino acid
residues give a useful insight into the structure and function of a protein [22-25]. We have described our approach
using computational tools to provide related information
of SNPs and a guide to experimental biologists (Figure 1).
Our computational study also demonstrates the presence
of other deleterious mutations in other HNPCC genes in
which there is no availability of three- dimensional structure that may affect the expression and function of proteins with possible roles in colon cancer.

Materials and methods
Database Mining for SNPs
The list of HNPCC genes studied were obtained from the
Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim. We used Human genome
variation database, HGVBase http://hgvbase.cgb.ki.se and
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
database dbSNP http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/
SNP for the retrieval of SNPs and their related protein
sequence of five genes namely MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
PMS1 and PMS2 causing HNPCC for our computational
analysis.
Evaluation of coding single nucleotide polymorphisms
There are many web-based resources available that allow
one to predict whether nonsynonymous coding SNPs may
have functional effects on proteins. We chose two complementary algorithms for functional impact prediction of
nsSNPs: Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) http://
blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT.html and Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen) http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/
pph/[26,27]. Protein conservation analysis was performed using the SIFT developed by Ng and Henikoff.
SIFT (Sorts Intolerant From Tolerant) version 2.0 was used
to distinction between functional and non-functional
coding mutations and predicts whether an amino acid
substitution in a protein will have a phenotypic effect.
SIFT is based on the premise that protein evolution is correlated with protein function. Variants that occur at conserved alignment positions are expected to be tolerated
less than those that occur at diverse positions. The algorithm uses a modified version of PSIBLAST [28] and
Dirichlet mixture regularization [29] to construct a multiple sequence alignment of proteins that can be globally
aligned to the query sequence and belong to the same
clade. The underlying principle of this program is that it
generates alignments with a large number of homologous
sequences and assigns scores to each residue, ranging
from zero to one. SIFT scores ≤ 0.05 are predicted by the
algorithm to be intolerant or deleterious amino acid substitutions, whereas scores >0.05 are considered tolerant
[30]. Higher the tolerance index of a particular amino acid
substitution, lesser is its likely impact.

PolyPhen is a computational tool for identification of
potentially functional nsSNPs. Predictions are based on a
combination of phylogenetic, structural and sequence
annotation information characterizing a substitution and
its position in the protein. For a given amino acid variation, PolyPhen performs several steps: (a) extraction of
sequence-based features of the substitution site from the
UniProt database, (b) calculation of profile scores for two
amino acid variants, (c) calculation of structural parameters and contacts of a substituted residue. PolyPhen scores
were classified as 'benign', 'possibly damaging', or 'proba-

http://www.jbiomedsci.com/content/16/1/42

bly damaging' [16]. PolyPhen searches for three-dimensional protein structures, multiple alignments of
homologous sequences and amino acid contact information in several protein structure databases. Then, it calculates position-specific independent counts (PSIC) scores
for each of two variants, and computes the difference of
the PSIC scores of the two variants. The higher a PSIC
score difference, the higher functional impact a particular
amino acid substitution is likely to have. A PSIC score difference of 1.5 and above is considered to be damaging.
Analyzing the molecular phenotypic effects of SNPs
PupaSuite are now synchronized to deliver annotations
for both non-coding and coding SNP, as well as annotations for the SwissProt set of human disease mutations. It
is an integrated interface of PupaSNP [31] and PupasView
[32] for selecting SNPs with potential phenotypic effect
accessible via http://pupasuite.bioinfo.cipf.es and
through http://www.pupasnp.org. In this approach, the
input consists of a list of genes (genes belonging to a given
pathway, involved in a particular biological function, etc.)
and the user must specify the type of gene identifiers by
selecting either Ensembl or an external database (which
include GenBank, Swissprot/TrEMBL and other gene ids
supported by Ensembl). PupasView retrieves SNPs that
could affect conserved regions that the cellular machinery
uses for the correct processing of genes (intron/exon
boundaries or exonic splicing enhancers). It uses algorithms like Tango (β-aggregation regions in protein
sequences) and FoldX (stability change caused by the single amino acid variation) to predict the effect of coding
non-synonymous SNPs on several phenotypic properties
such as structure and dynamics, functional sites and cellular processing of human proteins using either sequencebased or structural bioinformatics tools and additional
methods for predicting SNPs in TFBSs and splice sites
[33].
Modeling nsSNP locations on protein structure and their
RMSD difference
Structural analyses were performed based on the crystal
structure of the protein for evaluating the structural stability of native and mutant protein. We used the web
resource SAAPdb [34] and dbSNP to identify the protein
coded by MSH2 and MSH6 gene (PDB ID 2O8C). We also
confirmed the mutation positions and the mutation residues from this server. These mutation positions and residues were in complete agreement with the results
obtained with SIFT and PolyPhen programs. The mutation was performed using SWISSPDB viewer, and energy
minimization for 3D structures was performed using
NOMAD-Ref server [35]. This server use Gromacs as
default force field for energy minimization based on the
methods of steepest descent, conjugate gradient and LBFGS methods [36]. We used the conjugate gradient

method for optimizing the three dimensional structures.
We computed the energy gives the information about the
protein structure stability and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) criteria provide widespread understanding
of deviation at structure level. Deviation between the two
structures was evaluated by their RMSD values.
Analyzing the effects of mutations on protein stability
based on solvent accessibility and secondary structure
analysis
Solvent accessibility is the ratio between the solvent accessible surface area of a residue in a three dimensional structure and in an extended tripeptide conformation. We
obtained the solvent accessibility information using
NetASAView [37]. The entire implementation of ASAView
for all PDB proteins, as a whole or for an individual chain
may be accessed at http://www.netasa.org/asaview/.
Requirements for the use are simply the PDB code or the
coordinate file. Solvent accessibility was divided into
three classes, buried, partially buried and exposed indicating, respectively, low, moderate and high accessibility of
the amino acid residues to the solvent [38,39]. For a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid
sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and
physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is
essential. We obtained the information about secondary
structures of the proteins using the program DSSP [40].
The prediction of solvent accessibility and secondary
structure has been studied as an intermediate step for predicting the tertiary structure of proteins.

Results
SNP dataset
Five genes namely MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS1 and PMS2
with a potential role for the cause of HNPCC were
retrieved from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man. For
our investigations, we selected SNPs in (i) non-synonymous coding regions, (ii) 5' and 3' UTR regions, and (iii)
intronic regions. Out of 1970 SNPs, 125 were non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and 68 SNPs in coding synonymous region. Non-coding region is comprised of 44 SNPs
in UTR and 1733 were in the intronic region.
Predictions of deleterious and damaging coding nsSNPs
Protein conservation analysis was performed using the
SIFT algorithm predicts whether an amino acid substitution may have an impact on protein function by aligning
similar proteins, and calculating a score which is used to
determine the evolutionary conservation status of the
amino acid of interest. One twenty five nsSNPs retrieved
from six genes were submitted independently to the SIFT
program to check its tolerance index. SIFT scores [16] were
classified as intolerant (0.00–0.05), potentially intolerant
(0.051–0.10), borderline (0.101–0.20), or tolerant
(0.201–1.00). The higher the tolerance index, the less

http://www.jbiomedsci.com/content/16/1/42

functional impact a particular amino acid substitution is
likely to have, and vice versa. It can be seen from (Table 1)
that six percent of the nsSNPs exhibit SIFT scores of 0.0,
eleven percent of the variants have scores between 0.01–
0.05 and three percent of the variants have scores between
0.006–0.10 respectively. Thus eighteen percent nsSNPS
are classified as 'intolerant' showed a highly deleterious
tolerance index score of 0.00–0.05 and could affect the
protein function in the HNPCC genes.
The structural levels of alteration were determined by
applying the PolyPhen program. It predicts the functional
effect of amino acid changes by considering evolutionary
conservation, the physiochemical differences, and the
proximity of the substitution to predicted functional
domains and/or structural features. All the 125 nsSNPs
from 5 genes submitted to SIFT were also submitted as
input to the PolyPhen server. Table 1 presents the distribution of the variants by PolyPhen score. Note that the
directionalities of the SIFT and PolyPhen scores are opposite and the SIFT scores are limited to the range of 0.0 to
1.0, while the PolyPhen scores in this dataset ranged from
3.37 to 0.0. PolyPhen scores of >2.0, scores expected to be
"Probably damaging" to protein structure and function
[41], account for thirteen percent of the nsSNPs and nineteen percent of the nsSNPs exhibited PolyPhen scores of
1.99-1.50, scores indicative of variants that are "Possibly
damaging" to protein function. Amino acid variants can
impact the folding, interaction sites, solubility or stability
of proteins. To understand the relationship between
genetic and phenotypic variation, it is essential to assess
the structural consequences of the respective non-synonymous mutations in proteins. To identify how often a disease phenotype can be explained by a destructive effect on
protein structures or functions, we have mapped known
disease mutations onto known three-dimensional structures of proteins based on PolyPhen score. The nsSNPs
with ids namely rs17217723, rs180522 and rs41294982
showed a PSIC score difference ≥ 2.9 at positions Y43C,
H639Q and P670L in MSH2 gene while the nsSNPs with
ids namely rs728619, rs41295270 and rs34374438
showed a PSIC score difference ≥ 2.0 at positions Y538S,
S580L and K854M in MSH6 gene were selected for modeling analysis based on the availability of the 3D structure.
To date, data on the validity of these algorithms has come
from benchmarking studies based on the analysis of
"known" deleterious substitutions annotated in databases, such as Swiss-Prot, shown to successfully predict
the effect of over 80% of amino acid substitutions [16,4143]. Experimental studies of individual proteins have also
confirmed the accuracy of SIFT and PolyPhen [16,44].
Hence, we could infer that the results obtained by the evolutionary-based approach (SIFT) correlated well with the
results
obtained
by
structural-based
approach
(PolyPhen), as can be seen from (Table 1). The nsSNPs

which were predicted to be deleterious in causing an effect
in the structure and function of the protein by SIFT and
PolyPhen correlated well experimental studies [45-61] as
shown in (Table 1).
Predictions of potential phenotypic effect in SNPs
The effect of non-synonymous coding SNPs can be analyzed by means of the physico-chemical properties of the
affected proteins. PupaSuite tries to pinpoint the exact
effect of a mutation to a specific structural or physicochemical property, ranging from protein aggregation to
the disruption of protein-protein interactions, or from
changes in protein turnover rate to sub-cellular (mis)
localisation. In-silico methods provide a useful tool for an
initial approach to any mutation suspected of causing
aberrant RNA processing. These mutations can result
either in complete skipping of the exon, retention of the
intron or in the introduction of a new splice site within an
exon or intron. In rare cases, mutations that do not disrupt or create a splice site, activate preexisting pseudo
splice sites consistent with the proposal that introns contain splicing inhibitory sequences [62]. Nonsense and
missense mutations can disrupt exonic splicing enhancers
(ESEs) and cause the splicing machinery to skip the
mutant exon, with dramatic effects on the structure of the
gene product [63]. ESEs are common in alternative and
constitutive exons, where they act as binding sites for Ser/
Arg-rich proteins (SR proteins), a family of conserved
splicing factors that participate in multiple steps of the
splicing pathway [64]. Out of 54 SNPs reported in (Table
2), 45 nsSNPs disrupted the exonic splicing enhancers, 3
nsSNPs disrupted the exonic splicing silencers, 3 SNPs in
mRNA disrupted the exonic splicing silencers, 1 SNP in
mRNA disrupted the exonic splicing enhancers and 1 SNP
in intron region involved in intron/exon junctions. Evidence in support of varied levels of alternative splicing is
available for some Lynch syndrome related mutations
[65,66]. It is a noteworthy finding in our computational
approach that 19 nsSNPs with ids namely (rs11541859,
rs35045067, rs17217723, rs33946261, rs4987188,

enhancers were also found to be damaging by SIFT and
PolyPhen analysis. Our methodology can be used to prioritize SNPs that might play important role for large epidemiologic studies and genetic analysis.
Modeling and analysis of mutant structure
Single amino acid mutations can significantly change the
stability of a protein structure. So, the knowledge of a protein's three-dimensional (3D) structure is essential for a
full understanding of its functionality. Mapping the deleterious nsSNPs into protein structure information was
obtained from dbSNP and SAAPdb. The available structure for the MSH2 and MSH6 gene is reported to have a
PDB ID (2O8C). Mutation analysis was performed based
on the results obtained from highest PolyPhen scores. The
mutations for 2O8C at their corresponding positions were
performed by SWISS-PDB viewer independently to
achieve modeled structures. Then, energy minimizations
were performed by NOMAD-Ref server for the native type
protein 2O8C and the mutant type structures. It can be
inferred from (Table 1) that nsSNPs in MSH2 gene with
ids namely rs17217723, rs180522 and rs41294982
showed the highest PolyPhen scores 2.970, 3.352 and
3.379 respectively. According to this, the mutation
occurred for native protein in the 'A' chain of PDB ID
2O8C at position Y43C with an SNP ID (rs17217723),
H639Q with an SNP ID (rs180522) and P670L with an
SNP ID (rs41294982) based on PolyPhen results. It can be
seen that the total energy for mutant type structure Y43C,
H639Q and P670L were found to be -53305.15, 53377.01, -53405.59 Kcal/mol respectively. The RMSD
values between the native type (2O8C) and the mutant
Y43C is 4.30 Å, between native type and the mutant
H639Q is 3.93 Å and between native type and the mutant
P670L is 3.65 Å. The total energy and RMSD value of
mutant structure Y43C is high when compared to the
other mutants H639Q and P670L respectively. Similarly,
for MSH6 gene based on the PolyPhen scores, mutation

analysis was performed in nsSNPs with IDs namely
rs728619, rs41295270 and rs34374438 respectively.
According to this, the mutation occurred for native protein in the 'B' chain of PDB ID 2O8C at position Y538S
with an SNP ID (rs728619), S580L with an SNP ID
(rs41295270) and K854M with an SNP ID (rs34374438).
It can be seen that the total energy for mutant type structure Y538S, S580L and K854M were found to be 58509.39, -58513.55, -58506.94 Kcal/mol respectively.
The RMSD values between the native type (2O8C) and the
mutant Y538S is 3.52 Å, between native type and the

side chains have higher solvent accessibility than nonpolar side chains, suggesting that formation of a hydrophobic core is a strong driving force in protein folding
[67]. The prediction of residue solvent accessibility can
help in better understanding the relationship between

Ala(727), Ser(738), Glu(786), Leu(811), Val(817) and
Ala(843) showed a change in solvent accessibility from an
exposed to buried state in the mutant protein Y43C. It is
interesting to note that mutant position Y43C, itself
changed the solvent accessibility from exposed to buried
state. The mutant amino acid cysteine is hydrophobic in
nature. Most of the information in the solvent-accessibility features comes from the fact that buried residue positions are most likely to be adversely effected by aminoacid substitutions, due to loss of structural stability
[[68,69], and [41]]. Many studies have suggested that
hydrophobic core residues are likely sites of deleterious
mutations. Hence, change in solvent accessibility from an
exposed to buried state could be considered functionally
significant in the mutant protein at structural level [21].
The occurrence of weak interactions has been observed at
the terminus of the secondary structural units, in particular a-helix and β-sheets [70,71]. These interactions play a
definitive role in stabilizing these structures of proteins.
The propensity of the amino acid residues to favor a particular conformation has been well documented. Such
conformational preference is not dependent on the amino
acid alone but is also dependent on the local amino acid
sequence. We analyzed the secondary structure of each
amino acid residue in the native and mutant structures of
the protein. We found that the residues namely Asp(133),
Ile (134), Leu(135), Arg(219), Gly(219), Ile(237),
Tyr(238), Gln(252), Met(253), Asn (254), Ser(255),

(642), Glu(643), Arg(737), Ser(738) and Glu(853)
changed their conformation from turn in the native protein to helix conformation in the mutant protein,

Leu(432), Leu(433), Ala(434), Val(435) and Phe(436)
changed from bend to helix, Ile(304), Leu(330), Thr(457)
and Thr(772) changed from helix to turn and Leu(279),
Leu(280), Ser(281), His(785), Glu(786), Leu(787),
Thr(788) changed their conformation from bend to turn
in the mutant protein. The results of solvent accessibility
and secondary structure analysis for the rest of the mutations H639Q and P670L of MSH2 gene and Y538S, S580L
and K854M of MSH6 gene are provided in Additional file
1. Therefore, understanding the functional consequences
of non-synonymous changes and predicting the potential
causes and the molecular basis of diseases involves integration of information from multiple heterogeneous
sources including sequences, structure data, solvent accessibility and secondary structure analysis.

Discussion
A major interest in human genetics is to distinguish mutations that are functionally neutral from those that contribute to disease. Amino acid substitutions currently account
for approximately half of the known gene lesions responsible for human inherited disease [72]. Therefore, the
identification of nsSNPs that affect protein functions and
relate to disease is an important task. The effect of many
nsSNPs will probably be neutral as natural selection will
have removed mutations on essential positions. Assessment of non-neutral SNPs is mainly based on phylogenetic information (i.e. correlation with residue
conservation) extended to a certain degree with structural
approaches (PolyPhen). However, there is increasing evidence that many human disease genes are the result of
exonic or noncoding mutations affecting regulatory
regions [73,74]. Much attention has been focused on
modeling by different methods the possible phenotypic
effect of SNPs that cause amino acid changes, and only
recently has interest focused on functional SNPs affecting
regulatory regions or the splicing process. Moreover,
because of their widespread distribution on the species
genome, SNPs become particularly important and valuable as genetic makers in the research for the diseases and
corresponding drug. Currently, millions of human SNPs
have reported by high-throughput methods. The vast
number of SNPs causes a challenge for biologists and bioinformaticians although they provide lot information
about the relationships between individuals. Besides
numerous ongoing efforts to identify millions of these
SNPs, there is now also a focus on studying associations
between disease risk and these genetic variations using a
molecular epidemiological approach. This plethora of
SNPs points out a major difficulty faced by scientists in
planning costly population-based genotyping, which is to
choose target SNPs that are most likely to affect phenotypic functions and ultimately contribute to disease development.

Currently, most molecular studies are focusing on SNPs
located in coding and regulatory regions, yet many of
these studies have been unable to detect significant associations between SNPs and disease susceptibility. To
develop a coherent approach for prioritizing SNP selection for genotyping in molecular studies, we applied an
evolutionary perspective to SNP screening. We correlated
findings from molecular studies of cancer with the evolutionary conservation levels of non-synonymous SNPs
using a sequence homology-based tool. Our hypothesis
was that, amino acids conserved across species are more
likely to be functionally significant. Therefore, SNPs that
change these amino acids might be more likely to be associated with cancer susceptibility. It is becoming clear that
application of the molecular evolutionary approach may
be a powerful tool for prioritizing SNPs to be genotyped
in future molecular epidemiological studies. Therefore,
our analysis will provide useful information in selecting
SNPs that are likely to have potential functional impact
and ultimately contribute to an individual's cancer susceptibility.
Out of 1970 SNPs, 125 were non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) of the HNPCC genes were submitted to the SIFT and
PolyPhen algorithms. Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant
(SIFT) classified 22 of 125 variants (18%) as "Intolerant."
Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen) classed 40 of
125 amino acid substitutions (32%) as "probably or possibly damaging". 49 nsSNPs, 3 SNPs in mRNA and a SNP
in intron region showed molecular phenotypic variation
by PupaSuite. Based on the PolyPhen scores and availability of 3D structures, structure analysis was carried out with
the major mutation that occurred in the native protein
coded by MSH2 and MSH6 genes. The total energy and
RMSD value of mutant structure Y43C is high when compared to the other mutants H639Q and P670L in MSH2
gene, while all the three mutants Y538S, S580L and
K854M in MSH6 showed almost same total energy and
RMSD. Based on the SIFT, PolyPhen, total energy and
RMSD values of the mutant proteins, solvent accessibility
and secondary structure of all the residues in the native
protein and mutant protein Y43C, H639Q and P670L of
MSH2 gene and Y538S, S580L and K854M of MSH6 gene
were computed with NetASA. Solvent accessibilities and
secondary structures of amino acid residues give a useful
insight into the structure and function of a protein. Based
on this approach, we have shown that four nsSNPs, which
were predicted to have functional consequences (MSH2Y43C, MSH6- Y538S, MSH6- S580L, and MSH6- K854M),
were already found to be associated with cancer risk.

http://www.jbiomedsci.com/content/16/1/42

approach might also be applied to a relationship between
SNP conservation levels and epidemiological studies of
diseases other than cancer. More importantly, this study
builds a bridge from evolutionary biology to molecular
epidemiology, which may further our understanding of
disease-related SNPs and ultimately facilitate SNP genotyping in future studies. In summary, we have systematically and comprehensively evaluated structure and
sequence-based computational prediction methods
applied to variants in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and
PMS1 genes and provided detailed structural explanations
for the measured and predicted impact of MSH2 and
MSH6 variants. The data presented here show that this
novel bioinformatics approach to classifying cancer-associated variants is robust and can be used for large-scale
analyses. Our approach will present the application of
computational tools in understanding functional variation from the perspective of structure, expression, evolution and Phenotype. The existing in silico methods that we
used can also be adapted by any investigator to a priori
SNP selection or post hoc evaluation of variants identified
in whole-genome scans. The best-supervised learning
algorithms are in greater agreement with experimental
results than has been reported previously.
