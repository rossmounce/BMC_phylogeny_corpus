Abstract
Background: Genome size and gene content in bacteria are associated with their lifestyles.
Obligate intracellular bacteria (i.e., mutualists and parasites) have small genomes that derived from
larger free-living bacterial ancestors; however, the different steps of bacterial specialization from
free-living to intracellular lifestyle have not been studied comprehensively. The growing number of
available sequenced genomes makes it possible to perform a statistical comparative analysis of 317
genomes from bacteria with different lifestyles.
Results: Compared to free-living bacteria, host-dependent bacteria exhibit fewer rRNA genes,
more split rRNA operons and fewer transcriptional regulators, linked to slower growth rates. We
found a function-dependent and non-random loss of the same 100 orthologous genes in all obligate
intracellular bacteria. Thus, we showed that obligate intracellular bacteria from different phyla are
converging according to their lifestyle. Their specialization is an irreversible phenomenon
characterized by translation modification and massive gene loss, including the loss of transcriptional
regulators. Although both mutualists and parasites converge by genome reduction, these obligate
intracellular bacteria have lost distinct sets of genes in the context of their specific host
associations: mutualists have significantly more genes that enable nutrient provisioning whereas
parasites have genes that encode Types II, IV, and VI secretion pathways.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that gene loss, rather than acquisition of virulence factors, has
been a driving force in the adaptation of parasites to eukaryotic cells. This comparative genomic
analysis helps to explore the strategies by which obligate intracellular genomes specialize to
particular host-associations and contributes to advance our knowledge about the mechanisms of
bacterial evolution.

Background
Genome size in bacteria is extremely variable, ranging
from 0.16 megabases (Mb) in Carsonella ruddii [1] to
approximately 10 Mb in Burkholderia xenovorans [2].
Genome size and gene repertoire can increase through
gene acquisition, i.e. DNA transfer and gene duplication,
and conversely, decrease by deletion [3,4]. Genome analyses of obligate intracellular, including mutualistic and
parasitic organisms, showed that these bacteria have small
genomes that are derived from larger free-living bacterial
ancestors [5-8]. This reductive evolution has been associated with metabolic parasitism or mutualism, during
adaptation to an intracellular habitat [7,9,10]. The analysis of gene contents of fully sequenced genomes provided
insights into the relationship between the ecology and
genome evolution of studied bacteria [11-13]. The growing number of available bacterial genomes makes it possible to perform a comparative genomic analysis of 317
genomes from bacteria with different lifestyles. Bacteria
were classified according to their lifestyle as host-dependent (125 bacteria) and free-living (192 bacteria). Among
host-dependent bacteria, 85 were identified as facultative
host-associated (extracellular or intracellular), and 40
bacteria (27 parasites and 13 mutualists) that are specialized to an obligate intracellular lifestyle (Figure 1 and
Additional file 1) [14,15]. We determined the phylogenetic profile of all studied bacteria with respect to their
orthologous genes content (COGs). We compared the
317 genomes with respect to their genome size, G+C content, ribosomal RNA operons (rRNA), and orthologous
gene composition. We identified genomic features typical
of each way of life, highlighting the significant differences
in the genomic repertoires between obligate intracellular
and free-living bacteria, as well as differences between
mutualistic and parasitic bacteria. Our comparative analysis sheds light on the process of evolution from the larger
genomes of ancestral species to the specialized smaller
genomes of obligate intracellular bacteria, and reveals the
genetic basis of their specialization to an intracellular lifestyle. We demonstrate that there is a convergent evolution
of obligate intracellular bacteria from different phyla.

Results and discussion
Genomic features and lifestyle
Host-dependent bacteria typically have a smaller genome
size and fewer genes compared to their close relatives in
the same phylum (Additional file 2). Linear regression
analysis showed strong positive correlations between
genome size and GC content (R2 = 0.376, F1,315 = 190, p <
10-6) and between genome size and gene number (R2 =
0.976, F1,315 = 12900, p < 10-6). Indeed, the trend towards
genome reduction holds true for all host-dependent bacteria and the maximum reduction has been noted for the
obligate intracellular bacteria (unpaired Student's t-test,
all p < 10-2, Figure 2). The AT mutational bias may be

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/13

explained by the impairment of the reparation system
[16,17] or by metabolic reasons [18,19]. Genome size,
number of genes and GC content of bacteria diminish
during the specialization to an intracellular lifestyle, indicating a continual selective pressure for a minimal
genome [20]. One explanation is the intracellular habitat
that limits the capacity for gene acquisition by lateral gene
transfer (LGT) [13,21-23]. Other reasons include gene
loss with increased adaptation to the host [10,24]. Once
restricted to the intracellular environment, the opportunities for LGT are diminished, so the likelihood of reversal
is low, and the possibility of ever acquiring the functions
needed to live in a less specialized environment successfully (i.e. in competition with better equipped organisms)
is small. Indeed, the balance between acquired and lost
genes is in favour of genome reduction and irreversible
massive gene decay implies that specialization to an intracellular lifestyle is a one-way road.
Gene repertoire and lifestyle
Using the Reverse PSI-Blast program [25], we were able to
assign, on average, 71.03 ± 7.73% of the ORFs (Open
Reading Frame) in any genome to a COG functional category. Thus we have characterized the large majority of the
repertoire of each bacterium, knowing that  15 to 20% of
the predicted genes in every genome sequenced so far, is
species-specific [26]. The principal coordinate (PCO)
analysis of COG content distances, calculated on the basis
of the presence or absence of a COG, showed that bacteria
from the same lifestyle tend to be clustered together (multivariate analysis variance, p < 10-6, Figure 3) [27-31]. The
difference in genome contents reflects a differential gene
loss, with a greater extent of loss in obligate intracellular
bacteria. To identify function repertoires related to each
lifestyle, we compared the number of genes assigned to
each COG in the host-dependent genomes with that in
free-living bacteria. Genes involved in DNA replication,
recombination and repair, RNA processing and modification, translation, post-translational modification, and
intracellular trafficking and secretion significantly
increased their representation in all the host-dependent
compared to free-living bacteria. In contrast, genes
belonging to the functional categories of transcription,
defence mechanisms, transport and metabolism of amino
acids, inorganic ions, and secondary metabolites significantly decreased in their percentage of genome representation (paired Student's t-test, p < 10-2, Table 1). Bacteria
display different functional gene inventories, with functions specific to their ecological niche.

Based upon the assumption that COGs conserved in the
reduced genomes of host-dependent bacteria from different phyla are likely to be essential and therefore result
from a vertical transmission, we searched for the essential
COGs. We found that only 35 COGs were conserved in all

Proposed scenario for genome evolution and specialization
Proposed scenario for genome evolution and specialization. Model of evolution involving 3 steps en route to specialization to an intracellular lifestyle. The different steps correspond to the different levels of dependency to eukaryotic cells, the
minimum is for the free-living bacteria and the maximum is for obligate intracellular bacteria. Each Step corresponds to a bacterial community sharing common habitat and relationship with eukaryotic cells. Bacterial specialization to an intracellular lifestyle is characterized by gene loss including transcriptional regulators and rRNA operons. Free-living promiscuous bacteria
have large genomes because of a high level of gene importation. They also have a large number of rRNA operons. Obligate
intracellular bacteria have reduced genomes with few rRNA operons and transcription regulators. When bacterial lineages
make the transition from free-living to permanent associations with hosts, they undergo a major loss of genes. Restriction to
an intracellular environment limits the opportunity to acquire foreign genes from other bacteria therefore the balance between
acquired and lost genes in specialized bacteria is in favour of genome reduction. Irreversible massive gene decay implies that
specialization to an intracellular lifestyle is a one-way road. Differential gene loss is noted in mutualistic and parasitic bacterial
groups. Data in circles represent the mean (± s.d.) of genome size in megabases (GS), GC content (GC), rRNA operon (Op),
and number of genes assigned to transcriptional regulation (TR) in each bacterial community. Numbers on the arrows represent the average number of lost genes ± the standard error in order to compute confidence intervals for the estimated loss
ratio (proportion of genes lost with respect to the whole number of genes present at least in one bacterium).

classes. 1 represents Treponema pallidum; 2 represents Mycobacterium leprae; 3 represents Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila UWE25; 4 represents Coxiella burnetii. These species with larger genome sizes and gene contents than the other obligate intracellular bacteria undergo reductive evolution [28,30]. Some of these bacteria have high number of pseudogenes
[27,29,31]. The presence of pseudogenes displays an ongoing process of gene degradation.

317 bacteria. The size of the essential COGs set could be
underestimated due to the small genome size of Carsonella
ruddii (160 Kb). Indeed, 100 COGs were found conserved
in 99% of the bacteria (Table 2). These genes are likely to
be essential and are good candidates for inclusion in the
minimal gene set. Like other minimal gene sets [32-37],
this set consisted mainly of genes encoding for the DNA
replication and translation system components, genes
that preserve the integrity of their product, such as genes
encoding proteins involved in DNA repair, protein degradation and proofreading, chaperone-like proteins, and a
few basal components of the transcription system (Table
3, Chi-squared test for independence 2 = 485.5, df = 3, p
< 10-6). Altogether, the essential genes that are conserved
in all genomes become proportionally more important in
small reduced genomes than in large genomes.

Convergent reductive evolution of obligate intracellular
bacteria
When considering the presence or absence of a COG, we
found that facultative host-associated bacteria have 264
COGs less than the free-living bacteria and 615 COGs
more than the obligate intracellular bacteria. The differences observed between the different bacterial communities correspond to the COGs lost in relation with the level
of host-dependency (mean loss ratio ± sd: 6 ± 11% and 16
± 17%, Figure 2). Thus, on the first level of dependency
(i.e., facultative host-associated lifestyle) bacteria have
already lost 264 COGs. To achieve the second level of
host-dependency (i.e., obligate intracellular lifestyle) bacteria undergo an additional loss of 615 COGs significantly
greater than the previous loss (unpaired Student's t-test, p
< 10-6). Moreover, the number of genes assigned to each

COG category decreased in each step of specialization to
an intracellular lifestyle (Figure 4). However, we suspected that gene loss was not random and resulted from a
converging evolutionary process. To test this hypothesis,
we developed a new statistical approach (Details in methods). We considered the most parsimonious hypothesis,
suggesting that consistent gene presence in the free-living
bacteria in a phylum indicates that the corresponding
gene was probably present in the ancestor of that phylum,
whereas the occasional absence of a gene in obligate intracellular bacteria might result from gene loss. Also, we con-

sidered the repetition of gene loss across distantly related
intracellular species in comparison with their close relative free-living bacteria indicative of convergent evolution.
By comparing obligate intracellular to their phylogenetically close free-living relatives, in the same phylum, we
identified a set of 100 COGs lost in concert by obligate
intracellular bacteria from all phyla (Additional files 3
and 4, Table 4). The number of COGs lost in concert was
significantly more important than expected (mean loss
ratio ± s.e.m = 0.062 ± 7.8 × 10-3 %) if the loss were random (Randomization test, n = 2000, p < 10-6) (Additional

file 5). The set of 100 COGs lost in concert among the
obligate intracellular bacteria, mainly encoded metabolism (41%) and cellular process (35%) proteins (Table 3),
showing that gene loss is function-dependent (Chisquared test for independence 2 = 36.4, degrees of freedom df = 3, p < 10-6). The obligate intracellular bacteria
from different phyla did not lose COGs independently
(Binomial distribution, p < 10-6) (Additional file 6).
Thereby, using statistical tests, we demonstrated that there
is a causal link between specialization and gene loss. The
common loss of the same genes in obligate intracellular
bacteria from different phyla reflects the convergent evolution of these specialized bacteria in relation to their lifestyle (Figure 1).

Correlation between transcription, translation and growth
rate
The DNA encoding ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) genes of bacteria are typically organized in operons with the general
structure 16S-23S-5S, transfer RNA (tRNA) genes are often
found in the spacer between the 16S and the 23S rRNA
genes [38]. Host-dependent bacteria have fewer copies of
each rRNA gene than free-living and significantly lower
copy number of typical rRNA operon (2.52 ± 2.53 vs. 4.91
± 2.98 copies, p < 10-6). This difference in the number of
typical rRNA operons between host-dependent and freeliving bacteria remained significant when adjusted for
genome size (1.07 ± 1.06 vs. 1.46 ± 0.97 operons/Mb, p =
0.001). Atypical operons, where the general structure 16S23S-5S is disrupted by protein-coding genes, were found
significantly more frequently in host-dependent than in
free-living bacteria (38 vs. 5, Chi-squared test for indePage 8 of 25

pendence 2 = 49.9, df = 1, p < 10-6, these bacteria are listed
in Additional file 1). Our data show that different independent clades of host-dependent bacteria contain few
copies of ribosomal RNA genes which do not form an
operon (Figure 1). The split in rRNA operon is a key evolutionary factor for obligate intracellular bacteria from the
order Rickettsiales [39,40]. It has been suggested that
recombination between gene repeats might have led to
both gene loss and genome shuffling in Rickettsia and Wolbachia spp. [41,42]. The split in rRNA operon helps to elucidate one of the mechanisms of specialized intracellular
genomes evolution.
When counting the number of genes involved in transcription, host-dependent bacteria were found to have significantly fewer transcriptional regulators. This decrease is
pronounced in obligate intracellular bacteria (6.98 ±
12.32 genes/Mb) compared to facultative host-associated
(19.07 ± 11.49 genes/Mb, p < 10-6) and to free-living bacteria (28.69 ± 11.18 genes/Mb, p < 10-6). The ratio of
genes involved in transcriptional regulation over the total
number of genes involved in transcription in free-living
(66.3 ± 10.7%) is significantly greater than that of
facultative host-associated (52.46 ± 17.5%) and than that
of obligate intracellular bacteria (26.11 ± 14.8%)
(unpaired Student's t-test, both p < 10-6). These genomic

features dealing with transcription and translation (the
rRNA apparatus) may have an implication in a phenotypic criterion such as growth time. When compared to
free-living bacteria, obligate intracellular bacteria have
lower copy numbers of the rRNA genes, increased rearranged rRNA operon structures, and fewer transcriptional
regulators, and a tendency of slow growth (Figure 5).
Moreover, we found a significant negative correlation
between growth time on one side and the number of
rRNA operons and transcriptional regulators per Mb on
the other side (F2,284 = 93.7; adjusted R2 = 0.393; p < 10-6,
Additional file 1). These findings are all correlated with
the obligate intracellular bacterial lifestyle and make sense
with respect to the physical constraints of that lifestyle.
Free-living bacteria exhibit larger genomes, more lateral
gene transfer [13], and more rRNA operons. They have
great capabilities to adapt to different environmental surroundings, like soil and water. A high copy number of
rRNA may be necessary to tolerate increased gene content
and larger genome size. The occurrence of multiple typical
operons may be important in the ability of bacteria to
respond to changing growth conditions [43]. Moreover,
the versatile environments of free-living organisms
require greater regulatory potential than do the relatively
stable niches of obligate intracellular bacteria [4,44]. Specialization is correlated with a lower possibility of gene

exchanges with other bacteria [13] add to this a more constant environment that may explain the lack of positive
selection for both rRNA operon copies and transcriptional
regulators [24]. Finally, the decrease of host-dependent
bacteria's growth rate may be critical to synchronize with
that of their host cells in order to avoid detrimental virulence (cell lysis).
Divergence of parasites and mutualists
Among obligate intracellular bacteria, we observed differences between the genomic repertoires of mutualists and
parasites that seem to reflect the nature of the relationship
these organisms have with their host-cells (beneficial and
harmful, respectively). Mutualists have smaller genomes
than parasites (0.72 ± 0.27 vs. 1.39 ± 0.49 Mb, Wilcoxon
rank sum test, p < 10-6) and they have significantly less
genes in almost all COGs categories. Nevertheless, the
genome content difference between mutualists and parasites is not significant for genes involved in amino acid

transport and metabolism (40.62 ± 21.21 vs. 39.19 ±
20.38), nucleotide transport and metabolism (25.38 ±
11.30 vs. 27.33 ± 10.20), cell motility (8.85 ± 12.66 vs.
7.93 ± 9.59), and cell cycle control, cell division, and
chromosome partition (9.38 ± 5.09 vs. 12.07 ± 5.59).
These findings show that despite genome reduction,
mutualists have retained genes involved in the transport
and metabolism of amino acid and nucleotide, genes for
cell motility and cell cycle control. Moreover, 8.76% of
the genome vs. only 5.18% (paired Student's t-test, p < 104) is occupied by genes for amino acid transport and
metabolism (Figure 6). Parasitic reduced genomes have
eliminated genes underlying biosynthesis of amino acids
that can be obtained from the host cytoplasm [45],
whereas mutualistic genomes have retained genes for the
biosynthesis of amino acids required by their hosts [46].
Likewise, mutualists devote a higher fraction of their
genomes than parasites for genes involved in nucleotide
transport and metabolism (4.7% vs. 3.77%) and genes for

requires passage outside the host cell to allow horizontal
transmission [47]. Parasites exhibit a very specialized repertoire of secretory pathway genes, type II, IV, and VI (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p < 0.05, Additional file 7), enabling
them to modulate the host environment by secreted effector molecules [48]. This divergence between parasites' and
mutualists' genomes is striking because intracellular parasites have been previously considered as a possible intermediate step to a mutualist lifestyle, en route to the
extreme situation of becoming organelles (mitochondria
and chloroplasts). Our comparative genomics of parasites
and mutualists point out to general similarities and distinctions in the evolution of bacteria specialized to intracellular lifestyle. Obligate intracellular genomes have
undergone a reductive evolution, however they have
evolved different strategies for bacteria-host interactions
and they have lost and conserved genes accordingly [49].
Finally, transitions between parasitism and mutualism
might be restricted, owing to the irreversible loss of genes
and the associated functional capabilities.

Conclusion
Based on the comparative genomics of a large number of
bacterial genomes, we postulate that bacterial specialization is a one-way irreversible and converging journey

causing massive gene loss. New specialists are constantly
provided by free-living bacterial community reservoir. In
contrast to what was initially hypothesized, the evolution
of pathogenic bacteria, that are specialized bacteria of particular interest to humans [50], consists mainly of gene
losses [10,51,52]. This general evolution strategy was
recently confirmed for Rickettsia species (unpublished
data), Mycobacterium tuberculosis [53,54] and Mycobacterium ulcerans [55]; free-living bacteria having more genes
named virulence factors than do pathogenic bacteria [13].
It is noteworthy that virulence factors, like genes encoding
for the ATP/ADP translocases have been identified in
Chlamydiae and Rickettsiae [56,57]. The presence of these
transport systems in obligate intracellular parasites'
genomes helps to exploit the host's ATP [9]. It has been
suggested that these transport systems have been transferred horizontally to obligate intracellular bacteria during their specialization to an intracellular parasitic
lifestyle [58]. Lateral gene transfer seems to be a very rare
event in the evolution of intracellular bacteria, comparing
to the gene loss events [13]. Increase in virulence may,
therefore, be related to the loss of regulation rather than
to gene acquisition [52].

Methods
Genome data
A total of 317 bacterial genomes were obtained from the
NCBI website ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/
Bacteria/ together with their genome size, GC content,
and the number of genes. We classified bacterial species
on the basis of their ecological diversity: host-dependent
bacteria living in association with eukaryotic cells and
free-living bacteria living in soil, water, or in the air, independently of a eukaryotic cell according to the information given in literature. Host-dependent bacteria were
divided into two subgroups: facultative host-associated
and obligate intracellular. Obligate intracellular bacteria
were classified as mutualists or parasites, depending on
the effect of the association on the fitness of the host: positive or negative, respectively (The entire list of studied
bacteria along with their genome features can be found in
Additional file 1). In this paper, the term "specialists"
refers to obligate intracellular bacteria specialized to an
intracellular lifestyle.

Identification of orthologs
We retrieved protein sequence data for bacterial genomes
from the KEGG database [59]ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/
kegg/genes/fasta/ and COG data from NCBI [60,61]http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/index.html. In the COG
database, individual COGs are clustered into 23 functional categories, which are further grouped into four
major classes: information storage and processing, cellular processes and signaling, metabolism and poorly characterized. Each set of all predicted proteins was compared
to the COG profile database using the Reverse PSI-Blast
program [25]. A significance score was determined for
each COG so that any sequence not used to build the
COG profile scored below this score. ORFs were assigned
to a functional category according to the category where
their best COG homolog is classified.

In the COG database constructed herein, the presence or
absence of a COG in a given organism was noted as 1 or
0, respectively [62]. On the basis of this matrix [0,1] we

Biology Direct 2009, 4:13

performed a principal coordinate (PCO) analysis to suggest relationships between genomes [63]. For that we used
the resulting pattern of 1's and 0's for the presence or
absence of a COG to construct the matrix for Euclidean
distances between pairs of points. Then we performed a
projection to get a 2-dimensional visualization.
We determined the mean number of genes assigned to
each COGs for each bacterial lifestyle. We compared the
mean number of genes assigned to each COG function
between free-living bacteria (125 organisms) and all hostdependent bacteria (125 organisms), then between freeliving and obligate intracellular bacteria (40 organisms),
and between mutualists (13 organisms) and parasites (27
organisms). All data were analyzed with the R statistical
software package http://cran.r-project.org/[64] using the
Student's t-test (either paired or unpaired) for sample
sizes of 30 or more per group and Wilcoxon signed rank
test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for small samples (paired
or independent samples, respectively). All tests were twotailed, and p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
Determination of lost COGs
We used the alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria species as
a model system for our comparative studies because the
variation of the genome size in these subdivision spans
the entire size range for bacteria from 0.86 Mb in Neorickettsia sennetsu to 5.51 Mb in Rhodopseudomonas palustris
and 0.16 Mb for Carsonella ruddii to 7.22 Mb in Hahella
chejuensis. Furthermore, there is a large variation in lifestyles in these subdivisions, including obligate intracellular (Rickettsia and Wolbachia; Coxiella and Buchnera),
facultative host-associated (Bartonella and Brucella,
Legionella, Haemophilus) and free-living (Zymonas mobilis
and Pseudomonas sp.) bacteria, which enables correlations
between gene content and lifestyle features to be examined. We looked for significantly lost COGs: as the mean
number of genes in free-living bacteria is three times that
of obligate intracellular bacteria, we looked for COGs
present in more than 75% of free-living bacteria, but fewer
than 25% of obligate intracellular bacteria in alpha- and
gamma-proteobacterial phyla (Additional file 3). We further searched for these COGs (presence or absence)
within the genomes of other obligate intracellular bacteria
belonging to distinct phyla. The 100 COGs lost in concert
among the obligate intracellular bacteria from all phyla
constitute the core of lost COGs.
Gene function and evolutionary relatedness
Under the null hypothesis that loss or conservation of
COGs is due to chance, independently of their function,
the classification of the COGs lost in concert into the different functional categories should be the same as that of
all COGs present in bacteria. We compared the functional
classifications of both lost and conserved COGs, to that of

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/13

all COGs which are present in at least one bacterium,
using Chi-squared test for independence 2. We also
looked for functions that are significantly more lost or
conserved, than expected.
Test of convergent evolution
We evaluated the probability that a COG is in the core of
lost COGs given that it has been lost at least by mutualists
or parasites from alpha- or gamma-proteobacteria (Additional file 4). We used a randomization test to see if the
observed numbers of losses in common can be attributed
to random chance (Additional file 5). For that, we have
simulated 2000 random losses for mutualists and parasites from alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria, among the
COGs present at least in one of these bacteria. Then we
counted the number of COGs lost in common and computed the proportion that it represents from the set of
COGs lost by at least one bacterium. We summarized the
2000 simulated proportions in a histogram, where we add
the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles. Under random loss
assumption, common loss proportions should not exceed
these interval bounds.

Furthermore, under the null hypothesis that all observed
convergent losses can be explained by random chance, the
common loss probability p1 (0.0259) should be equal to
the product

p 0 = rαMutualists × rαParasites × rγMutualists × rγParasites
Where r = probability that the COG is lost by bacteria of
the group  given that it is at least present in free-livings
from  – or -proteobacteria (set of N = 3865 COGs).
We computed the theoretical probability p0 for any COG
to be in the set of COGs lost in concert and we used the
binomial distribution B (N, p) to compute the probability
of observing, under the hypothesis of independent phyla,
at least as many convergent losses. The random variable
counting COGs lost in concert among the N COGs, under
the hypothesis of independent phyla, has a Binomial distribution B (N, p0). We computed P (X  100), that indicates whether independence hypothesis is likely or not.
Although, the real theoretical probability p0 is not given
yet it can be estimated from loss proportion in each phylum. Moreover we know the behaviour of P(X  100) with
respect to probability p0. It increases with p0 and reaches
the critical probability 0.05 when p0 becomes greater than
0.0218 (Additional file 6). Consequently, if probability p0
is contained, with sufficiently confidence, in an interval
with upper bound less than 0.0218, then convergence is
proved. Hence we use observed losses counts to give a
confidence interval for each phylum loss probability,
from which we deduced a confidence interval for the

Page 15 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:13

unknown probability p0. Results are given using the 95%confidence interval of p0.
Ribosomal DNA database
We created a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA
(tRNA) database using BLASTn (e-value threshold of 10-4)
for the 16S, 23S, 5S rRNA, and tRNA gene sequences from
NCBI Genbank against the complete genome sequences
of studied bacteria. For each ribosomal operon, the basepair coordinates corresponding to the 3' terminus of the
16S rRNA and the 5' start of the 23S rRNA gene were
entered into the sequence retrieval function on the created
database and used to extract the Internal Transcribed
Spacer (ITS) sequence. We determined the number and
organization of rRNA operons, the ITS length, and the
number of tRNAs (Additional file 1).
Transcription, intracellular trafficking and secretory
pathways
We counted the number of genes for the COGs involved
in basal transcription (90 COGs) and transcriptional regulators (111 COGs) in all studied bacteria (Additional file
8). We determined the ratio of transcriptional regulators,
i.e., the proportion of genes that have a function as transcriptional regulators, over the total of genes involved in
transcription. We compared the number of genes involved
in transcriptional regulation and the ratio of transcriptional regulators between obligate intracellular, facultative host-associated and free-living bacteria using
unpaired Student's t-test. We counted the number of
genes assigned to the intracellular trafficking and secretory
pathways (Type II, III, IV, V and VI) in all obligate intracellular bacteria (104 COGs including a list of COGs that
are involved in the sixth secretory pathway [65], which is
not currently described in the COGs' database)
(Additional file 9). Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon
rank sum test.

conclusion that their evolution is dominated, at least,
quantitatively, by extensive gene loss that proceeds, in
large part, along parallel routes in distant organisms. Special emphasis is made on the loss of regulatory genes that
is considered to be a potentially more important process
leading to pathogenicity than acquisition of "virulence
factors".
I believe that the conclusions of the paper are, basically,
correct. Just a few comments, not so much to criticize, but
rather to put these conclusions into the context of previous research and thinking.
1. The parallel loss of genes in diverse bacterial parasites and symbionts, certainly, has been noticed
before, for instance, in the context of the analysis of
genome-trees constructed by gene content comparison in which the parasitic and symbiotic forms tend to
cluster together (Wolf et al. Trends Genet. 2002
Sep;18(9):472–9.)
2. The paths of gene loss are partially parallel and partially divergent as also noticed on many previous occasions, just for instance: Foster J. PLoS Biol. 2005
Apr;3(4):e121
3. Parallel gene loss seems to be quantitatively dominant in the evolution of parasites and symbionts, but
this is not to discount "virulence factors" (generally
viewed) that can be qualitatively critical. Even one
such gene can make a big difference like, for instance,
ATP/ADP translocase in Rickettsia and Chlamydia.

Eugene Koonin (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH)

This paper reports a massive comparative-genomic analysis of parasitic and symbiotic bacteria and comes to the

This manuscript provides a thorough analysis of >300
bacterial genomes, distinguishing free-living from (various levels of) host-dependent species. It is reported that
parasitic and mutualistic bacteria have a higher AT-content, a lower number of ribosomal RNA genes and intact
ribosomal operons, and have experienced massive gene
loss in a non-independent way – host-dependent species
from distinct phyla tend to lose/retain the same genes and
functions.
I found the analysis well-conducted, and the results interesting. Not everything is new, of course, but this is the first
overall picture of the situation, as far as I know, and I
learnt much by reading this piece. Here are a couple of
comments.

The discussion about rRNA operon, growth rate and lifestyle appears a bit unclear to me. The relationship
between doubling time and number of rRNA operons
seems pretty strong (but unfortunately not shown, figure
5 being difficult to decipher). My guess would be that
growth rate, which everybody says is primarily limited by
protein synthesis, is the leading player here. So the question could be: why would intracellular species evolve a
slower growth rate than free-living bacteria? The authors
invoke environmental stability and reduced number of
genes, but the connection is not obvious. I would suggest
that growth rate is under more subtle selective pressure in
a host-dependent species than in a free-living species. This
is because the growth rate of a parasite/mutualist is (presumably) strongly related to its virulence. Because of the
two-level selection process – between individuals within a
host vs. between colonies of distinct hosts – growth rate in
host-dependent bacteria could be limited to avoid too
strong, detrimental virulence.
Authors' response: Intracellular genomes encounter elevated genetic drift resulting from relaxed selection on
many genes and from radical change in population structure that results in lowered efficacy of selection on genes
[66-68]. It has been suggested that the occurrence of multiple typical operons may be important in the ability of
bacteria to respond to changing growth conditions [43].
Living continuously within the host eliminates the
extreme environmental fluctuations encountered by freeliving bacteria [24]. Selective coefficients for the maintenance of genes for regulation and for rRNA genes may be
reduced in an intracellular environment, resulting in the
loss of these genes.
We found a significant negative correlation between generation time on one side and the number of rRNA operons
and transcriptional regulators on the other side. Growth
rate is linked on one hand to the number of rRNA operons
which are the principle apparatus for translation and to
the regulation of transcription on the other hand. Hence,
as you said growth rate is primarily limited by protein synthesis. The slower growth rate of intracellular bacterial
parasites may be important as these bacteria have to dissimulate in order to avoid immune system. Add to this
growth leads to host-cell lysis in Chlamydia for example,
thus to the loss of the host supply. Therefore, slow growth
for parasitic bacteria may be essential to prolong their life
within cell. The slow growth rate is also beneficial for
mutualistic bacteria. Mutualists and their host exchange
gene products, because of this complementary and
mutual dependence, mutualistic bacteria have to synchronize their metabolism with that of their host. Indeed,
symbiotic relationship implicates that the endosymbionts
and the host cell live in concert. Altogether, slow growth

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/13

may be under more selective pressure in host-dependent
bacteria than in free-living bacteria.
Reviewer: Reporting that parasitic and mutualistic bacterial species have distinct, irreversible gene-loss signatures,
the authors question the scenario invoking parasitism as
an intermediate step before mutualism, which is a good
point. They do not, however, comment on the fact that
"global" markers of host-dependence (AT-content,
number of genes, number of rRNA operons) are more
extreme in mutualists than in parasites. I would tend to
interpret this as a consequence of higher stability in time
of mutualistic associations, as compared to parasitism,
which seems to make sense. This is good self-corroboration for the life style annotations used in this study.
Authors' response: Thank you for this remark. We have
demonstrated that there is a significant difference in
genome content between parasites and mutualists due to
the differential gene loss in relation with their lifestyles.
Add to this the sequestration of these intracellular
genomes limits their capacity for lateral gene transfer,
which renders gene loss irreversible. Altogether, these
observations suggest that mutualism and parasitism are
two distinct host-relationships supported by significantly
different sets of functions. The difference between mutualists and parasites is significant for many functions, especially for amino acids transport and metabolism that
represent a higher fraction of the mutualistic genomes
than in the parasitic genomes.
Relevant genomic studies about mutualists, like Buchnera
spp., revealed the stability of these genomes [21]. This
genomic stasis (absence of chromosome rearrangements
and gene acquisition) is likely attributable to the loss of
phages, repeated sequences, and recA. Hence, the loss of
genetic elements that mediate recombination is responsible for the genome stability. In contrast, genome analyses
of parasitic genomes like Rickettsiae, showed gene rearrangements [39] and genome shuffling [69]. Moreover
certain genomes contain plasmids and present evidence
for lateral gene transfer [70,71]. Even though these events
are rare in obligate intracellular bacteria comparing to
free-living bacteria, they are more important in parasitic
genomes than in symbiotic genomes. Altogether, these
observations confirm that mutualistic genomes present a
higher level of genome stability than parasitic genomes.
Reviewer: By the way: where do these annotations come
from? Is there a database for bacterial ecology?
Authors' response: Considering the large amount of bacterial genomes, we were interested in a possible relationship between the phenotype and the genome. We doubt
there is a database for bacterial ecology. We made an

Page 17 of 25

Biology Direct 2009, 4:13

exhaustive literature review looking for information
about bacterial lifestyle. We checked for the habitat of
these bacteria and eventual eukaryotic cell-dependency.
Bacterial classification is indicated in additional file 1.
Reviewer: One major result of the paper is the discovery
of non-independent gene loss in various, distantly related,
transitions from free-living to host-dependent life style.
This result, however, is perahps not surprising, knowing
that essentiality varies across genes – some can be lost,
some can not, irrespective of life style. The authors partly
account for this by restricting the statistical test to the set
of genes lost at least once, so that essential genes are not
considered in this analysis. Even among "losable" genes,
however, the probability of gene loss irrespective of life
style could vary. I would suggest to perform a control
analysis in which host-dependent genomes would be
replaced by small, free-living genomes – several free-living
alpha and gamma proteobacteria have less than 2500
genes. It could be good to know what is specific to hostdependence-associated genome reduction, as compared
to "random" (whatever it means) genome reduction.
Authors' response: The process of genome reduction and
gene loss is well-known for obligate intracellular bacteria
[8,10,20,72]. The aim of this paper was not to reproduce
such results but to test for an eventual convergent evolution, characterized by a non-random loss induced by the
common phenotype.
According to your suggestion, we have performed the control analysis to verify that the 100 lost COGs are specific
to the reductive evolution of obligate intracellular bacteria. For that we have separated free-living bacteria into two
groups: free-living small genomes and free-living large
genomes using the cut-off of 2.92 Mb which is the mean
genome size of facultative host-associated bacteria. In
order to make the comparison between phylogenetically
close relatives, we have treated the only phyla where there
were small and large genomes. Genome sizes are given in
additional file 1. We got 8 phyla Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia, Lactobacillales, Bacillales, Actinobacteria, and Cyanobacteria, which represent a total of 168
free-living to include in the analysis. In each phylogenetic
group, we identified COGs that are lost by 75% of the
small free-living and conserved in more than 25% of the
large free-living. First, we looked for COGs that are lost in
common, i.e. by small free-living from more than one
phylum. Second, in order to see if the 100 lost COGs are
specific to the obligate intracellular reductive evolution,
we studied the losses of small free-living bacteria. Thus,
we compared their loss distribution for a COG in the set
of the 100 COGs to the loss distribution for a COG in all
the other COGs (among COGs lost at least once in small
free-living), using a Chi-squared test for independence.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/13

We found no COG lost in common by all small free-living
from the 8 phylogenetic studied groups. Similarly, we
didn't find a COG that is lost in concert by small free-living from 7 or 6 groups. Thus no convergence phenomenon occurs within these phylogenetic groups, and the
hypothesis of independent loss for small free-living cannot be rejected. The majority of the losable COGs are lost
by only one phylogenetic group (Additional file 10). Freeliving small genomes lose COGs from the set of 100
COGs or from the set of other COGs without difference
(Chi-squared test for independence 2 = 3.695, df = 2, pvalue = 0.158). Thus, in the free-living loss process, there
is no significant preference for the set of 100 COGs that
we found associated to the obligate intracellular genome's
reduction. Consequently, we can deduce that these 100
COGs are specific to the reductive evolution of obligate
intracellular genomes.
Reviewer's report 3
Jeremy Selengut (The Institute for Genomic Research)

This work presents a useful overall comparative analysis
and comparison of the genomic content of free-living,
host-associated and obligate intracellular organisms. The
well-known observation that small genome sizes are correlated with host-association is supported with concrete
data, but more importantly, this is dissected with respect
do different types of host-associated lifestyle. Difference
between mutualists and parasites are delineated, and
most importantly, commonalities are found between the
classes of genes and changes in rRNA operons that are
observed in many phylogenetically independent cases of
adaptation to a host-associated lifestyle.
Unfortunately, in its current form, this manuscript suffers
from many faults in language, logic, organization, data
analysis and data presentation. I have offered extensive
comments on these issues and sincerely hope that these
deficiencies can be improved. None of these issues is fatal,
and I expect that with an improved manuscript I will be
able to provide a more positive endorsement in the public
commentary accompanying its publication.
Authors' response: Thank you for the time you have spent
revising the manuscript. Thank you for all the valuable
comments you have addressed to us. Please find attached
the manuscript revised according to your remarks. We
have made the corrections in language and data presentation. We tried to clarify some areas of the method and data
analysis. Hope that this version of the manuscript conforms to the requirements and can get your positive
support.

Final Review
Reviewer: The authors, in their attempt to probe into the
nature of genome reduction in obligate intracellular (OI)
"specialists", lay out a stepwise model from large free-living organisms to somewhat reduced host-associated
organisms finally to OI organisms with their small
genomes. On the one hand, this model is inarguable, in
order to go from large to small, an intermediate medium
state must be passed through. A pertinent question, however, is whether currently observable host-associated,
moderately reduced species are representative in terms of
their detailed gene content of that intermediate state
which OI organisms passed through. Are the host-associated organisms of today the OI organisms of the future, or
did today's OI organisms pass through a different kind of
intermediate state on their evolutionary pathway?

Authors' response: The purpose of this paper was to correlate genomic features with phenotype i.e. the small
genome size and gene content with the bacterial lifestyle.
For that we classified bacteria in 3 large communities on
the basis of their lifestyles then we compared their
genomic contents. According to previous relevant papers,
small genome is not an ancestral state. Molecular phylogenetic studies and genome analyses showed that the
small reduced genomes derived from large genomes
through massive gene loss [5-8,20,73,74]. Our analysis of
genome content shows that facultative host-associated
bacteria constitute a large community of bacteria that we
can consider as intermediate because their genome content is smaller than that of free-living bacteria and larger
than that of obligate intracellular bacteria (Figure 3).
Moreover, genome analysis of obligate intracellular bacteria of Rickettsia spp. revealed the presence of degraded
genes and gene remnants [41]. The presence of gene remnants in these reduced genomes constitutes molecular fossils that witnesses for the gradual genome degradation
leading to specialized intracellular bacteria, and confirms
the role of intermediate stage that we can attribute to the
facultative host-associated bacteria. In fact, our results
confirm the simple evidence that the more genes are lost
the more a bacterium becomes dependent of its host.
Reviewer: A separate question to be addressed is whether
all OI organisms, irrespective of the specifics of the evolutionary paths they have travelled to get there, have more
or less arrived at the same end point. There are two ways
to look at this question, one could try to determine
whether the set of remaining genes is the same across all
OI organisms, or one could ask whether the set of genes
lost from free-living ancestors is similar. The former
method is simpler, more commonly essayed, but the
answers it provides are much clouded by the lineage-specific genes which are what make each OI organism unique
and adapted to its particular host. The latter tack is the

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/13

focus of this work and requires a bit more effort to reconstruct an accounting of the lost genes.
Authors' response: Our analysis considers the lost and
the remained genes. One, we could demonstrate that the
loss event concerns the same set of COGs and that is what
we described as convergent reductive evolution. Second,
we compared the gene content between obligate intracellular bacteria, parasites vs. mutualists, and we showed that
gene inventories are significantly different, because the
remaining genes reflect the host-relationship, harmful or
beneficial, respectively.
A future approach that we would like to develop consists
of reconstructing the ancestral genomes then describing
the evolution of genes using the phylogenetic profile. We
would relate the history of gene loss and gene gain of each
phylum more precisely in the evolutionary time scale.
Reviewer: In the results section of the abstract it is stated
that the observation of fewer rRNA genes, split rRNA operons and fewer transcriptional regulators are linked to
slower growth rates. I find this usage of the term "linked"
unfortunate, as nothing over and above a statistical corellation is presented here. These four measurables are all
corellated to one another, the OI lifestyle and any number
of other factors characteristic of OI organisms. It may be
that there is a rationale to explain a linkage between slow
growth rates, rRNA operons and transcriptional regulators, but the authors have neither spelled out that rationale nor suported this linkage as a significant "result" of
their work. On a similar note, the results also state that the
specialization is an "irreversible phenomenon characterized by translation modification and massive gene loss..."
That specialization is irreversible in OI organisms considering their genetic isolation from a gene pool for lateral
gene transfer has been suggested in other work and is
quite reasonable, but it can hardly be construed as a result
of this study, and the particular connection to "translation
modification" (changes in the apparatus of translation i.e.
rRNAs – author's comment) is unsupported.
Authors' response: The PCA in Figure 5 shows that the
obligate intracellular reduced genomes have few genes for
transcriptional regulation, few rRNA operons and that
they do need long time for growth. On the contrary, the
fast-growing free-living bacteria have more genes involved
in the regulation of transcription and more rRNA operons. We have done a multiple regression analysis to test
for correlation between the 3 factors (growth time, transcriptional regulation and rRNA operon numbers). The
multiple regression analysis showed that there is a significant relation between the phenotypic character which is
the growth time, and the 2 other genomic features.

In what concerns irreversibility, genome size and gene
repertoire can increase through gene acquisition, i.e. lateral gene transfer and gene duplication, and conversely,
decrease by deletion [3,4]. It is not surprising that the
genomes of obligate intracellular bacteria includes the
smallest genome of any characterized bacteria, that of
Candidatus Carsonella ruddii, an endosymbiotic Gammaproteobacteria. In fact, the dynamics of bacterial genomes
are affected by their niches. On one hand, specialization
to an intracellular lifestyle implies a genetic isolation
characterized by the diminution of lateral gene transfer.
Indeed, a phylogenomic study has shown that bacteria
from different phyla cluster together according to their
waterborne lifestyle [13]. Audic et al., have quantified the
lateral gene transfer events and have concluded that bacterial communities living in water have the highest percentage of LGT, whereas intracellular bacteria have the
lowest percentage of LGT. On the other hand, Andersson
et al. [72,75] and Moran et al. [8,76] have studied the
genome evolution by gene loss, in the parasites in Alphaproteobacteria and in the endosymbionts in Gammaproteobacteria. Altogether, the reduced genome that results
from or follows the restriction of bacteria to a special
niche implies massive gene loss that is not compensated
by the acquisition of foreign DNA (LGT). Thus, the severe
gene loss we described in obligate intracellular genomes
comparing to free-living bacteria, may represent an irreversible evolutionary trajectory that constrains existence
outside a eukaryotic cell, and limits transitions in lifestyles (e.g. parasitic versus mutualistic associations with
hosts) [7,47]. Indeed, the irreversibility is not a result of
our paper, but it is an important argument to support the
different evolutionary fates of mutualists' and parasites'
genomes. Irreversibility is essential in the description of
the model we propose: "the one-way road specialization".
Finally it has been suggested that recombination events
concerning the duplicated rRNA operons induced
genome shuffling and contributed to the rickettsial
genome evolution [39,40]. We could show that the
altered structure of rRNA operons concerns more than one
host-dependent lineage. That's why we judged important
to mention this result as it helps in the understanding of
one of the mechanisms of evolution.
Reviewer: The abstract states that this work identifies the
loss of "100 genes" in OI organisms. This is not strictly
true in the sense of 100 individual, named orthologous
genes, rather, they have identified 100 gene functions represented by 100 different COGs (clusters of orthologous
groups). Many of these COGs have more than one representative in free-living organisms. Members of these 100
orthologous groups are absent from OI organisms and
nearly universal in free-living organisms. Finally, that the
statement that mutualists and parasites have lost distinct

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/13

sets of genes is paired with statements about which types
of genes are retained is curious and confusing.
Authors' response: Our analysis consisted on comparing
bacterial genomes from different lifestyles on the basis of
their genome content. We used the classification of the
genes in the functional categories as defined in the COG
database [60,61]. Our method was based on the comparaison of:
(i) the number of genes for each category of COG
(copy number of genes) (Table 1)
(ii) and the number of COG present or absent in each
bacteria.
Thus, considering the presence or absence of COGs we
identified 100 orthologous genes lost in obligate intracellular bacteria and present in free-living bacteria (Table 4).
Thank you for this precision, we have highlighted this
notion in the abstract.
When comparing the number of genes, free-living bacteria
have more genes than obligate intracellular bacteria
(Additional file 2), and the difference is more than 100
genes. Thus, obligate intracellular bacteria have lost more
than the core of 100 lost COGs. Obviously, we can say
that these additional losses are specific to the evolutionary
history of each species. Our comparison of the gene contents of mutualists and parasites showed that the gene
inventories are specific to each lifestyle. This suggests that
the additional losses we talk about are in fact specific to
the type of host-relationship.
Reviewer: In their abstract conclusion, the authors state
that gene loss rather than acquisition of virulence factors
has been a driving force in the adaptation of parasites to
eukaryotic cells. I find this a bit hard to take, considering
that there is no explicit study of virulence factors in this
work, in fact the only mention of virulence factors is in the
manuscript's conclusion where a single reference supports
a statement about the occurrence of genes named virulence
factors in free-living organisms compared to pathogenic
bacteria, a statement whose character has the distinct odor
of transitive annotation error about it.
Authors' response: In what concerns the driving force,
what we claim makes a lot of sense on evolutionary point
of view. Human bacterial pathogens are highly specialized
bacteria their evolution obeys to the allotropic model of
speciation by Mayr [77]. When specializing to an intracellular lifestyle, bacteria lose their capabilities to survive in
another niche because of the loss of genes and genetic isolation. Thus the overall consequence of allotropic speciation is genome reduction and gene loss. The reversibility

Biology Direct 2009, 4:13

of this phenomenon has never been demonstrated and is
basically against evolutionary principle see [78]. We
didn't study the virulence factors in this work but the
mention in the manuscript's conclusion can be considered as a prospect. Actually, the evolutionary history of
virulence factors would be very interesting to explore in a
further work.
Reviewer: To support the statement (Results and Discussion, first line) that "Host-dependent bacteria typically
have a smaller genome size and fewer genes compared to
their close relatives in the same phylum.", Additional file
2 is included. Unfortunately, that plot only establishes
that host-dependent organisms trend towards smaller size
within phyla, but makes no statements about organisms
which are close relatives in the same phylum. A phylum is a
pretty broad taxonomic grouping. In fact the authors
repeatedly use the phrase "close relatives" when trying to
relate free-living and host-associated organisms while in
fact basing this closeness on broad taxonomic categories
and never holding up a specific example. An analysis
based on a tree of life (for instance, Wu & Eisen, 2008)
would be much more useful. Specific examples would be
useful, i.e. what specific free-living organisms can be held
up as the closest relatives of specific OI organisms and what
can be concluded about them?
Authors' response: The phylogenetic close relatives are
determined according to the current bacterial taxonomy
and standard prokaryotic phylogeny, based on sequence
similarity of 16S rRNA. In agreement with previous
phylogenomic studies [11-13], our work confirms that
based on the genome content and the bacterial lifestyle,
bacteria may be close relatives to distant phylogenetically
related bacteria (on the basis of the 16S rRNA). Thus on
the phylogenetic tree in figure 1 we can appreciate the
convergent evolution, i.e. similar genomic features (like
gene loss and alteration of rRNA operons) occurring in
bacteria from distinct phyla but similar habitat.
Reviewer: One of the central claims of this work is that
genome-reductive adaptation of distantly related organisms to varied intracellular environments is convergent.
That is to say, the same sets of gene functions are lost (as
represented here by COGs). In order to support this claim
it is not sufficient to tally the number of COGs which are
lost in all or most OI organisms, considering the total
amount of genes lost, some number will be lost in common. The task then is to determine whether the observed
number of concerted losses of the same function is statistically significant as compared to a random loss model.
The representation of the statistical methods used to
prove this point in the main body of the paper and the
caption to Additional File 5 are vague, but are detailed in
the methods section. Unfortunately, insufficient detail

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/13

and more important, clarity, is provided in the methods to
allow one to fully understand the procedure or to allow
replication of their results. Part of the murkiness in the
description may result from difficulties in the use of English, for instance the many missing articles, and does
"commonly lost" mean "often observed to be lost" or
"lost in concert among all test groups"? A more basic
question is whether the overall approach, a comparison of
only alpha and gamma proteobacterial mutualists and
parasites is a valid one. The authors should have spent
more effort in the main section of the manuscript outlining why this approach was chosen over other possibilities,
and why the resulting statistical significance value proves
the point they are trying to prove. Why are they focussing
on cases where a COG is "lost by bacteria of the group 
given that it is at least present in mutualists or parasites
from  or -proteobacteria"? This would be those COGs
which are not among the "core of lost COGs" because they
are present in one of these OI classes. The very next sentence says that this calculation is used to compute the
probability for any COG to be "in the set of commonly
lost COGs". How is this done?
Authors' response: We have modified the method section
concerning the test of convergence in order to be more
explicit. The "commonly lost" COGs are "COGs lost in
concert among all test groups", i.e. core of lost COGs.
Alpha and gamma proteobacteria are the unique phyla
containing both free-living and obligate intracellular bacteria, in sufficient species number to allow statistical comparative studies to be done. The obligate intracellular
bacteria from these two phyla represent a total of 25 bacteria over the 40 studied obligate intracellular bacteria.
Add to this, we didn't extrapolate the results of these two
phyla to the rest of obligate intracellular bacteria but we
searched for the COGs that we found lost in concert
among the obligate intracellular bacteria from alpha and
gamma Proteobacteria, in the obligate intracellular bacteria of other phyla. Thus the 100 COGs we retained are
absent from all obligate intracellular bacteria from different phyla. With the growing number of genome
sequences, we can expect to get more sequences for obligate intracellular and free-living bacteria in all phyla, in
order to make comparative genomic analyses including
phyla remaining unstudied to date. We aimed to prove the
non-independent gene loss between phyla, i.e. the obligate intracellular bacteria from different phyla tend to lose
the same COGs or they tend to lose no COG in common.
For that, we first calculated the probability for an obligate
intracellular bacterium to lose a COG among the 969
COGs lost at least by mutualists or parasites from  – or
-proteobacteria (Additional file 4). We obtained [0.0446,
0.0847] as 95%-confidence interval of p0. Then we calculated the probability P (X  100) with X having the Bino-

Page 21 of 25
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2009, 4:13

mial distribution B (969, p = 0.0847), this probability was
less than 0.05.
Consequently the same holds true for any probability p in
the 95%-confidence interval of p0 (Additional file 11).
This indicates that the obligate intracellular bacteria do
not lose COGs independently and thus proves convergent
loss phenomenon because the observed common loss
probability p1 (0.1032) was significantly greater than the
probability p0 (p0  0.0847 with 95% confidence) of loss
in common under the hypothesis of independent gene
loss between phyla. Second, we did not restrict our analysis to the set of COGs lost by obligate intracellular bacteria
(969 COGs), but we considered also the whole losable
COGs, i.e. COGs present in free-living bacteria from  –
or -proteobacteria (3865 COGs). We obtained [1.6 × 104, 3.7 × 10-4] as 95%-confidence interval of p . The prob0
ability P(X  100) with X having the Binomial distribution
B (3865, 3.7 × 10-4) was once again less than 0.05. In the
final version of the manuscript we only kept the latter test
considering the losable COGs (Additional file 6).
Reviewer: The authors make much of their correlations
between various calculated values and growth rates in particular. For instance, they state that they find a "significant
negative correlation between generation time on one side
and the number of rRNA operons and transcriptional regulators per Mb on the other side." And then state that all
of these are correlated with the OI lifestyle. Of all of the
measurables in this work, it is the growth rate data which
is most indirect and subject to bias. The authors have
compiled growth data from other compilers of such data
(in a way that is not easily traceable) and from primary literature from a wide variety of organisms growing under
many different conditions with varying relationships to
the conditions in which they were evolved to live. They
have binned these data into only three discrete categories
(fast, medium and slow) and represented those categories
by three discrete numbers for their PCA analyses. Considering the highly correlated nature of all of the observables
under study here and the over-processed and indirect
nature of the growth data, I find little of value is added to
this work by its inclusion.
Authors' response: We disagree with this statement. This
is the first work of this nature published to date, and it
may be improved latter. Actually, introducing a wide scale
analysis of growth time, transcriptional regulators and
ribosome is a real contribution. The ribosome is probably
a critical point in the evolution of specialized bacteria. For
that, we made an exhaustive literature search looking in
previous papers for exact experimentally time of growth
for bacteria. And we have asked two international reference collections, Pasteur and CCUG, for help about these
data. They agreed that there are a lot of problems to deter-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/13

mine precisely the time of growth of bacteria. Thus we
looked in literature and in CCUG website http://
www.ccug.se/default.cfm?navID=1 for information concerning the doubling time, or the generation time or the
colony observation or plaque formation (We have mentioned all the references we used in additional file 1). The
time of growth is given for bacteria in their optimal
growth conditions known nowadays: plate growth or cell
cultures (for fastidious bacteria). We grouped the studied
bacteria into 3 categories fast growing (24–48 hours),
median (3 to 7 days) and slow growing fastidious bacteria
(more than 7 days). We proposed approximate numbers
for the 3 categories (2, 5 and 10) that reflect the 3 ordered
levels of the experimental growth time. The Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) revealed similar behaviors of
bacteria on the basis of the gene count of transcriptional
regulators, rRNA operon numbers and growth time. The
task was difficult to determine precisely the growth time
but we consider that it is worthy doing it because it
revealed an important correlation between translation,
transcription and time of growth. Hope that future experimental works will give more precise determination of
generation time that reflects the real growth time of these
bacteria.
