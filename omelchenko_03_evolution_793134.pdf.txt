displacement in situ

Conclusions: The discovery of in situ gene displacement shows that combination of rampant
horizontal gene transfer with selection for preservation of operon structure provides for events in
prokaryotic evolution that, a priori, seem improbable. These findings also emphasize that not all
aspects of operon evolution are selfish, with operon integrity maintained by purifying selection at
the organism level.

interactions

Results: Since a substantial number of operons have been identified experimentally in only a few
model bacteria, evolutionarily conserved gene strings were analyzed as surrogates of operons. The
phylogenetic affinities within these predicted operons were assessed first by sequence similarity
analysis and then by phylogenetic analysis, including statistical tests of tree topology. Numerous
cases of apparent horizontal transfer of entire operons were detected. However, it was shown that
apparent horizontal transfer of individual genes or arrays of genes within operons is not uncommon
either and results in xenologous gene displacement in situ, that is, displacement of an ancestral gene
by a horizontally transferred ortholog from a taxonomically distant organism without change of the
local gene organization. On rarer occasions, operons might have evolved via independent assembly,
in part from horizontally acquired genes.

refereed research

Background: Shuffling and disruption of operons and horizontal gene transfer are major
contributions to the new, dynamic view of prokaryotic evolution. Under the 'selfish operon'
hypothesis, operons are viewed as mobile genetic entities that are constantly disseminated via
horizontal gene transfer, although their retention could be favored by the advantage of coregulation
of functionally linked genes. Here we apply comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis to
examine horizontal transfer of entire operons versus displacement of individual genes within
operons by horizontally acquired orthologs and independent assembly of the same or similar
operons from genes with different phylogenetic affinities.

Background

Operons, clusters of co-transcribed genes that often encode
functionally linked proteins, are the principal form of gene
organization and regulation in prokaryotes [1,2]. Comparative analysis of bacterial and archaeal genomes has shown
that only a few operons are conserved across large evolutionary distances. In general, gene order in prokaryotes is poorly
conserved and prone to numerous rearrangements [3-6]. A
detailed analysis of gene order conservation has shown that
only 5-25% of the genes in bacterial and archaeal genomes
belongs to gene strings (probable operons) shared by at least
two distantly related species [7]. The presence of identical or
similarly organized operons and suboperons in phylogenetically distant bacterial or archaeal lineages may result from
three distinct evolutionary processes. Firstly, inheritance
from the respective common ancestor - the core of the ribosomal protein superoperon is a case in point, but such conservation of operon organization is relatively rare; secondly,
independent origin of identical operons or suboperons in different lineages; and thirdly, emergence of operons in a single
lineage with subsequent dissemination by horizontal transfer. The potential central role of horizontal transfer in the
evolution of operon organization of prokaryotic genomes is
embodied in the 'selfish operon model' (SOM) [8-10]. This
model posits that "the physical proximity of genes in an
operon provides no selective benefit to the individual organism but does enhance the fitness of the gene cluster itself, as
clusters can be efficiently inherited horizontally as well as vertically" [11]. Under SOM, operons are conceptually analogous
to integrating viruses (phages), transposons and other mobile
genetic elements, although coregulation of the genes in an
operon could be an important selective factor that favors
retention of operons during evolution.
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events have been classified
into distinct categories of acquisition of new genes, acquisition of paralogs of existing genes and xenologous gene displacement whereby a gene is displaced by a horizontally
transferred ortholog from another lineage (xenolog [12]).
Each of these types of horizontal transfer is common among
prokaryotes, but their relative contributions differ in different
lineages [13]. Comparative-genomic analyses by many groups
have suggested that, on the whole, horizontal gene transfer
had substantial effects, albeit uneven in different lineages, on
the gene content of bacterial and archaeal genomes [13-19].
However, in spite of the considerable popularity of the selfish
operon theory, we are unaware of systematic studies of horizontal gene transfer events at the level of operons. In part,
this is likely to have been caused by the scarcity of experimental data on operon organization in any prokaryote other than
Escherichia coli.
Recent phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal proteins revealed
several instances of apparent xenologous gene displacement
within a conserved operon, in which other genes have not
been horizontally transferred; in other words, these operons

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/9/R55

appear to represent an evolutionary mosaic [20-22]. Another
study demonstrated a complicated mosaic organization of the
leukotoxin operon in bacteria of the genus Mannheimia (Pasteurella); the observed evolutionary pattern had to be
explained through multiple gene transfer events, which led to
the hypothesis that, in this case, frequent gene displacement
conferred selective advantage onto the bacterium by maintaining antigenic variation [23]. In earlier studies, evolution
of operons from gene blocks with distinct evolutionary fates
has been considered for rfb operons coding for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in enterobacteria [24].
To assess the role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution
of operons systematically, we undertook phylogenetic analysis of members of highly conserved gene neighborhoods that
are predicted to constitute operons [25]. We focused primarily on mosaic operons in which one or more of the genes
apparently have been transferred from distantly related species such that the phylogeny of the transferred genes is obviously incongruent with the phylogeny of the remaining genes
in the respective operons.

Results and discussion
Identification of horizontal gene transfer
Experimental data on operons in organisms other than E. coli
and, to a lesser extent, B. subtilis are scarce. Therefore we
used conserved gene pairs and connected gene neighborhoods associated with them as an approximation of operon
organization of genes in other prokaryotic genomes. Several
studies have suggested strongly that all gene pairs that are
conserved in multiple genomes belong to the same operon
[7,25,26]. Here we used an extremely conservative threshold
(conservation of a gene pair in 10 genomes) to ensure that
only genuine operons were analyzed. BLASTP searches for
potential horizontal gene transfer identified 729 candidate
genes (9% of all genes comprising conserved neighborhoods
in 41 analyzed genomes), that is, genes whose encoded protein sequences were more similar to homologs from phylogenetically distant taxa than to those from the reference taxon
(it might be worth noting that, throughout this analysis, we
treated genes as atomic units and did not consider the relatively unlikely possibility of HGT for portions of genes). Phylogenetic analysis of these genes and their neighbors revealed
different types of evolutionary events, some of which involve
whole operons, whereas others seem to reflect operon
mosaicity.
Probable horizontal transfer of whole operons or large portions of operons, when phylogenetic trees for all genes in a
predicted operon had the same topology (which, however,
was incompatible with the species tree) was identified in 35
neighborhoods - approximately one third of all analyzed
neighborhoods. These events were classified into three categories: acquisition of a new (for the given lineage) operon,
paralogous operon acquisition and xenologous operon

Omelchenko et al.

In addition, 19 predicted operons with different phylogenetic
affinities of the constituent genes, that is, apparent mosaic
operons, were identified (Table 2). Again, this is definitely a
low bound - not only because of the high threshold set for the
identification of conserved gene pairs, but also because this
number includes only cases that were clearly resolved by phylogenetic tree analysis. In addition, we detected many uncertain cases where the different phylogenetic affinities of genes
within an operon were not strongly supported (data not
shown); at least some of these are probably also mosaic
operons.
Below we describe in greater detail several case studies of
putative mosaic operons; in each of these cases, in addition to
the basic set of 41 species, we included in the analysis the
apparent orthologs of the respective proteins from all
prokaryotic species in which they were detected, in order to
control for possible effects of taxon sampling. We found that,
although the details of tree topology inevitably depended on
the set of species analyzed, the conclusions regarding HGT
were not affected by the inclusion of additional species.

Case studies of mosaic operons
Ribosomal protein L29 gene
In the previous study that prompted this work, we analyzed
the phylogeny of several ribosomal proteins and found several cases of apparent horizontal transfer resulting in mosaic
operon organization [20]. Horizontal transfer "in the heart of
the ribosome" also has been independently described by others [21,22]. Here we report another case of a ribosomal protein operon with apparent in situ gene displacement (that is,
displacement without change of the local gene arrangement)
via HGT. Figure 1a shows the highly conserved gene arrangement around the gene for the large subunit protein L29. The
phylogenetic trees for the flanking L16 and S17 genes showed
largely congruent topologies without any indications of HGT
(Figure 1b,d). In contrast in the L29 tree, unexpected clustering is seen for Aquifex aeolicus and both Rickettsia: the
Aquifex branch is within the archaeal cluster, whereas the
Rickettsia group is with Chlamydia, rather than with the rest
of alpha-proteobacteria: the taxon where Rickettsia belong
(Figure 1c). In situ displacement is the most likely mechanism
behind this observation given that the structure of this operon
is conserved in the majority of bacteria. The nature of the
selective advantages conferred by this gene substitution is
unclear, but the apparent sources of the transferred genes
suggest that the displacements indeed might be adaptive.
Aquifex apparently acquired the L29 gene from archaea,
which could be related to the adaptation to the hyperthermal
conditions, whereas Rickettsia probably captured the gene
from other parasitic bacteria, such as Chlamydia. However,
these observations also allow a non-adaptationist interpretation, under which the apparent source of acquired genes simply reflects the increased likelihood of gene exchange between
the respective organisms due to co-habitation, with chance
fixation of some of the transferred genes.

http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/9/R55

The ruvB gene of Mycoplasma
The genes for Holliday junction resolvase subunits RuvA and
RuvB form an operon that is conserved in most of the
sequenced bacterial genomes (Figure 2a). In the phylogenetic
trees for RuvA and RuvB, the branch that includes
Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma occupies drastically different
positions. In contrast to RuvA, which belongs to the Grampositive clade as expected (Figure 2b), mycoplasmal RuvB
clusters with the epsilon-proteobacteria (Helicobacter and
Campylobacter) and the mycoplasma-epsilon-proteobacteria clade further joins alpha-proteobacteria (Figure 2c). This
clustering is strongly supported by bootstrap analysis and
was shown to be robust using statistical tests of tree topology
(Table 3). Thus, the ruvB gene seems to have undergone
xenologous displacement in situ after the divergence of the
mycoplasmal branch from the rest of Gram-positive bacteria.
Notably, the gene exchange seems to have occurred between
phylogenetically distant parasitic bacteria.

Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase gene in the lipid biosynthesis
operon of Rickettsia
In Rickettsia, the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase gene
(uppS), which belongs to a highly conserved doublet of lipid
biosynthesis genes embedded in functionally diverse operons
(Figure 3a), clusters with an unexpected assemblage of bacterial orthologs, including those from the spirochete
Treponema pallidum and Fusobacterium nucleatum, but not
with the 'native' taxon, alpha-proteobacteria (Figure 3b,c).
Statistical testing of the tree topology showed that clustering
of rickettsial uppS with those from other alpha-proteobacteria is highly unlikely (Table 3). The apparent in situ gene displacement of the uppS gene in Rickettsia was accompanied by
a breakdown of the operon into three fragments (Figure 3a).
The topology of the uppS tree suggests the possibility of multiple HGT events, although only the rickettsial genomes show
evidence of gene displacement in situ. The emergence of gene
displacement in bacterial parasites is noted here again.

NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits in Halobacterium sp.
Gene organization in the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase
operon is highly conserved in all sequenced archaeal genomes
and those of several groups of bacteria (Figure 4a). The nuoI
gene of Halobacterium sp. shows an unexpected phylogenetic
affinity with proteobacteria (Figure 4c), whereas the neighboring genes have the regular archaeal affinities (Figure
4b,d). The unusual phylogeny of halobacterial NuoI, which
was strongly supported by statistical tests (Table 3), suggests
in situ displacement by a proteobacterial gene. Notably, all
three NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits of the
cyanobacteria unexpectedly grouped within the archaeal
clusters of the respective trees (Figure 4b-d). These observations point to a complex history of HGT for the genes encoding all subunits of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase.

Perhaps the most prominent case of mosaic operon organization is the leucine/isoleucine biosynthesis operon of several
bacteria and archaea, particularly Thermotoga maritima.

Leucine/isoleucine biosynthesis operon

interactions

Another interesting case of mosaic structure of the same
operon is seen in Deinococcus radiodurans (Figure 5a). Deinococcus RfbA shows clear affinity with proteobacteria (Figure 5d), whereas RfbD is of archaeal descent (Figure 5e), with
RELL analysis revealing no competing topologies (Table 3).
The remaining two genes of this operon in Deinococcus, rfbB
(DRA0041) and rfbC (DRA0043), have uncertain phylogenetic affinities (Figure 5b,5c). Thus, as in the case of M. thermoautotrophicus, this operon in Deinococcus was apparently
formed through at least two events of xenologous gene displacement in situ and gene shuffling.

refereed research

The genes of the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (rfbABCD)
operon appear to have been extensively and independently
shuffled in many prokaryotic genomes and might have undergone multiple horizontal transfers. This conclusion is supported both by examination of the operon organization
(Figure 5a) and by phylogenetic tree analysis (Figure 5b-e).
The trees showed a clear affinity between the rfbA, rfbB, rfbC
genes of Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum and
Clostridium acetobutylicum (Figure 5b-d), with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Listeria monocytogenes joining the
cluster in the case of rfbB (Figure 5b), whereas M. thermoautotrophicum RfbD clustered with its archaeal orthologs as
expected (Figure 5e). The genes of the rfbABCD operon in
Methanothermobacter are shuffled compared to the probable ancestral order, which is found in many bacteria and C.
acetobutylicum also shows a rearrangement (Figure 5a). One
likely scenario in this case is that M. thermoautotrophicum
acquired the rfbABCD operon with the typical gene order
from a bacterium of the clostridial lineage, which was followed by displacement of three resident genes and loss of one
of the invading genes, accompanied by operon

rearrangement. An alternative scenario is that the rearrangement occurred in the source bacterium of the clostridial
group and Methanothermobacter acquired only the rfbACB
portion, which might have inserted head-to-tail downstream
of the original operon, followed by elimination of the resident
rfbABC (Figure 5a).

acetobutylicum have been translocated and several genes
probably have been independently accrued (Figure 6a). In
both P. abyssi and Thermotoga, the original leuA and leuB
genes within the leuABDC core seem to have been independently displaced by bacterial orthologs without a clear affinity

Given the apparent propensity of Thermotoga (and other
hyperthermophilic bacteria) for acquisition of archaeal genes
via HGT, it seems most likely that the archaeal version of the
leuACD suboperon originally entered the bacterial domain
via Thermotoga or a related thermophilic bacterium.
Formally, in Thermotoga these events could be classified as a
combination of paralogous (sub)operon acquisition
(TM0554-TM0555 in addition to another paralogous
archaeal gene pair TM0291-TM0292) and xenologous gene
displacements (genes TM0553, TM0556). In Clostridium,
xenologous operon displacement seems to have occurred
because the ancestral operon of the Gram-positive type
apparently had been lost. The subsequent evolution of this
operon in the four organisms proceeded along different
paths. Aquifex has lost the operon structure even for the two
subunits of 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase (LeuB, LeuD).
Different genes in the operons of P. abyssi and C.

reviews

This is the only known branched chain amino acid biosynthesis operon, and it is partly conserved in a wide range of bacteria (Figure 6a). Following initial indications from the analysis
of taxon-specific BLAST hits, we constructed phylogenetic
trees for each of the genes of this operon. Unlike other bacteria, Thermotoga has two leuA paralogs, which are adjacent in
the operon. The proteins encoded by these paralogous genes
show clearly distinct phylogenetic affinities: TM0552 belongs
to a distinct clade within the archaeal domain, whereas
TM0553 is part of a Gram-positive bacterial cluster (Figure
6b). This phylogenetic mosaic in Thermotoga extends further, with LeuB (TM0556) clustering with proteobacterial
orthologs (Figure 6c), and LeuC (TM0554) and LeuD
(TM0555) with archaeal orthologs (Figure 6d,e). All these
affinities were strongly supported by two versions of bootstrap analysis (Table 3). The genes encoding LeuA, LeuC, and
LeuD from Thermotoga, Clostridium, Aquifex and both
Pyrococcus abyssi and P. furiosus belong to a well-defined
clade, which also includes a medley of alpha-proteobacteria
and cyanobacteria, within the archaeal domain in the respective trees (Figure 6b-e). Thus, this sub-operon apparently has
been relatively recently horizontally spread among these
organisms. Pyrococcus abyssi and P. furiosus probably
acquired these genes after the divergence from the common
ancestor with P. horikoshii because the latter has only the typical archaeal operon (Figure 6a).

Intragenomic plasticity and inter-species horizontal mobility
of operons are thought to be important facets of prokaryotic
genome evolution. Indeed, the results presented here indicate
that horizontal transfer of entire operons is the most likely
explanation for most of the findings of co-localized 'alien'
genes in a genome, which is generally consistent with SOM.
However, a substantial fraction - approximately 35% - of
operons with indications of horizontal transfer events appear
to consist of genes with different phylogenetic affinities. Barring artifacts of phylogenetic analysis, which can never be
ruled out completely, but appear unlikely given the strong
statistical support for the anomalous placement of the genes
in question in phylogenetic trees, two evolutionary scenarios
for the origin of such mosaic operons are conceivable. The
first involves de novo assembly of operons, in part from genes
acquired via HGT, whereas the second one postulates in situ
xenologous displacement of genes within a resident operon.
Analysis of mosaic operons suggested that both scenarios
might apply, but in situ displacement is likely to be more frequent. In several cases, in situ displacement seems to have
occurred between genomes of distantly related parasitic bacteria that might have shared a host. A sequence of events that
is often considered as an alternative to HGT is an ancient
duplication with subsequent differential loss of paralogs.
However, in the cases analyzed here, this seems to be a particularly remote possibility because a tandem duplication followed by lengthy evolution of both paralogs within the operon
would be required to mimic in situ displacement. Tandem

At first glance, in situ gene displacement seems highly
unlikely: given the vast evolutionary distance separating the
donor and recipient genomes, homologous recombination is
out of the question. In cases when the displacing gene(s) is
located on the periphery of an operon (for example, Figure
5a), a plausible mechanism could involve initial insertion of
the invading gene in the vicinity of the resident operon, followed by deletion of intervening genes (provided these are
non-essential). However, when the displacing gene is tucked
between resident ones (for example, Figures 4a, 6a),
displacement must have occurred with surgical precision. The
only conceivable explanation seems to be that HGT is
extremely common in the evolution of prokaryotes and so is
intragenomic recombination, which provides for rare chance
occurrences of in situ displacement. Conceivably, a horizontally acquired gene that displaces the resident ortholog without disruption of operon organization would have its chances
of evolutionary fixation greatly increased, hence the apparent
disproportional survival of the displacing genes. This
explanation does not refute SOM as the conceptual framework explaining the origin of operons but emphasizes the
'altruistic' aspect of the evolution of operons whereby the
operon integrity is maintained by strong purifying selection
at the organism level.

reports

Conclusions

pairs of paralogs are uncommon in operons and such a
'smoking gun' was not observed in any of the suspected cases
of in situ displacement.

reviews

with any specific bacterial lineage (Figure 6a). The most likely
scenario for evolution of this operon in Thermotoga is that it
originated as a Gram-positive type operon and subsequently
many genes (or sub-operons) have been displaced in situ
through multiple horizontal transfers and a few additional
genes have been inserted into the preexisting structure. The
alternative but less likely hypothesis involves independent, de
novo operon assembly from genes of different phylogenetic
affinities. Several other apparent HGT events were detected
during the analysis of the phylogenetic trees for leucine biosynthesis genes (DR1614 in LeuD tree, DR1610 in LeuC tree
(Figure 6d,e)) but, in these cases, the acquired genes do not
belong to conserved operons.

The protein sequences encoded by the genes of each neighborhood were searched against the non-redundant protein
sequence database (NCBI, NIH, Bethesda) using the BLASTP
program. The BLAST hits were analyzed to identify their
potential phylogenetic affinity. For each protein, the best hits
were identified to the taxon to which the given species
belongs (hereinafter, reference taxon) and to other major
taxa; hits to closely related species were disregarded (see
Table 1S in the additional data file). Proteins that had more
significant (lower E-value) hits to a non-reference taxon than
to the reference taxon were considered candidates for horizontal transfer and the respective orthologous protein clusters were subject to further phylogenetic analysis as described
in the next section. If phylogenetic analysis indicated that a
particular gene was likely to be horizontally transferred,

interactions

Gene neighborhoods for the 41 compared genomes were
reconstructed as previously described [25]. Briefly, the collection of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins from complete genomes (COGs) [28] was used as the source of
information on orthologous relationships for detecting conserved gene pairs. For the purpose of this analysis only 'highly
conserved' gene pairs were considered, that is, those formed
by genes from two COGs that were present in the same orientation and separated by less than three genes in at least 10 of
the compared genomes. This conservative approach was
adopted in order to ensure that all analyzed gene pairs belong
to the same operon. At the next step, overlapping gene pairs
were joined in triplets; each triplet was required to exist in at
least one genome. Overlapping triplets were used to construct
gene arrays by run search in an oriented graph; a gene array
may or may not be found in its entirety in any available
genome. Finally, gene arrays that shared at least three COGs
were clustered into neighborhoods by using a single-linkage

phylogenetic trees were built also for the genes predicted to
belong to the same operon. When different phylogenetic
affinities were found for genes of the same predicted operon,
this operon was considered to be 'mosaic'.

Phylogenetic analysis

13.

Multiple protein sequence alignments were constructed using
the T-Coffee program [29] and positions containing >70%
gaps were excluded. Distance trees were constructed by using
the least-square method as implemented in the FITCH program of the PHYLIP package [30,31]. The least-square trees
were subjected to maximum-likelihood local rearrangement
using the ProtML program of the MOLPHY package, with the
JTT-F model of amino acid substitutions [32,33]. The resulting trees are a surrogate for maximum-likelihood phylogenies; exhaustive maximum-likelihood tree construction is
impractical for the number of species analyzed here. Bootstrap analysis was performed for each maximum-likelihood
tree using the Resampling of Estimated Log-Likelihoods
(RELL) method as implemented in MOLPHY [32-34]. Alternative placements of selected clades in maximum-likelihood
trees were compared by using the rearrangement optimization (Kishino-Hasegawa) method as implemented in the
ProtML program [34].
