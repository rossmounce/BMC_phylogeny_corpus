Abstract
Background: Previous DNA-based phylogenetic studies of the Delphinidae family suggest it has undergone rapid
diversification, as characterised by unresolved and poorly supported taxonomic relationships (polytomies) for some
of the species within this group. Using an increased amount of sequence data we test between alternative
hypotheses of soft polytomies caused by rapid speciation, slow evolutionary rate and/or insufficient sequence data,
and hard polytomies caused by simultaneous speciation within this family. Combining the mitogenome sequences
of five new and 12 previously published species within the Delphinidae, we used Bayesian and maximumlikelihood methods to estimate the phylogeny from partitioned and unpartitioned mitogenome sequences. Further
ad hoc tests were then conducted to estimate the support for alternative topologies.
Results: We found high support for all the relationships within our reconstructed phylogenies, and topologies
were consistent between the Bayesian and maximum-likelihood trees inferred from partitioned and unpartitioned
data. Resolved relationships included the placement of the killer whale (Orcinus orca) as sister taxon to the rest of
the Globicephalinae subfamily, placement of the Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) within the Globicephalinae
subfamily, removal of the white-beaked dolphin (Lagenorhynchus albirostris) from the Delphininae subfamily and
the placement of the rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis) as sister taxon to the rest of the Delphininae
subfamily rather than within the Globicephalinae subfamily. The additional testing of alternative topologies allowed
us to reject all other putative relationships, with the exception that we were unable to reject the hypothesis that
the relationship between L. albirostris and the Globicephalinae and Delphininae subfamilies was polytomic.
Conclusion: Despite their rapid diversification, the increased sequence data yielded by mitogenomes enables the
resolution of a strongly supported, bifurcating phylogeny, and a chronology of the divergences within the
Delphinidae family. This highlights the benefits and potential application of large mitogenome datasets to resolve
long-standing phylogenetic uncertainties.

Background
The mitochondrial genome is typically non-recombining,
has a relatively high substitution rate, and has a smaller
effective population size than the nuclear genome [1].
These properties can increase the probability of congruence between the mitochondrial gene tree and the species
tree, helping to resolve relationships between recently

divergent taxa [2]. Under some conditions, however, phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
sequence data can fail to resolve the relationships among
taxa into a fully bifurcating tree. Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that greater phylogenetic resolution
and bootstrap support for inter-specific nodes should be
achievable by increasing the amount of sequence data
[3-7]. Additionally, including sequence data from more
than one gene will reduce the influence of any variation
between genes in phylogenetic signal due to selection or
the effects of stochastic lineage sorting [8].

However, not all polytomic relationships are ‘soft’, and
some cannot be resolved by adding sequence data [9].
In some cases even complete mitochondrial genomes
have failed to resolve multifurcating relationships (e.g.,
[10]). Although unlikely [11], a ‘hard’ molecular polytomy could be the result of a true simultaneous speciation event into multiple daughter species [9,12-14]. Such
events could occur when multiple populations of an
ancestral species become simultaneously isolated during
periods of rapid environmental change [12]. Simultaneous adaptive radiation into multiple species could also
occur in sympatry due to intra-specific competition and
assortative mating if species occupy a narrow niche
width [15].
The use of high-throughput sequencing and pooled
tagging methods [16] has the potential to generate large
amounts of manifold-coverage sequence data for large
numbers of samples quickly and at a relatively low cost,
allowing improved resolution of phylogenetic relationships to be achieved routinely (e.g., [17]). Such an
approach can allow the differentiation between rapid and
simultaneous cladogenesis and, when combined with
additional tests, can determine if a molecular polytomy
reflects a true species polytomy (e.g., [18-20]).
Previous phylogenetic studies using a variety of markers have suggested an episodic rapid rate of speciation
within the Delphinidae family [21-28]. This has resulted
in several long-standing uncertainties in the phylogenetic
relationships within this group. Analysis of sequences of
the cytochrome b gene (1,140 bp) [21] led to a number of
suggested taxonomic revisions from previous classifications based on morphology [29]. However, a number of
these revisions had poor support and required further
analysis, e.g., the inclusion of Grampus griseus (Risso’s
dolphin), and removal of Orcinus orca (killer whale) from
the Globicephalinae subfamily, and the grouping of O.
orca with the genus Orcaella into a proposed Orcininae
subfamily. The genus Lagenorhynchus was found to be
polyphyletic, with L. albirostris and L. acutus removed
from the remaining four congeners and not found to be
closely related to each other [21]. There was high support
for paraphyly of the genera Tursiops and Stenella [21],
which has been subsequently strengthened by mitogenomic and multi-locus analyses [25,28]. More recent studies, which included both mtDNA and nuclear DNA
(nuDNA), suggested an additional revision of the placement of Steno bredanensis (rough-toothed dolphin) with
Orcaella [24,26]; however, another multi-locus study
grouped S. bredanensis with the Sotalia genus, consistent
with previous classifications [27]. These more recent analyses using both nuDNA and mtDNA [24,26,27] have
failed to confirm all of the revisions suggested by LeDuc
et al. [21] and have not produced consistent estimates of
relationships within this family. For example the ordering

Page 2 of 10

of the branches containing the species O. orca and
L. albirostris, and the subfamilies Delphininae, Globicephilinae, and Lissodelphininae has differed considerably
among studies [24,26,27]. In addition to being highly
variable, the placement of L. albirostris has typically been
one of the most weakly supported [21,26,27].
Here we estimate the phylogeny of Delphinidae using
complete mitogenomes generated using high-throughput
sequencing. This is the first time complete mitogenome
sequences have been published for five of the species,
and mitogenome sequences from a further three species
have previously only been used as outgroup species for
an intra-specific phylogenetic study on the killer whale
[17]. In total, mitogenome sequences from 17 of the 37
extant species within Delphinidae were included in the
analyses. This case study on a rapidly radiating group is
one of the first to test the power of large sequence datasets produced by parallel-tagged high-throughput
sequencing in combination with improved analytical
techniques to address long-standing phylogenetic uncertainties. Specifically we test three revisions suggested by
LeDuc et al. [21] regarding the placement of O. orca,
G. griseus, and L. albirostris, and a further suggested revision regarding the placement of S. bredanensis [24]. We
ultimately test the hypothesis that these uncertainties
result from a true species polytomy caused by simultaneous speciation.

Results and Discussion
Sequencing

In total 18 mitogenome sequences were generated for this
study, including multiple representatives per species. Eight
of these sequences were incomplete (spanning between
10,681 and 16,672 bp), Table 1; Additional file 1), however
at least 1 complete genome was sequenced for each species. The 10 complete sequences had on average 20× coverage of the whole mitogenome of approximately 16,445
bp. In combination with previously published mtDNA
genome sequences we were able to use this dataset to
reconstruct the most complete and highly resolved mitogenome phylogeny of Delphinidae to date (Figure 1).
Phylogenetic analyses

Phylogenetic estimates were consistent across Bayesian
and maximum-likelihood methods used in this study,
including partitioned and unpartitioned analyses on the
full data set, and a subset consisting of a single representative per species. With one exception we were able
to reject alternative topologies (Table 2). Based on Bayes
factors, we found strong support for allowing different
partitions of the mitogenome alignment to have distinct
evolutionary models in the phylogenetic analysis (see
Additional file 2). Although the harmonic-mean estimators of Bayes factors such as those implemented in the

software packages used here can be unreliable [30,31],
the magnitude of our estimated Bayes factors (see Additional file 2) make it unlikely that we have been misled
into selecting a suboptimal partitioning strategy for this
alignment. In the partitioned analysis, the mean substitution rate across the 12 protein-coding genes and 2
rRNA genes was 9.86 × 10-3 substitutions/site/My, with
a 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval of 8.45 ×
10-3 - 1.13 × 10-2 substitutions/site/My. The coefficient
of variations of rates was 0.527 (95% HPD interval 0.405
- 0.648), indicating the presence of substantial rate variation among lineages. The fastest data partition (third
codon sites) evolved at about 16.6 times the rate of the
slowest data partition (second codon sites).

Our analyses strongly support the placement by LeDuc
et al. [21] of Grampus griseus within the Globicephalinae
subfamily, a result that now finds wide support from a
range of different markers [24,26,27]. In contrast to
LeDuc et al.’s [21] revisions we were able to reject the
suggested grouping of Orcinus orca with Orcaella: the
proposed Orcininae subfamily. Instead we find that
O. orca is sister taxon to the rest of the Globicephalinae
subfamily, which also contains the Orcaella genus. We
were also able to reject the placement of Steno bredanensis in Globicephalinae as proposed by Caballero et al.
[24] and supported by McGowen et al. [26]. Traditionally, and based on morphology alone, S. bredanensis has
been placed in the subfamily Stenoninae with the genera

Sousa and Sotalia [29]. Sousa chinensis has since been
moved to the Delphininae subfamily and our analyses
suggest that S. bredanensis is sister taxon to the rest of
the species within this clade. Membership of these subfamilies appears to be supported by shared derived morphological characteristics, however, a thorough cladistic
morphological analysis at the genus level remains lacking.
Our analyses suggest Lagenorhynchus albirostris and
the Delphinidae family are sister taxa, but neither
approximately unbiased nor other topological tests
(weighted or unweighted Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests) were able to reject an alternative

topology (Table 2). However, maximum-likelihood bootstrap values and Bayesian posterior probabilities supported L. albirostris as the sister taxon of the Delphinidae
family (88.3% and 0.993 respectively), leaving only marginal support for the two alternative topologies tested
(Figure 2). The positioning of L. albirostris and the three
major Delphinidae subfamilies, Globicephalinae, Delphininae, and Lissodelphininae (not represented in our analyses), has been inconsistent among published studies
[e.g. [21,22,24,26,27]]. Such phylogenetic uncertainty suggests that this may represent a true species polytomy.
However, unlike previous studies, our positioning of

Tested alternative topologies are shown in Figure 2. Obs = observed log-likelihood difference to the best topology; au = approximately unbiased; np = bootstrap
probability of the topology (i.e., the probability that the given topology has the largest likelihood in 10 scaled sets of 10,000 bootstrap replicates); bp = np with
10 non-scaled sets of 10,000 bootstrap replicates; pp = Bayesian posterior probabilities of the model; kh = Kishino-Hasegawa; sh = Shimodeira-Hasegawa; wkh =
weighted KH; wsh = weighted SH.

L. albirostris had high support (Figure 1), and the support
of approximately unbiased tests for an alternative topology was only marginally significant (Table 2). Periods of
rapid environmental change can lead to rapid or even
simultaneous speciation events, which would result in a
hard polytomy [12]. Our time-calibrated mitogenomic
phylogeny placed the splitting of the three major subfamilies and L. albirostris during the late Miocene (11.6-5.3
Mya; Figure 1), a period of fluctuating temperature and
sea level [32]. This dating is consistent with the period
during which Steeman et al. [27] detected a significant
increase in net diversification rates within Delphinidae.
Therefore, we suggest that a rapid radiation during the
period of extreme environmental fluctuations in the late
Miocene best explains the lower support for the phylogenetic positioning of L. albirostris within Delphinidae.
Consistent with geographical distribution, morphological differences, and a high number of fixed differences
in the mtDNA control region [33], we found a deep
phylogenetic divergence between Orcaella brevirostris
and O. heinsohni (Figure 1). This divergence is dated to
the Pliocene (5.3-2.6 Mya; Figure 1), a period characterised by elevated cyclical fluctuations in sea temperatures and sea levels with an overall trend of cooling
temperatures and an increasing west-to-east sea surface
temperature (SST) difference across the equatorial Pacific [34-37]. Our data also indicate a rapid radiation of
the other extant species within the Globicephalinae subfamily during this period of climatic variation.
Caveats and recommended future work

The inclusion of nuDNA loci in some of the recent studies [24,26,27] may explain the incongruencies noted
above. The mitogenome is a single, maternally inherited,
haploid locus and might not wholly reflect the underlying

pattern of population divergence and lineage formation
(e.g., [38]). Nuclear genes can have greater resolving
power for deep-level phylogenetic inference [39] and,
when combined with whole mitogenomes, they have also
been able to improve resolution in cases of apparent
incomplete lineage sorting due to rapid radiations [40].
Historical hybridization is another potential source of
incongruence between mtDNA and nuDNA trees [2,12].
This is a particularly important factor to consider if the
Biological Species Concept rather than the Phylogenetic
Species Concept is being used to define species boundaries, as reproductive isolation is a key criterion for species status under the former [41].
A recent study based on the control regions of the
two pilot whale species, Globicephala melas and G.
macrorhynchus, found no support for reciprocal monophyly [42]. It was suggested that this could be due to
incomplete lineage sorting or a lack of sufficient data.
We found complete lineage sorting with high monophyletic support for all species for which we had multiple
representatives, including the two pilot whale species
(Figure 1). However, we had small sample numbers
from a limited geographical range for all taxa. Including
single or low numbers of representatives of each species
assumes that the individuals sequenced and included in
the phylogenetic analyses are representative of a reciprocally monophyletic clade [41]. However, increased sampling may reveal instances of paraphyly or polyphyly
[41]. Increased sampling and mitogenome sequencing,
such as conducted on the killer whale [17], is needed to
confirm complete lineage sorting for the remaining species included in this study. Increased taxon sampling,
such as the inclusion of the species within the Lissodelphininae, may also further reduce phylogenetic error
[7,43,44].

Conclusions
We have used complete mtDNA genome sequences to
resolve the phylogenetic relationships within the Delphinidae with high support. Future studies could apply
similar methods to resolve para- and polyphyletic genera, e.g., the four Lagenorhynchus species within the
subfamily Lissodelphininae [45]. Our study further supports previous empirical and theoretical studies [3-7],
that increasing sequence data can improve phylogenetic
resolution, even in species known to have undergone
rapid radiation in the recent past, and can help to discriminate between hard and soft polytomies. However,
some clades will remain unresolved, most likely due to
simultaneous speciation events [12]. With current highthroughput sequencing techniques, animal mitogenomes
can be sequenced relatively quickly and at low cost, and
are an attractive candidate for future phylogenetic analyses, particularly if combined with current analytical
tools that can aid in the reconstruction of challenging
phylogenies.
Methods
Sample collection, DNA extraction, amplification and
sequencing

Epidermal tissue was obtained by remote biopsying of
free-ranging animals [46] and stored in 20% dimethyl
sulphoxide (DMSO) saturated with salt [47].
Genomic DNA was extracted from epidermis using the
Qiagen DNeasy (Qiagen DNeasy, Valencia, CA, USA) kit
following the manufacturer’s guidelines. The mitochondrial genome was amplified in 3-5 overlapping amplicons
(dependent on DNA preservation) using previously published long-range PCR primers [17] and primers designed
specifically for this study (see Additional file 3). Additional sequencing primers were also designed for gap filling using conventional Sanger sequencing at the
commercial service offered by Macrogen (Seoul, South
Korea). Each 25 μl PCR contained 1 μl extracted DNA,
1× PCR buffer, 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.4 μM of each primer,
100 nM mixed dNTPs and 0.1 μl High Fidelity Platinum
Taq (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California). PCR amplifications were performed using an MJ Thermocycler with a
4 minute activation step at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of
94°C for 30 seconds, 62°C for 30 seconds, 68°C for 6 minutes 30 seconds, followed by a final extension period of
72°C for 7 minutes. For amplifications under 6 kb in size
the extension time was reduced to 3-5 minutes.
The amplified PCR products were purified using an
Invitek PCRapace purification kit (PCRapace, Invitek,
Berlin, Germany) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Products, Wilmington, DE) to
determine DNA concentration used to balance and pool
amplicons in equimolar ratios. Length of fragment, ratio

Page 7 of 10

of fragment lengths per individual, and DNA concentration was taken into account when balancing the samples.
Samples were either individually tagged according to
Meyer et al. [16] and built into shotgun sequencing
libraries following the manufacturer’s instructions (454
Life Sciences, Branford, CT), or grouped into sets of
8-10, where within each sample set individual libraries
were made to contain a different 10 bp multiplexing
identifier (MID) tag, allowing libraries to be combined
prior to emulsion PCR. Sequencing libraries were quantified by qPCR [16] and pooled at equimolar concentrations. Library pools were divided among regions on GS
FLX sequencing runs, using either LR70 or Titanium
chemistry (454 Life Sciences). Sequencing data was
parsed into individual extractions and identifier tags
were removed using a custom tag-removal Perl script
(M. Rasmussen, unpublished, University of Copenhagen).
Phylogenetic analyses

Sequences were assembled using gsMapper (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and aligned by
eye using SE-AL v2.0a11 (A. Rambaut, University of
Oxford), while Geneious (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland,
New Zealand) and Sequencher v4.8 (Genes Code Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI) were used to check coverage
and sequence reliability. Conspicuous indels, base position differences, and differences in homopolymeric
regions were double-checked and sequences with higher
coverage were generally given preference. In order to
ensure that the data was not affected by the erroneous
incorporation of nuclear pseudogenes (numts) we
visually assessed the recovered sequences for the presence of stop codons or frame-shift mutations in the
aligned protein-coding genes. We observed no evidence
that numts might be present in the data. This may be
explained by a combination of (a) the general difficulty
with PCR amplifying long amplicons, requiring relatively
high levels of template for successful amplication, and
thus (b) the fact that mtDNA template copy numbers
are much higher than those for nuDNA templates, leading to preferential mtDNA over nuDNA amplification.
A total of 35 mitogenome sequences were used in the
analyses, representing 21 species (Table 1). Of these, 18
mitogenomes were amplified and sequenced for this
study and 17 mitogenomes attained from Genbank
[17,30,48,49], which included 4 outgroup sequences (narwhal, Monodon monoceros; harbor porpoise, Phocoena
phocoena; Yangtze river dolphin, Lipotes vexillifer; Amazon river dolphin, Inia geoffrensis). The 18 generated
sequences consist of 5 species (pygmy killer whale, Feresa

Steno bredanensis) whose mitogenomes had not been
previously sequenced prior to this study.
A single representative mitogenome from each of the
21 species was used for the initial Bayesian phylogenetic
analysis and divergence date estimation. This step was
taken so that a speciation prior could be used for the
tree topology and node times. Sequences were aligned
and the 2 rRNA and 12 protein-encoding genes (excluding ND6) were used to form a data set comprising
13,958 sites. Stop codons were removed from all genes
and the control region was excluded from analysis due
to saturation, repetitive sequences, and alignment ambiguities. The resulting alignment was divided into four
partitions: first, second and third codon sites of the protein-coding genes (3,792 bp per partition), and rRNA
genes (2,582 bp). A comparison of Bayesian information
criterion values in Modelgenerator [50] were used to
find the optimal time-reversible substitution model for
each partition. This criterion has been found to perform
well in relation to other criteria used in evolutionary
model selection [51]. The selected models were GTR+I
+G for first and third codon sites, HKY+I+G for second
codon sites, and TN93+I+G for the rRNA partition. In
all cases, rate variation among sites was modelled using
a gamma distribution with six categories [52]. There
was little variation in the base frequencies across taxa
(see Additional file 4).
The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed
using BEAST v1.6 [53]. An uncorrelated lognormal
relaxed-clock model was used to allow rate variation
among branches [54]. A Bayes-factor analysis indicated
that this model received decisive support in comparison
to a strict-clock model. The four data partitions shared
the same relaxed clock but were allowed to have different relative rates. An exponential prior with a mean of
1/3 was used for the standard deviation of the lognormal distribution of rates, and a Yule prior was specified
for the tree topology and relative divergence times. To
enable the estimation of absolute divergence times in
the tree, four calibrations based primarily on fossil calibrations, along with estimated divergence dates from
published studies [27,28,55] (see Additional file 5), were
incorporated into the analysis. The calibrations were
implemented in the form of uniform prior distributions
for the ages of the four nodes, and monophyly was
enforced on the clades defined by these four nodes.
Posterior distributions of parameters, including the tree
topology and divergence times, were estimated by Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Samples were
drawn every 5,000 MCMC steps over a total of 50,000,000
steps. The first 10% of samples were discarded as burn-in.
Convergence to the stationary distribution and acceptable
mixing were investigated using the diagnostic software
Tracer v1.5 (Rambaut and Drummond, 2007, University of

Page 8 of 10

Oxford). From the set of posterior samples, the tree with
the highest product of clade credibilities was identified
and the branch lengths were rescaled to match mean
posterior estimates.
Additional phylogenetic analyses were performed in
order to examine the effect of data partitioning. First, the
analysis was repeated without data partitioning, so that
the protein-coding genes and the rRNA genes shared the
same substitution model and mean evolutionary rate.
Second, analyses were performed on three data sets in
which sites were randomly assigned to the four data
partitions mentioned earlier. Randomisation of sites
(sampling without replacement) was performed using the
Java application SiteSampler v1.1 [56] Support for the
different partitioning schemes was examined by assessing
Bayes factors, calculated using a harmonic-mean estimator in the software Tracer v1.6 [57,58].
A second set of phylogenetic analyses was performed
on the full dataset (35 mitogenomes), including multiple
representatives per species, coding missing data as N and
using data partitioning for each codon position, rRNA,
and control region. For each partition, the best model of
molecular evolution that was compatible with models
implemented in MrBayes 3.12 [59] was selected using the
Bayesian information criterion. The selected models were
TN93+I+G for the first and second codon sites, HKY+I
+G for third codon sites and the control region, and
HKY+I+G for the rRNA genes. Similar models were
recovered after RY-recoding a hypervariable part of the
control region (nucleotides 15556-15588 according to the
Globicephala macrorhynchus, Genbank accession number HM060334, reference mitogenome). Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed using the 5-partition
datasets (with and without RY-recoding of the control
region) using MrBayes 3.12 [59]. Posterior distributions
of parameters were estimated using two independent
MCMC analyses, each comprising one cold and three
heated chains. Samples from the posterior were drawn
every 1,000 steps over a total of 10 million steps, which
appeared to be sufficient to keep the average standard
deviation of split frequencies below the critical value of
0.01. The first 25% of samples were discarded as burn-in.
A majority-rule consensus tree was constructed from the
posterior sample of trees. A supplemental set of analyses
was performed with MrBayes 3.12 and PhyML 3.0 [60]
using an unpartitioned dataset under a GTR+I+G model
as selected using ModelTest [61] and Akaike Information
Criterion, with and without RY-recoding of the hypervariable segment of the control region. All analyses
yielded identical tree topologies and similar node support
values. For maximum-likelihood analyses, the strength of
the phylogenetic signal was assessed via non-parametric
bootstrapping with 250 pseudo-replicates. In addition,
using Consel 0.1 k [62] and site-wise likelihood values

recovered from PhyML analyses, levels of statistical support for alternative topologies were evaluated from the pvalues of approximately unbiased tests, weighted or
unweighted unilateral Kishino-Hasegawa and Shimodeira-Hasegawa tests, and bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probabilities for the selected topologies (Table 2). All
trees were drawn using Dendroscope [63].

Additional material
Additional file 1: Table showing number of sites used for analysis
post-partitioning of the 8 incomplete mitogenome sequences. The
complete mitogenome was not sequenced for eight of our samples and
therefore only partial mitogenomes were used in the analyses for these
eight samples. The exact lengths of these sequences and the number of
sites used in the analyses are given in this table.
Additional file 2: Bayes factor statistics of the tested partitioning
schemes. Partitioning schemes tested were unpartitioned, biologicallyinformed partitioned and randomly partitioned. For the randomly
partitioned data sets, the sizes of the four partitions were the same as
those in the biologically-informed partitions.
Additional file 3: Table of primers used in this study. The amplicon
of the three primer sets designed by Morin et al. 2010 were in some
difficult cases split into two, and two new primer sets were designed to
amplify shorter sequences. This table contains all primer sequences used
to amplify the mitogenome of samples used in this study, including
primer melting temperature and the position in the mitogenome of the
amplicons the primer set amplifies.
Additional file 4: Nucleotide frequencies for concatenated proteincoding genes, rRNA genes, and control region. Nucleotide frequencies
for concatenated genes and control region of each amplified
mitogenome, including number of sites and means. Taxon names have
in most cases been shortened to the first three letters of the genus
name followed by the first three letters of the species name, and the
sequences amplified in our lab is also followed by sample name.
Additional file 5: Fossil dates used for calibration of divergence
times in BEAST. Dates used to calibrate divergence times in BEAST
analysis including their reference. The divergence of Grampus griseus
from the other Globicephalinae is not based on fossil evidence but on
an estimate from Xiong et al.’s (2009) analyses.
