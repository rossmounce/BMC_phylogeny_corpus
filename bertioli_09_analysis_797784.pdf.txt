Abstract
Background: Most agriculturally important legumes fall within two sub-clades of the Papilionoid
legumes: the Phaseoloids and Galegoids, which diverged about 50 Mya. The Phaseoloids are mostly
tropical and include crops such as common bean and soybean. The Galegoids are mostly temperate
and include clover, fava bean and the model legumes Lotus and Medicago (both with substantially
sequenced genomes). In contrast, peanut (Arachis hypogaea) falls in the Dalbergioid clade which is
more basal in its divergence within the Papilionoids. The aim of this work was to integrate the
genetic map of Arachis with Lotus and Medicago and improve our understanding of the Arachis
genome and legume genomes in general. To do this we placed on the Arachis map, comparative
anchor markers defined using a previously described bioinformatics pipeline. Also we investigated
the possible role of transposons in the patterns of synteny that were observed.
Results: The Arachis genetic map was substantially aligned with Lotus and Medicago with most
synteny blocks presenting a single main affinity to each genome. This indicates that the last common
whole genome duplication within the Papilionoid legumes predated the divergence of Arachis from
the Galegoids and Phaseoloids sufficiently that the common ancestral genome was substantially
diploidized. The Arachis and model legume genomes comparison made here, together with a
previously published comparison of Lotus and Medicago allowed all possible Arachis-Lotus-Medicago
species by species comparisons to be made and genome syntenies observed. Distinct conserved
synteny blocks and non-conserved regions were present in all genome comparisons, implying that
certain legume genomic regions are consistently more stable during evolution than others. We

found that in Medicago and possibly also in Lotus, retrotransposons tend to be more frequent in the
variable regions. Furthermore, while these variable regions generally have lower densities of single
copy genes than the more conserved regions, some harbor high densities of the fast evolving
disease resistance genes.
Conclusion: We suggest that gene space in Papilionoids may be divided into two broadly defined
components: more conserved regions which tend to have low retrotransposon densities and are
relatively stable during evolution; and variable regions that tend to have high retrotransposon
densities, and whose frequent restructuring may fuel the evolution of some gene families.

Background
The legume family (Fabaceae) is one of the largest and
most diverse plant families and is considered to have its
origin in the tropics about 65–70 Myr ago [1]. The ability
of many legumes to fix nitrogen in association with rhizobia bacteria gives them special importance in natural environments and agriculture.
The family is divided into three subfamilies, Mimosoideae, Caesalpinoideae, and Papilionoideae. Most agriculturally important species fall within two Papilionoid subclades that diverged some 50 Myr ago, the Phaseoloids
and Galegoids. The Phaseoloids are an essentially tropical
group including bean, cowpea, soya, and pigeon pea. The
Galegoids are essentially temperate and include clover,
pea, lentil, fava bean, chickpea and the model legumes M.
truncatula and L. japonicus [1,2].
Two notable exceptions are lupin (Lupinus spp.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). They fall within the Genistoid and
Dalbergioid clades respectively, which are more basal in
their divergence within the Papilionoids than the Phaseoloids and Galegoids [2]. A simplified tree representation
of Papilionoid phylogeny is represented in Fig. 1.
Although the importance of lupin species is growing,
especially in Australia, the importance of peanut is much
greater. Global annual peanut production is about 36 million tonnes, with >90% being produced in the developing
world. It is of great social importance, especially in Africa,
and in Asia where it provides more calories than soya [3].
Cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid of recent origin,
with an AB genome. Its polyploidy and low genetic diversity have hampered advances in its genetics and genomics.
To avoid these problems we recently generated a map
from two diploid A-type genome relatives of peanut, A.
duranensis and A. stenosperma, the former being the most
probable A genome donor to peanut [4], [5], [6]. In this
work we aimed to align this map with the substantially
sequenced genomes of Lotus and Medicago and enhance
our understanding of the Arachis genome. In addition,
because of its out-group status (Fig. 1), the results were
likely to be informative about the structure and evolutionary history of legume genomes generally.

To compare genomes, orthologous loci need to be
mapped in the species of interest. Using single copy genes
facilitates the identification of orthologs, however, they
generally have low polymorphism, making marker development difficult. The solution is to target the more variable introns. Furthermore if polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) primers are designed to bind conserved sequences
that flank introns, they work in a range of species and
serve as a toolkit for the development of comparable
"anchor markers" across a range of plant species. Previously we developed software for the design of such primers and published a set of anchor markers ideally suited to
the comparison of legume genomes [7].
The level of synteny between two species depends upon
the genomic restructuring events that occurred since their
evolutionary divergence. Transposons have an important
role in such restructuring. During evolution, transposons
can undergo both massive amplifications and reductions
in number, inflating and reducing the size of genomic
regions. Also, the presence of transposons of almost identical sequence in multiple positions of a genome promotes recombination and genome restructuring.
Transposons are divided into two classes. Class I transposons, also known as retrotransposons, have a "copy and
paste" replication mechanism that involves an RNA intermediate. Class II transposons, also known as DNA transposons do not have an RNA intermediate, and usually
transpose by a "cut and paste" mechanism that does not
involve replication [8]. Retrotransposons are further
divided into two classes, those with Long Terminal
Repeats (LTR retrotransposons), and those without (nonLTR retrotransposons). LTR retrotransposons are the most
abundant transposons in plant genomes. Because of this,
and because of the special propensity of their terminal
repeats to promote recombination events, they are considered to have a special role in plant genome evolution [9].
Here we report the placement of 102 anchor markers on
the map of the Arachis A-genome and analyses of synteny
of Arachis with Medicago and Lotus. In addition, we investigated if there was a correlation between genome conservation and transposons. Finally, we briefly investigated

Marker development
Legume anchor markers were developed essentially as
described in [7]. Key features of the marker development
were:

Phaseoloids

Glycine
Phaseolus
Cajanus
Vigna

i) Identification of ESTs from multiple legume species,
usually Lotus, soya and Medicago, with single strong blast
detected sequence similarites against all predicted Arabidopsis proteins and the alignment of these ESTs.
ii) Alignment of ESTs to a corresponding genomic region
from Lotus or Medicago and inference of intron positions.
iii) Identification of conserved intron-flanking sequences,
and design of primers to bind these conserved sequences.
The rationale behind this procedure is that:

and the two subclades of the Galegoids; the Robinioids and the IRLC (plastid DNA Inverted Repeat Lacking Clade). Names of some notable genera are placed
within the triangles. Note that Arachis which is a member of
the Dalbergioids, represents a more basally diverged Papilionoid than the Galegoid legumes, and therefore serves as an
out-group to a Lotus vs. Medicago comparison. The figure is a
simplified and stylized phylogeny based on a tree in [2].

i) Markers to unique sequences within a genome facilitate
the comparison of genetic maps, and genes that are single
copy in Arabidopsis have a high probability of being single
copy in legume genomes (also see results).
ii) Introns are more variable than coding regions, and
therefore they are better for marker development.
iii) Primers that bind to sequences that are conserved are
more likely to be transferable to other species.
The primers were used in PCR with the progenitors of the
Arachis mapping population. Polymorphisms were identified by size- or sequence variation. In the latter case, most
markers developed were Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic
Sequence (CAPS) or derived Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence dCAPS [10].
Other markers used in map construction have been [4], or
will be, published elsewhere (unpublished data).
Genetic Mapping
Linkage analysis was done with Mapmaker Macintosh version 2.0 [11] essentially as described in [4].

Most of the Lotus Bacterial Artificial Chromosome/Transformation competent Bacterial Artificial Chromosome
(BAC or TAC) clones identified in blast searches using
Arachis marker sequences had been positioned on the
Lotus map based on the intraspecific cross between ecotypes Gifu and Miyakojima MG-20 [12]. Where a map
position was absent, or only a whole genome shotgun or
EST sequence was available, the corresponding BAC/TAC
clone was isolated and/or sequenced and mapped in Gifu
× MG-20 and/or in L. filicaulis × L. japonicus Gifu [13]. All
map positions are given with respect to the former map.
Tandem Repeat Occurrence Locator http://wsmartins.net/
webtroll/troll.html was used for identifying the microsatellites for genetic mapping.

Analysis of synteny
Points of correspondence of Arachis with the model legumes were assigned by using Arachis marker sequences as
queries in blast searches against the genome sequence and
genetic mapping for Lotus and, for Medicago, by blast similarity searches against the genome sequence using CViT
blast (Chromosome Visualization Tool, http://www.med
icago.org/genome/cvit_blast.php). For legume anchor
markers, and other markers with a single strong blast
detected sequence similarity to Arabidopsis predicted proteins in addition to the the Arachis nucleotide sequence,
we also used the Arabidopsis protein sequence in blastn,
tblastn and blastp searches. A single strong blast detected
sequence similarity was defined as E-value for the best
blast alignment being at least 106 times lower than the Evalue for the second best blast alignment.

Tables of correspondences between Arachis markers and
the model legume genomes were used in a Microsoft Excel
file, together with logical functions, to create plots of the
Arachis genetic map against Lotus and Medicago (Additional file 1).
In addition, to visualize a comparison of the Arachis
genome simultaneously with Medicago and Lotus, colored
coded blocks representing Arachis marker correspondences with Lotus and Medicago were placed along the sides
of Arachis LGs. Colors were assigned to the model legume
chromosomes following a rainbow spectrum along the X
and Y axes of the previously published Lotus vs. Medicago
genome plot [14], in such a way that corresponding
groups of Lotus and Medicago are represented by corresponding or neighboring colors in the spectrum (Fig. 2
and Additional file 2).
A synteny score was assigned to each point of correspondence between Arachis and the model legumes according to
its number of neighbors within a continuous color block.
For instance, the top marker in Arachis linkage group 9
(Ar9) has a Arachis-Lotus synteny score of 3, and the last

Analysis of transposon distributions
Lotus transposon sequences from a Kazusa Lotus transposon data set were used as a target blast database in RepeatMasker http://www.repeatmasker.org/, run on the Lotus
BAC/TAC sequences. Results were summarized as percentage sequence coverage for Class I and Class II transposons
for each BAC/TAC using Perl http://www.perl.org/. This
result, together with the genetic map positions of the
BAC/TACs was used to plot the retrotransposon distribu-

tions within the Lotus genome with values averaged over
10 cM window size (Fig. 3d).
Medicago Class I and Class II transposon sequences from
GIRI http://www.girinst.org/ were submitted to CViT
blast. The output was used to plot transposon distribution
along the Medicago genome with values averaged across a

Plant disease resistance gene homolog distributions
Lotus Kasuza gene annotations for Coiled-Coil – Nucleotide Binding Site – Leucine Rich Repeat (CNL) and Drosophila Toll and mammalian Interleukin (IL)-1 receptor –

with the genetic map positions of the BAC/TACs to plot
the gene class distributions with values averaged across a
10 cM window size (Fig. 3e).

For Medicago, consensus sequences of the extended NBS
domains from the CNL and the TNL subfamilies of plant
disease resistance genes from [15] were used in CViT blast
searches, and the distribution of blast detected similarites
(E-value ≤ 1E-20) plotted on the Medicago genome with
values averaged over 6 Mbp window size (Fig. 3b).

Results
Marker development
Introns in anchor genes showed high levels of polymorphism between the progenitors of the Arachis mapping
population (c. 1 single nucleotide polymorphism/90 bp
and 1 insertion/deletion polymorphism/1.6 kbp). Eighty
seven intron-based anchor markers were developed and
genotyped, most being CAPS or dCAPS (Additional file
3).
Mapping
Using a minimum LOD score of 3.0 and a maximum
recombination fraction (θ) of 0.35, 351 markers mapped
into 10 linkage groups (LGs). Of the 87 legume anchor
markers genotyped, 81 were assigned to a LG. In addition,
21 other sequence characterized mapped markers were
homologs of single copy genes in Arabidopsis and thus
were effective anchors, making a total of 102 mapped
anchor markers. Anchor markers were distributed through
all of the LGs, except the smallest, Ar10. Most other
mapped markers are microsatellites or sequence characterized AFLP.

LGs were numbered according to [4], however, the inclusion of new markers resulted in 10 LGs, corresponding to
the number of chromosome pairs in Arachis, instead of
the previous 11.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/45

Synteny analysis
Of the legume anchor markers, only six (Leg050, Leg168,
Leg33MGm, Leg20MGm, Leg069, Leg034), had strong
multiple affinities to the Lotus genome and four to the
Medicago genome (LegTC987, Leg202, Leg304, Leg299).
This clearly implies that anchor marker genes (represented
in a single copy in Arabidopsis) tend to also be represented
as single copy genes in the model legumes making them
ideal markers for the comparison of genomes.

Using sequence information from the 102 anchor markers
and 228 other mapped and sequence characterized markers, we were able to make 128 and 126 points of correspondence between Arachis and Medicago and Lotus
respectively.
Following the previously published dot plot presentation
of genome similarity between Lotus and Medicago [14],
Arachis homologies with the model legumes mostly corresponded to regions within the main axis of the Lotus vs.
Medicago genome plot. The color scheme used in Fig. 2
(and Additional file 2), where corresponding model legume chromosomes match, facilitates the simultaneous
visualization of Arachis homologies with the model legumes. For instance, Medicago chromosome 1 (Mt1) and
Lotus LG5 (Lj5) are syntenic, are the first in their genetic
map/genome orders in the dot plots, and thus have a red
color code. Ar9 has a predominance of correspondences
with Mt1 and Lj5 which is therefore also placed first in the
order for the dot plots. The predominance of "red" associations of Ar9 in Fig. 2 (and Additional file 2) makes this
easily visible. Similarly, progressing through Ar8, Ar4,
Ar6, Ar10, Ar3, Ar2, Ar1, Ar7 and Ar5 the main affinities
with the model legumes roughly follow through the spectrum with the last, Ar5, having predominantly violet (Lj2,
Mt5) affinities. The main exception to this is the lower
region of Ar8 which has Mt2 – Lj3 affinities. This region
corresponds to the main off-axis region of synteny in the
Arachis vs. Lotus plot, and which we named synteny block
11 (SB11).
The affinities of Arachis LGs and Lotus chromosomes in
the plot shows a diagonal tendency (Fig. 3f), although a
number of factors make the diagonal less clear than for
the Arachis vs. Medicago plot (see below): i) Areas of suppressed recombination in Lj6, and the top of Lj1, creates
vertical lines of points in the Ar4 – Lj6 and Lj1 – Ar8
squares, if physical instead of genetic distances could have
been used, diagonal lines or clusters could well have been
formed. ii) There is a substantial off-axis Ar8 – Lj3 cluster
in the plot (SB11), this cluster presumably reflects an
ancient translocation event, and apparently corresponds
to an off-axis area (Mt2 – Lj3) in the Lotus vs. Medicago plot
[14]. iii) Lack of resolution in some regions of the genetic
maps means that some points are superimposed, for

Page 6 of 11

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:45

instance the Arachis vs. Lotus region SB2 appears to be supported only by two points in the plot, but in fact is supported by four (Fig. 2 and Additional files 1 and 2).
Nevertheless, for most of the Arachis LGs the overall affinities are clear, co-linearities are visible between Ar6 and
the lower portion of Lj1, and between Lj2 and Ar7. Some
areas of the plot show double associations: for instance
Ar6 and Ar2 with the bottom of Lj1; and the bottom of
Ar2 and the top of Ar1 with the middle of Lj4.
Points of correspondence between Arachis and Medicago
are all from blast searches of the pseudomolecules of Medicago genome. This approach is an alternative to the direct
comparison of linkage positions used in the Arachis-Lotus
comparison. These two somewhat different approaches
were used because of the different forms of the data from
the genome projects, and because the Lotus vs. Arachis
comparison was partly based on blast searches against
genome data and partly on genetic mapping. Correspondences between Arachis LGs and Medicago chromosomes
were found in seven of the 10 Arachis LGs. Of the remaining three, two (Ar4 and Ar2) have "shattered", or fragmented, synteny. The remaining Ar10 shows no clear
affinities, although it has been tentatively assigned a position within the genome plot according to two blast
detected sequence similarities with Medicago. The plot of
Arachis LGs vs. Medicago chromosomes shows a diagonal
tendency (Fig. 3a). There are two apparent regions of colinearity: lower region Mt2 – central region Ar8; lower
region Mt5 – lower region Ar7. In the remainder of the
plot, points often cluster within squares. The clearest
example being Ar6 – Mt7: intra-chromosomal rearrangements since the Arachis – Medicago evolutionary divergence have disrupted co-linearity, but a clear Ar6 – Mt7
correspondence is preserved.
The plots of Lotus vs. Medicago [14], of Arachis vs. Lotus,
and of Arachis vs. Medicago (Fig. 3a, 3f) show interesting
similarities. For instance, Ar6, the bottom of Lj1 and the
bottom of Mt7 all show good synteny with each other –
the region has maintained high levels of synteny over
some 55 Myr of evolutionary divergence. In contrast, the
bottom of Ar4, the top of Mt7, and the middle of Lj1 all
show relatively poor synteny with each other. This pattern
is repeated and most of the synteny blocks (SBs) visible in
the Lotus vs. Medicago plot are visible in Arachis vs. Medicago and Arachis vs. Lotus plots (Figs. 2, 3a, 3f). Furthermore, most model legume chromosome regions that lack
detectable synteny in the model legume plot, also lack
synteny in the Arachis vs. model legume plots. Overall, in
the Arachis vs. Lotus plot the following SBs are detected, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. For the Arachis vs. Medicago plot the
following SBs could be identified, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
SB1 which consists of synteny between the upper regions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/45

of Mt1 and Lj5 could not be detected in either of the Arachis plots. (Figs. 2, 3).
In addition to the synteny blocks previously identified in
the Lotus vs. Medicago comparison, an unnumbered offaxis region of synteny visible in the Lotus vs. Medicago plot
was also apparent in the Arachis vs. model legumes plots.
This region consisting of Ar8 – Mt2 – Lj3 affinities was
named SB11.
An Excel file with all marker data, synteny information

Analysis of transposon, single copy genes and disease
resistance gene homolog distributions and synteny with
Arachis in Lotus
DNA transposons on average cover 10.4% of both
mapped and unmapped Lotus BAC/TACs. The distribution
is uneven, varying from 6.1% to 14.2% when averaged
over 10 cM windows. Retrotransposons are more abundant, covering on average 19.4% of mapped TACs/BACs
and 25.6% of unmapped clones, and are more unevenly
distributed, varying from 5.9% to 35.8%, averaged over
10 cM windows. There is a negative correlation between
retrotransposon coverage in the genome and synteny
score with Arachis (values averaged over 10 cM window
size; r = -0.22; Fig. 3d). Retrotransposon coverage is very
high (c. 30%) in Lotus in exactly the region of the missing
synteny block SB1 (Fig. 3d).

To study gene distributions we focused on two groups of
genes with distinct evolutionary pressures: single copy
genes, the distribution of which was already apparent
from the distribution of anchor marker correspondences,
and one of the highest copy number and best characterised of plant gene families, nucleotide binding site encoding resistance gene homologs; Coiled-Coil – Nucleotide
Binding Site – Leucine Rich Repeat (CNL) and Drosophila
Toll and mammalian Interleukin (IL)-1 receptor – Nucleotide Binding Site Leucine Rich Repeat (TNL) gene subclasses [15].
In Lotus the density of anchor marker, and hence of single
copy gene, correspondences with Arachis is not evenly distributed; synteny blocks tend to have higher densities of
anchor markers and hence single copy genes (anchor
markers, are shown as red lines across LGs in Fig. 2, as red
marker names in the expanded version of Fig. 2 presented
in Additional file 2, and by solid red dots in Fig. 3a, 3f).
The analysis of resistance gene homologs showed that, in
the currently available Lotus genome sequence [16] there

Page 7 of 11

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:45

are 54 CNL and 174 TNL genes encoding disease resistance gene homologs. Of these, 33 CNL and 54 TNL are in
mapped TACs and BACs, and the remainder in unmapped
clones or whole genome sequence. These genes are not
evenly distributed and tend to form clusters, for instance
in the upper region of Lj3 and the lower region of Lj2. A
number of these clusters are located within regions of
high retrotransposon densities. For instance, in the upper
region Lj3 there are 13 TNL and 4 CNL encoding genes
and in the top of Lj3 there are five CNL encoding genes
(Fig. 3e). Overall there was no correlation of CNL genes
and retrotransposons, however, the correlation coefficient
of TNL genes and retrotransposons was 0.2.
Analysis of transposon and disease resistance gene
homolog gene family distributions and synteny with
Arachis in Medicago
In Medicago there are about 2.8 retrotransposons to each
DNA transposon. LTR retrotransposons outnumber nonLTR retrotransposons by about 16 fold. Retrotransposons
are very unevenly distributed in the Medicago genome
sequence. There is a clear tendency that Medicago regions
with high synteny scores with Arachis have low retrotransposon density, and that regions with low synteny scores
have high retrotransposon densities (Fig. 3c). The Correlation coefficient of synteny score and density of blast
detected retrotransposon sequence similarities (E-value ≤
1E-60) per 6 Mb of Medicago genome was -0.35. Retrotransposon densities are moderately high in Medicago in
exactly the region of the missing synteny block SB1 – the
top of Mt1 (Fig. 3a, 3c, ref [14]).

In Medicago, as was the case in Lotus, the density of the
anchor marker correspondences with Arachis is not evenly
distributed; there is a trend that synteny blocks have
higher densities of anchor markers, and hence of single
copy genes (Fig. 2, 3 and Additional files 1 and 2).
In the Medicago genome sequence, there are 177 CNL and
156 TNL encoding sequences [15]. Of these, four CNLs
and two TNLs are on unmapped BACs. The genes are not
evenly distributed and tend to be clustered. Particularly
striking are two superclusters, much higher in copy
number than any cluster identified in Lotus (Fig. 3b, note
that the scale for resistance gene homolog distributions in
Medicago and Lotus are different). One of these superclusters is mostly of CNL encoding sequences at the top of
Mt3, and one of TNL encoding sequences at the bottom of
Mt6 [15]. The Mt3 supercluster contains 73 CNL and 9
TNL encoding sequences, the Mt6 supercluster contains
57 TNL encoding sequences. Other lower copy number
clusters are also apparent, for instance on Mt4, Mt8 and
Mt5, these clusters are more similar in copy number to the
clusters observed in Lotus. The correlation coefficients of
TNL and CNL encoding sequences with retrotransposons
are 0.39 and 0.33 respectively.

Plots of the overall profiles of synteny with Arachis and
retrotransposons in the Medicago and Lotus genomes
The comparison of the plots of synteny score with Arachis
and retrotransposon density along the genomes of Medicago and Lotus shows similarites in the patterns of the
peaks within corresponding groups (Fig. 3c, 3d). The profiles of synteny with Arachis plotted along the model legume genomes is most conserved, with a similarity of
peaks (corresponding to synteny blocks) both with
respect to positions and even relative heights. The main
exception being that the order of the synteny blocks that
are off-axis in the genome plots (SB7 and SB11) is
changed. These rearrangements presumably correspond
to chromosome translocation events in one of the three
evolutionary lines leading to the model legumes and Arachis. Peak structure of retrotransposon densities is similar
especially when considering the time of evolutionary
divergence between Lotus and Medicago. However, relative
peak heights of retrotransposon densities are markedly
different, for instance while the highest retrotransposon
concentrations in Medicago are at the top of Mt3 and the
lower portion of Mt6, the highest densities in Lotus are in
the non-corresponding groups Lj5, Lj3 and Lj4.

Discussion
Integrated maps that link crop and model plants allow
knowledge gained from independent research on different plants to be accumulated [17]. This work links the
genetic map of peanut, one of the world's most important
grain legumes, to the model legumes Lotus and Medicago,
a first step for its inclusion in an integrated genetic system
for legumes.
Genome restructuring progressively breaks down syntenic
relationships between species over evolutionary time. In
addition, whole genome duplications occur periodically
during plant evolution, followed by progressive diploidization [18]. These events split and obfuscate syntenic relationships. For the legumes, useful levels of synteny have
been shown between the Galegoid models and the Phaseoloids, which diverged some 50 Myr ago [19], [20], [21].
However, between the models and the more basally
diverged Genistoid lupin, syntenic relationships are more
complex [22,23]. The divergence of the Dalbergioid clade
to which Arachis belongs is placed at a similar, or slightly
later, date in evolutionary time than the divergence of the
Genistoids. Therefore the degree to which we could detect
macro-synteny between the models and Arachis was
uncertain.
Initial inspection of the Arachis vs. model legume plots
show surprising degrees of synteny considering the time
of species divergence. Although there are some regions of
double affinities between Arachis and the model legumes,
most synteny blocks have a single main affinity and not
two affinities interleaved (Figs. 2, and 3). These patterns
Page 8 of 11

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:45

indicate that the last universal legume whole genome
duplication predated the divergence of Arachis from the
Galegoids and Phaseoloids sufficiently that the common
ancestral genome was substantially diploidized. Synteny
at the macro-level between Arachis and the model legumes
will be useful for many genomic regions.
The different cross-species plots showed fascinating similarities, and the power of the Arachis out-group (Fig. 1)
allows new inferences to be made: In the Lotus vs. Medicago genomic plot [14] distinct conserved synteny blocks
and non-conserved regions are observed. To explain this,
we could hypothesize rearrangements/deletions within
the non-conserved regions, either in Medicago or Lotus, or
in both. Although either explanation is possible, the philosophical principle of Ockham's razor guides us to prefer
the simplest explanation: that regions lack synteny due to
disruption in Medicago or Lotus but not both. However,
with the addition of the Arachis out-group, the power of
inference is increased: we see similar patterns of synteny
(and disruption) in all possible species by species comparisons (with the notable exception of SB1). Therefore, the
evidence from the Arachis out-group strongly argues
against the simplest explanation for patterns of Medicago
and Lotus synteny and disruption. The inference, instead,
is that certain legume genomic regions are consistently
more stable during evolution than others. Additional evidence for this was found in our recently completed study,
where 104 anchor markers mapped in bean are used to
detect genomic regions that are syntenic with Lotus, Medicago and Arachis. In this study, large syntenic segments are
also found to be conserved between all species. These syntenic segments correspond to synteny blocks 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10 and 11 (the latter consisting of a block of bean
LG5 – Lj3 – Mt2 – Ar8 associations). SB1 and SB5 are also
evident, but the former is small, covering only 2.3 cM in
LG1 of bean, and the latter is fragmented into three sections covering bean LG1 and LG6 ([21]; Arachis vs. bean
marker correspondences from this reference are also summarized in Additional file 1).
We sought an explanation for these observations and
began by analyzing transposon distributions in Lotus and
Medicago. We found that retrotransposons are very unevenly distributed in both the model legume genomes and
that the retrotransposon-rich regions tend to correspond
to variable regions, intercalating with the synteny blocks
(Fig. 3c, 3d). This tendency is particularly evident for Medicago, its higher retrotransposon content [14], and higher
proportion of anchored BACs compared to Lotus may
account for this. Overall, considering the time of evolutionary divergence, the patterns of synteny blocks, variable regions and retrotransposon distributions are
substantially similar. In addition, it is notable that SB1,
which is conserved between Medicago and Lotus, but was

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/45

not evident between Arachis and the model legumes, is
positioned on local peaks in the densities of retrotransposons in the model legumes. Considering this, we suggest that the euchromatic gene space of the model
legumes, and by inference possibly most Papilionoid legumes, can be divided into two broadly defined components: regions that remain relatively stable, and regions
that experience high rates of genome restructuring. The
former tend to be syntenic across taxa and to have low retrotransposon densities, and the latter tend to show little
synteny, and to have high retrotransposon densities. The
proposed genome model is similar to the pan-genome
concept, originally from bacteria but recently suggested
for plants [24]. It should be noted that this model appears
consistent with the data used here, from diploid genomes.
However, plants which have undergone rapid genome
restructuring after polyploidy, such as soya, may differ.
In comparing syntenic and more variable regions, another
trend seems clear. Variable regions have lower densities of
anchor-marker correspondences and therefore single copy
genes (Figs. 2, 3a, 3f). However, regions without synteny
are not simply "holes" in the dot plot, because there are
correspondences in these regions; but they are scattered.
In contrast to the low concentrations of single copy genes,
some of the retrotransposon rich regions in the model legumes host high densities of some genes in multigene families, and we illustrated this with the plant disease
resistance gene homologs.
The fast evolving nature of the repetitive fraction of the
genome has been documented in many plant species. This
evolution involves rapid expansions and reductions in
transposon numbers [25], such that, for instance, even
closely related species of Arachis can be distinguished
using whole genome in-situ hybridization [6]. Therefore,
it seems likely that the restructuring within the variable
regions, which tend to be transposon rich, frequently
includes amplification of some sequences and elimination of others ("birth and death"). Considering this, it
would be expected that natural selection would tend to
select against single copy or essential genes, and high densities of transposons inhabiting the same genomic
regions. On the other hand, it may be expected that the colocalization of certain fast-evolving multigene families
and high densities of transposons could be advantageous.
The presence of high densities of resistance gene
homologs, a gene family for which rapid birth and death,
and frequent diversifying selection has been well established, in some of the variable retrotransposon rich
regions, supports this view. A detailed phylogenetic analysis of NBS-LRR genes in Medicago also provides support
to the hypothesis that restructuring in the variable regions
has driven the evolution of some resistance gene clusters;
NBS-LRR encoding genes in retrotransposon rich regions

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:45

are, on average, more recent in origin, and have more
unusual domain rearrangements than those in synteny
blocks [15].
Retrotransposon rich genomic regions may play a similar
role in legumes as in trypanosomes, where they interrupt
synteny and are associated with gene family expansions
and the evolution of new gene diversity [26,27]. The legume retrotransposon rich regions may also be similar to
pericentromeres, exceptional genomic regions that are
also retrotransposon rich: in animals they contain segmental duplications implicated in gene creation, and in
plants they harbor rearrangements and insertions uncommon in euchromatin [28]. However, the size of the retrotransposon rich regions described here, extending in some
cases to entire or nearly entire euchromatic chromosome
arms, and the association of some of them with disease
resistance genes, seems notable. For applied science, the
presence of clusters of resistance gene homologs in
regions of low synteny also has important implications.
Synteny between genomes may often not enable predictions of the locations of orthologous resistance genes,
although the genome model presented here may aid in
the identification of the resistance genes for which synteny is more likely to be preserved.

Conclusion
In summary, we have presented evidence that the last
whole genome duplication within the legumes preceded
the divergence of Arachis and the model legumes. We also
show that levels of macrosynteny between Arachis and the
model legumes within ten synteny blocks will be useful
for studies of Arachis, for instance, to aid in gene cloning
and candidate gene identification. We also show that the
retrotransposon profile in the model legumes is negatively correlated with the maintenance of macrosynteny
during legume evolution, and that a very substantial percentage of gene space lies outside identifiable synteny
blocks. We suggest that the gene space in Papilionoids
may be divided into two broadly defined components:
regions that are more conserved in evolution which tend
to have low retrotransposon densities; and variable
regions that tend to be retrotransposon rich, and whose
frequent restructuring may fuel the evolution of plant disease resistance genes and perhaps other multigene
familes.
