Abstract
Background: Molecular identification of Mycobacterium species has two primary advantages when
compared to phenotypic identification: rapid turn-around time and improved accuracy. The information
content of the 5' end of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA) is sufficient for identification of most
bacterial species. However, reliable sequence-based identification is hampered by many faulty and some
missing sequence entries in publicly accessible databases.
Methods: In order to establish an improved 16S rDNA sequence database for the identification of clinical
and environmental isolates, we sequenced both strands of the 5' end of 16S rDNA (Escherichia coli
positions 54 to 510) from 199 mycobacterial culture collection isolates. All validly described species (n =
89; up to March 21, 2000) and nearly all published sequevar variants were included. If the 16S rDNA
sequences were not discriminatory, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequences (n = 84) were
also determined.
Results: Using 5'-16S rDNA sequencing a total of 64 different mycobacterial species (71.9%) could be
identified. With the additional input of the ITS sequence, a further 16 species or subspecies could be
differentiated. Only Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species, M. marinum / M. ulcerans and the M. avium
subspecies could not be differentiated using 5'-16S rDNA or ITS sequencing. A total of 77 culture
collection strain sequences, exhibiting an overlap of at least 80% and identical by strain number to the
isolates used in this study, were found in the GenBank. Comparing these with our sequences revealed that
an average of 4.31 nucleotide differences (SD ± 0.57) were present.
Conclusions: The data from this analysis show that it is possible to differentiate most mycobacterial
species by sequence analysis of partial 16S rDNA. The high-quality sequences reported here, together with
ancillary information (e.g., taxonomic, medical), are available in a public database, which is currently being
expanded in the RIDOM project http://www.ridom-rdna.de), for similarity searches.

Background
Reliable microbial identification using conventional
methods often requires several techniques, such as the use
of colony morphology, gram staining, determination of
nutritional requirements and/or biochemical reactions.
Identification of mycobacteria at the species level using
conventional biochemical tests is laborious with a long
turn-around time, leading to significant delays in diagnosis and ambiguous results occur frequently. Other methods based on lipid analysis, such as high-performance
liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography and
gas-liquid chromatography are used only in a few clinical
laboratories [1–3]. Identification using molecular techniques, on the other hand, provides two primary advantages when compared to phenotypic identification: a
more rapid turn-around time and improved accuracy in
identification [4–6]. With assays based on molecular techniques, the genetic targets vary, as does the method of target characterization. Three targets that have proven useful
in identification are the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rDNA)
gene [7–10], the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region
[11] and the hsp65 gene [12–14]. The main advantage of
16S rRNA gene analysis is that it can be applied in the
identification of all bacteria, even those which are dead or
are uncultivable [15,16]. The ITS region has a greater discriminatory power than the 16S rDNA, but does not allow
the recognition and the reliable phylogenetic placement
of species not previously described. The most common
method of target characterization is amplification, followed by either probe hybridization, restriction fragment
length polymorphism analysis, or sequencing. Although
sequence analysis requires more specialized equipment
than the other methods, this technology is becoming less
expensive and provides the highest level of resolution and
portability. Sequencing of the 16S RNA gene is therefore
regarded as the most suitable method for identification of
mycobacteria in the clinical laboratory setting [5,6,17].
Existing sequence databases and analytical tools (e.g., the
National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI]
GenBank and the Ribosomal Database Project [RDP]
[18,19]) are not optimal for accurate identification of
clinically relevant microorganisms. The deficiencies in the
contents of these databases include the presence of ragged
sequence ends (resulting in wrong 'best' matches in similarity searches), faulty sequence entries (due to errorprone sequencing techniques used earlier, e.g., reverse
transcriptase sequencing), absence of quality control of
sequence entries, noncharacterized entries, outdated
nomenclature, and the lack of type strains pertaining to
many clinically important microorganisms. Furthermore,
search results are not presented in a user-friendly manner.
Our ribosomal differentiation of microorganisms
(RIDOM) project attempts to overcome these problems
[20–22].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/26

Sequencing the entire 16S rDNA is not a practical method
for routine identification. However, the information content of the 5' end of the gene is sufficient for specific identification of most Mycobacterium species (i.e., only one
sequencing run) [7]. Therefore, in order to establish an
improved 16S rDNA reference sequence database for the
identification of clinical isolates, we sequenced both
strands of the 5'-16S rDNA (Escherichia coli position 54–
510) from 199 mycobacterial isolates. All validly
described species (n = 89; up to March 21, 2000) and
nearly all published sequevar variants were included. If
the 16S rDNA sequences were not discriminatory (i.e., different and unique), the ITS region sequences were also
determined. The ultimate goal of this study was to come
up with an algorithm for genetic differentiation of all
mycobacteria, using insertion element and gyrB PCRs in
addition to rRNA operon sequencing, when the latter target was not discriminatory enough.
(This study was presented in part at the 101st General
Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology,
Orlando, Florida, 20 to 24 May 2001.)

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
The strains investigated in this study are listed in Table 1
(see Additional file Table 1). Culture collection isolates,
including the type strains, were used in this analysis when
available. Most strains were cultivated on LöwensteinJensen media at 28°C and 37°C. Mycobacterium haemophilum was cultivated on Löwenstein-Jensen media with
factor X strips (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany),
whereas M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was cultured on
Middlebrook-Cohn 7H10 agar with OADC and mycobactin enrichment. M. genavense was grown in broth media
(BACTEC 13A medium, Becton Dickinson). For some isolates, only DNA and no culture was available (see Table 1
footnotes, e.g., M. leprae or M. lepraemurium). All isolates
with missing sequence entries in public databases or with
sequence discrepancies detected by GenBank BLAST
searches were additionally identified using extensive conventional biochemical methods [1]. At least two different
culture collection strains from these species were included
in this study.
In vitro amplification and DNA sequencing of the 16S
ribosomal RNA genes and its region
A loopful of bacterial cells for extraction of DNA was
washed with distilled water and incubated in 200 µl TE
buffer (Tris-HCl, 10 mM; EDTA, 1 mM; pH 7.0) for 30
min at 80°C. The DNA was extracted with N-cetyl-N-, N,
N-trimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB)/NaCl according
to the protocol of van Embden et al. [23]. The final DNA
precipitate was suspended in 200 µl TE buffer and stored
frozen (-20°C) until PCR was performed. Two microliters

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/26

of this suspension (approximately 10 ng of DNA) were
used for PCR amplifications. PCR was performed in a total
volume of 50 µl containing 200 µM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), 10 pmol of
each primer, 5 µl of 10-fold concentrated PCR buffer (100
mM Tris-HCl; 500 mM KCl; 15 mM MgCl2; pH 8.3), and
1 U of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems,
Weiterstadt, Germany). Thermal cycling reactions consisted of an initial denaturation (80°C, 5 min) followed
by 28 cycles of denaturation (94°C, 45 s), annealing
(53°C for both 16S rDNA- and ITS-PCR, 1 min), and
extension (72°C, 90 s), with a single final extension
(72°C, 10 min). The broad-range primers 16S-27f (5'AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG -3') and 16S-907r (5'CCG TCA ATT CMT TTR AGT TT -3') were used for 16S
ribosomal DNA PCR. The universal primers 16S-1511f
(5'- AAG TCG TAA CAA GGT ARC CG -3') and 23S-23r
(5'- TCG CCA AGG CAT CCA CC -3') were used for amplification of the ITS region. Identical or near-identical
primer binding sites have already been described by Lane
[24]. Reactions took place in a dedicated automated DNA
thermal cycler (GeneAmp 2400, Applied Biosystems). In
order to control for the presence of contaminating nucleic
acids, controls containing water in place of template
DNA, were run in parallel in each run. The amplicons
were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator V2.0 Ready
Reaction Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The
sequencing reaction required 2 µl of Premix, 5 pmol of
sequencing primer and 0.2 µg of the PCR product template in a total volume of 10 µl. For sequencing 16S rDNA
either the primer 16S-27f or 16S-519r (5'- GWA TTA CCG
CGG CKG CTG -3') were used both with annealing temperature of 53°C. For sequencing ITS either the primer
16S-1511f or 23S-23r was employed, with an annealing
temperatures of 55°C and 51°C, respectively. All
sequencing reactions were performed using the GeneAmp
2400 system with 25 cycles of denaturation (96°C, 10 s),
annealing (temperature depending on the sequencing
primer used, 5 s), and extension (60°C, 4 min). The
sequencing products were purified using the recommended Centri-Sep Spin Columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ), followed by preparation for running
onto the ABI Prism 377 or 310 Genetic Analyzer, in
accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer
(Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences for both
DNA strands were determined. Ambiguities were resequenced and at least 98% percent of the complete doublestranded sequences of the 16S rDNA and ITS targets were
obtained.

sequencing of PCR products of these isolates was therefore not possible. PCR products of these strains were separated on an agarose gel and the first band, larger than 200
bp, was cut and cleaned with the Jetsorb Gel Extraction kit
(Genomed, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany). The cleaned
DNA was subcloned in a plasmid vector with the TOPO
TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to
the recommendations of the manufacturer. Transformed
Escherichia coli strains were cultured and crude DNA
extractions were performed by heating and centrifugation.
PCRs with M13 primers were run with an aliquot of the
supernatant and the PCR products of three subclones each
were sequenced as stated above.

Subcloning of PCR products
M. celatum isolates exhibit 16S rDNA interoperon variability. Furthermore, several fast growing mycobacteria
contain ITS operons which differ in length and/or base
composition (Table 1, explanatory footnotes). Direct

Results

Analysis of the ribosomal DNA sequences and statistical
analysis
The sequencing output from the ABI Prism Genetic Analysers was analysed using the Sequence Navigator version
1.0.1 computer software (Applied Biosystems). The
region from base positions 54 to 510 (corresponding to E.
coli 16S rDNA positions) for the 16S rDNA and the complete ITS were further analysed. Sequences from primer
regions were not included in this analysis. The MegAlign
(version 3.11) component of the Lasergene program
(DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) was used for multiple
alignment and phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence
alignments were determined using the CLUSTAL W algorithm. Spearman's rank correlation test, a non-parametric
measure of the degree of association between two numerical values, was used to access the correlation between the
means of base differences (i.e., differences between GenBank and RIDOM sequence data) stratified by years and
the GenBank submission date. The StatView version 5.0
statistical software package was used to calculate the
Spearman's rank correlation (rs) and the significance of
association (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RIDOM implementation
We have recently changed the uniform resource locator
(URL) of our RIDOM service (from http://www.ridom.de
to
http://www.ridom-rdna.de)
and
substantially
improved the implementation. Main backend components of RIDOM include the PHRED/PHRAP, FASTA and
CLUSTAL W programs that are embedded into Java Servlets [25–27]. In order to view the sequence
chromatograms in the new "Trace Editor", client computers need to have a recent version of a standard WWW
browser (Netscape or IE version 4 or higher) and Sun's
Java Plug-in (1.2 or higher) installed.

A total of 199 partial 16S rDNA (corresponding to E. coli
positions 54 to 510) and 84 complete ITS sequences from
mycobacterial culture isolates were newly determined, for
the purpose of building up a high-quality reference

sequence database. All validly described species and subspecies (n = 89; up to March 21, 2000) were included. In
this study a valid publication of a new name or new
nomenclature combination refers to publications appearing in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology
(IJSB) / International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM, from January 2000), either
as an original article or in the Validation Lists regularly
appearing in this journal. The Validation Lists constitute
valid publication of new names and new combinations
that meet validation criteria and which have been previously published in journals other than IJSB and IJSEM.
Names not considered validly published should no longer
be used or should be used in quotation marks (e.g.
"Mycobacterium album") to indicate that the name has
not been validly published. One hundred sixty of the 199
isolates sequenced were obtained from culture collections. The remaining 39 strains were obtained for
sequencing from private collections (Table 1, footnotes).
Additionally, fifteen 16S rDNA and 19 ITS GenBank
entries were included in the subsequent analysis (Tables
1, footnotes). The 16S rDNA from many Mycobacterium
species had been previously published. In contrast, the ITS
sequence was generated from several species for the first
time.
Differentiation of Mycobacterium species based on rRNA
operon sequencing
A 16S rDNA phylogenetic tree was created that included
one representative strain of each sequence variant. Species
having identical sequences are shown in bold (Figure 1).
According to 5'-16S rDNA sequencing, 64 different mycobacterial species (71.9%) could be identified. With the
additional input of the ITS sequence, a further 16 species
or subspecies could be resolved. The groups that shared
identical partial 16S rDNA and which could be discriminated with the aid of their ITS sequences were: (i) Mycobacterium abscessus and M. chelonae sequevar I; (ii) M.
gastri and M. kansasii sequevars I & IV; (iii) M. fortuitum 3rd
biovariant (sorbitol +, sequevar II),M. farcinogenes and M.
senegalense; (iv) M. fortuitum 3rd biovariant (sorbitol -,
sequevar III) and M. porcinum; (v) M. fortuitum subsp.
acetamidolyticum and M. fortuitum subsp. fortuitum sequevar I; (vi) M. peregrinum and M. septicum; (vii) M. murale
and M. tokaiense; and (viii) M. flavescens sequevar II and
M. novocastrense. Only the four Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex species, M. marinum / M. ulcerans (Mul A) and
the three M. avium subspecies could not be differentiated
using 5'-16S rDNA or ITS sequencing.
16S rRNA gene variability of Mycobacterium species
Intraspecies rRNA gene heterogeneity was encountered in
the case of some mycobacterial species. Sequevar (sqv.)
designations were then chosen according to the nomenclature of Frothingham and Wilson [28]. ITS variants were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/26

labelled with a species name acronym and an Arabic capital letter (e.g., Mka A for M. kansasii ITS sequevar variant
A). 16S rDNA sequevars were designated with Roman
numerals (e.g., M. chelonae sqv. I for M. chelonae 5'-16S
rDNA variant I). The 16S rDNA sequevar designations for
M. kansasii are somewhat inconsistent (i.e., M. kansasii
sqv. I and sqv. IV as well as M. kansasii sqv. III and IV-2
have identical 5'-16S rDNA sequences) because the
sequence variants were initially determined by hsp65 analysis [11,13,29]. The following 16S rDNA sequence variants were observed: (i) M. avium sqv. I-II, (ii) M. chelonae
sqv. I-II, (iii) M. flavescens sqv. I-II, (iv) M. fortuitum sqv. IV, (v) M. gordonae sqv. I-V, (vi) M. intracellulare sqv. I-V,
(vii) M. kansasii sqv. I & IV, II, III & VI-2, V, VI-1 and VI-3,
(viii) M. lentiflavum sqv. I-II, (ix) M. parafortuitum sqv. I-II,
(x) M. simiae sqv. I-II, (xi) M. terrae sqv. I-III, and (xii) M.
xenopi sqv. I-III.
ITS micro-heterogeneity of the genus Mycobacterium
A total of 84 complete ITS sequences from mycobacterial
culture isolates were newly determined. We were not able
to obtain isolates of all published ITS sequence variants.
Therefore, for some M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. kansasii
and M. simiae variants our ITS analysis relied on a few
recently submitted GenBank entries (Table 1, explanatory
footnote). Furthermore, the ITS region was not studied in
the same detail as the 5'-16S rDNA. Nevertheless several
new sequence variants were observed. The following is a
detailed listing of the results: (i) M. avium Mav A-E, (ii)M.
chelonae Mche A-C, (iii) M. flavescens Mfla A-B, (iv) M. fortuitum Mfor A-D, (v) M. gordonae Mgo A-E, (vi) M. intracellulare MAC A-F, MAC H-L and Min A-D, (vii) M. kansasii
Mka A-F, (viii)M. peregrinum Mpe A-C, (ix) M. phlei
Mphle-A-B, (x) M. scrofulaceum Mscro A-B, (xi) M. simiae
Msi A-E, (xii) M. ulcerans Mul A-B, and (xiii) M. xenopi
Mxe A-C.
Comparison of RIDOM and GenBank mycobacterial 16S
rDNA sequences
Performing a similarity search with RIDOM sequences
against GenBank, we found sequences of 77 identical culture collection strains with a minimum overlap of 80%.
Comparing these entries in detail with our sequences, we
found an average of 4.31 nucleotide differences (SD ±
0.57). Using the Spearman's rank correlation test a
significant negative correlation between the means of base
differences stratified by years, and the submission date
was also found (with rs -0.56 and p < 0.0001; Figure 2).
Furthermore, seven out of the 160 sequenced culture collection strains turned out to be "wrong" (4.4%), i.e., differed excessively from published sequence and
phenotypic data. These isolates were omitted from further
analysis (Table 1, footnotes).

rate of approximately 1% is more than can be tolerated in
medical species identification and may lead to wrong or
confusing results. On the other hand, there has been a
marked improvement in sequence quality since 1994.
This is most probably due to changes in sequencing techniques (Taq-cycle sequencing and automated sequencers).
However, more than 57% of all mycobacterial sequences
examined were deposited before this date.

Discussion
Differentiation of Mycobacterium species has traditionally
relied upon biochemical test profiles of pure cultures,
methodologies that require skilled microbiology technicians and time periods of 2 to 6 weeks before results can
be reported. For this reason alone, molecular identification of mycobacteria is likely to become the standard
employed. The rRNA gene is an attractive target for the
genotypic identification as it contains information suitable for the identification of mycobacteria at the species
level as well as for the rapid recognition of previously
undescribed species [16,30]. Commercial probe assays
targeted against the rRNA operon are already available,
but these assays only test for one or a few species at a time
[31,32]. Until now, molecular approaches, which can be
applied universally for the identification of Mycobacterium
isolates, are hampered because of the many faulty and
sometimes missing sequence entries in publicly accessible
databases. Assuming that we have produced correct
sequences – all of our tested sequences were confirmed to
be 100% similar to the independently determined
sequences of Turenne et al. [33]-, this is clearly shown by
a comparison of our newly determined sequences with
the GenBank sequence entries from identical culture collection strains previously deposited (Figure 2). An error-

Marked microheterogeneity within species, sometimes
hindering a straightforward species differentiation, was
observed during this study. Intraspecies rRNA gene variability in mycobacteria has already been independently
reported for several species; i.e., (i) M. avium-intracellulare
[11,28,34–37], (ii) M. fortuitum complex [38], (iii) M. gordonae [39], (iv) M. kansasii [29,40,41], (v) M. lentiflavum
[42], (vi) M. scrofulaceum [11], (vii) M. simiae [43], (viii)
M. terrae [44], (ix) M. ulcerans [45], and (x) M. xenopi [43].
However, the present study constitutes the most complete
analysis with respect to mycobacterial microheterogeneity. A document with the multiple alignments of the partial 16S rDNA and ITS sequevar variants has been
deposited to serve as a reference in the future (see Additional file Figure 3). Where known, the cross-references of
the 16S rDNA and ITS sequevars are also stated in the
document.
Neither 16S rDNA nor ITS sequencing could differentiate
all mycobacterial species. Of course it is possible to discriminate indistinguishable species by key-phenotypic
reactions; for example the closely related species M.
kansasii sqv. I & IV and M. gastri have an identical 5'-16S
rDNA sequence, yet the simple addition of a pigmentation criterion results in a specific test for these two taxa.
Nevertheless, we tried to incorporate other molecular targets, which have quite recently become partially available,
in a molecular and universal mycobacterial identification
scheme. This algorithm for genetic differentiation of all
mycobacteria employs insertion element and gyrB PCRs in
addition to rRNA operon sequencing. This differentiation
scheme has been also deposited (see Additional file Figure
4). This file includes primer sequences, experimentally
verified gyrB- and IS-PCR conditions as well as references
to the various methods [11,46–52]. Acid-fast bacteria are
grouped according to this algorithm by a M. tuberculosis
complex-specific gyrB PCR in either the M. tuberculosis
complex or non tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) group
[46]. All members of the M. tuberculosis complex are further characterised by specific gyrB PCRs or by restriction
analysis of the initial M. tuberculosis complex gyrB PCR
product [46,47]. With the only exception of M. tuberculosis
and M. africanum subtype II, it is thus possible to identify
all M. tuberculosis complex members from each other [47].
To differentiate these indistinguishable species, phenotypic characteristics must be still relied upon (e.g., M.

tuberculosis shows an eugonic and aerophilic growth on
Lebek medium, whereas M. africanum subtype II grows
dysgonic and microaerophilic, [53]). Furthermore, if
desired, virulent M. bovis isolates can be distinguished
from the BCG M. bovis isolates with the help of a RD1
multiplex PCR [48]. NTM isolates are 5'-16S rDNA
sequenced, which, in most cases, results in the unequivocal identification of a known or sometimes unknown
mycobacterial species. Further molecular characterisation
will be needed in only a few cases. To distinguish M. marinum from M. ulcerans, a PCR targeting the insertion element (IS) 2404 can be used [49]. Similarly, to
differentiate the M. avium subspecies from each other IS
900 and IS 902 PCRs can be employed [50,51]. However
most serovar 2 (porcine origin) and some serovar 1 and 3
M. avium subsp. avium strains isolated from animals are
"wrongly" IS 902 positive [52]. The remaining pairs of
species, including the clinically important M. chelonae sqv.
I / M. abscessus and M. gastri / M. kansasii sqv. I & IV, can
be distinguished by an ITS PCR followed by either a
sequence determination or by a restriction endonuclease
(RE) assay of the PCR product [11].
The logic incorporated in the commercially available,
MicroSeq 500 16S rDNA bacterial identification system
(Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA) is similar to that in
the RIDOM system since it uses newly-determined, nonragged 16S rDNA sequences from ATCC culture collection
isolates as a reference database. However, there are some
fundamental differences between Microseq and RIDOM.
The most notable of these is that the RIDOM system is
publicly accessible and, because of its open hypertext
structure, allows the incorporation of other useful Internet sources. Furthermore, the RIDOM approach is farreaching in that it not only tries to include sequences and
species names in its database, but also additional information related to taxonomy and disease. The MicroSeq
database has only one entry per species (i.e., in most cases
the type strain sequence) and currently contains only 63
unique sequences (software version 1.36), whereas
RIDOM (version 1.0) incorporates 123 unique, newlydetermined 5'-16S rDNA mycobacterial sequences. The
superiority of MicroSeq in comparison to approaches
based on phenotypic identification of Mycobacterium isolates has been demonstrated [6]. Because RIDOM
addresses intraspecies variation, a procedure which is
totally absent in the commercial MicroSeq database, the
performance of RIDOM in differentiating mycobacteria is
superior to that of MicroSeq. This was recently shown
[54]. Detailed descriptions of MicroSeq and RIDOM have
been published [20,21,55]. RIDOM, being one of the first
solely diagnostic-orientated genetic public databases, was
also recently included in the database issue of the Nucleic
Acids Research journal [22].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/3/26

Evaluations of the quality and accuracy of results obtained
using the two specialized databases (RIDOM version 1.0
and MicroSeq 500 v. 1.36) and the more general GenBank
and RDP-II databases have recently been published
[33,54]. Newly determined 5'-16S rDNA sequences from
ATCC Mycobacterium type strains (n = 79) and from clinical isolates (n = 94) were analyzed. All of the type strain
sequences analyzed using RIDOM were correct with 100%
similarity. MicroSeq does not include sequences of all
established species. Those for M. lentiflavum for example,
and many of the most recently described species are not
available and consequently some type strains were misidentified. In contrast, only 23% and 25% of species had a
perfect match with sequences from GenBank and RDP-II,
respectively. A high percentage, 39% and 34% of the type
strain sequences were not given top scores against GenBank and RDP-II, respectively. Therefore, these strains
would not have been identified correctly [33]. Commenting on their results, Turenne et al. state that: "The high
proportion of misleading results obtained from public
databases is not surprising, since submissions are not peer
reviewed. Similarity searches can result in the user not
obtaining a true identification of an organism, even when
the organism sequence is present in the database [33]."
On querying the different databases with the 94 clinical
isolate sequences, RIDOM gave a perfect match in 92.5%,
whereas MicroSeq yielded this result in only 69.2% of
cases. Only 4.3% of the RIDOM results had a similarity of
99% or below, which we regard as a threshold for the criteria of a "distinct species". MicroSeq failed to surpass this
threshold in 17.0% of cases [54]. Cloud et al., although
expressing concern about the costs of sequencing, argue in
their study that the sequencing technique in combination
with a high-quality database is an excellent tool for species identification of mycobacteria, which reduces turnaround time and makes repeat analysis and confirmation
of questionable results with biochemicals unnecessary
[54].
The availability of a comprehensive, high-quality
sequence database enabled us to systematically examine
named, but not authenticated, GenBank entries and
sequences from culture collection strains. Table 2 (see
Additional file Table 2) lists the similarity search best
matches for these sequences together with our conclusions regarding the justification for considering a previously non-valid named species as a new species or
whether the non-valid name refers to just a synonym. Out
of 29 analyzed entries, 9 showed a 100% similarity match
with a valid species. Therefore the names of these isolates
are most probably synonyms of already known species.
One entry, "M. album", does not appear to be a Mycobacterium at all. When the reporting criteria, established by
Patel et al. [6], were applied to the remaining entries,
seven ("M. acapulcensis", M. doricum, "M. fluoroan-

thenivorans", M. immunogenum, M. kubicae, "M. monacense", and "M. petroleophilum") showed a best match
with a validly described species below 98.2%. The chance
is therefore high that these are not just genospecies but
indeed new species. It is difficult to predict the correct status of the remaining 12 entries. However, nine of these
isolates had a best match equal or above 99.0% and are
therefore most probably not new species. It needs to be
mentioned that our evaluations are based solely upon the
percentage similarity of the partial 16S rDNA with that of
a known species. Other methods, in addition to rDNA
sequencing (e.g., DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic tests), need to be employed before confirming or
rejecting new species [56]. Therefore, while the RIDOM
database is quite complete, one should not accept it as the
sole definitive authority for establishing mycobacterial
species. The pitfalls in the 16S rDNA "similarity-only"
approach is illustrated in the case of M. elephantis (99.3%
best match with M. pulveris). This recently and validly
described species would not have been regarded as a new
species using the above stated criteria [57]. It is interesting
to note that M. elephantis was established mainly because
of its unique, nearly complete, 16S rDNA sequence. Up to
now, however, GenBank does not contain even a partial
16S rDNA sequence of M. pulveris, a species described as
early as 1983 and which is apparently most closely related
to M. elephantis.

Conclusions
The data from this analysis of all validly published mycobacterial species, in conjunction with the previously published evaluations of our database [33,54], show that it is
possible to differentiate most mycobacterial species by
sequence analysis of partial 16S rDNA. A database should
be exhaustive [58] and, should include more than just one
representative strain of each species because of the marked
intraspecies variability. A molecular diagnosis system
must involve multiple molecular targets, since not all
Mycobacterium species can be differentiated using 5'-16S
rDNA sequencing alone. The cost burden for the sequencing method is constantly dropping. Under certain conditions, it may be already less expensive than conventional
methods [59]. Therefore, the sequencing technique
should be considered for routine application, not only for
reference laboratories. For this purpose, a high-quality
database needed for such an implementation is available
under the URL http://www.ridom-rdna.de. Users can submit a sequence and conduct a similarity search for mycobacterial identification purposes against the RIDOM
reference database. Furthermore, because of the open
hypertext structure of RIDOM, many links to other World
Wide Web services are established, thereby augmenting
the information content. Links in the opposite direction
are also possible since GenBank and NCBI Taxonomy, for

example, link back to RIDOM in the frame of the NCBI
LinkOut project [60].
