Abstract
Co-conservation (phylogenetic profiles) is a well-established method for predicting functional
relationships between proteins. Several publicly available databases use this method and additional
clustering strategies to develop networks of protein interactions (cluster co-conservation (CCC)).
CCC has previously been limited to interactions within a single target species. We have extended
CCC to develop protein interaction networks based on co-conservation between protein pairs
across multiple species, cross-species cluster co-conservation.

Background

The exponential increase in sequence information has widened the gap between the number of predicted and experimentally characterized proteins. At present, about 400
microbial genomes are fully sequenced. The prediction of
protein function from sequence is a critical issue in genome
annotation efforts. Currently, the best established method for
function prediction is based on sequence similarity to proteins of known function. Unfortunately, homoogy-based prediction is of limited use due to the large number of
homologous protein families with no known function for any
member. An alternative method for predicting protein function is the phylogenetic profiles approach, also known as the
co-conservation (CC) method first introduced by Pellegrini et
al. [1]. Co-conservation predicts interactions between pairs of
proteins by determining whether both proteins are consistently present or absent across diverse genomes [2-8]. CC

methods have been shown to be more powerful than sequence
similarity alone at predicting protein function.
Even though all CC methods rely on the premise that functionally related proteins are gained or lost together over the
course of evolution, several different strategies for performing CC studies have been reported. For example, Date et al.
[7] used real BLASTP best hit E-values normalized across 11
bins instead of binary classification for conservation, while
Zheng and coworkers [9] constructed phylogenetic profiles
using presence/absence of neighboring gene pairs. Alternatively, Pagel et al. [10] constructed phylogenetic profiles
between domains, instead of genes, and then created domain
interaction maps. Barker et al. [11] applied maximum likelihood statistical modeling for predicting functional gene linkages based on phylogenetic profiling. Their method detected
independent instances of protein pair correlated gain or loss

on phylogenetic trees, reducing the high rates of false positives observed in conventional across-species methods that
do not explicitly incorporate a phylogeny [11].
Currently, several web-based databases that compile predictions of protein-protein interactions are available, for example, PLEX [7], String [8], Prolinks [6], and Predictome [5].
These databases use various methods, including CC, to organize groups of proteins within individual species into clusters
(cluster co-conservation (CCC)) that represent predicted protein interaction networks. Here, we have investigated the
degree to which these within-species clusters are conserved
across different species, using an automated method for comparing phylogenetic profiling based CCC across multiple species (CS-CCC; Figure 1). CS-CCC is essentially a meta-analysis
of CCC that automates the identification of interactions that
are uniquely present or absent across different species, which
cannot be easily accomplished using existing methods. We
have shown that this method increased groupings among proteins that function in distinct but coordinate processes and
decreased groupings among proteins with unknown functions. This suggests that CS-CCC, in comparison to CCC,
allows one to extend the network to better understand pathways involving proteins with multiple functions. Our intention for CS-CCC was that the identity of proteins present or
absent in co-conserved clusters when evaluated across multiple species would facilitate the assignment of protein function, enable the development of novel and testable biological
hypotheses, and provide experimentalists with the scientific
justification required to test these hypotheses. We show these
features through a number of different examples involving
complex biological phenomena (that is, flagellum, chemotaxis, and biofilm proteins).

Results
Cross-species clustered co-conservation
CS-CCC is based on the use of CC methods simultaneously
across several species. As such, the reliability of the CS-CCC
method is directly linked to the reliability of existing CC
methods, which has been extensively documented [2-8]. Specifically, since CC methods produce protein-protein interactions involving proteins with previously uncharacterized
functions, CC methods perform better than sequence similarity methods alone at predicting protein function. Here, we
performed the same comparison to assess the performance of

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R185

CS-CCC (up to six species) when compared to CCC alone (one
species) (Figure 2a). The reliability of predicted protein interaction pairs was evaluated by using a combination of Clusters
of Orthologous Groups (COG) functional categories, and The
Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) role categories (Additional data file 1). As the number of species included in our
CS-CCC analysis increased, the number of predicted interactions involving proteins with unclassified functions decreased
(yellow bars). Interestingly, at the lowest confidence level, the
number of predicted interactions involving proteins from different functional categories increased with the number of
included species. At the highest confidence level, grouping
between proteins from the same functional category
increased. For example, 56% of Escherichia coli K12 protein
pairs (confidence level of 0.6) consisted of proteins within the
same COG functional group, 19% of protein pairs were in different functional categories, and 25% had at least one unclassified member due to limited experimental data. As the
number of species is expanded, these percentages range from
54-62%, 30-45%, and 0-10%, respectively. At the highest confidence level (0.8), the inclusion of 6 species resulted in
almost 80% of the predicted interactions involving proteins
from the same functional category. These results suggest that
expanding the number of species included in the analysis, as
provided for by CS-CCC, not only predicts interactions that
are not predicted at different confidence levels used in CCC
analysis, but also that the nature of such predicted interactions is fundamentally different. One explanation for such
observations is that CS-CCC has improved capabilities for
extending the protein interaction network to include the various functions required in complex biological processes (that
is, regulatory relationships, nutrient transport/catabolism
links, and so on). As an example of this possibility, in the CSCCC analysis using all 6 bacterial species at confidence level
0.8 (the green bar on the far right on Figure 2a), there were 6
co-conserved protein pairs involving 9 total proteins that
were not in the same COG functional category. When the
larger network that these pairs fall into was extracted (Figure
2b), it became apparent that each of the proteins in question
function within the context of two larger, coherent networks
involving related processes. For example, rpoA and rpsD
encode proteins of differing functions, yet their interaction is
well conserved across multiple species within a 12-gene network of related functions. The remaining seven proteins of
varying functions were also well conserved across multiple
species in a larger network. These data suggest that the addi-

comparing proteins and associated links within such interaction networks to identify the combined set of network interactions as well those interactions
that are unique to individual species or common across multiple species. Clusters from three organisms are shown, but the method could examine any

tion of multiple species to the analysis adds confidence to predicted interactions among proteins from different functional
categories (that is, a meta-analysis). This point is exemplified
via the color-coded, species specific arcs in Figure 2b, where
it is clear that addition of multiple species both adds new
interactions (that is, unique sub-networks) and reinforces the
interactions predicted for comparison species.

CS-CCC identifies interactions that could not be
identified by CCC
Our analysis of CCC across six bacterial species indicated that
CS-CCC revealed unique and useful information not provided
by CCC alone. As one example, CS-CCC uniquely revealed
that amino-acid biosynthesis and flagellar networks are connected via FliY (Figure 3c), a component of the flagella motorswitch complex that is predicted to transport amino acids
[12]. Both E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ArgT networks revealed connections with the FliY protein (Figure
3a,b), but such networks did not include the extensive set of
additional flagellar protein interactions predicted in the
Bacillus subtilis network. Such information can be used to not
only develop more precise hypotheses about protein function
but also to provide the justification required to test such
hypotheses. A second example of information uniquely
revealed by CS-CCC suggests how the process of chemotaxis
has evolved across species. A CS-CCC comparison of chemotaxis in E. coli K12 and Salmonella revealed that Salmonella
lacks Tap, which transports maltose, but has Tcp, which
transports citrate. In contrast, E. coli has Tap but lacks Tcp.
CCC analysis alone does not capture this difference in chemotaxis responsiveness. As a final example, extending this CSCCC analysis of chemotaxis proteins to include P. aeruginosa
indicated new links among type IV pili and biofilm formation
proteins [13,14], suggesting that the process of chemotaxis
has evolved different functional relationships in different species. These three examples provide a simple demonstration of
the ability of CS-CCC to predict unique and biologically
informative interactions when compared to CCC alone. The
next several sections elaborate upon the specific types of
interactions that CS-CCC is uniquely suited at identifying.

CS-CCC reveals how proteins that function in distinct
but coordinated processes may have evolved
Chemotaxis
Chemotaxis proteins are co-conserved across the examined
bacteria (Figure 4). Three classes of proteins are essential for
chemotaxis: transmembrane receptors, cytoplasmic signaling
components, and enzymes for adaptive methylation. The
transmembrane receptors are two-component signal transduction complexes called methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). E. coli MCPs are Tsr, Tar, Trg, Tap, and Aer,
and each recognizes specific sugars, amino acids or dipeptides (Figure 4a,c). Even though different bacteria have different MCPs, they are highly co-conserved among Gramnegative and positive bacteria. For example, Salmonella lacks
Tap, which recognizes maltose, but has Tcp, a citrate sensor

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R185

[15], which is co-conserved with the other Salmonella MCPs
(Figure 4b,c). The cytoplasmic signaling components transmit signal between the MCP receptors and the flagellar apparatus. These proteins are CheA, CheW, CheY and CheZ, and
they are not co-conserved among the bacteria. CheZ is not coconserved because it has no homology across many bacteria
[15]. CheY is likely not co-conserved because it functions with
CheZ. CheA and CheW are sometimes co-conserved and
sometimes not, which may suggest that they function independently in different bacteria. The enzymes for adaptive
methylation, CheB and CheR, modulate signaling of the cytoplasmic proteins, and both of these proteins are highly coconserved among all six bacteria. Thus, chemotaxis analysis
illustrates two important points. First, the CS-CCC method
reveals species differences in protein interaction, including
co-conserved pairs that are unique to a given species or that
are common across select species (Figure 4c). For instance,
the sequences of CheA and CheW are conserved but the proteins are not co-conserved, suggesting that their interactions
and functions may differ among bacterial species. Second, the
CS-CCC method yields information that functional assays do
not. For instance, different MCPs recognize different ligands
and yet are co-conserved because they function in the same
pathway.

Biofilm formation
Figure 4 shows a cluster containing proteins that function in
distinct but inter-dependent processes. For instance, in P.
aerginosa, flagella, chemotaxis machinery, and type IV pili
are important for bacterial biofilm formation [13,14] and are
co-conserved. Type IV pili mediate twitching motility, which
is important for subsequent spreading of the bacteria over the
surface and the formation of microcolonies within a developing biofilm [13]. Twitching motility proteins PilJ and PilK are
co-conserved within this cluster and are highly interconnected with flagella and chemotaxis proteins. Flagellar motility appears to be required for approaching surfaces, and 17
flagellar proteins are co-conserved (Figure 4c). Chemotaxis is
required for the bacteria to swim towards nutrients associated with a surface. P. aerginosa has two chemotaxis
signaling systems, and proteins representing both are in the
biofilm cluster (CheR1, CheR2, CheA, CheW, PA0173,
PA0178; PctA, PctB, PctC). These data suggest that chemotaxis, flagella, and pili proteins may be co-conserved because
they all contribute to biofilm formation. Moreover, the inclusion of P. aerginosa in the CS-CCC analysis brought pili proteins into the biofilm cluster, suggesting that in some
bacteria, all of these processes co-evolved. Thus, CS-CCC can
identify co-conserved networks of proteins that function in
biochemically distinct pathways but that contribute to complex biological phenomenon.

which proteins are secreted [17]. S. typhimurium LT2 and E.

proteins from each are within this cluster. In E. coli K12, S.
typhimurium LT2, and B. subtilis, RpoN connects the RpoNregulated and the flagellar/T3SS clusters. This is consistent
with experimental data that flagellar genes (flhA and flhB) are
activated by RpoN [18]. Thus, RpoN likely connects two distinct clusters because it regulates proteins in both clusters.
This demonstrates that because CS-CCC examines multiple
genomes simultaneously, it has the power to show that proteins unique to particular organisms may function with proteins common to multiple organisms, enabling the placement
of unstudied proteins within a broader biological context.

CS-CCC can be used to assign function to unstudied
proteins
Genes that function in biofilm formation
Figure 5a shows two large clusters of proteins built around
YegE or YfiN in E. coli K12 and P. aeruginosa. These clusters
are co-conserved with variable numbers of proteins among all
of our Gram-negative bacteria. Even though most of these
proteins have unknown function, many have GGDEF (GlyGly-Asp-Glu-Phe) or EAL (Glu-Ala-Leu) domains, which
have been implicated in expression of biofilm phenotypes
[19]. Interestingly, each protein of known function within this

Karimpour-Fard et al.

cluster in PAO1 (WspR, MorA, and FimX) has also been
implicated in biofilm phenotypes. WspR is a response regulator that activates pili adhesion genes required for biofilm formation [20]. MorA is a membrane-localized negative
regulator of the timing of flagellar formation and plays a role
in the establishment of biofilms [21]. FimX is required for a
type of twitching motility critical to biofilm formation [22].
FimX is a signal sensing protein with phosphotransfer activity and a GGDEF domain. GGDEF encodes a dinucleotide
cyclase that generates cyclic di-GMP and is present in all proteins known to be involved in the regulation of cellulose synthesis. Cyclic di-GMP is a novel bacterial second messenger
that directs the transition from sessility to motility [19]. Cyclic
di-GMP is degraded by proteins with EAL domains, which are
cyclic dinuclotide phosphodiesterases [19]. Proteins containing the GGDEF and EAL domain can regulate biofilm
formation and/or cell aggregation by controlling the levels of
cyclic di-GMP [19]. Interestingly, most of the proteins in
these large clusters have GGDEF or EAL domains. Of the 44
known P. aeruginosa proteins with GGDEF or EAL domains
[19], 34 are in this cluster; 19 have GGDEF and 15 have EAL
domains. E. coli K12 has a similar cluster of GGDEF and EAL
domains (Figure 5a). The 25 proteins within this cluster are
highly interconnected. Of the 38 E. coli K12 known GGDEF or
EAL domain containing proteins [23], 24 are co-conserved
within this cluster. EvgS is a sensor protein for a two component regulatory system [24] that is also within this cluster.
Evgs is involved in quorum sensing and may be important in
biofilm establishment or maintenance. Over-expression of
evgS causes abnormal biofilm architecture [25] and previous
studies also noted that quorum sensing is involved in biofilm
formation [26]. Our experimental data show that four of the
GGDEF domain containing proteins in the network of Figure

5a that previously had no known function do indeed mediate
biofilm formation [27]. Similar biofilm clusters were identified by the CS-CCC method in all of the Gram-negative bacteria we examined. Thus, by clustering together unstudied
proteins, whether or not they have sequence homology, CSCCC suggests that these proteins may function in a common
phenomenon.

Small clusters can contain proteins that function in the same
processes
Examination of small protein clusters revealed that most
pairs or triplets contain proteins that function in the same
processes. To further test this observation, we experimentally
examined the triplet containing YcgB, YeaH, and YeaG, which
cluster together across different bacteria (Figure 5b). Because
independent data indicate that yeaH, but not yeaG, contributes to antimicrobial peptide resistance in S. typhimurium
[28], we determined whether strains lacking ycgB have a similar phenotype. Strains lacking ycgB were indeed sensitive to
antimicrobial peptides (unpublished data). Thus, CS-CCC
analyses revealed previously unknown protein interactions
that provided sufficient justification to test a specific biological hypothesis suggested by these interactions.

When proteins are not identified as co-conserved using
CS-CCC
In this study, we have shown that CS-CCC of proteins provides important information. Both the presence and the
absence of clustered co-conservation for any given protein are
informative. There are at least two reasons why proteins that
function together are not co-conserved in a species: first, a
protein is found only in certain organisms or a protein function is performed by different proteins in different organisms;
and second, a result is a false negative.

A protein is found only in certain organisms: T3SS effectors
Effector proteins are secreted by T3SS machinery and function to alter host cell physiology [29]. A bacterial species can
have many effectors but they generally do share apparent
sequence homology, either within or between bacteria [30].
We examined 49 known SPI2 and SPI1 effectors in S. typhimurium LT2 and 40 known effectors in P. aeruginosa and
found that none of these proteins are co-conserved. In contrast, some of the known translocon T3SS proteins, which
form the secretion apparatus, are highly co-conserved (Figure
4c). Thus, while CS-CCC offers insights into the function of
proteins that are co-conserved, our results show that some of
the non co-conserved proteins, such as effectors, are organism specific.

Our analysis of false negatives reveals that the CS-CCC
method produces some false negatives. For instance, there is
no co-conservation between RpoN and flagella in E. coli 0157,
S. flexneri and P. aeruginosa (Figure 4c). However, it has

ellar genes, such as flhA and flhB, are regulated by RpoN [18].
In addition, an RpoN consensus sequence is located in the
intergenic region between flhB and flhA [23]. These data suggest that the absence of co-clustering of RpoN with flagellar
proteins in P. aeruginosa is a false negative result. Thus,
when proteins are not co-conserved, it cannot be concluded
that they are functionally unrelated. This result further
underlines the value of developing and comparing interaction
networks from multiple genomes when attempting to infer
function.
There are also some situations in which a result is both a false
negative and the protein in question is found only in certain
organisms. The bacterial flagellum is a complex molecular

system with multiple components required for functional
motility. It extends from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior.
Not only are flagella organelles of locomotion, but they also
play important roles in attachment and biofilm formation.
There are common themes in flagellar protein control and
assembly, but there also appears to be variation among
organisms. Some of the flagellar proteins are not co-conserved in any of the bacteria of our study, such as, three ring
proteins (FlgH, FlgI, and FliF), and some of the axle-like proteins FliE, FlgB, FlgF, FlgL, and FliD. FliE has been shown to
physically interact with FlgB [31]. The stator motor proteins
MotA and MotB are also not co-conserved. Thus, CS-CCC
analysis of the flagellar cluster yields both false negative
results and is also a consequence of species-specific proteins.

This also illustrates that determining why proteins are not coconserved can be difficult, without additional information.

Discussion

Large volumes of data make computational methods feasible,
exciting, and preferable to gene-by-gene homology searches.
We have shown that use of CS-CCC expands protein interaction networks to include proteins with distinct functions that
are involved in coherent biological processes, offers insight
into the function of uncharacterized proteins, reveals unique
information about each genome examined, and gives insight
into the process of evolution.
Protein co-conservation can be a result of many factors,
including vertical inheritance or functional selection. Thus,
we have examined patterns of CCC within and across several
bacteria using CS-CCC. Our analysis showed that this
computational approach provides us with more information
than the traditional homology approaches or CCC. Homology
approaches to protein function are based on similarity to
other proteins with known functions and are limited by the
fact that many proteins have unknown functions. While
homology-based methods can be effective for predicting the
functions of remote homologs, these methods perform poorly
as the evolutionary distance between homologous proteins
increases. Even a sophisticated homology-based method fails
to successfully assign functions to most of the proteins for a
particular organism. CCC, on the other hand, is not strictly
based on homology but is limited by its ability to analyze only
a single species at a time. In contrast, CS-CCC examines each
cluster across multiple species and reveals interactions that
both homology-based methods and CCC fail to identify. Use
of CS-CCC allows researchers to extend the protein
interaction network to better understand pathways involving
multiple proteins with multiple functions. Therefore, the CSCCC method is a significant advance and will be useful for
researches in many different fields of biology.

tions of the biological roles that proteins with previously
unstudied functions may play. For instance, proteins that
function in distinct but coordinated processes can be co-conserved across species even though not all processes occur in
all bacteria (Figure 4c). In addition, in large, highly interconnected clusters in which most of the proteins have unknown
functions, it is likely that they all function together in a common phenomenon. The GGDEF/EAL cluster is an example of
this, as many of the previously unknown proteins in this cluster play roles in biofilm formation (Figure 5a). Even small
protein clusters identified by CS-CCC are likely to consist of
proteins that function in the same process, as shown by COG/
TIGR analysis and experimentally (Figure 5b). These analyses provide evidence that the CS-CCC method is a reliable
predictor of functional relationships.
For any given method, there are advantages and disadvantages. The number of false positives and false negatives is a
key measurement of accuracy. In our case, the number of
false negatives is not possible to estimate without performing
many additional laboratory experiments. However, our evaluation of CS-CCC showed that the number of false positives
was low. Since this method was evaluated based on our
selected bacteria, there may be some bias toward overestimation of accuracy when applied to other organisms, and this
remains to be tested. In addition, we have shown that our
results can be sensitive to the number of bacteria included in
our analysis. Finally, there may be some aspects of the bacteria we chose that are not representative of other bacteria, further reducing the generality of these results. Thus, while the
report here represents a compelling demonstration of the
value of performing CCC across multiple species, future
efforts should be focused on developing better understanding
of which and how many organisms to include in CS-CCC
studies.

datasets of protein functions and interactions. The genomes
of five closely related Gamma Gram-negative and one low
G+C bacteria (B. subtilis) were used to evaluate the CCC
method. Substantial experimental data exist for all six bacteria. The gammaproteobacteria included E. coli (K12 and
O157-O157:H7 EDL933), S. flexneri (2a str. 2457T), S. typhimurium (LT2), and P. aeruginosa (PAO1). E. coli (K12) is the
most intensively studied Gram-negative bacteria and is the
closest studied relative of P. aeruginosa, and S. typhimurimum LT2. E. coli (O157-O157:H7 EDL933) is a clinical isolate
from raw hamburger meat implicated in hemorrhagic colitis
outbreak, and S. typhimurium LT2 causes enteritis in
humans. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and is
the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with

cystic fibrosis; P. aeruginosa PAO1 was isolated from a
wound [32]. P. aeruginosa is a versatile Gram-negative bacterium that also thrives in soil, marshes and coastal marine
habitats, and on plant tissues [32]. E. coli K12 diverged 4.5
million years ago (MYA) from O157, an estimated 100 MYA
from Salmonella, 200 MYA from Pseudomonas, and 1,200
MYA from Bacillus. Thus, we examined a combination of
pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms that range from
closely to distantly related.

Construction of CS-CCC graphs
We began construction of CS-CCC graphs (Figure 1) using
predictions of pairwise protein-protein interactions based on
phylogenetic profiles (CC methods; Figure 1a). Currently, sev-

eral databases that compile predictions are available, including Prolinks [6], String [8], and Predictome [5]. We used the
Prolinks Database 2.0, which contains a total of 168 microbial
genomes, including 10 eukaryotes, 16 Archaea, and 142
Bacteria [6]. Even though ProLinks provides predicted interactions based on a number of different methods (that is,
Rosetta stone, gene neighbors, and so on), we have used only
interactions prediction by the phylogenetic profiling method
in this study. We chose not to use the STRING database as a
source of predictions because it conflates co-conservation
with orthology information from the COG database [8]; we
used COG functional category and TIGR functional role category data to evaluate purely co-conservation inferences. Predictome [5] was not used because it does not provide
statistical measures to evaluate the accuracy of each prediction. For each pair assignment (CC), we required a confidence
scheme using phylogenetic profiling of at least 60% according
to the Prolinks scoring scheme [6]. An E-value of less than 1010 was used as the threshold for BLASTP in Prolinks to define
a homolog of a query protein to be present in a secondary
genome. For each bacterial genome analyzed, the number of
assigned pairs is shown in Table 2. For each bacterial species,
we mapped accession IDs from Prolinks predicted protein
pairs to NCBI [33] and then to EcoCyc [23] for E. coli K12, P.
aeruginosa [34] for P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis [35] for B.
subtilis. We matched corresponding proteins between species
by protein name or synonym. We then constructed CCC
graphs using the pairwise links for each species (Figures 1b
and 6) using a binary adjacency matrix where 1 indicates the
corresponding pair was co-conserved, and 0 otherwise. Networks were represented by graphs in which each node represents a protein and each edge represents an interaction that
links two proteins. Network graphs were visualized using
Cytoscape [36], an open-source, platform-independent environment software. The lengths of the lines connecting proteins hold no meaning and vary to facilitate viewing of the
network. Each network is color-coded based on protein function categories, as described in the corresponding figure legends. The assignment of putative functions was based on
EcoCyc, Pseudomonas.com, NCBI and SubtiList, as given in
the links above. For separation of connected components of
the network and building clusters of proteins, we used
breadth-first search (BFS) graph algorithms.
Finally, for comparison of each cluster across different species (CS-CCC), we used BFS to build a network (source
network) for a set of target proteins from the source genome.
We then built networks for each additional organism that
contained proteins with the same name as at least one of the
proteins from the source networks. This process identifies
proteins and protein interactions that are consistently identified across multiple species (colored gray in Figure 1c) or that
are unique to individual species (colored red in Figure 1c).
This same method can be used to further parse such networks
to identify combined, common and unique networks present
for specific proteins across a collection of organisms (Figure

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/9/R185

1c). In this way, CS-CCC builds on information generated by
CCC (Figure 1b) to provide more accurate and genome-specific protein function assignment. We used protein name to
map links across conserved species (thus, links are not explicitly based on orthology) [37-39]. Like all methods, the use of
protein names has both advantages and disadvantages. Here,
protein name was chosen in order to validate that CS-CCC
provides new and biologically informative data not accessible
by CCC alone. For this purpose, we chose to validate this
method using named proteins where functional information
was available. While this is appropriate for method validation, the disadvantage is that there are problems with
annotation due in part to a lack of standardization, which
would limit the number of proteins for which this analysis can
be reliably performed. In light of this limitation, we considered using reciprocal homology as an alternative to protein
name. We found that this introduces unacceptable levels of
cross-talk, much of which is likely noise. Addressing this limitation is an important area for continued effort.
