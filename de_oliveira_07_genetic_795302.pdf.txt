Abstract
Background: Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis infection in man results in a clinical spectrum of
disease manifestations ranging from cutaneous to mucosal or visceral involvement. In the present
study, we have investigated the genetic variability of 18 L. amazonensis strains isolated in
northeastern Brazil from patients with different clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis. Parasite
DNA was analyzed by sequencing of the ITS flanking the 5.8 S subunit of the ribosomal RNA genes,
by RAPD and SSR-PCR and by PFGE followed by hybridization with gene-specific probes.
Results: ITS sequencing and PCR-based methods revealed genetic heterogeneity among the L.
amazonensis isolates examined and molecular karyotyping also showed variation in the
chromosome size of different isolates. Unrooted genetic trees separated strains into different
groups.
Conclusion: These results indicate that L. amazonensis strains isolated from leishmaniasis patients
from northeastern Brazil are genetically diverse, however, no correlation between genetic
polymorphism and phenotype were found.

Background
Leishmania is an intracellular protozoan parasite that
infects humans and causes a wide spectrum of diseases
known as leishmaniases. Leishmaniases are endemic in
88 countries, where 350 million people live the risk of
infection. In the American continent, leishmaniasis is

caused by a different number of species and infection with
L. amazonensis, in particular, produces a wide spectrum of
clinical diseases [1]. Severity varies from localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL), the most common clinical manifestation, to diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). LCL,
in Brazil, is associated with species belonging to both

Viannia and Leishmania sub-genus whereas DCL is a rare
manifestation of leishmaniasis characterized by the presence of nodular, non-ulcerated lesions with abundant
parasitized macrophages and the absence of an anti-Leishmania cell mediated immune response [2]. In Brazil, DCL
is concentrated in the north and northeastern regions,
with the highest number of cases being reported in the
State of Maranhão [3]. L. amazonensis has also been isolated from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and
from patients with muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis (ML),
although, in Brazil, these two clinical manifestation are
most generally associated with infection by L. chagasi and
L. braziliensis [4], respectively.
A number of methods have been applied to or developed
in order to study genetic diversity and relationships
within Leishmania [5-8]. Among these, we can highlight
PCR-based methods such as Random Amplification of
Polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR) [9] and Simple Sequence
Repeat (SSR-PCR) [10]. RAPD-PCR allows the detection
of DNA polymorphisms without the need of pre-determined genetic data since it is based on the amplification
of genomic DNA under low stringency conditions
whereas SSR-PCR is based on amplification of inter-repeat
segments using anchored oligonucleotides complementary to the microsatellite repeats. Microsatellites or simple
sequence repeats are present in most eukaryotic genomes
and consist of tandem repeats of a simple motif of a few
nucleotides (< 6) [11]. Both RAPD and SSR-PCR have
been used in the study of genetic diversity of Leishmania
[12-14]. Another PCR-based method to analyze genetic
diversity is based on the amplification of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS), located within the rRNA gene array,
followed by digestion with restriction enzymes, a method
termed "Intergenic Region Typing" [15]. Moreover, the
ITS sequences can also be used to generate information
useful for phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular evolution studies [16].
Diversity within Leishmania has also been investigated at
the chromosome level as seen by chromosome size polymorphism [17]. Large-scale chromosomal rearrangements have occurred between Old World and New World
species [18] and the chromosome-size polymorphisms
are frequently associated with repeated elements present
at the telomeres or to the amplification/deletion process
of tandemly repeated genes, as in the L. major miniexon
gene locus, in chromosome 2 [19].
In the present study, we have examined the genetic variability of L. amazonensis strains obtained in northeastern
Brazil, from patients with different clinical manifestations
of the disease, ranging from typical LCL to the rare DCL.
In order to do so, different molecular tools such as ITS
sequencing, RAPD and SSR-PCR and hybridization of

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/6/1/5

PFGE-resolved chromosomes with gene-specific markers
were employed.

Results
rRNA sequencing and analysis
To begin examining diversity at the interspecific level, the
DNA segment containing ITS 1 and 2, as well as the 5.8 S
RNA gene, was amplified by PCR using as template DNA
from 17 L. amazonensis strains isolated from patients with
different clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis, DNA
from a reference L. amazonensis strain (M2269) and DNA
from a L. major strain (MHOM/81/IL/Friedlin), which was
used as an out-group (Table 1). Except for strain BA115
which was, therefore, omitted from subsequent analyses,
PCR amplification yielded a product of ~ 1.2 kb for all
strains studied (data not shown). Sequencing of the
amplification product revealed 1131 bp orthologous sites
and saturation analyses showed no severe saturation, all
positions were informative (data not shown). The data set
was then subjected to the probability ratio test (LRT)
approach. The model that best fit the pattern of nucleotide
substitution for our dataset was the HKY85 model [20]
plus gamma distribution of α = 0.3641 (indicating heterogeneity of the sites' substitution rates over time). Considering these findings, we performed a phylogenetic signal
analysis and found 25.6% of unresolved trees in the likelihood mapping method. As seen in Fig. 1, the tree topology obtained using the HKY model plus gamma
distribution revealed two internal nodes, with 100%
bootstrap support, in which strains BA32, BA112 and
BA75 are clustered. We can only speculate that the clade
containing BA32, BA112 and BA75 could be a sister group
of the clade containing the BA69, BA73, BA88, and BA137
strains since the boostrap value (58%) was not meaningful.

All VL isolates (BA137, BA32 and BA112) were clustered
in these two clades, with the exception of BA109. The
remaining tree branches, however, were found to be unresolved and some strains, such as BA109, BA125 and
BA276, were even found to be identical at this locus such.
Interestingly, BA106, a DCL case documented outside
Maranhão State, where this disease is endemic, remained
in a separate node with bootstrap support of 72%. This
strain was isolated in Bahia State, in 1986, whereas the
other two DCL strains studied (BA199 and BA276) were
isolated from patients from Maranhão state, in 1989.
Genetic polymorphism within L. amazonensis strains by
RAPD and SSR-PCR
We then compared the topology of phylogenetic tree
obtained by ITS sequencing with the dendrograms generated by RAPD and SSR-PCR. Branches observed in the
resulting RAPD or SSR-PCR dendrograms were not
strongly supported by bootstrap analysis (data not

shown). A combined analysis of RAPD and SSR-PCR
results is shown in Fig. 2. The grouping of BA109 and
BA112 (both obtained from VL patients) as well as the
grouping of strains BA113 and BA114 (both from ML
patients) were supported by significant bootstrap values
(91 and 98%, respectively). In this combined analysis,
BA106 (obtained from a DCL strain) also remained in a
separate branch, as observed in the individuals RAPD and
SSR-PCR dendrograms (data not shown). Overall, either
by ITS, RAPD or SSR-PCR, we did not detect any association between genetic polymorphism and geographic origin.
Chromosome size variations
In order to investigate the degree of chromosome size polymorphism, chrosomomes from L. amazonensis BA106,
BA109, BA113, BA125, BA276 which are representative of
the leishmaniasis clinical manifestation spectrum, L. amazonensis M2269, L. braziliensis strain (MHOM/BR/94/
H3227) and L. major Friedlin were separated by PFGE and
hybridized to specific chromosome markers. Fig. 3 shows
the hybridization patterns observed for each marker used.
The hybridization pattern indicates a wide variation in
terms of chromosome size for the L. amazonensis strains
studied. Hybridization with a gene present in both chromosomes 1 and 2 (Fig. 3A) shows variation in terms of
chromosome size for the strains tested and, importantly,
we observed size polymorphisms between chromosome
homologues. A similar result was observed by hybridiza-

tion with the spliced leader RNA gene present in chromosome 2 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, size polymorphism of
chromosome 6, identified by hybridization with the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidulate-synthase (DHFR-TS)
gene (Fig. 3C) was less evident among the strains tested.
The genomic clone used to identify chromosome 14 (Fig.
3D) has reiterated elements, which are present in other
three larger chromosomes of L. major, therefore, it allowed
the comparison of 4 chromosomes at a time. The results
indicate a narrow size variation of these chromosomes
within the L. amazonensis strains tested.

Discussion
Leishmania infection is characterized by a spectrum of disease manifestations ranging from a relatively benign LCL
to the disfiguring ML or the potentially fatal VL and infection with L. amazonensis has been associated with these
diverse clinical manifestations [1], including DCL. DCL is

a rare disease, endemic to Maranhão State, solely associated with L. amazonensis infection [21]. In the present
work, we examined, for the first time, the genetic diversity
of L. amazonensis strains from northeastern Brazil,
obtained from patients with distinct clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis employing different molecular
techniques.
Phylogenetic relationship among strains was inferred
based on the sequence comparison of a segment of the
rRNA gene locus. The ITS are less conserved between species than rRNA genes and are therefore suitable for the
phylogenetic characterization of closely related organisms
[22]. The phylogenetic signal analysis showed a number
of unresolved trees below 30%, indicating that the data
are reliable for phylogenetic inference [23]. Genetic polymorphism within this relatively conserved region has
been shown for L. braziliensis and L. naiffi [15], L. donovani
[24], L. aethiopica [25]. In the present study, ITS sequencing was able to discriminate a subset of the strains; particularly VL strains, although this particular VL clustering

was not supported by bootstrap analysis. A conspicuous
politomy was observed with the other strains studied,
except for strain BA106, indicating a high similarity
among the DNA sequences. Similarly, it has been shown
that restriction fragment analysis of the ITS region did not
reveal differences among L. mexicana strains [26].
We then examined the genetic diversity of L. amazonensis
strains by RAPD and SSR-PCR since both techniques have
been used to study genetic polymorphism among Leishmania strains [12-14]. In previous reports, genetic polymorphism could be correlated with the geographical
origin of parasite strains [12,27-29]or clinical phenotype
[30-32]. Recently, we have demonstrated that L. braziliensis isolates differing at the genome level also show distinctive infection patterns in BALB/c mice [33]. Herein, no
association was found between genetic polymorphism
and clinical manifestation of disease or geographical origin of isolate although such the search for these types of
correlation was beyond the scope of the present work. On
the other hand, we did observe a degree of genetic variability among the L. amazonensis strains employed here,
particularly BA109, BA112 and BA106. The latter, isolated
from a patient with DCL, was consistently grouped sepa-

rately from all the other strains studied. This was first
noted using ITS sequencing and was later confirmed by
both RAPD and SSR-PCR. In the phylogenetic and RAPD
analysis, BA106 presented the most basal divergence,
sharing this position with the L. major strain. The occurrence of Leishmania stocks phenotipically similar to L.
major, as assayed by enzyme electrophoresis and monoclonal antibodies, has been documented elsewhere [34].
We could speculate that BA106 is one of these strains,
however, in another study, it was typed as L. amazonensis
by enzyme electrophoresis and monoclonal antibodies[1]. Therefore, further characterization of this strain is
needed in order to confirm the identity of BA106.
We also investigated the existence of size polymorphisms
in terms of chromosome size since this is widespread phenomenon in trypanosomatids [35]. DNA from L. amazonensis strains was separated by PFGE and hybridized with
chromosome specific markers, previously anchored to the
chromosomes of L. major and other Old World species (P.
Bastien, A. Cruz et al., unpublished data). We observed
size variation of homologous chromosomes of L. amazonensis, when compared to L. major, as seen with chromosome 2, for example, indicating a possible amplification/
deletion of the miniexon array. Biological relevance for
the intra-chromosome size variation of the miniexon
array has never been reported, although previously
observed [19,36,37]. More importantly, chromosome
hybridization results for strain BA109 showed a size polymorphism pattern differing from all other strains analyzed, reinforcing the importance of studying the genome
plasticity characteristic of Leishmania, particularly
observed within neotropical strains [38,39]

Conclusion
In the present work, we have studied the genetic diversity
within L. amazonensis strains from northeastern Brazil. We
show that L. amazonensis strains isolated from patients
with different clinical manifestations of the disease are
genetically diverse and show that this divergence extends
to variations in terms of chromosome size. Since L. amazonensis is associated with rare or unusual disease presentations such as DCL or VL, respectively, it remains of
interest to search for genetic markers that can be associated with these clinical manifestations.

Methods
Parasites isolates and genomic DNA preparation
A total of 18 L. amazonensis strains were used in this study
(Table 1). Strains were obtained between 1985 and 1990
by aspiration of lesions from cutaneous, mucosal, diffuse
and post-Kalazar dermal leishmaniasis or by bone marrow aspiration of visceral leishmaniasis patients, each isolate originated from a different human subject [1]. Strains
have been maintained in cryopreservation tanks since the

http://www.kinetoplastids.com/content/6/1/5

time of isolation in culture. For the purpose of this study,
isolates were defrosted and cultured until a parasite density of 107/ml was obtained. Species identification was
performed by PCR [40] and by ELISA using monoclonal
antibodies [41]. For genomic DNA extraction, stocks were
grown in 199 medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen), at
26°C. Parasites (107/ml) were harvested by centrifugation
and genomic DNA was purified using Wizard® Genomic
DNA Purification Kit (Promega). DNA was ressuspedend
in 50 µl TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and
stored at -20°C until used. DNA concentration was estimated by spectrophometry by reading the absorbance at
260 nm. Sample purity was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.
ITS Sequencing and Analysis
The segment containing the ITS 1, 2 and the 5.8 S region,
within the rRNA gene locus, were amplified by PCR using
primers IR1 (5'-GCTGTAGGTGAACCTGCAGCAGCTGGATCATT-3'),
IR2
(5'-GCGGGTAGTCCTGCCAAACACTCAGGTCTG-3') [15] and an internal
primer (5'-CGGCGCATGGGAGAAGCT3-3'). PCR products were purified with the CONCERT rapid PCR purification system (Gibco BRL), following the manufacturer's
instructions. Amplified PCR products were sequenced in
both strands in an ABI377® system using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit® (Applied Biosystems).
Quality analysis and assembling of the sequences were
performed using Phred/Phrap/Consed® package [42].
Consensus sequences with Phred quality > 15 were locally
aligned with sequences submitted to GenBank using
BlastN program [43]. Consensus sequences were submitted to GenBank and are available under the accession
numbers DQ300179–DQ300195. Sequence alignment
was performed manually using the BIOEDIT software
(v5.0.9) [44] and for all sequences, alignment was unambiguous. The mutational saturation was examined using
PAUP* (v4.0b10) [45]. The nucleotide substitution
model and the gamma distribution were obtained by the
likelihood ratio test (LRT) [46], employing the MODELTEST software (v3.0b6) [47]. The phylogenetic signal was
tested employing the TREE-PUZZLE (v 5.3) software [48],
using the likelihood mapping method [49]. Maximum
likelihood (ML) method was then performed in PAUP*
(v4.0b10), with a starting tree obtained via NeighborJoining algorithm. The reliability of internal branches was
assessed using the bootstrap method with 1000 pseudoreplicates. Tree topology was visualized using the
TREEVIEW program (v 1.6.2) [50]. The homologous
sequence of L. major Friedlin strain (MHOM/IL/81/
FRIEDLIN) was adopted as the outgroup.

RAPD and SSR-PCR
RAPD amplification was done as previously described
[13], employing one the following primers: 3302 (5'CTGATGCTAC-3'); 3303 (5'-TCACGATGCA-3') and 3304
(5'-GCACTGTCA-3') (all from Invitrogen). Amplification
was performed under the following conditions: an initial
denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, two cycles with
annealing at 30°C for 2 min, extension at 72°C for 1 min
and denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 33 cycles
in which the annealing temperature was increased to
40°C. The final extension was carried for 5 min at 72°C.
SSR-PCR amplification was performed using two primers:
[5'-(CA)8RY-3'], which amplifies inter-repeat segments
[10] and [5'-CAA(CT)6 -3'], which amplifies inter-repeat
segments as well as the repeat segment [51]. Amplification
reactions were performed under the following conditions:
26 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at
50°C for 45 s for the [5'-CAA(CT)6-3'] primer or at 57°C
for 45 s for the [5'-(CA)8RY-3'] primer and extension at
72°C for 7 min. All reactions were performed in triplicate.
The amplification patterns were visualized after electrophoresis in a 1.5% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel.
Genetic polymorphism analysis
Amplicons were scored by eye and well-defined, reproducible bands (generated in at least three amplification
reactions) were used to construct a binary table. Each
amplification band was numbered and scored as present
(1) or absent (0) and genetic similarity among strains was
calculated using Jaccard's similarity coefficient. The relationships between strains were estimated through dendrograms representing RAPD and SSR-PCR data.
Dendrograms were constructed based on a matrix of
genetic distance through UPGMA [52] using FreeTree (v.
0.9.1.50) [53] and the bootstrap option was used to run
1000 replicates to obtain confidence estimates for the
groupings.
