Infectious clones of Tomato leaf curl Palampur virus
with a defective DNA B and their pseudorecombination with Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus
Aamir Humayun Malik, Rob W Briddon and Shahid Mansoor*

Abstract
Background: Tomato leaf curl Palampur virus (ToLCPMV) is a bipartite begomovirus which has been reported from
India and Iran but infectious clones have not been obtained. We have previously shown the association of Zucchini
yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), a potyvirus, with severe leaf curl disease of muskmelon in Pakistan. However, the
severity of symptoms in the field and yield losses led us to believe that some other agent, such as a begomovirus,
could be associated with the disease.
Results: A bipartite begomovirus associated with a severe yellow leaf curl disease on muskmelon in Pakistan has
been characterized. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence of the DNA A and DNA B components of the
begomovirus showed that it has the highest DNA sequence identity with ToLCPMV. However, the gene encoding
the nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) was truncated in comparison to previously characterised isolates. Agrobacteriummediated inoculation of Nicotiana benthamiana with the ToLCPMV clones obtained here did not result in
symptoms. However, inoculation of plants with the DNA A component of ToLCPMV and the DNA B component of
Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) lead to systemic infection with leaf curl symptoms. This suggested that
the lack of infectivity of the ToLCPMV clones was due to the defect in DNA B. The DNA B of ToLCPMV was able to
move systemically when inoculated with DNA A of the either virus. Agro-infiltration of muskmelon with the DNA A
and DNA B components of ToLCPMV did not lead to symptomatic infection whereas inoculation with the DNA A
with the DNA B of ToLCNDV resulted in a hypersensitive response (HR) along the veins. Additionally, agroinfiltration of muskmelon with a construct for the expression of the NSP gene of ToLCNDV under the control of
the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter induced a HR, suggesting that this is the gene causing the HR.
Conclusions: Both ToLCPMV and ZYMV are associated with muskmelon leaf curl disease in Pakistan. However, the
ToLCPMV variant identified in association with ZYMV has a defective NSP. The results suggest that a variant with a
defective NSP may have been selected for in muskmelon, as this protein is an avirulence determinant in this
species, and possibly that infection requires the synergistic interaction with ZYMV.

Background
Whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses have emerged as
major pathogens of food and fiber crops throughout the
world, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions [1].
Viruses of the family Geminiviridae have circular singlestranded (ss) DNA genomes, encapsidated in characteristic
twinned isometric particles. These viruses are classified
into four genera, Mastrevirus, Curtovirus, Topocuvirus and
Begomovirus [2] depending upon their insect vector, host

range and genome organization. Begomoviruses are exclusively transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci and
infect only dicotyledonous plants. They may be monopartite or bipartite (having genomes consisting of one or two
circular single-stranded DNA molecules) [3]. Since the
identification of the betasatellites [4], it has become apparent that the majority of begomoviruses in the Old World
are monopartite and associate with betasatellites, asymptom modulating ssDNA satellite [5-7].
Several factors, including multiple infections, recombination and interspecific synergism, appear to be the major
cause of the increased importance of begomoviruses to

agriculture in recent years. Intriguingly, begomovirusbetasatellite complexes do not appear to be a problem in
cucurbits; only a single defective betasatellite isolated from
a cucurbit has been reported so far [8]. The DNA A and
DNA B components of begomoviruses encode genes both
in the virion and complementary-sense orientations. Old
World begomoviruses encode four open reading frames
(ORFs) in the complementary-sense that are involved in
viral DNA replication and control of gene expression,
while two ORFs in the virion-sense are involved in virus
encapsidation and movement. The two proteins encoded
by the DNA B component are the nuclear shuttle protein
(NSP) and the movement protein (MP) that are involved
in nuclear transport and cell-to-cell movement of viral
DNA, respectively [9].
Both watermelon and muskmelon form an important
part of diet in Pakistan, particularly in early summer.
These crops fit nicely in the cropping pattern where vegetables are grown in the winter months when land is available before the start of cotton growing season. However,
the traditional muskmelon-growing areas have recently
been hit by a severe viral disease. We have previously
shown that a potyvirus, Zucchini yellow mosaic virus
(ZYMV), is associated with the disease of muskmelon [10].
Here, we have characterized a bipartite begomovirus associated with severe leaf curl disease on muskmelon in
Pakistan.

Methods
Collection of samples and DNA extraction

Samples were collected as described earlier [10]. Total
DNA was isolated from leaf samples using CTAB method
[11].
Detection and cloning of virus components

PCR-mediated detection of begomoviruses in DNA samples extracted from symptomatic leaves was done by using
two sets of universal primer pairs (Begomo1/Begomo2 and
Begomo3/Begomo4; Table 1) designed for amplification of
different length fragments [12]. Full-length length PCR
product of DNA A was amplified by using primers Melonfor and Melonrev (Table: 1). Oligonucleotide primers used
for amplification of complete DNA B were TLCVB F and
TLCVB R (Table: 1). PCR was performed under standard
conditions as described previously [13]. Primer pairs used
for amplification of MP, NSP and full-length DNA B are
also shown in Table 1. Samples were also tested for the
presence of DNA B of begomoviruses using a PCR product
(produced using primer pair MPF/MPR; Table 1), encompassing the MP gene of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus
(ToLCNDV-IN[IN:ND:Svr:92])(acc. no U15017), as a
probe for ToLCNDV DNA B [14]. The probe was prepared
using a Hexalabeling DNA labeling kit (Fermentas) and [a32
P]dCTP (Amersham, UK). Hybridization was carried out

overnight at 65°C in a hybridization oven. Post-hybridization washes were conducted at medium-stringency.
Sequencing and sequence analysis

The complete nucleotide sequences of clones were determined by dideoxynucleotide chain-termination sequencing using the PCR-based BIG DYE kit (Perkin-Elmer
Cetus) and specific internal primers. Sequencing products were resolved commercially (Macrogen, Korea).
Sequence information was stored, assembled and analysed using the Lasergene sequence analysis package
(DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI, USA) running on an IBMcompatible PC. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on
matrices of aligned sequences using the neighbour-joining and bootstrap options of Phylip (ver. 3.5c) running
on an IBM-compatible personal computer. Sequence
alignments were produced using CLUSTAL X [15]. Phylogenetic dendrograms were viewed, manipulated and
printed using Treeview [16].
Agroinoculation of cloned DNA

Partial direct repeat constructs for the Agrobacteriummediated inoculation of the full-length DNA A and DNA
B clones were produced in the binary vector pGreen0029
[17]. An approximately 1680 bp fragment of the DNA A
and an approximately 823 bp fragment of the DNA B
clones were released from the full-length pTZ57/RT
clones by digestion with KpnI and BamHI or HindIII and
MluI, respectively, and ligated into suitably digested
pGreen0029 vector. The resulting pGreen0029 constructs
were then linearised using KpnI and HindIII, respectively,
and the full-length fragments (release from the pTZ57/
RT clones by digestion with KpnI and HindIII, respectively) ligated into these to yield the partial, direct repeat
constructs. The production of constructs in the binary
vector pBin19 for inoculation of ToLCNDV has been
described previously [18]. These binary vector constructs
were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens
GV1301 and inoculated to plants by infiltration as
described previously [18].

Results
A bipartite begomovirus is associated with severe disease
on melon

As described earlier, a very severe yellow leaf curl disease
was observed in several districts of central and southern
Punjab, including Vehari, Sahiwal and Khanewal, and
was shown to be associated with Zucchini yellow mosaic
virus (ZYMV) [10]. Total DNA isolated from symptomatic plants was used as template in PCR with universal
primers designed for the amplification of the partial
sequences of begomovirus DNA A. The amplified product was cloned and sequenced and it showed the highest levels of nucleotide sequence identity to isolates of

Tomato leaf curl Palampur virus (ToLCPMV), a bipartite
begomovirus. To confirm the bipartite nature of virus
from muskmelon, a PCR product encompassing the
movement protein (MP) gene of ToLCNDV was used as
a specific probe for Southern hybridisation. All the muskmelon samples found positive for DNA A were also
found positive for DNA B (results not shown). Samples
were similarly examined for the presence of begomoviruses by Southern blot hybridization using the DNA A
of ToLCNDV as a general probe for begomoviruses. The
probe hybridized with all sixty samples collected from
symptomatic plants that were found positive by PCR.
Cloning and complete nucleotide sequence of DNA A

Based upon the partial sequences obtained, back-to-back
primers for amplification of full-length DNA A (MelF
and MelR; Table: 1) were designed to the coat protein
region on a naturally present, unique KpnI restriction
site. A full-length product (approximately 2.7 kb) was
obtained and cloned in pTZ57RT. Restriction of the
clone with KpnI resulted in a single band on the gel
whereas restriction of clone with SmaI linearized the
clone and a 5.6 kb band appeared on the gel. The potentially full-length clone was sequenced in both orientations. A sequence similarity search (Blast) was performed
by comparing the sequence to other begomovirus
sequences in the database. The results showed that the
sequence has a high level of identity to begomoviruses
from Asia. The DNA A comprised of 2756 bp and
showed the highest levels of nucleotide sequence identity
(97%) to a ToLCPMV isolate from India (accession no.
AM884015) and 96% identity to an isolate from Iran
(accession no. FJ660444). The sequence identity with

ToLCPMV isolates ranged from 96-97% whereas to isolates of ToLCNDV the highest sequence identity (86.7%)
was with an isolate from Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan
(accession no. DQ116885). On the basis of DNA A
sequence identity, it is clear that the muskmelon infecting begomovirus in Pakistan is an isolate of ToLCPMV, a
begomovirus species previously reported infecting
tomato in India and Iran [19,20]. Sequence analysis
showed that it is a typical Old World begomovirus and
encodes four open reading frames (Rep, REn, TrAP and
AC4) in the complementary-sense and two (V2 and coat
protein) in the virion-sense (Table 2), separated by an
intergenic region (IR) (Figure 1A). The IR contains the
conserved nonanucleotide motif (TAATATTAC), forming part of the loop of a predicted stem-loop structure
found in all geminiviruses, a TATA motif (a sequence
found in the promoter region and binding site for transcription factors) [21] (2664-2667 nt) and iteron
sequences (GGTGTC) 5’ of the TATA motif (Figure 2)
[21,22]. The proteins predicted to be encoded by the
DNA A component were of the sizes expected for begomovirus DNA A encoded proteins (Table: 2) [14].
Cloning and sequence analysis of DNA B

The partial sequences of DNA B obtained were used to
design back-to-back primers (TLCVBF and TLCVBR;
Table: 1) for the amplification of the full-length DNA B
within the sequence of the movement protein (MP) gene.
The desired sized fragment (2.7 kb) of DNA B was cloned
in pTZ57RT. The clone was fully sequenced and shown to
consist of 2724 bp. The DNA B showed 98% nucleotide
sequence identity to an isolate of ToLCPMV recorded
from India (accession no. AM992534) whereas the identity

to the ToLCPMV isolate from Iran was 90% (accession no.
FJ660442). Among the DNA B components of ToLCNDV
available in the databases the highest levels of identity
(82%) were to an isolate from India obtained from pumpkin (accession no. AM286435). In ORFs, NSP showed
99% sequence identity with ToLCPMV (accession no.
AM992534) and it ranged from 90-99%. Whereas it was
73.3% identical to ToLCNDV (accession no AY150305).
The maximum sequence identity to ToLCPMV isolate originating from India was 99% but to the isolates originating
from Iran it was 95%. Overall among ToLCPMV isolates,
sequence identity ranged from 92-99%. ToLCPMV MP
was 86% identical to MP of ToLCNDV (accession no
AY150304). Thus, DNA B might be a recombinant molecule where the MP is derived from DNA B of ToLCNDV
while the intergenic region and NSP are derived from yet
an unknown virus. The intergenic region of ToLCPMV
shows 86% nucleotide sequence identity to Indian isolate
(accession no. AM992534) whereas the identity to Iranian
isolate is 76% (accession no. FJ660442). NSP has a size of
555 nucleotides (184 amino acids) and it is truncated at
the N-terminus, since first 84 amino acids are missing in

comparison to the ToLCNDV sequences available in the
database (Figure 1B). The MP has a predicted size of 884
bases (294 amino acids) (Table: 2). Non-coding IR
sequences of DNA B are distinct from already published
sequences. The intergenic regions of DNA A and DNA B
show only 38.2% identity but share a 34-bp potential
stem-loop forming region (GGCCATTCGTATAATATTACCGAATGGCCGCGGT). This sequence has the conserved nonanucleotide sequence (TAATATTAC). The
iterated elements (iterons) were close to a TATA box
in the common region and were identified as GGTGTC
(Figure 2) being the same as those identified in DNA A of
ToLCPMV and ToLCNDV [22].
Efforts were made to identify a DNA B in muskmelon
having no truncation of the NSP gene. Three set of primers were designed in the NSP and non-coding
sequences of DNA B of ToLCNDV (Table: 1). None of
the primer sets was able to amplify a product of
approximately 2.8 kb. The ability of these sets of primers to amplify full-length DNA B was confirmed by
the use of these primers on tomato samples infected
experimentally with ToLCNDV. All sets of primers

amplified products of the expected size. To further rule
out the possible presence of other DNA B, phi29 polymerase was used which has the ability to amplify circular molecules. The amplified product was restricted with
PstI endonuclease (for which there are two restriction
sites in DNA A) yielding two bands of the expected
sizes (969 bases and 1786 bases). The DNA B of
ToLCPMV has two PstI restriction sites that are separated by 62 bases. The restriction analysis suggested the
presence of a single type of DNA B of ToLCPMV and
the absence of DNA B of ToLCNDV (results not
shown).
Phylogenetic analysis of ToLCPMV DNA A and DNA B

A phylogenetic analysis, based upon an alignment of the
complete DNA A sequence of ToLCPMV with selected
other begomoviruses is shown in Figure 3A. This analysis
shows ToLCPMV to segregate with ToLCPMV isolates
reported from India [19] and Iran [20] followed by
Cucumber leaf curl virus (CuLCuV-[BD:06](acc. no.
EF450316); a begomovirus recently identified in Bangladesh). These two viruses group with, and are basal to, the
ToLCNDV isolates but distinct from Squash leaf curl
China virus (SLCCNV) isolates. This is well supported by
bootstrapping. A phylogenetic analysis based upon an
alignment of the complete DNA B sequence of ToLCPMV
with selected other begomoviruses is shown in Figure 3B.
In this analysis ToLCPMV is again basal to the ToLCNDV
isolates which form a clade distinct from the SLCCNV isolates. It is also noteworthy that the DNA B of Tomato leaf
curl Gujarat virus (ToLCGV-[IN:Var:01]) is included in
this analysis and shows it to have a ToLCNDV-like DNA
B, as discussed later. The position of ToLCPMV in the
tree is well supported by bootstrapping.

Infectivity of ToLCPMV clones from muskmelon

The infectivity of ToLCPMV clones was assessed by Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation to Nicotiana benthamiana (Figure 4 and Table: 3). Plants inoculated with
ToLCPMV DNA A alone (Figure 4A) or ToLCPMV DNA
A and DNA B did not develop symptoms (Figure 4B),
even 2 months post-inoculation. However, diagnostic PCR
showed the presence of both ToLCPMV DNA A and
DNA B in systemic leaves.. In contrast, plants inoculated
with ToLCNDV DNA A and DNA B developed upward
leaf curl symptoms and vein swelling within 14 days
of inoculation (Figure 4E). These symptoms are typical
of ToLCNDV in N. benthamiana [18]. The inability
of ToLCPMV clones to cause disease symptoms in
N. benthamiana indicates that they are competent for systemic infection but unable to produce disease symptoms.
ToLCPMV DNA A and DNA B were inoculated by
biolistic methods. However, biolistic inoculation did not
result in typical disease symptoms. PCR with specific primers was used to confirm systemic infection. The results
showed the presence of both DNA A and DNA B in systemically infected leaves. This result shows that DNA B
of ToLCPMV is capable of movement with ToLCPMV
DNA A although the clone was not capable of inducing
typical disease symptoms.
ToLCNDV DNA B will support symptomatic infection of
ToLCPMV DNA A

To ascertain which of the components was responsible
for the lack of infectivity, the ToLCPMV clones were
inoculated as pseudo-recombinants with the components
of ToLCNDV. Inoculation of twenty N. benthamiana
plants with ToLCNDV DNA A and ToLCPMV DNA B
did not develop begomovirus symptoms (Figure 4F) but

phylogenetic analysis are Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV), Tomato mottle virus (ToMoV), Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), Squash leaf
curl China virus (SLCCNV), Tomato leaf curl Gujrat virus (ToLCGV), Cucumber leaf curl virus (CuLCuV), Luffa yellow mosaic virus (LYMV), Squash
leaf curl Philippines virus (SLCuPV). The phylogenetic trees are based on complete nucleotide sequences of ToLCPMV DNA A (Fig. 3A), complete
nucleotide sequences of ToLCPMV DNA B (Fig. 3B). Numbers at the nodes are percentage bootstrap confidence values (1000 replicates). Vertical

seven plants were found positive in PCR for the presence
of DNA B. In contrast, all the plants inoculated with
ToLCPMV DNA A and ToLCNDV DNA B developed
symptoms typical of ToLCNDV including upward leaf
curl and vein swelling symptoms 14 days post-inoculation (Table 3; Figure 4C). These results demonstrate that
the defect(s) in symptom induction by ToLCPMV clones
resides on DNA B. The earlier sequence analyses indicated that ToLCPMV DNA B contains a truncation of
the NSP gene due to a premature stop codon. This is
the likely cause of the lack of ability of ToLCPMV DNA
B to support symptoms development. The ability of
ToLCPMV to trans-replicate and to establish a systemic
infection with ToLCNDV also indicates that the Rep
encoded by ToLCPMV DNA A is able to interact with
the origin of replication of ToLCNDV. The sequence
analysis showed that the predicted iteron sequences of
ToLCPMV are the same as iterons of ToLCNDV [14]
and these elements are crucial in the interactions
required for Rep to initiate rolling-circle replication [24].
Inoculation of ToLCPMV DNA A with ToLCNDV DNA B
induces a hypersensitive response in muskmelon

Our data on infectivity in N. benthamiana showed that
ToLCPMV DNA A in association of DNA B of ToLCNDV

induced typical disease symptoms. The same combination
was tried in muskmelon to establish infectivity in this
host. Inoculated as well as systemic leaves showed hypersensitive response (Figure 5A). In systemic leaves this
appeared as leaves necrosis near the veins (Figure 5B). We
have previously shown that the expression of NSP of
ToLCNDV in transgenic plants induced hypersensitive
response which was dependant on growth stage of plant
[25]. We agroinfiltrated NSP of ToLCNDV cloned under
35S promoter while MP of ToLCNDV cloned under 35S
promoter was used as control (Figure 6B). No effect on
infiltration of 35S driven MP was found but the expression
of NSP developed necrotic lesions that spread out of infiltration point (Figure 6B).

Discussion
Phytopathogenic viruses are major constraints to agricultural productivity throughout the world. It is an unfortunate fact that Pakistan, in common with all other
countries of southern Asia, is home to members of virtually all taxonomic groups of plant-infecting viruses
[26-31] which, at least in part, explains the low agricultural productivity in the country. Prime amongst these
viruses are the begomoviruses that have appeared as
dominant pathogens on several crops. We show here that

muskmelon samples previously found positive for ZYMV
are co-infected with a begomovirus.
The complete nucleotide sequence of DNA A of begomoviruses is sufficient for identification and classification
of begomoviruses. Viruses that share more than 90%
sequence identity are considered as strain of the same
virus while DNA sequence identity below 89% is considered as new species [32]. Based on this threshold value,
the begomovirus identified in muskmelon is an isolate of
ToLCPMV. The high levels of nucleotide sequence similarity, of both DNA A (86%) and DNAB (73%), between
ToLCPMV and ToLCNDV indicate that they have a
recent common ancestor and that ToLCPMV represents
a lineage that has diverged from ToLCNDV. ToLCNDV

Page 7 of 11

has frequently been identified in cucurbits [33-38]. However, Koch’s postulates for ToLCNDV causing diseases of
cucurbits have not been satisfied. ToLCNDV is a cosmopolitan species that occurs throughout southern Asia,
having been reported from Pakistan, India, Thailand and
Taiwan [39-43]. However, since no efforts were made in
these reports to inoculate clones on cucurbits, it is difficult to know whether an RNA virus was co-infecting
these cucurbits.
The genome organization of ToLCPMV is the typical
of Old World begomoviruses (having an AV2 gene) and
phylogenetic analysis (Figure 3) show it and ToLCNDV
to be most similar to (to group with) other begomoviruses with their center of diversity and origins lying in
southern Asia [39,14,40-42,25]. Recombination contributes to the genetic diversification of geminivirus populations and has been related to the emergence of some
serious plant diseases, as discussed earlier [44-48]. The
prerequisite for recombination to occur is co-infection
of the same cell of a host plant [49]. ToLCPMV DNA A
has high levels of sequence identity to ToLCNDV-IN
[PK:Kha:Chi:04] (accession number DQ116880) in the
virion-sense (including the intergenic region) and to
ToLCNDV-IN[IN:ND:AVT1] (AY428769) in the complementary-sense, indicating that this molecule is an
intraspecific recombinant. The geminiviruses evolve/
adapt by a number of mechanisms. Contrary to expectations, geminiviruses have nucleotide substitution rates
that are comparable to those of RNA viruses [50]. Such
high substitution rates would not be expected from a
virus that utilizes host-encoded DNA polymerases with
error correction. Additionally, recombination and component exchange (known as pseudo-recombination) are
the major processes of geminivirus evolution [46,51-54].
A prime example of this is the ongoing pandemic of
cassava mosaic disease that originated in northern
Uganda, spread across eastern Africa and continues to
spread throughout central and western Africa. The
severe cassava mosaic disease of the pandemic is attributed to a recombinant strain of East African cassava
mosaic virus known as the “Uganda Variant” [44].
Like the DNA A component, the DNA B component of
ToLCPMV is a recombinant. The complementary-sense

sequences of NSP are involved in nuclear localization
while C-terminal sequences are required for interaction
with the MP [55]. Thus, truncation of ToLCPMV NSP at
the N-terminus likely abolished the nuclear localization
of the protein resulting in a defective molecule which
cannot support infection or the protein is not produced
at all since it is prematurely truncated. The NSP of
ToLCNDV virus is a pathogenicity determinant where
N-terminal sequences of protein are required for pathogenicity [25]. PCR amplification with universal and specific DNA B primers failed to show the presence of an
intact DNA B in muskmelon samples, indicating that this
defective molecule is the only DNA B present in muskmelon. We propose that truncated DNA B was selected
on muskmelon probably because NSP was recognized by
host defense system. Thus, DNA B with truncated NSP
was maintained on muskmelon. A recent example of a
begomovirus associated with resistance breakdown in
cotton lacked an intact TrAP, probably to avoid host
defense targeting the TrAP [56].
The integrity of the genomes of bipartite begomoviruses
is maintained by them having compatible Rep binding
sequences in the CR. Thus, the DNA A-encoded Rep is
able to recognize and initiate the replication of both components [57-59,23]. Iteron sequences are usually speciesspecific, thus in most cases, the Rep of one virus would
not be expected to recognize the iteron sequences of a distinct species [60-62]. The iteron sequences of ToLCNDV

have been identified experimentally [63]. ToLCNDV and
ToLCPMV have the same Rep binding sites and this likely
explains our experimental finding that ToLCPMV DNA A
is able to trans-replicate ToLCNDV DNA B and initiate a
productive, symptomatic systemic infection of plants.
ToLCNDV is a part of viral complex consisting of several
DNA As that exchange DNA Bs readily. Here evidence is
provided that, in addition to ToLCNDV and Tomato leaf
curl Gujarat virus [64], the complex also encompasses
ToLCPMV. This ability to readily form genomic reassortments (pseudo-recombination) is probably an adaptation
that gives the virus complex an evolutionary advantage.
Since DNA B components are involved in movement in
plants [65,66], and thus host range determination [67-69],
the ability to readily interact with distinct DNA B components will undoubtedly allow the viruses of the complex to
alter/adapt their host ranges to take advantage of new
niches.
For bipartite begomoviruses DNA B is considered as an
integral part of the genome (a genomic component),
rather than a satellite, due to the presence of the conserved region (CR) which is present in both components.
Satellites are defined as molecules which share no significant sequence similarity with their helper viruses but
require them for replication and movement in host plant
[70]. Although clearly a DNA B, the lack of appreciable
sequence similarity between the DNA A and DNA B
components of ToLCPMV, with the exception of the

iteron sequences and nonanucleotide sequence, means
that the ToLCPMV DNA B component could be deemed
a satellite. This contention is strengthened by the ability
of the DNA A to readily exchange the component, a feature in common with satellites such as DNA betasatellite.
Likely, in this case, the ToLCPMV DNA B is maintained
as a satellite (although the question remains as to
whether the NSP gene is expressed). Possibly then, in
muskmelon, the ToLCPMV DNA B is maintained as a
poorly-functional satellite which is not required for the
infection. A recent analysis of DNA A and DNA B
sequences has suggested that the two components differ
in their evolution and DNA B may be considered as a
satellite [71]. Further investigation will be needed to
address this question. A possible explanation is that NSP
being a pathogenicity determinant is the target of host
defense as has been demonstrated previously [25]. Since
all plants where ToLCPMV is found were earlier
reported to be infected with ZYMV [10], there is a possibility that the defect in NSP is complemented by ZYMV.
The presence of this defective DNA B in many plants
and in geographically distant fields of muskmelon, as well
as in various cucurbit species, however, suggests that this
molecule may play an important part. A satellite that
provides no selective advantage to a virus would be
expected to be lost quite rapidly.
The data presented here show that ToLCPMV is widespread in the region that includes Iran, Pakistan and India
and therefore an emerging virus on several crops. Unfortunately, the earlier reports have not demonstrated infectivity
analysis and therefore, it is not possible to assess whether
DNA B cloned from India and Iran was infectious. The
role of ToLCPMV in muskmelon leaf curl disease remains
to be demonstrated. We suggest that dual infection of a

begomovirus with a defective DNA B and ZYMV may be
important for disease symptoms. The lack of availability of
infectious clones of ZYMV precludes us satisfying Koch’s
postulates for the disease in muskmelon. Our earlier results
showed that mechanical inoculation of sap from infected
muskmelon to healthy melon plants developed disease
symptoms [10]. However, the possibility that begomovirus
was also transmitted by sap inoculation cannot be ruled
out. Our results show that ToLCPV is infectious to experimental hosts when inoculated with DNA B of ToLCNDV.
Our recent results from cotton show that the begomovirus
isolated from resistant cotton lack TrAP [56]. We hypothesized that begomoviruses may adopt to resistant host by
truncation of an important gene. The maintenance of the
defective DNA B in all field samples suggests a role for
DNA B. It therefore appears that a synergistic interaction
with ZYMV may have compensated for the defective NSP.
We are trying to understand the possible synergistic interaction by cloning of helper component proteinase of
ZYMV in a RNA virus vector such as PVX.
