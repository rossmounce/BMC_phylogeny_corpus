Abstract
Background: SAL1 (salivary lipocalin) is a member of the OBP (Odorant Binding Protein) family and is involved in
chemical sexual communication in pig. SAL1 and its relatives may be involved in pheromone and olfactory
receptor binding and in pre-mating behaviour. The evolutionary history and the selective pressures acting on SAL1
and its orthologous genes have not yet been exhaustively described. The aim of the present work was to study
the evolution of these genes, to elucidate the role of selective pressures in their evolution and the consequences
for their functions.
Results: Here, we present the evolutionary history of SAL1 gene and its orthologous genes in mammals. We found
that (1) SAL1 and its related genes arose in eutherian mammals with lineage-specific duplications in rodents, horse
and cow and are lost in human, mouse lemur, bushbaby and orangutan, (2) the evolution of duplicated genes of
horse, rat, mouse and guinea pig is driven by concerted evolution with extensive gene conversion events in
mouse and guinea pig and by positive selection mainly acting on paralogous genes in horse and guinea pig,
(3) positive selection was detected for amino acids involved in pheromone binding and amino acids putatively
involved in olfactory receptor binding, (4) positive selection was also found for lineage, indicating a species-specific
strategy for amino acid selection.
Conclusions: This work provides new insights into the evolutionary history of SAL1 and its orthologs. On one
hand, some genes are subject to concerted evolution and to an increase in dosage, suggesting the need for
homogeneity of sequence and function in certain species. On the other hand, positive selection plays a role in the
diversification of the functions of the family and in lineage, suggesting adaptive evolution, with possible
consequences for speciation and for the reinforcement of prezygotic barriers.

Background
The barriers that lead to divergence of species during
the course of evolution were classified by Dobzhansky in
two categories: prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive
barriers [1]. Postzygotic reproductive barriers concern
all the events that occur after fertilization, such as
reduced hybrid viability and fertility, while prezygotic
reproductive barriers concern isolation of sexual partners via ecological, temporal or behavioral isolation.
Pheromones play a key role in pre-mating recognition
of sexual partners [2]. These compounds are defined as
substances released by an animal that are able to induce

specific behavioral and/or endocrinological reactions in
a sexual partner of the same species [3]. Through these
reactions, they could be involved in mate choice and
sexual selection.
Odorant binding proteins (OBP) are small soluble proteins that are present in the olfactory apparatus as well as
in biological fluids such as saliva, urine or vaginal discharge, and are able to bind pheromones (for review see
[4]). OBP are assumed to be directly involved in chemical
communication and in the pre-mating recognition process. Three hypotheses are proposed concerning their
mechanism of action. The first is that olfactory receptors
can recognize the OBP/pheromone complex, not just the
pheromone alone. The second hypothesis is that the pheromone can be transferred to olfactory receptors only if
assisted by the OBP. The third hypothesis is that the

ligand can spontaneously dissociate from the complex
with OBP and bind to the receptor as a “free pheromone”
[5].
The role of saliva in chemical communication between
males and females is well established in pig [6], like the
role of urine in mouse [7]. In pig, saliva contains the
pheromonal steroids 5a-androst-16-en-3-one and 5aandrost-16-en-3a-ol, as well as abundant quantities of
salivary lipocalin (SAL1), the most abundant OBP isolated from submaxillary glands of mature males. When
extracted from its source, this protein is associated with
both pheromonal steroids [8], and appears to play a key
role in the standing reflex in the sow [6] and also in the
boar’s libido [9]. SAL1 is also expressed in the nasal and
vomeronasal area, but devoid of ligand [10,11]. SAL1
exhibits a classical structure of lipocalins characterized
by a fully conserved N-terminal -G-X-W- motif and the
typical folding pattern of a nine-stranded antiparallel
b-barrel forming an internal ligand binding site for
small hydrophobic molecules [12], despite relatively low
sequence similarity [13]. SAL1 also possesses a glycosylation site on Asn53. Two natural variants have been
identified in which in three residues differ (Val61, Ile64
and Ala89 of isoform A are respectively Ala, Val and
Val in isoform B). Two residues (Val61 and Ala89) are
located inside the b-barrel while the third residue
(Ile64) is located next to the b-barrel, suggesting that
these minor structural differences lead to ligand binding
specificities [14].
Olfactory receptors are located on the olfactory sensory neurons of the main olfactory system in mammals
and on the vomeronasal organ in rodents and other
non-primate species [15]. Several authors examined the
evolution of olfactory receptors, but few studies of lipocalins and OBP have been performed. Ganfornina et al.
[16] undertook phylogenetic analysis of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic lipocalins and showed that this family
appeared early and is composed of 13 monophyletic
clades. These authors also showed that ancestral lipocalin clades in the phylogenetic tree are able to bind large
ligands while more recent lipocalin clades, such as
clades composed of OBP and MUP (Mouse Urinary
Protein), bind smaller ligands. They also found that later
clades had higher rates of amino acid substitution, more
flexible protein structures and greater ligand-binding
efficiency than more ancestral lipocalins.
Logan et al. [17] undertook an extensive study of the
Mup cluster in the mouse genome. They identified 21
Mup genes and 21 Mup pseudogenes on chromosome
4. They also identified Mup gene expansion in rat (9
genes and 13 pseudogenes), in horse (3 genes) and in
mouse lemur (2 genes and 1 pseudogene) in the same
syntenic region. Orangutan, chimpanzee, dog, pig (with
SAL1), bushbaby and rhesus monkey have only one

Page 2 of 14

Mup gene in the syntenic region. The inferred phylogeny, the accumulation of synonymous substitutions,
and the genomic organization of the Mup loci suggest
that gene expansion occurred independently in several
species [17].
In the light of previous analyses, the aim of the present work was to study the evolution of SAL1 which is
involved in pre-mating recognition in pig. We wanted to
determine if selective pressures act on these proteins
and to check if positive selection may play a role in
binding specificity toward ligands or olfactory receptors.

Results
Identification of SAL1 homologous genes, genomic
localization and phylogenetic study

We found similar sequences to pig SAL1 in 13 other
mammalian species: cow, horse, dog, guinea pig, rat,
mouse, rabbit, macaque, chimpanzee, gorilla, marmoset
and elephant (Figure 1 and table S1 in additional file 1).
The sequences identified were located at the same syntenic locus between the neighboring genes SLC46A2
and ZFP37 and form the SAL1 family. Putative pseudogenes were identified in mouse, rat, mouse lemur,
bushbaby and orangutan (Figure 1 and figure S1 in additional file 1). The exact number of genes we identified
in mouse, rat, chimpanzee, guinea pig, cow, mouse
lemur, orangutan and bushbaby differed from that
found by Logan et al. [17], who failed to identify several
of these genes in a previous study, probably due to
lower quality genome annotation. Mouse and rat genes
form two important clusters of duplicates on chromosome 4 and 5, respectively, composed of 21 genes and
21 pseudogenes in mouse, and 10 genes and 11 pseudogenes in rat. Duplicates are present in cow (2 genes),
horse (5 genes) and guinea pig (5 genes). All genes of
each species form a cluster, suggesting cis-duplication
events after speciation. Pig, dog, rhesus monkey and
chimpanzee possess a single gene similar to SAL1 in the
same syntenic region. In human, the gene is a known
pseudogene [18] due to a G-to-A nucleotide substitution
at the donor site of the second intron, resulting in the
split of the ORF of the coding sequences. This substitution was not found in chimpanzee and other primates.
In the Neandertal Genome [19], we found the same
genomic organization as in human in ENSEMBL [20],
namely the two genes SLC46A2 and ZFP37 surrounding
a predicted SAL1 pseudogene. After multiple sequence
alignment of this genomic region between chimpanzee,
gorilla, Neandertal and human, we found the same substitution in the Neandertal genome, suggesting the
emergence of this mutation in the common ancestor of
Neandertal and human (Figure 2). The SLC46A2/ZFP37
locus is not present in frog (Xenopus tropicalis), birds
(Gallus gallus, Taeniopygia guttata), bony fishes

supported by very high bootstrap values (94.5 to 100%),
suggesting that gene duplications occurred independently in mouse, rat, guinea pig, horse, and cow. The
relationships between some species were not clear
because of low bootstrap values for some nodes (34.3 to
68.1%), even if rodents and primate clades were supported by high bootstrap values (99.7 and 100%, respectively). The percentage of identity between sequences of
this family is highly variable, not only between species
but also between paralogs. In mouse, for example,
Mup11 and Mup18 amino acid sequences are strictly
identical. In rat, some paralogs are more distinct and
pairwise identity ranges from 84 to 97%, so we tested
paralog datasets for gene conversion events.

gene conversion events, we searched for statistical evidence of this phenomenon using the GENECONV program [21]. The first control analysis of “Randomize
sites”, which randomizes the order of polymorphic sites
before analysis, detected no gene conversion event in
horse, rat, mouse and guinea pig datasets, implying the
results of subsequent GENECONV analyses are reliable.
As shown in Table 1, most of the paralogs of guinea pig
and mouse are involved in gene conversion events while
in horse and in rat, respectively 3 and 4 genes out of a
total of 5 and 10 are involved. The length of the converted tract varied greatly among species, from 11 bp
for the shortest tract in guinea pig, to 529 bp for the
longest tract in mouse. To determine which type of
selective pressure (positive, neutral or purifying selection) shaped the evolution of these genes after gene
duplication, we assessed selective pressure using the
nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio (ω)
with codon-substitution models, where ω< 1 is purifying
selection, ω = 1 is neutral evolution and ω > 1 is consistent with positive Darwinian selection [22,23]. We performed a branch-site-based analysis by defining each
branch supporting a paralogous gene as a foreground
branch for PAML. In each species where the SAL1 gene
has been duplicated, only one gene underwent positive
selection (Table 2). Significant Likelihood Ratio Tests
(LRTs) were found for the five genes, confirming that a
positive selection model fits the data. For cow, mouse
and rat genes, only a few (one or two) positively selected
sites were detected, whereas in horse and particularly in
guinea pig, more positively selected sites (6 and 15 sites,
respectively) were detected.
Positively selected sites in the SAL1 family and putative
biological significance

To identify the selective pressure on the SAL1 family in
eutherian mammals, we performed a site-based analysis
with PAML (Table 3). After removal of gaps, 119 sites
were analyzed using the codeml [24] and Selecton [25]

programs. In both comparisons (M1a vs. M2a, M8a vs.
M8), LRTs were significant (p < 0.001) for the dataset.
Moreover, the AICc score of MEC was lower than that
of M8a, indicating that MEC fits the data better. Comparisons of the LRT and AICc scores were significant,
implying that selective forces varied among sites
between genes. According to M2a and M8 models, 23
to 29% of sites underwent positive selection, respectively. Four sites (9V, 72Y, 73A and 90E) were identified
as positively selected sites with a p-value of at least 95%
by the three models (M2a, M8 and MEC), a strong indication of positive selection for these four amino acids.
Six sites (10T, 62R, 75C, 86A, 159R and 162Q) were
identified by the M2a and M8 models. Six sites (6Q,
11S, 63K, 71F, 113G and 119L) were identified by M8,
and one site (163L) was identified by MEC.
To determine if positively selected sites are located in
regions of interest, these sites were mapped on the 3D
structure of SAL1 (PDB:1GM6) (Figure 4). To assess the
biological significance of these sites, ligand binding sites
determined by Spinelli et al. [13] were also mapped on
the 3D structure. Interestingly, three sites under positive
selection matched amino acids that are directly involved
in androstenol and androstenone binding (73A, 75C and
119L). Side chains of amino acids involved in ligand
binding projected into the ligand binding pocket, which
is formed by a relatively small internal cavity poorly
accessible to solvent, whereas side chains of the majority
of positively selected sites projected out of the binding
pocket, except for three amino acids, suggesting that
positive selection does not only play a role in pheromone
binding specificity, but also in interaction with partners
such as receptors. Relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of
positively selected sites was determined by ASAView and
is shown in Figure 5. We used the same classification as
Rost et al., [26]: a residue is classified as buried when the
RSA is <9%, as exposed when the RSA is >35%, and as
intermediate when the RSA is between 9 and 35%. We
found three buried sites (75C, 119L and 159R), six intermediate sites (9V, 62R, 63K, 71F, 73A and 163L) and
seven exposed sites (10T, 11S, 72Y, 86A, 90E, 113G and
162Q), indicating that most of the positively selected
sites are located at the surface of the protein, and are perhaps involved in other functions than pheromone binding, however these remain to be identified. We observed
no specific clustering of these sites at the surface of the
protein exposed to the solvent (Figure 4).
Positive selection events in marmoset, dog, guinea pig,
horse and mouse clades

The comparison between site models of PAML detects
positive selection only if the ω ratio averaged over all
branches on the tree is greater than 1, but positive
selection can also be expected to affect only a few

selection in these species, but we were unable to identify
any selected sites in rabbit (Table 4). For the other species, positively selected sites were mapped on the SAL1
structure. Mapping of site 14H identified in dog was not
possible because this amino acid is situated at the beginning of the N-terminal end, which was not crystallized.
Sites identified in marmoset, mouse and dog were not
located in the binding pocket of the protein unlike some
sites identified in guinea pig and horse. For the two latter clades, one (75C) and two (75C and 119L) positively
selected sites, respectively, matched pheromone binding
sites (Figure 6).

Discussion
Phylogenomic analyses showed that the SAL1 family originated in eutherian mammals and that genes belonging
to this family were duplicated after speciation events in
five mammalian species. In certain living species, such
as mouse lemur, bushbaby, orangutan and human, the
gene has been lost, as it has in the Neanderthal genome.
We can date the loss of the gene in hominid before the
Neandertal-modern human split, 400,000 to 350,000

years ago [28]. The number of duplication events varies
greatly among species. In mouse and rat, massive cisduplication events have occurred, with respectively 42
and 22 genes in the cluster, followed by gene loss with
respectively 21 and 11 pseudogenes.
Gene duplication represents a source of new genetic
material, and can lead to evolutionary novelties. The
fate of duplicated genes can follow different models of
evolution, with different selective pressures acting on
the genes [29]. We checked for a change in selective
pressure in all paralogs identified in the SAL1 family
and found that only a few paralogs underwent positive
selection: one gene in cow, guinea pig, horse, mouse
and rat. Moreover, few sites of these genes were identified. A large proportion (66%) of each gene evolved
under neutrality and only a small proportion (2 to 5%)
under positive selection. However, among the single
genes identified as positively selected in guinea pig and
horse, a larger proportion of sites evolved under positive
selection (18 and 72%, respectively) and more sites were
identified as being positively selected (15 sites in guinea
pig and 6 sites in horse).

Because sequences of some paralogs share high similarity, we searched for gene conversion in our paralogous
gene datasets and found extensive interlocus gene conversion events in mouse and guinea pig, and to a lesser extent
in horse and rat. Karn and Laukaitis [30] compared the
mouse Mup cluster with a gene tree published by Mudge
et al. [31] and suggested that concerted evolution masked
the common origin of the gene and neighboring pseudogenes [30]. Our results confirmed this hypothesis, indicating extensive gene conversion in the mouse Mup cluster.
This extensive gene conversion phenomenon led to
sequence homogenization and is the cause of the concerted evolution of these genes. Such extensive concerted
evolution suggests that, at least in mouse and guinea pig,
both maintenance of sequence homogeneity and increased
gene dosage are important for these species. The evolution
of SAL1 paralogs resembles the evolution of the b-globin
gene family. In this family, paralogous copies evolved
under a process of functional divergence and there is evidence for two gene conversion events in mouse and goat
clusters composed of b-globin duplicated genes There is
also evidence for variable selective pressure among sites
for b and g-globin genes with 4 to 9% of sites evolving
under positive selection [32].
By combining phylogenetic, gene conversion and
selective pressure results on paralogs evolution, we can

try to describe the fate of duplicated genes, in which
duplication can be seen as an advantageous phenomenon for the species concerned, by combining two scenarios from Innan and Kondrashov [29]. In the first
scenario, one could consider the massive duplication in
rat and mouse as a gene amplification where the
increase in dosage of these genes is beneficial. This scenario of evolution corresponds to category IIa described
by Innan and Kondrashov [29]. In this model, if selection for the duplicated copy is weak, pseudogenization
can occur if a null mutation is fixed, which is the case
in both mouse and rat. The occurrence of gene conversions that maintain sequence similarity and promote
conservation of gene copies could be consistent with
that hypothesis, but the high frequency of gene conversion events is not restricted to mouse and rat. In fact,
guinea pigs, which do not harbor large gene amplifications, have the highest frequency of conversion events
per gene copy among the species tested. The beneficial
increase in dosage has already been shown to apply to
genes that mediate the interaction between the organism
and the environment [33], as is true of genes of the
SAL1 family. However, we also showed that among the
many duplicates in rat, mouse and guinea pig, one gene
per species is under positive selection so increased gene
dosage and gene conversion events are not the only

driving force of the evolution of these genes in these
species. For these positively selected duplicates, it is the
scenario of the category III [29] which fits, where a new
copy can be fixed and preserved by positive selection,
leading to the possible emergence of a new function for
the positively selected gene.
To study selective pressure in the SAL1 family in
more detail, we tested the amino acids changing occurring in the 12 branches supporting species as positively
selected by PAML. Our results showed that marmoset,
dog, guinea pig, horse and mouse branches underwent
positive selection just after divergence. This evolutionary
scenario likely reflects the ability of the SAL1 family to
diverge and to adapt to new behaviour between sexual
partners. A previous study on mouse and rat genes
identified 32 sites as positively selected on rodent coorthologs of SAL1 [34]. In that study, mouse and rat
genes were considered together, whereas in our study,
mouse and rat genes were analyzed separately, this

explains the difference between the two results. Indeed,
we only identified one site under positive selection in
mouse and no positive selection in rat. The difference
between the two results is also due to a difference in
the probability threshold chosen to determine whether a
site is subject to positive selection or not. In Emes et al.
[34], a site was said to be positively selected if the probability for one model is > 0.90 and > 0.50 for at least
one other model. In our study, we chose to consider
only sites whose probability was > 0.95 in order to minimize false positives.
Finally, we compared tests of variable selective pressures
for the family using several PAML codon models. We
found evidence for positive selection in a small proportion
of sites. Because positive selection is known to play a role
in the diversification of protein functions, we mapped all
positively selected sites on the 3D structure, in order to
assess their biological significance for the gene family as a
whole and for each species independently. Apart from the

Meslin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/148

three amino acids that were under positive selection and
involved in ligand binding, the other amino acids identified by site models of PAML analyses projected out of the
binding pocket. Moreover, the majority of these sites were
exposed to solvent. If these sites were involved in the
interaction with pheromones, they would be found preferentially in the hydrophobic core and would be buried. We
thus propose that positive selection plays a role not only
in the binding specificity but also in the interaction
between the protein and its environment. We were not
able to draw any conclusions concerning selective pressures on each site involved in ligand binding, because gaps
in the multiple sequence alignment made these calculations impossible. Nevertheless, for the 16 amino acids
involved in pheromone binding, we identified three sites
that probably evolved under purifying constraints (87Y,
91N and 93F) and four sites that probably evolved under
relaxed constraints (60F, 85V, 121E and 123Y). The three
sites that evolved under purifying constraints may be
essential for protein function, because they were well conserved during the evolution of the family. In rodent populations, Emes et al. [34] found that MUPs, which are coorthologs of SAL1, exhibited amino acids under positive
selection, and that these positively selected sites were
located at the interface between MUPs and their receptors,
probably V2R receptors on the vomeronasal organ. They
also found evidence that olfactory receptors, such as V2Rs,
underwent positive selection. The hypothesis they
proposed is that this adaptation phenomenon is due to
conspecific competition, resulting in well adapted pheromones, pheromone binding proteins such as MUP, and
olfactory receptors [34]. Our results allow us to extend this
hypothesis because positive selection also drives the evolution of pheromone binding proteins in other eutherian
mammals. So for all the family, and not just for rodents,
there is an adaptive evolution of these proteins to their
ligands and maybe their receptors, too. It would be interesting to test if V2R receptors are subject to positive selection, not only in rodents but also in other mammals.
Several authors reported evidence for positive selection on
other OR genes in mammals [35-39], with possible involvement of positively selected sites in the binding property
of proteins. Moreno-Estrada [36] suggested that positive
selection could be at the origin of a new ligand binding
capability or the modification of odorant perception and
could improve the overall degenerated OR gene repertoire,
at least in human. In insects, co-evolution of the two
enzymes involved in the pheromone biosynthetic pathway
and in the pheromone receptor has been suggested to play
a role in the speciation process [40]. It would be interesting to test co-evolution of enzyme/receptor, pheromone/
receptor and OBP/receptor in mammals.
In mice, MUPs are important for the delivery, via
urine, of chemical signals conveying information about

Page 11 of 14

the sex and hormonal status of the animal who release
the scent mark [41]. In pig, SAL1 may be involved in premating recognition by binding pig specific sex pheromones in saliva [8]. In both species, these proteins are
involved in conspecific recognition in the context of
reproduction. When the genomes of marine mammals
are completed, it will be interesting to search for SAL1
orthologs. Indeed, in such a different environment, chemical communication between sexual partners is probably not mediated by the same olfactory cues as in
terrestrial mammals. If a SAL1 ortholog is found in marine mammal genomes, it will be interesting to discover if
it evolved under relaxed constraints or positive selection.
It is well established that reproduction is a very competitive process, and that selective pressures on genes involved
in the process are not rare (for a review, see [42]). Positive
Darwinian selection is not atypical, especially for genes
involved in sensory perception and mate choice [43]. Our
results demonstrated that (i) positively selected sites differ
between genes and (ii) positively selected sites are involved
in ligand binding and are putatively involved in receptor
binding. Such a selective pressure on these proteins could
be at the origin of a divergence process between species
and thus contribute to the speciation phenomenon by
reinforcing prezygotic barriers. To test this hypothesis, we
performed in vitro mutagenesis experiments on SAL1, but
the poor folding of the resulting proteins prevented further
experimentation.

Conclusions
The SAL1 gene family originated in eutherian mammals
and duplicated after speciation in cow, horse, guinea pig
and rodents. Some duplicated genes underwent concerted evolution with extensive gene conversion. Others
were subject to positive selection at different sites, and
our knowledge of the 3D structure of this protein suggests that the selected sites are involved in pheromone
binding and possibly in olfactory receptor binding. This
result suggests a functional divergence between species
because positively selected sites differ between species.
All these data suggest that the evolution of the SAL1
family allows a species-specific strategy to transduce
pheromonal signals in mammals, reinforcing species
divergence through species-specific sexual behaviour.
Methods
Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses

The protein sequence of the pig salivary lipocalin
(SAL1) was retrieved from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) [44] (NP_998979.1). Proteins
from other species were searched by using TBLASTN
with porcine protein sequence as the query against all
mammalian genomes available on the NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/) [45] and ENSEMBL

Meslin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/148

databases (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) [46].
Identified proteins were then located on genomes for
syntenic analyses of the most recent genome sequence
assemblies: pig (Sus scrofa: ENSEMBL Sscrofa9), cow
(Bos Taurus: NCBI Btau5.2), horse (Equus caballus:
NCBI EquCab2.0), dog (Canis familiaris: ENSEMBL
CanFam2.0), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus: ENSEMBL
cavPor3), rat (Rattus norvegicus: NCBI RGSC 3.4),
mouse (Mus musculus: NCBIM37), rabbit (Oryctolagus
cuniculus: ENSEMBL OryCun2), rhesus monkey
(Macaca mulatta: NCBI Build 1.2), chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes: NCBI Build 2.1), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla:
ENSEMBL gorGor3), marmoset (Callithrix jacchus:
ENSEMBL C_jacchus3.2.1) and elephant (Loxodonta
Africana: ENSEMBL loxAfr3). To improve homology
assignment, we only included genes from the same syntenic region in the final dataset. Sequences with no syntenic information were discarded. No genes were
identified in other available mammalian genomes, and
existing genome assemblies did not allow us to identify
the syntenic region. Multiple sequence alignments were
performed using the Clustal W algorithm [47]. The
chimpanzee sequence was removed from the dataset in
order to have the most possible informative sites. All
alignment gap sites were removed before phylogenetic
analyses. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using
maximum likelihood (ML) in PhyML 3.0 [48] in order
to establish orthologous and paralogous relationships
among the gene datasets. Bootstrap values [49] were
estimated with 1000 replications and the tree was rooted
using the midpoint rooting method. Orthology and
paralogy relationships were inferred from the resulting
phylogenetic tree.
Gene conversion

The four clusters of paralogs identified for the guinea
pig, horse, rat and mouse were tested for interlocus
gene conversion, i.e. nonreciprocal transfer of genetic
information between genes of the same locus, using
GENECONV version 1.81 [21], which is a widely used
method for detecting partial gene conversion [50].
Each subset alignment was analyzed using the Clustal
W algorithm [47] to search for pairs of sequences sufficiently similar to suggest gene conversion events.
Three p-values were calculated and compared to
assess the significance of the results. Evidence for
gene conversion was strong when a fragment had a pvalue < 0.05 for at least two different types of statistical tests. In each alignment, indels and missing data
were treated as a single polymorphism. All polymorphic sites were tested for evidence of gene conversion using adjusted mismatch penalties of 0, 1 or 2, to
enable detection of both ancient and recent gene conversion events.

Evolutionary analyses

To investigate selective pressure, we used the CODEML
application in the PAML package version 4.4 [24],
which allows the ratio dN/dS to vary across codons and
estimates the probability for each codon to be under
positive selection. The alignments resulted from Clustal
W [47] and PAL2NAL [51].
Study of selective pressure in the SAL1 family

To determine if selective pressure varied among sites in
the SAL1 family, we used site models implemented in
PAML [52], which allows the ω ratio to vary among
sites [52,53]. Like for reconstruction of the phylogenetic
tree, the chimpanzee sequence (the shortest sequence)
was removed in order to have the most possible informative sites. We used three pairs of models including
M1a (nearly neutral: 0 <ω0 <1 and ω1 = 1) versus M2a
(positive selection: 0 <ω0 < 1, ω1 = 1 and ω2 >1) [52],
M8a (beta &ω s = 1: 0 <ω < 1 and ω s = 1) versus M8
[54] and MEC (a combined mechanistic-empirical
model implemented in the Selecton server, http://selecton.tau.ac.il/index.html) [25,55] versus M8a and the
PhyML generated tree for the analysis. Likelihood ratio
tests were used to compare log likelihood values for
M1a vs. M2a and M8a vs. M8 [52]. The Akaike information criterion (AICc score) was used to compare M8a
and MEC [55]. Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) method
[56] implemented in PAML was used to estimate posterior probabilities of selection on each codon, probabilities > 0.95 were considered significant.
Study of selective pressure on species and paralogs

To determine whether different species underwent selective pressure, we used the branch-site models of PAML
[27,57], which estimate different dN/dS values among
branches and among sites. These models can detect a
short episode of positive selection if it occurs in a small
fraction of amino acids. We tested 13 branches as the
foreground branch (i.e. the branch for which positive
selection is allowed), eight branches leading to a species
(pig, dog, rabbit, macaque, human, gorilla, marmoset and
elephant) and five internal branches situated after speciation and before duplication events (in cow, horse, guinea
pig, rat and mouse). Figure 3 shows which branches on
the phylogenetic tree were tested for positive species
selection. We tested each individual branch that led to a
paralog in order to detect selective pressures following
duplication events. We also used the PhyML generated
tree for the analysis. Two models were used to test for
positive selection, one model called ‘alternative’ in which
the foreground branch may have some sites under positive selection, and one model called ‘null’ in which the
foreground branch may have different proportions of
sites under neutral evolution than the background
branch. For the ‘alternative’ model, three classes were
defined: ω0: dN/dS < 1, ω1: dN/dS = 1 and ω2: dN/dS≥1,

Meslin et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:148
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/148

while in the ‘null’ model, ω2 was fixed to 1. Like for the
site model, LRT [52] and BEB [56] were used.

Putative function of positively selected sites

To assess the functionality of positively selected sites, the
sites were positioned on the SAL1 structure (PDB: 1GM6
[13]) and their positions evaluated against the accessible
surface area (ASA) of amino acids in SAL1 as determined
by ASAView [58]. SAL1 androstenol and androstenone
binding sites were previously determined by Spinelli et al.
[13]. These amino acids were positioned on the SAL1
structure. Molecular graphics images were produced
using the UCSF Chimera package [59].
