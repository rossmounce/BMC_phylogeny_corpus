Abstract
Background: Populations of the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus appear to flourish in heavily
polluted and geographically separated Superfund sites. Populations from three Superfund sites
(New Bedford Harbor, MA, Newark Bay, NJ, and Elizabeth River, VA) have independently evolved
adaptive resistance to chemical pollutants. In these polluted populations, natural selection likely has
altered allele frequencies of loci that affect fitness or that are linked to these loci. The aim of this
study was to identify loci that exhibit non-neutral behavior in the F. heteroclitus genome in polluted
populations versus clean reference populations.
Results: To detect signatures of natural selection and thus identify genetic bases for adaptation to
anthropogenic stressors, we examined allele frequencies for many hundreds of amplified fragment
length polymorphism markers among populations of F. heteroclitus. Specifically, we contrasted
populations from three Superfund sites (New Bedford Harbor, MA, Newark Bay, NJ, and Elizabeth
River, VA) to clean reference populations flanking the polluted sites. When empirical FST values
were compared to a simulated distribution of FST values, 24 distinct outlier loci were identified
among pairwise comparisons of pollutant impacted F. heteroclitus populations and both surrounding
reference populations. Upon removal of all outlier loci, there was a strong correlation (R2 = 0.79,
p < 0.0001) between genetic and geographical distance. This apparently neutral evolutionary
pattern was not evident when outlier loci were included (R2 = 0.092, p = 0.0721). Two outlier loci
were shared between New Bedford Harbor and Elizabeth River populations, and two different loci
were shared between Newark Bay and Elizabeth River populations.
Conclusion: In total, 1% to 6% of loci are implicated as being under selection or linked to areas
of the genome under selection in three F. heteroclitus populations that reside in polluted estuaries.
Shared loci among polluted sites indicate that selection may be acting on multiple loci involved in
adaptation, and loci shared between polluted sites potentially are involved in a generalized adaptive
response.

Background
The genetic basis of adaptation is a fundamental issue in
evolutionary biology. Much of the research in this field

has been focused on the classic model systems of Drosophila [1-13] and Arabidopsis [14-18]. Recently, insight
into adaptation in non-model species has become possiPage 1 of 12

ble due to advances in molecular biology and statistics
[19-31]. This recent expansion into studies of non-model
systems allows further development of evolutionary inferences [32], such as the role that selection, mutation, gene
flow, and drift play in adaptation [33]. A powerful
approach to understand genome-wide adaptation is to
investigate independent natural populations that inhabit
environments with strong selective pressures.
One species that has adapted to a wide range of estuarine
environments is the teleost fish, Fundulus heteroclitus [34].
F. heteroclitus is widely distributed along the United States'
eastern seaboard from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to northeastern Florida [35]. Subpopulations of F. heteroclitus
inhabit clean estuaries as well as those heavily impacted
by chemical pollutants (reviewed in [36]). Three wellknown polluted sites where F. heteroclitus reside are New
Bedford Harbor (Massachusetts), Newark Bay (New Jersey), and Elizabeth River (Norfolk, VA). All three sites
have been identified by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) as Superfund sites (part of the federal government's program to clean up the nation's uncontrolled
hazardous waste sites) and contain high levels of a variety
of lipophilic, persistent and toxic contaminants worthy of
remediation using Federal funds. All three Superfund sites
are highly contaminated with chemical pollutants that are
broadly classified as aromatics. New Bedford Harbor is
polluted with extremely high levels of polychlorinated
biphenyls [37] as well as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCD), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and several trace
metals [37,38]. Newark Bay is most notorious for containing 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) as well
as other dioxins [39,40] and also is contaminated with
heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs and PAHs [41]. The Elizabeth River is predominantly contaminated with creosote,
comprised of a complex mixture of PAHs [42-44].
F. heteroclitus from these chronically polluted areas are
resistant to the aromatic hydrocarbons in their environment as compared to nearby fish from relatively clean
environments [45-52]. Resistance in first and second generation embryos from New Bedford Harbor and Elizabeth
River and first generation embryos from depurated
Newark Bay fish suggests that differential survival is due to
genetic adaptation rather than physiological induction.
Investigating and comparing F. heteroclitus from these
three sites provides the opportunity to study similarities
and differences in adaptation to differing chemical pollutant and resistance to general stress conditions among
populations.
Previous work to elucidate mechanisms of resistance and
the underlying genetic basis in F. heteroclitus from these
three sites has investigated the refractory phenotype of the
xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P4501A

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/282

(CYP1A) in polluted populations [47,48,53-55], epigenetic silencing through CpG methylation of promoter
regions of the CYP1A 5' promoter region [56], and elimination of contaminants through the induction of other
phase I, II, and III enzymes [55,57-59], many by way of
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway (reviewed
in [60]). Yet, none of these research efforts has completely
accounted for the differences in the resistance phenotypes
between polluted and reference site fish in New Bedford
Harbor, Newark Bay and Elizabeth River, nor has the
genetic basis for resistance been elucidated.
In contrast to a candidate gene approach, our strategy to
begin to understand the genetic mechanisms that enable
F. heteroclitus populations to inhabit these highly polluted sites was to screen the genome for selectively
important loci. The premise is that loci under selection
will have patterns of variation statistically different from
the majority of neutral loci [61]. Loci that have a large
difference in allele frequencies between populations
with respect to what would be expected under the neutral expectation are outliers. The identification of these
outliers provides evidence for which and how many loci
may be involved in the evolutionary adaptation to
anthropogenic pollution.
Loci can have significantly different frequencies relative to
other neutral loci for many reasons. To obviate the detection of outliers due to genetic drift rather than selection,
our sampling scheme contrasted each polluted population with two reference populations that were geographically more distant from each other than either was to the
polluted population. This provides a control for each
Superfund site by identifying which loci are significant
outliers relative to two reference sites that are demographically distant from each other. To provide extensive coverage of the genome, we used approximately 300 amplified
fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) [62] to genotype
288 individuals from nine F. heteroclitus populations and
used a modeling approach to reveal significant outliers.
Furthermore, we investigated whether outlier loci were
shared among polluted populations, suggesting similar
patterns of selection on the genome despite differences in
pollutant compositions and local conditions.

Methods
F. heteroclitus were collected using minnow traps during
the spring of 2005. Fin clip samples from 32 individuals
were sampled from each of the nine collection sites along
the east coast of the United States (Fig. 1; Table 1). Three
of the collection sites were Superfund sites: New Bedford
(EPA ID: MAD980731335), Newark (EPA ID:
NJD980528996), and Elizabeth River (EPA ID:
VAD990710410). Two non-polluted reference sites
flanked each Superfund site, approximately equidistant
on either side of each polluted site (Fig. 1; Table 1).

EcoRI (New England Biolabs, MA) and 5 U MseI (New
England Biolabs, MA) overnight at 37Â°C in a total volume
of 45 Î¼L containing 1Ã T4 DNA ligase buffer (Epicentre)
supplemented with 100 Î¼g/mL BSA. Following incubation, 50 pmol adaptor oligonucleotides (Applied Biosystems) and 1 U T4 DNA ligase (Epicentre) were added and
incubated overnight at 16Â°C. Preselective PCRs were performed in a 15 Î¼L volume using 5 Î¼L of diluted (1:10)
ligation product with EcoRI + (C/A) primer (Integrated
DNA Technologies; 10 pmol), MseI + (C/A) primer (Integrated DNA Technologies; 10 pmol) and 1 U Taq. PCR
conditions were 20 cycles of 94Â°C for 10 sec, 56Â° for 30
sec, and 72Â°C for 2 min. Selective Eco + 3NT primers
(Integrated DNA Technologies; 10 pmol) labeled with
FAM dye at the 5' end and MseI + 3NT primers (Integrated
DNA Technologies; 10 pmol) were added to diluted
(1:10) pre-selective PCR product in a 15 Î¼L volume. PCR
conditions in the first cycle were 94Â°C for 10 sec, 65Â°C for
30 sec, and 72Â°C for 2 min with the annealing temperature reduced by 0.4Â°C for 12 cycles, then 30 cycles of
94Â°C for 10 sec, 56Â°C for 30 sec, and 72Â°C for 2 min.
Semi-automated analysis of the selective PCR products
was performed on MegaBACE 1000 DNA sequencing system (GE Healthcare). Peak patterns were calculated using
MegaBACE Geneprofiler software v. 1.0 (GE Healthcare).
The criteria for distinct peaks were a size between 50 and
400 base pairs and an absolute intensity greater than or
equal to 1000. Replicated fragments were obtained from
all samples (the same template was used for independent
PCRs) and replicate fragments were scored as being
present or absent using Peakmatcher software [64]. Peakmatcher software automatically creates marker categories
and generates a binary table for the presence and absence
of markers based on the minimum 75 percent repeatability of markers across replicates.

and heterozygotes are not observed, Hardy-Weinberg

not be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Though not
directly comparable, microsatellites are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in these F. heteroclitus populations [66].

using the Island model and an infinite alleles mutational
model. Samples of the same size and number as the data
are simulated, where each sample is taken from a different
island. This simulation uses two populations of size N
diploid individuals, with a set mutation rate, Î¼, and a
migration rate, m, per generation. Parameters for the simulation are estimated through the calculation FST = 1/(1 +
16Nm + 16NÎ¼). The FST value is found by calculating the
mean FST from any given pairwise comparison and adjusting that value by -0.0093 to account for the upward bias
in the model reported by Wilding et al. [69]; this bias is
consistent with previous simulations using Nei's methods
to calculate pairwise FST values [70]. The Nm factor is calculated by solving for that parameter in the above equation. Each simulation used 103 and 10-4 as estimates of N
and Î¼, respectively. Simulated FST values are relatively
unaffected by changing either the sample size of the simulated population or the mutation rate [20]. Five simulations were run on each pairwise comparison to generate
an expected null distribution of 25,000 values. Each simulation started with 500 simulation bi-allelic loci in each
of the two populations with uniform random distribution
and was allowed to drift for 10N generations. The 99th
percentile of FST values within each of the 40 binned mean
allele frequency values (each bin representing a set of
0.025 frequency values from 0 to 1) was calculated after
removing monomorphic loci because FST is strongly
dependent on allele frequencies [20].
The model we used [20] is robust to a wide range of alternative models such as colonization and stepping-stone
[5]. It is likely to detect outliers with unusually high FST
values and will identify adaptive selection at one or many
loci through pairwise comparisons of populations [5,11].
This model is not able to identify loci under balancing
selection and tends to generate discrepancies when numbers of immigrants per generation are unequal, the true
population history consists of repeated branching events,
or the connectivity of populations is uneven [5]. Isolation,
population bottlenecks, and populations which are heterogeneous with respect to their demographic parameters
further bias to the model [20]. There is no evidence for
isolation and bottleneck history [66] or reduced genetic
diversity [71] in our populations. However, if nonhomogenous demographic parameters exist (e.g., skewed
age structure or sex ratios), this model may be biased.
Given the relative robustness of the model to identify loci
under adaptive selection, we used theoretical versus experimentally derived allele frequencies for loci to determine
significant deviations from the neutral expectation.

Results
Total number of loci among populations
Five different primer combinations (Table 2) were used to
amplify approximately 300 loci from 288 individuals

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/282

from nine different F. heteroclitus populations. Among
New Bedford Harbor and its reference sites, Sandwich and
Point Judith, a total of 296 loci were scored. Of those 296
loci, 11 bands were found to be monomorphic (3.7%).
Newark and its two reference sites, Tuckerton and Clinton, had a total of 336 loci, of which 7 loci were monomorphic (2.1%). Elizabeth River and its two reference
sites, Magotha and Manteo, had a total of 299 loci, with 4
loci found to be monomorphic (1.3%). Among all populations, 450 distinct loci were scored.
Outlier loci among populations
In comparisons of the three Superfund sites and their
clean reference sites, twenty-four loci show patterns indicative of selection. The criteria for identifying these selective loci are that they were identified as outliers in
pairwise comparisons of each Superfund site population
relative to its two reference site populations (polluted versus both references, analyzed separately, i.e. the union of
polluted versus reference 1 and polluted versus reference 2)
but not in comparisons between the reference site populations. Eighteen of these twenty-four loci were found in
the New Bedford Harbor comparisons, four were found in
the Newark Bay comparisons, and six were found in the
Elizabeth River comparisons (Fig. 3). Four of these loci
were shared between two Superfund site populations suggesting conserved mechanisms of adaptation (Fig. 4).

In the northern most Superfund site, New Bedford Harbor, 42 loci representing 14% of total analyzed loci were

located above the simulated 0.99 quantile in the polluted
versus one of the references' comparisons. That is, these 42
loci have FST values that lie outside the expected neutral
distribution of 99% of all loci. This is more than 10 fold
greater than the 3 that are expected by chance from the
approximately 300 amplified loci. These 42 loci are outliers in the New Bedford Harbor comparison to the Point
Judith, RI reference population (36 loci), the Sandwich,
MA reference population (23 loci) or relative to both reference sites (18 loci). The 18 outlier loci found in the
comparisons of New Bedford Harbor to both of its reference populations were amplified from three different
primer combinations, spanning a 100 base pair range
(Fig. 3A). The joint probability (<0.01 squared or
<0.0001) indicates that less than one locus should be different in both clean sites versus the Superfund site. These
18 loci are thus implicated as separate loci under selection
or linked to areas of the genome under selection. There are
16 loci that are outliers when comparing the two reference
populations to each other. Only one of these 16 outlier
loci is specific to the clean reference sites; the other 15 are
also found in the comparison to the New Bedford Harbor

was an outlier in all pairwise comparisons.
Newark Bay, NJ is close to the phylogeographic boundary
that separates northern and southern populations of F.
heteroclitus [66,72]. The Clinton reference population is
on the northern side and the Tuckerton reference population is on the southern side. The Newark Bay Superfund
site has 26 outlier loci (8% versus 1% expected) relative to
these two reference sites: 18 (5%) in the comparison with
the Clinton reference population and 13 (4%) in the comparison with the Tuckerton reference site population.
Four outlier loci are found in both comparisons between
the Newark Bay Superfund site and its two clean reference
sites (Fig. 3B) and not among clean sites. These four loci
are greater than that predicted from the joint probability
of differences in both clean sites versus the Superfund site.
In pairwise comparisons of the two clean reference sites,
18 loci are outliers. Ten of these 18 loci are common outliers between a northern and two different southern populations i.e., Clinton and Newark Bay populations and
Clinton and Tuckerton populations.
Elizabeth River is the most southern Superfund site. The
Elizabeth River population, in comparisons to its two reference site populations, had 9 outlier loci (3%). The Elizabeth River and Magotha reference site comparison had 8
outlier loci (2.7% of the total loci) whereas the Elizabeth

River and Manteo reference site comparison had 7 (2.4%
of the total loci). Six outlier loci were found in both comparisons (Fig. 3C) and not found in the comparison
among clean sites. Among the two reference sites
(Magotha and Manteo) only three loci were outliers and
none of these were unique to the reference-reference comparison. Two loci were in common with outliers from the
Elizabeth River-Magotha comparison and one locus was
in common with the Elizabeth River-Manteo comparison.
Among the twenty-three loci that were outliers in comparisons only among Superfund sites and both reference
sites, four loci are outliers in two of the three Superfund
sites (Fig. 4; Table 3). Two of these four outlier loci are
shared between New Bedford Harbor and Elizabeth River
populations, and two are shared between Newark Bay and
Elizabeth River. None is shared between New Bedford and
Newark Bay, nor are any shared among all three Superfund site populations.
FST values were calculated for comparisons between all
sites with and without outlier loci (Table 4). As would be
expected, average FST values were higher in all comparisons before the removal of the outliers. The average FST
value (with outliers) between New Bedford Harbor and its
reference sites is 0.038, between Newark and its reference
sites it is 0.039, and between Elizabeth River and its reference sites it is 0.018. Upon removal of the outliers, average FST values fall to 0.010, 0.016, and 0.011 for New
Bedford Harbor, Newark Bay, and Elizabeth River, respectively. These values were plotted against log-ten of geographic distance between sites versus genetic distance [FST/
(1 - FST), [73]]. There is no apparent pattern in the distribution of pairwise comparisons corresponding to reference-reference, polluted-reference, or polluted-polluted
sites. When outliers were included in the calculation of
average FST and plotted against distance, there was no significant linear relationship (R2 = 0.092, p = .0721). Upon
removal of the outliers, there was a significant and strong
linear relationship (R2 = 0.79, p < 0.0001) between geographic and genetic distance (Fig. 5). Mantel tests that
account for multiple comparisons confirmed the significance of both relationships (data not shown). This relationship indicates that 79% of the variability in the
neutral genetic distance (without outlier loci) between
sites can be explained by geographic distance.

Discussion
Multiple F. heteroclitus populations have independently
evolved adaptive resistance to complex suites of pollutants [45-52,74,75]. These different populations provide
independent contrasts for identifying loci involved in
adaptation. We identified loci suggestive of adaptation for
each polluted population by identifying outlier loci in the
polluted population relative to two nearby reference populations. These loci are outliers because they are statistically different from the neutral distribution among
populations. Only loci exhibiting a non-neutral distribution in comparisons of the polluted population versus
both a north and south reference population were considered to be adaptive. Through this comparison, we are
more likely to identify loci whose non-neutral distribution is due to pollution rather than geography. Similarly,
while the model used to identify outlier loci has a false
positive rate of approximately 7% [11], it is unlikely that
the same loci will be falsely identified in multiple comparisons (i.e., in the polluted population versus both a north
and south reference populations). In each of the Superfund sites, 1% to 6% (four to 18 loci out of approximately
300) of amplified fragments were identified as being loci
under selection or linked to areas of the genome under
selection. Four of these loci were outliers in two separate
Superfund population comparisons.
We only consider loci exhibiting a non-neutral distribution in comparisons of the polluted population versus
both a north and south reference population to be adaptive. These populations make up a geographic triangle
formed among the northern and southern clean reference
populations and a latitudinally intermediate polluted
population (Fig. 1). This double comparison ensures that
we are not identifying loci that differ simply due to genetic
drift or clinal variation common to this species. This contrast, in addition to the joint comparison among populations, address most of the possible neutral or
demographic models. Population isolation can alter allele
frequencies among populations. One would expect that a
single population that suffered from unique isolation
would have significantly greater FST values among many
loci in comparison to similarly geographically distance
populations that were not uniquely isolated. This demographic explanation does not fit the data for two reasons:
1) it is the statistically different FST value for a few loci in

Mean FST between populations of Fundulus heteroclitus with and without outlier loci. Below diagonal: mean FST including outlier loci. Above diagonal:

comparison to all other loci that we define as being
important, and 2) all non-outlier loci follow the more
common demographic trend of isolation by distance (Fig.
5). However, differences in FST values also can result if loci
under functional constraints evolve more slowly than loci
without functional constraints. Thus, loci with large FST
values would have few, if any constraints, relative to the
hundreds of other AFLP loci. However, our comparisons
were based on both a significant FST between both reference sites versus a polluted site and insignificant differences among reference sites (as well as a difference from
the permutation model, see methods). Because we are
using three criteria (significant difference versus the joint
distribution in two reference sites, lack of a difference
among reference sites, and a statistical difference from a
neutral permutation model), it seems most parsimonious
to suggest that these outlier loci are due to natural selection. However, lack of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or
recent mutations also might cause loci to be outliers. We
suggest that the most obvious cause for this evolved difference is chronic exposure to the aromatic hydrocarbons
and other anthropogenic pollutants; yet, we cannot
explicitly control every variable in natural environments.
Other selective forces also could be different between the
three sites. For instance, site complexity differs among the
nine sites with the three polluted sites tending to be less
complex (have less edges) than the reference sites. Thus,
predation or food availability might differ among sites.
Similarly, salinity might affect food availability or absorption, and although all populations inhabit brackish
waters, the Elizabeth River population is less coastal than
the reference populations to which it is compared. Under

controlled laboratory conditions, survival differs among
fish from clean populations exposed to polluted sediments and fish from polluted populations exposed to
clean sediments. This phenomenon points towards adaptation to anthropogenic contaminants rather than differing local conditions for the differences seen between
polluted and reference populations. Thus we postulate
that outlier loci are due to pollution, especially those loci
shared among separate Superfund populations.
Most of the outlier loci are unique to a single polluted
population rather than shared across polluted populations (Fig. 4). One explanation for the lack of shared loci
is that different loci are involved in the adaptation to a
particular pollutant or stress. Alternatively, some of these
outliers might be linked to the same locus in the different
populations and only appear to be different because the
locus under selection dragged different polymorphisms to
fixation. This could occur because different polymorphisms existed in the different ancestral populations.
Resistance to pollution is a modern phenotype in F. heteroclitus due to recent exposure (approximately within the
last 60 years), suggesting that F. heteroclitus have rapid
evolutionary responses with respect to their environment.
Our data and other data on survival and development
indicate that populations of Fundulus have adapted to
local pollutants and thus selection has favored a few alleles. Resistance phenotypes resulting from rapid evolution
have been well documented in plants [76] and benthic
invertebrates [77] in response to metals as well as in
insects in response to pesticides [78] and depend both on

population dynamics as well as the strength of selection.
F. heteroclitus populations residing in chronically polluted
areas provide an advantageous situation whereby strong
selective pressures and rapid evolution can be studied. F.
heteroclitus have high standing genetic variation [79], high
reproductive potential [80], limited home ranges [81] and
large population sizes exceeding 10,000 in a single tidal
creek [66]. These attributes can and have resulted in
locally adapted F. heteroclitus populations. Adaptation due
to positive selection often reduces genetic variation
among natural populations because of selective sweeps.
For example, reduced genetic variation has occurred in
brown rats resistant to the rodenticide, warfarin
[25,82,83], tobacco budworm exposed to the pyrethroid
insecticide [84], and the human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, exposed to antimalarial agents [85].
However, genetic diversity is not reduced in the polluted
F. heteroclitus populations compared to the reference site
populations for either neutral markers [71,86,87] or gene
expression [88]. Maintenance of genetic diversity in these
populations subjected to significant selection most likely
represents steady influx of alternative alleles by migration.
If migration and resulting gene flow is strong enough to

prevent the reduction of genetic diversity at non-selected
loci, it suggests that selection at adaptively important loci
is equally strong. Importantly, with constant influx of
allelic variation at loci without adaptive value, there
should be fewer spurious allelic differences among populations. Thus, shared loci between Superfund populations
are likely to be affected by selection and therefore biologically important.
Among three F. heteroclitus populations inhabiting highly
polluted Superfund sites and flanking reference populations, 63 different loci (14% of the collective 450 loci)
have FST values outside the 99% quantile. Using all loci
(i.e., including outliers) our FST values based on AFLP
(0.038, 0.039, and 0.018 for New Bedford Harbor,
Newark Bay and Elizabeth River, respectively) are approximately one-half of those found for microsatellites (0.077,
0.068, and 0.043, respectively [66]) although these
genetic measures are difficult to compare due to differences in genomic coverage and mutation rates [89]. Using
AFLPs, McMillan et al. [71] found similar FST values for the
New Bedford Harbor population (0.056). For the Elizabeth River population, Mulvey et al. [86] also found similar FST values (0.014) using allozymes. Notice that these
calculated FST values use all loci and do not distinguish
between neutral and non-neutral loci. If selection affects
the frequency of alleles among these molecular markers,
the perceived genetic distance (FST) will be exaggerated.
The neutral hypothesis is a powerful tool to explore differences among populations [90]. However, in order to test
evolutionary hypotheses, one needs to distinguish
between neutral and non-neutral loci. Among populations for each Superfund site, the genetic distances among
local populations are affected by the outlier loci. New
Bedford Harbor and Newark Bay populations are more
differentiated in comparison to their reference site populations than the Elizabeth River populations (FST values of
0.038 and 0.039 versus 0.018) because the Elizabeth River
population has the fewest outlier loci (2.4% â 2.7%) in
comparison to neutral loci. These differences among
Superfund sites do not exist upon removal of outliers: FST
values among loci without outlier values are similar for
New Bedford Harbor, Newark Bay and Elizabeth River
(0.01, 0.016, and 0.011, respectively). With outliers, there
is no relationship between FST values and geographic distance. However, upon removal of outlier loci, there is a
strong relationship between genetic and geographical distance indicating an equilibrium model of isolation-bydistance. Similar findings have been shown in other F. heteroclitus studies [66,87], with the intertidal snail [69], and
sea trout [91]. Not surprisingly, these data indicate that
loci with unusually large FST values have a large and potentially misleading effect on the perceived genetic distance
among populations. The 63 outliers exhibit this effect;

once removed from the data set, the neutral expectation of
increasing genetic distance with geographic distance holds
true. For twenty-four of these outlier loci, this non-neutral
distribution is most likely caused by evolution by natural
selection due to pollution or another strong selective force
unique to the polluted sites since the geographical effect
was taken into account through the comparison of the
polluted sites with both a north and south reference population. Ten other loci have a larger than expected distance at the north-south phylogenetic boundary and likely
reflect the historic split among northern and southern F.
heteroclitus populations [92-94]. Outlier loci in referencereference pairwise comparisons likely reflect genetic drift
although some may be due to selection. While we can
only speculate why these and the remaining 29 loci affect
the relationship between genetic and geographic distance,
this illustrates the need to distinguish among potentially
selected and neutral loci to determine expected differences
and posit hypotheses.

Conclusion
Contrasting populations that experience different selective pressures provides insight into evolution by natural
selection. Our goal is to understand the genetic basis of
adaptive resistance to pollution in chronically contaminated natural populations. Future analyses will address
whether polymorphisms between populations are functional and potentially responsible for conferring resistance in populations adapted to chronic exposure to
chemical pollutants in the different Superfund sites. We
have shown that between 1 to 6% of loci are implicated as
being under selection or linked to areas of the genome
under selection in three distinct F. heteroclitus populations
that reside in polluted Superfund estuaries. Shared loci
affected by natural selection among polluted sites indicate
that there may be a similar mechanism of resistance in
these different populations. This study suggests that multiple loci may be involved in adaptation and a few of these
loci have a generalized adaptive response.
