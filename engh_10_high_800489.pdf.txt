Abstract
Background: The mating type loci that govern the mating process in fungi are thought to be influenced by negative
frequency-dependent selection due to rare allele advantage. In this study we used a mating type linked DNA marker as
a proxy to indirectly study the allelic richness and geographic distribution of mating types of one mating type locus
(MAT A) in worldwide populations of the dry rot fungus Serpula lacrymans. This fungus, which causes serious
destruction to wooden constructions in temperate regions worldwide, has recently expanded its geographic range
with a concomitant genetic bottleneck.
Results: High allelic richness and molecular variation was detected in the mating type linked marker as compared to
other presumably neutral markers. Comparable amounts of genetic variation appeared in the mating type linked
marker in populations from nature and buildings, which contrast the pattern observed with neutral genetic markers
where natural populations were far more variable. Some geographic structuring of the allelic variation in the mating
type linked marker appeared, but far less than that observed with neutral markers. In founder populations of S.
lacrymans, alleles co-occurring in heterokaryotic individuals were more divergent than expected by chance, which
agrees with the expectation for populations where few mating alleles exists. The analyzed DNA marker displays transspecies polymorphism wherein some alleles from the closely related species S. himantoides are more similar to those of
S. lacrymans than other alleles from S. himantoides.
Conclusions: Our results support the idea that strong negative frequency-dependent selection maintains high levels
of genetic variation in MAT-linked genomic regions, even in recently bottlenecked populations of S. lacrymans.
Background
A high allelic richness is maintained in some genetic loci
due to negative frequency-dependent selection caused by
rare allele advantage, which counteracts the effect of
genetic drift (reviewed by Richman 2000). The MHC
(Major Histocompatibility Complex) system of animals
and the SI (self incompatibility) system in plants are wellknown examples [1]. The mating type (MAT) loci of
fungi, which governs the mating process, are also thought
to be influenced by negative frequency-dependent selection because haploid mycelia possessing rare MAT alleles
have higher chances for mating compared to those possessing frequent alleles [2,3].

Different types of mating systems occur in the fungal
kingdom. Most basidiomycetes have a tetrapolar mating
system where two separate gene complexes, MAT A and
MAT B, govern the mating process. MAT A encodes
homeodomain transcription factors, MAT-B encodes
pheromones and pheromone receptors, and together
they control mate recognition, clamp connection formation and pairing of nuclei in the formation of dikaryotic
mycelium [4]. For mating to occur in tetrapolar species,
different allelic versions must be present at both mating
type loci. In homobasidiomycetes (i.e. basidiomycetes
with a non-divided basidium), multiple alleles exist in the
mating type loci and negative frequency-dependent
selection can promote maintenance of a high richness of
MAT alleles in populations of these fungi [5,6]. This rare
allele advantage may also lead to 'trans-specific polymorphisms' because of extended coalescence times between

alleles [7]. By classical mating studies it has been shown
that a large number of MAT alleles are present in some
taxa. In Schizophyllum commune, it has been estimated
that around 160 A mating types exist in nature [5], while
in Coprinopsis cinerea, the number of A mating type
alleles was estimated to be 100 [8]. Although this high
allelic diversity suggests that MAT would be an excellent
target for the development of population genetic markers, MAT alleles have so far not been used in population
genetics studies of Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota). This
is likely due to the fact that MAT alleles themselves are
highly divergent in sequence, making it difficult to design
universal primers.
It has been demonstrated that a conserved gene order
(shared synteny) exists between the mating type genes
and neighbouring genes in most Agaricomycetes [9]. One
such locus is the gene encoding mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (mip), located close to the MAT A locus
(less than 1 kb for S. commune, Coprinopsis cinerea and
C. scobicola) in Agaricomycetes investigated [10,11].
Because of physical linkage, we may expect that this gene
is indirectly affected by negative frequency-dependent
selection acting on MAT, and therefore that high allelic
richness will be maintained also in the mip region due to
linkage disequilibrium. Accordingly, instead of targeting
the mating types directly, which poses technical difficulties due to massive molecular divergence, targeting
neighbouring 'non-mating type MAT-linked genes', such
as mip, may yield proxies for analysing the allelic richness
of mating types [9] and a source for highly variable markers.
In this study we analyse a genetic marker covering a
portion of the mip gene, a neighbouring spacer region
and the 3'-prime end of the mating type gene, homeodomain 1 (HD1), as a proxy to analyse the richness of mating types (MAT A) within the dry rot fungus Serpula
lacrymans (Boletales, Basidiomycota). Serpula lacrymans
is the most damaging destroyer of wood constructions in
temperate regions. By using various presumably neutral
genetic markers, we have previously shown that the dry
rot fungus is divided into two main lineages that probably
represent different species; one non-aggressive residing
naturally in North America and Asia (var. shastensis), and
another aggressive lineage appearing on all continents
(var. lacrymans) [12]. Genetic analyses pinpoint mainland Asia as the origin of the aggressive form var. lacrymans, from where it has migrated worldwide to Europe,
North- and South America and Oceania followed by local
population expansions [12]. This recently spread lineage
of var. lacrymans, probably spread by man in historic
time, is known as 'the Cosmopolitan group' [12]. Little
genetic variation occurs in the bottlenecked founder populations of var. lacrymans worldwide, while more genetic
variation is found in the source population in mainland

Asia, as well as in var. shastensis [12,13]. In accordance
with this inferred massive recent expansion from a much
smaller founder population, only a few (6) vegetative
compatibility types (VC-types) have been detected in the
European genetically depleted population of var. lacrymans [14]. Vegetative compatibility is a self-nonself recognition system used to separate own mycelium from
other mycelia. Normally, one VC-type corresponds to
one genet, but in genetically depleted populations, like in
S. lacrymans, different genets can belong to the same VCtype. Higher genetic variation and a correspondingly
higher number of VC-types have been detected in the
Japanese indoor population, which probably was founded
during an independent founder event from the Asian
source population [13]. The morphospecies Serpula himantioides, which is used as outgroup in our analyses, is
the sister taxon to S. lacrymans and includes several subgroups that probably represent independent ('cryptic')
species [12].
The aims of the present study are to use a non-mating
type MAT-linked marker as a proxy to indirectly study
the allelic richness of mating type A in a worldwide sample of the genetically deprived S. lacrymans, and to investigate whether the level of molecular variation at the
MAT-linked loci is consistent with negative frequencydependent selection. Furthermore, we analyse the allelic
richness in a geographic context and investigate whether
more variation occurs in natural, outdoor populations of
var. shastensis and var. lacrymans compared to the
founder populations of var. lacrymans that strictly
appears in buildings. Finally, we evaluate whether the
mating type linked marker can be used to separate closely
related isolates of var. lacrymans.

Methods
Material

A total of 83 cultures and dried specimens of S. lacrymans and S. himantioides were included in this study (see
additional file 1: Information about the analyzed material). DNA was extracted following a 2% CTAB (cetyl
trimethylammonium bromide) miniprep method
described by [15] with minor modifications: DNA was
resuspended in 100 μL distilled sterile H2O at the final
step of extraction.
PCR

We first tested the primers MIP1F and MIP1R [16] on
different Serpula strains. This primer set has successfully
been used to amplify a part of the non-mating type MATlinked mip gene in various other fungi [16]. Positive
amplicons were obtained from a few isolates only (probably due to primer mismatch). Based on an alignment
including partial mip sequences from three Boletales species [16], as well as three Serpula sequences obtained

using the MIP1 primer set, we designed the new primers
mip60F (GGMAAYCAYCACGAAGAYCC) and mip190F
(TTCAGCCATCTATTYGGGTACGG). In order to maximize sequence length we employed an uneven PCR
approach as described in [17], combining the primers
mip60F and mip190F and twelve different RAPD primers
[17]. Positive amplicons from different primer combinations were sequenced, and finally the new primers
mip55R (GCGGACAAACAAGCAAAGTT) and mip82R
(CTGAAGATGCTGGAGGAAGC) were designed based
on the resulting alignments and further combined with
mip60F and mip190F to amplify the partial mip region
from all included isolates and specimens (Table 1). PCR
amplification with primers mip60F or mip190F in combi-

nation with primers mip55R or mip82R was performed
with the proofreading enzyme Dynazyme EXT DNA
Polymerase (Finnzymes) with reactions containing 16.5
μl of 100× diluted template DNA, 1.5 μl each of forward
and reverse primers (5 μM stocks), 2.5 μl of dNTPs (2 μM
stock), 2.5 μl of Dynazyme EXT 10× reaction buffer, 0.5 μl
Dynazyme EXT DNA Polymerase (25 μl total reaction
volume). PCR reactions with Dynazyme EXT were performed with the following protocol: 2 min at 94°C; followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 45 s at 54°C, and 1 min
at 72°C; followed by a 7 min extension at 72°C and an
indefinite hold at 4°C. Based on the two genome
sequences of Serpula lacrymans S7.3 and S7.9 (U.S. Government Department of Energy - Joint Genome Insitute)

a new primer (Mip_ins3R; ACTCCGCTGAAGTCCACCTGC) was designed in an insert occurring in some
allelic versions of the mating type linked marker.
Mip_ins3R was combined with mip190F to reveal the
presence of this insert (see below) using the same PCR
conditions as above. We sequenced nine amplicons
directly to assess the homology of the insert.
Cloning and sequencing

We used a cloning procedure to separate different mip
alleles co-amplified from the heterokaryotic isolates and
specimens. Fragments were cloned with the TOPO TA
Cloning kit (Invitrogen) using blue/white screening
according to the manufacturer's manual. Positive colonies
were subjected to direct PCR with the M13R/T7 primers
with the same PCR conditions as described above. The
resulting amplicons were sequenced using an ABI 3730
DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). We
aligned the cloned sequences from each isolate/specimen
manually in separate alignments using BioEdit 7 [18]
(from three to twenty, see additional file 1: Information
about the analyzed material), and two divergent alleles
(when present) were separated. It is well known that artificial mutations and chimeric sequences can be obtained
when using a clone-based approach. When more than
two copies of each allele were present in the alignment,
we considered polymorphisms occurring only within one
single sequence (being 'autapomorphic') as mutations
generated in vitro during PCR and discarded these. When
only two copies of each allele were present we assumed
heterozygosity at the sites in which the two copies differed. When only one allelic copy was present this version
was accepted as is. Sequences from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nrDNA region and parts of the beta
tubulin (tub) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) genes have previously been obtained from
the isolates/specimens as specified in [12]. These
sequences were used as comparisons with the mipsequences analysed here. All sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers given in
additional file 1: Information about the analyzed material.
Phylogenetic and statistical analyses

We established sequence alignments for the mating type
linked marker mip, as well as ITS, gpd and tub and ran
phylogenetic analyses on the two first datasets. 'Best-fit'
evolutionary models were estimated for all analyses using
the Akaike information criterion (AIC) as implemented
in MrModeltest 2.3 [19]. The SYM+I+G model was specified as prior for the MAT linked data set while the
HKY+I model for the ITS data set. Posterior probabilities
were determined by MrBayes [20,21] twice by running
one cold and four heated chains for 10 × 106 generations
in parallel mode, saving trees every 1000th generation. A

Page 4 of 9

50% majority rule consensus tree was used to calculate
posterior probabilities including the proportion of trees
gathered after the convergence of likelihood scores was
reached. We run parsimony analyses using TNT [22],
where Jackknife support values [23] were obtained using
1000 replicates. Jackknife support values above 50 were
superimposed on the consensus tree from MrBayes.
Due to the dikaryotic stage of the isolates/specimens,
heterozygous sites (with two nucleotides in same position) appeared in many of the gpd, ITS and tub
sequences. In order to use the information in the
heterozygous sequence sites and calculate more accurate
estimates of molecular variation for these regions, haplotype datasets were constructed for the different DNA
regions. For example, in a DNA sequence ('genotype')
containing an 'Y' (=C/T) the two resulting sequence haplotypes will include either a 'C' or a 'T'. In sequences with
more than one heterozygous site, the heterozygous phase
was inferred using a procedure yielding the minimum
number of alleles. In short, sequences homozygous at all
sites or heterozygous at only one site (known putative
haplotypes) are used as templates for inferring phase of
sequences with multiple heterozygous sites. Hence,
sequences with two or more heterozygous sites are,
whenever possible, assigned to known putative haplotypes found in the sample of sequences. Alternatively,
haplotypes requiring a minimum number of mutational
steps are inferred. The procedure may underestimate the
number of haplotypes if recombinant genotypes occur.
Notably, descriptive statistics of level of polymorphism
(such as π and k), as well as tests of neutrality (Tajima's D
and Fu & Li's F and D tests) will not be affected since
these statistics are based on polymorphic sites per se and
not haplotypes. In ITS no more than one heterozygous
site appeared per sequence. Nucleotide diversity π (average number of nucleotide differences per site), k (average
number of nucleotide differences per sequence per site)
and estimates of the population mutation parameter
theta θ were calculated for each of the four sequenced
loci using the program DnaSP version 4.50.2 [24]. To test
for deviation from neutral evolution, we performed Fu
and Li's D, Fu and Li's F and Tajima's D tests using DnaSP.
The HKA test [25] was performed with the program
HKA for all four loci (published by Jody Hey; http://
lifesci.rutgers.edu/~heylab/ProgramsandData/Programs/
HKA/HKA_Documentation.htm) with 1000 simulations.
To test whether the two alleles co-amplified from a single individual were more divergent than expected by
chance, we calculated pairwise similarities of all alleles
using Bioedit. This matrix was then used to calculate the
mean similarity of alleles occurring within individuals,
which was compared to the mean similarity of alleles
across individuals, by a two-sample unequal variance t
test using the software R [26]. This test was done inde-

pendently for different groups of isolates; all isolates of S.
lacrymans var. lacrymans, the cosmopolitan (Europe +
North America + Oceania) group of var. lacrymans,
European isolates of var. lacrymans, Japanese isolates of
var. lacrymans, and all isolates of S. lacrymans var. shastensis.

Results and discussion
The MAT-linked marker

The sequences we obtained from the MAT-linked marker
ranged from 718 to 810 bp. In the sequence alignment
(860 bp), the first 285 positions constituted the 3' end of
the mip gene, positions 286-832 a spacer region, and 833860 the 3' end of the HD1 gene of MAT A. A total of 126
sequences of the MAT-linked marker were obtained from
the 83 analysed dikaryotic isolates/specimens. In a
dikaryotic basidiomycete it is expected that two different
MAT A alleles occur in each isolate/specimen, but we
obtained two alleles from only 53% of the analysed
dikaryons. This could be due to (i) failure to detect both
alleles due to limited number of cloned fragments (6-20)
from each isolate, (ii) primer mismatch (or other reasons
for PCR amplification failure), or (iii) that different MAT
alleles share the same mating type linked marker (e.g. due
to recombination and/or that the linked marker is more
conserved than the adjacent MAT alleles). Notably, a
comparison of the recently analysed genome sequences
of Serpula lacrymans var. lacrymans (i.e. the two
sequenced homokaryons S7.3 and S7.9, obtained from
the same spore family), revealed that a large insertion
(~18 kbp) occurred between mip and the mating type
locus in one of the genomes (S7.9). Thus, a plausible
explanation for why only one allele was amplified in a
large proportion of the isolates is that this insertion
occurs in many of the analysed isolates. Indeed, PCR
amplification with one primer located within and one
outside the insert gave positive amplicons from isolates
where only one allele originally was obtained. Surprisingly, from two of the isolates we obtained three and four
different alleles (see below).
Molecular and allelic variation

We found higher molecular variation in the mating type
linked marker compared to the other sequenced loci
(Table 1). Fig. 1 shows higher allelic variation in the mating type linked marker than in the ITS region. In the phylogenetic tree obtained from the mating type linked
marker, the samples of var. lacrymans from Europe,
North-America and Oceania (i.e. the 'Cosmopolitan
group' [12], and the Japanese population appeared to a
large extent intermixed on several branches. This is in
contrast to the ITS tree (Fig. 1), as well as trees based on
other analysed markers [12] where the Japanese and Cosmopolitan samples appear in two quite distinct groups.

Page 5 of 9

Furthermore, a comparable amount of genetic variation
appeared in the mating type linked marker in populations
of S. lacrymans from nature and buildings. This is in stark
contrast to the pattern observed using neutral genetic
markers, where natural populations were far more genetically variable than those from buildings (Table 1). The
high level of genetic variation at the mating type linked
marker compared to the presumably neutrally evolving
markers may be explained by negative frequency-dependent selection at the MAT A locus maintaining genetic
variation also in the vicinity of the locus under selection.
In accordance with this hypothesis the results from the
HKA test showed that there was significant deviation
from neutral evolution when we compared the mating
type linked marker with the presumably neutral markers
ITS, tub or gpd. This test was based on intra- and interspecific divergence within and between S. lacrymans var.
shastensis and var. lacrymans. Balancing selection, such
as negative frequency-dependent selection, will often
tend to keep alleles at intermediate frequencies. Accordingly, rare alleles will tend to be underrepresented compared to neutral expectation. Thus neutrality tests, such
as Tajima's D will often yield positive test statistics at such
loci. In contrast, the test statistics of Tajima's D, Fu and
Li's D (Table 1) were negative at the mating type linked
marker in the populations investigated here. In a previous
study we found strong signals for a recent population
expansion in these fungi [12], a demographic process that
usually would affect the test-statistics of these neutrality
tests in the opposite direction compared to balancing
selection. Hence, we suggest that demographic effects
may override the expected signal from balancing selection in this case.
Negative frequency-dependent selection counteracts
the sorting effect of genetic drift, and may maintain a
high level of molecular and allelic variation also in neighbouring linked regions. Previous studies has shown that
tight genetic linkage to loci subjected to strong negative
frequency-dependent selection will maintain high levels
of polymorphism also at otherwise neutrally evolving loci
[27,28]. Thus, we find it likely that the high level of
genetic variation at our mating type linked marker is due
to associated effects of negative frequency-dependent
selection at MAT A, and not because it itself is subject to
negative frequency-dependent selection itself.
Species phylogeny

Although we find high levels of molecular variation at the
mating type linked marker, the alleles largely group in
accordance with known species delimitations [12]. All
alleles obtained from the S. himantioides morphospecies
cluster together (Fig. 1a) and all alleles from var. lacrymans, except a few trans-species polymorphisms (see
below) occur in one group. However, alleles from the var.

shastensis group separate into two different sister groups.
Four trans-specific polymorphisms are observed, indicated by arrows in Fig. 1a. One sequence derived from a
var. shastensis isolate (SHA8-1) clusters within the var.
lacrymans group. On the opposite, one sequence
obtained from a European var. lacrymans isolate (SL189)
clusters within var. shastensis and another sequence
obtained from the same isolate (SL189) clusters within S.
himantioides. Lastly, one North American isolate of var.
lacrymans (SL403) groups within S. himantioides. Notably, from SL189 and SL403, four and three different
alleles were obtained (indicated by stars in Fig. 1a). The
very same isolates are heterozygous at ITS and include
two divergent haplotypes (Fig. 1b), of which one has a
divergent placement according to geographic origin. One
SL189 ITS allele clusters with Asian isolates and SL403
has a unique ITS haplotype. These peculiar observations
can be explained in various ways. Ancient gene duplications events might be maintained in the genome of some
or all isolates. If so, it should be expected that the transspecific alleles cluster as more early diverging lineages in
the respective groups. Alternatively, SL189 and SL403
could represent multiple heterokaryotic hybrids, including more than two karyotypes, which may account for the
high number of alleles and divergent ITS haplotypes. It
has been documented that the mycelia of other basidiomycetes can include more than two different nuclei [29].
However, it seems rather unlikely that the German isolate
SL189 has acquired a copy from var. shastensis that
mainly lives in California. More research is definitively
needed to investigate possible scenarios for these puzzling observations.
Geography

We would expect relatively little correspondence between
geographic and genetic distances in a DNA region linked
to a locus under strong selection [30]. However, some
geographic structure can be observed in Fig. 1a. The
European sequences clustered mainly into three main
groups that might correspond to three MAT A alleles (see
discussion below). Notably, within these three groups the
sequences were either identical or very similar, only
including some autapomorphic mutations. The distribution of European alleles corresponds well with other
results indicating that the European population has
recently expanded [13]. Several strictly Japanese subgroups appeared as well. Notably, the Japanese alleles
were in general more divergent than the European ones.
This also corresponds well with the observation that
higher genetic variation occurs in Japan in microsatellites, AFLPs and four sequenced loci [12,13]. Interestingly, alleles from the Asian mainland population, where
var. lacrymans also has a natural distribution in forests,
were distributed throughout the var. lacrymans part of

the tree. In [12] it was observed that the natural Asian
population included most of the genetic variation
observed in the indoor founder populations, and this
seems also to be the case for the MAT A-linked alleles.
Dikaryons

In cases where two alleles of the mating type linked
marker were amplified from the same dikaryon, these
invariably turned out to be divergent, which is to be
expected due to the linkage to MAT A. We found the two
alleles of dikaryons to be significantly more divergent
than expected by chance in the European population (pvalue = 0.003), in the Cosmopolitan group (p-value =
0.010) and in all samples of var. lacrymans taken together
(p-value = 0.017). However, we found no significant elevation of divergence in the Japanese population when
analysed alone (p-value = 0.905), nor in var. shastensis (pvalue = 0.678). These differences between the populations may be due to different number of mating type
alleles present in the various groups. When a high number of mating types occur in a genetically variable population, which is likely to be the case for the Japanese
population and var. shastensis, most primary mycelia will
be able to form a dikaryon, resembling panmictic conditions. However, in the European population and the Cosmopolitan group as a whole, a limited number of mating
types is likely to occur (see [31]), which means that only a
portion of the primary mycelia will be able to mate. Selection is likely to favour individuals with different mating
types in a genetically bottlenecked population, whereas
random association of mating types is more likely in a
genetically variable population. Alternatively, because
linkage to mating type loci under strong balancing selection can create a scenario in which degeneration of the
linked genes occurs [28], the preponderance of dissimilar
mip alleles within dikaryons of var. lacrymans could be
due to the phenomenon of associative overdominance
due to recessive deleterious alleles at MAT linked loci
[32,33]). This could be reinforced if the number of MAT
alleles in the populations is small and the alleles are maintained in the populations for longer periods [33]. However, S. lacrymans has a free-living haploid stagen and
genetic load due to exposure of recessive mutations
would thus be reduced. Tentatively, therefore, we suggest
that the former hypothesis of different strengths of selection for divergent alleles in populations with different levels of genetic variation seems more plausible than that of
associative overdominance.

Conclusions
In this study we use a mating type linked marker as a
proxy to infer variation of mating types in MAT A in S.
lacrymans. We present evidence consistent with the
MAT A region being influenced by frequency-dependent

selection, favouring rare alleles. Although analysis of a
locus linked to a gene of interest may provide important
information about the target gene, as argued here, one
problem is that mutations at the analysed marker may
muddle correct assignment of alleles at the gene of interest. For instance, we observed three main groups of
sequences in the European population that may correspond to three MAT A alleles, but with some sequence
variation within the groups, possibly caused by novel
mutations at the analysed marker. To reveal the actual
connection between the sequenced alleles and the mating
types segregation analyses of spore families with mating
types known from crossing experiments should be conducted.
