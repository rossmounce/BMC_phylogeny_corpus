Abstract
Background: Various typing methods have been developed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but none
provide the combination of discrimination, reproducibility, portability, and genetic inference that
allows the analysis of all aspects of the epidemiology of this pathogen from a single data set.
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been used successfully to characterize the related
organisms Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria lactamica. Here, the same seven locus Neisseria scheme
was used to characterize a diverse collection of N. gonorrhoeae isolates to investigate whether this
method would allow differentiation among isolates, and to distinguish these three species.
Results: A total of 149 gonococcal isolates were typed and submitted to the Neisseria MLST
database. Although relatively few (27) polymorphisms were detected among the seven MLST loci,
a total of 66 unique allele combinations (sequence types, STs), were observed, a number
comparable to that seen among isolate collections of the more diverse meningococcus. Patterns of
genetic variation were consistent with high levels of recombination generating this diversity. There
was no evidence for geographical structuring among the isolates examined, with isolates collected
in Liverpool, UK, showing levels of diversity similar to a global collection of isolates. There was,
however, evidence that populations of N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae and N. lactamica were distinct,
with little support for frequent genetic recombination among these species, with the sequences
from the gdh locus alone grouping the species into distinct clusters.
Conclusion: The seven loci Neisseria MLST scheme was readily adapted to N. gonorrhoeae isolates,
providing a highly discriminatory typing method. In addition, these data permitted phylogenetic and
population genetic inferences to be made, including direct comparisons with N. meningitidis and N.
lactamica. Examination of these data demonstrated that alleles were rarely shared among the three
species. Analysis of variation at a single locus, gdh, provided a rapid means of identifying misclassified
isolates and determining whether mixed cultures were present.

Background
Gonorrhoea, caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, remains one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases contributing a substantial burden of
morbidity, mortality and infertility worldwide. The disease is treatable and curable, but no vaccine is available.
Consequently the control of this important disease
depends on the identification and treatment of infected
individuals and their contacts in transmission networks.
High-resolution and reproducible typing methods for
clinical isolates of the gonococcus are therefore central to
the control of gonococcal infection. Knowledge of the
gonococcal strains circulating both locally and globally,
and of temporal changes in the prevalence of these strains,
would identify transmission patterns and may assist in
prevention and control of this disease.
Many typing schemes have been developed for N. gonorrhoeae but no single typing scheme has been generally
adopted, and the lack of a single, generally accepted typing method has impeded the sharing of epidemiological
data between laboratories. Auxotyping and serotyping are
often applied to gonococci and these techniques are frequently combined, but they do not always provide sufficient resolution to distinguish between epidemiologically
related and unrelated isolates [1].
Molecular based typing schemes [2-6] provide better discrimination among isolates. One method, multilocus
enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), which indexes variation
in housekeeping genes, has been utilized to characterize
gonococci, and has shown that strains with an AHU(arginine, hypoxanthine and uracil requiring) auxotype
are uniform, despite frequent recombination among
gonococci [7]. AHU- isolates have been linked to disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) [8], which is related to
the penicillin sensitive phenotype usually found among
these isolates [9].
Methods that use nucleotide sequencing, however, [1013], are more portable, have greater definition, and make
data storage in globally accessible databases via the internet easier. One method, based on the nucleotide sequence
fragments from two gonococcal antigen genes under
diversifying immune selection: por and tbpB (N. gonorrhoeae multi antigen sequence typing, NG-MAST) [14,15],
provides a high level of discrimination. However the NGMAST database only includes genotypes, consisting of two
number allelic profiles and the nucleotide sequences, with
no isolate data available.
One established method for the characterization of bacteria is multilocus sequence typing (MLST), a development
of MLEE, and a highly discriminatory system for indexing
the relatedness among isolates based on genetic variation

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/35

present in genes under stabilising selection for conservation of metabolic function [16]. It is employed for the
characterisation of many bacterial species, including the
closely related pathogen Neisseria meningitidis and the
commensal Neisseria lactamica [16-21].
An intriguing feature of gonococcal biology is the very
close relationship of this bacterium to N. meningitidis and
N. lactamica, which also have an obligate association with
humans, but inhabit the mucosal surface of the nasopharynx rather than the urogenital tract. Application of the
same MLST scheme to N. gonorrhoeae, is therefore advantageous as it can be used to analyse genetic relationships
among gonococcal isolates, as well as among the neisseriae [22]. Another advantage of MLST is its ability to discriminate
among
species,
facilitating
species
identification and the detection of mixed bacterial cultures. This paper describes a N. gonorrhoeae typing scheme
that exploits the existing globally accessible Neisseria
MLST database [23,24], which provides publicly available
isolate information as well as nucleotide sequence data.

Results
Diversity among alleles and sequence types
A total of 66 sequence types (STs) were identified among
the 149 gonococcal isolates analysed. The number of alleles at each locus ranged from two at aroE to 10 at gdh
(Table 1). Of the 66 unique STs, 35 STs were represented
by single isolates, 29 STs were represented by two to six
isolates, ST-1579 was represented by 10 isolates and ST1595 was represented by 12 AHU- isolates. Another AHUisolate was identified as ST-5688, which differed from the
ST-1595 AHU- isolates by a single synonymous polymorphism in the gdh allele. There were eight STs among isolates collected from 10 cases of DGI. A larger study would
be necessary to investigate any relationships between
invasive isolates and ST.

The allele sequences for each ST, concatenated in frame,
were used to indicate the polymorphic sites within each
ST, demonstrating the diversity present (Figure 1). Data
for these isolates were submitted to the Neisseria MLST
database [23,24] and were given ST designations and
allele numbers in order of discovery, so that the first gonococcal ST identified in this study was designated ST-1579.
A neighbour-joining tree constructed from the concatenated allele sequences demonstrated the diversity of these
isolates (Figure 2). Bacteria with the same STs were isolated in more than one location and some from more
than one continent, while others demonstrated temporal
persistence (Figure 2, Additional file 1).

Comparisons of N. gonorrhoeae with N. meningitidis
and N. lactamica
The allelic diversity within the 149 gonococcal isolates
was compared with the diversity within 217 carried
meningococci collected in the Czech Republic during
1993 [25] and a subset of 103 N. lactamica isolates collected as part of a longitudinal study of N. lactamica carriage in infants [20] (Table 1). The number of alleles and
the percentage of polymorphic sites per allele were much
greater for N. meningitidis and N. lactamica than for N. gonorrhoeae. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
nucleotide substitutions (dN/dS), calculated as an average
over the entire MLST fragment for each locus was < 1 for
each species, evidence that the loci used in the Neisseria
MLST scheme were not subject to diversifying selection.

The number of gonococcal STs was compared to the
number of STs among the Czech meningococcal carriage
collection, the N. lactamica collection, and the collection
of 107 meningococcal isolates used to develop the first
MLST scheme and chosen to represent the diversity of the
meningococcal population worldwide [16] (Table 2). The
number of STs per 100 isolates among the gonococci (44)
was comparable to the numbers of STs per 100 isolates
among the carried meningococci (41) and the collection
of 107 meningococci (47). The collection of 103 N.
lactamica isolates had the highest number of STs per 100
isolates (67). When the collection of gonococcal isolates
was divided into individual datasets, the dataset of 53
gonococcal isolates collected worldwide revealed 57 STs
per 100 isolates, and the 38 gonococcal isolates collected
in Liverpool between 2000 and 2001 comprised 55 STs
per 100 isolates, demonstrating a greater number of STs
per 100 isolates than in either meningococcal isolate collection.
In each of the collections analysed, many of the isolates
had unique STs, with the percentage of unique STs among

53 gonococcal isolates collected worldwide (38%), comparable to that found among the collection of 107 meningococcal isolates (37%). The same percentage of unique
alleles was found among 38 gonococcal isolates collected
in Liverpool between 2000 and 2001, and the 217 Czech
carried meningococci (29%).
Genetic divergence and gene flow (FST) were calculated
between 58 gonococcal isolates collected in Liverpool
(1981â1989), 38 gonococcal isolates collected in Liverpool between 2000 and 2001, 53 gonococcal isolates collected worldwide, 217 Czech carried meningococci and
103 N. lactamica isolates (Table 3). Fixed differences were
present between species but none among the three groups
of gonococci. More polymorphisms were shared among
the gonococcal groups than among the species, and the
percentage nucleotide sequence divergence was greatest

between species. The N. lactamica nucleotide sequences
were the least similar to the gonococcal nucleotide
sequences (9.46% divergence). The FST value between the
two gonococcal groups was close to zero (0.01, 0.02),
whereas between gonococci and N. lactamica it was 0.79,
and between gonococci and N. meningitidis it was 0.61.
The three gonococcal isolate collections were not significantly different (p > 0.05), with no geographic or temporal structuring evident.
To determine whether a clustering algorithm would delineate the three species, a neighbour-joining tree was constructed with the concatenated nucleotide sequences from
the 149 N. gonorrhoeae, the 103 N. lactamica, and the 217
carried meningococci (Figure 3a). This showed three distinct clusters, corresponding to each of the three species,
supported by bootstrap values of 100%. Bootstrap values
within the clusters were very variable (not shown), suggesting relationships were not well resolved, a finding
consistent with high levels of within species recombination. Similar clustering was shown using split decomposition analysis (Figure 3b) [26], although with this method,
N. gonorrhoeae appeared to form a distinct cluster within
the diversity of the meningococcus. No alleles were common to more than one species when 149 gonococci, 324
meningococci, and 103 N. lactamica isolates were analysed.
The alleles that make up the allelic profile of each ST were
examined individually using neighbour-joining trees
(data only shown for gdh). The tree for the alleles at the
gdh locus resolved the species into three well-supported
groups, producing a tree congruent with that obtained
from the concatenated nucleotide sequences (Figure 4).
The trees drawn from alleles at the other six loci did not
resolve the three species into groups that were congruent
with the concatenated nucleotide sequences, although the
majority of alleles from the same species formed clusters,

with the gonococcal alleles forming single tight groups for
all seven loci.

Discussion
It has been suggested that MLST of the pathogen N. gonorrhoeae would not provide sufficient discrimination
between strains [27], due to the uniformity of its housekeeping genes [28]. The present study has shown that N.
gonorrhoeae can be typed effectively using the same MLST
scheme employed to characterize N. meningitidis [16] and
N. lactamica [20], with a genotypic diversity comparable
to that found among meningococcal isolates [25]. Despite
high levels of horizontal genetic exchange among gonococci [2], MLST is robust because it is based on data from
seven genetic loci distributed around the chromosome
and indexes variation that is subject to stabilising selection. It appears to provide a level of discrimination comparable to the NG-MAST typing scheme [15], although
this has not been formally validated as different datasets
have been used. MLST, however, has the advantage that
isolate information is available alongside genotypic data
in an established, publicly accessible database [23,24].
Unlike schemes that rely on antigen gene variation
[5,15,29], which is subject to diversifying immune selection, MLST data can also be used to examine the evolutionary relationships among strains.
A total of 149 gonococcal isolates were typed by MLST in
the present study. While only 27 polymorphisms were
detected among the seven loci, a total of 66 unique allele
combinations, or STs, were recorded. The low level of
nucleotide diversity among gonococci inevitably results in
a tighter clustering of these isolates in phylogenetic trees
compared to meningococcal and N. lactamica isolates
when concatenated sequences are analysed. However, the
use of allelic profiles demonstrates a comparable level of
discriminatory power to MLST of N. meningitidis and N.
lactamica. The gonococcal STs were well differentiated
with some showing temporal and geographic persistence.

evident either, as the isolates collected in Liverpool
between 1981â1989 were not significantly different from
those collected in the same location between 2000 and
2001 (p > 0.05). While there was no evidence of geographical or temporal structuring in the gonococcal populations, UK isolates predominated in this study and some
were from undefined locations, which may have influenced the outcome of the analysis. Structuring may be evident if more geographically and temporally diverse isolate
collections were examined by MLST.
MLST provides a useful tool to study both the local and
global distribution of isolates such as those with the AHUphenotype, making it possible to track particular variants
and examine transmission patterns. Of the 13 AHUgonococci in the present study, 12 had identical genotypes with one differing by a single synonymous mutation
at one locus. This illustrates the close relationship of this
group and the ability of MLST to differentiate isolates with
this auxotype. Further validation of the method would be
required before MLST was used to resolve questions
related to an outbreak situation and it may be necessary to
complement it with antigen gene sequencing, as used in
meningococcal epidemiology [30].

For instance, isolates with ST-1596 and ST-1583 were first
isolated in Liverpool during the 1980s and have since
been isolated in 2000, suggesting they may have a fitness
advantage that has enabled them to persist in the population for over a decade. A total of 31 STs were represented
by more than one isolate, with one group, ST-1579 represented by 10 isolates from three different countries, suggesting that isolates were distributed widely and not
structured geographically. No temporal structuring was

As the gonococcal MLST scheme uses nucleotide sequence
data from exactly the same gene fragments as the meningococcal scheme, it can be used to compare MLST data
from different Neisseria species, allowing phylogenetic
and population genetic inferences to be made. The gonococcal MLST data were compared to data from studies of
N. meningitidis and N. lactamica isolate collections previously published by the authors [16,20,25]. The use of
these data, as opposed to the entire Neisseria MLST database was preferred as they had been extensively characterized and their provenance could be confirmed.
Like the N. lactamica and N. meningitidis alleles, the dN/dS
ratios of the gonococcal alleles suggest that these loci
evolve slowly and are not affected by diversifying selection, making them suitable for analysing evolutionary
relationships among these species. However, this ratio
could be affected by the small number of polymorphisms
present within the collection. The MLST data for the three
individual species were examined using: (1) the allelic
profiles, (2) the individual alleles at each locus, and (3)
the concatenated sequences for each allelic profile. When
the MLST profiles were compared, the STs were unique to
each species. The allele sequences were also species specific and no alleles were common among the neisseriae
when 149 gonococcal, 324 meningococcal, and 103 N.
lactamica isolates were examined. When additional N.
lactamica isolates from the carriage study [20] and from
German and Czech collections (unpublished data, not
shown) were included in the analysis, only two alleles

were common to more than one species. These alleles, at
the pgm locus, were present among both N. gonorrhoeae
and N. lactamica isolates. Alleles at this locus are among
the least variable in gonococci. Thus, it seems more probable that these common alleles are a result of shared
ancestry rather than interspecies recombination.
One of the advantages of a common MLST scheme for the
neisseriae is that it can be used to distinguish between the
Neisseria species and to identify unknown or misclassified
isolates. Both neighbour-joining and split decomposition
methods, using the concatenated MLST data, clustered the
isolates into three distinct groups. The clustering of the
STs into groups suggests that minimal recombination
occurs among the housekeeping genes of these three Neisseria. This is confirmed by the FST analysis, which suggests
low levels of recombination among the species, the high
number of fixed differences, the low number of shared
polymorphisms, and the lack of alleles shared among species. Interestingly, the split decomposition analysis clustered the gonococcal sequences within the diversity of the
meningococcus, reflecting the close ancestral relationship
between these bacteria [31].

Although genetic recombination has been reported
among N. gonorrhoeae, N. lactamica and N. meningitidis
[32,33], the physical and temporal separation of these
species within the human host is likely to contribute to a
low frequency of interspecies recombination. N. gonorrhoeae, which colonises the urogenital tract, is rarely
found in children as it is sexually transmitted and is only
occasionally found in adult throats; N. meningitidis is carried in the throats of approximately 10% of the adult population [34] but is rarely carried by young children and
found infrequently in the urogenital tract; N. lactamica is
carried by only about 2% of adults [35] but is highly prevalent in young children with carriage rates of around 40 %
[36,37]. While this limits opportunity for interspecies
recombination, it does not affect intraspecies recombination, which may occur frequently creating an increasing
number of STs from the available pool of alleles for each
species, as has been observed in meningococci [25].
The results of the present study are inconsistent with a previous report that the Neisseria housekeeping alleles used
in MLST were widely distributed among the neisseriae due
to frequent interspecies recombination [38]. This was an
in silico study that compared sets of 500 meningococcal
STs downloaded from the Neisseria MLST database with
all STs assigned to other named Neisseria species in the
same database. The data that were analysed were not verified experimentally and access to the original samples
was not requested. The present study did not include any
of the apparently hybrid STs as they did not form part of
the coherent populations analysed. We investigated these
apparent hybrid STs present in the database for which
samples were available. In all cases these were STs generated from historical freeze-dried cultures from which it
was impossible to grow live organisms. Further analysis of
the DNA samples suggested these were from mixed cultures and that the hybrid STs were a consequence of differential amplification of some loci. In conclusion, the
present study finds little experimental support for extensive interspecies recombination among housekeeping
genes in the Neisseria.
The lack of congruence among all of the phylogenetic
trees may be a consequence of either shared ancestry or
infrequent genetic exchange among the species. The relatively short lengths of the individual sequences used
would also reduce any phylogenetic signal and therefore
concatenated sequences were used to improve resolution.
Only the tree for the alleles at the gdh locus produced a
tree congruent with that obtained from the concatenated
nucleotide sequences. The gdh locus may have evolved
more rapidly than the other loci as these species diverged
away from the ancestral population, creating gdh alleles
that appear highly distinct for each species as shown in the
gdh gene tree.

Oligonucleotide primers were as previously published [16,25].

The species specificity of the gdh alleles and the congruence of the gdh gene tree with that produced from the concatenated sequences suggest that analysing sequences at
this locus alone may be useful in differentiating among
these three species and might help identify misclassified
isolates. Occasionally Neisseria are misidentified [39,40],
therefore a typing tool that can be exploited to differentiate species using either MLST profiles, allele sequences at
particular loci or the concatenated gene sequences, could
prove extremely helpful alongside traditional microbiological methods. This is especially important if commensal species are misidentified as N. gonorrhoeae, which
could lead to serious social, legal and medical consequences [41].
Although a number of other commensal neisseriae have
been typed (unpublished results from the MLST database
[23,24]), these were not included in this study as too few
isolates of these species have been typed for robust, meaningful analyses. MLST of representative collections of
these other commensals, in particular Neisseria polysaccharea and Neisseria cinerea, which are closely related to the
pathogenic Neisseria [42] would be advantageous, as
knowledge of the genotypes of these species could be
applied to species definitions and could facilitate identification of misclassified isolates.

Conclusion
This analysis has shown that MLST can be used effectively
to characterise N. gonorrhoeae collections, obtained both
locally and globally, and has demonstrated a level of dis-

crimination that appears comparable to that determined
for the meningococcus using MLST [16,25] and the gonococcus using the NG-MAST scheme [15]. As an identical
scheme has been used to characterize both N. meningitidis
and N. lactamica, these data can be exploited to help
define the three species, using either STs, individual alleles, in particular those at the gdh locus, or by concatenating the MLST data.

Methods
Bacterial isolates
A total of 149 gonococcal DNA samples were analysed,
including 58 from Liverpool, collected between 1981 and
1991 and 38 from Liverpool collected between 2000 and
2001, one of which was known to be AHU-. A collection
of 33 samples were obtained from isolates provided by
the Genitourinary Infections Reference Laboratory, Gonococcus Reference Unit, Public Health Laboratory, Bristol,
UK, and consisted of isolates that were geographically and
epidemiologically unlinked. These included 12 isolates
from cases of uncomplicated gonorrhoea from the UK
(Colchester, London-Central Middlesex, South Wales,
Epsom, Bristol, East London, Tyneside, Greenwich, Nottingham, Haverfordwest, and Birmingham), 11 isolates
from cases of uncomplicated gonorrhoea from elsewhere
in the world (Thailand, USA, South Africa, Pakistan,
Uzbekistan, Hong Kong, Ireland, Bangladesh, Russia, Taiwan, and Spain), and 10 isolates from different and unrelated cases of DGI (five blood cultures and five joint fluid
isolates). The remaining DNA samples were obtained
from five isolates collected in Africa (two from Malawi

and three from Nigeria), a collection of 12 AHU- isolates,
and three reference isolates (FA19, FA1090, F62). Information regarding these isolates is available from the Neisseria MLST database [23,24].
DNA preparation
DNA was extracted from 100 Âµl of boiled cell suspensions
obtained from gonococci collected in Liverpool with the
Isoquick nucleic acid extraction kit (ISC Bioexpress, Kaysville, UT, USA), used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Samples collected elsewhere were
provided as pure chromosomal DNA.
MLST
PCR amplifications and sequencing of the seven Neisseria
MLST housekeeping gene fragments: abcZ, adk, aroE,
fumC, gdh, pdhC, and pgm were undertaken with the oligonucleotide primers detailed in Table 4 using the protocol
described previously [43]. All nucleotide sequences were
determined directly from the PCR products. Briefly,
sequence templates were generated using the PCR, and
purified by precipitation with polyethylene glycol and
sodium chloride [44]. The termination products were generated by cycle sequencing with the appropriate primers
and BigDye terminators (Applied Biosystems). The products were then separated with an ABI prism 3700 automated DNA analyser. The sequence of each strand was
determined at least once, and the resultant DNA
sequences were assembled using the STADEN suite of
computer programs [45]. Allele numbers and sequence
types (STs) were assigned by querying the Neisseria MLST
database [23,24].
Data analysis
The computer program START, version 1.05 [46] was utilised to examine the number of polymorphic sites and the
ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions (dN/dS) among the alleles. Nucleotide sequences
from the seven loci were concatenated in-frame to produce single sequences of length 3282 bp for each ST, using
the concatenation tool found at the PubMLST website
[23,24]. DnaSP, version 4 [47], was used to calculate
shared polymorphisms and fixed differences [48] between
the isolate collections, and FST values [49] were calculated
using Arlequin, version 2, [50]. The FST statistic measures
the extent of genetic differentiation and computes an average level of gene flow, so that an FST value of zero would
indicate free genetic recombination, whereas an FST value
of one would indicate that recombination is unlikely).
Neighbour-joining trees were drawn from the concatenated MLST alleles and the individual allele sequences
using MEGA, version 2.1 [51], which was also used to
measure nucleotide sequence divergence. All three coding
positions were examined and the Kimura 2-parameter distance correction [52] was applied. The concatenated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/35

sequence data were also visualised using split decomposition analysis, using hamming distances with SplitsTree,
version 3.1 [53]. The reliability of the inferred phylogenies was evaluated using bootstrap tests (2000 replications).
