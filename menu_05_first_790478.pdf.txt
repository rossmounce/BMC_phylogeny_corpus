Abstract
The first Dominique Dormont International Conference on "Viral and host determinantsof HCV,
HCMV, and HIV infections "was held in Paris, Val-de-Grâce, on December 3–4, 2004. The following
is a summary of the scientific sessions of this meeting (http://www.congres-evenement.fr/
ddormont).

Background
The Dominique Dormont Conferences provide an international forum for the promotion of exchanges between
clinicians and fundamental scientists, including team
leaders and young researchers, involved in interdisciplinary research on chronic infections. They provide an occasion for researchers with common interests to get together
for two or three days of synthesis and intense discussion
on the most recent advances in their field, to crystallize
new research directions and collaborations. Contacts with
young scientists are strongly encouraged during the conference and such exchanges are facilitated by limiting
attendance at each conference to 150 participants, on a

first-come, first-served basis. The participants include
prestigious invited speakers for state-of-the-art introductions to each scientific session, followed by abstractdriven talks, most presented by young investigators.
Abstract-driven poster sessions also provide a space for
scientific exchanges between team leaders and young
researchers. An International Scientific Program Committee establishes the final program and abstracts are selected
according to the highest scientific standards.
The Dominique Dormont International Conferences will
be held every year on different specific thematic topics
related to "Host-Pathogen Interactions in Chronic InfecPage 1 of 10

tions". In December 2004, the topic of the first conference
was "Viral and Host Determinants of HCV, HCMV and
HIV Infections", considering the pathogenesis of these
chronic viral infections as a priority topic for the development of interdisciplinary research and collaborations
between clinicians and fundamental scientists worldwide.
The International Scientific Program Committee selected
original presentations on six topics of particular interest in
the field. Over the course of two days, stimulating
exchanges and discussions between team leaders and
young researchers, highlighting key issues in this research
field, were achieved, raising hopes of opening the way to
further international investigations on interactions
between host and viral determinants.

Summary of the scientific sessions
Session 1: Receptor and viral entry
Chairs: F. Arenzana and U. Koszinowski; Keynote Lecture:
"New aspects on hepatitis C virus replication, assembly
and entry into host cells" by R. Bartenschlager.
Factors enhancing viral entry
Viral entry depends in part on expression of the corresponding cellular receptors. The CD4 molecule has been
identified as the receptor for HIV, whereas the identity of
the receptors for HCV and HCMV is far from clear. Viruses
may also use alternative receptors (e.g. CXCR4 for some
HIV strains) or different receptors in different cell types
(e.g. epithelial GalCer for HIV). Furthermore, additional
molecules (coreceptors) may be required for entry (such
as chemokine receptors for HIV, CD13 for HCMV and the
scavenger receptor B1 for HCV). Finally, as recently
shown, the efficiency of viral entry is conditioned by multiple cellular factors that may enhance infection in cis or
in trans.

Bartenschlager et al. presented a review of recent findings
on HCV replication. Bartosch et al. then discussed their
observation that human serum components increase the
infectivity of HCV pseudoparticles. These components are
primate-specific as sera from chimpanzees and rhesus
monkeys increase HCV infectivity whereas sera from rabbits and cows do not. The enhancement of infectivity by
serum components has been described for other viruses
(Ebola virus). However, for HCV, this effect is not mediated by immunoglobulins or complement, but is instead
due to interplay between the HVR1 region of the HCV E2
glycoprotein, SR-B1 and serum HDL. Coating HCV with
such serum lipoproteins may also help the virus to evade
neutralizing antibodies.
Bomsel et al. discussed their observation that HIV-1 transcytosis is more efficient with infected cells than with cellfree virus. They showed that the transcytosis induced by
HIV-1-infected cells involves the adhesion-mediating

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/24

RGD-containing protein. They also showed that the scaffolding protein HSPG Agrin is expressed at the apical epithelial surface and acts as an attachment factor for HIV-1,
by interacting with the gp41 P1 lectin site, synergizing
binding to the epithelial receptor galactosyl ceramide.
GalCer is also expressed in immature dendritic cells
(iDCs) and may mediate the internalization of HIV and its
transfer to CD4+ cells in a lipid raft-dependent manner,
independently of DC-SIGN. The role of DC-SIGN in viral
retention and enhancement is not fully understood and
depends on the cell line studied. The data presented by
Nobile et al. suggest that HIV-1 X4 viruses can replicate in
iDC and Raji-DC-SIGN cells, but only covertly and slowly.
They show that transfer from iDC or DC-SIGN+ to CD4+
T cells occurs during the first few hours after exposure to
virus, whereas only replicating viruses (i.e. not single-cycle
virions) are transmitted several days after exposure, suggesting that long-term transmission is associated with replication in DC rather than with the retention of infectious
particles through DC-SIGN.
The fusion step of entry
After interaction of the HIV-1 envelope surface glycoprotein with host cell receptors and coreceptors, the fusogenic
transmembrane glycoprotein undergoes a series of conformational changes that lead to the insertion of the
fusion peptide into the membrane of the target cells, bring
the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity, and
finally triggering virus-cell membrane fusion. Each of
these steps provides an opportunity to prevent viral entry.
Several agents targeting viral entry are currently being
developed, and one – T-20 or Efarvirtide – has been
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for
use as an antiretroviral drug. Tokunaga et al. have studied
a highly fusogenic proviral HIV1-pL2 clone, with a view to
identifying the amino acids responsible for this enhancement of fusion activity. By making recombinant envelopes combining parts of pL2 with parts of the less
fusogenic pNL4.3, they identified glycine 36 of gp41 as
essential for fusion enhancement. This glycine is conserved in almost all HIV-1 isolates, but not in the prototypic pNL4.3. In pNL4.3, an aspartic acid is found in
position 36, preventing the correct formation of the helix
hairpin, thereby decreasing fusion activity and infectivity.
Interestingly, HIV-1 mutants escaping the effects of the
fusion inhibitor T-20 frequently present variations in
amino acid 36 of gp41.

Münch et al. constructed peptide libraries from the hemofiltrates of patients with chronic renal failure and searched
for antiviral peptide agents involved in the innate antiviral
response. They identified a 20-residue peptide – VIRIP
(virus inhibitory peptide) – that specifically inhibited
infection with various HIV-1 isolates. This peptide, corresponding to a C-terminal fragment of 1-antitrypsin (the

(page number not for citation purposes)

Retrovirology 2005, 2:24

most abundant circulating serine protease inhibitor),
seems to exert its antiviral effects by direct interaction with
the gp41 fusion peptide.
Hovanessian et al. identified a caveolin-1-binding motif
within the ectodomain of gp41. This motif is conserved in
all HIV-1 isolates and seems to be functional, as gp41 is
found complexed with caveolin in infected cells. These
researchers designed peptides (CBD1) corresponding to
the consensus domain of gp41 and showed that these
peptides bound caveolin-1 specifically. The peptides also
elicited the production of specific anti-CBD1 antibodies,
which inhibited the infection of primary CD4 cells by laboratory and primary HIV-1 isolates. The antibodies act at
two different steps: they prevent the infection of cells by
HIV particles and aggregate gp41 at the plasma membrane
of HIV-1-infected cells, resulting in the production of
defective particles. Unlike other gp41 epitopes, the CBD1
epitope is not a transient conformational epitope.
Receptors and signaling
Does the interaction between HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and cell receptors, including the chemokine receptors
CCR5 and CXCR4, for viral entry induce signals relevant
to viral replication and cell function? This is a key issue in
this field. Chakrabarti et al. presented convincing data
showing that X4-tropic Env gp120, whether monomeric
or in its natural conformation on inactivated HIV-1 virions, triggers a signaling array similar to that induced by
SDF-1, the natural ligand for CXCR4, in unstimulated primary CD4 T cells. At concentrations (200 nM) close to the
Kd for CXCR4, HIV-1 gp 120 efficiently activates Ga proteins and induces calcium mobilization, and activation of
the MAP and PI3 kinase pathways. Inactivated virus and
gp120 trigger CXCR4-dependent actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and cell chemotaxis. Thus, gp120 may function as a chemokine, inducing structural and functional
changes favoring viral entry and replication, and may
affect the trafficking and functional responses of unstimulated CD4+ T cells. The interactions between CD4 and
CCR5 at the plasma membrane and their role in HIV-1
entry were explored by F. Bachelerie and coworkers, using
FRET on living cells transduced with both receptors. The
results of this group suggest that the two molecules are
colocalized on the cell membrane, where they interact in
a stable fashion. The disruption of this interaction inhibits
R5 HIV-1 infection. The same team also presented data on
the relationships between CCR5 activation, signaling and
β-arrestin-mediated endocytosis and chemotaxis, suggesting that different CCR5 structural determinants may be
involved in these responses.

Session 2: Viral sanctuary
Chair: R. Pomerantz; Keynote Lecture: "HIV residual disease: The main barrier to viral eradication in the era of
HAART" by R. Pomerantz.

Roger Pommeranz introduced the session with his keynote speech on "Viral reservoirs as major obstacles for
viral eradication despite effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)". The combination of at least 3 different antiretroviral drugs in the clinical management of
HIV-1 infection has improved the prognosis of HIV-1
infected patients. However, despite this therapy, HIV-1
has not been eradicated, at least partly due to latent HIV1 replication occurring in the resting TCD4+.
Combination therapy to induce out of latency
The HIV-1 replication cycle includes a large number of
possible stages for latency and persistence. Two mechanisms have been described: pre-and post-integration into
the human genome. A large body of data has accumulated
to indicate that the cells of HIV-1- infected patients may
contain proviral DNA but produce only a small amount of
viral RNA. In pre-integration HIV-1 latency, differences in
latently infected cells may be observed, depending on the
severity of disease. The virus may maintain cellular latency
via various molecular mechanisms, which may depend on
cell type. Understanding the basis of viral latency would
make it easier to design new strategies for viral eradication. Because resting CD4+ T-cells are a major component
of the reservoir of circulating cells in vivo, Pomerantz suggested that persistently infected cells should be activated
in order to purge the viral reservoirs, making it then possible to control the production of new viruses by HAART.
For example, IL-2 treatment could be combined with d4T/
3TC/Efavirenz; or treatment with OKT3 anti-T cell receptor monoclonal antibody could be combined with ddI.
However, experimental data have shown viral rebound
after cell stimulation with IL-2, for example. The new
viruses produced upon activation came from follicular
dendritic cells, lymph nodes, cells in sanctuary sites and
other tissues. Most of the HIV produced from reservoirs
and during rebound are defective in the V3 sequence of
the HIV-1 envelope gene. Resting cells reflect the state of
the immune system. In contrast to the results obtained
with IL-2, therapeutic strategies based on the stimulation
of cells with IL-7 associated with HAART have yielded
promising results. IL7 alone is indeed a more potent activator of latent infected cells than IL-2. Most of the newly
produced viruses had a CXCR4 and CCR5 phenotype.

Although these approaches show promise for circulating
resting CD4+ T-cells, new strategies must be defined to
target novel pharmacological drugs to viral sanctuaries
such as the brain or testes. A combination of both

Retrovirology 2005, 2:24

approaches may facilitate eradication of the viral reservoir
in HIV-1-infected individuals.
Massips et al. have followed three HIV-1-infected patients
with viral loads below the detection threshold and who
have been on HAART for 7 years. Viral DNA was detected
in the memory and naive CD4+ T-cell subsets and in
CD14+ monocytes, but not in CD56+CD3-NK cells. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the various types of
blood cell in two of the three patients harbored genetically different quasispecies. This suggests that the virus
populations within each type of blood cell evolved independently and may originate from difference sources (differences in CXCR4 and/or CCR5). Real cellspecific
compartmentalization of residual virus populations is
thus observed in patients on HAART. For instance, in one
of the three patients investigated, CCR5 variants were
found in naive CD4+ T-cells and in memory CD4+ T cells.
However, both CXCR4 and CCR5 variants were present in
CD14+ monocytes. In another HIV-1-infected patient,
CXCR4 variants were found in CD14+ monocytes and in
naive CD4+ T cells, whereas both CXCR4 and CCR5 variants were found in resting memory CD4+ T cells.
Ivan Hirsh et al. reported that CCR5 HIV-1 variants predominantly infect CD62Lnegative memory T cells, which
selectively express the CCR5 receptor. The predominance
of CXCR4 HIV-1 variants in less differentiated memory
CD4+ T cells may be related to their activation state, as
suggested by the expression of both CD45RA and
CD45RO molecules on their membrane. In addition,
most viruses isolated from peripheral blood resting cells
of HIV-1-infected patients with levels of viral RNA in
plasma below the detection threshold have few mutations
conferring drug resistance. The CCR5 HIV-1 variants,
which predominantly infected memory T cells, were
found to be resistant to nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NRTIs) such as zidovudine and lamivudine. As
pointed out by J. Ghosn and colleagues, resistance mutations acquired by HIV-1 during primary infection may
correspond to the dominant viral population, and are
archived in cellular reservoirs at an early time point,
despite treatment. In summary, virological failure in the
resting memory CD4+ T cells, the emergence of a dominant pool of HIV-1-resistant virus very early in primary
infection and the difficulties involved in getting drugs into
viral sanctuary sites, once again raise questions as to the
best combination of approaches for eradicating HIV-1
from infected individuals.
HCV and IFN-alpha
Feray et al. reported the effect of interferon-alpha in
patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Differences
in the composition of HCV quasispecies between plasma
and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) suggest

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/24

that PBMCs support viral replication. The frequency of
compartmentalization in 119 naive patients chronically
infected with HCV was determined and found to be correlated to virological response to inteferon-alpha. A significant proportion of HCV patients responding well to IFNalpha treatment were found to be coinfected with variants
not found in plasma. This relationship was independent
of route of infection, plasma genotype and duration of
infection.
Session 3: Restriction of viral replication
Chairs: B. Cullen and D. Moradpour; Keynote Lecture:
"Defensive arts: innate intracellular immunity against retroelements" by D. Trono.
Innate and adaptive immunities to HCV in the host
Most viral infections are successfully controlled by conventional innate and adaptive immune responses developed by the host. Viruses such as HIV, HCMV and HCV
are able to persist in their host in the long term thanks to
multiple strategies aimed at shutting down antiviral
defenses. However, one major difference between HIV
and HCMV on the one hand, and HCV on the other, is
that HCV infections may, in some cases, resolve spontaneously or under treatment. Critical immunological events
may thus take place early in viral infection that lead to
viral clearance. Our understanding of these early events in
the antiviral immune response has led to great efforts in
recent years to diagnose HCV infection during the acute
phase. This trend was illustrated by the two presentations
on HCV in this session. F. L. Cosset focused on the analysis of neutralizing antibodies in a cohort of 17 individuals
acutely infected with a single nosocomial outbreak strain
of genotype 1b HCV. Neutralizing activity, evaluated by
assessing the ability of the patients' sera to inhibit the
infection of HuH7 cells by HCV pseudotyped particles,
was monitored, together with viral load and phylogenetic
analysis of the predominant viral strains was also carried
out. The patients studied could be divided into two subgroups on the basis of the infecting genotype 1b strains.
Group 1, infected with strain A, showed a very large
decrease in viral load within nine weeks of infection
whereas group 2, infected with strain B, maintained high
viremia. One major finding of this study was that group 1
patients display potent neutralizing activity that is
inversely correlated with viremia. The sera from group 2
patients were found to facilitate infection with HCVpp
rather than neutralizing such infections. This study
strongly suggests that neutralizing antibodies are involved
in the control of HCV infection – an observation in apparent contradiction with recent reports [1-3] and with data
reported by C. Bain in this same session. Bain's study was
performed on a cohort of seven intravenous drug users
acutely infected with genotype 3 HCV treated with
pegylated IFN-alpha. In this study, the neutralizing activ-

Retrovirology 2005, 2:24

ity of the patients' sera neatly paralleled titers of antibodies specific for the envelope E2 glycoprotein. However,
these neutralizing antibodies were found both in patients
who responded to antiviral therapy and in those who did
not, calling into question the role of neutralizing antibodies in therapeutic resolution of acute HCV infection. Longitudinal analysis of T-cell immune responses did not
result in the identification of immune correlates of the
therapeutic resolution of acute HCV infection. T-cell
responses were surprisingly weak throughout follow-up,
as shown by comparison with recently published data
[4,5] but were improved by treatment with immunomodulators. The initiation of IL-2 treatment strongly increased
not only the vigor, but also the breadth of HCV-specific
immune responses, revealing significant reactivity to the
newly described alternative reading frame protein (ARFP)
of HCV, in particular. However, therapeutic recovery from
HCV infection could be achieved in the presence of T-cell
suppressive mechanisms, suggesting that the presence of
immunosuppressive T cells is not in itself responsible for
therapy failure and subsequent chronic infection and that
these cells probably modulate detrimental immune
responses to maintain persistently low levels of liver
inflammation in chronic HCV infection. The existence of
immune responses to ARFP provides further evidence that
this protein is synthesized in natural HCV infection and,
like conventional HCV antigens, is expressed during the
early steps of HCV infection. Together with published
studies, these two presentations highlighted the difficulties involved in identifying immune correlates of viral
clearance in a viral infection that may resolve spontaneously.
Intrinsic host immunity to HIV
In contrast to what has been reported for HCV, some HIVinfected individuals may control disease progression, but
they never eliminate viral infection altogether, suggesting
that the conventional immune system is unable to control
viral replication. In addition to conventional innate and
acquired immune responses, complex organisms have
developed so-called "intrinsic" immunity, mediated by
constitutively expressed restriction factors that efficiently
prevent or limit viral infections [6]. Two major classes of
factor have been shown to restrict retroviral infections by
blocking incoming retroviral particles (Fv1 and TRIM5a)
or by the specific deamination of dC residues to generate
dU, leading to the hypermutation of viral DNA and blocking viral replication (APOBEC3; class: cytidine deaminases). Obviously, viruses have evolved strategies to
overcome these restriction mechanisms. D. Trono, in the
opening lecture of the session, summarized recent data on
the cytidine deaminase superfamily, mostly focusing on
APOBEC3G [7]. This restriction factor, primarily found in
T lymphocytes and macrophages, is packaged into HIV
virions in the absence of Vif protein, via specific interac-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/24

tion with the NC/p6 domain of the Gag polyprotein precursor (B. Cullen) or non-specific RNA binding [8]. Upon
the infection of new target cells, APOBEC3G deaminates
the nascent minus strand DNA, resulting in a less stable
uracyl-containing minus-strand DNA, which is degraded
or yields hypermutated plus-strand DNA liable to encode
defective viral proteins. In the presence of Vif, APOBEC3G
is targeted for proteasome degradation. Bet protein,
derived from primate foamy virus, can partially rescue Vifdeleted virions (B. Cullen). APOBEC3G has been shown
to block a wide range of retroviruses and unrelated viruses
such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) [9]. If hepatoma HuH7
cells are cotransfected with a plasmid containing the HBV
genome and a plasmid encoding APOBEC3G, intracellular levels of core-associated HBV DNA are significantly
lower than those in cells transformed with the viral
genome alone. Although this effect is inhibited by HIV-1
Vif, catalytically inactive APOBEC3G continues to have an
inhibitory effect on HBV DNA, suggesting that
APOBEC3G may act on HBV and retroviruses via different
mechanisms. However, one unresolved question concerns the potential relevance of such an interaction as
APOBEC3G is expressed in lymphoid cells and HBV
mostly infects hepatocytes. Anti-HIV-1 treatments targeting Vif protein may eventually come out of this work.
RNAi targeted to HIV
R. Benarous presented work on another antiretroviral
strategy, the use of RNA interference to block the interaction between HIV integrase and a cellular protein, the lens
epithelium-derived growth factor/transcription coactivator p75 (LEDGF/p75) protein. HIV-1 replication is
strongly inhibited by the presence of siRNA targeting the
3' end of the LEDGF coding region, suggesting that this
protein is required for HIV infection. Further experiments
with HIV integrase (Gln168) mutants displaying defective
HIV-1 DNA integration, demonstrated the involvement of
LEDGF in the targeting of integrase to chromosomes. HIV1 can infect the central nervous system (CNS), where it
causes progressive cognitive and motor dysfunctions.
Astrocytes have been shown to be target cells for HIV-1 in
the CNS but these cells allow only limited replication of
HIV-1. They can also be infected with HIV-1 in vitro but
such infections are generally of very low and transient productivity, suggesting that astrocytes may contain a factor
that restricts HIV-1 replication.
Rev and RNA transport
In this session, S. Kramer-Hämmerle reported an abnormal distribution of HIV-1 Rev in astrocytes, with a blockade of its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling function leading to
the inhibition of nuclear export of HIV-1 mRNAs. Using a
cDNA library from astrocytes, a double-hybrid strategy in
yeast and then in mammalian cells, Kramer-Hämmerle
identified a cellular factor – 16.4.1 – that colocalized with

Page 5 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

Retrovirology 2005, 2:24

Rev in transfected cells. This factor also interacted with an
exportin, CRM1, a member of the karyopherin family of
nucleocytoplasmic transport factors and a cellular cofactor for the Rev-dependent export of HIV-1 RNAs. 16.4.1,
which is probably part of a larger protein, reduces Rev
activity. These data illustrate the huge diversity and complexity of mechanisms developed by these two viruses for
the establishment of chronic infection. However, these
two viral infections differ primarily in that HCV-infected
patients, unlike HIV-infected patients, may recover spontaneously from infection. This may explain why the study
of conventional immune responses has always been a
major research field for HCV whereas HIV research is gradually turning to the investigation of more intrinsic interactions between host and viral proteins.
Session 4: Viral infection and innate immunity
Chairs: C. Soderberg-Naucler & L. Zitvogel; Keynote Lecture: "Immunopathology of prion infection" by A. Aguzzi
Prions
This session began with a keynote lecture by A. Aguzzi,
presenting data on two aspects of prion infection. He first
presented an immunointervention strategy for modulating the course of scrapie in mice, based on a chimeric PrP
molecule consisting of two PrP fused to the constant fragment of an IgG (PrP-Fc2). The aim was to interfere with
the PrPsc – PrPc interaction, which results in there being
two PrPsc conformers and spreads "infection", as a means
of limiting disease. Aguzzi's team hypothesized that an Fclinked dimer of PrPc would interact with PrPsc without
transconformation, thereby blocking prion progression.
Such an interaction was demonstrated to exist as PrP-Fc2
precipitated PrPsc from diseased brains. Crossing WT
mice and transgenic mice expressing PrP-Fc2 delayed the
onset of scrapie (by up to 150 days) and decreased PrPsc
accumulation. Moreover, PrP-Fc2, which normally settles
in the bottom layer of membrane fraction gradients, was
redistributed to the raft layer, which is the site of PrPsc is
in infected brain preparations. Nevertheless, the delay in
scrapie onset may not be entirely due to higher levels of
PrPsc clearance through the reticulo-endothelial system,
as the Fc fragment was deleted from its FcgR interaction
site. These encouraging data led to the transfer of PrP-Fc2
into WT mice brain via lentiviral vector, which conferred
clinical resistance to scrapie for up to 265 days. The PrPFc2 transferred by the lentivirus decreased astrogliosis in
the injected hemisphere whereas the contralateral hemisphere continued to displaye strong GFAP reactivity. The
PrPsc signal was cleared only near the injection site. The
protection conferred by PrP-Fc2 requires central expression, as peripheral injection is not protective, although
PrP-Fc2 expression can be targeted to oligodendrocytes, a
cell type not infected by prions, in the periphery.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/24

Aguzzi then rapidly presented data for transgenic mice
displaying targeted tissue-specific expression of lymphotoxin antibody. In these mice, which displayed tertiary
lymphoid tissue development in the liver, the kidney or
the pancreas, the replication responsible for infectivity
occurs in these organs. This raises questions of food safety,
if animals with inflammation sites are used for meat, but
may also open up new possibilities for the use of peripheral preventive strategies such as PrP-Fc2 injection during
the invasion phase of spongiform encephalopathies.
NK cells and HCV, HIV, and HCMV
The session then moved on to more conventional viruses
and dealt with the effects of HCV, HIV and HCMV actions
on natural killer cells and monocytes/macrophages. U. C.
Meier presented comparative data on NK cell modulation
in response to HCV and HIV infection. The major subpopulation of NK cells in uninfected humans is CD3-/CD56
dim NK cells. These cells are highly cytolytic and display
strong NK receptor expression, and low levels of trafficking and cytokine production. The minor CD3-/CD56
bright subpopulation displays the opposite phenotype
with respect to these characteristics. In response to HCV
and HIV infections, the number of NK cells in the blood
decreases and there is a shift toward the CD56 bright subpopulation, with no change in CD57 expression on NK
cells. This results in a decrease in the percentage of perforin-bright NK cells in favor of perforin-dim cells. In
HCV patients, this decrease was shown not to correspond
to NK cell accumulation in the liver. The response of NK
cells to HCV and HIV infections differed in that interferon
production under IL12 + IL18 stimulation decreased in
the NK cells of HIV patients but increased in those of HCV
patients. The decrease in frequency of NK cells may be the
consequence of a loss of IL15 expression, as the serum
concentration of this cytokine is low in both infections, or
of an impaired response to the IL15 survival signal. Such
an impaired response to IL15 was demonstrated only in
HIV infection, in terms of survival and cytolysis.
HCV, HCMV and monocyte activation
Assessment of the effect of HCV and HCMV on monocyte
activation and differentiation as a means of estimating
viral persistence was the subject of two talks, by P. Balard
and S. Gredmark. HCV persistence is thought to be associated with a Th2 bias, which is demonstrated by a decrease
in IL-12 production and an increase in CD36 membrane
expression on monocytes. Chêne et al. showed that HCV
core protein induces the overproduction of PGJ2 by the
PLA2 – Cox2 cascade, with Cox2 overproduced. PGJ2 is a
ligand for PPARl, which is activated in HCV-core-treated
monocytes, and involved in CD36 and IL-12 modulation.
These results are consistent with the notion that the HCV
present in the patient's serum may establish a chronic
infection by inducing an M2 orientation of monocyte acti-

vation, leading to a biased T-cell response. Monocytesmacrophages are also critical to HCMV infection, as this
virus can be reactivated in vitro from macrophages. HCMV
strategies for escaping immune surveillance include
decreases in the expression of MHC class I and class II
molecules, the impairment of T-cell activation, and a
decrease in NK cell-mediated lysis. Gredmark et al. found
that a suspension of HCMV inhibited the differentiation
of monocytes into mature macrophages, resulting in the
production of monocytoid cells with impaired migration
and phagocytosis and low levels of β-chemokine production. This inhibition was achieved with inactivated
HCMV, but not with HCMV suspension supernatant; nor
was it reproduced with HIV or measles virus. The viral
effector was identified as the gpB protein of HCMV, which
binds to CD13 and signals by means of Ca2+ flux, through
this receptor. CD13 is an N-aminopeptidase involved in
monocyte-macrophage adhesion and migration. Using
monoclonal CD13 antibodies, Gredmark were able to
mimic or to anatagonize the effect of HCMV on macrophage differentiation, depending on the clone used.
These two talks strongly suggested that monocytes-macrophages are, together with NK cells, a major target for the
prevention of viral persistence and infection chronicity.
However, viruses may use several different strategies,
involving numerous mechanisms to establish chronic
infections.
Session 5: Chemokines and inflammatory cytokines

T-cell homeostasis in HIV infection: role of the thymus"
by R. Sekaly.
CD4 T-cell homeostasis in HIV infection: role of the thymus
In chronic viral infections, CD4+ T-cell responses are associated with disease control. R. Sekaly reported stronger
proliferative HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell responses in
aviremic than in viremic patients. Long-term CD4+ T-cell
memory depended on IL-2-producing CD4+ T cells
whereas cells producing only IFN-γ were short-lived.
Sekalt characterized the ex-vivo phenotype of CD4+ T cells
in more detail by genomic and proteomic analysis, and
identified genes differentially expressed along the CD4+
T-cell differentiation pathway: 1) TOSO, which inhibits
Fas- and TNF-mediated apoptosis, and PIM2 and DAD1
were more strongly expressed in naive and central memory CD4+ T cells than in effector/memory and effector
CD4+ T cells. These genes were also expressed more
strongly in samples from healthy donors than in samples
from viremic patients; 2) Conversely, Rab27a, which indicates the activation state of T-cell maturation, was
expressed more strongly in effector and effector/memory
CD4+ T cells than in naive and central memory CD4+ T

cells. These data provide new insights into CD4+ T-cell
homeostasis during HIV infection.
Cytokine production in the livers of HCV+HIV- and HCV+HIV+
individuals
As cytokines play a crucial role in controlling the immune
responses against viral persistence, G. Paranhos-Baccala et
al. measured intrahepatic levels of IFN-gamma, TNFalpha, TGF-β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12p40 by realtime PCR in 12 HCV+HIV- and 14 HCV+HIV+ individuals. They showed that the detection rates for individual
cytokines were higher for the HCV+HIV- group than for
the HCV+HIV+ grou. However, only the detection rates
for TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-10 differed significantly
between the two groups. Moreover, median levels of IFNgamma, IL-8 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the
HCV+HIV+ group. This study demonstrated the existence
of a global defect in cytokine signaling in HCV+HIV+ individuals, which may contribute to HCV persistence.
HIV interactions with other pathogens in coinfected human lymphoid
tissues
Recent epidemiological studies have reported examples of
of the inhibition of HIV replication by microbial interactions. In a study of ex vivo -infected human lymphoid tissue, L. Marogolis et al. showed that two microbes (measles
virus (MV) and Toxoplasma gondii (TG)) inhibited the replication of both CXCR4-tropic (X4) and CCR5-tropic (R5)
HIV-1. This inhibitory effect was particularly marked for
R5 virus and was mediated by a parasite-encoded cyclophilin, C18, in TG-infected tissues, and by a CC chemokine, RANTES, in MV-infected tissues. These microbes were
also found to display a moderate cytopathic effect on lymphocytes, decreasing the number of R5 and X4 HIV-1 targets in co-infected tissue. This study highlighted the
crucial role of the cytokine/chemokine network in interactions between microbes in the human host.
Early induction of an anti-inflammatory environment may temper Tcell activation during SIVagm infection
During primary SIVagm infection, African green monkeys
(AGM) can display a transient decline in CD4+ T-cell
counts together with transient T-cell activation until the
end of primary infection. Cytokine gene expression was
assessed in a longitudinal studycarried out by Ploquin et
al., before infection and at intervals of two to three days
during primary infection (PI), and then regularly until day
430 postinfection. The following observations were made
in SIVagm-infected AGMs: 1)A significant increase in TGFb1 and Foxp3 gene expression beginning in the first week
after infection, coinciding with expansions of the populations of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ T cells; 2) An
increase in IL-10 gene expression during the 2nd and 3rd
week p.i, with no change in TNF-alpha gene expression at
any point in the study; 3) Changes in the plasma concen-

tration of cytokines correlated with gene expression
changes. In conclusion, the harmful generalized immune
activation levels observed during the post-acute phase of
SIVagm infections may be controlled by the early induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, as observed in this
study.
HIV infection: role of IL-7 in immune reconstitution after HAART or
HAART plus IL-2 and preclinical assessment of its therapeutic
potential
As plasma IL-7 levels are negatively correlated with CD4
counts during HIV disease progression and antiretroviral
therapy, J. Theze suggested that IL-7 is part of a feedback
loop regulating the size of the CD4 pool. In this study,
plasma IL-7 levels at the start of HAART were found to be
positively correlated with an increase in CD4 counts during the first two years of HAART. Plasma IL-7 concentrations increased in HIV-infected patients receiving HAART
plus IL-2. Theze assessed the therapeutic potential of IL-7
by studying IL-7R expression in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes from three groups of patients (group 1: naive for
antiretroviral therapy (plasma viral load > 10,000 copies /
ml and CD4 count > 350 cells /mm3); group 2 : HAARTtreated patients with CD4 > 400 cells/mm3 and plasma
viral load < 50 copies /ml; group 3: HAART-treated
patients with CD4 counts remaining low (CD4 < 250 cells
/mm3) despite good control of plasma viral load (< 50
copies /ml)). The major findings of this study were: 1)
CD127 was less strongly expressed on CD4 lymphocytes
from group 1 and group 3 patients than on those from
group 2 patients; 2) CD8+ lymphocytes from HIVinfected patients were mostly CD27-CD45RO+ and
CD27-CD45RO-; 3) High viremia was correlated with IL7R dysfunction, whereas HAART-treated patients recovered a functional IL-7R. These concluded that the IL-7/IL7R system plays a role in HIV disease and that IL-7 could
be used in immune interventions to treat HIV infection.
The HIV-1 mediated induction of ET-1 in the CNS increases the
secretion of markers of blood-brain barrier failure, which are altered
by HIV-1 protease inhibitors, nelfinavir
N. Didier et al. suggested that endothelin-1 (ET-1) is
involved in the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection
because ET-1 levels have recently been shown to be correlated with the degree of encephalopathy in HIV-1-infected
individuals. Using a model of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB), N. Didier et al. showed that the production of ET1 by brain endothelial cells in response to HIV-1 leads to
disruption of the BBB by the pro-inflammatory cytokines
(IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8) produced by astrocytes. As proteases
play an important role in inflammatory processes, nelfinavir decreases the level of cytokine secretion, and may
therefore be useful in HAD.

Session 6: Dendritic cells and activation of T-cell antiviral
responses
Chairs: B. Autran & A. Hosmalin; Keynote Lecture: "Combat between cytomegalovirus and dendritic cells in T-cell
response" by C. Davrinche;
Combat between cytomegalovirus and dendritic cells in the T-cell
response
During HCMV infection, innate (apoptosis, IFNα/β, complement, NK cells and dendritic cells) and adaptive
(CD4+, CD8+ and antibodies) immune responses are
generated. The main target proteins for CD4 and CD8 T
cells are IE1 and pp65 (early proteins). In a model consisting of dendritic cells (DC) cocultured with HCMVinfected fibroblasts, C. Davrinche showed that the fibroblasts rapidly became apoptotic. The DC acquired pp65
from infected fibroblasts via a mechanism requiring cellto-cell contact and, after 6 hours, DC produced TNFα and
IL6. In the presence of PBMC, a large number of pp65-specific CD8 T cells were generated and a peak of IFNγ production was observed 24 h after incubation. DC
maturation (upregulation of CD83) was induced by incubation with HCMV-infected fibroblasts, and a peak in
CD83 expression was observed after 6 h, with levels
decreasing after 48 h and 72 h. This maturation seems to
be a prerequisite for efficient T-cell stimulation. C. Davrinche has identified a soluble factor (TGF-β) secreted at a
late stage of HCMV infection in fibroblasts that downregulates CD83. He has also shown that the IL10 homolog
carried by HCMV interferes with DC maturation and
cross-presentation. Overall, the results presented suggested that cross-presentation must occur soon after infection by HCMV to prevent the soluble factor-mediated
viral escape mechanism. This may explain why the main
target proteins for T-cell responses are IE1 and pp65,
which are available early in infection.
HIV-1-induced dysfunction of naive CD8+ T cells
D. Favre showed that in the SCID-hu thymus/liver mouse
model, HIV infection of the thymus resulted in a CD8
functional defect due to impaired signaling via the TCR
complex, with effects on calcium flux and IL-2 responses
(cytokine production and proliferation). After the transplantation of a human thymus/liver graft in SCID mice,
thymocytes from SCID-hu mice were infected in week 18
with HIV-1 NL4-3, BaL, or primary stocks and the infected
animals were compared with mock-infected animals. HIV
infection of the thymus induced the upregulation of
MHC-I in thymocytes, correlated with increases in HIV
RNA levels and the development of single-positive CD8low
(SP8) thymocytes. Following polyclonal stimulation
(anti-CD3/CD8) via the TCR, a significantly weaker calcium flux response and lower proliferative capacity, as
measured by CFSE, were observed in SCID-hu thymus/
liver mice than in control mice. Thus, in the SCID-hu thy-

Retrovirology 2005, 2:24

mus/liver mouse model, HIV infection results in the selection of CD8low T cells with defective calcium flux
signaling. Favre also presented data concerning the activation status of circulating CD8+ T cells from 40 HIV-1infected patients at various stages of the disease. In
patients with progressive disease, a decrease in CD8+ naive
(CD45RA+CD27+) T-cell counts was observed, with low
levels of CD8 expression, associated with chronic
immune activation, as assessed with the CD38 marker. A
dysfunction in calcium flux and IL-2 responses is also
observed in patients with progressive HIV disease. In conclusion, the CD8low T cells observed after experimental
HIV infection of the thymus and in the peripheral blood
of patients with progressive HIV disease seem to display
MHC-I upregulation and defect in signaling across the
TCR, associated with chronic immune activation (CD38).
Fabre suggested that the higher density of MHC-I on cells
in the thymus might lead to high-avidity interactions with
TCRs on developing thymocytes and hence to supranormal levels of negative selection, but it remains unclear
how these CD8low T cells are generated. Such dysfunctional CD8low T cells would contribute to the profound
immunodeficiency associated with HIV disease progression.
Role of HIV-1 Nef in viral replication in lymphocytes
The results presented by Nathalie Sol-Foulon demonstrated a requirement for ZAP70 for efficient HIV replication in Jurkat cells and the severe impairment of
replication in Nef-deleted virus in Zap-deleted Jurkat cells.
In these experiments, Jurkat cells or PBLs were infected
with a wild-type HIV or Nef-deleted HIV and stimulated
by PMA iono or superantigen. IL-2 production was then
evaluated. Sol-Foulon showed that HIV infection
increased activation (as assessed by determining IL-2 production) in response to T-cell stimulation via the TCR or
the MAP kinase signaling pathways. Infection with wildtype HIV or Nef-deleted HIV had no significant effect on
IL-2 production (53% and 43%, respectively) so Nef does
not significantly affect this process. The absence of ZAP70
is known to cause a major defect in the TCR. HIV replication is strongly affected in Zap-deleted Jurkat cells but it is
unclear which step of the viral cycle is affected and the
effects of Zap on viral replication in primary T cells and
the links between transduction pathways and HIV replication are unknown: Sol-Foulon is currently investigating
these aspects.
The extent of CD4+ T cell apoptosis during primary SIV infection is
predictive of the rate of progression to AIDS
J. Estaquier showed that the rate of CD4+ T-cell apoptosis
was correlated with subsequent viremia levels whereas
levels of CD8+ T cells were not. In rhesus macaques experimentally infected with the pathogenic SIVmac251 isolate, peak numbers of apoptotic cells in the lymph node

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/2/1/24

T-cell areas were significantly higher in future rapid progressors than in the slow progressors during the first two
weeks of infection. No correlation was found between the
rate of viral replication within lymph nodes and the extent
of FasL-mediated apoptosis in CD4+ T cells. The mechanism of apoptosis seems to be independent of the caspase
and AIF pathways. The role played by mitochondria was
also evaluated in SIVmac251-infected macaques and the
results presented indicated that the Bak gene is involved in
SIV-mediated CD4+ T cell apoptosis. Estaquier concluded
that memory T cells are lost early in infection and that levels of apoptotic CD4+ T cells are predictive of disease progression.
A T-cell based HCV vaccine capable of blunting acute viremia and
protecting against acute and chronic disease induced by heterologous
viral challenge in chimpanzees
Alfredo Nicosia presented his results for HCV-vaccination
with an MRK adenovirus at weeks 0 and 25 and a DNA EP
boost in week 35. Chimpanzees were challenged with a
heterologous virus in week 49, and the vaccination was
shown to have elicited potent, broad-range and durable
effector T-cell responses. The immunogen used was from
a non structural region of HCV corresponding to genotype
1b, the most frequent strain in USA and Europe. The challenge involved H77, corresponding to a genotype 1a. In
this study, five animals were vaccinated and five others
received the control vector. Specific IFNγ-CD8+ responses
were maximal in week 37, after the booster. Polyspecific
HCV- CD8+ responses were detected in peripheral blood
and in the liver. These specific immune responses,
induced by vaccination, were also elicited by the with
challenge strain, demonstrating cross-reaction. Nicosia
showed that eight weeks after challenge, viral load in vaccinated animals was less than one hundredth that in control animals (P = 0.009). He also demonstrated an
absence of liver damage in vaccinated animals, whereas
ALT and GGT levels were high in control animals. He concluded that this vaccine can prevent hepatitis and protect
animals against chronic infections caused by heterologous viruses.
Cross-presentation by dendritic cells of HIV antigens from live
infected CD4+ T lymphocytes
e Hosmalin showed that dendritic cells (DC) can capture,
and cross-present to specific-CD8+ T cell lines, HIV antigens from live, infected cells as efficiently as antigens from
apoptotic infected CD4+ T cells. When MDDC + LPS were
cultured with various sources of HIV antigens (peptides
from Gag, RT, free virus, CD4+ T cell lines infected with
HIV) and presented to CD8+ T cell lines specific for Pol
476–484, the cross-presentation of HIV antigens from
apoptotic infected CD4+ T cells was more efficient than
direct DC infection or other sources of HIV antigens. Hosmalin also presented other data, showing that similar lev-

els of cross-presentation are also observed in live infected
CD4+ T cells. She performed similar experiments with live
infected CD4+ T cells and ex vivo PBMC from HIV-infected
patients. In HIV-infected patients, circulating CD8+ T cells
recognized cross-presented HIV antigens from live
infected T cells. Thus, anti-HIV immunity begins before
the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, the proportion of
CD83+ mature DC increased when DC were incubated
with primary CD4+ T cell blasts, whether apoptotic or not,
and independent of HIV infection. Hosmalin concluded
that, during HIV infection, live or apoptotic HIV-infected
T lymphocytes can supply antigens and costimulation signals for MHC class-I-restricted presentation by DC or
induce tolerance in patients with low CD4 counts and
impaired CD4 T-cell functions.
