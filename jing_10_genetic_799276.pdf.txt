Abstract
Background: The genetic diversity of crop species is the result of natural selection on the wild progenitor and
human intervention by ancient and modern farmers and breeders. The genomes of modern cultivars, old
cultivated landraces, ecotypes and wild relatives reflect the effects of these forces and provide insights into
germplasm structural diversity, the geographical dimension to species diversity and the process of domestication
of wild organisms. This issue is also of great practical importance for crop improvement because wild germplasm
represents a rich potential source of useful under-exploited alleles or allele combinations. The aim of the present
study was to analyse a major Pisum germplasm collection to gain a broad understanding of the diversity and
evolution of Pisum and provide a new rational framework for designing germplasm core collections of the genus.
Results: 3020 Pisum germplasm samples from the John Innes Pisum germplasm collection were genotyped for 45
retrotransposon based insertion polymorphism (RBIP) markers by the Tagged Array Marker (TAM) method. The data
set was stored in a purpose-built Germinate relational database and analysed by both principal coordinate analysis
and a nested application of the Structure program which yielded substantially similar but complementary views of
the diversity of the genus Pisum. Structure revealed three Groups (1-3) corresponding approximately to landrace,
cultivar and wild Pisum respectively, which were resolved by nested Structure analysis into 14 Sub-Groups, many of
which correlate with taxonomic sub-divisions of Pisum, domestication related phenotypic traits and/or restricted
geographical locations. Genetic distances calculated between these Sub-Groups are broadly supported by principal
coordinate analysis and these, together with the trait and geographical data, were used to infer a detailed model
for the domestication of Pisum.
Conclusions: These data provide a clear picture of the major distinct gene pools into which the genus Pisum is
partitioned and their geographical distribution. The data strongly support the model of independent
domestications for P. sativum ssp abyssinicum and P. sativum. The relationships between these two cultivated
germplasms and the various sub-divisions of wild Pisum have been clarified and the most likely ancestral wild gene
pools for domesticated P. sativum identified. Lastly, this study provides a framework for defining global Pisum
germplasm which will be useful for designing core collections.

Background
The genetic diversity of a species is the outcome of
cumulative mutation, recombination and selection on
individuals by the environment. Plant and animal species important in agriculture have been additionally subjected to thousands of years of selection and breeding
for traits desirable for cultivation or consumption by
people or domesticated animals. Initially, wild plants
carrying promising traits for cultivation were selected,
leading eventually to locally adapted landraces that had
lost many allele combinations that were disadvantageous
to the farmer such as dehiscent pods and thick testas
and gained useful ones such as increased seed size [1].
Modern breeding has largely continued this process by
crossing the ‘best with the best’ and the increases in
yield and performance are still being maintained today.
This strong selection has narrowed the genetic diversity
of cultivated germplasm for at least some species [2].
Wild relatives of many crop plant species are still
extant in their natural habitat. Understanding the
detailed relationships between the genomes of modern
cultivars, old cultivated landraces, ecotypes and wild
relatives is intrinsically interesting as it reflects the
effects of human intervention upon both cultivated and
wild germplasm, the geographical dimension to species
diversity and the process of domestication of wild
organisms. This information is of great interest to those
studying and preserving biodiversity and it provides new
paradigms against which existing data sets and theories
can be viewed. These issues are also of great practical
importance because wild germplasm carries a wide
diversity of alleles that represent a rich potential source
of new alleles or allele combinations for crop
improvement.
Assessment of the genetic diversity within crop species
is typically performed by marker genotyping of samples
selected from gene banks (germplasm collections). Until
recently, marker technologies were unable to deal effectively with the very large sample numbers contained in
such collections. Therefore, most genotypic analyses
have been confined to subsets of germplasm collections
that have been selected to represent the broader collections. The effectiveness of this approach depends upon
the criteria used for selecting germplasm subsets. In the
absence of molecular marker data, these have typically
been based on morphology or ecogeography and have
likely misrepresented the diversity contained within the
collection. Fortunately, the advent of high throughput
genotyping technologies has made the description of the
genetic diversity of complete germplasm collections a
feasible proposition. This raises the possibility of defining a large proportion of the complete diversity of the
corresponding species.

Field pea (Pisum sativum) derives from the Middle
East and was first cultivated roughly 10,000 years ago
[3-5]. Cultivated Pisum is dominated by P. sativum, but
P. sativum ssp abyssinicum (here referred to as P. abyssinicum) is an independently derived cultivated type
[6,7]. Pisum sativum is widespread across the Middle
East and has affinity with the wild P. elatius while P.
abyssinicum is restricted to highland regions of Ethiopia
and Southern Yemen and shows a greater affinity to P.
fulvum [6]. P. elatius (taken to include other minor
taxa) is distributed widely across the Mediterranean
basin from Spain to the Middle East, while P. fulvum is
found around its eastern edge (Syria, Lebanon, Israel,
Palestine and Jordan) although herbarium specimens are
known from Cyprus, Greece, Iraq, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia [8]. Pisum is perhaps best considered as
a species complex with multiple sub-species which
interbreed to different degrees [6]. In support of this,
there is extensive sharing of retrotransposon markers
between all Pisum species [6], suggesting that there has
been significant outcrossing and introgression between
them, despite the predominantly inbreeding nature of
the genus (greater than 99%), which reduces gene flow.
Most wide crosses within Pisum are fertile, except for
crosses involving P. fulvum. P. fulvum also forms a distinct clade in all molecular diversity analyses [[6] and
references therein] and is the only realistic candidate in
the genus for a distinct species. P. sativum is nested
within the diversity of P. elatius in most molecular analyses and may even be paraphyletic [6,7,9], suggesting
that cultivated P. sativum derived mainly from the latter
species. Other claimed wild species, such as P. humile
and P. jomardii have little support from molecular studies. P. abyssinicum has been considered to be a subspecies of P. sativum [discussed in [6]] but it shares several
characteristic phenotypic traits and a significant proportion of molecular marker alleles with P. fulvum and
tends to sit between the latter and P. elatius in molecular diversity plots [6,10]. Microsatellite-based marker
analysis suggests that Chinese Pisum germplasm is
rather distinct from the global gene pool and includes
several rare alleles [11,12]. Based upon these data a Chinese P. sativum core collection has been proposed [12].
The John Innes (JI) Pisum Collection [13] currently
comprises 3512 accessions, representing 1200 P. sativum
cultivars, 600 traditional landraces and 750 wild Pisum
samples (mainly P. sativum, P. fulvum and P elatius),
together with genetic stocks and reference lines from
other collections. This constitutes perhaps the widest
and most comprehensive set of Pisum germplasm
worldwide. Initially formed to support a range of pea
research and a breeding programme, the collection has
continually sought to draw together the broadest range

Jing et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/44

of cultivated forms from both cultivated genepools and
wild and weedy forms. Significant numbers of accessions
are the result of expeditions including those to the primary centre of diversity in the Middle East and important secondary centres in the highland regions of
Ethiopia and Asiatic regions including the Hindu Kush
[14]. This has made it an excellent candidate resource
for studying the full diversity of the genus Pisum and
this is the main reason it was selected for this study.
The retrotransposon markers used in the above studies are mainly based upon insertions of the PDR1 Ty1copia group retrotransposon, visualized by the
Sequence-Specific Amplification Polymorphisms (SSAP)
technique [6]. SSAP is a useful method for scoring
diversity in relatively small sample sets (up to roughly
50 samples corresponding to a single gel assay) but, like
all gel-based marker approaches, has problems dealing
with large sample numbers owing to problems relating
the results (band sharing) from one gel to the next.
Furthermore, SSAP markers are dominant, thus band
absence can mean either PCR failure or absence of the
insertion. Therefore, to genotype thousands of samples
we developed the Retrotransposon-Based Insertion Polymorphism (RBIP) method [15]. RBIP uses simple PCRbased detection of the presence or absence of single
transposon insertions by combining two primers flanking the insertion site with a single outward-priming
transposon-specific primer [15-17,19,20]. RBIP has been
used to deduce the insertional polymorphisms of retrotransposons in diverse rice varieties, providing evidence
for independent domestication events for indica and
japonica rice [20].
One concern when using retrotransposon markers is
the possibility of non-random chromosomal distributions due to insertion site preference or selection against
insertions at specific locations, which can for example
lead to strong clustering in centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin. Such non-random distributions
can differ between different elements and/or species and
might distort inferred genetic relationships. Fortunately,
Jing et al. [19] showed that, for PDR1, the element upon
which the bulk of the RBIP markers analysed were
based, the sequence specificity of insertion sites is very
relaxed, and slightly more insertions than expected are
associated with genic sequences. Furthermore, genetic
mapping of PDR1 insertion sites [21] showed no marked
clustering of polymorphic PDR1 insertion sites. Therefore, PDR1-based RBIP markers should be excellent for
assessing genetic diversity in Pisum.
For high throughput analysis RBIP amplicons can be
scored by the Tagged Microarray Marker (TAM) format, which is based upon fluorescent microarray marker
scoring [16,17]. RBIP-TAM yields codominant marker
scores which are particularly relevant for studying

diversity at the genus level because they mutate at
around the 10-6 year level [19], which gives them high
polymorphism relative to SNPs and homoplasy is not an
issue because retrotransposon insertions are effectively
irreversible. SNPs are also useful markers for diversity
analyses but require investment in SNP discovery and
the setup of a corresponding genotyping platform.
The aims of the present study were; i) To analyse the
genetic diversity of virtually the complete JI Pisum Collection using RBIP TAM marker technology; ii) To gain
a broad understanding of the relationships between wild
and cultivated Pisum germplasm and the link between
genetic diversity and geographical distribution of Pisum;
iii) To make the marker and accession data freely available via a web-accessible relational database; iv) To create a diversity framework to aid the rational design of a
global Pisum germplasm collection.

Methods
Plant Materials and DNA extraction

3020 accessions comprising 92% of the complete JI
Pisum Collection at the time of sampling, together with
208 lines from a private breeding program and 35 lines
in the process of inclusion included in the genebank
were selected for analysis (Additional file 1) [13]. The
only significant omissions from the Collection were
three mapping populations comprising recombinant
inbred lines prepared from JI accessions JI399 and JI15
or JI281 and JI 15 and JI 1194. All segregating RBIP
markers were separately mapped in these populations
(data not shown). Individual plants were grown on after
tissue sampling for DNA preparation, selfed and seed
was collected from the majority of lines to form an
independent resource linked to the marker database.
These lines and all germplasm maintained at the John
Innes Pisum germplasm collection are freely available
from the Genetic Resources Unit of the John Innes Centre [18]. DNAs were extracted by the Qiagen DNeasy 96
method.
RBIP marker analysis

RBIP reactions, based on 78 polymorphic LTR retrotransposon insertions [19] and two small indel polymorphisms flanking the 261 × 1 and 2055nr53
insertions respectively, were carried out as described
[17]. Briefly, PCRs were carried out in 384 well format
with three primers, a common biotinylated primer
which amplifies both occupied and unoccupied alleles,
plus two allele-specific primers for the occupied and
unoccupied alleles respectively, carrying tags allowing
detection with fluorescently labelled tag detector probes
(see below). All PCR reactions used Qiagen HotStar Taq
DNA polymerase, Qiagen reaction buffer, 0.25 μM each
oligonucleotide [17] and 200 μM dNTPs. High

throughput PCRs were set up manually by multi-channel pipette (Finnpipette) and were on a 10 μl (occasional) or 5 μl (typical) scale in a Tetrad instrument
(Bio-Rad), fitted with 4 × 384 well blocks, using 6 ng of
template DNA. Cycling conditions for retrotransposonbased PCRs were typically 95°C 15 minutes (heat-activation of enzyme), followed by 40 cycles of 94°C, 55°C, 72°
C, all for 1 minute, with a final elongation step of 72°C
for 7 min. Exceptions to the above 55°C annealing temperature were as follows; 2055 × 36 (57°C), 2055nr16
(60°C), 2055nr23 (60°C), 1006nr27, (58°C), 1006nr32
(60°C), 45 × 31 (60°C), 45 × 33 (60°C), 45 × 8 (60°C),
2539 × 7 (57°C), 3150 × 11 (60°C), MKRBIP2 (54°C),
MKRBIP3 (54°C), MKRBIP4 (54°C), MKRBIP7 (54°C).
TAM microarray-based marker analysis

The method used is described in detail in [17]. Briefly,
PCR products were spotted directly from PCR plates

Page 4 of 20

without purification onto a streptavidin-coated microarray slide (made by us) which was pre-hybridised then
hybridised with a mixture of two detector probes, carrying corresponding fluorescent labels (Cy3 or Cy5). The
slides were washed to remove unbound probe and
scanned using an ArrayWorx™ Biochip Reader. Representative images are shown in Figure 1 and the full set
of images are available in Additional file 2 and from the
Germinate pea database (Additional file 3) [22,23].
Marker data acquisition and quality control

Collected pixel data for each microarray obtained from
the array reader were converted into spot pixel intensities using the manufacturer’s software and exported to
excel spreadsheets. Spot signal intensities were corrected
for local backgrounds (both Cy3 and Cy5) then corrected intensities for each spot were normalised against
each other using the strongest reliable spot signals for

Figure 1 Examples of TAM arrays for RBIP markers scored in the JIC Pisum Collection. Each array scores a single retrotransposon insertion
polymorphism in 3029 Pisum DNAs. Markers illustrated [19] are as follows: A, UniTpv; B, 281 × 44; C, 1794-2; D, 95 × 25; E, Birte-x34; F, 64 × 11.
The arrays also contain 672 blank spots (no sample arrayed) 128 positive controls 9 DNA duplicates and 42 PCR negative controls (mock DNA
preparation with no input plant sample).

Jing et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:44

each dye in each array. No-score cut-offs for weak spots
were obtained by comparing background-corrected signals for each fluorochrome with visual inspection of the
corresponding array image. Any corrected signals falling
below the cut-off threshold (typically, fluorescence
values less than twice the local background) were set to
zero, giving final corrected signals for each fluorochrome for each spot. Final sample scores were obtained
by calculating ratios between these two final signals for
the corresponding spots. Typically, spots below the cutoff in both channels were given no-score, spots with
Cy3/Cy5 ratios greater than 3 were scored as Cy3,
scores with ratios between 0.3 and 3 were scored as
mixed (Cy3 + Cy5) and scores with Cy3/Cy5 ratios
below 0.3 were scored as Cy5. For some RBIP markers
these scoring parameters were adjusted to fit obvious
groupings of germplasm subsets in the plotted fluorescence intensities [see individual marker plotted scores in
the Germinate database; [22,23] and in a few cases parallel gel-based scoring of the PCR products were used to
‘train’ the above scoring parameters (see below). Finally,
Cy scores were converted to allele scores (unoccupied/
occupied/mixed/no score), depending upon the fluorescent tag detectors used in the assay [17].
Preliminary inspection of the 80 marker arrays showed
29 markers of very good quality (e.g. Figure 1A-C). We
also found 15 markers of very poor quality, for example
some had missing data of around 50% or more (e.g. Figure 1E) or were virtually mono-allelic in the entire
population (e.g. Additional file 2, marker 261 × 1).
These markers were discarded, leaving 36 remaining
markers to be scrutinised. Many of these showed large
numbers of mixed fluorescence signals (e.g. Figure 1D,
1F). The plants used for these studies were all homozygous (see Introduction and Plant Materials and DNA
extraction above) and high levels of mixed spots implied
that more than one locus being sampled by the TAM
assay [16,17,19]. Therefore, all 36 remaining markers
were tested by agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR
products (RBIP amplicons are designed to show size
polymorphism). 16 of these markers gave very good correlation between gel bands and corresponding spot
fluorescence and were added to the 29 already accepted,
resulting in 45 markers accepted for downstream data
analysis (Table 1).
Scoring reproducibility between arrays was explored
for four randomly selected markers (Birte-x16, 45 × 31,
2055nr1 and 281 × 16, data not shown). Reproducibility
of Cy3 and Cy5 scores for the same set of PCRs arrayed
onto different slides was high (89% and 98% respectively) and scoring reproducibility between different
PCRs using the same samples was lower (64% and 85%
respectively). The great majority of these discrepancies
between scores corresponded to no scores in one of the

Page 5 of 20

arrays (38%; SD 9% and 17% SD 5% respectively). In
many cases this corresponded with poor spotting efficiency of particular spotting pins (Additional file 2).
This interpretation was supported by comparisons
between gel and array scores (161 scores per marker)
for each of 7 other accepted markers and all 3029 scores
for Birte-x16. These showed false negative rates (array
no-score/gel score) of between 0 and 0.24 per marker
and false positive rates (array score/gel no-score) of
between between 0 and 0.12 per marker for the 7 markers. For Birte-x16 95% of the TAM no-score samples
gave scores by gel, confirming the above interpretation.
Therefore, all the above discrepancies between scores
and no-scores were resolved in favour of scores for all
repeated arrays. Discrepancies between occupied scores
in one array and unoccupied in another was extremely
low (average 0.13%; SD 0.08%). Lastly, the reproducibility of mixed scores (’yellow spots’) between arrays was
poor (25% and 22% within the same PCRs and between
different PCRs respectively).
The inclusion of 9 duplicated samples (see above)
allowed us to test scoring reproducibility further. In
general the score data for these 9 duplicate pairs were
very similar to the above data for repeat PCRs, with noscores for a single sample casuing almost all discrepancies (data not shown).
Data storage and visualization

All marker allele scores, together with original array
images, passport data and other descriptive data for the
Pisum accessions in this study were stored in an openaccess relational database built using the Germinate
Open Source Platform [22,23]. All marker data in this
study can be freely browsed at the Germinate-Pea database [23] or obtained as an excel file from AJF. The
Germinate database (Additional file 3) [23] was re-written in MySQL to remove the limitations imposed by
reliance on PostgreSQL and to cater for the larger number of end users working in this area who are familiar
with MySQL.
Germinate-Pea is equipped with a Perl web-interface
and tools and administration tools written in Perl to aid
users in configuring and maintaining data and Germinate’s installation features. The interface allows browsing
and string searching of all data (for example, to find
information on a single accession, linked where applicable to geographical map information; Additional file
4A). A Group facility allows storable, password-protected
grouping of analysis outputs and groups can be merged,
subtracted, overlapped etc. Data subsets (accession, marker or marker × accession) are retrievable and any data
(sub)set is exportable as tab-delimited text and/or kml
file for downstream analysis or visualization (e.g. for
spreadsheet or Google Earth respectively). Original array

The origin accession for each RBIP marker is given typically by the first number in the RBIP designation (ie marker 45 × 8 derived from JI45). Exceptions to this
rule are MKRBIPs (which derived from mapping populations between accessions JI15, JI281 and JI399), Birte markers which derived from JI1068 [cv Birte] and UniTpv which derived from cultivar Therese (not in the JI Collection).

Phylogenetic and genetic diversity analysis

All final marker score data were combined into an excel
spreadsheet. ‘Yellow spots’ (samples scoring both occupied and unoccupied for a given marker) were treated
as missing data. Analyses were performed using the
DARwin5 package [25,6] and STRUCTURE [27,28].
Structure (v2.1) accepted the entire data set without
further assumptions about the nature of missing data.
Individuals were considered to be homozygous for all
loci as the DNA preps were from a single leaflet of a
single inbred accession. Structure parameters discussed
in the text follow the definitions of Pritchard et al. [27]
and Evanno et al. [29] thus: K = The number of proposed ancestral populations. K is user defined and we
have analysed values between 2 and 21. Q = The

representation of a given ancestral population in an
accession. Structure attempts to describe the representation of more remote ancestors, that themselves have
various degrees of relationship, the values of Q can
range widely. Note that two individuals with identical
values of Q for a series of proposed ancestors, need not
necessarily carry an identical set of alleles.
For Structure the default parameter set was used
throughout, using the admixture model, but the effect of
run length was investigated. Most runs comprised
10,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs after
a ‘burn-in’ of 10,000. These runs were replicated ten
times for each K and each data set or subset analysed
and were compared to runs comprising 800,000 MCMC
runs after a ‘burn-in’ of 200,000. The replicated shorter
runs gave similar results so these were used because
their duration was substantially shorter. Values of K to
explore were chosen according to [29] calculated in
Excel tables. Correlation analysis of the assignments of
Q between different populations for accessions in

Jing et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/44

different runs was performed using GenStat [30].
Genetic distances between Structure Sub-Groups were
calculated according to Nei’s method using ‘Genedist’ in
the Phylip package [31,32] and the resulting tree was
plotted using DARwin5 [26]. Factorial analysis of the
data was calculated by a simple match of shared alleles
for all pairs of accessions. The proportion of shared alleleles for each accession pair was calculated using a simple BASIC program (available on request).

If the founder populations had differing degrees of
relatedness some may be ‘found’ more easily by Structure than others, and closely related populations may be
compounded in different permutations by different
Structure runs. This suggests that a hierarchical
approach to partitioning populations may be fruitful
because the problem of identifying parental populations
is simplified if we take a restricted germplasm set.
Neighbor joining tree analysis

Robustness of Structure descriptions

A Structure description can be considered robust if it is
obtained from multiple independent runs of the program. In practice independent runs for our large data
sets were never identical, but the assignments of ancestry were broadly similar for ‘well correlated’ runs. We
assessed this robustness by determining the correlation
between assignments of Q for each run. For a structure
run ‘S’, with K populations, we can call this value QSK.
For K = 2, in a given run (G) an individual accession
has two values of Q: QG1 and QG2.
We therefore have four possible correlations between
the population assignments for all accessions: RQG1QG1,
RQG2QG2, RQG1QG2 and RQG2QG1. As any value is identical to itself RQG1QG1 = 1 and RQG2QG2 = 1, and as QG1 +
QG2 = 1 it follows that RQG1QG2 = -1 and RQG2QG1 = -1.
The sum of these correlations is therefore zero.
If we compared two different K = 2 runs (A and B) we
could decide whether the assigned parental populations
were or were not the same by looking at the correlations
RQA1QB1, RQA1QB2, RQA2QB1, RQA2QB2. If the assignments
were identical we would again have two values of 1 and
two of -1. Comparing the sums is not informative,
because they are zero, but comparing the sums of the
positive correlations immediately identifies corresponding proposed parental populations. High positive correlations suggest that the proposed parental populations
are very similar.
Thus if a pair of Structure runs has a high sum of positive correlations between proposed partitioning of parental populations then they are proposing essentially the
same parental populations and the same partitioning of
their variation among the sampled accessions. Thus the
sum of their positive correlations can be regarded as a
measure of robustness, and in general can be compared
for different values of K if divided by the sum of the two
K values being compared. This can hold for runs with
different values of K, where a single population in the
lower K value may be partitioned simply into several
populations at higher K. Note that two runs may propose
one or a few parental populations that are similar and
others that are different. This means that although a run
may not propose all the same parental populations it may
propose a subset in a consistent manner.

Structure analyses assigned the ancestry of individuals
among three population Groups. Individuals with at
least 50% of their genome assigned to Group 1, 2 or 3
were further assigned by subsequent Structure analysis
to six, two or six Sub-Groups respectively. The relationship between these populations of accessions was then
described by the allele frequency between the SubGroups. For each Sub-Group the frequency of empty
sites was counted and represented as a fraction of
empty plus occupied sites. A matrix of this fraction, for
each marker and assigned Sub-Group, was then used to
generate a distance matrix between the Sub-Groups corresponding to a population using the GENEDIST program in the Phylip package (http://evolution.genetics.
washington.edu/phylip.html, [30,31]), assuming one
allele omitted and using Nei’s genetic distance. The
resulting distance matrix was used to construct a neighbor joining tree using the Neighbor program of the
same package. The resulting tree therefore represents
the relationship between the collections of accessions
proposed by Structure, assuming that these accession
sets were real populations. Note that the relationship
between these sets of accessions is not the same as the
relationship between the proposed ancestral populations
(as described in the Structure output files), but is a
description of this way of partitioning the existing germplasm collection.
Cluster analysis

Multivariate statistical approaches can condense the
description of the relationships between multiple individuals. We used the DARwin5 program [24,25] to undertake a factorial analysis of the marker data for the whole
set of accessions. This represents the total variance of
the inter-accession distances in 3028 dimensions, and
the first two dimensions (comprising 5.32% and 2.99%
of the total variation respectively) were used to display
the relationship between individuals.

Results
RBIP marker scoring of the John Innes Pisum Collection

The objective of this study was to determine the genetic
structure of a large, complete and diverse Pisum germplasm collection. The John Innes Pisum Collection, is

Jing et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/44

widely used as a source of pea germplasm with a particularly good representation. At the time of sampling in
2003, the collection comprised wild (407), landrace
(564), breeders’ lines (61), cultivated (1021) and mutation stocks and research lines (835) accessions. A good
body of the wild and landrace accessions had associated
geographical data. DNAs were prepared from 2776 of
the 2888 accessions sampled, together with 208 private
lines, 36 lines not yet included in the collection and 9
duplicates, corresponding to 3029 samples in total. The
marker technology used was the TAM approach [16,17]
which allows high throughput codominant scoring of
polymorphic transposon insertions by microarray or gel
electrophoresis. 78 RBIP markers [19], plus 2 adjacent
short indel markers were available to us. These markers
were all scored in the 3029 samples, representative
examples of TAM arrays are shown in Figure 1. Careful
scrutiny of these arrays and comparison with parallel
gel-based assays of subsets of the PCR products resulted
in the rejection of 35 of these markers (see Materials
and Methods), leaving 45 useful marker score sets carried forward for the study. The 80 array images are all
shown in Additional file 2 and the complete molecular
data set and associated images for the 45 markers and
all available passport and descriptive data for the accessions are available at the Germinate Pea database (Materials and Methods; Additional file 3) [23].
Bayesian analysis of population structure for the JI Pisum
Collection

The marker data set comprised 40,790 alleles called as
occupied sites (insertion present)), 65,566 unoccupied

Page 9 of 20

sites (insertion absent) and 29,949 missing data points
(no detected PCR product or both occupied and unoccupied sites together). We explored the diversity of this
data set using the program Structure [27,28,33]. Structure uses a Bayesian approach to allocate proportions
(Q) of K presumed ancestral populations contributing to
each sample (see Materials and Methods). Individuals
may be assigned as the descendant of one population or
having an admixture of two or more presumed ancestral
populations. K is an important parameter which shapes
the subsequent inferred sub-division of genetic structure, although it is a summary and convenience rather
than a strictly defined hypothesis about the origin of a
given set of individuals. In practice multiple K values
are explored and the value accepted is usually that
which gives the maximum value of the likelihood of the
data, ln(pr(Data|K)).
In this study we explored K between 2 and 21 inclusive, with ten independent assessments of the log likelihood of the data made for each K value. For our
analysis the log likelihood does not reach a clear maximum (Figure 2A). This phenomenon has been seen in
other studies [e.g. [34]] and reflects heterogeneity
between simulations in the distribution of ancestry proportions from the progenitor populations. One proposed
solution to this problem is to use maxima in the second
derivative (ΔK) of the relationship between K and the
log-likelihood as an appropriate way of selecting K, thus
effectively looking for ‘shoulder’ in the first plot (Figure
2B) [29]. Several possible values of K were indicated by
this method but the maxima tended to be less reliable
between runs at higher K values. Simulations at K = 3, 7

is plotted against K for 10 simulations with a burn-in of 10,000 runs followed by 10,000 MCMC runs. The error bars show the standard
deviations of the mean values. B. Estimates of the rate of change of the slope of the log likelihood curve (ΔK) calculated according to [29] are
plotted against K. K values of 3, 7 and 11 giving robust ΔK maxima were investigated further.

and 11 in Figure 2a were examined for internal consistency both graphically and by correlation analysis.
Examples of this are shown in Figure 3 and all the simulations and correlations for these K values are shown in
Supplementary Figures 3 and 4. While there are some
reasonably robust Sub-Groups identified within the K =
7 Structure runs, the K = 3 simulations are the most
consistent by far between runs (Figure 3, Additional file
5) and we propose that this value represents the most
robust division for the data set and the start point for

Page 10 of 20

exploring the diversity of the JIC Pisum germplasm. The
grouping of the data into essentially these three populations was also seen when using 27 of these marker loci
(data not shown), suggesting that the relationships this
implies are a robust feature of the data set.
The relationships between a single pair of K = 3 and
K = 7 Sub-Groups are shown for illustration in Additional file 5. The K = 7 grouping is less reproducible
than that for K = 3 so the former data are ordered by
the average of the 3 most consistent runs and there are

Figure 3 Structure analysis of the JIC Pisum Collection: Comparing different K values. The results of three Structure runs for K values of 3,
7 and 11 are shown, together with the means for 10 K = 3 runs and the 3 most reproducible K = 7 runs. For each run the fractional inferred
ancestry of the 3029 individuals is plotted as a histogram, with each ancestral population colour-coded. Accessions are assigned to Sub-Group N
if their average representation (QN) for that Sub-Group ≥ 0.5. Accessions in Groups 1 and 2 are ordered by decreasing Q and for group 3 by
increasing Q. Admixtured accessions, where Q1+Q2 ≥ 0.5, are placed between groups 2 and 3, ordered by increasing Q3. For K = 7 the
accessions are ordered within Sub-Groups in a similar way. For K = 11 there was no consistent assignment between Structure runs of accessions
to groups; therefore the accession order is the same as for K = 3 (see also Additional file 4). At the bottom of the K = 3 figure the fraction of
missing data per accession is plotted as a black vertical bar.

Jing et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:44

many admixed accessions in the former run with no
dominant progenitor and consequently no Sub-Group
assignation (top sectors of 3C). The K = 3 Group 1
(red) corresponds to three K = 7 Groups plus the K = 7
unassigned subset (top of the Figure), The second K = 3
Group (green) corresponds quite closely to two other K
= 7 Groups and the third K = 3 Group (blue) corresponds closely to a single K = 7 Group. It therefore
seems that higher K values provide some credible subpartitioning of the K = 3 groupings but at the cost of
reduced reproducibility.
The distribution of missing data relative to the K = 3
Structure Groups is shown in Figure 3. The average
fraction of missing data in each K = 3 group is 0.206 ±
0.003 for Group 1 (red), 0.219 ± 0.004 for Group 2

Page 11 of 20

(green), 0.279 ± 0.007 for Group 3 (blue) and 0.246 ±
0.016 for the admixed accessions. The slight excess of
missing data for Group 3 is significant (p < 0.001). This
is a predominantly wild Group which contains a large
fraction of the total genetic diversity of the entire population (see below) and we suggest that the elevated fraction of missing data is mainly due to PCR failure at
mutated priming sites.
Investigation of sub-structuring of Pisum diversity

The results of Structure analysis using higher K values
described above suggested extra sub-structuring of the
diversity above that of K = 3. Therefore, each of the
three K = 3 sample sets were treated individually to
further Structure analysis (Figure 4). Analysis of the

relationships between K and ΔK for these data sets (data
not shown) suggested that K = 6 would be a helpful
descriptors for Group 1, K = 2 was indicated for Group
2 and K = 6 for Group 3 (data not shown). Sub-groups
generated by Structure runs using these K values are
shown in Figure 4A and 4F, together with taxonomic
assignment (Figure 4B, 4G; Additional file 6), and
domestication-related trait parameters of accessions
(Figure 4C-E; 4H-I).
Group 1 is dominated by P sativum (Figure 4B) and is
comprised of a mixture of landraces and cultivars (Figure
4B-C), the great majority of which have round seed phenotypes (orange in Figure 4D). Sub-Group 1.1 contains a
high proportion of large seed lines (Figure 4E) but there
is little obvious partitioning of seed shape or size between
the other Group 1 Sub-Groups. Group 2 is dominated by
P. sativum cultivars (Figure 4B-C) and contains the bulk
of the wrinkled seeded types (Figure 4D; note these
include, but are not limited to, mutants at the various
rugosus loci), with again no obvious partitioning by
wrinkled phenotype between to the two Sub-Groups.
There is a larger proportion of cultivars in Sub-Group
2.2 relative to 2.1 (c2 = 32, p < 0.001) and this is reflected
in 6% greater mean seed size for Sub-Group 2.2 relative
to Sub-Group 2.1 (Figure 4E, data not shown). In summary, there is some credible segregation for taxonomy,
cultivar and seed parameters among some of the SubGroups of Groups 1 and 2 but this is not dramatic.
In contrast to the first two Groups, Group 3 displays a
considerable amount of sub-structuring, with regard to
both taxonomy and phenotypic traits (Figure 4F-I; Additional file 6). Sub-Group 3.1 contains almost all P. abyssinicum accessions, Sub-Group 3.2 contains about one
third of the P. elatius lines and Sub-Group 3.6 contains
96% of the P. fulvum accessions (Figure 4G). SubGroups 3.3-3.5 are mostly P. sativum landraces (Figure
4C, 4G) and 3.3 is characterised by the presence of the
‘c.v. Afghanistan’ types [35] that carry the sym2 allele
conferring resistance to nodulation by European Rhizobium strains (Figure 4H). Lastly, most of Group 3 has
small seed size, with the notable exceptions of SubGroup 3.1 (cultivated P. abyssinicum) and a fraction of
Sub-Group 3.5 derived mainly from Afghanistan and
India (data not shown). We will show below that much
of this sub-structuring of Group 3 is also reflected at
the geographical level.
The above data suggest that the Sub-Groupings identified by Structure for Groups 1 and 2 are supported to
some extent by prior phenotypic or taxonomic data and
the sub-structuring of the wild-dominated Pisum Group
3 makes very good sense in these contexts. To assess to
what degree these Groups and Sub-Groups are supported by previous analysis, we investigated the concordance between Structure grouping and the

Page 12 of 20

corresponding gene sequence-based tree structure for a
set of 45 well studied JIC Collection accessions [10]
(Figure 5). 15 of these accessions belong to Group 1, 6
to Group 2, 23 to Group 3 and 1 is unassigned. All
Group 1 and 2 accessions are located in the bottom
two-thirds of the tree and the internal branch lengths in
this sector are typically short; these branching patterns
are poorly supported [10]. Five of the six Group 2 accessions are confined to two weakly supported clades
towards the bottom of the tree, with the sixth nearby.
Somewhat surprisingly, six Group 3 samples, which constitute all of the accessions sampled here from SubGroups 3.4 and 3.5, plus one unassigned accession,
occupy two weakly supported and quite distantly separated clades in the lower region of the tree. There is no
obvious correlation between the 3.4/3.5 division and
assignment to these clades. Also, each clade contains
one or two samples from Sub-Group1. The rest of
Group 3 (17 out of 23 accessions) constitutes the
entirety of the two most strongly supported clades in
the tree, one nested within the other, towards the top of
the tree. The nested clade comprises all 10 P. fulvum
samples and all belong to Sub-Group 3.6. Additionally,
all 4 samples from Sub-groups 3.1 and 3.2 reside in the
outer clade. We conclude from this comparison that; i)
Much of the Sub-structuring identified in Group 3 is
broadly supported by sequence-based diversity assessment of a small representative subset of the samples but
Sub-Groups 3.4 and 3.5 are distributed differently by the
two diversity approaches. ii) There is little agreement
apparent between the Sub-Grouping of Groups 1 and 2
and the corresponding sequence-derived tree structure.
Distance-based estimations of the relationships among
Structure Sub-Groups

The above data show that Pisum genetic diversity is well
described by three major groupings, which very broadly
correspond to P. sativum landraces, P. sativum cultivars
and wild samples respectively, with various Sub-Groupings of these supported to a greater or lesser extent by
taxonomy, trait data or corresponding sequence-based
tree structure. This description gives no direct idea of
the genetic distances between these groupings or their
phylogenetic relationships. It is possible to obtain this
by comparing the marker allele frequencies between
Sub-Groups, thus treating each Sub-Group as a genetic
unit. The deduced tree from this analysis is shown in
Figure 6. Most of the genetic divergence between these
sub-groups of accessions is within Structure Group 3
(blue branches), and the sub-groups within Groups 1
and 2 are very poorly resolved. This suggests that relatively little marker information is available to define the
sub-grouping within Groups 1 and 2, consistent with
the weaker support for these subgroups described above.

Figure 5 Relationships between RBIP-based Structure Sub-Grouping and sequence-based tree structure. Accessions assigned to Subgroups of the three K = 3 Groups (see Figure 4) are shown on a previous neighbour joining tree based on intron sequence [adapted from [17]].
Subgroup assignments are indicated by box fill colours, Group assignments are shown by box outline colours and taxonomic (species/subspecies) assignments by colour coded text, using colours from Figure 4. ‘Unassigned’ Subgroups U, 1.U and 3.U (white boxes) are comprised of
accessions with no founder genotypic contribution of 50% or more in the corresponding Structure run. Subgroups not represented in the tree
(Subgroups 1.1, 1.6 and 3.3) are unboxed.

Interestingly, Sub-Groups 3.4 and 3.5 are the nearest
neighbours to Groups 1 and 2 and these also cluster in
the sequence-based tree (Figure 5). Both 3.4 and 3.5 are
dominated by non-adapted P. sativum (Additional file
2). We will return to these points later when discussing
models of P. sativum domestication. Sub-Group 3.3,
corresponding to the Afghan class of P. sativum, is an
outlier to Sub-Group 3.4. Finally, Sub-Groups 3.2 and
3.6, which are dominated respectively by the wild species P. elatius and P. fulvum (Additional file 6), are
remote from P. sativum, with the P. abyssinicum dominated Sub-Group 3.1 roughly equidistant between them,
in agreement with previously derived relationships based
upon other marker types [6,10].
We also used multi-factorial analysis of the marker
data set to analyse the diversity of the Pisum germplasm
(Figure 7). The results in general support the above
findings for the relationships between the Sub-Groups
and they also show both the diversity within SubGroups and the extent to which the Sub-Groups overlap. The area occupied by a germplasm sub-set relative
to the total area occupied in the multi-factorial plot
gives a measure of its contribution to the overall diversity of the complete set. This can be expressed as the
product of the standard deviation of the X and Y values

for the individuals in the sub-set. For Groups 1-3 these
values correspond to 12.5%, 15.6% and 71.9% of the
total respectively (Figure 7; data not shown). Thus,
Group 3 represents most of the variation of Pisum as a
whole, assuming that the JI Collection is a good representation of the genus, and its Sub-Groups are quite
well resolved, particularly Sub-Group 3.3, with 3.1 and
3.6 also quite distinct. These data are consistent with
the Structure-based tree (Figure 6) and prior analyses
[6]. Group 2 is partially resolved into its two components but Group 1 is very poorly resolved and forms a
large cluster. We conclude that the Group 3 SubGroups largely represent distinct germplasm by multifactorial analysis, the two Sub-Groups of Group 2 are
partially resolved and Group 1 is predominantly homogeneous by this approach.
Relationship between Structure Sub-Group and country
of origin

There is geographical information available for roughly a
third of the accessions in the JIC collection, comprising
the majority of the wild and landrace material. Much of
this information defines a country of origin while exact
collection site location is lacking. Nevertheless, this
allowed us to investigate distribution by country for the

Figure 6 Distance-based estimations for Structure Sub-Groups. A neighbor joining tree of the genetic distance between Sub-Groups was
calculated from the combined allele frequencies per Sub-Group, using Nei’s method [40]. Structure Sub-groups are colour coded as in Figure 4 and
predominant species in each Sub-Group (Additional file 2) are indicated by coloured text using the same species-specific colours as Figure 4.

Sub-Groups in this study (Figure 8). Several clear correlations between Sub-Group and country of origin are
apparent. Firstly, almost all of Sub-Group 1.1 is assigned
to Ethiopia and Spain, with a significant amount of
Dutch material also (data not shown). This is the only
Sub-Group of Group 1 that can be resolved by genetic
distance (Figure 6) and the other Group 1 Sub-Groups
show little bias for country of origin. Second, SubGroup 3.6 (the P. fulvum Sub-Group) is largely confined
to Israel and Syria, as expected from the known geographic origin for the species. Similarly, the P. abyssinicum Sub-Group 3.1 mainly derives from Ethiopia and
the P. elatius Sub-Group 3.2 is distributed across the
Eastern Mediterranean, as expected. The P. sativum
Sub-Groups 3.3-3.5 also show marked concentration to
individual countries or regions, namely Afghanistan,
Nepal and South Central Asia respectively. Both SubGroups of Group 2 (P. sativum cultivars) are poorly
represented in the country assignments and show little
preference for country of origin. We deduce from these
data that the Sub-Groups which are clearly resolved by
marker analysis also show clear bias in region of origin,
whereas poorly resolved Sub-Groups do not.

Discussion
The main goal of this study was to genotype a large
and genetically diverse Pisum germplasm collection
and explore the diversity and evolution of Pisum. We
chose the JIC Pisum germplasm collection because it is
arguably the most complete Pisum collection worldwide, with a particularly good representation of wild
and landrace material. Our analysis shows that the
large majority of the genetic diversity of Pisum resides
in these non-cultivar accessions (Figure 6). It is important to note that this higher diversity is not predominantly due to ‘wild’ alleles which are absent from
cultivated genetic material [2]. In fact, only 13% of
SSAP molecular markers from a diversity collection
comprising 10 P. fulvum 12 P. elatius and 5 P. abyssinicum JIC accessions are absent from 23 diverse P.
sativum lines [[6]; Ellis et al, unpublished]. Thus, introgression across the species and sub-species in the
Pisum species group has distributed alleles widely
across the genus and it is the frequencies of these
alleles in the different sub-populations, more than the
presence of lineage-specific alleles, which are the major
factor in Pisum diversity.

Pisum has relatively poor genomic resources at present and lacks the thousands of gene-linked high
throughput SNP markers that are available for other
cultivated plant species [36,37]. The RBIP markers chosen for this study are particularly useful for assessing
genome diversity and evolution because they are biallelic, codominant and irreversible [15,19,20], but they are
difficult to obtain in large quantities from plants with
large genomes, because most retrotransposon insertions
reside in other repetitious DNA hence the ‘unoccupied’
site may be present at many loci [17,19]. Furthermore,
all PCR-based marker surveys at the genus level suffer
with mutation at priming sites, leading to data loss.
Lastly, retrotransposons are a more mutable genomic
fraction than non-mobile DNA and individual insertions
may be at extremely low allele frequencies, either
because they have arisen relatively recently or have been
nearly lost from the population through segregation
[19]. Collectively, these shortcomings have lead to a
high attrition rate (44%) in our candidate RBIP markers
(Table 1). Nevertheless, the 45 markers scored here in
3029 samples comprise a large data set that has allowed
us to explore the genetic diversity of Pisum to a wider
extent than has been attempted previously.
Analysis of Pisum genetic diversity using
the Structure program

We chose Structure as the main tool for interpreting
these marker data because it can handle very large sample numbers, the derived Q plots give very clear visual
representation of the partitioning of genotype classes
within the germplasm and it tolerates missing data without the need for assumptions about its causes. Our difficulty in obtaining a clear preferred K value has been
seen frequently before [e.g. [28,34]]. We have found that
increasing K values above 6 yields progressively less
credible groups for this data set, even though likelihood
values are still increasing slightly (Figure 2). This conclusion is consistent with that of Pritchard & Wen [28]
that higher K values exaggerate population structure. In
our opinion the approach of Evanno et al [29], which
basically looks for ‘shoulders’ in the slope of K plots is
useful, but care needs to be taken interpreting the ΔK
peaks at higher K values (Figure 2B) because these are
sensitive to the variance in the estimates of the log-likelihood values at K+1.
Because of the difficulties in obtaining a clear K value
we have used a hierarchical approach, starting with a
low, very robust value (K = 3), which reflects major divisions in the germplasm, namely (mainly) landrace, cultivar and wild respectively, then searching for internal
structuring within these groups (see Robustness of Structure descriptions in Materials and Mathods). The rationale for this is in part convenience and in part

biological. All Pisum had a single common ancestor
(K = 1) and is represented in this study by 3020 genotypes (K = 3020), which are known to be distributed
into some major subgroups (P. fulvum for example) or
distinct breeding pools separated by time, geography, or
cultivar type. These various historical processes occurred
at different times and places and may represent quantitatively different numbers of individuals or proportions
of total variation. Therefore, the number of ‘ancestral
populations’ described by Structure is expected to differ
over time, in both number and robustness, so no single
value of K can describe the whole history of Pisum.
The relative success of our hierarchical Structure
approach has varied greatly depending upon the Group
analysed. The landrace-dominated Group 1 contains
only one single well-resolved Sub-Group, namely 1.1
(Figure 6), which is also clearly seen when higher K
values are used (Additional file 7), together with five
other far less credible Sub-Groups. Group 2, which is
mainly comprised of cultivar germplasm, comprises two
poorly resolved Sub-Groups, suggesting little sub-structuring within the cultivated Pisum gene pool. None of
these sub-groupings is well supported by parallel
sequence-based distance tree analysis (Figure 5), though
unfortunately the single example which might have been
(Sub-Group 1.1) has no representatives in this other
study. This is consistent with SNP data for barley cultivars, which cannot clearly resolve divisions beyond winter-spring growth habit (data not shown). Nevertheless
subgroup 2.1 contains identified cultivars at a proportion expected from their distribution in the germplasm
as a whole, while subgroup 2.2 has a significant excess
of identified cultivars (c2 = 32, p < 0.001)
The power of our nested Structure approach becomes
clear when the sub-structuring of Group 3, which
mainly contains wild material, is explored and deep divisions between robust Sub-Groups are revealed (Figure
4). Three of these Sub-Groups correspond largely to
well-defined Pisum species or sub-species (3.1 ≈ P. abyssinicum, 3.2 ≈ P. elatius and 3.6 ≈ P. fulvum). While it
is unsurprising that any method for estimating genetic
diversity reveals deep divisions at this phylogenetic level,
our results highlight the advantage of this hierarchical
Structure approach, because the K = 3 and K = 7 Structure runs did not dissect out these groupings consistently (Figure 3). It thus seems that a large excess of
one germplasm type can confuse analysis by Structure.
Furthermore, the other three Sub-Groups correspond to
clear germplasm sets, each of which shares either phenotypic properties (Sub-Group 3.3; Figure 4H) or geographical range (Sub-Groups 3.3-3.5; Figure 8).
Somewhat surprisingly, only Sub-Group 3.6 (P. fulvum)
has unequivocal support from the DNA sequence-based
distance analysis of a small germplasm subset of the JI

Jing et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/44

Collection (Figure 5) but conversely, Structure has
resolved credible exotic germplasm subsets (Sub-Groups
3.4 and 3.5) which appear by distance tree analysis to be
closer to landrace P. sativum than they are to the wilder
germplasm. We conclude that a hierarchical Structure
approach is a valuable way of dissecting out complex
sub-structuring in germplasm sets which can complement distance-based approaches by revealing extra
diversity information.
The relationship tree derived from comparing allele
frequencies across subgroups (Figure 5) enriches the
Structure-derived conclusions by adding a distance
dimension to the diversity revealed between SubGroups. However, this does not tell us about the differences between individuals within and between subgroups. This is illustrated by a multi-factorial analysis
(Figure 7), which shows that there are differences
between individuals similar in scale to the differences
between Sub-Groups. This pattern is consistent with the
suggestion that Pisum as a whole is a single genetic
entity with varying degrees of sub-division. The first and
second dimensions of this plot shown in Figure 7
describe small components of the total variation (5.32%
and 2.99% respectively), but this is more than 100-fold
greater than the average expectation for the 3028
dimensions overall. Thus Structure appears to be identifying components of the genetic differentiation that are
hard to determine by multivariate statistical approaches,
but which nevertheless correspond to recognisable and
coherent subsets of the gene pool.
Figure 6 and Figure 7 together show clearly that
Groups 1 and 2 together represent a confined subset of
the total diversity of Pisum. The cultivated types are a
major sub-sample of these Groups. Thus, there has
been a bottleneck associated with their derivation but
this has not been severe compared to other species
such as wheat and Brassica. Nonetheless, this emphasises the contrast that can exist between genetic diversity and representation in a germplasm collection - like
almost all crop plant germplasm collections, the JIC collection is mostly made up of cultivated germplasm,
while the smaller number of non-cultivated accessions
represent a disproportionately large amount of the
diversity. This is not surprising as collections often
function as reference points for specific cohorts of
stocks such as mapping populations or released cultivars
from specific countries.
A model for Pisum domestication

The correlations observed here between marker-based
genetic diversity, domestication-related phenotypic traits
and geographical origin reveals new insights into the
origin and evolution of the genus Pisum. At the deepest
level are the two unambiguous wild species P. fulvum

Page 17 of 20

and P. elatius. The former is well resolved by tree drawing methods, Structure analysis, and its limited geographical distribution (Figures 5-8) but P. elatius in
contrast is present in multiple Sub-Groups, particularly
3.2, but also 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5, and is broadly distributed
across the Eastern Mediterranean. P. abyssinicum (SubGroup 3.1), lies between Sub-Groups 3.2 (~P. elatius)
and 3.6 (~P. fulvum) (Figure 8). Vershinin et al. [6] have
suggested that P. abyssinicum may have derived from a
cross between P. fulvum and P. elatius. Our data support this conclusion and suggest a particular subset of
P. elatius germplasm as the specific source for the cross.
This represents a domestication event as P. abyssinicum
is grown as a landrace crop in Ethiopa and nearby countries. The geography of this event is puzzling at first
sight because Sub-Groups 3.2 and 3.6 are apparently
absent from Ethiopia and Sudan (Figure 8). However,
they coexist in the Western half of the Fertile Crescent
(Israel/Jordan/Lebanon/Syria/Southern Turkey) and we
suggest that a hybrid pea sample was collected in this
area and transferred by humans to North East Africa
where it was developed into the modern P. abyssinicum.
This hypothesis is supported by the surprisingly low
diversity of P. abyssinicum in contrast to most landrace
crops [6]. We suggest that the ancestral germplasm of P.
abyssinicum was a small sample, introducing a bottleneck into the diversity of this gene pool that still survives today.
The exact mode of derivation of P. sativum from wild
Pisum is less clear but our data do provide some clues.
The majority of landrace P. sativum is found in Groups
1 and 3, with the apparently more primitive varieties
mainly present in Sub-Groups 3.2-3.5 [35,38,39]. The P.
sativum presumptive sub-species tend to be too poorly
represented in the JI Collection to allow confident SubGroup assignment, with the possible exception of P.
transcaucasicum with 8 accessions, 4 of which belong to
Sub-Group 3.5 (Table 1). This Sub-Group shows a
broad geographic distribution across Southern Eurasia
(Figure 8), from Greece to Nepal which has long been
recognised as an interesting source of primitive sub
groups [38,39]. Sub-Groups 3.3 and 3.4 show geographic
overlap with this Sub-Group (Figure 8) but are themselves much more strongly associated with particular
regions (Afghanistan and Nepal/India respectively). SubGroups 3.4 and 3.5 both contain P. elatius germplasm
but Sub-Group 3.3 apparently lacks it (Additional file 2).
Furthermore, Sub-Groups 3.4 and 3.5 are roughly equidistant from Groups 1 and 2 which represent the bulk
of modern cultivated P. sativum but Sub-Group 3.3 is
more remote and apparently derived from Sub-Group
3.4 (Figure 6).
On the basis of the above observations we suggest
tentatively the following model for P. sativum

Jing et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/44

domestication. Wild P. elatius with affinity to SubGroup 3.5 was selected by early farmers in the Fertile
Crescent. This domesticate was then grown extensively,
broadening its distribution across Southern Eurasia and
additionally differentiated in two opposite directions.
The first of these was an expansion eastwards into the
Indian subcontinent and the Himalayan regions involving Sub-Group 3.4, which subsequently gave rise to the
Afghan ecotypes represented by Sub-Group 3.3. We
cannot exclude the possibility that wild Sub-Group 3.4
germplasm also contributed to this process and further
more detailed study will be needed to test this and
other aspects of our model. The second proposed diversification of primitive cultivated Sub-Group 3.5 P. sativum was the main domestication route that gave rise to
Groups 1 and 2 which represent the mainstream of
modern cultivar Pisum.
The only other Sub-Group with either strong support
from our molecular analysis or restricted geographical
localisation is Sub-Group 1.1 whose distribution is
centred upon Ethiopia and Spain but whose allelic spectrum suggests that it lacks large scale introgression from
any particular wild germplasm (Figure 6, Figure 8).
None of the poorly supported Sub-Groups comprising
P. sativum cultivars and landraces (Sub-Groups 1.2-1.6
and 2.1-2.1) show good resolution from other members
of the same Group, in either of the diversity plots or
their geographic origin. We conclude that these SubGroups are tenuous, with little support from this study.
A recent microsatellite based analysis of Chinese
germplasm [12] has shown this material to be very
diverse and with a strong geographical partitioning of
this variation. It is difficult to relate our study to this
work because we have only 32 Chinese accessions and
virtually none are shared between the two studies. Interestingly Sub-Groups 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 are represented
in our limited set of Chinese material but a larger proportion of our Chinese accessions are in Group 1 (but
none occupy subgroup 1.1; Figure 8). Zong et al suggest
that some of the genetic background to the Chinese
material may derive from Pisum outside the Fertile
Crescent [12]. This is consistent with our South Chinese
accession JI1398 which is found in subgroup 1.3 and has
the phenotypic properties of P. elatius (but was classified as P. sativum by Smith) [13]. Clearly, further work
on shared germplasm sets is needed to resolve these
issues.
A new framework for Pisum core germplasm collections

The findings reported here add considerably to our
understanding of the global diversity of the Pisum
genus. The genotyping of a very broad collection of
germplasm has both confirmed previous findings and

Page 18 of 20

defined important new distinct germplasm sets that
were unsuspected. For example, Sub-Group 1.1 was not
recognised previously and was not represented in the
early diverse test array of 56 lines used in previous studies of the diversity of the John Innes Pisum Collection,
hence it is not represented in Figure 5. This prompts a
more detailed reassessment of not only this material but
also germplasm from across other Sub-Groups with
uneven representation with a view to removing concentrations of related samples such as 3.6 and introducing
new unrepresented germplasm, such as Sub-Groups 1.6,
3.3 and 3.5 (Figure 5). These detailed considerations will
form part of future studies and recommendations for
core collections on various scales, which will include
more germplasm from other collections (Manuscript in
preparation).

Conclusion
These data provide new insights into the genetic diversity and evolution of the genus Pisum and its spatial distribution. We have proposed and elaborated a new
model for the origin of cultivated field pea involving
two historically ancient but evolutionarily recent domestications of subsets of wild Pisum germplasm. We must
point out that this model is based upon small numbers
of sampled wild germplasm which may be biased but it
suggests further experiments to test it. Lastly, we have
produced a new framework for defining a global Pisum
germplasm collection which will result in more rational
choice of materials for future study and exploitation by
agriculture.

The results of 10 independent Structure runs at K = 3, K = 7 and K = 11
are shown. For each run the fractional inferred ancestry of the 3029
individuals is plotted as a histogram, with each ancestral population
colour-coded. Accessions are assigned to Group N if their average

Admixed accessions, where Q1+Q2 = 0.5 > Q3, are placed between
Groups 2 and 3, ordered by increasing Q3. At the bottom of the K = 3

vertical bar. For K = 7 the Q plots are similarly constructed, but accession
order determined by the mean of runs 8, 9 and 10 which are the most
