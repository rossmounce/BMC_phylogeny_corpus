Abstract
Background: The effects of acetic acid, a common food preservative, on the bacteriophage-encoded enterotoxin A
(SEA) expression and production in Staphylococcus aureus was investigated in pH-controlled batch cultures carried out
at pH 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, and 4.5. Also, genomic analysis of S. aureus strains carrying sea was performed to map
differences within the gene and in the temperate phage carrying sea.
Results: The sea expression profile was similar from pH 7.0 to 5.5, with the relative expression peaking in the transition
between exponential and stationary growth phase and falling during stationary phase. The levels of sea mRNA were
below the detection limit at pH 5.0 and 4.5, confirmed by very low SEA levels at these pH values. The level of relative
sea expression at pH 6.0 and 5.5 were nine and four times higher, respectively, in the transitional phase than in the
exponential growth phase, compared to pH 7.0 and pH 6.5, where only a slight increase in relative expression in the
transitional phase was observed. Furthermore, the increase in sea expression levels at pH 6.0 and 5.5 were observed to
be linked to increased intracellular sea gene copy numbers and extracellular sea-containing phage copy numbers. The
extracellular SEA levels increased over time, with highest levels produced at pH 6.0 in the four growth phases
investigated. Using mitomycin C, it was verified that SEA was at least partially produced as a consequence of prophage
induction of the sea-phage in the three S. aureus strains tested. Finally, genetic analysis of six S. aureus strains carrying
the sea gene showed specific sea phage-groups and two versions of the sea gene that may explain the different sea
expression and production levels observed in this study.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the increased sea expression in S. aureus caused by acetic acid induced the seaencoding prophage, linking SEA production to the lifecycle of the phage.
Background
Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) are extracellular proteins, produced mainly by Staphylococcus aureus, causing
food intoxication when ingested. Staphylococcal food
poisoning (SFP) was the fourth most common causative
agent in food-borne illness within the EU in 2008 [1]. It is
associated with food, generally rich in protein, which
requires extensive manual handling, often in combination
with inadequate heating and/or inappropriate storage of
the food [2,3]. To date, 21 staphylococcal enterotoxins or
enterotoxin-like proteins (SEA-SEE, SEG-SEV), excluding
variants, have been identified. These SE genes are widely
disseminated by several mobile genetic elements leading
to variations in the SE expression behavior among entero* Correspondence: Peter.Radstrom@tmb.lth.se

toxigenic staphylococci [2-5]. The expression of a number of the enterotoxins including SEB, SEC, and SED is to
some extent known to involve regulatory systems such as
the accessory gene regulator (Agr), the staphylococcal
accessory regulator (Sar) and the repressor of toxin (Rot)
[6]. However, we still have limited information about
SEA, the toxin considered to be mainly responsible for
staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks [7-11]. The SEA
gene is carried in the bacterial genome by a polymorphic
family of temperate bacteriophages [12-14]. Recent studies of S. aureus strain MSSA476 have shown that mitomycin C (MC) induction of ΦSa3ms, resulted in increased
transcription of enterotoxins SEA, SEG, and SEK and the
fibrinolytic enzyme staphylokinase (Sak) carried by the
prophage [14]. Although, it is still unclear if the increased
transcription of these virulence determinants lead to
increased amounts of SE proteins. Furthermore, identification of the environmental parameters that control the

expression of SEA in food, and the mechanism by which
these signals are transduced to bring about changes in
gene expression, are very limited. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the potential of S. aureus to cause
food poisoning.
Acetic acid is a weak organic acid often used in the food
industry as a preservative due to its antagonistic effect on
bacterial pathogens [15]. Weak acids have the ability to
pass through the cell membrane in the undissociated
form. Once inside the cell, the acid dissociates in the
more alkaline interior, lowering the intracellular pH of
the cell. A decrease in intracellular pH can lead to the
damage of macromolecules (e.g. proteins and DNA) and
the cell membrane, and have a negative effect on cell
maintenance [16,17]. Also, the anion of the acid is accumulated intracellularly, increasing turgor pressure [18].
Acetic acid has been found to be more inhibitory to the
growth of S. aureus than lactic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid, respectively [19]. Also,
acetic acid has been found to almost completely inhibit
SEA formation in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth when
added gradually over time [20].
In the present study, the effects of acetic acid on S.
aureus growth, sea expression and SEA production were
investigated in four growth phases. Furthermore, the
relationship between SEA production and the lifecycle of
the phage carrying the toxin gene was determined.
Finally, genomic analysis of S. aureus strains carrying sea
was performed to map differences within the gene and in
the temperate phage carrying sea.

Results
Effects of acetic acid on sea expression and SEA production
in S. aureus Mu50

Batch cultures of S. aureus Mu50, harboring the sea-containing Φ42-like prophage ΦMu50A [21], were carried
out at controlled pH levels of 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, and 4.5
(Figure 1A). Acetic acid was used to set the pH to investigate the effects of acetic acid on growth, relative sea
expression and extracellular SEA levels during all stages
of growth. The maximal growth rate of S. aureus Mu50
was highest at pH 7.0 and decreased with decreasing pH
(Figure 1A). Batch cultivations performed at lower pH
values showed that pH 5.0 was highly growth-inhibitory,
with only a modest increase in optical density, OD, and
viable cells in the late stationary growth phase, and that
pH 4.5 was too toxic; < 1% of the starting inoculum was
viable after 24 h. The relative sea expression pattern was
similar at all tested pH levels that allowed expression
analysis (Figure 1B); the highest relative levels of sea
mRNA were found in the transitional phase and fell during the stationary growth phase. Small increases in sea
expression were found in the transitional phase at pH 7.0
and 6.5. However, relative sea expression in the transitional phase at pH 6.0 (n = 2) and 5.5 (n = 3) were high,

nine and four times higher, respectively, than in the exponential growth phase. At pH 5.5, extended sea mRNA
expression was observed with the peak associated with
the transitional phase. However, sea mRNA was not possible to detect at pH 5.0 or 4.5.
Extracellular SEA was detected in all cultivations of S.
aureus Mu50 and the levels increased over time at tested
pH levels allowing growth (Figure 2). The SEA levels
increased from pH 7.0 to 6.0 and decreased significantly
at lower pH levels, i.e. pH 5.5, 5.0 and 4.5. The specific
extracellular SEA concentrations (i.e. the extracellular
SEA concentrations divided by the value of the OD at that
point in time) correlating the SEA production to growth,
showed the same trend. The specific SEA concentrations
were 100, 450, 510, 210, 40, and 870 ng per ml and OD
unit for pH 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, and 4.5, respectively. The
specific SEA concentration at pH 4.5 is misleading since
the culture was not growing.

S. aureus Mu50 were collected to determine the trends of

the relative sea gene copy number (and thus the replicative form of the sea-carrying phage) and relative phage
copy number in the four growth phases at different pH
values (Figure 3). The relative sea gene copy number was
low throughout the cultivations at pH 7.0 and 6.5. The sea
gene copy number peaked at pH 5.5, being twelve times
higher than at pH 7.0 in the mid-exponential growth
phase, and a trend of the sea gene copy number decreasing over time was observed at this pH. The sea gene copy

number increased over time at pH 5.0 and 4.5, showing
markedly higher levels at the last sampling point. The
phage copy number increased over time at all pH levels,
with a peak at pH 5.5. In the late stationary growth phase,
the phage copy number was 13 times higher at pH 5.5
than at pH 7.0.
To investigate if the extracellular SEA levels were
affected by prophage induction, 0.5 μg/ml or 5.0 μg/ml
MC was added to exponentially growing S. aureus strains
Mu50, SA17, and SA45 (Figure 4). The number of viable
cells of strain Mu50 after three hours of growth following
MC addition was reduced by two log units in cultures
containing 0.5 μg/ml MC and five log units in cultures
containing 5.0 μg/ml MC, compared with control cultures containing no MC. For both strains SA17 and SA45
the viable cell counts were reduced by one and four log
units in cultures containing 0.5 μg/ml and 5.0 μg/ml MC,
respectively (data not shown). The specific extracellular
SEA levels, i.e. the extracellular SEA concentration per
colony-forming unit, CFU, of S. aureus strains Mu50,
SA17, and SA45, increased with MC concentration compared to the control cultures, being ten, 50, and 20 times
higher at 0.5 μg/ml MC, and 3000, 40 000, and 6000 times
higher at 5.0 μg/ml MC for Mu50, SA17, and SA45,
respectively. Viable phage particles, defined as plaque
forming units, were observed for strains SA17 and SA45
after MC treatment but not for Mu50 using S. aureus
RN450 as recipient strain (for Mu50, S. aureus RN4220
was also tested) (data not shown).

S. aureus SA45, was used to replicate the batch cultivations at pH 7.0 and pH 5.5 (Figure 5 A and B). S. aureus
SA45 had higher maximal growth rate than S. aureus
Mu50, but the cultures never reached the same maximum
OD as Mu50. The relative sea expression pattern of S.
aureus SA45 was the same as for S. aureus Mu50, with
the highest relative sea levels found in the transitional
phase. The sea mRNA levels and extracellular SEA
amounts were very similar for both strains at pH 7.0.
However, at pH 5.5 the relative sea expression in the transitional phase was 38% higher in S. aureus Mu50 compared to in S. aureus SA45 and the final extracellular SEA
concentration in the S. aureus Mu50 cultures was 61%
higher than in S. aureus SA45 cultures on average.
Genetic diversity of sea

Nucleotide sequence analysis of sea and prophage regions
immediately upstream and downstream of the gene was
performed on the whole-genome sequenced S. aureus
strains MRSA252 [22], MSSA476 [22], Mu3, Mu50 [21],

MW2 [23], and Newman [24] to determine genetic differences that may explain the different sea expression and
SEA production profiles observed at pH 5.5 with S.
aureus Mu50 and SA45. Sequence alignment of the coding region of sea revealed two main groups of sea-carrying phages. Within a group the sea sequences showed
100% sequence similarity and between the two groups the
sequence similarity was 98%. Prophages ΦMu3,
ΦMu50A, ΦSa3ms, and ΦSa3mw clustered together in a
sea-group designated sea1, while Φ252B and ΦNM3
formed a sea group, designated sea2.
All six phages shared a homologous region of 3.2 kb
downstream of the sea gene containing the sak gene.
Thereafter, the nucleotide sequences diverged, forming
three subgroups of sea phages. The same grouping of
phages was observed immediately upstream of the translational start site of sea (Figure 6). An analogous phage
grouping was recently reported when comparing the integrase (int) nucleotide sequences of these bacteriophages
[25]. To improve the resolution of phylogenetic analysis
of these bacteriophages based on int genes, we repeated
the int gene grouping (data not shown). The ΦMu3A/
ΦMu50A branch was found to be closer to the Φ252B/
ΦNM3 branch than to the ΦSa3ms/ΦSa3mw branch.
This is in direct contrast to what was found for the sea
gene.
In order to identify the phage- and sea-group of SA45,
eight different regions were targeted by PCR (see Table 1
and Figure 6). This analysis showed that SA45 carries the
sea1-version of the sea gene and belongs to the same subgroup as ΦSa3mw.

Discussion
The genetic diversity analysis of the prophage region
encoding SEA showed two main groups of genes, sea1 and
sea2. To our knowledge this has not been observed
before. Furthermore, Figure 6 shows that the sea1 and
sea2 genes are associated with specific bacteriophages
which could be further grouped based on sequence similarities within regions upstream and downstream of the
sea gene. Borst and Betley divided enterotoxin-A-producing S. aureus into high-SEA producing and low-SEA
producing strains [13]. The variation in SEA production
was associated with differences in the prophage region
immediately upstream of sea. The six strains analyzed
here could be divided in three groups based on sequence
differences in the sea-virulence region. However, a different grouping than for the sea gene was observed upon
comparing the int gene of these phages. The int gene,
being part of the core genome, is essential for the phage's
lifecycle unlike the sea gene, and is therefore reflecting
the evolutionary relationship among these phages. Nucleotide sequence analysis of S. aureus Mu50 and SA45

showed that they belong to different groups based on
variations in the nucleotide sequences within the sea-virulence region. This division may explain the differences
observed between the two strains regarding sea expression and SEA levels at pH 5.5.
The sea expression was highest in the transition from
the exponential to the stationary growth phase in both S.
aureus Mu50 and SA45 at all pH levels that allowed
expression analysis, as established previously [26,27]. A
boost in sea expression was observed in the transitional
phase in S. aureus Mu50 at pH 6.0 and pH 5.5, which was
also found in strain SA45. The same expression pattern
has been found for the prophage-encoded Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL, luk-PV) of S. aureus [28]. Maximal
expression of luk-PV in the late exponential growth phase
was followed by a rapid decline post-exponentially. Our
observation could partially be explained by the induction
of the prophage carrying the toxin gene. The sea-phage
copy numbers of S. aureus Mu50 at pH 6.0 remained constant during the first part of cultivation. In the late stationary growth phase, however, the number had
increased four times (average increase of two biological
replicates) compared to levels in early stationary growth
phase. The phage copy numbers might have increased
further if growth was allowed to continue. An acetic-acid
induced intracellular drop in pH, leading to oxidative
stress [29] would activate the SOS response system
inducing the prophage [30]. Sumby and Waldor showed
that upon prophage induction in S. aureus, the phage
DNA was replicated, resulting in an increase in sea gene

copy number, and that a second prophage-regulated sea
promoter was also activated, resulting in increased sea
expression [14]. Similar enhanced transcription of phageencoded virulence genes upon prophage induction has
also been observed for PVL in S. aureus and the Shiga
toxins in E. coli [28,31].
Mitomycin C, a well-known prophage inducer, was
used in this study. The more MC added, the more SEA
was produced per CFU for all three strains tested, supporting the association between prophage induction and
SEA production. However, the expected boost in extracellular SEA levels accompanying the increased sea
mRNA levels and sea gene copy levels observed at pH 5.5
was not found. This could be because of the pronounced
phage production at pH 5.5 seen as a rapid increase in
extracellular sea-phage copy number (Figure 3). The window for phage-encoded SEA-biosynthesis prior to phagerelease could be too narrow in the bacteria at this pH
level. The relative phage copy number generally increased
over time at all pH levels investigated. At pH 5.5, the relative phage copy number was increasing dramatically over
time, suggesting that substantial prophage induction had
occurred. The sea gene copy number, however, was
decreasing over time at pH 5.5. This could be due to cell
lysis occurring upon prophage induction at this pH. At
pH 5.0 and 4.5, a big increase in relative sea gene copy
number was observed between the two last sampling
points. This suggests that the prophage has been induced
and the replicative form of the phage DNA is produced.
However, at these low pH values, no great increase in

SEA or phage copies were observed, suggesting protein
synthesis was impaired.
In addition, the reason why the sea expression of S.
aureus Mu50 at pH 5.5 was not as high as at pH 6.0,
despite the fact that an even higher level of acetic acid
was added, could also be because the acetic acid concentration here was on the limit of that tolerated by the
organism. The growth rate of the culture at pH 5.5 was
almost half of that at pH 6.0. The expression pattern at
pH 5.5 was different from the patterns at the higher pH
levels studied, in that it lacked the sharp expression peak
in the transitional phase. At pH levels below 6.0, low
amounts of SEA were produced. This supports the theory
that pH 5.5 is close to the limiting pH of the bacterium.
The SEA levels remained constant at pH 5.0 and pH 4.5
during the cultivation of Mu50, with a final SEA concentration of 62 ng/ml for both pH levels, indicating that no
SEA production occured ≤ pH 5.0. This observation is
supported by Barber and Deibel [32]. Using hydrochloric
acid, they found that the lowest pH values that supported
SEA biosynthesis in buffered BHI medium incubated aerobically was 4.9. SFP can be caused by as little as 20-100

ng of enterotoxin [33]. Levels higher than 100 ng/ml were
detected at pH levels 7.0-5.5 in the mid-exponential
growth phase.

Conclusions
This study has shown that the food preservative acetic
acid increases sea gene expression in S. aureus. At pH 6.0
and 5.5, maximal sea expression was observed. At pH 6.0
there was a marked shift in growth rate and phage production peaked at pH 5.5. These findings suggest
prophage induction. At pH 5.0 and 4.5, the sea gene copy
numbers increased dramatically during late stages of cultivation, but SEA levels and phage copy numbers were
low indicating that protein synthesis was affected. It is
our hypothesis that the acetic acid lowers the intracellular
pH of S. aureus, activating the temperate phage and, as a
consequence, boosts the sea expression. Our results support the theory proposed by other research groups that
prophages not only facilitate the dissemination of virulence genes, but also take part in the regulation of the
expression of the genes.

Methods

Primer and probe design

Culture conditions

The forward primer, ESA-1, specific to sea was identified
from the literature [34], and the reverse primer was
designed in-house using LightCycler Probe Design© software ver. 1.0 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany) (Table 2). Primers for the reference gene rrn
were designed as the reverse primer of the sea gene. All
primers were purchased from MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). Hybridization probes specific to sea and
rrn were also designed using the LightCycler Probe
Design© software and purchased from TIB Molbiol
GmbH (Berlin, Germany). The probes work in pairs. A
donor probe labeled with fluorescein at the 3" end transmits the signal to an acceptor probe labeled with
LCRed640/LCRed705 at the 5" end and the 3" hydroxy
group is phosphorylated.

The S. aureus strains used in this study were Mu50 (LGC
Promochem, London, UK), MW2 (donated by Dr. T.
Baba, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan), Newman
(donated by Dr. H. Ingmer, Copenhagen University,
Copenhagen, Denmark), RN4220 (Culture Collection
University of Göteborg, Göteborg, Sweden), RN450
(donated by Dr. J. R. Penadés, Instituto Valenciano de
Investigaciones Agrarias, Castellón, Spain), SA17 and
SA45 (donated by the Swedish Institute for Food and Biotechnology, SIK, Göteborg, Sweden). All cultivations
were performed in BHI (Difco Laboratories; BD Diagnostic Systems, Le Point de Claix, France) broth (with agitation) or agar at 37°C. S. aureus was transferred from
glycerol stock to broth for overnight cultivation prior to
the experiments. Broth (300 ml) was inoculated with a
sufficient volume of S. aureus overnight culture to give an
OD value at 620 nm (OD620) of 0.1 at the start of cultivation. Batch cultivations were then performed at different
pH levels (pH 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, and 4.5) using inhouse fermentors. The pH was set using acetic acid
(Merck; Darmstadt, Germany), pH 7.0: 5.1 mM; pH 6.5:
12 mM; pH 6.0: 18 mM; pH 5.5: 28 mM; pH 5.0: 43 mM
and pH 4.5: 93 mM final concentration of acetic acid, and
maintained by adding sodium hydroxide (Merck) by
automatic titration. The study was designed using several
sampling points over time to visualize trends and all samples were analyzed three times. Where trend deviations
were observed, cultivations were repeated to confirm the
results.
The OD620 was measured to follow growth. All OD
measurements were performed using a U-1800 spectrophotometer (Hitachi High Technologies Inc., Pleasanton,
CA). Samples for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis, and intracellular-DNA and extracellular-DNA extractions were
taken in the mid-exponential growth phase, in the transitional phase, i.e. between the exponential and stationary
phases of growth, in the early stationary phase of growth,
and in the late stationary phase of growth. At pH 5.0,
samples were taken after 12, 27, 36 and 49 h of growth. At
pH 4.5, samples were taken after 10, 24, and 30 h of
growth.
Viable counts were determined in the late stationary
growth phase to confirm OD620 measurements, except at
pH 4.5, where viable counts were determined on each
sampling occasion. Serial decimal dilutions of the bacterial cultures in physiological saline (Merck) solution were
performed. The dilutions were plated on agar, incubated
overnight and the CFU per ml was calculated.

sea expression analysis

Total RNA was extracted using phenol and chloroform as
described by Lövenklev et al. [35], except that the RNA
was re-suspended in 100 μl RNA storage solution
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). First-strand cDNA
was synthesized in two separate reverse-transcription
assays using reverse primers specific to SEA and the reference gene 16S rRNA, as described previously [36], with
0.1 μg RNA in the reference gene assay and 0.5 μg RNA in
the toxin gene assay.
Real-time PCR amplification was carried out on a
LightCycler™ 1.0 instrument (Roche Diagnostics GmbH).
The total volume of PCR mixture was 20 μl including 4 μl
of template cDNA. The sea PCR mixture consisted of 1 ×
PCR buffer, 3.25 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM each of dATP,
dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.5 μM each of the forward and
reverse primers, 0.05 U Tth DNA polymerase, and 0.3
μM of each hybridization probe. The rrn PCR mixture
was the same as the sea PCR mixture, except that 0.15 μM
of each hybridization probe was added. All reagents
except the primers and probes were obtained from Roche
Diagnostics GmbH. The water used was autoclaved ultrapure water. In order to detect the amplification of possible contaminants, a negative control consisting of water
instead of DNA was added to the PCR. Genomic DNA
was used as a positive control. The following PCR protocol was used: initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 0 s (i.e., no
hold at 95°C), primer annealing at 46°C (sea) or 48°C (rrn)
for 5 s, and extension at 72°C for 25 s, with a single fluorescence measurement at the end of the extension step.
The crossing point cycle for each transcript was determined using the second derivative maximum mathematical model in the LightCycler™ software (ver. 3.5) (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH), and the amplification efficiency in
the exponential phase was calculated using the equation
of Klein et al. [37]. The sea gene assay was linear at 1.0 ×

Wallin-Carlquist et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:147

10-6 to 6.3× 10-8 g/ml RNA. The threshold cycle number
of the reference gene varied <1.3 cycles in between samples. The efficiency was 0.96 ± 0.066 and 1.1 ± 0.075,
respectively for the sea and the rrn assays.
The relative expression of the sea gene was calculated
by relating the toxin gene expression to the constant
expression of a reference gene, the 16S rRNA gene [38].
To determine the amplification efficiency and the log-linear range of amplification for each real-time PCR assay,
the total RNA was serially diluted. The dilutions were
reverse transcribed and amplified in the LightCycler™
instrument three times to obtain standard curves. Samples were also amplified three times. Equal amounts of
total RNA from each sample were reverse transcribed to
quantify the transcript levels of sea. The relative expression was calculated from the amplification efficiencies of
each PCR assay and the crossing point deviation of the
unknown sample versus a calibration sample, as
described previously [38], see equation 1.

Phage induction analysis

Cell-DNA was extracted using a protocol described by
Walsh et al. [39] modified to include a 20% Chelex® (BioRad Laboratories; Hercules, USA) solution instead of 5%.
20 ng of DNA was added to the sea real-time PCR assay,
see above.
Phage DNA was purified using zinc chloride as previously described by Santos [40] without previous DNase
or RNase treatments. 200 ng of DNA was added to the
sea real-time PCR assay, see above.
Induction of the bacteriophage using MC (Duchefa
Biochemie, Haarlem, the Netherlands) was performed
according to Resch et al. [41]. S. aureus overnight culture

(0.2 ml) was added to 30 ml of fresh broth in 250 ml
Erlenmeyer flasks. When cultures were in the mid-exponential phase of growth, MC was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml or 5 μg/ml, followed by continued
incubation for 3 h. SEA concentrations, viable cell counts,
and viable virus particles were determined. Cultures
without addition of MC were used as controls.
The phage plaque assay was performed as described by
France and Markham [42]. Supernatants from S. aureus
cultures were spotted onto agar and the plates were then
incubated at least overnight. S. aureus RN450 and
RN4220 were used as receiver strains.
The relative sea gene copy number was calculated using
equation 1. The relative phage copy number was calculated using the nominator part of equation 1.
ELISA

A modified protocol was developed for ELISA analysis of
SEA using affinity-purified sheep polyclonal antibodies
based on Poli et al. [43]. A microtiter plate (Immulon®
2HB polystyrene, Flat Bottom Microtiter® Plates, 96 wells
solid; Thermo Electron Corporation; Waltham, MA) was
coated with 100 μl/well of a solution containing 2 μg/ml
SEA affinity-purified antibody (Toxin Technology, Inc.;
Sarasota, FL) in coating buffer (0.1 M sodium carbonate,
pH 9.6, Merck) and left at 37°C overnight. All sites were
blocked with 185 μl blocking buffer (SuperBlock Blocking
Buffer in PBS, pH 7.4, Pierce, Rockford, IL) for one hour
at 37°C and at least one hour at 4°C. The plate was
washed four times with washing buffer (0.05% Tween 20,
BioRad Inc., in 10 mM PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO). Standards or culture supernatants were loaded
onto the plate (100 μl/well) at appropriate dilutions and
incubated for 90 min at 37°C. As SEA standard, highly
purified SEA staphylococcal enterotoxin from Toxin
Technology Inc. (Sarasota, FL), was used. The plate was
washed and the biotinylated antibody (Toxin Technology,

bovine serum albumin, Sigma-Aldrich, 0.1% Tween 20,
0.01% Thimerosal, Sigma-Aldrich, 1% milk powder, Semper, Sundbyberg, Sweden) was added (100 μl/well). The
plate was incubated for one hour at 37°C and washed.
NeutrAvidin™-linked alkaline phosphatase (ImmunoPure
NeutrAvidin™, alkaline phosphatase conjugated, 0.9 mg/
ml, Pierce; diluted 1000 × in assay buffer, no milk powder
included) was added (100 μl/well), and the plate was
incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. The plate was washed
and substrate (SIGMAFAST™ p-nitrophenyl phosphate
tablets N2770, Sigma-Aldrich) was added (100 μl/well).
The color was allowed to develop for 45 min in darkness
and the optical density was determined using a
microplate reader with a filter at 405 nm (Multiskan
Ascent, Thermo Electron Corporation). Absorbance values (mean of triplicate wells) were plotted against toxin
concentrations, and values were determined from linear
regression. The detection limit was at 0.31 ng/ml of SEA.
Nucleotide sequence analysis

The sea nucleotide sequences of six S. aureus strains
(MRSA252 [GenBank: BX571856], MSSA476 [GenBank:
BX571857], Mu3 [GenBank: AP009324], Mu50 [GenBank: BA000017], MW2 [GenBank: BA000033], and
Newman [GenBank: AP009351]) were retrieved from
GenBank
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/
index.html, April 2009) and pairwise aligned using BioEdit v. 7.0.9.0 (Ibis Biosciences; Carlsbad, CA). DNA
sequences (8 kb) upstream and downstream of the sea
gene were also compared. The sea genes of all six strains
have previously been annotated.
Conventional PCR

Primers were designed to confirm the results of the
nucleotide sequence analysis of sea and regions adjacent
to the gene (Table 1). Two primer pairs were designed to
distinguish between the two groups of nucleotide
sequences, sea1 and sea2. Six primer pairs were designed
to validate sequence differences found between strains in
regions upstream and downstream of the sea gene. All
primers were ordered from MWG Biotech AG. Genomic
DNA from S. aureus Mu50, MW2, Newman, and SA45
was used as template. The total volume of PCR mixture
was 50 μl including 200 ng template DNA. The PCR mixture consisted of 1 × PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM
each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.2 μM each of
forward and reverse primer and 2 U Tth DNA polymerase. All reagents except primers were obtained from
Roche Diagnostics GmbH. The water used was autoclaved ultrapure water. In order to detect the amplification of possible contaminants, a negative control
consisting of water instead of DNA was added to the
PCR. The following PCR protocol was used: initial dena-

turation at 94°C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, primer annealing at 47-55°C (see
Table 1) for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, with a
final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. All amplifications
were carried out using the Gene Amp 9700 thermal
cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus; Norwalk, CT). The PCR
products were visualized using 0.8% agarose (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) gel electrophoresis according to Sambrook and Russell [44].
