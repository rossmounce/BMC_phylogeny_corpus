Abstract
Background: Bordetella holmesii is a human pathogen closely related to B. pertussis, the etiological
agent of whooping cough. It is able to cause disease in immunocompromised patients, but also
whooping cough-like symptoms in otherwise healthy individuals. However, virtually nothing was
known so far about the underlying virulence mechanisms and previous attempts to identify
virulence factors related to those of B. pertussis were not successful.
Results: By use of a PCR approach we were able to identify a B. holmesii gene encoding a protein
with significant sequence similarities to the filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) of B. avium and to a
lesser extent to the FHA proteins of B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, and B. bronchiseptica. For these
human and animal pathogens FHA is a crucial virulence factor required for successful colonization
of the host. Interestingly, the B. holmesii protein shows a relatively high overall sequence similarity
with the B. avium protein, while sequence conservation with the FHA proteins of the human and
mammalian pathogens is quite limited and is most prominent in signal sequences required for their
export to the cell surface. In the other Bordetellae expression of the fhaB gene encoding FHA was
shown to be regulated by the master regulator of virulence, the BvgAS two-component system.
Recently, we identified orthologs of BvgAS in B. holmesii, and here we show that this system also
contributes to regulation of fhaB expression in B. holmesii. Accordingly, the purified BvgA response
regulator of B. holmesii was shown to bind specifically in the upstream region of the fhaB promoter
in vitro in a manner similar to that previously described for the BvgA protein of B. pertussis.
Moreover, by deletion analysis of the fhaB promoter region we show that the BvgA binding sites
are relevant for in vivo transcription from this promoter in B. holmesii.
Conclusion: The data reported here show that B. holmesii is endowed with a factor highly related
to filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), a prominent virulence factor of the well characterized
pathogenic Bordetellae. We show that like in the other Bordetellae the virulence regulatory BvgAS
system is also involved in the regulation of fhaB expression in B. holmesii. Taken together these data
indicate that in contrast to previous notions B. holmesii may in fact make use of virulence
mechanisms related to those described for the other Bordetellae.

Background
The genus Bordetella currently comprises nine species,
most of which were found to be associated with host
organisms [1,2]. Medically the most important species is
B. pertussis, the etiological agent of whooping cough for
which humans are the only known host. B. parapertussis
causes milder forms of whooping cough-like disease in
humans. B. bronchiseptica is known to cause respiratory
disease in various mammalian species, but only rarely in
humans [2]. These "classical" Bordetella species are closely
related and the recent determination of their genome
sequences confirmed previous suggestions that B. pertussis
and B. parapertussis are independent descendents of B.
bronchiseptica-like ancestors which during specialization
to a single host have sustained a significant erosion of
their genetic material [3]. In agreement with their close
relationship these organisms produce highly related virulence factors such as several toxins and colonization factors [2].
Among these virulence factors the filamentous hemagglutinin FHA is of particular relevance for pathogenesis. It is
an important adhesin and it is required for tracheal colonization in animal models [4]. FHA is a huge protein synthesized as a precursor of 367 kDa which is processed to a
mature protein of about 220 kDa by extensive N-terminal
and C-terminal modifications involving possibly the Lep
signal peptidase and the subtilisin-like autotransporter
protein SphB1 [5,6]. FHA is exported to the cell surface
and/or secreted via a two-partner export mechanism
requiring the FhaC protein located in the outer membrane
of the bacteria [7,8]. It has several distinct binding
domains involved in adhesion to different substrates. The
carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) probably enables the bacteria to attach to ciliated respiratory epithelial
cells and to macrophages [9]. FHA exhibits lectin-like
activity for heparin and dextran sulphate possibly
involved in the interaction with nonciliated epithelial
cells which also contributes to FHA-mediated hemagglutination [10]. Furthermore, there is an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)
motif which enables FHA to adhere to human monocytes/
macrophages via the leukocyte integrin complement
receptor 3 (CR3, alpha M beta 2, CD11b/CD18) [11]. The
FHA proteins of the "classical" species are highly related,
but not entirely functionally exchangeable. Recently, by
use of a B. bronchiseptica strain expressing the B. pertussis
FHA protein it was found that the heterologous protein
could mediate adherence to various epithelial and macrophage cell lines in vitro. In contrast, in rat infection models
significant differences in the host-pathogen interaction
were noted for the mutant B. bronchiseptica strain suggesting significantly different activities of the closely related
FHA proteins of the classical species and a role of FHA for
host adaptation [12]. Two other proteins, FhaL and FhaS,
with significant sequence similarity to FHA are present in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/100

the members of the B. bronchiseptica cluster, but their functional relevance in virulence is not yet clear [3]. As in case
of most other virulence factors, the expression of the fhaB
locus is controlled by the BvgAS two-component system
which is responsive to environmental stimuli such as temperature or compounds such as MgSO4 or nicotinic acid
[13,14]. The architecture of the fhaB promoter and its activation mechanism by the BvgAS system has been investigated in much detail [15,16]. Finally, FHA is a protective
antigen and it is included in acellular pertussis vaccines
[2].
More recently, additional species were included in the
genus Bordetella. In 1984, B avium, a respiratory pathogen
of birds, was first described. The genome sequence of B.
avium was recently established and revealed the presence
of several factors orthologous to those of the "classical"
Bordetellae including FHA and the BvgAS two-component
system [17,18]. Among other "novel" Bordetella species
occasionally isolated from patients with underlying disease such as B. hinzii and B. trematum, B. holmesii has
gained most attention in the past years, since its 16S rDNA
sequence suggested this organism to be most closely
related to B. pertussis [2,19]. Moreover, B. holmesii is
known to contain several copies of the insertion elements
IS481 and IS1001, otherwise found only in B. pertussis and
B. parapertussis, respectively [20,21]. In addition to its isolation from immunocompromised patients [22-24], B.
holmesii was found to be able to cause whooping-cough
like symptoms in otherwise healthy persons [25,26]. Very
little was known about the virulence properties of this
bacterium and attempts to identify virulence factors
related to those of B. pertussis failed. Recently, we succeeded to identify the BvgAS two-component system of B.
holmesii by PCR amplification with degenerate oligonucleotides [27]. Interestingly, in contrast to the close relationship of the 16S rDNA sequences of B. holmesii and B.
pertussis, the B. holmesii BvgAS system was found to be
more closely related to the orthologous BvgAS system of
B. avium than to that of B. pertussis [27].
Based again on a PCR approach with degenerate oligonucleotides we attempted to identify additional putative virulence factors of B. holmesii related to those of B. pertussis.
Here we describe the identification and initial characterization of an FHA orthologue of B. holmesii. We show that
the FHA protein of B. holmesii is more closely related to
that of B. avium than to the FHA proteins of the "classical"
Bordetellae. Furthermore, we show that similar to FHA of
all other species it is transcriptionally regulated by the
BvgAS two-component system suggesting similar virulence strategies in the different Bordetella species.

Results and Discussion
Identification and sequence analysis of the fhaB gene of B.
holmesii
Based on short regions of highly conserved nucleotide
sequences of the 5'- and 3'-ends of the fhaB genes of B.
avium and B. pertussis oligonucleotide pairs Fha1F/Fha1R
and Fha2F/Fha2R were designed and used for PCR amplification with chromosomal DNA of B. holmesii. For both
primer combinations PCR products could be amplified.
The sequence analysis of the amplified DNA fragments
revealed significant similarity in particular in the deduced
amino acid sequence to the respective fhaB sequences of
the other Bordetellae. By PCR amplification using the
primer pair Fha1F/Fha1R, we found that all B. holmesii
strains tested (B. holmesii G7702, B. holmesii G8341, B.
holmesii ATCC51541 and B. holmesii No1) harbour orthologues of this fhaB gene (data not shown). Using a
genome walking strategy the DNA sequence of the fhaB
gene of strain B. holmesii G7702 was completed. The fhaB
coding region of B. holmesii starts with a GTG codon and
comprises 8,793 bp with a coding capacity for a 304 kDa
protein, which is smaller than FHA of B. pertussis (367
kDa) but larger than the respective protein of B. avium
(273 kDa). The genome organisation of the fhaB locus of
B. holmesii differs from that of the other Bordetella species.
In B. holmesii, upstream of the fhaB gene an open reading

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/100

frame (orfMP) is located with significant similarity to a
conserved integral membrane protein of B. bronchiseptica
(BB3004) and B. parapertussis (BPP3041) which is transcribed divergently. Directly downstream of the fhaB gene
a copy of the insertion element IS1001 is located which is
known to occur in B. holmesii and in B. parapertussis. In
contrast, in the species belonging to the B. bronchiseptica
cluster the fhaB gene is arranged between the divergently
transcribed bvgAS locus and the fimbrial operon fimABCD
which precedes the fhaC gene whose gene product is
involved in the export of FHA. In B. avium an ORF encoding an ABC transporter is present upstream of fhaB, while
the downstream gene organization is similar to the B.
bronchiseptica cluster (Fig. 1) [3,17,18].
The overall similarity of the nucleotide sequence of the
fhaB gene of B. holmesii with those of B. avium and B. pertussis is low (between 50% and 52%) explaining the failure of previous attempts to detect an fhaB orthologue in
this species by Southern hybridization experiments (data
not shown). Even in those regions of the B. holmesii fhaB
gene (e.g. within the first 600 bp) in which the predicted
amino acid sequences of the FHA proteins are quite conserved (see below), the nucleotide sequence similarity is
quite limited (59%). On the level of the deduced amino
acid sequences, the B. holmesii FHA protein shows an over-

avium. Region A comprises approximately amino acids 1–850, region B amino acids 950 to 1,640, region C amino acids 1,900 to
2,600, and region D amino acids 2,830 to 2,930 of the B. holmesii FHA protein; these regions correspond to amino acids 1–820,
840–1,540, 1,600–2310, and 2,520–2621 of the B. avium protein, respectively.

all similarity of 55% to the FHA protein of B. avium (Fig.
1). The similarity to the FHA, FhaL and FhaS proteins of
the members of the B. bronchiseptica complex is less pronounced, e.g. 39.2% to FHA of B. pertussis as calculated
using the EMBOSS pairwise alignment algorithms http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/align/ (Table 1). With a sequence
similarity of 37.3% the most similar protein outside of the
genus Bordetella is an adhesin-like protein from Yersinia
frederiksenii, an environmental bacterium that can also be
associated with a wide variety of host organisms [28]. This
analysis shows that FHA of B. holmesii is more similar to
the B. avium protein than to the related factors of the
mammalian pathogens, in line with previous observations that the BvgA, BvgS and RecA proteins of B. holmesii
and B. avium are more closely related to each other than
they are to those of the B. bronchiseptica complex [29,30].
This contrasts previous data obtained by comparison of
the 16S rDNA sequences, which placed B. holmesii as a
new species closer to B. pertussis than to B. avium. On the
other hand, recent evidence indicated that the gene
encoding the 16S RNA of B. holmesii may have been
acquired horizontally from B. pertussis [30].
For the Sec-dependent secretion across the cytoplasmic
membrane, the B. holmesii FHA protein has an extended
N-terminal signal sequence, which is very similar to that
of the B. pertussis protein. In B. pertussis, the signal
sequence is cleaved at an alanine at sequence position 71
probably by the Lep signal peptidase [6]. The B. holmesii
FHA protein has also an alanine residue at this position
suggesting its processing at this site after transport
through the cytoplasmic membrane. In addition, the Nterminus of B. pertussis FHA harbours a domain about 250
amino acid residues in length which is essential for secretion through the outer membrane according to the twopartner secretion model, the so-called TPS domain [31].
The exact nature of the transport signal is not known so
far, but two sequence motifs (NPNL and NPNGI) are well
conserved among two-partner secreted proteins and at
least the NPNL motif plays a role in the secretion of B. pertussis FHA [32]. Both sequence motifs are also present in
the FHA protein of B. holmesii suggesting that it is also
exported via a two-partner secretion mechanism.

Similarities of the B. holmesii protein with domains of the
B. pertussis FHA protein possibly involved in adhesion
including the heparin binding (aa 442–862) and carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) (aa 1141–1279) are
very limited and the elucidation of relevant binding activities must await the biochemical characterization of the B.
holmesii FHA protein. An intriguing feature of the FHA
protein of B. pertussis is the presence of an RGD motif (aa
1097–1099) enabling the protein to interact with integrin
receptors [2]. The B. holmesii protein does not contain an
RGD motif, instead at sequence position 742–744 it harbours a KGD motif (Fig. 2). In some cases, KGD motifs
may be involved in integrin binding [33,34], however,
ascribing such a function to the KGD motif of the B. holmesii protein must await future experimental analysis.
Regulation of expression of the B. holmesii fhaB gene
Upstream of the fhaB gene a divergently transcribed gene
is present suggesting that the fhaB gene has a promoter of
its own. To analyse the regulatory region of the fhaB gene
(PfhaB) it was cloned upstream of a promoterless gfp gene
in the broad host range vector pMMB208 and the resulting plasmid was introduced into B. holmesii. By primer
extension analysis with a gfp-specific primer three transcripts (P1 – P3) were identified initiating at sequence
positions -58 (P1), -71 (P2) and -88 (P3) with respect to
the translational start codon of the fhaB gene (Fig. 3). No
obvious -10 and -35 regions could be observed upstream
of any of these putative transcriptional start sites. To investigate whether, similar to the other Bordetellae, the BvgAS
system is involved in the control of fhaB expression,
primer extension analysis was performed on RNA
extracted from a B. holmesii bvgAS mutant [27] harbouring
the plasmid-borne PfhaB-gfp fusion. Interestingly, the longest of the three transcripts (P3) was not detected in the
bvgAS mutant indicating that the synthesis of this transcript is controlled by the BvgAS system, while the other
transcripts are constitutively produced under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3). Similarly, the fhaB gene of B.
pertussis is controlled by a BvgAS regulated promoter, but
some constitutive expression was noted [35].

Although the fhaB gene is transcribed in B. holmesii grown
at standard culture conditions, various attempts to detect

the B. holmesii FHA protein were not successful so far. The
B. holmesii strains used in this study grow very poorly in
liquid culture reaching a maximal OD600 of about 0,5. We
were unable to detect a protein with a molecular weight
corresponding to FHA in the culture supernatants neither
by SDS PAGE nor by immune blotting using a polyclonal
antiserum against the B. pertussis FHA protein. Similarly,
also in whole cell lysates of bacteria grown on BG agar
plates no FHA protein could be detected (data not
shown). It is therefore possible, that the translation efficiency of the fhaB gene is low, which may be in line with
the fact that the open reading frame starts with a GTG
codon, or that the protein is processed to smaller fragments than the related proteins of the other Bordetellae.
To further investigate the transcriptional regulation of the
fhaB gene by the BvgAS system we performed DNA binding experiments in vitro with purified recombinant BvgABH
of B. holmesii [27]. In fact, in band shift experiments binding of the phosphorylated but not of the unphosphorylated BvgABH protein to the fhaB upstream region could
be detected (Fig. 4). Binding was specific since addition of
unspecific competitor DNA did not interfere with binding
of BvgABH-P even in the presence of a 1,000 fold excess of
competitor DNA (data not shown). To further characterize BvgA binding to the promoter region, DNase I footprint analysis with BvgABH of B. holmesii was performed.
Footprint experiments were carried out on a 312 bp DNA
segment ranging from nucleotide position +29 to -283 as
numbered with respect to the translational start site of the
fhaB gene. The addition of BvgABH-P to the reaction mixture resulted in a large region protected from DNase I

digestion ranging from position -40 to -243 with respect
to the start codon of fhaB. Within the protected region the
appearance of a regular pattern of hypersensitive sites
every 10 to 11 nucleotides could be observed (Fig. 5), a
phenomenon which was noted previously in the case of
the promoter of the bvgAS operon of B. holmesii [27]. Surprisingly, the protected area covers all three transcriptional start sites mapped by primer extension analysis
and, accordingly, includes the corresponding core promoter elements. It is not clear whether this observation
has in vivo relevance.
A search for putative BvgA binding sites within the fhaB
promoter region revealed the presence of four sequence
motifs termed BS1 to BS4, respectively, with similarities to
the well defined BvgA binding sites in B. pertussis (Fig. 6)
which are located within or close to the region protected
by BvgABH-P in the footprint experiments. BS2 and BS3
show high similarity to each other and consist of inverted
repeat heptanucleotide sequences centered at position 117 and -65.5 relative to the start site of transcript P3. The
left and right half-site motifs of BS2 and BS3 match the
consensus half-site motif for binding of B. pertussis BvgA
(BvgABP) [15] in 4 and 5 (BS2) and 5 (BS3) out of seven
positions. BS1 is arranged as a direct heptanucleotide
repeat whose half-sites match the consensus in 5 and 6
positions, respectively, and is centered at position -161.
BS4 which consists of an inverted repeat centered at position -47.5 shows the lowest similarity to the consensus
heptanucleotide BvgABP binding motif (4 and 3 matches
per half-site). The fhaB promoter of B. pertussis comprises
a heptanucleotide inverted repeat sequence with high

fhaB promoter of B. pertussis is located immediately 5'
adjacent to the low-affinity sites, the centers of the
inverted repeat sequences BS2 and BS3 are located in a
distance of 51 bp. The most prominent sites showing
hypersensitivity to DNase I cleavage in footprint experiments map to the region flanked by BS2 and BS3 (Fig. 5).
To investigate a functional role of these putative BvgA
binding site(s) we performed a deletion analysis of the
fhaB promoter region and carried out band shift assays
with progressively 5'- truncated DNA fragments lacking
BS1 to BS4. As shown in Fig. 7, BvgABH-P bound equally
well to DNA fragments comprising the four putative BvgA
binding sites BS1 to BS4 and to a DNA fragment lacking
BS1 suggesting a negligible role of BS1 for the activation
of the BvgA-P dependent promoter of fhaB. In agreement
with this assumption, BS1 was only partially protected by
BvgABH-P binding in DNase I footprint experiments (Fig.
6). When BvgABH-P was incubated with a DNA fragment
lacking both BS1 and BS2 still a distinct DNA-protein
complex was formed, however, binding was significantly
weaker since a much higher amount of BvgABH-P was
required to achieve a band shift. No significant binding of
BvgABH-P was detectable to DNA fragments containing
only BS4 or no BS box at all. These data suggest a functional role of the highly similar BS2 and BS3 sites for
binding of BvgABH-P to the fhaB upstream region.

sion vector and transferred to the B. holmesii wild type and
the bvgAS mutant strain. GFP expression directed from the
different constructs was used as a measure for promoter
activity. GFP expression was strong in the B. holmesii wild
type strain harbouring construct pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0
containing the entire fhaB upstream region, while very
low amounts of GFP were detected in the bvgAS mutant
harbouring the same plasmid (Fig. 8, compare lanes 1 and
2). These data confirm the BvgAS mediated regulation of
fhaB expression which was already observed on the transcriptional level (Fig. 3). Moreover, corroborating the in
vitro data, GFP expression was virtually absent in strains B.
holmesii G7702 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp4) and B. holmesii
G7702 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp6) whose gfp expression plasmids contained only site BS4 or did not contain a BS site
at all (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 6). In agreement with the results
of the DNA binding experiments a dramatic increase in
GFP expression could be noted when the fhaB upstream
region in the gfp expression plasmids comprised BS3 or
BS2 and BS3 in addition to BS4 (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 3). The
virtually identical GFP expression directed from the
pMMB208-fhaP-gfp3 (containing BS3 and BS4) and
pMMB208-fhaP-gfp2 (containing BS2 to BS4) plasmids
was surprising since the EMSA studies reported above
revealed a relatively weak binding of BvgABH-P to a promoter fragment containing BS3 and BS4, while binding to
a fragment comprising BS2 to BS4 was very efficient suggesting a prominent role of BS2 for transcriptional activation. Since BS3 is fairly similar to the consensus BvgABP
binding motif and is located at the appropriate position to
allow the interaction between BvgABH and the C-terminal
domain of the α subunit of RNA polymerase, BvgABH
binding to BS3 facilitated by DNA topology effects might
be sufficient to fully activate the plasmid-borne fhaB pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/100

moter in pMMB208-fhaP-gfp3. In the presence of the full
length fhaB promoter cooperative protein interactions are
likely be involved in the binding of BvgABH to the BS2/BS3
region.
To investigate whether the fhaB promoter of B. holmesii is
also recognized by the BvgA protein of B. pertussis, the
pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0 plasmid containing the entire promoter region of the B. holmesii fhaB gene fused to GFP was
introduced into the B. pertussis strains Tohama I (TI) and
BP359. Strong GFP expression was observed by immunoblot analysis in the wildtype strain TI (pMMB208-fhaPgfp0), while expression of the reporter gene was hardly
detectable in the bvgAS mutant BP359 (pMMB208-fhaPgfp0) (data not shown). Interestingly, primer extension
analysis performed with RNA extracted from TI
(pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0) and BP359 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0)
using a gfp-specific oligonucleotide demonstrated that in
the wild type strain transcription of gfp starts at two sites,
which, however, are identical to the start sites of transcripts P1 and P3 synthesized from constitutive (P1) and
bvg-dependent (P3) dependent promoters in B. holmesii.
Moreover, as observed in B. holmesii, in B. pertussis the promoter directing the synthesis of transcript P3 is not transcribed anymore when the BvgAS system is inactivated
(data not shown). These data suggest that the activation
mechanism of the fhaB promoter of B. holmesii by the
BvgA proteins of B. holmesii and B. pertussis is remarkably
similar. This is surprising since it was recently shown that
the BvgA protein of B. holmesii does not bind to and cannot activate the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis, although in
particular in its C-terminal output domain it is highly
related to the BvgA protein of B. pertussis [27,36].

Conclusion
Little was known so far about the virulence mechanisms
of B. holmesii which can cause pertussis-like disease in
humans and within the genus Bordetella was thought to be
most closely related to B. pertussis. Previous attempts to
identify possible virulence factors related to those of the
etiological agent of whooping cough and of the other
well-characterized Bordetellae were not successful. Here
we describe the identification of a B. holmesii factor related
to the major adhesin of the other pathogenic Bordetellae,
the filamentous hemagglutinin FHA. This adds to our previous report on the identification of a two-component
system in B. holmesii orthologous to the BvgAS two-component system of B. pertussis which in the other pathogenic Bordetellae is the master regulator of virulence gene
expression and directly controls the expression of FHA.
We show that also in B. holmesii the expression of FHA is
regulated by the BvgAS system and that the activation
mechanism of the fhaB promoter in B. holmesii resembles
that in B. pertussis. These data strongly suggest that basic
virulence mechanisms of B. holmesii and of the other pathogenic Bordetellae are related. Furthermore the present
study provides further evidence that B. holmesii may be
more closely related to the bird pathogen B. avium than to
B. pertussis indicating that in the genus Bordetella in different phylogenetic lineages independent strains repeatedly
evolved towards being human pathogens.

Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 2. B.
holmesii strains, B. pertussis strains and B. bronchiseptica
strains were grown on Bordet-Gengou (BG) agar plates
supplemented with 20% horse blood [27]. When
required, antibiotics were added to the following final
concentrations: streptomycin, 100 µg ml-1; spectinomycin, 100 µg ml-1; kanamycin, 50 µg ml-1; gentamycin, 15
µg ml-1; ampicillin, 100 µg ml-1 and chloramphenicol, 20
µg ml-1. Bacterial conjugations were performed as
described previously [37], using Escherichia coli SM10 as
the donor strain [38]. Protein lysates were prepared from
bacteria grown on BG agar plates for 48 h at 37°C which
were suspended in saline at a cell density of 1.4 × 108 c.f.u.
ml-1.
General techniques
DNA manipulation, cloning procedures and acrylamide
gel electrophoresis were carried out according to standard
procedures. PCR amplifications were performed with a
model T3 thermocycler (Biometra) using Pfu polymerase
(Promega) or Taq polymerase (Qbiogene Inc.). Oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 3. All cloned
PCR products were subjected to automated sequencing to
ensure proper amplification. Immunoblot analysis was
performed using a semidry blotting procedure as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/100

described previously [39]. Green fluorescent protein
(GFP) was detected using rabbit GFP antiserum (Invitrogen).
Characterization of the fhaB locus of B. holmesii
Chromosomal DNA of B. holmesii G7702 was used as template for PCR reactions. Primers for PCR reactions were
deduced from conserved DNA regions of the fhaB gene of
B. pertussis and B. avium. Primer pair Fha1F/Fha1R was
deduced from the 5'-end of the fhaB gene (Fha1F: base
pair 514 to 536 in fhaB of B. pertussis; base pair 493 to 515
in fhaB of B. avium; Fha1R: base pair 923 to 944 in fhaB of
B. pertussis; base pair 902 to 923 in fhaB of B. avium).
Primer pair Fha2F/Fha2R was deduced from the 3'-end of
the fhaB gene (Fha2F: base pair 10420 to 10445 in fhaB of
B. pertussis; base pair 7573 to 7598 in fhaB of B. avium;
Fha2R: base pair 10738 to 10757 in fhaB of B. pertussis;
base pair 7877 to 7896 in fhaB of B. avium). Using primer
pairs Fha1F/Fha1R and Fha2F/Fha2R, two fragments of
the expected length (340 bp and 440 bp) could be amplified from chromosomal DNA of B. holmesii G7702. The
PCR products were sequenced and the sequence analysis
demonstrated that the DNA fragments encoded part of the
fhaB homologue of B. holmesii. The entire fhaB gene of B.
holmesii was sequenced by a genome walking approach
using the Universal Genome Walker Kit (Clontech Inc.).
Construction of B. holmesii and B. pertussis strains
containing a plasmid with a fusion of the fhaB promoter
region of B. holmesii to a gfp reporter gene
A 277 bp DNA fragment containing the entire promoter
region of the fhaB gene was PCR amplified from genomic
DNA of B. holmesii G7702 using the primer pair Fhagfp1/
Fhagfp7, thereby introducing BamHI and XbaI restriction
sites at the 5'- and 3'-terminus, respectively. A DNA fragment containing the promoterless gfp-mut2 gene was
excised with XbaI and HindIII from plasmid pKEN [40].
The 277 bp DNA fragment harbouring the fhaB promoter
(termed fhaP0) and the gfp fragment were cloned together
in plasmid pSK, resulting in plasmid pSK-fhaP-gfp0. The
fhaP-gfp0 fragment was then excised by BamHI- and HindIII-digestion and was subsequently ligated into plasmid
pMMB208. In the resulting plasmid pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0,
the fusion of the promoter fragment and the gfp gene is
located in the opposite orientation to the plasmid-borne
tac promoter. pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0 was subsequently
transformed into E. coli SM10 and transferred by conjugation into various B. holmesii and B. pertussis strains. The
same protocol was applied to generate the following constructs, which contain fusions of different fhaB promoter
fragments of B. holmesii G7702 with the gfp reporter gene:
pMMB208-fhaP-gfp2 (fhaP2, 224 bp, amplified with
Fhagfp2/Fhagfp7), pMMB208-fhaP-gfp3 (fhaP3, 168 bp,
amplified with Fhagfp3/Fhagfp7), pMMB208-fhaP-gfp4
(fhaP4, 146 bp, amplified with Fhagfp4/Fhagfp7), and

pMMB208-fhaP-gfp6 (fhaP6, 111 bp, amplified with
Fhagfp6/Fhagfp7).
Primer extension experiments
Total RNA was prepared from bacteria grown on BG agar
plates for 48 h at 37°C. Primer extension experiments
were carried out essentially as described previously [27]
with the primer oligonucleotide Gfp1 (Table 2). Sequencing reaction mixtures, with plasmid pSK-fhaP-gfp0 as template DNA and the appropriate oligonucleotide primer,
were analysed on 6% urea-polyacrylamide gels and used
as standards for determination of the transcription initiation sites.
Gel retardation experiments
A 277 bp DNA fragment (probe I) containing part of the
fhaB upstream region was PCR amplified from genomic
DNA of B. holmesii G7702 using primer pair Fhagfp1/
Fhagfp7. The PCR fragment was 5'-end labelled with [γ32P]-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI) and purified using the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen
Inc.). The His6-BvgABH protein described previously [27]
was diluted in 1 × dilution buffer (2 mM MgCl2, 50 mM
KCl, 0.1% Igepal CA 630, 10 mM DTT) and was phosphorylated by incubation with 50 mM acetyl phosphate
(Sigma Inc.) for 20 min at room temperature. Increasing
amounts of the protein were added to approximately
15,000 cpm of the labelled DNA probe in 20 µl of 1 ×
binding buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM
EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, v/v). The samples were
incubated for 20 min at room temperature and were then
loaded onto a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel.
Gels were run for 2.5 h at 150 V and subsequently the
dried gels were autoradiographed. The same procedure
was applied using the following DNA probes, which were
amplified from the fhaB upstream region of B. holmesii
G7702: probe II (224 bp, amplified by Fhagfp2/Fhagfp7),
probe III (163 bp, amplified by FhaGR1/Fhagfp7), probe
IV (135 bp, amplified by FhaGR2/Fhagfp7) and probe V
(111 bp, amplified by Fhagfp6/Fhagfp7).
DNase I footprinting
DNase I footprint experiments were performed essentially
as described previously [41]. A 312 bp DNA fragment containing part of the upstream region of the fhaB gene was
PCR amplified from chromosomal DNA of B. holmesii
G7702 using primer pair FhaBamHI/FhaHindIII, thereby
introducing BamHI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5'and 3'-terminus, respectively. The purified fhaB upstream
fragment was cloned into plasmid pSK. The resulting plasmid pSK-FP was digested with BamHI and 5'-end labelled
with [γ-32P]-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The
labelled promoter fragment was excised from the plasmid
by HindIII digestion, purified by gel electrophoresis and
eluted in 4 ml elution buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/100

mM EDTA, 300 mM sodium acetate, 0.2% SDS). The
eluted probe was then extracted with phenol/chloroform
(1:1, v/v) and ethanol precipitated. Binding reaction mixtures contained various concentrations of BvgABH protein
and approximately 100,000 cpm of labelled DNA probe
in 50 µl of 1 × binding buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 2
mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, v/
v). The samples were incubated 20 min at room temperature and then the nucleolytic reactions were initiated by
the addition of 1 U DNase I in 1 × binding buffer. After 1
min digestions were terminated by the addition of 140 µl
stop buffer (192 mM sodium acetate, 0.14% SDS, 62 µg
ml-1 yeast tRNA). The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v), ethanol precipitated and run
on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel. A G+A
sequencing reaction was also conducted in parallel with
the labelled DNA probe and subjected to electrophoresis
on the same gel [42].
