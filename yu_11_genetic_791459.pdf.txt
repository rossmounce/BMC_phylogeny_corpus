Abstract
Introduction: Estrogen forms a complex with the estrogen receptor (ER) that binds to estrogen response elements
(EREs) in the promoter region of estrogen-responsive genes, regulates their transcription, and consequently
mediates physiological or tumorigenic effects. Thus, sequence variants in EREs have the potential to affect the
estrogen-ER-ERE interaction. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that genetic variations of EREs are
associated with breast cancer development.
Methods: This case-control study involved 815 patients of Asian descent with incident breast cancer and 821
healthy female controls. A total of 13,737 ERE sites in the whole genome predicted by a genome-wide
computational algorithm were blasted with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequences. Twenty-one SNPs
located within 2,000 bp upstream or within introns 1 and 2 of putative genes and with a minor allele frequency
greater than 5% were identified and genotyped. Frequencies of SNPs were compared between cases and controls
to identify SNPs associated with cancer susceptibility.
Results: A significant combined effect of rs12539530, an ERE SNP in intron 2 of NRCAM which codes for a cell
adhesion molecule, and SNPs of ESR1, the gene coding for ER, on breast cancer risk was found. Interestingly, this
combined effect was more significant in women who had experienced a longer period of lifetime estrogen
exposure, supporting a hormonal etiology of this SNP in breast tumorigenesis.
Conclusions: Our findings provide support for a role of genetic variation in ERE-ESR1 in determining susceptibility
of breast cancer development.

Introduction
The roles of estrogen receptor a (ERa) in initiating
tumor development in breast cancer, regulating progression and determining therapeutic protocols and efficacy
are well documented [1-3]. Although ERa can be activated in an estrogen-independent manner, the classical
activation mechanism involves ERa binding to estrogen
and other coactivator proteins to form the estrogenbound ER complex, which functions as a transcriptional
regulator [4,5]. The DNA-binding domain of ERa binds
to estrogen response elements (EREs) in the promoter
region of estrogen-responsive genes, activating or

repressing their transcription and consequently mediating physiological or tumorigenic effects. Given that
sequence variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), located in the promoters of genes have the
potential to affect the protein (transcription factor)-DNA
(promoter) interaction, resulting in altered expression of
target genes [6,7], we decided that it was meaningful to
examine the hypothesis that genetic variations of EREs
might be associated with breast cancer development.
Early work on the Xenopus vitellogenin gene identified
a minimal ERE core sequence of 5’-GGTCANNNTGACC-3’ [8]. Since then, several computational
approaches have been used to map EREs on a genomewide level on the basis of the presence of EREs within
promoter proximal regions [9,10]. By specifically

focusing on promoter regions, 12,515 EREs have been
identified in the human genome [10-12]. To distinguish
between real binding sites and noise, several attempts
have been made to improve the specificity of prediction.
For instance, by eliminating EREs that are not conserved
between the human and mouse genomes, the number of
gene proximal EREs has been reduced to 660 [10,11]. In
this study, we used PReMod [13], a new database of
genome-wide cis-regulatory modules, to predict all possible EREs in the genome. The prediction algorithm of
PReMod takes into account the fact that, in higher
eukaryotes, cis-regulatory regions often contain several
phylogenetically conserved binding sites for different
transcription factors [13,14], and thus it has proven to
be more reliable than other methods. Using the SNPs of
the human genome available in databases, we searched
for SNPs within these genome-wide predicted EREs and
explored their association with breast cancer.

Materials and methods
Study participants

This case-control study is part of an ongoing cooperative study aimed at understanding the causes of breast
cancer in Taiwan. Breast cancer in Taiwan is characterized by low incidence, early tumor onset, hormone
dependency and novel genomic alterations [15-17]. We
studied 815 female breast cancer patients with pathologically confirmed incident primary breast cancer seen
at the Tri-Service General Hospital or the Changhua
Christian Hospital between March 2002 and August
2007. The 821 healthy female controls were selected
from among women attending the health examination
clinics of the same hospitals during the same period.
The characteristics of these study participants have
already been described in detail [18-21], and some participants (551 patients and 727 controls) have recently
been genotyped for polymorphism of ESR1 [21], the
gene coding for the ER. This study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of the Institutional Review
Board of the Academia Sinica, Taiwan, and informed
consent was obtained from all study participants before
the collection of epidemiologic data by personal interview. Considerations regarding methodological issues
in the present study (such as study design, sampling
scheme, and potential bias) have been described in
detail previously [18-21].
Questionnaire

Experienced research nurses were assigned to administer
a structured questionnaire to both patients and controls.
The information collected has been described, and the
validity of the questionnaire has been addressed and
confirmed, in our previous studies [18-21].

Specimen collection and SNP selection and genotyping

At the end of the interview, blood was taken for DNA
isolation and genotyping. All samples were examined by
laboratory personnel who were blinded to the case/control status of specimens. DNA was extracted from the
peripheral blood samples of patients and controls using
DNA purification kits (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
The PReMod database is a genome-wide/transcription
factor-wide collection of more than 100,000 computational predicted transcriptional regulatory modules
within the human genome [13,14]. These modules are
specific sequences potentially regulated by 229 transcription factor families, and the PReMod algorithm predicts that a total of 13,737 sites within the human
genome are bound and/or regulated by the ER [13,14].
We compared these sites with conventional SNP databases [22-24] and identified ER-binding sites potentially
harboring SNPs. The following three criteria were then
used to determine the SNPs to be genotyped: (1)
because of statistical considerations (that is, consideration of study power), the minor allele frequency of the
selected SNPs had to be higher than 0.05; (2) because of
biological considerations, the selected SNPs had to be
located within 2,000 bp upstream or located within
introns 1 and 2 of putative genes; and (3) because of
technical considerations, SNPs having the potential to
yield a false signal using the iPLEX high-throughput
genotyping platform were excluded. As a result, a total
of 21 SNPs were chosen for genotyping.
SNPs were genotyped in all samples using Sequenom
iPLEX technology (Sequenom, Hamburg, Germany).
Positive, negative and duplicate controls were included
on all plates, with genotypes being autocalled by specialized software (MassARRAY Typer version 3.4; Sequenom) and subsequently confirmed by visual assessment
of the data. All assays were performed by individuals
blinded to the case-control status of the samples. As a
quality control, we repeated the genotyping on 10% of
the samples, and all genotype scoring was performed
and checked separately by one reviewer who was unaware of the case-control status. The concordance rate
for replicate samples was 100%.
Statistical analysis

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the risk factors for breast cancer in this series of
study participants, and the odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated. For individual ERE SNPs, genotype frequencies
were assessed for departure from the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium using either a c2 goodness-of-fit test or a
Fisher’s exact test. The c2 test for a 2 × 3 contingency
table was used to compare genotype frequency between

Yu et al. Breast Cancer Research 2011, 13:R13

patients and controls. To take account of multiple comparisons, these associations were also assessed using the
permutation test provided in the Haploview software
tool (Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Harvard University, Cambridge, MA,
USA), run using 10,000 permutations. The association
of susceptibility genotypes and breast cancer risk was
further evaluated with simultaneous consideration of
established risk factors for breast cancer or other significant risk factors in multivariate logistic regression models. Biologic plausibility was the most important
criterion for inclusion of variables in the model. Therefore, we included all established risk factors for breast
cancer in the statistical models: age, family history of
breast cancer, age at menarche, parity and age at first
full-term pregnancy (FFTP). Adjusted ORs (aORs) and
95% CIs for genotypes were then estimated.
We made use of the information on the ESR1 polymorphism in our study participants that we published
recently [21] and explored the effect of a possible ESR1ERE interaction or estrogen-ESR1-ERE interaction in
determining breast cancer development. A combination
of the joint method and stratified analysis [18-21] was
applied to determine whether this interaction between
ESR1 and ERE was associated with breast cancer formation. A joint effect of ESR1-ERE on increased breast cancer risk was explored using conventional logistic
regression, a test evaluating whether a statistically significant increase in risk was observed with specific combinations of putative high-risk genotypes in these SNPs
(measured by the b estimates from this regression
model). In addition, we stratified our study participants
on the basis of ESR1 genotype and examined whether
breast cancer risk associated with ERE SNPs was particularly significant in specific ESR1 genotype subsets of
women. Because we were especially interested in the relationship between the joint effect of ESR1-ERE and breast
cancer risk within categories of risk factors representing
different levels of estrogen exposure, we performed stratified analysis to test this hypothesis. Therefore, if the identified joint effect of ESR1-ERE SNPs initiated breast
cancer by the formation of the estrogen-ER complex,
then the relationship between breast cancer risk and the
joint effect would not be the same in women who had
experienced different lengths of estrogen exposure. This
was evaluated by calculating the risk (aOR) of breast cancer associated with the joint effect of ESR1-ERE SNPs in
women with a longer or shorter period of total estrogen
exposure. For menopausal women, total estrogen exposure was calculated using the formula (age at menopause
- age at menarche - years of full-term pregnancy) and, for
premenopausal women, age at menopause in this formula
was replaced by age at recruitment into this study.

Results
The risk profile of breast cancer in our study participants was similar to that found in our previous studies
[18-21] and in other breast cancer studies. The development of breast cancer was found to be highly associated
with reproductive risk factors, including early menarche,
nulliparity, lower number of full-term pregnancies
(FTPs) and older age at FFTP (Table 1). Compared to
controls, patients were younger at menarche (≤ 14 years
vs. >14 years, aOR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.96) and older
at FFTP (>23 years vs. ≤ 23 years, aOR, 1.30; 95% CI,
1.00 to 1.69). Significant protection was conferred by a
history of FTP (parous women vs. nulliparous women,
aOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.97) and a greater number
of FTPs (history of more than two FTPs vs. history of
two or fewer FTPs, aOR, 0.46, 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61). No
association was found between cancer risk and a history
of oral contraceptive use or between cancer risk and
body mass index. Significant risk factors were included
in the multivariate logistic regression models when we
examined the association between SNPs and cancer risk.
More importantly, these significant associations between
reproductive risk factors and breast cancer reveal the
importance of the estrogen-related etiology of breast
cancer in our participants, providing the opportunity to
examine the contribution of EREs during breast
tumorigenesis.
A total of 13,737 sites (274,740 bp of DNA) in the
whole genome were predicted to be ERE-related
sequences using the PReMod algorithm. After blasting
these data with online information available from SNP
data sets (University of California, Santa Cruz, National
Center for Biotechnology Information and HapMap),
322 ER-binding sites were identified as potentially harboring SNPs. One hundred ten of these 322 SNPs were
found to contain no variant allele in the Chinese population, resulting in 212 SNPs, 21 of which met our criteria and were genotyped in patients and controls
(Figure 1).
To determine the breast tumorigenic contribution of
ERE SNPs, we examined whether the genotypic distribution of individual SNPs differed between the cases and
controls (Table S1 in Additional file 1). The frequencies
of all SNPs in the controls agreed with those expected
on the basis of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, suggesting that genotyping error was relatively unlikely.
The result for the genotypic analysis of two SNPs
(rs12539530 and rs9527676) was important, as it showed
that women carrying the homozygous variant genotype
had an significantly increased OR (P < 0.05) compared
with women carrying the homozygous wild-type genotype, as well as that the carrying of one additional risk
allele was associated with a significant increase in risk

(Table S1 in Additional file 1). The possibility of falsepositives due to multiple testing is less likely, because
the permutation test showed on the basis of 10,000 random permutations that these two associations were borderline significant or significant (P = 0.08 and P = 0.03,
respectively) (Table S1 in Additional file 1). Both SNPs
are located in regulatory regions of genes coding for cell
adhesion molecules, as rs12539530 is located in intron 2
of NRCAM, a gene coding for a neuron-related cell
adhesion molecule, and rs9527676 is located in intron 1
of PCDH17, a gene coding for protocadherin-17. To
gain initial clues for further analysis, we examined the
expression of these two genes in breast cancer cell lines.
To this end, we checked the expression of NRCAM and
PCDH17 in breast cancer cell lines expressing ESR1
(MCF-7 cells) or not expressing ESR1 (MDA-MB-231
cells) and examined whether the expression of these
putative ER-regulated genes is ER-dependent. The
results for NRCAM were more promising, as they
showed that this gene could be expressed in an ER-positive breast cancer cell (Figure 2), which is consistent

with previous findings using microarray technology
[25,26]. In addition, cell-cell adhesion, in which NRCAM
is known to play a part, has been well documented as
being involved in cancer formation [27,28]. All of these
lines of evidence support the biological plausibility of
our findings, suggesting that rs12539530, found in an
ERE-related sequence and possibly regulating NRCAM
expression, is associated with breast cancer
susceptibility.
The well-known mechanism in which ER binds to EREs
to mediate the expression of ER-regulated genes [2-4]
prompted us to speculate whether the SNPs of EREs
and ESR1 might be jointly associated with breast cancer.
We made use of the information on the ESR1 genotype
of our study participants that we published recently [21]
and examined this possibility using both stratified analysis and the joint method. Three SNPs (rs3778609,
rs12665044, and rs827421) located in one cluster in
intron 1 within the sequence coding for the activation
function (AF)-1 domain of the ER and one SNP
(rs7739506) located in intron 4 within the sequence

coding for the AF-2/ligand-binding domain have previously been found to show significant or borderline significant associations with breast cancer susceptibility in
our population [21]. If this ERE SNP were linked to
breast cancer susceptibility via the suspected ER-related
mechanism, the association between rs12539530 and
breast cancer would differ between women harboring
different ESR1 genotypes. Our findings are consistent
with this speculation, and the association between highrisk genotypes of rs12539530 and an increased breast
cancer risk was significant in only one subset of women
carrying specific genotypes of ESR1, but not in the other
subset (Table S2 in Additional file 1). Furthermore, on
the basis of a very stringent multiplicative model, the
borderline significance P values for the interaction
between rs12539530 and rs827421 (P = 0.07) and
between rs12539530 and rs7739506 (P = 0.09) are in
line with the suggestion that an interaction between
rs12539530 and ESR1 polymorphism is linked to breast
cancer risk. To confirm this interaction, we used the
joint method and calculated the risk of breast cancer
associated with both rs12539530 and ESR1 SNPs using a
set of dummy variables representing different combinations of genotypes of ESR1 and rs12539530. In contrast
to the increased, but not significant, risk associated with
either a high-risk genotype of ESR1 or rs12539530
alone, the greatest risk was found in those patients harboring high-risk genotypes of both rs12539530 and

ESR1 SNPs in all women combined (Figure 3). More
interestingly, estrogen promotes breast tumorigenesis by
forming a complex with the ER which then binds to
EREs [1,2], and thus the relationship between breast cancer risk and the joint effect of rs12539530 and ESR1 polymorphism might be modified by estrogen exposure,
which is consistent with what we observed (Figure 3).
The risk of breast cancer associated with the joint effect
of polymorphisms of rs12539530 and ESR1 was evaluated
in different groups of women stratified by years of total
estrogen exposure and a significant and increased joint
effect was seen only in the subgroup of women with
more than 30 years of estrogen exposure (Figure 3). In
contrast, in the subset of women with less than 30 years
of estrogen exposure, the same joint effect was associated
with a nonsignificant aOR (Figure 3).

Discussion
Of the predicted ERE-related sequences found throughout the whole genome, the present study has identified
a genetic variation of rs12539530, a SNP located in the
putative ERE site in intron 2 of NRCAM, as an important factor in determining susceptibility to breast cancer

development. We attempted to address the possibility of
false-positives and the effects of multiple testing by
demonstrating a borderline significant P value in the
permutation test. Even so, given the lack of strongly significant results, the power of the present study should
be an issue of particular concern, and our suggestion
that rs12539530 is involved in determining breast cancer
susceptibility certainly needs to be confirmed in other
studies with larger sample sizes.
In considering whether our findings represent a true
association between this SNP in ERE and breast cancer, the most important issue is the interpretation of
the identified association between SNPs and the trait.
Because the SNP identified is in an intron, it does not
affect amino acid coding and therefore probably does
not directly affect protein function. In addition, the
observed association between breast cancer and this
SNP could be due to the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between this SNP and other SNPs in
exons (resulting in functional change) or in regulatory
regions (affecting the expression of these genes). However, the first of these two possibilities is less likely, as

we checked the LD block in which rs12539530 is
located in the Chinese population in HapMap [24],
which spans 22 kb in chromosome region 7q31, and
found that the whole block is within intron 2 of
NRCAM. In other words, no well-defined genes are in
the same haplotype block as this SNP. To address the
second possibility, we examined the sequence of this
LD block and found that it contains more than 200
predicted transcription factor binding sites, including
those for specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). After blasting these binding sites with
the sequences of 30 SNPs known to reside in this
block as reported by HapMap, some SNPs were found
to be located within these binding sites, so the second
possibility cannot be totally excluded. However, we are
prompted to suggest the breast tumorigenic contribution of rs12539530 on the basis of the findings that (1)
rs12539530 and ESR1 SNPs jointly increased breast
cancer susceptibility and (2) this joint effect was more
significant in women with a longer period of estrogen
exposure. In addition, this suggestion is mechanistically
plausible and is similar to the finding that rs10736303,

Yu et al. Breast Cancer Research 2011, 13:R13
http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/13/1/R13

the SNP generating a putative ERE in intron 2 of
FGFR2, has been identified as the most significant
gene determining breast cancer susceptibility in recent
genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [29-31]. In
addition, expression of NRCAM, the gene putatively
regulated by rs12539530, has been suggested to be
upregulated in ER-positive, but not in ER-negative,
breast cancer cell lines [25,26], and this hypothesis was
confirmed by the present study (Figure 2).
Recent GWASs based on technological advances in
high-throughput genotyping have provided information
regarding the LD of neighboring polymorphisms. These
GWASs have made possible the use of a few hundred
thousand SNPs as tags for all other variants, as well as
the biobanking of tens of thousands of specimens, allowing their immediate use in whole genome research.
These studies have led to the mapping of novel susceptibility loci for many common traits, including breast cancer [30,31]. Interestingly, none of these loci identified as
significant in determining breast cancer risk in GWASs
have been identified as significant in previous association
studies based on a candidate gene approach, and very few
of the genes involved in the most plausible mechanisms
of breast tumorigenesis, including those involved in DNA
repair and sex hormone synthesis and metabolism pathways, have been reported as important in GWASs.
Region 7q31, in which NRCAM is located, has never
been reported to be important with regard to breast cancer risk determination in GWASs. This might be partially
explained by the relatively low-penetrance effect of SNPs
of estrogen-regulating genes. Distinct from those alleles
identified by current GWAS, these polymorphic alleles of
estrogen-regulating genes would predispose carriers to
only a moderately increased risk of developing cancer.
Thus, the significance of such SNPs depends not only on
their own effect but also on the interaction between the
target genes and other functionally related genes (for
example, ESR1) or the promoting effect of reproductive
risk factors reflecting estrogen exposure. Our findings are
in line with this suggestion.
This study is a hybrid of candidate gene and genomewide approaches in which we took advantage of both
designs. The well-defined roles of the ER during breast
tumorigenesis makes it reasonable to assume that polymorphic genetic variants of EREs, central nodes in the ER
pathway, might underlie the variations seen between individuals in their susceptibility to breast cancer. This candidate mechanism lends critical support to the biological
plausibility and tumorigenic relevance of our findings. In
addition, our genotyping of SNPs on the basis of genomewide predicted EREs provided a unique opportunity to
comprehensively examine putative ERE sites without
depending on a prior hypothesis. The successful identification of rs12539530 by using these combined methods

Page 7 of 8

suggests that this is a promising approach to identifying
the breast tumorigenic contribution of EREs on a genomewide scale on the basis of information generated by recent
technological advances. For example, in our ongoing
study, we are exploring the breast tumorigenic role of
putative EREs identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation-based methods [25,32,33]. The simultaneous consideration of these ER-associated EREs and ER-regulating
genes that drive breast tumorigenesis might be critical in
the development of new anticancer drug targets and new
therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.

Conclusions
Though the promise of personalized medicine, in which
the risk and the course of diseases and the efficacy of
treatment protocols would be predicted on the basis of a
person’s genotype, must been tempered with caution,
validated molecular tests assessing the patient’s germline
DNA already drive therapeutic decision-making. On the
basis of the well-documented role of ER in breast cancer
development and progression, this study explored
whether genetic variations in EREs, the sequences bound
by ER to activate the transcriptional regulation of target
genes, are associated with susceptibility for breast cancer.
Notably, the ERE sites genotyped were based on genomewide prediction, providing a unique opportunity to comprehensively examine putative ERE sites without depending on a prior hypothesis. A significant combined effect
of rs12539530, an ERE SNP in intron 2 of NRCAM,
which codes for a cell adhesion molecule, and SNPs of
ESR1, the gene coding for ER, on breast cancer risk was
found. Our findings provide support for a role of ESR1ERE polymorphism in determining susceptibility of
breast cancer development. This knowledge will be helpful for directing the focus of future experimental studies.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2. Table S1 presents genotype
frequencies of sequence variants of estrogen response element (ERE)related sequences in breast cancer patients and controls and the
adjusted odds ratio (aOR) in relation to breast cancer risk. Table S2
presents breast cancer risk associated with genotypic polymorphism of
rs12539530, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the estrogen
response element (ERE)-related sequence, stratified by genotypes of ESR1,
the estrogen receptor gene.
