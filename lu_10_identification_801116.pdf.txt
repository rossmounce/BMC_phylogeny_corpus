Identification and analysis of the germin-like
gene family in soybean
Mo Lu1, Ying-Peng Han1, Ji-Guo Gao2, Xiang-Jing Wang2*, Wen-Bin Li1*

Abstract
Background: Germin and germin-like proteins constitute a ubiquitous family of plant proteins. A role of some
family members in defense against pathogen attack had been proposed based on gene regulation studies and
transgenic approaches. Soybean (G. max L. Merr.) germin genes had not been characterized at the molecular and
functional levels.
Results: In the present study, twenty-one germin gene members in soybean cultivar ‘Maple Arrow’ (partial
resistance to Sclerotinia stem rot of soybean) were identified by in silico identification and RACE method (GmGER 1
to GmGER 21). A genome-wide analyses of these germin-like protein genes using a bioinformatics approach
showed that the genes located on chromosomes 8, 1, 15, 20, 16, 19, 7, 3 and 10, on which more disease-resistant
genes were located on. Sequence comparison revealed that the genes encoded three germin-like domains. The
phylogenetic relationships and functional diversity of the germin gene family of soybean were analyzed among
diverse genera. The expression of the GmGER genes treated with exogenous IAA suggested that GmGER genes
might be regulated by auxin. Transgenic tobacco that expressed the GmGER 9 gene exhibited high tolerance to
the salt stress. In addition, the GmGER mRNA increased transiently at darkness and peaked at a time that
corresponded approximately to the critical night length. The mRNA did not accumulate significantly under the
constant light condition, and did not change greatly under the SD and LD treatments.
Conclusions: This study provides a complex overview of the GmGER genes in soybean. Phylogenetic analysis
suggested that the germin and germin-like genes of the plant species that had been founded might be evolved
by independent gene duplication events. The experiment indicated that germin genes exhibited diverse expression
patterns during soybean development. The different time courses of the mRNAs accumulation of GmGER genes in
soybean leaves appeared to have a regular photoperiodic reaction in darkness. Also the GmGER genes were
proved to response to abiotic stress (such as auxin and salt), suggesting that these paralogous genes were likely
involved in complex biological processes in soybean.

Background
Germin is a protein marker that was first discovered in
the germination of wheat seeds [1]. Subsequently, germin and germin-like proteins (GLPs) were found in
other monocotyledonous, several dicotyledonous,
angiosperms, gymnospermous plants, a myxomycete
(slime mould) and Physarum polycephalum [2-10].

Germin relatives have also been identified in fern spores,
prokaryotes and animals [11,12].
The germin family comprises a group of proteins
belonging to a superfamily. All germins contain the germin motif that gives rise to a predicted b-barrel core
involved in metal binding [13]. Most of them share biochemical attributes such as seed storage proteins, globulins and sucrose-binding, though they differ in their
tissue specificities and enzyme activities [14-18]. The
germin genes seemed to be involved in various important processes including development, osmotic regulation, photoperiodic oscillation, defence and apoptosis
[19], and also founded to be associated with cell wall
deposition [5,7,20,21].

Germin has an oxalate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.4) activity [1].
There has been growing evidence that germin encoded
an enzyme that degraded oxalate to CO2 and H2O2 and
also releases Ca++ in some plant species. The degraded
residual H2O2 plays different roles: a molecular signal
for the induction of defence mechanisms, cross-linking
of polymers in the extracellular matrix synthesis [9],
and a direct antimicrobial effect, such as lignifications,
to reinforce the cell walls [22-24]. The germin protein
in monocotyledonous appeared to have an oxalate oxidase activity [21], but the germin-like proteins in dicotyledonous plants did not appear to have oxalate
oxidase activity by 2010 [19]. For example, wheat and
barley germin genes were found in the apoplast and
the cytoplasm of germinating embryo cells with oxalate
oxidase activity [21]. Two genes (gf-2.8 and gf-3.8) and
a transcript (cDNA) of wheat germin have been
sequenced [1].
Some germin genes may have functions other than
oxalate oxidase activity [25]. Germin-like gene mRNAs
have been found in leaves, cotyledons, stems, roots,
embryos, flowers, seeds, and some were produced in
response to environmental stimuli, depending on the
species or the genes under consideration. Several evidences suggested that some GLPs have functions in general plant defence responses [26]. For instance, infection
with pathogens, feeding of insects or application of chemicals such as salicylic acid, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
or ethylene [27-32] could increase the expression of
GLPs. In wheat and barley, transcription of at least one
germin gene was induced upon a fungal infection [33].
Endogenous factors also controlled the expression of
some germin genes since transcription of wheat germin
gf-2.8 gene is stimulated by auxins [20]. Transient overexpression and transient silencing of certain barley GLP
genes resulted in enhanced resistance to the powdery
mildew fungus [17]. The promoter variant of rice oxalate oxidase genes played a role in resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae [34]. For some subfamilies, transient and
stable expression showed a superoxide dismutase activity
(EC1.15.1.1) of the encoded protein [31]. Silencing of a
Nicotiana attenuata GLP increased the performance of
an herbivore [30]. mRNA levels of mustard (Brassica
napus) and a closely related Arabidopsis germin gene
fluctuated during the circadian cycle [5,8].
Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) De Bary is a serious fungal disease of soybean. Since oxalic acid is a major pathogenic factor of
SSR, transgenic soybean capable of degrading oxalic acid
may be resistant to the pathogen [35]. To date, the
wheat gf-2.8 gene has been studied on resistance to the
oxalate-secreting pathogen S. sclerotiorum. Results
showed transgenic soybean with the wheat germin gene
greatly reduced disease progression and lesion length

following cotyledon and stem inoculation with S. sclerotiorum, indicating that the germin gene products conferred resistant to Sclerotinia stem rot [35].
The GLPs with mostly unknown function in plant
genomes [26] had been classified into subfamilies
[36,37]. For example, the true germin subfamily, such as
wheat and barley germins, included proteins with oxalate oxidase activity. In contrast, both GLP subfamilies 1
and 2 contained examples of proteins with superoxide
dismutase (SOD) activity. Subfamily 3 included the
phosphodiesterase (EC3.1) activity described above, and
more subdivisions had been proposed recently [38]. A
key feature of the GLP-related subfamilies, including the
germins [37], was the conservation of a motif derived
from that of the cupin superfamily [36]. In barley, five
GLP subfamilies have been described and named
HvGER1 to HvGER5. In Physcomitrella patens germinlike proteins, two novel clades have been found, named
bryophyte-subfamilies 1 and 2 [38].
In contrast to the advanced knowledge of the structure, cell biology and expression features of barley and
wheat germins and GLPs, less was known about soybean
germin and germin-like genes by 2010. In the present
work, nearly 50,000 sequenced and annotated ESTs of
soybean were analyzed to find GmGER-like sequences
by amino acid sequence similarity, and GmGER-like
sequences were elongated by RACE. Their locations
were determined and compared to disease resistance
QTL, and both cluster and phylogenetic analyses of the
germin-like proteins were performed to describe the
variations in the soybean gene family. The abiotic factors (auxin-IAA, salt, light treatments) was tested on
GmGER genes to evaluate the complex biological processes related to soybean development.

Results
Mining of germin-like EST sequences from soybean
database and the determination of full-length cDNA
sequences of GmGER genes

123 soybean germin and germin-like EST sequences
were detected by BLASTP and TBLASTN searches
against the GenBank database. In addition, 204 nucleic
acid sequences (both of the genes and ESTs) of germin
and germin-like genes from 30 other plant species in
the databases were collected for comparison to soybean
data [Figure 1, Table 1 and 2]. After subsequent survey
of soybean genomic data, twenty-one soybean germinlike ESTs or full length of cDNA genes were obtained.
Of them two full-length mRNA was isolated by RACE.
These genes were named as GmGER 1 to GmGER 21
and registered in NCBI GenBank [Table 2]. The open
reading frames (ORFs) of the germin-like protein encoding genes were complementary DNA, and each gene had
one exon. Most of the genes were transcribed from a

species. Bootstrap values were placed at the nodes and the scale bar corresponded to 0.1 estimated nucleic acid substitutions per site. Five
major classes (I to V) were shown.

single exon. The analyses of germin-like gene domain
revealed that all of the GmGER genes had the similar
domains that were lineated up closely each other [Figure 2]
except the different position. The structure contained three
boxes that represented the germin domains. The overall
analyses revealed that the 21 proteins that contained the
germin domains formed a single germin-like family in
soybean.
Chromosomal locations of GmGER genes

Twenty-one genes of the soybean germin-like proteins
were distributed on chromosomes (CH) 8, 1, 15, 20, 16,
19, 7, 3 and 10, respectively. An example of integration
of the genetic and physical map with genetic markers
for a detailed region of ~8 cM length on linkage group
(LG) is illustrated in Figure 3. Among them, GmGER 7
was located at 106.7 cM on LG A2 (CH 8). GmGER 5

was located at 44.7 cM on LG D1a (CH 1). GmGER 10
and GmGER 15 were located at 43.0 and 44.6 cM on
LG E (CH 15). GmGER 11, GmGER 12, GmGER 18 and
GmGER 19 were located at 107.8, 103.2, 48.3 and 108.7
cM on LG I (CH 20), respectively. GmGER 2, GmGER
3 and GmGER 4 were located at 32.1, 30.1 and 30.4 cM
on LG J (CH 16). GmGER 14 and GmGER 20 were
located at 30.9 cM on LG L (CH 19). GmGER 6 and
GmGER 9 were located at 23.6 and 30.3 cM on LG M
(CH 7). GmGER 1 and GmGER 21 were located at
104.5 and 105.3 cM on LG N (CH 3). GmGER 6,
GmGER 16 and GmGER 17 were located at 83.3, 50.3
and 53.5 cM on LG O (CH 10). There were several
locations where single germin gene was dispersed and
other genes appeared clustered. From the alignments
between genetic markers and FPC contigs, few discrepancies of marker order between physical and genetic

maps were obvious. The 21 genes distributed to 17 FPC
contigs. Some of the genes in each of the clusters were
transcribed from the same strand, indicating that they
might have arisen by direct duplication [Figure 3]. However, each gene in the cluster had miner difference in
the nucleic acid structure, which might happen during
soybean evolution.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree for
soybean germin gene family

To uncover the common characteristics of proteins in
germin-like gene families, the predicted protein
sequences of the 21 soybean GmGER genes was compared [Figure 2]. All these proteins possessed one or
two N-glycosylation consensus sequences. Three other
conserved regions were found and might have important
functions in these proteins. However, no precise function had been attributed to them to date. The three
domains were located in the 3’ end of the larger protein
coding germin genes. The structure consensus sequence
of motif A was HTHPRATEILTVLEGTLYVGF with 21
amino acids. The structure consensus sequence of motif
B was KVLNKGDVFVFPEGLIHFQFN with 21 amino
acids. The structure consensus sequence of motif C was
[N/S]SQNPGIVFVPLTLFG with 16 amino acids.
A phylogenetic relationship of GmGER with the paralogous RNA helicases was inferred by constructing the
neighbor-joining tree. The tree topology was found to
be well aligned with the 21 evolutionary lineage among
soybean derived from a broad array of clades. Also, the
binary alignment analysis of the 21 GmGER genes with
each predicted paralogous genes yielded consistent
results supported by high sequence identity values. A
RNA helicase protein, GmGER 2 and GmGER 20 exhibited the highest sequence identity with GmGER 13 and
GmGER 14. GmGER 6 and GmGER 11 exhibited the
highest sequence identity with GmGER 12. GmGER 1
exhibited the highest sequence identity with GmGER 21.
GmGER 16 exhibited the highest sequence identity with
GmGER 17. GmGER 8 exhibited the highest sequence
identity with GmGER 9. GmGER 7 exhibited the highest
sequence identity with GmGER 15 [Figure 4]. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all the GmGER genes were
relatively tightly clustered together. Notably, these
sequences were most closely related with those proteins
sharing the same domains. The genes in the same group
were closed to each other and far off the genes from the
other groups. Therefore, the genes in the three groups
might originate from different ancestors.
Comparison of soybean germin family with other species
by phylogenetic tree

To study the phylogeny of the GmGER gene family, the
complete germin protein sequences of different species

Bootstrap values were placed at the nodes and the scale bar
corresponded to 0.2 estimated nucleic acid substitutions per site.
Three major classes (I, II and III) were shown.

were collected. Redundant or highly similar sequences
were removed and a phylogenetic tree with 105 complete GLP sequences was constructed with the neighbor-joining method [Figure 1]. The results showed a
complex evolutionary history existed with recent gene
duplications of soybean due to the difficulty to identify
orthologs of particular soybean germins in other species.
However, subfamilies of germin genes had been
described. A few clades [5] representing different species
emerged. The germin-like gene family proteins in soybean and in other species were apparently divided into
different clades [Figure 1]. The relationship among gene
lineages were roughly congruent with established phylogenetic relationship among taxa. For example, relationships among gene lineages in the clade I subfamily
corresponded closely with phylogenetic relationships
among Arabidopsis, rice, Pisum sativum, Vitis vinifera,
Hordeum vulgare, Triticum aestivum, Atriplex lentiformis, Musa acuminate, Rhododendron mucronatum, barley and wheat. The results from phylogenetic tree
suggested that the conservation of tissue specific expression pattern existed within a few subfamilies.
The GmGER genes fell into five major clades. Clade I
contained the largest number of the GLP subfamilies,
including 15 members of the 21 GmGER genes.
GmGER 1 was closely related to Vitis vinifera and
Pisum sativum. GmGER 2 was closely related to Hordeum vulgare. GmGER 3 was closely related to Hordeum vulgare. GmGER 4 was closely related to Atriplex
lentiformis and Musa acuminate. GmGER 6, GmGER
11, GmGER 12, GmGER 13, GmGER 14 and GmGER
20 were closely related to Triticum aestivum. GmGER

16 and GmGER 17 were closely related to Rhododendron mucronatum. GmGER 19 was closely related to
Pisum sativum. GmGER 21 was closely related to Pisum
sativum and Vitis vinifera.
Clade II did not contain any GmGER gene. Included
in this clade were Arabiopsis GLP gene members, two
rice GLP genes, four barley GLP genes, one wheat GLP
gene and three Lolium perenne GLP genes. This suggested that clade II was conserved in grasses. Clade III
contained four members, including GmGER 5 gene, two
Arabiopsis GLP genes and one Physcomitrella patens
subsp. patens GLP gene. Clade III was conserved in
both dicot and monocot plants. Clade IV contained six
members, GmGER 7, GmGER 15, three Pinus GLP
genes and one Larix x marschlinsii (hybrid larch) GLP
gene. It seemed that GmGER 7 and GmGER 15 were
closely related to Pinus GLP genes. GmGER 8, GmGER
9 and GmGER 10 were covered in clade V, in that GLPs
were widely dispersed in different plant species. GmGER
9 and Phaseolus vulgaris GLP genes were homologously
grouped. GmGER 10 and Pisum sativum GLP gene
were closely related to Chimonanthus praecox GLP
gene and Vitis vinifera GLP gene. The three GmGER
genes were also closely related to Beta vulgaris GLP
gene and Linum usitatissimum cv. GLP genes.

(SD) treatments, were examined by quantitative realtime RT-PCR. The level of GmGER mRNA showed an
obvious increase and a decrease during 48 h of continuous darkness (peaked at 12 h and 36 h), suggesting
the existence of a circadian clock feature [Figure 6].
The expression of GmGER mRNA was not clear during the continuous light for 48 h. The level of GmGER
mRNA showed a moderate changes in SD and LD
treatments (SD treatment being higher than LD treatment) [Figure 6].
Salt tolerance of transgenic tobacco with GmGER 9 gene

Both fresh weight and stem length of transgenic tobacco
plants were significantly higher than in the WT plants
after exposure to 150, 250 and 350 mM of NaCl [Figure
7B, 7C, 7D, 7E and 7F]. Under the treatment of 350
mM NaCl, the WT plants grow smaller and yellower,
whereas, the GmGER 9 transformed plants grow taller
[Figure 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D]. There were no differences
in fresh weight and stem length between WT and transgenic plants without NaCl supplement [Figure 7A, 7E
and 7F].

Discussion
Germin genes form a large family and their functions
are still under studying. In this study, we identified 21
germin genes of soybean. The analyses of gene domain
revealed that the unknown GLP gene family and their
functions might be determined according to the presence of germin domain. Interestingly, the predicted
model almost perfectly conformed to the determined
structure of individual domain of the seed storage globulins, canavalin and phaseolin that showed a significant
sequence similarity with germins [39,40]. These proteins
contain two or three similar domains that might have
evolved following gene duplication events from a common ancestral gene or domain [40,41].

mRNA expression of GmGER genes in response to auxinIAA

The expression of the GmGER genes was dramatically
stimulated within 8 h after the addition of IAA, maintained for 12 h, and then decreased gradually, according
to the results of real-time RT-PCR [Figure 5], suggesting
that GmGER genes might be regulated by auxin.

To date, no germin gene was identified in soybean.
Thus, the 21 GmGER genes found in the present work
were thought as the novel, species-specific proteins of
soybean. Comparative analyses revealed that these evolutionary related germin genes shared very similar exon
structures, suggested the close phylogenetic relationships
among the soybean germin genes.
The common structural features of germin-like proteins included: conserved structural elements, secretory
transit peptides, protein glycosylation sites and regions
of conserved sequence similarity [36]. According to the
review of Carter and Thornburg [36], the most important conserved structural feature among the GLPs is a
conserved amino acid sequence termed the germin box.
The consensus pattern is: GxxxxHxHPxAxEh, where x
is any amino acid and h is a hydrophobic amino acid.
Mature germins and GLPs all contain approximately
200 amino acids in length and the germin box occurs
near the middle for all proteins in this family. In soybean, the conserved region B was found in all the 21
germin genes. Conserved region A enriched in hydrophobic amino acids always followed this peptide
(GxxxxHxHPxAxEh) [Figure 2]. Another conserved
region A was localized in the amino terminal part of the
mature proteins, and strongly conserved in all the germins but not in the spherulins. It is likely that the heptapeptide sequence [L/V]QDFCV[A/G], found in all
germin-like proteins examined, was of importance in the
biochemical functions of these proteins. A third putative
conserved region C underlined in Figure 2 was [V/M][F/
K]P[Q/K/I]G[L][V/I/L]HFQ[K/L/Q/I]N[V/N/I]G. Two
His residues and a Glu residue in Motif A, together
with a His residue in Motif C, act as ligands for the
binding of a manganese ion at the active site of the
archetypal germin, cupin [42]. In our result, motif A
was HTHPRATEILTVLEGTLYVGF with 21 amino
acids, motif B was KVLNKGDVFVFPEGLIHFQFN with
21 amino acids, and motif C was [N/S]SQNPGI
VFVPLTLFG with 16 amino acids. The 21 GmGER
genes all have the germin activity, exhibiting diverse
expression patterns during soybean development, a regular photoperiodical reaction in darkness, response to
abiotic stress (such as auxin and salt), as we have proved
in this paper.
One question that remained to be answered was
whether all germin or germin-like genes of soybean carried out the same functions and were regulated in the
same way like in other species. Multi-sequence alignments of GLPs in barley and Arabidopsis, as well in
other plant species showed some overlaps of multigene
family structure, which would be helpful in functional
annotation and the study of the evolutionary relationships among the genes [31]. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we concluded that the GmGER genes did not

Page 11 of 15

share a common expression pattern. Germin genes were
functionally diverse but structurally related [43]. Large
differences existed among several members of germin
gene family. It was clear that soybean GmGER genes
were homologous to the dicotyledon proteins in the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 1). Sequence analyses revealed
that GmGER 8, 9 and 10 were distinct from the other
GmGER genes. The GmGER 8 and 9 were located on
the same chromosome 7, suggesting that they might be
divergence from a common ancestor. Likewise, the
GmGER 2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 20 were closely
related to each other. It was possible that they were
recently descended from a common ancestor gene that
evolved into different forms.
Germin and the GLP gene family could be divided
into two distinct groups. The members in one group
(germins) had relatively homogeneous sequences [44],
meanwhile, the members in another group (GLPs) were
much more numerous and showed high sequence divergence [45]. GLPs could be further divided into three
subgroups based upon sequence conservation [37]. In
this paper, the GmGER genes were also divided into
three subgroups based upon sequence conservation. Systematic investigation of soybean germin gene family
would be useful for defining origins of the germin and
germin-like gene family. Although the functional significance of all these elements remained to be tested, a variety of regulatory mechanisms acting on the transcript
abundance were found. The germin genes in rice have
been confirmed to be expressed in all types of tissues
and could be induced by biotic or abiotic stresses. Many
of the stress-induced germin genes were physically colocalized with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for disease
resistance, and the emerged evidence suggested that
microRNAs might regulate their transcript abundances
[46,47]. Oxalate oxidase could confer to enhance resistance to Sclerotinia blight in peanut [41]. In transformed
sunflower, the expression of oxalate oxidase resulted in
the induction of plant defense proteins [48]. In tissue
sections derived from pea nodules, PsGER1 was shown
to be the first known germin-like protein with superoxide dismutase activity [49].
A significant promotion of the expression of GmGER
mRNA was achieved by quantitative real-time RT-PCR
under the supplement of IAA in medium. As IAA is
involved mainly in the regulation of cell elongation and
stimulating cell division [50], this result suggested that
GmGER genes might mediate the stimulating effect of
auxin on cell division. It should be noticed that,
although the GmGER gene responded to IAA, the affinity was unknown, which made it difficult to be certain
that the GmGER gene was involved in auxin signaling,
especially without additional physiologic evidence.
Therefore, it should be investigated furthermore.

Meanwhile, the assay of salt stress indicated that the
transgenic seedlings of tobacco with GmGER 9 gene
showed improved salt tolerance compared to the WT
plants (Figure 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D, 7E and 7F), confirming
that the GmGER 9 gene had a positive response to the
salt condition. Salt stress could cause oxidative damage
in plant, such as protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation [51]. Therefore, GmGER 9 gene remained a potential to improve the salt tolerance in transgenic plants.
Different families of genes have been reported to be
associated with plant photoperiod including germin
genes [19]. A significant difference was observed in the
response to light/dark cycles by various genes and different species. The level of mRNA of Sinapis alba L.
undergoes circadian oscillation during light/dark cycles
with a maximum about 12 h after the light was turned
on. This peak of mRNA accumulation occurred in light
treatment [52]. By contrast, the level of GmGER mRNA
reached its maximum about 12 h after light was turned
off in this study. The peak of mRNA accumulation
occurred during the dark period in darkness treatment
and changed sharply. In the light treatment the mRNA
had almost no expression. In the LD treatment, the
mRNA level had mild change less than in SD treatment.
The value of mRNA was a little higher in SD treatment
than in LD treatment. These findings indicated that the
transcription of the GmGER genes greatly depended on
the duration of darkness.

Conclutions
In summary, 21 germin-like protein genes of soybean
were identified and analyzed in this study. The results
revealed that this novel family of germin-like proteins
might represent an important mechanism in soybean to
modulate diverse physiological and molecular processes.
These findings provided the groundwork to assist functional studies of this novel GmGER family, and an
opportunity to discover the roles of the germin family
proteins, to underlie regulatory mechanisms during
plant development and the responses to adverse environmental stimuli and to answer why several different
genes were required to carry out these functions. Future
studies using molecular, genetic, biochemical, physiological, and other approaches could provide insights into
understanding the functions and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of soybean germin genes in plant
defense responses and development.
Methods
Sequence data and database search

The nucleic acid sequences and EST sequences of germin and germin-like genes in Glycine max (L.) Merr.
and in other species were searched from the GenBank
database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/ with

Page 12 of 15

BLASTP and TBLASTN program in NCBI with e-value
10 [53]. Then all the sequence data of germin and germin-like genes were downloaded (EST sequences for
searching soybean cDNA and other nucleic acid
sequences for analyzing the relationship among soybean
germin genes). In an attempt to obtain all of the germin
and germin-like genes in soybean, the EST sequences
were used to search the soybean genomic DNA databases, Phytozome http://www.phytozome.net/soybean.
php. The predicted protein sequences of putative soybean germin family members were also downloaded
from these databases. The software Genescan web server
http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html was used for gene
prediction. Redundant hits were removed by manual
inspection. The InterProScan program http://www.ebi.
ac.uk/InterProScan/ was used to detect the germin and
germin-like domains.
Full-length cDNA sequences and chromosomal location of
germin genes

Here, a total of 123 soybean germin-like gene EST
sequences were downloaded from the GenBank database. The coding regions of soybean candidates were
used to perform a BLASTN search against all of the
ESTs. If the hits showed a complete identity over the
entire polypeptide, it was considered an entire and
active gene in soybean. All the sequences that had been
determined were used as query in BALSTN searches
against the soybean genome data http://www.phytozome.net/soybean.php. The sequences of the 20 soybean
linkage groups http://soybeanphysicalmap.org/[54] were
also used as query in BALSTN searches against the soybean genome data http://www.phytozome.net/soybean.
php. The two alignment results were used to calculate
with Blastm.pl (edited by our laboratory), then arranged
in Microsoft Office Excel 2003. The chart from these
data was drawn by Mapchart http://www.kyazma.nl/
index.php/mc.JoinMap/. The genes were placed by the
position on the genetic map and the physical map.
The 5’- and 3’-rapid amplification of cDNA ends
(RACE) was performed to obtain the 5’- and 3’ ends
encoding the additional sequence of soybean germin
genes. The SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit
(Clontech) was used following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Samples of 1 μg of total RNA from the
leaves of soybean ‘Maple arrow’ were used for reverse
transcription. The gene-specific primer GSP1 from the
antisense strand was designed for 5’-RACE, and the
gene-specific primer GSP2 from the sense strand was
used for 3’-RACE. All RACE PCR reactions were performed using the following protocol: 94°C for 30 s, 70°C
for 30 s and 72°C for 3 min for 5 cycles, followed by 94°
C for 30 s, 68°C for 30 s and 72°C for 3 min for 5
cycles, followed by 94°C for 30 s, 66°C for 30 s and 72°C

measured, and the stem lengths of tested seedlings were
also measured and compared.

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree
construction

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR

Multiple alignments of nucleic acid sequences were performed using ClustalW ([55]; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/index.html) with the following parameters: gap
opening penalty 10, gap extension penalty 1.0. The
PAM series was used for the protein weight matrix. The
results were represented with the help of the GeneDoc
software [56]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by
the Neighbor Joining method using the MEGA3.0 program [57]. Each analysis was carried out at least twice.
GmGER gene response to IAA stress

In order to evaluate GmGER gene response to IAA in
soybean development, ‘Maple arrow’ seedlings were surface sterilized and then placed on the soil under aseptic
condition, and kept in growth chamber under white
fluorescent light (600 umol m-2s-1, 16 h light/8 h dark)
at 25°C and 90% relative humidity. The seedlings without any treatment were used as the control. After germination for 7 days, the seedlings were transferred to
plates supplemented with dosed IAA (100 uM) and
grown for another 6 days. The seedlings were then
sampled and frozen for further analysis.
GmGER gene response to light/dark

Seeds of soybean ‘Maple arrow’ were surface sterilized
and then placed on the soil under aseptic condition and
then kept in growth chamber under white fluorescent
light (600 umol m-2s-1, 16 h light/8 h dark) at 25°C and
90% relative humidity. When the cotyledons had opened
maximally, the seedlings were subjected to one of the
four photoperiodic treatments: dark (continuous darkness up to 48 h), light (continuous light up to 48 h), SD
(short-day, 8 h light and 16 h dark), LD (long-day, 16 h
light and 8 h dark).
Salt tolerance assay

Seeds of transgenic tobacco with GmGER 9 gene were
surface sterilized and then placed on MS medium [58]
under aseptic condition and then kept in growth chamber under white fluorescent light (600 umol m-2s-1, 16 h
light/8 h dark) at 25°C and 90% relative humidity. In the
same time, the WT tobacco seeds were also planted on
MS medium as a control. After germination, seedlings
of transgenic plants and WT plants with similar size
were transferred to MS medium containing different
concentrations of NaCl (0, 150, 250 and 350 mM). After
30 d, the fresh weights of 5 to 10 seedlings from each
transgenic line and WT plants in each treatment were

Total RNA was isolated from the soybean leaves at 0, 4,
8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 48 hours after IAA treatment. The
amplification of selected genes was performed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with specific oligonucleotide
primers: forward primer (TTCCTCTTTGCTCTTGTC)
and reverse primer (AGTGTTTGTGGTGTTTCC),
using the first strand cDNA. DNase treatment was given
for removing contaminating genomic DNA from RNA
samples. The PCR reactions (1× PCR buffer, 200 μm
dNTPs, 150 ng of each gene specific primer, 5U Taq
Polymerase and 1× SYBR-GreenR using Icycler (BioRad,
USA) were carried out at 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 1
min and 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles. At the end of the
PCR cycles, the products were analyzed through a melt
curve analysis to check the specificity of the PCR
amplification. Two replicates of each reaction were performed, and data were analyzed by Livak method [59]
and expressed as normalized expression ratio (2-ΔΔCT)
of particular gene to specific stress treatment. Expression ratio was calculated as ΔΔCT = ΔCT (gene) -ΔCT
(b-tubulin); ΔCT (gene) = ΔCT (transgenic line) - ΔCT
(CK plant); ΔC T (b-tubulin) = ΔC T (transgenic line)
-ΔCT (CK plant).
