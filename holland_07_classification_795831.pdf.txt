Abstract
Background: The homeobox genes are a large and diverse group of genes, many of which play
important roles in the embryonic development of animals. Increasingly, homeobox genes are being
compared between genomes in an attempt to understand the evolution of animal development.
Despite their importance, the full diversity of human homeobox genes has not previously been
described.
Results: We have identified all homeobox genes and pseudogenes in the euchromatic regions of
the human genome, finding many unannotated, incorrectly annotated, unnamed, misnamed or
misclassified genes and pseudogenes. We describe 300 human homeobox loci, which we divide into
235 probable functional genes and 65 probable pseudogenes. These totals include 3 genes with
partial homeoboxes and 13 pseudogenes that lack homeoboxes but are clearly derived from
homeobox genes. These figures exclude the repetitive DUX1 to DUX5 homeobox sequences of
which we identified 35 probable pseudogenes, with many more expected in heterochromatic
regions. Nomenclature is established for approximately 40 formerly unnamed loci, reflecting their
evolutionary relationships to other loci in human and other species, and nomenclature revisions
are proposed for around 30 other loci. We use a classification that recognizes 11 homeobox gene
'classes' subdivided into 102 homeobox gene 'families'.
Conclusion: We have conducted a comprehensive survey of homeobox genes and pseudogenes
in the human genome, described many new loci, and revised the classification and nomenclature of
homeobox genes. The classification scheme may be widely applicable to homeobox genes in other
animal genomes and will facilitate comparative genomics of this important gene superclass.

Background
Homeobox genes are characterized by the possession of a
particular DNA sequence, the homeobox, which encodes
a recognizable although very variable protein domain, the
homeodomain [1,2]. Most homeodomains are 60 amino
acids in length, although exceptions are known. Many
homeodomain proteins are transcription factors with

important roles in embryonic patterning and cell differentiation, and several have been implicated in human diseases and congenital abnormalities [3].
The homeobox genes have been variously subdivided into
superclasses, classes, subclasses or groups, although there
has been much inconsistency in the use of these terms.

The most commonly recognized groupings are the ANTP,
PRD, LIM, POU, HNF, SINE, TALE, CUT, PROS and ZF
groups (or variants of these names), although these are
not always given equal rank in classification schemes
[1,2,4-8]. There is more consensus in classification at a
lower level, just above the level of the gene, where very
similar genes are grouped into gene families. Widely recognized gene families include Dlx, Evx, Msx, Cdx, En, Otx,
Pitx, Otx and Emx (or variants of these names), amongst
many others, although there is variation particularly concerning how many gene families are used for the HOX,
PAX and NK homeobox genes. Despite the numerous discrepancies, the common principle of classification is the
same. The goal of any scheme is to mirror evolutionary
diversification, so that 'closely related' genes are placed in
the same gene family, and related gene families are placed
in the same gene class or other higher grouping. It should
be borne in mind, however, that the pathway of evolutionary diversification is never completely known for any
large and complex set of genes.
The initial analyses of the draft human genome sequence
published in 2001 included estimates of the number of
human homeobox genes. Venter et al [9] found 160
homeobox genes, containing 178 homeobox sequences,
using large-scale automated classification; while the
IHGSC team [10] gave a much higher estimate of 267
homeobox genes. Both were based on draft coverage of
the human genome and would be expected to be missing
some genes, as well as confusing pseudogenes with genes.
In the same year, Banerjee-Basu and Baxevanis [8] presented an analysis of 129 human homeodomain
sequences, but this was far from a comprehensive survey.
More recently, there have been two more accurate surveys
of homeobox genes in the human genome. Nam and Nei
[11] found 230 homeobox genes, containing 257 homeobox sequences. Ryan et al [7] found 228 homeodomain
sequences in the NCBI RefSeq database of October 2004.
Our analyses (described here) revealed many homeobox
genes that were incorrectly annotated, named or classified
and many homeobox pseudogenes that had previously
been missed. We report a complete survey of homeobox
loci in the euchromatic regions of the human genome,
appropriate gene nomenclature and a consistent classification scheme.

Results and Discussion
How many homeobox genes and pseudogenes?
Using exhaustive database screening, followed by manual
examination of sequences, we identified 300 homeobox
loci in the human genome. Distinguishing which of these
loci are functional genes and which are non-functional
pseudogenes was difficult in some cases. Most loci classified as pseudogenes in this study are integrated reversetranscribed transcripts, readily recognized by their dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

persed genomic location, complete lack of intron
sequences, and (in some cases) 3' homopolymeric run of
adenine residues. A small minority are duplicated copies
of genes, recognized by physical linkage to their functional counterparts and the same (or similar) exon-intron
arrangement. In general, retrotransposed gene copies are
non-functional (and therefore pseudogenes) from the
moment of integration because they lack 5' promoter
regions necessary for transcription. However, such
sequences can occasionally acquire new promoters and
become functional as 'retrogenes'. Duplicated gene copies
often possess 5'promoter regions (as they are often
encompassed by the duplication event); most degenerate
to pseudogenes due to redundancy in a process known as
non-functionalization, however some can be preserved as
functional genes through sub- or neo-functionalization.
Thus, in both instances, reliable indicators of non-functionality were sought in order to assign pseudogene status,
notably frameshift mutations, premature stop codons and
non-synonymous substitutions at otherwise conserved
sites in the original coding region.
We currently estimate that the 300 human homeobox loci
comprise 235 functional genes and 65 pseudogenes
(Table 1). These figures include three functional genes
that possess partial homeobox sequences (PAX2, PAX5
and PAX8) and retrotransposed pseudogenes that correspond to only part of the original transcript, whether or
not it includes the homeobox region or indeed any of the
original coding region. Consequently, 13 retrotransposed
pseudogenes that lack homeobox sequences are included
(NANOGP11,
TPRX1P1,
TPRX1P2,
POU5F1P7,
POU5F1P8, IRX4P1, TGIF2P2, TGIF2P3, TGIF2P4,
CUX2P1, CUX2P2, SATB1P1, ZEB2P1). We do not include
PAX1, PAX9 and CERS1; these are functional genes without homeobox motifs, albeit closely related to true homeobox genes (the other PAX and CERS genes).
The total number of homeobox sequences in the human
genome is higher than 300 for two reasons. First, several
genes and pseudogenes possess more than one homeobox
sequence, notably members of the Dux (double homeobox), Zfhx and Zhx/Homez gene families. Second, we
have excluded a set of sequences related to human DUX4
(DUX1 to DUX5), which have become part of 3.3 kb
repetitive DNA elements present in multiple copies in the
genome [12-14]. Few of these tandemly-repeated
sequences are likely to be functional as expressed proteins,
and all were probably derived by retrotransposition from
functional DUX gene transcripts (see below). The fact that
they are not included in the total count, therefore, is likely
to have limited bearing on understanding the diversity
and normal function of human homeobox genes. Hence,
our figure of 300 homeobox loci is the most useful current

estimate of the repertoire of human homeobox genes and
pseudogenes.
Classification
We propose a simple classification scheme for homeobox
genes, based on two principal ranks: gene class and gene
family. A gene class contains one or more gene families,
which in turn will contain one or more genes. In a few
cases, it is useful to erect an intermediate rank between
these levels, and for this we use the term subclass. For the
entire set of homeobox genes, we use the term superclass.

For the rank of gene family, we use a specific evolutionarybased definition based on common practice in the field of
comparative genomics and developmental biology. We
define a gene family as a set of genes derived from a single
gene in the most recent common ancestor of bilaterian
animals (here defined as the latest common ancestor of
Drosophila and human). This definition has been made
explicitly in previous work [2,6] but is actually a principle
that has been in widespread, but rather inconsistent, use
for over a decade [15]. For example, amongst the homeobox genes, the En (engrailed) gene family was originally

defined to include human EN1 and EN2, plus Drosophila
en and inv [16]; these four genes arose by independent
duplication from a single gene in the most recent common ancestor of insects and vertebrates. Moving outside
the homeobox genes, this principle is also widespread; for
example, the Hh (hedgehog) gene family was defined to
include mouse Shh, Dhh and Ihh, plus Drosophila hh [17].
To clarify boundaries between gene families, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses of human homeodomain sequences, using a range of protostome and
occasionally cnidarian homeodomain sequences as outgroups (Additional files 1 and 2).
While the gene family definition described above is generally workable for homeobox genes, by necessity there are
some exceptions. One type of exception relates to genes
with an unknown ancestral number. For example, there is
uncertainty as to whether there were one or two Dlx (distal-less) genes in the most recent common ancestor of
bilaterians; however it is common practice to refer to a
single Dlx gene family [18]. Thus, we stick with convention for this set of genes. There is similar uncertainty over
the ancestral number of Irx (iroquois) genes [19], and
again we treat these as a single gene family. The HOX
genes are an interesting case as their precise number in the
most recent common ancestor of bilaterians is unknown
due to lack of phylogenetic resolution between 'central'
genes [20]. Here we divide the HOX genes into seven gene
families: the 'anterior' Hox1 and Hox2 gene families, the
'group 3' Hox3 gene family, the 'central' Hox4, Hox5 and
Hox6-8 gene families, and the 'posterior' Hox9-13 gene
family. Another type of exception relates to 'orphan'
genes. These are genes that have been found in one species
(for example human) but not in other species, or at least
not in a wide diversity of Metazoa. Some of these will be
ancient genes that have been secondarily lost from the
genomes of some species, in which case these comply
with our evolutionary definition of a gene family made
above. Others, however, will be rapidly evolving genes
that originated from another homeobox gene and then
diverged to such an extent that their origins are unclear
[21]. Whenever origins are unclear, we must define a new
gene family to encompass those genes, even though they
may not date back to the latest common ancestor of bilaterians. In these cases, the gene family is erected to recognize a set of distinct genes on the basis of DNA and
protein sequence, rather than on evolutionary origins.
Using the aforementioned criteria, we recognize 102
homeobox gene families in the human genome (Table 1).
We are aware that other homeobox gene families exist in
bilaterians but have been lost from humans (for example,
Nk7, Ro, Hbn, Repo and Cmp; [7]), and we recognize that
some gene family boundaries will alter as new information is obtained. Nonetheless, at the present time the 102

gene families provide a sound framework for the study of
human homeobox genes.
It is much more difficult to propose a rigorous evolutionary definition for the rank of gene class. Every attempt to
classify genes above the level of gene family involves a
degree of arbitrariness. We define gene classes by taking
two principal criteria into account. First, gene classes
should ideally be monophyletic assemblages of gene families. To identify probable monophyletic groups of gene
families, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses
of homeodomain sequences, and looked for sets of gene
families that group together stably, regardless of the precise composition of the dataset used (Figures 1, 2, 3; Additional files 3, 4, 5). Some gene families were difficult to
place from sequence data alone, and were found in different gene classes (or subclasses) depending on the precise
dataset analyzed or the phylogenetic method employed.
This is perhaps not surprising as trees that encompass
many homeobox genes can only be built with a short
sequence alignment (the homeodomain); under these
conditions, phylogenetic trees can only be used as a guide
to possible classification, not the absolute truth. In ambiguous cases, we used the chromosomal location of genes to
guide possible resolution between alternative hypotheses.
Second, some homeobox gene classes can be characterized by the presence of additional protein domains outside of the homeodomain [2]. Recognized protein
domains associated with homeodomains include the PRD
domain, LIM domain, POU-specific domain, POU-like
domain, SIX domain, various MEINOX-related domains,
the CUT domain, PROS domain, and various ZF domains
[2].
Using the aforementioned criteria, we recognize eleven
homeobox gene classes in the human genome: ANTP,
PRD, LIM, POU, HNF, SINE, TALE, CUT, PROS, ZF and
CERS (Table 1). There is no expectation that the eleven
gene classes will be of similar size, simply because some
classes will have undergone more expansion by gene
duplication than others. In the human genome, the ANTP
and PRD classes are much larger than the other classes.
Although gene classes should ideally be monophyletic, it
is possible that the ZF homeobox gene class, characterized
by the presence of zinc finger motifs in most of its members, is polyphyletic (Figure 3; Additional file 5). In other
words, domain shuffling may have brought together a
homeobox sequence and a zinc finger sequence on more
than one occasion. The same may also be true for the LIM
class; alternatively the apparent polyphyly of LIM-class
homeodomains could be a consequence of LIM domain
loss or artefactual placement of some ZF-class homeodomains in phylogenetic analyses (Figure 3; Additional file
5).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

In theory, it is possible to recognize higher level associations above the level of the gene class, because the diversification of homeobox genes will have taken place by a
continual series of gene duplication events. We do not
propose names for hierarchical levels above the rank of
class, and consider that gene name, gene family and gene
class (and occasionally subclass) convey sufficient information for most purposes.
We use a consistent convention for writing gene classes
and gene families. We present the names of all gene
classes in abbreviated non-italicized upper case – for
example, the ANTP and PRD classes – to avoid confusion
with gene symbols (Antp and prd) or indeed gene names
(Antennapedia and paired). In contrast, we present the
names of all gene families in non-italicized title case; for
example, the Cdx, En and Gsc gene families. We have used
this style consistently in recent work [6,21-23] and note
that several other authors have done likewise [4,7,24]. We
suggest that this style, and most of these gene family
names, can be used in other bilaterian genomes. Extending the scheme to non-bilaterians is more difficult, however, and awaits clarification of the relationship between
the homeobox genes of sponges, placozoans, cnidarians
and bilaterians [7,25].
The ANTP homeobox class
The ANTP class derives its name from the Antennapedia
(Antp) gene, one of the HOX genes within the ANT-C
homeotic complex of Drosophila melanogaster. The human
genome has 39 HOX genes, arranged into four Hox clusters. Here we divide the HOX genes into seven gene families: Hox1, Hox2, Hox3, Hox4, Hox5, Hox6-8 and Hox913. The HOX genes are not the only ANTP-class genes, and
we recognize a total of 37 gene families in this class (Table
1). We divide these 37 gene families between two subclasses that are relatively well-supported in phylogenetic
analyses: the HOXL and the NKL subclasses (Figure 1;
Additional file 3). As previously discussed, the subclasses
are largely consistent with the chromosomal positions of
genes [26,27]. The HOXL (HOX-Like or HOX-Linked)
genes primarily map to two fourfold paralogous regions:
the Hox paralogon (2q, 7p/q, 12q and 17q) and the ParaHox paralogon (4q, 5q, 13q and Xq) (Figure 4). The NKL
(NK-Like or NK-Linked) genes are more dispersed, but
there is a concentration on the NKL or MetaHox paralogon (2p/8p, 4p, 5q and 10q) (Figure 4). Somewhat aberrantly, the Dlx and En gene families group with the NKL
subclass in phylogenetic analyses (Figure 1; Additional
file 3), but with the HOXL subclass on the basis of chromosomal positions (Figure 4).

Most of the 37 gene families in the ANTP class have been
clearly defined before. We draw attention here to several

(formerly MNR2). Some authors refer to the Mnx gene
family as the Exex gene family due to the Drosophila

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of human PRD-class homeodomains. Arbitrarily rooted phylogenetic tree of
human PRD-class homeodomains constructed using the maximum likelihood method. Bootstrap values supporting internal nodes
with over 70% are shown. Homeodomain sequences derived from pseudogenes are excluded, as are the partial homeodomains of
PAX2, PAX5 and PAX8, and the HOPX homeodomain because its extremely divergent sequence destabilizes the overall tree
topology. Roman numeral suffixes are used to distinguish multiple homeodomains encoded by a single Dux-family gene. In this tree
Dux-family homeodomains are not monophyletic, even within the same gene; however, monophyly is recovered by neighbor-joining analysis (Additional file 4). Detailed relationships between different gene families should not be inferred from this tree.

‫ ؠ‬Dlx gene family. It is currently unclear if this gene family
is derived from one or more genes in the common ancestor of bilaterians [18]. Phylogenetic analyses place this
gene family firmly within the NKL subclass (Figure 1;
Additional file 3), but chromosomal positions (on the
Hox chromosomes 2, 7 and 17) place it within the HOXL
subclass (Figure 4). Here we favor placement of the Dlx
gene family within the NKL subclass due to strong phylogenetic support.
‫ ؠ‬En gene family. Phylogenetic analyses place this gene
family either within the NKL subclass (maximum likelihood; Figure 1) or close to the division between the NKL
and HOXL subclasses (neighbor-joining; Additional file
3). Here we place the En gene family within the NKL sub-

class, although we note that human EN2 maps close to the
clear HOXL-subclass genes GBX1 and MNX1 on chromosome 7 (Figure 4).
‫ ؠ‬Nk2.1 and Nk2.2 gene families. The genes NKX2-1 (formerly TITF1), NKX2-4, NKX2-2 and NKX2-8 divide into
two distinct gene families each with an invertebrate
ortholog, not a single Nk2 gene family. NKX2-1 and
NKX2-4 are collectively orthologous to Drosophila scro and
amphioxus AmphiNk2-1 [30,31]; these comprise one gene
family: Nk2.1. NKX2-2 and NKX2-8 are collectively

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of human homeodomains excluding ANTP and PRD classes
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of human homeodomains excluding ANTP and PRD classes. Arbitrarily
rooted phylogenetic tree of human homeodomains excluding the ANTP and PRD classes constructed using the maximum likelihood method. Bootstrap values supporting internal nodes with over 70% are shown. Homeodomain sequences derived from
pseudogenes are excluded. Roman numeral suffixes are used to distinguish multiple homeodomains encoded by a single gene.
Classes and/or families are color coded as shown in the key. The LIM and ZF classes are not recovered as two distinct monophyletic groups, a result also found by neighbor-joining analysis (Additional file 5). The multiple homeodomains of Zfhx-family proteins and Zhx/Homez-family proteins are also dispersed in the tree, presumably artefactually. Detailed relationships between
different gene families should not be inferred from this tree.

‫ ؠ‬Nk4 gene family. The genes NKX2-3, NKX2-5 and NKX26 form a gene family, quite distinct from other human
genes that confusingly share the prefix NKX2. These three
genes are actually orthologs of Drosophila tin (formerly
NK4); they are not orthologs of Drosophila vnd (formerly
NK2) or scro [33]. Therefore, they do not belong to the

Nk2.1 or Nk2.2 gene families, but belong to a separate
Nk4 gene family. As the three gene names have very extensive current usage, it may be difficult for revised names to
be used consistently. In this situation, we don't alter the
current names, but raise for discussion the possibility of
these genes being renamed to the more logical NKX4-1

Chromosomal distribution of human homeobox genes
Chromosomal distribution of human homeobox genes. Ideograms of human chromosomes showing the locations of

(NKX2-5), NKX4-2 (NKX2-6) and NKX4-3 (NKX2-3), or
to CSX1 (NKX2-5), CSX2 (NKX2-6) and CSX3 (NKX2-3),
based on the alternative name CSX1 for NKX2-5 [34].
‫ ؠ‬Noto gene family. This gene family falls close to the division between the ANTP and PRD classes in phylogenetic
analyses (Additional files 1 and 2). We favor placement
within the ANTP class as the human NOTO gene is chromosomally linked to the clear ANTP-class (NKL-subclass)
genes EMX1, LBX2, TLX2 and VAX2 on chromosome 2
(Figure 4), suggesting ancestry by ancient tandem duplication.
Most of the 100 genes in the ANTP class have been adequately named previously. However, several genes were
unnamed or misnamed prior to this study. We have
updated these as follows.

‫ ؠ‬GSX2 [Entrez Gene ID: 170825] is the second of two
human members of the Gsx gene family. This previously
unnamed gene has clear orthology to mouse Gsh2,
inferred from sequence identity and synteny. We designate the gene GSX2 and revise the nomenclature of the
other human member of the family from GSH1 to GSX1
[Entrez Gene ID: 219409], in accordance with homeobox
gene nomenclature convention.
‫ ؠ‬MNX1 [Entrez Gene ID: 3110] is the only member of the
Mnx gene family in the human genome. This gene was
previously known as HLXB9; we rename it MNX1 because
it is not part of a series of at least nine related genes.
‫ ؠ‬PDX1 [Entrez Gene ID: 3651] is the only member of the
Pdx gene family in the human genome. This gene was previously known as IPF1; we rename it PDX1 because the
majority of published studies use this as the gene symbol.

‫ ؠ‬BSX [Entrez Gene ID: 390259] is the only member of the
Bsx gene family in the human genome. We designate this
previously unnamed gene BSX on the basis of clear orthology to the mouse Bsx gene, inferred from sequence identity and synteny.
‫ ؠ‬DBX1 [Entrez Gene ID: 120237] and DBX2 [Entrez Gene
ID: 440097] are the only two members of the Dbx gene
family in the human genome. We designate these previously unnamed genes DBX1 and DBX2 on the basis of
clear orthology to mouse Dbx1 and Dbx2, inferred from
sequence identity and synteny.
‫ ؠ‬NKX1-1 [Entrez Gene ID: 54729] and NKX1-2 [Entrez
Gene ID: 390010] are the only two members of the Nk1
gene family in the human genome. These genes were previously known as HSPX153 and C10orf121 respectively;
we rename them NKX1-1 and NKX1-2 on the basis of clear
orthology to mouse Nkx1-1 and Nkx1-2, inferred from
sequence identity and synteny.
‫ ؠ‬NKX2-1 [Entrez Gene ID: 7080] is the first of two human
members of the Nk2.1 gene family. This gene was previously known as TITF1; we rename it NKX2-1 to show that
it is a member of the Nk2.1 gene family.
‫ ؠ‬NKX2-6 [Entrez Gene ID: 137814] is the third of three
human members of the Nk4 gene family. We designate
this previously unnamed gene NKX2-6 on the basis of
clear orthology to mouse Nkx2-6, inferred from sequence
identity and synteny, although nomenclature revision for
the entire Nk4 gene family should be discussed (see
above).
‫ ؠ‬NKX3-2 [Entrez Gene ID: 579] is the second of two
human members of the Nk3 gene family. This gene was
previously known as BAPX1; we rename it NKX3-2 to
show that it is a member of the Nk3 gene family.
‫ ؠ‬NKX6-3 [Entrez Gene ID: 157848] is the third of three
human members of the Nk6 gene family. We designate
this previously unnamed gene NKX6-3 on the basis of
clear orthology to mouse Nkx6-3, inferred from sequence
identity and synteny.
‫ ؠ‬VENTX [Entrez Gene ID: 27287] is the only functional
member of the Ventx gene family in the human genome.
This gene was previously known as VENTX2. We remove
the numerical suffix from this gene symbol because we
discovered that the sequence formerly known as VENTX1
is actually a retrotransposed pseudogene derived from this
gene. Accordingly, we also replace the VENTX1 symbol
with VENTXP7 (see below).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

In contrast to the previous descriptions of probable functional genes, there has been much less research on pseudogenes within the ANTP class. Eleven pseudogenes
derived from the human NANOG gene have been
described previously [22], while four pseudogenes in the
Ventx gene family have been reported following routine
annotation of the human genome. We have identified two
additional Ventx-family pseudogenes (VENTXP5 and
VENTXP6), and also found two cases of pseudogenes that
were originally mistaken for functional genes (MSX2P1
and VENTXP7). In all cases, we have clarified the origins
and organization of these pseudogenes. This research
brings the total number of ANTP-class pseudogenes in the
human genome to 19.
‫ ؠ‬MSX2P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 55545]. A short cDNA
sequence [EMBL: X74862] related to the Msx gene family
was reported previously [35]; the former Entrez Gene
record labeled HSHPX5 was based on this sequence. This
locus was later provisionally called MSX4, as it was distinct from human MSX1 and MSX2, and by synteny it was
clearly not the ortholog of mouse Msx3 [27]. It is now
clear that this locus was formed by retrotransposition of
mRNA from MSX2 and hence we name it MSX2P1. The
genomic sequence of MSX2P1 can now be accessed via the
Reference Sequence collection [RefSeq: NR_002307]. The
pseudogene shares 91% sequence identity with MSX2
mRNA, lacks intronic sequence, and has remnants of a 3'
poly(A) tail. It is intriguing, but probably coincidental,
that the MSX2P1 pseudogene has integrated at 17q23.2,
close to several ANTP-class genes (HOXB cluster, MEOX1,
DLX3 and DLX4).
‫ ؠ‬NANOGP1 [Entrez Gene ID: 404635]. We follow Booth
and Holland [22] and classify NANOGP1 as a pseudogene
that arose by tandem duplication of NANOG. The alternative view, argued by Hart et al [36], is that this locus is a
functional gene, and should be named NANOG2. There is
evidence for transcription of this locus in human embryonic stem cells [36], and for selection-driven conservation
of the open reading frame [37], but as yet no clear evidence for function.
‫ ؠ‬NANOGP8 [Entrez Gene ID: 388112]. We follow Booth
and Holland [22] and classify NANOGP8 as a retrotransposed pseudogene. The alternative view, argued by Zhang
et al [38], is that this locus is a functional retrogene. There
is evidence for transcription and translation of this locus
in cancer cell lines and tumors [38], but no evidence yet
for a role in normal tissues.
‫ ؠ‬VENTXP1 [Entrez Gene ID: 139538], VENTXP2 [Entrez
Gene ID: 347975], VENTXP3 [Entrez Gene ID: 349814]
and VENTXP4 [Entrez Gene ID: 152101]. These four
VENTX retrotransposed pseudogenes have been reported

previously, and were originally known as VENTX2P1 to
VENTX2P4. The correction of the VENTX2 gene symbol to
simply VENTX (see above) means that each of the pseudogene names should also change; we rename them
VENTXP1 to VENTXP4. VENTXP1 is transcribed but due
to mutations it can no longer encode a homeodomain
protein; it can however encode an antigenic peptide
(NA88A) responsible for T-cell stimulation in response to
melanoma [39].
‫ ؠ‬VENTXP5 [Entrez Gene ID: 442384]. We designate this
previously unnamed sequence VENTXP5 because it is
clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of VENTX. The
genomic sequence of VENTXP5 can now be accessed via
the Reference Sequence collection [RefSeq: NG_005091].
The pseudogene shares 83% identity with VENTX mRNA
(after masking of an Alu element in the parental mRNA
sequence), lacks intronic sequence, and has remnants of a
3' poly(A) tail.
‫ ؠ‬VENTXP6 [Entrez Gene ID: 552879]. We designate this
previously unannotated sequence VENTXP6 because it is
clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of VENTX. Its lack of
annotation may reflect the fact that it is located within an
intron of an unrelated and well characterized gene,
STAU2. The genomic sequence of VENTXP6 can now be
accessed via the Reference Sequence collection [RefSeq:
NG_005090]. The pseudogene shares 87% identity with
VENTX mRNA (after masking of an Alu element in the
parental mRNA sequence) and lacks intronic sequence.
‫ ؠ‬VENTXP7 [Entrez Gene ID: 391518]. A short cDNA
sequence [EMBL: X74864] was reported previously and
named HPX42 [35]. This was later renamed the VENTX1
gene, after it was found to be related to Xenopus Ventxfamily genes. Our analysis of the genomic sequence at this
locus reveals that it is actually a retrotransposed pseudogene of the VENTX gene (formerly VENTX2); thus we designate it VENTXP7. The genomic sequence of VENTXP7
can now be accessed via the Reference Sequence collection
[RefSeq: NR_002311]. The pseudogene shares 86% identity with VENTX mRNA (after masking of an Alu element
in the parental mRNA sequence), lacks intronic sequence,
and has remnants of a 3' poly(A) tail.
One other gene could conceivably be included in the
ANTP class, but is excluded from our survey. This gene
[Entrez Gene ID: 360030; GenBank: AY151139], has been
annotated as a homeobox gene and is located just 20 kb
from NANOG. However, no homeodomain was detected
when the deduced protein was analyzed for conserved
domains. Also, secondary structure prediction did not predict the expected organisation of alpha helices. Alignment
with the NANOG homeodomain reveals identity of the
KQ and WF motifs, either side of the same intron position

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

(44/45), but few other shared residues. It is possible, but
unproven, that the locus arose by tandem duplication of
part, or all, of the NANOG homeobox gene. This gene has
generated two retrotransposed pseudogenes: one at
2q11.2 and another at 12q24.33.
The PRD homeobox class
The PRD class derives its name from the paired (prd) gene
of Drosophila melanogaster. In previous studies, the PRD
class has been subdivided in several different ways, often
based on identify of the amino acid at residue 50 in the
homeodomain, for example S50, K50 and Q50. These categories are not monophyletic groupings of genes and so
can be misleading if we aim for a classification scheme
that reflects evolution [5]. Here we divide the PRD class
into two subclasses of unequal size: the PAX subclass
(containing seven PAX genes, excluding PAX1 and PAX9),
and the PAXL subclass (containing 43 non-PAX genes and
many pseudogenes) (Table 1). PAX genes are defined by
possession of a conserved paired-box motif, distinct from
the homeobox, coding for the 128-amino-acid PRD
domain. Of the nine human genes possessing a pairedbox (PAX1 to PAX9), only four also contain a complete
homeobox (PAX3, PAX7, PAX4 and PAX6). Three genes
have a partial homeobox (PAX2, PAX5 and PAX8), while
two lack a homeobox entirely (PAX1 and PAX9). Phylogenetic analyses using PAX genes from a range of species
suggest that these are secondary conditions, and that the
ancestral PAX gene probably possessed both motifs [40].
The PAX genes do not constitute a single gene family,
because it is clear that the latest common ancestor of the
Bilateria contained four PAX genes. Three of these are
ancestors of the PRD-class homeobox gene families Pax2/
5/8, Pax3/7 and Pax4/6; the fourth is the ancestor of PAX1
and PAX9. Thus the PAX subclass contains three gene families. We divide the PAXL subclass into 28 gene families,
although as explained below not all of these date to the
base of the Bilateria. Thus, we recognize a total of 31 gene
families in the PRD class (Table 1).

Many of the 31 gene families in the PRD class have been
clearly defined before. We draw attention here to newly
defined gene families and cases that could cause confusion. Other details can be found in Table 3.
‫ ؠ‬Argfx, Dprx and Tprx gene families. There are no known
invertebrate members of these three gene families. Therefore, these are exceptions to the rule defining gene families as dating to the base of the Bilateria. The Dprx and
Tprx gene families may have arisen by duplication and
very extensive divergence from CRX, a member of the Otx
gene family, during mammalian evolution; origins of
ARGFX are obscure [21].

Human PRD class homeobox genes and pseudogenes including full names, chromosomal locations, Entrez Gene IDs and previous symbols. Pax2/5/8-family genes
contain a partial homeobox. RHOXF2B is a duplicate of RHOXF2. TPRX2P is a duplicate of TPRX1.

‫ ؠ‬Dux gene family. Members of this gene family are characterized by the presence of two closely-linked homeobox
motifs. Most members are intronless sequences present in
multiple polymorphic copies within the 3.3 kb family of
tandemly repeated elements associated with heterochromatin. These comprise the sequences known as DUX1 to
DUX5 reported in previous studies [12-14] and numerous
DUX4 copies detected in this study (see below). The
absence of introns suggests that these sequences may have
originated by retrotransposition from an mRNA transcript, thus they are probably non-functional. There are
two noticeable exceptions; these members known as
DUXA and DUXB possess introns, thus either one could
be the progenitor for the large number of intronless Duxfamily sequences found in the human genome. DUXA has
spawned 10 retrotransposed pseudogenes and has been
described previously [21]. DUXB is described here (see
below).
‫ ؠ‬Hopx gene family. Phylogenetic analyses places this gene
family, containing a single very divergent homeobox gene
HOPX (formerly HOP), either within the PRD class (maximum likelihood; Additional file 1) or close to Zhx/
Homez-family genes (neighbor-joining; Additional file
2). We favor placement in the PRD class for three reasons.
First, the HOPX homeodomain has highest sequence
identity with PRD-class homeodomains (GSC: 38% and
PAX6: 36%). Second, the HOPX homeodomain possesses
the same combination of residues that are invariably conserved across human PRD-class homeodomains (Additional file 6). Third, the HOPX homeodomain shares the
46/47 intron position seen in many PRD-class homeodomains. HOPX does not map particularly near any other
homeobox genes, although the closest is GSX2 in the
ANTP class at 4q12 (Figure 4). HOPX is not a typical PRDclass homeobox gene; the homeodomain has a single
amino acid insertion between helix I and helix II (Additional file 6), and lacks the ability to bind DNA [41,42].
‫ ؠ‬Leutx gene family. This gene family contains a single
gene in the human genome, LEUTX, and no known inver-

tebrate members. We place LEUTX in the PRD class for
four reasons. First, there is weak phylogenetic support for
this placement (Additional files 1 and 2). Second, the
LEUTX homeodomain possesses the same combination
of residues that are invariably conserved across human
PRD-class homeodomains (except for a leucine at position 20; Additional file 6). Third, the LEUTX homeodomain shares the 46/47 intron position seen in many PRDclass homeodomains. Fourth, the LEUTX gene is located
close to the PRD-class genes TPRX1, CRX, DPRX and
DUXA on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome
19 (Figure 4). This fourth observation leads us to hypothesize that this gene family arose by tandem duplication
and extensive divergence during mammalian evolution.
‫ ؠ‬Nobox gene family. This gene family falls close to the
division between the ANTP and PRD classes in both maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining phylogenetic
analyses (Additional files 1 and 2). We favor placement
within the PRD class because the NOBOX homeodomain
has higher sequence identity with PRD-class homeodomains (up to 55%) than with ANTP-class homeodomains
(up to 46%). Chromosomal position does not shed light
on the issue, as its location at 7q35 is close to both ANTPand PRD-class genes (Figure 4).
‫ ؠ‬Otx gene family. This very well known gene family was
originally considered to contain human OTX1 and OTX2
(and their mouse orthologs) and the Drosophila otd gene
[43]. Later, it was shown that the CRX gene is a member
of the same gene family, deriving from the same ancestral
gene. Thus, CRX could be considered the true OTX3 gene
[44]. Unfortunately, the OTX3 symbol was formerly used
erroneously for a gene in a different family, now called
DMBX1, thus complicating its future use. The gene family
name Otx is derived by majority rule from the constituent
genes.
‫ ؠ‬Pax2/5/8 gene family. This gene family is also known as
Pax group II; it contains PAX2, PAX5 and PAX8, clearly

Page 14 of 28
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2007, 5:47

derived from a single ancestral gene [45]. These genes
have partial homeoboxes.
‫ ؠ‬Pax3/7 gene family. This gene family is also known as
Pax group III; it contains PAX3 and PAX7, clearly derived
from a single ancestral gene [46].
‫ ؠ‬Pax4/6 gene family. This gene family is also known as
Pax group IV; it contains PAX4 and PAX6. There is confusion as to whether this should be split into two gene families, because invertebrate homologs generally group with
PAX6 in phylogenetic analyses and not as an outgroup to
the two genes as might be expected. We follow the generally accepted view and group PAX4 and PAX6 into a single
gene family, proposing that PAX4 is a divergent member,
not an ancient gene [40].
‫ ؠ‬Rhox gene family. The mouse Rhox cluster was first
described as comprising twelve X-linked homeobox
genes, all selectively expressed in reproductive tissues
[47]. Subsequent studies reported a total of 32 genes in
the cluster, with the additional genes attributed to recent
tandem duplications [48-51]. The human genome contains three homeobox genes at Xq24 that are clearly members of the Rhox gene family based on sequence identity,
molecular phylogenetics, intron positions and chromosomal location. These are RHOXF1 (formerly OTEX/
PEPP1), RHOXF2 (formerly PEPP2) and RHOXF2B (formerly PEPP2b/PEPP3).
Most of the 50 genes in the PRD class have been adequately named previously. However, several genes were
unnamed or misnamed prior to this study. We have
updated these as follows.
‫ ؠ‬ALX1 [Entrez Gene ID: 8092] is the first of three human
members of the Alx gene family. This gene was previously
known as CART1; we rename it ALX1 because it is related
to ALX3 and ALX4; all three genes were formed by duplication from a single ancestral invertebrate gene [52].
‫ ؠ‬DRGX [Entrez Gene ID: 117065] is the only member of
the newly defined Drgx gene family in the human
genome. This gene was previously known as PRRXL1 and
DRG11, and there is a clear mouse ortholog (Prrxl1). The
symbol PRRXL1 is misleading because it infers membership of the Prrx gene family, containing PRRX1 and
PRRX2 in the human genome. Several lines of evidence
suggest it belongs to a different gene family. First, this
gene (at 10q11.23) is not located in the same paralogon
as PRRX1 (1q24.3) and PRRX2 (9q34.11) so they are not
three paralogs generated during genome duplication in
early vertebrate evolution. Second, it has a completely different exon-intron structure from the Prrx-family genes,
and it does not contain a Prrx domain or an OAR domain

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

(present in PRRX1 and PRRX2; [53]). Third, the homeodomain is only 73% identical to PRRX1 and PRRX2
homeodomains, much lower than the 80-100% usually
encountered for members of the same gene family in
humans. Finally, we have identified the Drosophila
ortholog, IP09201. The homeodomains of Drosophila
IP09201 and human DRGX form a highly supported
monophyletic group in our maximum likelihood (90%;
Additional file 1) and neighbor-joining (97%; Additional
file 2) phylogenetic analyses. The new symbol DRGX (dorsal root ganglia homeobox) incorporates the root of the
former symbol DRG11, referring to expression of the
rodent ortholog in dorsal root ganglia neurons [54].
‫ ؠ‬DUXB [Entrez Gene ID: 100033411] is a human member of the Dux (double homeobox) gene family. As previously discussed, most members of this gene family are
intronless and are probably derived by retrotransposition
of an mRNA transcript from a functional intron-containing Dux gene (or duplication of such an integrant). Booth
and Holland [21] described the DUXA gene containing
five introns (including one within each homeobox), and
noted the existence of a second intron-containing human
Dux-family gene provisionally designated DUXB. The
DUXB nomenclature is endorsed here. No cDNA or EST
sequences have been reported for DUXB.
‫ ؠ‬GSC2 [Entrez Gene ID: 2928] is the second of two
human members of the Gsc gene family. This gene was
previously known as GSCL; we rename it GSC2 to remove
the inadvertent implication that it is not a true gene, and
also to reflect the clear orthology to chick Gsc2 as inferred
by phylogenetic analysis and synteny.
‫ ؠ‬HOPX [Entrez Gene ID: 84525] is the only member of
the newly defined Hopx gene family in the human
genome. The mouse version of the gene was first identified first and named Hop (homeodomain only protein)
because the encoded protein is just 73 amino acids long,
with 61 of these making up the homeodomain [41,42].
The HOP gene symbol is not ideal as it is also used for
unrelated genes, including hopscotch in Drosophila and hopsterile in mouse. Therefore, we revise the gene symbol
from HOP to HOPX (HOP homeobox) in accordance with
homeobox gene nomenclature convention.
‫ ؠ‬LEUTX [Entrez Gene ID: 342900] is the only member of
the newly defined Leutx gene family in the human
genome. We designate this previously unnamed gene
LEUTX (leucine twenty homeobox) to reflect the presence
of a leucine residue at the otherwise highly conserved
homeodomain position 20; other PRD-class homeodomains have a phenylalanine at this position (Additional
file 6). Studies of mutations in other homeobox genes

Page 15 of 28
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2007, 5:47

suggest that mutation to leucine alters transcriptional
activity of a homeodomain protein [55].
‫ ؠ‬RAX2 [Entrez Gene ID: 84839] is the second of two
human members of the Rax gene family. This gene was
previously known as RAXL1; we rename it RAX2 to standardize nomenclature.
‫ ؠ‬RHOXF1 [Entrez Gene ID: 158800] and RHOXF2 [Entrez
Gene ID: 84528] are two of three human members of the
Rhox gene family. These genes were previously known as
OTEX/PEPP1 and PEPP2 respectively. The prefix PEPP is
not suitable as it is used for numerous aminopeptidase Pencoding genes. Thus, we replace the gene symbols OTEX/
PEPP1 and PEPP2 with RHOXF1 and RHOXF2 respectively, to reflect their orthologous relationship with the
mouse Rhox cluster (containing 32 genes, see above)
whilst avoiding inadvertent equivalence to specific genes
within the cluster.
‫ ؠ‬RHOXF2B [Entrez Gene ID: 727940] is the third human
member of the Rhox gene family. This locus was referred
to in previous studies as PEPP2b [56] and PEPP3 [51]. The
prefix PEPP cannot be approved for reasons noted above.
RHOXF2B is located very close to RHOXF1 and RHOXF2
at Xq24 and is clearly a very recent duplicate of RHOXF2.
The genomic sequences at these two loci share 99% identity over exonic, intronic and approximately 20 kb flanking regions. Over the coding region, there are just two
nucleotide substitutions (both nonsynonymous); one of
these results in an unusual change within the homeodomain (arginine to cysteine at position 18). We currently
list RHOXF2B as a functional gene, although it is possible
that it is a duplicated pseudogene.
‫ ؠ‬SEBOX [Entrez Gene ID: 645832] is the only member of
the Sebox gene family in the human genome. The human
gene is the ortholog of mouse Sebox based on their locations in syntenic chromosomal regions (17q11.2 and
11B5 respectively) and presence of the same intron positions. However, sequence identity is lower than normal
for orthologous genes in mouse and human (78% amino
acid identity over the homeodomain) and there is evidence that the human gene has undergone divergence.
Most surprisingly, the human sequence has two unusual
substitutions in the homeodomain [57]. At homeodomain position 51, the human sequence codes for lysine
whereas mouse has asparagine; an earlier analysis of 346
homeodomain sequences found asparagine to be invariant at this position [1,2]. Similarly, at homeodomain
position 53, human has tryptophan whereas mouse has
arginine; this position is almost invariably arginine [1,2].
These sequence changes in the important third helix raise
the possibility that human SEBOX could have accumulated mutations as a non-functional pseudogene. Until

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

this is shown more clearly we consider it to be a functional, but divergent, gene. This gene was previously
known as OG9X with SEBOX as the alternative symbol; we
favor SEBOX because the OG prefix was originally used for
several unrelated homeobox genes.
‫ ؠ‬UNCX [Entrez Gene ID: 340260] is the only member of
the Uncx gene family in the human genome. This gene
was previously known as UNCX4.1; we remove the
numerals to give UNCX as these do not denote a series
within a gene family.
‫ ؠ‬VSX2 [Entrez Gene ID: 338917] is the second of two
human members of the Vsx gene family. This gene was
previously known as CHX10; we rename it VSX2 to better
reflect its paralogous relationship to VSX1. VSX2 has been
used as an alias for this gene in other vertebrate species
and the gene symbol CHX10 has the disadvantage of
implicitly suggesting presence of at least nine paralogs in
human (CHX1 to CHX9), which do not exist.
Unlike the situation with the ANTP class, many of the
pseudogenes within the PRD class have been well characterized. A previous study has described and named two
pseudogenes in the Argfx gene family, seven pseudogenes
in the Dprx gene family, four pseudogenes in the Tprx
gene family, and 10 pseudogenes derived from the DUXA
gene [21]. There is also a possibility that the SEBOX and
RHOXF2B loci are non-functional pseudogenes, as
described above. We have identified a previously undescribed pseudogene from the Otx gene family (OTX2P1),
and argue that the majority of Dux-family sequences are
pseudogenes.
‫ ؠ‬OTX2P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 100033409]. We designate
this previously undescribed sequence OTX2P1 because it
is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of OTX2. The
genomic DNA sequence of OTX2P1 shares significant
homology with OTX2 transcript variant 2 [RefSeq:
NM_172337]. There is an Alu element (AluSx subfamily)
insertion, a Made1 (Mariner derived element 1) insertion,
and a 1182-nucleotide deletion in OTX2P1 compared to
OTX2. The OTX2P1 sequence lacks introns, ends with a
poly(A) tail, and harbors critical sequence alterations
(including a three-nucleotide insertion introducing a stop
codon into the deduced homeodomain).
‫ ؠ‬DUX1 [EMBL: AJ001481], DUX2 [GenBank: AF068744],
DUX3 [GenBank: AF133130] and DUX5 [GenBank:
AF133131]. These sequences have been cloned in previous studies [12,13]. We detected no matches with 100%
identity to DUX1, DUX2, DUX3 or DUX5 in build 35.1 of
the human genome sequence, which covers the euchromatic regions of each chromosome. This concurs with previous studies indicating that DUX1, DUX2, DUX3 and

DUX5 are found in heterochromatin on human acrocentric chromosomes; each is apparently present in multiple
copies within members of the 3.3 kb family of tandemly
repeated DNA elements [12,13]. Because the majority of
human heterochromatin has not been sequenced, and
may be variable between individuals, the exact number of
copies of DUX1, DUX2, DUX3 and DUX5 is unknown. It
is also debatable whether these loci encode functional
proteins. These sequences lack introns and, as discussed
above, are most likely derived from intron-containing
genes in the Dux family, such as DUXA or DUXB.
‫ ؠ‬DUX4 [GenBank: AF117653]. This sequence has been
extensively studied as some of its multiple copies exist
within the 3.3 kb repetitive elements of the D4Z4 locus at
4q35 [14]. The polymorphic D4Z4 locus is linked to facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD); between
12 and 96 tandem copies of 3.3 kb elements are present in
unaffected individuals and deletions leaving a maximum
of eight such elements have been associated with FSHD
[58]. In build 35.1 of the human genome sequence, we
identified 35 loci at 10 chromosomal locations containing a total of 58 DUX4 (and highly similar) homeobox
sequences. This should not be taken as a precise figure due
to copy number polymorphism and the possibility of
additional copies existing in currently unsequenced heterochromatic regions. Some of the copies are 100% identical to the previously reported DUX4 sequence over the
homeobox regions, others have single nucleotide polymorphisms, some have critical sequence mutations, and
others have just a single homeobox. Most of the copies are
located in tandemly repeated arrays (for example, on
chromosomes 4, 10 and 16) and others are alone in the
genome (for example, a single copy resides at 3p12.3).
The majority of DUX4 copies are unlikely to encode functional proteins as suggested by their intronless, mutated
and tandemly repeated nature. The lack of introns indicates they are most likely derived from intron-containing
genes in the Dux family, such as DUXA or DUXB.
The LIM homeobox class
The LIM class encodes proteins with two LIM domains
(named from the nematode lin-11, mammalian Isl1 and
nematode mec-3 genes) N-terminal to a typical (i.e. 60amino-acid) homeodomain. The LIM domain is a protein-protein interaction domain of approximately 55
amino acids comprising two specialised cysteine-rich zinc
fingers in tandem [59]. Importantly, human genes also
exist that encode LIM domains but not homeodomains.
These LIM domains are divergent from the LIM domains
encoded by LIM homeobox genes, and hence these genes
are unlikely to be derived by loss of the homeobox. There
is one exception: the human Lmo gene family encodes
LIM domains that have been grouped by sequence similarity and domain arrangement with the LIM domains of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

the LIM homeobox gene class [59]. Thus, this gene family
may have secondarily lost the homeobox, although this
remains untested. Only genes encoding both LIM
domains and homeodomains are included in our LIM
homeobox gene count.
We have identified a total of twelve LIM-class homeobox
genes in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4), consistent
with previous work [60]. Phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains do not always recover the LIM class as a monophyletic group, depending on the dataset and method
used (Figure 3; Additional files 1, 2 and 5), but it is likely
that the class evolved from a single fusion event that
brought together LIM domains and a homeodomain.
Phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains divide the LIM
class into six gene families (Figure 3; Additional files 1, 2
and 5), consistent with previous studies [60]. Each gene
family has two human members and dates to a single
ancestral gene in the most recent common ancestor of
bilaterians [60]. We have not found any human LIM-class
pseudogenes.
The POU homeobox class
The POU class generally encodes proteins with a POUspecific domain (named from the mammalian genes Pit1
(now Pou1f1), OCT1 and OCT2 (now POU2F1 and
POU2F2), andnematode unc-86) N-terminal to a typical
homeodomain. The POU-specific domain is a DNA-binding domain of approximately 75 amino acids; the POUspecific domain and the homeodomain are collectively
known as the bipartite POU domain [61].

We have identified a total of 16 POU-class homeobox
genes in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4). The genes
form a distinct grouping even if the POU-specific domain
is disregarded – phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains
recover the POU class as a monophyletic group (Figure 3;
Additional files 1, 2 and 5). There are six widely recognized gene families within the POU class (Pou1 to Pou6),
and nomenclature revisions approximately 10 years ago
clarified which genes belong to which gene family [62].
We have placed two additional genes (HDX and POU5F2)
in the POU class on the basis of their deduced homeodomain sequences, even though one of these genes (HDX)
does not encode a POU-specific domain. We have erected
a new gene family for this gene, bringing the total number
of gene families in the POU class to seven. We have also
identified a total of eight POU-class pseudogenes in the
human genome (Tables 1 and 4); we have named six of
these (POU5F1P2, POU5F1P4 to POU5F1P8), and revised
the nomenclature of one other (POU5F1P3).
‫ ؠ‬HDX [Entrez Gene ID: 139324]. This gene was previously known as CXorf43. The gene encodes a highly divergent atypical (68-amino-acid) homeodomain but not a

Human homeobox genes and pseudogenes, excepting the ANTP and PRD classes, including full names, chromosomal locations, Entrez Gene IDs and
previous symbols. The HOMEZ gene is in the ZF class but encodes a protein with leucine zippers instead of zinc fingers.

POU-specific domain, and thus it is debatable whether it
should be placed within the POU class. Phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains place it basally in a clade with the
POU class (Figure 3; Additional files 1 and 5), or within
the POU class (Additional file 2), suggesting that the HDX
protein either diverged before the POU-specific domain
became associated with the homeodomain or lost the
POU-specific domain during evolution. Further information on this gene may allow this tentative classification to
be revisited.
‫ ؠ‬POU5F2 [Entrez Gene ID: 134187]. We designate this
previously unnamed gene POU5F2 on the basis of clear
orthology to the mouse Sprm1 gene, which has been
assigned the second member of the Pou5 gene family
[63]. The symbol POU5F2 ensures the gene conforms
with standardized nomenclature for the POU class.
‫ ؠ‬POU5F1P2 [GeneID: 100009665], POU5F1P3 (formerly
POUF51L) [GeneID: 5461], POU5F1P4 [GeneID:
100009666],
POU5F1P5
[GeneID:
100009667],
POU5F1P6 [GeneID: 100009668], POU5F1P7 [GeneID:
100009669] and POU5F1P8 [GeneID: 100009670]. Prior
to this study, a single retrotransposed pseudogene of the
POU5F1 gene had been annotated and designated
POU5F1P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 5462]. Another POU5F1related sequence of unknown status had been annotated
and designated POUF5F1L [GeneID: 5461]. We replace
the gene symbol POUF5F1L with POU5F1P3 as this
sequence is a retrotransposed pseudogene of POUF51.
Our analyses of the human genome sequence identified a
further six pseudogenes of POU5F1, which we name
sequentially POU5F1P2, POU5F1P4 through to

POU5F1P8. Each clearly aligns to the mRNA sequence of
POU5F1 but with sequence alterations, indicating origin
by retrotransposition. POU5F1P2 and POU5F1P6 have
frameshift mutations in the homeobox. POU5F1P5 and
POU5F1P6 have stop codons in the homeobox.
POU5F1P7 and POU5F1P8 are partial integrants of
POU5F1 mRNA excluding the homeobox – POU5F1P7
covers part of the 3' untranslated region and POU5F1P8 a
short region around the start codon.
The HNF homeobox class
The HNF class (named after the rat gene Hnf1) encodes
proteins with a POU-like domain N-terminal to a highly
atypical homeodomain. The POU-like domain, as its
name indicates, is weakly similar in sequence to the POUspecific domain [64]; more importantly, it has nearly the
same three-dimensional structure and mode of DNA
binding as the POU-specific domain [65].

We have identified a total of three HNF-class homeobox
genes in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4), consistent
with previous work [66,67]. The homeodomains encoded
by the human HNF1A and HNF1B genes are atypical in
possessing 21 extra amino acid residues between the second and third alpha helices (Additional file 6). We place
these two genes in a single gene family (Hnf1) within the
HNF class, implying derivation from a single invertebrate
gene. Examination of their chromosomal locations concurs with this view. HNF1A and HNF1B map to parts of
the genome known to have duplicated in early vertebrate
evolution, namely 12q24.31 (HNF1A, near LHX5 and on
the same arm as the HOXC cluster) and 17q12 (HNF1B,
between LHX1 and the HOXB cluster) (Figure 4). The use

BMC Biology 2007, 5:47

of the A and B suffixes is unfortunate, as numerals are generally used to distinguish paralogs of this age, but is
retained at present due to widespread and stable use. The
homeodomain encoded by the human HMBOX1 gene is
atypical in possessing 15 extra amino acid residues
between the second and third alpha helices (Additional
file 6). Phylogenetic analyses confirm previous suggestions [67] that HMBOX1 is more distantly related to
HNF1A and HNF1B (Figure 3; Additional files 1, 2 and 5).
We place this gene in a separate gene family (Hmbox)
within the same class. We have not found any human
HNF-class pseudogenes.
The SINE homeobox class
The SINE class (named after the Drosophila gene so: sine
oculis) encodes proteins with a SIX domain N-terminal to
a typical homeodomain. The SIX domain is a DNA-binding domain of approximately 115 amino acids; both the
SIX domain and the homeodomain are required for DNA
binding [68].

We have identified a total of six SINE-class homeobox
genes in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4), consistent
with previous work [68,69]. The genes form a distinct
grouping even if the SIX domain is disregarded – phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains recover the SIX class as a
monophyletic group (Figure 3; Additional files 1, 2 and
5). Phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains divide the
SIX class into three gene families (Figure 3; Additional
files 1, 2 and 5), consistent with previous studies [68,69].
Each gene family has two human members and dates to a
single ancestral gene in the most recent common ancestor
of bilaterians [68,69]. We have not found any human
SINE-class pseudogenes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

this maintains consistent terminology throughout the
present paper. Phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains
divide the TALE class into six gene families (Figure 3;
Additional files 1, 2 and 5), including an Mkx family containing the recently described MKX gene, which is distinguished from Irx-family genes phylogenetically and by
absence of an IRX domain [73,74]. It should be noted that
the established name of the Pknox gene family does not
indicate orthology with Knox-family genes of plants. We
have also identified a total of 10 TALE-class pseudogenes
in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4); we have named
six of these (IRX4P1, TGIF1P1 and TGIF2P1 to TGIF2P4),
and revised the nomenclature of two others (IRX1P1 and
PBX2P1).
‫ ؠ‬IRX1P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 646390]. This sequence was
previously known as IRXA1; we rename it IRX1P1 because
it is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of IRX1 and not
a functional gene. The IRX1P1 sequence aligns to the
mRNA of IRX1 but has a frameshift mutation and two
stop codons in the homeobox.
‫ ؠ‬IRX4P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 100009671]. We designate this
previously unannotated sequence IRX4P1 because it is
clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of IRX4. The IRX4P1
sequence is a partial integrant derived from a region of the
IRX4 mRNA around the stop codon; it lacks the homeobox.
‫ ؠ‬PBX2P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 5088]. This sequence was previously known as PBXP1; we rename it PBX2P1 because it
is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of PBX2. The
former name of PBXP1 did not indicate its transcript of
origin. The PBX2P1 sequence aligns to the mRNA of PBX2
but has a frameshift mutation in the coding region.

The TALE homeobox class
TALE (three amino acid loop extension) class genes are
distinguished by the presence of three extra amino acids
between the first and second alpha helices of the encoded
homeodomain [1,2,70]. Genes belonging to the TALE
class encode proteins with various domains outside of the
atypical homeodomain.

‫ ؠ‬TGIF1P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 126052]. We designate this
previously unannotated sequence TGIF1P1 because it is
clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of TGIF1. The locus
has many sequence alterations when compared to TGIF1
mRNA, including a 48 nucleotide insertion within the
homeobox.

We have identified a total of 20 TALE-class homeobox
genes in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4). The genes
form a distinct grouping in phylogenetic analyses even
when the three extra homeodomain residues are excluded
from the sequence alignment (Figure 3; Additional file 5).
Bürglin [2] has given the TALE group the rank of 'superclass' and distinguished between several 'classes' by the
presence of distinct domains outside of the homeodomain. These are the IRX domain, MKX domains, the MEIS
domain, the PBC domain and TGIF domains [2,71-73].
Along with some others [4,7,24], we have given the TALE
group the rank of 'class' containing several 'gene families';

‫ ؠ‬TGIF2P1 [GeneID: 126826], TGIF2P2 [GeneID:
100009674], TGIF2P3 [GeneID: 100009672] and
TGIF2P4 [GeneID: 100009673]. These four sequences
were unannotated prior to this study. We designate them
TGIF2P1 to TGIF2P4 because they are clearly pseudogenes
of TGIF2. Each aligns to the mRNA sequence of TGIF2 but
with sequence alterations, indicating origin by retrotransposition. TGIF2P1 has many sequence alterations, including a frameshift mutation in the homeobox. TGIF2P2 and
TGIF2P3 are very similar neighboring loci that must have
originated by tandem duplication of a retrotransposed
TGIF2 mRNA; neither includes the homeobox. TGIF2P4 is

Page 21 of 28

BMC Biology 2007, 5:47

a short partial integrant derived from part of the 3'
untranslated region of TGIF2 mRNA.
The CUT homeobox class
The CUT class (named after the Drosophila gene cut) generally encodes proteins with one or more CUT domains
N-terminal to a typical homeodomain. The CUT domain
is a DNA-binding domain of approximately 75 amino
acids [75]. There are three widely recognized gene families
within the CUT class in humans (Onecut, Cux, Satb;
[76]). A fourth gene family (Cmp), lacking a CUT domain
but sharing a CMP domain with the Satb gene family, is
absent from vertebrates. Bürglin and Cassata [76] have
proposed that the vertebrate Satb gene family evolved
from the invertebrate Cmp gene family.

We have identified a total of seven CUT-class homeobox
genes in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4). Although
grouped together by presence of CUT domains, the homeodomains of the Onecut, Cux and Satb gene families are
quite divergent and do not always form a monophyletic
group in phylogenetic analyses (Additional files 2 and 5).
Topologies that separate the gene families are also only
weakly supported, so it is most parsimonious to assume
that the class is actually monophyletic but the constituent
genes underwent rapid sequence divergence following
their initial duplications. We have revised the nomenclature of two CUT-class genes (CUX1 and CUX2). We have
also identified a total of three CUT-class pseudogenes in
the human genome (Tables 1 and 4); we have named all
of these (CUX2P1, CUX2P2 and SATB1P1).
‫ ؠ‬CUX1 [Entrez Gene ID: 1523] and CUX2 [Entrez Gene
ID: 23316]. These genes were previously known as CUTL1
and CUTL2 respectively. We rename them CUX1 and
CUX2 in accordance with homeobox gene nomenclature
convention.
‫ ؠ‬CUX2P1 and CUX2P2. These sequences were unannotated prior to this study. We designate them CUX2P1 and
CUX2P2 because they are clearly retrotransposed pseudogenes of CUX2. Both are short partial integrants derived
from CUX2 mRNA, excluding the homeobox – CUX2P1
covers part of the coding region at the 5' end and CUX2P2
part of the 3' untranslated region.
‫ ؠ‬SATB1P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 100033410]. We designate
this previously unannotated sequence SATB1P1 because it
is clearly a retrotransposed pseudogene of SATB1.
SATB1P1 is a short partial integrant derived from part of
the 3' untranslated region of SATB1 mRNA; it does not
encompass the homeobox.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

The PROS homeobox class
The PROS class (named after the Drosophila gene pros)
encodes proteins with a PROS domain C-terminal to an
atypical homeodomain. The PROS domain is a DNAbinding domain of approximately 100 amino acids [77].
PROS-class genes encode a highly divergent homeodomain with three extra amino acids. These additional residues are inserted at a different position compared to the
TALE class, being between the second and third alpha helices (Additional file 6).

We have identified a total of two PROS-class homeobox
genes in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4), which we
have placed in a single gene family (Prox). The highly
divergent homeodomain sequence and unusual structural
features provide justification for PROS being a separate
gene class, despite the small number of genes. In phylogenetic analyses, PROS-class homeodomains are situated on
a long branch, very distant from other classes (Figure 3;
Additional files 1, 2 and 5). The human PROX1 gene is
well characterized; we have identified and named its paralog, PROX2. We have not found any human PROS-class
pseudogenes.
‫ ؠ‬PROX2 [Entrez Gene ID: 283571]. We designate this previously unannotated gene PROX2 on the basis of clear
orthology to the mouse Prox2 gene, inferred from
sequence identity and synteny. The homeobox of human
PROX2 has two introns and unusually the splice sites of
the first (5') intron (AT-AA) do not follow the GT-AG
donor-acceptor rule. This has also been noted for mouse
Prox2 [78].
The ZF homeobox class
The ZF (zinc finger) class generally encodes proteins with
zinc finger motifs, in addition to one or more homeodomains. As noted earlier, phylogenetic analyses of homeodomains does not recover the ZF class as a monophyletic
group (Figure 3; Additional files 1, 2 and 5). We recognize
that this suggests that zinc finger motifs and homeodomains may have been brought together on three separate
occasions in evolution; nonetheless, it is convenient and
informative to group these into a single class. Inclusion of
the HOMEZ gene in the ZF class may be surprising, as this
gene does not encode zinc fingers. However, as previously
noted [79] and reproduced in our phylogenetic analyses
(Figure 3; Additional files 1, 2 and 5), the multiple homeodomain sequences of this gene are clearly related to
those encoded by the ZHX1, ZHX2 and ZHX3 genes.

We have identified a total of 14 ZF-class homeobox genes
in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4), which we have
placed in five gene families (Adnp, Tshz, Zeb, Zfhx and
Zhx/Homez). We have also identified one ZF-class pseudogenes in the human genome (Tables 1 and 4). We have

Page 22 of 28

BMC Biology 2007, 5:47

revised the nomenclature of five of these loci (ADNP2,
ZEB1, ZEB2, ZEB2P1 and ZFHX3).
‫ ؠ‬ADNP2 [Entrez Gene ID 22850]. This gene was previously known as ZNF508; we rename it ADNP2 to reflect
its paralogous relationship to ADNP.
‫ ؠ‬ZEB1 [Entrez Gene ID: 6935] and ZEB2 [Entrez Gene ID:
9839]. These genes were previously known as ZFHX1A
and ZFHX1B respectively. We rename them ZEB1 and
ZEB2 to distinguish them from genes belonging to the distantly related Zfhx gene family.
‫ ؠ‬ZEB2P1 [Entrez Gene ID: 100033412]. This retrotransposed pseudogene of ZEB2 has been described previously
[80]. Our new nomenclature (ZEB2P1) reflects the origin
of this locus.
‫ ؠ‬ZFHX3 [Entrez Gene ID: 463]. This gene was previously
known as ATBF1; we rename it ZFHX3 to reflect its close
relationship to ZFHX2 and ZFHX4; indeed ZFHX3 was a
synonym for this gene.
The CERS homeobox class
The highly unusual CERS (ceramide synthase) class, also
known as the LASS (longevity assurance) class, comprises
a single gene family that is highly conserved amongst
eukaryotes and includes the yeast gene and original member LAG1. There are six CERS-class genes in the human
genome (CERS1 to CERS6) and five of these (CERS2 to
CERS6) encode proteins with a homeodomain sequence
[81,82]. These are, however, extremely divergent from the
homeodomains of other gene classes. Secondary structure
prediction analyses suggest these sequences have the
potential to encode three alpha helices in the appropriate
positions (data not shown). The most surprising characteristic of these genes is that biochemical studies predict
them to encode transmembrane proteins, with the homeodomain on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and hence they could not act as DNAbinding proteins or transcription factors [81,82]. It is possible that an ancestor of these genes gained a homeobox
through exon shuffling, or alternatively this could represent convergent evolution. We include only CERS2 to
CERS6 in our comprehensive compilation of human
homeobox genes, as CERS1 lacks a homeobox motif.
Chromosomal distribution of human homeobox genes
The chromosomal locations of genes can give clues to evolutionary ancestry, including patterns of gene duplication,
and the possible existence of gene clusters. In Figure 4, we
show the chromosomal locations of all human homeobox genes. We do not include probable pseudogenes on
these ideograms, because most of these have originated by
reverse transcription of mRNA and secondary integration

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/47

into the genome, and hence give no insight into ancestral
locations of genes. The highly repetitive DUX1 to DUX5
sequences are also not shown, as these have undergone
secondary amplification and are also most likely nonfunctional (see above).
The first observation is that there are homeobox genes on
every human chromosome. Even the two sex chromosomes harbor homeobox genes, with SHOX (short stature
homeobox) in the PAR1 pseudoautosomal region at the tip
of the short arms of X and Y being the best known. Haploinsufficiency of SHOX is implicated in the short stature
phenotype of Turner syndrome patients who lack one
copy of the X chromosome [83]. There are also nine other
homeobox genes in non-pseudoautosomal regions of the
X chromosome, including three tandemly-arranged members of the Rhox gene family, collectively homologous to
the multiple Rhox (reproductive homeobox) genes of
mouse. Only one of the homeobox genes on the X chromosome, the TALE-class gene TGIF2LX, has a distinct
homolog on the Y chromosome, called TGIF2LY. These
genes map to the largest homology block shared by the
unique regions of the X and Y chromosomes, spanning
3.5 Mb. It has been proposed that the ancestor of these
two genes arose by retrotransposition of TGIF2 mRNA
[84].
The autosomes with the lowest number of homeobox
genes are chromosomes 21 (with just PKNOX1) and 22
(with GSC2 and ISX). Examination of the remaining autosomes reveals that homeobox genes are quite dispersed
with some interesting regional accumulations. The best
known examples of close linkage between homeobox
genes are the four Hox clusters on human chromosomes
2, 7, 12 and 17, comprising 9, 11, 9 and 10 genes respectively; each of these is shown as just a single line on each
ideogram for simplicity (Figure 4). These should not be
considered in isolation, however, because many other
ANTP-class genes map in the vicinity of the Hox clusters
[26,27]. These include genes very tightly linked to the Hox
clusters, notably the Evx-family genes (on chromosomes 2
and 7), Dlx-family genes (on chromosomes 2 and 17),
and Meox-family genes (on chromosomes 2 and 17).
There are other concentrations of ANTP-class genes away
from the Hox clusters. These are the ParaHox cluster
(GSX1, PDX1, CDX2) on chromosome 13, and four sets of
NKL-subclass genes on 2p/8p (split), 4p, 5q and 10q,
hypothesized to be derived from an ancestral array by
duplication [26,33]. The accumulation on the distal half
of the long arm of chromosome 10 is particularly striking,
comprising eleven ANTP-class genes from 10 gene families. This is not a tight gene cluster, but it is compatible
with ancestry by extensive tandem gene duplication followed by dispersal. Discounting the rather aberrant case

Page 23 of 28
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2007, 5:47

of the Hox clusters, this region of the long arm of chromosome 10 is the most homeobox-rich region of the human
genome.
There are additional groupings of homeobox genes outside the ANTP class. These include two TALE-class Irx clusters on chromosomes 5 and 16 homologous to the
described mouse Irx clusters [19], and a set of PRD-class
genes on chromosome 19 proposed to be derived from
the CRX homeobox gene by duplication and rapid divergence [21]. Perhaps the most interesting case, however, is
found on the tip of the long arm of chromosome 9, where
there is a concentration of homeobox genes from disparate gene classes. Four LIM-class genes, one ANTP-class
gene, one PRD-class gene and one TALE-class gene are
found in this location. Although dispersed over a large
region, and not forming a tight gene cluster, the linkages
are nonetheless intriguing. It is possible that these linkages reflect ancestry from the very ancient gene duplications that must have generated the distinctive homeobox
gene classes found within animal genomes.

Conclusion
We identified 300 homeobox loci in the euchromatic
regions of the human genome, and divide these into 235
probable functional genes and 65 probable pseudogenes.
Not all of these loci possess a homeobox because for completeness we include all sequences derived from homeobox-containing genes. The number of homeobox
sequences is also different from the number of loci
because several genes contain multiple homeobox motifs.
The figures exclude the repetitive DUX1 to DUX5 homeobox sequences of which we identified 35 probable pseudogenes, with many more expected in heterochromatic
regions.
New or revised nomenclature is proposed for approximately 70 of the 300 homeobox loci in order to clarify
orthologous relationships between human and mouse, to
indicate evolutionary relationships within a gene family,
to distinguish genes from pseudogenes, and to indicate
pseudogene origins. The loci are also classified into a simple hierarchical scheme, comprising 102 gene families
within eleven gene classes. The classification scheme proposed may be widely applicable to homeobox genes from
other animals.
The 235 probable functional homeobox genes map to
every human chromosome with some interesting regional
concentrations of genes. These include a large number of
ANTP-class genes on the distal end of the long arm of
chromosome 10, and a combination of LIM-, ANTP-,
PRD- and TALE-class genes on the distal end of the long
arm of chromosome 9. These associations may be remnants of common ancestry early in animal evolution.

Methods
The finished human genome sequence (build 35.1) was
subjected to a series of tBLASTn searches [85,86] using
known homeodomain sequences from the ANTP, PRD,
LIM, POU, HNF, SINE, TALE, CUT, PROS and ZF classes.
No arbitrary E-value cut-off was selected, but instead each
list of hits was analyzed manually until true homeodomain sequences ceased to be detected. Definition of a
homeodomain used a combination of CD-search for conserved protein domains implemented through BLASTp
[85,86] and secondary structure prediction by JPred
implemented through the Barton Group, University of
Dundee [87]. Each time a new or divergent homeodomain match was found, the tBLASTn process was
repeated. Six very divergent gene families were undetected
by this method but found by text searching: Hopx, Adnp,
Tshz, Zeb, Zhx/Homez and Cers. To ensure that every
pseudogene was detected, including truncated or decayed
versions lacking the homeobox, the full mRNA sequence
of each gene was deduced and used in a BLASTn search of
the human genome sequence [85,86]. Pseudogenes were
recognized as those genomic regions with similarity to
non-repetitive DNA sequences of the parent gene, even if
aligning to only part of the locus. Pseudogenes undergo
mutational decay and would eventually become unrecognizable, but in practice ambiguous cases were not encountered. Exon-intron structures of novel loci were deduced
by comparison between genomic sequence and cDNA,
EST or retrotransposed pseudogene sequences, as previously described [21]. Several unnamed human loci were
identified as probable orthologs of known mouse genes;
orthology was deduced by a combination of homeodomain sequence similarity and synteny, examined through
the mouse genome sequence (build 34.1) and the
Ensembl Genome Browser [88].
Phylogenetic analyses were performed with homeodomain sequences, after each had been edited to an alignment of 60 amino acids (Additional file 7), using the
maximum likelihood [89] and neighbor-joining [90]
methods. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed
using PhyML [91], with a JTT model of amino acid substitution, four categories of between-site rate heterogeneity,
a gamma distribution parameter estimated from the data
and 500 bootstrap resamplings. Neighbor-joining trees
were constructed using PHYLIP (.)[92], with a JTT model
of amino acid substitution and 1000 bootstrap resamplings. For defining human gene families, all Drosophila
homeodomains were first combined with all human
homeodomains in maximum likelihood and neighborjoining analyses to enable divergent Drosophila genes to be
identified and removed. These include genes lost from
human, as well genes known to have undergone unusually rapid evolution in Drosophila. For the Hox3 family the
rapidly evolving Drosophila genes bcd, zen and zen2 were

Page 24 of 28

BMC Biology 2007, 5:47

then replaced by an ortholog from centipede (Sm Hox3b),
and for the Nk4 family the rapid evolving Drosophila gene
tin was replaced by an ortholog from annelid (Pd NK4). In
addition, six genes from other protostome or cnidarian
genomes were added to represent gene families known to
be missing from Drosophila (Pdx family: Ps Xlox; Alx family: Nv CART1; Dmbx family: Hv manacle; Pou1 family: Nv
POU1; Hnf1 family: Nv HNF; Pknox family: Am Prep).
Only 100 bootstrap resamplings were performed on this
dataset because of its large size (354 homeodomains).
Trees were displayed using TreeExplorer [93]. Genes
encoding partial homeodomains, and probable pseudogenes, were not included in the phylogenetic analyses.
With short alignments, phylogenetic trees can only be
used as guides to relationships, not absolute indicators of
evolutionary history, and the trees presented in this paper
should be interpreted in this light.

these cases synteny within and between genomes clearly resolves gene families. Detailed relationships between different gene families should not be

Multiple sequence alignment of all human plus selected protostome
and cnidarian homeodomains. The consensus homeodomain sequence
(shown several times for reference) was derived from a compilation of 247
human homeodomain sequences. The three horizontal lines indicate the
positions of the three alpha-helices. The numbering scheme refers to amino
acid position in the canonical 60-amino-acid homeodomain; insertions
relative to this sequence are shown when present. Black shaded resides are
invariant between all human homeodomains within each class (or family
in the case of the ZF homeodomains). Sequence accession numbers are
shown. For each gene family designation, maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining bootstrap support values are indicated (see Additional files 1
and 2). These values are not shown if the gene family does not form a
monophyletic group in phylogenetic analyses (in which case n/a is written)
or if an invertebrate homolog could not be found.
