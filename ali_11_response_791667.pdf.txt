Abstract
Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3a is known to show comparatively better response to combination
therapy than genotype 1 and 4. Mutations within NS5A gene of HCV have earlier been implicated with response
to interferon (IFN) therapies in chronic HCV patients among various populations. As response to therapy are
available in different populations because of the ethnic and viral factors and there was no study available on the
phenomenon of resistivity to IFN.
Results: Chronic HCV 3a infected Pakistani patients were kept on IFN-a and ribavirin therapy for six months. NS5A
gene of HCV was amplified and sequenced in the case of all the patients prior to therapy and the sequences were
analysed for mutations. Out of the total 27 patients, 20 (74.07%) were observed with sustained virological response
(SVR), 4 (14.81%) patients were non responder (NR) while 3 (11.11%) patients exhibited in end of treatment
response (ETR). Three (3/20) (15%) SVR patients and two (2/3) ETR patients had mutations (ranging from I-V amino
acids) within the NS5A ISDR regions. While the rest of the SVR patients (85%) and the NR had no mutations at
ISDR region when compared with HCV K3a ISDR.
Conclusions: Mutations within the NS5A gene of HCV 3a genotype may not influence the outcome of
combination therapy in Pakistani populations.
Keywords: HCV genotype 3a, IFN, NS5A gene

Introduction
The global prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is 2.2%, corresponding to about 130 million HCVpositive persons worldwide [1]. Chronic hepatitis C viral
infection can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [2]. The only drug that effectively reduces viral
load is interferon-a (IFN-a) [3] and currently combination of IFN and ribavirin is the current treatment of
choice [4,5]. HCV variants with mutations within the
nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) appeared to be more
sensitive to therapy, suggesting that NS5A played a role
in conferring IFN-resistance, thus this region was
termed as IFN-sensitivity determining region (ISDR).

Several studies showed that multiple mutations within
ISDR are associated with IFN-a sensitivity in HCV-1a/b
infected patients [6-9]. In patients infected with HCV
genotype 3a isolates, no association between the number
of mutations within the ISDR and treatment response
was observed [10,11]. Recently, ISDR mutations with
response to IFN-therapy in the case of HCV 1b have
been correlated [12,13], but no such correlation was
found in the case of HCV subtypes 3b and 1a [14].
Individuals infected with HCV genotype 1a/b show
response rates of 38-52%, whereas 66-88% of those
infected with genotypes 2 and 3 achieve sustained virological response (SVR). It is likely that the sensitivity or
resistance to antiviral therapy is governed by both the
virus and the host itself [15]. The clinical correlation
between amino acid substitution within the NS5A 23282376
including the ISDR according to K-3a [16] and

response to antiviral treatment in HCV-3a infected
patients; which is the predominant HCV genotype in
Pakistan [17] is not as well known as for HCV-1a and
HCV-1b infected patients. This study has attempted to
elucidate the virological and biochemical aspects of
HCV-3a infection, as well as to determine mutations in
the NS5A 2328-2376 including the ISDR and correlate it
with IFN-a and ribavirin standard therapy in chronically
infected patients in Pakistan.

Materials and methods
Patients

Thirty patients (13 women, 17 men, average age 40
years (range 20-60 years) chronically infected with HCV
subtype 3a and without any prior history of antiviral
treatment were enrolled for this study. The estimated
duration of infection varied from 6 months to 10 years
(variable history) in different patients. The diagnosis of
chronic HCV was based on elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) levels for at least six months and consistent
detection of serum HCV RNA. HCV antibodies (3 rd
generation ELISA) were detected in each patient. All
patients were negative for HBs Ag.
Treatment

All the patients received 3 million IU of recombinant
IFN-a three times weekly subcutaneously and ribavirin
(10 mg/day/kg body weights) for a total of 24 weeks.
Twenty-seven patients completed the therapy, while
three of them including two male and a female patient
opted to quit with it because of sever side effects.
Informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Patients Monitoring

In this study patients were monitored for HCV RNA
presence and ALT level during and following treatment.
Efficacy of treatment was assessed with normalization of
ALT and absence of serum HCV RNA measured at
week 12 and 24 and being undetectable at the end of
the treatment at week 24 which constituted the end of
treatment response and at the end of follow up at 12 or
24 months which constituted the sustained viral
response for patients infected with HCV 3a. Doses of
IFN were adjusted according to the platelet and white
blood cells counts of the patient. Moreover, the doses of
ribavirin varied according to the weight and the hemoglobin level of the individual patients.

the laboratory work was carried out in the same centre.
HCV RNA detection, Quantitation and HCV Genotyping

Serum HCV RNA was detected by reverse transcriptionPCR based on the highly conserved 5’ untranslated
genomic region for confirmation of HCV infection.
Quantification of HCV RNA was performed with real
time PCR (Smart Cycler Cepheid USA). Genotyping of
HCV was performed by type-specific PCR [18]. Qualitative and quantitative PCRs were repeated at various
intervals of time during the treatment.
Amplification of HCV NS5A cDNA by PCR

In HCV isolates of all HCV-3a-infected patients, the
NS5A region was amplified after reverse transcription by
nested PCR. The first round of PCR was performed
using external sense primer OS5A-3a (5’-TACCGGACCCAGCACACCTTGCCCA-3’; nucleotide position
6555-6579 according to HCV-K3a) and antisense primer
OA5A-3a (5’-GCTGAATTGTTCTTTTCCTCCGTGG3’; nucleotide position 7336-7360). After an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 2 minutes, 30 cycles of 94°C
for 45 seconds, 55°C for 45 seconds, and 72°C for 1
minutes was performed in a PE9700 thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus). In the second round of the nested
PCR, 30 cycles using internal sense primer IS5A-3a (5’TACTGAAGTGGATGGGGTGAGAATC-3’; nucleotide
position 6723-6747 according to HCV-K3a) and the
internal antisense primer IA5A-3a (5’-GGCGCATCCATGGACAGTTGGTGGT-3’; nucleotide position
7278-7302) was performed as described for the first
round of the PCR. The resulting amplification product
was analyzed on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium
bromide.
Sequencing

For direct sequencing of the NS5A gene of HCV-3a isolates including codons 2328-2376 according to HCV
K3a, 20 μL each of the PCR products was purified from
agarose gel by Pure Link™ Quick Gel Extraction Kit
(http://www.invitrogen.com). Sequencing was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Big Dye
Deoxy Terminators; Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt,
Germany). Sequencing of both positive and negative
strands on automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems
310 DNA Sequencer) was carried out.
Analysis of sequences

HCV RNA Extraction

HCV RNA was extracted from 100 μl serum sample by
using RNA isolation kit (Gentra USA), according to the
kit protocol, in Centre of Excellence in Molecular

The HCV NS5A2328-2376protein sequences derived from
the samples were aligned with HCV-K-3a prototype
sequences and phylogenetic analysis was carried out
with the help of GeneTyx for windows (Version 5.1).

Results
Confirmation of HCV 3a infection

To rule out the possibility of mixed infections with HBV
or other HCV genotypes and to determine active HCV
infection among the group members, initial qualitative
PCR followed by genotype-specific PCR was carried out.
It was confirmed that the patients selected were chronically infected with HCV 3a.
Outcome of combination therapy

Of the 27 patients who completed antiviral treatment,
20 patients achieved sustained virological response
(SVR) patients with undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks
after termination of therapy. In 3 patients a virological
response with negative HCV RNA at the end of treatment but relapse thereafter was observed (ETR) patients.
Four patients revealed no virological response (NR) to
antiviral therapy at the end of treatment were observed.
Analysis of mutations in the NS5A2328-2376 region

After confirmation of HCV-3a infection in the case of
all volunteers, NS5A2328-2376 sequences (which include
the ISDR) at various intervals of time during the therapy
were analyzed. The mean number of mutations in SVR
patients was 1.4 (range 1-5), 3 (1-5) in ETR patients and
1 in NR patients (Figure 1).
Out of 23 responders, 18 patients had a single mutation which was also shared by all the non responders.
The remaining five samples had 2-5 mutations which
were very much variable among all the five responders
(SVR and ETR patients). Furthermore the two ETR
patients with significant number of mutations had a
relapse just within 12 months of the follow up period.
Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates compared to HCV
K-3a also did not show significant distances (Figure 1).
We could not find any nucleotide mutations in the case
of the non-responders and the ETR group patients,
when the ISDR region was compared at the beginning,
at 12 weeks or at 24 weeks of the combination therapy.
Levels of viremia

In order to monitor primarily the response to IFN based
therapy among 27 HCV-3a infected people; the viral load
was measured at the beginning and during the course of
the treatment. The initial viral load in SVR patients ranged
from 5.03 to 5.68 log10 IU/ml, which dropped to the un-

detectable level just after 12 weeks. In case of the ETR
patients the viral load ranged from 5.35 to 5.56 log10 IU/
ml. After 12 weeks, all the ETR group samples were positive for HCV RNA but with significant decrease in viral
load. At the end of treatment, HCV RNA was not detected
in these samples. The viral load of the non-responders
showed a considerable decrease, but remained detectable
throughout the time period of this study. Initially it ranged
from 6.02 to 6.14 log10 IU/ml which fell down to an average 5.44 log10 IU/ml at the end of treatment.
Enzymes Level

Assessment of the ALT enzyme level before treatment
showed significantly higher values compared to a healthy
control (5-40 U/liter). The mean value in responders was
estimated to be 67.608 ± 12.2835 U/liter at the beginning
of treatment, which eventually fell after treatment to
26.00 ± 4.9635 U/liter, which is within the normal range.
Also, in non-responders, the mean value was found to be
72.75 ± 11.4419U/liter before treatment, which was
reduced to 28.25 ± 3.304U/liter after treatment. Similarly,
assessment of the AST level showed the mean value for
the responders to be 74.8261 ± 14.4557U/liter, and that
for non-responders was 80.00 ± 12.3828U/liter before
treatment. Though, in both the cases, the enzyme levels
were reduced to normal after treatment: responders
showed 26.91 ± 8.857 U/liter, and for non-responders it
was 29.25 ± 3.4034 U/liter.

Discussion
Genetic heterogeniety has earlier been documented and
the HCV genotype is the strongest predictive parameter

for sustained virological response [19]. The NS5A gene
of HCV has been reported to influence the outcome of
IFN-based therapies in the case of people infected with
various genotypes of HCV including HCV 3a [6,20,21].
Race and ethnicity have also been implicated to influence IFN responsiveness in chronic HCV patients [22].
HCV genotype 3a is the most abundant in Pakistan [23]
and it has earlier been documented that HCV genotype
3a is more responsive to therapy as compared to genotype 1 or 4 [8,21]. Despite better response rate, the phenomenon of viral resistance is not uncommon in
Pakistan. Initial viral load and biochemical profiles of
chronic HCV patients also influence the outcome of
therapy [24]. Earlier, in Pakistan, viral resistance in
chronic HCV patients has never been investigated. The
purpose of this study was to find out correlation if any
of the IFN-responsiveness with mutations in the NS5A
gene, initial viral load and the biochemical profiles of
patients.
Our results indicated that out of the total 27 patients
who had completed the six months combination therapy against HCV, 20 patients attained sustained virological response, 3 patients exhibited an end of
treatment response while four patients were nonresponders. The entire NS5A sequences of all HCV 3a
isolates did not show any significant number of mutations to be correlated with treatment response in the
case of different groups of patients. However, a number of mutations were found in the ISDR region of the
NS5A protein and that is why the region was used for
predicting response to therapy in Pakistani patients.
When compared with HCV K3a prototype sequence,
among the three ETR patients, ETR2 and ETR3 exhibited one mutation each in the ISDR region at position
2212 (K-N) and position 2244 (V-I) respectively. In the
case of ETR1, In addition, both ETR2 and SVR1 also
exhibited a (W-S) mutation at position 2233 while
other mutations in the later including an (R-S), (G-R)
and (K-T) mutations were observed at positions 2219,
2238 and 2212 of the ISDR region. Other mutations
found in SVR patients include a (P-V) mutation in
SVR8 at position 2224 and (V-I) mutation at position
2227. When compared with HCV K3a prototype
sequence, SVR5 had another mutation (I-V) at position
2244 which was also found in the case of SVR1.
Although a number of mutations were observed in the
case of SVR and ETR patients, yet non were observed
in the case of non-responders when compared with
HCV K3a. The data indicates that the number of
mutations found in SVR and ETR patients significantly
correlates with the outcome of therapy in the case of
SVR1, SVR5, SVR8 and the ETR patients but the fact
that majority of the SVR patients share the same
sequence as that of the non-responders rules out the

possibility of these mutations playing a significant role
with respect to viral resistance in chronic HCV
patients of Pakistan. Other regional studies are in concordance with earlier findings [12,13]. In this study,
neither the entire NS5A gene nor the ISDR region
could be correlated with response to combination therapy in Pakistani HCV 3a infected patients.
The ALT levels and the initial viral load are also considered to predict response to therapy [24]. In this
study, we observed that patients with lower viral titers
before the start of treatment exhibited a significantly
better response rate as compared to those with higher
viral titers.

Conclusion
Mutation in the NS5A gene of HCV genotype 3a may
not affects the outcome of combination therapy in
infected Pakistani patients. Mutations in the ISDR, along
with mutations in other parts of the viral genome
coupled with several other factors e.g. initial viremia,
gender, may have a concerted effect on responsiveness
to combination therapy.
