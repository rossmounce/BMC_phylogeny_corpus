Abstract
Background: Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) (EC 2.4.2.8) is a central
enzyme in the purine recycling pathway. Parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida cannot
synthesize purines de novo and use the salvage pathway to synthesize purine bases, making this an
attractive target for antiparasitic drug design.
Results: The glycosomal HGPRT from Leishmania tarentolae in a catalytically active form purified
and co-crystallized with a guanosine monophosphate (GMP) in the active site. The dimeric
structure of HGPRT has been solved by molecular replacement and refined against data extending
to 2.1 Å resolution. The structure reveals the contacts of the active site residues with GMP.
Conclusion: Comparative analysis of the active sites of Leishmania and human HGPRT revealed
subtle differences in the position of the ligand and its interaction with the active site residues, which
could be responsible for the different reactivities of the enzymes to allopurinol reported in the
literature. The solution and analysis of the structure of Leishmania HGPRT may contribute to
further investigations leading to a full understanding of this important enzyme family in protozoan
parasites.

Background
Most known organisms synthesize purine bases by two
pathways. The de novo biosynthesis pathway builds the
purine nucleotide on 5-phosphoribosyl-alpha-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). The salvage pathway recovers purines
(adenine and guanine) from the degradation products of
nucleotide metabolism and from hypoxanthine and xanthine. In contrast, parasitic protozoa such as the members
of the Kinetoplastida order are auxotrophs for purine bases
because the de novo biosynthetic pathway is completely

absent [1]. They are therefore dependent on recycling preformed purine nucleotides and acquiring purines from
the host. Central to the salvage pathway are the phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTases). In Kinetoplastids in
general and Leishmania in particular, three PRTases are
involved in the recycling of purine bases by the salvage
pathway: hypoxanthine-guanine PRTase (HGPRT) (EC
2.4.2.8), adenine PRTase (APRT) (EC 2.4.2.7) and xanthine PRTase (XPRT) (EC 2.4.2.22) [2]. Several PRTases
have been characterized from different organisms, but

crystallization and structure determination have been
accomplished for only two HGPRTs from Kinetoplastids,
the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi [3] and L. tarentolae
(present work).
PRTases are classified as Type I and Type II depending on
their structural and catalytic features. The best-studied
PRTases belong to the 'Type I' group, sharing a common
α/β-fold at the PRPP binding motif and a flexible loop,
besides a core region of at least five parallel β-strands surrounded by three or more helices [4,5]. The 'Type II'
PRTases are composed of a mixed α/β N-terminal domain
and an α/β barrel-like C-terminal domain. Currently,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhimurium quinolinate PRTases are the only known structures in this
group [6,7].
Considerable interest in the salvage pathway as a potential
target for chemotherapy has been stimulated by the differences in purine base metabolism between mammalian
hosts and protozoan parasites [2,8]. The creation of independent Δhgprt, Δaprt and Δxprt null mutants by targeted
gene replacement in L. donovani cells revealed that all
three of the knockout strains generated are viable in the
mouse macrophage model [9]. However, the Δhgprt/Δxprt
double mutant L. donovani strain has less than 5% of the
wild-type capacity to infect macrophages, establishing
HGPRT and XPRT as essential for purine acquisition, parasite viability and infectivity in the mouse model [10].
L. tarentolae has been exploited as a model Leishmania for
a variety of molecular, biochemical and evolutionary
studies because of the ease of cell culture and genetic analysis of this species. In this paper we describe the threedimensional structure of a L. tarentolae HGPRT protein
and compare it with other HGPRT structures deposited in
the Protein Data Bank. In view of the close phylogenetic
relationship, the results will be of general significance as a
model for other species of pathogenic Leishmania.

Results and discussion
General description
The refined crystallographic model of the dimeric HGPRT
from L. tarentolae (PDB code – 1PZM) includes two protein monomers (chains A and B) in the asymmetric unit,
with one molecule of GMP bound to the active site of each
monomer. As summarized in Table 1, the overall quality
of the model is good. The N-terminal regions (residues 1–
19), the active site flexible loops (residues 95–107 from
chain A and 94–105 from chain B), and the C-terminal
regions (residues 202–210) containing a glycosome target
sequence, are absent from the model, since they could not
be located by inspection of the experimental electron density maps.

The monomer structure
Leishmania HGPRT is an α/β protein with the known
PRTase type I fold. It is composed of two domains: a core
domain containing the PRPP binding site [11-13], and a
hood domain that binds the purine base substrate (Figure
1).

The core domain consists of a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet (strands β3, β2, β4, β5 and β6), with one αhelix packed on each side of the sheet (helices α2 and α3).
A small 310 – helix (η2) is present in the core domain. The
central β-sheet is formed by two β/α/β motifs joined sideby-side through the first strand of each motif (β2 and β4).
One further strand (β6) completes the central β-sheet. A
phosphate binding site is present in the loops between the
first β-strand and the α-helix of the β/α/β motif (called
loops I and III respectively). Loops I and III are involved
in binding the two terminal phosphates of PRPP [11-13].
L. tarentolae HGPRT Loop III residues Asp129, Ser130,
Ala131 and Thr133 interact with the GMP phosphate
group.
A flexible loop (loop II, residues 92–118), the function of
which may be related to the formation of the transition
state [11,14,15], comprises a region (residues 106–114)
with good stereochemical and statistical values, which
adopts different conformations in the two chains. In
chain B, the polypeptide partially forms an α-helix (αL)
similar to that in human HGPRT [4], while in chain A this
helix is not observed and the polypeptide conformation
resembles that found in T. cruzi HGPRT [3], Tritrichomonas
foetus HGXPRT [16] and E. coli HPRT [17]. The different
conformations adopted by these residues in the two monomers are consistent with the flexibility generally
observed in the equivalent region (92–118) of other
HGPRTases.
The hood domain contains both the N- and C-termini
and is constituted by a small anti-parallel β-sheet with
three strands (β1, β7 and β8). A loop (loop IV, residues
175–195) connects the β-strand β6 in the core domain to
β8 in the hood-domain. This loop (IV) contains some of
the residues that bind the base of GMP by hydrogen bonding with Val179 and Asp185 and by hydrophobic interaction with Phe178. The other connection between the core
and the hood domain is made by a long α-helix (α1),
which ends with a small 310 – helix (η1). This helix
appears to be important for the structural stability of
HGPRT, since it interacts with all strands of the central βsheet and with helix α2 of the core domain and is also
involved in dimerization contacts.
The dimeric interface
The dimerization interface of Leishmania HGPRT, shown
in figure 2, is stabilized by a complex network of 45 non-

bonded contacts and 12 hydrogen bonds involving 26 residues from dimer A and 25 from dimer B. Most of these
residues are located in helix α2 and Loop IV. The 12
hydrogen bonds are formed between Lys66 (loop I) and
Val88 (strand β3), Glu192 (loop IV) and Val86 (strand
β3) and between residues Asp74 and Arg77 (helix α2),
Asp81 (helix α2), Arg194 (loop IV), Asp74 and Glu30
(helix α1). Asp74 and Glu30 form intra-subunit H-bonds
with Tyr182 and Arg194 (loop IV), respectively (Figure 2).
We observed a similar network of interactions in the T.
cruzi [3], T. foetus [16] and E. coli [17] homologues.

Residues of the dimerization region are also involved in
stabilizing the active site, particularly Arg191 (loop IV)
and Lys66 (loop I) (Figure 3), suggesting a structural
explanation for the fact that Leishmania HGPRT has been
found exclusively as a dimer in both the presence and the
absence of GMP [18]. The dimerization of HGPRT is an
important step in the organization of loops I and IV. This
is supported by mutants of the interface region in Plasmodium falciparum [19] and T. cruzi [20], which show drastically reduced catalytic activity.

Loops from the active site are labeled for monomer A and secondary structure elements are labeled for monomer B. Figures 1-6 were produced using PyMol [42].

Structural water molecules in each monomer (H2O1 and
H2O18) stabilize the polar side chains of Thr37 and
Tyr182 by hydrogen bonds that are found in a hydrophobic region formed by the Trp34, Val33, Phe71 and Phe78
side chains. Moreover, Thr37 and Tyr182 in both Leishmania and Human HGPRT form hydrogen bonds to neighboring Val33 and Asp74, respectively. This water molecule
stabilization is exclusively observed in the Leishmania
structure; in homologous structures, Thr37 is substituted
by a hydrophobic residue.
Comparison of HGPRT structures
The known HGPRT structures of E. coli, S. typhimurium,
Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, T. foetus, T. cruzi, P. falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii and the human enzyme were
compared with L. tarentolae HGPRT. The sequences were
aligned (not shown) and the structures superposed.

A non-proline cis peptide bond between Leu65 and Lys66
from loop I is conserved in type I PRTases
[3,5,11,16,17,21], where the amide nitrogen of Lys66 is
exposed to the active site so that the peptide bond contributes two adjacent hydrogen bonds to the PRPP-metal
complex [11]. However, our structural comparison of
HGPRTs (Figure 3) suggests that the Lys66 cis conformation acts in the communication between monomers and
drives the Arg191 side chain toward the active site into the
correct position to bind PPi (Figure 3). Structures with a
cis conformation in complex with PRPP as well as with PPi
give strong evidence for this [11-14,22,23].
Loop IV is conserved among the HGPRTs and interacts
with the reaction product GMP through hydrogen bonds
(Val179 and Asp185) as well as aromatic π-π stacking
interactions (Phe178). An important contribution to the

stabilization of GMP comes from Lys157 in strand β5,
which makes two hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen base
(atoms O6 and N7) (Figure 4). The two additional hydrogen bonds from Lys157 can be important in stabilizing
the GMP in the active site if only three hydrogen bonds are
formed between the nitrogen base and Loop IV. Moreover, Lys157 forms hydrogen bonds with Ala177 (Loop IV)
allowing Loop IV to be properly positioned to interact
with the base of GMP. Three other residues are conserved
in the HGPRT structures: Gly181 and Asp185 are involved
in Mg2+ binding and Arg191 is involved in PRPP or PPi
binding [11-14,22,23].
Three distinct HGPRT structural groups can be identified,
mainly on the basis of the different sizes of helix α2 in the
core domain and the C and N-terminus sequences of the
hood domain (Figure 5): (I) the group comprising S. typhimurium, E. coli, T. tengcongensis and T. foetus, which have
the shortest helices; (II) the trypanosomatids group
(Leishmania and T. cruzi); and (III) the P. falciparum, T.
gondii and human group, which have the longest helices.

hydrogen bond with the NZ atom of Lys157. In contrast,
the N2 atom of the GMP base in Leishmania HGPRT interacts preferentially with Asp193, and the Lys157 NZ atom
interacts with both O6 and N7 of the base. The interaction
distances are shown in Table 2. The Cα superposed in 11
residues interacting with GMP in the active site of Leishmania and human HGPRT result in an rmsd of 0.66Å. This
analysis shows that residues from Loop IV have the largest
rmsd and the guanine base shows a subtle orientation
shift in this region between the two HGPRTs (Figure 4),
particularly residues Asp129 and Asp185. The ribose of
GMP in both the human and Leishmania enzymes is in the
C3'-endo conformation used in the analysis of the bound
GMP. In human HGPRT, the O3 atom of the ribose forms
a hydrogen bond with OE2 of Glu133, while this hydrogen bond in Leishmania is formed with OD1 of Asp126.
These differences are the result of the C5* atom arrangements (Figure 4), modifying the ribose position in the
active site. According to our comparisons, the Leishmania
HGPRT ribose is better stabilized by those interactions
than the human ribose (Figure 4 and Table 2).

The main differences between the Leishmania and human
enzymes are found in the interactions between the GMP
base and ribose and residues in the active site. Regarding
the GMP base, we observe that in human HGPRT the N2
atom contacts both the oxygen and the carbonyl groups of
Val187 and Asp193 (Loop IV), and the O6 atom forms a

cefatoxime, has an IC50 value similar to allopurinol (Table
3).
HGPRT is a known activator of purine base analogs such
as 6-mercaptopurine and allopurinol, and has been proposed as a target for antiparasitic chemotherapy [2,8].
Allopurinol is metabolized by HGPRT and incorporated
into RNA during transcription, resulting in its degradation
and inhibition of protein synthesis [24]. Allopurinol is
metabolized more efficiently by the parasite HGPRT than
the human homologue [25-27], prompting its evaluation
in the treatment of leishmaniasis [28] and Chagas disease
[25,29] with promising results.
The purine and pyrimidine analogs tested against Leishmania HGPRT present values in the high micromolar range
(94–838 μM, Table 3). Allopurinol in particular has an
IC50 of approximately 0.2 mM and is a more potent inhibitor of Leishmania than of T. cruzi HGPRT [11,13]. In the
analysis of T. cruzi and human HGPRT with HPP (7hydroxy-pyrazolo [4,3-D]pyrimidine, a compound similar to allopurinol) bound to the active site [11,13], subtle
differences were observed in the binding that may be significant for novel compound design [13]. The superposition of HPP-bound active sites of T. cruzi and human

HGPRT with GMP-bound Leishmania HGPRT showed that
the guanine in the Leishmania structure is located in the
same position as HPP in the homologous structures, with
subtle differences that are more pronounced when the
human and Leishmania homologues are compared (Figure
6). The differences between human and Leishmania
HGPRT, like those in the GMP binding residues, as well as
the GMP orientation and H-bond patterns in the active
site, suggest that potential inhibitors may affect the protozoan enzyme differently from human HGPRT. This observation is supported by the high efficiency of incorporation
of allopurinol by the Leishmania and Trypanosoma
enzymes compared to human HGPRT.

Conclusion
The X-ray structure of L. tarentolae HGPRT with GMP
bound at the active site provides the template for comparison with the human enzyme. The subtle differences
observed between the parasite and the human enzyme in
the contacts with ligand can be explored for the design of
potential parasite-specific inhibitors. The dimeric structure of L. tarentolae HGPRT shows an intricate hydrogen
bond network important for enzyme stability and
required for its activity. This analysis, together with the
inhibition experiments using purine and pyrimidine ana-

logs, has revealed differences in the binding efficiency of
the enzyme active site that could be explored in the development of further inhibitors.

Methods
Protein expression, purification and crystallization
The recombinant HGPRT of L. tarentolae was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and purified and co-crystallized with GMP in 19% PEG 4000, 20.6% isopropanol,
5% glycerol, 95 mM tri-sodium citrate, pH 5.6, as
described previously [18]. Crystals grown under those
conditions belonged to the primitive orthorhombic space
group P212121 (a = 58.1Å, b = 85.4Å, c = 87.6Å, α = β = γ
= 90°). Crystals of the free enzyme, which were also
obtained at 18°C in 15% PEG 6000, 100 mM citrate, pH
5.1, diffracted poorly, and the use of additives led to crystals that diffracted only up to 3.0Å. Co-crystallization with
GMP led to better-diffracting crystals up to a resolution of
2.1Å and these were used to solve the atomic structure of
Leishmania HGPRT.
Data collection and processing
L. tarentolae HGPRT crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution without GMP, obtained by diluting the
crystallization reservoir solution with 15% ethylene glycol

(final concentration), mounted on nylon loops, and
flash-cooled to 100 K. Diffraction data were collected at
the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory with monochromatic X-rays (λ = 1.537Å) and a MAR345 image plate
as detector [18]. Two sets of consecutive diffraction
images (75 and 62 images respectively, with 1° rotation
per image) from the same single crystal were collected and
processed. The diffraction images were indexed and integrated using DENZO [30]. SCALEPACK [30] was used to
scale and merge the data up to 2.1Å resolution. The data
reduction statistics are summarized in Table 1.
Structure solution and refinement
The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement
using the deposited structure of the dimeric HPRT of T.
cruzi [3] as search probe (PDB entry 1TC1; 55% sequence
identity). X-ray data in the 20–2.3Å resolution range were
used and one dimeric probe was positioned in the asymmetric unit during the molecular replacement procedure
(program AMoRe) [31]. The molecular replacement solution had a correlation coefficient of 57% and an R-factor
of 43.5%. The molecular replacement model was refined
iteratively in reciprocal and in real space using automated
procedures and visual manipulation. Reciprocal space
refinement was initially performed using the torsional

simulated annealing procedure implemented in the CNS
program [32] and continued using REFMAC5 [33] from
the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project,
Number 4, 1994), using a maximum-likelihood target
with stereochemical restraints, two TLS [34] sets of parameters (one for each protein monomer in the asymmetric
unit), and individually restrained isotropic B-factors. A set
of structure factors representing 5% of the total experimental data was excluded from the reciprocal-space
refinement target for purposes of cross-validation. Two-

fold non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used
initially and gradually removed during the refinement.
The program O [35] was used to inspect the (D|Fo|-m|Fc|)
and (2D|Fo|-m|Fc|) difference Fourier maps and to manipulate the model. Water molecules were added automatically to the model on the basis of the difference Fourier
maps and distance criteria using the program ARP/wARP
version 5.0 [36] from the CCP4 suite.
The stereochemical quality of the crystallographic model
was constantly monitored during refinement using the
PROCHECK [37], WHAT IF [38] and O [35] programs.
The model/experimental map correlation was calculated
using the MAPMAN© program [39]. The refined TLS
parameters and the residual isotropic atomic B-values
were converted to atomic anisotropic displacement
parameters using the program TLSANL [40] from the
CCP4 suite.
Inhibition tests
The HGPRT enzyme inhibition assay was performed for 1
min in a 1 ml reaction volume containing 100 mM TrisHCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM PRPP, 0.04 mM guanine at pH
7.4 [41]. An extinction coefficient of 4.2 was used. Purine
and pyrimidine analogues were tested using six inhibitor
concentrations, in triplicate, to obtain the inhibition
curve and calculate the IC50 values shown in Table 3.
