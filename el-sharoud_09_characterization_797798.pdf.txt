Abstract
Background: Cronobacter is a recently proposed genus consisting of six genomospecies that
encompass the organisms previously identified as Enterobacter sakazakii. Cronobacter are
opportunistic pathogens and are known to cause serious infections in infants, particularly neonates.
High case fatality rates have been associated with infections and acute sequelae can occur in
survivors with severe ramifications on neurological development. Infant formula has been identified
as one route of transmission for infection in infants. However, the primary reservoirs for
subsequent contamination of foods with Cronobacter remain undefined due to the ubiquitous nature
of these organisms. More recently, infections in adults have been reported, especially amongst the
elderly and patients who are immunocompromised. To help prevent the transmission of infection,
it is important to identify the main food sources for Cronobacter. The aim of this study was to
identify and characterize Cronobacter isolated from dried-milk and related products available in an
Egyptian food market.
Results: In total sixteen Cronobacter strains were isolated from 152 dairy-based products. These
were identified and characterized using pheno- and genotyping experiments. Real-time PCR
confirmed the detection of Cronobacter. Following antibiotic susceptibility tests, 3 strains showed
resistance to trimethoprim and/or neomycin. Phenotype profiles were generated based on key
biochemical distinguishing tests. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) identified 8 PFGE types
amongst the collection of strains. Repetitive sequence based PCR (rep-PCR) analysis identified 3
rep-PCR types amongst the collection of strains. Sequencing of the recN gene was used to
differentiate among the recently described species of Cronobacter.
Conclusion: This study identified the presence of Cronobacter in dried milk and related products
sourced from the Nile-Delta region of Egypt. Although the majority of the strains were susceptible
to the antibiotics tested, resistance was observed in three isolates, highlighting the risks associated
with Cronobacter contamination in foods. Phenotype and genotype analysis should be applied to
further characterize Cronobacter spp. and prevent its transmission into food products.

Background
Recent taxonomic work by Iversen et al. [1,2] has led to an
alternative classification of the organism, Enterobacter
sakazakii, and the proposal of a newly defined genus,
Cronobacter. Cronobacter spp. are considered emerging
opportunistic pathogens and are associated with outbreaks of infections amongst infants, in particular
neonates [3-5]. Symptoms include bacteremia, necrotizing enterocolitis and meningitis, with case fatality rates as
high as 80% being reported. The prognosis for survivors is
also poor, with neurological development being severely
affected in many cases [6]. More recently the association
of Cronobacter with infections in adults has been investigated. Gosney et al. [7] described the isolation of Cronobacter from seven adult stroke patients. See et al. [8]
reported a case of bacteremia in a 75 year old woman who
presented with a splenic abscess. In total, thirteen cases of
Cronobacter infections in adults have been documented
from 1985 to present.
The primary origins of Cronobacter spp. remain unknown.
Due to its ubiquitous nature, Cronobacter can be isolated
from a wide variety of foods including milk, cheese, dried
foods, meats, water, vegetables, rice, bread, tea, herbs and
spices [9-14]. Surveillance studies have detected Cronobacter in infant formula production, food processing,
households and clinical environments. Powdered infant
formula (PIF) has been epidemiologically linked to cases
of infection in infants, thus research has specifically
focused on the monitoring of PIF products for the presence of Cronobacter. However, less is known regarding the
prevalence of Cronobacter in other dairy foods. Recently,
El-Sharoud et al. [15] examined dairy products from an
Egyptian market for the occurrence of the organism.
Cronobacter was isolated from skimmed milk and a related
imitation soft cheese.
Identifying foods that may contain Cronobacter is important to discover the possible routes for transmission of
infection. With the indication that Cronobacter spp. infect
both infants and vulnerable adults it is important that a
wider variety of foods now be evaluated. The aim of this
study was firstly, to determine if Cronobacter could be
found present in dried milk and related products and secondly, to characterize any isolates recovered.

Methods
Bacterial Cultures
A summary of the isolates characterized in this study can
be seen in Table 1.
Isolation & Identification
In total 152 dairy-based products obtained within the
Nile-Delta region of Egypt were tested for the presence of
Cronobacter. Additionally, strain CFS-FSMP 1511 from the
environment of a milk powder factory was obtained from

= 10), Kariesh cheese (n = 10) and Ras cheese (n = 10)
(Table 2). Collected samples represented different, commercially available brands of each product type. Domiati
cheese is a traditional Egyptian, highly salted, enzymecoagulated, soft cheese. Similarly, Ras cheese, also typically Egyptian is a hard cheese that is prepared from raw
cow's milk or a mixture of cow and buffalo's milk. Kariesh
cheese is a traditional Egyptian soft cheese that is produced by acid coagulation of skim milk by culturing with
lactic acid bacteria. Sahlab is a dried blend consisting of
dried skim milk, starch and nuts that is reconstituted in
boiling water and served as a hot drink. Isolation was performed according to a modification of the International
Organization for Standards Technical Specification on the
detection of E. sakazakii (ISO/TS 22964). In brief, samples
were diluted 1:10 (w/v) in buffered peptone water (BPW)

(Oxoid CM0509, Hampshire UK) and homogenized.
With regard to dried milk products and powders, 10 g of
product was added to 100 ml BPW. For the various cheese
samples, 25 g of product was added to 225 ml BPW. Following an overnight incubation at 37°C, 10 ml of the preenrichment culture was inoculated into 90 ml of Enterobacteriacae Enrichment (EE) broth and incubated overnight at 37°C. A 10 μl volume of the selective enrichment
was then streaked onto a chromogenic media, DFI agar
(Oxoid CM1055, Hampshire, UK).
Presumptive positive isolates producing blue-green colonies were identified using Rapid ID 32E test galleries
(bioMérieux Ref: 32700, France) as per the manufacturer's
instructions. Isolates identified as Cronobacter (E. sakazakii) were confirmed using a modified version of the realtime PCR method described by Seo and Brackett [16]. In
short, a primer set and probe targeting the dnaG gene
located internally to the macromolecular synthesis
(MMS) operon was applied [17].
The Cronobacter genus currently consists of six genomospecies [18]. To this end, isolates confirmed as Cronobacter
were speciated using biochemical differentiation tests as
described by Iversen et al. [19] and recN gene sequence
analysis (Kuhnert P., Korczak B.M., Stephan R., Joosten
H., Iversen C: Phylogeny and whole genome DNA-DNA
similarity of Enterobacter and related taxa by multilocus
sequence analysis (MLSA)).
Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing
Cronobacter isolates were tested for their susceptibility to
ampicillin (10 μg), compound sulphonamides (300 μg),
furazolidone (15 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), neomycin (30
μg), spectinomycin (100 μg), streptomycin (10 μg), and
trimethoprim (5 μg) using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion
method [20]. Antibiotic disks were obtained from Oxoid,
Hampshire, UK.

Molecular Subtyping
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was applied as
described previously [21]. Analysis was carried out using
BioNumerics software V3.0 (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). A dendrogram was generated using
the DICE coefficient and unweighted pair group method
with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). A band tolerance and
optimization coefficient of 1.5% was applied.

Repetitive sequence-based (rep-PCR) amplification was
performed using an automated rep-PCR system as previously described [22]. Analysis was performed using Diversilab® software V3.3 (Diversilab®, bioMérieux, France).
Isolate similarity was calculated using the Pearson Correlation (PC) coefficient.
recN Gene Sequencing
recN gene sequencing was performed by Fasteris SA (Planles-Ouates, Switzerland) using a modified version of the
method described by Kuhnert et al. (Kuhnert P., Korczak
B.M., Stephan R., Joosten H., Iversen C: Phylogeny and
whole genome DNA-DNA similarity of Enterobacter and
related taxa by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA)).
PCR reactions were carried out in 3 × 15 μl volume, which
were then pooled together. The thermo cycling conditions
employed were as follows: 95°C for 3 min, followed by
30 cycles comprising 95°C for 30 s, 54°C for 30 s and
72°C for 2 min. A final extension of 72°C for 5 min was
applied. The primers used for recN sequencing were:

Es-L_seq1 5'-CTGGCACAATTAACCATCAGTAA-3'
Es-L_seq2 5'-CTGGCACAATTAACCATCAGCAA-3'
Es-R_seq 5'-TGGGTAACGCACATCACCTGAGT-3'

Belgium). Gaps were not considered an extra state. The
Jukes-Cantor correction was used to compensate for divergence being a logarithmic function of time due to the
increased probability of a second substitution at a nucleotide site slowing the increase in the count of differences
as divergence time increases [23]. Felsenstein bootstraps
(1,000 simulations) were applied to assess the level of
confidence for each clade of the observed trees based on
the proportion of bootstrap trees showing the same clade
[24]. The topology of the maximum parsimony tree was
optimized using simulated annealing. [This is a heuristic
approach that occasionally accepts a worse tree during the
course of the search allowing it to escape local optima.
This method is more economical than the more usual
heuristic searches (stepwise addition and hill-climbing),
which can require many random re-starts, especially with
large data matrices].

Presumptive positive isolates produced blue-green colonies on DFI agar and were identified as Cronobacter (E.
sakazakii) using ID 32E test strips. Real-time PCR analysis
confirmed the detection of Cronobacter isolates. Biochemical tests were performed in order to distinguish the phenotypes of the Cronobacter isolates and contribute to the
speciation of the collection of strains. The results of these
tests are shown in Table 3.
Antibiotic Susceptibility
The antibiotic susceptibility testing indicated that all isolates were susceptible to streptomycin, compound sulphonamides, ampicillin, gentamicin, spectinomycin and
furazolidone. Isolates CFS-FSMP 1500 and CFS-FSMP
1512 were found to be resistant to neomycin and isolate
CFS-FSMP 1510 was reported as resistant to trimethoprim
and neomycin. All other isolates were found susceptible
to these two antimicrobial agents (Table 4).

Results
Isolation & Identification
A total of sixteen Cronobacter strains were isolated from
various food products (Table 1). Some of the non-Cronobacter strains isolated included Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris and putative Vibrio cholerae.

PFGE Analysis
Macrorestriction of Cronobacter genomic DNA with XbaI
yielded 10 to 17 DNA fragments ranging in size from 48.5
to 1,000 kbp. A dendrogram was compiled which illustrates the fingerprint pattern similarities between the vari-

ous Cronobacter isolates (Figure 2). In total, 8 pulse-types
(denoted 1 through 8) were identified that showed indistinguishable similarity.
rep-PCR Analysis
The rep-PCR typing yielded between 18 and 25 DNA fragments that ranged in size from 150 to 3,500 bp. A dendrogram representing the genetic relatedness amongst the
isolates was composed (Figure 3). Amongst the collection,
3 rep-PCR cluster groups (denoted A, B and C) were identified that exhibited identical similarity.
recN Gene Sequencing
The results of the recN sequence analysis determined that
two Cronobacter species, C. sakazakii and C. malonaticus,
had been isolated in this study. The sequences of the recN
gene analysis for the following strains were deposited in
the GenBank database: CFS-FSMP 1501 (FJ624476), CFSFSMP 1502 (FJ624470), CFS-FSMP 1504 (FJ624469),

maximum parsimony tree was produced that displays the
genetic relationship amongst the collection of strains (Figure 1). For comparison purposes a representative for each
of the other Cronobacter spp., C. dublinensis (EU569474),
C. genomospecies 1 (EU569479), C. muytjensii

Enterobacter species, E. helveticus (EU569447) and E. pulveris (EU569451), which represent the closest related species of Cronobacter, were also included in the analysis.

Discussion
The focus of this study was to test a collection of dried
milk and related products available in Egypt for the presence of Cronobacter. While PIF has been identified as one
vehicle of transmission for infection in infants, less is
known regarding other dried dairy products. More recent

reports have also identified Cronobacter infections in
immunocompromised adults, further highlighting the
need to identify these organisms' primary origin for contamination. The food products tested included milk powders, PIF, dried whey, dried ice-cream, Sahlab and cheese
and all were obtained from the Nile-Delta region of Egypt.
In total, a collection of sixteen Cronobacter isolates were
recovered from the foods tests and these were characterized using both pheno- and genotyping methods. The
results of the biochemical assays identified the presence of
5 phenotype profiles amongst the collection of isolates
(Table 3).
PFGE and rep-PCR analysis was performed for molecular
characterization of the isolates. PFGE typing identified 8
pulse-type cluster groups exhibiting ≥ 95% similarity.
Analysis using rep-PCR typing identified 3 cluster groups
that showed ≥ 95% similarity. Interestingly, rep-PCR clustered all the C. malonaticus isolates into a single cluster,
denoted as rep-PCR type A, while the C. sakazakii isolates
formed two distinct clusters, rep-PCR types B and C. Isolates CFS-FSMP 1507 and 1509 produced unique phenotype profiles when compared with the other strains in the
collection. PFGE analysis also grouped the latter two isolates into distinct clusters, pulse-types 6 and 5 respectively. Further work is needed to determine whether or not
these strains represent unique subtypes of C. sakazakii.
Sequencing of the recN gene was applied to further characterize the isolates and confirm the species identification.
This method was chosen as it has shown a higher discriminatory power with regard to the speciation of Cronobacter
isolates when compared to 16S rRNA sequencing (Kuhnert P., Korczak B.M., Stephan R., Joosten H., Iversen C:
Phylogeny and whole genome DNA-DNA similarity of
Enterobacter and related taxa by multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA)). The method identified two Cronobacter species recovered in this study, C. sakazakii and C.
malonaticus. Figure 1 outlines the genetic relationship
between the Cronobacter species type strains, the isolates

from this study and the genetically closest Enterobacter
species. As expected, the isolates recovered from the foods
studied, clustered with the type strains of C. sakazakii and
C. malonaticus.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, compound sulphonamides, furazolidone, gentamicin, spectinomycin and
streptomycin. These findings are in agreement with the
data obtained by Stock and Wiedemann [25]. In their
study they identified Cronobacter as being more susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics, including ampicillin, when
compared with the Enterobacter species, E. amnigenus, E.
cancerogenus and E. gergoviae. Interestingly, the Cronobacter
isolates screened in their study were naturally susceptible
to neomycin. The isolates CFS-FSMP 1500, 1510 and
1512 were resistant to this antibiotic. Neomycin is an
aminoglycoside antibiotic, the mode of action of which is
to bind to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria. A possible reason behind this observed resistance could be an
alteration to the binding site protein of the 30S subunit.
Such an occurrence has previously led to streptomycin
resistance, another aminoglycoside compound. In the
Stock and Wiedemann study [25] all Cronobacter and
Enterobacter strains tested were susceptible to antifolate
compounds. However, in our study isolate CFS-FSMP
1510 was resistant trimethoprim. Trimethoprim is an
antifolate compound and acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate
reductase enzymes in susceptible bacteria. Resistance in
Gram-negative bacteria has previously been reported and
it is believed that the mechanism of resistance lies within
the expression of plasmid and/or transposon mediated
dihydrofolate reductase genes.

Conclusion
This study identified and characterized Cronobacter isolates recovered from dried milk and related food products.
Although the majority of the strains were susceptible to
the panel of antibiotics tested, resistance patterns

observed in three isolates may indicate increasing risks to
public health associated with the presence of Cronobacter
in foods. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis should be
applied to further monitor and characterize the presence
of Cronobacter in food production environments and prevent its transmission thereby improving food safety and
quality.
