Abstract
Background: Even though the relationship between certain bacterial infections and neoplastic
lesions of the colon is well-recognized, this knowledge has not been sufficiently translated into
routine practice yet.
Case presentation: We describe the case of a 51-year-old man who was admitted to our Surgical
Department due to rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. Preoperative colonoscopy, staging exams
and subsequent surgery demonstrated a stenotic adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, invading
the left urinary tract and the homolateral bladder wall, with regional lymph nodes involvement and
massive bilobar liver metastases (T4N1M1). After Hartmann's rectosigmoidectomy and despite
systemic chemotherapy, a rapid progression occurred and the patient survived for only 5 months
after diagnosis. Five years before detecting this advanced colonic cancer, the patient underwent
aortic valve replacement due to a severe Streptococcus bovis endocarditis. Subsequent to this
infection he never underwent a colonoscopy until overt intestinal symptoms appeared.
Conclusion: As this case illustrates, in the unusual setting of a Streptococcus bovis infection, it is
necessary to timely and carefully rule out occult colon cancer and other malignancies during
hospitalization and, if a tumor is not found, to schedule endoscopic follow-up. Rigorous application
of these recommendations in the case described would have likely led to an earlier diagnosis of
cancer and maybe saved the patient's life.

Background
A well-recognized relationship has been established
between unusual bacterial infections and neoplastic
lesions of the colon. Although several bacteria have been
reported in association with colonic cancer, the strongest
and best documented relationship focuses on Streptococcus bovis [1,2]. Streptococcus bovis is classified as a non-enterococcal Streptococcus in Lancefield's group D and it is

the pathogen agent of several types of infection including
bacteremia, septicemia and endocarditis, but also unusual
presentations such as endophthalmitis [3], soft tissue
abscess [4], septic arthritis [5] and others. All types of
Streptococcus bovis infection have been related to the presence of a gastrointestinal neoplasia, which in most cases is
colonic adenoma or carcinoma.

Although there is agreement in the literature that this relationship has important clinical implications, their relevance hasn't yet been widely received. It has been
suggested that the presence of Streptococcus bovis infection
mandates complete gastrointestinal screening and, if negative, endoscopic follow-up [6]. Nevertheless, we report
the case of a patient who was diagnosed with a very
advanced colonic cancer five years after a severe Streptococcus bovis endocarditis. By reviewing the literature we discuss the failure in this patient's case to diagnose cancer
earlier, underlining the need for more awareness about
Streptococcus bovis infection and the risk of occult colonic
tumor.

non coronary and coronary right cusps, associated with
moderate regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, since high intermittent fever reappeared, antibiotic treatment was empirically switched to
vancomycin. Since this case of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis was considered to be at high risk of embolism, the
patient was transferred to the Cardiosurgery department
and on 32nd hospitalization day he underwent the
replacement of the aortic valve with mechanical prosthesis. The postoperative course was uneventful; vancomycin
treatment was switched to teicoplanin on the basis of antimicrobial susceptibility and finally the patient was discharged. The one month follow-up after cardiosurgery
showed the patient to be in good clinical conditions.

Case Presentation
On January 2001, a 46 year-old male patient was admitted
to hospital with intermittent low-grade fevers of unknown
origin and severe asthenia that he had been experiencing
for a month. His family history showed only one case of
neoplastic disease among parents, 2 brothers and 5 sisters
(his father died at 73 years due to stomach cancer). The
patient was a hard smoker and his personal pathologic
anamnesis didn't show any relevant disease other than
traumatic bone fractures. The physical examination
revealed good conditions except for the presence of fever
and weakness. Lungs were clear but cardiac beats auscultation demonstrated a grade 2/6 systolic murmur. Laboratory examinations showed a normal complete blood
count (white blood cells count: 8.8 × 109/l with 74% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dl),
although a mild decreasing of medium red cells volume
due to low blood iron (39 μg/dl) was found. Glucose
level, hepatic and kidney function were also normal,
while inflammatory tests resulted increased: C-Reactive
Protein 8.1 mg/dl (normal 0.0–0.8 mg/dl), alpha-1-globulin 273 mg/dl (normal 33–88 mg/dl), erytrosedimentation rate test 43 mm/h (normal 0–10 mm/h). Tumor
markers including CEA and Ca 19-9 were also evaluated
and resulted not increased and fecal occult blood test was
negative. X-ray examination of the chest was normal and
ECG showed regular sinus rhythm and biphasic T waves.
On the 2nd hospitalization day an echocardiography was
performed, demonstrating a small aortic valve vegetation
associated with moderate regurgitation. These findings
led to the diagnosis of infectious endocarditis and the
patient was transferred to the Infectious Disease department of our hospital. A broad spectrum antibiotic therapy
with ampicillin and gentamicin was empirically started
and it continued since, after a few days, blood cultures
demonstrated the growth of Streptococcus bovis sensitive to
that antibiotic therapy. On the 21st hospitalization day
and after 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment the echocardiography still demonstrated two moving vegetations (the
largest one measuring 23 mm in maximum diameter with
surface area of 0.8 cm2) of the aortic valve adhering to the

No further complications occurred for more than five
years after the successfully treated Streptococcus bovis endocarditis and the patient underwent no clinical check-ups
or diagnostic evaluations.
On November 2006, the same patient went to his family
doctor complaining of 15% weight loss in the last three
months, along with asthenia and constipation. Blood
exams revealed hypocromic microcitic anemia (haemoglobin 8.8 g/dl), high levels of carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA: 2221 ng/ml) and fecal occult blood test was positive. Abdominal pain and rectal bleeding occurred a few
days after those exams and the patient was admitted to
our Surgery department. A colonoscopy was performed
revealing sigmoid colon stenosis: the exploration of the
remaining tracts of the colon was not possible due to the
severe obstruction. Histological examination of the biopsies demonstrated a sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. In
addition to the bowel mechanical obstruction, both
abdominal ultrasound and CT scan revealed the presence
of several focal liver lesions with widespread bilobar diffusion (figure 1). Laparotomic surgery was then performed: the intraoperative findings confirmed advanced
sigmoid colon tumor with pelvic diffusion, direct invasion of the left bladder wall and of the left urinary tract
and multiple bilobar liver metastases. A palliative Hartmann's resection of the upper rectum and sigma with left
colostomy and a biopsy of hepatic lesions were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful.
The definitive histological examination of the resected sigmoid colon confirmed the presence of a moderately differentiated (G2) adenocarcinoma of the large bowel
infiltrating the whole thickness of the wall and perivisceral tissues, with a secondary nodule on the serous surface; it had an infiltrative growth pattern with lymphatic
invasion and with a poor peritumoral lymphocytic reaction. One out of 23 regional lymph nodes was involved by
the tumor, and hepatic biopsy confirmed the clinical evi-

the presence of a colonic cancer [1]. Although many
authors have reported a relationship between this kind of
tumor and many bacterial strains, the strongest and best
documented association remains the one between colonic
cancer and Streptococcus bovis infection.

dence of widespread liver metastatic diffusion. The final
pathological stage was a modified Dukes D (T4N1M1).
Despite an aggressive polichemotherapy regimen started
on December 2006, the tumor showed a dramatically
rapid progression. On April 2007, the patient underwent
surgery again, due to intestinal occlusion; a preoperative
CT scan demonstrated massive pelvic recurrence and right
lung neoplastic lymphangitis. The laparotomic surgery
confirmed the pelvic mass with diffuse peritoneal carcinosis, so a palliative enteric anastomosis by-passing the
main site of occlusion was performed. The immediate
postoperative course was characterized by persistent
shock and multiorgan failure not responsive to intensive
care unit support and twelve hours after surgery the
patient died. Patient survival after colonic cancer diagnosis was 5 months only.

Discussion
The occurring of a bacterial endocarditis together with
colonic carcinoma was first reported in 1951 [7], however
it was only in 1977 that Streptococcus bovis was recognized
by Klein et al. as the pathogen agent specifically related to

Many other case reports and two prospective studies in the
literature confirmed the hypothesis that the development
of Streptococcus bovis infection could represent the first sign
of a colonic cancer. The first series was reported in 1979
by Klein et al. [8]: by a complete gastrointestinal evaluation of 15 patients with Streptococcus bovis septicemia, 13
cases (86,6%) of tumors were found. In particular, 11
patients had colonic diseases including 2 adenocarcinomas, 6 microcarcinomas (detected in 5 villous adenomas
and 1 adenomatous polyp) and 3 benign adenomatous
polyps; 2 other patients were affected by esophageal carcinoma. From this study an important lesson was learned
for the first time: in most cases of Streptococcus bovis infection a concomitant colorectal cancer can be expected and
this evidence mandates endoscopic examination. Moreover, the presence of an upper gastrointestinal tract malignancy must also be considered. The second prospective
study in the literature reported by Wilson et al. in 1981 [9]
confirmed the high (62%) prevalence of colonic disease
in 21 patients affected by Streptococcus bovis endocarditis,
even if in this series most patients had benign pathologies
(inflammatory bowel disease, diverticula, polyps or villous adenoma) and only 5% were affected by colonic
cancer.
The pathogenesis of the association between Streptococcus
bovis infection and colonic disease has been investigated
by several studies, however it is still not clear. Sreptococcus
bovis is a normal inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal
tract, as demonstrated by the fact that it can be found in
the fecal specimens of about 5–16% of healthy population. An increased percentage of up to 56% has been
reported in the case of inflammatory bowel disease or
colonic cancer [1], but this finding has not been confirmed in more recent studies [10]. The hypothesis that
ulceration of the neoplastic lesion would directly open a
pathway for the bacteria to enter the bloodstream does
not explain the case of association between Streptococcus
bovis and non ulcerated colonic polyps or adenoma. It
seems more likely that a bacterial translocation without
the need for mucosal disruption may occur due to vascular changes related to several gastrointestinal diseases
[11]. A further association between Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and liver disease has been reported, thus suggesting that an altered hepatic function (secretion of bile salts,
production of immunoglobuline) may play a role in the
alteration of colonic flora and/or bacterial translocation
[12,13]. A recent study suggests the intriguing hypothesis
that the majority of patients affected by colonic cancer

develop a silent infection, although it only becomes
apparent when immune system disorders or cardiac valve
lesions occur. Identification of tumor-associated Streptococcus bovis silent infectionthrough profiling the humoral
immune response represents a promising potential means
for prevention and early diagnosis of colonic cancer [14].
Finally, a direct carcinogenetic role of Streptococcus bovis is
possible because of its demonstrated capability in a rat
model to promote the pre-neoplastic colonic lesions progression [11].
Although the knowledge about the true pathophysiologic
relationship between Streptococcus bovis infection and gastrointestinal neoplasia needs further studies, it is already
well-recognized that a strong association does exist and
has important clinical implications. Since early reports
[1,2,15] until now it has been demonstrated that endoscopic screening is able to detect occult benign, pre-malignant and cancerous diseases of the colon in most patients
with Streptococcus bovis infection [12,16]. As recently
reported by Gold et al. this finding ranges from 6% to
71% in the reviewed literature [17]. Furthermore, the
same authors also underline the previously underestimated association between Streptococcus bovis infection
and extracolonic and even extraintestinal malignancies.
On the basis of these data, in the last decades, several
authors have advocated the need for an appropriate endoscopic screening for polyps and malignancies even in
asympthomatic patients when a Streptococcus bovis infection is recognized [1-6,15-18]. Notably, the Streptococcus
bovis group of bacteria has been recently reclassified based
on DNA-DNA hybridisations and phylogenetic analyses
of 16S RNA gene sequences [19]; on this basis biotypes I
and II.2 were renamed Streptococcus gallolyticus (subsp. gallolyticus and subsp. pasteurianus, respectively). Since these
changes in nomenclature may represent a pitfall in recognizing an underlying occult colon tumor [20], we recommend doctors to be alerted that a diagnosis of Streptococcus
gallolyticus infection has the same clinical implications of
Streptococcus bovis [21]. Furthermore, Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is the new name of Streptococcus bovis
biotype I, which has been more commonly associated
with occult cancer [22], so that the need for endoscopic
screening is even stronger in this case.
Even though it is already well-recognized that the clinical
setting of a Streptococcus bovis (or gallolyticus) infection
mandates a diagnostic work-up to reveal an occult neoplasia, it seems that awareness among physicians who take
care of these patients is still poor, not only due to the pitfall of nomenclature. Gold et al. have warned about the
underutilization of colonoscopy in their patient population with Streptococcus bovis bacteremia [17] and Wentling

http://www.wjso.com/content/6/1/49

et al. have recently suggested that diagnostic assessment
should be scheduled before hospital discharge [6].
Our experience sheds light on the importance of performing a complete diagnostic assessment to rule out an occult
colon or even extracolon cancer during inpatient treatment, avoiding focusing only on infectious disease treatment.
Notably, data collected from the published series demonstrate that performing screening colonoscopy after Streptococcus bovis infection allows the detection of colonic
neoplasia in early or pre-cancerous stages in most cases
[8,16,17]. This finding has been recently supported by a
study on bacterium antigen profiles, showing that infection occurs early during carcinogenesis [14]. Moreover, it
has been suggested that a negative diagnostic assessment
at the time of infection is not enough, because a colonic
polyp or cancer may develop several years after Streptococcus bovis infection [18,23]. While waiting for new technologies for colonic cancer screening, colonoscopy still
remains the most effective tool to follow-up such patients
at risk of colon cancer. The frequency of endoscopic examination in such patients has not been established yet,
however in our opinion, the demonstrated high risk of
developing a colon neoplasia would justify an annual
colonoscopic screening.
The presence in our patient of a sigmoid adenoma or cancer at the time of Streptococcus bovis endocarditis is uncertain because the lesion had not been investigated.
However, even if the overall impact of endoscopic examination and follow-up on survival in patients who have
been affected by Streptococcus bovis infection is unknown,
in the case here reported we are legitimate to suppose that
an annual surveillance would have led to an earlier diagnosis and potentially curative treatment, thus saving the
patient's life.

Conclusion
In the unusual setting of a Streptococcus bovis infection, this
case stresses the need to timely and carefully rule out
occult colon cancer and other malignancies during hospitalization and, if a tumor is not found, to schedule an
annual endoscopic follow-up.
