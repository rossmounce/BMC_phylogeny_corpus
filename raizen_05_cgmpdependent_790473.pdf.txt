Virtually all animals have periods of inactivity or behavioral quiescence, when locomotion stops. In Drosophila,
behavioral quiescence corresponds to sleep and is controlled by some of the same genes and neurochemicals that
affect mammalian sleep, suggesting that the genetic control of quiescence is phylogenetically ancient. We provide,
for the first time, a quantitative description of behavioral
quiescence in C. elegans, a nematode. As noted by others
(Singh and Sulston '78), periods of quiescence occur during the transitions between the four larval stages, but not
during the adult stage. We provide descriptive statistics for
the normal onset, duration, and consolidation of these
quiescent periods, as a baseline for studying mutants. We
find that the quiescence is fully reversible upon mechanical stimulation, indicating that this behavioral state is
under nervous system regulation. To begin to unravel the
genetic machinery that controls quiescence, we have been
studying eat-7 (ad450sd), a C. elegans dominant mutant
that displays increased behavioral quiescence during
lethargus as well as an increase in quiescence during the
adult period. When stimulated mechanically or when
starved, eat-7 mutants move normally, suggesting that the
defect in eat-7 is not in the muscles or motor neurons. eat7 has the same genetic map position but opposite phenotypes to those of mutants with loss of function of the EGL4 cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). We found that
eat-7 mutants contain a glycine to arginine mutation in
PKG. This glycine, found in the cGMP-binding domain
closer to the kinase domain, it conserved in all cyclic
nucleotide-binding proteins, suggesting that this mutation would have major consequences for enzyme function.
