Background
AIDS-Related Lymphoma (ARL) is a disease mediated in
part by HIV-infected macrophages and persists despite
current HIV therapy protocols. The primary difference
between lymphoma seen in non HIV-infected individuals
and ARL is that ARL is uniformly high grade and widely
metastatic. This fact, coupled with finding almost 50 percent of tumors have HIV expressing macrophages, has created interest in studying a potential viral component to
lymphoma evolution. The expansion of HIV quasispecies
in vivo, which can be evaluated using a variety of computational algorithms, allows precise assignment of viral
evolutionary relationships when applied to sequences
obtained from multiple sites of infection. In this study, we
used an advanced HIV phylodynamic approach to track
the evolution of ARL metastasis in a multisite autopsy
study and identified a significant relationship between
HIV dynamics and lymphoma progression.

Methods
Multi-site frozen autopsy specimens were obtained
through the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR)
from patients who died with ARL. A variety of lymphoid
and non-lymphoid tissues were classified as abnormal or
normal by histology examination and stained with antibodies to CD68, MAC 387 and HIV p24. Quantitative HIV
genetic studies qualified diseased and non diseased tissues
to having > 1 copy of HIV/2000 genomic equivalents for
further genetic analyses. We extracted 406 HIV-1

genomes, spanning the 3' env-LTR segment of HIV that
were sequenced from multiple sites from two multi-site
autopsies. Viral dynamic analyses included phylogeny,
migration assessment, population growth and selection
studies using advanced bioinformatics methodologies.

Results
Detailed phylogenetic analysis clearly showed distinct
subpopulations of tumor and non-tumor viruses with
lymph node viruses moving between both groups. Gene
flow analysis showed that viruses from normal tissues
rarely migrated to lymphoma tissues (p < 0.0001). This
evidence strongly indicates a relationship between specific
HIV genetic variants and the development of tumors.
Additionally, a 10-fold faster evolution of viruses was
found within lymphoma tissues as compared to normal
tissues (median effective viral population in lymphoma
tissue = 60,000 compared to 6,000 in normal tissue) and
up to a four-fold increase in purifying selection in lymphoma viruses indicated that the lymphoma virus was
both fast replicating and genetically stable (non-tumor
dN/dS = 1.23 compared to tumor dN/dS = 0.26).

Conclusion
The results strongly support the existence of a fast replicating lymphoma-related virus, distinct from other circulating viruses in two patients who died with metastatic ARL.
The positive selection of viral sequences in one of the
cases suggests a non-random association of a lymphoma

specific viral element within viruses associated with tumor
metastasis. Earlier studies that localized HIV to tumor
associated macrophages suggests that this viral evolution
is relatively specific for a macrophage pool of viruses and
hence might be relatively resistant to current HAART therapies dedicated at blocking primary infection rather than
eradicating macrophage associated infection. These data
suggest the addition of drugs that target infected macrophages may influence the evolution of ARL. Sequences
that cluster with ARL versus non tumor sites within these
two individuals are currently being evaluated to test
whether a true lymphoma virus might evolve in the context of ARL lymphomagenesis.
