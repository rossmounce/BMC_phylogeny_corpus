Abstract
Background: Inter-specific hybridization occurs frequently in plants, which may induce genetic and epigenetic instabilities in
the resultant hybrids, allopolyploids and introgressants. It remains unclear however whether pollination by alien pollens of an
incompatible species may impose a "biological stress" even in the absence of genome-merger or genetic introgression, whereby
genetic and/or epigenetic instability of the maternal recipient genome might be provoked.
Results: We report here the identification of a rice mutator-phenotype from a set of rice plants derived from a crossing
experiment involving two remote and apparently incompatible species, Oryza sativa L. and Oenothera biennis L. The mutatorphenotype (named Tong211-LP) showed distinct alteration in several traits, with the most striking being substantially enlarged
panicles. Expectably, gel-blotting by total genomic DNA of the pollen-donor showed no evidence for introgression.
Characterization of Tong211-LP (S0) and its selfed progenies (S1) ruled out contamination (via seed or pollen) or polyploidy as
a cause for its dramatic phenotypic changes, but revealed transgenerational mobilization of several previously characterized
transposable elements (TEs), including a MITE (mPing), and three LTR retrotransposons (Osr7, Osr23 and Tos17). AFLP and
MSAP fingerprinting revealed extensive, transgenerational alterations in cytosine methylation and to a less extent also genetic
variation in Tong211-LP and its immediate progenies. mPing mobility was found to correlate with cytosine methylation alteration
detected by MSAP but not with genetic variation detected by AFLP. Assay by q-RT-PCR of the steady-state transcript abundance
of a set of genes encoding for the various putative DNA methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases, and small
interference RNA (siRNA) pathway-related proteins showed that, relative to the rice parental line, heritable perturbation in
expression of 12 out of the 13 genes occurred in the mutator-phenotype and its sefled progenies.
Conclusion: Transgenerational epigenetic instability in the form of altered cytosine methylation and its associated TE activity
occurred in a rice mutator-phenotype produced by pollinating the rice stigma with pollens of O. biennis. Heritably perturbed
homeostatic expression-state of genes involved in maintenance of chromatin structure is likely an underlying cause for the alien
pollination-induced transgenerational epigenetic/genetic instability, and which occurred apparently without entailing genome
merger or genetic introgression.

Background
It is widely accepted that hybridization between genetically differentiated natural plant populations is a frequent
phenomenon, which contributes to genome evolution,
and can lead to speciation via allopolyploidy or at the
homoploid level [1-6]. Apart from the properties of
hybridization that can be explained by classical genetic
mechanisms such as direct transfer and/or recombinatory
generation of beneficial alleles, recent studies in both
plant and animals have revealed that wide hybridization
may generate variations by novel means such as rapid
structural genomic changes, novel gene expression trajectories and epigenetic alterations, which apparently transgress Mendelian principles [1,7-17] One possible
mechanism for the occurrence of non-Mendelian
genomic and transcriptomic changes as a result of hybridization is lato sensu the "genomic shock" hypothesis proposed by McClintock [18].
Several lines of circumstantial evidence have suggested
that hybridization-associated genetic and epigenetic instabilities may also be provoked in unsuccessful or "abortive" hybridizations between distant and sexually
incompatible species. For example, it was found that random integration of uncharacterized DNA segments from
unrelated sources into cultured animal cells, and introgression of multiple, tiny chromatin segments from a distantly related donor species into a recipient plant species
may be mutagenic and induce genetic and epigenetic variations [19-23]. Although in these instances, the introgression of alien DNA or chromatin segments were
automatically assumed as the causal factor for the induced
instabilities, no direct link between the two events was
ever established. In fact, a common observation emerged
from these studies has indicated that the genomic loci
underwent the changes are largely random both with
regard to their chromosomal distribution and to nature of
the changed sequences, thus argues against localized
effects (e.g., insertional mutagenesis). Therefore, it
remained a formal possibility that at least some of the
detected non-Mendelian genetic and epigenetic mutations in these cases may not have been induced by the
integration of DNA or chromatin segments per se; instead,
they might have been the consequence of the process of
genetic transfer (in animals) or alien pollination (in
plants), which conceivably may constitute a kind of "biological stress" and elicit genetic and epigenetic instabilities, a scenario consistent with McClintock's "genomic
shock" hypothesis [18].
In theory, it is possible that the process of pollination by
pollens even from a remote and incompatible species may
constitute a "biological stress" to the recipient parent in
myriad ways. For example, metabolites including small
signal molecules (e.g., nitric oxide and reactive oxygen

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/63

species [24]) and various phytohormones of the alien pollens may enter stigma cells of the recipient species during
their physical contacts; conceivably, this may induce
physiological and biochemical mismatches of various
kinds. Consequently, if the cellular machinery responsible for the constant fine-tuning of chromatin structure is
compromised, then the occurrence of epigenetic and even
genetic instability is almost inevitable. In this regard, the
pollination by alien pollens from an incompatible species
may bear mechanistic resemblance to pathogen attack
wherein the pathogen's DNA or RNA usually does not
integrate into the host genome, yet its interaction with the
host may cause genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the
latter. Indeed, it was documented recently in tobacco that
pathogen infestation caused both general genetic instability (due to increased somatic recombination) and alteration in cytosine methylation at specific loci in the infected
plants, and both of which are heritable to successive biological generations [25,26].
The aim of this study was to explore if pollination by alien
pollens from an extremely remote and apparently incompatible plant species, which obviously would not generate
genome merger or genetic introgressions, may still impose
a "biological stress" to the recipient maternal genome,
and induce heritable genetic and epigenetic instabilities.

Results and discussion
Identification of a mutator-phenotype
We harvested more than 300 seeds from ca. 50 rice (Oryza
sativa L. ssp. japonica, cv. Tong211) panicles that were artificially pollinated by fresh pollens taken from a single
accession of a dicot plant, evening primrose (Oenothera
biennis L.), followed by a second round pollination 48 hrs
later with their own pollens collected from other individuals of Tong211 – a pollination method we termed
"repeated pollination" [27]. We found that a substantial
portion of the seeds showed abnormal development as a
result of the manipulation, and which either did not germinate or died at early seedling stages. Among 84 rice
plants (designated as S0 generation) growing to maturity,
we identified a single individual plant (hereforth named
Tong211-LP) that showed conspicuous phenotypic variation in multiple traits, including flowering time, seed-size,
and particularly panicle-size (larger panicle, LP), relative
to its rice parental cultivar. We then self-pollinated several
panicles of this plant to produce seeds (also markedly
enlarged), and the S1 progeny plants. Tong211-LP was
partially sterile and produced a much smaller quantity of
seeds than expected from a normal rice individual. Nonetheless, among the progenies produced, phenotypic variations that were observed in the individual mutatorphenotype (S0) were inherited at high frequencies to the
S1 progenies; in addition, some new phenotypic variations that were apparently individual-specific appeared de

novo in some of the S1 progeny plants. Typical phenotypic
variations in the S1 progeny plants of the mutator-phenotype were shown in Figure 1. The transgenerational continuous occurrence of multiple phenotypic variations, i.e.,
sustained phenotypic instability, from a single individual
is characteristic of a "mutator-phenotype", as originally
reported in Drosophila [28].
Transpositional activation of multiple TEs in the mutatorphenotype and its selfed progenies
Genomic DNA was isolated from expanded young leaves
of Tong211-LP (vegetatively propagated from root-stock
cuttings), its eight selected S1 progeny individuals that
exhibited the most extreme phenotypic variations, the
parental rice line (cv. Tong211) and the pollen-donor, O.
biennis. A series of DNA gel blot analysis was performed.
First, to look for possible genetic introgression from the
pollen donor O. bienni into rice, we did a genomic DNA
probing assay [29], i.e., using labeled genomic DNA of O.
biennis as a probe and autoclaved genomic DNA (150×
excess in quantity) of rice as a blocker. We detected no evidence for genomic introgression (data not shown) based
on this assay, as expected given the extreme phylogenetic
remoteness of the two species. It should be pointed out
however that this genomic blotting assay, though efficient
[29], is by no means exclusive as only introgression of O.
biennis species-specific genomic sequences would have
been detected, and therefore cryptic introgression incidents may go undetected. Next, given the transgenerational mutability of multiple phenotypic traits, we asked

the question if some normally quiescent transposable elements (TEs) might have been activated in the mutatorphenotype, as in the case of Drosophila [30,31], and in
bona fide wide hybrids of plants [32]. We thus checked stability of several previously characterized low-copy TEs
endogenous to the rice genome, which were either documented to be active under certain stress conditions [3336], or were suspected so based on bioinformatic predictions [37]. The studied TEs included a 430 bp MITE,
mPing[34], its two transposase donors, Ping and Pong
[34,38], nine low-copy LTR retrotransposons, Osr2, Osr3,
Osr7, Osr23, Osr35, Osr36, Osr42, Tos19 and Tos17
[33,37]. We found that four (mPing, Osr7, Tos17 and
Osr23) of the 12 studied TEs showed apparent transpositional activation in Tong211-LP, or more often, in its S1
progenies (Figures 2, 3 and 4). A notable feature of the gel
blotting patterns of these four TEs was that some of the S1
progenies exhibited individual-specific patterns, i.e., the
pattern of a given individual was not shared by other sibindividuals, thus suggesting stochastic, transgenerational
inheritance of the destabilized state in these elements,
which mirrors the observation of phenotypic novelty in
these plants Among the eight studied S1 individuals, #5
showed the most transpositions for all four elements (Figures 2, 3 and 4). It remained to be determined if this
"transpositional active state" would be continually inherited to future generations, or it would be converted to a
stabilized, repressive state after a few generations.
Two (mPing and Tos17) of these four elements were
shown previously as active under various stressful conditions, including tissue culture [34,35] and irradiation
[36], but the other two (Osr7 and Osr23) were only implicated as potentially active based on bioinformatic predictions but not empirically documented [37]. Thus, this is
the first demonstration of transpositional activity of these
two LTR retrotransposons in rice under this specific condition (Figures 4a and 4c).
Next, we studied the transposition of mPing in Tong211LP and its S1 progenies in more detail, as this element is
most active as well as amenable to characterization. First,
the transpositional activity of mPing in these plants was
further verified by transposon-display or TD [39],
whereby > 60 putative mPing excision and de novo insertion events were isolated and sequenced. The sequence
data indicated that at least 52 of the isolated events represent bona fide mPing activities (i.e., excisions or de novo
insertions; see Additional files 1 and 2), as they each contained at their 5' terminus the expected portion of the
mPing sequence encompassing the typical 15 bp terminal
inverted repeats (TIRs) and the 3-bp target site duplication
(TSD) of TAA or TTA, which is characteristic of the transpositional behavior of mPing [34-36]. Based on the
sequence information, together with the complete

the next generation via germline inheritance. Pairwise
sequence comparison showed that none of 16 excisions
had left behind any excision footprint (see Additional file
1), which is in agreement with some [38,40] but not all
(e.g., [26,27]) previous reports on the excision properties
of mPing. A BlastN analysis of these 16 excised mPing loci
against the whole genome sequence of Nipponbare
revealed an unexpected result in that eight of 16 loci were
mapped to chromosome 3 and the rest to chromosomes
1, 2, 4, 11 and 12 (see Additional file 1), suggesting differential activity of the mPing copies with regard to their
chromosomal locations.

genomic sequence of the standard laboratory rice genotype Nipponbare, locus-specific primers were designed for
a set of 30 loci (see Additional files 1 and 2), which
showed identical or high degree of sequence conservation
between the studied rice cultivar (Tong211) and the
genome-sequenced japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare. All
these 30 loci were successfully amplified, cloned,
sequenced and characterized (see Additional files 1 and
2). Sixteen of the 30 loci represent excisions in the S1
progenies of Tong211-LP, that is, compared with the parent Tong211 and the mutator-phenotype Tong211-LP
(S0), they were excised in one or more of the S1 progenies
(see Additional file 1). The predominant occurrence of
mPing excisions in the S1 rather than the S0 generation
(also evident in the gel blotting pattern, Figure 2) suggests
that the timing of the excision events should be during
late vegetative development and/or early gametogenesis
in the Tong211-LP (S0) plant, and being manifested in

Fourteen of the TD-identified loci were mPing de novo
insertions in the S1 progenies of Tong211-LP, i.e., compared with the parent Tong211 and Tong211-LP (S0) they
became larger-sized due to insertion of intact mPing copies in some of the S1 progenies (see Additional file 2). A
BlastN analysis of these insertion-targeted sequences
against the whole genome sequence of Nipponbare
showed that all insertions mapped to unique- or low-copy
regions (see Additional file 2), consistent with insertional
propensity of mPing [41]. In contrast to the situation of
excisions, these 14 mPing insertions did not show an obvious bias towards a particular chromosome (see Additional file 2).
Genome-wide genetic and epigenetic instability in the
mutator-phenotype
To test whether the genetic variations in Tong211-LP and
its progenies were confined to the activation of a few specific TEs, or a more general genomic instabilities have
been elicited, we performed genome-wide analysis on the
same set of plants used in the gel-blotting by using AFLP
and MSAP markers, and assessed > 1,000 loci for each
marker. In the AFLP analysis, both loss of the rice parental
bands and gain of novel bands were detected in Tong211LP and its S1 progenies relative to their rice parent
Tong211, with variation frequencies of both types of
genomic changes together ranged from 2.66% to 8.16%
(Figure 5). In MSAP analysis, methylation alteration of
both CG and CNG at the CCGG sites (a prominent site for
methylation modification in eukaryotes) were also
detected in Tong211-LP and its S1 progenies relative to
their rice parent Tong211, with frequencies of both types
of DNA methylation alterations together ranged from
21.44% to 27.30% (Figure 5), which are higher by more
than three times than those of genetic changes. These data
indicated that, apart from transpositional activation of a
subset of TEs (Figures 2, 3 and 4), pollination by pollens
of O. biennis had particularly induced genome-wide epigenetic instabilities in the form of altered cytosine methylation patterns in the mutator-phenotype and its S1
progenies, though lower frequencies of genetic changes
also occurred. It is notable that, as in the case for the trans-

position of the four TEs, described above, many loss or
gain of bands in the AFLP or MSAP profiles were singletons (a specific change occurred in only one individual),
thus probably could not be attributed to genetic segregation from existing variations in the S0 generation alone.
Instead, stochastic transgenerational inheritance of the
induced metastable epigenetic chromatin state might be a
major underlying cause for the new variations in the S1
progeny, which is apparently consistent with the de novo
appearance of phenotypic variations in the S1 plants (e.g.,
Figure 1).
To gain some insights into the chromosomal distribution
and possible functional relevance of the genomic loci that
showed genetic and epigenetic instabilities in Tong211-LP
and its progenies, a set of variable AFLP and MSAP bands
were isolated, cloned and sequenced (see Additional file
3). It was found that all variable bands were chromosomal
DNA sequences of the rice genome (thus again pointing to
the lack of genetic introgression from the pollen donor O.
biennis), and they mapped to all 12 rice chromosomes,
with the numbers ranged from two to six for each chromosome. A notable observation from the inferred possible functionalities of these variable bands is that the
majority of them (23 out of 41) appeared to be genic
sequences, followed by TEs (11), and only seven showed
no homology (see Additional file 3). This may explain the
dramatic phenotypic variations in the mutator-phenotype
and its selfed S1 progenies (e.g., Figure 1).

Correlations between two of the three kinds of
instabilities, genetic variation, epigenetic variation, and TE
activity
Given the concomitant occurrence of genetic variation,
alteration in cytosine methylation and TE activity in the
mutator-phenotype and its selfed progenies, it would be
interesting to know whether these events are intrinsically
correlated with, or independent of, each other. Thus, we
calculated the Pearson's coefficients between each two of
the three kinds of instabilities. We found no meaningful
correlation between the genetic variation detected by
AFLP and the alteration in cytosine methylation detected
by MSAP (Table 1), suggesting the two kinds of variations
were likely caused by independent mechanisms [42].
Likewisely, no correlation was seen between the genetic
variation and mPing activity (including excision and insertion, detected by transposon-display) (Table 2), which is
as expected given the known distinct cellular mechanisms
for maintaining general genetic stability and control of TE
activity. In contrast, statistically meaningful correlations
were found between mPing activity and alteration in cytosine methylation (Table 2). Specifically, mPing excision is
positively correlated with alteration in both CG and CNG
methylation (P < 0.05 or 0.01), and mPing insertion is
positively correlated with alteration in CNG methylation
(P < 0.05) (Table 2). This is consistent with the genomedefense paradigm of cytosine methylation [43,44].
According to this paradigm, the primary role of cytosine
methylation was evolved to serve as a genome defense sys-

repressive control of TE activity [43-47], and the above
documented correlation between alteration in cytosine
methylation and TE (mPing) activity in the rice mutatorphenotype, it is reasonable to assume that the TE activity
and epigenetic instability are probably related to perturbation of the homeostatic expression state of genes encoding
for the enzymatic machinery responsible for maintaining
the cytosine methylation states and/or other aspects of the
chromatin epigenetic structure. We thus measured the
mRNA steady-state abundance for a set of genes encoding
for putative DNA methyltransferases, 5-methylcytosine
DNA glycosylases, and the siRNA pathway-related proteins by real-time reverse transcriptase- PCR (q-RT-PCR)
analysis with gene-specific primers. We found that of the
13 selected genes analyzed, 11 (the two exceptions are
DDM1 and AGO4-2) showed significantly perturbed
expressions in the mutator-phenotype (Tong211-LP) relative to its rice parental line (Tong211) (Figure 6). Furthermore, the perturbed expression states of these genes were
transgenerationally heritable in the sense that none of the

most rampant retrotranspositions, as is also the case for
mPing (Figure 2); in addition, loss of bands was evident for

adjacent to each of the element copies.

and therefore stress-induced alteration in scope and/or
extent of this epigenetic marker may provoke activation of
otherwise quiescent TEs [43].

genes had reverted to the original expression states of their
parental rice line (wild type) in all or most of the eight S1
plants analyzed (Figure 6). In fact, the extent of perturbation in the expression states of most of the genes was further augmented in some of the S1 progenies, and in one
extreme case (i.e., the DDM1 gene), whose expression did
not exhibit significant deviation from the parental line in
Tong211-LP, nonetheless showed significant difference in
six (except for S1-1 and -3) of the eight S1 individuals
(Figure 6). This result of transgenerational perturbation in
the expression states of the chromatin structure-maintenance genes is consistent with the heritable epigenetic
instability in these plants, described above.
Recent studies have established that the intrinsic DNA
methylation patterns in both plants and animals are faithfully maintained and perpetuated by coordinated function of at least two classes of DNA methyltransferases
(maintenance and de novo), together with active demethylases, i.e., the 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases [48,49].
On the other hand, small interference RNA (siRNA) was
documented as playing pivotal roles in repressing activity
of TEs in diverse organisms by specific targeting [44-47].
Furthermore, at least in plants de novo methylation is often
related to the activity of certain species of siRNAs by a
mechanism known as RNA-directed DNA methylation or
RdDM [50]. It is therefore conceivable that the coordinated expression of these genes represent a default
requirement for stable maintenance and perpetuation of
intrinsic DNA methylation patterns and silent TE states.
Thus, the transgenerational perturbation of these genes in
the mutator-phenotype and its progenies (Figure 6) may
conceivably disrupt the homeostatic expression state of
these genes as a network in the rice cells. It is likely that at
least one facet of the possible effect of alien pollination as
a "biological stress" may lie in its perturbation of coordinated expression of these chromatin state maintenance
and regulation genes in the maternal recipient somatic
and germinal cells, and hence, result in transgenerational
epigenetic instability and TE activation.
The mutator-phenotype was not caused by parental
heterozygosity or contamination, but resultant from the
alien pollination-imposed stress
There are three alternative possible causes that may be
responsible for or contribute to the generation of the

mutator-phenotype: one is segregation of pre-existing
parental heterozygosity, the second is seed or pollen contamination from other rice cultivar(s), and the third is
mutagenic effect from some unknown source. That we
consider pollination by O. biennis as the only major
underlying cause for the genetic and epigenetic instabilities in the mutator-phenotype (Tong211-LP) and its S1
progenies, are based on the following lines of evidence:
First, the rice parental cultivar cv. Tong211 is a genetically
pure line, as rice is a predominantly self-pollinating plant,
and furthermore, the specific strain used for the present
work had been maintained by strict selfing for > 10 successive generations in our hands, thus its inbred nature was
ensured. In fact, the inbred nature of Tong211 has also
been validated in this study by a parallel analysis on 30
random individuals, as in no case a variable pattern suggestive of heterozygosity was observed in either the gelblotting patterns of the four active TEs or in PCR-based
locus-specific mPing amplifications of all 30 loci (see
Additional files 1 and 2; data not shown). Therefore,
parental heterozygosity can be confidently ruled out as a
causal factor for the markedly changing patterns of either
the studied TEs, and by extension, the variable MSAP/
AFLP profiles. Second, based on the following lines of evidence, contamination by pollens or seeds of other rice cultivars was considered as extremely unlikely. (1) Strict
precautions were taken both in the cross manipulations
(emasculation and pollination) and in later propagations
by timely bagging of all panicles to endure 100% selfing.
(2) It is notable that whereas most genetic and epigenetic
changes that occurred in the mutator-phenotype were
largely inheritable to its S1 progenies, many individualspecific new patterns appeared de novo in the S1 individuals (e.g., Figures 2, 3 and 4). Therefore, if contamination
were a cause for the observed variable patterns, then the
S1 plants need to have derived from S0 seeds that were
contaminated independently by pollens of different rice
cultivars, which obviously is extremely unlikely. (3) In the
course of identifying the mPing-containing loci in cultivar
Tong211, we uncovered 21 additional loci each contains
a mPing copy in the standard cultivar Nipponbare but
devoid the element in Tong211 (see Methods). We then
amplified these 21 mPing-empty loci from the mutatorphenotype and its eight S1 progeny individuals, and we
found that in all cases, only smaller-sized PCR products
consistent with lacking of mPing in these plants were

amplified (data not shown). Given the extremely high
degree of presence vs. absence polymorphism of mPing
among japonica rice cultivars [[34,51]; our unpublished
data], this result strongly suggests that the mutator-phenotype and its analyzed progenies were unequivocally
originated from one cultivar (Tong211) only. Taken
together, the possibility of pollen or seed contamination
can be confidently ruled out. Finally, all plant lines used
in this study were grown together under identical normal
conditions, under which biotic (e.g., pathogen infesta-

tion) and abiotic stresses were not exerted. Therefore, it is
also inconceivable that the mutator-phenotype and its
progenies had been differentially stressed from their
parental line by an unknown stress that elicited the
genomic instabilities.
By ruling out each of the three alternative possibilities, we
are confident to conclude that pollination by O. biennis is
the major, if not the only, conceivable cause for the
genetic and epigenetic variations in the mutator-pheno-

type and its sefled progenies. Nonetheless, the basis for
the occurrence of such extensive genetic and epigenetic
instabilities as a result of "abortive" alien pollination
remains mysterious. The single mutator-phenotype
(Tong211-LP) was identified out of 84 "pollinated"
plants, based on its striking phenotypic variations, thus
giving a mutation frequency of 1.2%. Although it is likely
that genomic variations may also have occurred in some
other treated plants, they did not reach the extent to cause
apparent phenotypic variations. Because all these 84
plants were sequentially pollinated first by O. biennis and
then by pollens from the same rice line (Tong211), it
appeared likely that stochasticity have also played an
important part in the genesis of the mutator-phenotype
individual.
The phenomenon we reported here is reminiscent of what
McClintock envisioned two decades ago that wide hybridization in plants might activate quiescent TEs and cause
genomic restructuring [18]. Indeed, several lines of empirical evidence in both plants and animals have lend support to this prediction [8,13,30-32,40,52-55]. Although
all these previous works involved documented genome
merger and/or introgression, it can be envisioned that
even in the absence of introgression a "shock" at multiple
levels may be incurred if the pollination by alien species
per se represents a kind of "biological stress". In principle,
even between incompatible crosses, certain metabolites,
particularly those that require only trace quantity to produce dramatic effects like signal molecules, phytohormones and siRNA species etc., may be released from the
donor pollens and enter the recipient stigma cells, thus
may conceivably produce various mismatches and elicit a
stress response.
It can be imagined that the cellular machinery responsible
for safeguarding the genetic and epigenetic stabilities is
likely sensitive as well as responsive to perturbations by
stress, and fine-tuning on a balance between genetic/epigenetic fidelity and instability is required for the sake of
survival and adaptation. Thus, in this study the significantly perturbed expression of nearly all of the 13 studied
genes involved in the cellular machinery responsible for
maintenance of chromatin epigenetic state subsequent to
alien pollination might represent a sensory and adaptive
response by the plant genome. From this perspective, the
findings of this study may have bearing to genome evolution, as similar incidents of alien pollination may occur
frequently under natural conditions, and hence, implicate
a novel role of hybridization in evolution. Thus, we propose the possibility that "accidental cross-pollination" by
a certain unrelated species may be actually mutagenic and
elicited dramatic genetic/epigenetic instabilities, which
may be perceived by selection. Further judiciously
designed experiments involving an array of cross manipu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/9/63

lations between different plant species are needed to
investigate generality of this phenomenon and its underlying mechanism.

Conclusion
To test the possibility that pollination by an unrelated and
incompatible species may constitutes a "biological stress"
whereby the genetic and epigenetic stability of the maternal parent genome might be jeopardized, we performed a
crossing experiment between rice (served as the maternal
partner) and Oenothera biennis L. (served as the pollen
donor). A single rice mutator-phenotype individual
(Tong211-LP) with conspicuous variation in multiple
phenotypic traits was identified from the crossing experiment. Tong211-LP and its sefled progenies exhibited
transgenerational epigenetic instability in the form of
altered cytosine methylation and transpositional activation of several otherwisely quiescent transposable elements (TEs) endogenous to the rice genome. Heritably
perturbed homeostatic expression-state of a set of genes
involved in maintenance of chromatin structure is likely
an underlying cause for the alien pollination-induced
transgenerational epigenetic/genetic instability, and
which occurred apparently without entailing genome
merger or genetic introgression. Our results suggest that
accidental pollination by unrelated alien pollens in plants
might impose a stress condition and induce genetic and
epigenetic instabilities in the maternal genome.

Methods
Plant materials
Plants used in this study included a single rice individual
named "Tong211-LP" that was identified from a set of
plants derived from seeds of a "alien pollination experiment" between rice (Oryza sativa L.), ssp. japonica, cv.
Tong211 and a dicot plant, evening primrose (Oenothera
biennis L.), and followed by self-pollination with pollens
of different individuals of the same rice cultivar, namely,
using a procedure we termed "repeated pollination"
[27,40]. The choice for the particular crossing partners
was based on two major considerations: (1) the two species (O. sativa L. and O. biennis L.) are hardly related, and
hence, served well for the purpose of this study; (2) O.
biennis L. produces a large amount of pollens that are viable for relatively long period after collection (our unpublished observation), and hence, convenient for the
crossing manipulations. The identified individual plant
(Tong211-LP) exhibited conspicuous phenotypic variation in multiple traits particularly enlarged panicles and
seed-size, compared with its maternal parental cultivar
Tong211. Seeds of individual panicles collected from
Tong211-LP were selfed to produce the S1 progenies. In
all cases, mutant plants were grown together with the
parental line under identical, normal conditions, and
strict bagging was practiced.

DNA gel blot analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from expanded young leaves
of individual plants by a modified CTAB method [56] and
purified by phenol extractions. Genomic DNA (~3 μg per
lane) was digested by XbaI (New England Biolabs Inc.),
and run through 1% agarose gels. The choice of XbaI is
because the studied TEs either do not have a restriction
site or the site(s) being on one side of the probe region,
such that copy number of the TEs can be estimated based
on the blotting patterns. Fractionated DNA was transferred onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech) by the alkaline transfer recommended by the supplier. For investigating stability of a set
of 13 low-copy transposable elements (TEs), element-specific primers were designed (see Additional file 4), and the
fragments were obtained by PCR amplifications by using
genomic DNA of the parental line (Tong211) as the template. The fragments representing each of the TEs were
then gel-purified, identities confirmed by sequencing, and
labeled with fluorescein-11-dUTP by the Gene Images
random prime-labeling module (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). Hybridization signal was detected by the Gene
Images CDP-Star detection module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after washing at a stringency of 0.2 × SSC,
0.1% SDS for 2 × 50 min. The filters were exposed to X-ray
film for 1–3 hrs depending on signal intensity.
Transposon-display (TD) and PCR-based locus assay on
mPing excision and insertion
The transposon-display (TD) technique [39], using nested
mPing-specific primers together with a primer designed
according to the restriction enzyme MseI-adapter
sequence was as described [40]. To further verify mPing
excisions and insertions, a subset of identified TD loci
were sequenced, and by taking advantage of the complete
genome sequence of the standard laboratory japonica rice
cultivar Nipponbare http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp, a set of
locus-specific primers (see Additional file 1) each bracketing an intact mPing in the parental rice cultivar Tong211
(for detecting excision) or in the mutant Tong211-LP and
its S1 progeny individual(s) (for detecting insertions), was
designed by the Primer 3 software http://biocore.unl.edu/
cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi. Likewisely, a set of 21
loci each of which does not encompass a mPing copy in
the parental cultivar Tong-211 was also identified in the
course of TD analysis. Primers specific to this set of loci
were also designed, and used to validate single genotypic
origin of the mutant (Tong-211-LP) and its progenies.
PCR amplification with these primer pairs were then conducted on the corresponding plant materials. The amplicons were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after
electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels. All identified
sites for mPing excisions (along with the corresponding
element-containing donor sites) and de novo insertions
were isolated and sequenced, such that the excision pros-

perities (e.g., to leave footprint or not) and characteristics
(e.g., chromosomal location and potential functionality)
of insertion-targeted sequences could be determined or
inferred.
AFLP and MSAP analysis
The protocols suitable for amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplified
fragment (MSAP) in rice were exactly as reported [22,57].
For each marker, > 1,000 loci were scored. Typical bands
representing genetic changes (AFLP) and cytosine methylation alterations (MSAP) in the mutant or its S1 progenies, as compared with their parental cultivar Tong211,
were isolated, cloned and sequenced. Homology analysis
was performed by BlastX at the NCBI website http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi.
Real-time Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis
Isolation of total RNA and cDNA synthesis was essentially
as reported [24]. Specifically, total RNA was isolated from
expanded young leaves at the same developmental stage
as that used for DNA isolation by the Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA
was treated with DNaseI (Invitrogen), reverse-transcribed
by the SuperScriptTM RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen), and subjected to q-RT-PCR analysis using
gene-specific primers. The q-PCR experiments were performed using a Roche LightCycler480 apparatus (Roche
Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction and
SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) as a DNA-specific fluorescent dye. The primers for all 13 studied genes encoding for
putative DNA methyltransferases (seven), 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases (two) and siRNA-related proteins
(four) were designed by the Primer 5 software (see Additional file 5). Expression of a rice β-actin gene (Genbank
accession X79378) was used as internal control with the
primer pairs 5'-ATGCCATTCTCCGTCTT-3' and 5'-GCTCCTGCTCGTAGTC-3'. Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 30 s,
followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C.
Three batches of independently isolated RNAs were used
as technical replications. The melting curve analysis with
the LightCycler480 together with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis of the products were used to ensure that right size
product without significant background was amplified in
the reaction. The relative amounts of the gene transcripts
were determined using the Ct (threshold cycle) method,
as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Data were
analyzed by using the software provided by Roche Company and calculated by the 2-ΔΔCt method. Quantitative
results were given as mean expression (means ± SD).
Statistics
Statistical significance was determined using SPSS 11.5 for
Windows http://www.spss.com/statistics/ and analyzed

by Independent-Samples student's t-Test. Specifically, correlations were tested for the data of variation frequencies
calculated based on the three markers, Transposon
(mPing)-display, MSAP and AFLP, by using the Pearson
correlation analysis. The same program was used to test
for the statistical significance of differences in the relative
expression of the set of 13 genes in the mutator-phenotype (Tong211-LP) and its sefled progenies relative to that
of the rice parental line (Tong211).
