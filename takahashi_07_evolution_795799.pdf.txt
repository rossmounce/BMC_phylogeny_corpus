Abstract
Background: Cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika exhibit remarkable diversity in their feeding habits.
Among them, seven species in the genus Perissodus are known for their unique feeding habit of scale
eating with specialized feeding morphology and behaviour. Although the origin of the scale-eating
habit has long been questioned, its evolutionary process is still unknown. In the present study, we
conducted interspecific phylogenetic analyses for all nine known species in the tribe Perissodini
(seven Perissodus and two Haplotaxodon species) using amplified fragment length polymorphism
(AFLP) analyses of the nuclear DNA. On the basis of the resultant phylogenetic frameworks, the
evolution of their feeding habits was traced using data from analyses of stomach contents, habitat
depths, and observations of oral jaw tooth morphology.
Results: AFLP analyses resolved the phylogenetic relationships of the Perissodini, strongly
supporting monophyly for each species. The character reconstruction of feeding ecology based on
the AFLP tree suggested that scale eating evolved from general carnivorous feeding to highly
specialized scale eating. Furthermore, scale eating is suggested to have evolved in deepwater
habitats in the lake. Oral jaw tooth shape was also estimated to have diverged in step with
specialization for scale eating.
Conclusion: The present evolutionary analyses of feeding ecology and morphology based on the
obtained phylogenetic tree demonstrate for the first time the evolutionary process leading from
generalised to highly specialized scale eating, with diversification in feeding morphology and
behaviour among species.

Background
Cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes exhibit a
remarkable diversity of feeding ecology, morphology and
behaviour [1]. Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of these lakes
with an estimated age of 9–12 Myr [2], contains the the

most morphologically and ecologically complex species
flock of cichlid fishes [3]. Scale-eating cichlids of the tribe
Perissodini is prehaps among the most specialized cichlids [1]. The endemic tribe Perissodini comprises nine
species [4,5]. Liem & Stewart [6] classified them into two

genera, Perissodus, which includes all scale eaters identified so far in the lake, and Haplotaxodon. We follow their
classification here, although Poll [5] further subdivided
the former genus into three genera, Perissodus (P. microlepis
and P. eccentricus), Plecodus (P. multidentatus, P. paradoxus,
P. elaviae, P. straeleni) and Xenochromis (P. hecqui).
The scale eaters are characterised by unique oral jaw teeth
that vary in shape among species, showing functional specialization to scale eating [6]. Among the species, P. microlepis and P. straeleni, which syntopically inhabit shallow
rocky regions of the lake [7], show specialized feeding
techniques, employing a variety of specialized morphologies such as mimicking body colour morphs of prey species [8], or jaw asymmetries with the jaw opening either to
the left or right [9].
Although the origin of such peculiar scale-eating habits
has long been questioned, and the ancestors of scale eaters
have been variously suggested as being algae eaters,
ectoparasite feeders, or piscivorous species [1,10], the
answer remains unclear. This is partly because the other
five Perissodus species are deepwater inhabitants whose
ecology is poorly known [11,12]. Above all, a reliable
phylogenetic framework, which is essential for evolutionary analyses, has yet to be obtained for the Perissodini.
Previous molecular phylogenetic studies of the Tanganyikan cichlids have placed the tribe Perissodini within the
"H-lineage" [13,14]. The phylogenetic relationships
within the Perissodini have also been inferred from morphological aspects [6]. However, the small number of
shared characters between species and the inclusion of
adaptive traits (e.g., oral tooth shape) may hinder the construction of reliable phylogenetic relationships from morphology. A molecular phylogenetic approach using
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) also has potential problems, sometimes resulting in patterns incongruent with
species morphology or nuclear DNA when hybridisation
or incomplete lineage sorting is involved [15,16]. A recent
mtDNA-based phylogenetic study for Perissodini showed
a strong discordance in species relationships from those of
morphological and nuclear phylogenetic trees [17]. Mitochondrial DNA and any single locus would be susceptible
to this problem [18-20]. In recent years, the amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method, in which
large numbers of restriction fragments from whole
genome digests can be examined, has provided powerful
phylogenetic markers to overcome the above problems
and is especially useful for analyses of closely related cichlid species [21-23]. Koblmüller et al. [17] also used this
method for Perissodini, although the phylogenetic relationships within Perissodus still remain to be clarified since
one specialized scale eater, P. eccentricus, was missing
from their AFLP analysis, and a greater number of AFLP

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/195

characters might be necessary to resolve the phylogenetic
relationships of recently diverged species.
This study aims to clarify the evolution of scale eating in
Tanganyikan cichlids, Perissodus species. For that purpose,
we conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses based on
over 1000 multilocus analyses using AFLP data for all
known Perissodini species. In addition, we examined
stomach contents, oral jaw tooth morphology, and habitat depths. Subsequently, we compared these characteristics based on the obtained phylogenetic framework.
Finally, we discuss the evolutionary process of specialization to scale eating and associated feeding morphologies
and feeding behaviours.

Results
AFLP phylogeny
In total, 1582 AFLP fragments including 996 informative
characters were scored for 72 individuals collected in the
field (Figure 1). The neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis produced a tree (Figure 2) in which the monophyly of the
tribe Perissodini, Haplotaxodon, and Perissodus was supported (BP = 100%, 96–99%, and 90–91%, respectively).
The monophyly of each species was also strongly supported in this AFLP tree (BP = 89–100%). Among the Perissodus species, P. hecqui was placed as the most basal,
followed by P. multidentatus (BP = 61–63%). The remaining five Perissodus species constituted a monophyletic
group (BP = 98%) in which P. straeleni and P. microlepis
were clustered together (BP = 100%), with P. paradoxus as
the likely sister taxon (BP = 61–64%).
Stomach contents analysis
Scales, primarily those of cichlids, were a major component in the diet of five Perissodus species (P. microlepis, P.
straeleni, P. paradoxus, P. eccentricus, and P. elaviae). Except
in P. straeleni, scales accounted for approximately 90% of
the diets (Figure 3). Fry of the clupeids Limnothrissa miodon and Stolothrissa tanganicae, which are abundant in
pelagic open waters [24], or those of littoral cichlids, were
occasionally found in the stomach contents of these species. Fish skin (epidermal and dermal tissues) was
observed in the stomach contents of P. straeleni (16.0%).

In contrast, the proportion of scales in the diet was lower
among the basal lineages of Perissodus species than in the
above five species. Fish skin (47.7%) and scales (46.8%;
mainly of clupeids) were major diet components of P.
multidentatus. The scales were not found alone, but always
with skin. Perissodus hecqui appeared to be a zooplankton
feeder, with calanoid copepods as its main prey (54.5%),
although it also consumed clupeid fish fry (16.5%). The
stomach contents of this species also contained detrital
materials, including plant tissue, sponges, a few scales,
pieces of fish fin, and sand grains (11.5%).

Haplotaxodon species fed on several prey items, with the
pelagic shrimp Mysis sp. as the main prey (46.4% and
39.5%, respectively, in H. microlepis and H. trifasciatus),
followed by aggregates of small organic particles, which
included a variety of planktonic remains such as crustacean moults, plant cells, and phytoplankton. Planktonic
algae, mostly blue-green algae (mainly Microcystis and
Anabaena), green algae (e.g., Gloeocystis, Coelastrum), and
diatoms, were also found in the stomach contents. Clupeid fry were also consumed by H. trifasciatus (10.2%).
Habitat depths
Perissodus microlepis and P. straeleni were collected mainly
from shallow rocky regions less than 70 m in depth (Table
1). Perissodus paradoxus was found at depths of 2 to 162 m,
ranging from shallow rocky regions to deep areas. The
remaining four Perissodus species were collected only at
depths greater than 40 m. Haplotaxodon species were
found in shallow waters.
Morphology of the oral jaw teeth
Teeth were arranged in a single row on both the upper and
lower jaws in all Perissodini species. Five Perissodus spe-

cies, P. microlepis, P. eccentricus, P. straeleni, P. paradoxus,
and P. elaviae, had fewer but larger teeth (see Figures 4B
and 5) than did the other Perissodus and Haplotaxodon species, and these teeth were strongly recurved backwards. In
P. microlepis, the corners of the upper side of each tooth
projected vertically, forming a pair of spine-like points. In
P. eccentricus, one side of each tooth was sharply edged
with a blunt point on the tip, forming a fist-like projection. In P. straeleni, P. paradoxus, and P. elaviae, each tooth
had a laterally widened leaf-shaped crown, forming sharp
edges laterally. P. hecqui and P. multidentatus had a large
number of small teeth that were also recurved backwards.
The teeth of P. multidentatus had slim, elongated stems
with right-angled crowns, whereas those of P. hecqui had
short stems with leaf-shaped crowns. The teeth of Haplotaxodon species were generalised, small, conical in shape,
and slightly recurved backwards.
Ancestral reconstruction of feeding habits and morphology
The ancestral reconstruction of feeding habits based on
MP and ML methods both yielded similar results. The general carnivorous/plankton feeding found in Haplotaxodon
species and P. hecqui was most ancestral in Perissodini
(Figure 4A). The skin-eating habit most likely evolved
once in P. multidentatus. The specialized scale-eating habit
appeared to be monophyletic in the clade containing P.
elaviae, P. eccentricus, P. paradoxus, P. straeleni, and P. microlepis. The feeding habit prior to specialized scale eating
was undetermined; ML analysis gave the probability for
each character state at the ancestral node of P. multidentatus and the five specialized scale eaters as 0.45, 0.10 and
0.45 for general carnivorous/plankton feeding, skin eating, and scale eating respectively.

Reconstruction of tooth shapes indicated that the ancestral state was a recurved pattern in Perissodini (Figure 4B).
Sharply pointed tooth patterns occurred twice, independently, in P. microlepis and P. eccentricus. Parsimony reconstruction of habitat depths unambiguously indicated that
the deepwater habitat type was the most ancestral (Figure
4B) and that a transitional shift from deepwater to shallow rocky regions occurred in Perissodus.

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships of Perissodini species
The present molecular phylogenetic study based on the
AFLP method strongly supports monophyly for each species and provides important implications for the phylogenetic relationships in Perissodini (Figure 2). In the
Perissodini, the genus Haplotaxodon was not rejected as a
sister group to the genus Perissodus as was suggested by
Poll [4]. In the genus Perissodus, P. hecqui and P. multidentatus appeared as basal to other Perissodus species, as with
the morphological phylogeny of Liem & Stewart [6]. The
phylogenetic relationships of the remaining five species

revealed a sister relationship between P. microlepis and P.
straeleni, with P. paradoxus likely being a sister taxon. This
does not agree with the traditional classification, which
was primarily based on oral tooth morphology and
divides these into two groups: the "Plecodus" group
(including P. paradoxus, P. elaviae, and P. straeleni), and
the "Perissodus" group (including P. microlepis and P. eccentricus) (see Figure 4B) [4,6]. Tooth shape is an adaptive
morphological trait, which could be susceptible to homoplasy through natural selection [25,26]. Thus, the tradi-

tional morphological classification for this group cannot
be concluded to reflect their evolutionary relationships.
Rather, recurrent evolution of similar feeding morphology appears to have occurred with specialization to scale
eating, as will be discussed below.
The present AFLP phylogenetic tree agrees in part with the
AFLP tree suggested by Koblmüller et al. [17], particularly
in the sister relationship of P. microlepis and P. straeleni,
and the placement of Haplotaxodon species as sister to Per-

issodus species. Differences in resolution and phylogenetic
relationships are observed between the two studies, probably due to the limited number of AFLP characters and the
lack of P. eccentricus in their AFLP tree [17]. Our AFLP tree
obtained better resolution with over 1000 multilocus
AFLP characters, although some basal nodes for Perissodus
species were still not well resolved. This low resolution at
some nodes with short branch lengths can be partly
explained by rapid cladogenesis events that may have
occurred at the onset of the diversification of scale-eating
cichlids as previously suggested from mtDNA studies of
Perissodini and other Tanganyikan tribes [17,27,28].
The mtDNA phylogeny for Perissodini was recently
reported to show strong incongruence from AFLP phylogenetic trees [17]. Our phylogenetic analyses based on
mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences support these
result (see additional files 1 &2). Ancestral polymorphisms due to rapid cladogenesis events provide the most
likely explanation for these discrepancies, as has been suggested for several Tanganyikan cichlids [17,29]. Furthermore, hybridisation should also be considered as a
potential source for such incongruence. In our cytochrome b genealogy, P. microlepis and P. straeleni from the
northern and southern regions clustered together, and P.
elaviae and P. paradoxus shared similar haplotypes. These
results suggest that past and/or recurrent hybridisation
events may have occurred between these species pairs.
Evolution of scale eating
Ancestral reconstructions of feeding habits based on our
new phylogenetic framework suggest the evolution of
feeding in the Perissodini from general carnivorous feeding to highly specialized scale eating (Figure 4A). Haplotaxodon species appear to be general carnivorous feeders
that mainly collect mysid shrimp by effectively using their
upwardly pointed mouth. At the basal lineage of Perissodus, P. hecqui appears to be a zooplankton feeder. This
result agrees with the observation that P. hecqui has twice
as many gill rakers as other Perissodus species [30]. However, the specialized recurved oral teeth of P. hecqui, similar to those of the other Perissodus species, suggest some
biting function. This implies that the ancestral feeding
habit of Perissodus species involved some carnivory.
Another basal taxon, P. multidentatus, appears to feed on
both fish skin and scales at high rates. The fish skin was
always found with scales, implying that this species bites
the flanks of fish, rather than simply tearing off scales.
Such skin-eating may reflect an original mode of scale eating in this group.

The highly specialized scale-eating habit appears in the
five remaining species, which form a monophyletic
group, suggesting a single origin for specialization in this
lineage (Figure 4A). Among these species, P. straeleni also

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/195

uses other resources such as fish skins and fish fry (Figure
3). This may be an alternative feeding strategy of older,
large P. straeleni, which may show a decreased ability to
feed on scales, probably because of worn teeth [31]. In
fact, scale-less non-cichlid fishes such as catfish Chrysichthys spp. and Synodontis spp. are frequent targets of skin
eating by older P. straeleni [32]. Therefore, the most likely
explanation for the variation in food habits is secondary
divergence from scale eating as a consequence of supplementary feeding.
Divergence of feeding morphology and behaviour
It has been suggested that the oral jaw tooth structure of
Perissodus species is a unique adaptation for scale eating
[6,33]. Our study further indicates that the oral tooth
shapes have divergently differentiated, particularly among
the specialized scale eaters. Whereas the laterally sharpedged teeth of P. paradoxus, P. elaviae and P. straeleni
appear to function as blades for scraping scales, the broadbased, pointed teeth of P. microlepis probably function as
damage-resistant teeth to effectively hook and wrench off
scales [31]. Such functional significance may also have
promoted the convergent oral tooth structure in P. microlepis and P. eccentricus. However, whereas the teeth of
these two species have similar shapes for a wrenching
feeding action, the sharp edges of the teeth of P. eccentricus
imply a somewhat different function from that of P. microlepis; a scraping feeding action such as that observed in
P. straeleni may also be involved in the feeding behaviour
of P. eccentricus.

Our study also revealed a sister relationship of the coexisting specialized scale eaters P. microlepis and P. straeleni,
both of which are very common in the shallow waters of
Lake Tanganyika. These species exhibit differential feeding
morphologies and hunting behaviours [7]. Notably, these
two species increase their hunting success by diverting the
caution of the prey through diverse hunting techniques
[34-36]. This situation, termed 'exploitative mutualism'
[36], would play an important role in the stable coexistence of P. microlepis and P. straeleni, and may have promoted further morphological and behavioural divergence
of these two species under sympatric conditions.
Although nothing is known about the behaviour of deepwater scale eaters, such a relationship might also be found
between the deepwater, syntopic pair of scale eaters, P. elaviae and P. eccentricus, which also differ in oral tooth
shape.
The deepwater origin of scale eating
The present study suggests a deepwater origin for scale eating. In shallow rocky habitats, scale eaters share prey species with some specialized pursuit piscivores such as
Lepidiolamprologus spp. [37]. On the other hand, in deepwater habitats, such benthic pursuit hunters are absent,

though some pelagic piscivorous cichlids such as Bathybates spp. and general carnivorous cichlids such as Telotrematocara macrostoma are common [11]. Thus, the
feeding niche, which is dominated by the specialized pursuit hunters in the shallow habitat, seems to be vacant in
the deepwater habitat. It can therefore be speculated that
such a niche may have been exploited by the ancestor of
deepwater scale-eating cichlids. Their large recurved oral
jaw tooth shape, which differs from the conical tooth
shape of true piscivorous species, may also have been
suited for biting off small portions from their prey's flank.
Such morphological constraints might also have led this
group to further specialization of the scale eating habit.

Conclusion
Although scale-eating cichlids also inhabit other younger
African lakes, i.e., Lake Victoria and Lake Malawi, the
number of species and the degree of specialization for
scale eating are greatest in the Perissodus species of Lake
Tanganyika [1,11]. Our study revealed the phylogenetic
relationships of the Perissodini, and based on the resultant tree, for the first time, proposed a comprehensive evolutionary sequence for the specialization of scale-eating
habits. The mtDNA phylogenetic tree suggests that the
diversification of Perissodus species occurred roughly in
the late Neogene (1.7–7 Mya), implying that these species
may have experienced the dramatic geological events of
the lake, including the lake level changes that occurred
2.5–3 Mya, as discussed for Bathybatini [38]. The remarkable diversity of Perissodus could be attributed to the complex geological history of Lake Tanganyika and complex
interspecific relationships among fishes in the lake.

Methods
Specimens
Specimens of all nine described species from the tribe Perissodini (two Haplotaxodon and seven Perissodus), and representatives of lineages nested close to the Perissodini in
the analysis of Salzburger et al. [14] (two cyprichromine
species, two benthochromines, and three lamprologines),
were collected at Kasenga, Zambia, and from several other
sites in Lake Tanganyika (Figure 1). Specimens were collected using gill nets, anaesthetised by storing in an icebox, and preserved in 99% ethanol. Specimens for the
analysis of stomach contents were injected with 37% formaldehyde solution into the stomach and were subsequently preserved in 10% formaldehyde solution.
Specimens for the observation of jaw morphology were
also preserved in 10% formaldehyde solution. These collection procedures were approved under the guidelines for
animal experiments enacted by the Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT).

The habitat depths of all Perissodini species were estimated from collection records conducted at various water

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/195

depths near Kasenga, Zambia. These samples were collected using gill nets (see Table 1).
Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis
The AFLP analysis followed a protocol modified from Vos
et al. [39]. The AFLP Plant Mapping Kit protocol (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used. DNA digestion was performed using EcoRI (20 units; New England
Biolaboratories, Beverly, MA, USA), and MseI (5 units) at
37°C for 5 h in a thermal cycler. At the end of 5 h, a ligation reaction was performed with a restriction mixture
containing each EcoRI and MseI adapter at 16°C overnight. Pre-selective amplification with one selective base
on each primer (EcoRI-A and MseI-C) and 11 different
selective amplifications was performed using the following combinations of primers with two additional bases
(CT-TT, CG-TT, CA-TT, CG-TG, GG-TC, CT-TA, CA-TA,
GG-AC, CT-AC, CA-AC, AG-AC). PCR was performed on a
PC808 thermal cycler (ASTEC, Fukuoka, Japan). The DNA
concentration was checked prior to restriction reactions.
Fragments were electrophoresed on an ABI Prism 310
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) with internal size
standards (GS 500 ROX; Applied Biosystems). Signal
detection was carried out using GeneScan ver. 3.1
(Applied Biosystems). The fluorescence threshold was set
to 50 r.f.u. and the correct fit of size standards was checked
for all electropherograms. Scoring to presence/absence
was conducted between 50 and 499 bases using Genotyper ver. 2.5 (Applied Biosystems). Peaks with values <0.4
were considered the same.

Nei and Li [40] genetic distances were calculated with the
site (nucleotide) length set at 16 using the program Restdist in PHYLIP ver. 3.65 [41]. Trees were constructed using
the NJ algorithm [42] implemented in Neighbour in
PHYLIP. Alternative restriction site length parameters of
10 and 26 for the distance program were also used to
examine the robustness of the distance model. To assess
the robustness of the NJ tree, 1000 bootstrap replications
were conducted with each site length parameter using
Seqboot and Neighbour in PHYLIP.
Stomach contents analysis
Stomach fullness was assessed under a light microscope
according to Hynes' [43] point method with minor modification, i.e., 4 points for 1/4 fullness, 8 points for 1/2
fullness, 16 points for complete (1×) fullness, and 32
points for twice (2×) fullness. After each food item in the
stomach was identified, its volume relative to the fullness
points was judged. Points were allotted to each food item
according to the relative volume. The percent contribution of each food item in each species was calculated by
pooling the total points for each food item and dividing
by the sum of stomach fullness points.

Observation of oral jaw tooth morphology
The oral jaws were removed from one specimen for each
Perissodus and Haplotaxodon species, cleaned with water
and dehydrated in 70% ethanol. The oral jaw teeth were
then observed and photographed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JSM5800, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) for
Perissodus species, and a digital microscope (VHX-100,
Keyence, Osaka, Japan) for Haplotaxodon species. The
teeth were coated with gold prior to SEM photographing.
The numbers of teeth on both jaws were also enumerated
under a binocular microscope. Full adults with relatively
few missing teeth were used to minimise the effects of natural replacement or wearing out of the teeth.

Ancestral state reconstruction
Ancestral reconstruction of feeding habits, oral tooth morphology and habitat depths were undertaken using the NJ
tree from the AFLP dataset. For reconstruction of feeding
habits, oral jaw tooth morphologies, and habitat depths,
maximum parsimony ancestral reconstruction was performed using Mesquite [44]. Additionally, maximumlikelihood ancestral reconstruction was performed for
reconstruction of ancestral states of feeding habits, using
Mesquite, based on a Markov k-state one-parameter
model [44].
