Abstract
Background: Thrombospondins (TSPs) are evolutionarily-conserved, extracellular, calciumbinding glycoproteins with important roles in cell-extracellular matrix interactions, angiogenesis,
synaptogenesis and connective tissue organisation. Five TSPs, designated TSP-1 through TSP-5, are
encoded in the human genome. All but one have known roles in acquired or inherited human
diseases. To further understand the roles of TSPs in human physiology and pathology, it would be
advantageous to extend the repertoire of relevant vertebrate models. In general the zebrafish is
proving an excellent model organism for vertebrate biology, therefore we set out to evaluate the
status of TSPs in zebrafish and two species of pufferfish.
Results: We identified by bioinformatics that three fish species encode larger numbers of TSPs
than vertebrates, yet all these sequences group as homologues of TSP-1 to -4. By phylogenomic
analysis of neighboring genes, we uncovered that, in fish, a TSP-4-like sequence is encoded from
the gene corresponding to the tetrapod TSP-5 gene. Thus, all TSP genes show conservation of
synteny between fish and tetrapods. In the human genome, the TSP-1, TSP-3, TSP-4 and TSP-5
genes lie within paralogous regions that provide insight into the ancestral genomic context of
vertebrate TSPs.
Conclusion: A new model for TSP evolution in vertebrates is presented. The TSP-5 protein
sequence has evolved rapidly from a TSP-4-like sequence as an innovation in the tetrapod lineage.
TSP biology in fish is complicated by the presence of additional lineage- and species-specific TSP
paralogues. These novel results give deeper insight into the evolution of TSPs in vertebrates and
open new directions for understanding the physiological and pathological roles of TSP-4 and TSP5 in humans.

The thrombospondins (TSPs) are extracellular, calcium-

binding glycoproteins with roles in cell-extracellular

aptogenesis, and the organization of connective extracellular matrix (ECM) [1-4]. TSPs have been well-conserved
in animal evolution as ECM components. The Drosophila
melanogaster genome encodes a single TSP which is
dynamically expressed during embryogenesis at sites of
tissue remodeling including imaginal discs, precursor
myoblasts, and muscle/tendon attachment sites [5]. A TSP
of the kuruma prawn, Marsupenaeus japonicus, is a major
component of oocyte cortical rods, specialized storage
structures for ECM components that are released to cover
the egg upon fertilization [6]. Five TSPs, designated TSP-1
to TSP-5, are encoded in the human and mouse genomes,
all of which have dynamic and specific patterns of expression during embryogenesis and in adult life (reviewed in
[3]). Mouse gene knockouts prepared for TSP-1, TSP-2,
TSP-3, and TSP-5 have demonstrated distinct roles for
these family members in normal tissue development and/
or adult physiology and pathology [7-10].
All TSPs have the same domain architecture in their C-terminal regions, consisting of EGF domains, a series of calcium-binding, TSP type 3 repeats and a globular Cterminus that is related in structure to L-type lectins
[11,12]. The entire C-terminal region forms a structural
unit in which calcium-binding has a critical role in the
physical conformation and functional properties [13-15].
Many TSPs also contain a globular amino-terminal
domain that folds as a laminin G-like domain [16]. Vertebrate TSPs can be grouped into two structural subgroups,
A and B, according to their molecular architecture and oligomerization status [17]. TSP-1 and TSP-2, in subgroup A,
are distinguished by the presence of a von Willebrand factor type_C (vWF_C) domain and three thrombospondin
type 1 repeats adjacent to their N-terminal domains and
oligomerize as trimers. TSP-3, TSP-4 and TSP-5, (TSP-5 is
also known as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, COMP
[18]), in subgroup B lack these domains, contain an additional EGF domain and assemble as pentamers [19-21].
TSP-5/COMP also lacks a distinct N-terminal domain. The
multidomain and multimeric organization of TSPs mediate their complex and tissue-specific physiological functions that are known in mammals.
Importantly, TSP family members have multiple roles in
inherited and acquired human disease. TSP-5/COMP is
most highly expressed in cartilage and point mutations in
its type 3 repeats and L-lectin domain are causal in pseudoanchrondroplastic dysplasia (PSACH) and some forms
of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) (OMIM 117170
and 132400). These mutations cause functional perturbation through effects on calcium-binding and intra- or
intermolecular interactions that impair both the posttranslational processing and secretion of TSP-5/COMP
and its interactions with other ECM molecules in cartilage
ECM (reviewed in [22]). Single nucleotide polymor-

phisms (SNPs) in the coding sequences of TSP-1 and TSP4 are associated with increased risk of familial premature
heart disease [23,24]. These coding SNPs also alter the calcium-binding and physical properties of TSP C-terminal
regions, correlating with altered interactions with and signaling effects on vascular cells [25-27]. In contrast, a SNP
in the 3' untranslated region of TSP-2 has protective
effects against myocardial infarction [23]. Also indicative
of a protective role in the myocardium, TSP-2 gene knockout mice have increased susceptibility to angiotensin IIinduced cardiac failure [28]. TSP-1 and TSP-2 are also
known as natural inhibitors of angiogenesis that can suppress the vascularization of tumors by triggering microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis by binding CD36
(reviewed in [2]). Down-regulation of TSP-1 has been
documented in certain human tumors and the expression
level of TSP-1 impacts on tumor growth [29-31]. A TSP-1
peptide mimetic is in clinical trial as a novel anti-cancer
therapy [32].
To date, the functions of TSPs in vivo have been examined
experimentally only in mice, yet in general the zebrafish is
proving an excellent model for analysis of the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems and has the definite
advantages of a faster lifecycle, large numbers of progeny,
and accessibility of all embryonic stages for experimental
analysis and imaging [33,34]. However, despite an
intense research focus on mammalian TSPs, the phylogeny of TSPs in other vertebrates is not well understood.
With these considerations in mind, we have combined
molecular phylogenetic and phylogenomic approaches to
address whether fish would be appropriate model organisms for future experimental study of TSPs in relation to
their roles in human disease.

Results
An overview of TSPs in vertebrate subphyla
Five separate TSP-encoding genes have been identified in
human and mouse. To prepare a full TSP dataset that
included other vertebrate subphyla, we searched the
sequenced genomes of the chicken Gallus gallus [35]; the
fish Takifugu rubripes (marine pufferfish) [36]; Tetraodon
nigroviridis (freshwater pufferfish) [37]; Danio rerio
(zebrafish) [38,39] and the amphibian Xenopus tropicalis
([40]; genome assembly v4.1 at JGI), with either human
TSP-1 or TSP-5 as the query sequence. TBLASTN searches
were made against the genomic sequences, and BLASTP
searches were carried out against databases of genomepredicted proteins, if available. These approaches identified that the G. gallus and X. tropicalis genomes each
encode five TSPs (Table 1). These were identified as orthologues of TSPs 1–5 of human and mouse by BLASTP
search against the non-redundant protein database at
NCBI. The lack of an amino-terminal globular domain is
a distinctive feature of mammalian TSP-5/COMP, and we

Predicted proteins are assigned by their BLASTP bit scores against the five human TSPs. Proteins are identified according to GenBank accession
numbers where available. In the case of T. rubripes, the Fugu genome-predicted protein identifiers are given; for D. rerio, sequences not in GenBank
are identified by their Ensembl DARP numbers. X. tropicalis proteins are identified according to the genome assembly 4.1 Gene Models (proteins)
identifiers. Chromosomal locations are given in brackets for the physically mapped genomes and genomic scaffold numbers are provided for T.

confirmed that this domain was indeed absent from G.
gallus and X. tropicalis TSP-5 [see Additional File 1]. Each
of the identified G. gallus and X. tropicalis TSPs also corresponded to a transcribed sequence, as established by identification of exactly-matching cDNAs, either from
published sequences or from expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) in the NCBI dbEST database (data not shown).
Four of the chicken TSP genes have been mapped and, as
in human and mouse, each is located on a different chromosome [41] (Table 1). The X. tropicalis genome is currently assembled in scaffold form only.
In contrast, our searches of the three fish genomes identified 6 to 8 TSPs encoded in each genome (Table 1). The T.
rubripes and T. nigroviridis genomes each encoded six TSP
sequences. By BLASTP searches, these sequences grouped
as homologues of TSP-1, TSP-2, TSP-3 or TSP-4 (Table 1).
In the case of T. rubripes, two sequences were most similar
to TSP-1, two sequences were most similar to TSP-4, and
the remaining two sequences were most similar to TSP-2
or TSP-3, respectively. Each TSP-encoding sequence was
located on a different genomic scaffold (Table 1). In T.
nigroviridis, two sequences were most closely-related to
TSP-1, one to TSP-2, and three were most similar to TSP4. The T. nigroviridis genome has been mapped physically

[37] and each of the six TSPs were located on a different
chromosome (Table 1).
From the zebrafish genome, assembly Zv5 of August
2005, we identified 8 TSP-like sequences. As in the pufferfish, the D.rerio TSP sequences appeared homologous to
either TSP-1, -2, -3 or -4 (Table 1). Two of the TSPs corresponded exactly to published sequences for D. rerio TSP-3
and TSP-4 predicted from cDNA [42] (Table 1). The other
six sequences encoded a predicted TSP-1, two TSP-2s,
another TSP-3, and two other predicted TSP-4-like
polypeptides. The six mapped genes are encoded at separate loci (Table 1). We took advantage of the large number
of ESTs available from zebrafish in dbEST (634, 605 as of
August 1, 2005) to establish whether all eight TSPs are
transcribed : ESTs of 100 % identity were identified for six
of the TSPs, but not for the TSP-2 on chromosome 12 or
the partial TSP-4c sequence on chromosome 5. Our further analysis therefore focused on the six TSPs that are definitely transcribed.
Relationship of fish and tetrapod TSPs : assessment by
molecular phylogeny
In view of the larger numbers of TSPs in each fish genome
and the many TSP-4-like sequences, we assessed the relationships of the predicted proteins to tetrapod TSP-1 to -5

sequences contained adjacent paired cysteine residues
that aligned in the expected A or B patterns with those of
the frog and chicken TSPs (Fig. 1A). Thus, with regard to
oligomerization, fish TSPs are identical to tetrapod TSPs.

in more detail. A signature of TSP subgroups A and B is
associated with the heptad-repeat coiled-coil domain that
mediates oligomerization of TSP subunits. Subgroup A
and B family members differ in the placement of two
cysteine residues that assist oligomerization by forming
inter-subunit disulfide bonds : these cysteines are located
before the coiled-coil domain in subgroup A TSPs and
after the coiled-coil in subgroup B TSPs [5,19-21]. We
aligned the available predicted heptad-repeat regions
(identified by the COILS program) of the TSPs from fish,
X. tropicalis and G. gallus and examined the positioning of
any adjacent paired cysteine residues. All the fish TSP

We examined the domain architecture of the fish TSPs
through the CDD, SMART and InterPro databases. All the
fish-encoded sequences identified as homologous to
mammalian TSP-1 and TSP-2 contained vWF_C and TSP
type 1 domains and were thus confirmed as belonging to
TSP subgroup A. Those identified as subgroup B homologues on the basis of the oligomerization domain lacked
these domains and included an additional EGF domain.
All known TSPs contain at least one EGF domain with a
consensus sequence for beta-hydroxylation of an asparagine residue, indicative of a capacity for calcium-binding,
[43], and this trait was conserved in all the newly-identified fish TSPs (data not shown). Human and mouse TSP3 and TSP-4 are distinguished from TSP-5 by the presence
of a 4-amino acid insert motif, PPGP, at the end of the
sixth type 3 repeat that may alter calcium-binding activity
[44]. Examination of the sixth type 3 repeat of the subgroup B TSPs in our dataset revealed that PPGP motifs
were present in the fish TSP-3, TSP-4a and TSP-4b
sequences and also, unexpectedly, in each of TSP-3, TSP-4
and TSP-5 from X. tropicalis and chicken. D. rerio TSP-3a
has an unusually long repeat that contains a variant motif,
GIGP (Fig. 1B). These results reveal that the absence of the
PPGP motif from mammalian TSP-5 is a secondary trait
that is not inherent to all forms of TSP-5.
We next examined the relationship of the TSP-4-like
sequences in fish to mammalian TSP-4 in more detail.
Although the highest BLASTP bit scores are with TSP-4,
the sequences also had extensive similarity with TSP-3 and
TSP-5, when compared on the basis of their C-terminal
regions (Table 2). We examined all the fish subgroup B
sequences for the presence or absence of the globular TSP
amino-terminal domain. All the predicted fish TSP-3s and
many of the TSP-4s contained a TSP amino-terminal
domain. However, in each fish genome, one of the TSP-4like sequences (T. nigroviridis TSP-4b, T. rubripes TSP-4b
and D. rerio TSP-4b, respectively) lacked the amino-terminal domain [see Additional File 1]. This finding opened
up the possibility that, despite their overall highest
sequence identity with mammalian TSP-4 polypeptides,
these proteins are related to tetrapod TSP-5/COMP. To
further examine the relationships of fish TSP-4s to tetrapod TSP-4 and TSP-5, the highly-conserved C-terminal
regions, (i.e., the type 3 repeats and L-lectin domain;
[11]), of all the sequences in our dataset were aligned
using CLUSTALW and compared as an Phylip unrooted
tree. The TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-3 sequences each formed a
distinct branch in the diagram : i.e., in each case these
sequences are more closely related to each other than to

any other TSP. In contrast, the TSP-4 and tetrapod TSP-5
sequences formed a broad grouping in which the TSP-5s
clustered but were not on a distinct branch in relation to
the TSP-4s (Fig. 2A). In similar unrooted trees made without the fish TSPs, the five TSPs of tetrapods each form a
separate branch [5]. To evaluate how well supported the
TSP-3, TSP-4 and TSP-5 branches are, we also prepared a
TCOFFEE alignment and conducted phylogenetic analysis
by the PHYML maximum-likelihood algorithm that
includes bootstrap analysis (Fig. 2B). Both analysis methods consistently strongly supported the key branches leading to the TSP-1 and TSP-2 groups and the TSP-3 group as
forming a distinct sub-branch. However, the PHYML analysis produced a different ordering of the branches leading
to the TSP-3, TSP-4 and TSP-5/COMP groups and the
bootstrap analysis indicated only weak support for nodes
relating to the TSP-4 and TSP-5 sequences (Fig. 2B). Thus,
the molecular phylogenies suggested a possible close relationship between TSP-4 and TSP-5, but did not provide a
clear resolution of the relationships of the TSP-3, TSP-5
and TSP-5/COMP sequences.
Syntenic relationships of tetrapod and fish TSP genes :
TSP-5/COMP is encoded at an ancient locus
The species-specific encoding of paralogous pairs of TSP 1-, TSP-3-, or TSP-4 in fish raised the possibility that these
TSP genes exist as a result of the additional genome duplication that took place early in the Actinopterygii (rayfinned fish) lineage [36,45,46]. In addition, the intriguing
possible relationship between fish TSP-4-like sequences
and TSP-5 suggested that tetrapod TSP-5/COMP might
have arisen through a relatively recent gene duplication of
TSP-4 with subsequent loss of the exons encoding the

amino-terminal domain. If TSP-5/COMP did arise from a
recent TSP-4 gene duplication then, according to the
molecular clock hypothesis, the encoded protein would
be expected to have closer sequence identity to TSP-4 than
to other members of subgroup B [47]. Our molecular phylogenies (Fig. 2) and other phylogenetic studies have not
convincingly resolved the relationships of tetrapod TSP-3,
TSP-4 and TSP-5 [48,49]. The overall pairwise sequence
identities of TSP-3, TSP-4, and TSP-5 are very similar in
any given tetrapod species. For example, in pairwise comparisons of the region from the coiled-coil domain to the
C-terminus of human subgroup B TSPs, the identity
between TSP-3 and TSP-4 is 60 %, between TSP-3 and
TSP-5 is 58 %, and between TSP-4 and TSP-5 is 63 %. Similar results are obtained if the comparison is made in other
tetrapod species (data not shown). Furthermore, the exon
organization of the TSP-3, TSP-4 and TSP-5 genes in
human and mouse are near-identical, with the TSP-5/
COMP gene lacking the four exons that encode the
amino-terminal domain [50-52]. Therefore, as an independent approach to understand the evolutionary relationships between fish and tetrapod TSPs, in particular the
relationship of TSP-4 and TSP-5, we undertook a phylogenomic analysis of the conservation of neighboring genes
around each TSP gene locus in the available mapped fish
and tetrapod genomes. Conservation of synteny is a powerful approach to reconstruct evolutionary processes
when multiple physically-mapped genome sequences are
available. The criterion for conservation of synteny is that
orthologous gene loci are linked in different species, irrespective of the exact gene order or the presence of nonconserved intervening genes [53].

in other species. We found that that the GPR and CHRM5
genes are conserved in the vicinity of the TSP-1a genes of
T. nigriviridis and T. rubripes and the single TSP-1 gene of
D. rerio. The RYR3 gene was also conserved adjacent to D.
rerio TSP-1 (Fig. 3). RYR3, CHRM5 and SRP14 were also
adjacent to the TSP-1b genes of T. nigriviridis and T.
rubripes, providing clear evidence that both TSP-1 genes in
pufferfish are paralogues that arose through duplication
of an ancestral TSP-1-encoding locus that was common to
fish and tetrapods. This intepretation is also supported by
the presence in T. rubripes of ANG-1 that is also adjacent
to the chicken TSP-1 gene (Fig. 3).

Protein sequence relationships of the C-terminal

DRAWTREE and is presented in Phylodendron. The cluster

First, we examined the NCBI mapped genomic scaffolds
to identify genes immediately adjacent to the TSP-encoding loci of human, mouse and chicken, because TSP-1 to 5 were originally defined in these species. For each TSP
gene, we could identify local neighboring genes that have
been conserved between all three species. In the case of
the TSP-1 gene, the RYR3, CHRM5, E1F2AK4 and SRP14
genes were syntenic with the TSP-1 gene in all three species and several other genes (GPR, FLJ39531 and
FLJ35695) were conserved between two species (Fig. 3).
These conserved neighboring genes provided a "fingerprint" by which to recognize the orthologous TSP-1 locus

For the TSP-2 gene, six neighboring genes (AGPAT,
MAP3K4, DACT2, SMOC2, PHF10 and TCTE3) are conserved between human, mouse and chicken. Loci encoding RO610012K18 and R1600012H06 are also conserved
between mouse and chicken (Fig. 4). AGPAT4 and
MAP3K4 are conserved in all three fish species and the
gene encoding RO610012K18 is also conserved in T.
rubripes. Additionally, SLC35F3 and KCNK1 are adjacent
in both pufferfish species : these genes are syntenic with
TSP-2 in chicken but not in mouse or human (Fig. 4 and
data not shown).
The TSP-3 genes of human and mouse are part of a wellconserved gene cluster that includes the genes encoding
metaxin-1 (MTX1) and the polymorphic epithelial mucin
(MUC-1) (Fig. 5A). In human and mouse, the TSP-3 gene
shares a common promoter region with MTX1 and is transcribed divergently. An adjacent metaxin pseudogene has
also been recognized [54,55]. Other genes local to the
TSP-3 gene (TXNIP1, CKIP-1, DPM2, KRTCAP2, TRIM46,
GBA and SCAMP3) were also conserved between human
and mouse. Although expression of the chicken TSP-3
transcript has been well-characterized, [56], the chicken
TSP-3 gene is as yet unmapped and was therefore unavailable for comparison. All the fish TSP-3 gene loci were syntenic with the tetrapod TSP-3 genes, on the basis of
conservation of at least two of the adjacent genes (Fig. 5A:
because the TSP-3 gene of T. rubripes is located at the end
of the scaffold sequence the presence of MTX1 could not
be assessed). The conservation of similar neighboring
genes identified D. rerio TSP-3a and TSP-3b as paralogues
that arose through duplication of an ancestral TSP-3encoding locus.
Interestingly, the TSP-4 genes of human, mouse, and
chicken are all immediately adjacent to the gene encoding
another member of the metaxin family, metaxin-3
(MTX3). Three other flanking genes are conserved
between human, mouse and chicken, CMYA5, PAPD4
and ZFYVE16. The gene encoding Riken A130038L21 is
also conserved adjacent to the mouse and chicken TSP-4
genes (Fig. 5B). Of the TSP-4-like genes of fish, TSP-4a in

Syntenic3relationships of TSP-1 gene loci in fish and tetrapods
Syntenic relationships of TSP-1 gene loci in fish and tetrapods. The physically-mapped genomes of human, mouse,
chicken, T. nigriviridis, T. rubripes and D. rerio were used to identify conserved gene neighbors of the TSP-1 gene. In each panel,
each diagram represents the order of genes on the chromosome in the vicinity of the relevant TSP gene. Each horizontal line
represents a gene; only the conserved genes are labeled with gene names. Protein designations are used for genes lacking a
gene name. TSP genes are shown in bold. Numbers above and below each diagram refer to the position on the chromosome in
bases. For visual simplicity of presentation, all diagrams are orientated for similarity of gene order.

T. nigriviridis is encoded adjacent to MTX3, CMYA5 and
A130038L21 and was thus established as syntenic with
tetrapod the TSP-4 gene (Fig. 5B). Genes adjacent to T.
rubripes TSP-4a did not include MTX3 but were similar to
those adjacent to T. nigriviridis TSP-4c (discussed further
below).
With regard to the other fish genes encoding TSP-4-like
proteins, we first examined the chromosomal region of
the tetrapod TSP-5/COMP genes. In human, mouse and
chicken the TSP-5 gene has a distinct set of conserved gene
neighbors, FLJ11078, MECT1, RENT1, GDF1/LASS1 and
COPE (Fig. 6). With these clear criteria for identification
of the TSP-5 gene in hand, one TSP-4-like encoding
sequence in each fish genome (TSP-4b, CAG00605, of T.
nigriviridis; TSP-4b, scaffold 305, of T. rubripes, and TSP4b, XP_690679, of D. rerio) was found to be encoded at a
locus syntenic with tetrapod TSP-5/COMP (Fig. 6). These

data define that the gene that encodes TSP-5/COMP in
tetrapods predates the divergence of fish and tetrapods.
In T. nigroviridis, the TSP-4c gene has gene neighbors unrelated to those of TSP-4 or TSP-5. The same gene neighbors
were conserved adjacent to T. rubripes TSP-4a (Fig. 5B). We
infer that the fish-specific duplication of the TSP-4 gene
was accompanied in the puffer-fish lineage by transposition of one of the duplicated genes. Both paralogues have
been retained in T. nigriviridis whereas the TSP-4 gene at
the ancestral locus has been lost in T. rubripes.
Evidence for paralogous relationships between four TSPencoding loci in the human genome
The above results clarified the identities of fish TSP genes
in relation to tetrapod TSP genes, yet still did not resolve
certain ambiguities with regard to the relationships of the
TSP-3, TSP-4 and TSP-5 genes. At the level of genome
organization, the conserved synteny of both the TSP-3

and TSP-4 genes with genes encoding members of the
metaxin family suggests that the TSP-3 and TSP-4 genes lie
within paralogous genomic regions that arose from the
same ancestral DNA duplication event [57]. On this basis,
the TSP-3 and TSP-4 genes can be considered closely
related. Because no metaxin gene is found adjacent to the
TSP-5/COMP locus, or indeed on the same chromosome
in any of the organisms studied, and other local conserved
gene neighbors of the TSP-5/COMP gene are distinct from
those conserved adjacent to the TSP-4 gene (Fig. 5B and
Fig. 6), the TSP-5 gene appears more remote from TSP-3
and TSP-4. Yet, by criteria of protein sequence relationships, the new data from fish demonstrate a very close
relationship between TSP-4-like coding sequences and
TSP-5 (Fig. 2). To integrate these separate and apparently
paradoxical pieces of data, we took advantage of the
extensive analysis of human genome sequence organization that has identified large paralogous chromosomal
regions within the human genome itself. The existence of
such regions provides evidence for the rapid evolution of
vertebrate genomes through large-scale block or genomewide DNA duplication in an ancestral chordate [57-59].
We tested whether any of the five TSP-encoding loci are
located in paralogous region of the human genome by
searching the "dataset of paralogons in the human
genome", version 5.28 [57]. The human genome is suitable for this form of analysis because the rate of DNA rearrangement has been slower than in rodents [60].
The TSP-4 gene at 5q23 was located within a chromosomal block with significant paralogy (6 pairs of shared
genes) to the chromosomal block of the TSP-3 gene (Fig.

7A). Importantly, the TSP-5/COMP locus at chromosome
19p13.1 was identified to lie within a chromosomal
region with clear paralogy to a block of chromosome 5
that included the TSP-4 gene (13 pairs of shared genes;
Fig. 7B). Although located within a 5 Mb region of chromosome 19, the paralogous genes are spread throughout
a 46.5 Mb region of chromosome 5, explaining why the
relationship was not detected by analysis of local neighboring genes. The TSP-5/COMP locus is also paralogous
with the region of the TSP-3 gene on chromosome 1q (7
pairs of shared genes; Fig. 7C). Interestingly, paralogy of
the TSP-4 region to the TSP-1 locus at 15q15 was also
detected, albeit on the basis of two pairs of related genes
(Fig. 7D). The TSP-2 locus at 6q27 was not paralogous to
any of these regions but was part of a separate block of
paralogy with a region of chromosome 8 (4 pairs of
shared genes; Fig. 7E). We infer that the TSP-2 gene underwent replicative transposition subsequent to the duplication event that gave rise to the TSP-1 and TSP-2 genes.
To substantiate these findings, additional paralogy
searches were carried out for the three members of the
metaxin family: the searches with metaxin-1 and metaxin3 again identified the paralogy between the chromosomal
regions of TSP-3 and TSP-4. No paralogous region was
identified with regard to the metaxin-2 locus on chromosome 2 (data not shown). Of the other gene pairs identified within the paralogous regions of the TSP-3, TSP-4 and
TSP-5 genes, members of the MEF (myocyte enhancer factor) and KCNN (potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated channel, subfamily N) families
were consistently present in all the paired blocks (Fig. 7A–

Syntenic relationships of TSP-3 and TSP-4 gene loci in fish and tetrapods. The physically-mapped genomes of human,

A) and the TSP-4 gene (panel B). Diagrams are arranged as in Fig. 3. D. rerio TSP-4a is not included because sequence assembly
for this region is unfinished in Zv5 (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute).
C; KCNN paralogy is not shown in Fig. 7A, but KCNN2 is
located at 113.73 Mb of chromosome 5 and KCNN3 is
located at 151.7Mb of chromosome 1; [61]. Thus, the
ancestral chromosomal region likely included ancestral
MEF and KCNN genes in the vicinity of a TSP gene. We
tested this idea by examining whether MEF or KCNN family members are also syntenic with TSPs in other vertebrates. From the available mapping information, MEF-2D
in mouse and zebrafish are located on the same chromosomes as the TSP-3 gene (TSP-3a on chromosome 16 in
the case of zebrafish), and MEF-2C and MEF-2B in the
mouse are located on the same chromosomes as TSP-4
and TSP-5, respectively. KCNN1 is also on mouse chromosome 8; KCNN2 is syntenic with TSP-4 in chicken but
not in mouse, and KCNN3 is syntenic with TSP-4b (i.e.

the TSP-5 locus) in T. nigriviridis. These data reinforce the
intepretation that the TSP-3, TSP-4 and TSP-5 genes have
evolved as a consequence of duplications of the same
ancestral genomic region.

Discussion
Our study, initiated with the aim of assessing the suitability of zebrafish as a model organism for future experimental study of TSPs in relation to their roles in human
disease, delivers some unexpected conclusions that
change current perspectives on the TSP gene family in vertebrates. Based on a combination of molecular phylogenetic and phylogenomic approaches, we propose a new
model for the evolution of TSPs in vertebrates.

Syntenic6relationships of TSP-5 gene loci in fish and tetrapods
Syntenic relationships of TSP-5 gene loci in fish and tetrapods. The physically-mapped genomes of human, mouse,
chicken, T. nigriviridis, T. rubripes and D. rerio were used to identify conserved gene neighbors of the TSP-5 gene and to identify
orthologues of the TSP-5 gene in fish. Diagrams are arranged as in Fig. 3.

The encoding of large numbers of TSPs in three species of
fish, that include paralogous pairs of TSP-1, TSP-3, or TSP4 genes, is in line with the strong evidence that ray-finned
fish underwent an additional whole genome duplication
after the divergence of the bony fish and tetrapod lineages
around 450 million years ago [36,45-47]. In general, after
a gene duplication event, reduced selection pressure on
one of the paralogous genes can have several consequences. One gene may be lost relatively rapidly, or both
genes may be retained and diverge functionally, either by
sub-specialization of the original function or by evolving
new functions [62,63]. For the TSP family, the three fish
species provide evidence of distinct lineage-specific events
involving loss or retention of different TSP paralogues. For
example, T. nigriviridis encodes two TSP-1s but does not
encode a TSP-3, whereas D. rerio encodes two TSP-3s and
a single TSP-1 (Table 1). The retention of both members
of a paralogous pair may have resulted in functional specialization. Thus, each of the fish TSP-1 or TSP-3 paralogues could have a subset of the functions of tetrapod
TSP-1 or TSP-3, or may have evolved distinct and novel
functions.

are present, it is clear that the existence of A and B forms
predates the whole genome duplications that occurred in
the early stages of vertebrate evolution ([5,64]; our
unpublished data). These conclusions are supported by
evidence that large scale gene duplication activity
increased substantially after the divergence of amphioxus
(a cephalochordate) from the vertebrate lineage [65].
Whereas Ciona intestinalis encodes a single subgroup A
TSP (GenBank AAS45620; [5]), inspection of available
ESTs from a cartilaginous fish, the little skate Leucoraja erinacea, indicates that transcripts corresponding to both
TSP-1 and TSP-2 are present (GenBank CV068535 and
CV067510). Thus, for subgroup A, an expansion of gene
number appears common to both cartilaginous and bony
fish. This observation is in agreement with a recent statistical estimate that most vertebrate-specific gene duplications occurred before the separation of cartilaginous and
bony fish [66]. For additional clarification of the phasing
of expansion of the TSP gene family in the chordate and
vertebrate lineages, the genome sequences of a jawless vertebrate (i.e., lamphrey or hagfish) and a cephalochordate
are needed.

We could readily identify synteny of the TSP-encoding
loci in fish with the chromosomal regions of tetrapod TSP
genes. This finding establishes that precursors of the TSP1 to TSP-5 genes were all present within corresponding
ancestral genomic contexts in the last common ancestor
of bony fish and tetrapods. This state appears to have originated within the chordate lineage. The Ciona intestinalis
(an invertebrate chordate) genome encodes a smaller
number of TSPs; yet, because both A and B forms of TSPs

A second major finding from the phylogenomic analysis
was the definition of the conservation of the TSP-5/
COMP-encoding locus. Although the overall sequence
characteristics of the TSP-5/COMP protein appear specific
to tetrapods, the encoding locus is common to both bony
fish and tetrapods (Fig. 6). Thus, the TSP gene at this locus
did not originate in tetrapods. In fish, the similarity of the

Paralogous relationships of TSP-encoding loci in the human
Paralogous relationships of TSP-encoding loci in the
human genome. The database of Paralogons in the human
genome, version 5.28, was searched for evidence of largescale similarities of genomic organization in the chromosomal
regions of the five thrombospondin genes. Panels A to E
show the five paralogous blocks identified, their chromosomal locations, and the gene pairs that make up each block.
The genomic regions of subgroup B TSPs are strongly
related, the TSP-1 and TSP-4 loci are marginally related and
the TSP-2 gene is located within an unrelated region of the
genome. In each block, the paired TSP genes are labeled in
red. Other genes present in multiple blocks are underlined.
Genes are identified according to HUGO gene nomenclature
where available, or by the GenBank accession number of the
encoded predicted protein. In B, gene order on chromosome
19 is displayed in an expanded view.
with subsequent loss of the exons encoding the aminoterminal domain. This view is strongly supported by the
clear large-scale paralogy between the chromosomal
regions of the human TSP-4 and TSP-5 genes. However,
whereas all vertebrate TSP-3 and TSP-4 genes are encoded
adjacent to a metaxin family member, no metaxin gene is
present on the same chromosome as the TSP-5/COMP
gene in any genome. The most parsimonious intepretation of these data would be that, subsequent to an initial
duplication of a TSP-4-like gene, an ancestral metaxin
gene became transposed adjacent to one of the paralogues. Reduplication of this region then gave rise to TSP3 and TSP-4, adjacent to metaxin-1 and metaxin-3, respectively. However, this scenario puts the TSP-4-like/TSP-5
gene duplication before the TSP-4/TSP-3 gene duplication. This appears unlikely in view of : 1), the high identity
of the polypeptide encoded by the fish TSP-5 gene to TSP4, suggestive of a recent relationship; 2), similarly, paralogy between the genomic contexts of the human TSP-4
and TSP-5 genes is stronger than that between TSP-3 and
TSP-4; 3), the presence of a TSP-3-like TSP in the basal

chordate, Ciona intestinalis, (Ciona TSP-B [5], Gene Cluster
13925 [68]). Taking the genomic context and protein
sequence evidence together, a new model for the evolution of TSPs in vertebrates is proposed (Fig. 8).
Our studies also lead to the novel and surprising conclusion that the TSP-5/COMP protein sequence has evolved
to its current state as an innovation of tetrapods. In
human, mouse, chicken and X. tropicalis, TSP-4 and TSP-5
protein sequences are readily distinguished by BLAST
searches or multiple sequence alignment, even without
consideration of the presence or absence of the TSP
amino-terminal domain (e.g. [5,11]; Table 2). In contrast,
in fish, the proteins encoded at the TSP-5/COMP locus
have sequence character most similar to TSP-4, even when
the full-length sequence is used as the BLASTP query.
None of the invertebrate TSPs identified to date has TSP-5
character ([5,6,68]; our unpublished observations). Thus,
on the basis that the TSP-5 locus arose through duplication of an ancestral TSP-4-like gene, it appears that the
encoded protein retained TSP-4-like character in fish and
has evolved distinct and novel features in tetrapods. Given
the significant role of TSP-5/COMP in mammalian cartilage, it is tempting to speculate that the polypeptide
sequence evolved rapidly in tetrapods under the altered
selection pressures imposed on the bony endoskeleton by
the switch from aquatic swimming to terrestrial locomotion. Although it has been accepted that TSP-4 and TSP-5
have separate biological activities in mammals, there are
interesting hints of over-lap. For example, both TSP-4 and
TSP-5 are expressed in blood vessel walls [69,70]. In chick
embryos, TSP-4 is transiently expressed in cartilage in
association with the initial stages of osteogenesis [71].
Further consideration of similarities and differences in the
characteristics, regulation, and pathologies of TSP-4 and
TSP-5 may open fruitful novel directions for future
research.

Conclusion
Combining the approaches of molecular phylogeny and
phylogenomic analysis of chromosomal context is a generally applicable strategy to improve the identification of
orthologous relationships between members of complex
gene families across species. The identification of numerous fish TSPs and the discovery of the unexpectedly close
relationship between TSP-4 and TSP-5 raise fascinating
questions about the fundamental roles of TSPs in fish.
New directions are identified for studies of the pathophysiological roles of TSP-4 and TSP-5 in human disease.

Methods

(P35443) and TSP-5/COMP (P49747); from Mus musculus, TSP-1 (A40558); TSP-2 (Q03350); TSP-3 (U16175);
TSP-4 (AF152393); TSP-5/COMP (AF033530); from Gallus gallus, TSP-2 (L81165; 72), and from Danio rerio, TSP3 and TSP-4 (NP_775332 and NP_775333; [42]). Partial
sequences predicted from cDNA included G. gallus TSP-1
(U76994; [56]), TSP-3 (L81165; [56]) and TSP-4
(L27263; [71]).
Identification of novel TSPS in fully-sequenced genomes of
vertebrates and from expressed sequence tags
Human TSP-1 and TSP-5 were used as the query sequences
in TBLASTX or BLASTP searches carried out at NCBI and
UCSC Genome Bioinformatics portals against the fullysequenced genomes and, as available, the genome-predicted proteins of the fish Takifugu rubripes ([36]; assembly 3 with 5.7× coverage); Tetraodon nigroviridis ([37];
assembly 1.1 with 8.3× coverage); Danio rerio ([38] and
from August 2005, Zv5 with 5–7× coverage [39]); the
amphibian Xenopus tropicalis, ([40]; assembly 4.1, 7.65×
coverage, searched via DOE Joint Genome Institute), and
the bird Gallus gallus ([35]; assembly 1 with 6.6× coverage). Accession and scaffold numbers used in this article
are as of October 2005. Each matching sequence returned
with an expectation value less than e= 0.0001 was used to
query the GenBank non-redundant protein database, to
establish the assignment as a TSP and to identify which of
the mammalian TSPs 1–5 had the closest sequence identity. X. tropicalis sequences were also compared with available sequencs from Xenopus laevis : TSP-1 (P3544); TSP-3
(AAH48222) and TSP-4 (Z19091) [73]. Sequences were
also searched by TBLASTX against dbEST (database of
expressed sequence tags) at NCBI for ESTs from the corresponding organism, to establish the existence of transcribed sequences corresponding to the open reading
frame predicted from genomic DNA. In some cases, EST
sequences and comparisons with known TSPs were used
to extend or correct the genome-predicted sequences.
Searches of dbEST for TSP ESTs in other fish species were
carried out by limiting the query to the Entrez criteria
Chondrichthyes or Teleostomi. Taxonomic classifications
were based on the Tree of Life Project [74].
Analysis of domain architecture and oligomerization
potential of novel TSPs
The domain architecture of the predicted novel TSP proteins was evaluated by searches against the Conserved
Domain Database (CDD) database at NCBI [75], the Simple Modular architecture research tool (SMART) domain
database at EMBL [76], and the InterPro database [77] via
ExPasy [78], supplemented by manual inspection.
Sequences were assigned to TSP sub-group A if they contained a vWF-C domain and TSP type 1 repeats and to TSP
subgroup B if these domains were not present and the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/33

sequence included additional EGF-like domains [17].
Sequences were analyzed for the presence of a coiled-coil
region using the program COILS [79]. Although most
sequences in our set covered full-length TSPs, G. gallus
TSP-3 is at present identified only as a partial cDNA that
does not include the coiled-coils [56].
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic trees
Multiple sequence alignments of the coiled-coil domains
were prepared in TCOFFEE, that combines pairwise/global and local alignment methods into a single model [80].
Alignments of the sixth type 3 repeat or the C-terminal
region (i.e. the type 3 repeats and L-lectin domain) were
prepared by the progressive, neighborhood-joining alignment method, CLUSTALW [81]. The C-terminal region
was also aligned by the TCOFFEE algorithm. The multiple
sequence alignments are presented in Boxshade 3.2. For
preparation of phylogenetic trees, gaps due to variations
present in less than 10 % of the sequences were removed
from the alignments. Unrooted trees were constructed
either from the Phylip distance matrix output of the alignments in DRAWTREE, using UCSD Biology workbench 3
tools [82], or by the maximum-likelihood method,
PHYML, using the WAG substitution model and 100
bootstrap cycles [83]. Unrooted trees are presented in
D.G. Gilbert's Phylodendron, version 0.8d [84].
Identification of syntenic relationships
The chromosomal locations of TSP-encoding genes were
identified by TBLASTN searches of the physically-mapped
genomes of the human (build 35.1) [61], mouse (build
34.1), [85], and chicken (build 1.1) [41] through the
BLAST Genomes interface at NCBI, using in each case the
TSP protein sequences encoded within the genome of
interest as the queries. For each TSP gene in human,
mouse and chicken, local syntenic genes were identified
using the map viewer and Genemap Tables at NCBI. In the
case of Tetraodon nigroviridis, positions of TSP-encoding
genes were identified within the Genoscope physicallymapped shotgun scaffold sequences. This permitted their
assignment to a chromosome and identification of the
GenBank accession numbers for the neighboring predicted protein-coding sequences. The identification of
each predicted protein was then accomplished by BLASTP
searches of GenBank. Genomic locations and gene neighbors were also analyzed by BLAT search of the genome at
UCSC Genome Bioinformatics. In the case of Takifugu
rubripes, the predicted TSP protein sequences were
mapped onto the genomic scaffolds by TBLASTN
searches. Adjacent coding sequences on the scaffold were
then identified by BLASTX searches of GenBank proteins
and by viewing of genome-predicted proteins on the
genome contigs at UCSC Genome Bioinformatics. In the
case of D. rerio, initial identification of gene neighbors
was made from the NCBI Genemap Table of the 2004 Zv4
