model: mechanism for deficient glutamatergic
transmission?

Abstract
Astrocytes are fundamental for brain homeostasis and the progression and outcome of many neuropathologies
including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) generalised hippocampal
astroglia atrophy precedes a restricted and specific b-amyloid (Ab) plaque-related astrogliosis. Astrocytes are critical
for CNS glutamatergic transmission being the principal elements of glutamate homeostasis through maintaining its
synthesis, uptake and turnover via glutamate-glutamine shuttle. Glutamine synthetase (GS), which is specifically
expressed in astrocytes, forms glutamine by an ATP-dependent amination of glutamate. Here, we report changes
in GS astrocytic expression in two major cognitive areas of the hippocampus (the dentate gyrus, DG and the CA1)
in 3xTg-AD animals aged between 9 and 18 months. We found a significant reduction in Nv (number of cell/mm3)
of GS immunoreactive (GS-IR) astrocytes starting from 12 months (28.59%) of age in the DG, and sustained at 18
months (31.65%). CA1 decrease of GS-positive astrocytes Nv (33.26%) occurs at 18 months. This Nv reduction of GSIR astrocytes is paralleled by a decrease in overall GS expression (determined by its optical density) that becomes
significant at 18 months (21.61% and 19.68% in DG and CA1, respectively). GS-IR Nv changes are directly associated
with the presence of Ab deposits showing a decrease of 47.92% as opposed to 23.47% in areas free of Ab. These
changes in GS containing astrocytes and GS-immunoreactivity indicate AD-related impairments of glutamate
homeostatic system, at the advanced and late stages of the disease, which may affect the efficacy of glutamatergic
transmission in the diseased brain that may contribute to the cognitive deficiency.

Introduction
The central nervous system relies on astrocytes for its
correct functioning. Astroglia is critical for metabolic
support to neurones by providing glucose and lactate
[1,2], regulates ion environment, i.e. K+ and water movements and provides reactive-oxygen-species scavengers
like glutathione [3-5].

Astrocytes, as a component of the tripartite synapse,
modulate neurotransmission and control the extracellular level of neurotransmitters [6-11]. Therefore, astrocytes are essential for glutamatergic transmission being
key elements for “de novo“ synthesis of glutamate and
for the glutamate-glutamine cycle; which, in addition,
are fundamental for the synaptic plasticity associated to
cognitive processes [12,13]. The bulk of glutamate
release during neurotransmission is taken up by astroglia through Na + -dependent glutamate transporters
[9,14]. In astrocytes glutamate is converted to glutamine
by glutamine synthetase (GS) [9] (which is considered

astrocytic-specific enzyme although some recent studies
have shown some degree of oligodendroglial and microglial GS expression under some pathological situations
[15,16]). Subsequently, astrocytic glutamine is transported back to neurones for its further conversion into
glutamate [9,17]. Thus, the glutamate-glutamine shuttle
makes both astrocytes and GS essential for glutamatergic neurotransmission [18]. At the same time astrocytic
glutamate uptake prevents glutamate excitotoxicity [9];
disturbance of astroglial-based glutamate homeostasis
may lead to neurotransmitter imbalance, neuronal malfunction and death, as well as impaired cognition
[18,19].
Astroglia is fundamental for the onset, progression
and outcome of neuropathological processes by limiting
the damage and promoting the revascularisation of the
surrounding tissue through reactive astrogliosis [20-23]
and by contributing to neuroinflammation by release of
various pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukins
[24-26].
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a highly malignant neurodegenerative process characterised by anomalous intraneuronal and extracellular accumulation of b-amyloid
protein (Ab) [27] and hyperphosphorilated cytoskeletal
Tau protein in neurons [28]. As a consequence of this
anomalous protein formation and by a yet unknown
mechanism, severe loss of specific ACh neurons and
synapses appear at middle and advanced stages of the
disease [29]. As a result, the CNS reacts by both neuronal compensation and glial reactivity [30,31]. Recently,
in a GFAP based study, we have described that the associated reactive astrogliosis observed in the triple transgenic animal model (3xTg-AD) is preceded by a
generalized atrophy of astrocytes that occurs at the middle stages of the disease (9-12 months of age). Formation of the senile plaques triggers secondary astrogliosis
in astrocytes associated with Ab depositions, and the
later stages of the pathology are characterized by concomitant astroglial atrophy and astrogliosis that in any
case is not associated with astrocytic density alterations
(12-18 months of age) [32,33]. Furthermore, and even if
the two main pathological hallmarks have to be considered when studying AD, astrocytic involvement, as
recently demonstrated by us [32,33], is mainly related
with Ab pathology, since astrocytes modulate extracellular volume and components and Ab directly affects the
extracellular space, while tau pathology remains intraneuronal throughout AD [28].

Materials and methods
All animal procedures were carried out in accordance

Office. All efforts were made to reduce the number of
animals by following the 3R’s.
Mice

Experiments were performed on male 3xTg-AD mice,
which harbours the mutant genes for amyloid precursor
protein (APPSwe), for presenilin 1 PS1M146 V and for
tauP301 L [34,35] and their background-matching controls as described in detail previously [34-37].
Fixation and tissue processing

Animals of different age groups (9, 12 and 18 months;
n = 4-8) were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). Mice were
perfused through the aortic arch with 3.75% acrolein
(25 ml, TAAB, UK) in a solution of 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma, UK) and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) pH
7.4, followed by 2% paraformaldehyde (75 ml). Brains
were then removed and cut into 4 - 5 mm coronal
slabs of tissue consisting of the entire rostrocaudal
extent of the hippocampus, as described previously
[36]. The brain sections were post-fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and kept in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4.
Coronal sections of the brain were cut into 40 - 50 μm
thickness using a vibrating microtome (VT1000 S,
Leica, Milton Keynes, UK). Free floating brain sections
in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.4 were collected and stored in cryoprotectant solution containing 25% sucrose and 3.5%
glycerol in 0.05 M PB at pH 7.4. Coronal vibratome
sections at levels -1.58 mm/-2.46 mm (hippocampus)
posterior to Bregma, were selected for immunohistochemistry according to the mouse brain atlas of Paxinos and Franklin [38].
Antibodies

A mouse antiserum generated against GS (anti-GS;
Millipore, UK; MAB302) was used for the determination
of GS positive astrocytes. A rabbit anti-GFAP IgG fraction of antiserum (Sigma-Aldrich, UK; #G9269) was
used for the determination of glial cytoskeleton and
comparison to GS labelling distribution. A monoclonal
antibody against amyloid beta conjugated with alexa 488
(Convance, USA; SIG-39347) was employed to label
neuritic plaques. The immunolabelling pattern that we
obtained with these antibodies is equivalent to that
obtained previously [32,39] and their specificity has also
been previously demonstrated by western blot
[36,40-42]. To assess for non-specific background labelling or cross reactivity between antibodies derived from
different host species, a series of control experiments
were performed. Omission of primary and/or secondary
antibodies from the incubation solutions resulted in a
total absence of target labelling (data not shown).

Immunohistochemistry

To minimise methodological variability, sections
through the dorsal hippocampus containing both hemispheres of all animals were processed at the same time
using precisely the same experimental conditions. For
this procedure, the vibratome sections were first incubated for 30 min in 30% methanol in 0.1 M PB and 3%
hydrogenperoxide (Sigma, UK). Sections were rinsed
with 0.1 M PB for 5 mins and placed in 1% sodium borohydride (Aldrich, UK) for 30 minutes. Subsequently the
sections were washed with PB profusely before rinsing
in 0.1 M TS for 10 minutes. Brain sections were then
incubated with 0.5% albumin bovine serum (BSA,
Sigma, Dorset, UK) in 0.1 M TS and 0.25% Triton X100 (Sigma, Dorset, UK,) for 30 minutes. For the single
labelling, sections were incubated for 48 hours at room
temperature with primary antibody (mouse anti-GS,
1:500, cat# MAB302, Millipore, UK). The sections were
rinsed in 0.1 M TS for 30 minutes and incubated in
1:200 dilution of biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG
(Vector laboratories, Peterborough, UK) for 1 hour at
room temperature. Sections were rinsed in 0.1 M TS for
30 minutes, followed by incubation for 30 minutes in
avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (Vetor Laboratories
Ltd, Peterborough, UK). The peroxidase reaction product was visualized by incubation in a solution containing 0.022% of 3,3’diaminobenzidine (DAB, Aldrich,
Gilligham, UK) and 0.003% H 2 O 2 for 1.5 minutes as
described previously [36,37]. The reaction was stopped
by rinsing the tissue in 0.1 M TS for 6 minutes followed
by 0.1 M PB for 15 minutes. Brain sections were permanently mounted onto gelatinized slides. Sections were
then dehydrated in ascending concentration of ethanol
(50, 70, 80, 90, 95 and 100%) followed by xylene; and
then permanently coverslipped.
For dual immunofluorescence labelling, the sections
were incubated for 48 h at room temperature in primary
antibody cocktail containing: (1) mouse anti-GS (1:500)
and (2) rabbit anti-GFAP (1:30,000) simultaneously.
Subsequently, GS and GFAP were detected in a sequential manner on the same sections by incubation with
Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), respectively.
For triple immunofluorescence labelling, the sections
were incubated for 48 h at room temperature in primary
antibody cocktail containing: (1) mouse anti-GS (1:500)
and (2) rabbit anti-GFAP (1:30,000) simultaneously.
Subsequently, GS and GFAP were detected in a sequential manner on the same sections by incubation with
Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa
Fluor 633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), respectively. Then, the sections were washed in
0.1 M TS for 30 min and incubated in 0.5% BSA in 0.1

Page 3 of 9

M TS and 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes. Subsequently, sections were incubation in mouse anti-amyloid
beta Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (1:2000) for 20
hours at room temperature.
Finally, in both dual and triple immunoflorescence
labelling, sections were rinsed with 0.1 M TS for 30 min
and permanently mounted in an aqueous medium (Vectashield; Vector laboratories, Peterborough, UK).
GS positive cell count in hippocampus

We determined the numerical density (N v; #/mm3) of
GS positive astrocytes at 9, 12 and 18 months of age in
both 3xTg-AD and non-Tg mice in the DG and CA1
subfields of the hippocampus. For this, 3 - 4 representative non-consecutive coronal sections throughout the
dorsal hippocampus at levels -1.70/-2.18 [38] were
quantified accounting for an analyzed volume of
approximately 6,000,000 μm3 in the DG and 15,000,000
μm3 in CA1. The specific analysed areas were the molecular layer (MoL) in the DG and all the strata of the
CA1 apart from the pyramidal cell layer that is practically devoid of GS expression due to the dense packing
of pyramidal somata and almost no presence of astrocytic cell bodies. GS positive astrocytes were intensely
labelled against lighter background that made them easy
to identify with equal chance of being counted. A single
observer determined the number of GS positive astrocytes blindly; therefore, counting bias was kept to a
minimum.
Optical Density (OD) Measurement

Using computer-assisted imaging analysis (Image J 1.32j,
NIH, USA), we analyzed the expression and density of
GS labelling at 9, 12 and 18 months of age in both
3xTg-AD and non-Tg mice by measuring their optical
density (OD) as described previously [43]. Briefly, to
exclude any experimental errors and/or bias, all images
were taken at constant light intensity. Optical filters
were used to ensure the specificity of the signal
recorded by the camera. The staining was observed
throughout the thickness of the section (40 μm) using
light microscopy (Nikon Eclipse 80i). No differences
were observed in GS immunoreactivity throughout the
thickness of the section between 3xTg-AD and non-Tg
control animals; hence the changes in OD were used as
measure of increased GS expression. The OD was calculated from a relative scale of intensity ranging from 0 to
255, with readout of 250 corresponding to the area with
very low GS expression and 0 corresponding to the densest area of labelling. The calibration density was kept
constant for measuring all section to avoid experimental
variances. Sections background OD was determined
from the corpus callosum (CC) that was considered as
blank since GS labelling in the CC is virtually absent.

Olabarria et al. Molecular Neurodegeneration 2011, 6:55

GS density of the entire DG MoL and CA1 (with the
exception of the pyramidal cell layer) were measured
independently and a single measurement was obtained
from every sub-region in each hemisphere. To analyze
the change in GS density against constant control, the
255 was divided by control region (CC) and the
obtained factor was multiplied by the region of interest
in every given section. Inverse optical density was
obtained by subtracting from the obtained background
level (set at 255). Measurement of mean density were
taken and averaged, after background subtraction, from
each hippocampal layers in both the left and the right
hemisphere of each slice. The results are shown as
inverse GS density (IOD/pixel).
GS and GFAP positive cell count in relation to Ab plaques
in CA1

Triple labelling pictures of the CA1 at 18 months of age
in both 3xTg-AD and non-Tg mice were taken using
confocal scanning microscopy (Leica SP2, inverted),
recording layers at every 0.5 μm. Both GS and GFAP
positive cells were counted separately and taking in to
account their localisation regarding Ab plaques. We
considered all cells with the somata within 50 μm from
the plaque border of the plaque-associated, and cell with
somata positioned more distantly as cells not associated
with plaques.

Statistical analysis

Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Unpaired t-tests
were used to examine differences between 3xTg-AD
and non-Tg animals at different time points and differences between away and around conditions in 3xTgAD. Significance was accepted at p ≤ 0.05. The data
were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software).

Results
GS immunoreactive (GS-IR) astrocytes were widely distributed throughout the subdivisions of the hippocampus in both non-Tg and 3xTg-AD mice. This
distribution was similar to the GFAP immunoreactivity
in both DG and CA1 (Figure 1C, E, G, 2A). GS-IR
astrocytes show typical protoplasmic morphology characterized by small round cell bodies with few primary
and several secondary processes extending radially in
random fashion. GFAP-IR astrocytes were characterised
by primary and secondary cytoskeleton processes
extending radially from the cell body and frequently colocalising with GS-IR main processes. (Figure 1A, B, D,
F, H). However, and differently to GFAP-positive astrocytes, GS-IR astrocytes showed a clear and profuse
labelling not only in the cell body and primary processes
but also throughout the fine and thin distal processes
(Figure 1A, D, 3C-F).

significantly higher in the advanced age (18 months,
16.34%, p = 0.046; Figure 4A, B).
Nv of GS-IR astrocytes decreases in 3xTg-AD mice

From 12 months of age the 3xTg-AD mice showed a
significant reduction of the Nv of GS-IR cells in the DG
(4,852 ± 306 cells/mm 3 vs 3,465 ± 344 cells/mm 3 ;
28.59%, p = 0.016; Figure 3A) compared to the non-Tg
control animals, whereas no apparent difference was
found in CA1. At 18 months of age the decrease in GSIR cell Nv was significant in both the DG (5,064 ± 511
cells/mm3 vs 3,462 ± 321 cells/mm3; 31.65%, p = 0.036)
and in the CA1 (10,727 ± 1083 cells/mm 3 vs 7,159 ±
400.78 cells/mm3; 33.26%, p = 0.026; Figure 2, 3C-3F).
3xTg-AD mice exhibit a decrease in GS expression

In parallel to the decrease in the Nv of GS-IR cells, we
observed a decrease in the expression of GS in the hippocampus with no apparent regional differences, as
shown by the decrease of the inverse optical density
(IOD; Figure 4). The 3xTg-AD mice, when compared to
non-Tg controls, showed a significantly decreased GS
expression in both DG (66 ± 3 vs 52 ± 4; 21.62%; p <
0.05) and CA1 (57 ± 2 vs 46 ± 2; 19.69%; p = 0.010) at
18 months of age (Figure 4), but not at the earlier ages
(Figure 4A, B).
Nv of GS-IR astrocytes decrease in 3xTg-AD mice is
associated, although no exclusive, with Ab plaques

(red) labelling in the hippocampus of either control (A) or
3xTg-AD mice (B). Majority of astrocytes co-express (yellow) GFAP
and GS in control mice, whilst some of GFAP positive astrocytes of
the 3xTg-AD mice fail to express GS (arrows).

GS immunoreactivity in non-Tg animals

In non-Tg animals, GS-IR showed a uniform pattern in
the DG and in the CA1 being constant at all age
groups. The GS-IR N v at all ages was significantly
lower in the DG compared to the CA1 (5,599 ± 603
cells/mm 3 vs. 9,700 ± 1,041 cells/mm 3 , 42.27%, p =
0.009; 4,852 ± 306 cells/mm3 vs. 10,456 ± 1,788 cells/
mm 3 , 53.59%, p = 0.021; 5,064 ± 511 cells/mm 3 vs.
10,727 ± 1,083 cells/mm3 , 52.78%, p = 0.001; at 9, 12
and 18 months respectively; Figure 3A, B). The overall
GS-IR, as determined by the IOD, was slightly higher
in the DG at 9 and 12 months of age when compared
to CA1 (10.67% and 14.38%); but just being

GS-IR decrease was not homogenous throughout the
CA1 parenchyma in 3xTg-AD. GS-IR Nv was compared
with GFAP-IR Nv in either the vicinity or distant of Ab
plaques in 3xTg-AD at 18 months of age, to asses
whether GS expression changes were related to Ab plaques. No GFAP-IR Nv related changes were observed in
any of the conditions (Figure 5). However, GS-IR astrocyte Nv was significantly diminished in CA1 areas free
of Ab (10,069 ± 572 cells/mm 3 vs 7,704 ± 558 cells/
mm3; 23.49%, p = 0.010) when compared to GFAP-IR
N v density in same areas, being this reduction more
patent in the vicinities of neuritic plaques (10,314 ± 922
cells/mm3 vs 5,338 ± 685cells/mm3; 48.24%, p = 0.002).
In addition, GS-IR Nv associated to neuritic plaques was
significantly lower to GS-IR Nv away from Ab deposits
(by 24.24%, p = 0.022).
GS-IR and GFAP-IR Nv was almost identical in nonTg controls, showing 99.22% of co-localisation (data not
shown).

Discussion
In the present study we analysed the functional status of
astroglia in the triple transgenic AD animal model by
determining the expression of the GS at different ages.
Our results in this animal model demonstrate that the

expression of astroglial GS in hippocampus is affected at
the human equivalent advanced and late stages of AD,
as indicated by a reduction in both the N v of GS-IR
astrocytes and GS expression (as determined by IOD) in
the 3xTg-AD when compared to the control animals.
These changes in Nv appear in both DG and CA1, albeit
they initially occur in the DG at 12 months of age. Such
reduction becomes more evident in the surroundings of
Ab plaques at 18 months of age. The GS expression is
also decreased in the 3xTg-AD in both DG and CA1
but at a later age (18 months).
Astrocytes are known to be involved in most neurological diseases including AD [20,22,33]. AD is characterised by a profound cognitive impairment due to a
severe loss of synapses and neurones; which is generally
believed to be associated with reactive astrogliosis

Page 7 of 9

[28,44]. Our recent studies in the 3xTg-AD animal
model, however, have found a more complex astroglial
reactions in the late stages; which might show a similar
pattern during human AD progression. At the early
stages of the pathology astrocytes undergo generalised
atrophy and down-regulation of GFAP expression,
which may indicate early compromise of astrocytic
homeostatic functions [23,32,33]. Several studies have
previously described that GFAP abnormalities are associated with impaired glutamate homeostasis [45-48]. In
a hypoxic animal model, astrocytes in the affected areas
showed an abnormal GFAP cytoskeleton characterised
with very short processes; which was associated with
redistribution of GFAP and GLAST to the cell body,
suggesting an impaired glutamate homeostasis [45]. In
addition, in GFAP knock-out mice, the lack of GFAP
compromised the trafficking of the GLT-1 to the cell
membrane, affecting glutamate uptake [46]. Furthermore, “in vitro“ studies have shown an inverse correlation between astroglial expression of GFAP and GS [48].
Recently has been demonstrated that, as opposed to
what was thought, 3xTg-AD model shows some degree
of neuronal loss as a consequence of the pathological
burden [49], strengthening the relevance of this AD
model and allowing the comprehension of many
described synapse-related pathological events like the
current one.
Studies in AD brains have shown a decrease of cortical astrocytic GS expression [50,51] that is accompanied
by a “de novo“ neuronal expression of GS as a compensatory reaction [51,52]. This direct effect on astrocytic
GS expression is also present in other neurodegenerative
diseases, such as Huntington’s disease, which is associated with GLT-1 glutamate transporter down-regulation [53,54]. Further studies show that GS is oxidized
due to Ab in AD brains causing reduction of enzymatic
activity [55] and that GS reduced expression is related
to neuritic plaques in AD brain cortex [51]. On the contrary, human studies have shown increased levels of GS
immunoreactivity in the prefrontal cortex in AD brains
[56]. Obviously, phylogenetic proximity, tissue preservation and medical history play crucial role in the interpretation of human vs rodent data. Our current work
shows that astrocytes at the late stages (plaque formation and stabilisation, 12-18 months) of AD-like pathology, in agreement with the above-mentioned studies, are
functionally compromised as shown by the reduction of
GS expression and therefore their capability to master
the glutamate-glutamine cycle.
Thus, we could hypothesise that astrocytes fail to support neurones and control synapses from the appearance of the disease pathological burden. Furthermore,
and considering astrocytic physiological function, one
could consider that these changes result in an impaired

Olabarria et al. Molecular Neurodegeneration 2011, 6:55
http://www.molecularneurodegeneration.com/content/6/1/55

glutamate homeostasis that is manifested by deficient
glutamate/glutamine turnover and restricted supply of
glutamine to neurones, being this failure somehow more
dramatic in the proximities of Ab plaques. Furthermore,
GS deficiency could also be a consequence of impaired
astrogial glutamate uptake; inducing a potential neurotoxic process by abnormal glutamate metabolism. Hence
GS deficiency may reflect an altered glutamatergic neurotransmission of AD, at the advanced and late stages of
the disease, which can account for a global hippocampal
neurotransmitter imbalance underlaying the mnesic and
cognitive impairments observed in the disease.
