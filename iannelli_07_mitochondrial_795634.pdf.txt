Abstract
Background: Within Chordata, the subphyla Vertebrata and Cephalochordata (lancelets) are
characterized by a remarkable stability of the mitochondrial (mt) genome, with constancy of gene
content and almost invariant gene order, whereas the limited mitochondrial data on the subphylum
Tunicata suggest frequent and extensive gene rearrangements, observed also within ascidians of the
same genus.
Results: To confirm this evolutionary trend and to better understand the evolutionary dynamics
of the mitochondrial genome in Tunicata Ascidiacea, we have sequenced and characterized the
complete mt genome of two congeneric ascidian species, Phallusia mammillata and Phallusia fumigata
(Phlebobranchiata, Ascidiidae). The two mtDNAs are surprisingly rearranged, both with respect to
one another and relative to those of other tunicates and chordates, with gene rearrangements
affecting both protein-coding and tRNA genes. The new data highlight the extraordinary variability
of ascidian mt genome in base composition, tRNA secondary structure, tRNA gene content, and
non-coding regions (number, size, sequence and location). Indeed, both Phallusia genomes lack the
trnD gene, show loss/acquisition of DHU-arm in two tRNAs, and have a G+C content two-fold
higher than other ascidians. Moreover, the mt genome of P. fumigata presents two identical copies
of trnI, an extra tRNA gene with uncertain amino acid specificity, and four almost identical sequence
regions. In addition, a truncated cytochrome b, lacking a C-terminal tail that commonly protrudes
into the mt matrix, has been identified as a new mt feature probably shared by all tunicates.
Conclusion: The frequent occurrence of major gene order rearrangements in ascidians both at
high taxonomic level and within the same genus makes this taxon an excellent model to study the
mechanisms of gene rearrangement, and renders the mt genome an invaluable phylogenetic marker
to investigate molecular biodiversity and speciation events in this largely unexplored group of basal
chordates.

Background
The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is considered a
model system for studying genome evolution, and a good
molecular marker to reconstruct the phylogeny of Metazoa, both at high and low taxonomic level. In general,
evolutionary genomics and phylogenetic studies are
strictly related, because the understanding of the evolutionary peculiarities of a given character greatly facilitates
the evaluation of its suitability as phylogenetic marker.
For phylogenetic purposes, the mitochondrial sequences
of single or multiple genes or regions are commonly analysed by traditional molecular evolutionary methods.
However, besides the sequence itself, genome-level features have been proposed as powerful phylogenetic characters [1]. Gene arrangement, gene content, tRNA
secondary structures, and changes in genetic code are all
mitochondrial genome-level characters, used to clarify
some controversial phylogenetic relationships, especially
at high taxonomic levels. However, the phylogenetic reliability of these characters needs to be investigated more in
detail, considering the variability of the mitochondrial
genome in metazoans.
The mtDNA of Metazoa is a small circular genome, of
around 14–16 kb in length, characterized by a compact
structure with no introns and short intergenic regions.
Only one large non-coding region is typically present in
the genome and is known as the control region (CR),
because it is assumed that elements controlling replication and transcription of the genome are located in this
region, although functional studies have been carried out
only in vertebrates and a few other species [2-4]. In most
invertebrate mtDNAs where only short non-coding
regions are present, the CR has sometimes been tentatively identified through the presence of repeated
sequences, secondary structures, or a strong compositional bias, because these features are often associated
with the control region [5,6]. The mt gene content is
extremely conserved and typically consists of 37 genes
encoding two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins, all of
which are components of the respiratory chain complexes. Variations in gene content are rarely due to
changes in the protein-coding gene complement, and
mostly concern changes in the content of tRNA genes.
Indeed, only the atp8 gene, encoding for subunit 8 of ATP
synthase, is lost in Platyhelminthes [7], and in most mollusc Bivalvia [8] and Nematoda [9]. On the contrary, drastic changes in tRNA gene number are related to the usage
of a modified genetic code [10,11] or are restricted to specific taxonomic groups. Thus, the mtDNA of Cnidaria
encodes only for one or two tRNAs (tRNA-Met and/or Trp) [12,13], whereas the mtDNA of Porifera usually
present extra and/or duplicated tRNAs in variable
number, but can also have an incomplete tRNA set
[14,15]. In addition, the loss or duplication of one or few

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/155

tRNA genes occurs sporadically in many taxa, sometimes
associated with changes in gene order. Mitochondrial
gene arrangement varies both across phyla and within a
given phylum, and exhibits a high degree of variability in
invertebrates [16], while the vertebrate gene order is
almost frozen and highly similar to that of lancelets
(Cephalochordata) [17]. Extensive gene rearrangements
have been observed in Mollusca [5], Nematoda [18], and
some arthropod lineages such as hemipteroid insects
[19,20] and several parasitic groups [20-23]. Although
gene order is generally conserved at low taxonomic levels,
such as within a genus or a family, exceptions have been
reported in the most diverse taxonomic groups, even
those commonly characterized by a stable gene order. For
example, within Vertebrata, salamanders of the family
Plethodontidae show extensive gene rearrangements,
moreover the presence of pseudogenes and additional
gene copies testifies to ancient duplications of large mt
regions [24]. Similarly, lancelets of the genus Epigonichthys
shows an inversion and several gene translocations,
explained by recombination and tandem duplications,
respectively [17]. Genome rearrangements at intra-genus
level have been observed in Mollusca and Arthropoda,
such as in marine gastropods of the genus Dendropoma
[25], bivalves of the genus Crassostrea [26], and even
between gender-specific mtDNAs of bivalves with doubly
uniparental inheritance (DUI). In particular, the extent of
rearrangements in DUI mitotypes ranges from several
gene inversions, duplications and transpositions in Inversidens japanensis, to an almost-identical or identical gene
order in Tapes philippinarum and Mytilus galloprovincialis
[27,28]. Among arthropods, chigger mites of the genus
Leptotrombidium (Acari) show translocation of a tRNA
gene and duplications of non-coding and rRNA
sequences, in addition to an overall gene order drastically
different from the arthropod ancestral gene order [29].
Finally, parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma
exhibit extensive rearrangements due to translocations of
protein-coding and tRNA genes [30,31].
The investigation of gene rearrangements in closely
related species, such as congeneric species, can be
extremely useful to discover the mechanisms underlying
gene order variability, as it allows the observation of
recent rearrangements and even the identification of intermediary stages of the process itself. To date, the mtDNA of
more than 1000 metazoan species has been sequenced
but the taxon sampling is highly biased towards vertebrates and arthropods (771 and 133 species, respectively),
with few or no complete genome sequences available for
many taxonomic groups (GenEmbl, July 2007). The availability of congeneric mt genomes is also extremely limited. Within Tunicata, traditionally considered the basal
subphylum of Chordata (but see also [32]), the mtDNA
has been completely sequenced only in one representative

of the class Thaliacea (Doliolum nationalis) and four representatives of the class Ascidiacea, including three species
of the genus Ciona. Surprisingly, substantial gene rearrangements have been observed within the genus Ciona
[33], and have significantly contributed to demonstrate
the existence of two cryptic species in Ciona intestinalis
[34]. Moreover, ascidian mt genomes show several unusual features compared to other chordates, such as a modified genetic code [10], a fast nucleotide substitution rate
[35,36], a gene order extremely rearranged compared to
other chordates and metazoans [33,36], the presence of
two distinct tRNA-Met genes [37], and the absence of a
discernible control region [33]. These features suggest that
further investigations on tunicate mtDNA should be of
interest. Indeed, the highly variable gene order observed
even at intra-genus level in the currently limited tunicate
sample suggests that this taxon may be a good model for
the investigation of mechanisms of genome rearrangement. Moreover, the unexpected evolutionary dynamics
of the mtDNA of tunicates suggests caution in the usage of
this molecule to reconstruct the phylogeny of Chordata,
which is in turn a prerequisite to understand the origin of
Vertebrata [32]. As first step to verify the reliability of tunicate mtDNA as phylogenetic marker in chordates, it is fundamental to increase the number of available sequences.
To investigate the variability of ascidian mtDNA at low
taxonomic levels, we have sequenced the complete
mtDNA of the two congeneric ascidians Phallusia fumigata
and Phallusia mammillata, and carried out detailed comparisons of the structural and evolutionary features of
ascidian mtDNAs at the intra-genus level. The Phallusia
genus was chosen for this study as it belongs to the same
order as Ciona (order Phlebobranchiata) but to a different
family (Ascidiidae versus Cionidae), thus the divergence
between these organisms is adequate to confirm whether
the intra-genus evolutionary dynamics observed in Ciona
are a common ascidian trait.

Results and discussion
Gene content
The mitochondrial genome of both Phallusia species contains the canonical set of two rRNA genes (rrnS and rrnL)
and 13 protein-coding genes, including the atp8 gene previously considered absent in tunicates [35]. The complement of tRNA genes is unusual, being different between
the two congeneric species and with respect to other ascidians. In accordance with the tunicate mt genetic code
[10,35], two tRNA genes for Leu, Ser, and Gly codons have
been identified. In addition, tunicate mtDNAs specify two
tRNA-Met, one with the common 5'-CAU-3' and the other
with the unusual 5'-UAU-3' anticodon, thus the canonical
tRNA set for tunicates consists of 24 tRNAs [33,37]. Both
tRNA-Met genes have been found in Phallusia mtDNAs,
confirming the hypothesis that this is a general feature of
ascidian mtDNA. However, the tRNA-Asp gene (trnD) is
lost in both genomes, and in P. fumigata two extra tRNA
genes have been identified: an additional gene for tRNAIle (trnI-2), and a trnX gene that can be folded into two
alternative cloverleaf structures showing different anticodons (see paragraph on tRNA genes). The two copies of
trnI are almost identical, a situation similar to that found
in the mtDNA of the distantly related species Halocynthia
roretzi, where there are two almost identical copies of trnF
[38]. In conclusion, 23 tRNA genes are present in the
mtDNA of P. mammillata, and 25 in P. fumigata.
Genome size and compactness
The mtDNAs of P. mammillata and P. fumigata are 14579
and 15535 bp long respectively, which is consistent with
the typical size of chordate mt genomes. Surprisingly, the
mtDNA of P. mammillata is 6.5% (956 bp) shorter than
that of P. fumigata, a somewhat unexpected observation
give the almost identical size of the mtDNA of the three
Ciona species (maximum difference: 1.4% – 199 bp –
between C. intestinalis sp. A and sp. B).

The more compact structure of the P. mammillata mtDNA
compared to P. fumigata is highlighted not only by the
smaller genome size but also by the higher number/perTable 1: Statistics on gene overlaps of ascidian mitochondrial genomes

centage of gene overlaps, and the lower percentage of noncoding (NC) sequences. As reported in Table 1, overlapping gene pairs account for 44 bp in P. mammillata, and 23
bp in P. fumigata (0.30 against 0.15% of the total
genome). Thus, there are six and three overlapping gene
pairs in P. mammillata and P. fumigata, respectively, with
only two overlapping gene pairs common to both species
(cox2-cob and trnL(CUN)-trnT). In parallel, the percentage
of NC sequences is quite low in the more compact
mtDNA of P. mammillata (1.94%) and higher in P. fumigata (5.89%) (Table 2). Distinct from the Phallusia genus,
the three species of Ciona reveal almost identical values of
gene overlap (Table 1), and a notably lower %NC only in
C. intestinalis sp. B (Table 2) [34]. Overall, the involvement of both NC total size and gene overlaps in the determination of mtDNA compactness is demonstrated by the
highly significant negative correlation between these
parameters in a comparative analysis between all the
ascidian mtDNAs (r = 0.9).
In conclusion, different evolutionary trends toward compactness have shaped the mtDNAs of the Phallusia genus,
giving rise to substantial differences in genome size
between P. mammillata and P. fumigata. By way of contrast, the compactness is almost the same in the three
mtDNAs of the genus Ciona, where mtDNA size variability
is mainly due to differences in NC size [34].
Non-coding regions
No single non-coding region comparable in size to the
control region of vertebrates is found in the mtDNA of the
two Phallusia species.

NC sequences constitute 21–25 short intergenic regions
(L < 200 bp), and the NC size distribution is quite different between the two species (Table 2). Indeed, five NC
longer than 100 bp are present in P. fumigata but none in
P. mammillata. Moreover, variability in NC size distribution is common to all other analysed ascidians (Table 2).
The largest NC region is more than two times longer in P.

fumigata compared to P. mammillata, as observed in C.
savignyi compared to the two C. intestinalis species (Table
2).
The position of NC regions longer than40 bp is not conserved in ascidians. Indeed, only one NC region is located
exactly in the same position in the two Phallusia species
(NC region between trnC-nad4L). Similarly, only one NC
region is located in a similar but not identical position in
the three available Ciona species (NC region downstream
nad1).
No significant sequence similarity has been found
between NC sequences of the two Phallusia species, neither between any of these NC and those of other ascidians.
Sequence similarities between NC of the same mtDNA
have been found only in P. fumigata (see Figure 1, where
NC are named according to their size). In particular, the
block NC(123 bp)-trnI2-NC(125 bp) shows a 95% identity over 208 bp to the block NC(109 bp)-trnI1-rrnS(first
38 bp), including an identical sequence 165 bp long (Figure 2). The NC(134 bp) located between cox1 and
trnG(GGN) contains a sequence 29 bp-long duplicated in
the region downstream nad1 (Figure 3). Moreover, this 29
bp-long sequence constitutes a repeat located upstream
and downstream of the gene pair trnG(GGN)-nad1, similarly to the situation found in C. intestinalis sp. A, where a
completely different sequence, 25 bp-long, flanks the
gene pair trnK-nad1 [33]. Thus, in both C. intestinalis sp. A
and P. fumigata, a completely different duplicated
sequence is located upstream and downstream a gene pair
including a tRNA gene (trnK or trnG-GGN) and nad1.
These sequences can be explained as remnants of gene
rearrangement events involving nad1 and occurred independently in the two species, or as sequences that promoted the rearrangement event. Alternatively, they could
also be unknown functional sequences involved in the
regulation of nad1 expression.

according to the transported amino acid, except for: G1: Gly(AGR); G2: Gly(GGN); L1: Leu(UUR); L2: Leu(CUN); M1:
Met(AUG); M2: Met(AUA); S1: Ser(AGY); S2: Ser(UCN). Diamond: trnX gene of P. fumigata. Star: intra-genome duplicated
genes, that is trnI genes in P. fumigata (named I1 and I2), and trnF in Halocynthia roretzi. Feature table of Halocynthia roretzi
mtDNA is as reported in [38].
Additional elements characterize the long NC regions of
P. fumigata: two palindromes 8 bp long are found in the
NC upstream of the duplicated trnI genes (see Figure 2); a
tRNA-like secondary structure, with sequence similarity to
the beginning of tRNA-Pro, has been found in the NC-134
bp (Figure 3). It is striking that palindromes or tRNA-like
structures have often been identified in the control region
of metazoans, which suggests they may be involved in the
mt replication or transcription processes.
In conclusion, NC regions appear highly variable in
number, size, sequence and location in the Phallusia as in
the Ciona genus suggesting that a high variability in NC is
quite common between closely related ascidian species.
The extensive reorganization of NC regions could partially
be related to the extensive changes in gene order, indeed a
process of "duplication-random gene loss" can generate

NC fossil sequences, as remnants of duplicated genes
erased by evolution.
Gene order
In both Phallusia species all genes are transcribed from the
same strand, as in other tunicates so far studied.

Gene order is extremely rearranged between P. mammillata
and P. fumigata: only nine gene blocks, including about
half of the total mitochondrial genes, are conserved in
both species, and the largest of these blocks consists of
only three genes (Figure 1). The breakpoint analysis confirms this observation (Table 3), as the relative breakpoint
distance is very high and quite close to the value expected
for random permutations (0.99). Moreover, gene rearrangements are not due to a high mobility of tRNA genes,
indeed omitting the tRNAs the relative breakpoint distance between Phallusia species increases (Table 3) and

Gene abbreviations are as in the main text. Non-coding regions are named according to their length (in bp). Underlined
sequences indicate inverted repeats.

only two gene blocks appear conserved (nad2-nad4L-cox3,
and the previously identified cox2-cob gene pair, accounting for one-third of non-tRNA genes).
Gene rearrangements in the Phallusia appear to be more
extensive than those observed in the Ciona and in other
congeneric protochordate pairs (Table 3). As reported in
Figure 1, only the tRNA-Cys gene (trnC) is translocated in
C. intestinalis sp. A compared to C. intestinalis sp. B [34],
whereas between C. intestinalis sp. A and C. savignyi there
are six translocated genes (nad1 and five tRNA genes) [33].
Thus, the ancestral gene order state could be reconstructed
quite easily for the Ciona genus but not for Phallusia,
where several duplication/transposition steps will be
required to relate the two gene orders. On the contrary,
gene order is almost invariant in lancelets (Table 3), with
translocations and inversions found only in the genus
Epigonichthys, specifically only in E. lucayanus compared to
all other lancelets studied [17].
Gene order comparisons among all tunicate mtDNAs,
both with and without tRNA genes, do not identify large
gene blocks shared by most species. Thus, including all

genes, only cox2-cob is conserved in all tunicates, probably
because of the ORF overlap (see below), and trnR-trnQ is
conserved in almost all ascidians except for P. mammillata
(Figure 1). Excluding tRNA genes, no additional or largest
gene blocks appear conserved in all tunicates or ascidians,
and only nad4L-cox3 is shared by the order Phlebobranchiata (i.e. Ciona and Phallusia genera).
The absence of a consensus gene order for ascidian
mtDNA complicates comparisons with the almost frozen
gene order of vertebrates and cephalochordates [16,17].
The few instances of gene blocks shared by tunicates and
other-chordates appear due to fortuitous similarities,
rather than to a common evolutionary origin, as indicated
by their presence in only one or few tunicates. For example, the trnV-rrnL gene pair is shared by vertebrates, cephalochordates, and Phallusia species (Phlebobranchiata),
but it is absent in all remaining tunicates including other
phlebobranches of the genus Ciona (see Figure 1). Similarly, the gene block rrnS-trnV-rrnL is shared only by vertebrates and P. fumigata. Although these gene blocks are
quite primitive, as indicated by their presence even in
other deuterostomes, their occurrence only in the Phallu-

sia genus among all tunicates suggests that this may be the
result of multiple gene rearrangements, rather than the
remnant of a primitive gene order.
Although complete mtDNA sequences are still underrepresented for ascidians, it is evident that gene rearrangements are frequent in this group, and quite common at

low taxonomic levels at least in the order Phlebobranchiata. It should be verified if intra-genus rearrangements are
frequent even in ascidians belonging to the remaining
orders of Stolidobranchiata and Aplousobranchiata. The
evolutionary trend of ascidians toward gene rearrangements is completely different from other chordates, and
even from other metazoans. In most metazoans, mito-

chondrial gene order has been demonstrated to evolve in
a non-clocklike, saltatory manner, and changes are commonly described as rare, unique events unlikely to be subjected to reversion or convergent evolution [1,16,39].
Therefore, this genome-level character has been considered highly reliable as a phylogenetic marker (review in
[1]). In ascidians, the frequent gene rearrangements could
impair the reliability of this feature as a phylogenetic
marker. This high frequency of rearrangement could also
imply differences in the ascidian gene rearrangement
mechanisms compared to other metazoans. Gene rearrangements are commonly explained by a process of "tandem duplication-random gene loss" [40], assuming that
duplicated portions of the mtDNA can be generated by
several processes, and that supernumerary copies of each
gene will be selected at random to be subsequently eliminated [41]. A few cases of mt gene rearrangements have
been explained by different mechanisms, such as a tandem duplication process followed by non-random gene
loss based on gene transcriptional polarities, suggesting
that functional constraints could overcome the random
process of gene loss [42]. Finally, intra- and inter-genome
illegitimate recombination has also been observed [43],
or hypothesized [44] in organisms such as nematodes and
mites. As simple speculation, the high frequency of rearrangements in ascidians could be due to a completely different mechanism, or to the exacerbation of one of the
previously hypothesized mechanisms (i.e. due to an
increased activity of enzymes already involved in the process or due to the acquisition of new enzymatic activities).
The "duplication-random gene loss" model does not fit
well the gene rearrangements of the Phallusia genus,
because a large number of gene movements are required
to explain the observed gene order, however it is still compatible with the situation found in the Ciona. Thus, the
high frequency of gene rearrangements observed in ascidians could be partially related to the existence of long
divergence times between morphologically closely related
species. Moreover, the absence of data on the replication
process and the location of control region in ascidian
mtDNA prevents further speculations on the rearrangement process. Indeed, in most metazoan mtDNAs the replication origins act as hot spots for gene rearrangements
[16], suggesting that components of the replication
machinery are involved in the step of segmental duplication.
Sequence divergence
Table 3 reports the sequence divergence between the two
Phallusia species and other congeneric pairs of protochordates, calculated separately for rRNA genes, synonymous
(dS) and nonsynonymous sites (dN) of protein-coding
genes, and amino acid sequences. As expected, dN values
and percentage of amino acid identity are negatively correlated (r = 0.98), and a strong positive correlation is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/155

observed between dN and rRNA sequence divergence (r =
0.97 and 0.88 for rrnS and rrnL, respectively), indicating
that different mt genes follow the same evolutionary
trends. Synonymous substitutions appear saturated in all
intra-genus comparisons, as indicated by dS values higher
than one (Table 3). Both nonsynonymous sites and rRNA
genes indicate a sequence divergence between P. mammillata – P. fumigata highly similar to that observed between
lancelets E. lucayanus – E. maldivensis, and in comparisons
between C. intestinalis – C. savignyi. Assuming a constant
evolutionary rate, a similar divergence time can be
inferred for the above-mentioned species pairs, whereas a
more recent divergence can be hypothesized for the species pair C. intestinalis sp. A – C. intestinalis sp. B, which
shows the lowest dN and rRNA divergence values (Table
3).
In the protochordate sample here analysed, there is no statistically significant correlation between the relative
breakpoint distance and the evolutionary rate of rRNA or
protein-coding genes, although in arthropods a general
correlation between the rate of genome rearrangement
and the rate of nucleotide substitution has been found
[5,45]. However in our small sample, species pairs with
the highest gene rearrangements also exhibit the highest
sequence divergence in both Cephalochordata and Ascidiacea (Table 3).
Considering the single mitochondrial-encoded proteins,
COX1 is the most conserved protein (93.8% identity in
Phallusia), whereas ATP8, NAD6 and NAD2 are among
the less conserved proteins in all analysed ascidians
(NAD6 is the least conserved protein in Phallusia, with
45.1% identity).
Base composition
As reported in Table 4, the G+C content of P. mammillata
and P. fumigata mtDNAs is significantly higher than that
of other ascidians (average values 46.9 ± 0.2% in Phallusia,
and 24.8 ± 4.7 in other ascidians). The trend toward a GCrich genome is even more pronounced at the third codon
position (P3) of protein-coding genes, where the G+C
content is 51.5 ± 1.1% in Phallusia and 15.8 ± 5.9% in
remaining ascidians. This high G+C content is due to the
strong increase of G in Phallusia compared to remaining
species (Table 4). Indeed, in other ascidians the most
common base is T, and the T/G ratio is always higher than
one, ranging from 2.4 to 8.2 in P3. On the contrary, in
both Phallusia species the G content is almost as high as
the T content, thus the T/G ratio is close to one and
becomes lower than one at P3 in P. fumigata. At intragenus level, base composition is constant in Phallusia and
quite variable in Ciona, as shown by the standard deviation of the average GC content calculated on P3 in intra-

genus comparisons (51.5 ± 1.1% in the Phallusia genus
and 13 ± 2.5% in the Ciona genus).
An asymmetric distribution of complementary bases
between the two strands is observed in all ascidians: on
the coding strand, the GC-skew is positive and the ATskew is negative, with absolute values of both skews quite
low in most species (Table 4). Surprisingly, the compositional asymmetry can be different even between species
with a similar G+C content. Indeed, in the Phallusia genus
the GC-skew at P3 is quite different between the two species (0.13 and 0.36), although the G+C content is almost
the same (see Table 4).
The high variability of base composition in ascidians has
a strong influence on synonymous codon usage and even
on amino acid composition of mitochondrial proteins.
Thus, leucine is the most abundant amino acid in ascidians (average 15.1% ± 0.7%) as in other metazoan mt proteins but the usage of the two codon families (CTN and
TTR) is very different between ascidian species (see standard deviation: CTN = 4.8% ± 3.4%; TTR = 10.2% ± 2.9%).
Similarly, AGR and GGN glycine codon families are used
differently between species (see standard deviation: GGN
= 6.2% ± 4.8%; AGR = 4.7% ± 2.1%), as consequence of
the different G content. Strong differences in amino acid
abundance are also observed for amino acids encoded by
quartet codons, such as Ala-GCN (3.9% ± 1.4%) and ValGTN (9.7% ± 3.1%), and some amino acid encoded by
AT-rich codons (Asn-AAY, Lys-AAR, and Ile-ATY). In all
these cases, the standard deviation of the amino acid content exceeds 30% of the average value (data not shown).
Protein-coding genes
As already reported, cox2 and cob genes overlap in both
Phallusia species and in all other tunicate mtDNAs so far
sequenced (length overlap from 11 to 29 bp). This gene
overlap could be responsible of the linkage between cox2

and cob (Figure 1), preventing gene rearrangements
involving these two genes. EST analyses have demonstrated that cox2-cob genes are transcribed to a single bicistronic mature mRNA in C. intestinalis sp. A and in H. roretzi
[38]. Thus, a bicistronic mature mRNA for cox2-cob can be
hypothesized even in Phallusia. The conservation of this
overlap could be due to the need to produce a bicistronic
mRNA or to a functional constraint at protein level, such
as the need to preserve a specific amino acid pattern in the
upstream ORF (i.e. in cox2). A careful analysis of the overlap region shows that the sequence included in both ORFs
encodes for an amino acid region not conserved at the Cterminal region of COX2, but well conserved at the N-terminal of the COB protein (the downstream gene), where
an arginine is present in all analysed deuterostomes. Thus,
a functional constraint at protein level for this gene overlap can be excluded.
In P. mammillata, there are two additional cases of overlapping ORFs: nad1-nad2, with a 14 bp overlap, and
nad4L-cox3. In the latter case, a complete TAA stop codon
for nad4L is located 233 bp inside cox3, giving rise to a
NAD4L protein showing a longer C-terminal region with
no similarity to other tunicate NAD4L. Assuming the
existence of an incomplete stop codon, a NAD4L with no
frame overlap and length consistent to the homolog of P.
fumigata can be inferred [see Additional file 1]. As in the
case of cox2-cob, a frame overlap for nad4L-cox3 implies
the presence of a bicistronic mature mRNA, whereas an
incomplete stop codon implies the synthesis of distinct
polyadenylated transcripts and the presence of a polyadenylation signal downstream nad4L. It is interesting that
even in H. roretzi, nad4L gene exhibits a complete stop
codon well inside the downstream tRNA gene, that is 76
bp downstream of the predicted incomplete stop codon
[38].

Most Phallusia genes are inferred to have a complete termination codon, except for cob of P. fumigata and nad4L of P.
mammillata [see Additional file 1]. Such abbreviated stop
codons are assumed to be completed to a TAA codon during the process of maturation and polyadenylation of precursor polycistronic transcripts, as demonstrated by
experimental data in mammals [46] and by "in silico"
analyses of mt ESTs in two ascidians [38]. In these cases, a
complete stop codon is often located a few bases downstream of the incomplete one, as a mechanism to prevent
a translational readthrough in case of incorrect transcript
maturation [47]. Curiously, this situation does not hold
in Phallusia, given that complete stop codons are well
inside the downstream gene in both cob and nad4L genes
where an incomplete stop codon has been found (position 20 of the downstream trnF gene for cob of P. fumigata,
and position 233 of the downstream cox3 gene for nad4L
of P. mammillata).
As expected from the high G content (Table 4), the preferred stop codon is TAG in P. fumigata (10 genes) while
in P. mammillata TAG and TAA are equally used as stop
codons [see Additional file 1]. Similarly, the preferred
start codon is GTG (8 in P. fumigata and 5 in P. mammillata), and most inferred start codons end with a G (12 in
P. fumigata, and 9 in P. mammillata) [see Additional file 1].
Cytochrome b
The cytochrome b protein (COB) of Phallusia and other
tunicates is significantly shorter than in other deuterostomes, indeed the COB mean length is 363 ± 3 amino
acids in tunicates, against 381 ± 4 in other deuterostomes
(see Additional file 2 for species list). This length difference is due to the lack of a carboxy-terminal sequence of
10–24 amino acids, which is highly conserved from vertebrates to echinoderms and even in Xenoturbella. The lost
region include the ENK consensus sequence, with a negatively charged amino acid (E) conserved in all analysed
deuterostomes, and a positively charged amino acid in the
last position of the consensus (K or R in 15 over 23
sequences) (Figure 4). COB is a membrane-spanning protein whose structure has been widely studied both at evolutionary and functional level [48-50]. This protein
consists of three functional domains, each evolving at a
different rate: an intermembrane, a transmembrane, and
a matrix domain. The intermembrane domain is the one
that evolves most slowly, because it contributes structurally to the Qo redox center. The transmembrane domain
consists of eight hydrophobic helices, including those
binding the two heme prosthetic groups [51], and is characterized by a preponderance of conservative amino acid
changes [48]. The matrix domain includes three extramembrane loops protruding into the mitochondrial matrix,
the N-terminal and C-terminal segments of the protein.
This domain is poorly conserved, with amino acid

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/155

replacements fitting neutral evolutionary expectations
and reflecting the relative lack of function of this region
[52]. Moreover, a previous analysis of more than 800 COB
from bacteria to mammals has shown that the last 100 Cterminal residues of this protein are highly variable and
that the immediately upstream H helix is one of the two
least conserved transmembrane helices [50]. The COB
fragment lost in tunicates is the C-terminal segment of the
matrix domain, thus the tunicate protein terminates with
the hydrophobic transmembrane H helix (Figure 4). The
poor conservation of this region in COB of other organisms is compatible with a full functionality of this truncated protein. Moreover, the C-terminal segment
following the H-helix is lost also in COB of trypanosomes
[50], and greatly shortened or lost in some arthropods,
nematodes and molluscs (data not shown).
rRNA genes
rrnS is of similar size in the two Phallusia species (738 and
724 bp in P. mammillata and P. fumigata, respectively),
whereas rrnL is significantly longer in P. fumigata than in
P. mammillata because of the presence of an additional
120 bp-long sequence at the 5' end (1275 and 1147 bp in
P. mammillata and P. fumigata, respectively). However, the
additional rrnL sequence can be also considered as a noncoding region located upstream rrnL (i.e between trnV and
rrnL). Indeed, a long NC region has been also annotated
upstream rrnL in C. intestinalis sp. A and sp. B, where the
5'end of this gene was tentatively determined based on
sequence conservation between orthologous genes of the
three available Ciona species [33,34]. In general, the lack
of transcripts and experimental data on mt rRNAs prevents the exact identification of the rRNA boundaries, and
leaves open the possibility of the existence of non-coding
regions flanking these genes.

The rRNA length of Phallusia species confirms a previous
observation showing that tunicates have some of the
shortest rRNAs among deuterostomes and even among
metazoans [33], their size being comparable to the shortest rRNAs of nematodes and platyhelminthes [53].
Indeed, the average size of tunicate rRNAs is 695 ± 35 for
rrnS, and 1134 ± 68 for rrnL, against an average rRNA size
in other deuterostomes of 864 ± 33 for rrnS, and 1461 ±
93 for rrnL (species listed in Additional file 2).
tRNA genes
The mtDNA of both Phallusia species lacks the tRNA-Asp
gene (trnD). We sought this gene without success on both
genome strands, even as an unusual cloverleaf structure
with only a standard anticodon arm, or as a common cloverleaf structure with a non canonical Asp anticodon (5'VYC-3' instead of 5'-GUC-3'). The absence of the trnD is
inconsistent with the Phallusia codon usage, indeed the
percentage of GAY codons for Asp is similar between Phal-

lusia and other ascidians (1.83 ± 0.01% in Phallusia
against 1.83 ± 0.13% in other ascidians). Moreover, the
GAT codon is preferred over GAC, as expected from compositional data (see Table 4). The mitochondrial import
of a nuclear-encoded tRNA-Asp could functionally compensate the lack of trnD in the mtDNA. Alternatively, it is
possible that a highly modified mitochondrial trnD, with
a transcript maturated through RNA-editing, has not been
identified in the mtDNA because of its unusual secondary
structure. Both mechanisms, tRNA import in mitochondria and tRNA-editing by anticodon modification, have
been observed in marsupial mtDNA [54-56].

In both Phallusia species, three tRNAs (-Asn, -Ser(AGY),
and -Cys) show an unusual cloverleaf structure [see Additional file 3 and Additional file 4].
In tRNA-Asn, the spacer between the DHU and anticodon
(AC) stems is 2 nt long, instead of the canonical 1 nt [57].
This configuration also holds for tRNA-Asn of the stolidobranch H. roretzi and the thaliacean D. nationalis but not
for other phlebobranches (i.e Ciona).
The tRNA-Ser(AGY) retains a DHU-arm with a stem 3 bp
long and a large loop (11 nt long in P. mammillata and 15
nt P. fumigata), while in most metazoans the DHU-arm is
replaced by a loop of variable size [57]. This peculiar cloverleaf structure has not been found in other tRNA-

Ser(AGY) of analysed tunicates and deuterostomes [see
Additional file 2], and it is probably a derived character of
the Phallusia genus or of a narrow ascidian group.
The tRNA-Cys lacks the DHU arm, which is replaced by a
loop 5 nt long, and shows several mismatches in stem
base pairing compared to remaining tRNAs (4 total mismatches in P. fumigata and 7 in P. mammillata) [see Additional file 3 and Additional file 4]. Among analysed
deuterostomes [see Additional file 2], this feature is
shared by ascidians of the order Phlebobranchiata (Ciona
and Phallusia) and by cephalochordates. Moreover, literature data report that the DHU arm of tRNA-Cys is sporadically lost also in vertebrates such as acrodont lizards [58]
and the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus (Rhynchocephalia)
[59]. Thus, current data suggest that the ancestral secondary structure of tRNA-Cys in deuterostome was the standard one, and that the DHU arm was lost independently in
multiple lineages. Moreover, the non-canonical structure
exhibited by tRNA-Cys even in some protostomes and
flatworms [30,60-62] could indicate a tendency of this
tRNA to better tolerate alterations of the cloverleaf structure.
It is remarkable that in ascidians unusual tRNA cloverleaf
structures with lack/acquisition of the DHU-stem have
been found in tRNA genes differing for the last nucleotide
of the anticodon sequence (5'-GCU-3' in tRNA-Ser(AGY)
and 5'-GCA-3' in tRNA-Cys). Exchanges in amino acid
specificity of these tRNAs by a single nucleotide mutation
in the anticodon or relaxed constraints related to the anticodon specificity could explain this observation.
As previously reported, the mtDNA of P. fumigata presents
two trnI, and a trnX gene encoding for a tRNA with uncertain anticodon specificity (Figure 1).
The two copies of trnI are about 6 kb apart and differ only
by two nucleotides at the 3' end of the amino acid (AA)
stem: trnI-1 is located in a position similar to the orthologous gene of P. mammillata (upstream rrnS, see Figure 1),
thus it is likely to be the ancestral trnI gene; trnI-2 is in the
middle of a large duplicated sequence, embedded
between two non-coding regions (see Figure 2), thus
probably arose by a recent gene duplication event. The
region including trnI-2 reported in Figure 2 could be the
result of a "duplication-random gene loss" mechanism,
with the gene loss step not having occurred yet.
The trnX gene is part of the tRNA cluster trnR-trnQ-trnXtrnY, and contains a sequence 30 bp-long showing 93%
identity to a portion of the downstream trnY gene (Figure
5). With slightly different boundaries, the trnX gene can
be folded into two canonical cloverleaf secondary structures with a distinct amino acid specificity (Figure 5): a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/155

tRNA isoacceptor for Tyr (5'-GUA-3' anticodon), as
expected by the sequence similarity to trnY; and a tRNA
isoacceptor for Thr, with the 5'-UGU-3' anticodon overlapped to the anticodon of the alternative tRNA-Tyr structure. In both cloverleaf structures the anticodon is
preceded by U and followed by the purine A, and there are
only few mismatches in the stems (see Figure 5), thus
both structures are compatible with functional tRNAs.
Moreover, the low sequence similarity of trnX of P. fumigata with both trnY and trnT of P. mammillata suggests that
trnX is not the true ortholog of these genes but a newly
acquired gene (data not shown).
In P. fumigata a similarity like that observed between trnX
and trnY is found also in the upstream gene pair trnR-trnQ
(Figure 1). Indeed, trnR contains a sequence 34 bp-long
showing 85% identity to the downstream trnQ gene,
including a 17 bp-long identical sequence (Figure 5). In
other ascidian mtDNAs, the genes trnR and trnQ do not
share any identical long sequence (i.e. > 7 bp), however
the trnR-trnQ gene arrangement is conserved in all available ascidians, except for P. mammillata. These data could
suggest that an alloacceptor gene recruitment mechanism
[63,64] gave origin to these tRNA genes in P. fumigata,
consistent with the existence of a single nucleotide difference between the anticodons of trnR (UCG) and trnQ
(UUG). However, evolutionary reconstructions based on
tRNA sequence similarity are unable to support this hypothesis, because of the low resolution of most nodes of the
tree (data not shown).

Conclusion
The newly determined mtDNAs of Phallusia species and
the comparative data reported here highlight the strong
differences in mtDNA evolutionary dynamics between
ascidians and remaining chordates.
Apart from the genetic code [10], our comparative analyses identify and/or confirm some mt features as distinctive
of ascidians, and possibly of all tunicates, that is: same
transcriptional polarities of all genes; presence of two
trnM genes with different anticodon specificity; short
rRNAs, comparable in size to the shortest mt rRNAs of
nematodes and platyhelminthes; and a "truncated" cytochrome b protein lacking the C-terminal tail, which usually protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix.
The most striking ascidian features is the high frequency
of gene order rearrangements, which is observed even in
congeneric ascidians of two distinct genera (Phallusia and
Ciona) and is not restricted to the tRNA genes, which often
show an unstable mt genomic position. This extreme plasticity may represent a valuable source of data to study the
mechanisms of gene rearrangement. Indeed, the analysis
of gene order variability at low taxonomic distances

increases the probability of identifying intermediary states
of the rearrangement process and/or of observing ongoing
rearrangement events. On the other hand, rapid gene rearrangements could impair the usage of gene order as phylogenetic character at high taxonomic level (because of a
higher probability of gene order convergence in separate
lineages) but will promote its usage to investigate speciation events [34].

elements controlling replication and transcription, commonly assumed to be located in NC regions, can be taxonspecific or extensively overlapped to coding sequences. Of
course, the functional importance and reliability of the
above-mentioned features as "ascidian mitochondrial signatures" need to be further investigated in a wider ascidian sample.

Methods
Changes in tRNA secondary structure, tRNA content,
length and position of NC regions, and compositional
properties constitute an additional source of variability in
ascidian mtDNA. In particular, the variability of NC
regions even at intra-genus level suggests that regulatory

The specimens of Phallusia mammillata and Phallusia fumigata were collected on the coast of Liguria, Tirrenian Sea.
Total DNA was extracted from siphon muscles of a single
individual using the Puregene Tissue kit (Gentra Systems)
following the manufacturer's protocol. For both species,

the complete mtDNA was amplified by long-PCR in several overlapping fragments, in order to avoid the amplification of short mitochondrial pseudogenes sometimes
present in the nuclear genome (Numts). Long-PCR was
carried out with Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche
Applied Science), Expand Long Template PCR System
(Roche Applied Science), or LA-Taq enzyme (TaKaRa),
using several heterologous primers designed on the most
conserved mt ascidian sequences: large subunit rRNA
(rrnL), cytochrome b (cob) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit (cox1, cox2, and cox3) genes. Given the absence of
information on the mtDNA gene order in Phallusia species, several combinations of these heterologous primers
were initially used in PCR reactions, and only those reactions that gave a bright single band during electrophoretic
analysis were further processed. Species-specific primers
were designed on the sequences of the first successfully
amplified and sequenced fragments, and used to amplify
the remaining regions of the genome. In summary, the
mtDNA of P. mammillata was amplified in three long
overlapping fragments (size range: 2.5 – 9.4 kb), whereas
the mtDNA of P. fumigata was amplified in five overlapped fragments (size range: 1.2 – 5 kb). Moreover, in
both species an additional fragment was amplified to confirm the overlap surrounding the rrnL gene. Amplified
fragments, primers sequences and PCR conditions are
reported in Additional file 5. Fragments shorter than 3 kb
were directly sequenced, after purification with the Montage PCR Filter Units (Millipore), using a primer walking
strategy (MWG Sequencing Service). Longer fragments
were re-amplified in short overlapping segments (information available on request), and then sequenced by
primer walking.

structures, such as those lacking an arm. All putative
tRNAs were manually checked, considering the reliability
of secondary structure and the alignment with known
ascidian tRNAs. Thus, transfer RNA identity was specified
by anticodon sequence, and sequence similarity.
Boundaries of rRNA genes of small and large ribosomal
subunit (rrnS and rrnL, respectively) were inferred from
the boundaries of flanking genes.
Compositional features and codon usage similarities were
calculated with Codontree [67]. The GC- and AT-skews,
which indicate compositional differences between the
two strands, were calculated according to the formulae of
Perna and Kocher [68]
Exact direct repeats longer than 10 bp were identified
using the Reputer program package [69].
Comparative analyses were carried out on complete mtDNAs of deuterostomes [see Additional file 2]. In addition
to Phallusia, 49 sequences were analysed, including 10
representatives of Vertebrata, and all available species of
Agnatha (4 species), Cephalochordata (11), Tunicata (5),
Hemichordata (2), Echinodermata (16), and Xenoturbellidae (1).
Alignments of the 13 mitochondrial proteins were performed with CLUSTAL W v1.82 [70] and manually
revised, then the equivalent nucleotide (nt) alignments
were "back-aligned" from the protein data. Transfer RNA
genes were aligned based on their secondary structure.

Protein-coding gene annotations were based on sequence
similarity to orthologous genes of ascidians. ATG and
non-standard initiation codons reported in Wolstenholme [6] were considered as reliable start codons. The
start of a protein-coding gene was inferred as the initiation
codon that does not cause overlap with the upstream gene
and maximizes the similarity between proteins of the two
Phallusia species. Whenever possible, incomplete stop
codons were inferred in order to avoid overlap with the
downstream genes.

Gene order rearrangements were analysed on two datasets, with or without tRNA genes, and the extra genes of P.
fumigata (trnI-2 and trnX) were excluded from all analyses.
The GeneSyn program [71] allowed the detection of gene
strings conserved in chordate mtDNAs. The BPAnalysis
program [72] was used to calculate the breakpoint distances between pairs of genomes with identical gene content (i.e. the number of gene adjacencies present in one
genome but absent in the other). This breakpoint measure
was selected because it makes no assumptions about the
rearrangement mechanisms. Given the differences in gene
content between species and between datasets, a relative
breakpoint distance was calculated dividing the breakpoint distance by the number of genes shared by each pair
of analysed genomes.

Transfer RNA genes were identified by their potential cloverleaf secondary structures. The tRNAscan-SE v1.23 program (UNIX version) [65] was locally run with relaxed
parameters specifically defined for ascidians (used
options: -O -y -X 0 -L 10 -g ascidiancode); the PatSearch
program [66] was used to search for very unusual tRNA

The number of nonsynomymous (dN) and synonymous
(dS) substitutions per site were calculated according to the
codon substitution model of Goldman and Yang [73],
using the Codeml program of the PAML v3.15 package
[74]. The program was run on the gap-free concatenated
alignment of the 13 protein-coding genes, with codon fre-

The complete mtDNA sequences of P. mammillata and P.
fumigata were deposited at EMBL database under accession numbers AM292320 and AM292602, respectively.

quencies calculated from the average nucleotide frequencies at the three codon positions (option CodonFreq = 2),
and maximum likelihood (ML) estimations in pairwise
comparisons (option RunMode = -2). Sequence divergence of rRNA genes was calculated on gap-free alignments with the Baseml program (PAML v3.15 package)
[74] according to the GTR nucleotide substitution model
[75].
