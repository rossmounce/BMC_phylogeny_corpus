Abstract
The First Phylogenomics Conference was held in Ste-Adèle (Québec, Canada) in March 2006.
Selected papers appear in this special issue of BMC Evolutionary Biology. Here, we give an
introduction to the field and provide an overview of the articles presented in this issue.

Introduction
The newly arising discipline of phylogenomics owes its
existence to the revolutionizing progress in DNA sequencing technology. The number of completely sequenced
genomes is already high and increases at an ever-accelerating pace. The newly coined term phylogenomics (portmanteau word for phylogenetics and genomics)
comprises several areas of research at the interface
between molecular biology and evolution. The main
issues are: (1) using genomic data to infer phylogenetic
relationships and gain insights into the mechanisms of
molecular evolution, and (2) using multi-species comparisons and phylogenetics to infer putative functions for
DNA or protein sequences. The word phylogenomics was
first introduced in 1998 in the context of an "approach to
the prediction of gene function" for genome-scale data
[1], and soon after in the context of phylogenetic inference [2]. The majority of publications on phylogenomics
deal with the use of phylogenies to make more sense out
of genomic and proteomic data (see [3] for review). However, the use of data at the genomic scale to reconstruct the
phylogeny of organisms also attracted a lot of interest
recently (see [4] for review).

The First Conference on Phylogenomics was held in
March 2006 in Ste-Adèle (Québec, Canada), with the goal
of creating a synergy between the two phylogenomics
communities. These communities rarely meet, so we created this conference to help bridging the gap between
their respective scientific endeavours. Indeed, the knowledge of the accurate species phylogeny increases the quantity and quality of functional information that can be
inferred. Conversely, knowledge of gene function and the
other selective constraints is primordial to improve tree
reconstruction methods. The conference was attended by
more than 140 participants, with backgrounds in evolution, genomics, molecular biology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and mathematics. It featured 12 invited
speakers, 33 contributed presentations, and more than 30
posters.
Although the themes of the talks were very diverse, one
unifying factor besides phylogeny and genomics emerged:
the development and use of complex models of evolution, allowing sound statistical inference in a probabilistic
framework. The importance of such an approach has been
emphasized for many years [5-7], and the field appears

now to be mature. The growing importance of models
does not decrease the importance of an adequate management of the huge amount of genomic data, an excellent
knowledge of the biological model systems and of the
biodiversity, and, most importantly, in a critical analysis
of the inference and in an imaginative proposal of alternatives. The articles gathered in this special issue provide a
good illustration, with software development [8,9],
model and method development [10-13], and their applications [14-21]. The rest of this introduction article gives
an overview of these papers.

Organismal phylogenetic inference and
evolutionary models
One of the challenging aspects of inferring a species phylogeny from genomic data is the selection of orthologous
sequences. Roure et al. [9] develop SCaFoS, a software to
help handling large alignments of putatively orthologous
sequences. Several options are provided to detect and discard in-paralogs and out-paralogs. The software is aimed
at maximizing the amount of phylogenetic signal in the
resulting alignment by minimizing the amount of missing
data and by selecting, when possible, the slowest evolving
sequence.
Sanderson and McMahon [10] take a completely different
perspective and infer the organismal phylogeny using
genes with numerous duplications. The key principle is to
use the ancient, but rarely used, gene tree parsimony
method [22] to infer species phylogeny. Interestingly,
Sanderson and McMahon obtained a phylogeny that is in
excellent agreement with the expected one, although they
used mainly ESTs data that yield a very incomplete sample
of paralogs, demonstrating the potential power of this
approach.
Although Sanderson and McMahon avoid orthology
inference problems, they are nevertheless confronted to
the limitations of tree reconstruction method, as demonstrated by contradiction between their parsimony and
likelihood inferences. Lartillot et al. [14] address the issue
of systematic errors, which is particularly important in
phylogenomics [23]. They convincingly demonstrate that
multiple substitutions, which are the very cause of systematic errors, are severely underestimated by standard models that assume the same evolutionary process at every
position (e.g. the WAG model [24]).
Along the same line, Bao et al. [13] discuss the important
issue of model selection in the presence of sites partitioned in different rate classes. Codon substitution models can be described at varying levels of parameterization;
how does one choose the right level for each category of
sites? The authors describe a backward-elimination procedure for selecting the model parameters that is shown to

be preferable to the Akaike Information Criterion and its
variants. The hypothesis testing procedure they describe
will prove useful in the analysis of multi-gene families.
Emphasizing again the importance of more sophisticated
evolutionary models, Wang and Hickey [20] perform a
detailed analysis of the codon usage in Oryza. Its properties appear to be very different from the ones from Arabidopsis. In particular, the heterogeneity of codon usage is
much larger in rice. This demonstrates that codon usage
can vary rapidly over rather short evolutionary periods,
potentially constituting a major challenge to existing
codon models. This study strongly suggests that non-stationary models need to be introduced in this field.

Horizontal gene transfer
An important limitation in the inference of the organismal phylogeny is the occurrence of horizontal gene transfers (HGT). Using a well-studied set of 13 Proteobacteria,
Comas et al. [18] look for the categories of genes that are
the most likely to contain vertical signal (i.e. phylogenetic
signal derived through inheritance rather than HGT) and
show that essential genes, but also many poorly characterized ones, carry the most such signal. This study demonstrates that factors determining success of HGTs are far
from being fully understood.
Marri et al. [19] look at the problem at a very short evolutionary scale, i.e. closely related Corynebacteria. A maximum likelihood inference using a gene insertion/deletion
model [25] demonstrates that most of the acquired genes
are rapidly lost. This study thus demonstrates that the simple observation of very different gene complements
among closely related strains does not prove that fixed
HGTs are common in Bacteria.

Detecting Darwinian selection
One of the most promising uses of phylogenetic
approaches in genomics is the possibility to detect Darwinian selection. Chen and Blanchette [12] take an original view on Darwinian selection. Instead of looking at
selection at the amino acid level as usually done, they
introduce a new model to find nucleotides that are unexpectedly conserved, given known constraints at the amino
acid level. The application of their method to complete
mammalian genomes will contribute to the understanding of the many non-coding constraints acting at the
mRNA level.
Phylogenetic footprinting approaches have originally
focussed on the identification of regions that have been
under negative selection throughout a given phylum [26].
However, heterotachy, i.e. variation of the evolutionary
rate of a given position over time, is now commonly used
as a source of functional information. Sites that change

their rates after gene duplication are likely to be involved
in function shift. Dorman [11] proposes a Bayesian
method to simultaneously detect the branch along which
such rate shifts occurred and the sites that are affected and
use it to identify such a shift at the divergence of B and C
subtypes of HIV.
Detecting Darwinian selection remains a difficult task and
therefore the in-depth study of well-defined cases is still
required to validate future methods that will be used at
large scale. Weadick and Chang [27] select the guppy, Poecilia reticulate, because its visual system is under strong
sexual selection. They show that long-wavelength sensitive opsins are highly duplicated in this fish and several
sites are under positive selective pressure. A more detailed
functional characterisation of these proteins, in particular
with respect to mate preference adaptation, is therefore of
prime importance and will provide an ideal case study for
all bioinformatics methods aimed at detecting Darwinian
selection.

Homology detection
One of the original phylogenomics applications was
toward the functional annotation of proteins based on
their phylogenetic relationships to other annotated proteins from the same family [1]. Two aspects of this problem were studied here: (1) the identification of global
functional homologs in families of multi-domain proteins [8], and (2) the identification of remote homologs
[21]. More precisely, Krishnamurthy et al. [8] show that
even phylogenetically-informed approach can, in some
cases, be misleading, especially for multi-domain proteins. The authors introduce FlowerPower, a program and
web server for the detection of global homologs, and
show that it identifies functional homologs more consistently than competing approaches.
Woodhams et al. [21] illustrate one of the major limitations of comparative sequence analysis, that is the extreme
difficulty in detecting distant homolog. This issue is often
wrongly overlooked, even when the presence or absence
of a gene in a given genome is crucial for the analysis.
Using secondary structure and promoter region analysis,
homologs of RNase MRP are discovered in almost all the
eukaryotes for which complete genomes are available.
This demonstrates that RNase MRP was likely present in
the most recent common ancestor of eukaryotes, contrary
to previous hypotheses. This study stresses the urgent
need to improve methods to detect remote homologs,
especially for studying the evolution of genome content.

Applications of phylogenomics to detailed
biological questions
Phylogenomics has the potential of testing specific biological hypotheses and identifying interesting and unex-

pected evolutionary processes. Analyzing human tiling
array data, Zhang et al. [15] use a simple phylogenetic
analysis to identify a number transcripts that are only conserved within primates, thus illustrating the limitations of
phylogenetic footprinting approaches based on sequence
conservation within larger sets of species. Many of these
transcripts exhibit a stable secondary structure and are
thus strong candidates for primate-specific non-coding
RNAs.
Smith et al. [16] study the evolution and positional distribution of the important cycling-AMP response elements
among animal promoter sequences. The binding sites
show a strong positional preference in vertebrates, where
such a bias is absent in non-vertebrate species. The
authors study substitution rates inside functional binding
sites and show that a significant number of them are
affected by substitutions due to CpG deamination.
Improving our understanding of the mutational processes
in non-coding functional regions like transcription factor
binding sites is critical to improve their computational
identification.

Evolution of protein-protein interaction
network
Although the sequencing of complete genomes allows a
comprehensive view on the genetic material of an organism, it is challenging to take into account simultaneously
the evolutionary history and the multiple interactions that
make an organism. Pagel et al. [17] take a first step in this
direction by studying the evolution of protein-protein
interaction networks in fungi. The preferential attachment
hypothesis (i.e. new proteins in a network tend to interact
with proteins already having numerous interactions) is
generally accepted to explain the scale free nature of interaction networks. However, Pagel et al. find no evidence in
favour of this hypothesis and instead demonstrate that a
simple model in which proteins differ in their propensity
to form attachments explains well their data. Although the
small size of the data set analyzed limits the conclusions
of the study, the quality of the phylogenetic method will
certainly set a standard for future works.

Perspectives
As can be seen by this collection of articles, phylogenomics is an extremely diverse and promising field. We
emphasize that although the availability of larger and
larger amounts of data promises an increased accuracy in
phylogenomic analyses, it does not reduce the need for
sophisticated and rigorous methods based on more accurate models of evolution. We hope that this meeting and
this special issue will help researchers take advantage of
both the genomic and phylogenetic approaches of phylogenomics and further enrich this domain by integrating
new views. We are hoping to make this a regular gathering

that will seed the synergy required for the field to achieve
its full potential.
