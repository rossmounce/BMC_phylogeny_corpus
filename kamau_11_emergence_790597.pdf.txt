Emergence of new types of Theileria orientalis
in Australian cattle and possible cause of
theileriosis outbreaks

Abstract
Theileria parasites cause a benign infection of cattle in parts of Australia where they are endemic, but have, in
recent years, been suspected of being responsible for a number of outbreaks of disease in cattle near the coast of
New South Wales. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize the species of Theileria in cattle on
six farms in New South Wales where disease outbreaks have occurred, and compare with Theileria from three
disease-free farms in Queensland that is endemic for Theileria. Special reference was made to sub-typing of
T. orientalis by type-specific PCR and sequencing of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene, and sequence analysis of
the gene encoding a polymorphic merozoite/piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) that may be under immune
selection. Nucleotide sequencing of SSU rRNA and MPSP genes revealed the presence of four Theileria genotypes:
T. orientalis (buffeli), T. orientalis (ikeda), T. orientalis (chitose) and T. orientalis type 4 (MPSP) or type C (SSU rRNA).
The majority of animals showed mixed infections while a few showed single infection. When MPSP nucleotide
sequences were translated into amino acids, base transition did not change amino acid composition of the protein
product, suggesting possible silent polymorphism. The occurrence of ikeda and type 4 (type C) previously not
reported to occur and silent mutation is thought to have enhanced parasite evasion of the host immune response
causing the outbreak.
Background
Theileria was first recorded in cattle in Australia in 1910
[1] and infection rates in endemic parts of the eastern
states (QLD, NSW, Victoria) are high. In a survey in
one region of New South Wales (NSW), 60% of cattle
were positive on blood smears [1] while cattle in endemic parts of Queensland (QLD) showed herd and animal seroprevalences of 75% and 41% respectively [2].
Infection is usually non-pathogenic but it was
recognized more than 40 years ago that under certain,
undefined conditions, the organism may become highly
virulent [1]. Isolates of Theileria, identified as T. buffeli,
have been recorded as common intra-erythrocytic parasites that are spread by members of the Haemaphysalis
tick genus, with wide distribution throughout eastern
Australia [3]. Due to the fact that only a few cases of
clinical disease associated with Theileria infection had

been reported prior to 2005, and transmission studies
failed to elicit clinical disease in test subjects, Australian
strains of Theileria were considered to be benign [3-5].
In recent years, a number of outbreaks were reported in
cattle near the coast of NSW, characterized by anemia,
jaundice, depression, abortion, mortality and the
presence of Theileria in blood films [6]. Most of the
outbreaks were seen in periparturient cattle that have
recently been moved from inland to coastal areas.
The Theileria species present in Australia is referred
to as T. buffeli [7] and belongs to the T. orientalis/sergenti/buffeli group of generally benign, cosmopolitan
parasites found in many countries [8-12]. The taxonomic status of this group has been debated for many
years. Based on serological and morphological grounds
and transmission experiments, [3] suggested these parasites all belong to one species, T. orientalis, despite the
fact that the Theileria sp. present in Japan, Korea and
Russia is locally known as T. sergenti. T. sergenti is an
invalid name taxonomically since it has been used to
previously describe a parasite of sheep [13,14]. Based on

Major Piroplasm Surface Protein (MPSP) and 18S rDNA
sequences, studies have designated these parasites as the
T. sergenti/T. buffeli/T. orientalis group of benign theileria [15,16]. Comparison of the MPSP sequences of
these parasites have shown that global parasites of this
group can be classified into 1-8 types [17,18]. However,
based on the MPSP sequence, one benign Theileria
parasite from Brisbane, Australia (T. buffeli, Warwick)
may as yet be in an unclassified group [18]. Within the
pathogenic protozoans the most diverging proteins are
those at the parasite surface that mediate physical recognition, response and modulation of the host [19]. In this
regard, there was a need to amplify and sequence the
MPSP gene to assess the antigenic variation in order
shed light on how parasite is evolving in evading the
host system.
At the onset of the outbreak, preliminary investigations confirmed the presence of parasite surface antigens
identical to those found in outbreaks of clinical theileriosis in Japan. These antigens had not been previously

found in Australian Theileria isolates [6]. The purpose
of this study was to confirm if the antigens detected
reflected the presence of parasites similar to those found
in Japan, determine if the outbreaks reported in NSW
was associated with an identifiable pathogen; and finally
determine whether the Theileria species identified in the
affected cattle are phylogenetically related to any of the
8 types such as T. buffeli (Warwick), to chitose type or,
more notably, to ikeda type which is commonly found
in Japan and Korea from anemic cattle suffering from
bovine piroplasmosis. For the sake of simplicity, we will
refer to the parasites as type 1-8 when using MPSP
sequences.

Materials and methods
Samples collection and DNA extraction

Blood samples were collected from cattle of mixed ages
known or suspected to be infected with Theileria in six
farms in NSW and three farms in QLD. Sample locations are as indicated in the map Figure 1. Of the 45

Figure 1 Australian map showing sampling locations in two states of Queensland and New South Wales. There were nine farms in total,
three in Queensland and six in New South Wales. All the farms were in the coastal eastern part of Australia as indicated in the map.

animals sampled, 17 were from QLD and 28 from NSW.
Parasite DNA was extracted from whole blood samples
using Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Kits (Qiagen, USA)
and stored at -20°C until use.
Investigation of alternative causes of haemolytic anaemia

To investigate causes of haemolytic anaemia other than
theileriosis, other alternatives considered and eliminated
included babesiosis, anaplasmosis and trypanosomiasis.
All cases were tested for the causative agents by smear
examination and turned out to be negative. Chronic
copper poisoning was eliminated because copper levels
of affected cattle were in the normal range and none of
the changes consistent with copper poisoning were seen
on histopathology in the liver or kidney of autopsied
cattle [6]. Other ingested/injected substances from grazing were excluded because there was no history of
access/injection to such pastures. Immune mediated
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in calves less than 6
months of age was discounted because most cases were
diagnosed in cattle >6 months of age. Other causes of
haemoglobinuria e.g. Bacillary haemoglobinuria (caused
by Clostridium haemolyticum), Postparturient haemoglobinuria (a manifestation of low dietary phosphate
intake) and leptospirosis were all eliminated as haemoglobinuria was not seen in any cases and tests for leptospirosis were negative or low consistent with
vaccination. Bovine virus disease (BVD) is occasionally
associated with anaemia but tested animals were
negative.
Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing

The genomic DNA was subjected to PCR and sequencing for identification of the Theileria species and types
present. The PCR primers used in this study are given
in Table 1. Two genes were targeted for PCR: SSU

rRNA and MPSP. For the ssu rRNA gene, three typespecific sets of primers were used, each specific for one
of the ikeda, chitose and buffeli types of the T. sergenti/
T. buffeli/T. orientalis group [20,21]. In addition universal Theileria SSU rRNA gene primers were used to PCR
amplify the full-length gene of approximately 1800 bp,
which was then cloned into a plasmid vector for sequencing. Internal ssu rRNA gene primers were used to facilitate sequencing of the cloned fragment [22]. In case of
MPSP gene, a 776 bp fragment PCR amplified using primers universal for T. sergenti/T. buffeli/T. orientalis
group. Conditions used for PCR amplifications were 10
μl of GoTaq Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA);
10 mM of each primer scaled up to 20 μl reaction mix.
MPSP PCR products were then cloned into plasmid and
sequenced. Thirty cycles of PCR were carried out using
thermocycler (Takara co. Japan) with the following conditions: denaturation at 95°C, for 15 s; annealing at 57°C
for 30 s; and extension at 72°C for 1 min. The PCR products of expected sizes were confirmed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel, visualized under UV and then
ligated into pGEMT.
SSU rRNA Gene sequence analysis

The samples selected for SSU rRNA gene sequencing
analysis were from herds with high parasitemia (1-7%)
and or those herds with reported cases of deaths. To
minimize the amplification errors caused by Taq polymerase and increase the accuracy, a minimum of 5
clones from two PCR products were subjected to
nucleotide sequencing. The complete nucleotide
sequences were determined from both strands using
3130 XL Genetic Analyzer or 3130 Genetic Analyzer
with the BigDyes Terminator cycle sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences were
applied to a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool

(BLAST) in NCBI for homology analyses of Theileria
MPSP genes. The sequences were edited using Genetyx
Ver. 9 (http://www.sdc.co.jp/genetyx/) and aligned by
clustalX2. The Neighbor Joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree
was constructed using MEGA4 [23]. The molecular
distances were estimated by the Kimura two parameter
models [24]. The nodes were tested for robustness by
1000 bootstrap replications [25]. T. annulata and
T. parva served as the out group. The representative
sequences obtained were registered in the DDBJ/EMBL/
Genbank nucleotide sequence database under the
assigned accession numbers AB520953-AB520958.
MPSP Gene sequence analysis

Further analysis to examine the diversity of the MPSP
gene in samples representing the localities in NSW and
QLD was undertaken. Based on diagnostic PCR and ssu
rRNA sequences, samples for MPSP gene sequence analysis were selected considering their geographic origin
and T. orientalis type detected by ssu rRNA sequence
analysis. A total of 20 samples were sequenced using
MPSP gene analysis. DNA sequencing analysis of positive clones was carried out to examine the diversity of
the MPSP gene in these samples. Universal primers [6]
capable to detecting all eight different types of T. orientalis types for MPSP allele amplifying 776-bp T. orientalis were used in sequencing.

Queensland

There were twelve animals sampled from a Brisbane
property. Of these two had single infection with buffeli,
three were positive with ikeda and chitose mixed
infection, while four had mixed infection of chitose and
buffeli types. Three animals were negative. Clifton property had three positive animals with mixed infection of
chitose and buffeli types. There was only one sample
from Oakey collected which was identified positive with
buffeli type of infection. Percentage of T. orientalis types
detected in Queensland was ikeda (5.9%), chitose
(52.9%) and 58.8% buffeli, majority of which mixed
infections of chitose and buffeli. The summary of the
diagnostic PCR result is described in Tables 2 and 3.

Diagnostic PCR using SSU rRNA species-specific primers
New South Wales

Small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA)
sequence analysis
The sequence results (Figure 2) revealed the presence of
four types of Theileria, type 2 (ikeda), type 1 (chitose),
type 3 (buffeli) and type C. Previously type C has been
reported to occur in Japan and Korea [26]. When
BLAST was done, animal numbers 4 (Forster) and 6
(Kempsey) showed high identity to Theileria chitosetype. Number 1 animal from Raymond Terrace showed
high identity to Theileria buffeli-type of accession
AB000272. Animal 41-Clifton was closely related to type
C accession number U97051. Animal number 10 from
Kempsey and 28 from Camden showed high identity to
Theileria ikeda-type of accession U97048. Based on SSU
rRNA sequences, the three types [26,27] were confirmed
in addition indentifying type C.

The diagnostic PCR detected ikeda and chitose types
In Kempsey property. On this property, there were
eight positive cases, five with single ikeda infection,
one case with chitose type while the others were
mixed infection of ikeda and chitose. Parasitemia ranged from 1-7% with one case of fatality reported. In
Guyra properties, there were six positive animals in
total. Two animals had either buffeli or chitose type
while sixth one had co-infection of buffeli and chitose
types. In Foster locations, there were three positive
cases identified, two of which had mixed infection of
chitose and ikeda, while the third one had mixed infections of all the three theileria orientalis types. Seven
cases of fatalities were recorded in this property. The
Scone property was negative for ikeda, but three cases
were positive with chitose single infection while the
other had mixed infection of chitose and buffeli. The
Camden property had two positive cases with ikeda.
On this property parasitemia ranged 2-7% and no
fatality was reported. Percentage of T. orientalis types
detected in New South Wales was ikeda (46%), chitose
(46%) and 17.9% buffeli, majority of which mixed
infections of ikeda and chitose.

Major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) sequence
analysis
The MPSP phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) was drawn based
on nucleotides sequences. There was a number of single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) observed within and
between group types. For example, (type 1) the chitose
group had three clades within the group while type 2
(ikeda) had four clades forming the larger type 2 (ikeda).
All these different clades within the group were as result
of SNPs occurring. When the nucleotides were translated in protein, they did not result into amino acid
profile change. Of interest to note are the sequences
from animals number 41-Clifton and 45-Oakey which
showed mosaic kind of pattern forming repeated
sequences of chitose and ikeda suggesting the possibility
of genetic recombination occurring. When BLAST was
done, sample number 5, 6 and 12 from (Kempsey), 24
and 25 (Scone), 3 and 4 (Forster), 21 (Guyra) and 35
(Brisbane) all showed high identity to the registered
database sequences of Theileria chitose-type accession
D12689. Sample number 41 and 45, Clifton and Oakey
respectively clustered with the classical benign type

example, in type 1 (chitose), three distantly groups were
found but falling within the larger type 1 group. Single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) within subsections in a
group led to these sub-groups. The type 2-ikeda group
had four sub-groups with animal number 15 Guyra
being distantly from the rest of the larger ikeda group.
The sample 1Raymond, although grouped in type 3-buffeli was distantly related to typical buffeli as shown by

Discussion
Historically Theileria infection has not been associated
with significant disease in Australian cattle. Consequently the identification of Theileria in blood smears
from diseased cattle was initially dismissed as being
unrelated to the disease outbreaks and investigations
concentrated on identifying other possible causes. It was
only when all other possible causes had been eliminated
that a diagnosis of theileriosis was made. Consequently
preliminary investigations had detected presence of
parasite surface antigens identical to those found in clinical theileriosis in Japan. These parasite surface antigens
were confirmed by the detection and subsequent identification of the ikeda, chitose and type 4/type C isolates
commonly associated with clinical cases in Japan and
Korea. This may explain partly the cause of theileriosis.
There have been several epidemiological studies on
theileriosis (T. orientalis) in many countries such as

Turkey, France, Spain [28-31], but only a few fatal cases
due to T. buffeli have been reported to date [8,32,33].
Of the few cases reported, one fatal case was suspected
that the clinical theileriosis might have been exacerbated
by other factors compromising the immune competence
of the animal such as concurrent bovine leukemia virus
infection. In the study all possible causes of regenerative
anemia such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis and trypanosomosis, bovine virus disease among others were
eliminated.
T. orientalis of which ikeda type is a representative,
seems to be closely associated with clinical cases in
Japan and other Asian countries [34,35]. In New South
Wales the epicenter of theileriosis outbreak, ikeda and
chitose types were the predominant types detected
accounting for 46.4% each. In contrast, Queensland had
only 5.9% ikeda with and buffeli at 58.8%. No case of
theileriosis outbreak reported in Queensland. From our
diagnostic PCR, the results indicate presence of ikeda
may have been cause of theileriosis outbreak resulting in
severe anaemia, high parasitemia and cases of deaths
reported in some properties.
Clear taxonomical discrimination of parasites of this
group, often referred as “T. orientalis/buffeli“ has not
been well established. As shown in Figure 3, parasites
found in Australia in this study clearly separated into
four clades (types) that are represented by type 2
(ikeda), type1 (chitose), type 3 (buffeli) and type 4 based

on MPSP sequences. Based on MPSP gene, animal 15
Guyra (AB520947) sequence is marginally separated
from ikeda and other Australian parasites in this clade
indicating increased number of SNPs observed when
compared to other members in this group. There was
evidence of SNPs observed in all the four type groups,
though base transition did not result in amino acid
change, suggesting silent mutation happening on the
sequences coding for MPSP gene [36]. Provide evidence
that silent SNPs can affect in vivo protein folding and,
consequently, function that may in this case cause the
variation of type of antigen detected. Silent mutation
may explain the unique parasite surface antigens
detected earlier in the preliminary investigations [6]. We
hypothesize that this unique antigenic variation might
have enhanced parasite’s ability to evade host immune
system [37] causing the parasite to become more
virulent.
Many of the samples examined showed mixed populations of the different Theileria types. This is a common phenomenon that has also been noted in Japan
[20,38], Korea [39] and Thailand [40] but its clinical
significance is unknown. Mixed infections can occur

both in the host or transmitting vector which results
in different types interacting resulting in mutation due
to competition to propagate and or evade host system.
Recombination has been shown to occur frequently in
Theileria species and has been described to occur
within Tams 1 gene of T. annulata, homologue to
MPSP in T. orientalis [41,42]. The possibility of
genetic exchange where recombination result in an
almost shuffling of sequence types is common. Our
close examination of the MPSP sequence types when
linked to SSU rRNA provided evidence of genetic reassortment i.e. when the MPSP sequences were linked
to the same SSU rRNA sequence. The mode of vector
transmission also might have played a part in the
genetic re-assortment as observed in the MPSP gene
sequence analysis [43]. Suggested that mixed infections
are thought to disturb the host’s immune system, since
MPSP of ikeda and chitose are not serologically crossreactive.
Unlike the sporadic cases seen in the past, the recent
outbreaks featured multiple cases, severe symptoms
including aborted foetuses and many deaths in cattle of
all ages with some individual herds losing 30% of

areas have been in cattle that had been introduced from
tick-free areas 4 to 6 weeks previously. The non-coastal
outbreaks have mostly involved home-bred cattle on
properties where coastal cattle had been introduced a
few months previously. Global warming has been implicated in emergence of pathogens [44] that are adaptable
or transmissible by vectors that otherwise would not
have been possible. Changes in farm management
including animal movements that accompany prolonged
drought may also have compounded the outbreak of
theileriosis.
