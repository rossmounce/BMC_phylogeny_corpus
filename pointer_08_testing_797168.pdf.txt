Abstract
Background: The MC1R (melanocortin-1 receptor) locus underlies intraspecific variation in
melanin-based dark plumage coloration in several unrelated birds with plumage polymorphisms.
There is far less evidence for functional variants of MC1R being involved in interspecific variation,
in which spurious genotype-phenotype associations arising through population history are a far
greater problem than in intraspecific studies. We investigated the relationship between MC1R
variation and plumage coloration in swans (Cygnus), which show extreme variation in melanic
plumage phenotypes among species (white to black).
Results: The two species with melanic plumage, C. atratus and C. melanocoryphus (black and blacknecked swans respectively), both have amino acid changes at important functional sites in MC1R
that are consistent with increased MC1R activity and melanism. Reconstruction of MC1R evolution
over a newly generated independent molecular phylogeny of Cygnus and related genera shows that
these putative melanizing mutations were independently derived in the two melanic lineages.
However, interpretation is complicated by the fact that one of the outgroup genera, Coscoroba, also
has a putative melanizing mutation at MC1R that has arisen independently but has nearly pure white
plumage. Epistasis at other loci seems the most likely explanation for this discrepancy.
Unexpectedly, the phylogeny shows that the genus Cygnus may not be monophyletic, with C.
melanocoryphus placed as a sister group to true geese (Anser), but further data will be needed to
confirm this.
Conclusion: Our study highlights the difficulty of extrapolating from intraspecific studies to
understand the genetic basis of interspecific adaptive phenotypic evolution, even with a gene whose
structure-function relationships are as well understood as MC1R as confounding variation make
clear genotype/phenotype associations difficult at the macroevolutionary scale. However, the
identification of substitutions in the black and black-necked swan that are known to be associated
with melanic phenotypes, suggests Cygnus may be another example where there appears to be
convergent evolution at MC1R. This study therefore provides a novel example where previously
described intraspecific genotype/phenotype associations occur at the macroevolutionary level.

Background
A key question in evolutionary biology is whether the
genetic basis of adaptations in macroevolution is the same
as those of microevolution. This issue has been difficult to
address since the different timescales involved lead to different methods of analysis, with population genetics
being important for understanding microevolution and
comparative phylogenetics being used for macroevolution. The growing understanding of the genetic basis of
adaptive phenotypic traits, however, provides a new
impetus to studies of this question.
Pigmentation is an excellent model for studying the
genetic basis of phenotypic variation. In particular, melanization in vertebrates shows striking variability in pattern and colour that is frequently under strong natural or
sexual selection, with the genetic control often well understood [1]. Many genes are involved in melanin production
and deposition, however the melanocortin-1 receptor
protein encoded at the MC1R locus plays a crucial role in
controlling the type of melanin synthesized by melanocytes [2]. High activity of MC1R (either due to the presence of MSH agonist or high intrinsic MC1R activity)
leads to synthesis of black/brown eumelanin, whereas low
activity (due to an absence of MSH or presence of ASIP
inhibitor) leads either to synthesis of reddish phaeomelanin, or an absence of melanin synthesis. Numerous studies have documented a strong association between colour
variation within natural vertebrate populations and variations within the coding sequence of the MC1R locus [3-9].
One example is the lesser snow goose (Anser c. caerulescens), where the V85M substitution was found in one or
both MC1R alleles in all melanic geese but was absent in
white phase geese [6]. Interestingly, the same mutation
was recently found to be associated with melanism in
another bird, the red-footed booby (Sula sula) [10].
To date, almost all of the associations described between
vertebrate coloration and MC1R have been intraspecific,
and hence relating to microevolution. A previous study
found no association between MC1R variation among
species of Old World leaf warblers and the presence of
small unmelanized patches [11], but it would have been
surprising if such subtle plumage variation was affected by
MC1R as polymorphisms known to associate with MC1R
variation are more widespread across the pelage or plumage and not within small patches. A key question is
whether MC1R variation plays a similar role in colour variation over longer evolutionary timescales as it is not yet
clear whether similar or different molecular mechanisms
underpin phenotypic variation at the macro- and microevolutionary scale. Methodologically, an absence of interbreeding means that the most direct means of
demonstrating linkage/association between genotype and
phenotype, i.e. in families or populations segregating for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/249

colour variation, is generally unavailable for interspecific
studies. However, there is a good and growing understanding of MC1R structure-function relationships, which
has arisen from in vitro studies of the biochemical function of MC1R [12] and studies of genotype-phenotype
associations in domestic and wild species (for reviews see
[13,1]. A crucial finding from these studies is that the
same mutation leads to similar changes in MC1R function
independent of other sequence variation in the protein. In
addition, analyses of patterns of selection provide another
route to identifying functionally important variation
across phylogenies as demonstrated for MC1R and sexual
dimorphism in galliformes [14].
The swans (Cygnus) provide a simple system of colour variation for investigating whether MC1R has a role in interspecific colour differences, and are in the same family as
the lesser snow goose which shows intraspecific association between MC1R genotype and plumage melanism. All
swan species are sexually monomorphic. The four species
in the Northern hemisphere, Cygnus olor (mute swan), C.
cygnus (whooper swan), C. buccinator (trumpeter swan)
and C. columbianus (tundra swan) display pure white
plumage. In the Southern hemisphere, C. atratus (black
swan) has completely black plumage and C. melanocoryphus (black-necked swan) has white plumage on the torso
and wings with black feathers on the head and neck (Figure 1).
In this study we address whether MC1R is associated with
melanin-based plumage coloration in Cygnus. We determine whether variation at important functional sites in
MC1R is associated with colour variation, and whether
these variants are evolutionarily primitive or derived. In
order to do this, we reconstruct MC1R evolution over a
newly generated, independent molecular phylogeny of
the genus Cygnus, since phylogenetic relationships both
within the genus and among Cygnus and other genera of
geese and swans (Anser, Cereopsis, Coscoroba) are poorly
understood [15]

Results
Phylogenetic reconstruction of swans and geese using
CytB and LDH B data
In total an 812 bp alignment (502 bp Cytochrome B, 310
bp Lactate dehydrogenase B) of all taxa was obtained. In
MODELTEST, the TrN + I + G model [16] provided the
best fit to the data. The maximum likelihood reconstruction obtained with this model in PAUP is shown in Figure
1. The identical topology was recovered in Bayesian analyses, and bootstrap support percentages and Bayesian
support strengths are commensurate. Surprisingly, the
genus Cygnus is not recovered as a monophyletic clade:
four of the Cygnus species form a well-supported monophyletic group but C. melanocoryphus is placed as a sister

group to Anser with moderate support. Elsewhere on the
phylogeny, the coscoroba swan and the Cape Barren
goose are strongly supported as sister taxa, which has previously been suggested based on the presence of a CR1 retrotransposon in LDH B [17].
MC1R variation and reconstruction in Cygnus
The full 945 bp coding sequence of MC1R was obtained
for all species studied. There was substantial variation in
the open reading frame among different species of Cygnus,
with 19 synonymous and 33 non-synonymous variable
positions found. All five species had unique predicted
protein sequences. Sites of functional importance were
identified from previous studies based on linkage/associ-

ation between MC1R variants and coat colour, and in vitro
studies of MC1R function, including site-directed mutagenesis. Three putatively important mutations (at sites 92,
100 and 230) were identified among Cygnus species: one
of these (230H) occurs in C. atratus, two (92A, 100K)
occur in C. melanocoryphus, and none occur in any of the
white species. Reconstruction of MC1R evolution over the
molecular phylogeny in PAML shows that these mutations were derived in terminal lineages (Figure 1).
All five individuals of C. atratus sampled have an R230H
substitution. The same substitution is associated with
melanism in arctic skuas (Stercorarius parasiticus) [6] and a

histidine at this position is also associated with melanism
in rock pocket mice (Chaetodipus intermedius) [18].
Cygnus melanocoryphus has two putative functional mutations that are both associated with a change of charge, an
E92A mutation and an E100K mutation. A charge-changing mutation at the position homologous to 92 (E92K) is
associated with melanism in mice, chicken, quail and
bananaquit (Coereba flaveola)[19-21,8] and in vitro studies
in mouse and chicken have shown that the mutation
causes constitutive activation of MC1R [19,22]. The
E100K mutation occurs at a strongly conserved site that
when deleted is associated with melanism in jaguar and
jaguarundi [4].
MC1R variation in other species, and tests of selection
Among other taxa studied, only Coscoroba had a mutation
at an important functional site in MC1R. Coscoroba shares
a derived R230H substitution with C. atratus, and maximum likelihood reconstruction over the phylogeny using
PAML predicts an R residue at position 230 in the inferred
last common ancestor between Coscoroba and Cygnus
(posterior probability = 0.997) strongly suggesting that
the R230H substitution occurred independently in the
two lineages.

Lineage-specific analyses in PAML showed that the melanic C. atratus and C. melanocoryphus had a higher estimated dN/dS ratio (0.21) than other Cygnus lineages
(0.12), but this was not significant. Site-specific analyses
over the whole phylogeny did not provide any evidence
for a category of sites under positive selection (not
shown).

Discussion
MC1R variation and evolution of plumage coloration in
swans and geese
Within the genus Cygnus, it is striking that the only variation at known sites of functional importance in MC1R
was found in the two melanic species, C. atratus and C.
melanocoryphus. These species both had independent
derived mutations (R230H in C. atratus, E92A and E100K
in C. melanocoryphus) consistent with an increase in melanism. Taken at face value, this suggests that MC1R is of
functional importance for melanism among species of
Cygnus, and also suggests that the ancestral swan may have
been white.

However, the interpretation is clearly complicated by the
finding of the R230H mutation in Coscoroba, which has
close to pure white plumage. Either the R230H mutation
has no influence on plumage coloration or it has a differential effect on phenotype in C. atratus and Coscoroba. The
association of a 230H with melanism in two distantly
related species (Arctic skua and rock pocket mouse)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/249

strongly suggests that this mutation does influence MC1R
function. In addition, a growing body of evidence from in
vitro and association studies shows that mutations in the
same positions of MC1R generally have similar effects on
MC1R function in very different lineages, i.e. independently of other variation at the locus. For example, an E92K
mutation has been shown to cause constitutive activation
(high activity in the absence of MSH) in natural MC1R
variants of mouse, chicken and red-ruffed lemur (Varecia
rubra) [19,22,12] as well as human MC1R subjected to in
vitro mutagenesis [23] Another example is the R65C mutation, which leads to low MC1R activity in beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus) and mammoth [24,25]. Taken
together, the presence of histidine at position 230 is therefore likely to affect MC1R activity in C. atratus and
Coscoroba.
We therefore suggest that the most likely explanation for
our results is that MC1R activity is increased in both C.
atratus and Coscoroba, but whereas in C. atratus this leads
to the expected melanism, in Coscoroba other genetic variation, e.g. at one or more loci downstream of MC1R,
influences the phenotype. A precedent for the situation in
Coscoroba is found in the red-ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra).
This primate has a large amount of phaeomelanin in the
coat but also an E94K mutation (homologous to position
92 in the swans), which is generally associated with large
amounts of eumelanin [26]. Recent in vitro studies have
shown that this mutation leads to the expected constitutive activation in MC1R, but that in this case the MC1R is
still responsive to the inhibitor ASIP, so regulation of ASIP
is almost certainly involved in the phenotype [12].
Reconstruction of Cygnus phylogeny
This is the first time to our knowledge that the relationships within the Cygnus genus have been investigated at
the molecular level. Surprisingly, our results do not support the monophyly of Cygnus but suggest that C. melanocoryphus is more closely related to the emperor goose than
to the remaining Cygnus species. These results conflict
with a consensus parsimony tree obtained from 165 morphological traits in modern and fossil Anserinae [27] in
which Cygnus was monophyletic, with C. melanocoryphus a
sister taxon to C. atratus. Interestingly, C. melanocoryphus
was first classified, not as Cygnus, but as the sole member
of the genus Sthenelides [28]. However, the results are
based on two loci, and resolution is not strong throughout the phylogeny, and further molecular data and denser
sampling of other true geese (Anser and Branta) will be
required to increase the resolution of the Cygnus phylogeny. However, it is important to note that the placement
of C. melanocoryphus does not affect the conclusions of the
MC1R analysis.

Elsewhere on the phylogeny, the coscoroba swan is
removed from the Cygnus and emperor goose clade, and
instead forms a strongly supported clade with the Cape
Barren goose, a grouping that has received previous support in molecular datasets (CR1 transposon in LDH B
[17], mitochondrial srRNA [29]). In contrast, in a recent
analysis of the Anseriformes based on mtDNA control
region sequences, a clade containing Cygnus, Coscoroba
and Cereopsis to the exclusion of Anser was recovered,
although statistical support for this grouping was rather
weak [15].

Conclusion
We have likely uncovered an example where macroevolutionary change in plumage colour among species of Cygnus involves variation at the same locus that is involved in
microevolution of melanism within a species of Anser, the
snow goose A. caerulescens. However, the finding of a predicted melanizing mutation in MC1R in Coscoroba highlights the problems of providing a clear demonstration of
functional involvement of a locus in a phenotype in cases
where crosses/transgenics are not possible. A particular
difficulty is that even though there is good information on
the structure-function relationships of MC1R, and growing evidence that point mutations have effects on function
that are largely independent of other sequence variation,
the biochemical properties of MC1R do not necessarily
predict the overall colour phenotype with epistatic interactions with other pigmentation loci also being key.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction
Samples comprised: muscle stored in ethanol from Cygnus
olor (mute swan), C. cygnus (whooper swan), C. columbianus (tundra swan), Coscoroba coscoroba (coscoroba swan),
Anser canagica (emperor goose) and Cereopsis novaehollandiae (cape barren goose) (National Museum of Scotland,
Edinburgh); muscle stored in RNAlater (Ambion) from C.
melanocoryphus (Natural History Museum, London);
genomic DNA from five C. atratus individuals (Raoul
Mulder, University of Melbourne). Genomic DNA was
extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol.
Genomic DNA walking and sequencing of MC1R
The 3' UTR of MC1R from C. atratus was obtained using
the BD GenomeWalkerâ¢ Universal Kit (BD Biosciences
Clontech) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, 2.5 Î¼g of genomic DNA was digested with each of
the four restriction enzymes; DraI, EcoRV, PvuII and StuI
and ligated to the BD genomewalker adaptor. Primary
PCRs were performed using the adaptor AP primer (kit)
and 3' Swan O (5'-CCAACCCCTTCTGCAACTGCTTCTTCGG-3') obtained from preliminary partial MC1R
sequences of C. atratus. PCR reactions were performed in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/249

50 Î¼l, with 2.5 U polymerase (Extensor Hi-Fidelity PCR
Master Mix: Abgene), 0.4 Î¼M of each primer and 1 Î¼l
adapted DNA. The cycling conditions were: 7 Ã 94Â°C 25
s, 72Â°C 3 min.; 32 Ã 94Â°C 25 s, 67Â°C 3 min.; 67Â°C 7 min.
Secondary PCRs were performed using primers AP2 (kit)
and 3'swan inner (5'-CAACCTCTTCCTCATCCTCATCATCTGC-3'). A 1.3 kb segment of MC1R including the
entire coding region was amplified using a forward primer
designed to the 5' UTR of the chicken MC1R gene (Chick
5' utr; 5'-GAGAAAGGGCCCTTTCTTC-3') and a reverse
primer designed to the isolated 3' UTR of the C. atratus
MC1R gene (Swan 3' utr; 5'-TAGCCTTTATTCGGTACCG3') in a PCR containing 2.5U taq (Extensor Hi-Fidelity
PCR Master Mix, Abgene), 2.25 mM MgCl2, 350 Î¼M
dNTPs, 0.2 Î¼M of each primer and 50 ng DNA with
cycling conditions of 94Â°C 3 min, 40 Ã 94Â°C 30 s, 62Â°C
45 s, 70Â°C 45 s; 70Â°C 5 min. For some samples, a new 5'
UTR primer (Swan 5' utr; 5'-GCCCATGTCCTCTTGACC3') was designed that bound downstream of the chicken
5' primer. PCR products were sequenced on both strands
with BigDye v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) using PCR primers and the internal primers MSHR73 (5'-GGCGTAGAAGATGGTGATGTAGC-3') and MSHR74 (5'GTGGACCGCTACATCACCAT-3').
Cytochrome B (CytB) and Lactate Dehydrogenase B
(LDH B) sequencing
PCR primers Cyt B+ (5'-TGCCGACCTGCAAGTAGC-3'),
Cyt B- (5'-GCGATTGAGGCGAGTTGG-3'), LdhF (5'GGAAGACAAACTAAAAGGAGAAATGATGGA-3')
and
LdhR (5'-TTCCTCTGAAGCAGGTTGAGACGACTCTC-3')
were designed to conserved regions identified in avian
CytB and LDH B sequences available on GenBank. PCRs
were performed with standard Taq and reagent concentrations. For Cytb, PCR conditions were: 94Â°C 3 min.; 35 Ã
94Â°C 30 s, 69Â°C 30 s, 70Â°C 45 s; 70Â°C 5 min. A product
of approximately 1 kb was sequenced with the PCR primers and the two internal primers CytB 200-(5'AGGCGAGTGAGGTGTCTG-3') and CytB 700-(5'-ATTTTGTCGCAGTCTGAYACG-3'). Sequences of 502 bp were
obtained for all samples. For LDH B, PCR cycling conditions were: 94Â°C 2 min.; 35 Ã 94Â°C 1 min, 55Â°C 1 min,
72Â°C 2 min.; 72Â°C 5 min. The 600 bp products were
sequenced with the PCR primers and the internal primers
Ldh 390R (5'-AACTGCCACCCAAAAYAG-3'), Ldh 450F
(5'-TAGTACTTTAATATAGAAG-3') and Ldh 750R (5'TGACGAACACCTGCAGTTAC-3') providing sequences of
310 bp for all samples.

(CytB, LDH B and MC1R sequences have been deposited
in GenBank, Accession numbers FJ170040âFJ170063).
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences of CytB and LDH B were concatenated and

(DNAstar). Positions containing gaps were removed
before further analysis. Using MODELTEST [31], the
model of sequence evolution with the highest maximum
likelihood score as shown by the Akaike Information Criterion method was obtained and then implemented in
maximum likelihood analyses in PAUP (v. 3.1, [32]).
Branch support was examined by bootstrap resampling
[33] with 100 replicates. Bayesian inference of phylogeny
was performed in MrBayes (v. 3.1.2, [34]. The data were
partitioned into CytB and LDH B and a GTR + I + Î model
of evolution applied to each partition, and 500,000 generations run, with sampling every 100 generations. Reconstruction of MC1R amino acid substitutions over the
phylogeny obtained was performed in PAML (v.3.13,
[35]).
Tests for Selection
For the MC1R dataset, dN/dS ratios were estimated in
PAML using a codon-based substitution model. Two separate analyses were performed: 1). Lineage-specific models where the dN/dS was estimated for lineages with and
without melanism, i.e. C. atratus and C. melanocoryphus to
the rest of the species analysed. 2). Site specific models in
which different codons are grouped into dN/dS categories
across all lineages. Likelihood ratio tests were performed
on nested sets of analyses.
