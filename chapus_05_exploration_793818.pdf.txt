Abstract
Background: Molecular phylogenetic methods are based on alignments of nucleic or peptidic
sequences. The tremendous increase in molecular data permits phylogenetic analyses of very long
sequences and of many species, but also requires methods to help manage large datasets.
Results: Here we explore the phylogenetic signal present in molecular data by genomic signatures,
defined as the set of frequencies of short oligonucleotides present in DNA sequences. Although
violating many of the standard assumptions of traditional phylogenetic analyses – in particular
explicit statements of homology inherent in character matrices – the use of the signature does
permit the analysis of very long sequences, even those that are unalignable, and is therefore most
useful in cases where alignment is questionable. We compare the results obtained by traditional
phylogenetic methods to those inferred by the signature method for two genes: RAG1, which is
easily alignable, and 18S RNA, where alignments are often ambiguous for some regions. We also
apply this method to a multigene data set of 33 genes for 9 bacteria and one archea species as well
as to the whole genome of a set of 16 γ-proteobacteria. In addition to delivering phylogenetic
results comparable to traditional methods, the comparison of signatures for the sequences involved
in the bacterial example identified putative candidates for horizontal gene transfers.
Conclusion: The signature method is therefore a fast tool for exploring phylogenetic data,
providing not only a pretreatment for discovering new sequence relationships, but also for
identifying cases of sequence evolution that could confound traditional phylogenetic analysis.

Background
Phylogenetic classifications traditionally rely on phenotypic traits and the paleontological record [1]. As a result
of the large amount of DNA sequences now available in
the databases, molecular phylogeny has become an essential companion in studying evolutionary relationships

among species [2]. As usually practiced, it allows constructing phylogenetic trees based on differences between
homologous sequences or genes [3]. A basic and indispensable step in phylogenetic study is alignment of the set
of homologous sequences [4]. However, distantly related
sequences can be difficult to align and under these condiPage 1 of 18

tions, different algorithms often lead to different phylogenetic results [5,6]. There are other problems linked to the
use of biological sequences in phylogenetic analysis,
including sampling of representative sequences, biological processes such as lateral gene transfer, fusion events
and recombination (see Brocchieri et al [5] for a review).
New approaches of molecular phylogeny, taking into
account new characteristics of sequences, have been
recently developed. Such methods include using other
aspects of molecular data such as structural properties of
proteins [7], the presence and organization of genes along
genomes [8-11], occurrence of characteristic patterns
[12,13] and the frequencies of short nucleotide or peptide
relative abundance [14-18]. These methods contribute to
the understanding of species evolution from different
points of view, particularly in terms of our understanding
of genome evolution. What is intriguing about these
methods is that they often yield phylogenetic results comparable to those of traditional methods, frequently
employing data sets much larger than traditional phylogenetic analyses. As such, they deserve the attention of those
wishing to extract maximal information from comparative genomic data sets.
We expand on a method to characterize DNA sequences:
the sequence signature. Sequence signature is defined as
the whole set of frequencies of short oligonucleotides
(words, until ten nucleotides long currently) of a
sequence [19]. The principal characteristics of sequence
signature used for phylogenetic studies are species-specificity of sequence signature and conservation of signature
in any part of the genome [20] allowing researchers to
compare sequences from diverse regions of the genome. It
has already been established that distances between species signatures of the same taxonomic group are smaller
than between signatures of species belonging to different
groups [19,21]. A difference of signatures between two
sequences could arise from shifts in the pattern of point
substitution, but could also involve interactions among
adjacent nucleotides, natural selection, DNA repair processes and conformational constraints (super coiling,
nucleosome formation, bend DNA) [22]. A phylogenetic
analysis of signatures could therefore reflect underlying
genomic changes that shift motif frequencies, thereby
yielding higher-order homologies available for phylogenetic analysis. The method has already been used for taxonomic classification of some species groups [23-25].
One advantage of such a method consists mainly in avoiding the alignment step, and can be used on numerous
sequences of varying size. In addition, distance matrices,
such as those applicable to genomic signatures, generally
permit fast building of trees. Perhaps most importantly,
genomic signatures provide a means of comparing largescale patterns in genomes and can help evaluate trends in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/63

genome evolution across a phenetic tree. However, no systematic analysis of the reliability of the signature
approach has been performed on homologous sequences.
It has been demonstrated that long word frequencies
describes DNA sequence information more accurately
[19,25], but with their much larger number, long words
are difficult to apply to short sequences because word frequencies are poorly estimated. Wang et al. [25] have also
qualitatively analyzed the impact of the choice of the
divergence metrics on phylogenetic results. However, no
quantitative analyses or simulations have been presented
yet on this subject.
In this paper, statistical studies of the ability of a signature
approach for reconstructing phylogenies are investigated,
specifically in order to determine the optimum word
length and the influence of the divergence metric on the
results. One of the tests we employ allows us to determine
whether the signature distance can be considered tree-like,
possessing hierarchical information [26]. Working with
homologous, fully alignable sequences, we tested the
method on simulated sequences whose true topologies
are known and also analyzed two published examples of
DNA sequences that propose novel interspecific relationships. Overall we find that there is a strong correspondence between signature trees and those generated by
conventional means. As a means of improving large
multi-gene studies [27,28], we also propose the use of signatures for rapid, large-scale sequence analysis specifically
to detect subsets of genes supporting similar species phylogenies and to identify cases of horizontal transfer. In an
analysis of 16 complete γ-proteobacteria genomes, we
also illustrate how the signature method can also be used
on data sets in which some of gene sequences are missing.

Results and discussion
Word length and metrics
In order to determine if the distance between signatures
can be relevant in phylogenetic analysis, the signature distances between 2 sequences were plotted as function of
their observed sequence identity (Fig 1). We simulated a
large set of sequences (100 sequences per point) derived
from a reference sequence (random mutations with no
homoplasy). The signature of the different sequences –
the reference sequence and the whole set of modified
sequences – were calculated and compared by Euclidian
metric in order to obtain distances to the reference. The
same plot was obtained with the χ2 metric. These two metrics lead to quite similar results. The χ2 distance exhibited
somewhat more information (steeper slope, better
dynamics of the plot) than the Euclidean distance and was
consequently used. As shown in figure 1, there is a monotonous increase in distance as the observed sequence identity between sequences increased, suggesting the metrics

increasing word length. This is in agreement with previous
results showing that long words provide better specificity
and thus a better taxonomic classification [21]. However,
the use of signatures requires that each word occurs frequently enough to provide a good statistical estimation of
the true word frequency difference between signatures.
The values of the criteria have been also computed for distance matrices of the conventional distance method (Fig
2). From 5-letter words and longer, the criteria from the
signature-based distance are better than those of the conventional distance method, especially for the stress criterion. It appears that the different criteria (metric and
topological) reached stability and quality for word length
around 6-letters. This value of 6 for the word length seems
a good trade-off between sequence size and word length
and was consequently chosen for additional analyses in
this study.

used to compare signatures may be a valid approach to
evaluate differences between sequences.
We then tried to determine how tree-like were the trees
inferred by the signature method, and if the distances in
our signature matrices reflected tree distances. To do that,
we used the distance matrices and the trees of the RAG1
study (see below for a discussion of these results). Various
criteria for evaluating treeness, such as arboricity and
stress, have been used as proposed by Guénoche and
Garetta [26] to answer this question. Considering the
three sums involved in the four point condition in quadruples [29], arboricity measures the percentage of quadruples for which the middle sum is closer to the largest one
than to the smallest one. Stress corresponds to the square
root of the quadratic difference between tree and matrice
distances divided by the average distance value. These criteria are numerical and topological. All the criteria have
been calculated on the signature-based distance matrices.
These distance matrices are obtained using different word
lengths (between 1 and 10), because we do not have an a
priori knowledge of the optimum length.
We found that when word length increases, the arboricity
index increases, indicating that the distance improves as a
phylogenetic measure (Fig 2). This improvement is clear
between 2- and 5-letter words and remains stable for

Are trees for different word lengths converging on a stable
tree or is the tree based on each n-letter word different? To
compare trees, the tree dissimilarity criterion (dT) of Robinson-Foulds [30-32], a widely used tree comparison metric, was computed for trees based on n- and the (n+1)letter word for n = 1 to 9. The dissimilarity distance has
also been calculated between n-letter word signature trees
and trees obtained by ML and distance methods from conventional aligned sequences (Fig. 3).
dT decreases when word length increases (Fig 3), indicating a convergence of the trees towards a stable topology
that is reached for 6-letter word whatever the metric used,
then for longer word a plateau is observed. The 5- or 6-letter word signature trees are comparable to those obtained
by NJ or ML. The dT observed between the signature/NJ or
ML trees and those between conventional NJ/ML trees are
similar for 5-letter word and higher confirming our choice
in 6-letter word for the study.
Simulation of sequences
We decided to compare signatures trees to known trees
using simulated sequences from a known phylogeny. Our
simulation tests used a protocol similar to the work of
Kumar [33] and Gascuel [34]). 100 phylogenetic trees
were chosen randomly among a dataset of the 2000 random trees, proposed by Gascuel to test phylogeny methods [35]. These simulation sets are composed of 24-taxon
or 96-taxon trees. For each tree T, we used SEQGEN [36]
to generate 10 data files with sequences of length 1 kb, 3
kb and 5 kb. These sequences were obtained by simulating
the evolution of nucleotides along T according to the
Kimura two-parameter model with a transition/transversion rate of 2 and a model of site-specific rate heterogeneity following a gamma distribution (with parameter α =
0.75). We obtained for each length of sequence and each
number of taxons 1000 data files.

In both methods, the Neighbor-Joining reconstruction
algorithm was used. The differences in the results come
principally from the choice of the distance. The Kimura
two-parameter can be designed as the "true" distance,
because the parameter of the distance are exactly the same
as those chosen to generate the sequences. So normally
the Kimura distance must be the branch length of the original trees. The fact that the results obtained by the distance
method are not perfect can be attributed to the reconstruction algorithm Neighbor Joining (see Gascuel [37]).
HKY85 is a model that includes the Kimura 2-parameter
(K2P) model, so the result should be the same.

Figure 2
Dynamics of signature distance matrices
Dynamics of signature distance matrices. Distance
matrices were obtained from the RAG1 vertebrate study
(see below). There are two types of criteria: metric (for
example Vaf, stress) and topological (Arboricity, rate of well
designed quadruples, rate of elementary quadruples). Vaf
(variance accounted for): quadratic difference divided by the
variance of distance. Rate of well designed quadruples: quadruples having the same topology according the two distance
matrices; Rate of elementary quadruples, Arboricity; see [26].
On the y-axis, the criteria values obtained from the method
of distance are plotted. For the stress, this value is indicated
also by a dot line.

Two reconstruction methods were applied to the simulated sequences: the signature method, using 4, 5 and 6letter words and the Euclidian and the χ2 metrics, and the
distance method using conventional alignments. We used
three different evolutionary model: Kimura two-parameter model (same model than the one used to generated the
sequences), a simpler model Jukes-Cantor and a more
complex HKY85. All the models have been used with a
rate of heterogeneity parameter α equal to 0.75. The
results are shown in Table 1.
The methods are compared by their ability to infer the
"true" tree, i.e. the topology of the tree that has been used
to generate the sequences. We used the topological distance dT of Robinson-Foulds between the inferred tree and
the true one. The bipartition distance of Robinson-Foulds
[30] is equal to the number of bipartition present in one
of the two trees and not in the other. The results are presented in term of percentage of misinferred branches. This
percentage is equal to the topological distance divided by
the maximum number of different bipartition between
two trees: 2N-6 where N is the number of taxa.

The proportion of wrong branches decreases in the signature method when word length increases (Table 1). At the
same time, the longer the sequences, the better the results
with the signature method. However, the proportion of
correct branches obtained from the signature is not as
high as for the distance method. As expected, the results of
HKY85 are the same than those of Kimura 2-parameter.
The results of the Jukes-Cantor model are similar to those
of the signature for 1 k sequences. But for longer
sequences, the signature method is less effective than the
JC method. The result of K2P can be explained by the fact
that the distance method uses exactly the model used to
generate the data. This fact also explains why the results of
the signature method improve less with the increase of the
sequence length than those of the distance method. The
fact that, for the moment, no evolutionary model can be
design to the signatures limits the estimation of distances
between the signatures. An improvement will be to find
how the signature evolves with time as function of nucleotide substitution models. Increases in sequence length
facilitate estimation of distance by conventional methods,
because the substitution model is known. With the signature, 3 kb sequences are sufficient to obtain a representative signature of the species using 6 letter words. As a
result, the increase in accuracy between 3 kb and 5 kb is
not significant.
Despite the fact that no evolutionary model has been used
with the signature, the results obtained from the signature
method are reasonable. With 6-letter words, only 10 % of
the internal branches are incorrect. It can be compared to
the results presented by Gascuel [37]. The results of the
signature method are not as good as the distance method,
but they are nevertheless rather accurate. In general, the
median size of genes is around 1 k. If we use longer
sequences, it will be in the case of non-homologous
sequences. For long sequences, no conventional method
can be applied.
Vertebrate phylogeny
We used RAG1, a highly conserved gene that produces
small distances between sequences to infer the vertebrate

inferred (for instance, the relationships between mammals are unresolved).

Figure 3
Robinson-Foulds distance analysis of trees
Robinson-Foulds distance analysis of trees. The distances were computed from trees of the RAG1 study (see
below). For each world length between 1 and 10, a signature
tree was computed and compared to the NJ, ML and random
trees. For comparison of random trees and signature trees,
100 random trees were built. In this latter case, the dT is
approximately 86 (the maximum value possible with this
number of species). As a reference, dT between the NJ and
ML trees is plotted as dashed line. The dT of the n-/(n+1)-letter word trees was computed for the Euclidean and χ2 metrics.

phenetic tree [38]. The analysis of the 46 sequences in the
dataset had shown that four sequences were complete and
the other contained only the conserved core, with length
ranging from 1 kb for core sequences to 3 kb for complete
ones. This large difference in length induced a bias in the
signatures of the four complete sequences, and so in the
obtained trees. For comparison with published works
[38], we only used the conserved core of RAG1 gene.
A phylogenetic tree was inferred for 46 vertebrate
sequences by maximum parsimony, distance (nucleic and
protein sequences) and the signature method (Fig 4).
Trees produced by classical and signature methods show
that position of various vertebrate clades (birds, sharks,
mammals, fishes, batrachians) is in agreement with paleontological data. The distance tree obtained using protein
sequences exhibited some obvious errors: birds presented
a stable group but were placed within mammals (data not
shown). Moreover, the relationships between species
within each taxonomic group are frequently incongruent
with other data. The MP method leads to several most parsimonious trees that are summed up into a consensus tree.
On the one hand, the major taxonomic groups can be
recovered and are placed correctly; on the other hand,
positions of species inside these groups are often poorly

In the signature tree, species are placed within classes in
agreement with taxonomy. For example, in the signature
analysis, the relationships within birds are congruent with
conventional analysis [39]. With regard to mammals, the
signature method is the only method that correctly recovers bats as a monophyletic group, with the exception of
Felis catus. But the cat, Felis catus, is misplaced by every
method, and so its incorrect placement cannot be attributed to a specific phylogenetic method. Mammal relationships appear much more problematic when analyzed by
conventional phylogenetic methods than with the signature method. The polyphyly of tetrapods may be
explained by the paucity of batrachian sequences, which
could lead to an unreliable position for this clade. The
monophyly of taxonomic classes, as well as relationships
within each class appear quite robust as measured by
bootstrap values.
To determine how strong the phylogenetic signal is
present in the signature topology, a congruence analysis
of phylogenetic trees [40] can be performed. The topologies obtained by ML, MP (the two best trees), NJ and signature (4- to 6-letter word for the Euclidean and the χ2
metrics) methods, are compared by determining the likelihood of each topology. We establish that the signature
trees have a phylogenetic signal similar to the alignmentbased ones. The signature trees with long words are more
congruent than those using small words. The 6-letter word
χ2 signature-tree is congruent with the ML tree and the
congruence signature/ML is the same than the congruence
NJ/ML (Table 2).
Plant phylogeny
This study, based on an article of Soltis et al. [41], used
18S rRNA for 93 plant species whose sequences are available from the "Green Plant Phylogeny Research Coordination
Group"
http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/bryolab/
GPphylo/RNA/18S_12.html. The species can be grouped
into nine main clades (Angiosperms (flowering plants),
Conifers, Gnetales, Cycads (palm trees), Hornworts, Liverworts, Ferns, Mosses, Lycophytes), with some additional
isolated species and an outgroup.

The signature tree presents significant similarities with the
published tree [41]. The angiosperms, conifers, gnetales,
cycads and ferns form stable monophyletic groups (high
bootstrap coefficients (Fig 5)). The principal result of the
article – that the angiosperms are at the root of conifers,
gnetales, palm trees and ginkgo (Angiosperm + ((Cycad +
Ginkgo) + (Conifern + Gnetale))) – are confirmed by our
study and another molecular study [42]. This phylogenetic organization is original as Gnetales are more often

linked to Angiosperms by morphological data [43-47]
(see Doyle [48] for review).
Recent analyses based on molecular data [49] confirms
this result (Soltis [41] and Källersjö [49]). In addition,
Equisetum and Psilotaceae are placed with the Ferns. This
grouping is found in other studies [50,51] and these species are presented as sister group of Ferns. The sister group
relationship of Psilotaceae and Ophioglossaceae is also
found [52]. Contrary to the results obtained by Soltis, [41]
the ferns are polyphyletic in the signature tree.
The outgroup separates the plants into two groups: the
seed plants and the other land plants. To confirm the position of this outgroup, 18S rRNA sequences of Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe
have been added (Data not shown). The outgroup is still
confirmed as well as the tree split. This separation of land/
flowering plants, the separation of the Lycophytes and the
fact that the moss and liverwort do not form a monophyletic clade have been found also by Soltis when a NJ
analysis was performed [41]. Thus, the signature method
leads to a similar topology as the NJ method with alignment.
Multigene trees
Phylogenetic trees carry two types of signal: species evolution and gene evolution. For a variety of reasons, gene
trees can be different from the tree of species from which
they are sampled [53]. In addition, signals coming from
different genes could lead to different inferred phylogenetic relationships between species [54].

9.3
9.2
9.2

In order to deal with this problem, several genes can be
used to build a multigene tree [27,28]. The addition of signals coming from various genes can under some conditions reinforce the information on species evolution. In
general, the alignment of each gene can be determined,
and alignments concatenated prior to tree building. The
signature has many properties that facilitate the calculation of multigene tree.
Another problem deals with the selection of genes participating into the multigene tree. In general, several steps of
selection occur to eliminate horizontal transferred genes,
duplications or those leading to aberrant phylogeny (see
[27,28] for an example of these steps). Signatures are an
ideal pretreatment tool for identifying horizontally transferred genes [55], and selecting those genes that conform
to evolutionary relationships of the species under consideration. Moreover, due to the rapidity of the treatment
with the signature, a very large number of genes can be
tested at once.
We propose applying the signature method to infer a consensus tree of multiple genes. Two methods are possible.
First, assuming that each gene brings the same quantity of
information to the phylogeny for each species, an average
signature is computed from several genes. The set of average signatures is then analyzed by the signature method.
Another approach is to assume that each gene brings a
quantity of phylogenetic information that is correlated
with its length. In this approach, the sequences are concatenated and signatures are computed on the set of concatenated sequences.

Phylogeny of vertebrate species
Phylogeny of vertebrate species. Three methods were applied to the RAG1 gene from 46 species. Distance method: alignment with ClustalW, (Kimura 2-parameter distance), reconstruction by NJ algorithm. MP: use of same alignment. PAUP* has
been used with default parameters. Signature method: 6-letter words – χ2 metric. The tree is inferred by NJ method. The bootstrap coefficients for distance and signature method are indicated.
To carry out this study, we used 33 genes originating from
ten species (nine Bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio
cholerae, Xanthomonas axonopodis and one Archaebacteria:Archaeoglobus fulgidus – see Material & Methods).
Because the signature does not rely on statements of
homology at the level of individual nucleotides, it is possible to compare signatures from different genes in order
to quantify statistical patterns and information content
among genes. To determine the relative influence of gene
evolution versus species evolution in shaping phylogenetic patterns, all the sequences involved in this study
(393 sequences) were compared together by means of a
hierarchical classification (Fig 6). The hierarchical classification is an unsupervised method allowing the detection
of proximities between complex objects. The main result
here is the grouping of gene signatures by species (Fig 6),
and the species relationships present some differences
with the consensus tree. These relationships are more in
agreement with the known topology. V. cholerae, E. coli
and S. typhimurium form a stable group, but inside this
group, the signatures are grouped by genes (Fig 7). The
signature of V. cholerae is very close to those of E. coli/S.
typhimurium, as well as in the consensus distance matrix.
We clearly face a problem of reconstruction of the Neigh-

bor-Joining algorithm. For E. coli and S. typhimurium, the
differentiation between these two species is quite recent
and the homologous genes are very conserved. This leads
to an alternate clustering of genes. In the Gram+, the C.
perfringens signatures are very different to the other and
place at the root of the Gram+. This confirms the species
specificity of the signature, which was known to be
present even in short DNA fragments [20]. The signatures
of single genes conserve the characteristics of the species
from which they are sampled.
By contrast, an example where gene conservation is very
strong is for EF-Tu gene; the signatures of nearly all the
species are grouped together at the root of the V. cholerae/
E. coli/S. typhimurium group. As it can be observed in the
phylogenetic trees (signature and method of distance,
results not shown), the A. fulgidus and C. perfringens copies of the gene are quite different, enough to their species
signal to be stronger than the EF-Tu signal.
Some gene signatures cluster with species other than their
own in the hierarchical tree. This could result from horizontal gene transfer. For instance, the phosphomannomutase gene of S. typhimurium is placed at the root of the
S. aureus group. In the phosphomannomutase NJ tree and
the signature tree, the relationships between the Gramand the Gram+ bacteria are incongruent with other data

and presumably wrong. Despite that, the other phosphomannomutase signatures are correctly assigned to their
host species. The misplacement of this gene may indicate
a horizontal transfer in S. typhimurium from an unknown
donor. Two other potential horizontal transfers can be
found deep inside species group: the elongation factor 2
signature of N. meningitidis and the ornithine carbamoyltransferase signature of S. aureus respectively inside the V.
cholerae group and inside the C. perfringens group. In each
case the signature is near the signature of the homologous
gene of that species. So the gene signal is strong enough to
displace the signature inside a different species group. To
see if the original sequences are horizontal transfers, we
examined two horizontal transfer databases: HGT-DB
[56] and HGT Analysis Database [57]. In HGT-DB, the
phosphomannomutase sequence of S. Typhimurium is
tagged as horizontal transfer [56], but not the other two
original sequences detected by the hierarchical classification. Thus our novel result suggests original sequences
that need to be studied more precisely before being incorporated into a multigene study.
In all the methods, after removal of dubious genes the
consensus tree separates the bacteria into the Gram+ and
Gram- groups (Fig 8). But for individual genes this topology is seldom obtained. For Gram+ bacteria, the MP and
signature methods lead to a (B. subtilis + (L lactis + (S.
aureus + C perfringens))) grouping, but ML and distance
methods place B. subtilis deep inside the Gram+ group.
For Gram- bacteria, E. coli and S. typhimurium are always
grouped and the majority of the methods (exception maximum of parsimony) place N meningitidis and X axonopodis together. The principal difference is the place of V.
cholerae within the Gram-. The ML and MP trees place V.
cholerae at the root of E. coli and S. typhimurium. The signature method places V. cholerae at the root of Gram- Bacteria.

To compare the result of the different studies and to determine the dispersion of the phylogenetic trees, we used the
dissimilarity distance between the consensus tree and the
whole set of gene trees for distance, MP, ML and the signature method (Fig 9) [32]. The distribution of dissimilarity distances indicates that the signature result is
independent of the chosen gene and that each individual
gene tree is similar to the consensus tree. In this latter case,
the variations mainly arise from the placement of V. cholerae, either at the root of Gram- or E. coli/S. typhimurium
clades By contrast, the distance method leads to variable
results: no distance tree has a dT lower than 6 when compared to the consensus tree. To a lesser degree, the MP and
ML trees exhibit a large dispersion (Table 3). Thus a single
gene signature tree is less dissimilar from the consensus
tree than a conventional one.
The consensus signature method allows us to analyze
genes present only for some species. We added 9 genes to
the data set (see Materials & Methods), thereby increasing
the amount of sequence used to 65 kb per species. The signatures of these genes are amalgamated into the species
signatures. The tree obtained (data not shown) exhibits
the same topology as the consensus tree obtained with the
whole set of genes per species computed previously.
The robustness of the consensus tree topology was
assessed by computing 100 bootstrap trees. The bootstrap
coefficient was 100% for all branches (Fig 8). Another way
to test the robustness of the multigene tree is to vary the
number of genes per species included in it, as in a jackknife procedure [58]. In this case, 30, 50, 75 and 90 % of
the genes available per species are randomly selected.
From the selected genes, an average signature is computed
for each species. Distances between these average signatures are used to obtain a signature tree. This procedure is
performed 100 times per percentage to yield a bootstrap
tree. Results show that the topology of the consensus tree
is always the same. However, in some cases the bootstrap
coefficients are not maximal (table 4).
In the individual phylogenetic trees, the variations in
topologies are so important whatever the method used
(except signature) (Fig 9, Table 3), that they do not allow
us to confirm whether these sequences have in fact undergone a horizontal transfer.
Phylogeny of γ-proteobacteria
We have shown that using signatures and comparing nonhomologous sequences such as are found in complete
genomes made it possible to determine the relationship
between species. To extend the results obtained with 10
prokaryotes genomes, we explore phylogenetic relationship of a well-studied taxonomic group: the γ-proteobacteria [28]. We selected 16 species whose complete

obtain a signature tree the most congruent with the 16S
rRNA tree. In order to compare the results to a reference,
the 16S rRNA sequences have been used to infer a tree by
the ML method (Fig 10A). A comparison of trees using signatures corrected and not corrected for base compositional biases is shown in Figures 10B and 10C.
The 16S rRNA tree permits the establishment of reference
relationships between the γ-proteobacteria. Some taxonomic groups are recovered: Xanthomonadales, Pseudonomaces as well as Pasteurelles. The tree groups
Xanthomonadales and Pseudodomaces, and places B
aphidicola close to Pasteurellale but with a long branch.
This long branch can explain the incongruent placement
of Pasteurelles in Enterobacteria for the ML tree (the phenomenon of long branch attraction [59]).
The tree calculated using the base compositionally-corrected signatures of complete genomes is more in agreement with the 16S rRNA tree. A group of Enterobacteria
similar to that found in the 16S rRNA signature tree was
obtained. However the monophyly of Xanthomonadales
is not recovered in any of the trees obtained from signatures of complete genomes. X fastidiosa is placed at the
root of the group (Xanthomonadale + Pseudomaceae).
Another difference between trees for complete genomes
and those of the 16S RNA is a grouping of Pasteurellales,
Vibrionales and S. oneidensis found in the signature tree.
In the complete genome trees, B aphidicola appears misplaced. It is always positioned apart from the Enterobacterial clade, despite its belonging to this group
taxonomically. An analysis of genome signatures of B
aphidicola revealed that this species exhibits a very different signature from those of the other γ-proteobacteria

(result not shown). This result is not due to a bias in signature method arising from the size of B aphidicola
genome, because a tree obtained by randomly selecting
the same sequence length in the 15 other genomes (650
kb) leads to the same topology (result not shown). We
suggest that the source of this anomoly is that B aphidicola
is a symbiotic bacteria, andhas a very small genome (650
KB) compared with those of the other γ-proteobacteria (4
to 5 Mb). This genome reduction arises from its parasitic
lifestyle and is the result of many independent losses of
genes and genomic segments. B aphidicola experienced
very strong evolutionary pressures that led to a profound
shift in its signature, and also transferred numerous genes
to its host [60]. Such symbiotic species are known to be
difficult to place phylogenetically [61]. B. aphidicola also
has a strong compositional bias (the genome of is nearly
75% AT rich). The other γ-proteobacteria are more GC
rich. These problems appear when using whole genomes
to infer a tree and are bypassed when using conserved
genes or a selection of genes sharing a common history
[28].
We used the method of Dufraigne et al. [55] to detect in
the B aphidicola genome sequences that may have arisen
by horizontal transfer. We divided the entire genome into
5 kb sequence windows. For each window, a 4-letter word
signature was computed. The method developed by
Dufraigne et al. allows us to detect which sequences have
original signatures such as would be found in cases of horizontal tranfer. We removed this original sequences from
the genome and a new 6-letter word signature was computed. The tree obtained is exactly the same as the base
compositionally-corrected tree (Fig 10C).

Conclusion
In this paper we have illustrated the exploration of phylogenetic data with a global sequence analysis method, the
signature method. Using a variety of genes, this method
yields tree topologies similar to those obtained using traditional phylogenetic approaches. The results presented
here suggest that trees obtained by this method could be
used as an exploratory step in phylogenetic studies. The
signature method can deliver a quick overview of phylogenetic relationships between species in data sets that can
be challenging or time consuming for traditional align-

ment and phylogenetic analysis. As our simulations
showed, the signature method sometimes yields phylogenies that are less accurate than those produced by conventional analyses, but this arises mainly from the fact that no
evolutionary model is known for word frequencies comprising genomic signatures. The signature tree can be used
as fast pretreatment in conjunction with classical methods
such as ML. We also demonstrated that the signature distances are tree-like, reflect tree distances and that in the
case of short sequences such as frequently assembled in
studies of homologous sequences, the optimal word
length seems to be 6. This length represents a trade-off
between long words that represent more accurately the
DNA sequences [21,25] and the size of the sequences.
The signature method is particularly useful as a first step
in data exploration. The speed of the analysis permits
detection of either misplacement of particular species, in
some cases due to local composition fluctuations (horizontal transfer), or unexpected groupings of species that
can be scrutinized further by biological means or conventional phylogenetic study. Thus, the signature method
easily permits the researcher to use long and/or numerous
genes in a study. When using numerous species, their phylogenetic proximities can be analyzed using their signatures by conventional statistical methods and the set of
species split into subgroups. This method is also useful in
combining information from different genes. The signature method permits the averaging of a great number of
genes of any length to obtain a consensus and a unique
signature per species and thereby take into account a great
number of evolutionary events. The signature method
does not rely on homology of DNA sites to compare
sequences and it is possible to compare non-homologous
sequences to infer a phylogenetic tree. Thus, many genes
not present in every species can be added to this tree, giving more confidence in the species tree. This approach was
already applied to birds [24], bacterial [15-18,21,62] or
mitochondrial [25] phylogenetic studies. In contrast to
conventional methods, the signature method utilizes
information present in the sequences that may not be analyzable with conventional alignments, such as additional
sequences at the beginning or the end of alignments.

For studies of complete genomes, detection of horizontal
transfer using signatures, such as proposed by Dufraigne
et al. [55], permits removal of sequences that will compromise phylogenetic analysis. Finally, signatures allow the
rapid detection of horizontally transferred genes or simply
misplaced genes that require additional attention via hierarchical clustering or other statistical classification methods.

Methods
Sequence signature
Sequence signature can be computed easily and very
quickly thanks to an algorithm -the "Chaos game representation" (CGR)-, (about 1 Mb per second on a laptop
computer) [63]. The signature can be displayed as an
image, where each pixel represents a word and the darkness of the pixel increases with the frequency of the word
in the sequence.
DNA sequences
We selected two genes to compare signature analysis of
two different clades with results from the literature. These
genes are long enough to get a significant signature and
address the phylogeny of vertebrates and plants including

gene RAG1 is used for inferring the phenetic tree of 46
species of vertebrates. Ribosomal RNA sequence analysis
is the de facto standard for phylogenetic reconstruction.
Here we use ribosomal 18S RNA to analyze 93 plant species. Finally, 42 genes, accounting for more than 50 kb of
sequence, are used for a multigene study (see Annex),
including nine Bacteria and one Archaea. To select the 42
genes, we utilized the SYSTERS database [64]. For all the
selected species, the database returned 119 orthologous
protein families shared by the whole set of species. These
families were filtered by size of the corresponding DNA
sequences (retained families contain sequences with

mean lengths > 1 kb). From these, 33 complete sets and 9
partial sets of genes were obtained. The selected genes
belong mainly to amino acid, nucleotide and protein synthesis and DNA metabolism families. All the sequences
were extracted from GenBank or Genome Information
Broker [65]. The complete genomes of 16 γ-proteobacteria
were gathered from GenBank (see appendix). Simulated
sequences from a known phylogeny were found on Gascuel's website [35].
Phylogenetic analysis and signature method

quantify the differences between signatures. Other metrics

a whole new set of signatures from the initial set of motif
frequencies, sampling with replacement (in general, 100
bootstrap trees were computed). Each dataset contains the
same individuals from the initial data and N new variables (words) randomly drawn in order to replace the N
variables from the initial set [67]. For each set of
sequences, the phylogenetic tree was inferred and a consensus tree was calculated from each bootstrap replicate.
Besides the signature method, three commonly used
methods [3] were used to analyze aligned sequences from
the same data sets: Neighbor-Joining (NJ) [68], maximum
parsimony (MP) [69] and maximum of likelihood (ML)
[2]. All three methods were implemented using the
PAUP* [70] and PHYLIP packages. Alignments were
obtained with ClustalW (default parameters)[4] and were
similar to those used in their respective sources. For the
different conventional methods, we have used the HKY85
model of sequence evolution, and gaps were treated as
missing data in the MP analysis. For ML analyses, a
gamma distribution of rate heterogeneity with simultaneous parameter estimation was used.

investigated as well; these methods rarely performed better than our two focal methods, and often performed
worse, so we do not consider them further. Distance
matrices were obtained via the Euclidean and ?2 metrics.
We used these matrices to infer trees with the NeighborJoining (NJ) reconstruction algorithm implemented in
the PHYLIP package [66]. In order to estimate the robustness of the tree topology, we simulated by bootstrap [67]
