Abstract
Background: Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been found in a wide range of Cnidaria, a basal
group of metazoans in which it is associated with pigmentation, fluorescence, and light absorbance.
A GFP has been recently discovered in the pigmentless chordate Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus)
that shows intense fluorescence mainly in the head region.
Results: The amphioxus genome encodes 16 closely-related GFP-like proteins, all of which appear
to be under purifying selection. We divide them into 6 clades based on protein sequence identity
and show that representatives of each clade have significant differences in fluorescence intensity,
extinction coefficients, and absorption profiles. Furthermore, GFPs from two clades exhibit
antioxidant capacity. We therefore propose that amphioxus GFPs have diversified their functions
into fluorescence, redox, and perhaps just light absorption in relation to pigmentation and/or
photoprotection.
Conclusion: The rapid radiation of amphioxus GFP into clades with distinct functions and spectral
properties reveals functional plasticity of the GFP core. The high sequence similarities between
different clades provide a model system to map sequence variation to functional changes, to better
understand and engineer GFP.

Background
The discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the
bioluminescent jellyfish Aequorea victoria [1] sparked the
interest of marine ecologists, cell biologists, and spectroscopists alike. The subsequent cloning [2] and characterization [3,4] of GFP revealed that its energy-absorbing
core, the chromophore, is self-generated via cyclization of
a peptide triplet buried in the interior of a protective β-can
protein fold [5,6]. Once oxidized using molecular oxygen,
the chromophore shows high stability and absorbance of
high-energy light (blue) that is efficiently re-emitted as
fluorescence of lower-energy (green) light over a wide

range of conditions. The ease of expression of GFP in a
variety of hosts has enabled a myriad of fluorescence
imaging applications, from quantifying transgene expression to probing enzyme activity and protein-protein interactions [7-10]. Its tremendous utility was recognized by
the award of the 2008 Nobel prize in Chemistry.
Since the discovery of GFP in Aequorea victoria, researchers
have identified GFP-like proteins from other cnidarians
with distinctive biochemical and spectroscopic characteristics, extending their utility as fluorescence probes
[11,12]. While the industrial race has been running strong

to find new and innovative applications for GFP as well as
to utilize protein engineering to push the boundaries of
traditional GFP properties, evolutionary ecologists and
marine biologists have continued to strive to understand
the function(s) of GFP in marine organisms.
GFP-like proteins in non-bioluminescent Cnidaria have
varying fluorescence peaks, from cyan to red [4], in some
cases within the same individual. This observation
prompts the question of how many GFP-like genes can be
found co-occurring in one organism. While the three GFP
isoforms in Aequorea victoria differ by only 4 amino acids
and are thought to be population variants of a single gene
[2], other organisms have multiple GFPs. In corals, two
distinct GFP-like proteins were discovered from Zoanthus
(zFP506 and zFP538) and two others from Discosoma
(dsFP483 and drFP583). Despite only a few amino acid
replacements between each pair, their emission spectra
differ dramatically [13]. More recently four spectrally distinct GFP-like genes were reported within the great star
coral, Montastraea cavernosa [14]. In reef building corals, it
is believed that GFP-like proteins are the main determinants of pigment color [15,16]. The presence of multiple
GFPs is addressed by the polyphenism model, which proposes that differential expression of multiple GFP genes
offers a palette of pigment colors to adapt to physiological, ecological or developmental changes [8]. These colors
can be derived from non-fluorescent GFPs which are
deemed chromoproteins due to their internal chromophore that absorbs but generally does not re-emit light
[15,17,18]. In addition to pigmentation, GFP has several
other proposed light-driven functions including photoprotection [19], photoreception and enhancement of
photosynthesis [20,21], as well as non-light driven functions such as radical scavenging [22]. Therefore, in some
cnidarians selective pressure on pigment color may be the
driving force for GFP evolution, while in other cnidarians
selective pressure may have shifted to alternative functions of GFP. GFP has recently been found outside the
Cnidaria, in protostome crustacean copepods [23] and
the deuterostome chordate amphioxus [24,25]. The
occurrence of GFP in these evolutionary distant non-bioluminescent organisms with distinct ecology from cnidarians is intriguing, and characterizing GFP in these
organisms may provide insight into additional functions
acquired by GFP through evolution.
Here, we identify and initially characterize a family of 16
GFP-like proteins in amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae),
the largest set of GFPs known in a single organism. This
extensive family comprises proteins of drastically differing
fluorescence intensities and absorbance spectra. We propose that some members have light-related functions with
a true fluorescence outcome or with only efficient light
absorption (e.g., for photoprotection, photoreception)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/77

while others have alternative biochemical functions
through antioxidant mechanisms (e.g., for cellular
defense).

Results
A family of 16 GFP genes in amphioxus
We identified 16 unique GFP-like genes within the
amphioxus genome. Initial Blast and HMM searches of
the predicted proteome [26] gave 26 predicted GFP-like
sequences or fragments. Two predictions covered parts of
the same gene, another prediction covered two neighboring genes, and another 10 appear to be allelic variants,
and were denoted with an "a" suffix (Table 1). HMM
searches of the genome assembly revealed a number of
duplicate fragments within introns of the identified GFPs,
but did not identify any new genes.

We used manual curation to extend and correct errors in
several gene predictions (Table 1). Curation was aided by
the absolutely conserved intron-exon structure and the
presence of just 6 internal indels within the aligned proteins, verified by EST sequences from several genes. The
first exon encodes only the starting methionine, and was
predicted based on EST alignments and on conserved
splice sites upstream of the second exon. The second alleles of three genes (GFP18a, GFP3a and GFP5a) are close
to gaps in the assembly and remain as fragments.
BLAT mapping to the genomic assembly shows evidence
of extensive tandem duplication: the three members of
Clade E are within 29 kb of each other, the four Clade B
genes are within 55 kb in each haplotype, and GFPa3 and
GFPa4 are 15 kb apart. Many other genes map to short
scaffolds. Our multiple cross-analyses provide an exhaustive list of the GFPs found in the amphioxus genome, thus
completing an earlier report of 12 GFP-like proteins [24].
Those sequences are cross-referenced in Table 1.
All genes are highly similar to each other, with >47% AA
sequence identity, compared to <33% for the nearest
homologs in other species. Sequence analysis places them
in 6 clades, a to f (Fig. 1; clade names incorporated into
gene names) of highly-related sequences. Proteins within
the same clade have an average protein sequence identity
of 91%, while average inter-clade identities ranged from
49% (a to e) to 65% (b to c). The synonymous substitution rate (Ks) between clade members is always <0.32,
while all inter-clade comparisons had Ks >0.47 (Additional file 1), suggesting that clade members result from
recent duplications. Apart from Clade b, each clade can be
distinguished by the sequence of the chromophore triplet
and surrounding pairs of residues (brackets in Fig. 1),
which are known to influence the spectroscopic properties
in other GFPs [27,28].

Multiple GFPs from different clades are expressed in
amphioxus
Members of all clades were found to be expressed, based
on EST sequences or RT-PCR (Table 1). ESTs were found
for 10 genes, with most ESTs (523/599) from just three
genes: GFPa1, GFPe1 and GFPe3 (Table S1). GFP expression is highly dynamic throughout the developmentally
staged EST libraries, and each expressed GFP shows a distinct time-course of expression (Fig. 2). The 5–6 and 26
hour libraries correspond to gastrula and neurula stages,
respectively, but were normalized by oligonucleotide fingerprinting so are not directly representative of relative
EST expression. Three more genes were detected by RTPCR in adult tissue. The low EST count of most GFPs suggests that other GFPs may be expressed below the level of
detection of these EST libraries. In agreement with the heterozygosity of the genome sequence, most ESTs and RTPCR products have multiple AA substitutions compared
with the genomic sequences that are supported by multiple reads from different libraries.

Further evidence that these genes are functional comes
from Ka/Ks ratios that show that all continue to be under
clear purifying selection. Ka/Ks ratios for all amphioxus
GFPs are less than one, by either pairwise or tree-based
comparisons, and all but two comparisons are ≤0.5 (Additional file 1).
Twenty-one GFP-like sequences from the related B. lanceolatum are available in the NCBI patent database, of which
16 were full length. Putative alleles (>95% AA identity)
were discarded, leaving 10 candidate distinct genes. These
all mapped to clade b, but did not have distinct 1:1
orthologs in B. floridae, suggesting that this clade is evolving and expanding in both lineages.
We searched for homologs of these genes in the genomes
of Ciona intestinalis, C. savigyni (ascidians), Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea urchin), and in the public nucleotide (NT), EST, and protein databases using profile
HMMs and Blast. The closest homologs found were those
previously described in copepod crustaceans, indicating
that amphioxus is still the only deuterostome known to
encode GFP-like proteins. The high similarity of amphioxus GFPs to each other and the spotty phylogenetic distribution of GFPs suggest that amphioxus acquired a
single ancestral GFP by horizontal transfer, followed by
extensive duplication and diversification.
Spectral characteristics can be different among GFPs of
amphioxus
We amplified, cloned, expressed, purified, and measured
fluorescence and absorbance spectral characteristics of
one representative of each clade, with the exception of
clade b (GFPa1, GFPc1, GFPd2, GFPe1, and GFPf1). All
proteins were well expressed, highly soluble, and easily

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/77

purified. GFPa1, GFPe1, GFPd2, and GFPc1 showed
monophasic absorbance and fluorescence spectra with
more or less pronounced shoulders (Fig. 3), while GFPf1
was essentially non-fluorescent. The absorbance spectrum
was different among GFPs showing a peak ranging from
470 to 504 nm (Table 2, Fig. 3A). Spectra of GFPa1 and
GFPe1 were very similar with strongly overlapping profiles, while the spectrum was broader towards lower wavelengths for GFPc1, and shifted to lower wavelengths for
GFPd2. Concentrated protein solutions of GFPc1, GFPd2,
GFPe1, and GFPf1 were bright yellow in color while solutions of GFPa1 appeared greenish. Accordingly, the GFPs
have very different extinction coefficients, ranging from
6,100 to 130,700 M-1 cm-1 at 500 nm (Table 2). This broad
range encompasses the coefficient of 56,600 M-1 cm-1
found for the commercially available eGFP [29], which
highlights the necessity to further investigate the photophysical characterization of the GFPs from amphioxus.
The fluorescence emission spectrum upon blue light excitation differed among GFPs, with peaks ranging from 495
to 529 nm (Table 2, Fig. 3B.). GFPf1 did not exhibit any
detectable fluorescence. The GFPe1 and GFPc1 spectra
were similar; GFPa1 was the sharpest, showing a pronounced shoulder at 540 nm while GFPd2 was much
broader with developed shoulders at 510 and 525 nm
showing an overall shift towards the blue (Fig. 3B).
The GFPa1 excitation spectrum for emission fixed at 516
nm peaked at 500 nm while spectra for GFPe1, GFPf1,
GFPd2, and GFPc1 were below detection limits of the
spectrophotometer.
In contrast to the somewhat subtle differences in spectral
shape, the GFP-like proteins showed striking difference in
fluorescent intensity (Table 2). GFPa1 exhibited the most
intense fluorescence while the fluorescence intensity of
the other proteins was about 200 times lower.
Antioxidant activity associated with select amphioxus
GFPs
GFPa1, GFPe1, GFPd2, and GFPc1 were evaluated for
antioxidant capacity using the total antioxidant status
assay (EMD Biosciences) whereby ABTS radical is formed
from the reaction of ferrylmyoglobin radical and ABTS.
The addition of antioxidants inhibits the formation of
ABTS radical by quenching either the ferrylmyoglobin
radical or the ABTS radical directly. GFPd2 and GFPe1
both showed antioxidant activity by substantially inhibiting formation of ABTS radical (Fig. 4). The GFPd2 activity
was statistically significant (P < 0.05) relative to controls
and inactive GFPs, while GFPe1 was borderline significant
with P = 0.053, likely due to the small sample size (N = 3).
In contrast, neither the highly fluorescent GFPa1 nor the
weakly fluorescent GFPc1 showed any significant antioxidant activity (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Origin and evolution of amphioxus GFP
All Branchiostoma floridae GFPs are highly similar in
sequence and genomic structure, and most are found in
tandem duplications. Coupled with the apparent independent expansion of Clade b in B. lanceolatum, and the

absence of GFP from any other deuterostome genomes or
expressed sequences, this suggests that a single ancestral
GFP was horizontally transferred into the amphioxus lineage, and then expanded by tandem duplication and
transposition to form the current set of 16 genes. Accordingly, we showed here that all GFPs from B. floridae clusPage 5 of 11

tered together, suggesting a single horizontal acquisition
from a common ancestor, which appears to be more
closely related to copepod than cnidarian [25]. Ka/Ks
ratios indicate that all of these genes are under purifying
selection. There are substantial differences between alleles, between genomic and EST sequences, and between B.
floridae and B. lanceolatum genes, suggesting that the GFP
repertoire is continuing to diversify and evolve in amphioxus. The recent origin and high sequence similarity
between GFPs with diverse properties suggests this as a
model to dissect the sequence-function relationship
within GFP.

Distinct and dynamic developmental expression patterns
of GFPs indicate functional diversity
We report here the occurrence of 6 clades of GFP-like proteins in amphioxus, encompassing 16 sequences. The
strong EST expression and fluorescence of genes like
GFPa1, indicates that light absorbance and/or fluorescence must serve an important function at some developmental or physiological stage. Unfertilized eggs show
bright green autofluorescence that persists throughout the
first cleavages of development after fertilization [30]. Even
though the level of fluorescence appears variable through
the next stages of development, it is clearly brighter again
at the neurula stage [30], and spreads into bright green
fluorescent patches throughout the larvae, though already
appearing more concentrated around the buccal area, as
for adults [25]. Such dynamic fluorescence display often
reported throughout development in amphioxus is clearly
supported here by the variable levels of expression for different GFPs (Fig. 2).

The whitish/transparent flesh color of adult amphioxus
argues against a role for GFP in coloration (pigmentation)
of mature amphioxus, correlating with the low expression
seen in EST libraries. Amphioxus eggs have a yellow/
cream color, which progressively fades to fully translucent
from neurula onwards (Holland LZ, pers. comm.). This
may be in part due to high expression of the GFPe clade in
the earliest stages, though the later moderate expression of
these genes in neurula and larva does not correlate with
body color and may instead be involved in radical scavenging. Neurula and larva however are also brightly fluorescent, thus correlating with the expression of GFPa
genes at these stages. The absence of other GFPs from
these libraries may be due to highly selective expression
within particular tissues, stages or physiological

responses. This is indicated for example by the distinct
patches of fluorescence in the larvae. Due to incompleteness and bias in EST libraries, this area warrants further
exploration. Given, for instance, the selective expression
of GFPa1 in the oral cirri where bright fluorescence is confined in adults [25], it will be valuable to explore expression of the various GFPs through in situ studies in order to
address their specific function(s).

ing other than the XXG template exists in natural or engineered GFP-like proteins [34]. Like their closest relatives,
copepods, nearly all the amphioxus GFP-like proteins
have a GYG triplet. The only exception, and the first nonXXG GFPs yet seen are in the two alleles of both GFPb1
and GFPb2, which contain a GYA triplet. All Clade b genes
in B. lanceolatum retain the GYG triplet, suggesting that the
GYA is a recent evolutionary innovation.

We propose that the six clades of GFP-like proteins may
represent several functional classes of proteins with multiple variants in each class. Differential expression of
members of each clade may then be coordinated to fulfil
a given function with GFP-like expression varying temporally, spatially, and in concert with environmental
changes.

Expansion of GFP gene family in amphioxus may bolster
cellular defense via antioxidant activity
Gene family expansions as seen for GFP are relatively rare
in amphioxus, but are enriched for specific functions,
including cellular defence [35]. We speculate that the antioxidant function of some GFPs may fall into this category
and function by scavenging deleterious oxy-radicals. BouAbdallah and colleagues have shown in vitro that wild
type GFP from Aequorea victoria quenches superoxide radicals (O2•-) and exhibits SOD-like activity by competing
with cytochrome c for reaction with O2•- [22]. We have
shown here that at least two amphioxus proteins, GFPe1
and GFPd2, have antioxidant activity. GFPe1 shows optical characteristics different than GFPd2, being similar to
GFPa1 (fluorescent) and GFPc1 (essentially non-fluorescent), which lack antioxidant activity. Thus the antioxidant and optical properties do not correlate.

Distinct spectral characteristics among GFPs indicative of
functional diversity
The spectral characteristics of each tested GFP show significant differences and suggest distinct functions for each
GFP, or perhaps clade. The absorbance spectra have
intriguing differences. In particular, GFPd2 lacks the typical GFP-500 nm peak retaining only a ~470 nm peak
which is seen as a shoulder in GFPa1, GFPc1, and GFPe1
and has been previously described as a vibrational structure, bearing no electronic difference from the 500 nmabsorbing chromophore [31]. In agreement with Baumann et al. (2008), we find that GFPa1 exhibits remarkably bright fluorescence and is likely to be the protein
responsible for fluorescence in the oral cirri. By contrast,
GFPe1, GFPc1, and GFPd2 fluoresce weakly yet but are
highly absorbent (high extinction coefficients) and may
function in pigmentation during development, and/or in
photoprotection. GFPf1 has a small extinction coefficient
and no detectable fluorescence and so appears to lack a
light-associated function. Whether the clades grouping
GFPs based on protein sequence identity also correspond
to groups of GFPs within distinct optical characteristics
cannot be answered here, since only one representative
GFP was analyzed per clade. However, the average of
about 10% difference in sequence identity among GFPs
from the same clade suggests that optical variability is possible within GFPs of the same clade [3,32]. Nevertheless,
such diversity in optical characteristics from GFPs cooccurring in the same individual is probably the best indicator of multiple functions being explored within the family of amphioxus GFPs.
Some amphioxus GFPs exhibit a highly divergent
chromophore site
Delagrave and colleagues have shown that the glycine in
the third position of the chromophore triplet is essential
for chromophore formation [33]. No chromophore bear-

Conclusion
We have described the largest known family of GFP proteins and the only known deuterostome GFPs. Despite
their high sequence similarity, they have significant spectroscopic and functional differences. Amphioxus contains
a GFP that is highly fluorescent, GFPs that are weakly or
essentially non-fluorescent, bearing either high or low
extinction coefficients, and GFPs that are weakly fluorescent yet bear antioxidant activity, suggesting the existence
of at least four functional classes of amphioxus GFPs
(Table 3). All GFPs are also under selective pressure, and
show a wide range of distinct expression patterns, supporting the suggestion that all have distinct functions in
the animal.
While the precise roles of these proteins remains unresolved, this work establishes clearly that amphioxus GFPs
have multiple light-associated and light-independent
functions. The divergence of GFPs from B. lanceolatum and
the conserved sequences and genomic organization of
amphioxus GFPs suggest that future cloning and characterization of GFPs from multiple amphioxus species, and
engineering of chimeras will be a feasible and productive
method to better understand the evolution and sequencefunction relationship for this first family of deuterostome
GFPs.

Methods
Sequence Analysis
GFP-like sequences were predicted from Assembly 1 of the
amphioxus genome [36] and gene predictions, using
Blast. Alleles were distinguished by inspection of intronic
sequence conservation, mapping to Assembly 2, and identity of neighboring genes. Ka/Ks ratios were calculated
using DnaSp [37] and an online server [38]. Searches for
GFPs in other sequence sources used Blast, Psi-Blast,
HMMer and Gene Detective, a hardware implementation
of the Genewise algorithm (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA).
ESTs were downloaded from NCBI on Nov 12, 2008, and
Blasted against GFP nucleotide sequences. Library information was extracted from EST FastA headers.
RNA Extraction and Protein Cloning
Branchiostoma floridae (amphioxus), collected from
Tampa Bay, Florida were frozen at -80°C, ground to a
paste using a mortar and pestle and RNA extracted using
TriReagent (Sigma) and the RNeasy kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was made with the Retroscript kit (Ambion,
Austin, Texas). Gene-specific primers for GFPa1, GFPc1,
GFPd2, and GFPe1 were designed based on sequences
from the genome database (JGI) and used to amplify GFPlike genes from amphioxus cDNA by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). Gene-specific primers for GFPf1 were
designed based on sequences from the genome database
(JGI) and used to amplify GFPf1 from amphioxus EST
clone CAXG1077. PCR products were cloned into either
the pET24b(+) E. coli expression vector (Novogen, New
Canaan, Connecticut) at NdeI and HindIII restrictions
sites or the pHIS8 E. coli expression vector at NcoI and
HindIII restrictions sites [39].
Protein Expression and Purification
Transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were incubated with
shaking at 37°C in Luria broth [40] containing 50 μg/ml
kanamycin until OD600 nm = 0.8. Protein expression was
induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl 1-thio-β-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and the cultures were incubated with shaking
at 37°C for 4 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifuga-

tion at 9,000 g and cell pellets resuspended in lysis buffer
[400 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol,
10 mM BME] supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme.
Following sonication and centrifugation at 100,000 g,
supernatant was passed over a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) equilibrated in lysis buffer, washed with 10
bed volumes of wash buffer [400 mM NaCl, 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM imidazole, 10 mM BME] and the
His-tagged protein eluted with 10 bed volumes of elution
buffer [400 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM
imidazole, 10 mM BME]. Subsequently, 30 units of
thrombin protease were added and the eluted protein was
dialyzed overnight against 400 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris
pH8, 10 mM BME. The retentate was reloaded onto a
Ni2+-NTA column to remove the protein bearing
uncleaved His-tags and then passed over a benzamidine
sepharose column to remove the thrombin protease. The
resulting flowthrough was concentrated and loaded onto
a Superdex S200 gel filtration column (Amersham, Piscataway, New Jersey) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer [400
mM NaCl 50 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT] to isolate homogeneous dimeric GFPa1, GFPc1, GFPd2, GFPe1,
and GFPf1. Peak fractions were collected, concentrated,
and stored at -80°C.
Spectral Characterization
Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a SE200 low-light
digital spectrograph (Catalina Scientific Instruments, Tucson, AZ) upon excitation with a 465 nm LED (Ocean
Optics, Dunedin, FL) that showed a narrow spectrum as
defined by the Full Width at Half the Maximum intensity
(FWHM = 31 nm). To measure fluorescence spectra GFPlike proteins were diluted to 1 μM and excitation was set
at 800 msec and zero electronic gain. All dilutions were
done with gel filtration buffer. Normalized fluorescence
spectra were measured with proteins diluted to 1 μM
(GFPa1) or 10 μM (GFPc1, GFPd2, GFPe1, and GFPf1).
Excitation was set at 800 msec and zero electronic gain
(GFPa1) or 5 sec with 150 electronic gain (GFPe1, GFPc1,
GFPd2, and GFPf1). Absorbance spectra were recorded
with the same apparatus. Normalized absorbance spectra
were recorded from proteins diluted to 10 μM. A Spectra

Max M2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) spectrophotometer was used to measure excitation spectra at 10 μM
protein concentration. Fluorescence emission was set at
515 nm while excitation was scanned from 350–505 nm.
Extinction Coefficient
Protein concentrations were calculated using the extinction coefficient of the chromophore after denaturation in
0.1 N NaOH (44, 000 M-1 cm-1 at 446 nm) [41,42].

Absorbance of GFPa1, GFPc1, GFPd2, GFPe1, and GFPf1
was measured using a Spectra Max M2 (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) spectrophotometer and extinction coefficients calculated according to the Beer Lambert
law.
bfloGFP Antioxidant Capacity
The total antioxidant status assay (EMD Biosciences,
Darmstadt, Germany) was used to evaluate antioxidant
activity. This assay is based upon the inhibition of the ferrylmyoglobin•-catalyzed oxidation of colorless ABTS
(2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)
into ABTS• which is green in color and absorbs at 600 nm.
Addition of antioxidant quenches the ferrylmyoglobin•,
inhibits ABTS• formation, and decreases absorbance at
600 nm. GFPs do not absorb or fluoresce in the 600 nm
range, and so they do not optically interfere in this assay.
Total antioxidant status assay reactions were carried out
according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 20 μL of
either sample buffer, a protein sample, or the reaction
standard, 6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid, was added to 1 ml of phosphate buffered
saline containing metmyoglobin and ABTS and vortexed.
200 μL of H2O2 substrate was added, vortexed, and the
absorbance at 600 nm was followed for 3 minutes. All
proteins were diluted to 200 μM prior to addition. Addition of GFP buffer alone (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM
NaCl, 1 mM DTT) served as a control reaction while addition of lysozyme (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) served as a
negative control. Absorbance values were expressed relative to the reaction standard. The assay measurements
were completed three independent times (N = 3). At the
end of the assay, OD values from each sample measurement were expressed relative to the mean OD obtained
from the standard. Relative OD values were then log(x+1)
transformed to respect homocedasticity of the statistical
analysis (Zar, 1996). Differences among samples were
tested for statistical significance with α of 0.05 for twotailed comparisons. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and
post-hoc multiple comparison of means (Fisher's PLSD)
were used to test differences, using Statview 5.0 (SAS Institute, Inc.).
