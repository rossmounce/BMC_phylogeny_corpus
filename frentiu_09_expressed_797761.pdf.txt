Abstract
Background: The native Australian fly Drosophila serrata belongs to the highly speciose montium
subgroup of the melanogaster species group. It has recently emerged as an excellent model system
with which to address a number of important questions, including the evolution of traits under
sexual selection and traits involved in climatic adaptation along latitudinal gradients. Understanding
the molecular genetic basis of such traits has been limited by a lack of genomic resources for this
species. Here, we present the first expressed sequence tag (EST) collection for D. serrata that will
enable the identification of genes underlying sexually-selected phenotypes and physiological
responses to environmental change and may help resolve controversial phylogenetic relationships
within the montium subgroup.
Results: A normalized cDNA library was constructed from whole fly bodies at several
developmental stages, including larvae and adults. Assembly of 11,616 clones sequenced from the
3' end allowed us to identify 6,607 unique contigs, of which at least 90% encoded peptides. Partial
transcripts were discovered from a variety of genes of evolutionary interest by BLASTing contigs
against the 12 Drosophila genomes currently sequenced. By incorporating into the cDNA library
multiple individuals from populations spanning a large portion of the geographical range of D.
serrata, we were able to identify 11,057 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with 278
different contigs having at least one "double hit" SNP that is highly likely to be a real polymorphism.
At least 394 EST-associated microsatellite markers, representing 355 different contigs, were also
found, providing an additional set of genetic markers. The assembled EST library is available online
at http://www.chenowethlab.org/serrata/index.cgi.
Conclusion: We have provided the first gene collection and largest set of polymorphic genetic
markers, to date, for the fly D. serrata. The EST collection will provide much needed genomic
resources for this model species and facilitate comparative evolutionary studies within the montium
subgroup of the D. melanogaster lineage.

Background
The genus Drosophila has proved to be one of the most
useful groups of organisms with which to investigate fundamental questions in biology. The melanogaster group, in
particular, has provided many of the model species currently studied by evolutionary biologists, including the
native Australian fly Drosophila serrata [1]. D. serrata
belongs to montium, the most speciose yet taxonomically
least understood subgroup in the melanogaster group
[2,3]. The utility of D. serrata in addressing evolutionary
questions has been long recognized, for example in studies of speciation [4,5]. More recently, it has gained prominence as a model species for investigating the evolution
of traits involved in sexual selection and mate recognition
[6-8] and climatic adaptation [9-11]. The identification of
functional genetic variants underlying phenotypes of
interest, however, has been limited by the absence of a
species-specific gene collection.
In recent years Drosophila serrata has become an important
system with which to investigate sexual selection. The fly
uses a blend of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) as contact
pheromones for mate and species recognition [6]. Studies
utilizing D. serrata have, for example, investigated the evolution of sexual dimorphism in CHCs [12,13], divergence
of mating preference in novel environments [14] and
post-copulatory sexual selection [15]. Population differences in sexual selection regimes and the underlying
genetic architecture of CHCs have also been identified
[16,17], raising the possibility that different loci and/or
alleles may be implicated in generating these phenotypes
in each population. Although the quantitative genetic
basis of CHCs under sexual selection is well understood in
this species [18-20], the molecular genetic basis of these
phenotypes remains unknown.
Drosophila serrata has also proved very useful for understanding the process of climatic adaptation. Its distribution spans at least 17° in latitude (Figure 1) along a
narrow band of suitable habitat on the east coast of Australia and populations experience a variety of temperatures and humidity gradients [21,22]. For example,
latitudinal clines have been found in traits such as cold
resistance [10,23], viability [10], developmental time
[10], body size [9], wing shape [24] and CHC profile
[8,16]. Chromosomal inversions are also known to vary
in frequency along the latitudinal gradient [25] and may
host co-evolving alleles at genes involved in climatic
adaptation [26]. Mapping genes to particular inversions
and identifying genomic regions involved in adaptation
along the cline require a collection of molecular markers
spanning the D. serrata genome.
The utility of Drosophila serrata to comparative studies
(e.g. sexual character evolution) requires an accurate
reconstruction of evolutionary relationships. The resolu-

tion of systematic relationships in the melanogaster group,
however, has proved notoriously problematic [27-30].
Within the montium subgoup, in particular, the high
degree of morphological convergence and similarity in
male genitalia coupled with limited fossil representation
has meant that taxonomic relationships are particularly
unclear [3], necessitating a gene-based approach.
Attempts to resolve phylogenetic relationships within the
montium subgroup have so far been both sparse and based
on very few genes [31], although relationships among the
Australian species have recently received more attention
[22,32,33]. Resolution of phylogenetic relationships in
the highly speciose montium subgroup requires the development of additional genetic markers.
A cost-effective way of identifying a large number of
genetic loci is to build an EST library [34], especially for
species possessing a large genome and without a genome
sequencing project. ESTs are single read sequences produced from sequencing an mRNA pool that samples the
transcribed genes within a given set of tissues, individuals
or populations. An EST library represents a resource that
can be used for many downstream applications to address
questions in evolution and ecology. For example, an EST
collection can aid identification of genes underlying phePage 2 of 10

notypes of interest through the development of expression arrays [35] and provide a wealth of markers that may
offer resolution of previously problematic phylogenetic
relationships [36]. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and simple sequence repeat (SSR)
markers (e.g. microsatellites) occurring within EST
regions provide a source of potential markers for QTL
mapping applications [37] and population genomic studies [38,39].
Here, we describe an EST collection from a normalized
whole body library for Drosophila serrata as a genomic
resource for this model species. The study was designed to
simultaneously identify sets of genes potentially involved
in the expression of traits of interest to evolutionary biologists and to provide an array of molecular markers for
population genomic studies by incorporating multiple
individuals from several natural populations of the species. We present the sequences of 6,607 putative genes and
outline the discovery of numerous microsatellite and SNP
markers present in the dataset. Using this EST collection,
we have identified several genes which we hypothesize
may be involved in the expression of traits that are implicated in sexual selection and climatic adaptation in D. serrata. Additionally, we have identified genetic loci that may
eventually resolve the phylogeny of the montium subgroup. Individual EST reads are available from Genbank
and dbEST (accessions FK858115 – FK867478 and
59290665 – 59300028 respectively) and from http://
www.chenowethlab.org/serrata/index.cgi.

Results
EST Statistics
We sequenced a total of 11,616 ESTs from the 3' end (see
Methods for explanation of sequencing rationale), of
which 9,738 were of sufficiently high quality and length
to process further. The EST sequences were assembled into
a total of 6,607 contigs (note that we use Staden's 1980
original definition of a contig [40] which allows for single
sequence contigs, here referred to as singleton contigs).
Most contigs were represented by single sequences (5,419
out of 6607; Table 1), with an average length of 575 bp.
The 1,188 contigs represented by at least two sequences
were slightly longer on average than singletons (795 bp
vs. 575 bp; Table 1). The majority of contigs (6,009 out of
6,607; Table 1) were found to be coding for peptides, suggesting that our strategy of sequencing from the 3' end was
successful in identifying both protein coding sequences
and 3' UTRs. Fewer than 10% of contigs represented
sequences that included transposable elements (TE),
pseudogenes, noncoding RNAs (ncRNA), microRNAs
(miRNA) and transfer RNAs (tRNA) (Table 1).
EST annotation and identification of genes of interest

mRNA sequences in FlyBase at 01/03/2007 using BLAST
[41]. All but 13 contigs returned hits to other Drosophila
sequences, allowing us to assign putative functions to
almost the entire EST library by using the top hit from the
BLAST search. This approach has the caveat that sequence
homology does not imply functional homology due to
possible divergence of gene functions among species. At
least 66% of the contigs had BLAST hits with e-values
below 10E-05, suggesting significant sequence homology
of our transcripts to genes from other Drosophila species. A
number of partial transcripts were identified from genes
implicated in CHC biosynthesis (e.g. fatty acid desaturases and elongases, [42]) and sexual selection in other
Drosophila species (Table 2, [43-48]). Partial transcripts
were also found from genes that may underlie traits
involved in climatic adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster,
for example heat shock proteins (Table 2, [49-55]. Additionally, a number of transcripts were identified tagging
other genes of interest, for example in resolving phylogenetic relationships and rates of evolution in montium subgroup species (Table 2, [27,56,57]).
Despite the moderate number of ESTs sequenced, the
library captured a range of types of transcripts, as indicated by the number of Gene Ontology (GO) [58] terms
assigned to contigs. A total of 465 GO terms were assigned
to contigs in our library, including 72 Cellular Component, 193 Biological Process and 200 Molecular Function.
The five most commonly represented GO terms in our
library were assigned to at least 30 contigs, with the largest
category being proteolysis in Biological Process (Figure 2).
The most frequently represented categories included
housekeeping genes, for example structural components
of ribosomes and protein biosynthesis genes (Figure 2).
The chromosomal distribution of ESTs surveyed in this
library was largely similar to that present in Drosophila
melanogaster. Chromosomes 2, 3, X and 4 accounted for
approximately 37%, 44%, 16% and 0.01% respectively of
the total percentage of ESTs discovered in D. serrata. This
distribution is close to that observed for D. melanogaster,

with chromosomes 2, 3, X and 4 accounting for 37%,
44%, 18% and ~0.01% respectively of the total genome
[59]. X-linked sequences are slightly underrepresented in
D. serrata compared to D. melanogaster, a result that may
be due to the small number of transcripts surveyed in our
study or may reflect real biological differences between
the species. The number of putative genes identified in
our library that were protein coding was 6,009, resulting
in a gene density of ~5 genes per Kb if we assume the D.
melanogaster euchromatin amount [59]. Given our limited
sequencing effort necessitated by cost constraints, these
numbers compare well given the estimate of ~14,000
genes in D. melanogster [59,60] and suggest we have captured slightly less than half of the genes present in the
genome. However, a large number were loci that are identified as CG-id only on Flybase, of which on average over
half are estimated to be computational predictions with
uncharacterized functions and may not represent real
genes [60].

Genetic markers for mapping and population studies
We identified numerous microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers from our EST library
using the software SciRoKo version 3.1 [61]. To maximize
the chance of a potential microsatellite marker being polymorphic we restricted our search for di-, tri-, tetra-, pentaand hexa- nucleotide motifs that were present repeated at
least six times in the contig sequences. If only perfect
repeat microsatellites are considered we found a total of
394 markers comprising 295 di-, 95 tri-, 3 tetra- and 1 hexanucleotide repeats (Table 3), representing 355 different
contigs. The majority (83%) was found in protein coding
transcripts and the rest were found in transposable elements. When repeats were allowed to have a conservative
degree of mismatch (≤ 2 bp), at least twice as many microsatellite markers were revealed (Table 3), representing
836 independent contigs. Again, the majority of imperfect
microsatellite markers (85%) were found in protein coding sequences, with the rest being found in transposable
elements.

Distribution of GO terms
Distribution of GO terms. The five most frequently represented GO terms for each of three major gene functions in
the D. serrata EST library, as indicated by the number of contigs in each category.
We found a total of 11,057 putative SNP markers in our
EST collection. Close to a third of these SNPs (3,219) were
identified from contigs that comprised only two ESTs.
Although a large proportion of these are likely to be real
polymorphisms, in practice it is difficult to identify a priori
without further testing which of these 3,219 SNPs are also
spurious mutations introduced during reverse transcription, cDNA library construction and contig assembly. A
more reliable way of identifying real polymorphisms is to
only consider SNPs found in at least two ESTs from contigs comprising at least four sequences [62]. A total of
5,866 SNPs were found in contigs of at least four ESTs, but
of these only 1,438 were represented by at least two
sequences. A large proportion (1,254) of these 'doublehit' SNPs [63] were also of high quality, with at least one
of the base variants having a mean PHRED quality score
of ≥ 20. The 'double-hit SNPs' occurred in 278 individual
contigs. Most SNPs were discovered in contigs with relatively low sequence coverage (Figure 3) and many contigs
displaying variation harboured between 1 and 5 SNPs
(class 4–8 ESTs/contig; Figure 3). Although increasing
alignment depth (i.e. the number of ESTs/contig) resulted
in increased SNP discovery, the actual number of contigs
harbouring very many SNPs was low (Figure 3). Our strat-

Drosophila serrata EST web database
The D. serrata EST collection presented here is available on
the web at http://www.chenowethlab.org/serrata/
index.cgi. The site comprises several pages from which
EST contigs are available for download in several formats
(e.g. FASTA). The 'Search' page allows the user to find particular transcripts either by contig identity, annotation or
chromosome location (based on Drosophila melanogaster
chromosome designation) and for particular microsatellites by sequence type and repeat number. It should be
noted that the chromosome arm labeled as 3R of D. serrata by [25,64] is equivalent to the 2L and not the 3R of D.
melanogaster due to an earlier labeling error [64]. Workers
wishing to map genes to the D. serrata chromosome
labeled as 3R by [25,64] using sequence homology with
D. melanogaster should choose genes found on the 2L arm
of the latter species. Contigs can also be viewed either by
gene name or by GO terminology. A TAB formatted file
provides additional information for each contig, including contig length and results of BLAST searches against
other databases (see above). Detailed BLAST results are
also available as XML files linked to each contig. The D.
serrata EST web database can also be queried using the
BLAST tool hosted on the site. Contig identification codes
fall into three categories: 1) contigs comprising at least
two transcripts, denoted by CL followed by a number
from 1 to 1,210; 2) singleton contigs of good sequence
quality, denoted by CL0; and 3) singleton contigs of
poorer sequence quality, denoted by CLx. A total of 9,364
individual EST reads, excluding rRNAs, RNAs of mitochondrial origin and sequences shorter than 50 bp, have
been deposited with Genbank (accessions FK858115 –
FK867478) and dbEST (accessions 59290665 –
59300028).

Discussion
Here we have described an EST collection for the native
Australian fly Drosophila serrata that has become a prominent model for studies of sexual selection and climatic
adaptation. Using a normalized library from whole fly
bodies and 3' end Sanger sequencing of clones, we generated a functionally diverse collection of 6,607 EST contigs,
the majority of which encoded peptides in addition to 3'
UTRs. Using BLAST analyses we were able to successfully
assign putative functions to EST contigs according to
sequence homology with the 12 Drosophila genomes available in FlyBase http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu. This
unique collection of ESTs will greatly facilitate the development of genomic applications in D. serrata, such as
gene expression arrays.

The number and average length of microsatellites (SSRs) found in the D. serrata EST library, based on 6,607 contigs. The minimum-repeat number
for both analyses was six.

Our approach of incorporating multiple individuals from
collections spanning the geographic distribution of the
species allowed us to generate genetic markers for population level studies. We identified at least 394 EST-associated microsatellites and, by aligning in a single contig
sequences representing different naturally occurring alleles, we discovered at least 1,254 high quality SNP markers.
We have already designed and tested primers for 150 ESTderived microsatellites currently being used in QTL mapping studies of traits under sexual selection in D. serrata.
Although the total number of SNPs found in the EST collection was 11,210, over half of these were found in contigs of sequence depth ≤ 3 sequences. An additional
proportion was found in contigs of depth of at least four
sequences but represented by only one allele. An
unknown fraction of these SNPs is probably due to reverse
transcription and amplification errors during library synthesis, poor quality sequence and assembly and alignment errors rather than genuine polymorphisms. Despite
this, we were still able to identify a large number of potentially polymorphic SNPs by considering only those found
in contigs of at least four sequences and where the minor
allele is found in two transcripts or more. Our results and
those of previous workers [63] suggest that SNP identification can be highly successful from normalized EST
libraries if multiple individuals are included in the original mRNA pool, although polymorphic marker identification may be biased towards those found in highly
transcribed genes.
Gene annotation against the 12 Drosophila genomes available in FlyBase also allowed identification of genes that
may underlie traits of evolutionary and ecological interest.
We found at least nine genes that may be involved in the
expression of traits under sexual selection (Table 2) such
as cuticular hydrocarbons. For example, we have identified partial transcripts from two desaturases (desat1 and
desat2) and an elongase involved in CHC biosythesis [42]
(Table 2). Functional polymorphism in desaturase and
elongase genes has been shown to produce different CHC
profiles in Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster

[44,46,65]. The partial transcripts of the desaturase and
elongase genes have already been used to design primers
for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) studies,
with the goal of obtaining full-length sequences. We have
also identified an accessory protein (Acp70A-1; Table 2)
transcript in D. serrata that may be involved in male sperm
and seminal fluid traits, as has been found in D. melanogaster [47,66]. Previous work has shown that D. serrata
exhibits particularly high female remating rates and levels
of multiple paternity in both lab and field populations
[15]. Insemination rates and multiple paternity levels may
be highly dependent on sperm characteristics and may
reflect genetic polymorphism among males at particular
genes [47,67].
Our EST collection and array of microsatellite and SNP
makers may also facilitate further exploration of the
molecular genetic basis of climatic adaptation along a latitudinal cline in Australian Drosophila serrata. First, we
found a number of heat shock protein (Hsp) and other
genes (Table 2) that are thought to modulate physiological tolerance to temperature in D. melanogaster [68,69].
One of these genes, Hsp83 (also known as Hsp90) has
been implicated in cold resistance in the closely related
species D. birchii [70]. Second, genes involved in CHC
biosynthesis may also be involved in desiccation resistance along the cline since cuticular hydrocarbons also
serve to waterproof the insect [42]. The genes desat1,
desat2 and elongase are of particular interest since they
have been shown to mediate CHC polymorphism in D.
melanogaster [44-46] a trait that displays clinal variation in
Australia in both Drosophila species [21]. For example,
desat2 is involved in the biosynthesis of 5,9 dienes in D.
melanogaster [46], compounds which are also found in D.
serrata [71]. The gene elongase is also involved in the synthesis of longer chained dienes in D. melanogaster [44] that
are also expressed in D. serrata. Third, the SNPs and microsatellites found in the EST collection could be used to
identify genomic regions that may be involved in climatic
adaptation. Pronounced genetic divergence at genes
underlying phenotypes under selection compared to neu-

potentially more might be identified by BLAST searches
using other phylogenetically relevant genes as queries
against our database. At the time of development and

jambulina and D. birchii were the only other montium species with any significant molecular data in Genbank, out
of a subgroup of over 100 species. Phylogenetic markers
may be developed using data from these four species for
use in other montium taxa, by designing degenerate primers for example. Further work will help resolve phylogenetic relationships in this important subgroup and will
allow accurate tracing of the evolutionary history of interesting traits, among other questions.

SNP discovery versus alignment depth. Proportion of
SNPs identified in the D. serrata EST database versus contig
alignment depth, restricted to the dataset of 1,254 'double
hit' high quality SNPs. The total number of contigs for each
alignment depth class (number of ESTs/contig) is represented
by the height of the column. The different shading patterns
within a column indicate the number of SNP classes (e.g. 1–5
SNPs/contig). Most contigs were shallow in depth (4–8 ESTs/
contig) and contained relatively few (1–5 SNPs) sequence
variants per contig. Note that here alignment depth is not
constant across all sites along the contig and instead denotes
the total number of ESTs per contig.

trally evolving markers and specific patterns of sequence
polymorphism may indicate areas of the genome
involved in adaptation along a cline [72]. Fourth, microarray probes can now be designed to detect changes in
gene regulation in response to selection on particular phenotypic traits known to vary clinally. Fifth, our EST collection facilitates physical mapping of particular genes to
chromosomal inversions in D. serrata and may help
resolve the degree of chromosomal synteny between montium and other subgroups of the D. melanogaster group.
Finally, we were able to identify genes that should be of
phylogenetic utility in resolving relationships within the
montium subgroup of the Drosophila melanogaster group,
which to date remain unclear [31]. EST collections provide a means of obtaining partial sequence for many
genes at once, providing potential resolution of previously problematic taxonomic relationships [36]. Partial
transcripts from several genes of phylogenetic interest
(e.g. aconitase, PGI) were found in our EST collection and

Drosophila serrata is a native Australian fly that has recently
become a prominent model system with which to investigate the evolution of traits under sexual selection and
traits involved in climatic adaptation. Understanding the
molecular genetic basis of traits of interest to evolutionary
biologists has been hampered by a lack of genomic
resources for this species. Here, we have reported the
development of an EST library for D. serrata from whole
fly bodies at several stages of development. We sequenced
11,616 EST clones from the 3' end that were assembled
into 6,607 contigs. The majority of contigs was found to
contain peptide-coding sequence in addition to 3' UTR
and represented a substantially diverse set of gene functions. At least 394 potentially polymorphic microsatellites
were found associated with the EST contigs. By incorporating multiple individuals from five populations
throughout the distribution of D. serrata, we were able to
identify a large number of SNPs, including at least 1,254
'double hit', high quality sequence variants. The EST
library contained partial transcripts from genes of interest
to studies investigating the molecular genetic basis of sexual sexually selected traits, for example desaturases
involved in CHC biosynthesis. A number of genes were
also discovered that may code for phenotypes implicated
in climatic adaptation along a latitudinal gradient in D.
serrata, for example heat shock proteins. The EST library
has also revealed a number of genes of potential phylogenetic utility and that may help resolve evolutionary relationships within the highly speciose montium subgroup.
We anticipate the genomic resources provided by the EST
library will facilitate numerous downstream applications
that will answer fundamental questions in evolutionary
biology using D. serrata as a model organism.

Methods
Fly populations and RNA isolation
Our EST project was designed to simultaneously generate
a library of putative genes for sexually selected traits and
polymorphic markers for population level studies. The D.
serrata sample comprised larvae at the last instar (N = 30)

and five adult stages: day 0 (emergence) (30 females, 30
males), day 1 (25 females, 30 males), day 2 (22 females,
28 males), day 3 (30 females, 28 males) and day 4 (23
females, 24 males). Several life stages were used in order
to maximize gene discovery for further microarray and
gene expression studies. Within the sample used, five populations were represented, spanning the geographical distribution of D. serrata on the east coast of Australia:
Cooktown, Cardwell, Sarina, Brisbane and Forster (Figure
1). Flies were obtained from mass bred cultures established from wild-caught inseminated females (N = 20)
from each of the five geographical locations and maintained at large population sizes in the laboratory for
approximately two years.
Individuals were removed from rearing bottles and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted
from whole fly bodies using Trizol (Invitrogen, Australia)
and mRNA purified using the GenElute mRNA miniprep
kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Australia). Equimolar amounts of
mRNA from each sex and each life stage were pooled to
construct a single cDNA library. Library construction and
normalization were performed by Agencourt Biosciences
(MA, USA) according to proprietary protocols.
EST sequencing and assembly
Sequencing was performed from the 3' end of transcripts.
There are several advantages to this strategy. First, identification of unique contigs (and therefore putatively unique
genes) is more reliable than in 5' sequencing projects
since alternative splicing is much more frequent in 5' as
opposed to 3' UTR [73], meaning that it is more likely for
transcripts of the same gene to share a common polyA tail.
This reliability combined with the depth of alignments
containing transcripts from multiple individuals facilitates discovery of polymorphic molecular markers, like
SNPs and microsatellites [63]. Second, they represent
much better features for expression arrays since crosshybridization amongst gene families is reduced due to 3'
UTRs being generally less conserved than coding regions.

Sanger sequencing of the 3' ends of clones was performed
by Agencourt Biosciences (MA, USA), using a proprietary
sequencing primer. ESTs were clustered using the TGICL
tool http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software under
the default parameters, with vector sequences and polyA
tails masked. ESTs which were not assembled into any
contig were identified and the quality of their sequence
was determined using the program LUCY2 [74] with the
following parameters: error 0.025 – 0.02, bracket 20 –
0.02 and window (20 0.01 10 0.03). The shortest accepted
length of good quality sequence was 18 bp. Single ESTs
that passed quality trimming were then grouped into an
artificial cluster denoted CL0 and ESTs that did not pass
were grouped into another artificial cluster denoted CLx.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/40

Therefore, sequences in the cluster CL0 were quality
trimmed whereas sequences in the cluster CLx were not.
Assembled contigs and individual ESTs from clusters CL0
and CLx were then annotated in the same way.
Annotation of genes via sequence homology with other
Drosophila
The 6,607 sequences (contigs and unassembled ESTs)
were first queried using nucleotide versus protein blastx
against the NCBI nr (non-redundant) protein database,
limited to Drosophila entries. Blastx parameters were set to:
amino acid substitution matrix BLOSUM-62 [75], a statistical significance threshold of 10 for database matches
[76] and costs to open an alignment gap and extend a gap
of 11 and 1 respectively. Query sequences were filtered for
low compositional complexity using the program SEG
[77]. Sequences that did not match any proteins were
annotated using the following Drosophila melanogaster
release R5.1 sequences from FlyBase http://fly
base.bio.indiana.edu/: microRNAs, miscellaneous RNAs,
noncoding RNAs, all pseudogenes, all transposons and all
transfer RNAs. Searches against FlyBase were performed
using nucleotide vs. nucleotide blastn. Output from the
blastx search was functionally annotated with Gene
Ontology (GO) terminology using the blast2go tool with
the default parameters http://www.blast2go.de[78].
Genomic localization of the ESTs was done using the tool
Exonerate [79] and the D. melanogaster genome as reference.
Microsatellite and SNP marker identification
The database of 6,607 contigs was mined for microsatellite and SNP markers to be used in future population
genetic studies. For the identification of microsatellite
markers, we used the program SciRoKo version 3.1 [61]
that can easily identify di- to hexanucleotide repeats.
Searches were conducted to identify both uninterrupted
and interrupted (≤ 2 bp mismatch) motifs, with a minimum number of repeat units of six.

Putative SNP markers were identified from all contigs
with at least two ESTs by using a custom Perl script. Polymorphic sites were denoted using an IUB code (e.g. Y).
Each SNP was assigned a quality score that was an average
of individual PHRED scores for each sequence at that base
position. ESTs often contain error mutations introduced
during the reverse transcription process and spurious polymorphism may arise in contigs from incorrect assembly.
Consequently, using the rationale of [62], we also identified SNPs that are represented by at least two sequences in
contigs with at least four ESTs.
