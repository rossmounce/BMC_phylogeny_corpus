Independent evolution of intracellular transposons
from exogenous IAP-related retroviruses in a
broad range of mammalian species

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the descendants of
occasional germ line invasions by exogenous retroviruses.
Following these invasion events, some ERV lineages have
proliferated by viral reinfection whilst others have
become retrotransposon-like, losing the env gene which
is required for infectivity of viral particles. The processes
by which intracellular retrotransposons evolve from exogenous retroviruses remain poorly understood. The IAP
(Intracisternal A-type retroviral Particles) family of ERVs
provides an excellent model group in which to study this
phenomenon. First identified in the Mouse genome, this
well-defined and relatively recent group of ERVs have
been studied extensively in vivo. We mined 36 mammalian genomes for all IAP-like ERVs, finding a total of
4913 loci within 17 genomes, mostly in several rodent
species. Using these data, and taking in account the
known phylogeny of the hosts, we analysed how the
integrity of the env gene is related to the proliferation of
IAP lineages within the host genomes. We found that
loss of env is associated with the expansion of these
lineages; for example in the three largest expansions
accounting for more than 50% of the IAP-like loci, env
has suffered extensive degradation. Our findings indicate
that large copy number in IAP lineages is associated with
them becoming retrotransposon-like, a process which
could also apply to other, poorly studied, ERV groups.
We are currently trying to identify other factors that
influence this process and also to see how env loss affects
other processes such as host switching.
