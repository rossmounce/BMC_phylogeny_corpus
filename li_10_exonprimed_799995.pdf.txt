Exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) markers for
non-model teleost fishes
Chenhong Li1*†, Jean-Jack M Riethoven1,2, Lingbo Ma3*†

Abstract
Background: Exon-primed intron-crossing (EPIC) markers have three advantages over anonymous genomic
sequences in studying evolution of natural populations. First, the universal primers designed in exon regions can
be applied across a broad taxonomic range. Second, the homology of EPIC-amplified sequences can be easily
determined by comparing either their exon or intron portion depending on the genetic distance between the
taxa. Third, having both the exon and intron fragments could help in examining genetic variation at the
intraspecific and interspecific level simultaneously, particularly helpful when studying species complex. However,
the paucity of EPIC markers has hindered multilocus studies using nuclear gene sequences, particularly in teleost
fishes.
Results: We introduce a bioinformatics pipeline for developing EPIC markers by comparing the whole genome
sequences between two or more species. By applying this approach on five teleost fishes whose genomes were
available in the Ensembl database http://www.ensembl.org, we identified 210 EPIC markers that have single-copy
and conserved exon regions with identity greater than 85% among the five teleost fishes. We tested 12 randomly
chosen EPIC markers in nine teleost species having a wide phylogenetic range. The success rate of amplifying and
sequencing those markers varied from 44% to 100% in different species. We analyzed the exon sequences of the
12 EPIC markers from 13 teleosts. The resulting phylogeny contains many traditionally well-supported clades,
indicating the usefulness of the exon portion of EPIC markers in reconstructing species phylogeny, in addition to
the value of the intron portion of EPIC markers in interrogating the population history.
Conclusions: This study illustrated an effective approach to develop EPIC markers in a taxonomic group, where
two or more genome sequences are available. The markers identified could be amplified across a broad taxonomic
range of teleost fishes. The phylogenetic utility of individual markers varied according to intron size and
amplifiability. The bioinformatics pipelines developed are readily adapted to other taxonomic groups.

Background
Molecular studies aimed at understanding species limits
and population dynamics, are often thwarted by conflicting results arising from different markers. Although
mitochondrial genes are frequently used for detecting
genetic patterns in recently diverged populations [1],
multiple independent nuclear loci are generally thought
to provide more reliable estimates of the evolutionary
history of populations [2]. Not only do multilocus analyses provide better estimates of divergence times and

effective population sizes [3], but they also provide more
reliable estimates of species trees, one of the primary
goals of systematics. Gene trees are often affected by
factors other than divergence, such as incomplete lineage sorting and migration. The most widely accepted
way to sort out the historical signals from stochastic
effects of gene trees is to extract the common patterns
from many independent loci. In the same vein, in the
state of the art approaches for studying species delimitation and population dynamics, such as coalescence
based methods [4,5] and individual assignment tests
[6,7], have always emphasized using more loci.
One class of markers commonly used in such studies
are anonymous nuclear loci, For example, they have
been used to study demography of eastern fence lizard

[8] and statistical phylogeography of bird [3]. The major
drawback of such approaches is the effort that has to be
invested in developing the markers, which usually
involves extensive cloning and sequencing of genomic
DNA. In addition, the markers developed for one taxon
often cannot be applied to other taxa, due to the high
mutation rates in priming sites.
An alternative to anonymous nuclear markers is
intron sequence. Introns have been successfully used in
species-level studies [9-12]. The common strategy to
sequence introns is to design primers on adjacent exon
regions and amplify across the intron, so called exonprimed intron-crossing (EPIC) markers [13-15]. Because
exons are usually more conserved than introns and
most anonymous loci, the EPIC primers can generally
be applied across a wider taxonomic range of organisms.
An further advantage of EPIC markers is that having
both the exon and intron fragments can be useful for
examining genetic variation at the intraspecific and
interspecific level simultaneously, a feature that is particularly useful when studying species complexes. Having
both the exon and intron sequences also helps in assessing the orthology of collected sequences [16].
Development of molecular markers has benefited from
the growth of publicly accessible genomes and EST data
sets. A few bioinformatics tools have been successfully
used to explore the potential of intron markers in plants
[17,18]. Recently, Backström [19] developed intron markers for a non-model species, zebra finch (Taeniopygia
guttata), by comparing its expressed sequence tag (EST)
sequences with the genome sequences of chicken. The
success of this study demonstrates that genomic data
from a model organism can be used effectively to
develop EPIC markers for non-model species. These
resources “pave the way for easy multilocus study of
evolving populations and lineages of birds, and bring the
goal of quickly turning nonmodel species into ecological
genomic models tantalizingly close” [20].
The development and use of introns in fish studies,
however, are still sporadic [11,12,21,22] and few automated bioinformatics tools have been developed. On the
other hand, the genomic resources of fishes are much
more extensive than are those of birds. Currently, there
are five full genome sequences of fishes (Danio rerio,
Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Takifugu
rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis) curated at the
Ensembl genome browser http://www.ensembl.org.
These five fishes encompass a wide phylogenetic breadth
from the ostariophysans to tetraodontiforms. In addition, there are many EST sequences for other fish species available http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Using these
published fish genomes, Li et al. [23] have developed a
bioinformatics pipeline to identify single-copy and conserved exons for phylogenetics. The strategy they used

can be adapted to search for intron markers flanked by
single-copy and conserved exons. The objectives for our
particular study were: (1) to develop a bioinformatics
tool to search for intron markers flanked by single-copy
conserved exons; (2) to identify such markers for teleosts fish using the five published fish genomes; (3) to
design primers and survey a set of teleost fish using the
markers identified with our pipeline; (4) to investigate
the relationship between intron size, amplifiability and
genetic distance of target taxa in order to predict how
distantly related two taxa can be and still amplify for
the same markers.

Results
The bioinformatics tool and EPIC markers developed

We wrote Perl scripts to automate the pipelines (available upon request from C. Li). A well-annotated primary
genome is required as the query while one or more
reference genomes are needed as the subjects. We used
the genome of D. rerio as the query and the genomes of
O. latipes, G. aculeatus, T. rubripes and T. nigroviridis
as the references. It took 26 hours and 34 minutes CPU
time to complete the runs on a single core of a Dell
PowerEdge 1955 quad core E5345 machine. There were
137,640 large (≥ 100 bp) coding sequences (CDS) found
in D. rerio, from which 62,856 were identified as “singlecopy” (no other sequences having more than 20% coverage and more than 40% similar to itself). After comparison with the other four genomes and screening by the
intron size (≤ 1,000 bp in at least one species), 5051
EPIC markers were identified whose average identity in
the flanking exon regions was larger than 65% among
the five model species. When the required average identity of exons was increased to 80%, 2021 EPIC markers
were found. When average identity of exons was
increased to 85%, 210 EPIC markers were found (for the
description of these markers see Table 1 and Additional
file 1). From our previous experience in amplifying exon
sequences across a wide range of taxa, we found that
the markers worked well if the average identity was larger than 80%. So, potentially we could have thousands
of useable candidate EPIC markers across teleost fishes.
The parameter settings of the Perl scripts, such as the
maximum intron length, identity and coverage are interactive; thus, can be adjusted for each study by the user.
The bioinformatics tool developed in this study also was
applied in identifying EPIC markers for chondrichthyans, using human as the query and a low 1.4× coverage
genome of a chimaera (Callorhinchus milii) as the reference [24]. We used chimaera and human because chimaera is the only chondrichthyan with genome
sequence available and human is the best-annotated vertebrate genome. Five hundred candidate EPIC markers
were found from this comparison (unpublished data).

Only the first 12 markers tested in this study are listed. For the other markers see Additional file 1. The markers are named using the last five numbers of the
Ensembl gene name plus a sequential number to distinguish markers found in the same gene. The location information shown is from D. rerio.

This is quite a remarkable result given the poor coverage and quality of the chimaera genome data and its
evolutionary distance to human as a comparison.
The gene functions of the identified EPIC markers
seem not to be restricted to any particular type (Table 1
and Additional file 1). The chromosomal positions of
the 2021 EPIC markers with exon identity higher than
80% were mapped onto the 25 chromosomes of D. rerio
(Figure 1), showing a good coverage of the genome.
Intron size, amplifiability and the genetic distances
between the target taxa

We randomly picked 12 EPIC markers from the 210
candidates to test the utility of these markers in teleosts
(Table 1). One pair of primers was designed for each
marker (Table 2). Primers were designed to have similar
annealing temperatures, so that they would function
under the similar PCR conditions. The success rate for
amplifying these markers ranged from 44% to 100%,
with 4174E20 amplified in all taxa and 8680E2 and
40245E5 only amplified in four of the nine taxa tested
(Table 3). If we compare the success taxon-wise, both
D. rerio and Larimichthys crocea worked for all 12 markers, while Rhynogobius giurinus only worked for five
markers (Table 3).
At first glance, there appeared to be a positive relationship between variance in intron length and genetic
p-distance among taxa (r = 0.20, p-distance; Figure 2).
However, this relationship might be an artifact caused
by the low variance in intron size when the p-distance
was less than or equal to 0.03 and the generally higher
difference in intron size when the p-distance was larger
than 0.03 (Figure 2). In other words, closely related species had very similar intron size, whereas distantly

related species (p-distance ≥ 0.03) generally had large
difference in intron size; however, this difference did not
continue to become larger with further increased genetic
distance.
If a suite of EPIC markers worked in one taxon, to predict whether we could use them in other taxa, we calculated the correlation between the amplifiability and the
genetic p-distance between the taxa. A non-significant
negative correlation was seen in our results (r = -0.24,
p > 0.05; Figure 3). If the p-distance was less than or
equal to 0.06 (the crosses in Figure 3), the success of
amplifying EPIC in one taxon could be extended to the
other taxa. But when the p-distance was larger than 0.06,
the success in one taxon was not a good predictor for
how the markers worked in the other taxa (Figure 3).
Phylogenetic inference based on the exon portion of
EPIC loci

The concatenated sequences of the exon regions of the
12 EPIC markers totalled 3195 bp, with each marker
varying from 207 bp to 324 bp. Bayesian analysis and
ML analysis resulted in the same phylogeny (Figure 4).
Many well-recognized clades in classic taxonomy were
highly supported in the resulting phylogeny, such as
Tetraodontiformes, Gobioidei, Cypriniformes and Percomorpha, all marked by the high Bayesian posterior probabilities and bootstrap support (Figure 4). These
consistent results in the phylogeny reconstruction suggest that the exon portion of EPIC marker is useful for
inferring phylogenetic relationships.

Discussion
Wiens [25] described a “wish list” for the ideal method
in delimiting species. He suggested that such a method

“considers both incomplete lineage sorting and gene
flow among populations, can integrate data from multiple loci, can determine species limits without having
those limits defined a priori (i.e., it will allow one to discover unanticipated species from the molecular data),
and can allow one to estimate the statistical support for
species-level decisions”. If we think thoroughly about
what kind of data are necessary to achieve such goals,
we are always led to multilocus data. For example, many
independent loci can sort out the signal of population
divergence from gene flow or random lineage sorting.
Individual based assignment tests, without the need of
defining populations a priori, all require multilocus data
and the power of those methods is highly dependent on
the number of loci available [6,7].
As mitochondrial loci typically are linked in vertebrates, they essentially act as a single locus, which precludes them as the sole data source for multilocus
population studies. Single-copy nuclear polymorphic
sequences are widely regarded as the marker of choice;
but even these markers are not free of obstacles, such as
the availability of the markers and technical hurdles in
resolving haplotypes [26]. A good nuclear marker for

studies at the species-level should be amplifiable across
different taxonomic groups and the target sequence
should exhibit reasonable variation at the intraspecific
level [26]. EPIC markers seem to be a natural fit to this
description. The conserved exon portion of EPIC markers improves the versatility of primer amplification
across taxa whereas the more variable intron portion
provides variation for intraspecific studies. On the other
hand, our approach, focusing on single-copy and conserved coding sequence to facilitate universal primers
design and homolog identification, is a biased representation of the whole genome. However, the sequence
conservation in the exonic part of the gene does not
necessarily suggest a slow evolutionary rate in the intronic part of the gene. Nevertheless, one study showed
that introns had a low average genetic diversity relative
to anonymous loci in birds [3]; another study found a
correlation between the evolutionary rate of exons and
non-coding regions in Drosophila melanogaster [27].

Therefore, the limitation of variation in EPIC marker
and the correlation between the rate of its intron and
exon portion await more scrutiny from empirical
studies.
Nonetheless, two of the obstacles in applying singlecopy nuclear polymorphic sequence in population studies can now be overcome due to recent developments
in genomics and high throughput sequencing techniques. First, due to the fast accumulation of public accessible genome sequences and EST databases, mining
genetic markers in silico has never been easier, as
shown by this study. Currently, the Ensembl genome
browser maintains more than 51 genome assemblages
(http://www.ensembl.org, as of Nov 2009), while GenBank holds 63,463,018 EST records (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/, as of Nov 2009). Methods based on comparison between two or more genomes or between one
genome and the EST sequences have been developed for
plants, birds and fishes [16-19,23,28,29]. The worries

Li et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:90
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/90

about the versatility of EPIC markers applying across
different taxa [30] and the difficulties in developing such
markers [26] should be alleviated now. Due to the limited genomic resources, the early approaches often utilized both the genome and EST sequences available at
the time [17,19]. Since EST sequences do not contain
the information about introns and are usually incomplete, the EPIC markers developed from EST will likely
be of a lower quality, such as multiple copies in the genome and less predictable in the size of the markers,
which might require more lab work in screening steps
for finding the good markers.
The other technical hurdle for utilizing intron
sequences is how to resolve haplotypes. As the markers
for studies at the species level, high polymorphism can
exist within species and among alleles in EPIC markers.
Strictly speaking, the alleles of diploid individuals have to
be determined before performing any meaningful species
level analysis. There are experimental methods to resolve
haplotypes, such as cloning, gel extraction, “allele-dropout-effect” and SSCP [26], all of which demand considerable laboratory effort. Alternatively, haplotypes can be
resolved statistically, using the software packages such as
PHASE [31]. However, physically separating the two
alleles is usually the only choice, if there is length variation between them, so called length variant heterozygote
(LVH) [32]. A new solution to separating sequences from
two alleles is using the next-generation sequencing. New
developments in the next-generation sequencing [33], in
theory allow for the two alleles in each individual to be
sequenced in parallel simultaneously, avoiding the extensive cloning steps. The current challenge is to design
ways of tagging DNA to facilitate sequencing many genes
and many individuals in one run [34-36].
We aimed to develop a list of candidate markers for
studying closely related species or populations for any
group of teleost fish, especially the non-model species.
Thus, we designed primers on alignments of all five fish
genomes to increase to success rate of amplification in
any teleosts. If we were interested in a particular group
of teleosts, for example, gasterosteiforms, we could have
used Gasterosteus aculeatus as the query and use Oryzias latipes as the reference to increase the specificity of
resulting primers, but those primers might only applicable to that group of fishes. Since our primers were
designed on conserved exonic part of the gene, using all
five genomes provided good priming sites for designing
universal primer, which can be applied to other nonmodel teleosts. There are only a handful of model
organisms for which whole genome sequences are available, so our approach is particularly important for developing markers in non-model organisms. Our results
show that several markers amplified distantly related
non-model teleosts.

The putative “whole-genome duplication” events at
the base of teleosts could have serious impact in ortholog identification. It is especially problematic if differential gene loss happened in different lineages after the
genome duplication [23]. Nevertheless, we intended to
develop single-copy markers for studying closely related
species or populations, so the differential gene loss
would have less detrimental effects, i.e., the gene copy is
most probably orthologous in closely related species or
different individuals of the same species. If one pair of
primers resulted in multiple fragments in a particular
species possibly due to gene duplication, the marker
should be discarded for that species.
In our experiment, we tested 12 candidate markers in
nine distantly related teleost fishes to illustrate the
broad taxonomic usage of those markers. We found that
five to 12 of the markers amplified different species,
leaving some missing data. Although this test case
served as an illustration for how these markers might
work across taxa, it was not a typical study, in which
closely related species or populations are examined. In
such cases, similar set of loci should amplify equally
well in different individuals or species, as shown in our
results (Table 3, Figure 3); thus, resulting in less or no
missing data.

Conclusions
We developed an efficient strategy for mining EPIC
markers by comparing genome sequences. Applying the
bioinformatic tools developed in this study, we found
thousands of candidate EPIC markers in teleost fishes.
By testing some of the candidate markers, we illustrated
the usefulness of these markers in a broad range of teleost taxa. The strategy and the bioinformatic tools we
developed are readily adapted for other taxonomic
groups.
Method
Marker development

We designed a pipeline to identify short introns (< 1,000
bp in at least one taxon) bounded by single-copy and
conserved exons (Figure 5). First, we took a strategy
similar to Li et al. [23] in spotting the single-copy and
conserved exons. Two important modifications were
made in this study: (1) the coding sequence (CDS) was
used instead of the full exon sequence, because sometimes the 5’- or 3’- untranslated regions (UTR) of the
exons are too variable among distantly related taxa, and
can obscure the true conserveness between CDS; (2) we
lowered the penalty score for mismatch from -3 to -1 in
the BLAST [37] alignment step, so the comparison of
CDS can be extended over occasionally low-matched
regions. Both modifications were essential in achieving
better results. After locating the single-copy conserved

available upon request (correspondence to C. Li).

exons, we screened for exons flanking the intron, which
is smaller than 1,000 bp in at least one of the compared
genomes, in order to facilitate the subsequent PCR and
sequencing steps (Figure 5). If multiple EPIC markers
are present within the range of 1,000 bp, we report the
whole region as one marker. After being identified as
candidate markers, the fasta sequences of the markers
were retrieved from each genome. All of the above steps
were automated using Perl scripts.

The exon portion of each sequence was aligned using
ClustalW [38] implemented in MEGA4 [39]. PriFi [40]
was used to find the optimal regions for designing primers
on the aligned sequences. Primers were designed by eye
and checked with Primer3 [41]. Whenever possible, the 3’
end of the primers was designed on the 1st or 2nd codon
position and the number of mismatches in the last five
nucleotides of 3’ end of the primers also was minimized,
in order to increase annealing accuracy of the primers.

In vitro marker validation

Twelve randomly selected EPIC markers were tested in
nine teleost fishes (Table 1 and 2). The species related
to the current research interests of the authors
were used, but they also were chosen to cover a
broad phylogenetic range. Danio rerio was used as the
positive control. In addition, two other cypriniforms
(Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and H. nobilis), one clupeiforms (Thryssa hamiltonii) and five perciforms (Larimichthys crocea, Sinperca chuatsi, Odontobutis
potamophila, Micropercops swinhonis and Rhynogobius
giurinus) were picked. As deliberately designed, we had
a taxon (T. hamiltonii) diverged from the others at
about 307 million years ago [42], several families, two
closely related genera (Odontobutis and Micropercops)
and two congeneric species (H. molitrix and H. nobilis),
so the selected taxa covered a broad range of genetic
distance.
DNA samples were extracted from muscle tissues or
fin clips using a standard phenol-chloroform methods
[43]. All PCR were performed in a total volume of 20
μl, including 0.1 μl TaKaRa Taq™ (Takara, Shanghai,
China), 2.0 μl 10 × PCR buffer (+ MgCl2), 1.6 μl dNTP
Mixture (2.5 mM each dNTP), 0.64 μl forward and
reverse primers respectively, 0.8 μl DNA template and
14.22 μl distilled water. The PCR reactions were carried
out in an Eppendorf Mastercycler with silver block
(Eppendorf China Ltd, Shanghai, China). The PCR program consisted of a 95°C initial heating for 30 sec, 15
cycles of 98°C for 10 sec, 60°C for 30 sec and 72°C for
45 sec, 15 cycles of 98°C for 10 sec, 58°C for 30 sec and
72°C for 45 sec, followed by a final extension at 72°C
for 5 min. The PCR products were visualized on agarose
gels. The amplified products were sequenced by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services Co, Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Data analysis

The sequences determined in this study and the
sequences of the model species retrieved from the
Ensembl database were aligned to each other via ClustalW [38]. Because of the large genetic distance among
most tested species, the intron sequences were not
alignable except for the congeneric species (H. molitrix
and H. nobilis) and two closely related genera (O. potamophila and M. swinhonis). Therefore, the alignment
was made only on the exon parts of EPIC sequences
and the size of introns was recorded. The exon
sequences were translated into amino acid to be aligned
using ClustalW [38] implemented in MEGA4 [39]; then,
the aligned sequences were translated back into
nucleotides.
Pairwise p-distances [44] were estimated for all taxa
based on the concatenated exon sequences of the 12

Page 10 of 12

EPIC markers using MEGA4 [39]. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the difference in intron size and
the genetic distance of every taxon-pair was estimated
using the SAS program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). Similarly, the correlation coefficient between the
difference in amplifiability for the same suite of markers
in two taxa and the genetic distance between them was
also calculated. The difference in amplifiability for taxon
i and taxon j was defined as:
DA ij 

N mi  m j
N mi  m j

,

in which, DAij is the difference of amplifiability between
taxon i and taxon j; N mi m j is the number of markers
amplified in both taxon i and taxon j, while N mi m j is
the number of markers amplified in any of the two taxa.
The value of DAij could range from 0 (no shared markers) to 1 (all markers are shared). One important practical question we might have is that if we know certain
EPIC markers worked for one species, can we apply the
same markers on other species? Or how close two species should be related to ensure the same markers
work? We calculated the correlation between the
amplifiability and the genetic distance among species,
and the correlation between the intron size and the
genetic distance in order to address this question.
Finally, we tested the utility of the exon parts of the
12 EPIC markers in reconstructing the species phylogeny. The exon sequences from 13 species (9 determined in this study plus 4 retrieved from Ensembl) were
concatenated. The concatenated sequences were partitioned by codon positions, because the exon sequences
collected for each gene were short (≈ 200 - 300 bp) in
this study and not enough sites could be used if we partition them by both codon and gene. It also has been
shown that most heterogeneity often could be captured
through partitioning by codon position [45]. The optimal model for each data partition was selected by using
the “propose model” analysis in TreeFinder [46]. Partitioned Bayesian analyses were carried out using MrBayes
[47]. The closest models to the TreeFinder selected
models were applied in Bayesian analysis. Two independent runs, with 8 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
per run were performed for Bayesian analysis. The heating parameter was set as “temp = 0.1” to improve the
mixing of the MCMC. The runs were terminated after
10 million generations with a sampling frequency of 1
in 1000 (10,000 trees save for each run). After discarding the burnin samples (1000 trees from each run), 50%
majority rule tree was calculated using sumt. Maximum
likelihood phylogeny was searched using TreeFinder
using the best models for each data partition. Bootstrap

analysis with 1000 replications was performed to assess
the statistical support for each node of the ML tree.
The resulting phylogeny was graphed using Dendroscope [48].
