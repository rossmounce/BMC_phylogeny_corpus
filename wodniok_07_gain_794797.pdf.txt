Abstract
Background: The Viridiplantae (green algae and land plants) consist of two monophyletic lineages:
the Chlorophyta and the Streptophyta. Most green algae belong to the Chlorophyta, while the
Streptophyta include all land plants and a small group of freshwater algae known as Charophyceae.
Eukaryotes attach a poly-A tail to the 3' ends of most nuclear-encoded mRNAs. In embryophytes,
animals and fungi, the signal for polyadenylation contains an A-rich sequence (often AAUAAA or
related sequence) 13 to 30 nucleotides upstream from the cleavage site, which is commonly
referred to as the near upstream element (NUE). However, it has been reported that the
pentanucleotide UGUAA is used as polyadenylation signal for some genes in volvocalean algae.
Results: We set out to investigate polyadenylation signal differences between streptophytes and
chlorophytes that may have emerged shortly after the evolutionary split between Streptophyta and
Chlorophyta. We therefore analyzed expressed genes (ESTs) from three streptophyte algae,
Mesostigma viride, Klebsormidium subtile and Coleochaete scutata, and from two early-branching
chlorophytes, Pyramimonas parkeae and Scherffelia dubia. In addition, to extend the database, our
analyses included ESTs from six other chlorophytes (Acetabularia acetabulum, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, Helicosporidium sp. ex Simulium jonesii, Prototheca wickerhamii, Scenedesmus obliquus and
Ulva linza) and one streptophyte (Closterium peracerosum). Our results indicate that polyadenylation
signals in green algae vary widely. The UGUAA motif is confined to late-branching Chlorophyta.
Most streptophyte algae do not have an A-rich sequence motif like that in embryophytes, animals
and fungi. We observed polyadenylation signals similar to those of Arabidopsis and other land plants
only in Mesostigma.
Conclusion: Polyadenylation signals in green algae show considerable variation. A new NUE
(UGUAA) was invented in derived chlorophytes and replaced not only the A-rich NUE but the
complete poly(A) signal in all chlorophytes investigated except Scherffelia (only NUE replaced) and
Pyramimonas (UGUAA completely missing). The UGUAA element is completely absent from
streptophytes. However, the structure of the poly(A) signal was often modified in streptophyte
algae. In most species investigated, an A-rich NUE is missing; instead, these species seem to rely
mainly on U-rich elements.

Background
In eukaryotes, a polyadenylate tail [poly(A)] is attached to
the cleaved 3' end of the nuclear-encoded precursor
mRNA of most genes [1]. Polyadenylation is important
for the regulation of mRNA stability and also affects translational capacity [2]. The general mechanism of polyadenylation is well understood in yeast and animals [3]. It
requires two major components: poly(A) signals (cis-elements) on the pre-mRNA, and a protein complex (transacting factors) that carries out the cleavage of the premRNA and the addition of the poly(A). The protein complex is conserved among organisms, but the poly(A) signals show considerable variation among species.
Five classes of cis-acting DNA elements have been identified [4-6] that facilitate polyadenylation: a far upstream
element (FUE), a near upstream element (NUE), the
cleavage site (CS) and a downstream element (DSE). The
CS is surrounded by a cleavage element (CE) in Arabidopsis
[CE, 4]. The FUE is generally U-rich. There are one or more
NUEs, often AAUAAA or a related sequence 13 to 30 nt
upstream of the CS (in the following, nucleotide positions
are always given relative to the CS), each peculiar to its
own cleavage site (CS). Only in animals is there an additional DSE [5,7-9] and the NUE AAUAAA is the major
polyadenylation element. In contrast, in embryophytes
(land plants), the strict AAUAAA element becomes a
minor component and is replaced by variable A-rich
sequences. Recently, Loke et al. [4] analyzed mRNA polyadenylation in Arabidopsis using the genome sequence and
all available cDNAs. They confirmed the absence of
highly-conserved consensus signal patterns and showed
that in Arabidopsis the poly(A) signal consists of a U-rich
FUE (-25 to -160), an A-rich NUE (about – 20) and CE.
The CE consists of U-rich sequences on both sides of the
CS. Furthermore, they presented evidence for the formation of secondary RNA structures in the 3'-UTR. Because
known mutations in these regions affect polyadenylation,
Loke et al. [4] suggested that the secondary structures
might play an important role in the process.
The Viridiplantae (literally meaning green plants), which
include all green algae and embryophyte plants, represent
a monophyletic group of organisms, which display a surprising diversity in respect of morphology, cell architecture, life histories and reproduction, and in their
biochemistry. The Viridiplantae consist of two monophyletic lineages: the Chlorophyta and the Streptophyta
[10]. The Chlorophyta comprise the vast majority of green
algae including most scaly green flagellates (e.g. Pyramimonas, Tetraselmis), the Ulvophyceae (e.g. Ulva, Acetabularia), Chlorophyceae (e.g. Chlamydomonas, Volvox) and
Trebouxiophyceae (e.g. Chlorella) [11-13]. The Streptophyta include all embryophyte plants and a diverse paraphyletic assemblage of freshwater green algae, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/65

Mesostigmatales, Chlorokybales, Klebsormidiales, Zygnematales, Coleochaetales and Charales (stoneworts)
[13,14]. The Charales are widely believed to be the sister
group of the embryophytes, suggesting that the evolution
of true land plants started with an already complex organism [15]. However, the position of the Charales is still
controversial [16]. Remarkably, only a single scaly green
flagellate, Mesostigma viride Lauterborn, has been found to
belong to the Streptophyta [17-20].
For a few chlorophyte mRNAs (mainly tubulins) an alternative polyadenylation signal (UGUAA) has been suggested [21-24], and it has been proposed that
chlorophytes generally use the UGUAA motif instead of
AAUAAA as NUE [25]. So far, UGUAA has only been
found in chlorophyte algae, which are thought to have
branched deeply from the last common ancestor of
Viridiplantae [20]. To test whether UGUAA might be a
chlorophyte-specific poly(A) signal we have analyzed the
ESTs of chlorophyte and streptophyte algae available from
public databases. To include more and especially earlybranching species, we have sequenced ESTs from the flagellate Mesostigma viride [18], the filamentous algae Klebsormidium subtile and Coleochaete scutata, the flagellate
Pyramimonas parkeae and the thecate flagellate Scherffelia
dubia [26]. The first three are streptophytes, whereas the
latter two represent chlorophytes. Our results indicate that
derived chlorophyte algae use mainly UGUAA, whereas
most streptophyte algae prefer U-rich sequences. Interestingly, only in Mesostigma have we found a polyadenylation signal similar to that in Arabidopsis and other
embryophytes.

Results
Data sets used
We sequenced ESTs from cDNA libraries for Mesostigma
viride [18], Klebsormidium subtile, Coleochaete scutata,
Pyramimonas parkeae and Scherffelia dubia. Details on the
preparation and assembly of contigs are given in Materials
and Methods. To extend our database on polyadenylation
in green algae, all ESTs from chlorophyte and streptophyte
algae were downloaded from GenBank and TIGR (June
2006). To perform our analysis we relied on information
about the orientation of EST sequence data. Thus, only
data in which the polyA tail indicated the orientation
could be used. For this reason, we could include only the
following organismal data sets: Chlamydomonas, Helicosporidium, Acetabularia, Prototheca, Ulva, Scenedesmus (all
chlorophytes) and Closterium (streptophyte). For each data
set, the origin, total number of RNAs and number of nonredundant poly(A)-containing mRNAs, and the base compositions of the 200 nt upstream from the CS, are given in
Table 1.

Positional nucleotide frequencies upstream of the CS
For all data sets, we established the 1 nt pattern of the 200
nt upstream from the CS and the frequencies of pentaand hexanucleotide words within the first 50 nt upstream
from the CS. The 1 nt patterns of selected genera are
shown in Fig. 1.

For all organisms, we observed a clear change in nucleotide frequencies around 20 nt upstream from the CS (Fig.
1) indicative of a putative poly(A) signal. In all chlorophytes except Pyramimonas, there is a sharp peak of U followed by sharp peak of A. In contrast, in Pyramimonas and
all streptophytes, we observed a broad peak of U followed
by peaks of A and then U again. These changes are easier
to see in large organismal data sets than in small ones, as
variations in nucleotide frequencies at individual positions relative to the CS are higher in the latter. For this reason the curves presented in Fig 1 were smoothed using the
weighted average of 5 neighbors method. The original
point graphs are available as Fig. S1 [see Additional file 1].
Poly(A) signals in Chlorophyta
A short Python program (available from the authors) was
written to scan the 50 nt upstream from the CS for the
occurrence of penta- and hexanucleotide words in the various organismal data sets. The base composition differs
considerably among the various chlorophytes (Table 1).
For this reason, the frequency of the UGUAA-motif
expected by chance within 50 nt upstream from the CS
varies between 2 and 12%. To test whether the observed
over-representation of penta- and hexanucleotide words
was statistically significant, we calculated the log odds
ratio (lnω) and its 95% confidence interval for each word
[27, see Methods for details]). Table S1 [see Additional file
2] lists all penta- and hexanucleotide words for each
organism that are at least 2.7 times (lnω > 1) more frequent than expected by chance and for which the overrepresentation is statistically significant. Many penta- and
hexanucleotide words fulfilling this criteria show considerable overlap and can be arranged into a few clusters centered on the most significantly over-represented word [see
Additional file 2]. Some of these clusters occur in frequencies too low (although statistically significant) to be considered as putative polyadenylation signals and might
represent regulatory sites for a subset of mRNAs from an
organism. Further analysis is required to investigate this
possibility.

Table 2 lists the two most significantly over-represented
penta- and hexanucleotide words for each organism. It is
evident from this table that UGUAA is the top pentanucleotide pattern in all chlorophytes except Pyramimonas. On
average, about 60% of the sequences contain an UGUAA
motif within 50 nucleotides upstream from the CS. The
second to sixth most frequent pentanucleotide words

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/65

overlap with UGUAA [see Additional file 2], highlighting
the importance of this motif. NUE are generally found
around -15 to -20 nt upstream from the CS. To test
whether the UGUAA motif shows a similar distribution,
we plotted the percentage of sequences within an organismal data set containing an UGUAA motif at a certain position upstream of the CS against the position relative to the
CS. Fig 2 shows the results. In all chlorophytes except
Pyramimonas, the UGUAA motif peaks sharply around
position -17.
In chlorophytes, the AAUAAA poly(A) signal was
observed among the top 50 hexanucleotide words within
50 nt upstream from the CS only in Scherffelia [see Additional file 2]. We found AAUAAA in 10% of the sequences
from Scherffelia investigated (1.2% expected by chance).
This observed over-representation of the AAUAAA motif is
statistically significant [see Additional file 2]. However, in
Scherffelia, the AAUAAA motif shows a broad distribution
and is not restricted to positions -13 to -20 [see Additional
file 3]. Similarly, we observed a statistically significant
increase of U-rich sequences between -1 and -50 upstream
from the CS only for Pyramimonas (Table 1) and Scherffelia
(UUUUA: found in 13.5%, expected 2.4%). Again, the Urich sequences showed a broad distribution within the 50
nt upstream from the CS (Fig. 2).
Poly(A) signals in streptophyte algae
In all streptophyte algae analyzed, the chlorophyte-specific UGUAA-motif was present more often within 50 nt
upstream from the CS than expected by chance [see Additional file 2]. The over-representation of UGUAA is statistically significant, but the UGUAA-motif showed a more
or less random distribution between -1 and -50 nt
upstream from the CS [see Additional file 1] for all four
streptophyte algae.

We observed significant numbers of the AAUAAA motif
only for Mesostigma, Closterium and Coleochaete, whereas it
was not over-represented between -1 and -50 upstream
from the CS in Klebsormidium. However, AAUAAA was
enriched between -13 and -25 nt upstream from the CS
only in Mesostigma (Fig. 2). Some single base variations
(UAUAAA and AAUUAA) show the same distribution as
the motif AAUAAA within 50 nt upstream from the CS,
indicating that AAUAAA-like sequences might function as
a NUE of the poly(A) signal in Mesostigma in the same way
as in land plants. In all streptophyte algae, we observed
significant increases in U-rich sequences around -10 and 30 to -40 nt upstream from the CS (Fig. 2).
Number of NUE per transcript
On average, about 8.2 % of the contigs from chlorophytes
(except Pyramimonas) and Mesostigma contained more
than a single copy of the putative poly (A) signals UGUAA

or AAUAAA, respectively, within 50 nt upstream from the
CS (Table 3). Inspection of the mRNAs comprising these
contigs revealed that about 15% of those with two putative poly(A) signals (0.5 % of all contigs) were assembled
from two mRNA species differing only in the positions of
their poly(A) tails (Table 3). In all cases, one polyadenylation site seemed to be preferred over the other.

Discussion
Analysis of the 3'-UTRs of a large set of genes from different chlorophytes and streptophytes revealed major differences in putative polyadenylation signals between
chlorophyte and streptophyte algae. Both AAUAAA and
UGUAA motifs have previously been described as possible NUE motifs in green algae [25][28]. However, it was

not clear how these motifs were distributed phylogenetically. We detected a clear putative AAUAAA-like NUE only
in Mesostigma. The other streptophyte algae investigated
seem to have lost the AAUAAA-like NUEs, although a
weak enrichment of A around position -17 can still be
detected in 1 nt positional frequency plots (Fig. 1). We
found the UGUAA motif in all chlorophytes except
Pyramimonas. The UGUAA motif in chlorophytes was not
randomly distributed within the 50 nt upstream from the
CS investigated, but showed a clear peak at -10 to -30
upstream from the CS. Although there is currently no
experimental proof that UGUAA is a poly(A) signal, its
narrow distribution and its presence in all chlorophytes
investigated except Pyramimonas is a strong indication that
this signal is indeed functional and plays a role in mRNA

processing. It could be argued that some data sets are still
too small to identify poly(A) signals. Indeed, if we had
used only a single data set (e.g. the 28 Acetabularia
sequences) we could not have drawn this conclusion.
However, the over-representation and narrow distribution of UGUAA within 50 nt upstream of the CS in 7 different
chlorophytes
(including
chlorophycean,
ulvophycean, trebouxiophycean algae) that vary greatly in
GC content (Table 1) make us confident that UGUAA is
probably a true polyadenylation signal.
For some species we lowered the criterion for recognizing
a poly(A) tail to a stretch of 5 terminal adenines. This was
required because many researchers trim their poly(A)
tails. For example, in the original Chlamydomonas Gene
Index as downloaded from TIGR, only 7 out of 31608

sequences contained a stretch of 10 or more terminal
adenines. Lowering the criterion to a stretch of 5 terminal
adenines and including sequences that start with oligo (T)
stretches (possibly representing the reverse complement
of mRNAs) increased the number to 10508 sequences.
Manual inspection revealed that many of these sequences
contained the putative UGUAA poly(A) signal, and
indeed we detected the UGUAA motif between -10 and 30 from the CS in about 50% of the sequences. However,
as a stretch of 5 adenines can also be found in proteincoding sequences, we cannot exclude the possibility that
our data set includes some internal sequences from
mRNAs rather than the poly(A)-preceding sequence.
Therefore, some of the numbers presented for the organismal data sets downloaded from public databases, which
include all late-branching chlorophytes, might actually be

too low, making the number of mRNAs possessing the
UGUAA motif even higher.
It has been shown that A-rich NUE are necessary for polyadenylation in embryophytes and animals [3,7]. In yeast,
U-rich upstream elements are even more important than
the NUEs for facilitating polyadenylation [29]. These
FUEs are also found in animals and embryophytes [5,6].
The absence of U-rich sequences in the 250 nt upstream
from the CS in Chlamydomonas and other chlorophytes
may indicate that the putative UGUAA-sequence-dependent polyadenylation involves a different mechanism than
from A-rich NUE-dependent polyadenylation, although
homologues to the known protein machinery for polyadenylation in other eukaryotes can be detected in the
Chlamydomonas genome. Alternatively, other sequence
motifs may be required in addition to the UGUAA signals
for proper polyadenylation, although we failed to detect
other nucleotide words that were significantly enriched in
all chlorophytes.
No clear NUE (AAUAAA-like or UGUAA) is present in
Closterium, Klebsormidium or Coleochaete. The lack of a
UGUAA motif appears to be a general feature of streptophytes as this sequence motif was also not detected in
Mesostigma (this study), Arabidopsis or rice [4,5]. Given the
presence of AAUAAA-like NUE in Mesostigma (this study)
and land plants [4,5,8], its complete absence from the
other streptophyte algae is surprising. Instead, the
sequence motifs most often found are U-rich. We propose
that these sequence motifs represent FUEs facilitating
polyadenylation, as in yeast [5,29]. However, the number
of mRNAs with a poly(A) tail investigated is still rather
low for these species and there is still no direct proof for
the proposed function of U-rich sequences in Closterium,
Klebsormidium and Coleochaete. In addition, it is known
that auto-correlated sequences such as oligo(U) show
increased variance, i.e. there is a higher probability of
observing higher or lower word counts than expected

[30]. Therefore, the significance of the occurrence of such
auto-correlated patterns in our analyses is not yet clear, as
we cannot exclude the possibility that a NUE could be
detected in a larger data set for each organism. In this context, it would be most interesting to know the structures of
polyadenylation signals in the Charales. Currently, the
Charales are considered to be a sister group to the embryophyte lineage [15]. EST-projects for two Chara strains are
underway in Japan and the United States; however, no
data have been released yet into the public domain. At
present, only 28 mRNAs from Chara species can be found
in Genbank, and a clear poly(A)-tail is recognizable only
for the nuclear-encoded GAPDHB from Chara vulgaris
[31]. This sequence does not contain either UGUAA or
AAUAAA within 50 nt upstream from the CS. However, a
U-rich region is present about 60 nt upstream from the
CS. Whether this is typical for the Charales as for Klebsormidium and Coleochaete remains to be seen.
In plants and algae, the usage of multiple polyadenylation
signals within a single gene, leading to different mRNA
species, has been reported [7,32]. As we observed this
phenomenon only in 0.5% of the contigs (expressed
genes) investigated, it may not be prominent within green
algae. Another type of mRNA variation observed in mammals is the use of different CS downstream from a single
polyadenylation signal [33]. In mammals, this seems to
occur in a considerable percentage (22–44%) of cases
[33]. Polyadenylation heterogeneity is tissue-specific in
mammals [34] and has been related to mRNA stability
and/or translation efficiency [34]. We encountered only
one similar situation during our study. For the rbcs gene
from Scherffelia we observed two mRNA species. In one of
these (35% of sequenced ESTs), polyadenylation started
14 nt downstream from the UGUAA motif; in the other
(65% of sequenced ESTs), it started 26 nt downstream
from the same UGUAA motif. We do not yet know the
functional significance of this finding or whether it is a
common phenomenon in green algae.

Fig. 3 summarizes our findings concerning the occurrence
of poly(A) signals in the Viridiplantae in an evolutionary
context. Two scenarios for the evolution of poly(A) signals
in Viridiplantae seem possible. In the first (presented in
Fig. 3), the present-day embryophyte signals were already
present in the last common ancestor and were lost differentially during the evolution of the different green algal
lineages. Only the direct phylogenetic lineage to Mesostigma conserved this motif set. Concurrently, the
UGUAA signal evolved as a replacement in the Chlorophyte lineage. In the second scenario, polyadenylation in
the last common ancestor depended only on U-rich
sequences. Then two different additional signals evolved,
constituting either an addition to the existing signals
(embryophytes) or replacing them (Chlorophyta). We
favor the first scenario for the following reason. Polyadenylation is a typical eukaryotic feature and therefore evolutionarily old. Animals, plants and fungi use AAUAAA or

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/65

A-rich sequences as NUE, and U-rich sequences as additional elements [see introduction for details, see also
[6]]). Therefore, either plants, animals and fungi inherited
the general structure of the polyadenylation signals from
their last common ancestor, or the similar structures of
their poly(A) signals indicate convergent evolution. The
latter hypothesis seems to us less likely.
If the first scenario outlined above is correct, the proposed
replacement of AAUAAA with UGUAA in chlorophytes
occurred stepwise and early during chlorophyte evolution. The A-rich NUE was lost in Pyramimonas, UGUAA
and U-rich elements are present in Scherffelia, and
UGUAA is present and U-rich elements are absent in all
the other late branching chlorophytes investigated. Once
the UGA motif was established in late branching chlorophytes, it seems to have been under strong evolutionary
pressure, as it has changed so little in the various chloro-

phyte lineages (compare the observed variation in streptophytes). The gain of the UGUAA-motif as poly(A) signal
in Scherffelia correlates with major evolutionary transitions such as the conversion of an extracellular matrix
consisting of scales into a cell wall, changes in mitosis and
cytokinesis and other major cellular changes [12,13,35].
Our finding that Scherffelia (a member of the Chlorodendrales), like the other late-branching chlorophyte classes
Ulvophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Chlorophyceae
(UTC clade), possesses a UGUAA-motif in the 3'UTR supports the sister relationship between the Chlorodendrales
and the UTC clade as revealed my molecular phylogenetic
analyses [13]. The shared derived change in polyadenylation mechanism might represent the first synapomorphic
character uniting the Chlorodendrales and the UTC clade.

Conclusion
Our results show that putative poly(A) signals may vary
considerably among organisms. In chlorophytes (except
Pyramimonas) the A-rich NUE was completely replaced by
the UGUAA-motif, which represents a synampomorphic
character of the Chlorodendrales and the UTC-clade. Also,
the structure of the poly(A) signal was modified in many
streptophytes. There is no A-rich NUE and the organisms
seem to rely exclusively on U-rich elements.

Methods
Data selection
We retrieved all available EST sequences for Acetabularia
acetabulum, Closterium peracerosum, Helicosporidium sp. ex
Simulium jonesii, Prototheca wickerhamii, Scenedesmus
obliquus, and Ulva linza from Genbank. The
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Gene index was downloaded
from the TIGR database. Additional ESTs were sequenced
for Scherffelia dubia using the cDNA library described in
Becker et al. [26]. The sequences were deposited in EMBL/
Genbank under the accession nos. AJ919283 – AJ919992.
We prepared cDNA-libraries from Pyramimonas parkeae
(M1663, courtesy of Prof. Dr. M. Melkonian, Botanical
Institute, University of Cologne), Klebsormidium subtile
(CCAC 0119, Culture Collection of Algae at the University
of Cologne) and Coleochaete scutata (M0493, courtesy of
Prof. Dr. M. Melkonian, Botanical Institute, University of
Cologne) as follows. Klebsormidium subtile and Coleochaete
scutata were cultured in modified WARIS solution as
described by Simon et al. [18]. Pyramimonas parkeae was
cultured in modified ASP medium [36]. mRNA was isolated from interphase cultures using the mRNA Isolation
Kit (Roche Applied Science). mRNAs (50 ng) were converted into cDNA using the CapFishing™Full-length cDNA
Premix Kit (Seegene) and then amplified by PCR with
either of the following primer combinations: 5'-RACE
(Seegene) and (5'-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTN3') (Coleochaete
scutata), or 3'-RACE (Seegene) and C1 (5'NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNATG-3') (Klebsormidium subtile

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/65

and Pyramimonas parkeae). cDNA was size-fractioned by
agarose gel electrophoresis and the smear between 500
bp-5000 bp was isolated and cloned into pGEM-T Easy
vector (Promega). All libraries were transformed into ElectroMAX DH10B E. coli cells (Invitrogen) by electroporation.
Isolated plasmids were sequenced by the cycle sequencing
method using an ABI3700 96 capillary sequencer. A minimal contig set was assembled using the phrap assembler
and all contigs were manually curated.
Sequence analysis
ESTs and cDNAs from public databases were checked for
redundancy (within each organism specific data set) using
the GCG software or assembled into contigs using the
CAP-assembler of the Bioedit program. All non-redundant sequences from the different organisms were
checked for the presence of a poly(A)-tail. Initially,
sequences with at least 15 adenines in the 3'-end of the
insert were assumed to include poly(A)-tails and were
truncated to the base preceding the 5'-most adenine and
trimmed to the 200 nt upstream the CS using the Bioedit
editor. As we noticed that ESTs with fewer than 15 A at the
3'end contained a clear UGUAA about 20 nt upstream
from the putative poly(A) in some species, we lowered the
required number of As in the poly(A) tail to 5 to increase
the number of sequences in the data sets. 1-nucleotide
patterns were calculated for the 200 upstream from the CS
using the Bioedit program.

The frequencies of all possible penta- and hexanucleotide
patterns within the first 50 nt upstream from the CS were
determined using a small Python script. The script is available from the authors upon request. To test whether the
observed frequencies in penta- and hexanucleotide words
were significantly different from chance we used the logodds ratio (lnω) as described by Sokal and Rohlf [27].
Briefly, the expected oligonucleotide frequency Fe(b) of
oligonucleotide (b) was calculated using the collection of
all 200 nt upstream regions for each organism. The
expected oligonucleotide frequencies were then used to
calculate the number of expected occurrences in a given
organismal data set using the formula:
Oe(b) = Fe(b) × S × (L-w+1)
where
Oe(b) = number of expected occurrences of oligonucleotide (b) in the organismal data set
S = number of sequences
L = sequence length

According to Sokol and Rohlf, the log-odds ratios are
approximately normally distributed [27]. The standard
deviation of the log-odds ratio was calculated using equation 17.19 given in Sokal and Rohlf [27] and used to calculate the upper and lower limits of a 95% confidence
interval. If the lower limit is greater than zero the observed
differences are statistically significant.
The sequences (200 nt upstream of the CS, in fasta format) of the non-redundant Pyramimonas, Klebsormidium
and Coleochaete data sets are presented as data set S1 [see
Additional file 4]. The full sequences will be made available with the first general publication on the ESTs from
these organisms.
