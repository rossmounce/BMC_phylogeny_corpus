radiation of subterranean beetles

Abstract
Background: Cave organisms have been used as models for evolution and biogeography, as their reduced aboveground dispersal produces phylogenetic patterns of area distribution that largely match the geological history of
mountain ranges and cave habitats. Most current hypotheses assume that subterranean lineages arose recently
from surface dwelling, dispersive close relatives, but for terrestrial organisms there is scant phylogenetic evidence
to support this view. We study here with molecular methods the evolutionary history of a highly diverse
assemblage of subterranean beetles in the tribe Leptodirini (Coleoptera, Leiodidae, Cholevinae) in the mountain
systems of the Western Mediterranean.
Results: Ca. 3.5 KB of sequence information from five mitochondrial and two nuclear gene fragments was
obtained for 57 species of Leptodirini and eight outgroups. Phylogenetic analysis was robust to changes in
alignment and reconstruction method and revealed strongly supported clades, each of them restricted to a major
mountain system in the Iberian peninsula. A molecular clock calibration of the tree using the separation of the
Sardinian microplate (at 33 MY) established a rate of 2.0% divergence per MY for five mitochondrial genes (4% for
cox1 alone) and dated the nodes separating the main subterranean lineages before the Early Oligocene. The
colonisation of the Pyrenean chain, by a lineage not closely related to those found elsewhere in the Iberian
peninsula, began soon after the subterranean habitat became available in the Early Oligocene, and progressed
from the periphery to the centre.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that by the Early-Mid Oligocene the main lineages of Western Mediterranean
Leptodirini had developed all modifications to the subterranean life and were already present in the main
geographical areas in which they are found today. The origin of the currently recognised genera can be dated to
the Late Oligocene-Miocene, and their diversification can thus be traced to Miocene ancestors fully adapted to
subterranean life, with no evidence of extinct epigean, less modified lineages. The close correspondence of
organismal evolution and geological record confirms them as an important study system for historical
biogeography and molecular evolution.

Background
Isolated or extreme environments, such as islands or
high mountains, have been preferred systems for the
study of speciation and processes of adaptation [1,2].
One of these “natural laboratories” for evolution is the
deep subterranean environment, which combines
extreme but homogeneous and constant conditions with
a discontinuous distribution promoting isolation [3,4].
Despite the early recognition of the potential value of

the subterranean fauna in evolutionary biology (e.g. Darwin devotes three pages of the Origins to discuss the
effect of disuse and the convergence among cave species
in North America and Europe, [5] pp. 137-139), studies
of cave organisms have been hampered by their general
scarcity and the difficulty of accessing their habitat.
Most of the evolutionary studies on subterranean
fauna have focused on its origin and adaptations [4-6].
Cave or endogean species are characterised by a number
of shared characters, assumed to be either caused by
loss of function due to “lack of use” (apterism, depigmentation, reduction or complete loss or eyes [5,7]), or

adaptations to the harsh environmental conditions in
caves or deep soil, such as elongated body and appendages, cold adaptation, modified life cycles, modified fat
metabolism, or development of sensory organs [3,6,8]
(see [9-11] for specific examples of Pyrenean Leptodirini). Subterranean species are usually considered “super
specialists”, which cannot survive outside the narrow
range of highly stable conditions found in their habitats,
and have very limited potential to disperse [4]. As a
result, the geographical range of subterranean species is
usually very restricted, in many cases to a single cave or
a karstic system [8,12]. Species traditionally considered
to have wide distributions had often been shown to be
complexes composed of multiple cryptic lineages when
molecular methods were applied (e.g. [13,14]).
A widely accepted view on lineage evolution in cave
organisms is that subterranean species are evolutionary
dead-ends that do not disperse once fully adapted to the
environment of deep caves or soil. They are prone to
become extinct before being replaced by lineages newly
derived from epigean species that re-colonise the subterranean medium [4,15]. There are two general hypotheses regarding the origin of the subterranean fauna (see
[4,16,17] for reviews): the climatic relict and the habitat
shift hypotheses. Briefly, under the climatic relict
hypothesis [18] the subterranean medium acts as a
refuge for epigean fauna in times of unfavourable climatic conditions. The populations that are forced into a
subterranean habitat become isolated from their epigean
relatives and eventually develop the morphological and
physiological adaptations to this new environment. In
lineages with exclusively subterranean species the lack
of close epigean relatives is due to extinction of the latter, leaving the subterranean species as the only survivors that escaped extinction [18]. The adaptive shift
hypothesis [19,20] surmises that the colonisation of the
subterranean medium is driven by the opportunity to
exploit new resources. Epigean populations are not
forced below ground by changing conditions, and there
may be limited genetic flux between the two environments for some time. Both scenarios assume multiple
origins of the subterranean lineages from closely related
epigean relatives, with recurrent colonisation of the subterranean medium.
There is, however, little phylogenetic evidence to support these hypotheses, especially for the most diverse
lineages of exclusively subterranean species, such as
some groups of beetles. Among Coleoptera there are
multiple examples of phylogenetically independent cave
or endogean groups, in particular in the families Carabidae, Staphylinidae and Leiodidae [21,22]. Many of these
are either species poor subterranean lineages or a mix
of hypogean and epigean species, with different degrees
of morphological modifications and ecological

specialisation. Only a few groups appear to represent
extensive monophyletic radiations of exclusively subterranean species. Among them, the tribe Leptodirini in
the family Leiodidae [21] includes at present ca. 240
recognised genera and ca. 1,800 species [23], which are
almost exclusively subterranean. The highest diversity is
found in the Mediterranean basin, in particular in the
north and east of the Iberian peninsula, some Mediterranean islands (Corsica and Sardinia), the southern
Alps, Balkan peninsula, Romania and southern Russia,
the Caucasus, Middle East and Iran [23]. The few Leptodirini found east of Iran, and the only two Nearctic species (in the genus Platycholeus), are of uncertain
phylogenetic affinities ([24,25], see Discussion).
The monophyly of the western Palaearctic Leptodirini
is strongly supported by morphological characters
[24-26], but their internal phylogeny was only recently
addressed with numerical methods, and mostly with
morphological analysis of the internal structure of the
male genitalia, as other external morphological characters show extreme homoplasy [25] (see Fig. 1 for an
overview of the morphological diversity of the group).
The resolution and support attained with these character sets is, however, very limited, and was unable to provide a robust phylogenetic framework.
We provide here a comprehensive molecular data set
for the main lineages of Leptodirini present in the Western Mediterranean, including the Iberian peninsula
(plus adjacent mountain massifs in Southern France)
and Sardinia. The known fauna of this region includes
ca. 40 genera with some 230 mostly obligatory troglobiontic species, but also some endogean or muscicolous
species in the genera Bathysciola and Notidocharis [23]
(Additional file 1). We aim to establish a robust phylogeny to study the evolution of this extensive subterranean species radiation, and to provide a temporal
framework for the diversification of various lineages and
the colonisation of the geographical areas in which they
occur.

Methods
Taxon sampling

We follow the classification of Lawrence & Newton [27]
and Perreau [23] down to tribe level. All ingroup taxa in
the study are currently included in Leiodidae: Cholevinae: Leptodirini, although the formal classification of
Leptodirini is in need of a phylogenetic revision [25].
We use here “group of genera” (or “group” for simplicity) for lineages found to be monophyletic in our analyses, to avoid confusion with the traditionally defined
“series” which in the French school of mid-20th century
entomology did not necessarily imply monophyly in its
modern sense [28]. We sampled representatives of all
major lineages present in the Western Mediterranean

(31 out of the 42 genera occurring in the Iberian peninsula), plus the two endemic Sardinian genera using data
from [29] and two genera from the Carpathians as
examples of Eastern lineages, Drimeotus and Pholeuon
[23] (Additional file 1). No Leptodirini are known from
the Balearic islands. Sardinia has three additional species
currently included in Speonomus subgenus Batinoscelis
and four species of Bathysciola, and Corsica five species
of Parabathyscia, a genus of the Bathysciola series sensu
Perreau [23] with Alpine and Eastern European affinities. Most Western Mediterranean missing genera
could readily be associated to clades of the sampled taxa
according to the structure of the aedeagus, which we
show here to be a character with reliable phylogenetic
information (see [25,30] for a detailed taxonomic
discussion).
The final data matrix included 57 species of Leptodirini and 8 outgroups from different tribes of Cholevinae
(Anemadini, Ptomaphagini, Cholevini; Additional file 1)
and Agathidium as a member of the phylogenetically
separated subfamily Leiodinae [26,31].
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

The specimens used in the study were preserved in
absolute ethanol in the field. A full list of collectors and
localities is given in Additional file 1. Extractions of single specimens were non-destructive, using a standard
phenol-chloroform method or the DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Vouchers and DNA
samples are kept in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London (NHM) and Museo Nacional de
Ciencias Naturales, Madrid (MNCN) (Additional file 1).

We amplified fragments of seven genes, five mitochondrial and two nuclear: 3’ end of cytochrome c oxidase subunit (cox1); 5’ end of the large ribosomal unit
plus the Leucine transfer plus the 3’ end of NADH
dehydrogenase subunit 1 (rrnl+trnL+nad1); an internal
fragment of cytochrome b (cob); 5’ end of the small
ribosomal unit, 18S rRNA (SSU); and an internal fragment of the large ribosomal unit, 28S rRNA (LSU). Primers used are given in Table 1, and PCR protocols are
given in [32,33]. Sequences were assembled and edited
using Sequencher TM 4.1.4 (Gene Codes, Inc., Ann
Arbor, MI). New sequences have been deposited in
GenBank (NCBI) with Acc. Nos GU356744-GU356993
(Additional file 1). In two cases (Quaestus noltei (Coiffait) and Bathysciola ovata (Kiesenwetter)) the final
sequence was a composite of two different specimens of
the same species (Additional file 1).
No specimens from Sardinia were available for
sequencing, but sequences of the same fragment of the
cox1 gene used here (776 overlapping positions) could
be obtained for several Sardinian species from GenBank
[29]. We excluded sequences reported to be obtained
from dry material in [29], as they were placed in unlikely positions in the phylogeny or had large numbers of
autapomorphies,
Phylogenetic analyses

We used two different approaches for multiple progressive pair-wise alignment, either with secondary refinement using the MAFFT online v.6 and the Q-INS-i
algorithm [34] ("MF” in the following) or with modelling
the evolution of indels with PRANK [35] ("PR”).

Bayesian analyses were conducted on a combined data
matrix with MrBayes 3.1.2 [36], using six partitions corresponding to the six genes, but combining the short
trnL together with the rrnL gene. Evolutionary models
were estimated prior to the analysis with ModelTest 3.7
[37]. MrBayes ran for 5 × 10^6 generations using default
values, saving trees at each 500th generation. “Burn-in”
values were established after visual examination of a
plot of the standard deviation of the split frequencies
between two simultaneous runs.
We also conducted maximum likelihood searches in
Garli v.0.951 http://www.bio.utexas.edu/faculty/antisense/garli/Garli.html, which uses a stochastic genetic
algorithm-like approach to simultaneously find the
topology, branch lengths and substitution model parameters [38]. We used an estimated GTR+I+Γ model for
the combined sequence (as estimated with ModelTest),
and the default settings. Support was measured with
1,000 bootstrap replicates, reducing the number of generations without improving the topology necessary to
complete each replicate to 5,000.
Estimation of molecular rates and dates of diversification

For the age calibration of the phylogenetic tree we used
the point of separation between the Sardinian and the
continental lineages. The Sardinian clade most likely originated by allopatric separation when the Sardinian
microplates split from continental Europe through tectonic movements [29]. Recent tectonic reconstructions
[39,40] allow both a detailed geographical analysis of the
relative positions of the microplates to the continent
and fixing a minimum date for the origin of the Sardinian clade. The tectonic movements leading to the
separation of the Western Mediterranean microplates
started not before 33 MY ago, and by 25 MY ago the
separation from Iberia and the Gulf of Lyon was complete, although some connections with the Italian peninsula may have persisted [40]. However, given the limited
dispersal among subterranean populations the geological
uncertainty as to the existence of remnant land bridges
are likely to be unimportant for the dating of the
separation of Leptodirini. The use of a hard bound
minimum age calibration of 25 MY as the latest possible
population split would bias the estimations towards
younger ages [41], so we use the earlier date of 33 MY
as the most plausible time of separation between the
Sardinian clade and its sister, which may still be conservative (too recent) if the separation of the lineages predated the split of the microplates.
Because available sequences for the species of the Sardinian clade were limited to the cox1 marker (see above)
we conducted the Bayesian tree searches including or
excluding the sequences of the Sardinian species, to test
for the effect of missing data. The topologies of the

Page 5 of 14

resulting trees were identical (see Results). We therefore
used the topology obtained with the Bayesian analyses
for the whole dataset with the PR alignment (which was
fully compatible with that obtained with MF, but more
resolved; see below), to apply two methods to obtain an
ultrametric tree: Bayesian estimations, as implemented
in Beast 1.4.7 [42], and penalized likelihood [43], as
implemented in r8s 1.71 http://ginger.ucdavis.edu/r8s/.
We used the branch lengths corresponding to the single
cox1 sequence (pruning the species with missing cox1
from the tree), with a GTR+I+Γ model with parameters
estimated in PAUP [44].
For the Bayesian analyses in Beast, well supported
nodes in the analyses with the combined mitochondrial
and nuclear sequence were constrained to be monophyletic (see Results), and a GTR+I+Γ model was enforced
with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock and a
Yule diversification model [42]. All parameters were set
to default values, with the exception of the prior of the
age of the clade formed by the Sardinian species and
their sister, which was set to a normal distribution with
mean of 33 MY and a standard deviation of 2.0 MY
(corresponding to a 95% confidence interval of 28.8 and
36.3 MY) to allow for variance from stochastic sampling
error of nucleotide changes [41]. The results of two
independent runs were merged with Tracer v1.4 and
TreeAnnotator v1.4.7 [42].
In r8s we used the Truncated Newton algorithm and
performed a cross-validation procedure with smoothing
factors between 1 and 500 (after elimination of the outgroups) [43]. Once the optimal smoothing factor was
found, the program was run again using 33 MY as a
minimum constraint for the node including the Sardinian clade and its sister. A confidence interval of the
rates was estimated using the profiling option in r8s
with the topologies of the last 1,000 trees in one of the
MrBayes runs, with branch lengths for cox1 estimated in
PAUP as above. Note that because the branch lengths
are not those originally estimated in MrBayes for the
whole combined sequence, but those estimated in PAUP
for cox1 alone, the stochastic variation reflected in the
confidence interval is the result of the different topologies of the 1,000 trees used, plus the variation introduced subsequently by rate smoothing in r8s.
To test for possible artefacts due to the inclusion of
only the cox1 sequence, and to obtain a rate calibration
for other mitochondrial genes, we performed additional
analyses in Beast including all the mitochondrial
sequences but excluding the Sardinian species. The
node below that of the insertion of the Sardinian species
was constrained to have the age estimated with cox1
alone, with a normal distribution with standard deviation of 2.0 MY. Beast was run for 5 × 10^6 generations,
saving trees at every 500th generation.

Results
Phylogeny of Western Mediterranean Leptodirini

The protein-coding genes (cox1, cob, nad1) had no
indels, with the single exception of a three to four
nucleotide insertion beyond the end of the cox1 gene (in
the region of the trnL) in the Quaestus group of genera
and in Aranzadiella. Most of the length variation was
concentrated in the hypervariable regions of the LSU
fragment, while for the rrnL and SSU genes the length
variation between the two alignment methods used (MF
and PR) was relatively small (Table 2). For the LSU gene
the PR alignment was more than 1,000 positions longer
than the MF alignment, with a loss of 79 informative
characters (Table 2). Despite the large differences in the
length of the combined sequence between the two alignment methods (mostly due to LSU), the changes in the
topology or level of support of the resulting trees were
negligible (see below).
The optimal evolutionary model was GTR+I+Γ, both
for the combined data and the individual gene fragments. The two independent Bayesian runs reached
values of the standard deviation of the split frequencies
between them of ca. 0.005 for both the PR and MF
alignments. The estimated parameters for the two alignments were within the 95% confidence intervals of each
other, with the single exception of alpha (a) of the SSU
and LSU partitions, and the probability of invariant sites
(I) of the LSU partition (Additional file 2). The topologies of the trees obtained with Bayesian probabilities for
the two alignments and those obtained with ML in
Garli were either identical or compatible with each
other (i.e. consensus consistent with resolved nodes).
The differences in tree topology only affected the relationships of one of the outgroups (Speonemadus angusticollis Kraatz) and the internal phylogenetic
relationships of the Carpathian clade (Fig. 1, Additional
file 3). Nodal support was generally high, with most posterior probability values >0.95 and maximum likelihood
boostratp values >70% (Additional files 3, 4), with generally higher support values at some deeper nodes with

Bayesian methods (Additional file 3), as had been
observed in other studies [45].
The exclusion of the Sardinian species (due to missing
data, see Methods) in a Bayesian analysis using the MF
alignment produced a topology identical to that
obtained with all species (Additional file 4).
All species of Leptodirini formed a well supported
clade, to the exclusion of other tribes of Cholevinae
(Fig. 1). Within the Leptodirini, well supported major
lineages were composed of species restricted to particular biogeographical regions (Figs 1, 2). In most cases the
main lineages were fully allopatric, as separate clades
were confined to the Pyrenees (Speonomus group of
genera), the Cantabrian Mountains (Quaestus and Speonomidius groups), the central Mediterranean coast of
Iberia (Spelaeochlamys group), Sardinia (Ovobathysciola
group), and the Carpathians. In addition, two species of
Bathysciola, B. zariquieyi Bolívar distributed throughout
the coastal mountain systems in Catalonia [46] and B.
ovata, with a wide distribution in Pyrenees and SE
France, constitute phylogenetically isolated lineages
separated from other members of the genus (Figs 1, 2).
The monophyletic Pyrenean lineage, corresponding to
the Speonomus series of Fresneda et al. [25], was sister
to the genera from the Carpathians (Fig. 1), and was
split in two main lineages defined by nodes 2 and 5 in
Fig. 1. The former includes genera from the lower western areas (node 3, Basque Country and Navarra) plus
some endogean and muscicolous Bathysciola with a
wider distribution towards the east. The clade defined
by node 5 includes genera from the eastern lowland
areas (node 4, Parvospeonomus and Pseudospeonomus)
plus a large clade of genera from the central Pyrenees
(node 7). The latter clade was also geographically structured, with genera roughly distributed west (node 6) and
east (node 8) of the river Gállego in the central Pyrenees
(Figs 1, 2). The genus Troglocharinus (included in node
8) has a disjunct distribution, with some species distributed in the southern coastal ranges of Catalonia (Fig.
2b; [30]), although the monophyly of the genus could
not be tested as the southern species were missing from
our study.
The remaining Leptodirini consisted of several highly
supported clades with very well defined distributions:
(1) the Quaestus group in the Cantabrian mountains;
(2) the Spelaeochlamys group in the Mediterranean
coast of Spain; (3) the Ovobathysciola group in Sardinia;
(4) the divergent species Bathysciola zariquieyi from the
Catalonian mountains; (5) the Speonomidius group of
Cantabria; and (6) Bathysciola ovata from the Pyrenees
(Figs 1, 2a). The relationships among these lineages
were in general poorly resolved, although the sister relationship between the Quaestus and Spelaeochlamys
groups, and of Bathysciola zariquieyi and the Sardinian

clade, were well supported in some Bayesian analyses
(Additional file 3).
Temporal diversification of the Western Mediterranean
Leptodirini

The split between the Sardinian clade and its mainland
sister Bathysciola zariquieyi was used for estimating the
evolutionary rate of cox1, using a calibration point of 33
MY ago as the time of vicariant separation of both
lineages (Fig. 1). When using Beast, the rate estimate
was 0.020 +/- 0.005 substitutions per site per MY, i.e.
an overall pair-wise divergence of 4.0% per MY (Table

3, Additional file 5). The node that grouped B. zariquieyi plus the Sardinian clade with their sisters was
estimated to date back to ca. 38 +/- 7 MY ago. This
constraint was subsequently used for the estimation of
the evolutionary rate for the combined mitochondrial
genes (excluding the species of the Sardinian clade for
which these data were missing). The rate of the five
combined mitochondrial markers (cox1, rrnL, trnL, nad1
and cob, comprising 2,293 bp in the MF alignment;
Table 2) was 0.010 +/- 0.002, equivalent to an overall
pair wise divergence of 2.0% per MY (Table 3). The estimation of node ages using the combined mitochondrial

markers was very similar to that obtained using cox1
only, and fully within the 95% confidence interval of
each other (Table 3, Fig. 3, Additional files 3, 6).
For comparison we estimated the age of the nodes with
the Penalized Likelihood (PL) method in r8s [43], using
cox1 only and a calibration date of 33 MY for the Sardinian-continental split. Estimated node ages throughout
were very similar to those obtained with Bayesian methods, and well within their 95% confidence interval, with
the sole exception of the node defining the sister relationship between Antrocharis and Gesciella (older with the PL
estimation; Table 3 and Additional file 6). However, the
estimated overall rate was 0.0115 +/- 0.0005 (2.3% per
MY, Table 3), i.e. lower than the estimate obtained with
Beast for the cox1 gene, suggesting substantial differences
in the branch length estimates from both methods.

The main lineages of Western Mediterranean Leptodirini were estimated to have diversified between ca. 4533 MY, during the Mid to Late Eocene (Fig. 3). The
relative age of the nodes suggests that by the time the
Sardinian lineage formed (presumably by Late Eocene Early Oligocene) all other main lineages were already
present and distributed over their present geographical
areas. All lineages with a well defined geographical distribution were estimated to have originated by the Late
Oligocene (Figs 2, 3). The age of diversification within
the genera for which more than one species was
sequenced ranged from ca. 20 to 5 MY (mostly Miocene), disregarding some cases where the currently
recognised genera were found to be paraphyletic (Euryspeonomus, Quaestus) or polyphyletic (Speonomus, Bathysciola) (Fig. 1).

Discussion
The most prominent feature of the phylogeny of the
Western Mediterranean Leptodirini is the strong geographical division among the main lineages. Support for
these geographically restricted clades is generally very
strong and stable to changes in alignment or reconstruction methods, while the relationships among them is
less well supported. All well supported deep clades were
restricted to a single mountain massif, and each of these

is occupied by a single clade with the sole exceptions of
the Cantabrian mountains, with two separate lineages
(the Quaestus and Speonomidius groups of genera) and
some species of Bathysciola in the Pyrenees. In both
cases one of these sympatric lineages is composed of
cave species only (Quaestus and Speonomus groups)
while the other is muscicolous or endogean (Speonomidius and Bathysciola for the Cantabrian mountains and
the Pyrenees respectively) (see Additional file 1 for the

Ribera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/29

habitat of the studied species). It would be interesting to
compare the rates of diversification of the different
lineages in the same geographical area, and the occurrence of species in sympatry to test for the possible
effect of competitive exclusion within each habitat type.
Phylogeny of Western Mediterranean Leptodirini

Our results basically agree with the traditional taxonomic division of Leptodirini in “infraflagellates” [25]
and “supraflagellates” [8,28], based on the complex
structure that is characteristic of the aedeagus in the
former (the “Y piece” [25]). In our study the infraflagellates correspond to the Pyrenean and the Carpathian
species, albeit supported only in the Bayesian inference
and with the exclusion of some species of Bathysciola.
The polyphyly of the genus Bathysciola has already been
established (see [25]), but the inclusion of some species
among the “supraflagellates” implies multiple independent origins of a complex aedeagus. Alternatively, the
presence of the “Y piece” could be the ancestral condition of Leptodirini, which underwent repeated simplifications in at least the Cantabrian and Sardinian species
of the Ovobathysciola group (Fig. 1), contrary to expectations (e.g. [8,26,28]).
Our results also support most of the traditional “phyletic series” of Jeannel [8,28], while in Fresneda et al.’s
[25] study using characters of the external morphology
and the internal genitalia, support was found only for
the monophyly of the Speonomus (including Bathysciola)
and Spelaeochlamys plus Ovobathysciola series. The
molecular analyses also supported the traditionally
defined Speonomidius, Quaestus and Spelaeochlamys
series [30,47-49]. The Speonomidius series includes the
genus Notidocharis [47], with seven muscicolous rather
than subterranean species, all with reduced eyes (Additional file 1). Other muscicolous oculated Leptodirini
include some Bathysciola-like taxa in Anatolia, the Caucasus and north Iran, plus Adelopsella bosnica (Reitter)
from the Balkans and two Nearctic species in the genus
Platycholeus [50]. The genera Adelopsella, Platycholeus
and Sciaphyes (tribe Sciaphyini from east Siberia [23])
share some unique characters not present in the remaining Leptodirini [8], which suggests they may not be closely related. According to Fresneda et al. [25] the
presence of eyes placed Notidocharis as sister to the rest
of studied Leptodirini. In the current analysis this position is not strongly contradicted, as the support of the
basal nodes of Leptodirini in the trees obtained with
ML was very weak (Fig. 1, Additional file 3).
The Pyrenean clade corresponds to the Speonomus
series as defined by Fresneda et al. [25] with the exclusion of some species of Bathysciola, but confirming the
inclusion of the genus Pseudospeonomus (= Pseudochlamys Comas), distributed in the extreme east of the

Page 10 of 14

Pyrenees and previously grouped with species in the
mountains of the Mediterranean coast of Spain [25].
The Sardinian species of the Ovobathysciola group,
although grouped with the Mediterranean species (Spelaeochlamys group) in studies of morphology [25,29],
seem more closely related to Bathysciola zariquieyi
according to the DNA data. The support for this relationship was low under ML, possibly due to missing
data (only the cox1 sequence was available for the Sardinian clade [29]), but reasonably high with Bayesian
methods (pp > 0.9 for both the MF and PR alignments).
Bathysciola zariquieyi has a relatively wide distribution
in the Catalonian coast, from south of Barcelona to the
province of Girona [46]. The Catalonia-Sardinia link is
more in agreement with geological reconstructions [40],
according to which the Sardinian microplates were last
connected to the mainland in the north (French coast),
rather than the south Iberian Mediterranean coast, as
previously assumed [29].
According to our results the Leptodirini fauna of the
Iberian peninsula is most likely not monophyletic. The
Pyrenean clade seems most closely related to some Eastern European lineages, and the lineage of the Mediterranean coast (Spelaeochlamys group of genera) is related
to the Sardinian Ovobathysciola group and to some species north of the Ebro basin and in southern France.
Calibration

The use of molecular data to estimate the ages of extant
taxa has revolutionised many aspects of evolutionary
biology [51,52], despite their known limitations and
shortcomings [51,53]. There is, however, a great scarcity
of good reference calibrations for many groups, and the
“standard” arthropod mitochondrial rate of 2.3% per MY
[54] is often used uncritically for a variety of genes, ages
and organisms. Subterranean species have been used to
calibrate molecular phylogenies, as their distributions
presumably are more likely to reflect ancient vicariant
events due to their low dispersal (e.g. [29]). However,
these ancient vicariant scenarios could be confounded
by occasional dispersal of minute endogean species, or
in lineages where above-ground dispersal of epigean
forms preceded the shift to the subterranean environment. Our calibrations depend on the vicariance
between the Sardinian and the European plates, i.e. the
presence of a common ancestor in this region prior to
the split of these landmasses. Strictly, we cannot exclude
an independent origin of subterranean habits in the Sardinian Ovobathysciola group, or drifting of a Bathysciola-like endogean ancestor to the island subsequent to
its separation from the continent, but these seem to be
unlikely scenarios. Using this calibration point, the average rate for the sequenced mitochondrial genes (cox1,
cyb, rrnL and nad1) was 2% per MY, surprisingly close

Ribera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/29

to the standard 2.3% [54], and in agreement with results
from other calibrations for beetles [12,55-57]. The cox1
gene alone produces a twofold faster rate (4%) compared to the averaged mitochondrial rate including the
slower rrnL and trnL genes, also in agreement with previous results (e.g. [58,59]). The age estimations using
Beast and r8s, whether using cox1 or the combination of
several protein coding and ribosomal mitochondrial
genes, were remarkably similar (Table 3, Additional file
6), despite differences in the estimation of the rate for
the cox1 gene between r8s and Beast. As noted above,
this may be related to the differences in the method
used for the computation of the branch lengths (Bayesian methods in Beast, penalized likelihood in r8s
[42,43]).
Evolution of the Western Mediterranean Leptodirini

The estimations of node ages date the origin of the main
lineages of Leptodirini to the Early Eocene, with the
initial diversification taking place during the Oligocene
(ca. 35-20 MY, Fig. 3). Our sampling does not include
some lineages of Leptodirini including genera from the
Alps, Balkans or mainland Italy, but these are mostly
“infraflagellates”, [26,28], i.e. likely to be embedded in the
existing clades. Due to the finding of the Carpathian as
sister to the Pyrenean lineage, and the inclusion in our
dataset of the oculated, muscicolous Notidocharis, it is
unlikely that these missing lineages could move the origin of the lineages further back in time.
The diversification of the main lineages during the
Paleogene coincides with the closure of the Tethys Sea
and the collision of the Iberian and Eurasian plates [39].
Under this scenario, the origin of the Pyrenean lineage
of Leptodirini at 34 +/- 6 MY ago followed shortly upon
the formation of the Pyrenees during the Alpine orogeny which was largely completed by the Early Oligocene [60,61]. The colonisation of the Pyrenean
subterranean medium therefore took place without
delay after suitable habitat was available, i.e. after the
karstification by water erosion of the recently raised calcareous massifs. This view is strengthened by the fact
that the basal cladogenetic splits involve the species at
both edges of the chain (nodes 2 and 4 in Fig. 3, see
Fig. 2b), with subsequent splits including species more
centrally distributed (node 6, plus Ceretophyes and Perriniella), and the species in the central part, with the
highest elevations, among the most recently derived
lineages (node 8). This centripetal early colonisation,
completed ca. 10 +/- 3 MY ago (Fig. 3), was followed in
some cases by an intra-genus diversification in each of
the valleys or mountain massifs to which these groups
are currently confined. The origin of the main lineages
of Leptodirini in the Cantabrian mountains and the
Mediterranean coast appears slightly older than in the

Page 11 of 14

Pyrenees. This is in agreement with a likely older age of
the available habitat, as these mountain areas were present in the Iberian plate before the formation of the Pyrenees [39]. The Oligocene to mid Miocene origin of the
main lineages (above what is currently recognized at the
level of genus) is older than for other lineages of subterranean European fauna whose origin was placed in the
Late Miocene to Pleistocene ([62,63] and references
therein), including the Pyrenean radiation of subterranean Trechini groundbeetles [22].
The strong geographical structure of subterranean
taxa at multiple hierarchical levels is a common pattern
also evident in other recent studies (see e.g. [64,65] for
Crustacea; or [12,22] for Coleoptera). Each well defined
biogeographical unit is occupied by a single monophyletic lineage, while any phylogenetic substructure within
such groups frequently reflects the geographical subdivision of these wider areas, in many cases contrary to
expectations from morphological similarities. In some
cases these geographically confined lineages include
both subterranean and epigean species, e.g. stygobiontic
Crustacea [66,67], spiders and beetles in the tribe Trechini in the Canary Islands [56,68], or stygobiontic diving beetles in Australia [12]. These examples provide
strong evidence for multiple colonisation of the subterranean medium, as they include lineages that exhibit different degrees of morphological modifications. Their
adaptations to the subterranean environment is in
accordance with the adaptive shift hypothesis [19], that
invokes multiple independent colonisations of the subterranean medium and continued survival of the epigean
ancestors (see Introduction). In the Western Mediterranean Leptodirini, the only lineage with non-subterranean, oculated muscicolous species (Notidocharis) is
placed in an ambiguous position close to the origin of
the western Mediterranean lineages, i.e. has been separated from the troglobitic lineages for more than 40 MY
ago. All other major lineages, with Oligocene or Early
Miocene origin, include only anophthalmous, endogean,
interstitial or cave species (Additional file 1). This pattern strongly suggests that each of the geographical
lineages diversified after the colonization of the subterranean medium took place, as suggested for other terrestrial [15,22,69,70] and stygobiontic [71] groups. This
is in disagreement with both the climatic relict and the
adaptive shift hypotheses, which assume multiple colonisations of the subterranean medium by closely related
epigean ancestors and perceive the troglobitic taxa as
evolutionary dead ends [18,20].

Conclusions
We have shown here that the main lineages of Western
Mediterranean Leptodirini have an origin in the EarlyMid Oligocene, and most likely developed all

Ribera et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:29
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/29

modifications to the subterranean life in the main geographical areas in which they are found today prior to
the Late Oligocene-Miocene. The diversification within
each of these main geographical areas seems thus to
have taken place since early Miocene from ancestors
fully adapted to the subterranean medium, contrary to
most current assumptions about the evolution of the
subterranean fauna.
