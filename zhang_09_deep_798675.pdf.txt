Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs having large-scale regulatory
effects on plant development and stress responses. Extensive studies of miRNAs have only been
performed in a few model plants. Although miRNAs are proved to be involved in plant cold stress
responses, little is known for winter-habit monocots. Brachypodium distachyon, with close
evolutionary relationship to cool-season cereals, has recently emerged as a novel model plant.
There are few reports of Brachypodium miRNAs.
Results: High-throughput sequencing and whole-genome-wide data mining led to the identification
of 27 conserved miRNAs, as well as 129 predicted miRNAs in Brachypodium. For multiple-member
conserved miRNA families, their sizes in Brachypodium were much smaller than those in rice and
Populus. The genome organization of miR395 family in Brachypodium was quite different from that
in rice. The expression of 3 conserved miRNAs and 25 predicted miRNAs showed significant
changes in response to cold stress. Among these miRNAs, some were cold-induced and some were
cold-suppressed, but all the conserved miRNAs were up-regulated under cold stress condition.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that Brachypodium miRNAs are composed of a set of conserved
miRNAs and a large proportion of non-conserved miRNAs with low expression levels. Both kinds
of miRNAs were involved in cold stress response, but all the conserved miRNAs were upregulated, implying an important role for cold-induced miRNAs. The different size and genome
organization of miRNA families in Brachypodium and rice suggest that the frequency of duplication
events or the selection pressure on duplicated miRNAs are different between these two closely
related plant species.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-proteincoding RNAs generated from single-stranded precursors
with unique hairpin structures. They regulate the expression of mRNAs by targeting transcripts for cleavage or
translational repression [1]. The miRNAs were initially

isolated in Caenorhabditis elegans as developmental timing
regulators [2]. Since then, they have been found in a
broad range of plants, as well as viruses and mammals.
Plants miRNAs were first identified in Arabidopsis by different research groups [3-5]. The biogenesis of plant miRNAs is a complex multi-step enzymatic process [6-8]. The

miRNAs are initially transcribed by RNA polymerase II in
the cell nucleus as long primary miRNAs that are cleaved
into the miRNA:miRNA* duplexes by Dicer-like 1
(DCL1). Export of the duplexes into the cell cytoplasm is
mediated by HASTY. After methyl groups are added to the
3' ends of the duplexes catalyzed by HEN1, one strand of
the duplexes is selectively incorporated into the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) to form the mature
miRNAs, whereas the other strand, designated the
miRNA*, is typically degraded. DCL4 has also been
shown to play a role in the biogenesis of a few miRNAs
with long hairpin precursors [9]. Plant miRNAs exhibit
high complementarity to their targets and can direct RISCmediated cleavage of target mRNAs. Thus, it is widely
accepted that plant miRNAs induce post-transcriptional
gene silencing predominantly through guiding mRNA
cleavage. Recent studies, however, have showed that translational inhibition is another kind of action mechanism
for miRNAs in plants [10-13].
Although initial studies have largely demonstrated the
role of plant miRNAs in development and morphogenesis
processes, there are increasing number of reports indicating that plant miRNAs also target genes involved in biotic
as well as abiotic stress responses [1,14,15]. Low temperature is one of the most important environmental stimuli
that affect plant growth and development. Recently, more
and more reports demonstrate the role of plant miRNAs
in cold stress response. The first study in this area, performed by Sunkar and Zhu, revealed the induced expression of miR393, miR397b and miR402 in response to
cold stress as well as other kinds of stress treatment. In this
study, miR319c appeared to be up-regulated by cold but
not by dehydration, NaCl, or ABA treatment [16]. Zhou et
al. (2008) identified cold up-regulated miRNAs using a
computational, transcriptome-based approach [17]. Liu et
al. (2008) and Lu et al. (2008) used microarray analysis to
identify cold-responsive miRNAs in Arabidopsis and Populus, respectively [18,19]. These studies indicate that the
expression of several miRNAs is affected by the cold treatment. Despite these efforts, our knowledge of the role
played by miRNAs in plant cold stress response is still limited at the whole-genome level.
The most challenging problem in understanding plant
miRNAs is to identify more novel miRNAs. Three major
approaches have been used for miRNA discovery in
plants: forward genetics, bioinformatic prediction as well
as direct cloning and sequencing. Only a few miRNAs
were identified by forward genetic studies [10,20-22] and
predicting species-specific miRNAs using bioinformatics
method is difficult. Thus, direct cloning and sequencing is
the most effective method for plant miRNA discovery.
Only a few hundred miRNAs have been identified with
this approach, which leads to a premature conclusion that

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/449

the types of miRNAs in plants are limited. Recently, the
deep sequencing approach appeared and allowed the
identification of numerous small RNAs [9,23-27]. It not
only revealed a lot more species-specific miRNAs, but also
provided a picture of the genomic landscape of small
RNAs.
Although significant progress has been made in identifying plant miRNAs and understanding their action mechanism, the discovery of novel miRNAs in plants on a
genome-wide scale is still at the preliminary stage. One
limiting factor in miRNA discovery is the availability of
the whole genome sequence, only with which a comprehensive analysis of the potential hairpin precursor structures of cloned small RNAs can be performed to
distinguish miRNAs from other kinds of small RNAs.
Thus, most of the studies have been done in Arabidopsis,
rice and Populus, whose whole genome sequences are
known. Many evolutionarily or economically important
species have not been examined yet. To further understand the function of plant miRNAs, more effort should
be directed toward plant species with specific developmental features, which may contain miRNAs that are specific for these features [27]. Several economically
important winter-habit monocots, such as winter wheat,
barley, oat, rye, as well as cool-season biofuel and forage
grasses, can cold-acclimate and acquire high tolerance to
low temperature. Although it has been shown that miRNAs are involved in plant cold stress response, little work
has been done for monocotyledonous plant, especially for
these winter-habit monocots, probably because rice, the
model plant for monocots, is a tropical plant and incapable of cold acclimation.
Brachypodium distachyon has emerged as a new monocot
model plant, especially for temperate cereals and related
grasses [28,29]. Brachypodium not only has a closer evolutionary relationship with cool-season temperate cereals
and grasses than rice, but also possesses growth and developmental features that are common to these plants. As a
widely distributed winter-habit temperate plant, it has
vernalization requirement and is capable of cold acclimation [30,31]. Recently, the draft genome sequence of
Brachypodium has been released http://www.brachypo
dium.org/, which makes this plant a good model for performing whole-genome-wide study of miRNAs involved
in cold response of winter-habit temperate cereals and
grasses. Here we sequenced small RNA populations in
Brachypodium with and without cold stress treatment
using Solexa, the high-throughput sequencing technology. Our studies not only identified species-specific miRNAs for the novel monocotyledonous model plant, but
also provided useful information for cold-responsive
miRNAs in temperate cereals and grasses.

Results
Deep sequencing of Brachypodium small RNAs
Two small RNA libraries, with (WC) and without (NC)
cold-treatment, were generated using pooled RNA isolated from the aerial parts of Brachypodium seedlings.
Sequencing of the Brachypodium small RNA libraries was
performed with Solexa, a high throughput sequencing
technology producing highly accurate, reproducible and
quantitative readouts of small RNAs [32,33]. It can be
used as a tool for miRNA expression profiling [24,26,34].
For direct comparison, Brachypodium seedlings used for
NC and WC library construction were grown under similar conditions except for the cold treatment. The same
amount of RNA was used to construct these two libraries
and the samples were prepared in a similar manner.
Sequencing of these two libraries was performed on the
Illumina's Solexa Sequencer and the samples were run
side by side.

Solexa sequencing of NC and WC libraries generated a
total of 5,339,385 and 5,452,742 raw reads, respectively.
Analysis of these reads resulted in identification of
3,741,194 and 3,585,498 sequences ranging from 18 to
30 nucleotides (nt), respectively (Table 1). The remaining
sequences were either of low quality (readings without
reliable 3' adaptor sequence) or smaller than 18 nt, and
were excluded from further analysis. The majority of the
obtained small RNA sequences from the NC library were
20-24 nt in size, which is the typical size range for Dicerderived products (Figure 1a). These small RNAs were used
for further analysis.
The 20-24 nt sequences from the NC and WC libraries
were aligned to the draft Brachypodium genome using
SOAP [35], and a total of 2,603,872 (NC) and 2,958,093
(WC) sequences were found to match the genome perfectly. After removing the sequences corresponding to
known rRNAs, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs and small
nucleolar RNAs, a total of 2,248,474 (NC) and 1,264,919
(WC) sequences were obtained (Table 1). The WC library
contained more non-coding RNAs than the NC library,
which reduced the population size of non-coding-RNAremoved genome-matched sequences in the WC library to
half of that in the NC library. For direct comparison, the
NC library was normalized to the WC library according to
the population size mentioned above. In both NC and
WC libraries, most of the known miRNAs and predicted
miRNAs were detected at least 3 times, enabling the comparison of miRNA expression levels between these two
libraries.
Identification of novel monocot-specific and
Brachypodium-specific miRNAs
One important feature that distinguishes miRNAs from
other endogenous small RNAs is that their surrounding

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/449

sequences can adopt a hairpin structure [36,37]. The raw
whole genome sequence data of Brachypodium distachyon
has been released by the US Department of Energy Joint
Genome Institute http://www.brachypodium.org/; http://
www.jgi.doe.gov/ and gene annotation was accomplished
with FGENESH. In this study, the annotated Brachypodium
genome sequences were used to predict hairpin structures
based on miRNA surrounding sequences. To identify miRNAs in Brachypodium, the following strategy was adopted.
First, the cloned sequences were aligned with the Brachypodium genome sequence using SOAP [35] to search for
perfectly matched sequences. In the second step,
sequences corresponding to known non-coding RNAs
(rRNAs, tRNAs, small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs)
were discarded by performing the BLASTn search [38]
against the GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/
Blast.cgi and Rfam databases http://www.sanger.ac.uk/
Software/Rfam/[39]. The remaining sequences were used
for the fold-back structure prediction and classified as
either miRNA candidates or other kinds of endogenous
small RNAs.
Our analysis revealed that in the NC library 2,248,474
sequences can be used for fold-back structure prediction
and those that fulfilled the hairpin structure criteria
described by Jones-Rhoades et al. [1] were selected as candidate miRNAs (Table 1). Among these candidates, some
also matched the plastid or mitochondrial genomes.
These sequences were not considered as miRNAs in this
study. After these analyses, 235 unique sequences were
obtained as miRNA candidates (Table 1). According to the
currently available gene annotation of the Brachypodium
genome
http://www.brachybase.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/
brachy_core/, 43 of these miRNA candidates were located
in the exons of potentially protein-coding genes, which
were not further analyzed. Among the remaining 192
Brachypodium miRNA candidates, 63 of them have really
low sequencing reads and were not detected in the WC
library. Those candidates were excluded from further
research according to the updated plant miRNA annotation criteria [40]. The remaining 129 putative Brachypodium miRNAs were carefully examined to be sure that they
are qualified for the updated plant miRNA annotation criteria [40].
The lengths of the 129 predicted Brachypodium miRNAs
vary from 20 to 22 nt, and more than half of them begin
with 5' uridine (Additional file 1, Additional file 2), which
is a characteristic feature of miRNAs [4,41,42]. The minimum free energies of these miRNA precursors range from
-37.50 to -158.20 kcal mol-1, and the average value is
about -73.73 kcal mol-1 (Additional file 1), which is similar to the free energy values of miRNA precursors in rice
and Arabidopsis [43]. These values are much lower than the
folding free energies of tRNAs (-27.5 kcal mol-1) or rRNAs

the miRNA precursors are in the range of 71-265 nt (Additional file 1), which is similar to what was observed in rice
[25]. None of these putative miRNAs has been found in
Arabidopsis or rice before.
Identification of conserved miRNAs in Brachypodium
To identify the conserved miRNA homologs in Brachypodium, small RNA libraries were analyzed for the presence
of known miRNAs. BLASTn search [38] with an E-value
cutoff of 10 was employed to search for small RNAs with
predicted hairpin structures against the central miRNA
Registry
Database
(miRBase,
http://micro
rna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/). With this similarity search,
27 unique sequences were identified as known miRNAs.
They showed higher sequence similarity to their
homologs in rice than in Arabidopsis and Populus (Table 2).
All of these conserved miRNA precursors were identified
in the draft Brachypodium genome and they can adopt
hairpin structures (Additional file 3). Based on sequence
similarity, these known miRNAs could be grouped into 21
families (Table 2). Four conserved miRNA families were
represented by more than one sequence variant in the
small RNA libraries. MiR164, miR166 and miR172 were
represented by two variants and miR169 was represented
by four variants in the library (Table 2). Some of these
miRNAs including miR156, miR160, miR166 and mi171
are deeply conserved, even in lower plants such as Physcomitrella patens [45]. MiR528 and miR529, which are species-specific miRNAs, were also found in the NC library.
According to miRBase http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/ and
published papers, miR528 only appears in Oryza sativa
and miR529 has been identified in Eschscholzia californica

[46], Oryza sativa, Physcomitrella patens as well as some
Pinus species [46]. The miRNA* sequences were detected
for some bdi-miRNAs (Table 2, Additional file 3). The isolation frequencies for most of these miRNA* sequences
were about one-tenth of those for mature miRNAs, consistent with the conclusion of Rajagopalan et al. [9]. For
miR529, there were 631 reads of the miRNA and 17 reads
of the miRNA* in the NC library. Similarly, in the WC
library miR529 had 268 reads of the miRNA and 11 reads
of the miRNA*. The miR529* was reported to be
sequenced more often than the miR529 in rice and the
annotated miR529*, therefore, is suspected to be the true
miRNA [26]. Our data indicate that miR529 is the true
miRNA and the existing annotation should not be
changed. It is also interesting to note that the miR169f was
sequenced 140 times in the NC library and its potential
miRNA* was sequenced 103 times, which is almost equal
to the mature miRNA sequencing frequency.
The sequencing frequencies for miRNAs in the library
could be used as an index for estimating the relative abundance of miRNAs. Solexa sequencing produced a large
number of miRNA sequences, allowing us to determine
the relative abundance of miRNAs in Brachypodium. The
frequencies of the miRNAs varied from 4 (miR398) to
525,374 (miR168), indicating that the expression of miRNAs varied greatly in Brachypodium (Figure 2). The
miR168 was the most abundant miRNA in our two
sequencing datasets, accounting for about 20% of all
sequence reads matching with the Brachypodium genome
and about 60% of the sequence reads of the conserved
miRNAs (Table 1, Figure 2). MiR168 has also been the
most abundant miRNA in previous high-throughput

sequencing studies in rice [47,48], but not in Arabidopsis
http://asrp.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/db/micro
RNA.html?fid=11/.
According to the sequencing frequencies, some miRNAs
(miR156a, miR164a, miR166a, miR166g, miR167a,
miR168, miR171a, miR396a, miR528) were highly
expressed in Brachypodium, and were sequenced more
than 1000 times each. The miR160a, miR164d, miR169f,
miR172a, miR172b, miR319, miR390, miR393, miR394,
miR395a, miR397a, miR529 and miR827 were moderately expressed, and were represented by the number of

sequences varying between 10 and 100. The third category, whose expression level was low (< 10 sequences),
was represented by miR162, miR169a, miR169c,
miR169e and miR398 (Figure 2). Sequence analysis indicated that the relative abundance of certain members
within a miRNA family varied greatly in Brachypodium. For
instance, the sequencing frequency for miR166a was
29,730, whereas miR166g's sequencing frequency was
only 1,145 (Figure 2). These results indicate that in one
miRNA family different members show clearly different
expression levels, probably because their expression is tissue- or developmental-specific.

Genomic organization of the miRNAs
Among the 27 conserved Bachypodium miRNAs, 16 were
encoded by a single copy in the Brachypodium genome,
whereas the other 11 miRNAs had multiple loci (Table 2),
which probably resulted from duplication events that
were still active in the Brachypodium genome. For these 11
miRNAs, most of them only had 2-4 loci in the genome,
only a few had more than 6 loci. For the predicted Brachypodium miRNAs, most of them had one single locus in
the genome and only a few were represented by more than
2 loci (Table 3) (Additional file 1). According to the currently available gene annotation for the Brachypodium
genome, most of these predicted miRNAs were mapped to
the intergenic regions. Interestingly, for almost all the
conserved miRNA families (except miR395) with multiple
members, their family sizes in Brachypodium are much
smaller than those in rice and Populus, and most of them
have sizes similar to those in Arabidopsis (Table 4). For
example, the number of family members for miR156,
miR160, miR164, miR166, miR167, miR171 and miR396
in Brachypodium was similar to that in Arabidopsis, but

much higher in rice and Populus (Table 4). For miR395, its
size in Brachypodium was approximately half of that in rice
(Figure 3, Table 4).
MiR395 belongs to conserved miRNAs that have been
found across different plant species. Both miR395 and
miR395* could be detected in the NC library, although
their reads were not high. According to the detected
miRNA and miRNA* sequences as well as results of
BLASTn search based on sequences similarity, 14 precursors with reasonable minimum free energy value were
identified for miR395 in the draft Brachypodium genome
(Figure 3). They were named miR395a~miR395n according to the order of their genomic location. Additionally,
two other sequences in the surrounding region showed
high similarity to miR395 precursors, but they contained
no mature miR395 sequence and were therefore not considered for further analysis in this study (Figure 3).
For all the miR395 precursors, the mature miRNAs are all
located on the 3' arms. The precursors of miR395a~c are

The number of miRNA family members in rice, Arabidopsis and Populus
was obtained from the miRBase http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/.

Genomic organization of the miR395 family in Brachypodium
Genomic organization of the miR395 family in Brachypodium. Thin black lines represent genomic DNA fragments. Small and big solid vertical bars represent type A and
type B miR395 genes, respectively. Open vertical bars represent sequences showing similarity to miR395 genes, but containing no mature miR395 sequence. The location of miR395

genes. Asterisks denote miR395 genes whose miRNA* have

clustered together and so were the precursors of
miR395e~m. (Table 2, Figure 3). It is interesting to note
that miR395d in Brachypodium is not clustered with other
family members (Figure 3) although the members of this
family always form clusters in other plant species [49]. No
miR395- precursor-like sequence was detected in its surrounding region. On the basis of size and sequence similarity, two types of miR395 precursors exist in
Brachypodium. Type A includes miR395a~c and
miR395f~n, and type B includes miR395d and miR395e.
Both kinds of precursors show high sequence similarity to
their homologs in rice (Additional file 4). The precursors
of miR395a~c and miR395f~n show high sequence similarity, suggesting that they are derived from a series of
gene duplication events. These precursors exhibit different
levels of sequence similarity to one another, implying that
the duplication events happened at different time points
during the evolution history of the miR395 family. The
precursors of miR395i and miR395k are nearly identical,
implying a recent origin (Additional file 4).
The impact of cold stress on conserved and species-specific
miRNAs in Brachypodium
To detect the effect of cold stress on Brachypodium miRNAs, the expression of miRNAs in Brachypodium seedlings
with (WC library) and without cold-treatment (NC
library) were examined with Solexa technology. These two
libraries were compared for their size distribution of small
RNAs. In the NC library, the 21-24 nt RNAs represented
the predominant species (about 80%), with 21-nt and 24nt RNAs being the two most abundant classes (Figure 1a),
consistent with the distribution patterns of small RNAs
from other plant species [23,26,50]. However, in the WC
library, about 25% of the total small RNAs were 19 nt in
size, which was the most abundant class (Figure 1b). The
high percentage of the 19-nt small RNAs in the WC library
may result from the increased amount of RNA degradation products caused by the cold treatment.

Overall, approximately one-fourth of miRNAs showed
altered expression (> 3 fold) in the cold-stressed Brachypodium seedlings, while the other miRNAs were expressed
almost equally in the NC and WC libraries. In response to
cold treatment, 3 known miRNAs and 25 predicted miRNAs showed significant changes (≥ 5 fold) in their expression levels. The most obvious change was observed for
miR397, whose expression level increased about 15-fold
in the WC library compared with that the NC library. The
expression of miR169e and miR172b also showed more
than 5-fold of increases in the WC library. The cold-induction of miR172a (about 3-fold) was not as significant as
that of miR172b. Among the 25 predicted miRNAs with
altered expression under cold stress, 6 were up-regulated
and 19 were down-regulated (Table 3) (Additional file 5).

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:449

Based on sequence similarity, these 25 predicted miRNAs
were classified into 18 miRNA families. The sequences of
miR913T, miR914T, miR915T showed high similarity and
could be grouped as one family. It is the same case for
miR911T, miR926T and miR927T as well as miR917T,
miR922T and miR928T. The miR918T and miR919T
could also be grouped as one family. For these miRNA
families, all the members showed decreased expression in
response to the cold treatment. Analysis of the isolation
frequencies for these 25 cold-responsive predicted miRNAs indicated that most of them belonged to the moderately expressed miRNAs, with isolation frequencies in the
range of 10 and 90 (Table 3, Additional file 1). The NC
library was also searched for miRNA* sequences of these
cold-responsive predicted miRNAs, and only the miRNA*
for miR912T and miR918T were found. No miRNA*
sequence was detected for other predicted miRNAs with
cold response, probably because their isolation frequencies, about 10% of the frequencies of mature miRNAs [9],
were too low.
To determine whether the 25 cold-related predicted miRNAs are conserved among other plant species, the nucleotide databases were searched with BLASTn [38] to
identify their homologs and surrounding sequences.
These cold-related predicted miRNAs were also aligned
with the genome of the monocotyledonous model plant
rice (Oryza sativa) http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/
index.shtml using PatScan [51]. Hairpin structures were
predicted for these miRNA homologs with the RNAfold
program http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/ using the
surrounding sequences. Some of these cold-related predicted miRNAs (miR911T-914T, miR918T, miR922T and
miR928T) had homologs in the rice genome, some of
them (miR911T and miR922T) also had homologs in the
wheat and barley genome, but no homolog was found in
the Arabidopsis or Populus genome, suggesting that these
are monocot-specific miRNAs. For some of these coldrelated predicted miRNAs, such as miR901T-906T and
miR923T-927T, no homolog was found in other plant
species, suggesting that they are Brachypodium-specific
miRNAs (Additional file 6).
Experimental validation of the cold-responsive expression
of Brachypodium miRNAs
To confirm the expression of the identified miRNAs and
their response to cold stress, the expression of all the
known cold-responsive miRNAs and all the predicted
miRNAs whose expression changed significantly (> 7
fold) after cold treatment were analyzed. Three known
miRNAs and eight predicted miRNAs were selected for
RNA gel blot analysis. The result showed that the expression of both miR172 and miR397 was up-regulated under
the cold treatment (Figure 4). The expression of miR169e
was difficult to be detected due to its sequence similarity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/449

to other members in the miR169 family and low expression level. Clear changes were observed for the expression
of five analyzed predicted miRNAs (miR911T, miR912T,
miR913T, miR917T, miR918T) after cold treatment (Figure 4). Two of the analyzed predicted miRNAs (miR901T
and miR904T) did not show detectable hybridization signals, probably because their expression level was low (isolation frequency < 25). Their cold-responsive expression
was then validated by Real-time PCR analysis (Additional
file 7).
Target predictions for cold-responsive Brachypodium
miRNAs
It has been shown that plant miRNAs exhibit high degree
of sequence complementarity to their targets, which
allows for effective target prediction [52]. Target prediction analysis, therefore, was performed for the coldrelated bdi-miRNAs. For Brachypodium, only draft genome
sequence is now available, which has been annotated
according to rice gene models as well as grass transcript
assemblies and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The accuracy and reliability of this notation needs further confirmation. The NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and
other database http://brachypodium.pw.usda.gov/ contain Brachypodium ESTs, but the number is limited. Based
on all the available data, the miRNA targets were predicted
manually using the PatScan program [51] with penalty
scores ≤ 3 for mismatched patterns in the miRNA/mRNA
duplexes as described by Lu et al. [53] (Table 5) (Additional file 8).

For conserved miRNAs, their target sites should also be
conserved across different plant species. As expected, the
targets for conserved cold-related miRNAs in our system
were similar or functionally related to previously validated plant miRNA targets. For example, bdi-miR397
could target laccase and laccase precursor (Table 5) (Additional file 8, Additional file 9). Laccase has also been predicted as the target of miR397 in Arabidopsis and rice
[16,54]. Putative targets were also predicted for some
newly identified cold-stress-related miRNAs (Table 5)
(Additional file 8, Additional file 9). The target of this
miR901T, a cold-induced predicted miRNA, is predicted
to be a gene encoding LOB domain protein which is
proved to be involved in various aspects of plant development [55-58].

Discussion
The miRNAs are a group of small non-coding RNAs that
play an important role in various developmental and
stress response processes through negatively controlling
of gene expression [59]. They have been identified in
diverse plant species, and the large-scale miRNA identification in monocots with experimental approaches has
mainly been performed in rice. Although miRNA identifi-

cation has also been reported in wheat [25], extensive
study was hampered by the unavailability of the whole
genome sequence for wheat. Brachypodium, with close
evolutionary relationship to wheat, has recently been proposed as a model temperate grass in monocots. The
genome sequence of Brachypodium distachyon has been

released
http://www.brachypodium.org/;
www.jgi.doe.gov/. To our knowledge, few studies have
been done on identifying and analyzing miRNAs in this
plant species. In this paper, genome-wide analysis of
Brachypodium miRNAs were performed with highthroughput sequencing technology and their response to
cold stress was also analyzed, providing useful information to deepen our understanding of miRNAs in monocotyledonous plants.
The miRNAs in Brachypodium
Solexa sequencing of the Brachypodium small RNA libraries revealed the existence of 27 conserved miRNAs as well
as 129 predicted miRNAs (Table 2, Additional file 1),
indicating that in Brachypodium only a small fraction of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/449

miRNAs are conserved miRNAs, the rest of them appear to
be species-specific miRNAs. Most of the miRNA families
conserved between Arabidopsis, Populus and rice were also
identified in our dataset (Table 2) [1,60]. Sequence analysis indicated that conserved miRNAs in Brachypoidium
showed higher similarity to their homologs in rice than in
Arabidopsis and Populus (Table 2). MiR528, previously
only identified in rice [61], was also found in Brachypodium (Table 2), indicating that it is not specific to rice. For
predicted miRNAs, only these with cold stress response
were further analyzed. Some of them had no homologs in
other plant species and some appeared to be also conserved in wheat, rice and barley, but not in Arabidopsis and
Populus (Additional file 6), indicating that they were either
Brachypodium-specific or monocot-specific miRNAs. The
predicted miRNAs exhibited relatively low expression levels (Additional file 1), in consistent with the notion that
non-conserved miRNAs are often expressed at a lower
level than conserved miRNAs. These miRNAs have not
been reported in other plants before, possibly because
their expression levels are low and need deeper sequencing to be discovered. High-throughput sequencing technology and whole-genome-scale data mining enable us to
discover probably most of the miRNAs in Brachypodium,
which is an important resource for miRNAs analysis. Deep
sequencing of different species of Brachypodium or different kinds of samples may lead us to identify more novel
bdi-miRNAs.
In monocotyledonous plants, the Brachypodium has close
phylogenetic relationships with rice. Both of them belong
to the Poaceae family, with rice in the Ehrhartoideae subfamily and Brachypodium in the Pooideae subfamily. The
miRNAs in rice have been examined extensively. Therefore, deep sequencing analysis of Brachypodium provides a
good chance to compare miRNAs at the whole genome
level in these two closely related plant species. Interestingly, although the bdi-miRNAs and osa-miRNAs show
high sequence similarity, their genome organization and
family size are quite different.
Among the conserved Brachypodium miRNA families,
miR395 is distinguished because its members are clustered in several plant genomes. This family, therefore, has
been selected for genome organization analysis. According to the miRBase http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/, the
miR395 family has multiple clustered members in both
eudicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. It also
appears in Physcomitrella patens, the model moss species,
but only has a single copy. In rice, this family is encoded
by four clusters of 23 genome loci, including two 7-gene
clusters, one 6-gene cluster and one 4-gene cluster. In
Brachypodium, the miR395 family is encoded by 14
genome loci and two clusters are formed (Figure 3), suggesting that duplication evens in Brachypodium are not as

active as that in rice. Although up to now, all the miR395
gene family members in other eudicotyledonous and
monocotyledonous plant genomes are clustered, the
Brachypodium miR395d was not clustered with other paralogs (Figure 3). Because miR395 only has one member in
lower plant Physcomitrella, miR395d may be the ancient
form of this family that is kept unchanged in Brachypodium, possibly under some kind of positive selection. It
has been shown that the origin of the plant miRNAs is
dependent on the occurrence of various duplications,
probably followed by chromosomal rearrangements and
loss of duplicated genes [24,49,62,63]. Thus, an alternative explanation is that the unclustered miR395d may
result from the loss of miR395 genes happened after
duplication events during the evolution of this family. If
this is the case, the loss of miR395 genes probably
occurred after the divergence of Ehrhartoideae (rice) and
Pooideae (Brachypodium), because there is no unclustered
miR395 gene in rice.
Comparative analysis showed that the sizes of conserved
multiple-member miRNA families in Brachypodium were
smaller than those in rice and Populus, most of them have
similar sizes to those in Arabidopsis (Table 4). For example,
seven families (miR156, miR160, miR164, miR166,
miR167, miR171 and miR396) had similar number of
members in Brachypodium and Arabidopsis, but their sizes
were much larger in rice and Populus (Table 4). Considering the genome size of Brachypodium (about 300 Mb, The
International Brachypodium Initiative, http://www.brachy
podium.org/), rice (389 Mb) [64], Arabidopsis (125 Mb)
[65] and Populus (about 410 Mb) [66], it seems that the
size of plant genomes has little effect on the number of
miRNA family members. The genome size of Brachypodium is close to that of rice and Populus, compared with the
size of the Arabidopsis genome. The miRNA families in
Brachypodium, however, had much fewer members than
those in rice and Populus (Table 4). One reasonable explanation is that the duplication events during the evolution
of these miRNA families in Brachypodium are less active or
the selection pressure on duplicated miRNAs is higher
than that in rice and Populus.
The great difference in miRNA family size and genomic
organization between Brachypodium and rice indicates that

miRNA genes change their copy numbers and genome
positions actively, probably to provide dosage effects or
different regulatory patterns (the expression of miRNA
genes is affected by surrounding sequences) in target gene
regulation. In addition, these data show that the evolution
of miRNA families in Brachypodium is not as active as that
in rice, suggesting that Brachypodium could be used as a
new platform for miRNA studies in monocots.
The cold-responsive miRNAs in Brachypodium
Although miRNAs have been shown to play an important
role in plant cold stress response, little information is
available for monocotyledonous plants in this area [1619]. Brachypodium is a potential model species for the cool
season triticeae crops [28-31]. To study the cold-responsive miRNAs in this plant will provide useful information
for improving the cold tolerance of economically important crops. In this study, the expression levels of miRNAs
in Brachypodium with and without cold treatment were
compared and the results indicated that the expression of
about one-fourth of miRNAs was affected by cold stress.
Among them, 3 conserved miRNAs (miR169e, miR172b
and miR397) and 25 predicted miRNAs showed significant changes (Table 3, Figure 4, Additional file 7).

These 3 known cold-responsive miRNAs are conserved
among dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants.
MiR397 was shown to be cold responsive in Arabidopsis by
sequencing of the stress-related small RNA library [16].
Then, miR169 and miR172 were found to be responsive
to cold stress in Arabidopsis both through a computational,
transcriptome-based approach and by microarray analysis
almost simultaneously [17,18]. MiR169 and miR397
were also shown to be cold-upregulated in Populus [19].
The detection of the cold-induced expression for these
miRNAs in Brachypodium indicates that they are also
involved in cold stress response in monocotyledonous
plants. Some previously identified cold-responsive conserved miRNAs, such as miR402 in Arabidopsis [16], were
not found in our small RNA library, nor are they found in
rice, suggesting that they probably are species-specific
miRNAs and do not exist in Brachypodium. Some miRNAs,
including miR166, miR319, miR393, and miR396,
respond to cold stress in Arabidopsis [16,17], but in our
experiment no obvious change was found for these miR-

NAs after the cold treatment. One explanation for these
discrepancies is that the induction levels of these miRNAs
are too low to be recognized as significant changes in our
experimental system. It is also possible that these miRNAs
show cold stress response only in specific tissues or at specific developmental stages in Brachypodium.
Previous studies put great emphasis on the cold-induced
miRNAs, whereas the cold-suppressed miRNAs have
received little research attention. Our study indicated that
about one-third of cold-responsive miRNAs were up-regulated and two-thirds of them were down-regulated, indicating that both kinds of regulation for miRNAs were
involved in cold response (Table 3, Figure 4). Interestingly, in our study all the cold-responsive miRNAs conserved in diverse plant species were up-regulated under
cold stress condition. For the 19 cold-down-regulated predicted miRNAs, their expression was relatively low (Table
3, Additional file 1). These data suggest that Brachypodium
responds to cold stress through both up- and down-regulation of miRNA expression, in which the up-regulation is
conserved and probably more important in cold response.

Conclusion
We have performed a genome-wide analysis of miRNAs in
Brachypodium, providing a relatively complete view of bdimiRNAs. Taking advantage of the good reproducibility of
high-throughput sequencing, cold-responsive conserved
as well as predicted Brachypodium miRNAs were identified,
delivering new insights into the role of miRNAs in cold
response of winter-habit monocotyledonous plants.
Comparative studies of miRNAs in Brachypodium and rice
suggest that the composition and location of miRNA families are different even in closely related plant species. Our
study provides useful information for further analysis in
this area. Characterization of miRNA targets and exploring miRNA regulation mechanism will deepen our understanding of plant miRNAs.

Methods
Plant material and growth conditions
Seeds of the Brachypodium distachyon (L.) Beauv. diploid
line ABR5 were placed in petri dishes containing two layers of damp sterile filter paper. The seeds were first stratified at 4°C for one week to promote synchronous
germination, then grown in a growth chamber at 24°C
under a 16 hour/8 hour (light/dark) photoperiod with
light intensity of approximately 5,000 lux.
Small RNA library construction and Solexa sequencing
For small RNA library construction and deep sequencing,
total RNA were isolated from 12-day-old seedlings using
mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA)
following the manufacturer's protocol. The aerial part of
seedlings treated or untreated with cold stress (4°C for 24

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/449

hour) were pooled and used for construction of the WC
and NC small RNA libraries, respectively. For each library,
approximately 20 μg of small RNA were subjected for
sequencing using the Illumina-Solexa 1 G Genetic Analyzer in the Beijing Genomics Institute, according to the
manufacturer's protocols. Briefly, the Solexa sequencing
was performed as follows: RNA was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to enrich for molecules in the
range of 17-27 nt, then was ligated with 5' and 3' adapters.
The resulted samples were used as templates for cDNA
synthesis followed by PCR amplification. The obtained
sequencing libraries were subjected to Solexa's sequencing-by-synthesis method. After the run, image analysis,
sequencing quality evaluation and data production summarization were performed with Illumina/Solexa Pipeline.
Bioinformatic analysis
High-quality small RNA reads larger than 18 nt were
extracted from raw reads and mapped to the Brachypodium
draft genome sequences obtained from the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute http://www.brach
ypodium.org/; http://www.jgi.doe.gov/ using SOAP [35].
Matched sequences were then queried against non-coding
RNAs from Rfam database http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Soft
ware/Rfam and NCBI Genbank database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi by performing
BLASTn search [38]. Any small RNAs having exact
matches to these sequences were excluded from further
analysis. MiRNAs were predicted with MIREAP https://
sourceforge.net/projects/mireap/. The secondary structures of the predicted miRNAs were confirmed by RNAfold http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi.

The miRNA target candidates were predicted using the
PatScan program [51] based on methods described in
[53], with penalty scores ≤ 3 for mismatched patterns in
the miRNA/mRNA duplexes. Putative target genes were
manually selected from these candidates based on their
localization in the Brachypodium genome http://
www.brachybase.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/brachy_core/.
Functions of the predicted target genes were assigned
manually according to the functions of the best hits from
the BLAST search [38,67] against the NCBI database http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi.
For predicted novel miRNA sequences, their conservation
in other plant species was examined by searching the
nucleotide databases with BLASTn [38] to identify their
homologs and surrounding sequences. These cold-related
miRNAs were also aligned with the rice genomes http://
www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/index.shtml using PatScan
[51]. To analyze whether the matched sequence could
form a suitable hairpin, sequences surrounding the
matched sequence (100~200 nt to either side) were

extracted and run through RNAfold http://rna.tbi.uni
vie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi.
RNA gel blot analysis
Approximately 20 μg of total RNA (prepared as described
above) was separated on 15% polyacrylamide denaturing
gels. RNAs were then electrophoretically transferred to
Hybond-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Little
Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Membranes were chemically crosslinked mediated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) as described by [68] and hybridized with DNA
oligonucleotides complementary to predicted miRNA
sequences, which had been end-labelled with [γ-32P]ATP
by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Non-incorporated nucleotides were
removed using microspin G-25 column (GE Healthcare
UK Ltd., Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Membranes were prehybridized for at least 3 hour and hybridized overnight at 37°C in ULTRAhyb-Oligo hybridization
buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The membranes were
briefly air dried and then exposed to x-ray films for autography at -80°C. Images were acquired by scanning the
films.
