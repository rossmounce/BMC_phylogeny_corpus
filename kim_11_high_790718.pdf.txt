Abstract
Background: Koreans are generally considered a Northeast Asian group, thought to be related to Altaic-languagespeaking populations. However, recent findings have indicated that the peopling of Korea might have been more
complex, involving dual origins from both southern and northern parts of East Asia. To understand the male
lineage history of Korea, more data from informative genetic markers from Korea and its surrounding regions are
necessary. In this study, 25 Y-chromosome single nucleotide polymorphism markers and 17 Y-chromosome short
tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci were genotyped in 1,108 males from several populations in East Asia.
Results: In general, we found East Asian populations to be characterized by male haplogroup homogeneity,
showing major Y-chromosomal expansions of haplogroup O-M175 lineages. Interestingly, a high frequency (31.4%)
of haplogroup O2b-SRY465 (and its sublineage) is characteristic of male Koreans, whereas the haplogroup
distribution elsewhere in East Asian populations is patchy. The ages of the haplogroup O2b-SRY465 lineages
(~9,900 years) and the pattern of variation within the lineages suggested an ancient origin in a nearby part of
northeastern Asia, followed by an expansion in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula. In addition, the coalescence
time (~4,400 years) for the age of haplogroup O2b1-47z, and its Y-STR diversity, suggest that this lineage probably
originated in Korea. Further studies with sufficiently large sample sizes to cover the vast East Asian region and
using genomewide genotyping should provide further insights.
Conclusions: These findings are consistent with linguistic, archaeological and historical evidence, which suggest
that the direct ancestors of Koreans were proto-Koreans who inhabited the northeastern region of China and the
Korean Peninsula during the Neolithic (8,000-1,000 BC) and Bronze (1,500-400 BC) Ages.

Background
The Koreans are geographically a Northeast Asian group,
who are thought to be most closely related to Altaic language-speaking populations. Anthropological and archaeological evidence suggests that the early Korean
population was related to Mongolian ethnic groups, who
inhabited the general area of the Altai Mountains and the
Lake Baikal regions of southeastern Siberia [1]. Based on
archaeological data, the earliest modern human lithic cultures date from 25,000 to 45,000 years ago in the Altai

Mountains and southeastern Siberia and the Korean
Peninsula [2,3]. According to Korea’s founding myths,
the Gojoseon (the first state-level society) was established
around 2,333 BC in the region of southern Manchuria,
but later stretched from the northeastern region of China
to the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. Thus, the
ancient Koreans (proto-Koreans) may have shared a
common origin with the Northeast Asian groups who
inhabited the general area of the southeastern Siberia and
Manchuria during the Neolithic (8,000-1,000 BC) and
Bronze (1,500-400 BC) Ages [1,4].
However, like many debates on the genetic history of
human populations, the origin of the Korean population
remains controversial. Studies of classic genetic markers
have shown that, among the East Asians, Koreans tend

to have the closest genetic affinity with Mongolians
[5,6]. These findings support the first model, that a
northeastern Asian origin is most likely, followed by a
southeastward migration into the Korean Peninsula. The
second model suggests a bi- and/or multidirectional
route, with one migration through northeastern Asia
and one through southeastern Asia. Recent surveys of
genetic variation using two haploid markers (mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome) showed that the
Korean population contains lineages typical of both
Southeast and Northeast Asian populations [7-9]. These
results led us to consider that the peopling of Korea
might have involved multiple events, and that different
aspects might be revealed by appropriate additional
genetic markers and DNA samples.
Based on recent studies of Y-chromosome variation,
the East Asian gene pool is almost completely contained
within three major Y-chromosome lineages (haplogroups
C, D and K) [7,10]. East Asian populations have major
expansions of haplogroup O-M175 lineages (a lineage
within K), although there are significant genetic differences in other lineages between the populations [8,11].
Most Y chromosomes found in the Korean population
also belong to haplogroup O-M175 and its sublineages
[8,9]. The Korean population has a high frequency of the
haplogroup O3-M122 lineage, which is shared mainly
with Chinese and Southeast Asian populations. By contrast, the haplogroup O2b-SRY465 lineages (and its sublineage) are found with high frequency and diversity
specifically among modern populations of Japan and
Korea [8,12,13]. These chromosomes are absent in most
populations in China, but they have been detected in
some samples of Beijing-Han Chinese, Manchurians,
Mongolians and Southeast Siberians [7,8,14].
Hammer and Horai [12] hypothesized that the haplogroup O2b-SRY465 and its sublineage, O2b1-47z,
might be Yayoi male lineages, which contributed to the
contemporary mainland Japanese population via a process of demic diffusion during the Yayoi period from
the Korean Peninsula, around 2,300 years ago. Hammer
et al. [13] also suggested that the haplogroup O2b1-47z
mutation arose on an ancestral O2b-SRY465 chromosome during early phases of the Yayoi migration. This
lineage is also distributed sporadically in the Mongol,
Manchu and Southeast Siberian populations, and in
Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Micronesia
[8,13,14]. Lin et al. [15] suggested that the O2b1-47z Y
chromosome associated with the Y2 allele might have
originated from an ancestral population in Henan or the
southern parts of Shanxi near the Yellow River in China.
Thus, to understand the male lineage history of Korea,
more data from such informative genetic markers from
Korea and its surrounding regions are necessary. In the
present study, 25 Y-chromosome single-nucleotide

polymorphism (Y-SNP) markers and 17 Y-chromosome
short tandem repeat (Y-STR) loci (Yfiler) were genotyped in 1,108 men from East Asian, several populations, to not only identify haplogroup O2b lineages and
trace their migration history, but also to distinguish
populations with different genetic backgrounds.

Methods
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee and
institutional review boards of Institute of Bio-Science
and Technology in the Dankook University. Separate
written informed consent was obtained for enrollment
from all participants.
Subjects

In this study, we analyzed 1,108 men, representatives of
several East Asian populations (Korean, Japanese, Mongolian, Chinese, Indonesian, Filipino, Thai, Vietnamese;
Table 1). The DNA samples included subsets of the
samples examined by Kim et al. [16] and Jin et al. [8],
although the exact number of subjects for each population occasionally varied between the studies. In addition,
we included new Korean samples collected from 506
people residing in six major provinces in Korea [17].
DNA was prepared from whole blood taken from each
participant by a standard method [18], or extracted
from buccal cells as previously described [19].
Y-SNP genotyping

Initially all the samples were analyzed for 12 Y-SNP markers (M9, M45, M89, M119, M122, M174, M175, M214,
P31, SRY465, 47z and RPS4Y) using a previously
described protocol [17]. The samples belonging to haplogroups C, D, K, NO, O3 and P were subjected to
further typing with an additional 13 Y-SNP markers to
designate the subclades: two three-plex, three two-plex
and one single-plex SNaPshot assay were developed for
these 13 Y-SNP markers (Figure 1). The nomenclature of
the haplogroups followed that of the Y Chromosome
Consortium [20]. Primers for PCR and single-base extension (SBE) reactions were designed (Primer 3.0 program;
http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/, Cambridge, MA, USA)
(see Additional file 1, Table S1; see Additional file 2,
Table S2). Conditions of the SNaPshot assays were the
same as those previously described [17], with the exception of PCR purification; in our assay, the PCR products
were purified by adding 2 μl of an exonuclease I-shrimp
alkaline phosphatase preparation (Exo-SAP; USB Corp.,
Cleveland, OH, USA) to 5 μl PCR product.

DYS438 and DYS448) were amplified (AmpFlSTR Yfiler
kit; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using a genetic analyzer (ABI Prism 3730; Applied Biosystems) and
accompanying software (GeneMapper ID v3.2; Applied
Biosystems). Alleles were named according to the
recommendations of the International Society of Forensic Genetics [21]. The 25 Y-SNP markers and 17 Y-STR
loci of the 1,108 men in this study have been submitted
to the Y Chromosome Haplotype Reference Database
(Table 1).
Data analysis

The genetic differentiation between different population
samples and its statistical significance were assessed via
FST (Y-SNP) values. The population genetic structure of
the ethnic and/or regional groups was assessed by analysis
of molecular variance (AMOVA) using the RST (Y-STR)

values [22]. The calculations of diversity indices, F ST
and AMOVA were performed using Arlequin software
(v3.0; http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin3/) [23].
Population pairwise FST values were visualized by multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot analyses (PASW Statistics 17; SPSS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Haplotype
diversity and mean number of pairwise differences of
15 Y-STR markers (excluding DYS385a/b in Yfiler)
linked with the haplogroups O2b*, O2b1, O3 and C
were also calculated (Arlequin 3.0 package) [23]. In
addition, the genetic diversity of average variance ratio
for the Y-STR markers was estimated, as described
previously [24]. Median-joining (MJ) network [25] of
the haplogroups O2b*, O2b1, O3 and C was constructed from the data of nine Y-STRs (NETWORK
4.5 software; http://www.fluxus-technology.com). The
MJ network was constructed by weighting 99 (47z), 10
(DYS438, DYS392), nine (DYS393), eight (DYS437,

DYS390), five (DYS391, DYS19), two (DYS389I) and
one (DYS439) [26]. Coalescence times for subsets of
chromosomes defined by the SNP markers were estimated (BATWING; http://www.mas.ncl.ac.uk/~nijw/)
[27], assuming a generation time of 30 years. Locusspecific STR mutation rates (father-son mutation rates)
based on previously described measurements, and various demographic models, were tested in different runs
of the program [28].

Results and discussion
This survey of East Asian Y-SNPs identified 18 haplogroups, 15 of which were present in our Korean group
(Table 2; see Additional file 3, Table S3). In general, we
found the East Asian population groups to be characterized by male haplogroup homogeneity, showing mostly
expansions of haplogroup O-M175 lineages (Figure 2).

the most frequent found in Koreans, and accounted for
28.9, 22.5, 15.0, 12.3 and 8.9% of Korean Y chromosomes, respectively.
O3-M122 was the commonest Chinese Y-chromosome
haplogroup found, and its presence in Korea may originate from demic diffusion by way of south-to-north
migration [9,29,30]. C-RPS4Y was the commonest Mongolian Y-chromosome haplogroup (C3 lineage), and this
is shared primarily with populations in northern Asia
(including Koreans) [9,31,32]. Our network and diversity
analyses of C-RPS4Y and O3 may support a southern

origin that migrated into East Asia via the southern
route [10,29] (Figure 3, Table 3). Interestingly, our Japanese group seemed to have both C1-M105 and C3M217 chromosomes, whereas haplogroup C1-M105 was
not present in most East Asian populations (except for
Koreans), consistent with the previous report of Hammer et al. [13]. Haplogroup D2-M55 was found at high
frequency only in Japanese subjects (29.3%), including
1.6% of Koreans, whereas it was absent elsewhere in
these East Asian populations, except for the Beijing-Han
group. Haplogroup D1-M15 was present at extremely

low frequencies in the other East Asian populations. The
occurrence of C1 and D2 chromosomes in Korea may
be considered concordant with the historical views
about the recent connection between the Korean and
Japanese populations.
Haplogroup N-M231 was present in the Korean and
Mongolian groups at moderate frequencies, suggesting
that the early Korean population may have shared a
common origin with Mongolian ethnic groups who
inhabited the general area of the Altai Mountains and
Lake Baikal regions of southeastern Siberia [1]. The
K-M9 defined chromosomes (L, Q and R subtypes) were
also found at low frequencies in the Korean group, and
these mainly occur in central and south Asia [13,33].

The presence of these haplogroups in the Korean population implies that the peopling of Korea probably
involved multiple events [8,9]. Based on the result of the
MDS plot (Figure 4 and Additional file 4, Table S4), the
Korean population contains lineages from both the
southern and northern areas of East Asia.
The geographical distribution of the O2b*-SRY465
(and its sublineage; together designated O2b-SRY465)
in East Asia is shown in Figure 2. Interestingly, we
found the high frequency of haplogroup O2b*-SRY465
to be characteristic of Koreans, (22.5%), but its distribution elsewhere in the East Asian populations was
very patchy (Table 2, Figure 2). The cluster pattern in
the O2b*-SRY465 network (Figure 3) was indicative of

both northeastern and southeastern Asia. The genetic
differences between the Korean and other East Asian
populations were analyzed by AMOVA (Table 4).

When samples were grouped into Southeast Asians
(SEA) and Northeast Asians (NEA), AMOVA could
not distinguish between them. In addition, Koreans
were again not distinct from either SEA or NEA, indicating that a southern versus a northern origin could

not be distinguished from the Y-STR based comparison (Table 4).
Previous studies suggested a southeastern Asian origin
for O2b-SRY465 [8,13], because the entire haplogroup
O in East Asia has been proposed to have a southeastern Asian origin [10]. Under the southern origin
hypothesis of the Y chromosome in Asia, no extensive
bottleneck or genetic isolation are expected in far-east
Asia, because there is no obvious barrier except perhaps
a linguistic one (Sino-Tibetan-speaking people versus
Altaic-speaking people) [34]. The very low incidence of
the O2b*-SRY465 haplogroup in our Chinese population
group is a substantial departure from the southernexpansion hypothesis of O2b*-SRY465, and indicates
that O2b*-SRY465 has undergone apparent long-term
isolation in far-east Asia. Therefore, it is unlikely that
southeastern Asia is the place of the early settlement of
modern humans carrying O2b chromosomes. In contrast to some other sublineages within haplogroup O,
the diversity of O2b*-SRY465 calculated in a previous
study [13] indicated that northern populations in East
Asia are more polymorphic than southern populations,
implying a northern Asian origin of O2b*-SRY465, in
accordance with its highest frequency distribution pattern in far-east Asia [14,35]. However, as to the issue of
whether haplotype originated in prehistoric Korea or in
the Japanese Archipelago within northeastern Asia, the
most likely region can again be identified on the basis of
the highest frequency and the highest diversity.

Although there was an expected error due to small sample size, the Y-STR diversities (for example, mean number of pairwise differences and average variance ratio)
were higher in Koreans than in Japanese (Table 5), consistent with previous results [13]. Both the haplogroup
diversity and haplogroup frequency of O2b*-SRY465
thus suggest its early settlement in prehistoric Korea.
Age estimates based on our Y-STR data provide
further support for the initial expansion of the O2b*SRY465 in prehistoric Korea, in accordance with the
proto-Korean lineages. Based on the Korean demographic and population history, a constant population in
three different BATWING models may give the best fit
to our data. Thus, time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the O2b*-SRY465 lineages was 9,900
years, assuming constant population size (Table 6).
According to the three different population expansion
models, TMRCA within the Korean and Japanese populations and the whole of East Asia ranged from 6,00010,000 years ago. This date corresponds to the early
Neolithic Age in Korea. Therefore, the age of the O2b*SRY465 and pattern of variation within the lineages suggests a Neolithic proto-Korean founder in a nearby part
of northeastern Asia, followed by a population increase
in the vicinity of the Korean Peninsula.
Interestingly, the O2b1-47z sublineage seems to have
diverged about 4,400 years ago (Table 6) rather than in
the Yayoi period, consistent with a previous estimate of
4,000 years ago [13]. Therefore, the present data support

Constant then expanding

the possibility of an ancient Korean origin of O2b1-47z,
rather than a Japanese origin [13]. Although O2b1-47z
is at its highest haplogroup frequency in the Japanese
population, the Y-STR data reveal more diversity of
O2b1-47z haplotypes in Koreans, as shown by the mean
number of pairwise differences and allele size variation
ratio (Table 5), supporting an origin of the O2b1-47z
mutation in prehistoric Korea. The Japanese samples
studied here were derived from Kyushu, Shikoku and
southern Honshu (the region closest to Korea), implying
that the high frequency of the O2b1 lineage in Japan
may be explained by genetic drift [12,16]. This finding is
concordant with a previous report of Nonaka et al. [36],
showing less diversity in Japan than in Korea (Table 5).
TMRCA of O2b1-47z, and a star-cluster pattern in this
study (Figure 3) and a previous study [13], all suggest
the possible association of O2b1-47z with the peopling
of Korea. However, because most of the Japanese O2b*SRY465 and O2b1-47z samples were also in the core (or
close to) of the cluster (Figure 3), it cannot exclude the
possibility that the Japanese and the Koreans derive
from the same proto-population outside of Korea (carrying these lineages) at roughly the same time. Thus,
further studies of sufficient sampling in the vast East
Asian region and genomewide genotyping should provide further insights.

Conclusions
Our results support the idea that both haplogroups
O2b*-SRY465 and O2b1-47z had an in situ origin
among Northeast Asians, particularly among the prehistoric Koreans, rather than in southeast Asia or Japan as
previously envisaged. The combination of the O2b initial
settlement (which became an indigenous proto-Korean
component) in part with the relatively recent O3 and
C3 lineages (which include a Chinese component)
explains some of the main events formulating the current Y chromosome composition of the Korean population. Thus, our findings are consistent with linguistic,
archaeological and historical evidence, which suggest
that the direct ancestors of Koreans were proto-Koreans
who inhabited the northeastern region of China and the
Korean Peninsula during the Neolithic (8,000-1,000 BC)
and Bronze (1,500-400 BC) Ages.
