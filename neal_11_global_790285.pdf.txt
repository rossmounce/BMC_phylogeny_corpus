Abstract
Background: Aspergillus terreus causes invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised individuals and can be
the leading cause of IA in certain medical centers. We examined a large isolate collection (n = 117) for the
presence of cryptic A. terreus species and employed a genome scanning method, Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat
(ISSR) PCR to determine A. terreus population structure.
Results: Comparative sequence analyses of the calmodulin locus revealed the presence of the recently recognized
species A. alabamensis (n = 4) in this collection. Maximum parsimony, Neighbor joining, and Bayesian clustering of
the ISSR data from the 113 sequence-confirmed A. terreus isolates demonstrated that one clade was composed
exclusively of isolates from Europe and another clade was enriched for isolates from the US.
Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a population structure linked to geographical origin in A. terreus.

Background
Aspergillus species are believed to be cosmopolitan
organisms, existing as unstructured global populations.
Species belonging to this taxon, including A. fumigatus,
A. terreus, A. flavus and others, cause invasive aspergillosis (IA) predominantly in severely immunocompromised individuals. The majority of studies with A.
fumigatus have demonstrated no association between
genotypes and geography. Several studies employing
comparative sequence analysis of different loci, including
protein coding, intergenic and microsatellite containing
regions, arrived at the conclusion that there was no correlation between genotype and geographical origin
among A. fumigatus isolates [1-3]. In contrast to these
observations, one study demonstrated the presence of
multiple, well-supported phylogenetic clusters amongst
A. fumigatus isolates from a collection of isolates geographically dispersed across North America [4]. The
locus sequenced was a single gene encoding a putative
cell surface protein, Afu3g08990 (CSP), in which

polymorphisms consisted of insertions and deletions
within a repeat region. The authors speculated that the
presence of clusters may have been undetected previously due to the reliance on data from loci lacking sufficient polymorphisms.
Aspergillus terreus is the second or third most common etiological agent of IA and interestingly, appears to
be the most common cause of infection in some medical
centers, suggesting ecological specificity for this organism [5-7]. Previous efforts to determine population
structure in A. terreus have been hampered by the lack
of reliable methods for exploiting genetic variability to
distinguish or group isolates. Balajee et al., employing a
multi-gene sequencing approach to a large global collection of isolates previously identified as A. terreus,
showed that no evidence of endemism existed but were
able to define a genotypically distinct species, A. alabamensis [8]. The use of multi-locus comparative sequence
analysis to explore population structure in A. terreus
supported the existence of a single globally distributed
population [8]. On the other hand, multiple studies
using molecular fingerprinting methods, including
RAPD, demonstrated high genotypic diversity among A.
terreus isolates [9,10], with no evidence of endemism

[9,11]. Thus, even as new species are defined within
groups of isolates identified as A. terreus, support for
the idea that A. terreus exists as a single, genotypically
diverse, global population, lacking phylogeographic
structure, continues [8-10].
A recent study investigating amphotericin B (AMB)
susceptibility of a worldwide A. terreus collection found
that isolates recovered from different parts of the world
had different patterns of AMB susceptibility [12]. At
that time, no attempt was made to study the association
between genotypic relatedness and antifungal susceptibility in this set of isolates. In the present investigation,
this A. terreus isolate collection was genotyped employing the highly discriminatory genome-wide DNA fingerprinting method, Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR)
PCR [13] to (a) assess the use of this fingerprinting
method for discriminatory genotyping of A. terreus; (b)
evaluate the association between AMB susceptibility and
genotype in this global collection of isolates; and (c)
attempt to map geography onto genotypically related
clusters of isolates. Results of this study revealed the
possible global sub-structuring of genotypes and the
presence of the recently described cryptic species A. alabamensis in Italy.

Methods
Fungal Strains and genomic DNA Isolation

A total of 117 clinical A. terreus isolates originating
from France or Belgium (28 isolates), Italy (46 isolates),
and the Eastern (22 isolates) and Western (21 isolates)
United States were available for analyses from the previously performed study [12]. All isolates were subcultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) plates in
preparation for genomic DNA isolation.
For genomic DNA extraction, fungal material was
removed from plates and disrupted using an Omni
mixer (Omni International, Warrenton, VA) in the presence of ATL buffer from the DNeasy Blood and Tissue
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The disrupted material
was incubated at 55°C for one hour with vortexing every
15 min. DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Genomic DNA quality was checked
with electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel (Roche, Manheim, Germany) and quantity was measured with the
nanodrop spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 260A
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).
Comparative Sequence Analysis of the calmodulin gene

Portions of the calmodulin locus (calM) were PCR
amplified and sequenced as previously described [8].
The resultant nucleotide sequences were edited with
SeqMan Pro Ver 8.0.2 software (DNASTAR, Inc.,

Page 2 of 7

Madison, WI). Edited sequences were aligned using
Bioedit Sequence Alignment Editor Ver 7.0.9.0. Reference sequences were downloaded from GenBank and
the software program GARLI [Genetic Algorithm for
Rapid Likelihood Inference] was used to generate the
maximum likelihood (ML) tree [14].
Development of ISSR Fingerprinting Method

The ISSR primers were designed to flank di-, tri- and
tetra-nucleotide repeats. A total of ten repeat primers
were synthesized: two di-nuclotide [DDB(nn)8], five trinucleotide [DDB(nnn)5], and three tetranuclotide [DDB
(nnnn) 4 ] (capital letters denote degenerate sites: B
denotes nucleotides c, g, or t; D denotes a, g, or t; subscripts indicate the number of repeats) and 5’ labeled
with 6-carboxyfluorescein dye (6-FAM) at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention Biotechnology Core
Facility (Atlanta, GA) (Table 1).
Initially, ten ISSR primers were tested for their ability
to generate reproducible, complex fingerprinting patterns on a panel of 40 A. terreus isolates randomly
selected from the global isolate collection. For PCR
amplification, 3-5 μl of genomic DNA was used as the
template in a final reaction volume of 25 μl consisting
of PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 50
mM KCl, pH 8.3); 0.2 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP,
and dTTP; 2 pmol of a single primer; and 1.3 U of Taq
DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany). Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp
PCR system 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA). Initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min
was followed by 36 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 45
s, and 72°C for 2 min. The last cycle was followed by a
final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Fluorescently labeled
PCR products were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI 3130 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 0.5 μl of a 1:10 dilution of PCR
product was added to 0.25 μl GeneScanTM 1200 LIZ

(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The 10 μl samples
were denatured by heating to 95°C for 3 min., cooled
and run on a 50 cm array in the POP-7 polymer matrix
using the 1200LIZ run module.
Four of the ten primers tested produced complex,
reproducible, banding patterns over multiple PCR reactions and a series of DNA concentrations, and these
four ISSR primers were therefore selected for the analysis of the remaining sequence-confirmed A. terreus
isolates.

Subtyping of the global A. terreus isolates

Fingerprints for all of the sequence-confirmed A. terreus
isolates were generated using four ISSR primers that
were selected after initial screening as described above.
GeneMapper v4.0 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA)
was used to assign fragment sizes to the PCR products.
Fragments identified using GeneMapper software were
converted to binary data with a “0” representing the
absence and a “1” representing the presence of an allele.
The binary strings of data representing the fingerprint
generated by each primer were concatenated in Excel
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) to form a single, continuous, binary string incorporating the results
from all primers. Alleles that appeared in all or fewer
than 10% of isolates were excluded from the analysis.
Phylogenetic trees and Bayesian clusters were generated
from identical binary data sets.
Phylogenetic Analysis of ISSR data

Neighbor-joining (NJ) trees were generated by PAUP
[Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other
Methods)] [15]. PHYLIP [Phylogeny Inference Package]
[16] was used to produce the parsimony tree. Bayesian
clustering was performed using the program STRUCTURE [17].

Results
Species Confirmation

The ML tree was generated using 484 contiguous bases
of aligned sequence from the calM locus of the 117 A.
terreus isolates and additional reference section Terrei
sequences acquired from GenBank. One hundred and
thirteen isolates clustered with the reference A. terreus
isolates and four isolates, three from the Eastern United
States and one from Italy, grouped with the A. alabamensis type isolate (Figure 1).

tetranuclotide repeat flanking primer (ISSR 7, 9, 10 and
13 respectively) (Table 1). These four ISSR primers were
used to generate fingerprints for all of the sequenceconfirmed A. terreus isolates. The A. alabamensis isolates were not fingerprinted. ISSR subtyping of 113 A.
terreus revealed 111 unique genotypes with only two
isolates, both from the same center in the Eastern United States, demonstrating identical fingerprinting
patterns.
Data from the ISSR fingerprints were analyzed using
three phylogenetic algorithms. For the purposes of this
manuscript, clusters were defined as groupings generated using Bayesian posterior probability while clades
were defined as groupings generated using NJ and parsimony. Bayesian clustering of the ISSR data using
STRUCTURE supported the presence of three clusters
among the isolates (Figure 2). Both Maximum parsimony (not shown) and NJ trees (Figure 3) were in
agreement with the clusters defined by STRUCTURE.
Although there was no significant bootstrap support for
two of the clades on the NJ tree [1] and [3], support for
clade 2 was 94%. Clade 1, composed exclusively of isolates from Europe, contained 27 of the 113 isolates. Sixteen isolates in this European clade were from Italy and
11 isolates were from Belgium or France. The type of
line in Figure 3 indicates the cluster membership of
each isolate on the NJ tree and illustrates the correlation
between clades and clusters. Bayesian clustering of the
ISSR data also supported the existence of the European
clade. (Figure 3) The European cluster 1, as revealed by

STRUCTURE, contained 34 isolates while the European
clade 1 (NJ and MP algorithms) contained 27 of the
same isolates. Many European isolates did not, however,
fall into the exclusively European cluster or clade.
A significant relationship existed between geography
and cluster membership (X2 = 48.2, d.f. = 6, p < 0.001),
driven primarily by cluster 1 being composed only of
isolates from Europe, as well as cluster 2 accounting for
the majority [12 of 19] of the sequence-confirmed Eastern U.S. A. terreus isolates (Figure 2). The patterns of
cluster membership in the two US populations were
similar to each other and quite different from the pattern shared by the two European populations (Figure 2).
There were nine isolates in which the majority contribution from any cluster was less than 0.66, suggesting that
these isolates did not consistently fall into any one cluster. These isolates were excluded from any single cluster
due to their high levels of inferred admixture.
Susceptibility testing to AMB

Susceptibility testing to AMB for all the isolates analyzed in this investigation was available through a previous study summarized in Table 1 of Tortorano et al

[12]. The isolates in each of the three clusters varied in
mean MIC values (0.78, 1.29 and 0.86 mg/L for clusters
1, 2 and 3 respectively (Table 2). The MIC values of
cluster 1 and 2 were significantly different (2-tailed ttest, p < 0.05,), but the difference between clusters 1
and 3, and 2 and 3 were not statistically significant. The
isolates from different geographic locations also varied
in mean MIC values but were not significantly different
(data not shown).

Discussion
Extensive genotypic diversity has long been known in A.
terreus, and recently a cryptic species, A alabamensis,
was discovered among isolates originally identified as A.
terreus [8]. In the current study, we report the presence
of four A. alabamensis isolates, identified by comparative sequence analysis of a previously characterized single locus gene (calM), from a collection of clinical

isolates defined as A. terreus. Three A. alabamensis isolates were recovered from North America and one originated from Italy, making this the first reported A.
alabamensis isolate recovered outside of North America.
In contrast to a previous study that found that A. alabamensis had decreased in vitro susceptibility to AMB [8],
all four A. alabamensis isolates recovered in this study
had similar MIC patterns against AMB as compared to
A. terreus (data not shown). None of the A. alabamensis
isolates recovered in this study were colonizers (David
Stevens, personal communication), a finding that was
different from the study of Balajee et al. [8].
It has been postulated that unique A. terreus genotypes may occupy particular environmental niches associated with certain geographical areas. To test this
hypothesis, Lass-Florl et al. [9] conducted a molecular
epidemiological study using RAPD which explored the
genotypes of clinical isolates recovered from two

Neal et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:203
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/203

medical centers that more frequently reported A. terreus
infections. Results of this study reported a great diversity
of genotypes among isolates from both centers and
revealed no evidence of endemicity among the isolates
at either center. Another study investigating in vitro
activity of AMB against a large global collection of clinical isolates suggested that isolates from different parts
of the world could have differences in AMB susceptibility [12]. Tortorano et al. [12] found that of the four geographic locations where isolates originated, the average
MIC of the isolates from the Eastern United States were
statistically different from those of the isolates from the
other three geographical regions namely, Italy, FranceBelgium, and the Western United States, suggesting a
possible association between geography and MIC. We
postulated that an association between geography and
genotype may also exist in this population and that ISSR
fingerprinting may be a superior way to assess population structure in these isolates.
Results of our study demonstrated high genotypic
diversity within these isolates with only two isolates displaying identical fingerprinting patterns. In spite of this
high genotypic diversity, sufficient common markers
existed between isolates to group them into distinct
clades supported by multiple phylogenetic methods.
Specifically, Bayesian clustering in the program STRUCTURE revealed 3 distinct clusters of isolates that were
in agreement with the clades inferred by NJ. Cluster 2
(Figure 2 and 3) generated by STRUCTURE shares the
isolates in clade 2 of the NJ tree which had the highest
bootstrap support of any clade. This suggests that these
isolates share alleles that are less enriched in isolates
from the other two clades, and thus may be the most
ancient group. Isolates in cluster 1 were restricted to
Europe, while isolates in cluster 2 were most commonly
recovered from the U.S., and cluster 3 included isolates
recovered globally. There were nine isolates with high
levels of inferred admixture that did not belong to any
single cluster. It is tempting to speculate that human
activities may have facilitated the global distribution of
cluster 3 and the admixture between populations.
Clustering of isolates from the same sampling area
suggests a link between genetic similarity and geographic origin in a population of organisms previously
believed to lack endemism. Additional isolates from
both clinical and environmental sources obtained from
diverse geographical regions will need to be rigorously
examined to verify the endemism suggested by our
study. An expanded population structure analysis
including isolates with more complete epidemiological
data could lend predictive power about antifungal susceptibility to future studies. In contrast to the above
finding, the relationship between population structure
and AMB susceptibility was small. This could be

Page 6 of 7

attributable to the sample size being too small or to the
lack of an association between in vitro antifungal susceptibilities and geographical origin.

Conclusions
Multiple studies have demonstrated that A. terreus is
the predominant etiological agent of IA in certain medical centers around the world including those in Houston, Texas, and Innsbruck, Austria [5,9,18]. Molecular
examination of isolates from these centers showed no
endemism and the authors concluded that other factors
including levels of immunosuppression and previous
antifungal use in the host, could, in part, be responsible
for the prevalence of A. terreus in these medical centers.
We have demonstrated in this study, using a discriminatory molecular method, a different set of globally
derived isolates and rigorous phylogenetic analysis of
the resulting data, that A. terreus may exhibit endemism. It remains to be seen if isolates recovered from
other parts of the world, importantly from centers in
Texas and Austria, cluster according to geographical
location. Such molecular characterization of medically
important fungi could be pivotal in understanding the
ecology, acquisition and transmission of these
organisms.
