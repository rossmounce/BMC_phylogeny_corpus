Abstract
Background: In Arabidopsis, ETO1 (ETHYLENE-OVERPRODUCER1) is a negative regulator of ethylene
evolution by interacting with AtACS5, an isoform of the rate-limiting enzyme, 1-aminocyclopropane-1carboxylate synthases (ACC synthase or ACS), in ethylene biosynthetic pathway. ETO1 directly inhibits
the enzymatic activity of AtACS5. In addition, a specific interaction between ETO1 and AtCUL3, a
constituent of a new type of E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, suggests the molecular mechanism in promoting
AtACS5 degradation by the proteasome-dependent pathway. Because orthologous sequences to ETO1
are found in many plant species including tomato, we transformed tomato with Arabidopsis ETO1 to
evaluate its ability to suppress ethylene production in tomato fruits.
Results: Transgenic tomato lines that overexpress Arabidopsis ETO1 (ETO1-OE) did not show a significant
delay of fruit ripening. So, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays to investigate potential heterologous
interaction between ETO1 and three isozymes of ACC synthases from tomato. In the yeast two-hybrid
system, ETO1 interacts with LE-ACS3 as well as AtACS5 but not with LE-ACS2 or LE-ACS4, two major
isozymes whose gene expression is induced markedly in ripening fruits. According to the classification of
ACC synthases, which is based on the C-terminal amino acid sequences, both LE-ACS3 and AtACS5 are
categorized as type 2 isozymes and possess a consensus C-terminal sequence. In contrast, LE-ACS2 and
LE-ACS4 are type 1 and type 3 isozymes, respectively, both of which do not possess this specific Cterminal sequence. Yeast two-hybrid analysis using chimeric constructs between LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS3
revealed that the type-2-ACS-specific C-terminal tail is required for interaction with ETO1. When treated
with auxin to induce LE-ACS3, seedlings of ETO1-OE produced less ethylene than the wild type, despite
comparable expression of the LE-ACS3 gene in the wild type.
Conclusion: These results suggest that ETO1 family proteins specifically interact with and negatively
regulate type 2 ACC synthases. Our data also show that Arabidopsis ETO1 can regulate type 2 ACS in a
heterologous plant, tomato.

Background
Ethylene is a simple gas that acts as a plant hormone; it
controls various processes in the plant life cycle, including
seed germination, root hair development, root nodulation, flower senescence, abscission, and fruit ripening [1].
Ethylene also is synthesized in response to stresses such as
pathogen attack, wounding, hypoxia, ozone, chilling, and
freezing [2]. These responses are controlled through integration of the pathways for ethylene biosynthesis, perception, and signal transduction. The ethylene biosynthesis
and signalling pathways have been well characterized
with regard to physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. Studies of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed
a universally conserved set of components in the ethylene
signaling pathway for all plants. Ethylene is perceived by
ethylene receptor family ETR1, ETR2, EIN4, ERS1, ERS2
[3-6] and their assembly requires the RAN1 copper transporter [7]. The signal is further transduced by the signaling
pathway components CTR1, a Raf-like MAPKKK [8,9],
EIN2, an Nramp-related integral membrane protein [10],
and a cascade of transcriptional regulators EIN3/EILs [11],
ERF1 [12], EDF1-4 [13]. The proteolysis of EIN3/EIL proteins by ethylene-regulated EBF1/2 F-box proteins plays a
key role in regulation of all known responses to the hormone [14,15]. A MAPK (including AtMPK6) cascade was
proposed to be involved in ethylene signaling [16], however, a recent study showed that AtMPK6 is not involved
in ethylene signaling but instead involved in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis through AtACS6 [17,18].
Other yet unidentified components are thought to be
involved as well [19,20].
The biosynthetic pathway of ethylene has been studied in
detail, and genes encoding the two key enzymes have
been cloned and characterized [21-25]. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS) converts S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to ACC and then, ACC oxidase
(ACO) produces ethylene through oxidization of ACC.
Generally, the reaction catalyzed by ACS is a rate-limiting
step [26].
Both ACS and ACO are encoded by gene families in many
plant species. In the case of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), there are at least 10 ACS [27] and four ACO
genes [28]. The members of ACS and ACO gene families
are differentially expressed in development or in response
to stimuli such as germination, leaf senescence and flower
abscission, fruit ripening, wounding, flooding, exposure
to ozone, touch, hormone treatment, and pathogen attack
[28-33]. Recent findings suggest that posttranscriptional
regulation is an important aspect of the control of ACS
expression [22,34-38]. Pharmacological and molecular
biological studies have suggested that phosphorylation is
involved in the regulation of ACS activity [34,39]. A
tomato ACS, LE-ACS2, is phosphorylated in the C-termi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/14

nal region and this modification appears to be involved in
the posttranslational regulation of the enzyme [40]. However, the molecular mechanisms by which plants regulate
ethylene biosynthesis at the posttranscriptional or posttranslational levels remain unclear.
Recent studies of the Arabidopsis ethylene-overproducer
mutants (eto1,eto2-1,eto3) [36-38,41] revealed mechanisms underlying the posttranslational regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. The eto mutants constitutively display
the ethylene-evoked triple response phenotypes in the
absence of exogenously applied hormone; they can be distinguished from ctr1 mutants, which also displays the triple response in the absence of ethylene, because the
phenotypes of eto mutants are suppressed by inhibitors of
ethylene biosynthesis and action [8,42]. Therefore, the eto
mutants are likely impaired in either the regulators or the
structural enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis. eto1 is a
recessive mutation that results in an approximately 10fold ethylene overproduction in etiolated seedlings compared to wild-type plants [42], whereas eto2-1 and eto3 are
dominant mutations that cause 20- and 100-fold
increases of ethylene biosynthesis, respectively, in etiolated seedlings [8]. The eto2-1 and eto3 were identified as
mutations within the closely related AtACS5 and AtACS9
genes, respectively. These mutations cause alterations of
the C-terminal amino acid sequences of each protein
[36,38]. Furthermore, both eto1 and eto2-1 mutations
increase the stability of the AtACS5 protein [38], suggesting that the C-termini of some ACC synthases are involved
in posttranslational regulation/processing or stability of
the ACS proteins mediated by ETO1. Also another study
showed that AtMPK6 phosphorylates the C-terminus of
AtACS6 to stabilize the isozyme by a yet unknown mechanism [17].
The molecular mechanism(s) regulating the activity and
stability of AtACS5 was revealed by identification of the
ETO1 protein [41]. ETO1 is a member of a novel plantspecific protein family with three distinct protein-protein
interaction motifs, namely the BTB domain in its N-terminus and the TPR motifs together with a coiled-coil motif
in its C-terminus. The C-terminal TPR domain interacts
with AtACS5 and the N-terminal BTB domain interacts
with AtCUL3, a constituent of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes in which ETO1 is proposed to serve as a substratespecific adaptor protein. ETO1 inhibits the enzyme activity of AtACS5 and targets this protein for degradation in a
proteasome-dependent manner. Other studies also suggest that proteolysis is involved in regulation of ethylene
biosynthesis [43,44].
ETO1 has two paralogs in Arabidopsis, EOL1 and EOL2
(ETO1-LIKE), both of which also interact with and inhibit
the activity of AtACS5. Although ETO1-related sequences

are found in many other plant species including tomato,
no studies have examined whether members of the ETO1
protein family can interact with and regulate ACC synthases other than AtACS5. In this study, using a heterologous system in tomato, we demonstrate that ETO1
specifically interacts with a subfamily of ACC synthases,
namely type 2 ACC synthases including AtACS5, AtACS9
and LE-ACS3, but not with other types of ACC synthases
including AtACS6, LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4. We also show
that constitutive expression of ETO1 results in posttranscriptional suppression of a type 2 ACC synthase, LEACS3, in transgenic tomato. These results suggest that
members of the ETO1 protein family are components in
the negative regulation of type 2 ACC synthases in the
plant kingdom.

ETO1 specifically interacts with LE-ACS3, but not with LEACS2 or LE-ACS4, in yeast cells
To investigate the potential interaction between the Arabidopsis ETO1 and ACC synthases of tomato, we performed
yeast two-hybrid assays between ETO1 and three ACS isozymes of tomato, LE-ACS2, LE-ACS3, and LE-ACS4. As
described above, LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 are major ACS
isozymes involved in ripening tomato fruits. LE-ACS3 is
induced by auxin and flooding [46,47]. In the yeast twohybrid assay, whereas LE-ACS3 showed a strong interaction with ETO1, at a level comparable to that of AtACS5,
neither LE-ACS2 nor LE-ACS4 interacted with ETO1 (Fig.
2). These results suggest that ETO1 may have a preference
for a type of ACS isozymes that include LE-ACS3 and
AtACS5.

Results

To investigate this possibility, we focused on the C-termini of various ACC synthases from Arabidopsis and
tomato as potential targets of ETO1. C-terminal amino
acid sequences of ACC synthases are the least-conserved
portion of these proteins [26,48]. However, there is one
small conserved motif, RLSF (arginine [R] – leucine [L] –
serine [S] – phenylalanine [F]), in the C-termini of several
ACC synthases [27,38,40]. A classification of ACC synthases based on the similarity of DNA sequences was
reported by Oetiker et al. [35], and phylogenetic classifications based on the similarity of amino acid sequences of
Arabidopsis ACC synthases were also devised [17,49].
Apart from these classifications, based on the C-terminal
consensus motif mentioned above, we further classified
the ACS isozymes of tomato and Arabidopsis into three
types as shown in Fig. 3: (1) isozymes with long tails (23–
27 amino acids) after the RLSF consensus sequence (like
LE-ACS2); (2) isozymes that possess the 'WVF (tryptophan [W] – valine [V] – phenylalanine [F])' consensus
sequence just before the RLSF, have short tails (5–8 amino
acids) rich in arginine [R] and acidic amino acids (aspartic
acid [D] or glutamic acid [E]) after the RLSF, and end with
the 'ER (glutamic acid [E] – arginine [R])' consensus (like
AtACS5 and LE-ACS3); and (3) isozymes lacking the RLSF
consensus sequence (like AtACS7 and LE-ACS4). AtACS3,
AtACS10, and AtACS12 are not included in this alignment
because AtACS3 is a pseudogene, and AtACS10 and 12 are
not ACC synthases but aminotransferases [27]. Hereafter,
we use the word "type" instead of "class" to avoid confusion between former sequence-based classifications and
our functional classification based on C-terminal motifs
and the capacity to bind ETO1/EOL proteins.

Fruit ripening is not altered in transgenic tomato plants
that overexpress ETO1
Orthologous sequences to ETO1 are found in many plant
species including tomato [HY and JRE, unpublished data].
These orthologs share high similarity with ETO1 in their
TPR domains that are thought to be involved in specific
interaction with ACC synthases [41]. Actually, two ETO1
paralogs of Arabidopsis, EOL1 and EOL2, interact with
AtACS5 in yeast cells and suppress its activity in
Escherichia coli. In tomato, ethylene is a critical regulator of
fruit ripening [45], and LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS4 have been
shown to be involved in this process [46]. So, there is a
possibility that any of the ETO1 ortholog(s) in tomato
interact with and regulate these ACS isozymes. Because we
expected heterologous interaction between Arabidopsis
ETO1 and LE-ACS2 or LE-ACS4, leading to suppression of
ethylene biosynthesis in tomato fruits and retardation of
its development, we introduced the Arabidopsis ETO1
cDNA controlled by the CaMV 35S promoter into tomato
(L. esculentum cv. Shu-gyoku) via Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation. Transformants were selected on kanamycin-containing medium and verified using the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) (see methods). Expression of the
ETO1 transgene in the T1 segregating individuals was
detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. All of
the T1 lines harbouring the transgene showed expression
of the exogenous ETO1 gene (Fig. 1A). Twenty-two T1
individual ETO1-overexpressing (ETO1-OE) lines were
derived from four independent T0 lines (Fig. 1A). However, all of the fruits of ETO1-OE lines developed a full red
color over the same time course as wild-type plants (Fig.
1B). These results suggest that ETO1 may not suppress the
two major ACS isozymes in ripening tomato fruit, LEACS2 and LE-ACS4, because there is no noteworthy interaction of ETO1 with either LE-ACS2 or LE-ACS4.

Although the lengths of the C-terminal tails of AtACS11,
LE-ACS4, and LE-ACS5 are comparable to those of type 2
isozymes, they lack the RLSF motif and the R/D/E-rich
region. Therefore, we classified these three isozymes as
type 3 isozymes along with AtACS7, which has a much
shorter C-terminal tail. Both AtACS5 and LE-ACS3, which

Arabidopsis
Arabidopsis ETO1 interacts with LE-ACS3 but not with LE-ACS2 or LE-ACS4 in yeast. Interaction between Arabidopsis ETO1 (in pAS2) and ACC synthases (in pACT2) from tomato (LE-ACS2, LE-ACS3, and LE-ACS4) were analyzed in the
yeast two-hybrid system. AtACS5 from Arabidopsis was used as a positive control representing a strong interaction partner
with ETO1. pACT2 vector was used as a negative control. Three independent original transformants were analyzed for each
combination. Means ± SE (n = 3) are indicated.

interact strongly with ETO1, belong to type 2, whereas LEACS2 belongs to type 1 and LE-ACS4 to type 3. Because we
previously showed that the C-terminus of AtACS5 is a target of ETO1, this raises the possibility that the C-termini
of type 2 ACC synthases contain some specific features
necessary for the interaction with ETO1 that may also be
conserved in other plants.
ETO1 does not interact with a series of C-terminal deletion
mutants of LE-ACS2 in yeast
As described above, one notable feature of type 2 ACC
synthases is the length of the C-terminal tail after the RLSF
motif. Type 1 ACC synthases possess longer C-terminal
tails after the RLSF than type 2, whereas type 3 isozymes
lack the RLSF. Furthermore, the C-terminus of ACS
appears to be proteolyzed in vivo [50]. Although another

study showed that C-terminal truncation of a type 1
enzyme, LE-ACS2, does not occur in vivo [40], other type
1 ACC synthases may have their C-termini truncated to an
"optimal length" (i.e., length comparable to type 2) and
may then become capable of interacting with ETO1 family
proteins. Therefore, we examined the effect of altering the
length of ACS protein C-terminal tails on their interaction
with ETO1.
Two C-terminally truncated mutants of LE-ACS2 were
constructed and the cDNA was cloned into pACT2 (see
methods). LE-ACS2∆16 contains a deletion of 16 amino
acids from the C-terminal end; and as a result its C-terminus has a length comparable to native type 2 ACS proteins
(Fig. 4). The other mutant, LE-ACS2∆28, was trimmed to
one amino acid upstream of the RLSF (Fig. 4). If a specific

Classification based on C-termini of ACC synthases of tomato and Arabidopsis
Classification based on C-termini of ACC synthases of tomato and Arabidopsis. ACC synthases can be grouped into
three distinct types based on the similarity of their C-terminal amino acid sequences. The C-terminal amino acid sequences of
ACC synthases were aligned using the CLASTALW program, drawn using MacBoxShade, and grouped into three distinct
types. Eight ACC synthases from Arabidopsis (AtACS1, AtACS2, AtACS4, AtACS5, AtACS6, AtACS7, AtACS8, AtACS9, and
AtACS11; AtACS3 is thought to be a pseudogene, and AtACS10 and AtACS12 are aminotransferases) and nine from tomato
(LE-ACS1A, LE-ACS1B, LE-ACS2, LE-ACS3, LE-ACS4, LE-ACS5, LE-ACS6, LE-ACS7, and LE-ACS8) were aligned. Identical
amino acids and conservative changes are indicated by reversed and shaded characters, respectively. The WVF and RLSF motifs
and mutation sites for eto2-1 and eto3 are indicated.

length of the C-terminal tail after the RLSF is necessary for
the interaction with ETO1, then LE-ACS2∆16 should
interact with ETO1 whereas LE-ACS2∆28 should not.
However, neither of these truncated mutants was able to
interact with ETO1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4).
These results suggest that the length of C-termini of type 1
ACS is not preventing ETO1 binding. Simply truncating
the C-terminal tail of type 1 ACS to the length of type 2
isozymes is not sufficient to allow for interaction with
ETO1 and implies that other factors are necessary for
mediating this interaction.

eto3 mutant, the valine residue in this WVF motif is
mutated to aspartic acid in AtACS9 [38], suggesting an
important role of this small motif (Fig. 3). We replaced
the C-terminal 31 amino acids of LE-ACS2 with amino
acids 456–469 of LE-ACS3 (LE-ACS2∆C31::LE-ACS3456–
469). This chimeric ACS protein was sufficient to recover
the strong interaction with ETO1 to a level comparable to
LE-ACS3 (Fig. 4). These results strongly suggest that the Cterminal tail specific to type 2 ACS, comprising the
WVFRLSF motif and the R/D/E-rich region, is necessary
and sufficient for the interaction with ETO1.

The C-terminal sequence specific to type 2 ACC synthases
is required for the interaction with ETO1
Next we examined the effect of type-2-specific amino acid
sequence around the RLSF on the interaction with ETO1.
As mentioned above, type 2 ACC synthases have a specific
C-terminal consensus sequence (i.e., the WVFRLSF motif
followed by the R/D/E-rich region). The RLSF is conserved
in both type 1 and type 2 ACC synthases, whereas the WVF
motif and R/D/E-rich region are conserved only in type 2
ACC synthases in tomato and Arabidopsis (Fig. 3). In the

Overexpression of ETO1 suppresses auxin-induced
ethylene biosynthesis in tomato seedlings
To investigate the interaction between ETO1 and LE-ACS3
in planta, we examined the induction of ethylene biosynthesis in etiolated tomato seedlings by a synthetic auxin,
2,4-D. Using T2 seedlings of a homozygous line of ETO1OE (14-1-H2; not included in Fig. 1A), we measured ethylene evolution from auxin-treated wild-type and ETO1
transgenic tomato seedlings.

Specific 4
Specific C-terminal amino acid sequence of type 2 ACC synthases is necessary for the interaction with ETO1
in the yeast two-hybrid system. Interaction of ETO1 with C-terminal mutants of LE-ACS2 deleted or swapped with LEACS3 were analyzed by quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay. ETO1 was cloned into pAS2 and ACS mutants were cloned into
pACT2 vectors, respectively. C-terminal amino acid sequences of each mutant are shown on the left. The WVF motif and the
R/D/E-rich region derived from LE-ACS3 are shown in red. The RLSF motif common to both LE-ACS3 and LE-ACS2 is shown
in blue. The pACT2 vector was used as a negative control. Three independent original transformants were analyzed for each
combination. Means ± SE (n = 3) are indicated.

When 6-day-old etiolated wild-type seedlings were treated
with 100 µM 2,4-D for 24 h, they produced 2.1-fold more
ethylene than untreated seedlings (Fig. 5A). LE-ACS3
mRNA was induced by the 2,4-D treatment in the wild
type (Fig. 5B). However, when the ETO1-OE transgenic
plants were treated in this manner, they produced only
1.6-fold more ethylene when compared to untreated
plants, despite LE-ACS3 mRNA being strongly induced to
a level comparable to wild type (Fig. 5A and 5B). These
results, together with those of the yeast two-hybrid assays,
indicate that overexpressed ETO1 protein may suppress
the ACS activity of LE-ACS3 by a direction, which results
in a reduction in ethylene biosynthesis, same as the case
of AtACS5 and cytokinin treatment in Arabidopsis [41].

Discussion
ETO1 interacts with and inhibits type 2 ACC synthases
In a previous study, we demonstrated that ETO1, a novel
plant-specific BTB/TPR protein, negatively regulates an
ethylene biosynthetic enzyme of Arabidopsis seedlings,
AtACS5, via direct interaction [41]. However, whether the
interaction and the regulatory effect are limited to AtACS5
and its paralogs/orthologs – or are common to the entire

plant ACC synthase family – has not been clarified. In this
study, we showed the interaction between ETO1 and ACS
is restricted to type 2 ACS isozymes. We classified ACC
synthases into three types based on their C-terminal
amino acid sequences. All members of 'class I' ACC synthases of tomato (LE-ACS1A, LE-ACS1B, LE-ACS6) in the
classification of Oetiker et al. [35] correspond to our type
1 ACC synthases, while both of their 'class II' (LE-ACS2
and LE-ACS4) and 'class III' (LE-ACS3 and LE-ACS5) contains members of our type 1 and type 3. This discrepancy
may result from the different methods of the phylogenetic
anlysis (i.e. partial DNA sequences [35] and C-terminal
amino acid sequences [this paper]). On the other hand,
our type 2 isozymes of Arabidopsis are grouped into two
closely related phylogenetic branches in the group B ACC
synthases [49], and the type 3 isozymes belong to the
branches in the group B other than the 'type 2' branches.
Also our type 1 isozymes correspond to the group A isozymes [49]. These coincidences may reflect the functional
relevance of each type of the isozymes, and, indeed, functional heterodimerizations between closely related ACS
isozymes have been demonstrated [49].

Little is known about the endogenous regulators of ethylene biosynthesis in the control of plant development,
response to stress or fruit ripening. Because tomato has at
least one ETO1 ortholog [LeEOL1; HY and JRE,
unpublished], a family of ACS isozymes and many ethylene-related phenotypes, we tested whether ETO1 could
interact with and inhibit members of the ACC synthase
family from tomato. We showed that ETO1 specifically
interacts with two type 2 ACC synthases, AtACS5 and LEACS3, but not with LE-ACS2 (type 1) or LE-ACS4 (type 3)
in the yeast two-hybrid system. Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of the ETO1 transgene posttranscriptionally suppresses the activity of LE-ACS3 in a
heterologous plant. These results suggest that type 2 ACC
synthases represent a group that specifically interact with
and are inhibited by ETO1 family proteins (Fig. 6).
Whether the inhibitory effect of the ETO1 family in planta
is limited to type 2 is still unknown; we have not yet
checked the interaction of ETO1 with LE-ACS2 and LEACS4 in planta. In the yeast two-hybrid system, the interaction of ETO1 was obviously restricted to type 2 isozymes. However, in planta, AtMPK6-dependent
phosphorylation of AtACS6 (a type 1 ACS) can stabilize
this isozyme and increase ethylene biosynthesis [17].
Phosphorylation of such kind of modification of type 1
ACC synthases may confer an ability to interact with
ETO1 [52]. Also, a calcium-dependent phosphorylation
of the serine residue within the RLSF motif of LE-ACS2
[40], or any proteolytic cleavage [27,40] may change the
C-terminal conformation and enable interaction with the
ETO1 family. These possibilities may be elucidated by
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies
that can distinguish phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated forms of type 1 ACS, or pull-down assay using type1-specific C-terminal peptide. In contrast, type 3 ACC synthases does not contain this potential phosphorylation
site, suggesting that they may not be similarly regulated.
The Ctr- phenotype of plants constitutively expressing the
C-terminally truncated version of AtACS5 [41] supports
this hypothesis.
Another question is whether any other members of the
ETO1 family interact with other types of ACC synthases.
In the yeast two-hybrid system, both of the two paralogs
of ETO1, EOL1 and EOL2, showed an interaction with
ACC synthases from tomato similar to that of ETO1 (i.e.,
they interacted only with type 2 ACS but not with type 1
or type 3; data not shown). This suggests that type-2-specific regulation may be common to other members of the
ETO1 family at least in yeast cells. However, a possibility
that any EOL proteins may interact with and inhibit ACC
synthases other than type 2 isozymes modified in planta is
still not excluded.

C-Terminal sequence specific to type 2 ACS is a target of
ETO1
The C-terminal amino acid sequence specific to type 2
ACS (i.e., the WVFRLSF followed by the R/D/E-rich
region), is a target of ETO1. In addition, mutations found
within the RLSF to the R/D/E-rich region of AtACS5 of
eto2-1 and the WVF motif of AtACS9 of the eto3 mutant
[36,38] strongly implicate the importance of this amino
acid sequence. Among molecular lesions of Arabidopsis
eto1 mutations identified so far, eto1-1, which lacks only
the last TPR motif, has a phenotype similar to the other
alleles, and a C-terminal deletion mutant of ETO1
(tETO1) impaired in its last TPR motif failed to interact
with AtACS5 in the yeast two-hybrid assay [41]. These
results indicate that TPR motifs of ETO1 are essential for
interaction with AtACS5.

TPR motifs are involved in various protein-protein interactions. Generally, the interaction between TPR domains
and their target peptide are strictly limited by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions [53]. In this regard,
type-2-specific C-termini of ACC synthases have some features required for the strict interaction with the TPR of
ETO1. The crystal structure of LE-ACS2 has been determined, and the C-terminal tail of LE-ACS2 seems to
protrude from the surface of the ACS monomer and dimer
[54]. In the dimeric form (head-to-tail orientation) of LEACS2, N-terminal residues 11–19 make contact with the
C-terminal helix H14 just before the C-terminal tail. The
significance of the interaction between the N- and the Ctermini is not clear but may be important for conformation stabilization and catalysis, as suggested by
biochemical studies [50]. The WVF motif is likely located
outside this N- and C-terminal interaction region and may
be important for formation of the interacting surface with
ETO1. Crystal structure analysis of the ETO1-ACS complex would reveal the significance of the WVF motif. Also,
an isozyme of type 2 ACS, LE-ACS8, does not possess the
precise WVF sequence. Instead, it contains WGF, which is
very closely related to WVF (Fig. 3). In contrast to the eto3
version of AtACS9, in which the valine residue of the WVF
motif was altered to the charged aspartic acid residue, the
glycine residue in the C-terminus of LE-ACS8 is a neutral
amino acid. Therefore, it is likely that LE-ACS8 may also
interact with ETO1 as do other type 2 isozymes.
Posttranslational regulation of ethylene biosynthesis
We have identified many orthologous sequences of ETO1
from other plant species including tomato, suggesting that
the ETO1-based regulatory system is common among the
plant kingdom. In the present study, we showed that Arabidopsis ETO1 interacts with and posttranscriptionally regulates LE-ACS3, a type 2 ACS, in a heterologous plant,
tomato. This indicates that the ETO1 protein family is a
common component in the negative regulation of ethyl-

ene biosynthesis in plants. Given that ETO1-homologous
sequences are found in all plants but not in animals or
prokaryotes, this system of regulation of ethylene may
have developed early in plant evolution. ACC synthases
are similar to the subgroup I family of pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferases [55]. Most of
the similarity between these two families is found around
the active sites, while the target of ETO1 lies in the C-terminus of ACS, which is outside the conserved region. It is
an intriguing question as to how early plants acquired this
unique mechanism to regulate ethylene biosynthesis.
Finally, one may ask why only type 2 ACC synthases are
regulated by ETO1. It is imperative for plants to have ethylene synthesized in a timely manner. For instance, a
remarkable phenotype of all eto mutants was observed in
the etiolated seedling stage, suggesting that production of
ethylene is regulated by ETO1 during germination.
Although ethylene evolution is important for germination, seedlings with excessive level of ethylene for an
extended time would continue to exhibit phenotype similar to that of the triple response, which is normally disappeared after germination. Also ethylene is important to
respond to various stresses. To avoid unnecessary overproduction of ethylene in physiological and developmental
processes, a tightly regulated system consisted of the type
2 ACC synthases and ETO1 protein family together with
yet unknown system (for instance, AtMPK6-AtACS6 system) must have been evolved in plants to timely control
ethylene biosynthesis until this important growth regulator and stress phytohormone is needed.

Conclusion
In this study, we elucidated the substrate specificity of
ETO1 protein. We showed the interaction between ETO1
and ACS protein family is restricted to type 2 ACS isozymes which possess specific C-terminal amino acid
sequences. Our data that ETO1 suppress auxin-induced
ethylene evolution through induction of LE-ACS3 also
show that Arabidopsis ETO1 can regulate type 2 ACS in a
heterologous plant.

Methods
Plant material
Plants of wild type and transformed tomato (L. esculentum
cv. Shu-gyoku) were grown in greenhouses under standard conditions. For transformation, seedlings were grown
on medium supplemented with 1/2 × Murashige and
Skoog (MS) minimal salts.
Transformation of tomato
Tomato hypocotyls or cotyledons precultured on MS
medium containing 1 mg/l NAA, 0.5 mg/l BA, and 3%
sucrose were transformed by an Agrobacterium-mediated
procedure [56]. Full-length ETO1 cDNA was introduced

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/5/14

in the sense orientation between the CaMV 35S promoter
and Nos terminator of the pROK2 vector harbouring
NPT2 gene as a selectable marker [41]. Transformed
plants were confirmed by PCR amplification using specific primers for the 35S promoter and the ETO1 cDNA.
Nucleic acid analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated using Isoplant II (Nippon
Gene). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen). Transcription levels of ETO1 were analyzed
by reverse RT-PCR analysis of total RNA. RNA (1 µg) was
used in each RT-PCR following the manufacturer's protocol (Titan One Tube RT-PCR System, Roche Diagnostics).
Gene-specific primers for ETO1 were used, and GAPDH
was used as an internal control. Both of the primer sets
were added to the same tube. PCR amplification was performed for a first round of 10 cycles as follows:
denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 55°C for 30
sec, and extension at 68°C for 45 sec. Then the second
round of cycles was performed as follows: denaturation at
94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 55°C for 30 sec, and extension at 68°C for 45 sec + 5/cycle sec. The final extension
was carried out at 68°C for 7 min, and the reaction was
then stopped at 4°C. For Northern blot analysis, total
RNA (10 µg) was used for each lanes and blotted onto
positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Diagnostics). DIG-labeled RNA probe for LE-ACS3 was synthesized following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche
Diagnostics) and detected by CDP-Star (Roche
Diagnostics).
Yeast two-hybrid assay
Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed as described previously [41]. ETO1 cDNA was cloned into the pAS2 vector. cDNAs for LE-ACS2, LE-ACS3, and LE-ACS4 were
synthesized by RT-PCR using SuperScriptII (Invitrogen)
reverse transcriptase and PfuTurbo DNA polymerase
(Stratagene) and cloned into pACT2. Deletion or chimeric
mutants of LE-ACS2 and LE-ACS3 were constructed by
PCR using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. A quantitative liquid assay for β-galactosidase activity was performed
according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Each experiment was repeated at least three
times using independent clones.
Measurement of ethylene biosynthesis
Etiolated seedlings (1 per vial) of T2 homozygous lines 141-H2 (ETO1/ETO1) and 14-1-H4 (wt/wt) were grown in
vials (10-mm diameter, 75-mm length with a rubber septum) containing 1 g of sea sand (20–35 mesh, Wako
Chemicals) and 0.5 ml of water at 28°C in the dark. After
6 d, 2,4-D (in 1% ethanol) was added to the final concentration of 100 µM and seedlings were incubated under the
same conditions. On the next day, the accumulated ethylene was measured using a gas chromatograph (Model GC-

(60/80 mesh, 3 mm × 1.5 m) and FID. A 0.5-ml volume
of each sample from the headspace was injected onto the
column. Eight individuals were used for each treatment.
Ethylene production was calculated as pL· seedling-1· hr1.
