Structural diversity and evolution of the
N-terminal isoform-specific region of ecdysone
receptor-A and -B1 isoforms in insects
Takayuki Watanabe*, Hideaki Takeuchi, Takeo Kubo*

Abstract
Background: The ecdysone receptor (EcR) regulates various cellular responses to ecdysteroids during insect
development. Insects have multiple EcR isoforms with different N-terminal A/B domains that contain the isoformspecific activation function (AF)-1 region. Although distinct physiologic functions of the EcR isoforms have been
characterized in higher holometabolous insects, they remain unclear in basal direct-developing insects, in which
only A isoform has been identified. To examine the structural basis of the EcR isoform-specific AF-1 regions, we
performed a comprehensive structural comparison of the isoform-specific region of the EcR-A and -B1 isoforms in
insects.
Results: The EcR isoforms were newly identified in 51 species of insects and non-insect arthropods, including
direct-developing ametabolous and hemimetabolous insects. The comprehensive structural comparison revealed
that the isoform-specific region of each EcR isoform contained evolutionally conserved microdomain structures and
insect subgroup-specific structural modifications. The A isoform-specific region generally contained four conserved
microdomains, including the SUMOylation motif and the nuclear localization signal, whereas the B1 isoform-specific
region contained three conserved microdomains, including an acidic activator domain-like motif. In addition, the
EcR-B1 isoform of holometabolous insects had a novel microdomain at the N-terminal end.
Conclusions: Given that the nuclear receptor AF-1 is involved in cofactor recruitment and transcriptional
regulation, the microdomain structures identified in the isoform-specific A/B domains might function as signature
motifs and/or as targets for cofactor proteins that play essential roles in the EcR isoform-specific AF-1 regions.
Moreover, the novel microdomain in the isoform-specific region of the holometabolous insect EcR-B1 isoform
suggests that the holometabolous insect EcR-B1 acquired additional transcriptional regulation mechanisms.

Backgrounds
Morphogenetic events during insect development are triggered by ecdysteroids. The major insect ecdysteroid, 20hydroxyecdysone (20E), binds directly to a heterodimeric
transcription factor comprising two nuclear receptors, the
ecdysone receptor (EcR) and the ultraspiracle, to activate a
complex transcriptional cascade [1]. In the holometabolous insects, there are two or three EcR isoforms (A and
B1 isoforms; Drosophila has an additional B2 isoform) that
are produced from a single genetic locus by differential
promoter usage and alternative splicing [2]. The EcR isoforms have a common C-terminal region that includes the

DNA binding domain and the ligand binding domain (the
C-F domains), but also have isoform-specific regions in
the N-terminal A/B domain. In the holometabolous
insects, each EcR isoform govern distinct steroid-stimulated responses during metamorphosis. In Drosophila, the
EcR-A isoform is predominantly expressed in the proliferative tissues during metamorphosis, and is required for
adult-specific developmental processes. In contrast, the
EcR-B isoforms (B1 and B2 isoforms) are expressed in the
larva-specific tissues, and are involved in 20E-triggered larval tissue remodeling during metamorphosis [2-7]. In the
red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, the EcR-A isoform
has a dominant role in transduction of the ecdysteroid
action by regulating the expression of 20E-response genes
[8]. Only the A isoform has been identified in basal direct-

developing (ametabolous and hemimetabolous) insects
[9,10], therefore, it is not known whether direct-developing insects have multiple EcR isoforms with distinct physiologic functions.
In addition to the differential expression patterns and
the distinct physiologic functions during development,
EcR isoforms have differential transcriptional regulation
mechanisms. The A/B domain of the nuclear receptors
generally contains the ligand-independent activation
function (AF)-1 region [11]. Several studies of the AF-1
function of Drosophila EcR isoforms have revealed that
the A/B domain of Drosophila EcR-B isoforms have
strong transactivation activity, whereas that of the A isoform has weaker transactivation activity [12]. The AF-1
of Drosophila EcR-B1 mainly locates in the N-terminal
region (amino acid residues 1-53), whose sequence is
considerably conserved among higher holometabolous
insects such as flies, mosquitoes, and moths [13].
Although structural differences in the AF-1 region
among the EcR isoforms result in differential transcriptional regulation, the structural basis and molecular
mechanisms underlying the isoform-specific AF-1 functions remain obscure.
In the present study, to examine the detailed structural characteristics of the isoform-specific region of
each EcR isoform, we performed a comprehensive structural comparison of the isoform-specific regions of the
insect EcR-A and -B1 isoforms. First, we newly identified EcR isoforms in 51 insect and non-insect arthropod
species, focusing mainly on the basal direct-developing
insects. Then, we compared the deduced amino acid
sequences of the isoform-specific region of the EcR-A
and -B1 isoforms (45 and 76 species, respectively).
Sequence comparison revealed that the isoform-specific
region of each EcR isoform contains several conserved
microdomain structures, some of which were evolutionally acquired or modified. Interestingly, the isoform-specific region of the holometabolous insect EcR-B1
isoform contained a highly conserved (K/R)RRW motif
at the N-terminus, which was lacking in basal directdeveloping insects. Given that the nuclear receptor AF-1
regions provide an interaction interface for co-regulatory
proteins, the conserved microdomain structures in the
EcR isoform-specific AF-1 regions might play essential
roles in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, the holometabolous insect EcR-B1 might have novel transcriptional regulation mechanisms that are mediated by the
newly acquired (K/R)RRW motif.

the EcR-A and -B1 isoforms

The EcR gene encodes two or three isoforms in the
holometabolous insects (A, B1 and B2 isoforms), but

only A isoform was previously identified in the directdeveloping insects. In the present study, to perform a
comprehensive sequence comparison of the isoform-specific region of the EcR-A and -B1 isoforms among
insects and non-insect arthropods, we obtained cDNA
fragments encoding the A/B domains of the EcR-A and
-B1 isoforms from 18 and 51 arthropod species, respectively, by using reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (see Additional file 1, Table S1 and Additional
file 2, Table S2). We newly identified the EcR-A isoform
in the direct-developing insects, including Paleoptera (1
species), Polyneoptera (2 species), and Paraneoptera (8
species). For a detailed analysis, we also identified the
EcR-A isoform in 5 holometabolous insect species and
one non-insect arthropod species. Although the EcR-B1
isoform was identified in many holometabolous insects
and several non-insect arthropods, it has not been identified in basal hemimetabolous and ametabolous insects.
Therefore, we newly identified the EcR-B1 isoform in
basal insects, including Apterygota (2 species), Paleoptera (2 species), Polyneoptera (8 species), and Paraneoptera (12 species). In addition, we identified the EcR-B1
isoform in 25 holometabolous insect species and two
non-insect arthropod species. To our knowledge, this is
the first report of the identification of the EcR-B1 isoform in the direct-developing insects. In the directdeveloping insects, the EcR isoforms were cloned from
the whole body of the nymph and adult, and isolated
tissues, including the nymphal wing pad, fat body, testis,
and ovaries (data not shown), suggesting that the EcR
isoforms are broadly distributed in the direct-developing
insects.
The A isoform-specific region was classified into five
structural types

We compared the deduced amino acid sequences of the
isoform-specific region in the A/B domain of the EcR-A
isoform identified from 45 arthropod species (5 noninsect arthropod species [Crustacea and Chelicerata], 15
direct-developing insect species [1 paleopteran species, 4
polyneopteran species, and 9 paraneopteran species] and
26 Endopterygota species). GenBank accession numbers
of the EcR-A isoforms were listed in Additional file 1,
Table S1.
General structural features of the A isoform-specific region

The C-terminal region of the A isoform-specific region
contained a conserved Ser/Thr-rich region, which was
formally referred to as the “A-box” [10,14]. In the Nterminal region of the A isoform-specific region, we
found two conserved microdomains: the SUMOylation
motif and the nuclear localization signal (NLS). In addition, we found conserved (D/E)(D/E)W residues
between the NLS and the C-terminal A-box. The
SUMOylation motif in the A isoform-specific region

contained a canonical consensus sequence for the
SUMOylation (ΨKxE, where Ψ represents a large hydrophobic amino acid) [15]. The NLS of the A isoform-specific region contained a consensus sequence of the
monopartite NLS [K(K/R)x(K/R)] [16].
Comprehensive structural comparison revealed several
subgroup-specific structural modifications. Based on the
structural similarity, we classified the isoform-specific
region of the EcR-A isoform into five structural types.

The EcR-A isoforms identified from several polyneopteran insects (Blattella germanica [Order Dictyoptera],
Locusta migratoria [Order Orthoptera], and Anisolabis
maritima [Order Dermaptera]), and non-neopteran
insects (Ephemera strigata [Order Ephemeroptera]) did
not contain the ΨAYRG sequence at their N-termini.
The EcR-A isoforms identified in Lepidoptera lacked the
NLS.

Type-1 A isoform-specific region (Figure 1)

Type-3 A isoform-specific region (Figure 3)

The type-1 A isoform-specific region contained the
SUMOylation motif, the NLS, the (D/E)(D/E)W residues, and the A-box. The consensus sequence of the Abox of the type-1 A isoform-specific region was
NGxSPSxxSSYDxxYSP. The EcR-A isoform with the
type-1 A isoform-specific region was identified in noninsect arthropods.

The type-3 A isoform-specific region contained the (D/
E)(D/E)W residues and the A-box. The type-3 A
isoform-specific region lacked the N-terminal region
containing the SUMOylation motif and the NLS. The
consensus sequence of the A-box of the type-3 A isoform-specific region was NGxPSPTMSSMSYDPYSP.
The EcR-A isoform with the type-3 A isoform-specific
region was identified in Heteroptera (Order
Hemiptera).

Type-2 A isoform-specific region (Figure 2)

The type-2 A isoform-specific region contained the
SUMOylation motif, the NLS, the (D/E)(D/E)W residues, and the A-box. In addition, the type-2 A isoformspecific region generally contained two conserved Nterminal sequences (DLKHE and ΨAYRG, where Ψ
represents a large hydrophobic amino acid). The consensus sequence of the A-box of the type-2 A isoformspecific region was NGYSSP(M/L)SSGSYDPYSP. The
EcR-A isoform with the type-2 A isoform-specific region
was identified in the direct-developing insects except for
Heteroptera (Order Hemiptera) and three holometabolous orders (Coleoptera, Trichoptera, and Lepidoptera).
The EcR-A isoforms identified from two psicopteran
insects (Pediculus humanus corporis and Liposcelis sp.)

Type-4 A isoform-specific region (Figure 4)

The type-4 A isoform-specific region contained the
SUMOylation motif, the NLS, the (D/E)(D/E)W residues, and the A-box. In addition, the type-4 A isoformspecific region contained D(T/S)S repeats in the N-terminus. The consensus sequence of the A-box of the
type-4 A isoform-specific region was NGYASPMS(T/S)
GSYDPYSP. The EcR-A isoform with the type-4 A isoform-specific region was identified in Hymenoptera and
Mecoptera. The NLS of the EcR-A isoforms identified
from several hymenopteran insects (Apis mellifera, Pheidole megacephala, and Camponotus japonicus) was
modified (consensus; KxxR).

General structural features of the B1 isoform-specific region
Corythucha marmorata
Physopelta gutta
Pachygrontha antennata

The N-terminal region of the B1 isoform-specific region
essentially contained three microdomains: the S-rich
motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif. The Srich motif was composed of acidic residues (D and E)
and neutral polar residues (S and T), and contained a
conserved core EV(T/S)SS sequence. The DL-rich motif
was composed of repeats of acidic residues and aromatic/bulky hydrophobic residues (W, A, F, I, L, M, and
V). The region between the S-rich and the DL-rich
motifs generally contains conserved SP residues. In addition to these microdomains, the isoform-specific region
of the holometabolous insect EcR-B1 isoform contained
an additional conserved (K/R)RRW motif at the Nterminus.
Comprehensive structural comparison revealed several
subgroup-specific structural modifications. Based on the
structural similarity, we classified the isoform-specific
region of the EcR-B1 isoform into seven structural
types.

Figure 5 Type-5 A isoform-specific region. The type-5 A isoform-specific region contained four conserved microdomains and conserved Nterminal YRLN residues. (A) Schematic representation of the type-5 A isoform-specific regions. Positions of the YRLN residues, the SUMOylation
motif, the NLS, the (D/E)(D/E) residues, and the A-box are indicated by colored boxes. (B) The alignment and Sequence Logo representation of
the N-terminal region and the conserved microdomains of the type-5 A isoform-specific region. The amino acid residues are represented in the
default color scheme of ClustalX. Asterisks indicate identical residues and colons indicate similar residues.

Type-1 B1 isoform-specific region (Figure 6)

The type-1 B1 isoform-specific region contained three
conserved microdomains (the S-rich motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif). The consensus sequences
of the S-rich motif and the DL-rich motif of the type-1
B1 isoform-specific region were GDExSxEVSSSS and
DIGEVDLDFWDLDL, respectively. The N-terminal
region and the region between each two conserved
microdomains varied in length and sequence. The EcRB1 isoform with the type-1 B1 isoform-specific region
was identified in non-insect arthropods and non-neopteran insects.
Moreover, the EcR isoforms identified from the filarial
nematode Brugia malayi [EcR-A and -C isoforms (GenBank accession numbers; ABQ28713 and ABQ28714)]
contained the S-rich motif-like sequence and the DLrich motif in the N-terminal A/B domain (amino acid
residues 1-153, both isoforms contained the common
A/B domain; Figure 6C).
Type-2 B1 isoform-specific region (Figure 7)

The type-2 B1 isoform-specific region contained three
conserved microdomains (the S-rich motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif). In addition, the type-2
B1 isoform-specific region generally contained a

partially conserved TxxΨW sequence at the N-terminus. The consensus sequences of the S-rich motif and
the DL-rich motif of the type-2 B1 isoform-specific
region were GxESSPEVTSSS and DIGEVDLEFWDLDL,
respectively. The EcR-B1 isoform with the type-2 B1
isoform-specific region was identified in Polyneoptera
and Paraneoptera except for Heteroptera (Order
Hemiptera).
Type-2’ B1 isoform-specific region (Figure 8)

The type-2’ B1 isoform-specific region structurally
resembled to the type-2 B1 isoform-specific region, but
the motif structures were modified. The consensus
sequences of the S-rich motif and the DL-rich motif of
the type-2’ B1 isoform-specific region were
EDxxxQVSSS and EVDLELWDLGL, respectively. Moreover, the region between the S-rich motif and the DLrich motif were shortened. In some cases, these two
motifs were completely fused (e.g. EcR-B1 isoforms of
Physopelta gutta and Pachygrontha antennata). Like the
type-2 B1 isoform-specific region, the type-2’ B1 isoform-specific region contained the N-terminal TxxΨW
sequence. The EcR-B1 isoform with the type-2’ B1 isoform-specific region was identified in Heteroptera
(Order Hemiptera).

and the N-terminal TxxΨW sequence. (A) Schematic representation
of the type-2’ B1 isoform-specific regions. Positions of the TxxΨW
sequence, the S-rich motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif
are indicated by colored boxes. (B) The alignment and Sequence
Logo representation of the N-terminal region of the type-2’ B1
isoform-specific region. The amino acid residues are represented in
the default color scheme of ClustalX. Asterisks indicate identical
residues and colons indicate similar residues.

Type-3 B1 isoform-specific region (Figure 9)

The type-3 B1 isoform-specific region contained four
conserved microdomains [the (K/R)RRW motif, the Srich motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif]. The
consensus sequences of the S-rich motif and the DLrich motif of the type-3 B1 isoform-specific region were
EESSSEVTSSS and DIGDVDLEFWDLDL, respectively.
The EcR-B1 isoform with the type-3 B1 isoform-specific
region was identified in Coleoptera, Strepsiptera, Neuroptera, Megaroptera, and Raphidioptera.
Type-4 B1 isoform-specific region (Figure 10)

The type-4 B1 isoform-specific region contained four
conserved microdomains [the (K/R)RRW motif, the Srich motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif]. In
addition, the type-4 B1 isoform-specific region contained
a conserved LQTVPRVPVAGV sequence just N-terminally adjacent to the (K/R)RRW motif. The consensus
sequences of the S-rich motif and the DL-rich motif of
the type-4 B1 isoform-specific region were ESSPEVSSS
and EDLQLWDLDL, respectively. The EcR-B1 isoform
with the type-4 B1 isoform-specific region was identified
in the aculeate Hymenoptera and horntails (Family Siricidae, Order Hymenoptera). The EcR-B1 isoform identified from two vespine wasps (Vespa mandarinia and
Anterhynchium flavomarginatum) contained a S/H-rich
insertion between the (K/R)RRW and the S-rich motifs.
Type-5 B1 isoform-specific region (Figure 11)

The type-5 B1 isoform-specific region structurally
resembled to the type-4 B1 isoform-specific region, but

contained an additional N-terminal extension region.
The consensus sequences of the conserved N-terminal
sequence, the S-rich motif and the DL-rich motif of the
type-5 B1 isoform-specific region were LAVPRVPVAGV, ESSPEVSSS, and EDLQLWDLDL, respectively.
The EcR-B1 isoform with the type-5 B1 isoform-specific
region was identified in sawflies, the basal lineage of
Hymenoptera. Moreover, the isoform-specific region of
the EcR-B1 isoform identified in Panorpa pryeri (Order
Mecoptera) contained an N-terminal extension region
similar to that of the type-5 B1 isoform-specific region.
The P. pryeri EcR-B1 isoform contained the S-rich motif
(amino acid residues 75-83; ESSPEVSSS) and the DLrich
motif
(amino
acid
residues
99-112;
ELGEVDLDFWDLDI), which were structurally similar
to the S-rich motif of the type-4 B1 isoform-specific
region and the DL-rich motif of type-3 B1 isoform-specific region, respectively.
Type-6 B1 isoform-specific region (Figure 12)

The type-6 B1 isoform-specific region contained conserved microdomains [the (K/R)RRW motif, the S-rich
motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif]. The consensus sequence of the S-rich motif of the type-6 B1 isoform-specific region was EESSSEVTSSS. Although the
DL-rich motif of type-6 B1 isoform-specific region was
composed of acidic residues and bulky hydrophobic residues, its sequence was highly modified [consensus; (D/
E)Y(C/G)(E/D)LWxxxxD)]. The EcR-B1 isoform with
the type-6 B1 isoform-specific region was identified in
Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Trichoptera.
Phylogenetic evolution of motif structures in the EcR
isoform-specific regions in insects

Based on the phylogenetic relationship of insect orders,
we constructed evolution models for the structural evolution of the isoform-specific region of the EcR isoforms
in insects (Figure 13). The structural modifications in
the A isoform-specific region accompanied by insect
evolution are represented in Figure 13A. The A isoform-specific region of non-insect arthropods (type-1 A
isoform-specific region) was composed of four conserved microdomains [the SUMOylation motif, the NLS,
the (D/E)(D/E)W residues, and the A-box]. The EcR-A
isoform of direct developing insects acquired two Nterminal sequences (DLKHE and ΨAYRG) (type-2 A
isoform-specific region), which were conserved among
most direct-developing insect groups except for Heteroptera, whose EcR-A isoform lacked the N-terminal half
of the isoform-specific region including the SUMOylation motif and the NLS (type-3 A isoform-specific
region). The two N-terminal sequences and four conserved microdomains were also conserved among most
holometabolous insect groups except for Hymenoptera,
Mecoptera and Diptera. The isoform-specific region of

Figure 11 Type-5 B1 isoform-specific region. The type-5 B1 isoform-specific region contained four conserved microdomains, the N-terminal
LAVPRVPVAGV sequence, and the N-terminal extension region. (A) Schematic representation of the type-5 B1 isoform-specific regions. Positions
of the N-terminal extension, the LAVPRVPVAGV sequence, the (K/R)RRW motif, the S-rich motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif are

identical residues and colons indicate similar residues.

the hymenopteran/mecopteran EcR-A isoform and the
dipteran EcR-A isoform lacked the two N-terminal
sequences, but contained the subgroup-specific
sequences: The A isoform-specific region of the hymenopteran/mecopteran EcR-A isoform (type-4 A isoformspecific region) contained the D(S/T)S repeats, and that
of the dipteran EcR-A isoform generally contained the
YRLN sequence at the N-terminus. In addition,
although the isoform-specific region of the lepidopteran
EcR-A isoform structurally classified as the type-2 A isoform-specific region, it lacked the NLS.
The structural modifications in the B1 isoform-specific
region that accompanies insect evolution are represented in Figure 13B. All types of the B1 isoform-specific region contained three conserved microdomains: the
S-rich motif, the SP residues, and the DL-rich motif (the
B1 isoform-specific region of several heteropteran
insects did not contain the SP residues). The DL-rich
motif of the type-6 B1 isoform-specific region was structurally modified and showed a limited sequence similarity with the corresponding motif of other insects.
Interestingly, although Mecoptera is thought to be a sister taxon of Diptera [17], the P. pryeri EcR-B1 isoform
had a DL-rich motif quite similar to the corresponding
motif of the type-3 B1 isoform-specific region.
In addition to the three conserved microdomains, the
isoform-specific region of the EcR-B1 isoform contained

subgroup-specific N-terminal sequences. The EcR-B1
isoform of polyneopteran and paraneopteran insects
(types 2 and 2’ B1 isoform-specific region) generally contained the N-terminal TxxΨW sequence. In the holometabolous insects, the TxxΨW sequence was replaced with
the (K/R)RRW motif, a novel conserved microdomain at
the N-terminal end of the holometabolous insect EcR-B1
(types 3-6 B1 isoform-specific region). The hymenopteran/mecopteran EcR-B1 isoform contained the N-terminal LQTVPRVPVAGV (or LAVPRVPVAGV) sequence
just N-terminally adjacent to the (K/R)RRW motif (types
4 and 5 B1 isoform-specific region). Moreover, the EcRB1 isoform of the basal hymenopteran insects (sawflies)
and the mecopteran insect had the N-terminal extension
region (type 5 B1 isoform-specific region).

Discussion
Generally, the nuclear receptor A/B domain contains the
ligand-independent AF-1 transactivation domain that is
involved in the interaction with transcriptional cofactors
[18,19], and some nuclear receptors have multiple isoforms with different A/B domains that exhibit isoformspecific transcriptional regulation and physiological functions [20-23]. In the present study, we performed a structural analysis of the isoform-specific A/B domain of the
EcR-A and -B1 isoforms. Our data revealed the presence
of the conserved microdomain structures as well as the

insect subgroup-specific structural variations in the isoform-specific region in the A/B domain of each EcR isoform. The conserved microdomain structures in the EcR
isoform-specific regions might be the fundamental structural basis for the EcR isoform-specific AF-1 functions.
The A isoform-specific region generally contained the
SUMOylation motif, the NLS, the (D/E)(D/E)W residues, and the A-box. Among these structural motifs, the
(D/E)(D/E)W residues and the A-box were highly conserved in the C-terminal half of the A isoform-specific
region across arthropod species, suggesting that these
two microdomains are the essential structures for the A
isoform-specific AF-1. Moreover, the NLS was conserved among all species except for Heteroptera and
Lepidoptera. The NLS in the isoform-specific region of
Drosophila EcR-A isoform is involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in mammalian cells [24]. Our data
suggest that the isoform-specific region-mediated

nuclear localization mechanism of the EcR-A isoform is
conserved among most species.
The A/B domain of Drosophila EcR-A isoform exhibits weak transactivation activity in Drosophila Kc167
cells [12], whereas it exhibits transcriptional inhibition
activity in HeLa cells [13]. In the red flour beetle T. castaneum, the EcR-A isoform initiates ecdysone responses
by regulating the expression of downstream 20Eresponse genes, indicating that the EcR-A isoform functions as a transactivating factor. In the N-terminal half
of the A isoform-specific region, we found a conserved
SUMOylation motif. SUMOylation is a reversible posttranslational modification involved in various cellular
processes, such as nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and
transcriptional regulation [25-27]. SUMOylation of transcription factors generally results in the repression of
transcriptional activation activity [28]. The high level of
conservation of the SUMOylation motif in the A

specific region might function as signature motifs and/
or target sites for the EcR isoform-specific transcription
cofactors.
The A/B domain of the Drosophila EcR-B1 isoform
activates transcription even in yeast and mammalian
cells [13,37,38], therefore it is likely that the AF-1 region
of the EcR-B1 isoform activates transcription through
mechanisms conserved among eukaryotic organisms.
Among the conserved microdomains contained in the
Drosophila EcR-B1 isoform-specific region, the DL-rich
motif, which comprises tandem repeats of acidic residues (D and E) and aromatic/bulky hydrophobic residues (W, A, F, I, L, M, and V), was structurally similar
to the acidic activation domain (Figure 14A). Acidic
activation domains are found in viral and cellular transcription factors such as VP16, GAL4 and p53 [39-42],
as well as in the AF-1 region of several nuclear

isoform-specific region suggests that it is functionally
important. SUMOylation of the A isoform-specific
region might contribute to the cell-type/organismdependent transcriptional regulation mediated by the A/
B domain of the EcR-A isoform.
All types of the B1 isoform-specific region contained
the S-rich and the DL-rich conserved motifs. The isoform-specific region of the holometabolous insect EcRB1 isoform (types 3-6 B1 isoform-specific region) contained an additional (K/R)RRW motif at the N-terminus.
In Drosophila, strong transactivation activity was
mapped at the N-terminal end of the A/B domain of
the EcR-B1 isoform (amino acid residues 1-53) [13],
which includes all three conserved motifs. Moreover,
the S-rich motif-like sequences and the DL-rich motif
are found in the A/B domain of the ecdysone receptor
identified from the filarial nematode B. malayi. The
high level of conservation of the S-rich and DL-rich
motifs across ecdysozoan species suggests that these
motifs are the essential structures for the B1 isoformspecific AF-1 function.
The length and sequences of the linker regions
between microdomains, as well as the distribution of
microdomains in the isoform-specific region varied
across species. For example, the B1 isoform-specific
region of the non-insect arthropod EcR-B1 isoforms
(type-1 B1 isoform-specific region) contained a long linker region between the S-rich and the DL-rich motifs
(e.g., Daphnia magna EcR-B1 contained an 137-amino
acid linker region). In the holometabolous insects, the
three conserved motifs [the (K/R)RRW, the S-rich, and
the DL-rich motifs] were contained in the N-terminal
half of the B1 isoform-specific region, and the linker
regions between the motifs were shortened (e.g. type-6
B1 isoform-specific region). The isoform-specific region
of the EcR-B1 isoform identified in vespoid wasps contained a long S/H-rich insertion between the holometabolous insect-specific (K/R)RRW motif and the S-rich
motif. These data suggest that the conserved microdomains in the EcR isoform-specific regions are structurally, and even functionally, independent of each other.
In vitro and in silico structural analysis for the A/B
domain of the Drosophila EcR isoforms revealed that
the N-terminal region of the Drosophila EcR-B1 isoform-specific region, which contains the conserved
microdomains, is structurally disordered [29]. The
intrinsically disordered AF-1 region was found in many
other nuclear receptors, such as the androgen receptor
and the glucocorticoid receptor [30-34]. The intrinsic
disordered regions are found in a lot of proteins
involved in protein-protein interactions [35,36] and that
the nuclear receptor AF-1 region is involved in cofactor
recruitment and transcriptional regulation. Thus, the
conserved microdomains found in the EcR isoform-

the DL-rich motifs of the type 1-5 B1 isoform-specific regions. The

insect EcR-B1 isoform might have acquired a novel interaction
partner(s) in the holometabolous insect-specific (K/R)RRW motif.

receptors [43,44]. Further studies, such as protein-protein interaction studies, will shed light on the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the EcR-B1 isoformspecific AF-1.
In the present study, we discovered that the N-termini
of holometabolous insect EcR-B1 isoforms contain a
novel conserved (K/R)RRW motif, which is lacking in
the direct-developing insects. The (K/R)RRW motif was
found in the N-terminal region of the EcR-B1 isoform
identified in Hymenoptera, the most basal lineage of
holometabolous insects, suggesting that the (K/R)RRW
motif was acquired in association with the evolution of
holometabolous insects. Strikingly high conservation of
the (K/R)RRW motif across holometabolous insect species suggests its importance in the AF-1 function of the
holometabolous insect EcR-B1 isoform. Taken together,
we hypothesize that the holometabolous insect EcR-B1
isoform acquired a novel transcriptional regulation
mechanism that is mediated by the (K/R)RRW motif
(Figure 14B).

Conclusions
A comprehensive structural comparison of the N-terminal isoform-specific region in the A/B domain of the
EcR-A and -B1 isoforms in insects revealed several
microdomain structures that are conserved across
insects or acquired/modified in a specific-subgroup of
insects. These microdomains might be the essential
structural basis for the EcR isoform-specific AF-1 transactivation functions by serving as binding sites for coregulatory proteins or as post-translational modification
sites. The novel (K/R)RRW motif in the isoform-specific
region of the holometabolous insect EcR-B1 isoform
might provide additional interaction sites for co-regulatory proteins and mediate the holometabolous insectspecific regulation of the B1 isoform-specific AF-1 transactivation function. Identification of binding partners of
the EcR isoform-specific regions and structural analysis
of the interaction interface will provide further insight
into the evolutionary importance of the structural modifications of the EcR isoform-specific AF-1 regions.

RNA isolation and reverse transcription

Tissues were dissected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (138 mM NaCl, 3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 10 mM
NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4), and immediately homogenized in
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or stored in
RNA later reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX) at -20°C until
use. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent and
treated with DNase I (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) at 37°C for
1 h. For standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) experiments, total RNA (1 μg) was
reverse transcribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with a 3’ rapid amplification of the
cDNA end (3’ RACE) adapter packaged in the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit as a primer. For 5’ RACE, total
RNA was modified using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE
kit and reverse transcribed using Superscript III reverse
transcriptase with a random decamer as a primer.
Cloning of cDNA fragments that encode the A/B and C
domains of EcR isoforms

First, we cloned cDNA fragments encoding the C
domain and the C-terminal region of the A/B domain of
EcR isoforms by RT-PCR. Then, we performed 5’ RACE
using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion) to
determine translation initiation site of the gene. Finally,
we cloned cDNA fragments encoding the full length of
the A/B domain of EcR isoforms. The obtained cDNA
sequences were registered with GenBank. Detailed
experimental procedures are described below.
Generally, we performed nested or semi-nested PCR
to amplify a desired cDNA fragment in the RT-PCR and
the 5’ RACE experiments. First, PCR was performed
using either KOD-plus polymerase (ToYoBo, Osaka,
Japan) or TaKaRa LA Taq (TaKaRa), and nested PCR
was performed using either TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa)
or TaKaRa LA Taq. The amplified DNA fragments
were subcloned into the plasmid vector pGEM-T easy
(Promega, Madison, WI), and the nucleotide sequences
were determined using ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The
sequences of the degenerate/consensus primers used for
the partial cDNA cloning are listed in Additional file 3,
Table S3. The sequences of the primers used to amplify
a cDNA encoding the full-length of the A/B domain of
EcR isoforms are listed in Additional file 4, Table S2.
Cloning of cDNA fragments encoding the EcR C domain

To obtain the partial cDNA fragments encoding the
ecdysone receptor (EcR) C domain, we performed
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-

PCR) with primers designed on the basis of the highly
conserved amino acid residues among the insect EcR C
domain (EELCLVCGD and TCEGCKGFF for forward
degenerate primers, MYMRRKCQE and VGMRAECV
for reverse degenerate primers).
Cloning of cDNA fragments encoding the C-terminal region
of the A/B domain of EcR-B1 isoform from insects and noninsect arthropods expect for Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and
Trichoptera

To obtain the cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal
region of the A/B domain of EcR-B1 isoform from
insects and non-insect arthropods other than Hemiptera
and Hymenoptera, we performed RT-PCR with a forward consensus primer designed on the basis of the
conserved nucleotide sequence among three Coleopteran EcR-B1s (GenBank accession numbers: CAL25731,
CAA72296, and BAD99297) and two Crustacean EcRs
(GenBank accession numbers: AAC33432 and
BAF49033). The reverse gene-specific primers were
designed on the basis of the obtained cDNA sequence
encoding the C domain. To determine the translation
initiation site, we performed 5’ RACE with gene-specific
primers designed on the basis of the obtained partial
cDNA encoding the A/B domain of EcR-B1 isoform.
Cloning of cDNA fragments encoding the C-terminal region
of the A/B domain of EcR-B1 isoform from Hymenoptera

We designed an alternative forward primer on the
basis of the consensus nucleotide sequence conserved
among three hymenopteran insects. Briefly, we performed a genomic tBlastn search with an amino acid
sequence of the Pheidole megacephala EcR-B1 isoform
(GenBank accession number: BAE47510) against the
genomic DNA sequences of Nasonia vitripennis and
Apis mellifera to predict the DNA sequences encoding
the A/B domain of EcR-B1 isoform. We then designed
two forward consensus primers on the basis of the
conserved nucleotide sequence encoding the A/B
domain of hymenopteran insect EcR-B1 isoform. We
simultaneously designed a reverse consensus primer on
the basis of the conserved nucleotide sequence encoding the C domain of EcR. To obtain the partial cDNA
fragment encoding the C-terminal region of the A/B
domain of EcR-B1 isoform from Hymenoptera, we performed RT-PCR with the forward and reverse consensus primers.
Cloning of cDNA fragments encoding the C-terminal region
of the A/B domain of EcR-B1 isoform from Hemiptera and
Trichoptera

Because the forward degenerate primer described above
did not work for hemipteran and trichopteran EcR-B1
gene, we performed 5’ RACE with reverse gene-specific
primers designed on the basis of the obtained cDNA
sequence encoding the C domain of EcR.

Cloning of cDNA fragments encoding the C-terminal region
of the A/B domain of EcR-A isoform

To obtain the cDNA fragment encoding the A/B
domain of EcR-A isoform from arthropods other than
Hymenoptera, we performed 5’ RACE with gene-specific
primers designed on the basis of the obtained partial
cDNA sequence encoding the C domain of EcR.
To obtain cDNA fragment encoding EcR-A isoform
from hymenopteran insects, we first designed a forward
consensus primer encoding the C-terminal region of the
A isoform-specific region. The forward consensus primer for hymenopteran EcR-A isoform was designed on
the basis of the conserved nucleotide sequences of three
hymenopteran EcR-A isoforms (GenBank accession
numbers: XP_001602885, XP_394760, BAF79665, and
BAE47509). We then performed RT-PCR with the forward and reverse consensus primers to obtain the partial cDNA encoding the C-terminal of the A/B domain
of EcR-A isoform.
5’ RACE

To determine a translation initiation site of the gene, we
performed 5’ RACE using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE
kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The reverse gene-specific primers were designed based
on the obtained cDNA encoding the isoform-specific
region of EcR isoforms.
Cloning of cDNA fragments encoding the full-length of the
A/B domain of EcR isoforms

To obtain a cDNA fragment encoding the full-length A/
B domain of EcR isoforms, we designed a forward genespecific primer at the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of
the gene. Reverse gene specific primers were designed
on the basis of the obtained cDNA corresponding to the
C domain of EcR. To clone A. mellifera EcR isoforms,
we designed a reverse gene-specific primer at the 3’
UTR of the gene on the basis of the predicted fulllength cDNA encoding EcR-A isoform (GenBank accession number: XM_394760).
Sequence comparison

GenBank accession numbers of EcR-A and -B1 isoforms
used for sequence comparison are listed in Additional
file 1, Table S1 and Additional file 2, Table S2, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of the isoform-specific region of EcR-A and -B1 isoforms were
aligned with the ClustalX 2.0 program [45] or MAFFT
6.0 program [46], and then manually adjusted. Prediction of potential SUMOylation sites was performed
using SUMOsp 2.0 program [47]. The Sequence Logos
and the consensus sequences were generated using the
Geneious 4.8 program [48] to represent sequence conservation. All alignment files were supplemented in
FASTA format (Additional file 5).
