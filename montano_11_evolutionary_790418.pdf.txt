Evolutionary origin of peptidoglycan recognition
proteins in vertebrate innate immune system
Adriana M Montaño1,2, Fumi Tsujino, Naoyuki Takahata1, Yoko Satta1*

Abstract
Background: Innate immunity is the ancient defense system of multicellular organisms against microbial infection.
The basis of this first line of defense resides in the recognition of unique motifs conserved in microorganisms, and
absent in the host. Peptidoglycans, structural components of bacterial cell walls, are recognized by Peptidoglycan
Recognition Proteins (PGRPs). PGRPs are present in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Although some evidence for
similarities and differences in function and structure between them has been found, their evolutionary history and
phylogenetic relationship have remained unclear. Such studies have been severely hampered by the great extent
of sequence divergence among vertebrate and invertebrate PGRPs. Here we investigate the birth and death
processes of PGRPs to elucidate their origin and diversity.
Results: We found that (i) four rounds of gene duplication and a single domain duplication have generated the
major variety of present vertebrate PGRPs, while in invertebrates more than ten times the number of duplications
are required to explain the repertoire of present PGRPs, and (ii) the death of genes in vertebrates appears to be
almost null whereas in invertebrates it is frequent.
Conclusion: These results suggest that the emergence of new PGRP genes may have an impact on the availability
of the repertoire and its function against pathogens. These striking differences in PGRP evolution of vertebrates
and invertebrates should reflect the differences in the role of their innate immunity. Insights on the origin of PGRP
genes will pave the way to understand the evolution of the interaction between host and pathogens and to lead
to the development of new treatments for immune diseases that involve proteins related to the recognition of self
and non-self.

Background
Innate immunity is the ancient defense system of multicellular organisms against microbial infection. The basis of
this first line of defense resides in the recognition of
unique motifs or components conserved in microorganisms, and absent in the host. The innate immune system
uses sets of pattern recognition receptors to recognize
such foreign or non-self motifs. Proteins in the immune
system can be located intracellularly, on the cell surface,
or secreted into the bloodstream, ready to signal the presence of an intruder in every compartment. In systems
lacking the adaptive arm of immunity, the pattern recognition concept serves well to explain the general triggering

of the system as well as providing receptors for the limited
specificity shown by innate immunity [1-4].
Peptidoglycan (PGN) is the major structural component of the cell wall of almost all bacterial species. PGN
is a large, repetitive macromolecule that forms the rigid
cell wall of bacteria. PGN recognition is mediated by the
PGRP (PGN recognition protein) family of receptors
[5,6]. PGRPs are a family of innate immunity pattern
recognition molecules that were first discovered in silkworms [7]. There are four loci for each PGRPs in humans
[8,9] (PGRP-S, PGRP-L, PGRP-Ia and PGRP-Ib), while
thirteen loci in Drosophila [10,11], which encode
approximately 17 PGRP proteins through alternative splicing, and seven loci in Anopheles [12]. Several other genomes also show relatively large number of PGRPs in
invertebrates, but only up to five in vertebrates (Additional file 1). In invertebrates, the functional divergence
of each PGRP molecule is well investigated: Some possess

an amidase activity that hydrolyzes the amide bond
between the N-acetylmuramic acid and the L-alanine of
peptidoglycan, others activate Toll, or Imd pathways to
induce an expression of anti-bacteria peptides, induce
prophenoloxidase cascade, or directly cause phagocytosis
and lysis [13-18]. On the other hand, functions of vertebrate, or mainly mammalian PGRPs, are not fully understood [19]. While PGRP-L has the amidase activity where
its role could be to detoxify PGN fragments present in
blood and modulate the immune response as insect
PGRPs, the PGRP-S, PGRP-Ia and PGRP-Ib have bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal function [6,20-22].
Vertebrates have the acquired immunity system in
addition to the innate immunity system, while in insects
only the latter is a self-defense system. It is of interest
whether possessing acquired immunity has effects on
the evolution of molecules involved in innate immunity.
Here, we investigate the birth and death processes of
PGRPs by systematically analyzing PGRP genes from a
set of diverse eukaryotes, and discuss the role of selection and diversification of this gene family.

Results
Modes of PGRP evolution

To detect lineage-specific expansions 40 sequences of
the PGRP family from 21 vertebrate species and 42
sequences from 6 invertebrate species were studied
(Additional file 1 and Additional file 2). Both vertebrate
and invertebrate PGRPs have a highly conserved
C-terminal region of the PGRP domain with three subdomains (I, II and III). The sub-domains are determined
by sequence conservation and not by their function. The
PGRP domain shows a sequence similarity (~35%) with
bacteriophage T7 lysozyme, which also has amidase
activity, indicating that T7 lysozyme would be the origin
of PGRP domains [23]. This ancient origin of PGRP
domains is also supported by the similarity of the 3D
structure between PGRP-L and T7 lysozyme molecules.
However, the orthologous relationship of vertebrate and
insect PGRP domains has not been ensured [8,19] due
to the limited number of amino acid sites compared and
the great extent of sequence divergence among them.
Contrary to the conserved C-terminal PGRP domains,
the N-terminal region shows no particular similarities
among different PGRPs in invertebrates, and partial
similarities among PGRP-S, PGRP-Ia and PGRP-Ib in
vertebrates. Therefore, we used only the PGRP domains
for the alignment and tree construction. Due to difficulties in identifying orthologous relationship, we performed phylogenetic analyses of PGRP genes in
vertebrates and invertebrates separately by using the
neighbor-joining (NJ) and minimum evolution (ME)
methods. There was no conflict in the topologies
obtained with these methods.

In vertebrate PGRPs, the phylogeny shows five clustering groups, four of which corresponds to four loci found
in humans; PGRP-L, PGRP-S, PGRP-Ia and PGRP-Ib.
On the other hand, the fifth locus, named PGRP-F, is
found only in fish. Including PGRP-F, there are four
rounds of gene duplication and a single round of
domain duplication, which produced the present-day
vertebrate PGRPs (Figure 1, Additional file 3). The first
round of gene duplication happened in the stem lineage
leading to all jawed vertebrates. This duplication produced PGRP-F and the proto-PGRP that is an ancestor
of PGRPs in other jawed vertebrates. In the second
round, gene duplication occurred just after the first
round and produced proto-PGRP-L and proto-PGRP-S.
In addition to these two rounds, there is at least, an
additional duplication in proto-PGRP-L in the lineage
leading to fish PGRP-L. On the other hand, no descendant of proto-PGRP-S was detected in fish genomes.
PGRP-S and proto-PGRP-I were produced after one
round of duplication in proto-PGRP-S descendant in the
stem lineage leading to tetrapods. The presence of
PGRP-S in amphibians suggests the loss of proto-PGRPI in this lineage. Just after this duplication and before
the divergence of therian mammals, the proto-PGRP-I
possesses two PGRP domains [24] due to the domain
duplication 252~336 million years ago. After the divergence of opossums from placental mammals, the last
round of gene duplication occurred 126~168 MYA producing PGRP-Ia and PGRP-Ib. This observation indicates that PGRP-Ia and PGRP-Ib are placental mammalspecific genes.
The gene structure of vertebrate PGRPs (Figure 2)
supports the above scenario, which explains the emergence of the vertebrate PGRPs. The PGRP-S contains
two introns, one of which shares the position with both
PGRP-I and PGRP-L, while the other only with PGRP-I.
The position of this intron is preserved in the duplicated
PGRP domains of PGRP-I. Further, the N-terminal
regions of PGRP-Ia and -Ib genes show some sequence
similarity with the PGRP-S N-terminal amino acid
sequence. These observations indicate that the PGRP-L
diverged first, PGRP-I is originated from PGRP-S, and
the second PGRP domain in PGRP-I has been produced
by domain duplication in PGRP-S. In addition to the
main events, which originated the PGRP family commonly found in mammals, we also observed a recent
domain duplication event in zebrafish PGRP-L where
the domains exhibit homology of 99% (Figure 1).
In contrast to this relatively small number of gene duplications and gene losses in vertebrate PGRPs, the birth and
death process shows a different pattern in invertebrate
PGRPs. The number of PGRP loci in the invertebrate genome ranges from four in A. mellifera to 14 in B. mori.

(Additional file 2), we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree
of PGRP domains for insects. In contrast to vertebrates,
invertebrate PGRP genes are not clearly classified into
orthologous groups. As representatives of the class Insecta,
we used four genomes, which correspond to four different
orders (Diptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera).
The divergence time of these orders is similar to that of
vertebrates. Gene duplication and loss are rather frequent
and taxon-specific sets of PGRPs are evident. For example,
in Drosophila only six of the thirteen are found in different
orders, and seven seem to be Drosophila specific. The phylogenetic tree reveals that at least 14 rounds of gene duplication and two of gene losses are required to produce
the extant repertoire of PGRPs in Drosophila genome
(Figure 3, Additional file 4). A similar pattern of speciesspecific gene duplication and gene loss is observed in
other insects, too.
The mentioned observation could be confirmed by
using other methods that can predict the number of
gene gains and losses. We verified our observations by
using the program NOTUNG and EvolMAP [25,26].
The results with NOTUNG showed a similar tendency
of the number of gene gains predicted (Additional file 5
and Additional file 6), however the number of gene
losses seems to be overestimated in vertebrates, especially in fish. In NOTUNG, absence of a gene in a particular taxon means gene loss. Thus the number of losses
in fish became enormously large. EvolMAP, on the
other hand, predicts that gene gains are 8.6 times more
frequent than gene losses in invertebrates over all
branches. This suggests an expansion of PGRPs in invertebrates. For vertebrates, EvolMAP analysis shows no
evidence of expansion or contraction for this gene
family (Additional file 7 and Additional file 8). Overall,
for the genes and species analyzed here, we find that the

Due to the limited number of sites compared and long
divergence time of sequences, we could not elucidate
the relationship among the ancestors of vertebrate and
invertebrate PGRPs from the phylogenetic tree of vertebrate and invertebrate PGRPs, including T7 lysozyme.
Thus whether the origin of vertebrate PGRPs is monophyletic or paraphyletic to invertebrate PGRPs remains
to be an open problem. However, our analysis clearly
shows that for vertebrate PGRPs, the first major divergence took place between PGRP-L and PGRP-S. Therefore, in the following we focus on the vertebrate PGRPs
to infer the functions of the ancestral PGRP genes.
To elucidate the function of ancestral PGRP molecules
in vertebrates, the amino acid sequences of proto- PGRP-L
and PGRP-S molecules were estimated by the maximumlikelihood (ML) method with the JTT substitution matrix
[27]. It is known that seven amino acids are responsible
for PGRP function [1,8]. Four amino acid residues (H17,
Y46, H122, and C130) are essential for the amidase activity, whereas three (H36, W41, and K128) are important
for Zn2+ ligand-binding in the bacteriophage T7 lysozyme.
Since all seven amino acids are conserved in both the
proto- PGRP-L and PGRP-S sequences, the ancestor of
both proto-PGRPs is likely to possess the amidase activity
(Additional file 9). While the present-day PGRP-L has
reserved its original function of amidase activity [20],
PGRP-S has lost it and instead obtained the bacteriostatic
function [21,22]. On the other hand, the invertebrate
PGRPs possessing the amidase activity are paraphyletic to
each other. This suggests independent gain or loss of the
amidase activity in invertebrate PGRP at an early stage of
the evolution.
Selection acting on PGRPs and Evolutionary Rates

Next important question is whether some kind of selection process has acted on each amino acid site of vertebrate PGRP genes that will lead to their functional
divergence after gene duplication. We identified positively or negatively selected sites in vertebrate PGRPs
using Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) analysis as described in Methods [28]. Only the site 138 in
PGRP-L is positively selected among all the vertebrate
PGRPs. This site, which is involved in substrate binding,
shows a high degree of amino acid variation in PGRP-L
of different species.
Average values of the ratios of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions of PGRP-S, L and I are 0.16,
0.13 and 0.17, respectively, and the overall value for

PGRPs is 0.20. This indicates strong functional constraint, suggesting that amino acid sequences of these
domains are well conserved among vertebrates.
Although there is a report where a few positively
selected sites were observed in the PGRP domain of
Drosophila PGRP-LC [29], we could not apply the above
SLAC analysis to invertebrate PGRPs, because the clustering pattern and phylogenetic relationship among
sequences are not ensured and the results of SLAC
strongly depend on the tree topology (data not shown).
We further examined parallel and convergent evolution at the amino acid level to infer the operation of
natural selection. We aligned 39 vertebrate PGRP
sequences for each locus and deduced the ancestral
amino acids [27] at all internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree (Figure 1), in order to estimate the presence
of parallel and convergent substitutions, which may
have been driven by the functional importance of sites.
Subsequently the probability of a parallel or convergent
substitution by chance was estimated as described in
Methods. Our analysis revealed that thirteen sites have
experienced parallel and twenty-three sites convergent
substitutions, of which occurrence is statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) (Table 1, Figure 4). Comparison of these
sites based on the tertiary structure of Drosophila
PGRP-LB [23], Drosophila PGRP-SA [30], and Human
PGRP-Ia [24] showed that all these residues are located
on a helices (sites 38, 41, 43, 45 and 52 in a1; 105, 108,
109, 113, 114, 117, 120, 121 and 123 in a 2; and 145 in
a 3) and on b-sheets (site 2 on b1; 12 and 15 on b2; 89
and 96 on b6). Sites 2, 5, 12 and 15 are located on the
PGRP specific fragment (Table 1).
Among the six parallel sites and ten convergent sites,
which occurred with a significance level of 1%, sites 45,
78, and 123 may be potential adaptive sites. Site 45 has
three independent parallel changes of S (Ser) to A (Ala)
only in fish PGRP-L (three spine stickleback, rainbow
trout and zebrafish). Serine is the only amino acid residue present in this site in PGRP-L except for these
fishes. Moreover, exclusively non-polar character of this
site indicates that it may have an important role in the
function of these proteins especially because this residue
is involved in substrate binding. Site 78 has suffered one
parallel and one convergent substitution. The chemical
profile of this site in mammal PGRP-S is exclusively
hydrophobic. The variability which results from the
change of I (Ile) to the polar T (Thr) in pig and cow
may suggest an effect on the structure since this amino
acid is located in the hydrophobic core. At the site 123
there is a convergent change of A (Ala) or Y (Tyr) to V
(Val) in pig and frog PGRP-S, respectively located in the
hydrophobic core. Both substitutions create a possible
adaptive site in PGRP-S gene.

invertebrates, we observed several differences, which are
characteristic of each mode of evolution. First of all,

most recent common ancestor in each vertebrate and
invertebrate (insect) species, the phylogenetic trees
clearly show different patterns. In invertebrates each
PGRP shows a relatively longer branch than those in
vertebrates, suggesting a relatively ancient origin of each
PGRP in invertebrates. In addition, in invertebrates the
clustering pattern was rarely orthologous among PGRP
genes, while in vertebrates orthologous relationship was
clearly seen. This observation shows that higher rates of
birth and death processes are seen in invertebrates than
in vertebrates. Although the repertoire of PGRPs in
each species may depend on some ecological and biological conditions, a less frequent birth and death process
in vertebrates could reflect the presence of acquired
immune system.
Consequences of Natural Selection on PGRPs

In vertebrate PGRP proteins we observed changes as
consequence of parallel and convergent amino acid substitutions, with significance greater than the random
chance expectation. The changes may be either due to
conservation of chemical property of amino acids at the
site or due to modification of their properties. Convergent or parallel substitutions can provide evidence for
the action of natural selection for keeping the function
or structure [32].
PGRP proteins play an important role in innate
immunity, which requires updated and immediate
responses, because pathogens may change frequently. As
a consequence, a high turnover rate is expected to happen. Actually, in invertebrates, the frequent turnover of
PGRP repertoire was observed. On the other hand, several motifs indispensable for peptidoglycan recognition
should be conserved through evolution of PGRPs in
both vertebrates and invertebrates. In addition, we have
observed that the amino acid residues that are located
on the hydrophobic groove have high degree of conservation and do not show any parallel or convergent
amino acid substitution.
Evolution of the PGRP family in vertebrates and
invertebrates and functional implications

This study provides for the first time a description of
the origin and mode of evolution on vertebrate PGRPs,
compared with invertebrates, namely insects, PGRPs.
PGRPs are proposed to be a family of genes that
evolved by birth and death process with different rates
in vertebrates and invertebrates. In the model of the
birth and death process [33,34], some of the duplicated
genes diverge functionally, but others become pseudogenes due to deleterious mutations or are deleted from
the genome. The end result of this mode of evolution is
a multi-gene family with a mixture of divergent groups

of genes and highly homologous genes. We have
observed that PGRPs have experienced several rounds of
gene duplications and some duplicated genes have been
deleted from the genome. This lineage specific birth and
death process has been observed both in vertebrates and
invertebrates.
The PGRP proteins are involved in innate immunity,
which responds to protect the organisms from invading
pathogens. Therefore, several motifs in PGRP domains
are, of course, indispensable for pathogen recognition
and have been conserved through the vertebrate and
invertebrate evolution. However, since vertebrates possess acquired immunity, the significance of innate
immunity might be more relaxed than in insects whose
immune systems depend solely on innate immunity.
This difference in the evolutionary patterns could be
related to the plasticity of the receptors to detect a
broad spectrum of microbial pathogens and it is clearly
reflected in the birth and death process of the PGRP
molecules in vertebrates and invertebrates.

Conclusions
PGRP gene family reveals an example of genetic and
functional variation of which roles in the immune systems are understood through an analysis of comparative
genomics. Especially the analysis reveals that the mode of
PGRP evolution was characterized by birth and death
process. Vertebrates and invertebrates show striking differences in the evolutionary tempo and mode of PGRP
genes. Broad repertoire of pathogen recognition proteins
is advantageous in invertebrates, due to the absence of
adaptive immunity, in contrast to the moderate repertoire in vertebrates. This reveals that the mode of evolution of a system strongly depends on other systems,
which interact with the former both directly or indirectly.
Methods
Sequence Data

The sequences were retrieved from the genomic and
EST NCBI database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, the
Ensembl database http://www.ensembl.org and the
TIGR database http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/ using
TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/BLAST/. Search was performed using each exon of
human PGRP-S, PGRP-L, PGRP-Ia, and PGRP-Ib as a
probe. Takifugu rubripes PGRP-L full cDNA and genomic sequences were predicted using Genscan and confirmed by sequence analysis. Takifugu rubripes liver
tissue was kindly provided by Dr. Shugo Watabe of the
University of Tokyo, Japan. The Eptatretus burgeri
PGRP cDNA sequence was kindly provided by Dr.
Masanori Kasahara of The Graduate University for
Advanced Studies (Sokendai), Hayama, Japan.

GenBank accession numbers

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)

Additional file 7: Average orthologs divergence tree of vertebrate
PGRPs. The EvolMAP analysis predicted 14 gains and 14 losses. Inparalogs, diverged in-paralogs and ambiguous gains constituted 36%, 57%
and 7% of total gains, respectively. Gene gains (+) and gene losses (-) are
depicted for each branch. Number of in-paralogs, diverged in-paralogs
and ambiguous gains are indicated below or next to each gene gain [26].

Based on the partial sequence information of chicken
PGRP-L retrieved from databases, we reconstructed the
missing 3’ region of the transcript using the BD
SMART™ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech,
USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Additional file 8: Average orthologs divergence tree of invertebrate
PGRPs. The EvolMAP analysis predicted 26 gains and 8 losses. Inparalogs, and diverged in-paralogs gains constituted 27%, and 73% of
total gains, respectively. Gene gains (+) and gene losses (-) are depicted
for each branch. Number of in-paralogs, diverged in-paralogs and
ambiguous gains are indicated below or next to each gene gain [26].

The nomenclature used in this study and the accession
numbers are listed on Additional Files 1 and 2.

Additional file 9: Alignment of PGRP ancestral sequences. Alignment
of ancestral sequences of PGRP-L and PGRP-S. A dash means the same
amino acid as the above. A blue star indicates the amino acid position
responsible for Zn2+ ligand binding, whereas a red star indicates the
amino acid position responsible for amidase activity. These sites are
inferred from the sequences of T7 lysozyme of bacteriophage.

Data analyses

Sequences were aligned using the CLUSTALW version
1.83 computer program with its default parameter setting
[35] and manually adjusted using the GeneDoc program
version 2.6.002 [36]. Phylogenetical analyses were done
using the neighbor-joining (NJ) and minimum evolution
(ME) methods in MEGA version 4 [37]. The NJ and ME
trees were based on the number of differences, and reliability was assessed by bootstrap values with 1000 replications. The reconciliation between species tree and gene
tree along with the confirmation of the gene loss/duplication scenario were determined by using Notung 2.6 [25]
and EvolMAP software [26]. To detect positive selection at
single amino acid sites the Data Monkey software program
was used with its default parameter setting http://www.
datamonkey.org/. Poisson and gamma genetic distances
were determined by using MEGA version 4 [37].
Test of convergence

The ancestral sequences were determined using the program ANCESTOR [27], and the significance of the convergent and parallel sites was estimated using the
program CONVERG2 [32].
