Abstract
Background: Plant-feeding insects make up a large part of earth's total biodiversity. While it has
been shown that herbivory has repeatedly led to increased diversification rates in insects, there has
been no compelling explanation for how plant-feeding has promoted speciation rates. There is a
growing awareness that ecological factors can lead to rapid diversification and, as one of the most
prominent features of most insect-plant interactions, specialization onto a diverse resource has
often been assumed to be the main process behind this diversification. However, specialization is
mainly a pruning process, and is not able to actually generate diversity by itself. Here we investigate
the role of host colonizations in generating insect diversity, by testing if insect speciation rate is
correlated with resource diversity.
Results: By applying a variant of independent contrast analysis, specially tailored for use on
questions of species richness (MacroCAIC), we show that species richness is strongly correlated
with diversity of host use in the butterfly family Nymphalidae. Furthermore, by comparing the
results from reciprocal sister group selection, where sister groups were selected either on the
basis of diversity of host use or species richness, we find that it is likely that diversity of host use is
driving species richness, rather than vice versa.
Conclusion: We conclude that resource diversity is correlated with species richness in the
Nymphalidae and suggest a scenario based on recurring oscillations between host expansions – the
incorporation of new plants into the repertoire – and specialization, as an important driving force
behind the diversification of plant-feeding insects.

Background
The biodiversity crisis calls for a better understanding not
only of the reasons for loss of diversity, but also for the
processes that generate diversity. Plant-feeding insects are
remarkably species-rich, making up at least one-quarter of
all described species, so explaining the mechanisms
behind the diversification of these groups will go a long
way towards understanding global biodiversity [1,2]. The
possible link between insect diversification and feeding

on plants was made already by Ehrlich and Raven [3] in
their seminal paper on the coevolution between butterflies and plants. Since then, it has been clearly demonstrated that herbivory has repeatedly led to rapid
diversification of insects, but the mechanisms behind this
diversification still remain uncertain [4,5]. Compared
with alternative resources, plants are characterized by
both high availability and high diversity. Insect diversification rates could conceivably be influenced by both

resource abundance (decreased competition) and diversity (larger number of potential niches), but these hypotheses have so far not been tested with phylogenetic
methods.
It has become clear that ecological factors can cause rapid
speciation and evolutionary divergence [6]. For plantfeeding insects, the widespread specialization on a diverse
resource has been seen as a likely ecological mechanism
behind the rapid diversification [7-11]. The word specialization can refer to both a state and a process. The specialization process will give rise to an increasingly specialized
state, by decreasing the number of plants used as hosts. It
is as a process that specialization can influence speciation
rates, and to emphasize this aspect we use the term, even
when referring to states, in a relative sense; an insect that
uses two plant species as hosts is for instance less specialized than an insect that uses one, but more specialized
than an insect that uses three [c.f. [12]].
There are at least two ways that specialization can promote speciation rates: either by a genetic linking between
resource use and mate choice, which could create "host
races" with an increasing genetic differentiation [10,1315], or because a resource specialist's host will tend to be
more patchily distributed and thus increase the likelihood
of differentiation among populations [11,16].
Both these mechanisms appear valid [10,11] but they
only provide a mechanism for part of the process; the
actual breaking up of an existing coherent species into distinct daughter species. Specialization is essentially a pruning process, preserving certain existing interactions at the
expense of others. This can cause divergence, if there is a
structuring factor, such as geographic heterogeneity or
resource-based assortative mating, and if different
resources are favored in different subsets of the species.
However, by its own action, the process would soon run
out of "fuel" – the variation in host use that drives the
process. Once a species has reached a truly specialized
state, further specialization is impossible. Therefore, we
also need to incorporate a process that is inherently diversifying. Something must cause the original species to have
a widespread distribution – or to have several host species
to form host races on – in the first place.
If indeed diversification was only driven by specialization,
we would see a never-ending drive towards increasing specificity and ultimately all further diversification could
only be accomplished by cospeciation with the host. With
the increasing availability of phylogenetic information
and better understanding of the coevolutionary process
this "dead-end" view of specialization and the corresponding cospeciation scenario has been challenged.
First, the increased likelihood of extinction will tend to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/4

counterbalance speciation rates in highly specialized lineages [17]. Moreover, most interactions, even the most specialized, are evolutionarily dynamic, where the possibility
of generalization is always present [9,12,17-24]. Finally,
despite many attempts, cospeciation has rarely been
found among plant-feeding insects. Most studies have
instead concluded that host colonizations and shifts are
much more important processes behind the patterns of
insect-plant associations [12,24-34]. Moreover, in many
cases the patterns of host use cannot logically be attributed to cospeciation due to asynchrony in diversification
events for the associated groups of plants and insects
[27,30].
Colonization of novel host plants is an evolutionary process that is capable of generating new variation in host use,
and could thus conceivably be the "missing fuel" in the
engine of diversification. Even if there seem to be a general conservatism in host use among most groups of
plant-feeding insects [3,27,35], there have also been studies which have seen a great deal of evolutionary flexibility
in host use, with numerous colonizations and host shifts,
sometimes even in ecological time [26,36-39]. More
detailed phylogenetic studies have also revealed a more
dynamic pattern of host use than the more large-scale
assessments suggested, probably because many of the host
colonizations seemed to involve a limited set of plant
groups – "building blocks" of host plant range that can be
combined in different ways [12,40-43]. Phylogenetic
reconstructions within the butterfly tribe Nymphalini
have suggested that more radical host shifts were more
common during periods of host range expansion, and
that this diversification of host use appeared to be connected to increased speciation rates [12,44], but the sample sizes were too small to draw any general conclusions.
If species richness among plant-feeding insects has been
promoted by the diversification of the plant interaction,
there should be a general correlation between host diversity and species richness. The main objective of this study
is therefore to test if species richness is correlated with
resource diversity in the butterfly family Nymphalidae,
and to provide a plausible mechanism for this diversification. To test this hypothesis, we have performed an independent contrast analysis to look for a general
phylogenetic correlation between diversity of host plants
and species richness. To further address the question of
causality we also performed reciprocal sister group analyses where either host diversity or species richness was used
as a basis for sister group selection.

Results and discussion
The correlation between diversity of host use and species
richness was tested with the computer program MacroCAIC [45], which applies the method of independent

Reciprocal sister group comparisons
Reciprocal sister group comparisons. A schematic illustration of the application of reciprocal sister group comparisons to evaluate questions of causation for associated traits
in situations where only correlational analyses are possible,
but where the correlation is not absolute. (a) Trait 1 and 2
are positively correlated across the phylogeny, so that a difference in one trait is associated with a correlated difference
in the other. (b) Provided that the correlation is not perfect,
there will be situations where a difference in trait 1 is not
associated with a correlated difference in trait 2, and (c) conversely, where a difference in trait 2 is not associated with a
correlated difference in trait 1. This can be interpreted to
mean that the traits, although statistically influenced by each
other, sometimes evolve for external reasons. If (b) is more
common than (c), trait 1 can sometimes change without an
associated change in trait 2, while trait 2 rarely evolves without an associated change in trait 1. Hence, trait 2 does not
necessarily follow the evolution of trait 1, but trait 1 appears
to follow the evolution of trait 2.

contrasts to questions of species richness. The contrasts
generated by MacroCAIC did not meet assumptions for
regression analysis, but a Wilcoxon matched-pair signedrank test on the independent contrasts showed a strong
positive association between contrasts for host plant
diversity and species richness (N = 204, z = 6.446, p <<
0.001; Fig. 2). The test is correlational and causation could
conceivably go both ways, but it clearly demonstrates that
diversity of host use is correlated with host plant diversity.
To address the question of causality we performed reciprocal sister group comparisons, where sister clades were
chosen on the basis of either differences in host plant
diversity or in species numbers (Fig. 1). There were 22
valid sister pairs in the phylogeny that differed in host
diversity. Of these, 18 showed a positive correlation with
species richness (Sign test, p = 0.004). By using the reciprocal method of pairing selection there were 24 pairs that
differed in species richness and among these, 16 were positively correlated with host diversity (Sign test, p = 0.152).
Hence, the correlation was more pronounced when using
host plant diversity as a basis for sister group selection
than when using species numbers (Fig. 3; Table 1 and 2).
The different outcome of the two methods of sister pair
selection suggests that host plant numbers do not auto-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/4

matically increase with increasing species numbers. This
means that the relationship between host range and species richness is not absolute and that there must be cases
where speciation events have apparently not been associated with increases in host diversity, which is hardly surprising. On the other hand, when there has been an
increase in host diversity, this is almost always followed
by an increase in species richness. Consequently, the data
is more consistent with the hypothesis that it is host plant
diversity that influences species numbers rather than vice
versa.
We have previously shown that diverse host plant use
within the tribe Nymphalini was typically caused by
ancestral polyphagy, which may or may not have secondarily evolved into more specialized interactions [12]. Virtually all documented host plant colonizations in that
study led to host expansions, not to direct host shifts, and
the evolutionary trend in this group was actually towards
increased generalization rather than specialization. These
butterflies appears to have been caught in a phase where a
lowered host specificity allowed them to experiment with
novel hosts, and to repeatedly reshuffle a common set of
host plants, the building blocks of the host range. It
appears likely that most lineages of plant-feeding insects
pass through such phases of "evolutionary tinkering",
where host use is expanded and diversified [c.f. [46,47]].
Indeed, in order to complete a host shift, a species must
pass through a phase of expanded host range, where both
the ancestral and novel plants are used. The length of this
phase will vary, depending on selection pressure and ecological setting. There are examples where fitness on the
ancestral host has decreased substantially over ecological
time scales [37], but on the other hand, there is evidence
that ancestral hosts can linger in the repertoire for several
tens of millions of years [12,42].
Even if specialization is a pervasive pattern, the process is
not irreversible and occasional episodes of host expansions could conceivably generate the necessary variation
in host use to drive speciation. Expansions during shifts to
novel hosts are also well documented on an ecological
level [37,48,49]. The importance of such host expansions
has probably been neglected because these phases are evolutionarily short-lived and will tend to evolve into more
specialized interactions again over time [12,24], but
despite their ephemeral nature they may play a key role in
the diversification of plant-feeding insects.
Even if the actual "polyphagy event" may be lost in history
due to secondary specialization, the combined present
range of hosts within a taxon should be a relatively accurate reflection of the ancestral host range. Hence, even if
polyphagy is a trait that is difficult to trace on a phylogeny
in itself [12,17,27], we propose that diverse host use

probably eventually evolve towards specialization again,
but populations in different parts of the geographical
range can specialize on different parts of the combined
host range, thus creating a geographic mosaic of more specialized populations [9,51].

Specialization can then promote genetic differentiation
among populations either by assortative mating [10] or by
increasing geographic fragmentation by allopatry [11].
Thus, plant-feeding insects may have reached their
impressive species numbers not by a steady process of specialization and cospeciation, but by dynamic oscillations
of host range.

within a taxon is a good indication of historical widening
of the host plant range. It may be impossible to reconstruct which plant taxa were actual hosts at a given node
in the phylogeny, but it is a fair assumption that an insect
group using more plant taxa in total also has an evolutionary history involving more colonizations and hence more
episodes with wider host plant ranges.
The most likely mechanism by which host expansions can
increase the likelihood of speciation is that they allow the
insect to gain a wider geographic distribution [50] and
thus put it in a situation where genetic fragmentation is
more likely. Obviously, geographic range expansions can
also be caused by colonization of a single plant taxon with
widespread distribution, such as the grasses, but on average the potential geographical range should expand when
the host range increases.
The means by which plant-feeding influences diversification thus involve four interrelated processes: First, the
host range increases through colonization of one or more
novel host plants. Second, the wider host range allows the
species to expand its geographical range and invade new
habitats. Third, as polyphagy appears to be a relatively
ephemeral phase evolutionarily [12], the interaction will

This is a scenario that resembles the old biogeographical
concepts of "taxon cycling" [52] or "taxon pulses" [53,54],
where pulses of speciation are mediated through shifts
between marginal and interior (such as island and mainland) habitats. Our scenario should be compatible with
these models, even though we see no need for a stable
'center of diversification' around which the distributional
ranges fluctuate. At this point, there is no indication of
particular geographical regions that seem to be disproportionately represented in the diversification of nymphalid
butterflies, but this question is certainly worth investigating more thoroughly [c.f. [55,56]]. Furthermore, as a wide
host range often implies both behavioral and physiological plasticity, our scenario should also be compatible with
the general hypothesis of diversification driven by phenotypic plasticity, as described by West-Eberhard [57].
We suggest that it is precisely because host specialization
is not the "dead end" that it has often been interpreted as
that plant-feeding insects have been able to become so
species-rich. In fact, it is quite possible that the same
applies to other diverse and often highly specialized
groups, such as parasitoids and parasites. In the light of
this, there is a need to direct more attention to the circumstances that can reverse the otherwise quite pervasive drive
towards specialization seen in these groups.

Conclusion
We show that diversity in host use within clades is a good
predictor of species richness. As colonizations of novel
plants are typically associated with host expansions such
diversity is likely to have been caused by historical polyphagy [12]. Hence, we propose that much of the diversification of plant-feeding insects is driven by oscillations in
host plant range, where host expansions allow the species
to increase its geographical distribution and thereby setting the stage for subsequent population fragmentation by
secondary specialization on different hosts in the repertoire. This latter stage can either be accomplished by allopatric
isolation
through
increased
geographic
fragmentation [11] or by assortative mating [10].

phalidae by taking the relationships of various clades
directly from studies that focused on those particular relationships, as detailed below. The tree in Fig. 4 represents
our current best estimate of Nymphalidae phylogeny, and
all sister groups in our analyses are well-supported in the
original publications dealing with their relationships.

in host diversity is positively correlated with species richness,
the bars to the right show to what extent contrasts in species richness is positively correlated with host diversity.
When selecting sister groups on the basis of differences in
host plant diversity the correlation was more pronounced
than when using species richness as the basis for sister group
selection. The different outcome of the two methods of sister pair selection suggests that while increases in species
richness is not necessarily followed by higher host diversity,
increased host diversity is predictably followed by increased
species richness.

Methods
Phylogeny
A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of all 548 genera
belonging to Nymphalidae has yet to be published. However, the relationships of various subgroups in Nymphalidae have been studied by a number of people using
diverse methodology, including morphological and
molecular data. The phylogeny used in this study was
compiled from various sources and represents our current
understanding of the phylogeny of 309 genera of Nymphalidae, not including the subfamily Satyrinae (Fig. 4).
The subfamily Satyrinae contains 239 genera and about 1/
3 of all nymphalid species, but was treated as a single terminal taxon in this study, as it shows little variation in
host use. It is not possible at this point in time to construct
a supermatrix for analysis, as the datasets used by various
people are largely non-overlapping in both characters and
taxa. A supertree approach is not advisable based on
recent work [58]. Thus we constructed the tree for Nym-

Uncertainties in relationships are shown as polytomies in
Fig. 4. The deeper nodes of the phylogeny are based on
molecular data from 3 gene regions, the mitochondrial
COI and the nuclear EF-1α and wingless, for a total of
2929 bp [59]. The study by Wahlberg et al. [59] identified
4 major clades in Nymphalidae: the danaine clade which
includes the subfamily Danainae; the satyrine clade
including Calinaginae, Charaxinae, Satyrinae and Morphinae; the heliconiiine clade including Heliconiinae and
Limenitidinae; and the nymphaline clade including Nymphalinae, Cyrestinae, Biblidinae and Apaturinae. These
major clades are also recovered in a broader study on butterflies and skippers [60], which also shows that the
libytheines belong in the family Nymphalidae. Relationships of species in the subfamily Libytheinae have been
studied using morphological data showing that the genera
Libythea and Libytheana are monophyletic and each others
sister groups [61].
Relationships with Danainae have been extensively studied using both morphological and molecular data. Species
in the tribe Danaini (the milkweed butterflies) are the
subject of a book [62] in which detailed morphological
data were cladistically analyzed. All genera were found to
form monophyletic entities. Relationships within the species rich tribe Ithomiini have been studied using morphological [63] and molecular [64] data. The molecular
analysis was based on the same genes mentioned above.
Relationships within the satyrine clade have been poorly
studied, even though the clade contains the most species
in Nymphalidae. The relationships of Morpho and related
genera are taken from a morphological study [65] and a
molecular study based on one gene, wingless [66]. The
position of Bia as sister to the rest of Brassolini is suggested by a morphological study [67] and is being confirmed by a molecular study based on COI, EF-1α and
wingless genes [68]. The genera Charaxes and Polyura have
always been considered to be related to each other [69]
and this relationship is being confirmed with molecular
data from the three genes mentioned previously (N.
Wahlberg, unpublished data).
Relationships within the heliconiine clade have been
much studied, especially in the subfamily Heliconiinae.
These studies are based on both morphological [70-72]
and molecular [73,74] data, and one study [75] combined
both kinds of data.

Relationships in Limenitidinae have been less studied
[76], and thus the phylogeny in Fig. 4 is largely unresolved
for the subfamily. The sister relationship of Harma and
Cymothoe is considered to be clear [77,78] and is being
confirmed by molecular data from COI, EF-1α and wingless (N. Wahlberg, unpublished).
Relationships in the nymphaline clade are being cleared
up presently. A very recent study on the subfamily Nymphalinae based on molecular data from COI, EF-1α and
wingless [79] has resolved the phylogenetic relationships
of almost all genera (hence the strong representation of
this subfamily in the current study). Detailed studies on
several subgroups within Nymphalinae have also been
used in Fig. 4, the tribe Nymphalini was studied using a
combined morphological and molecular dataset with four
genes [80]. The other subfamilies in the nymphaline clade
have not been studied in detail. The sister relationship of
Cyrestis and Chersonesia was established in a morphological study [81] and is being confirmed by molecular data
[79]. A few studies have used morphological data in the
subfamily Biblidinae to look at relationships at the species
level [82,83].
Data collection
Data on host plant associations were collected from various literature sources on the level of plant family and
order [62,67,77,78,84-101], following the nomenclature

of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group [102]. An index of
host diversity was created by multiplying the number of
plant families with the number of plant orders used by
each butterfly genus. This allowed us to take variation into
account on two levels of resolution, i.e. a butterfly genus
utilizing two families in the same order will have a lower
host diversity than a butterfly utilizing two families from
two different orders. Butterfly species numbers were taken
from various sources as detailed in Wahlberg [103]. We
were able to find data on host plant use as well as species
numbers for 292 genera in the family Nymphalidae.
While butterflies are unparalleled among insects in terms
of availability of host plant data, much due to the great
general interest this group holds by amateur collectors as
well as the general public, there are sometimes problems
with the reliability of the data. The level of detail in host
records vary substantially, which makes it difficult to use
more fine-grained measures of host range than plant families. The largest problem is probably that anecdotal and
erroneous records will tend to spread and multiply in the
literature, and these can decrease the phylogenetic signal
in the data [27,84]. To limit this problem, we have followed a set of evaluation rules adopted from Janz & Nylin
[27], where a host plant association was only included if
it was a) reported by at least two independent sources, b)
recorded from more than one species in the genus, c) if
there were records of more than one plant genus from the
same host plant family, or d) if the plant was the only

recorded host for the genus. Because of the way that atypical information tends to gain undue attention, we believe
that the risk we hereby run of erroneously excluding some
data that are correct is outweighed by the advantage of
excluding a greater number of records that are incorrect.
Analyses
Data were analyzed with the MacroCAIC computer program [45], which applies the method of independent contrasts [104] to questions of species richness, as well as by
reciprocal sister-group comparisons. MacroCAIC generates phylogenetically independent contrasts across the
whole phylogeny. By taking all available data into account
the number of contrasts found will be much higher than
when manually searching for valid sister group comparisons, but by using reciprocal selection rules for sister
group selection it is possible to evaluate the causal relationships behind a correlation.

As our data were strongly skewed (most butterflies are specialists) we were not able to use a parametric regression on
the contrasts generated by MacroCAIC. Instead we performed a Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test on the
direction of the contrasts, which is also more conservative
and more comparable with the sister group comparisons.

This test answers the question of whether positive contrasts in one variable (diversity of host use) are associated
with positive contrasts in the other variable (species richness).
Sister groups were selected using two reciprocal selection
rules (Fig. 1). First, by recursively searching down the butterfly phylogeny for the first sister pair that differed in
diversity of host use. At that point we stopped, excluding
all nodes below it in the phylogeny (so as to ensure independent comparisons). We then continued in the same
manner across the whole phylogeny until all possible
independent sister groups were found (Table 1). Second,
we used the same method to instead search for clades that
differed in species numbers (Table 2). This reciprocity
allowed us to evaluate our hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis that species rich clades are expected to
have more hosts by chance alone. Valid comparisons of
both types were analyzed with sign tests for finding correlated differences in host diversity and species richness.
Provided that there is an overall correlation, in many
(most) cases, the sister group contrasts found with the two
methods will be identical. However, as long as the correlation is not perfect, there will be cases where a difference
in one character is not followed by a difference in the

other. If these discrepancies from a perfect correlation are
disproportionately found in one of the sister group comparisons, they can provide insight into the causation
behind the correlation. For example, we may find a large
number of contrasts in species richness that is not associated with positive contrasts in host diversity, but few cases
of the reciprocal discrepancy (where a contrast in host
diversity is not associated with a positive contrast in species richness). This means that differences in species richness sometimes evolve for reasons not associated with
host diversity, but when there is a difference in host diversity, it is predictably followed by an increase in species
richness. Conversely, the opposite pattern would mean
that host diversity often evolves without a corresponding
increase in species richness, but when there are differences
in species richness, it is predictably followed by an
increase in host diversity. In the first case we would conclude that, even though host diversity cannot be the only
factor that influences patterns of species richness, when
we do have an increase in host diversity, it seems to trigger
an increase in species richness. In the second case we
would conclude that, even though species richness cannot
be the only factor that influences patterns of host diversity, when we do have an increase in species richness, it
seems to trigger an increase in host diversity.

information on the phylogenetic reconstruction and the
sources used). It is resolved to the genus level, with the
exception for the subfamily Satyrinae, which, due to little variation in host use, were counted as one contrast in the analysis.
