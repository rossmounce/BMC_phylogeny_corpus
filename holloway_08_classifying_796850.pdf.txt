Abstract
Background: An important goal in post-genomic research is discovering the network of interactions between
transcription factors (TFs) and the genes they regulate. We have previously reported the development of a
supervised-learning approach to TF target identification, and used it to predict targets of 104 transcription factors
in yeast. We now include a new sequence conservation measure, expand our predictions to include 59 new TFs,
introduce a web-server, and implement an improved ranking method to reveal the biological features contributing
to regulation. The classifiers combine 8 genomic datasets covering a broad range of measurements including
sequence conservation, sequence overrepresentation, gene expression, and DNA structural properties.
Principal Findings: (1) Application of the method yields an amplification of information about yeast regulators.
The ratio of total targets to previously known targets is greater than 2 for 11 TFs, with several having larger gains:
Ash1(4), Ino2(2.6), Yaf1(2.4), and Yap6(2.4).
(2) Many predicted targets for TFs match well with the known biology of their regulators. As a case study we
discuss the regulator Swi6, presenting evidence that it may be important in the DNA damage response, and that
the previously uncharacterized gene YMR279C plays a role in DNA damage response and perhaps in cell-cycle
progression.
(3) A procedure based on recursive-feature-elimination is able to uncover from the large initial data sets those
features that best distinguish targets for any TF, providing clues relevant to its biology. An analysis of Swi6 suggests
a possible role in lipid metabolism, and more specifically in metabolism of ceramide, a bioactive lipid currently
being investigated for anti-cancer properties.
(4) An analysis of global network properties highlights the transcriptional network hubs; the factors which control
the most genes and the genes which are bound by the largest set of regulators. Cell-cycle and growth related
regulators dominate the former; genes involved in carbon metabolism and energy generation dominate the latter.
Conclusion: Postprocessing of regulatory-classifier results can provide high quality predictions, and feature
ranking strategies can deliver insight into the regulatory functions of TFs. Predictions are available at an online
web-server, including the full transcriptional network, which can be analyzed using VisAnt network analysis suite.

Introduction
Many factors influence the regulation of genes and their
protein products within the cell. Chromatin condensation, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation/methylation can affect the accessibility of a gene's cis-regulatory
sites to trans-acting factors. On the RNA level, mRNA
splicing, mRNA editing, microRNA silencing, and RNA
degradation can all affect the ability or efficiency of translating mRNA into active protein [1]. Nevertheless, the primary mode of regulatory control is the association of
transcription factors with their target binding sites in
DNA. These binding sites occur most often in promoter
regions, the stretch of DNA upstream of the transcription
start site. The string of nucleotides bound by a particular
TF is not identical at every recognized site. Instead, the TF
distinguishes a flexible motif, or shared pattern of bases
[2,3].
Founding work in discovering and representing binding
sites involved the use of position specific scoring matrices
(PSSMs) [2-5], which represent the frequency of nucleotide bases at each position in a known motif. Many techniques for discovering and predicting binding sites have
been reported [6-13], and an evaluation of the state of the
art in unsupervised motif-discovery methods is available
[14]. Despite their broad usefulness, detection by PSSM is
beset by a high rate of false positive predictions. Some TF
matrices can produce predictions at a frequency of 1 in
every 500 bp [15]. Often, there is not enough information
to construct high quality matrices.
To improve the prediction of which promoters are bound
(i.e., the target promoters), more sophisticated machine
learning approaches can be used. Supervised learning
schemes begin with more information and seek to generate classification rules based on a user-provided set of positive and negative examples. In our case, a rule can be
learned based on provided training data, and it can be
applied to the whole genome to predict new targets of a
specific TF. Some work has been published on supervised
classification schemes for predicting TF binding targets,
and we have briefly reviewed a few of these in our previous work [16,17], which focused on developing and
applying a support vector machine [18,19] variant to predict transcription factor binding sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We now expand that work to include a total of 163
TFs, revise our machine learning strategy to be more
robust, and construct and analyze the gene regulatory network in S. cerevisiae. All predictions are now available
online, including the full transcriptional network, which
can be analyzed in the VisAnt browser [20,21].
Genomic datasets have high dimensionality, meaning
that for each example gene there may be thousands or tens
of thousands of numerical features to describe it. One

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/22

example is expression microarray data. If the expression of
a gene is tested under 200 experimental conditions (i.e.,
200 microarrays) then the gene is described by a 200
dimensional vector, each element being the expression
under a single condition. Many classification algorithms,
e.g., k-nearest-neighbors or neural networks, may degrade
in performance as the number of features becomes large
unless selection criteria are used to drastically reduce the
size of the feature space. Support vector machines perform
well with high dimensional data and have been shown to
provide excellent classification accuracy with many
genomic datasets (see Methods).
We take our positive set from known TF binding sites published in the literature (see Methods) [22-25]. Negatives
are a randomly chosen subset of those genes found not to
be bound by a TF in ChIP-chip experiments ("not bound
" refers to the large group of genes with the highest p-values and thus least significant binding). A schematic representation of the classification workflow is presented in
Figure 1; a full description of classifier construction and
validation is given in Methods.
An SVM classifier is constructed for each TF based on a
chosen set of biological features. These features (described
in Methods) comprise a diverse set of data including promoter sequence composition, gene expression measurements, phylogenetic conservation of sequence elements,
over-representation of promoter sequences, promoter
melting temperature, and others. Choosing a negative
training set (i.e., examples of genes not regulated by the
TF) for such a classification is difficult as there is no way
to determine which genes are truly not bound by the TF.
To establish a pool of potential negatives, for each TF we
select 600 genes shown as least likely to be bound by
ChIP-chip experiments, always assuring that the negative
pool is at least three times the size of the positive set. Once
a negative pool is chosen, 50 classifiers are constructed for
each TF using different random subsamples from the negative pool. Since the negative pool is expected to be noisy,
the repeat sampling assures that no single, biased gene
group dominates the classifier.
When the negative sets are chosen, they are sampled to be
of equal size to the positive sets. This is done since the
underlying distributions of positives and negatives are
unknown and may vary greatly depending on the TF being
studied. Other researchers have also employed such balanced training sets when making classifiers [26]. As discussed below, this has several important consequences for
how classifier evaluation measures are interpreted.
Each classifier for a TF is evaluated using a leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV) approach, and the reported
performance measures (accuracy, and positive predictive

Figure 1
SVM Framework
SVM Framework. This figure shows the data mining scheme for making TF classifiers. 50 classifiers are constructed for each
TF, each using a different random sub-sample of the negative set. First, on the far left, the negative pool for a TF is under-sampled so that it is the same size as the positive set. A classifier built on the training set is evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation (this is shown as a split into train and test sets). For every cross-validation split, the top 1500 features are selected using
SVM-RFE (center solid box) and the classifier is trained and finally used to classify the test set. This process is repeated 50
times, and the accuracy for the procedure is the average of the 50 cross-validation accuracies. To classify a potential new target
for a TF, all 50 classifiers are applied to the gene's feature vector, and an enrichment score is calculated as discussed in Methods. A score greater than 0.5 indicates a positive classification (an average score greater than 0.95 is used to predict new targets).

value) are the average measurements over all 50 classifiers. Because training sets are balanced an average positive
predictive value of 50% is a baseline score which indicates
a random classifier. Thus, the average cross-validation
measurements are used to determine which TF classifiers
can make useful predictions (i.e., better than expected by
chance).
Post processing is also an important component of transcription factor target prediction. When applied to the
entire genome a classifier may work well in finding a set
of genes enriched with targets for a regulator, but the set
will likely contain too many false positives to be used
directly in future analyses. In order to select the best targets, Platt's procedure [27] is used to rank all new predictions. The scores given by Platt's method range from 0 to
1, and are intended to be interpreted (within the training

set) as probabilities of any gene being a true positive.
Once again, though this is a correct interpretation in the
training set, it may result in overly optimistic probability
estimates when applied genome-wide. Thus, we use the
Platt scores only as a means to rank new predictions, and
apply a high cutoff Platt score of 0.95 to identify new predictions for a regulator. Any new prediction must equal or
exceed the 0.95 cutoff on average across all 50 classifiers for a
TF. This restriction will further reduce the number of false
positives in our final prediction sets since it is less likely
that non-target genes will on the average pass such a high
cutoff in 50 classifiers trained with different negative sets.
Note here that the 0.95 cutoff is used only for selecting
new targets, while the baseline threshold of 0.5 is used
when performing LOOCV and evaluating whether a classifier performs better than random. Thus we note that
these Platt scores may be interpreted as confidence levels,

and that they are correct for selecting targets from balanced datasets used in SVM training and testing. A correction is needed in order to transform these confidence
levels to ones which are appropriate to determination of
targets from the full genome, in which the number of negatives can outnumber the number of positives by a large
factor.
Although we use and report the uncorrected Platt scores
here simply as a means to show enrichment for targets we
provide, in our Methods section, the calculations necessary to correct these scores to the genomic scale.
Several things set the current work apart from our previous approaches, and allow us to draw biological conclusions that could not otherwise be obtained. Rather than
using all features to make a classifier we apply recursive
feature elimination to select those that are most relevant.
Later the rankings are accumulated across all 50 classifiers
(made from resampling the negative set) for a TF to establish a final ranking for each feature. We are thereby able to
identify the specific biological attributes which are most
useful for separating target genes from non-targets. The
simultaneous ranking of all features and identification of
those few with dominant relevance allows us to easily discover important biological aspects of regulation. Also, several of our methods have been improved. We introduce a
new dataset of k-mer counts weighted by their conservation in alignments with sequences from closely related
species.
We apply our formalism to the identification of targets for
163 of the ~200 S. cerevisiae TFs – these being the regulators with 4 or more established targets – and delineate the
repertoire of networks formed by the resulting associations. An analysis of global network properties highlights
the transcriptional network hubs; the factors which control the most genes and the genes which are bound by the
largest set of regulators. Cell cycle and growth related regulators tend to dominate the former; genes involved in
carbon metabolism and energy generation tend to dominate the latter. We use the ubiquitous cell cycle regulator
Swi6 as a case study to illustrate the level of insight that
can be obtained from a detailed analysis of results. Predictions can be downloaded from a publicly available web
server, and the implied networks mined, visualized and
analyzed using the VisAnt tool.

Results and Discussion
Network Visualization and Analysis
As discussed in Methods below, classifier performance is
measured using leave-one-out cross-validation. Since 50
classifiers are trained for each TF each using a different
randomly chosen negative set, the reported accuracy is an
average over 50 trials. The cross-validation accuracy in

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/22

training sets for all binding targets (over all classifiers) is
76%. New predictions are the result of averaging the
assigned Platt scores from each of the 50 classifiers for a
TF and applying a threshold of 0.95.
We note here that the resulting predictions indicate the
association of TF and promoter DNA, which is the quantity being measured in ChIP-chip studies. As such, with a
binding prediction one cannot necessarily conclude that
the bound TF drives expression of the target gene in vivo,
meaning that the rate of biological false positives will need
to be determined later in the context of specific experimental conditions.
One of the origins of network structure is combinatorial
regulation; i.e. single TFs often regulate more than one target, and particular targets are often regulated by more than
one TF. Networks can be inferred using a combination of
experimental and computational methods and displayed
as a repertoire of connections (the cell's network repertoire), different subsets of which are selected by particular
environments. The repertoire is available at the VisAnt
[20,21] website and can be accessed in the methods table
as "TFSVM." Visualization in VisAnt allows predictions to
be integrated with many other large scale genomic datasets including protein-protein interaction, gene expression, GO functional annotation, and genetic interaction.
VisAnt also allows adjustment of the network based on a
user-defined likelihood threshold for accepting an association. Thus predictions can be embedded in networks
mined at any specified degree of stringency for further
analysis.
The full set of predictions for 163 TFs in S. cerevisiae are
available our webserver [28]. Users may query either a
transcription factor, returning the list of predicted targets,
or a gene, returning a list of possible regulators. The Platt
scores may also be set by the user, providing an adjustable
threshold on the predictions for each TF. In addition, the
cross-validated accuracies for all classifiers have been
posted online, as well as the top 50 ranked features for
each TF-classifier.
Global Network Properties
In any regulatory network it is of interest to know which
genes are most heavily under transcriptional control, and
which TFs exert the most control by regulating large numbers of genes. When analyzing global network properties,
we limit our analysis to high quality predictions by
including only TFs that have a leave-one-out cross-validated classification accuracy greater than 0.6 (there are
130 such TFs), and targets that have a Platt score ≥ 0.95.

The resulting network includes a large number of genes
that are under strong regulatory control. In particular 125

Biology Direct 2008, 3:22

genes are regulated by 12 or more transcription factors.
These genes show statistical enrichment (p ≤ 0.05) in several GO biological process categories. The enriched categories are mainly involved in carbon metabolism and
energy generation (see Additional File 1), which are crucial functions expected to be under tight control. Other
important processes include DNA damage checkpoint,
DNA recombination, DNA damage response, acetyl-CoA
catabolism, NADP(H) metabolism, and telomere maintenance. With respect to breadth of control, 13 TFs regulate
more than 300 genes (known + predicted) each at high
Platt score cutoffs (P ≥ 0.95). This set of TFs includes the
pervasive regulators Abf1 and Reb1, as well as TFs
involved in the cell cycle, growth, and the stress response
(see Additional File 2).
Local Structure: Swi6 Case Study
Our results include a large number of subnetworks. As an
example we consider known and predicted targets of the
cell cycle regulator Swi6, subsets of which (18 out of 142,
and 15 out of 138, respectively) are shown in Figure 2. The
average cross-validated prediction accuracy in training sets
is 83%. The new predictions are highly connected to
known targets by a variety of the experimental and computational methods which are available for download in
the VisAnt system. Both gene groups in Figure 2 contain
cell cycle genes, and the most common connection is phylogenetic profiling, suggesting considerable functional
similarity. The network perspective supports the prediction of common regulation of these highly interacting
genes, and makes it easier to formulate testable hypotheses about the relationships of regulatory targets.

Among the new targets of Swi6 is YLR176C (Rfx1), which
codes for a transcription factor that is predicted to regulate
a previously known Swi6 target, YMR279C. This arrangement is a feedforward loop, suggesting that YMR279C is
under combinatorial control by these two factors (Figure
2a). It should be noted that although our method independently predicts that Rfx1 is a regulator of YMR279C,
Rfx1 was reported to bind the promoter of YMR279C in
an early ChIP-chip study [29]. An updated analysis of
those results by the same group removed YMR279C from
the dataset (can be downloaded from [30]), and a subsequent ChIP-chip experiment did not show significant regulation [22]. Due to this ambiguity the Rfx1-YMR279C
interaction is not in our positive set; nonetheless, it is predicted by the classifier for Rfx1.
Rfx1 is a repressor involved in the cell-cycle DNA damage
checkpoint. Inactivation of Rfx1 occurs in response to
DNA damage and causes the induction of many genes
[31] (by release of repression by Rfx1). In addition to our
prediction that Rfx1 is regulated by Swi6, an analysis of
the expression of the two TFs during the alpha-factor

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/22

arrested cell cycle time course [32] shows that their transcripts are correlated. Figure 3 shows the expression of
Swi6, Rfx1, and two reference genes which show expression peaks in G1 and S-phase. Across the 18 experiments
in the time course, which spans 2 cell cycles, the two factors show a correlation coefficient of 0.6.
Since Swi6 is known to be important for the G1/S transition, the expression in these specific experiments was
examined more closely (noted in Figure 3). Using prototypical G1 and S phase reference genes, eight time points
spanning the peak of G1 through the peak of S phase were
selected. In these eight experiments Swi6 and Rfx1 show a
stronger correlation of 0.73, which is statistically significant at p = 0.04. Interestingly, Swi6 may bind several genes
in the DNA damage response pathway including Dun1
(known), Rad53 (new, P = 0.96), and Mec1 (potential target, P = 0.76). These targets are kinases known to phosphorylate and thereby activate Rfx1 in the DNA damage
response pathway [31].
Finally, it has been shown that the kinase Rad53 phosphorylates Swi6, delaying progression of the cell cycle into
S-phase [33]. The ultimate target of the new feed forward
loop is YMR279C, which is an uncharacterized gene
showing sequence similarity to membrane transport proteins. This gene shows a 9-fold induction in response to
DNA damage [34,35]. Taken together, this evidence suggests that Swi6 is involved in the DNA damage response at
the end of G1, and that YMR279C plays a role in DNA
damage response and perhaps in cell cycle progression.
Deletion mutants of YMR279C are viable [36] but it is not
known how this deletion affects the cell cycle or DNA
damage response. Examining these mutants for deficiencies in growth and DNA damage response may shed some
light on the true function of YMR279C. Detailed experiments including reporter assays would be needed to determine how closely interlinked Swi6, Rfx1, and YMR279C
are on the transcriptional level. As a working hypothesis,
it appears that Swi6 is available to activate DNA damage
response genes such as Rfx1, ensuring they are present at
crucial times in the cell cycle. Normally Rfx1 is repressing
its targets and YMR279C will not be activated. In times of
DNA damage Rfx1 is inactivated by a phosphorylation
[31] allowing response genes to be induced by Swi6 and
resulting in cell cycle arrest. The prediction of Swi6 binding to the Rfx1 promoter may not be of much consequence, perhaps activating Rfx1 to insure its presence
during G1/S-phase. YMR279C is already known to be
bound by Swi6, so the prediction that Rfx1 also binds is
significant, suggesting that YMR279C will be repressed by
Rfx1 until DNA damage releases it to be activated, possibly by Swi6 during the critical G1/S checkpoint.

the network. The types of data used in network construction are indicated. The VisAnt toolkit [20, 21] shows links which
come from many publications. Any particular type of link (e.g., protein-protein interaction) may represent a collection of data
from several genomic datasets. Each link type is referred to in VisAnt as a "method" and each method has a unique identifier.
The method IDs for the link types here include: M0037(phylogenetic profile), M0013(copurification), M0040(screened yeast-2hybrid), M0031(other biophysical), M0046(Bayesian Predicted Interaction), M0045(affinity chromatography). Complete references and datasets are available in the VisAnt suite accessible from the website [73]. The graph is presented to show that predicted targets of Swi6 are highly interconnected to the known targets by a variety of methods, indicating possible functional
relationships or physical interactions. The insert panel "a" shows and up-close schematic of the transcriptional feed-forward
loop between Swi6, Rfx1, and YMR279C. Given the known functions of Rfx1, it is likely that Rfx1 represses the YMR279C
gene.

Prediction Analysis and Feature Rank: More on Swi6
In order to examine the regulatory implications of our
model, Swi6 is again used as an example. First, the functional enrichment of Swi6 targets is examined. Swi6 interacts with Mbp1 and Swi4 during the cell cycle (G1/S
transition) and in meiosis [37,38]. The known targets of
Swi6 and the new predictions (throughout the range of

Platt scores P > 0.5 → P > 0.95) are significantly enriched
(p < 0.05) in the expected GO biological processes including cell cycle, regulation of cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle,
DNA repair, etc. Some of the new categories for which targets at P > 0.95 show enrichment include chromatin
assembly/disassembly (p = 1e-10), septin checkpoint (p =
2.7e-3), and lipid metabolism (p = 8.4e-4). These new tar-

gets fit with the current knowledge about Swi6 regulation
and suggest possible new roles of action.
As described in Methods, the features for each classifier are
ranked using an expanded variation of the basic SVM-RFE
(Support Vector Machine – Recursive Feature Elimination) algorithm [39]. Ranked features can be used to
reveal interesting biological aspects of regulation and suggest directions for future experiments. Only a relatively
small number of features show the highest discriminative
ability and consistency across many subsamples of the
training set (Figure 4). The first 10 features in Figure 4
have a high rank in more than 65% of the resamplings
while the remaining features fall off sharply in reliability.
The top ranked features for each transcription factor are
available on our website (features listed in order of
decreasing importance).
The most important feature for identifying known targets
of Swi6 is a microarray experiment measuring expression
of genes in an Mbp1 deletion mutant. This makes sense
since Swi6/Mbp1 interact and function as coactivators at
many promoters [37]. By t-test the observed expression
change is significant between the negative set and the
known positives (p = 3.7e-25), and between the negative
set and the genes at P = 0.95 (p = 9.14e-27, 280 genesknown and new).

Figure 4
Swi6 Feature Ranking
Swi6 Feature Ranking. A feature ranking is created on
every training set during cross validation of a classifier. Since
50 classifiers are made for every TF, this results in hundreds
of separate rankings (50 * #Training Points). This plot shows
the frequency with which a feature shows up in the group of
top 40 features. When sorted by this frequency, only the
most important features remain at the top of the list. For
Swi6 the first 10 features are in the top-40 of 60% of the
rankings, making them consistently chosen over many resamplings of the negative set.

The next several highest ranked features identify the k-mer
ACGCG/CGCGT as being important for classification by
conservation and overrepresentation (features ranked 2–
4, 7, and 9 indicate this k-mer). The k-mer overlaps highly
with known binding sites for Swi6; for example, Swi6
binds CGCGAAA in the Cln2 promoter [24]. The overrepresentation of this sequence in the positive training set can
be seen by examining the calculated significance values
[40], which are the scores used to determine the statistical
importance of each k-mer (see Methods). Viewing this
score in the negative set genes as compared to the positives is informative, and Figure 5 plots the distribution of
significance scores in the genes of the negative set, positive
set, and the predicted targets at Platt scores P > 0.95. The
graph was generated by placing the genes in each set (i.e.,
positive, negative, and predicted) into 5 equally spaced
bins based on significance score. The known and predicted targets clearly show enrichment of ACGCG as compared to the negative genes.
The conservation of ACGCG is ranked more highly than
overrepresentation, indicating that this sequence is preserved in promoter alignments which include 7 Saccharomyces species. Figure 6a shows such an alignment in the
promoter region of the Isc1 gene, a newly predicted target

(ii) positive set promoters in violet, (iii) predicted targets at P
≥ 0.95. For each category, genes are grouped into 5 equally
spaced bins based on the E-value of overrepresentation of
ACGCG. The center locations of those bins are plotted on
the x axis and the number of genes in each bin is on the y
axis. Positive and predicted target promoters of Swi6 show
higher overrepresentation of ACGCG than negative set

of Swi6 (Figure 6b shows a similar alignment in the Sur2
promoter). Two occurrences (highlighted in red) of the
indicated k-mer appear in close proximity in a highly conserved segment of the Isc1 promoter. The conservation
scores in Figure 6 are the output of the PhastCons algorithm [41] and are pre-calculated on the UCSC Genome
Browser website (see Methods). The sequences flanking
the k-mer in Figure 6 also show strong conservation. The
SVM model does not indicate the position or which specific instances of ACGCG are conserved, but only that the
k-mer occurs more often in conserved regions in bound
promoters as opposed to non-bound promoters. This
knowledge can be useful, as seen in Isc1, for narrowing
down the specific sequences which may be bound.
Isc1 is an important gene since it is the only member of
the sphingomyelinase (SMase) gene family present in the
yeast genome. These SMases are responsible for generating ceramides, which are bioactive lipids known to modulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth,
apoptosis, and the cell cycle in yeast [42]. They also contain a newly discovered P-loop-like domain, which is conserved in the gene family from yeast to humans [43]. Isc1
is the closest yeast homolog to the human SMase2 gene
and has thus become the model for exploring the functions of SMase genes in general.
Isc1 has been implicated in general cell growth [42], fermentative growth, and sexual reproduction [44]. Recent
experiments in human and mouse models have demonstrated ceramide enhanced cancer cell death, indicating
that ceramide could act synergistically with other chemotherapeutic agents [45]. Indeed, several therapeutic compounds are currently under development which modulate
ceramide metabolism. The prediction that Isc1 is regulated by Swi6 (Mbp1) is interesting since it provides a
direct link between cell cycle regulation and the generation of bioactive lipids via the hydrolytic pathway. Further
investigation will be necessary to determine the biological
validity of this link and whether the human ortholog,
SMase2, shows a similar connection to the cell cycle. It is
possible that ceramide production via SMase2 could serve
as a target for anti-cancer therapy which can be easily studied in yeast models.
Because predicted targets of Swi6 include SMase and are
enriched in genes functioning in cellular lipid metabolism, Swi6 may have a greater role than previously appreciated
in controlling lipid metabolism and its coupling to cell growth,
apoptosis, and reproduction.
Additional Examples of Feature Ranking
As a further example of the usefulness of SVMs coupled to
our feature ranking method, we briefly explore the TFs
Gzf3 (YJL110C), and Ash1 (YKL185W). The feature rank-

ing for the factor Gzf3 (YJL110C) indicates that the melting temperature at window positions -274 to -286 (see
Methods) in target promoter regions is different than that
in non-target promoters. Figure 7 shows a plot of the average melting temperature in sets of yeast promoters averaged within a moving 20 bp window. Known targets
clearly have a reduced melting temperature at the identified positions as compared to negative set or average
genes. The relationship is also present in the targets which
show a Platt score > 0.95 (known and new). This group
contains 72 targets, 27 of which are new predictions.
Although it is unclear how the melting temperature and
helix stability in this region affects regulation by Gzf3, it is
possible that Gzf3 or other factors induce changes in DNA
compaction or stability which alter regulation at these
promoters. Binding sites of Gzf3 do not appear to be concentrated in the affected region, possibly implicating the
activity of other factors at this site. In any case, feature
ranking has identified specific nucleotide positions which
can be tested experimentally for their role in transcriptional regulation.
The classifier for Ash1 has an average (cross validation)
prediction accuracy of 88%. The most predictive feature is
gene expression in She4 deletion mutants. Expression in

temperature than the average or negative set gene. SVM feature ranking correctly identifies the window positions in
which the target melting temperature is most unlike that for
negative genes, suggesting altered promoter structure of the
targets, which is conserved at positions -286 to -274.

these mutants of known targets and genes at P = 0.95 is
significantly different than in the negative set (p = 5.4e-15
and p = 6.5e-8 respectively). This gene expression difference in She4 mutants is consistent with known biology
since several She genes are responsible for controlling the
localization, and hence appropriate regulation, of Ash1
[46-48].
General Results and Comparison with Other Methods
As mentioned previously the cross-validation accuracy in
training sets for detecting yeast binding sites (over all classifiers) is 76%. An obvious question relevant to validation
is how noise in ChIP-chip data (false positives) affects
assessment of the method. There are several sources of a
noise. One is that the TF of interest does not contact DNA
directly but interacts with a second factor which binds to
the promoter. In principle this does not affect our results
since the SVMs are searching for TF-promoter associations, not for specific binding sites. Other types of noise
that affect allocation are more fundamental. If we consider a worst-case scenario in which the ChIP-chip targets
for a regulator are near-random or too noisy, the SVM
classifiers will also perform no better than random and, as
we show below, our system will produce no new predictions for the TF (at the 0.95 threshold). Finally, it is
important to distinguish promoter binding from transcriptional activity. Like ChIP-chip data itself, the method
is determining binding rather than biological activity, the
latter being inferred from a positive binding prediction.
Because of the very low false positive binding rate, and
because many predictions are functionally consistent with
the biology of known targets we expect that the predictions made by SVM are biologically relevant.
Bayesian target determination
Beyer et al. [49] use a Bayesian framework to predict binding sites with a single unified training set of positives and
negatives incorporating all TFs and targets. They use only
high confidence, low-throughput binding targets as positive examples of regulation. The approach raises an interesting question regarding the trade-off between a possible
disadvantage in using less prior information on the one
hand, and the advantage of uniformly high quality targets
on the other.

By revisiting the predictions of Beyer et al. [49] we find
112 TFs which are common to both their analysis and
ours. There are 5156 predictions made by the Bayesian
system for these factors. According to their model, which
uses log-likelihood scores to assess the contributions of
different data sources, 980 predictions are reported to
have no ChIP-chip binding support. However, if only the
ChIP-chip targets passing the p ≤ 0.001 threshold (used by
our study and [22,29]) are filtered from their total set of
predictions, there are 2323 predictions made by Beyer et

Page 10 of 20

al. which were not designated as known positives by our
method. In any case, ChIP-chip data was the dominant
feature in their prediction system. Out of the 2323 new
predictions, 1314 (56%) are also classified as positives by
SVM at P > 0.5, while only 213 (~9%) also meet the more
stringent P ≥ 0.95 cutoff. It is not surprising that the overlap at high stringency is small considering that both methods use different types of data and completely different
learning schemes. Since they are both designed to choose
high-confidence targets using different datasets, they may
each be predicting only a small (or different) portion of
the true transcriptional regulatory network.
Randomized Controls
Here we compare TF-target classifiers to randomized data
for several transcription factors. As with the actual classifiers, predictions for a randomized control must pass the
0.95 threshold across 50 separate classifiers. To illustrate
the stringency implied by this requirement, the prediction
procedure was implemented for three control TFs chosen
according to the number of available targets (Dat1 –
small, 17 targets, Yap5 – medium,72 targets, Swi6 – large,
142 targets). For each factor, the positive and negative
training labels were shuffled (over all 50 random negative
sets), and classifiers were built and applied to the genome.
In all cases the shuffled classifiers made no predictions
which passed the 0.95 threshold. Leave-one-out cross validation was also performed to determine whether the
accuracy and PPV of the actual classifiers was significantly
different than random. In all cases the Accuracy and PPV
were significantly better than random with p-values less
than 10-28. This can be seen for PPV in Figure 8, which
gives box-plots of the PPVs of actual and random classifiers for the three TFs mentioned. Because these are
notched-box-plots, the medians of two populations may
be considered significantly different (with 95% confidence) if the notches on the boxes do not overlap.

Figure 8
Actual vs. Shuffled Classifiers Box-plots
Actual vs. Shuffled Classifiers Box-plots. Because 50
classifiers represent each TF, cross-validation of each classifier produces a population of PPV measurements for each TF.
These populations may be used to compare the significance
of the actual vs. the label-shuffled classifiers (denoted with
the prefix "Rand"). Here the comparison is shown for Dat1,
Swi6, and Yap5 using box-and-whisker plots. The red line in
each box represents a median value, and the top and bottom
lines of the box represent upper and lower quartile values. If
the notches on adjacent boxes do not overlap, then the population medians are considered different at 95% confidence.
The whisker length is default for Matlab and is a maximum
length of "1.5 times the interquartile range" [74]. The plus (+)
signs represent possible outliers existing beyond this range.
In each instance the real-data classifiers perform significantly
better than the label-shuffled classifiers.
ods whereas our procedure combines many types of heterogeneous datasets.

Conclusion
Other Supervised Methods
Few other supervised approaches to target classification
exist. One group [50] has applied SVMs to target detection
using only gene expression data. The restriction to only
gene expression limits their ability to detect interactions
to cases where the TF and target exhibit correlated gene
expression, which is not always the case for regulatory
interactions. Like Beyer et al., they also create only 1 classifier to cover all TFs whereas our study makes separate
classifiers for each TF. Simonis et al. [51] used linear discriminants to classify genes, and they employed the use of
randomly selected negative sets as we do. However, their
method was not used for (and wasn't intended for) predicting new targets of TFs. Instead, their purpose was only
to filter out false positives from any sets of genes proposed
to be co-regulated. They use only sequenced based meth-

Our SVM-based approach generates classifiers for each TF,
and the significance of the predictors is assessed using
cross validation and comparison to randomized control.
The selection of highly enriched prediction sets is made
simpler by the use of an enrichment score for each potential target gene. By incorporating many types of genomewide measurements into a robust feature ranking system,
it is possible to discover important biological aspects of
regulation which are specific to each TF being studied.
This has been demonstrated on the yeast cell cycle regulator, Swi6. The predicted targets of Swi6 match the known
biology of the regulator and suggest possible new roles of
action in bioactive lipid metabolism and the DNA damage response. Moreover, feature ranking has identified
interesting biological properties of the regulator including
expression change of its targets in Mbp1 deletion mutants,
and over-representation/conservation of the motif

ACGCG. Similar analyses can be carried out with other
TFs, as shown with Gzf3 and Ash1, for which meaningful
biological features are identified. Investigators may download predictions made for all TFs, view classifier accuracies, and download lists of top-ranked features for each
regulator at the provided web server. Custom analyses of
the full yeast transcriptional network can also be accessed
online in the VisAnt browser.
Classifier accuracy is loosely correlated with the size of the
positive set, where TFs with more known targets tend to
have more accurate classifiers (Additional File 3). This
implies that classifier performance could improve in the
future as more experimental targets are discovered. The
next step of this analysis is to apply these methods to the
human genome and assess their reliability.

Materials and methods
SVM training, parameter tuning, and validation
The SVM is a statistical learning method originally developed by Vapnik [18,19,52]. SVMs are based on rigorous
statistical principles and show excellent performance
when making predictions on many types of large genomic
datasets. The algorithm seeks a maximal separation
between two groups of binary labelled (e.g., 0, 1 or negative, positive) training examples [53]. The training examples are feature vectors x of individual genes, each vector
populated by measurements taken on genome scale datasets (see below). These measurements are the attributes of
the data. A single classifier based on these features is then
constructed to predict targets for each TF. Positives are
genes which are known targets of the TF, and negatives are
a randomly chosen subset of genes (equal in size to the
positive set) which are least likely to be targets. The positives are taken from ChIP-chip experiments [23,54],
Transfac 6.0 Public [24], and a list curated by Young et al.,
from which we have excluded indirect evidence such as
sequence analysis and expression correlation [25]. ChIPchip interactions of p-value ≤ 10-3 are considered positives
[54] and are not filtered using any other criteria. Since
some TFs are tested under multiple experimental conditions, the negatives will be the targets with highest average
p-values under all experiments (and they must not be targets under any condition).

The separation of targets from non-targets is accomplished by an optimization which finds a hyperplane separating the two classes [18,19]. Aside from the number of
features on which to base the classifier, only one parameter must be set in our framework before training the SVM,
the C parameter, which controls the tradeoff between the
so-called margin and the classification error. Since it
would be computationally expensive to choose these
parameters during the training of every classifier (which
would also be more likely to over-fit the data), they are

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/22

first optimized on the classifier for one TF. The learned
values are then applied to the remaining classifiers.
The C parameter adjusts the tolerance of the algorithm for
misclassifications. Lower values indicate higher tolerance
for errors or noisy data, with a compensating increase in
the strictness of the error margin around the SVM separating hyperplane. As with feature selection (described
below), the classifier for YIR018W (Yap5) was used as the
prototype for parameter selection since it is known to regulate ~70 genes, which is close to the average for all TFs
being analyzed. Grid selection was performed on the
training set for YIR018W using many values of C, and classifier accuracy was measured with 5-fold cross validation.
The SVM was seen to be insensitive to the choice of C, with
most values less than 1 showing similar performance.
Tested values include: [2-7 2-5 2-3 2-1 1 1.5 2 22 23 24 25 26].
The value 0.0078 was chosen as this was the value
reported by the SPIDER machine learning package [55] as
having the best performance. In tests with other transcription factors the same value was chosen in most cases.
In previous work [17] we experimented with various varieties of SVM and found the linear SVM to be largely superior with the datasets examined here (unpublished work).
By reanalyzing that original data we see that in one initial
experiment where the type of SVM was allowed to vary
between linear, quadratic, and cubic, the linear SVM had
a higher cross-validation accuracy in 90 out of 104 cases.
Similarly, using cross-validation on 104 TF classifiers, the
PPV obtained by linear SVM was significantly higher by ttest than those using RBF (p = 3.62e-4) or Gaussian (p =
8.5e-68) SVMs. The formulas for RBF and Gaussian are
quite similar and can be seen in [17]. They are used as
implemented in the SPIDER machine learning toolbox
[55].
Choosing negatives for TF target prediction can be difficult, since there is no defined set of genes known not to be
targets. As in our previous work, ChIP-chip results can
serve as a guide. For every TF, ChIP-chip results are used to
identify genes which have the highest p-values (least significant) for binding under all tested conditions. From
these least significant binders, the negative gene pool is
chosen to be at least three times the size of the positive set,
or 600 genes, whichever is larger. Recall that for each individual classifier, the number of positives and negatives is
balanced. This is done by randomly under-sampling from
the negative pool. Classifiers constructed on different randomly chosen negatives may give different results, since
some unknown targets may be incorrectly assigned to the
negative set. To smooth out these fluctuations, 50 classifiers are constructed for each transcription factor using a
random resampling from the negative set. Each resampling is equal in size to the positive set and all 50 classifi-

ers are tested using leave-one-out cross validation
(LOOCV). The final performance statistics (Accuracy,
PPV, etc.) are averages from the 50 trials. It is important to
keep in mind that, although balanced datasets are often
used in machine learning, using balanced sets means that
an Accuracy of 50% is equivalent to random chance.
Although many metrics exist by which to evaluate classifiers we report Accuracy and Positive Predictive Value
(PPV). Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly classified examples to all examples classified:

Accuracy =

TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN

Where TP = true positive, TN = true negative, FP = false
positive, and FN = false negative. PPV is defined as the
ratio of correctly predicted positives to all positive predictions:

PPV =

TP
TP + FP

The scheme used here for classifier construction is outlined in Figure 1. To illustrate the construction and validation more concretely, a short outline is provided below.
For a particular TF
1. Assemble positive set of n known targets. Sample n
genes randomly from the negative pool (see above) to
construct the negative set
2. Split the data for LOOCV (n-1 genes in training set, 1
gene in test set).
3. Use SVM-RFE to rank all features in the training set.
4. Construct SVM classifier on top 1500 features. Save full
feature ranking.
5. Classify left out gene.
6. Repeat steps 2–5 to complete LOOCV. Save all feature
rankings.
7. Calculate performance statistics (Accuracy, PPV, etc.)
8. Repeat steps 1–7 50 times.
9. Calculate final performance statistics (i.e., mean Accuracy, mean PPV).
A new gene can be classified by applying all 50 TF-specific
classifiers to the feature vector for that gene in balanced
genomic test sets. Each classification produces a Platt
score (see below), and the mean of all 50 scores is used. If

the mean P > 0.95, classify the gene as a target of the TF.
The full set of feature rakings on every training set is used
to calculate the final feature rank (see below).
Genomic feature selection and ranking
The SVM algorithm can be used to select and rank data
features. An important output from the algorithm is the
vector w, which contains the learned weights of each feature. This vector points in a direction perpendicular to the
hyperplane, and thus defines its orientation. Features with
higher components in w are more useful in separating the
positive and negative classes. The SVM recursive feature
elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm uses w to select features
useful for classification [39]. The original SVM-RFE algorithm trains an SVM on a training set, and the components (attributes) of the feature vector x which have
smallest weights are discarded [39]. The w vector is recalibrated and the process is repeated until the desired
number of attributes remains. If feature selection were
only performed one time for each TF prior to cross validation there would naturally be a risk of over-fitting, since
both training and test information would be used to
choose the best features. Instead we perform feature selection on each training set during cross-validation, ensuring
that any over-fitting would be detected as low accuracy on
the test set.

In our study, features for all genomic datasets are concatenated to produce large attribute sets for each gene. SVMRFE is used to select relevant features during classifier
training and various feature subset sizes are tested using a
leave-one-out cross validation. Thus we allow the datasets
to adjust, automatically selecting the most important features, irrespective of the data sets from which they originated. Once again Yap5 was used as a prototype. Figure 9
shows the effect that changes in feature number have on
Yap5 classifier accuracy. Although as few as five features
achieve 70% accuracy, the addition of more features continues to improve accuracy until 1500 features are
selected, where accuracy is approximately 85%. 1500 is
then the number chosen for the remaining TFs. The specific 1500 features are, of course, chosen individually for
each TF. A more optimal procedure would be to also
choose the best number of features for each classifier as
this may vary from TF to TF. Such a procedure would be
computationally prohibitive. In our procedure half of the
features are removed during each iteration of SVM-RFE
until at least 1550 features remain. Features are then
removed one at a time until the target of 1500 is reached
It is important to appreciate the difference between the
feature selection performed during classifier construction
and the feature ranking which is later used to assess the
overall usefulness of features for predicting targets of a TF.
Feature selection for each classifier is simply an applica-

tion of the SVM-RFE procedure. The feature rankings mentioned in the Discussion are created by compiling the
individual rankings from all 50 TF classifiers. This provides a more accurate selection of features by choosing
those which are ranked highly in a majority of training sets.
The final feature rank is achieved in the following way.
After a single application of the SVM-RFE algorithm, the
w-vector for the top 1500 features is used to determine the
rank of the features in that training set, with higher
weighted features having higher rank. These rankings are
accumulated over every training set during cross validation of all 50 classifiers created for a TF. The result is a
large set of feature rankings for a particular factor. The top
40 features (the number 40 was chosen arbitrarily) from
each ranking are collected into a list, and a count is taken
of the number of times each feature appears. The final
rank is established by sorting the features based on the frequency of their appearance. Therefore, features which are
consistently ranked high during all cross-validation trials
are given a high rank. Clearly, features high on this list are
reliably important for separation and robust to changes in
the training set. In keeping with our example of Swi6,
there are a total of 7100 feature rankings available for
Swi6 features (142 examples times 50 cross validation

repetitions). Figure 4 shows a plot of the features for Swi6
sorted by their occurrence in the top 40 ranked features
within the 7100 rankings.
Classifying new targets and prediction significance
As described in [27], SVMs can provide a probabilistic output which in this case measures the likelihood that any
given gene is a target. Here this output is referred to simply
as a Platt score or enrichment score. The intuition of this
method of assigning scores is that data points which are
deeper in the positive region (i.e., further from negative
examples) are the most likely to be true positives.

Because the prior probabilities of each class (positive and
negative) for a transcription factor is unknown, we choose
each class to be of equal size. Thus, the Platt probabilities
are strictly accurate only on the training set rather than the
entire genome, where the classes would be very imbalanced. Using a balanced training set has an advantage in
that some classifiers trained on balanced data often have
better performance (as measured by ROC analysis) than
classifiers trained on imbalanced data. This can vary, however, depending on the data sampling technique used. See
[56] for an insightful discussion and comparison of sampling strategies. Thus, it should be kept in mind when

Page 14 of 20

Biology Direct 2008, 3:22

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/3/1/22

evaluating the results herein that, when using balanced
datasets, an Accuracy of 50% is random. As discussed
above, randomized controls may be used to assess the significance of any single classifier.
Platt scores can nevertheless still be used to rank new predictions, and only those genes with a score of ≥ 0.95 are
considered as potential targets in this study. The fact that
our framework requires that any new target achieve an
average score of ≥ 0.95 across 50 classifiers partly offers an
intrinsic correction and increases the confidence in the
predictions made. Randomized simulations can then be
used determine whether any classifier performs significantly better than random.
Nevertheless, it may be of interest to future work to be
able to correct these raw Platt scores to account for the
imbalances known to exist in the full genome (where, e.g.,
90% or more of the genes may be non-binders for any TF).
As a conservative assumption about the proportion of the
genome (π) which will be bound by a TF, take the number
of genes which are bound as 10%, so π = 0.1. The p-value
associated for any one gene as corrected for genomic
imbalance will be given by

p _ full =

p(1−π )
p(1− 2π )+π

where p is the p-value (1-Platt score) in the sample and
p_full is the p-value for the genome. As an example, if we
see that a TF is predicted to bind a gene with a Platt score
of 0.99, this conditional probability is equivalent to an
uncorrected p-value of 0.01. Thus, the correction above
would transform the p-value of 0.01 to approximately a
p_full of 0.1. Note that this is a very conservative correction since it does not take into account the fact that our
Platt score is the averageover 50 classifiers.
Here and elsewhere we refer to the average, uncorrected
Platt output using the upper case P (e.g., P > 0.99),
whereas p-values measured by other means are shown in
lower case (e.g., p < 0.01).
Feature Datasets
Eight different types of features were used to describe
genes. The first six feature sets have been used previously
and their full descriptions along with many relevant references can be found in [17]. The remaining two datasets
have been modified or are novel. All together these datasets comprise 15516 features. The k-mer based kernels are
inspired by the spectrum kernel [57], the (g, k)-gappy kernel [58] and the mismatch kernel [59] which have been
proposed for sequence classification. In cases were computations were made on promoter regions (datasets 1–3,
5, 7,8) the promoters were defined as the 800 base pairs

upstream of the coding region (translation start cite) and
S. cerevisiae promoters were downloaded from RSA tools
[60]. Before analysis all features are normalized to 0 mean
and standard deviation of 1. Each of the datasets is available for download at [28].
1. k-mers (KMER) – Feature vectors are formed by enumerating all possible strings of nucleotides of length 4, 5,
and 6. The number of occurrences of each string is
counted in a gene's promoter region, and this string of
counts is the gene's feature vector. K-mer counting which
was used in part for datasets 1, 2 and 8 were performed
using code modified from a script kindly provided by Dr.
William Stafford Noble of Washington University.
2. k-mers with Mismatch (M01) – Similar to k-mer counts,
occurrences of all strings of length 4, 5, and 6 are counted.
In addition, any string which contains only one mismatch
is also considered a hit, but is given a count of 0.1 rather
than 1.
3. Melting Temperature Profile (MT) – It is possible that
TF binding is facilitated by conformational adjustments in
promoter DNA, which depends on the stability of the
helix. Some recent evidence shows correlation between
sites of promoter melting, regulatory sites, and transcription initiation sites [61]. The EMBOSS [62] toolbox is
used to calculate the melting temperature profiles of all
yeast promoters using a sliding window of 20 bp. The feature vectors are the same as described in [17]. A temperature is calculated for each 20 bp window in the promoter,
and this vector of window temperatures comprises the MT
profile. 20 bp is the default window size in the EMBOSS
tool.
4. Homolog Conservation (HC) – [63] BLASTP is used to
compare proteins in yeast to those in 180 prokaryotic
genomes. The best hit E-values to each genome are discretized by placing them into one of six bins using empirically determined E-value cut-offs. Bin numbers range
from 0 (no significant hit) to 5 (very significant). Each
gene then has 180 features, each for a different genome,
with values ranging from 0–5, signifying the strength of
the best BLASTP hit of that gene's protein to another
genome.
5. k-mer Median Positions (Kpo) – For each possible kmer (k = 4, 5, and 6) we record its median distance from
the transcription start in each gene.
6. Expression (EXP) – Normalized log2 ratios for each
gene across 1011 experiments [64] are used as features.
Each gene's expression profile is normalized to a mean of
0 and standard deviation of 1. For each gene a vector 1011

long (one feature for each expression experiment) is
included in the data set.
7. k-mer Overrepresentation (Kev) – This method counts
the number of each k-mer appearing in a promoter and
calculates the significance of its occurrence. This method
is the same as that reported in our previous work [17],
except that the binomial distribution is used to calculate
p-values rather than the Poisson distribution. This is in
line with the calculations described in RSA tools [40,60].
A higher Significance corresponds to a more relevant kmer.
8. Conserved k-mers – This method for constructing a kmer conservation matrix is based on output generated by
the PhastCons algorithm [41,65]. PhastCons is a two state
phylogenetic hidden Markov model. The underlying idea
is that conserved elements evolve more slowly than nonconserved elements. Thus, it has a "slow" state for conserved DNA and a "fast" state for non-conserved, more
rapidly changing sites. Given DNA sequence alignments
from multiple species, PhastCons outputs a probability
score for each base pair in the alignment indicating from
which state the sequence arises. This probability can be
interpreted as the likelihood that the base pair is part of a
conserved element. Genomic alignments for seven yeast
species are used to generate the probability scores, which
are available for download from the USC genome browser
website [66,67]. Note that the conservation scores shown
in Figure 6 are from the PhastCons algorithm and were
taken directly from the UCSC Genome Brower website.
During k-mer counting, each k-mer is given a unique
weight depending on the average PhastCons score of its
nucleotide positions. Simply weighting by the probabilities would result in missing data, since some genomic
regions have no alignments. Instead we introduce a
weighting scheme which increases the weight of a k-mer
according to its conservation. Our weighting metric is:

1
1− β Pc
where Pc is the average PhastCons score for a particular kmer. β is an adjustable parameter which controls how
much the conservation of a k-mer increases its count. In
this study we choose β = 0.75, so that an element with a
maximum conservation of 1 has a count of 4. An element
which shows no conservation has the default count of 1.
Increasing β will further emphasize the effect of conservation. This method based on PhastCons is inspired by the
"marginalized motif kernel for phylogenetic shadowing"
introduced in [68]. Their method uses promoter alignments and a probabilistic model of fast and slow evolution to assess conserved elements. While their method can

be considered more robust when good sequence alignments are available, we adopt the approach described here
so that all yeast sequences may be included in our analysis.
Functional Analysis, Software, and Expression Data for the
Swi6 Analysis
Statistical enrichment of GO biological process terms in
gene sets was performed using the GO Term Finder on the
Saccharomyces Genome Database website [69,70]. Most
of the analysis was performed in MATLAB [71] using custom scripts along with the SPIDER software package [55].

Expression data for Swi6 was taken from [32] and their
associated website [72]. Expression data for YMR279C
showing cell cycle induction was from [34] and was
explored using the Expression Connection [35] at the
SGD website.
VisAnt Networks
The networks (such as Figure 3) created with the VisAnt
toolkit[20,21] show links which have come from many
publications. Any particular type of link (e.g., protein-protein interaction) may represent a collection of data from
several genomic datasets. Each link type is referred to in
VisAnt as a "method" and each method has a unique identifier. The method IDs for the link types in this paper
include: M0037(phylogenetic profile), M0013(copurification), M0040(screened yeast-2-hybrid), M0031(other
biophysical), M0046(Bayesian Predicted Interaction),
M0045(affinity chromatography). Complete references
and datasets are available in the VisAnt suite, accessible
from the VisAnt website [73].

features in SVM classifiers, expansion of the transcription
factor list and a case study of one of them, where some
new biological insights can be gained. Overall, this is a
straightforward work, which potentially can help uncovering useful biological information. Personally, I found
the "principal finding #4" most interesting and appealing
to a broader audience, although it is clear that it wouldn't
be there without other findings reported in this study.

Reviewer comments:

I do not have any major concerns. I am not impressed
with the way this work is presented, perhaps because it is
difficult to evaluate the true biological significance of the
method. Why the Swi6 story is told in a great detail and
two other transcription factors were "briefly explored"?
This is out of 163 transcription factors for which the developed formalism was applied to identify their targets.
Clearly, it is difficult to produce in-depth analyses for all
of them, but what was the choice of the few based upon?
In the absence of such explanation, one usually thinks
(ignoring the presumption of innocence rule) that in the
case of "the case study" biological insights were obtained,
whereas in other cases it was not that impressive. Hopefully, authors can prove me (and my diabolic suspicion)
wrong.
A couple of other comments: (i) I think the title of this
paper is too broad and non-specific; (ii) on page 4 (last
sentence) authors state that "instead of using all (available?) features to make a classifier we apply recursive feature elimination to select those that are most relevant ". It
would be helpful to explain in the next sentence what
those most relevant features are...
Other than that, this is certainly a strong computational
study worth publishing and hopefully yeast biologists will
make use of information presented here.
Authors' Response
Regarding the Reviewer's comment on our choice of
exploring Swi6 in depth, we chose this TF because it is
widely studied. It was our objective to bring practical biological insights to the publication, which is why we
focused the majority of the discussion to a single factor. It
was not our intention to "cherry pick" the case study,
although Swi6 is one of the factors for which the method
shows a higher accuracy. There are other TFs with similar
accuracy measurements, though we feel that experimental
validation is an important future step to corroborate these
results. We would also like to direct the reader to the
reviewers' comments to another manuscript wherein we
apply SVM methods to predict binding sites in the human
genome (Holloway et al. In Silico Regulatory Analysis for
Exploring Human Disease Progression. 2008. Biology
Direct. Pending). Comments and responses therein may
also be relevant to the instant manuscript.

I think this is interesting and important new work in the
area of supervised learning approaches to identifying transcription factor targets. Overall, the manuscript is very
well written, and the principle findings are well supported
by the data presented. The methods are appropriate and
sufficiently described to allow replication and/or application to other datasets or species. Additionally, the data are
presented in a clear manner. I have concern about one
particular figure, which should not affect publication
because it doesn't affect the major conclusions relating to
the figure. Figure 3 is presented as further evidence of the
regulatory network connection between Swi6 and the
newly predicted target Rfx1. Figure 3 is supposed to depict
the association of these two genes with the cell cycle due
to an apparent correlation in their expression patterns.
The expression profiles of Swi6 and Rfx1 across the 18
time points have a correlation coefficient of 0.6, and a
selected subset of 8 time points has a correlation coefficient of 0.73. However, unlike the G1 and S phase reference genes shown, the expression profiles of Swi6 and
Rfx1 show no obvious pattern that could be associated
with the cell cycle in this experiment. Moreover, the
amplitudes of their changes across this time course are
minimal, and could be easily mistaken for slightly correlated noise. I find this figure unimpressive, and possibly
unnecessary because the major conclusions drawn from
this figure are well supported by other data and cited studies as described in the manuscript.
Authors' Response
We thank Dr. Mockler for his comments and suggestions.
We understand his reservations about Figure 3, and we
agree that the expression analysis of Swi6 and Rfx1 are not
required to make the manuscript complete. Nevertheless,
a correlation value of 0.73 may be significant and, if nothing else, it is suggestive of further studies which may be
pursued to understand the relationship between these
genes.

Biology Direct 2008, 3:22

The paper is about the classification/prediction of transcription targets. It summarizes new developments to the
work summarized in two preceeding publications on the
same subject (Machine Learning methods for data integration, IBM J. Res. Dev., 50, pp 631–643, 2006 and
"Machine learning for regulatory analysis and transcription target prediction in yeast, Systh. Synth. biol., 1: 25–
46, 2007). The added value of the present manuscript is
the application of recursive feature elimination for selecting relevant classifier descriptors, a technique described
by Vapnik and associates (Machine Learning, 46: 389–
422, 2002), a heuristic selection of attributes, and several,
sometimes not entirely specified improvements to the
methods, applied to a greater dataset.
While the findings are potentially interesting for a wide
audience, I find the writing very technical, at times repetitive and quite difficult to follow – even for readers interested in support vector machines, string kernels and
feature selection. The abstract lists four principal findings,
and I am not entirely sure if and where these points are
dealt with in the Results section.
For instance, the first finding reads as: "Application of the
method yields an amplification of information about
yeast regulators." Is "amplification of information"
defined later in the text? It is then stated: "The ratio of
total targets to previously known targets is greater than 2
for 11 TFs, with several having larger gains: Ash1(4),
Ino2(2.6), Yaf1(2.4), and Yap6(2.4)." Apart form the general list in supplementary materials, I did not find a table
in the text that would substantiate these points. The same
holds for the second principal finding "Many predicted
targets for TFs match well with the known biology of their
regulators.". This finding should be underpinned with
numerical data.
Principal finding 4 reads as follows "An analysis of global
network properties highlights the transcriptional network
hubs; the factors which control the most genes and the
genes which are bound by the largest set of regulators.
Cell-cycle and growth related regulators dominate the
former; genes involved in carbon metabolism and energy
generation dominate the latter." I found only one network
figure which refers to a local subnetwork, but I did not
find a figure or a table that would underpin this finding in
a numerical way.

this manuscript, because the work is novel and interesting. Perhaps the authors should make it clearer whether
the goal is to describe methodological and Web-server
details, or rather to present biological findings. It would
be useful to quote examples of how a new methodology
affects the efficiency of the prediction.
Authors' Response
Regarding Dr. Pongor's point related to "amplification of
information", we intended this phrase merely to describe
the fact that the method allows the prediction of many
transcriptional targets, and that for some TFs the number
of new predictions may be large compared to what is currently known, hence an "amplification of information".
This was not intended to provide a quantitative assessment such as would be possible if metrics from Information Theory (e.g., Entropy measures) were employed.

Also, regarding the comments related to the network analysis, we note that global network diagrams often appear
cluttered and unwieldy. For this reason we calculated
basic statistics using the online VisAnt tool and chose to
report the results rather than submit images which would
not likely be informative.

The authors made a large study, with many methodological improvementa that are difficult to coherently present
for any audience. A better writing (removal of redundancies, a conceptual separation from previous work, and a
bettter focus on added values, a clear comparison of previous and present predictions, comparison with other
methods etc.) could in my opinon substantially improve

Accuracy and Number of Positives. This figure plots the classifier accuracy on the left y-axis(blue), and the number of positives (targets) on the
right y-axis(green). Classifiers are numbered on the x-axis and sorted
according to increasing accuracy. A loose trend is present, showing that
increasing the number of positives increases classifier accuracy. This is
mainly seen when 50 or fewer positives exist. Classifiers with 20 or fewer
examples tend to do poorly.
