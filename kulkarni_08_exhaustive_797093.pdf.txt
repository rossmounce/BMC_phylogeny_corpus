Abstract
Background: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most abundant form of genomic
variation and can cause phenotypic differences between individuals, including diseases. Bases are
subject to various levels of selection pressure, reflected in their inter-species conservation.
Results: We propose a method that is not dependant on transcription information to score each
coding base in the human genome reflecting the disease probability associated with its mutation.
Twelve factors likely to be associated with disease alleles were chosen as the input for a support
vector machine prediction algorithm. The analysis yielded 83% sensitivity and 84% specificity in
segregating disease like alleles as found in the Human Gene Mutation Database from non-disease
like alleles as found in the Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms. This algorithm was
subsequently applied to each base within all known human genes, exhaustively confirming that
interspecies conservation is the strongest factor for disease association. For each gene, the length
normalized average disease potential score was calculated. Out of the 30 genes with the highest
scores, 21 are directly associated with a disease. In contrast, out of the 30 genes with the lowest
scores, only one is associated with a disease as found in published literature. The results strongly
suggest that the highest scoring genes are enriched for those that might contribute to disease, if
mutated.
Conclusion: This method provides valuable information to researchers to identify sensitive
positions in genes that have a high disease probability, enabling them to optimize experimental
designs and interpret data emerging from genetic and epidemiological studies.

Background
The Human Genome Project [1] was driven by the hope
that characterization of the human genome would elucidate the molecular etiology of human disease. This
resulted into an abundant amount of data regarding the
genetic variation across the human genome as amended
by the HapMap project [2], which catalogs the location
and linkage information for many human genetic variants. The most common variations are single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), single base pair positions in the
genome at which different sequence alternatives (alleles)
exist. They occur approximately once every 1,000 bases
unevenly distributed across the human genome, principally in non-coding regions presumably due to higher
selection pressure in coding regions [3]. While approximately half of the SNPs in coding regions are silent [4,5],
the other half result in missense mutations (change in the
encoded protein sequence) that may be neutral or
involved in a disease or phenotype.
SNPs like other genetic variations may be indicators of
susceptibility to polygenic diseases [6,7] and could provide a basis for diagnostic and optimal therapeutic
choices. A major challenge in realizing these expectations
is to identify variants likely to be disease related. While the
characterization of all SNPs through disease association
studies is economically and practically unrealistic, computational methods to rank SNPs based on their potential
impact would help to select and focus on those base positions predicted to be strongly associated with disease. To
this end, a variety of approaches with different philosophies have been proposed. Some are purely based on
sequence information including conservation in interspecies homologous proteins (orthologs), natural selective pressure at the residue level and the nature of the residue change [8-11]. Other methods combine protein
sequence with other physico-chemical properties including protein thermodynamic stability and structure, adding
more functionally-relevant knowledge but restricting the
applicability of those algorithms to particular cases
(known proteins, known structures...) [9,12-16]. An interesting example has been proposed by Fleming et al. [17]
where the authors categorize missense mutations in the
exon 11 of the BRAC1 gene by assigning a probabilistic
score representing their likelihood to disrupt the gene
function, potentially resulting in breast cancer. The
authors used the SIFT (Separating Intolerant from Tolerant) method, considered a gold standard for the prediction of functional effects of mutations [9]. However, this
effort has limitations. For instance, SIFT is based on
amino acid substitutions and cannot be directly applied
to sequences that are transcribed but not translated also
called non-coding RNA (ncRNA). These ncRNAs, have
been shown to play diverse functions (mRNA splicing,
RNA modification, translational regulation etc...) and rep-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S9/S3

resent the majority of the transcriptional output in higher
eukaryotes [18]. Futhermore, most methods including
SIFT, predict effects of non-synonymous substitutions
while recent studies have shown that synonymous substitutions, although not resulting in a change in the encoded
transcripts may none-the-less cause a measurable phenotypic change and sometimes disease [19].
In this study we propose a predictive method primarily
based on sequence and phylogenic information with the
aim to apply it to the entire human genome. This method
like others hinges on the assertion that evolutionarily conserved nucleotide bases are important for gene function
and that single base mutations at these conserved positions are likely to represent disease alleles [20]. Our goal
is to predict the impact of a mutation appearing in any
gene and at any position, including transcribed but not
translated genes, and provide the disease likelihood associated with such a change. Along with the level of interspecies conservation and residue change, we also investigated
several factors known or suspected to be disease markers
in other published studies such as the location in the protein and nucleotide position in the triplet type of substitution. We have incorporated all these factors into the
design of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier that
was trained on disease related mutations as found in
Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [21] and
mutations found in dbSNP [22] for the vast majority of
which no disease linkage has been established and are
likely to be neutral or of minor phenotypic impact. The
SVM classifier appropriately scales these factors relative to
their importance and quantifies probable disease-causing
substitutions within the human genome regardless of
whether they have been previously observed and annotated as such.

are disproportionately distributed in the most conserved
nucleotide positions within genes (Figure 2). The average
normalized conservation score calculated for HGMD
mutations is 0.88 ± 0.24. Importantly, 87% of HGMD
mutations score higher than the gene (average of all positions) in which they occur. Conversely, and as anticipated, dbSNPs mutations tend to occur in the least
conserved positions (0.57 ± 0.40, and 0.63 ± 0.40 if synonymous mutations are excluded). Only half of the mutations in dbSNP score higher than the gene in which they
occur (57% if synonymous mutations are not considered). The conservation score distribution for randomly
selected positions is similar to dbSNPs mutations: the
average score is 0.61 ± 0.38 and the fraction of positions
scoring higher than the gene is 56%. Since dbSNP and
HGMD databases are not cross referenced, it is unknown
if the mutations in dbSNP are entirely unique or were codeposited in both databases. While it seems counter-intuitive that random position have a slightly higher score
than dbSNP mutations, the difference is minor compared
to what is seen with HGMD mutations or the common set
of mutations. The average conservation score calculated
for the 998 mutations that were found in both sets (0.80
± 0.32) confirms the relationship between conservation
and sensitivity of a position.
As an interesting aside, we discovered by inspection that
the conservation score decreased in the base positions on
either side of the nucleotides that were annotated as dis-

best simplify the figure. The random pools were position
selected from that alignments obtained with each pool. For
instance for random HGMD: for each HGMD mutation, a
position was randomly selected within the same gene (to
avoid an alignment bias) leading to a same number of random
positions (20094). The common group represents mutations

ease-causing in HMGD. This trend was observed for 83%
of HMGD SNPs for up to 5 bases (the maximum number
inspected) on either side of the disease-causing base. This
suggests that disease-causing alleles have stronger selection pressure relative to the surrounding sequence space.
Finally and as a limitation, under the scoring scheme
used, we do not take into account positions in distant species that appear to be conserved, but were in fact mutated
multiple times to ultimately revert back to the same
nucleotide base. In this particular case, our scoring
method doesn't factor in such 'back and forth' mutations.
Translation information as a measure of disease
susceptibility
This study was predominantly aimed at identifying
genome-wide factors that could be used to predict diseaselike mutations across all genes. Factors associated with
mutation position in the codon, residue-change effects,
such as alteration of the shape, size or charge of the residue were found to be very weak predictors. However these
factors may be of interest in certain subsets of genes. For
instance, hydrophobic to hydrophilic substitutions captured in the PHAT matrix [23] constructed specifically to
study membrane proteins would presumably be more
appropriate to study genes coding for membrane proteins
[24].

The BLOSUM and PAM matrices computed from genomewide alignments of different families of proteins were also
found to be useful to segregate sensitive from insensitive
base positions. The BLOSUM80 matrix was found to be
the most efficient at identifying disease-causing mutations. 94% of HGMD mutations had a non-favorable substitution versus only 45% for dbSNP. This is consistent
with the assumption that non-favorable changes may significantly impact the protein function.
Important predictors and SVM performance
Inter-species conservation information was found to be
the strongest predictor among the ones that were selected
to identify disease allele. This information was provided
to the SVM via 7 different metrics (see Methods). We evaluated the relative importance of these factors using the
"leave one factor out technique" (Figure 3). Removal of
these factors individually did not significantly affect the
classifier performance due to redundant information in
the factors. However, removing all of them resulted in a
significant decrease in performance. Despite their redundancy, the use of these factors in concert produced the
strongest SVM classifier, confirming that inter-species
conservation is a crucial parameter for identifying single
base mutations that correlate with phenotype alteration.

to have HGMD-like signatures. While these are technically
misclassified, they nonetheless remain potential candidates for further investigation. Due to the absence of disease linkage information in dbSNP, we have assumed that
most mutations in dbSNPs may not have a significant
phenotypic impact. However absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence and dbSNP very likely contains a
number of disease causing mutations that have as yet to
be identified. Identifying them and refining the training
sets could also significantly improve the algorithm effectiveness.

Receiving operating characteristic (ROC) graph. The number
next to each point represents the parameter left out from
the SVM.
The other factors found to be good predictors are the BLOSUM 80 substitution matrix, the number of orthologs
found for a gene, and the position of the base within the
codon (Figure 3). Several random factors were incorporated into the design of the SVM as control parameters
(length of the gene, location within the gene). The insignificance of these random factors was confirmed when
their removal from the SVM model did not impact its performance.
The final classifier yielded 83% sensitivity and 84% specificity in segregating the HGMD-like mutations from the
dbSNP-like mutations. If parameters not related to translation information are removed (codon position, substitution type, substitution matrix) the classifier still
achieves 64% sensitivity and 72% specificity. For the
majority of misclassified HGMD mutations, we observed
that although they had high normalized conservation
scores, they were located in genes with few orthologs (less
than 3). The classifier is likely to achieve better performance as the number of sequenced genomes and identified
orthologs increase. Another set of misclassified HGMD
mutations was the 49 synonymous mutations, presumably due to the low number of such mutations in the
HGMD training sets. Classification of synonymous mutations will likely improve as more become available in the
HGMD.
Unfortunately and although HGMD has now doubled to
over 40,782 mutations, it is no longer openly available
http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php limiting us to
the last edition publicly available (2005). Finally, when
applied to dbSNP, 16% of the SNPs (12,393) were found

Comparison with SIFT
To assess the performance of the SVM classifier, we compared it with SIFT, a popular method to predict mutations
impacts. The last public version of SIFT predictions on
dbSNP mutations was downloaded and predictions compared with ours. Out of the 27,279 mutations present in
SIFT, only 19,276 were common between the two versions of the database. We also compared the predictions
of SIFT for the subset of SNPs present in HGMD, to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of both methods.

Our SVM, complete and with conservation only were
compared to SIFT. Mutations used for testing were different from those used to train our SVMs (Table 1). On these
sets, the complete SVM achieves the highest Sensitivity
(71% versus 39% for SIFT), at the expense of a lower specificity (62% versus 73%). Overall the best balance of specificity and specificity as measured with the F-measure
appears to be achieved when using our SVM, although
under these experimental conditions, SIFT achieves the
best accuracy (71.9% versus 62.7%). A combination of
the SVM-complete and the SIFT method may represent the
best alternative. The SVM with conservation only performs at the lowest level.
Reasons for the diminished performance for our SVM
when applied to the specific subset of mutations present
in both our data set and that used in the SIFT study is
unclear. One contributing factor is the very small overlap
in the data for the disease causing mutations, i.e. those
found in HGMD, common to both SIFT and our SVM.
Since SIFT is computed only on dbSNP mutations, only
that small subset of mutations (998 out of 21,946) that
appear in both databases can be used for testing and comparison. We specifically excluded these common mutations while training our SVM so that we could best
differentiate between and classify mutations that are disease causing (HGMD) and those presumed to be non-disease causing (dbSNP). When compared to the results
obtained during the testing of our SVM, the SVM complete
achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, with a testing set that contained many more mutations and presumably more illustrative of the actual performance of our SVM (Figure 4).

Genome wide application and validation
In its present form, the SVM, through the use parameters
like BLOSUM80 substitution scores or the base position
in the codon, partially depends on translation information limiting its application to genes with well defined
expressed sequences (introns/exons, coding frames etc...).
Furthermore, the use of BLOSUM80 requires prior knowledge of mutation transitions from their wild type state to
their mutated states. Finally, for the 5,073 out of the
39,218 known RefSeq genes that do not encode proteins,
it would be inconsistent and unreliable to use codon transitions for predictions.

Parameters depending on translation information have
been removed from a second version of our SVM that has

been applied to all the coding regions within the human
genome. Each base position has been scored in accordance to the disease likelihood associated with a mutation
occurring at this particular position. The calculated score
provides a quantitative measure scaled from 0 to 100
instead of a qualitative prediction (disease/non-disease).
Figure 5 shows the cumulative frequency distribution for
all HGMD and dbSNP mutations as a function of HGMD
like score (with 100% being the more HGMD like). The
distribution for all coding bases in the human genome is
also shown for comparison. The similarity between the
dbSNP accumulated distribution and all coding bases,
suggest that most bases, if altered, will not result in disease
causation (i.e. are not HGMD-like). The HGMD distribution curve was used to identify a threshold corresponding
to the inflection point with maximum slope (maxima of
the derivative). This threshold was found to be 94%. This
6% range of conservation (from 94% to 100%) is
enriched with over half of the mutations in HGMD, while

it includes only 13% of nucleotide bases (or 12,038,565
bases) in the entire coding genome that could potentially
play a causative role in disease/phenotype alteration.
Mutations and SNPs occurring within this range of conservation score, and for which no disease linkage has been
established, have the highest potential value for researchers designing disease association studies.
Using our methodology 26,874 gene transcripts in the
human genome found at least one ortholog in comparable genomes. These genes were then ranked according to
their likelihood of being associated with disease if
mutated, based on our disease probability score obtained
with our SVM based on conservation information only.
Out of the 30 top scoring genes, which are very sensitive
to variation, 21 are known to be directly associated with a
disease from published literature (Additional file 1). Conversely, only one gene out of the 30 with the lowest scores
were found to be associated with disease in the published
literature. Many of those genes with lower scores are
hypothetical, likely due to the low similarity with known
genes (consistently with low conservation and low
scores). The results strongly suggest that the highest scoring genes are indeed enriched with those that might contribute to disease if mutated.

Conclusion
We have developed a comparative genomic analysis
method for genome-wide identification of genome positions with a greater likelihood of being important to gene
function. Mutations occurring at these sites have a higher
probability of representing disease alleles. New single
base mutations or SNPs can then be scored for their
potential to cause a disease, helping direct SNP discovery
efforts.
There is an underlying signature for disease mutations, as
evidenced by their occurrence in the most conserved
nucleotide positions, the favorability of residue substitution observed from BLOSUM scores, codon bias and other
factors. This signature was exploited to identify and flag
putative disease-causing mutations in all coding human
bases, including some in dbSNP, irrespective of the existence of annotation as causing a disease or clinical phenotype. Additional genetic (or other) factors, if discovered in
the future to be causative of disease, can be easily incorporated in the prediction algorithm, i.e. the SVM classifier.
This makes this tool and approach versatile, enabling one
to quantitatively test the strength of new factors or metrics
for their potential for disease causation.

Methods
Overview and basic data sets
Our predictive method is based on a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) algorithm that one can easily implement

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/S9/S3

using the popular 'R' statistical software tool http://
www.R-project.org and more importantly that satisfactorily addresses the non parametric nature of the data distribution for a number of individual input factors [25].
Those factors, including different inter-species conservation parameters, were chosen for their ability to identify
positions in the genome where mutations may have a significant phenotypic impact (i.e. disease). Figure 1 represents the process established to calculate the conservation
score for every nucleotide in the human genome.
Genes were obtained from the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) Database (Release 21) [26]. Single base mutations
were obtained from Human Gene Mutation Database
(HGMD)[27], forming a set of disease causing mutations
(last available public version, June 2005, 21,964 mutations) and from dbSNP [22] (build 126, 97,102 mutations in the coding regions) that is assumed to contain for
the vast majority neutral mutations. The mutations were
extracted
from

http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez setting the limits
parameters to {Organism : Homo Sapiens, Functional
class : coding non synonymous, coding synonymous,
mRNA UTR and only reference SNPs, SNP class : SNP}. A
subset of 998 redundant mutations between both was
separated into the 'Common SNPs' set and later used as
one of the tests of the SVM classifier. Mutations in dbSNP
were partitioned into synonymous (33,871 mutations)
and non-synonymous (42,961 mutations).
Inter-species alignment and conservation score
Finding putative human gene orthologs in other species for optimal
alignment
For every human RefSeq entry, its corresponding ortholog
was identified using megaBLAST [28] in a reciprocal manner http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Homology/. Briefly,
each human RefSeq was BLASTed against eight comparable vertebrate genomes Table 2, and the highest scoring
similar sequence for each genome was reverse-BLASTed
against the human RefSeq database. Only those nonhuman sequences for which the original human sequence
was the highest scoring match were retained as putative
orthologs (Table 2). Each human RefSeq was subsequently aligned with its putative orthologs using CLUSTALW [29].
Evaluating nucleotide conservation
Ideally, a conservation scoring method would result in
significantly higher scores at 'sensitive' positions where
disease causing mutations occur comparatively to random
positions. For each position in each gene, a score was calculated as the weighted average of the conservation
obtained from the alignment of this gene and its
orthologs. The weighting parameters were the UCSC
browser phylogenetic distances [30] for the genomes

where the given nucleotide is conserved and were kindly
provided by the UCSC genome browser group (Table 2).
In this way, a nucleotide conserved in a distant genome
weighs more than the same nucleotide conserved only in
closely related species. This score has also been normalized to allow comparisons between genes (for each gene,
the number of orthologs will be different) (Figure 6).
To ensure that conservation scores significantly correlate
with disease alleles, normalized conservation scores were
also computed for randomly selected base positions in
genes containing mutations listed in HGMD or dbSNP
databases (1,260 and 14,449 genes, respectively, Table 3).
As shown in Figure 2, disease-causing mutations occur at
highly conserved positions and usually are the most conserved positions within the gene. Conversely, and as anticipated, dbSNPs mutations tend to occur in the least
conserved positions.

Mapping SNPs from HGMD and dbSNP to their gene
location
Each and every mutation in the two datasets HGMD and
dbSNP, were mapped to their gene location in three steps.
1) For each mutation, 50 base flanking regions upstream
and downstream were BLASTed against the human
genome. Only hits with 100% identity and no gaps were
kept. 2) The BLAST coordinates were used to map the
exact location of the given mutation nucleotide within the
gene. 3) In order to ensure accurate mapping of mutation
positions to the genes, mutations obtained from dbSNP
were cross-validated using the Genbank XML flat file and
mutations obtained from HGMD were cross-validated
using upstream and downstream flanking regions. Using
this procedure, a total of 20,094 and 76,832 unique mutations from HGMD and dbSNP, respectively, were accurately mapped, as shown in Table 3.
SVM design
A number of factors that we hypothesized may quantify
the effect of a mutation, including conservation, location
of the mutation within the gene, substitution type (synonymous or non-synonymous), type of residue change in
terms of charge, mass, volume, hydrophobicity, and favorability of a substitution as represented in the BLOSUM
and PAM matrices were used in the SVM. For these SVMs,
the radial kernel function was used to design the classifier
due to the non-linear nature of the parameters with cost
and gamma parameters set as 1 and 0.125 respectively to
enhance the classifier performance.

Conservation
The conservation information used in the SVM is based on
seven different metrics: (1) nucleotide raw conservation
score, (2) normalized conservation score to the maximum
possible score per position, (3) maximum conservation
score per gene, (4) average conservation score per gene (5)
percentage of bases with conservation scores below or (6)
equal to the nucleotide position of interest, and (7) comparison of nucleotide conservation score with the average
conservation score within the gene. Figure 7 shows that in
contrast to dbSNP mutations or random positions,
HGMD mutations tend to occur at positions that are significantly more conserved than the gene itself (as measured by the conservation averaged over all its positions).
Although these different conservation metrics have redundancy, analysis using the 'leave one out' technique will
identify which of these metrics provide the best ability to
separate disease causing base variants (from HGMD) from
those base positions unlikely to be associated with disease
(from dbSNP).
Parameters relying on availability of translation information
Although the method we propose is not dependent upon
translation information, various parameters including
amino-acid substitution matrixes were considered in
order to assess their relative importance in predicting
mutations impact at various positions. Furthermore, the
use of translation information (when available) facilitates
the comparison of at least a portion our method with
SIFT.

Two sets of widely used matrixes, BLOSUM [31] and PAM
[32] matrices (BLOSUM30, BLOSUM60, BLOSUM62,
BLOSUM80, BLOSUM90, BLOSUM100 PAM10, PAM50,
PAM100, PAM250, and PAM500) were tested for every
mutation in both dbSNP and HGMD datasets to deter-

mine whether distant or close relationship-based matrixes
are more appropriate for identification of base positions
likely to cause a disease if mutated. Again, it is reasonable
to expect that disease-causing mutations found in HGMD
would more often result in unfavorable substitutions than
mutations in dbSNP.
A number of physico-chemical matrixes have been used to
take into account possible aberrant changes in the volume, mass or charge of the original amino acid that could
potentially disrupt the protein structure. Any extreme
change in any of the above factors could have a disproportionately high impact and therefore be overrepresented in
disease causing alleles (i.e., mutations in HGMD relative
to mutations in dbSNP).
Each individual mutation was also annotated for its location within the codon. Mutations at the first position are
more likely to modify the protein sequence than mutations occurring at the second and third positions. Consequently mutations at the first codon position were
expected to occur more often in HGMD than in dbSNP.
SVM training and testing
All the above-mentioned factors were individually evaluated for their potential to identify diseased alleles and statistically segregate HGMD from dbSNP mutations. The set
of 19,096 HGMD mutations (20,094 minus the 998
redundant) was randomly split in two subsets for training
(80% or 15,277 mutations) and testing (20% or 3,819
mutations). An equal number of mutations from dbSNP
were also randomly chosen and mixed with the corresponding HGMD subset. This 80–20 proportion has been
chosen as a good comprise between the size of the testing
and training sets, and to allow us to obtain a testing set big
enough for comparison with SIFT. The obtained accuracy
with these proportions is 84.3% (Figure 8).

The importance of each factor was weighed individually
against the final prediction outcome by employing the
'leave one factor out' method (Figure 3). Only factors that
significantly contributed to the prediction outcome were
kept to establish a final SVM classifier.
SVM validation
The final classifier was applied to all coding bases within
the human genome to identify high impact positions,
where mutations might have a higher probability for disease-causation. Literature, ontologies and pathway relationships for genes with highest and lowest base-averaged
SVM scores were further inspected. GeneSifter (VizX Labs,
Seattle, WA), a software program typically applied to the
analysis and interpretation of gene expression data, was
used to generate GO Ontology information. Pathways
analysis reports were obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [33]. Disease associations were also based on annotations provided by the
NCBI, the Stanford SOURCE database [34], the Comparative Toxicogenomic database [35] and published literature. Similar analyses were performed with genes
randomly selected as a control, thus allowing the calculation of a z-score.
