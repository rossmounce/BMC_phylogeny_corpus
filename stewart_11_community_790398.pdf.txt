Community transcriptomics reveals universal
patterns of protein sequence conservation in
natural microbial communities

Abstract
Background: Combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets make it possible to study the molecular
evolution of diverse microbial species recovered from their native habitats. The link between gene expression level
and sequence conservation was examined using shotgun pyrosequencing of microbial community DNA and RNA
from diverse marine environments, and from forest soil.
Results: Across all samples, expressed genes with transcripts in the RNA sample were significantly more conserved
than non-expressed gene sets relative to best matches in reference databases. This discrepancy, observed for many
diverse individual genomes and across entire communities, coincided with a shift in amino acid usage between
these gene fractions. Expressed genes trended toward GC-enriched amino acids, consistent with a hypothesis of
higher levels of functional constraint in this gene pool. Highly expressed genes were significantly more likely to fall
within an orthologous gene set shared between closely related taxa (core genes). However, non-core genes, when
expressed above the level of detection, were, on average, significantly more highly expressed than core genes
based on transcript abundance normalized to gene abundance. Finally, expressed genes showed broad similarities
in function across samples, being relatively enriched in genes of energy metabolism and underrepresented by
genes of cell growth.
Conclusions: These patterns support the hypothesis, predicated on studies of model organisms, that gene
expression level is a primary correlate of evolutionary rate across diverse microbial taxa from natural environments.
Despite their complexity, meta-omic datasets can reveal broad evolutionary patterns across taxonomically,
functionally, and environmentally diverse communities.

Background
Variation in the rate and pattern of amino acid substitution is a fundamental property of protein evolution.
Understanding this variation is intrinsic to core topics
in evolutionary analysis, including phylogenetic reconstruction, quantification of selection pressure, and identification of proteins critical to cellular function [1,2]. A
diverse range of factors has been postulated to affect the
rate of sequence evolution within individual genomes,
including mutation and recombination rate [3], genetic
contributions to fitness (that is, gene essentiality) [4],

timing of replication [5], number of protein-protein
interactions [6-8], and gene expression level [9]. Among
these, gene expression level has emerged as the strongest predictor of evolutionary rate across diverse taxa,
with highly expressed genes experiencing high sequence
conservation [9-14]. However, these studies have focused
on model organisms or small numbers of target species.
The links between gene expression and broader evolutionary properties, including evolutionary rate, and the
mechanistic basis for these relationships remain poorly
described for the vast majority of organisms, notably
non-model taxa from diverse natural communities.

natural populations. Such studies have yielded valuable
insight into the genetic potential and functional activity of
natural communities [15-19], but thus far have been
applied only sparingly to questions of evolution. Furthermore, only a subset of studies present coupled DNA-RNA
datasets for comparison [17,19-21]. When analyzed in tandem, coupled DNA-RNA datasets facilitate categorization
of the relative transcription levels of different gene categories, potentially revealing properties of sequence evolution driven in part by expression level variation. However,
it remains uncertain whether broad evolutionary correlates
of gene expression, potentially including sequence conservation, would even be detectable in community-level samples, which contain sequences from potentially thousands
of widely divergent taxa. Here, we compare microbial
metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets from marine and terrestrial habitats to explore fundamental properties of sequence evolution in the expressed gene set.
Specifically, we use coupled microbial (Bacteria and
Archaea) metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets
to explore the hypothesis that highly expressed genes are
more conserved than minimally expressed genes. In lieu
of conservation estimates based on alignments of orthologous genes, which are not feasible using fragmentary
shotgun data containing tens of thousands of genes,
sequence conservation was estimated based on amino
acid identity relative to top matches in a reference database. Our results indicate a strong inverse relationship
between evolutionary rate and gene expression level in
natural microbial communities, measured here by proxy
using transcript abundance. Furthermore, these results
demonstrate broad consistencies in protein-coding gene
expression, amino acid usage, and metabolic function
across ecologically and taxonomically diverse microorganisms from different environments. This study illustrates the utility of environmental meta-omic datasets for
informing theoretical predictions based (largely) on
model organisms in controlled laboratory settings.

Results and discussion
Expressed genes evolve slowly

The relationship between gene expression (transcript
abundance) and sequence conservation was examined
for protein-coding genes in coupled metagenome and
metatranscriptome datasets generated by shotgun pyrosequencing of microbial community DNA and RNA,
respectively. These datasets represent varied environments, including the oligotrophic water column from
two subtropical open ocean sites in the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) and Hawaii Ocean Time Series
(HOT) projects, the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ)
formed in the nutrient-rich coastal upwelling zone off
northern Chile, and the surface soil layer from a North
American temperate forest (Tables 1 and 2). Prior

studies have experimentally validated the metatranscriptomic protocols used here (RNA amplification, cDNA
synthesis, pyrosequencing; see Materials and methods),
confirming that estimates of relative transcript abundance inferred from pyrosequencing accurately parallel
measurements based on quantitative PCR [15,17,19].
Here, amino acid identity relative to a top match reference sequence identified by BLASTX against the
National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant protein database (NCBI-nr) is used to estimate sequence conservation.
In all the samples, amino acid identities, averaged
across all genes per dataset, were significantly higher for
RNA-derived sequences (metatranscriptomes) compared
to DNA-derived sequences (metagenomes), with an average difference of 8.9% between paired datasets (range, 4.4
to 14.7%; P < 0.001, t-test; Table 2). Further analysis of a
representative sample (OMZ, 50 m) showed that RNA
identities remained consistently elevated across a gradient of high-scoring segment pair (HSP) alignment lengths
(Figure 1). This pattern suggests that the DNA-RNA difference was not driven by the (on average) shorter read
lengths in the RNA transcript pool (length data not
shown), which could have imposed selection for reads
with higher identity in order to meet the bit score cutoff
(see Materials and methods). This pattern was not
observed in the highest alignment length bin (>100
amino acids), likely due to the small number of genes
(n = 53) detected among the RNA reads falling into this
category (for example, 0.4% of those in the 40 to 50
amino acid bin; see error bars in Figure 1).
To further rule out that the DNA-RNA discrepancy
was due to methodological differences in DNA- and
RNA-derived samples (for example, error rate variation
due to differential sample processing; see Materials and
methods), we examined amino acid identities in
expressed and non-expressed genes derived from the
DNA dataset only. Hereafter, we operationally define
‘non-expressed’ genes as those detected only in the DNA
datasets, whereas ‘expressed’ genes are those detected in
both the DNA and RNA datasets (gene counts per fraction are provided in Table 3). Across all datasets, mean
identities for DNA-derived non-expressed genes were
significantly lower (mean difference, 10.6%; range, 3.7 to
19.4%; P < 0.001, t-test; Table 2) than those of DNAderived expressed genes, whose values were similar to
those of RNA transcripts that matched expressed genes
(Table 2). This trend was consistent across all samples
(Table 2) and independent of the database used for identifying reads, as comparisons against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Global Ocean
Sampling (GOS) protein databases for a representative
sample (OMZ, 50 m) revealed a similar RNA-DNA
incongruity (Table 4). Furthermore, this pattern was

unchanged when ribosomal proteins were excluded from
the datasets (Table 4), as has been done previously to
avoid bias due to the high expression and conservation of
these proteins [14]. These data confirm a significantly
higher level of sequence conservation in expressed versus
non-expressed genes, broadly defined based on the presence or absence of transcripts.
Given the differences observed between expressed and
non-expressed categories, a positive correlation between
conservation and the relative level of gene expression
may also be anticipated [9]. Here, per-gene expression
level was measured as the ratio of gene transcript abundance in the RNA relative to gene abundance in the
DNA, with abundance normalized to dataset size. Correlations between amino acid identity and expression ratio
were not observed in any of the samples when all genes
representing all taxa were combined (r2 = 0 to 0.02; see
Figure 2 for a representative dataset). This pattern suggests that for a substantial portion of the metatranscriptome, transcriptional activity cannot be used as a
predictor of evolutionary rate. This is likely due in part
to the difficulty of accurately estimating expression
ratios for low frequency genes, which constitute the

majority of the metatranscriptome at the sequencing
depths used in this study [22,23]. However, across all
samples, mean amino acid identity consistently
increased with expression ratio when genes were binned
into broad categories: all genes, top 10%, top 1%, and
top 0.1% most highly expressed (Figure 3). These data
indicate that while transcript abundance is a poor quantitative indicator of sequence conservation on a gene-bygene basis in community datasets, the most highly
expressed genes are, on average, more highly conserved
than those expressed at lower levels.
Genome-level corroboration

It is possible that differences in the relative representation
of genes in the BLAST databases may cause the incongruity in sequence conservation between expressed and nonexpressed genes. Specifically, if expressed genes are more
abundant in the database (which may be likely if these
genes are also more abundant in nature), an expressed
gene sampled from the environment will have a higher
likelihood of finding a close match in the database, relative
to a non-expressed gene. We therefore examined the discrepancy between expressed and non-expressed gene sets

only for DNA reads whose top hits match the same reference genome. Under a null hypothesis of uniform evolutionary rates across a genome, all genes in a sample whose
closest relative is the same reference genome should exhibit uniform divergence from the reference.
The link between expression level and sequence conservation was observed at the level of individual genomes.
Figure 4 (left panel) shows the discrepancy in amino acid
identity between expressed versus non-expressed genes
that match the top five most abundant reference taxa
(whole genomes) in each sample. In all genomes, excluding Bradyrhizobium japonicum from the soil sample, the
mean amino acid identity of expressed genes was significantly greater than that of non-expressed genes (P <
0.001, t-test). These taxon-specific patterns argue against
an overall bias due to varying levels of gene representation in the database. Rather, assuming that the sequences
that match the expressed and non-expressed gene fractions of a given reference genome are indeed present in
the same genome in the sampled environment (an

assumption that might be unwarranted if these two gene
fractions experience varying rates of recombination or
horizontal transfer among divergent taxa - see below),
these results suggest that differential conservation levels,
and not sampling artifacts, are driving the overall discrepancy between expressed and non-expressed genes.
Core genes are overrepresented in the expressed gene
fraction

Our data confirm an inverse relationship between expression level and evolutionary rate in natural microbial communities. However, it remains unclear to what extent
gene expression level depends on a gene’s functional
importance to organism fitness (that is, essentiality) versus other potential explanations, such as ‘translational
accuracy or robustness’ [24]. It has been argued that
orthologous genes retained across divergent taxa (‘core’
genes) may mediate basic cellular functions and that
such genes are more likely to be more essential than
non-core (taxon-specific) genes [25-27]. Here, we

within each core set would likely vary if different sister
taxa were used for comparison [28]. Here, the proportion
of each genome that fell within the core set varied widely,
from 17 to 80% (Table 5), reflecting natural variation and
variation in the availability of whole genomes from different taxonomic groups.
Expressed genes were significantly more likely to fall
within a core gene set shared across taxa. Figure 4 (right
panel) shows the difference in core genome representation (percentage of genes within core set) between
expressed and non-expressed gene fractions for each
reference organism. In 52 of the 60 comparisons (87%),
the percentage of expressed genes falling within the core
set was greater than that for the non-expressed gene
fraction; of these differences, 38 (73%) were significant
(P < 0.0009, chi-square). In some taxa, such as Prochlorococcus marinus str. NATL2A, core genome representation was over 30% greater among expressed genes
relative to non-expressed genes. In contrast, for the
HOT 500 m dataset, expressed genes were not enriched
in core genes, which we speculate may be due to the
activity of the microbial community at this depth (see
Conclusions section below). Overall, however, the data
support the broad trend that highly expressed genes are
more likely to belong to an orthologous set shared
across multiple taxa.
The differential representation of core genes within
expressed and non-expressed genes may influence the
relative sequence conservation levels of these two gene
fractions. Gene acquisition from external sources (for
example, homologous recombination, horizontal gene
transfer (HGT)) is an important source of genetic variation in bacteria [29]. A conserved core genome is traditionally thought to undergo lower rates of recombination
and HGT relative to more flexible genomic regions (for
example, genomic islands) [30], though the horizontal
transfer of core genes may also be common in some taxa
[31]. A central limitation to shotgun sequencing datasets
is that disparate sequences cannot be definitively linked
to the same genome, making it challenging to evaluate
the relative contributions of HGT, homologous recombination, and mutation to sequence divergence. Consequently, it is possible that the higher levels of sequence
divergence observed in the non-expressed gene set are
due in part to enhanced rates of HGT among the noncore genes that predominate in this gene set.
Surprisingly, within the expressed gene fraction, noncore genes were more highly expressed than core genes.
Among the datasets representing the five most abundant
taxa per sample (n = 60, as above), 80% showed higher
expression levels (expression ratio) of non-core genes relative to core genes (Figure 5). Averaged across all of these
taxa, the expression ratio was 34% higher in non-core
genes relative to core genes (2.5 versus 1.9; n = 13,324 and

conflicts with studies based on cultured organisms. For
example, a prior comparative survey of 17 bacterial proteomes showed a relative enrichment of peptides representing proteins encoded within the core genome [28].

expression, as essential orthologs have been shown to be
more broadly represented among diverse taxonomic
groups than nonessential genes [34]. Our data, representing diverse taxa from the natural environment, raise the
hypothesis that core genes are more likely to be expressed
(above the level of detection at the sequencing depths
used here). However, non-core genes, when expressed, are
more likely to be expressed at higher levels. The high
expression of non-core genes, also observed previously for
Prochlorococcus [19], may reflect the importance of taxonspecific genes for adaptation to individual niches in a heterogenous environment [30].

The degree to which expressed gene sets share functional
similarity across microbial communities from diverse
habitats is unclear. Hewson et al. [16] observed shared
functional gene content among metatranscriptome samples taken from the same depth zone (upper photic layer)
at eight sites in the open ocean. Also, the four OMZ
metatranscriptome datasets analyzed in this study have
been shown to cluster separately from the corresponding
metagenome datasets based on functional category abundances, suggesting similar expressed gene content across
depths [35]. However, this clustering was likely influenced
in part by variation in per-gene sequence abundance
(evenness) between the metagenomes and metatranscriptome, and did not explicitly compare expressed and nonexpressed gene fractions. Here, we explored functional
differences between expressed and non-expressed genes
(as defined above) within metagenome (DNA) samples,
for which the relative read copy number per gene is

Figure 4 Expressed and non-expressed genes differ in amino acid identity (left) and core genome representation (right). Data are from
DNA sequence sets and include the five most abundant taxa per sample, with taxon abundance determined by the proportion of total reads
with top matches to protein-coding genes in each genome (BLASTX of all DNA reads against NCBI-nr). ‘Core genome representation’ is
calculated as the percentage of each gene set (that is, expressed or non-expressed genes) falling within the core genome of each taxon, as
defined in the text. All differences (left and right panels) are significant (P < 0.001), unless marked with an asterisk.

highlighting functional differences between ocean and
soil communities (Figures 6 and 7). Among the four
ocean metagenomes, expressed gene sets clustered
together to the exclusion of the non-expressed genes
from the same samples (Figure 6). Indeed, shifts in functional gene usage between expressed and non-expressed
fractions were broadly similar across all samples (Figures
8 and 9). Instances in which all five samples showed the
same direction of change (increase or decrease) in

KEGG gene category abundance occurred in 14 of the
25 functional categories shown in Figure 8 (marked by
open stars), significantly higher (nine times) than random expectations if ignoring potential covariance
between categories (P < 0.0002, chi-square). Notably,
across all five samples, the expressed gene set was significantly enriched in genes involved in energy and
nucleotide metabolism, transcription, and protein folding, sorting, and degradation (Figure 8). In contrast, the

non-expressed gene set was enriched in genes mediating
lipid metabolism and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism; in all ocean samples but not the soil sample, DNA
replication and repair was also significantly overrepresented among non-expressed genes (P < 0.0004, chisquare). At the finer resolution provided at the KEGG
pathway level, genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, chaperones and protein folding catalysis, translation factors, and photosynthesis were consistently and
significantly (P < 0.0001, chi-square) overrepresented
among expressed genes in all samples, whereas genes of
peptidoglycan biosynthesis, mismatch repair, and amino
sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were proportionally more abundant in the non-expressed fraction
(Figure 9). These data indicate broad similarities in
functional gene expression across diverse microbial
communities, with expressed gene pools biased towards
tasks of energy metabolism and protein synthesis but
relatively underrepresented by genes of cell growth (for
example, lipid metabolism, DNA replication).
Database-independent analysis

Our characterization of relative evolutionary rates in
expressed versus non-expressed genes is based on
sequence divergence relative to closest relatives in the
sequence database (NCBI-nr). It is unclear to what
extent this same trend may be detected within clusters
of related sequences within our samples, independent of
comparison to an external reference database. We therefore examined variability in amino acid divergence

within clusters of expressed and non-expressed proteincoding sequences for five representative samples, including shallow and deep depths from the OMZ and HOT
oceanic sites, and the surface soil sample (Table 6).
Mean identity per cluster was consistently higher for
DNA sequences in non-expressed clusters compared to
DNA sequences from expressed clusters (mean difference
5.3%; Table 6). This pattern is opposite to that observed
in comparisons of sequences to external reference databases (above). However, we argue that this inverse pattern is indeed consistent with our hypothesis that
expressed genes are more likely to be part of a core set
shared across taxa (Figure 4). If this hypothesis is true,
then the DNA-only cluster set (non-expressed genes) will
be relatively enriched in non-core genes, including those
present in only one taxon/genome and lacking any
known homologs (for example, orphans) [36,37]. In
environmental sequence sets, if these sequences appear
multiple times, they are more likely to be identical, or
nearly so, because they come from a single taxon population and therefore cluster only with themselves (homologs from other taxa are by definition absent and will not
fall into the cluster).
In contrast, if expressed genes are more likely to fall
within the core genome, clusters containing both
DNA- and RNA-derived sequences (that is, expressed
sequences) will be relatively enriched in homologs that
occur across multiple divergent taxa. By definition,
therefore, DNA+RNA clusters will be relatively
enriched in sequences differing at both the population

level and at higher taxonomic levels (for example, ‘species’), while DNA-only clusters will be enriched in
sequences differing only at the population level. Given
this explanation, we would predict that DNA+RNA
clusters (with RNA sequences excluded) are larger
than DNA-only clusters and that the DNA-only cluster
set as a whole is enriched in high identity clusters.
Indeed, DNA+RNA clusters are, on average, approximately 20 to 33% larger than DNA-only clusters (RNA

sequences not included in counts) and DNA-only cluster sets, notably those of the OMZ samples, are
enriched in clusters with identities greater than 98%
(Figure 10). These data indicate that expressed gene
clusters recruit a larger and more diverse set of
sequences, consistent with the hypothesis that
expressed genes are more likely to represent core
genes shared across taxa. More generally, the contrast

based comparisons (above) demonstrates how divergence measurements taken relative to an external top
match reference can differ from those relative to a top
match internal reference from the same dataset, with
the latter more likely to involve comparisons between
highly related sequences from the same strains/
populations.
GC content and amino acid usage differ between
expressed and non-expressed genes

The discrepancy in sequence conservation between
expressed and non-expressed genes coincided with differences in nucleotide composition and amino acid
usage between these two sequence pools. GC content
was substantially higher in the soil compared to the
ocean samples (approximately 20 to 25% enrichment)
and consistent between the DNA and RNA pools (Table
7). In contrast, across all 11 ocean samples, RNAderived protein-coding sequences were significantly elevated in GC relative to those from the DNA (mean
RNA-DNA difference, 6%; Table 7), suggesting a broad
shift towards GC enrichment in the expressed gene
pool. Surprisingly, however, DNA sequences corresponding to expressed genes consistently had a lower
GC content than DNA reads matching non-expressed

genes (mean difference, 1.9%). These data suggest that
the DNA versus-RNA discrepancy in GC content may
be driven by a subset of transcripts in the RNA pool,
likely those at high abundance. Indeed, analysis of the
RNA reads from one sample (OMZ 50 m) showed a
progressive increase in GC content with transcript
abundance (when transcripts are subdivided into four
categories (top 10%, 1%, 0.1% 0.01%) based on the rank
abundance of the genes they encode (data not shown).
Consistent with the GC pattern, amino acid usage of
protein-coding sequences differed significantly between
the DNA and RNA samples (Table 8, Figures 11, 12, 13,
and 14). Notably, with the exception of three ocean
samples (HOT 500 m, OMZ 110 m and 200 m) and the
outlying soil sample, RNA datasets from diverse regions
and depths grouped separately from DNA samples when
clustered based on amino acid frequencies (Figure 12),
suggesting a global distinction between the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic amino acid sequence
pools in marine microbial communities. Indeed, of 240
comparisons of amino acid proportions in DNA versus
RNA datasets (12 DNA/RNA samples × 20 amino
acids), 227 (95%) involved a significant change in amino
acid frequency, with 114 involving an increase and 113
involving a decrease in frequency from DNA to RNA

(P < 0.0002, chi-square; Table 8, Figure 13). (The high
proportion of significant changes is due to the large
sample sizes in the analysis.) On average, alanine, glycine, and tryptophan (high GC content) underwent the
largest proportional increases from DNA to RNA, while
lysine, isoleucine, and asparagine (low GC content) all

decreased substantially in frequency. These shifts were
largely consistent among ocean samples, but clearly distinct from the pattern observed in soil, where several
amino acids changed in frequency in the direction opposite to that in the ocean samples.

Figure 8 Proportional change in KEGG category abundance between expressed and non-expressed gene fractions. Data are shown for
DNA datasets from five representative samples. Unfilled stars mark KEGG k2 categories in which the direction of change was consistent across
all five samples. Small filled stars mark categories that did not differ significantly in relative abundance between expressed and non-expressed
gene fractions (P > 0.05, chi-square). Only the 25 most abundant KEGG categories are shown.

Among the ocean datasets, DNA-RNA shifts in amino
acid frequency were strongly related to amino acid GC
content (Figure 11a; see Materials and methods). Amino
acids with an intermediate GC content (0.5) constituted
equivalent fractions, 40% and 36%, of the total number
of amino acid frequency increases and decreases, respectively. Strikingly, amino acids with GC content below 0.5
were significantly less abundant in the RNA, being
involved in 61% of all decreasing DNA-RNA amino acid
frequency changes. In contrast, frequency increases were
dominated by amino acids enriched in GC: 50% of
increases involved amino acids with GC greater than
0.5, significantly higher than the representation of these

amino acids in changes involving a decrease (3%).
A similar, but less dramatic, shift in amino acid usage is
observed when the DNA reads were binned into
expressed and non-expressed gene sets (Figure 11b). In
general, the magnitude of the proportional shift in
amino acid usage decreases with depth in the water column (Figure 14). This pattern may reflect an overall
decrease in microbial activity with depth, such that the
transcriptome, less weighted by highly expressed and
highly conserved genes, more closely resembles the
metagenome as activity declines. Together, these results
suggest a significant shift towards GC-rich amino acids
in the expressed gene pool.

Prior studies describe a relationship among gene
expression level, sequence conservation, and amino acid
usage [38-42]. Specifically, significant enrichment in
GC-rich amino acids among highly expressed genes has
been demonstrated for individual bacterial taxa, including Prochlorococcus [38,39]. GC richness in expressed
genes is potentially driven by a combination of factors,
including selection against metabolically costly amino
acids (for example, AT-enriched phenylalanine and tyrosine) [40], or selection against AT-richness in highly
expressed genes. Alternatively, this pattern may stem
from an overall enhanced conservation level in highly
expressed genes [12]. Assuming an underlying GC-toAT mutational bias, which may be a universal trend in
bacteria [41,42], selectively constrained genes are predicted to retain a GC-rich signature relative to less-constrained genes. Therefore, the proportional increase in
GC-enriched amino acids in expressed genes compared
to non-expressed genes in this study is consistent with
our observation of enhanced sequence conservation in
the expressed community gene pool, and confirms a
fundamental distinction in amino acid usage related to
gene expression level.

Conclusions
Microbial metagenomes and metatranscriptomes are
amalgams of thousands of taxonomically and functionally diverse microorganisms, each of which experiences
unique evolutionary pressures. Such complexity might
be expected to preclude the detection of bulk evolutionary signals in meta-omic data. Here, we show broad
trends in protein coding sequence conservation that
transcend variation in both taxonomic composition and
habitat type.
Specifically, we confirm that the hypothesized positive
relationship between gene expression level and sequence
conservation, which has been well established for individual taxa under experimental conditions [11], is a universal trend across diverse microbial communities in
both marine and terrestrial environments. Detecting this
trend required binning genes into broad categories

(expressed versus non-expressed) based on the detection
of transcripts, which depended, in part, on the depth of
sequencing per sample. Deeper sequencing would reveal
a greater proportion of the expressed gene pool and
potentially lead to more accurate measurements of
expression level for low frequency genes [22,23]. However, the tremendous taxonomic diversity inherent in
microbial communities, as well as the temporal heterogeneity of the environment in which these communities
exist, likely confounds any attempt to predict protein
conservation based on transcript abundance on a geneby-gene basis using meta-omic data. Nonetheless, the
broad discrepancy in sequence conservation between
expressed and non-expressed gene fractions is significant, operates consistently across diverse taxa (Figure 4),
and confirms that expression level is a primary determinant of evolutionary rate in naturally occurring
microorganisms.
The mechanism linking evolutionary rates and expression level is still debated. Sequence conservation in highly
expressed proteins has been hypothesized to be driven by
selection acting to minimize the costs of protein misfolding, which should increase in tandem with expression
level (protein copy number per cell) [14], though the
harmful effects of misfolding have been brought into
question [43]. This selection for ‘translational robustness/
accuracy’ is predicted to be largely decoupled from a protein’s functional importance [13,14,24]. Here, using
mRNA abundance as a proxy for expression level, our
results demonstrate broad commonalities in expressed
gene content across communities in widely different
habitats (ocean versus soil). These data indicate a trend
toward genes of protein synthesis and energy metabolism
in the more actively expressed gene fraction and toward
genes of cell replication and growth in the less expressed
fraction. Additionally, this finding, in the context of our
results demonstrating enhanced sequence conservation
among expressed genes, indirectly suggests that the
expression-conservation relationship may partially be
constrained by protein function. However, these data
cannot be used to justify this conclusion, since both gene

expression level and functional importance may independently co-vary with protein evolution rates, as has been
demonstrated for isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
[33]. Though characterizing the mechanism linking gene
expression level and evolutionary rate is beyond the
scope of this study, metatranscriptomic data may inform
future studies exploring the relative effect of protein
function on sequence conservation.
We show that the expressed gene set, compared to the
non-expressed set, is more likely to contain genes that

belong to an orthologous core genome shared across
closely related sister taxa. This pattern was broadly consistent across the marine samples and the soil sample.
Interestingly, the overrepresentation of expressed genes
within the core set was not observed in the HOT 500 m
sample (Figure 4), which we hypothesize may be related
to an overall decline of metabolic activity at deeper
depths within the water column. Microbial transcriptomes can vary significantly in response to the growth
phase of the organism [44-46]. In less actively growing

communities (for example, stationary phase), expression
level might be more uniform across the genome (that is,
background expression), with both core and non-core
genes having a relatively equal probability of detection.
In contrast, in actively growing communities, the

distribution of transcripts might become dominated by a
subset of highly expressed genes (for example, genes
mediating energy metabolism, membrane transport), as
we have observed in other samples. If such genes fall
within the core genome, core genome representation in
the expressed gene set would be predicted to be greater
in more active communities.
Our datasets highlight similarities in gene expression
and sequence evolution across very different microbial
habitats, but differ markedly in other attributes. Notably,
the soil community was a clear outlier with respect to
functional gene content (Figures 6, 7, and 9) and amino
acid usage (Figures 12 and 13), likely due to the distinct
community composition of this habitat (Figure 4). However, given our analysis of a single soil metatranscriptome, and the use of different RNA extraction kits for
soil versus marine samples (see Materials and methods),
we urge caution when comparing microbial community
composition between soil and marine datasets. A more
comprehensive comparison of taxonomy and functional
gene expression would involve extended metatranscriptome sampling across multiple soil types (and locations),
as well as optimization of RNA extraction protocols to
ensure unbiased lysis of all microorganisms. Such an
analysis was not the focus of this study. However, the
inclusion of the soil sample confirmed a positive relationship between expression level and sequence conservation at both the genome and community levels

(Figures 3 and 4), as well as an overrepresentation
of core genes within the highly expressed gene set
(Figure 4). Though it is possible that such patterns may
not be observed in other sample types, or following different extraction protocols, our results provide strong
evidence for universal features of protein-coding gene
evolution in natural microbial communities.
The composition of metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequence datasets depends not only on intrinsic
biological factors (for example, community composition,
metabolic state) but also on the physical and chemical
environment at the time of sampling. Furthermore,
interpretation of the resulting data can vary based on
the analytical method (for example, database-dependent
versus -independent analyses, as shown here) and on
the availability and biases of the reference sequences to
which the data are compared. Here, we attempt to rule
out potential database artifacts by analyses at both the
community and genome level. In so doing, our results

suggest that environmental meta-omic datasets, despite
their inherent complexity, can inform theoretical evolutionary predictions and reveal universal trends across
ecologically and phylogenetically diverse microbial
communities.

Materials and methods
We examined protein-coding sequences in coupled
microbial metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from
multiple depths at three distinct oceanographic sites and
from surface soil in a temperate forest (Table 1). Ocean
datasets (excluding the HOT 110 m RNA sample, which
was sequenced in this study) were generated in prior studies using the Roche 454 Genome Sequencer with FLX
series chemistry and extracted from public databases (see
Table 1 for accession numbers). Sequences from the soil
sample were generated in this study (detailed below) and
are available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under
accession [SRA028811].

Soil sample collection and DNA/RNA isolation

rRNA subtraction, RNA amplification and cDNA synthesis

Soil was collected from within a transition hardwoodwhite pine/hemlock forest in the Prospect Hill Tract of
Harvard Forest (Massachusetts, USA; 42.54 N 72.18 W;
elevation, 385 m) on 27 September 2010. Two cores
were taken from 1 to 10 cm below the leaf horizon
using a 10 mm diameter soil corer. These cores were
homogenized, placed into 50 ml Falcon tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transported to the lab on dry
ice. Visible pieces of plant material were removed from
soil subsamples with sterile forceps. During plant
removal, the subsamples were placed on a sterile surface, laid within a bed of dry ice. Total microbial DNA
and RNA were then extracted from these subsamples
using PowerSoil Total RNA and DNA isolation kits
(MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This extraction protocol differs from
the method used to generate the marine datasets, which
employed the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation kit (Ambion,
Austin, TX, USA) for RNA isolation [17,19,23,35]. It is
possible that these kits may lyse different microbial taxa
at varying efficiencies. As this possibility has not been
assessed, we urge caution when comparing the compositions of soil and marine communities based on metatranscriptome data, though this was not the focus of our
study. Total DNA was quantified and used directly for
pyrosequencing. Total RNA was further processed, as
described below.

Total RNA was amplified and prepared for pyrosequencing
using established protocols. Briefly, the proportion of ribosomal RNA transcripts (bacterial and archaeal 16S and 23S
rRNA and eukaryotic 18S and 28S rRNA) in total soil RNA
was reduced via a published subtractive hybridization protocol using sample-specific rRNA probes [23]. Following
rRNA subtraction, total RNA was amplified as described
previously using a modification of the MessageAmp™ IIBacteria kit (Ambion) [17,19]. Briefly, total RNA was polyadenylated and converted to double-stranded cDNA via
reverse transcription. cDNA was then transcribed in vitro
(37°C, 12 to 14 h) to produce microgram quantities of single-stranded antisense RNA. The amplified products
(approximately 5 to 10 μg aliquot) were converted back to
double-stranded cDNA using the SuperScript® III FirstStrand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
for first-strand synthesis (random hexamer priming), and
the SuperScript™ Double-Stranded cDNA synthesis kit
(Invitrogen) for second-strand synthesis. cDNA was then
purified (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA), digested with BpmI (37°C, 3 h) to remove poly
(A) tails, and used directly for pyrosequencing.
Pyrosequencing

Soil DNA and cDNA were purified for sequencing via
the Agencourt® AMPure® kit (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA, USA) and used for the generation

Stewart et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R26
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R26

of single-stranded DNA libraries and emulsion PCR
according to established protocols (454 Life Sciences,
Roche, Branford, CT, USA). Clonally amplified library
fragments were sequenced with full plate runs on a
Roche Genome Sequencer FLX instrument using Titanium chemistry. Pyrosequencing datasets generated during this study have been deposited in the NCBI
Sequence Read Archive under accession numbers listed
in Table 1.
Data analysis
Homology searches

Pyrosequencing reads matching ribosomal RNA genes
were identified in cDNA and DNA datasets by
BLASTN searches against a custom database of prokaryotic and eukaryotic small and large subunit rRNA
sequences (5S, 16S, 18S, 23S and 28S rRNA) taken
from microbial genomes and the ARB SILVA LSU and
SSU databases [47]. Reads matching rRNA with bit
scores >50 were identified and removed from further
analysis. Replicate sequences sharing 100% nucleotide
similarity and length, which may represent artifacts
generated by the pyrosequencing protocol [23,48],
were identified among non-rRNA sequences using the
open-source program CD-HIT [49] and removed from
each dataset. Non-replicate, non-rRNA sequences were
characterized by BLASTX searches against NCBI-nr,
KEGG, and assembled protein sequences taken from
the GOS database. Protein-coding sequences were
identified as the top reference (database) gene(s)
matching each read above a bit score of 50. When
reads matched multiple genes with equal bit score,
each matching gene was considered a top hit, with its
representation scaled proportionate to the number of
genes sharing the same bit score.
Amino acid identities, relative taxon abundance, and
expression ratio

Local amino acid identities were recovered from within
the top HSP for each sequence having a significant
match (bit score >50) to a reference gene in the nr database; gaps were not included in identity calculations.
Identities of multiple reads matching the same reference
gene were averaged to obtain per gene identities, and
these values were then averaged across all reference
genes per dataset. Relative taxon abundance per sample
was determined as the number of sequence reads
matching the same reference taxon as a top hit in
BLASTX searches of NCBI-nr. The relative transcriptional activity (expression level) per expressed gene was
normalized to account for variations in gene abundance
in the DNA pool, as calculated by the expression ratio:
(RNA reads per gene/Total RNA reads matching NCBInr)/(DNA reads per gene/Total DNA reads matching
NCBI-nr)

Page 22 of 24

Core genome

The proportional representation of expressed and nonexpressed genes in the orthologous gene set shared
between taxa was determined separately for the top five
most abundant organisms in each of the samples. The
core genome of Prochlorococcus sp., which was common
in our samples, was defined as those genes present
across all 12 of the sequenced Prochlorococcus strains,
based on the analysis of [50]. For all other taxa, a core
gene set was more broadly defined by reciprocal
BLASTP searches against a closely related sister taxon
(bit score cutoff = 50). Sister taxa used for core genome
identification, and the number of genes shared between
taxa, are listed in Table 5.
Hierarchical clustering

Average-linkage clustering was performed in Cluster 3.0
using Pearson coefficients (centered) derived from pairwise correlations of KEGG functional category abundances (Figures 6 and 9), amino acid proportions
(Figure 12), or proportional changes in amino acid
usage (Figure 13). KEGG category clustering was based
on expressed and non-expressed gene sets within the
DNA data only, as defined in the main text based on
matches to nr reference proteins. Abundance per KEGG
category was calculated as the total number of reads per
category as a proportion of total reads matching the
KEGG hierarchy at either the category (Figure 8) or
pathway level (Figure 9).
Database-independent cluster analysis

Sequence divergence was determined for clusters of
related sequences within pooled DNA + RNA datasets. To
avoid spurious clustering of non-coding regions (for example, small RNAs (sRNAs)), amino acid sequences present
in the DNA and RNA reads (those with significant
matches to the nr database) were identified using the ab
initio gene-finding program Metagene [51]. (Comparisons
of amino acid sequences determined from Metagene and
sequences determined from BLAST HSP regions produced
nearly identical results.) Sequences derived from DNA and
RNA reads were pooled and clustered using the program
CD-HIT [49] applying a low sequence identity threshold
(55%) over the aligned region. Resulting clusters contained
RNA-derived sequences only, DNA-derived sequences
only, or both DNA- and RNA-derived sequences. For all
clusters containing DNA-derived sequences only (nonexpressed) or DNA + RNA-derived (expressed) sequences,
the divergence between each DNA-derived sequence and
the reference (longest) sequence per cluster was calculated
along the length of the aligned region. These values were
averaged to estimate divergence per cluster. Clusters containing only one sequence (singletons) and clusters in
which the reference sequence was the only DNA sequence
were excluded from further analysis. For clusters in which
the reference sequence was RNA-derived, but that

Stewart et al. Genome Biology 2011, 12:R26
http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R26

contained only one DNA sequence, the percentage identity of the sole DNA sequence was recorded. Divergence
per cluster was then averaged for all expressed and nonexpressed sequence/gene clusters.
Amino acid usage

We compared amino acid usage between DNA and
RNA datasets and DNA datasets parsed into expressed
versus non-expressed gene categories as above. Specifically, for each dataset, reads matching nr proteins (see
above for BLASTX descriptions) were examined to
assess amino acid usage and GC content, using two
approaches. First, amino acids were counted across all
HSPs in alignments between sequence reads and their
closest match in the nr database. Second, amino acids
were counted across open reading frames that were
identified using Metagene [51]. These two methods
returned nearly identical results; we therefore restrict
our discussion to the Metagene data. Amino acids were
then categorized based on GC content, where GC content was measured by the relative proportion of Gs and
Cs among the synonymous codons for each amino acid
(for example, alanine has four synonymous codons; 10
of the 12 total bases (0.83) representing these codons
are either a G or C).
Proportional changes in amino acid usage, KEGG gene
category and pathway abundances, and core genome
representation in expressed and non-expressed gene
fractions were compared using chi-square tests. Mean
amino acid identities and expression ratios were compared using standard two-tailed t-tests. Significance was
determined at alpha <0.05 following Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons.
