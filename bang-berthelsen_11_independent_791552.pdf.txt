Abstract
Background: Several approaches have been developed for miRNA target prediction, including methods that
incorporate expression profiling. However the methods are still in need of improvements due to a high false
discovery rate. So far, none of the methods have used independent component analysis (ICA). Here, we developed
a novel target prediction method based on ICA that incorporates both seed matching and expression profiling of
miRNA and mRNA expressions. The method was applied on a cellular model of type 1 diabetes.
Results: Microrray profiling identified eight miRNAs (miR-124/128/192/194/204/375/672/708) with differential
expression. Applying ICA on the mRNA profiling data revealed five significant independent components (ICs)
correlating to the experimental conditions. The five ICs also captured the miRNA expressions by explaining >97%
of their variance. By using ICA, seven of the eight miRNAs showed significant enrichment of sequence predicted
targets, compared to only four miRNAs when using simple negative correlation. The ICs were enriched for miRNA
targets that function in diabetes-relevant pathways e.g. type 1 and type 2 diabetes and maturity onset diabetes of
the young (MODY).
Conclusions: In this study, ICA was applied as an attempt to separate the various factors that influence the mRNA
expression in order to identify miRNA targets. The results suggest that ICA is better at identifying miRNA targets
than negative correlation. Additionally, combining ICA and pathway analysis constitutes a means for prioritizing
between the predicted miRNA targets. Applying the method on a model of type 1 diabetes resulted in
identification of eight miRNAs that appear to affect pathways of relevance to disease mechanisms in diabetes.

Background
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding
RNAs that function as posttranscriptional regulators of
gene expression by mediating translational inhibition or
mRNA degradation. miRNA bind to “seed” sites, i.e.
stretches of 6-8 nucleotides in the 3’ untranslated region
(UTR) of their target mRNAs. miRNAs regulate various
cellular processes and appear to be involved in the
development of many diseases.
Most approaches for miRNA target identification rely
on either one or a combination of seed matching, site

accessibility and phylogenetic conservation [1]. In addition, some have incorporated target site location,
multiple target sites and expression profiling [1].
A number of target prediction methods use expression
profiling of both miRNA and mRNA expressions [2-5].
Most of the approaches are based on negative correlation, i.e. reciprocal expressions of miRNAs and their
degraded target mRNAs.
High-dimensional biological data, such as microarray
profiling data, are often interpreted as being composed
of sets of transcriptional- or activity programs that
explain some, or most, of the complexity in the data
[6-8]. Various methods are being applied on profiling
data e.g. principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering. In the last couple of years independent component analysis (ICA) has been extensively applied on

mRNA profiling data and recently, ICA was applied on
miRNA profiling data as well [9].
ICA is a computational method for separating mixed
independent signals and can be used to decompose the
expression matrix into independent components [10].
This decomposition has been shown to be informative
in several studies [11-15], and superior to clustering and
PCA [16-19]. Apparently, the representation of gene
expression as a mix of independent, possibly overlapping, transcriptional programs captures the differential
regulation of well-defined biological processes and metabolic pathways [19,20].
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an immune-mediated
disease characterized by insulin deficiency due to a
specific destruction of the pancreatic b-cells. Proinflammatory cytokines are involved in the destruction
through induction of apoptosis [21]. The endocrine
cells in the pancreatic islets all arise from the same
progenitor stem cell and the maturation of the different cell types is dependent on a number of factors,
such as transcription factors and miRNAs, that are
activated in a tightly regulated pattern [22,23]. One of
the central transcription factors in pancreatic development is Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx-1)
[24-26]. In the mature endocrine cells, Pdx-1 expression
is restricted to the b-cell, where it is important for
insulin expression [27].
In the present study, we have used a model of type
1 diabetes based on b-cell maturation and interleukin1b (IL-1b) sensitivity. In response to Pdx-1 induction
the cells progress from an immature to a mature b-cell
phenotype [28]. The b-cell maturation is accompanied
by an increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of IL-1b
that is reflected in both transcriptional and protein
expression patterns [29-31]. Genes regulated by Pdx1 are therefore believed to be involved in the acquired
IL-1b sensitivity, and identification of these genes
would provide knowledge about the mechanisms
underlying this b-cell specific trait. Interestingly, a
study investigating genomic targets of transcription
factors in a b-cell line suggested that several miRNAs
are under Pdx-1 regulation [32]. Furthermore, a number of miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation
of pancreatic development and b-cell differentiation
[22,33-36].
Here, we have developed a novel miRNA target prediction method that is based on ICA and combines seed
matching and expression profiling. We comprehensively
profiled both miRNA and mRNA expressions from the
type 1 diabetes model. ICA was applied on the mRNA
expression data for identification of miRNA targets. Our
method was compared to negative correlation. We validated our observations by use of pathway analysis and
human pancreatic islet preparations.

Results
b-cell specific gene expression

To confirm that the INSrab cells progressed from a
hybrid ab-like phenotype to a more mature b-cell phenotype upon Pdx-1 induction as seen in previous studies
[28,37], the expression levels of known insulin and Pdx1 dependent genes were examined using the array data
(Additional file 1). The observed expression profiles
were in agreement with insulin and Pdx-1 regulations
known from other studies.
The dox-induced Pdx-1 expression was examined
using qPCR and western blotting with mouse-specific
primers and antibody, respectively. We found that dox
treatment for 24 hours resulted in increased expression
of both Pdx-1 mRNA (33 fold, p < 0.05) and protein
(6 fold, p < 0.05) (Figure 1).
miRNAs differentially expressed in a model of type
1 diabetes

miRNA expression profiling resulted in identification of
eight miRNAs with differential expression in response
to Pdx-1 induction and/or IL-1b exposure. All eight
miRNAs (miR-124/128/192/194/204/375/672/708)
showed significant (p < 0.05) changes in expression
between conditions and/or time points (Figure 2A). The
eight miRNA expression profiles capture all three
experimental conditions: dox-induced Pdx-1 expression,
IL-1b exposure and time. For example, the miR672 expression decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with
time independent of Pdx-1 induction and/or IL-1b treatment. The reversed pattern was seen for miR-204,
though only for cells with induced Pdx-1 expression.

conditions. (C) The coefficient for the linear combination of the ICs giving the best fit of the miRNA expressions. The coefficients are scaled to
have an absolute sum of one.

A third example was the up-regulating effect of IL-1b
treatment on the expressions of miR-128/192/194.
The expression of two of the eight miRNAs were validated in a new set of samples using real-time quantitative
PCR. We found that the expression of miR-375 was significantly decreased in response to Pdx-1 induction (by
~50%, p < 0.05), whereas the miR-194 expression was significantly increased in response to IL-1b treatment (by
~50%, p < 0.05), see Figure 3. Furthermore, there was a
tendency towards a decreased miR-194 expression in
response to Pdx-1 induction (by ~50%, p = 0.05). These
expression changes confirmed the results from the array.
miRNA target prediction using negative correlation or ICA

To assess the effect of the Pdx-1- and IL-1b-mediated
miRNA activity, mRNAs were profiled in the same set
of samples as used for the miRNA arrays.

Initially, targets were predicted for each of the eight
miRNAs using 6mer seed matching. The total number
of 6mer seed matches for each miRNA is listed in
Table 1. For identification of miRNA targets using negative correlation, correlation coefficients were calculated
between each pair of miRNA and mRNA profiles and
the mRNAs were ordered according to these correlation
coefficients. Four of the eight miRNAs showed a significant enrichment of sequence predicted targets among
mRNAs with correlation coefficients close to -1 (q <
0.1), Table 1. Additional file 2 lists all calculated correlation coefficients.
Applying ICA on the mRNA expression data resulted
in identification of five highly significant ICs (Bonferroni
corrected q < 0.0001) with mixes shown in Figure 2B.
See Additional file 2 for all loads, as well as the method
section for further details on ICA.

miRNAs by testing the loads in IC 1 for enrichment of
predicted targets with seed matches for both miRNAs
(Additional file 3).
We found that the miRNA pairs miR-375/672, miR194/375, miR-192/375 and miR-124/194 had a significant regulatory effect (Bonferroni corrected q < 0.05)
when testing for enrichment of their common targets
in IC 1.
The miRNAs had small fold changes compared to the
fold changes of the mRNAs. Therefore it was not possible to apply ICA on the miRNA data or on a combination of the mRNA and miRNA expression matrices.
However, by forming a linear superposition of the ICs
we identified the major contributions from the ICs on
the miRNA expressions. Interestingly, all eight miRNAs
could be represented (percent variance explained >97%)
by a superposition of the five ICs, as shown in
Figure 2C (also see Additional file 4). The majority of
predicted miRNA targets were present in two or three
of the ICs. For example, miR-124 primarily has targets
in component 1 and 4, which both are Pdx-1 affected
components. Another example is miR-192 and miR194 that both have targets in component 1, 2 and 4,
which were affected by both Pdx-1 and IL-1b.

qPCR. Log2-transformed fold changes (mean and standard
deviation) between experimental and control condition after Pdx-1

For each of the eight miRNAs, the loads in each IC
were tested for enrichment of predicted targets with a
6mer seed match. Seven of the eight miRNAs (including all four identified by negative correlation) showed
a significant enrichment of sequence predicted targets
in the IC loads (q < 0.07), Table 1. Furthermore, we
analyzed IC 1 for cooperativity between each pair of

the 4th column are the lowest q-value found among the five significant ICs.

Independent components have clear biological profiles

To assess the biological relevance of the identified ICs,
we tested the ICs for enrichment of genes known to
be regulated by Pdx-1 or affected by IL-1b (Additional
file 5). Mixes of IC 1 clearly correlated with the induction of Pdx-1, and genes regulated by Pdx-1 were overrepresented in this IC (p < 0.047, data not shown).
Interestingly, one group had low negative loads and
another had high positive loads, indicating positive and
negative regulation by Pdx-1, respectively. Similarly, ICs
3 and 4 correlated with the presence or absence of IL1b. Specifically, IC 3 was enriched for known IL-1b
affected genes among genes with low negative load (p <
0.0021, data not shown), whereas IC 4 was enriched for
IL-1b affected genes with high positive load (p < 0.024,
data not shown).
In a similar manner, we tested the ICs for enrichment
of miRNA targets associated with metabolic or signalling
pathways, as annotated by KEGG [38] or by the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, http://www.broadinstitute.org). Specifically, we tested the genes with high
positive or low negative loads in each IC for overrepresentation of annotated pathway genes.
When using KEGG terms only, 25 pathways were significantly enriched for miRNA targets in the five ICs
(q < 0.05). The most significant and diabetes-relevant
pathways are shown in Figure 4 (all are listed in Additional file 6). Notable was the significance of genes with
low loads in IC 3 belonging to the T1D pathway. IC

3 had a clear correlation with stimulation of IL-1b.
Furthermore, the pathways maturity onset diabetes of
the young (MODY), type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus and
oxidative phosphorylation were significant. The first two
have an obvious relation to diabetes, and the oxidative
phosphorylation pathway has been shown to be related
to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes [39]. When using
MSigDB annotations, 150 pathways were significantly
enriched for miRNA targets belonging to the five ICs
(q < 0.05). A selection of the pathways is shown in Figure 4 (all are listed in Additional file 6). Since KEGG is
part of MSigDB it comes as no surprise that T2D,
MODY and oxidative phosphorylation again showed up
as significant. However, T1D did not show up as a significant pathway, probably due to correction of multiple
testing, since MSigDB is a much larger repository. Also,
dysregulation of genes involved in the p53 signaling
pathway have been suggested to sensitize the cells to
apoptotic stimuli [32,40]. In accordance with this, we
find genes annotated with the p53-signalling pathway
(using MSigDB) having significant low loads in IC 3.

found STAT3 binding sites in the promoter of the
human miR-124 gene. This interaction was supported
by ICA that showed that miR-124 and Stat3 both have
negative contribution from IC 1 (Additional file 2 and
Figure 2C) correlating with an up-regulation in response
to Pdx-1 induction. Interestingly, the 3’UTR of Stat3 has
seed matches for miR-124 (TargetScan and 6mer seed
matching), indicating a potential feedback loop.
Furthermore, we found positive and negative contribution from IC 1 for Pax6 and miR-124/128, respectively
(Additional file 2 and Figure 2C), meaning they have
reciprocal expressions (down-regulation of Pax6 and upregulation of miR-124/128) in response to Pdx-1 induction. Interestingly, the 3’UTR of Pax6 contains a 6mer
seed match for miR-128 indicating potential repression
of Pax6 by miR-128.

Identification of miRNA regulatory networks

miRNAs and mRNAs can interact in regulatory networks. miRNAs can regulate mRNAs directly or indirectly through secondary factors. Furthermore, mRNA
targets can act as transcription factors for miRNAs, thus
forming a regulatory loop.
Using a combined bioinformatics approach involving
seed matching, promoter analysis, text mining and ICA
we identified miRNA regulatory networks (Figure 5).
Using the miRNA database http://www.miRbase.org, we

Validation in human pancreatic islets and b-cell studies

To verify the identified miRNA targets affected by Pdx1 and/or cytokine stimulation, we used mRNA expression profiling data from studies on human pancreatic
islets and rat b-cell lines and tested whether the data
were enriched for ICA-identified targets of the eight
miRNAs.
Using mRNA profiling data from untreated and cytokine treated human pancreatic islet preparations
(unpublished data) we tested the cytokine-induced fold
changes for enrichment of predicted miRNA targets.
Interestingly, we found that predicted targets of miR128/192/194/204/375 were significantly up-regulated
in response to cytokine treatment as compared to nontargets (q = 0.007, q = 0.004, q = 0.033, q = 0.001 and

Bang-Berthelsen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:97
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/97

q = 0.05, respectively). The results suggest that the five
miRNAs may play a role in human pancreatic islets as
well.
Additionally, we performed similar analysis of publicly
available data from two previous studies on b-cells. Cardozo et al. [41] performed mRNA profiling on b-cells
from 10 weeks old male Wistar rats, un-stimulated or
stimulated with cytokines (IL-1b and/or IFNg). Using
their mRNA data, we found that targets of miR192 were significantly down-regulated in response to IL1b stimulation when comparing to non-targets (q =
0.02). Kutlu et al. [42] performed mRNA profiling on
insulin producing INS-1E cells, untreated or exposed to
a combination of IL-1b and IFNg. In their data set, we
found that the expressions of miR-128 targets were significant increased in response to cytokine exposure
when comparing to non-targets (q = 0.002).

Discussion
The motivation for applying a more advanced method
like ICA for miRNA target prediction than negative correlation was that surprisingly few mRNAs have clear
negative correlations with their targeting miRNAs. This
is probably due to the mRNA profiles being influenced
by a number of factors e.g. miRNA regulation, transcription factor binding and site accessibility. Here, ICA was
used as an attempt to filter the factors influencing
mRNA expression. Decomposition of microarray data
using ICA has been shown to outperform other linear
data representations, such as PCA [16-19]. Several target
prediction methods have incorporated miRNA and
mRNA profiling data. However, none of them uses ICA.
The miRNA array profiling identified eight miRNAs
with differential expression in a type 1 diabetes model.
Performing ICA on the mRNA expressions from the
same samples resulted in five ICs that correlated with the
experimental conditions studied. Comparing the two target prediction methods indicated that ICA was better at
capturing miRNA activity than negative correlation.
Seven miRNAs showed a significant enrichment of
sequence-predicted targets when using ICA, as compared
to only four by use of negative correlation. Interestingly,
the ICs were enriched for miRNA targets with functional
roles in diabetes-relevant pathways e.g. the pathways
T1D, T2D, MODY, oxidative phosphorylation, insulin,
cytokine-cytokine receptors and type 1 interferon. This
supports that the eight miRNAs are implicated in disease
mechanisms in diabetes. Additionally, targets of five of
the eight miRNAs were significantly regulated by cytokines in models of b-cell destruction e.g. in human islets.
miRNAs fine tune the expression of genes in a combinatorial manner, meaning that several miRNAs can target the same mRNA transcript [43]. Furthermore, a
cluster of co-expressed miRNAs can regulate

Page 6 of 11

functionally related genes [44]. In this study, we observe
small expression changes in the miRNAs. However,
even minute changes in miRNA expressions might have
impact on mRNA expression, and miRNAs acting in a
cooperative manner can most likely induce biologically
relevant expression changes in their targets. ICA can
uncover these more complex interactions. Interestingly,
it was recently suggested that cooperativity could be
incorporated for prediction of target interactions
between different miRNAs [1]. For the eight miRNAs
we identified, there is a significant overlap in the
mRNAs they target. We have incorporated cooperativity
between miRNAs pairwise and identified four miRNA
pairs (miR-375/672, miR-194/375, miR-192/375, miR124/194) that had a significant co-regulatory effect on
their common targets in IC 1.
Of the eight significant miRNAs, miR-124 and miR375 have previously been identified in b-cells
[33,35,45,46]. Further, the expression of miR-204 has
been shown to be induced in insulinomas, where its
expression correlated with insulin expression [47].
That miR-375 was significantly regulated strengthens
our model since a previous study observed interaction
between Pdx-1 (and NeuroD1) and the miR-375 locus
[32]. However, no Pdx-1 consensus binding sites were
identified, but binding elements for other transcription
factors have been identified in the miR-375 locus [48].
The decreased miR-375 expression could, at least in
part, be mediated through NeuroD1, since we observed
a decreased NeuroD1 expression in response to Pdx1 induction. Additionally, the decreased miR-375 expression is in agreement with miR-375 having a higher
expression level in non-b-cells than in b-cells [35]. This
is also supported by our findings in a-cells versus
b-cells (Additional file 7). Interestingly, both miR375 and Pax6, a key factor in a-cell development, had
negative loads in IC 1, i.e. both were down-regulated in
response to Pdx-1. The decreased miR-375 expression is
also in compliance with the function of miR-375 as a
negative regulator of insulin exocytosis [45], since it correlates with the need for an increased insulin secretion
in the mature b-cell phenotype. Similarly, miR-124 has
been shown to modulate insulin secretion by targeting
Foxa2 [33]. miR-194 is highly expressed in liver and in
intestinal epithelial cells, where it is under regulation by
Hnf1a [49,50]. Interestingly, Hnf1a is required for
proper b-cell function and mutations in this gene cause
MODY [23]. miR-192 is also expressed in the liver and
is in cluster with miR-194, suggesting co-regulation
[49,50]. Furthermore, miR-128 has been shown to
induce apoptosis in kidney cells through interaction
with Bax [51]. So far, miR-672 and miR-708 have not
been examined in b-cells. The likely involvement of
miR-128/192/194/204/708 in b-cell regulatory networks

Bang-Berthelsen et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:97

(Figure 5) and the high expression in b-cells compared
to a-cells for miR-672/204 (Additional file 7) make
them interesting candidates for further studies.
We have used ICA for bioinformatics investigation of
the functional roles of the miRNAs and their targets.
ICA in combination with pathway analysis indicates that
the eight miRNAs, through their mRNA targets, are
implicated in several diabetes relevant pathways.
The transcriptional changes mediated by miRNAs on
their targets may not be entirely explained by direct
repression but may also reflect indirect mechanisms
such as activation by feedback and feed-forward transcriptional loops within regulatory networks [52,53].
miRNAs can be important players in these networks.
By use of a combined bioinformatics approach we
identified miRNA regulatory networks. The results
suggest connections between seven of the eight miRNAs through interactions with key pancreatic transcription factors, cytokine signalling molecules and
insulin (Figure 5).

Conclusions
Using ICA, we have developed a novel miRNA target
prediction method that incorporates seed matching and
expression profiling. We believe that the method has
advantages compared to simple negative correlation.
Additionally, ICA in combination with bioinformatics
approaches such as pathway analysis constitutes a means
of prioritizing between the predicted miRNA targets for
further investigations. To the best of our knowledge this
is the first study that uses ICA for miRNA target prediction. Interestingly, applying the method on a model of
type 1 diabetes resulted in identification of eight miRNAs
that appear to directly or indirectly affect pathways of
relevance to disease mechanisms in diabetes.
Methods
Cell cultures

INSrab, bTC-3 and aTC-1 cells were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium (RPMI-1640 with Glutamax
(Gibco BRL, Paisley, Scotland, UK), 100 U/ml penicillin
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 10%
FBS. 50 μM b-mercaptoethanol was additionally added
to the INSrab cells. For the INSrab cells, TeT system
approved FBS (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used,
and the medium was supplemented with 150 μg/ml
geneticin and 100 μg/ml hygromycin to maintain a pure
culture of cells expressing the Pdx-1 plasmid construct.
The INSrab cells were treated with doxycycline
(500 ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) for
24 h to allow for Pdx-1 expression after which the cells
were cultured in the presence or absence of human
recombinant IL-1b (40 pg/ml; BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA) for additionally 2 h or 24 h.

Human pancreatic islet preparations

Human islet preparations (n = 4) provided through the
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Islet Distribution Program (JDRF award 6-2005-1178) by Islet
Cell Resource Centres in Milan (Italy) and Lille (France)
were treated for 48 hours with IL-1b (1 ng/ul) or a combination of IL-1b (1 ng/ul), IFNg (20 ng/ul) and TNFa
(8 ng/ul).
RNA extraction and RT-qPCR

Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was prepared using miScript reverse
transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), TaqMan
microRNA reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems), as described by the
manufacturer.
In INSrab cells (n = 5) the miRNA expression levels
were analysed by use of miScript Primer Assays (Qiagen), whereas in bTC-3 (n = 5) and aTC-1 (n = 5) cells
miRNA expressions were analysed using TaqMan
microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression
levels were analysed using TaqMan gene expression
assays (Applied Biosystems). All samples were analyzed
in duplicates on a ABI 7900HT system (Applied Biosystems). Data were evaluated using the 2 -ΔΔCt method
[54], normalizing miRNA/gene expressions to an endogenous control, and subsequently comparing each
miRNA/gene in treated vs. un-stimulated cells. miRNAs
were normalized to let-7c, whereas genes were normalized to Ppia. The coefficient of variation (CV) for miScript assays ranged from 0.018 to 0.077.
Western blotting

The INSrab cells (n = 4) were washed with PBS and
lysed. The protein concentrations of whole cell protein
lysates were measured with Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Samples were boiled before loading on a NuPage gel (10%
BisTris gels, Invitrogen) placed in an X-Cell Surelock
system (Invitrogen). Proteins were separated and then
transferred to a pre-soaked nitrocellulose membrane
(Invitrogen), which was blocked in milk for one hour
and then washed. The membrane was incubated in a
5 ml milk solution containing primary antibody, either
monoclonal Pdx-1 mouse antibody [37] overnight or
monoclonal mouse b-actin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA; #ab6276) for one hour. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Cell signalling,
#7076) were used as secondary antibodies. The membrane was incubated in LumiGlo (Cell Signialing Technology, Danvers, MA) solution and visualized using the
LAS2000 system (Fujifilm Europa GmbH, Dusseldorf,
Germany).

Profiling and preprocessing of array data

program in each sample. Two-way clustering of correlated genes and samples into non-overlapping sets was

represented by component vectors C t with discrepant
sets of non-vanishing entries

The mRNA expressions from INSrab cells (n = 4) were
profiled on Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays. For
each probeset in each sample, log2-ratios were calculated between the expression of that probeset and the
average of the control samples.
The miRNA expressions from INSrab cells (n = 3)
were profiled on Exiqon miRCURY LNA microRNA
Array v.11.0 arrays and median normalized. The control
samples (n = 3) were pooled and used as a common
reference on all arrays, and log2-ratios were calculated
for each sample against this reference.
The mRNA expressions from human islet preparations
(n = 4) were analyzed on Affymetrix Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. The b-cell data from Refs. [41]
and [42] were downloaded from T1DBase http://www.
t1dbase.org. These mRNA expressions had been profiled
using the Affymetrix Rat Genome U34A array.
All CEL-files were preprocessed using the RMA package [55] in Bioconductor [56] with remapped Ensembl
build 50 gene probesets [57].
For mRNA data from human islets and published
b-cell studies, foldchanges log2(cytokine, 24 h)/
(untreated, 24 h) were calculated for the average of the
replicate samples in each condition.
Sequence based miRNA target prediction

For 7764 out of the 9953 Ensembl gene probesets analyzed, 3’UTR sequences could be downloaded from
Ensembl through Biomart [58]. Mature sequences of significantly changed miRNAs were downloaded from miRbase [59] and the 6mer seed matches extracted. Ensembl
gene probesets with a given miRNA 6mer seed match in
their 3’UTR were identified as targets of that miRNA.
Independent component analysis

Mathematically, T transcriptional programs are active in
the cells under study, each of which is a (column) vector

C t , t = 1, .., T , representing G t gene inductions or
repressions. We measure all G induced or repressed
genes in S samples.
Each of these programs can be identified by a simple
linear decomposition of the G × S expression matrix E,
T

E = CM or E gs =

M is the T × S matrix giving the linear mixing of each

C gt ≠ 0 ⇔ C gj ≈ 0 ∀ j ≠ t .

ICA extracts n = min{G, S} independent components.
Since the number of samples was much lower than the
number of genes, we assumed n = S. The number of interesting transcriptional programs T may be equal to, or
lower than S. A common practice is to project E onto it’s
first O principal component directions, and then extract O
independent components in this subspace. This approach
has several important drawbacks. First, the number of
interesting transcriptional programs is not known beforehand, and one therefore needs to guess or resort to a
recursive trial-and-error approach to choose an O that
allows all T transcriptional programs to be extracted. Second, it is not obvious that a projection onto O <S principal
component directions preserves all T transcriptional programs. It is possible to construct examples where two clusters in the data are only well separated in the subspace of
the first and last principal components [60]. Clustering in
a subspace spanned by principal components generally
degrades cluster quality [61]. Finally, even when a projection onto T principal components allows all the T interesting transcriptional programs to be extracted by ICA, a way
to explore and rank these independent components to
clarify their significance is still needed. In the present
study, the independent components were ranked according to their accordance with the experimental conditions.
The fastICA algorithm [62,63] in R http://www.R-project.org was used to estimate the component matrix and
mixing matrix, by numeric maximization of the negentropy of the independent components. The negentropy
was approximated by J(y) = (〈G(y)〉 - 〈G(v)〉)2, where y is
the distribution of loads, v is a random variable distributed as ℵ(0,1), and the contrast function G(u) was here
⎛ 2 ⎞
defined as G(u) = -exp ⎜ -u ⎟ . By convention, the
⎝ 2 ⎠
loads in each component have mean 0 and variance 1.
Assuming that the individual contributions on mRNA
expression are linearly separable and reasonable independent of each other, ICA can separate the various
contributions making it possible to detect pathways
regulated by the various miRNAs.
ICs with mixes, i.e. rows in M showing significant
changes between the experimental conditions and/or
time points, are identified by calculating F-statistics and
requiring Bonferroni corrected p-values less than 0.0001.

Statistics

Overall expression data were analysed using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA; F-statistics). The eight
significant miRNAs were selected based on an overall
q-value < 0.1 (Additional file 8). Comparison between
groups was done using t-test. Correction for multiple
testing was performed either by applying a Bonferroni
or a false discovery rate (fdr) correction to the p-values
(q-value). A Bonferroni correction was chosen when
few tests were performed, as was the case for the finding of significant ICs and miRNAs. When a larger
number of tests were performed a fdr correction was
applied.
The loads in each IC are considered non-Gaussian
distributed. Loads/fold changes for genes that had seed
match for the miRNAs or were assigned to a specific
biological pathway were analysed using Wilcoxon rank
sum test. For analysis of negative correlation, Pearson
correlation coefficients were calculated between each
pair of miRNA and mRNA profiles. The mRNAs were
then ordered according to these correlation coefficients.
P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
