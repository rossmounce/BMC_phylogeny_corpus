Abstract
Background: The condensation of chromosomes and correct sister chromatid segregation during
cell division is an essential feature of all proliferative cells. Structural maintenance of chromosomes
(SMC) and non-SMC proteins form the condensin I complex and regulate chromosome
condensation and segregation during mitosis. However, due to the lack of appropriate mutants, the
function of the condensin I complex during vertebrate development has not been described.
Results: Here, we report the positional cloning and detailed characterization of retinal phenotypes
of a zebrafish mutation at the cap-g locus. High resolution live imaging reveals that the progression
of mitosis between prometa- to telophase is delayed and that sister chromatid segregation is
impaired upon loss of CAP-G. CAP-G associates with chromosomes between prometa- and
telophase of the cell cycle. Loss of the interaction partners CAP-H and CAP-D2 causes cytoplasmic
mislocalization of CAP-G throughout mitosis. DNA content analysis reveals increased genomic
imbalances upon loss of non-SMC condensin I subunits. Within the retina, loss of condensin I
function causes increased rates of apoptosis among cells within the proliferative ciliary marginal
zone (CMZ) whereas postmitotic retinal cells are viable. Inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis
partially rescues cell numbers in cap-g mutant retinae and allows normal layering of retinal cell types
without alleviating their aberrant nuclear sizes.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the condensin I complex is particularly important within
rapidly amplifying progenitor cell populations to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. In
contrast, differentiation of postmitotic retinal cells is not impaired upon polyploidization.

Background
SMC family proteins [1,2] are essential regulators of chromosomal organization in mitotic and meiotic cell cycles
and control sister chromatid cohesion and separation,
mitotic condensation, recombinational repair, and chromosome-wide gene regulation [3,4]. Two SMC proteins,
SMC2 and SMC4, heterodimerize to form an active
ATPase at the core of condensin I and condensin II protein
complexes that are essential for the condensation and stability of chromosomes during mitosis in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans [5-8]. In addition to the SMC2/
SMC4 core proteins, the condensin I complex contains the
kleisin subunit CAP-H and the two HEAT domain proteins CAP-D2 and CAP-G. The non-SMC subunits of the
condensin complexes have been proposed to activate
DNA supercoiling and looping activity of the SMCATPases and to play essential roles in directing the association of the condensin holocomplex onto chromosomes
at the correct mitotic stage [4,6]. Components of the condensin I complex are cytoplasmic during interphase and
are targeted to chromatin after the breakdown of the
nuclear membrane during prometaphase through the A
kinase-anchoring protein AKAP95 [9,10].
In budding and fission yeasts as well as in Xenopus laevis
egg extracts, condensin has an important chromosome
condensation activity [11-13]. In budding yeast, loss of
any component of the condensin complex causes chromosome condensation and segregation defects [2,13-18].
Similarly, in HeLa cells, depletion of either condensin I or
condensin II subunits causes defective chromosome condensation. This effect is enhanced upon simultaneous
depletion of subunits from both complexes [19]. In C. elegans and Drosophila, loss of condensin subunits results in
the formation of chromosome bridges due to the failure
of sister chromatids to separate completely during anaphase [20-23]. In contrast to sister chromatid segregation,
the compaction of chromosomes in metazoan organisms
is not entirely dependent on condensin complexes.
Genetic analyses of different SMC and non-SMC subunits
in several metazoan organisms have demonstrated that
chromosomal compaction occurs in the absence of condensin [21,23-30].
In addition to their roles in mitosis, condensin complexes
have been shown to regulate transcriptional expression by
modulating heterochromatin function during interphase
[16,21,22,31-33]. In comparison, the in vivo analysis of
condensin function in vertebrates has been scarce. Overexpression of More than blood (MTB), the murine
homolog of the condensin II subunit CAP-G2, in murine
erythroleukemia cells promotes their erythroid differentiation [34]. A mutation at the murine condensin II kleisin
β locus (cap-h2) disrupts T-cell differentiation [35]. To

date, vertebrate mutants of condensin I complex components have not been described.
In this study, we report the positional cloning and
detailed phenotypic characterization of the zebrafish capg mutation. Functional analysis of CAP-G and of its interaction partners CAP-H and CAP-D2 reveals that the condensin I complex ensures the correct segregation of
chromosomes during mitosis and maintains the diploid
state. Within the retina, proliferative cells in the ciliary
marginal zone (CMZ) are particularly sensitive to the loss
of the condensin I protein complex, resulting in increased
apoptotic cell death whereas postmitotic cells differentiate and are viable. Survival and laminar organization of
condensin I complex deficient retinal cells are partially
restored upon inhibition of p53-mediated apoptotic cell
death, whereas abnormal ploidy levels remain
unchanged. These findings imply that differentiation of
retinal cells is not impaired upon polyploidization.

Results
The zebrafish creature from the black lagoon (cbl) locus
encodes the condensin I protein CAP-G
The cbls105 mutant allele was isolated in a screen for retinal
and behavioral mutants [36,37]. Whereas trunk and tail
regions are of normal size, cbls105 mutants show a severe
size reduction of the retina and head compared with wildtype embryos (Figure 1A). We first focused our attention
on retinal organization between 3–5 days post fertilization (dpf). Due to the great temporal precision with which
the different cell layers are formed during development
and due to the availability of cell type specific markers, we
could efficiently analyze the organization of this tissue
[38]. Among the three major cell-body layers of which the
retina is composed of, the innermost layer consists of ganglion cells (GCL) which are the earliest retinal cell population to differentiate (Figure 1B). The intermediate
nuclear layer (INL) consists of amacrine, bipolar and horizontal cells. Finally, the outermost layer contains the
photoreceptor cells (PRL) which are the latest differentiating neurons within the retina. In cbls105 mutant retinae,
the typical organization and specification of several major
retinal cell types and overall retinal patterning was apparently preserved, as assessed using two specific markers for
differentiated neurons (Figure 1B, C). Strikingly, the
number of retinal cells within each of the three layers was
severely reduced by more than half (see below). This finding suggested a role of the cbl locus in proliferation or survival of all retinal cell types.

Using a positional cloning strategy, we mapped cbl to linkage group 1. Fine mapping of the locus with an F2 mapping panel using a simple-sequence-polymorphismmarker-based map, revealed that the mutation was positioned within a critical interval defined by markers z7287

(1/2982 recombinants) and 25.11 (16/2982 recombinants). By alignment of genes within the genomic
region, we found synteny with Tetraodon and human
genomic sequences which led to the prediction that slit2
should be present within the interval. This resulted in the
identification of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
zK148F2 and allowed the assembly of overlapping BACs
that covered the entire unknown interval (ending with
zC209P5a). Subsequently, we failed to detect any recombinants out of 2982 meioses for a marker that was based
on a BAC within this interval (zK148F2b) (Figure 2A).
Analysis of this BAC using Genscan http://genes.mit.edu/
GENSCAN.html did not reveal the presence of any open

reading frames (ORFs), but five ORFs were predicted
within the overlapping BAC clone zK215B13. Among
these was an ORF encoding a protein with high similarity
to human and other eukaryotic condensin I complex subunit CAP-G orthologs, the function of which was well in
line with an involvement in cell proliferation (Figure 2B)
[see Additional file 1]. Sequencing of the genomic cbls105
locus revealed a C-to-T base change which creates a premature stop codon causing a predicted truncation of the
CAP-G protein at position 493 (Figure 2C, D). This finding was confirmed by sequencing of full-length cDNA
from mutant and wild-type sibling embryos. Thus, the
mutation in the cbls105 locus results in a protein that lacks

The zebrafish cap-g gene is mutated in s105

s105 mutation generates a premature stop codon (red asterisk) that truncates more than half of the protein. (E) Comparison
of cap-g expression with that of pcna by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Overlapping expression with pcna within the brain,
the CMZ of the retina, which contains retinal stem cells, and within neuromasts of the lateral line organ (white asterisks) indicates that cap-g is required within proliferative cells.

more than 50% of the normal protein, including several
predicted HEAT domains and, therefore, most likely
results in a complete loss of function. In situ hybridizations showed that between 3–5 dpf, cap-g is strongly
expressed within the neural retina and CNS in a pattern
that is overlapping with proliferative cell nuclear antigen
(pcna), a gene expressed within proliferative cells (Figure
2E).
The presence of maternally derived mRNA and probably
also protein of condensin I complex components could
mask their earliest developmental functions during blastula and gastrula stages [see Additional file 2]. It has been

shown that maternal cell cycle gene deposits can last over
a week especially in slowly dividing cells of the trunk and
tail region [39]. To further verify that the cbl locus encodes
CAP-G, we generated an ATG-directed antisense oligonucleotide morpholino (MO) that caused the same mitotic
phenotypes as observed in cbls105 mutants (see
below)[40]. However, consistent with an interference of
this MO with maternal cap-g mRNA translation, cap-g
morphant embryos displayed mitotic defects already during gastrula stages which preceded those of cbls105 mutants
that occurred after somitogenesis stages. Moreover, cap-g
morphants died during early somitogenesis (wild-type, n
= 0/52 embryos dead at 24 hpf; cap-g morphants, n = 41/

49 embryos dead at 24 hpf) [see Additional file 3]. In
summary, these results establish that cbls105 is a severe
mutant allele at the zebrafish cap-g locus, which we subsequently refer to as cap-gs105. Moreover, maternally provided cap-g mRNA stores persist at least through early
embryogenesis and are sufficient to ensure development
through gastrulation/early segmentation stages.
Loss of CAP-G causes a severe reduction in retinal cell
numbers, which is partly caused by p53-mediated
apoptosis

are located within the proliferative zone of the retina, the

involved in proliferation and neurogenesis within capgs105 mutants, we performed in situ hybridizations. At 3
dpf, pcna is expressed exclusively within the CMZ (Figure
3A). Similar to the expression in wild-type, pcna was correctly expressed in the CMZ of cap-gs105 mutants. Expression of elavl3, which is a marker of differentiated ganglion
cells of the innermost retinal layer and of amacrine cells
in the INL at 3–5 dpf [42], was not affected in cap-gs105
mutants. These results indicated that the pattern of neurogenesis is not altered upon loss of CAP-G. Moreover, the

vibratome sections of 4 dpf retinae stained against activated caspase 3 to detect apoptotic cells (red) and nuclei counterstained

to the CMZ which indicates that proliferative cells are eliminated. (D) Transverse vibratome sections of embryonic retinae
counterstained with phalloidin to visualize plexiform layers (red) and propidium iodide (green). cap-gs105 mutants injected with

Propidium iodide stained transverse retinal sections were used to determine average counts for wildtype (n = 9 section planes, 5 embryos), cap-gs105 mutants (n = 11 section planes, 7 embryos) or cap-gs105 mutant/p53 morphants
(n = 9 section planes, 6 embryos). The average sum of cap-gs105 mutant retinal cells is reduced by 65% compared with wild-type.
In comparison, the average sum of cap-gs105 mutant/p53 morphant retinal cells is reduced only by 43% compared with wildtype. Therefore, the severe reduction in retinal cell numbers is in part caused by p53-mediated apoptosis. Data represent average cell numbers per retina ± SD.

not generally delayed in cap-gs105 mutants. Therefore, loss
of retinal cell number in cap-gs105 mutants is likely not
caused by transcriptional silencing of genes involved in
proliferation or differentiation as assessed by several
markers (pcna, elavl3, zpr-1, zn5, zrf-1).
The severe reduction of eye and head regions in cap-gs105
mutants led us to examine whether proliferation was
affected. To this end, we stained mitotic cells with an antibody against phosphorylated histone H3 (PH3) to label
mitotic nuclei. At 30 hours post fertilization (hpf), there
was no significant difference in the number of mitotic
cells throughout the entire embryo between wild-type
(278 ± 43 mitotic cells) and mutants (229 ± 33 mitotic
cells; p > 0.05). In contrast, apoptotic events were much
more frequent in cap-gs105 mutants compared to wild-type,
as assayed by staining with acridine orange. Analysis of 24
hpf retinae revealed that many PH3-positive mitotic cells
displayed TUNEL positive apoptotic nuclei (Figure 3B). At
later stages, we detected cell death using an antibody
against activated caspase 3 and found that apoptosis was
largely restricted to the proliferative CMZ of the neural retina which suggests that proliferative retinal progenitor
cells are primarily affected by loss of CAP-G, whereas postmitotic and terminally differentiated cells of the retina are
viable (Figure 3C). This observation prompted us to test
whether suppression of apoptotic cell death via inactivation of p53 would rescue the cap-gs105 mutant phenotype
[43]. Indeed, injection of 150 μM MOp53 led to a significant increase in cell numbers throughout all retinal cell
layers within cap-gs105 embryos at 3 dpf, which were identified by PCR genotyping (Figure 3D, E). Only regions
with a clear separation of the INL, GCL and PRL were
assessed in this analysis. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that CAP-G is required in proliferative rather
than in postmitotic differentiated cells. Moreover, the
severe reduction in retinal cell numbers is, in part, caused
by p53-mediated apoptosis.
Loss of CAP-G causes increased adhesion of sister
chromatids during anaphase and aberrant nuclear sizes
and shapes
To elucidate the potential role of CAP-G in zebrafish chromosome condensation and mitosis, we employed a transgenic line of zebrafish which expresses a Histone2A::GFP
fusion protein (Tg [H2A::GFP]) for high-resolution confocal live imaging of these processes during development
[44]. Transgenic embryos were co-injected with MOcap-g
and MOp53 to avoid both specific and non-specific apoptosis caused by MOcap-g injection. During gastrula stages
(between 70%-epiboly and tailbud stages), embryos were
imaged within the animal cap region of the gastrula.
Clearly, the dynamics of mitotic divisions was significantly perturbed upon loss of CAP-G (Figure 4A). Most
strikingly, during ana- and telophase the distance of sister

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/40

chromatids was strongly reduced in cap-g morphants and
chromatids were abnormally shaped (Figure 4A).
To solidify our findings from morphants, we next tested
whether similar mitotic defects could be observed in capgs105 mutant embryos. To this end, we analyzed nuclear
divisions by high-resolution live imaging at 32 hpf in Tg
[H2A::GFP] transgenic embryos that were PCR genotyped
(n = 3 cap-gs105 mutant embryos analyzed). We focused on
the ventricular highly proliferative zone of the CNS at the
hindbrain level. Analysis of mitotic stages revealed that in
wild-type embryos, the progression from prometa- to anaphase takes between 7–12 minutes (0% of mitoses
delayed, n = 39 mitoses analyzed) (Figure 4B) [see Additional file 4]. In cap-gs105 mutants, the progression from
prometa- to anaphase was frequently delayed to 12–18
minutes (58.3% of mitoses delayed to >12 minutes, n =
24 mitoses analyzed) (Figure 4B) [see Additional file 5].
Taken together, live imaging demonstrates that the
zebrafish CAP-G protein is an essential player in chromatid segregation during mitosis. Moreover, loss of CAP-G
affects the timely progression of mitosis from prometa- to
telophase.
CAP-G is required for the maintenance of correct nuclear
sizes and shapes
Since chromatid segregation is delayed during mitosis in
CAP-G deficient embryos, we investigated nuclear shapes
and sizes in cap-gs105 mutants. As expected for a failure of
sister chromatids to completely segregate, we found that
cap-gs105 mutant retinal cells at 3 dpf contained many
nuclei that appeared larger compared with those of wildtype and quantified those differences (Table 1). Moreover,
many examples of non-disjunction events between neighboring nuclei were observed which provided further evidence for chromatid separation defects during mitosis
(Figure 4C, red asterisks). Analysis of nuclei within the tail
region also revealed the presence of chromosome segregation defects in cap-gs105 mutants (Figure 4C). To quantify
morphological differences between wild-type and capgs105 mutant retinal nuclei, we performed nuclear circularity measurements. In the wild-type retina most nuclei in
the PRL have an elongated appearance. In cap-gs105 mutant
retinae, significant deviations from wild-type nuclear
shapes were detected in the PRL (Figure 4D), which in part
is rescued by injection of MOp53. Together, these findings
show that CAP-G is essential for the maintenance of correct nuclear sizes and shapes.

directed MOs for functional studies. Injection of MOcap-h
or MOcap-d2 caused phenotypes that were indistinguishable from cap-gs105 mutants (Figure 5). Retinal patterning in
cap-h or cap-d2 morphants was preserved, although the
number of retinal cells within each of the three layers was
severely reduced. Moreover, nuclei within cap-h or cap-d2
morphant retinal cells were of highly irregular shapes and
enlarged, similar to the phenotypes observed upon loss of

CAP-G. The phenotypic similarities between the different
mutants and morphants suggest that a single condensin I
complex is present in zebrafish.
To test the functional conservation of CAP-D2 and CAP-H
within the zebrafish condensin I complex, we generated
an expression construct encoding a fusion protein

the dynamics of CAP-G localization during mitosis in gastrula stage embryos. In wild-type, CAP-G-mcherry translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus at the onset of
prometaphase, concurrently with the breakdown of the
nuclear envelope. The fusion protein associated with separating chromatids during anaphase and subsequently,
during telophase, disappeared from the decondensing
chromatids (Figure 6) [see Additional file 6]. Failure to
associate with its physical interaction partners CAP-H or
CAP-D2 in MOcap-h+cap-d2 injected embryos resulted in the
cytoplasmic mislocalization of the fusion protein
throughout the mitotic cycle (Figure 7B). High resolution
confocal imaging of mitoses revealed the presence of

zebrafish condensin I complex.
Loss of the condensin I complex causes polyploidization
To test whether the observed changes in nuclear shapes
and sizes could be attributed to polyploidization as a consequence of chromatid segregation defects, we measured
the genomic content of wild-type, cap-gs105, cap-h morphant, cap-h/p53 double morphant, or cap-d2/p53 double
morphant retinal cells at 72 hpf by flow cytometry (Figure
4E; Table 2). At this stage, there is little proliferation
which could mask the presence of aneuploid and polyploid cells in G1/0. This analysis demonstrated a significant and comparable increase in the percentage of retinal
cells with a genomic content of 4C (1C = haploid genome
equivalent) in all mutant/morphant combinations as
compared to wild-type (Table 2). This increase could
either be attributed to polyploidy or to G2/M phase arrest.
As inability of cells to exit G2/M typically corresponds to
an increase in mitotic nuclei [45], we used the anti-PH3
antibody to label and count mitotic nuclei at 72 hpf in
cap-gs105 mutants. By this analysis, we could confirm that
the mitotic index (MI) was low and statistically not significantly different between retinae of both genotypes [wildtype: MI = 0.3% ± 0.2% standard deviation (SD), n = 22/
6683 mitotic/total retinal cells; cap-gs105: MI = 0.5% ±
0.5% SD, n = 12/2869 mitotic/total retinal cells; p > 0.05,
not significant]. These results argue against G2/M arrest in
cap-gs105 mutants and confirm that mitotic events are too
few to account for the significant increase of 4C content
nuclei. Together, these findings suggest that loss of the
condensin I complex results in accumulation of polyploid, and, to a lesser degree, aneuploid cells.

Discussion
We have reported the first functional analysis of the condensin I complex in a vertebrate organism. The lack of
other homologs of cap-g, cap-h and cap-d2 within the
zebrafish genome and phenotypic similarities between
the appropriate mutants and morphants suggests that a
single condensin I complex is present in zebrafish. Highresolution live imaging of mitoses in cap-gs105 mutants

and cap-g morphants revealed that progression through
mitosis is delayed and that chromatid segregation defects
occur during anaphase. Together these findings confirm a
role of the condensin I complex that is conserved between
zebrafish and other eukaryotic organisms. Our analysis
has extended previous studies from other eukaryotic
model systems in demonstrating that the loss of CAP-G,
CAP-H or CAP-D2 causes aberrant sizes and shapes of ret-

inal cell nuclei most likely caused by tetraploidization.
This is rather a direct effect of chromosomal non-disjunction during anaphase than G2/M arrest, as levels of mitotic
cells do not increase upon loss of condensin I subunits, as
would be expected in case of the latter [45].
In our analysis of the condensin I complex we have
focused on retinal development since retinal patterning

and proliferation have been well described [38]. The neural retina is a tissue which is largely derived from a small
pool of highly proliferative progenitor cells that are
located within the CMZ region [41]. We could show that
expression of cap-g, cap-h and cap-d2 correlates with the
expression of pcna which marks regions of cell proliferation within the retina. In comparison, there was no overlap with the expression of elavl3, a late stage marker of
neurogenesis, which indicates that cap-g, cap-h and cap-d2
expression is down-regulated upon differentiation. We
also showed that loss of CAP-G had no effect on the transcriptional expression of pcna or elavl3, indicating that the
severe loss of cell number within the neural retina is not
caused by transcriptional silencing of genes involved in
proliferation or neurogenesis. Moreover, since several
neuronal differentiation markers are correctly expressed,
we could not detect any obvious developmental consequences caused by tetraploidization.
Our observation that some mitoses are delayed until their
elimination by the apoptotic machinery suggests that this
probably is a major cause of death among retinal cells. In
a recent study, Plaster and colleagues showed that loss of
the DNA polymerase delta catalytic subunit 1 compro-

mises DNA replication, which is followed by apoptosis.
Similar to our study, they reported that knockdown of
p53 led to a phenotypic rescue of mutants which suggests
that p53 eliminates cells that are stalled within the cell
cycle but that otherwise can finish their developmental
program [46]. Our observation that loss of p53 does not
completely prevent the massive reduction of retinal cells
in cap-gs105 mutants indicates that other forms of cell
death or a generally slowed proliferation rate affect the retina.

Conclusion
Our study of the zebrafish cap-g mutant has revealed an
essential function of the condensin I complex in rapidly
proliferating progenitor cells of the retina and for the
maintenance of the diploid state of cell types throughout
the entire embryo. Our work has extended previous studies performed in invertebrate models or tissue culture systems to the vertebrate organismal level and has enabled us
to characterize the effects of polyploidization on differentiation processes within the entire embryo. A recent report
has demonstrated that the Drosophila Retinoblastoma
family protein 1 Rbf1 physically interacts with dCap-D3
and is required for efficient localization of dCap-D3 with
chromatin [30]. This interaction has uncovered a potentially important mechanism by which the inactivation of
Rbf members contributes to genome instability which is a
hallmark of many tumors. Consistent with this finding,
mutations in SMC2 and SMC4 subunits were found in
several cases of pyothorax-associated lymphoma [47] and
loss of heterozygosity at the Cap-D3 locus is frequently
associated with breast cancer [48]. As we have now
reported similar genomic instability defects in cap-g
mutants, it is tempting to speculate that the loss of nonSMC condensin I components will find a similar correlate
with tumorigenesis.

Methods
Fish maintenance and stocks
Zebrafish were maintained at standard conditions.
Embryos were staged by hpf at 28.5°C and fixed at desired
timepoints using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. The
following fish strains were used: wild type AB, wild-type
WIK, Tg [H2A::GFP] [44]. The cbls105 mutation (Tüpfel
longfin background) was isolated during an ethyl-nitrosourea mutagenesis screen performed in the laboratory of
Herwig Baier [36,37].
Mapping, cloning and genotyping of cap-gs105 mutants
To map the cap-gs105 locus, F2 embryos from a mapping
cross between heterozygous carriers of the cap-gs105 allele
(Tüpfel longfin) and wild-type (WIK) homozygotes were
genotyped using a panel of 2982 F2 homozygous mutant
embryos. The ZFIN gene names of the condensin I complex genes are as follows: cap-g, [ZFIN:si:dkeyp-26a9.1];

Antibodies, immunohistochemistry and sections
Antibody stainings were performed as previously
described [49]. The following antibodies were used: rabbit
anti-activated caspase 3 (1:200, BD Pharmingen), rabbit
anti-phosphorylated histone 3 (1:1000, Upstate Biotechnology), zn5 to label ganglion cells (1:1000, Oregon
Monoclonal Bank), zpr1 to label red/green double cones
(1:200, Oregon Monoclonal Bank). Nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide or DAPI (both 1:1000).
Phalloidin labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 was used to mark
actin (1:100, Molecular Probes). For sectioning, stained
embryos were postfixed over night at 4°C in 2%PFA, 0.3
M sucrose. Embryos were embedded in 4% low melting
agarose and sectioned on a Leica VT1000 Vibratome. Confocal images were obtained using the Zeiss LSM 510 Meta
confocal microscope with a 63× oil lens and zoom 1–3×.
Whole embryos were documented under a Leica MZFLIII
stereomicroscope using the 1× and 4× objectives with 5–

processed using Photoshop (Adobe).
In situ hybridization
Whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out as

DNA content analysis and apoptosis detection
For a single preparation, approx. 50 embryos were collected in E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/9/40

mM CaCl2, 0.33 mM MgSO4), deyolked in 1/2 Fish
Ringer without Calcium (55 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM KCl, 1.25
mM NaHCO3), and washed with Hanks. Retinae dissociated from the embryo proper after 20 min incubation
with 0.25% trypsine at 4°C. Single cell suspension was
achieved after 20–30 min trypsine treatment and nuclei
were stained with propidium iodide according to Shepard
et al. [51]. Profiles were recorded on a FACS Canto II flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Analysis was carried out
with CellQuest Pro for n = 4 independent experiments for
each condition. Standard deviations and probabilities
associated with Student's t-test (2-tailed, paired) were calculated using Microsoft Exel software.
The TUNEL assay was performed on cryosections using
the "Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated
dUTP Nick End labelling" and the "In situ cell death detection kit, TMR red or Fluorescein" according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche).
Time-lapse analysis and live imaging
For time-lapse analysis, embryos were embedded in 1.5%
low melting agarose (NuSieve GFT agarose; Cambrex).
Spontaneous movements of embryos at 32 hpf were
reduced with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Tricaine)
(Sigma). Tg[H2A::GFP] transgenic embryos were imaged
on the Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope using
40× magnification and a capture rate of 1 frame per either
30 seconds or 60 seconds. Data were collected and analyzed using Zeiss LSM software. Individual image files
were cropped and processed using Photoshop (Adobe)
and the movies were assembled using ImageJ software.
Nuclear circularity and cross section area measurements
Confocal sections of retinae taken at 63× magnification,
0.7× zoom at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels with a
Zeiss LSM 510 Meta were first processed with Photoshop
software (Adobe) and subsequently imported into Image
J software http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/ for further analysis of
particle measurements for circularity and area. Area sizes
were converted from pixels to μm2 by recalculating measurements taken from the original LSM images. In total,
properties of 100–200 nuclei per cell layer and condition
were analyzed with Microsoft Excel software. Significance
of differences in between nuclei of different conditions
was assessed by Student's t-test (2-tailed, unpaired, unequal variance). Circularity values for nuclei range between
1.0 (perfectly round) and 0.0 (stretched line).
Mitotic cell count and Immunohistochemistry with αPhospho-Histone H3
Analysis was performed according to Shepard et al. [45].
Mitotic cells were counted for only one side of the
embryo. Probabilities were calculated in Excel using t-test
(2-tailed, unpaired).

highly proliferative tissues. Comparison of cap-g, cap-h and cap-d2
expression with that of pcna by whole-mount in situ hybridization. All
genes display overlapping expression patterns throughout early development. Expression at the 512-cell stage indicates a strong maternal contribution. At 24 hpf, condensin I genes are most strongly expressed within
brain, retina and spinal cord. Within the retina, expression of condensin
I genes is within the CMZ which contains the retinal stem cells whereas
expression is absent within postmitotic differentiated retinal cells.
