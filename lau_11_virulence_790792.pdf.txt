Abstract
Background: Laribacter hongkongensis is associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s
diarrhea. In this study, we performed an in-depth annotation of the genes in its genome related to the various
steps in the infective process, drug resistance and mobile genetic elements.
Results: For acid and bile resistance, L. hongkongensis possessed a urease gene cassette, two arc gene clusters and
bile salt efflux systems. For intestinal colonization, it possessed a putative adhesin of the autotransporter family
homologous to those of diffusely adherent Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterotoxigenic E. coli. To evade from host
defense, it possessed superoxide dismutase and catalases. For lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, it possessed the
same set of genes that encode enzymes for synthesizing lipid A, two Kdo units and heptose units as E. coli, but
different genes for its symmetrical acylation pattern, and nine genes for polysaccharide side chains biosynthesis. It
contained a number of CDSs that encode putative cell surface acting (RTX toxin and hemolysins) and intracellular
cytotoxins (patatin-like proteins) and enzymes for invasion (outer membrane phospholipase A). It contained a
broad variety of antibiotic resistance-related genes, including genes related to b-lactam (n = 10) and multidrug
efflux (n = 54). It also contained eight prophages, 17 other phage-related CDSs and 26 CDSs for transposases.
Conclusions: The L. hongkongensis genome possessed genes for acid and bile resistance, intestinal mucosa
colonization, evasion of host defense and cytotoxicity and invasion. A broad variety of antibiotic resistance or
multidrug resistance genes, a high number of prophages, other phage-related CDSs and CDSs for transposases,
were also identified.

Background
In 2001, Laribacter hongkongensis, a novel genus and
species that belongs to the Neisseriaceae family of bsubclass of the Proteobacteria, was discovered from the
blood and empyema pus of a patient with underlying
alcoholic cirrhosis [1]. Subsequently, it was observed
that L. hongkongensis was associated with freshwater fish
borne community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s
diarrhea in human [2-7]. The clinical syndrome of associated gastroenteritis is similar to those of Salmonella or
Campylobacter gastroenteritis. About 80% and 20% of
the patients have watery and bloody diarrhea

respectively, one third of them have systemic symptoms
and another one third have vomiting [4]. Pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis of SpeI digested chromosomal DNA
and multilocus sequence typing using seven housekeeping gene loci independently showed that the L. hongkongensis isolates recovered from freshwater fish and
patients fell into separate clusters. These suggested that
some L. hongkongensis clones could be more virulent or
adapted to human than others [8,9].
For a gastrointestinal tract pathogen to cause infection, after transmission through the oral route, the bacterium has to be able to survive the hostile acidic
environment of the stomach, resist the action of bile in
the small intestine, colonize the gastrointestinal tract
epithelium through binding of adhesins of the bacterium
to receptors on epithelial cells, evade host immune

defense mechanisms before causing diarrhea and/or
invading the gastrointestinal tract and cause systemic
infections, as in the case of bacteremia and empyema
thoracis [1]. Moreover, the possession of drug resistance
determinants and phages also enhance the potential capability of the bacterium to resist to killing by antimicrobials and causing diseases. In this article, we present an
overview of the genes and gene cassettes of the L. hongkongensis genome related to these various steps in the
infective process, as well as drug resistance and phages.
The phylogeny of these genes, most of them were
thought to be acquired through horizontal gene transfer,
was also analyzed.

Results and discussion
Resistance to acid
Urease

Similar to other gastrointestinal tract pathogens, L. hongkongensis has to face the highly hostile and acidic
environment of the stomach before reaching the intestine. L. hongkongensis possesses a urease, that is able to
hydrolyze the limited amount of urea available in the
stomach to generate carbon dioxide and ammonia,
which increases the pH. In the L. hongkongensis genome,
a complete urease cassette, that occupies a 7,556 bp
region, is observed. The cassette includes eight CDSs,
which encodes three urease structural proteins (UreA,
UreB and UreC) and five accessory proteins (UreE,
UreF, UreG, UreD and UreI) [10]. Similar to the urease
of other bacteria, the urease of L. hongkongensis is presumably a nickel containing enzyme [11]. The histidine
residues at the carboxyl terminal of UreE are supposed
to bind to the nickel ions that are transported into L.
hongkongensis through a nickel transporter, and donate
the nickel ions to UreC during urease activation. Most
of the eight genes in the urease cassette of L. hongkongensis are most closely related to their homologues in
bacteria of a- and g-proteobacteria, rather than those in
other bacteria of b-proteobacteria [12-16].
Arginine deiminase

Two arc gene clusters were encoded in the L. hongkongensis genome. Each cluster consists of four genes, arcA,
arcB, arcC and arcD. arcA, arcB and arcC encode the
three enzymes, arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase and carbamate kinase, of the arginine deiminase pathway, whereas arcD encodes a membrane
bound arginine-ornithine antiporter. The arginine deiminase pathway converts L-arginine to carbon dioxide,
ATP, and ammonia, which increases the pH. It has been
shown in various bacteria, such as Streptococcus sanguis,
Streptococcus rattus, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus
pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that this gene cluster is useful for bacterial survival in acidic environment [17-19]. In S. pyogenes, it has

also been shown that this pathway facilitates cell invasion and inhibits proliferation of human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells [20,21]. Phylogenetically, these
four genes of the arc gene cluster in L. hongkongensis
are most closely related to the corresponding homologues in Chromobacterium violaceum (Figure 1, 2, 3, and
4), whereas the gene cluster is absent in Neiserria
meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Among all bacteria with complete genomes sequenced, L. hongkongensis is the only one that contains two adjacent arc gene
clusters (Figure 5).
Bile resistance
Efflux pumps

Efflux of bile salts from bacteria is mediated through a
number of efflux systems. These efflux systems pump a
variety of compounds, including antibiotics, oxidative
stress agents, organic solvents and bile salts, out of the
bacterial cytoplasm. Among these efflux systems, the
best studied one is encoded by acrAB-tolC of the resistance nodulation division (RND) family. This system has
been shown to be present in the genomes of a variety of
pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria of the human
gastrointestinal tract, such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium [22,23]. In the L. hongkongensis
genome, three complete copies of acrAB-tolC, of which
AcrB is located in the inner membrane and contains the
conserved ACR_tran domain, AcrA is located in the
periplasmic space and contains the conserved HlyD
domain and TolC as the outer membrane channel protein, are present. A recent bioinformatics analysis on
bile resistance mechanisms in Campylobacterales also
found that one complete copy of acrAB-tolC is present
in the C. jejuni genome [24]. In addition to efflux
pumps encoded by acrAB-tolC, the genome of L. hongkongensis also contains two copies of emrAB-tolC of
the major facilitator superfamily, one copy of acrADtolC of the RND family (AcrD is also an inner membrane protein and contains the conserved ACR_tran
domain similar to AcrB), one copy of mdtABC-tolC of
the RND family and one copy of ydgFE/mdtJI of the
small multidrug resistance family. These four gene cassettes were also found to be encoding efflux pumps
related to bile resistance in E. coli [22,25-27]. In addition, acrAD-tolC and mdtABC-tolC have been documented to be related to bile salt resistance in S.
Typhimurium [28].
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Tol proteins

In addition to the efflux pumps, the integrity of the
outer membrane is also important in resistance against
bile. The O-antigen has been shown to be related to bile
resistance in S. Typhimurium [29,30]. Tol proteins,
which are cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins encoded
by a gene cluster that consists of five genes (tolQ, tolR,

tolA, tolB and pal), are also important in maintaining
the integrity of the outer membrane and bile resistance,
as shown in E. coli, S. Typhimurium and Erwinia chrysanthemi [31-33]. In the genomes of L. hongkongensis
and C. violaceum, tolQ was not clustered with tolR,
tolA, tolB and pal, although all five genes are present in
their genomes.
Colonization of intestinal mucosa

The first step of infection is adhesion to host cells. In
the L. hongkongensis genome, a putative adhesin, with
27-30% amino acid identity to the adhesins of diffusely
adherent E. coli (DAEC) [34-36] and enterotoxigenic E.
coli (ETEC) [37-40], encoded by aidA and tibA respectively, was observed (Figure 6). It has been shown that
aidA deletion mutants of DAEC lost the ability to
adhere to HeLa cells and tibA deletion mutants of
ETEC lost the ability to adhere to human intestine
epithelial cells [37,41,42]; and E. coli HB101 transformed
with tib loci was able to adhere to HCT 8 cells [37,42].
aidA and tibA encode proteins of the autotransporter
family, type V protein secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria [43]. Proteins of this family possess three
domains, an N-terminal signal sequence, a passenger or
a-domain and a translocation or b-domain, which
enable the proteins to transport themselves to cell surfaces. These three domains are all present in the putative adhesin in L. hongkongensis. Amino acid residues 136 is the putative signal sequence (predicted by SignalP).
As in the passenger domains of other autotransporters,
no cysteine residues, which were thought to interfere
with transport of the proteins to cell surfaces because of
formation of disulphide bonds, were present in the putative passenger domain (amino acid residues 37-756) of
the putative adhesin in L. hongkongensis [41]. In the passenger domains of AIDA in DAEC, multiple copies of

the consensus sequence VXNSGG, acceptor sites for
heptose, addition of which catalyzed by AAH heptosyltransferase, encoded by aah located upstream to aidA,
are present [44]. The addition of heptose was shown to
be essential for the adhesion properties in the tibA
adhesin in ETEC [45]. In the putative passenger domain
of the putative adhesin in L. hongkongensis, nine copies
of VXSGG, but not VXNSGG, were present; and a putative heptosyltransferase, with 52% amino acid identity to
the TibC heptosyltransferase of ETEC, was present
upstream to the putative adhesin gene in the L. hongkongensis genome. Interestingly, in the putative passenger domain of tibA adhesin in ETEC, 11 copies of
VXSGG, but not VXNSGG, were present, but whether
VXSGG is the acceptor sites for heptose has not been
documented. In addition to their roles for adhesion, the
passenger domains may also possess virulence functions,
such as autoaggregation, biofilm formation, invasion and
cytotoxicity. In the putative translocation domain, the
consensus motif (Y/V/I/F/W)-X-(F/W) at the extreme
carboxyl terminus of other autotransporter proteins,
predicted to play a role in outer membrane localization
and/or stability of these proteins, was present [41].
Evasion of host defense

To protect from the active oxygen species (superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide) released from phagocytic cells,
the genome of L. hongkongensis encodes superoxide dismutase and catalases, in line with its catalase-positive
phenotype. The putative superoxide dismutase of L.
hongkongensis, which decomposes superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, is most closely related to
those of C. violaceum, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. There are three putative catalases in the L. hongkongensis genome, encoded by a katE (encoding
hydroperoxidase II) and two katG (encoding

These decompose hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. katE in L. hongkongensis is most closely related to
the homologues in Ralstonia eutropha, whereas the two
katG were most closely related to those in Shewanella
amazonensis and Vibrio cholerae respectively. In addition to protection against the active oxygen species,
some efflux pumps may export host-derived antimicrobial agents in addition to antibiotics, bile and other substances, hence protecting from such naturally produced
molecules of the host.
Virulence factors
Lipopolysaccharide

LPS consists of three parts: lipid A, core oligosaccharide,
and polysaccharide side chains. In E. coli, the minimal
LPS required for growth include lipid A and two ketodeoxyoctulonate (Kdo) units of the core oligosaccharide.
The LPS of wild type strains of E. coli consist of additional core sugars and polysaccharide side chains. The
polysaccharide side chains are also known as the O-antigen, which varies among different species of Gram-negative bacteria and different strains of the same species.
These sugars enhance survival during environmental
stress, and help the bacteria evade the host immune system by modification of the structure. Lipid A, also

known as the endotoxin, is the hydrophobic anchor of
LPS. It is a glucosamine based phospholipid inserted
into the outer membranes of most Gram-negative bacteria. Most Gram-negative bacteria synthesize lipid A by
pathways similar to the one in E. coli. Through binding
to Toll-like receptor 4 and CD14, lipid A of Gram-negative bacteria trigger the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The actions of these cytokines
lead to local and systemic inflammatory responses,
which result in various clinical manifestations, and even
deaths, of patients.
The same set of genes that encode enzymes in the
biosynthetic pathways of lipid A, the two Kdo units and
the heptose units are present in the L. hongkongensis, C.
violaceum, N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae and E. coli
genomes. In contrast to E. coli, the lipid A of C. violaceum, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae had a symmetrical acylation pattern [46]. Both the reducing and
terminal N-acetyl-glucosamine residues in these bacteria
carry three acyl groups. The sequential addition of the
last 12-carbon acyl group to the reducing and terminal
N-acetyl-glucosamine residues are catalyzed by enzymes
encoded by the htrB and msbB genes, respectively. It
was found that msbB deletion mutants of N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae had lower abilities to activate
human macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory

Lau et al. Cell & Bioscience 2011, 1:17
http://www.cellandbioscience.com/content/1/1/17

cytokines [47-49]. Phylogenetic analysis of the experimentally confirmed htrB and msbB genes in N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae and the putative htrB and
msbB genes in L. hongkongensis and C. violaceum
showed that the four htrB genes and the four msbB
genes fell into two separate clusters, with very high
bootstrap values (Figure 7). Therefore, we speculate that
the htrB and msbB genes in L. hongkongensis and C. violaceum serve similar functions as those in N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae and that the lipid A of L.
hongkongensis also had a symmetrical acylation pattern.
The genes that are responsible for the synthesis of achain L1, a-chain L2, b-chain and g-chain in the core
oligosaccharide in N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae
(lgtA, lgtB, lgtC, lgtD, lgtE, lgtF, lgtG, rfaK) and those
for the addition of sialic acids to these chains (lst) are
absent in the genomes of L. hongkongensis and C. violaceum [50]. On the other hand, nine genes which
encode putative enzymes for biosynthesis of the polysaccharide side chains are present in the L. hongkongensis genome. Four of these genes (rfbA, rfbB, rfbC
and rfbD) are also present in the genomes of C.

violaceum, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae. The
enzymes encoded by these four genes catalyzed reactions for the synthesis of dTDP-rhamnose, although
mutations of them in N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae did not result in any change in their phenotypes [51,52]. The other five genes (wbmF, wbmG,
wbmH, wbmI and wbmK), which encode putative
nucleotide sugar epimerases/dehydratases and amidotransferase, are not present in the C. violaceum, N.
meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae genomes, but are
most closely related to the corresponding genes for the
biosynthesis of the O-antigens in Bordetella parapertussis and Bordetella bronchoseptica [53]. Although the
structures of the LPS of L. hongkongensis and C. violaceum remain to be determined, these imply that the
structures of the LPS of L. hongkongensis and C. violaceum are probably quite different from those of the
lipooligosaccharides of N. meningitidis and N.
gonorrhoeae.
Recently, a number of genes that encode proteins for
the assembly and transport of LPS in E. coli have been
discovered [54]. All these genes were also present in the

CDSs that encode putative cytotoxins. These include
cell surface acting cytotoxins, such as RTX toxin and
hemolysins; and intracellular cytotoxins such as patatinlike proteins.

genome contains an RTX gene cluster (tolC-rtxA1-rtxDrtxB) and an isolated rtxA2 gene. In the RTX gene cluster
(Figure 8), tolC encodes the outer membrane component
of the type I secretion apparatus, rtxA1 encodes the structural toxin, rtxD encodes the adaptor protein anchored to
the inner membrane and rtxB encodes the inner membrane ATPase. TolC, RtxD and RtxB form the secretion
apparatus for exporting RtxA. Similar to RtxA of other

Figure 8 Genetic organization of the RTX gene cluster (tolC-rtxA1-rtxD-rtxB) in L. hongkongensis. The boxes represent the CDSs. The
number of amino acid residues of each gene is indicated above the boxes. The basic functional activities of the corresponding gene products
are given on the top. Five copies of glycine-rich nonapeptide repeats (GGXGXDX[L/I/V/W/Y/F]X, where X is any amino acid) of rtxA1 are
underlined. An CDS of unknown function, located between rtxA1 and rtxD, are also depicted, where nine repeats of 22 amino acids are
highlighted. The relative positions of each gene are assigned as predicted by nucleotide sequence analysis.

for binding of calcium ions (Figure 8). There are five nonapeptide repeats in RtxA1 and nine nonapeptide repeats in
RtxA2. Unlike most other bacteria which contain rtxC
genes, the RTX gene cluster of L. hongkongensis does not
possess this gene. Instead, it contains a gene of putative
adhesive function, located between rtxA1 and rtxD.
Domain search using InterProScan showed that this gene
contains nine repeats of 22 amino acids
(TDNGTVTNVTLSSVTNGQTVAE) with parallel betahelix structures. Each repeat is separated from the adjacent
one by 82 amino acids (Figure 8). Although the genomes
of L. hongkongensis, C. violaceum and N. meningitidis all
contain RTX toxin, RtxA1 and RtxA2 of L. hongkongensis
do not show clustering with the homologues in C. violaceum and N. meningitidis. This is in contrast to the other
genes (tolC, rtxD and rtxB) in the RTX gene cluster,
which are all most closely related to the corresponding
homologues in C. violaceum and other species of b-proteobacteria [59,60] (Figure 9, 10, 11, and 12). Moreover,
the amino acid identities between TolC, RtxD and RtxB
and their homologues in C. violaceum are much higher
than those between RtxA1 or RtxA2 and their homologues
in any other bacteria (Figure 9, 10, 11, and 12). These suggest that rtxA1 and rtxA2 have evolved much faster than
tolC, rtxD and rtxB, so that the toxins can bind to their
corresponding host cells more efficiently. Interestingly,
similar to rtxA2 of L. hongkongensis, the structural toxin
genes (frpC and frpA) in N. meningitidis are not linked to
genes of the type I secretion system. However, it has been
shown that FrpC and FrpA can be secreted by E. coli

harboring hlyBD genes, indicating that they are probably
secreted by secretion systems unlinked to their corresponding genes [61].
Hemolysins In the L. hongkongensis genome, there are
two gene loci that encode putative hemolysins. The first
putative hemolysin contains three domains, the first one
of the DUF21 superfamily, the second one of the
CBS_pair superfamily and the third one of the CorC_HlyC superfamily. Among the five most closely
related protein sequences, three of them were putative
hemolysins of three different Yersinia species, and the
other two were hypothetical proteins. The second putative hemolysin belongs to the HlyIII superfamily, which
contains seven transmembrane domains with conserved
amino acid residues present. It is most closely related to
the hemolysin III of C. violaceum.
Patatin-like protein Patatin, originally described in
plants such as potatoes, has diverse functions such as
storage glycoproteins [62], signal transduction [63] and
defense against parasites [64]. In 2003, it was found that
toxin ExoU of P. aeruginosa, delivered to eukaryotic
cells via a type III secretion system, possessed the catalytic domains of patatin, iPLA(2) and cPLA(2) [65]. Direct
injection of ExoU in mammalian cells resulted in irreversible damage to cellular membranes and rapid necrotic death [66]. Similar to patatin, ExoU of P. aeruginosa
possessed phopholipase A2 activity. P. aeruginosa
mutants with mutations at the active sites of the patatin-like protein were less virulent than wild type P. aeruginosa in a mouse model [67]. Subsequently, genes that

encode putative patatin-like proteins were observed in
many bacterial genomes, although none of them was
characterized phenotypically [68]. It was also observed
that the average copy number of genes that encode
patatin-like proteins is higher in plant/animal bacterial
pathogens than in non-pathogens [68]. In some pathogens, up to eight copies of genes that encode putative
patatin-like proteins can be found. Similar to P. aeruginosa, the genome of L. hongkongensis also contains
three copies of genes that encode putative patatin-like
proteins. The lengths of the genes that encode putative
patatin-like proteins in the genomes of L. hongkongensis,
C. violaceum (7 copies), N. meningitidis (1 copy) and N.
gonorrhoeae (1 copy) varied from 894 to 2,337 bp. The
three copies in the L. hongkongensis genome are 951,
963 and 2,232 bp respectively. All three copies contain
all the four domains that can be found in bacterial patatin-like proteins, including a putative oxyanion hole, a
serine hydrolase G-X-S-X-G domain, a potential serinecontaining phosphorylation site and an aspartate-containing active site domain (Figure 13). The serine in the
hydrolase domain and the aspartate made up a patatinspecific catalytic dyad that has not been described in
any other known proteins [68].
Enzymes

Outer membrane phospholipase A It has been shown
that outer membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA) is a
virulence factor in a number of bacteria, including

Helicobacter pylori and C. coli. Located on the outer
membrane of bacteria, OMPLA lyses the outer membrane, leading to release of other virulence factors, such
as urease and VacA in H. pylori. In the L. hongkongensis
genome, a gene that encodes a putative OMPLA is
observed. This OMPLA possesses a complete and highly
specific consensus sequence motif (YTQ-Xn-G-X2-H-XSNG) found in OMPLA of other bacteria. Phylogenetically, it is most closely related to the OMPLA of Methylibium petroleiphilum, a methyl tert-butyl ether-degrading
methylotroph of b-proteobacteria (Figure 14) [69].
Drug resistance

A genome-wide analysis using similarity searches revealed
the presence of a large number of antibiotic resistancerelated genes in L. hongkongensis strain HLHK9. They are
related to b-lactam (Table 2), multidrug efflux (Table 3)
and other resistance genes (Table 4).
b-lactam resistance-related genes

A total of 10 CDSs related to b-lactam resistance were
identified in the L. hongkongensis genome. Genes that
exhibit similarity to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (6
CDSs) of other bacterial species were found (Table 2).
The PBPs identified in L. hongkongensis include PBP1a,
PBP2, PBP3, PBP4a, PBP6a, and PBP7, which are essential proteins that are involved in biosynthesis of murein
and peptidoglycan, and are targets for inhibition by blactams [70,71]. Although the presence of PBPs per se

does not confer resistance, chromosomal mutations in
PBPs may render the bacteria resistant to b-lactams
[72-75].
Apart from the ampC gene (LHK_03028) that
encodes the previously characterized class C b-lactamase [76], there are two other putative b-lactamases
(LHK_00876 and LHK_00878) observed in the L. hongkongensis genome. They are both putative metallo-blactamases containing a metallo-b-lactamase superfamily domain which included two zinc ligand-binding
sites essential for its hydrolytic function on the b-lactam ring (Figure 15) [77-79]. However, these zinc
ligand-binding sites were also present in most proteins
of the metallo-b-lactamase superfamily, the function of
which is not limited to b-lactam hydrolysis [79-81].
Therefore, in vitro experiments are required to confirm

the actual function of these two putative metallo-blactamases.
Multidrug resistance genes

A total of 54 CDSs related to multidrug efflux were
identified in L. hongkongensis genome (Table 3). The
five major families of drug extrusion translocases were
all present, including the Major Facilitator Superfamily
(MFS) (7 CDSs), Small Multidrug Resistance (SMR)
family (2 CDSs), RND family (7 CDSs), Multidrug and
Toxic compound Extrusion (MATE) family (2 CDSs),
and ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily (6 CDSs).
Resistance-Nodulation-cell Division (RND) family proteins

For Gram-negative bacteria, the efflux pumps that are
associated with most clinically significant resistance to
antibiotics are those of the RND family. In this family,
three gene loci homologous to acrRAB-tolC

transcription regulator gene located upstream of the
acrAB-tolC loci. As a multidrug efflux system with
broad-substrate spectrum, AcrAB-TolC confers resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, erythromycin,
trimethoprim, b-lactams, and other organic and inorganic antiseptic agents in E. coli [83,84]. AcrAD-TolC
is less commonly reported compared to AcrAB-TolC
system, where AcrD is a close homolog of AcrB.
AcrAD-TolC multidrug efflux system is capable of
exporting antibiotics of the aminoglycoside class
including amikacin, gentamicin, neomycin, kanamycin,
tobramycin, and streptomycin in E. coli [85,86].
Another putative multidrug efflux system of the RND
family identified in the genome of L. hongkongensis is
homologous to MdtABC-TolC system (LHK_01285,
LHK_01286, LHK_01288, LHK_01289). MdtABC-TolC
system in E. coli confers at least novobiocin and bile
salt resistance in the bacterium. A uniqueness of this
system is that MdtB and MdtC will form a heterodimer as a membrane efflux component in cooperation
with membrane fusion protein MdtA and outer membrane channel protein TolC. [27,87] Moreover, one
RND family multidrug efflux system with homology to
hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux-1 subfamily was also
discovered (LHK_01424-01426).

Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS)

Two loci (LHK_01373-01376; LHK_03132-03134)
homologous to emrAB-tolC system of E. coli belonging
to MFS were found in the genome of L. hongkongensis.
One of them had an additional transcription regulator
emrR gene (LHK_01376) in its upstream sequence.
EmrAB-TolC system in E. coli confers nalidixic acid and
other toxic novobiocin substances resistance to bacterium [88]. Moreover, mutation of the emrR gene has
been shown to lead to over-expression of the EmrAB
pump and increased resistance to antimicrobial agents
[89]. However, the substrate specificity of these EmrABTolC homologs identified in the genome of L. hongkongensis is yet to be investigated. There are five other multidrug efflux proteins belonging to MFS (LHK_00743;
LHK_01870; LHK_02173; LHK_02539; LHK_02975) in
the L. hongkongensis genome. One of them
(LHK_00743) is a homolog to mdfA gene while another
(LHK_02975) has high identities to bcr gene. mdfA
encodes an MF-related protein, MdfA, which results in
resistance to a diverse group of cationic and zwitterionic
lipophilic compounds and antibiotics such as chloramphenicol and erythromycin when over-expressed in E.
coli [90]. bcr gene codes for an efflux protein which is
associated with bicyclomycin resistance in E. coli [91].

Small Multidrug Resistance (SMR) family

Two adjacently located multidrug efflux genes
(LHK_01384 and LHK_01385) of the SMR family were
identified in the genome of L. hongkongensis. They are
homologous to mdtJI (also named ydgEF) genes in E.
coli which confers resistance to spermidine and, deoxycholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate at low level [92,93].
mdtJI have to be co-expressed for functionality and it is
suggested that MdtJI may function as a heterodimer or
heterooligomer [92-94].
Multidrug and Toxic compound Extrusion (MATE) family

Two multidrug efflux genes of the MATE family
(LHK_00466 and LHK_02533) were also discovered in
the genome of L. hongkongensis. One of them
(LHK_02533) is a homolog of multidrug efflux protein
NorA from Staphylococcus aureus, which confers resistance to antibiotics of the quinolone class and various
organic compounds [95,96]. Mutation of the norA gene
in S. aureus has resulted in 5- to 30-fold increase in susceptibility to norfloxacin [96].
ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily

Six CDSs of the ABC transporter family related to multidrug resistance were identified in the L. hongkongensis
genome. A tripartite multidrug efflux system of the ABC
transporter family composed of membrane transporter
(LHK_02239), MFP (LHK_02240), and OMP
(LHK_02241) was identified in the genome of L. hongkongensis. This system of proteins probably functions
as a complex with composition resembling to that of
RND family. Five other standalone putative ABC transporter genes (LHK_00222; LHK_01967; LHK_02051;
LHK_02238; LHK_02949) coding for multidrug efflux
proteins were scattered over the L. hongkongensis genome. One (LHK_02949) of them possessed homology to
msbA from E. coli, which is responsible for mediating
the transport of the lipid A core of LPS to the outer
membrane [97,98]. Interestingly, expression of E. coli
MsbA in Lactococcus lactis which lacks LPS has been
shown to significantly increase resistance to erythromycin [98].
In addition to these five major families, the L. hongkongensis genome also encodes a number of other possible multidrug resistance-related genes. Among these,
there are five marC-like genes (LHK_01214;
LHK_01383; LHK_01934; LHK_02292; LHK_02783), the
expression of which was once believed to be associated
with multidrug efflux system MarRAB in E. coli [99].
However, a recent report has shown that mutation in
marC did not increase antibiotic susceptibility on E. coli
[100]. Therefore, the actual function of MarC is still not
identified yet. One CDS (LHK_02235) coding for a protein with 75% amino acid identities to putative integral
membrane efflux protein of Yersinia pestis and possessing an AbgT family domain was also identified in the

Page 17 of 25

genome of L. hongkongensis. AbgT protein family
includes two transporter members, AbgT protein of E.
coli and MtrF of N. gonorrhoeae [101,102]. MtrF, as an
inner membrane protein, which enhances the activity of
multidrug efflux system MtrCDE of the RND family,
conferring higher level of resistance to hydrophobic
antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin etc.
[102,103]. Since no mtrCDE gene homologs were found
in the genome of L. hongkongensis, the role and function
of the AbgT family protein in L. hongkongensis remains
to be elucidated.
Miscellaneous resistance genes

Six other CDSs with homologies to other drug resistance genes were identified in the L. hongkongensis genome (Table 4). A putative dimethyladenosine
transferase, encoded by ksgA gene (LHK_00025) was
found. Kasugamycin and streptomycin resistance as a
result of mutations in ksgA have been documented
[104-106]. A bacA gene (LHK_02940) encoding putative
bacitracin resistance protein BacA was also identified.
BacA protein confers bacitracin resistance to E. coli by
catalyzing the dephosphorylation of undecaprenyl diphosphate (C55-PP) into C55-P, which is important in peptidoglycan synthesis. The conversion of C55-PP into
C55-P is normally catalyzed by a specific phosphatase
which is inhibited by bacitracin leading to halted peptidoglycan synthesis [107]. The other four CDSs encode
putative arsenical-resistance protein (LHK_00913), two
camphor resistance proteins CrcB (LHK_01038 and
LHK_01039), and chloramphenicol sensitive protein
RarD (LHK_01350). Overexpression of CrcB in E. coli
has been shown to protect the bacteria against chromosome decondensation by camphor [108]. The presence
of two crcB genes in L. hongkongensis genome, but only
one copy in the closely related bacterium, C. violaceum,
and none in N. gonorrheae or N. meningitidis genomes
suggested that this is an important defense mechanism
in L. hongkongensis. Since the L. hongkongensis strain,
HLHK9, used for genome sequencing is susceptible to
tetracycline (MIC = 0.5 μg/ml), the tetA gene previously
identified in L. hongkongensis strains resistant to tetracycline is not found in the present genome [109]. Recently,
class 1 integrons carrying multiple antimicrobial resistance genes were identified in 6.5% of L. hongkongensis
isolates from aquatic products in Guangzhou city, China
[110]. However, such integron is not present in the genome of strain HLHK9.
Bacteriophages

The L. hongkongensis genome (genome size 3.16 Mbp)
contains a total of eight putative prophages named LhP1
to LhP8, the positions of which are shown in Figure 16
and Table 5. This high number of prophages, compared
to 3 prophages in C. violaceum (genome size 4.75 Mbp)

Lau et al. Cell & Bioscience 2011, 1:17

genital and gastrointestinal tract respectively. Interestingly, the presence of apparently high number of prophages also in N. gonorrhoeae is in line with our
previous observation that horizontal gene transfer was
particularly frequent among bacteria residing in human
gastrointestinal and probably genital tract [111], suggesting that these anatomical sites may be an excellent incubator for bacterial gene transfer.

parameters for prophage prediction by Prophage Finder,
suggested that this is an important mechanism for
acquisition and exchange of genetic materials in L. hongkongensis. While N. meningitides and C. violaceum
cause mainly meningitis and invasive infections respectively that can lead to fatal septicemia, N. gonorrheae
and L. hongkongensis were mainly isolated from human

Bacteriophage LhP1 is composed of 47 CDSs, accounting for 31,318 bp with G+C content 63.07%, close to the
G+C content of the L. hongkongensis genome. LhP1
contains 34 phage-related CDSs. Analysis of these CDSs
indicated that LhP1 is likely a P2-like phage, as 29 of its
34 phage-related CDSs were most similar to CDSs in
P2-like prophages (Figure 17). A P2-like phage typically
possesses an icosahedral head with a diameter of about
60 nm, containing a linear double-stranded DNA molecule of about 30-35 kb with cohesive ends and a straight
tail with a contractile sheath [112]. Based on their morphology, P2-like phages are classified as members of the
Myoviridae family (phages with contractile tails) in the
order Caudovirales (tailed phages) [113]. Other CDSs
exhibit similarity to other genes of phages such as Mulike phages and unclassified phages under Myoviridae
and Siphoviridae (phages with long non-contractile
tails).
LhP2

Bacteriophage LhP2 is composed of 32 CDSs, accounting for 26,141 bp with G+C content 64.81%. Analysis of
its CDSs indicated that LhP2 is likely a Mu-like phage,

other CDSs similar to other phage genes of lambda- and
P2-like phages.
LhP3

Bacteriophage LhP3 is the smallest prophage in the L.
hongkongensis genome. It is composed of 19 CDSs,
accounting for 11,169 bp with G+C content 58.70%,
lower than that of the host genome (62.35%), reflecting
its heterologous origin. Of the 19 CDSs, 14 were phagerelated CDSs with similarity to genes of BPP-1-, lambdaand epsilon15-like phages and other unclassified phages,
indicating its genetic complexity. Further studies are
required if this relatively small prophage is a functional
tailed phage.
LhP4

Bacteriophage LhP4 is composed of 36 CDSs, accounting for 34,375 bp with G+C content 58.78%, also lower
than that of the host genome, indicating its heterologous
origin. Of the 23 phage-related CDSs, 14 possessed similarity to genes of Bordetella phage BPP-1. Other phage
related genes resemble those of P4-, P2-, P22- and episolon15-like phages and unclassified phages of Siphoviridae and Myoviridae.
LhP5

Bacteriophage LhP5 is the largest prophage identified in
the L. hongkongensis genome. Composed of 64 CDSs, it
accounts for 43,997 bp with G+C content 59%, lower
than that of the host genome. Of the 32 phage-related
CDSs, 9 possessed homologies to genes of Mu-like
phages, 7 even possessed homologies to genes of
lambda-like phages. The other phage-related CDSs are
most closely related to those of various phages including
those belonging to Podoviridae (phages with short tails),
Myoriviridae and Siphoviridae.

LhP6

Bacteriophage LhP6 is composed of 31 CDSs, accounting for 21,918 bp with G+C content of 62.04%. The 25
phage-related CDSs exhibit similarity to phage genes of
Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella avium. Of
these 25 CDSs, 12 possessed homologies to genes of
unclassified phages belonging to Siphoviridae and 5 to
lambda-like phages.

Bacteriophage LhP7 is composed of 31 CDSs, accounting for 19,992 bp with the lowest G+C content of
55.59% among the eight prophages, suggesting a heterologous origin. Of the 18 phage-related CDSs, 4 exhibits
similarity to phage genes of N. meningitidis, Burkholderia, and C. violaceum genes of Mu-like phages, and
others to those of unclassified phages, lambda-, P22-,
and BPP-1-like phages.
LhP8

Similar to LhP1, bacteriophage LhP8 is also a P2-like
phage (Figure 17). It is composed of 48 CDSs, accounting for 33,791 bp with G+C content of 63.87%, similar
to that of the host genome. It contains the highest number of phage-related CDSs (n = 37) among the eight
phages. Of the 37 phage-related CDSs, 30 were most
similar to genes of P2-like phages and others to phages
of Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Mu-like phages. In fact,
LhP1 and LhP8 are highly similar with the exception of
a few CDSs, with most of their CDSs exhibiting similarity to phage proteins found in other gram-negative bacteria including Salmonella, Burkholderia, Yersinia, and
Shigella species. Their gene organizations are also highly
similar to P2 phage (Table 6) (Figure 17).
Remnant phages

Among the eight putative prophages, LhP1 and LhP8
are most likely to represent intact prophages, while the
remaining six prophages encode a diversity of prophage

elements of phage-related structural and non-structural
proteins. In addition to these putative prophages, 17
other phage-related CDSs were found scattered in the L.
hongkongensis genome. However, these CDSs are either
not flanked by other phage-related genes or that the
region of these phage-related gene clusters was too
short for confident prediction as prophages. Further studies are required to ascertain if the present putative prophages and phage-related gene clusters are intact or
remnant phages.
Transposases and insertion sequences

There are 26 CDSs coding for transposases in the L.
hongkongensis genome (Table 7). Fourteen of these 26
transposases possessed homologies to transposases of
IS3 family, nine to those of IS5 family and three to
those of IS481 family. The presence of transposases of
IS481 family is unique in L. hongkongensis, as they are
absent in other members of the Neisseriaceae family
such as the pathogenic Neisseria species and C. violaceum [114]. The transposases of L. hongkongensis are
most closely related to those of other members of bproteobacteria, especially of the order Burkholderiales,
with seven most closely related to those of Comamonas
testosteroni, seven to those of Janthinobacterium sp.,
and four to those of Polaromonas sp. However, only two
pairs of these transposases carry short imperfect
inverted repeats at their ends that form insertion
sequences most closely related to the IS3 family. Other
transposases are likely remnant insertion sequences and
lack associated inverted repeats. The first insertion
sequence, of 1,183 bp, contains two ORFs, LHK_01280
(ORFb) and LHK_01281 (ORFa), with 38-bp inverted
repeats with six mismatches. The second insertion
sequence is relatively short in length, with 603 bp

containing two ORFs, LHK_02311 and LHK_02312
(ORFa) and 50-bp inverted repeats with ten mismatches.
The G+C content of both putative insertion sequences
are lower (57.4% and 54.89% respectively) than that of
the L. hongkongensis genome, suggestive of heterologous
origin.

Conclusions
The L. hongkongensis genome possessed genes and gene
cassettes for acid and bile resistance, colonization of the
intestinal mucosa, evasion of host defense and cytotoxicity and invasion. In addition, a broad variety of antibiotic resistance or multidrug resistance genes, a high
number of prophages, together with other phage-related
CDSs and CDSs coding for transposases, were also
identified.
Methods
CDSs identified in the L. hongkongensis genome were
annotated as described in our previous publication and
classified functionally according to the Clusters of
Orthologous Groups (COG) methodology [10]. CDSs
belonging to COG clusters potentially associated with
virulence (such as intracellular trafficking, secretion and
vesicular transport) were selected for further examination, whereas those associated with housekeeping functions (such as chromatin structure and dynamics) were
removed. The CDSs were then examined by comparison
with the latest release of the reference Virulence Factor
Database (VFDB) [115] and keyword searching using the
following words and their variants: virulence, toxin,
hemolysin/hemolysis, pathogenicity, adherence, invasion,
secretion, phagocytosis, phase variation, stress, iron
uptake, siderophore, resistance, efflux pump, damaging
and regulation. For drug resistance, CDSs that were

classified to COG V (defense mechanisms), COG Q
(secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism), and COQ M (cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis) were manually annotated for identification of
antibiotic resistance-related genes. CDSs from other
COGs were searched for additional genes using keywords: resistance antibiotic, efflux, multi etc. Prophages
were identified by Prophage finder http://bioinformatics.
uwp.edu/~phage/ searches [116]. The genome was run
under the parameters with an e-value of 0.01, hits per
prophage of 7, and hit spacing of 5000. Transposases
were identified by performing BlastP analyses for all
CDSs identified in the genome of L. hongkongensis
HLHK9 against the ISfinder database http://www-is.biotoul.fr/is.html[117] and inverted repeats by einverted
(EMBOSS package) [118]. Manual confirmation of the
assigned function was performed by sequence similarity
search using BLAST against the NCBI nr database, and
assisted by conserved domain search (CD-search), identification of signature sequence motifs and sequence
analysis using InterProScan. Localization patterns of
putative virulence factors were predicted using PSORTb
where appropriate [119].
