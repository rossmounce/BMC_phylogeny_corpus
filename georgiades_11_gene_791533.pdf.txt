Gene gain and loss events in Rickettsia and
Orientia species

Abstract
Background: Genome degradation is an ongoing process in all members of the Rickettsiales order, which makes
these bacterial species an excellent model for studying reductive evolution through interspecies variation in
genome size and gene content. In this study, we evaluated the degree to which gene loss shaped the content of
some Rickettsiales genomes. We shed light on the role played by horizontal gene transfers in the genome
evolution of Rickettsiales.
Results: Our phylogenomic tree, based on whole-genome content, presented a topology distinct from that of the
whole core gene concatenated phylogenetic tree, suggesting that the gene repertoires involved have different
evolutionary histories. Indeed, we present evidence for 3 possible horizontal gene transfer events from various
organisms to Orientia and 6 to Rickettsia spp., while we also identified 3 possible horizontal gene transfer events
from Rickettsia and Orientia to other bacteria. We found 17 putative genes in Rickettsia spp. that are probably the
result of de novo gene creation; 2 of these genes appear to be functional. On the basis of these results, we were
able to reconstruct the gene repertoires of “proto-Rickettsiales” and “proto-Rickettsiaceae”, which correspond to the
ancestors of Rickettsiales and Rickettsiaceae, respectively. Finally, we found that 2,135 genes were lost during the
evolution of the Rickettsiaceae to an intracellular lifestyle.
Conclusions: Our phylogenetic analysis allowed us to track the gene gain and loss events occurring in bacterial
genomes during their evolution from a free-living to an intracellular lifestyle. We have shown that the primary
mechanism of evolution and specialization in strictly intracellular bacteria is gene loss. Despite the intracellular
habitat, we found several horizontal gene transfers between Rickettsiales species and various prokaryotic, viral and
eukaryotic species.

Background
Rickettsia species are best known as the causative agents
of vector-borne diseases, with rickettsial diseases representing an important cause of illness and death worldwide [1]. Rickettsia spp. have been isolated not only
from hematophagous arthropod vectors, such as lice,
ticks, fleas and mites [1], but also from several freshwater leeches [2-4], annelids, amoebae and plants [2].
The rickettsial species associated with arthropods are
split into 2 major groups: the spotted fever group (SFG),
which is associated with ticks, fleas and mites, and the

typhus group (TG), which is smaller and is associated
with human body lice (Rickettsia prowazekii) and fleas
(Rickettsia typhi) [2,5]. Rickettsia bellii and Rickettsia
canadensis exhibit important genomic divergences and
branch outside both groups [5]. Rickettsia spp. have
reduced genomes that vary in size from 1.1 MB for the
TG, 1.2-1.4 MB for the SFG and 1.5 Mb for R. bellii [2].
Gene loss is thought to be a feature of the evolution of
intracellular pathogenic bacteria [6-11]. In general, Rickettsiales genomes are still undergoing reduction, as supported by the R. prowazekii paradigm [12,13], which
makes them an excellent model in which to study this
process by observing interspecies variations in genome
size and gene content [2]. The absence of a given gene
in a genome (when compared to a related species) is

often considered to be the result of its loss in that genome [11]. Consequently, the evolutionary process of
gene loss in bacterial species has already been investigated in other studies [9,12,14,15].
Previous studies also showed that gene gain events
occur in Rickettsiales [12,16] by duplication. Given the
genetic isolation of Rickettsiales, alternative mechanisms
for gene gain seemed impossible until the discovery of
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events in rickettsial genomes [9,17-20]. These findings made it acceptable to
regard microbial genomes as dynamic entities that
evolve by both losing and acquiring genes [21]. Therefore, when comparing closely related genomes, the relative absence of a given gene in one genome could
potentially reflect gene gain in another genome.
Our objective was to study the evolution of Rickettsia
and Orientia species from a free-living lifestyle to an
intracellular one by considering gene loss and HGT
events. For the first time, we compared 3 members of
the intracellular Rickettsiales order (Rickettsia spp.,
Orientia spp., Anaplasma spp.) to a free-living, nonpathogenic alpha-proteobacterium (Caulobacter spp.).
Orientia tsutsugamushi are obligate intracellular bacteria
that live in mites and are the causative agent of scrub
typhus [22], while Anaplasma spp. are pathogenic parasites that cause anaplasmosis in humans through tick
bites [23]. As previously mentioned, gene loss in Rickettsiales has already been investigated, but here, we distinguished truly lost genes from genes gained by other
species. Therefore, to identify HGT, we constructed systematic phylogenies for every gene that appeared to be
missing. We were able to verify HGT events reported by
previous studies, and we were able to describe previously unidentified events as well as to define the origin
of each transferred gene. After identifying true gene loss
and HGT, we reconstructed the ancestral gene sets of
alpha-proteobacteria, proto-Rickettsiales, proto-Rickettsiaceae and proto-Rickettsia, which helped us to predict
the number of genes lost during the passage from a
free-living to an intracellular lifestyle (See Additional
File 1: Figure S1). Finally, we attempted a reconstruction
of the first Rickettsia genealogy of all gained genes.

Results
We found that 701 riCOGs (COGs found only in Rickettsia spp.) were common to the 11 rickettsial species in
our study, 995 riCOGs were absent from at least 1 of
the 11 rickettsial species and 1,954 open reading frames
(ORFs) were specific to 1 of the 11 species (See Additional File 1: Table S1). Functional characterization of
the riCOGs is described in Figure S2 (See Additional
File 1: Figure S2). We observed that 929 rioriCOGs
(COGs obtained comparing Rickettsia spp. and Orientia
spp.) were found in both Rickettsia and Orientia. In

total, 173 rioriCOGs were found only in Rickettsia, and
119 were identified only in Orientia. Finally, cross-comparisons of Rickettsia spp., Orientia spp., Anaplasma
spp. and Caulobacter detected 191 ricauCOGs (COGs
obtained comparing all 4 genera) in all 4 genera, 102 in
Rickettsia, Orientia and Anaplasma only, 281 in Anaplasma only and 1,982 in Caulobacter only.
Phylogenomic analysis

A phylogenomic tree constructed based on gene content
(i.e., the presence or absence of COGs) showed a genus
organization for Rickettsiae that was different from a
whole core gene concatenated tree [24] (Figure 1) or
even a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences
[5]. On our phylogenomic tree, R. felis and R. akari are
not placed within the SFG, in contrast to what would
normally be expected. Rather, R. felis clusters with
R. bellii, while R. akari clusters with the TG and R.
canadensis. However, the branch leading to R. akari has
a low bootstrap, probably due to phylogenetic uncertainty. This phylogenomic analysis shows that the rickettsial gene repertoires have different evolutionary
histories. The phylogenomic tree suggests that differential gene loss and lateral gene acquisition may have
played important roles in the evolution of some Rickettsia spp. Indeed, genes acquired from distant sources are
more likely to supply novel traits that would set the
recipient apart from its relatives [25]. We also analyzed
the species organization for the different functional
COG categories (See Additional File 1: Figure S3). Likewise, using the tree based on whole-genome content,
phylogenomic analysis for the different functions
revealed many topologies that differ from that of the
whole core gene tree or the 16 S rRNA based tree.
These results suggest that gene loss and HGT are relevant for all gene functions.
HGT and phylogenetics

We used single-gene phylogenies to investigate the evolution of rickettsial gene content. When comparing 2
species, genes that are absent in one species could have
either been lost in that species or gained in the other
through HGT. To detect HGT, phylogenetic trees were
constructed for Rickettsiales genes that were found to
not be common to all Rickettsiales spp. and compared
to the Tree of Life (See Material and Methods). Among
the 995 riCOGs that were missing from at least 1 rickettsial species, we found 6 genes that were likely
obtained by the other Rickettsia species via HGT (Table
1, See Additional File 2: Phylogenetic trees). These
genes were acquired from several organisms, ranging
from gamma-proteobacteria to eukaryotes. The functions of these transferred genes are diverse; the genes
code for enzymes with synthase or proteolytic activities.

Special interest should be given to the metK gene
(riCOG00983), which codes for S-adenosylmethionine
synthetase; phylogenies suggest that this gene was transferred from gamma-proteobacteria to Rickettsia species.
Sequence analysis showed that the metK gene is degrading at different rates in the Rickettsia species that do
not appear on the phylogenetic tree, while it is conserved in R. akari, and R. felis. This result agrees with
the studies of Andersson [8] on the metK gene. This
degradation confirms our hypothesis regarding gene loss
in species where the gene is absent. Phylogenetic analysis showed that among the 129 rioriCOGs missing from
at least one Rickettsia spp., 3 have likely been subject to
HGT. These genes were obtained from different organisms, including gamma-proteobacteria, protists and
viruses (Table 1). They code for enzymes with hydrolase
activity and for ankyrin-repeat containing proteins.
Rickettsiae as gene donors

We identified 3 examples where Rickettsia and Orientia
were probably gene donors in HGT events. Rickettsia
spp. from the SFG contributed a gene coding for a
nucleotidyltransferase substrate binding protein to the
Firmicutes spp. and Bacteroidetes spp., and the

rickettsial ancestor contributed a gene coding for a
putative permease to gamma-proteobacteria spp. Orientia species contributed a Na+/proline symporter histidine kinase gene to Bacteroidetes spp. These genes have
various functions, including transposase and transferase
activities (Table 2). We did not identify any HGT events
in the genomes of Anaplasma spp., supporting the fact
that none have ever been identified by any previous studies [10].
Gene gain during rickettsial evolution

Gene gains occurred at different times during rickettsial
evolution, and the rate of HGT varies among species
(Figure 2). Genes were gained before the separation of
the SFG and TG (2 genes) and, subsequently, during
speciation events within the SFG (4 genes). We identified one HGT event in Orientia tsutsugamushi Ikeda
but none in Orientia tsutsugamushi Boyrong. R. canadensis, with 3 horizontally transferred genes, exhibited
the highest rate of HGT among the species studied.
Most of the horizontally transferred genes in SFG were
gained ancestrally; however, R. akari and R. felis gained
2 genes even after specialization. R. prowazekii and R.
typhi are the only Rickettsia species in which no gene

rioriCOGs

Six riCOGs probably transferred by different bacteria, animals and plants to rickettsial species and 3 rioriCOGs probably transferred by gamma-proteobacteria
species, viruses and protists to the Orientia genus. Transferred genes have various functions including protein-protein interaction and metabolic activity. HGT
took place at different levels of evolution and at some cases it was followed by gene loss in some species.

gains were found to have occurred after their separation
from the SFG. In some species, HGT events were followed by gene loss (Table 1).
De novo appearance

Genes present exclusively in Rickettsia spp. may correspond to genes that are the result of de novo gene formation. New genes often arise through the duplication
of existing genes or through fusion/fission events [26].
Genes originating from non-coding DNA are extremely
rare [26]. However, the short lengths of our 17 analyzed
sequences indicate that they are likely to be newly arisen
genes or, possibly, pseudogenes (Table 3). We only evaluated the 17 longest sequences because the probability
that a sequence will be non-coding increases as
sequence length decreases. Based on pair-wise ω ratio
tests (ω = Ka/Ks = non synonymous/synonymous substitutions) on our 17 analyzed sequences, only 2 appear to
be functional, given that their ω ratio is significantly less
than 1. Of these genes, 3 seem to be evolving toward

becoming coding regions in some lineages, while 12
others are apparently either non-functional or pseudogenes (their ω ratio is not significantly less than 1). The
functions of the protein products of the true genes are
unknown, and none have any annotated protein
domains. Further studies are needed to investigate the
functions of these novel genes.
Gene loss during rickettsial evolution

After eliminating the genes gained by HGT, we were
able to deduce the gene sets of “proto-Rickettsia” and
“proto-Rickettsiaceae”, which correspond to the ancestors of current rickettsial spp. and Rickettsiaceae, respectively, using the PARS algorithm [27] (See Material and
Methods). A comparison of the gene content between
species showed that Rickettsia spp. share 1,027 genes
that were probably vertically transferred from “protoRickettsia” (Figure 3). R. prowazekii and R. typhi have
lost the largest number of genes (284 genes), whereas
R. bellii has maintained all of the 1,027 acquired genes.

We found no gene loss in R. bellii, and indeed, this species has more genes than the rickettsial ancestor due to
HGT. We only identified one such transfer because our
study was restricted to the uncommon COGs. The
group containing R. conorii, R. massiliae, R. rickettsii

and R. africae lost many genes (128 genes) following its
association with ticks and its separation from the R.

When the ω ratio was significantly inferior to 1 (p-value < 0.05), we considered that we have a coding region. According to the ω ratio test, raf_ORF0703 and
raf_ORF0265 are functional.
Their function in not known. On the contrary, the twelve following sequences seem to correspond to no coding regions, while raf_ORF0046, raf_ORF0275 and
raf_ORF0921 seem to be non-functional. Only a transcriptomic analysis could show for sure if these regions are really coding or not. By chance, all of these genes
are found in R. africae and to calculate the ω ratio we took as reference sequence the R. africae sequence.
*The length given in nucleotides is the sequence length in Rickettsia africae and the AT % content is the one corresponding to Rickettsia africae.

lost the largest number of genes, followed by R. canadensis and R. akari. The gene loss that occurred during the separation of the SFG from the
TG mainly involves genes coding for metabolism and information storage and processing. Losses at species level equally affect genes of all
functions. The figure represents the species tree as deduced from the concatenation of whole core gene of 11 Rickettsia spp. [Merhej et al., 2009
[24]]. Numbers at arrows show the number of lost genes. Genes were classified into four functional categories: information storage and
processing in pink, cellular processes and signaling in green, metabolism in blue and poorly characterized functions in grey. Numbers in the
colored squares indicate the percentage of lost genes in the corresponding category. Gain penalty was set at five using PARS algorithm.

storage and processing. Losses at the species level
equally affect genes of all functions (Figure 3).
The “proto- Rickettsiaceae” contained 1,944 genes. Thus,
the Rickettsiaceae have lost 2,135 genes during their
evolution to an intracellular lifestyle. Following their
speciation and distinction from the Orientia genus,
the Rickettsiae lost 1,015 genes (See Additional File 1:
Figure S4).

Discussion
Several studies have searched for HGT events in various
species [28-35], including rickettsial species [18,19,36],
but their results have rarely been used for genome
reconstruction. In the instances where reconstructions
have been performed, they have been based on assumptions and estimations by changing “gain and loss

penalties” [31,32] that consider gene loss more likely to
occur than gene gain. Furthermore, the origin of the
transferred genes is not always clear [30]. Our phylogenetic analysis-based strategy allowed us to reconstruct,
for the first time, the gene sets of “proto-Rickettsiales”,
“proto-Rickettsiaceae” and “proto- alpha-proteobacteria”
by accounting for gene loss and gain events.
The content of the alpha-proteobacterial ancestor was
estimated at 3,000-4,000 genes, which is also the result
suggested in a previous study [15]. Looking further, we
were able to determine that Rickettsiaceae lost 2,135
genes during their evolution to an intracellular lifestyle,
and we described the rate of gene loss in 11 Rickettsia
spp. We found that R. bellii has maintained all “protorickettsial” genes, while R. prowazekii and R. typhi have
lost the largest number of ancestral genes and have the

Georgiades et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:6
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/6

smallest genomes in Rickettsia. These 2 species present
a restricted host range and exhibit extensive gene loss,
together with reduced gene gain [9,36]. The differences
in gene repertoires between current Rickettsia spp. are
mainly the result of differential gene losses from the
ancestor [9]. Gene loss at the species level is relevant for
genes from all functional categories. The different functional repertoires seem to play important roles in the
adaptation of Rickettsia spp. to their various hosts.
Finally, the analysis of gene repertoires seems to be crucial for species definition [37]; differential gene losses
help in the creation of new rickettsial species.
We found 9 genes that seem to have been gained by
Rickettsia and Orientia spp. through HGT. Most gene
gains took place before the separation of the SFG and
the TG. However, horizontally acquired genes were then
degraded [36], or completely lost, especially in the species belonging to the TG. Some genes seem to have
been gained independently by different rickettsial species
after their speciation. Transferred genes include transposases and ankyrin repeat-containing proteins and have
various origins including different bacteria, animals and
plants. Thus, we found genes encoding ankyrin repeatcontaining proteins that appear to have been transferred
from viruses and protists to Orientia species. These
results suggest that genetic exchanges could have
occurred between protists and their symbionts [38], as
was found to be the case for R. bellii and amoebae [17].
Using a BLAST search against the “non-redundant”
database (NR), we demonstrated that some of the horizontally transferred riCOGs that we identified show
similarity to protist sequences, even when the probable
donor species are not protists (See Additional File 1:
Table S2). Protists, especially amoebae, appear to have
played a significant role as a melting pot for genetic
exchange [17,39]. The genome of R. bellii includes many
genes related to those of amoebal symbionts [17], perhaps due to ancient gene exchanges between an ancestor of R. bellii and other amoebal hosts. It is plausible
that the first host cell of Rickettsia was a protist [2].
Similarly, the intracellular lifestyles of Rickettsia and
Orientia spp. allowed them to donate genes to Firmicutes spp., Bacteroidetes spp. and gamma-proteobacteria
spp. The transferred genes encode for proteins with
transposase, proteolysis and hydrolase activities. However, the biological significance of these HGT events
cannot currently be inferred, and the biological impact
of gene transfers remains to be investigated.
Phylogenies of Rickettsia spp. revealed that some gene
sequences do not have any significant homologues in
the NR database and may therefore have appeared
de novo. The origin and function of such genes remain
a mystery [40]. There are at least two steps involved in
the evolution of new protein-coding genes from

Page 8 of 14

ancestral non-coding DNA. First, the DNA must be
transcribed, and the locus that did not originally encode
a protein has to acquire an ORF. Second, the new ORF
must be transcribed through the use of a nearby existing
gene promoter [26]. In Rickettsia, 15 of the 17
sequences analyzed are either nonfunctional or are in
the process of adopting functionality. These sequences
may also correspond to inactivated genes that are being
degraded by mutation (pseudogenes). Of course, we
should not neglect the fact that for closely related bacterial species, the Ka/Ks ratio might change over time
because the selective consequences of non-synonymous
change are not always effectively instantaneous [41]. It
is also possible that these sequences may have been the
result of HGT from lineages that have yet to be
sequenced. It was recently proposed that such “ORFans”
could also represent genes of viral or plasmidic origin
[42,43]. Indeed, our candidates are short and AT-rich,
as has been proposed for ORFans of viral origin
(Table 3). However, given that they do not currently
match any homologous sequences in any databases, we
consider them to be probable de novo genes. It will
therefore be interesting to determine the origin of these
sequences and whether they are genuinely functional
and, even more importantly, to determine their function.

Conclusions
Previous studies have suggested that gene loss is a major
evolutionary force that acts during the reductive evolution of intracellular bacteria [15,44,45]. Our phylogenetic
analysis-based strategy of examining each missing gene
allowed us to confirm that Rickettsiales are mainly
shaped by gene loss. Genome size differences observed
between obligate intracellular and free-living bacteria
indeed result from genome reduction. However, we also
detected HGT events that had not been previously identified and constructed the “proto-Rickettsia” genealogy
based on quantitative genetic data. Therefore, our
approach can be applied to better define bacterial evolutionary histories, and further cross-comparisons with
other Rickettsiales, such as Wolbachia or Pelagibacter
ubique, could help pinpoint specific HGT events leading
to the intracellular lifestyle of Rickettsia. Finally, substantial horizontal gene transfers could help to accurately define bacterial spp. by allowing the phylogenetic
history of genes that occur sporadically among multiple
taxa to be traced.

also included the Rickettsia slovaca 13-B proteome [project
ID: 15712]. Orthologous genes were identified using
the COGsoft program (E-value = 10 -20 and coverage
≥ 70%) [47].
Gene content phylogeny

The COG data were used to construct a whole-genome
phylogenetic tree based on gene content. We generated
a matrix of binary discrete characters (“0” and “1” for
absence and presence, respectively). Using this matrix,
we constructed a phylogenetic tree implementing the
neighbor-joining (NJ) method within PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) [48]. The intergenomic distance
used was that defined by Snel [49] (Table 4).
Construction of phylogenies

We also conducted phylogenetic analyses of COGs,
excluding those shared by all Rickettsia spp. Therefore,
we analyzed the following COGs: 1) those found only in

Rickettsia (riCOGs) and absent in at least one rickettsial
species, 2) those obtained after comparisons of Rickettsia spp. and Orientia spp. (rioriCOGs) and 3) those
obtained after comparisons of Rickettsia spp., Orientia
spp., Anaplasma spp. and Caulobacter spp. (ricauCOGs). Homologous sequences were queried within an
NR database, and multiple alignments of homologous
sequences were made using MUSCLE [50]. Data producing a bias (such as skewing toward short sequences) or
noise were automatically eliminated. Based on the multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees were constructed
using three different methods: neighbor joining (NJ),
maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood
(ML). Paralogous sequences were detected by comparing
gene trees against a reference species tree (Tree of Life),
and functionality was verified using web databases
including GeneOntology or NCBI’s dbEST. These paralogous sequences were deleted from our study.
Analysis of phylogenies

We used phylogenies to distinguish between gene loss
and horizontal gene transfer. When the tree topology
obtained from the phylogeny of a riCOG corresponded
to the topology of the Tree of Life, the riCOG was considered to be lost by the species absent in the tree. In
contrast, when the phylogeny presented Rickettsiales
spp. anchored in a non-alpha-proteobacteria clade, we
concluded that the riCOG was gained through HGT
from the organism with which the rickettsial species was
grouped. Due to the presence of many phylogenetic artifacts, we only considered the HGT hypothesis for trees
with high bootstrap values (> 60) for at least one of the
3 methods. A TBLASTN was used for every possible
HGT to eliminate the potential problem of missing data.
Some phylogenies containing species only from Rickettsiales might be explained because the corresponding

genes are short sequences that are inadequate for phylogenic analysis. These genes might be the result of putative de novo appearances. Thus, we estimated the pairwise ω = Ka/Ks values for these genes and their
BLASTN matches using the codeml software [51].
Sequences with ω < 1 likely represent a protein-coding
exon. A c2- test was used to determine whether ω ratios
were significantly less than one. Therefore, when the
P value was less than 0.05, the sequences were considered non-functional.
Reconstruction of the ancestral gene set

After eliminating the possible gained genes, we reconstructed the gene set of “proto-Rickettsiales” and “protoRickettsiaceae” using a parsimony approach implemented in a two-pass algorithm [27]. The rickettsial species
tree based on the whole gene core was coupled with the
algorithm. The phyletic pattern of all COGs (i.e., the
matrix indicating presence or absence) in each species
analyzed was mapped onto this tree. The numbers of
lost COGs were determined at ancestral nodes and at
each leaf. We used the maximum possible gain penalty
(i.e., 5) so that only gene losses appeared on the tree.
Caulobacter spp. were used as outgroup for the reconstruction of the ancestral gene set.

Reviewers’ comments
Reviewer’s report 1

Arcady Mushegian, Department of Bioinformatics, Stowers
Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.
Reviewer 1

The manuscript by Georgiades et al. is concerned with
evolution of gene content in Rickettsiales, a group of
alpha-proteobacteria whose genomes must have experienced considerable gene losses in the process of becoming parasites. The authors used several existing
algorithms to estimate specific gains and losses and to
reconstruct a putative common ancestor of the group.
The conclusions of the paper seem quite reasonable, but
I have several concerns about methods and about specific examples shown in the Supplement 1. I suspect that
a bit more detailed explanation would set this all right.
More specifically, in order: Lines 123-124: “Genes that
are absent in one species could either have been lost by
this species or gained by another species via HGT” This does not have to be an ‘either-or’ proposition, it
could be both - has this been considered?
Author’s response We agree with the reviewer on this
point. An absent gene could have been gained and then
lost, especially if the gain took place at an ancestral
level. This idea has been considered; as shown in Table
1, we have mentioned the species that have gained genes
by HGT and the species that have lost these genes after
speciation (see also lines 166-167).

Page 10 of 14

Reviewer 1

Line 177: “After eliminating the genes gained by HGT” after eliminating genes gained by HGT, the authors
could have rebuilt the gene content tree; have this been
done? Is this “purged” gene-content tree closer to the
16S RNA tree than the initial gene-content tree? And
throughout the rest of the paper, which ‘species tree’ of
the three possible trees was used (it is sometimes indicated, but not always).
Author’s response A gene content tree without the genes
gained by HGT has not been rebuilt. We obtained strong
evidence for only 12 HGT events. Therefore, the elimination of 12 genes from a phylogeny containing more than
a thousand genes will not give a topology different from
that of the initial tree.
Throughout the rest of the paper, the tree used for the
reconstruction of the ancestral gene set was the whole
core gene concatenated tree, while the single-gene phylogenies used for HGT identification were compared to the
“Tree of Life”, as defined by the 16S RNA sequences. This
is now clarified in the paper (lines: 111-112, 132, 312313, 318-319, 335-336).
Reviewer 1

Methods: line 284: In building neighbour-joining trees
from the binary matrix of gene content, which intergenomic distance was used - the importance of the
appropriate normalization has been emphasized in
literature.
Author’s response The intergenomic distance was that
defined by Snel et al. [49]. The matrix of gene content
was determined as follows: we calculated the percentage
of genes shared between genomes i.e. the number of genes
shared between genomes divided by the number of genes
in the smallest genome (See Table 4).
Reviewer 1

“Caulobacter was used as outgroup” - in which cases?
How is it compatible with the cases, discussed in the
same paragraph, when Rickettsiae were attached to the
non-alpha-proteobacteria?
Author’s response Caulobacter was used as outgroup for
the reconstruction of the ancestral gene set. The phrase
was mistakenly placed in the wrong paragraph; this is
now corrected (see Methods, lines 340-341).
Reviewer 1

Lines 305-307: “When the tree topology obtained from a
riCOG was similar to the phylogeny of the tree from 16
S rRNA sequences...” - does ‘similar’ means ‘same’ here
(i.e., the same when branches corresponding to the species lacking this COGs are pruned in the species tree),
or ‘similar but not the same’?
Author’s response These lines have been rephrased in
the paper (see Methods, lines 318-320). “Similar” here
does not mean “identical"; it means ” as close to the
“Tree of Life” topology as possible”.

Reviewer 1

Lines 307-309: “When, on the contrary, the phylogeny
presented Rickettsiales spp. anchored in a non-alpha
proteobacteria clade, we concluded that the riCOG was
gained through HGT” - do the authors mean the whole
riCOG, or only some genes in it? Table 1 seems to indicate the latter? What if there are no alpha-proteobacteria (other than Rickettsia) in the tree (see examples?)
Author’s response We consider that a riCOG is a gene.
If there are no alpha-proteobacteria in a single-gene
phylogeny (other than Rickettsia), then this is strong evidence of gene gain by Rickettsia only.
Reviewer 1

Lines 324-325: “The whole genome sequence-based rickettsial species tree was coupled with the algorithm.” Which one (see above), and why the choice?
Author’s response It is the whole core gene concatenated
tree that was coupled to the algorithm. This point has
been clarified in the Methods (lines 336-337). This tree
gives a more robust and accurate phylogeny. Furthermore, this phylogeny corresponds to the phenotypic classification dividing Rickettsia spp. into the Typhus Group,
Spotted Fever Group and a “group” of divergent species,
R. bellii and R. canadensis [5,24].
Reviewer 1

Sup. file 1: are trees in this file rooted or not? They
seem to be unrooted but arbitrarily shown as rooted,
which may cause visual artefacts, e.g.: riCOG01685: if
the tree is rearranged properly (i.e., all Metazoans,
including rotifer Philodina, shown as one clade which is
well-supported), we see the Rickettsia clade as a deep
branch between plants and animals; where is the HGT?
rioriCOG00831: Canarypox virus and Orientia spp.
sequences are intermingling branches without modest
support - maybe both of them are basal, again no HGT?
rioriCOG00862 may be a similar situation: looks like
there is a Trichomonas vaginalis clade and an Orientia
spp. clade - where is the HGT evidence?
Author’s response According to the reviewer’s comment,
the trees were changed and are now rooted (Additional
File 2).
riCOG01685: Rickettsia found in a branch between
plants and animals show a HGT from plants and animals to Rickettsia.
rioriCOG00831: Canarypox virus seems to surround
Orientia spp.; it is more likely a HGT from Canarypox
virus to Orientia spp.
rioriCOG00862: In this phylogeny, the only species present are Trichomonas vaginalis and Orientia species. This
evidence supports a probable HGT toward Orientia spp.

Reviewer 2

Generally, a fine study, describing the evolutionary
reconstruction of the evolution of a large group of bacterial endosymbionts. I think the study would benefit
from employing a state of the art Maximum Likelihood
method for the reconstruction of gene repertoires such
as Count by Miklos Csuros (Csurös M. Count: evolutionary analysis of phylogenetic profiles with parsimony
and likelihood. Bioinformatics. 2010 Aug 1; 26(15):19102). This is unlikely to change the conclusions dramatically but would yield more robust results.
Author’s response We would like to thank the reviewer
for the comment on the use of maximum likelihood
method. However, we insist on our choice of the maximum parsimony method because the gene contents’ evolution models are still unclear. Furthermore, we were
able, using the PARS algorithm, to eliminate gained
genes from the reconstruction and give high-gain penalties to make gene losses appear on the tree. We are, however, preparing a future approach using parsimony and
branch lengths to reconstruct ancestral genomes (RoyerCarenzi M, Didier G, personal communication).
Reviewer 2

I am concerned about one conclusion of the paper,
namely, that 17 genes in Rickettsia probably evolved
de novo. The authors themselves consider alternatives
such as rapid evolution and horizontal gene transfer
from an unknown source, and I think these are actually
much more plausible than the de novo explanation.
Author’s response Rapid evolution and HGT from
unknown sources are effectively plausible alternatives, as
is a possible viral origin of these genes. These are scenarios that we are not neglecting. However, given that there
is an important proportion of ORFans genes in bacterial
genomes, it is not irrational to consider de novo creation.
Finally, because they do not currently match with any
homologs in any databases, we consider them to be probable de novo genes. This point has been reinforced in our
Discussion (lines 256-261).

Reviewer 3

Georgiades and co-workers report a phylogenomic analysis of the order Rickettsiales, in order to identify the
mechanisms of reductive evolution that shape the history of this order. Rickettsiales are members of the phylum proteobacteria, subdivision alpha. They are
intracellular parasites of eukaryotic cells and « closely »
related to the ancestor of mitochondria. Rickettsiales are
therefore interesting both from a medical and an evolutionary expertise. Several genomes of Rickettsia have

Georgiades et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:6
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/6

been now sequenced and already submitted to extensive
comparative genomic analyses because of their medical
and evolutionary interest. The analysis of Georgiades
and co-workers update previous analyses by including
11 genomes of Rickettsiales and a Caulobacter as outgroup. They have obtained from their phylogenomic
analysis a more precise estimation of the gene content
of the last common ancestors of Rickettsia, Rickettsiales
and Rickettsiae Their result confirm that, as expected,
intracellular Rickettsia have mainly evolved by gene loss.
The authors have focused on the distinction between
gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, by analyzing
individual phylogenies of genes absent in one species.
They identify several cases of HGT and propose the
direction of the transfer and potential sources for the
donor (in the case of transfer to Rickettsiae) or the recipient (in the case of transfer from Rickettsiae). The
number of transfer detected is very limited 12, versus
more than 2000 gene losses), but raises interesting biological questions. In the case of transfer to Rickettsiae,
the authors suggest that it involved either eukaryotes
infected by a Rickettsia (possibly a protist) or another
parasite (a virus or a bacterium) infecting the Rickettsia
infected cell. They do not really discuss the case of
transfer from Rickettsiae. They are very rare but quite
interesting since they suggest that descendants of the
parasitic bacterium that received the rickettsial gene
within the infected eukaryotic cell were later on able to
transfer this gene to free living bacterium. This confirms
that intracellular pathogens are not completely close
systems but can participate to the network of gene
transfer in nature. For example, this suggests that a
eukaryotic gene (or the gene of a eukaryotic virus) could
be transferred to free living bacteria by the intermediate
of an intracellular pathogenic bacteria.
Author’s response HGT events both from and toward
Rickettsiae are the result of their intracellular lifestyle.
However, concerning the transfers from Rickettsiae, two
out of three times, the donation of the gene took place at
an ancestral level. It is the Spotted Fever Group and the
proto-Rickettsiales that contributed genes and not the
current Rickettsia spp. (See Table 2). This result suggests
that the more specialized a species becomes, the more it
becomes a closed system. This remark is even more convincing when looking at R. prowazekii, whose evolution is
characterized exclusively by gene loss [9,12] (See lines
213-217). R. prowazekii is a true obligate intracellular
human-specialized pathogen that does not participate in
the network of gene transfer in nature.
Reviewer 3

In their analysis, the authors compare the individual
gene trees obtained to the 16 S rRNA tree to distinction between gene loss and horizontal gene transfer.

Page 12 of 14

It is unclear if this is the best strategy, since 16 S
rRNA should be quite similar between Rickettsiae,
with possibly a lack of resolution of the tree. They
mention the whole core gene concatenated tree. Is
this tree congruent with the 16 S rRNA tree? The
authors could have updated this tree and use it as
the reference species tree in their analysis. In any
case, it should be interesting to have on the same figure the whole genome tree compared to the species
tree (preferentially based on core gene phylogeny)
(Figure 1).
Author’s response The individual gene trees are compared to the “Tree of Life” phylogeny that corresponds to
the classification of all species according to their 16S
RNA sequences. We believe that this point is now clarified in the paper (lines 313-314, 318-320). The whole
core gene concatenated tree is similar to the 16S RNA of
rickettsial species but is not exactly identical (lines 112113). According to the reviewer’s comment on Figure 1,
we presented both the whole genome phylogenomic tree
and the whole core gene concatenated tree in the same
figure (Figure 1A, B). We would like to thank the
reviewer for this suggestion.
Reviewer 3

The authors also identify a low number of new genes
without homologues in data base (ORFans) in Rickettsia. They indicate that the origin and function of such
genes remain a mystery. In fact, it has been recently
shown that many ORFans in Archaeal and bacterial
genomes have a viral or plasmidic origin (Cortez et al.,
2009). These genes are usually short, AT-rich, and
located in genome region with traces of active or
ancient integrated extra chromosomal elements. What
about the genes detected here? Is it possible to imagine
a viral origin? What is known about plasmid and or
viruses in Rickettsiae? Cortez et al., have described several putative provirus’s (proplasmids) in several Rickettsiae (Additional data file 3 in Cortez et al., 2009). It
could be interesting to use their analysis to see if some
ORFans genes or genes involved in loss and HGT
described here belong to these putative integrated
elements.
(Cortez D, Forterre P, Gribaldo S: A hidden reservoir
of integrative elements is the major source of
recently acquired foreign genes and ORFans in
Archaeal and bacterial genomes. Genome Biol. 2009

Author’s response Based on the reviewer’s comment,
except from the short length of our ORFans genes, which
was already pointed out, the AT % content was verified.
Indeed, these genes are AT- rich (See revised Table 3), so
the possibility of a viral origin is now discussed in the
paper (lines: 256-261).

Additional file 1: Four supplementary figures and two
supplementary tables. Figure S1. Phylogenetic analysis-based strategy.
Figure S2. Functional characterization of the rickettsial COGs. The
functional categories were determined by the COGs database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/grace/fiew.cgi. Figure S3. Phylogenomic
clustering of Rickettsia spp. in the different COG functional categories.
Topologies are different for each functional category. Figure S4. Gene
loss. Tentative scenario of gene loss in Rickettsiales from “ proto-alphaproteobacteria“ (a) to current Rickettsia spp. Gene sets of “ proto-alphaproteobacteria“,” proto-Rickettsiales“ (b) and “ proto-Rickettsiaceae“ (c) were
estimated using the PARS algorithm with a gain penalty of five. Table S1.
Determination of COGs. The total number of ORFs in the studied species,
number of COGs and specific genes are indicated. Table S2. Horizontally
transferred genes with sequences that produced a BLAST hit with protist
sequences. E-value < e-3 and identity >25%.
Additional file 2: Phylogenetic trees showing HGT events as
generated by the ML method. For genes gained by Rickettsiales the
donors are colored in green and for the cases for which the Rickettsiales
gave genes the receivers are colored in blue.
