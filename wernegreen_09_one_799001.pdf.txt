Abstract
Background: Bacterial endosymbiosis has a recurring significance in the evolution of insects. An estimated 1020% of insect species depend on bacterial associates for their nutrition and reproductive viability. Members of the
ant tribe Camponotini, the focus of this study, possess a stable, intracellular bacterial mutualist. The bacterium,
Blochmannia, was first discovered in Camponotus and has since been documented in a distinct subgenus of
Camponotus, Colobopsis, and in the related genus Polyrhachis. However, the distribution of Blochmannia throughout
the Camponotini remains in question. Documenting the true host range of this bacterial mutualist is an important
first step toward understanding the various ecological contexts in which it has evolved, and toward identifying its
closest bacterial relatives. In this study, we performed a molecular screen, based on PCR amplification of 16S
rDNA, to identify bacterial associates of diverse Camponotini species.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA gave four important insights: (i) Blochmannia occurs in a broad range
of Camponotini genera including Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and Opisthopsis, and did not occur in outgroups related
to this tribe (e.g., Notostigma). This suggests that the mutualism originated in the ancestor of the tribe
Camponotini. (ii) The known bacteriocyte-associated symbionts of ants, in Formica, Plagiolepis, and the
Camponotini, arose independently. (iii) Blochmannia is nestled within a diverse clade of endosymbionts of sapfeeding hemipteran insects, such as mealybugs, aphids, and psyllids. In our analyses, a group of secondary
symbionts of mealybugs are the closest relatives of Blochmannia. (iv) Blochmannia has cospeciated with its known
hosts, although deep divergences at the genus level remain uncertain.
Conclusions: The Blochmannia mutualism occurs in Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and Opisthopsis, in addition to
Camponotus, and probably originated in the ancestral lineage leading to the Camponotini. This significant
expansion of its known host range implies that the mutualism is more ancient and ecologically diverse than
previously documented. Blochmannia is most closely related to endosymbionts of sap-feeding hemipterans, which
ants tend for their carbohydrate-rich honeydew. Based on phylogenetic results, we propose Camponotini might
have originally acquired this bacterial mutualist through a nutritional symbiosis with other insects.

Background
Bacteria play important roles in the success and diversification of many animal groups, and insects are especially
prone to establishing long-term, mutualistic endosymbioses. An estimated 10-20% of insect species, in several taxonomic orders, depend on intracellular bacterial
mutualists for their viability and reproduction [1]. These
obligate associates, called 'primary' (P-) endosymbionts
because they are required for host survival and fecundity,
often synthesize key nutrients that are lacking in the hosts'
unbalanced diet (e.g., plant sap or vertebrate blood) [2-4].
In all cases, the bacteria live within specialized host cells
called bacteriocytes and undergo maternal transmission
to developing eggs or embryos. Consistent with this stable
transmission through host lineages, the phylogenies of Pendosymbionts match those of their insect hosts (e.g., [59]). This phylogenetic congruence points to host-symbiont cospeciation, which can be traced back to a single,
often ancient, infection event in each host group.
Among Hymenoptera, only members of the Formicidae
(ants) are known to possess bacteriocyte-associated endosymbionts. And within ants, despite the group's wide variety of symbioses with microbes [10], only three known
examples of such intracellular mutualisms exist. These
three cases occur in subfamily Formicinae: Formica, Plagiolepis, and all members of the tribe Camponotini screened
to date [11-14]. Although the symbioses are similar in
many respects, phylogenetic analysis of bacterial 16S
rDNA implies the three bacteriocyte-associated symbioses
in ants evolved independently [15].
The symbionts of Formica and Plagiolepis have not been
studied in depth, but have been documented within bacteriocytes on either side of the midgut epithelium. In Formica, symbionts are found within queen ovarioles and in
developing brood [12,13,16]. The bacteria are considered
maternally transmitted, but their occurrence is erratic
among Formica species and can vary within species
depending on nutritional status [12].
Endosymbionts in the tribe Camponotini, the focus of
this study, are the best-studied bacterial mutualists in
ants. The bacterium, Blochmannia, was first discovered in
Camponotus [14] the second largest ant genus with ~1,000
described species worldwide [17]. The bacteria occur
within ant bacteriocytes, which are intercalated among
midgut epithelial cells, as well as queen and worker ovaries where symbionts infect the developing oocyte and are
closely integrated with host development [13,14,18,19].
Although Blochmannia densities apparently decline in
older lab-reared workers [20], and the bacteria can be
eliminated from workers treated with antibiotics [18], we
have never failed to find Blochmannia in any Camponotus
worker collected in the field (unpublished data), which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/292

total many hundred samples across diverse species. The
retention of many nutrient biosynthetic functions within
the Blochmannia genomes implies this symbiosis plays a
nutritional role [21,22]. Likewise, experimental diet treatments indicate that Blochmannia provides nutrients to the
host, including amino acids [23].
Among insects possessing long-term intracellular mutualists, which include several sap- and blood- feeding species, many Camponotus spp. stand out as true omnivores
that scavenge other insects as part of their complex diet.
Benefits conferred by Blochmannia might be critical during
specific periods in host individual and colony development [23-25] (unpublished data). In addition, perhaps
the symbiosis originated in an ant lineage that fed on a
nutritionally unbalanced diet, such as extant arboreal
Camponotus and Polyrhachis that obtain most nitrogen
from plant and insect exudates [26-28]. Like many other
ants, these arboreal species tend sap-feeding hemipterans,
such as mealybugs, aphids, and psyllids, for their carbohydrate-rich excrement, or 'honeydew' [29].
Like other P-endosymbionts, Blochmannia has codiverged
with its known ant hosts, reflecting an evolutionarily stable association. Several phylogenetic analyses of symbiont
and host genes have demonstrated cospeciation within
Camponotus [19,30,31]. In addition, Sameshima et al. [15]
showed that Blochmannia occurs in Polyrhachis and Colobopsis (currently a subgenus of Camponotus [17] but probably a separate lineage [32]), suggesting the symbiosis
originated before the divergence of these three taxa, on the
order of 40 MYA.
However, due to limited sampling, the actual distribution
of Blochmannia throughout the Camponotini is unknown.
Currently, the formal description of Camponotini
includes eight extant genera: Camponotus (including subgenus Colobopsis), Polyrhachis, Calomyrmex, Echinopla,
Opisthopsis, Forelophilus, Overbeckia, and Phasmomyrmex
[33]. To date, Blochmannia has been detected in Camponotus (including Colobopsis) and Polyrhachis as noted above,
and Stoll et al. [34] detected a Blochmannia-like bacterium
in association with an Echinopla species, based on a 367bp region of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene. Because several
Camponotini genera remain unsampled, the occurrence
of Blochmannia within the tribe is uncertain.
For context, Dasch [12] reported that eight genera of Camponotini possess intracellular bacterial symbionts, and
this number (eight) has been cited in subsequent work.
However, the genera cited by Dasch have since been
reclassified as subgenera of Camponotus (i.e., Tanaemyrmex, Myrmentoma, Myrmosericus, Myrmobrachys, Myrmocladoecus, Myrmothrix, and Colobopsis) [17].

In this study, our goals are (i) to better understand the
actual host range of Blochmannia, and (ii) to identify the
closest bacterial relatives and likely source of this mutualism. To this end, we screened for Blochmannia in a broader
representation of Camponotini genera, including Calomyrmex, Opisthopsis, and Echinopla. We also sampled a representative of Notostigma, a genus formerly considered
part of the Camponotini but recently placed in its own
tribe [33]. To screen for symbionts, we amplified and
sequenced a region of the 16S rDNA gene. Our results
indicate that Blochmannia is more widespread within the
tribe than previously documented and strongly suggest a
single, ancient origin for this endosymbiosis. In addition,
a close relationship with secondary endosymbionts of
mealybugs suggests a potential route for the acquisition of
Blochmannia. Specifically, the tribe Camponotini may
have acquired its bacterial partner by tending honeydewproducing hemipterans.

Results and discussion
PCR screen for Blochmannia
We screened 53 representatives of the Camponotini for
bacterial associates (Table 1). Specimens were identified
minimally to subgenus (when applicable) and in most
cases to species. The sample includes 42 Camponotus isolates, ten of which belong to the subgenus Colobopsis, as
well as four Polyrhachis, two Calomyrmex, four Opisthopsis,
and one Echinopla isolate. We also screened a representative of Notostigma, which was recently removed from the
tribe [33].

Our screen involved PCR with primers specific to the Blochmannia 16S rDNA gene. Direct sequencing of the resulting PCR products yielded high quality data for nearly all
isolates. (The few exceptions requiring alternative methods are noted as a footnote in Table 1 and detailed in the
Methods section.) The Genbank accession numbers for
the 52 new sequences obtained in this study are listed in
boldface in Table 2. All 16S rDNA sequences from the
Camponotini isolates proved to be a close match to
known Blochmannia strains, as detailed in the database
comparisons and phylogenetic analyses below. This indicates that our specific primers amplify a wide range of Blochmannia lineages across the tribe, but generally did not
amplify other bacteria that may associate with ants in various ways (e.g., on the body surface or in the gut lumen).
The 16S rDNA amplified from an outgroup related to this
tribe (Notostigma) did not match Blochmannia. In addition, previous work has screened other members of the
subfamily Formicinae for bacterial symbionts and failed
to detect Blochmannia. The bacterial symbiont in Formica
and Plagiolepis is not Blochmannia, as we have verified in
our phylogenetic analysis here. Moreover, we were unable

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/292

to amplify Blochmannia from a specimen of Oecophylla
smaradina (unpublished data).
Database comparisons
We compared new sequences to Genbank and to the
Ribosomal Database Project (RDP, release 10.5) [35].
These searches are based on sequence similarity and provide a very rough idea of taxonomic affiliation. Most new
bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from the Camponotini
most closely matched published Blochmannia in both databases. (Please see additional file 1 for a list of top
matches.) These include isolates of Calomyrmex and
Opisthopsis, where Blochmannia has not been detected
before, and Echinopla, where a short, Blochmannia-like
sequence was noted once previously [34]. For an additional four sequences, Blochmannia was the top match in
one of the two databases, and nearly the top in the other
database. Four members of the Colobopsis subgenus most
closely match other members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
Nonetheless, subsequent phylogenetic analysis (below)
groups these Colobopsis associates with Blochmannia with
very high confidence, illustrating the approximate nature
of the similarity-based database searches. The bacterial
associate of Notostigma carazzii did not match Blochmannia
in either database.
Phylogenetic results
Gamma-Proteobacteria analysis: Camponotini isolates group with
known Blochmannia strains
To test for the monophyly of presumed Blochmannia isolates and to position this group within the gamma-Proteobacteria, we estimated the phylogeny of 16S rDNA using
Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) approaches.
Taxa included candidates for the closest relatives of Blochmannia, based on matches in databases such as Genbank,
the RDP [35], and ARB [36]. Bayesian posterior probabilities were higher than ML bootstrap values, as expected
based on previous studies [37]. As a consequence, the
Bayesian consensus tree (Figure 1) showed higher resolution than did the ML bootstrap consensus tree. (The ML
tree of the gamma-Proteobacteria dataset is presented as
additional file 2.) Both methods support the monophyly
of known Blochmannia isolates and newly sampled Camponotini associates (Bayesian posterior probability of
1.00 and bootstrap support of 78%). The phylogenies also
illustrate that Plagiolepis and Formica endosymbionts represent independent lineages within the gamma-Proteobacteria, as suggested in an earlier study based on a
smaller taxon sample [15]. Interestingly, the Notostigma
isolate is closely related to Blochmannia but clearly falls
outside of that clade. This absence of Blochmannia is consistent with the removal of Notostigma from the Camponotini and assignment to its own tribe [32,33].
Whether the Notostigma isolate represents a symbiosis or
casual bacterial associate is uncertain.

addition to several Camponotini specimens, we screened one isolate of Notostigma, recently removed from the Camponotini and placed in its own tribe. For nearly all samples, the 16S rDNA
gene was amplified using Blochmannia-specific primers and the PCR product was sequenced directly. The three exceptions are as follows: aOverlapping primer pairs were used to amplify bacterial
16S rDNA from Opisthopsis haddoni 244; bCloning of PCR products was required for Opisthopsis PG01 and Notostigma carazzii 226; cUniversal eubacterial primers SL-SR were used to amplify
bacterial 16S rDNA from Notostigma carazzii 226.

These results demonstrate for the first time that Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and Opisthopsis possess bacterial associates that are part of the same clade as known Blochmannia
strains, consistent with a single origin of endosymbiosis
in the Camponotini. Although additional Camponotini
taxa remain to be screened from more rarely collected genera, we predict that Blochmannia will be pervasive
throughout the tribe. The three Camponotini genera not
included in our study (Forelophilus, Overbeckia, and Phasmomyrmex) together comprise only six living species and
represent a comparatively small component of the overall
diversity within the tribe. Indeed, current taxonomy suggests that Forelophilus and Overbeckia may be synonymous
with Camponotus [33].

nia is reconstructed with very high likelihood to be endosymbiotic, with a proportional likelihood of 0.9999
under both Mk1 model and AsymmMk model (expressed
as the proportion of the total probability of 1.0). Similarly, the ancestral node representing the MRCA of Blochmannia and the four closely-related mealybug
endosymbionts is inferred to have been endosymbiotic
(proportional likelihood 0.9999 under both models).
Camponotini is one of the major ant groups that commonly tend mealybugs, aphids, and other hemipterans
for their carbohydrate-rich honeydew [29,44] and may
have acquired Blochmannia through this route. Ants and
hemipterans have a long history of association, with fossil
evidence for this relationship occurring in Baltic (~44
MYA) and Dominican (15-20 MYA) amber deposits
[45,46]. Ants often have been observed to scavenge or kill
the hemipterans that they tend and transport the bodies
to their nests, presumably to help feed their colonies [4750]. Repeated consumption by ant larvae, the only stage
that can ingest particulate matter, may have selected for
sequestration of a hemipteran symbiont. Feeding interactions have been implicated in the horizontal transmission
of other endosymbiotic bacteria in insects including Wolbachia [51] and Rickettsia [52] although definitive experimental evidence for the successful establishment of an
endosymbiont via this pathway remains lacking [52].

This discovery of Blochmannia in diverse Camponotini
genera helps to refine the questions we ask about the evolution of this association. For example, it remains mysterious why the mutualism became established in this
group, but apparently not in other ant clades. What is distinct about Camponotini? This remains an open question.
Studying the full range of hosts will highlight conspicuous
exceptions, where the life history or physiology of ants
may impact the symbiosis. For example, while Blochmannia may be involved in claustral founding of new colonies
[38], Polyrhachis shows instances of semi-claustral founding, the only known example in a formicine ant [39]. In
addition, in a tribe in which the metapleural gland is often
missing [33], any role of symbionts in pathogen defense
may be particularly important (D. E. Wheeler and J. F. A.
Traniello, pers. comm.). This gland is a structure unique
to ants whose external secretions have been hypothesized
to serve antiseptic functions, although other functions
have been proposed that involve chemical defense, recognition odor, and territorial marking (U. Mueller, pers.
comm.). The metapleural gland is present in workers from
the vast majority of ant genera, including Calomyrmex,
Opisthopsis and Echinopla, but is absent from Polyrhachis
and most species of Camponotus. It is known to be present
in the workers of at least 13 Camponotus species including
C. gigas [40], C. thadeus [41], C. sericeus [42], and ten species of Camponotus (Myrmonesites) from Madagascar (B.
Fisher and U. Mueller, pers. comm.). These exceptions to
the rule offer natural experiments to explore the influence
of host biology on symbiont persistence and functions.

Blochmannia-focused analysis
We performed a more focused phylogenetic analysis that
included new bacterial sequences obtained here, as well as
28 published Blochmannia sequences. We analyzed the
data with and without mealybug endosymbionts as outgroups. Using Bayesian approaches, the unrooted (Figure
2) and rooted (Figure 3) phylogenies resolved four subgroups within Blochmannia that match genus-level distinctions among their ant hosts: Polyrhachis, Camponotus
subgenus Colobopsis (called Colobopsis here, for brevity),
Opisthopsis, and a fourth group composed of Camponotus,
Calomyrmex, and Echinopla. In rooted Bayesian trees, each
subgroup was resolved with high confidence (posterior
probabilities of 0.97-1.00). The ML analyses gave similar
results but with lower confidence. Unrooted and rooted
ML trees of Blochmannia are presented in additional files 3
and 4, respectively.

Our phylogenetic analysis of gamma-Proteobacteria position Blochmannia within a large, diverse group of insect
endosymbionts (Figure 1). This group includes many secondary symbionts of sap-feeding mealybugs, psyllids, and
aphids. In our analyses, a group of secondary symbionts
of mealybugs are the closest relatives of Blochmannia. This
group represents one of at least four distinct acquisitions
of gamma-Proteobacterial symbionts by mealybugs [43].
The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of Blochman-

In an analysis of ant relationships, Brady et al. [32] found
strong support for the grouping of Polyrhachis with Camponotus + Calomyrmex, the relationship reflected in schematic tree A (Figure 4). While the rooting of the
Camponotini was uncertain, it may occur along the
Opisthopsis lineage [32]. By contrast, our 16S rDNA dataset does not distinguish relationships among major subgroups within Blochmannia. For example, we considered
the three possible unrooted trees for these four lineages

52 new sequences obtained in this study are listed in boldface.

(trees A-C; Figure 4). The Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test
indicated the data cannot distinguish among the three
possible unrooted topologies (Table 3). To test whether
our dataset can resolve the root position, we also used the
SH test to evaluate the relative support for 15 trees that
represent the alternative rootings of trees A-C. The data do
not reject any of the 15 alternative trees, and thus cannot
reject any hypotheses for relationships among major Blochmannia lineages (Table 4). Additional data from rDNA
genes or other Blochmannia loci will be necessary to
resolve ancient divergences within this mutualism.
Agreement of bacterial and ant relationships
Agreement of the Blochmannia and host phylogeny is
expected, given that several previous studies demonstrate
host-symbiont cospeciation in this mutualism
[15,19,30,31]. While a formal cospeciation analysis is
beyond the scope of this study, the Blochmannia phylogeny suggests host-symbiont congruence at taxonomic levels previously unexamined. At the tribe level, we detected
Blochmannia only in association with Camponotini, and
not, for example, in Notostigma. At the genus level, the
major groups within Blochmannia match distinctions
among the ant hosts. In a comprehensive phylogenetic
analysis of ants, Brady et al. [32] confirmed that Camponotus is a polyphyletic assemblage. Colobopsis, although still
formally considered a subgenus of Camponotus [17], constitutes a distinct group that is separated from Camponotus
by intervening genera. Here, we found an identical pattern
in the 16S rDNA of associated Blochmannia. That is, Blochmannia from ants in the subgenus Colobopsis formed a
group that is distinct from other Camponotus. In addition,
the close relationship of bacteria from Calomyrmex and
Camponotus matches the affiliation of these ant genera
[32,53].

At shallower taxonomic levels, many well-resolved species-level relationships among Blochmannia agree with
known or predicted host relationships. Congruence has
already been documented in previous cospeciation studies of many species included here [15,19,30,31]. In addi-

tion, our new data illustrate further examples of recentlydiverged Blochmannia strains from ant hosts that are close
relatives [54]. Examples include C. quercicola and C. castaneus, C. rufipes and C. floridanus, C. hyatti and C. sayi, C.
balzani and C. silvicola, and the group containing C. sansabeanus, C. maritimus, C. semitestaceus and C. vicinus.
Although Camponotus subgenera are often polyphyletic
and not always good predictors of host relationships
[31,54], notably the Blochmannia of C. claviscapus and C.
occultus, both members of the subgenus Pseudocolobopsis,
are sister taxa. Furthermore, Blochmannia sampled from
the same Camponotus species but from different geographic areas are always closely related, usually as a
strongly supported monophyletic unit.
Caveats: Strengths and limitations of molecular data
The molecular approach presented here has clear advantages. This approach let us screen for symbionts using one
or few host specimens, infer relationships among the bacteria detected, and place newly-discovered isolates within
a broader phylogenetic context. However, based on DNA
sequence data alone, it is difficult to make strong conclusions about the type of association between Blochmannia
and the additional genera sampled here. For instance, it is
impossible to say for certain that the bacteria form stable,
obligate, intracellular relationships in each host genus i.e., that the type of mutualism well-characterized in Camponotus also occurs in Opisthopsis, Calomyrmex, and Echinopla. A complete characterization of Blochmannia in these
genera is beyond the scope of the current study, but ideally will include additional representatives of each genus
to test for symbiont persistence and stability, and will be
coupled with ultrastructural work to document the location of bacteria within host tissues or cells. Such characterizations will be a fruitful area for future research.

Despite these caveats, the demonstrated specificity of Blochmannia makes its detection in additional host genera
compelling. When a symbiont group is already well
described, the presence of that symbiont is frequently
based on molecular data alone, even when it is detected in

Relationships among diverse gamma-Proteobacteria, estimated from a region of the 16S rDNA gene

Relationships among diverse gamma-Proteobacteria, estimated from a region of the 16S rDNA gene. Within
Blochmannia, taxa are labeled by the ant host from which the bacterial gene was amplified. These and other ant symbionts are
noted in boldface. The phylogeny was estimated using Bayesian methods. The topology shown reflects the majority-rule consensus of post-burnin trees, and posterior probabilities are given at nodes. The results support the monophyly of known Blochmannia isolates and newly sampled Camponotini associates (posterior probability of 1.00), demonstrating for first time that
Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and Opisthopsis possess bacterial associates that are members of the same clade as known Blochmannia
strains. Blochmannia occurs within a large, diverse, and strictly-endosymbiotic group that includes a wide range of insect endosymbionts. Plagiolepis and Formica endosymbionts do not group with Blochmannia, showing independent origins of intracellular
endosymbioses within ants.

Blochmannia phylogeny estimated from a region of the 16S rDNA gene, analyzed without outgroups
Blochmannia phylogeny estimated from a region of the 16S rDNA gene, analyzed without outgroups. The analysis includes 50 new bacterial sequences from Camponotini and 28 published Blochmannia sequences. Taxon groups are labeled
by the ant host from which the bacterial gene was amplified. The phylogeny was estimated using Bayesian methods, and the
topology shown reflects the majority-rule consensus of post-burnin trees. Both this unrooted and rooted (Figure 3) phylogenies resolved four major lineages within Blochmannia: Polyrhachis, Colobopsis, Opisthopsis, and a fourth group composed of Camponotus, Calomyrmex, and Echinopla. In this unrooted tree, only the posterior probabilities of major nodes are marked.
Relationships within major groups resemble those in the rooted tree (Figure 3). Taxon names were removed for clarity, and
we refer the reader to the rooted tree for these data.
new hosts. In addition, our results support the hypothesis
that Blochmannia is monophyletic and evolved more than
40 MYA from an ancient, diverse clade consisting of intracellular endosymbionts. This pattern lends further support to the view that newly-discovered Blochmannia
lineages within the Camponotini also live within cells.
Moreover, the general agreement of host and symbiont
phylogenies bolsters the view that these bacterial associates form meaningful, stable associations with their hosts.

Conclusions
Our molecular screen and phylogenetic analysis of antassociated bacteria revealed four important results.

(i) We demonstrated for the first time that Calomyrmex
and Opisthopsis possess bacterial associates that are members of the same clade as known Blochmannia strains. Furthermore, we confirmed a similar finding for Echinopla.
These results significantly expand the range of known
hosts of this symbiont and suggest the mutualism is more
ancient and diverse than previously documented. Consistent with the recent removal of Notostigma from the Camponotini [33], we were unable to detect Blochmannia in a
specimen of this genus. Although additional Camponotini genera remain to be screened (Forelophilus, Overbeckia, and Phasmomyrmex), we predict that Blochmannia
will be pervasive throughout the Camponotini.

Blochmannia phylogeny estimated from a region of the 16S rDNA gene, analyzed with outgroups. The analysis
includes 50 new bacterial sequences from Camponotini, 28 published Blochmannia sequences, and four mealybug endosymbionts that we found to be the closest relatives to Blochmannia. Taxa are labeled by the ant host from which the bacterial gene
was amplified. The phylogeny was estimated using Bayesian methods, and the topology shown reflects the majority-rule consensus of post-burnin trees. Posterior probabilities of all nodes are marked. Taxon names of new samples are followed by a
sample ID number, whereas published Blochmannia sequences are not. Like the unrooted tree (Figure 2), this rooted phylogeny
resolved four major lineages within Blochmannia: Polyrhachis, Colobopsis, Opisthopsis, and a fourth group comprised of Camponotus, Calomyrmex, and Echinopla.

four major Blochmannia lineages may be related in three possible
ways, reflected in three unrooted trees A-C (see Figure 4).
2Non-significant results indicate that the likelihood score does not
differ significantly from that of the "best" tree (topology B).

(ii) The three known bacteriocyte-associated symbionts in
ants evolved independently in Formica, Plagiolepis, and the
Camponotini. The three symbionts constitute distinct lineages within the gamma-Proteobacteria.
(iii) Blochmannia is positioned within a diverse, strictly
endosymbiotic bacterial group and is reconstructed with
very high likelihood to have originated from an endosymbiotic ancestor. This larger bacterial group includes endosymbionts of mealybugs, psyllids, lice, weevils, Plagiolepis,
and tsetse flies. Our analysis suggests that a group of secondary symbionts of mealybugs constitute the closest relatives to Blochmannia, based on available sequence data,
and suggest a possible origin for the ant mutualism.
Unlike primary symbionts such as Blochmannia, secondary symbionts form dynamic associations and are known
to transfer among distinct insect species and, occasionally,
among insect superfamilies [55]. Camponotini might
have acquired the bacteria by tending mealybugs or other

sap-feeding hemipterans for their carbohydrate-rich honeydew.
(iv) We found that the phylogeny of Blochmannia agrees
with known relationships among Camponotini hosts at
taxonomic levels previously unexamined. We detected
four robust groups within Blochmannia: isolates from
Polyrhachis, Colobopsis, Opisthopsis, and a fourth group
composed of Camponotus (excluding Colobopsis), Calomyrmex, and Echinopla. Our data further support Colobopsis
as a lineage distinct from remaining Camponotus.
Exciting areas for future research include testing the prediction that Blochmannia are pervasive throughout the
Camponotini, by characterizing microbial associates of
unsampled genera and by documenting the tissue- and
cellular location of bacteria detected. Additional phylogenetic analysis, ideally based on expanded molecular and
morphological datasets, will shed light on the deep divergences among Camponotini genera and whether hosts
and symbionts codiverged in the earliest stages of this
ancient mutualism.

Methods
Molecular methods
For each ant sample, genomic DNA was prepared from
whole ants or from only the gaster (QIAGEN DNeasy kit).
In nearly all cases, single worker ants were used. Rarely,
two or more ant individuals from the same colony were
combined for a given DNA prep, particularly when ants
were small. For samples that gave very low yields of DNA,
we amplified the DNA using GenomiPhi (GE Life sciences). As a positive control for DNA quality and quantity,

phylogenies.

Schematic trees reflecting the possible relationships among
Figure well-supported Blochmannia lineages detected here
Schematic trees reflecting the possible relationships
among the four well-supported Blochmannia lineages
detected here. For four lineages, three possible unrooted
trees exist (A, B, C), each with five possible root positions,
or 15 trees total. The Shimodaira-Hasegawa test indicated
that we cannot distinguish among the three possible
unrooted or 15 possible rooted topologies (see text and
Tables 3, 4).
we PCR-amplified a 1.3-kb region of cytochrome oxidase
I and II (COI/II). Nearly all samples gave a visible COI/II
product. These PCR products generally were not
sequenced for this study, but rather served as an indicator
of high-quality DNA.
We used primers designed to match Blochmannia 16S
rDNA to screen for this endosymbiont across ant specimens. These specific primers (Bloch16S-462F 5-AAACCCTGATGCAGCTATACCGTGTGTG-3', and Bloch16S1299R 5'-CCATTGTAGCACGTTTGTAGCCCTACTCA-3')
produce a PCR product of ~840 bp [31]. 16S rDNA PCR
reactions were repeated in large-scale (50 uL) format and
the products purified (Promega Wizard PCR purification
kit). PCR products were sequenced directly in both directions on an ABI 3730×l automated sequencer using Big
Dye v3.0 (Applied Biosystems). This approach gave high

quality DNA sequences for nearly all samples. All
sequences were assembled and edited using PHRED,
PHRAP and CONSED. DNA assemblies were checked by
eye and any ambiguous base calls were re-sequenced or
changed to N. Most sequences obtained were ~750-800
bp, slightly shorter than the PCR product itself.
Three isolates required the use of alternative primer pairs
and/or cloning, in order to obtain high quality data. These
few exceptions are noted in the footnote in Table 1 and
detailed here. First, for Opisthopsis PG01, the PCR product
generated from Blochmannia-specific primers was cloned
(Invitrogen TOPO TA kit). Six clones were selected for
sequencing with M13F and M13R primers and showed
considerable variation. Two sequences had a highest
BLASTn hits to known Blochmannia isolates, and were
included in the phylogenetic analyses presented here; the
remaining four sequences showed closest BLASTn hits to
bacteria from soils. While the latter four sequences might
represent meaningful bacterial associates, we favor the
conservative interpretation that they reflect environmental contaminants. Notably, we found significant variation
between the two Blochmannia clones. Because two
Opisthopsis PG01 individuals were pooled for the gDNA
preparation (one worker and one pupa), it is possible that
this reflects standing genetic variation between host individuals, a subject for future investigation.
Two samples (Notostigma carazzii 226 and Opisthopsis haddoni 244) did not give detectable PCR products with the
Blochmannia-specific primers. For Notostigma carazzii 226,
we used the eubacterial 16S primers SL and SR [31] to
amplify a 1,202 bp fragment that was subsequently
cloned and sequenced with M13F and M13R primers.
Among the eight clones sequenced, only minor variation
was observed, likely reflecting cloning artifacts. The single
sequence used in our phylogenetic analyses was selected
for its length and high quality. Finally, for Opisthopsis haddoni 244, we generated two overlapping PCR products
using the primers 16S_10F (5'-AGTTTGATCATGGCTCAGATTG-3') + 23S_480R (5'-CACGGTACTGGTTCACTATCGGTC-3'),
and
16S_777F
(5'AGCAAACAGGATTAGATACCC-3') + SR; these were
sequenced directly to generate a 1,432-bp fragment.
Among the bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from Camponotini, all matched known Blochmannia, based on database comparisons and/or phylogeny reconstructions (see
Results). Only three specimens, Camponotus latangulus
236, Campontous sp. 241, and Camponotus dimorphus 234,
failed to work in our molecular screen. These isolates did
not generate PCR for host COI/II, our positive control for
DNA quality. In addition, a C. vitreus worker that we initially sampled apparently possessed two bacterial associates: Blochmannia, as well as an isolate that matched the

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:292

soil bacterium Chromohalobacter. To test whether the latter
was a persistent bacterial associate or contaminant, we
screened a second C. vitreus worker collected from the
same colony. The second worker (C. vitreus 231ii) possessed only Blochmannia and is included in the phylogenetic analyses here.
Database comparisons
New bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were compared to all
sequences in two comprehensive databases. First, we identified closest matches in the Ribosomal Database Project
(RDP, release 10.5; http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) using the
Sequence Match utility [35]. This allowed us to compare
our new sequences to 671,510 high quality Bacterial SSU
sequences. In addition, we used BLASTn for a more general comparison of our new sequences to all sequences in
Genbank. These searches are based on DNA sequence similarity and provide a very rough prediction of taxonomic
affiliation. The advantage of this approach is the ability to
search numerous 16S rDNA sequences very rapidly. The
disadvantage is that the similarity results are not always
good indicators of phylogenetic relationships. Nonetheless, these broad comparisons helped us to identify the
closest non-Blochmannia outgroups to include in phylogenetic analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis
Taxon selection
Taxa were selected according to the goals of two phylogenetic analyses. (i) Gamma-Proteobacteria analysis. First, we
explored the broad placement of Blochmannia 16S rDNA
sequences, including new sequences obtained here,
within the gamma-Proteobacteria. This analysis (a) tested
whether newly discovered bacterial associates of Camponotini form a monophyletic group that includes known
Blochmannia, (b) identified the closest relative to Blochmannia, and (c) tested whether Plagiolepis and Formica
endosymbionts group with Blochmannia or, alternatively,
represent distinct symbiont acquisitions in ants. The full,
99-taxon dataset for this gamma-Proteobacteria analysis
included representatives of new and published Blochmannia sequences, endosymbionts of other insects, non-endosymbiotic Enterobacteriaceae, and divergent outgroup
taxa. To identify the immediate relatives of Blochmannia,
we included its closest matches in databases such as Genbank, the Ribosomal Database Project [35], and ARB [36].
We deliberately excluded the exceptionally AT-rich primary endosymbionts (e.g., Wigglesworthia, Buchnera, Carsonella) to reduce biases resulting from extreme base
compositions, especially the artefactual grouping of ATrich sequences [56,57]. In addition, initial analyses
showed their phylogenetic positions were unstable across
the tree.

(ii) Blochmannia-focused analysis. Second, we explored relationships among Blochmannia in a targeted analysis of 78
bacterial isolates from Camponotini, including the previously unsampled host genera, Calomyrmex, Echinopla, and
Opisthopsis. We analyzed Blochmannia sequences with and
without sequences of four mealybug endosymbionts that
proved to be the closest outgroups in the gamma-Proteobacteria analysis above.
Sequence alignment
16S rDNA sequences were aligned using SILVA INcremental Aligner, or SINA http://www.arb-silva.de/aligner/[36].
The alignment was examined carefully and any regions
considered ambiguous were excluded from analysis. This
16S rDNA alignment, with ambiguous regions marked, is
provided in nexus format as additional file 5. After excluding ambiguous regions, alignment lengths were 1,510
sites (599 of which were variable) for the gamma-Proteobacteria analysis and 1,547 sites (429 variable) for the Blochmannia-focused analysis. At 700-800 bp, many
Blochmannia sequences were considerably shorter than the
full alignment length and thus included stretches of missing data. However, we chose to analyze a longer region to
retain as much information as possible.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
For both the gamma-Proteobacteria and Blochmanniafocused analyses, datasets were analyzed using Modeltest
3.7 to determine the appropriate model of sequence evolution [58]. Based on the hierarchical likelihood ratio test
(hLRT) results, the most appropriate model for both datasets is the General Time Reversible model with invariant
sites and rate variation among sites (GTR+I+G).

We performed phylogenetic analysis with Bayesian and
maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Bayesian analysis.
Using the parallel version of MrBayes v3.1.2, we implemented a GTR model with unequal base frequencies, portion of invariant sites estimated from the data, rate
variation among sites according to the gamma distribution, and noninformative priors. We simultaneously performed two independent runs, each with four
incrementally heated Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) chains starting from a random tree. Analyses
were run for 10 million generations with trees sampled
every 100 generations. Stationarity of log likelihood (lnL) was confirmed by plotting the -lnL scores versus the
number of generations. Discarding the first 90,000 trees
provided a very conservative 90% burn-in, as -lnL was stationary well before this point. Posterior probabilities were
determined by constructing a 50% majority-rule tree of
the 10,000 trees sampled after the burn-in. To assess
whether Bayesian runs had adequate convergence and
mixing for a given data set, we confirmed that the convergence diagnostic PSRF (pscale reduction factor)

approached or reached one in all cases, indicating convergence of the two independent runs. In addition, we used
Compare and other functions available in AWTY (Are We
There Yet; http://ceb.scs.fsu.edu/awty) to confirm convergence [59].
Maximum likelihood analysis
We performed ML analysis using GARLI Version 0.96
(Beta) https://www.nescent.org/wg_garli/. We used the
default GTR model, in light of Modeltest results supporting a relatively complex model. Base frequencies and the
portion of invariant sites were estimated from the data,
and rates among sites were allowed to vary according to a
discrete gamma distribution (4 categories). The runs were
terminated when no topology with an lnL increase of 0.01
or greater had been found in 20,000 generations. We used
these parameters to find the trees with the highest likelihood score and to perform bootstrap analyses of 100 replications.

We used likelihood tests to compare alternative hypotheses regarding: (i) possible relationships among the four
deep Blochmannia lineages, represented by three unrooted
trees, and (ii) the 15 various attachments of outgroups to
the unrooted Blochmannia trees (three unrooted trees ×
five possible root attachments = 15). We first estimated
the most likely tree (using GARLI as described above)
under the appropriate topological constraints (e.g., the
unrooted trees A-C shown in Figure 3, and the 15 possible
attachments of outgroups to those unrooted trees). We
then compared these ML trees using the ShimodairaHasegawa (SH) test [60] as implemented by PAUP version
4.0b10 for Unix [61]. These SH tests involved optimizing
each data set across the topologies being compared, using
the GTR model described above, then evaluating whether
the -lnL of a given dataset differed significantly between
the "best" versus alternative topologies. The SH test was
performed with all taxa in the Blochmannia-focused analysis.
Ancestral state reconstruction
We used ancestral state reconstruction to infer the history
of endosymbiosis in this group, using the Bayesian majority consensus tree with branch lengths and employing the
maximum likelihood methods provided by Mesquite
v.2.6 [62]. Taxa were coded as either endosymbiotic or
non-endosymbiotic. We employed two different models
of character evolution, the Mk1 model which uses a single
parameter for the rate of change and the AsymmMk
model which uses two parameters and thus allows for a
bias in gains versus losses.

Authors' information
JJW explores the evolution of insect endosymbionts, studying the effects of lifestyle transitions (e.g., from free-living to host-dependent) on bacterial genomes and the
specific roles of symbionts within their insect hosts. SNK
is currently a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies the role of symbiotic associations in the generation and maintenance of tropical
plant diversity. SGB is a Curator of Hymenoptera and
Research Entomologist at the National Museum of Natural History whose research focuses on systematics, molecular evolution, coevolution, and social evolution,
especially in ants and bees. PSW is an ant systematist
whose research is concerned with delimiting species,
inferring phylogenetic relationships, and seeking a better
understanding of ant evolution.
