Abstract
Background: There is an increasing interest to better understand endosymbiont capabilities in
insects both from an ecological point of view and for pest control. Blochmannia floridanus provides
important nutrients for its host, the ant Camponotus, while the bacterium in return is provided with
a niche to proliferate. Blochmannia floridanus proteins and metabolites are difficult to study due to
its endosymbiontic life style; however, its complete genome sequence became recently available.
Results: Improved sequence analysis algorithms, databanks and gene and pathway context
methods allowed us to reveal new information on various enzyme and pathways from the
Blochmannia floridanus genome sequence [EMBL-ID BX248583]. Furthermore, these predictions are
supported and linked to experimental data for instance from structural genomics projects (e.g.
Bfl341, Bfl 499) or available biochemical data on proteins from other species which we show here
to be related. We were able to assign a confirmed or at least a putative molecular function for 21
from 27 previously conserved hypothetical proteins. For 48 proteins of 66 with a previous putative
assignment the function was further clarified. Several of these proteins occur in many
proteobacteria and are found to be conserved even in the compact genome of this endosymbiont.
To extend and re-test predictions and links to experimentally verified protein functions, functional
clusters and interactions were assembled. These included septum initiation and cell division (Bfl165,
Bfl303, Bfl248 et al.); translation; transport; the ubiquinone (Bfl547 et al.), the inositol and nitrogen
pathways.
Conclusion: Taken together, our data allow a better and more complete description of the
pathway capabilities and life style of this typical endosymbiont.

Background
Genome analysis is improved and becomes more meaningful when one considers genome context, pathway con-

text and metabolic reconstruction. A focus on the

Bfl 592 (both proteins should physically interact), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (Bfl255, IolJ-like; this enzyme is also
involved in glycolysis) and predicted myo-inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase (Bfl535; related to the Archaeal fructose-1,6bisphosphatase and related enzymes of inositol monophosphatase family). Bfl601 (triosephosphate isomerase) finishes the pathway converting created dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

other organisms is particularly important in organisms
where there has been characterized mainly the genome
sequence. Examples are obligate intracellular endosymbionts where direct experimental identification of their proteins is very challenging. As a case in point we analyze the
genome sequence from the endosymbiont Blochmannia
floridanus, an obligate intracellular endosymbiont of ants
of the genus Camponotus. Such symbioses between insects
and bacteria are widespread in nature and the endosymbionts are of high importance for their hosts with implications for pest control. Blochmannia floridanus, Buchnera
and Wigglesworthia bacteria provide important nutrients
to their insect host [1] and live in intimate metabolic con-

tact [2-6] with the host as intracellular organisms in specialised cells, bacteriocytes [7-9]. The diet of the ant is not
as specialized as those of aphids and tsetse flies, the hosts
of Buchnera and Wigglesworthia, respectively, implicating
specific metabolic capabilities in Blochmannia [10]. However, endosymbiotic genomes are experiencing a steady
reduction as the intracellular symbionts live in a constant
intracellular environment. The recent genome sequence
of Blochmannia floridanus [11] allowed first insights in its
biochemistry and life style. However, important functions
of the proteins encoded in the genome remained uncertain ("putative") or could not yet be recognized ("hypothetical proteins") and are the focus of this study.

Nitrogen metabolism
Nitrogen metabolism. The identified previously known and newly predicted enzyme activities of Blochmannia are compiled
for the pathway of nitrogen metabolism. They involve the urease complex (Bfl523, Bfl524 and Bfl525; catalyzing the following
reaction: Urea + H2O = CO2 + 2 NH3) and urease activating complex (Bfl521, Bfl522 and Bfl526) and glutamine synthetase
(Bfl618). Further proteins adding to the pathway are the now confirmed ferredoxin (Bfl 480), Bfl 573 (NifU-like protein; previously conserved hypothetical) as well as beta-cystathionase (Bfl067).

The continuous growth of sequence data together with
modern sequence alignment algorithms allow to detect
homologies to well characterized proteins from other species which have been overlooked by previous efforts. Any
pathway in Blochmannia floridanus has to be sufficiently
complete to fulfil its biological function (in particular to
produce a required end product). Furthermore, the full
genome sequence of Blochmannia floridanus is known. All
these factors help in genome-wide sequence comparisons
to identify a missing enzyme activity for a Blochmannia
floridanus pathway. Comparisons of the pathway completeness with other species and biochemical data further
refine such a "pathway alignment" [12]. Two more complete pathways obtained here for Blochmannia floridanus

are shown in the figures (Fig. 1, Fig. 2; colour versions see
Additional files 3 and 4).
Genome context methods are a further independent
method to deduce sequence function [13]. Clearly, genes
which are together in an operon are linked by the common function of the operon. This helps to assign function
to sequences in such operons. Comparing co-occurrence
or common absence of gene sets in different genomes further enhances this: If an unknown gene is always present
with a set of known genes its function is associated with
this set of known genes. Furthermore, we could show that
proteins found in several prokaryotic genomes to be
encoded by neighbouring genes tend to interact with each

other [14]. If in one genome such neighbouring reading
frames are found to be fused, this is an even stronger indication that the encoded proteins interact (as these open
reading frames are even translated into a single protein in
this genome). When many genomes are compared in this
way for the conservation and variation of genes, genome
order and fusion, the method becomes quite powerful
[15]. Thus we used for this type of predictions a recent version of the database STRING which compares more than
100 genomes for these various criteria and includes in
addition experimental and text mining data on proteinprotein interactions.
Combining these different methods allowed a number of
new sequence assignments. Error thresholds and combination criteria are indicated in the Materials and Methods
section.

Results
A total of 631 genes and of these 583protein-coding genes
are present in the Blochmannia genome. According to the
recently published complete genome sequence [11], 26
are conserved hypothetical proteins and in this way their
assignment points to functions occurring in other species,
either other endosymbionts or more general ones.
Another protein encoded in the genome was considered
hypothetical, presumably species specific and of
unknown function but is now found to be present also in
other genomes and to be involved in transcription
(Bfl390, yqeI). Furthermore 66 proteins had only a putative function assignment. These different proteins and
their encoding gene sequences were analyzed using various bioinformatical tools (see Materials and Methods).
Proteins with previous putative function assignments
For the proteins encoded in the complete genome which
were termed „putative", we first checked whether we
could either further confirm or more solidly describe their
function by the additional experimental and bioinformatical data gathered in databases and genomes since the first
annotation. Furthermore we investigated with detailed
sequence analysis these putative proteins whether we
could find more information about their molecular function either by specific motif searches (profiles and motifs
known to be critical for specific protein functions from
experimentally characterized proteins) or by establishing
links (in particular by sequence similarity, domain conservation, clusters of orthologous genes as well as genome
context methods) to experimentally well characterized
protein sequences in other genomes.

Additional file 1 shows that using sequence to sequence
comparisons, an informative assignment with high confidence (e-value below 10-6) on the molecular function
(categorized as "good"; right column in Additional file 1)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/1

of 39 proteins could be made and for 9 proteins there
remained only minor uncertainties on the molecular
function despite the low e-value of their sequence assignment (categorized as "fair"). For 15 proteins there is still
only a putative function assignment possible and for one
protein no ("unknown") prediction is possible. Furthermore, in all the cases categorized as "good" and most of
those categorized as "fair" the function could also be supported by several methods and databases we used (see
Materials and Methods). These allowed to clarify the function of the Blochmannia floridanus sequence and established strong links to experimental well characterized
protein sequences.
The revised cellular and molecular functions of 64 putative proteins are summarized in Additional file 1. Two
pseudo-genes were not included. As an example, Bfl623
protein can now be assigned by sequence similarity to the
rmuC family. Experimentally well characterized proteins
encoded by this family are involved in limiting inversions
(in genetic rearrangements). Furthermore, the sequences
of these proteins show limited homology to myosins and
to some of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins [16].
Pathway additions from the previous putative proteins
Nothing in a genome makes sense if not considered and
validated by its interrelations and context [17]. To validate
our predictions further and to confirm them in the light of
previously recognized functions of encoded proteins, we
considered the genome and metabolic context (see Materials and Methods) of the re-analyzed previously putative
proteins. The following pathways thus emerge for Blochmannia:

Bfl240 (putative MFS family transporter, IolF-like), Bfl063
(ADP-heptose synthase; IolC-like), Bfl593 (acetolactate
synthase II, large subunit; IolD-like; small subunit is
neighbouring Bfl 592, high certainty that both proteins
interact) and Bfl255 (IolJ-like, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
aldolase, this enzyme is also involved in glycolysis) are all
predicted to be involved in the inositol pathway (Figure
1; colour version in Additional file 3). A further component of this pathway and confirmed in this assignment by
the KEGG database is Bfl535 (E.C. number 3.1.1.25)
which would be a putative myo-inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase related to the Archaeal fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
and
related
enzymes
of
inositol
monophosphatase family.
Furthermore, we could assemble the following enzymes
for Vitamin B synthesis: Bfl539 (PdxJ) is involved with
erythronate-4-phosphate dehydrogenase (Bfl497), phosphoserine aminotransferase (Bfl383), threonine synthase
(Bfl113), pyridoxal phosphate biosynthetic protein PdxA

(Bfl127), pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate oxidase (Bfl370).
This addition to the original annotation has also been
confirmed by the KEGG database.
Regarding nitrogen metabolism, we were able to confirm
that the encoded proteins Bfl523, Bfl524 and Bfl525
annotated previously as putative [11] build an urease
complex (catalyzing the following reaction: Urea + H2O =
CO2 + 2 NH3). Furthermore, there are Bfl521, Bfl522 and
Bfl526 to build an accessory complex (Figure 2; colour
version in Additional file 4), which activates the urease
[11]. Moreover, to utilize the produced ammonia for Lglutamine production, glutamine synthetase is present in
Blochmannia (Bfl618). Besides protein synthesis, the
amino-group of glutamine can be used for synthesis of
other amino acids in host and symbiont as well as for aminosugars and nucleotides. However, there is no functional
glutaminase known in the Blochmannia genome. We only
found the conserved region of glutaminases to have low
similarity to Bfl528. Furthermore, there is ferredoxin
(Bfl480). A conserved hypothetical protein (Bfl573) with
a NifU domain is probably involved in nitrogen utilization in nitrogen fixing bacteria and plants. However, we
suggest that in Blochmannia it supplies a redox-activity
(iron-sulfur cluster enzyme, confirmed by several databanks and sequence analysis) involved in nitrogen utilization.
Bfl620 (putative oxidoreductase) is predicted by us to be
involved in the ubiquinone pathway. Potential interaction partners from the genome could be a series of proteins: Bfl628 (a putative methyltransferase), Bfl481
(NADH dehydrogenase I chain N), 4-hydroxybenzoate
octaprenyl transferase (Bfl025), 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (Bfl375), ubiquinone biosynthesis protein (Bfl621), 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxyphenol
hydroxylase (Bfl259), ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis methyltransferase UbiE (Bfl622), putative monooxygenase
(Bfl318),
3-demethylubiquinone-9
3methyltransferase (Bfl477); all these functional associations are not only suggested by interaction analysis applying the STRING software, but are also supported by the
KEGG database comparing different proteobacteria.
The putative methyltransferase Bfl628 is furthermore predicted to be involved in amino acid metabolism (histidine
/
tyrosine
/
tryptophan
metabolism,
aminophosphonate / selenoamino acid metabolism).
Several of the putative proteins we identified to be transporters. These could be confirmed in their main function
(transport), using HMMER searches from the respective
transporter families on the whole proteom (as predicted
from the genome sequence). Nevertheless the suggested
substrate specificity still needs further experimental con-

firmation: Bfl012 (preprotein translocasepreprotein translocase subunit YidC), Bfl024 (inorganic phosphate
transporter), Bfl029 (sodium/hydrogen exchanger protein; nearly identical to E.coli YjcE and conserved in Buchnera), Bfl040 (manganese transport system ATP-binding
protein), Bfl041 (manganese transport system permease
protein), Bfl240 (MFS family transporter), Bfl444 (Membrane protein TerC), Bfl455 (membrane transporter),
Bfl575 (inner membrane protein).
Though there are several transporters, the HMMER
searches confirmed that there is only one channel in the
Blochmannia genome: Bfl073, a membrane protein.
Previously conserved hypothetical proteins
We used sequence, domain and gene context analysis (see
methods) to further elucidate the function of the genome
encoded 26 conserved hypothetical and the one previous
hypothetical protein. Their conservation in several
genomes further supports the functional importance of
these reading frames. Furthermore, we tried to establish
links (in particular by sequence similarity, domain conservation, clusters of orthologous genes as well as genome
context methods) to experimentally better characterized
protein sequences from other genomes. Moreover, for
some predicted proteins, there are links to experimental
data available using homologous structures from structural genomics projects, e.g. for Bfl341 and Bfl499.

The following predicted proteins remained nevertheless
unclear: Bfl064, Bfl258, Bfl310, Bfl377, Bfl419, Bfl460.
However, recent data by Doerks et al. [18] suggest functions for the previously uncharacterized proteins encoded
by the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins
COG2960 and COG2835. Bfl064 protein is similar to the
sequences encoded in the cluster COG2960 which suggests for Bfl064 having a functional participation in protein biosynthesis. Bfl377 is similar to the sequences
encoded in COG2835, and for the proteins encoded by
COG2835 a functional participation in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis is predicted.
For the remaining proteins, sequence comparisons
allowed to assign them to specific protein families. We
relied only on well described protein families described in
high quality protein databases such as the databases COG
[36], Pfam [38] and GO [43]. For some proteins, direct
predictions from sequence analysis were possible such as
prediction of transmembrane helices and specific residues
or protein motifs. Additional file 2 summarizes these different predictions. Proteins encoded by the Blochmannia
genes bfl165, bfl316, bfl341, bfl390, bfl499 and bfl547 were
assigned to specific protein families. These functions, predicted by screening for most similar protein sequences
using the sequence alignment algorithm BLAST [19] and

the non redundant database at the NCBI, could further be
confirmed by predicted functions according to the databases COG and PFAM. Those encoded from the two genes
bfl048 and bfl248 could initially only be assigned to their
functional categories combining these different resources.
Further we have been able to assign putative new functions by additional sequence and domain analysis for the
following eleven previously conserved hypothetical proteins: Bfl043 is probably an organic solvent tolerance protein. Its sequence is similar to the entry COG1934 of the
COG database where no function is assigned. Further
sequence comparisons indicated then that the region 34–
162 is significantly similar (e-value lower then 10-6) to the
OstA protein from E.coli. In E.coli recent experimental data
show [20] that the OstA protein is known as an organic
solvent tolerance protein and so this prediction for Blochmannia was derived. Similarly, Bfl045 should have transcription regulator activity (COG5007, sequence
similarity link to experimentally confirmed BolA-like proteins) and there should be methyltransferase activity for
Bfl052 protein (COG 0313, similarity of Bfl052 to the
putative tetrapyrrole methylase family protein in Y.pestis,
there are experimentally confirmed tetrapyrrole methylase
proteins in this protein family). Sequence analysis finds a
Hes-B like domain in Bfl155 (COG0316, YadR). This may
indicate a potential function in nitrogen metabolism.
Bfl220 may be a dsRNA binding protein (YrdC domain
found, there is similarity to a putative dsRNA-binding
protein in Salmonella typhimurium LT2); a nudix domain
points to a hydrolase activity for Bfl264; the protein
Bfl363 is probably involved in Fe-S metabolism and
export (contains a Fe-S metabolism associated domain),
Bfl367 has electron transporter activity (note a glutaredoxin domain region 18 to 99); Bfl423 is predicted to
contain a Zn-dependent hydrolase (including possibility
to be a glyoxylase); for Bfl442 one can predict an Osialoglycoprotein endopeptidase activity (a similarity to a
glycoprotease family is apparent), and a metalloendopeptidase activity for Bfl451. Interestingly, the last protein contains a transmembrane domain (the region 195 to
449 is similar to outer membrane proteins related to metalloendopeptidases which are implicated in cell envelope
biogenesis).
In a third step, the following proteins were examined in
more detail to suggest specific molecular or cellular functions:
Bfl048 (gene yhcB) of previously unknown function [11]
is a member of a cluster of orthologous genes (the COG
number 3105). Sequence analysis allows the following
predictions on its function: The protein is predicted to
contain a domain with a transmembrane region (residues
2 to 24), three low complexity regions (residues 4–22;

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/1

23–38 and 90–110) and a coiled-coil region (residues 27–
56). More specifically, according to the Pfam database, the
protein sequence can be placed into the DUF1043 family.
The function assignment of the DUF1043 family is not
clear in the Pfam database. However, considering the
transmembrane domain prediction and suggested
STRING predictions (interactions for Q8ZB59, a Yersinia
protein, which is homologous to and finds back Bfl048 in
blast comparisons) both the Yersinia and the Blochmannia
protein are putative membrane proteins. Predicted associations of the Q8ZB59 Yersinia protein further involve a
putative exported protein and an adenylate cyclase. This
putative function assignment for Bfl048 is further supported by interactions known for the corresponding E.coli
proteins. Therefore we suggest here that Bfl048 functions
as a periplasmic membrane protein.
Bfl155 (gene yadR) contains a HesB-like domain including the prosite pattern. Its similarity to known structures
allows a structure prediction applying Swiss-Model (data
not shown).
The exact function of Bfl165 (gene ygbQ) was earlier
described as unknown [11]. We now suggest that Bfl165
protein functions as a septum formation initiator. Clusters of orthologous genes (COG2919) confirm the septum formation initiator function by looking what is
known about the function for orthologous genes of ybgQ
in other genomes. Thus the homology to the Yersinia pestis
protein sequence supports the finding that this is with
high probability a cell division FtsB protein (DivIC)
homolog. Further analysis by sequence comparison finds
an amino-terminal coiled-coil domain according to the
Pfam database. Moreover, a septum formation initiator
domain is predicted for the regions 9 to 99 of the Bfl165
protein by the conserved domain server. We note that in
Blochmannia several further Fts proteins are predicted to
be present ([11] and direct sequence analysis): FtsJ (23S
methyltransferase involved in cell division) and Fts
A,H,K,L,I,Q,W and Z. The pathway for cell division is only
sufficiently complete to allow cell division if also Fts B is
present (at least according to genetic data from E.coli) and
thus this function prediction also closes a gap in an otherwise incomplete pathway in Blochmannia.
For the Bfl220 protein (gene yrdC) the functional assignment is a putative translation factor. The gene encoding
the yeast homolog sua5 was identified as a suppressor of a
translation initiation defect in cytochrome c and is
required for normal growth in yeast. The sequence homology of Bfl220 could be confirmed by sequence similarity
using different algorithms and databanks as well as by the
functional associations predicted for other YrdC proteins.
Moreover, in our structure prediction for Bfl220 (by
homology modelling as there is a known structure tem-

of iron trafficking proteins and YggX is therefore proposed
to play a role in Fe(II) trafficking. In Escherichia coli, YggX
was shown to be under the transcriptional control of the
redox-sensing SoxRS system [23], which is absent in Blochmannia.
Bfl264 (gene ygdP) is a NTP pyrophosphohydrolase confirmed also by data from PFAM and Prosite. Such activities
are found in oxidative damage repair enzymes. No potential interactions could be predicted for the protein. Structural homology allows to predict its structure using the
solution structure of the nudix enzyme diadenosine 5',5"'P1, P4-tetraphosphate hydrolase from Lupinus angustifolius as the modelling template (Protein databank coordinate file 1F3Y).

(template:1OZ9.pdb; hypothetical protein Aq_1354 of
Aquifex aeolicus). The model starts at residue 33, a phenylalanine. The family signature (UPF, residues from 113 to 130
in Bfl316) is indicated in ball-and-stick. Note that in the template 1OZ9 from pdb databank the structure coordinates are
exactly known, however the protein function explained in
results was not previously apparent.

plate, the same gene product from E.coli, YrdC,
brookhaven code 1HRU) the protein features a large concave surface on one side that exhibits a positive electrostatic potential. The authors of the E.coli structure
suggested that the fold plays a role in double-stranded
RNA binding [21].
Bfl248 protein (gene yggX) was also assigned with an
"unknown" function [11]. It was described as a conserved
hypothetical protein and with COG category S (Function
unknown) which is in line with the Pfam and Interpro
(DUF495 family) function assignment. With the growth
of function assignment in the COG database COG2924
yields now the putative function assignment Fe-S cluster
protection protein. Further sequence analysis supports
this. The sequence (Additional file 1) has homology to the
PIRSF029827 family, the Fe(II) trafficking protein YggX.
The protein represented by this family, YggX, serves to
protect Fe-S clusters from oxidative damage [22]. The
effect is two-fold in that the proteins which rely on Fe-S
clusters do not become inactivated, and the release of free
iron and hydrogen peroxide – a DNA damaging agent – is
prevented. These observations are consistent with the
hypothesis that YggX chelates free iron, and recent experiments show that YggX can indeed bind Fe(II) in vitro and
in vivo in Salmonella enterica [22]. Furthermore, YggX has a
positive effect on the action of at least one Fe(II)-responsive protein. The combined actions of YggX is reminiscent

Bfl316 (gene ybeY) was previously classified as functionally unknown (COG0319 and COG Category S; [11]).
Function prediction of a COG with previously unknown
function profits from any experimental evidence for the
function found in orthologous genes in other genomes. In
the time after the original publication [11] of the Blochmannia floridanus genome sequence, it was revealed for the
COG0319 that such genes encode probably a metaldependent hydrolase (COG0319 and hence the COG is
now listed in category R). Independently, from the database ProDom the sequence is predicted to be a metalloenzyme. According to the database Pfam it has the UPF0054
signature with three conserved histidines at the C terminus. In the latter database, all UPF protein family members have unclear function. However, the signature shows
which residues are important in this family, in this case
the three histidines at the C-terminus. Taking the information from COG database, Prodom and Pfam together predicts for Bfl316 already that it is a metalloenzyme, a
hydrolase requiring the metal for catalysis and having
three functional important and conserved histidines at the
C-terminus. In the course of a structural genomics project
on Aquifex aeolicus the A. aeolicus protein orthologous to
Bfl316 was crystallized. Its structure was solved, though its
function was not yet known. This allowed us to obtain
(see Materials and Methods) a homology model for
Bfl316 using this A.aeolicus structure as a template. Its predicted structure is shown in Figure 3 (colour version in
Additional file 5). The RMSD to the template structure
1OZ9 is 2.49 Å. As the analysis above now gives an indication for its putative function, we offer now both structure information and the putative function for this
protein. Furthermore, there is even a prediction possible
for a potential interaction partner of this Blochmannia protein. Gene context analysis using the STRING database
(see Materials & Methods) suggests the functional association of Bfl316 with the PhoH-like protein (Bfl317). We
have to stress that each of these prediction types relies on
independent methods and several databases were inde-

fumarases and structurally similar to the G protein beta
subunit. This allows homology modelling (see Materials
and Methods) of Bfl341. The predicted structure for the
cycloisomerase is a beta-propeller ([24], Figure 4; colour
version in Additional file 6). The RMSD of the Bfl341
homology model to its template structure 1RI6 is 0.25 Å.
However, as the sequence similar YbhE protein from E.coli
has just been confirmed by biochemical experiments to be
phosphogluconolactonase (gene plg) in the pentose phosphate cycle [25], we can conclude with more confidence
that this should be the same activity in Blochmannia.

1RI6 [24] is also evident in the homology model (starting
from residue 1, a Met in Bfl341). Important predicted catalytic residues outline the substrate cleft. These are His 130,
Arg 180, Glu 217 and Arg 281 of Bfl341 corresponding to
His 148, Arg 196, Glu 212, and Arg 274 in the template
structure (four from five conserved residues known for the
family and those checked from N.crassa by mutagenesis to be
important for catalysis in vitro [24]). Kajander et al. [24] did
not know yet the accurate molecular function of the E.coli
structure they solved. However, regarding the high sequence
similarity of Bfl341 (38% identical, 57% similar residues) to
recently characterized E.coli Pgl protein [25], the actual activity of Bfl341 we now predict to be a 6-phosphogluconolactonase.

pendently used. Furthermore, the STRING prediction
does not only look at the operon context of Blochmannia
but makes an estimate and prediction for functional association and interactions comparing well over 100
genomes, most of them prokaryotic.
Bfl341 (gene ybhE) was also annotated with unknown
function [11]. It was originally described as a conserved
hypothetical protein with COG2706 and COG Category R
(General function prediction only). With the growth of
the COG database one can now infer that the protein clusters into the 3-carboxymuconate cyclases and has the new
Category is G (Carbohydrate transport and metabolism).
Such an activity would indicate a 3-Carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (EC 5.5.1.5). Muconate lactonizing enzymes (MLEs) convert cis,cis-muconates to
muconolactones in microbes as part of the beta-ketoadipate pathway; some also dehalogenate muconate derivatives of xenobiotic haloaromatics. There are three different
MLE classes unrelated by evolution, this one belongs to
the bacterial CMLE with sequence similarity to class II

Bfl390 (gene yqeI) was unknown at the time of the
genome annotation. It was declared as a hypothetical protein with COG3710 and COG Category S (Function
unknown). Now we find that it contains a DNA-binding
winged-HTH domain (CadC, it is assigned COG3710 and
COG Category K (Transcription). This could be confirmed
as the protein contains a Trans_Reg_C domain (amino
acids 27–104, according to Pfam, Interpro; this part of the
structure is known in homologues in full atomic detail:
1GXP, 1GXQ, 1ODD are different protein data bank coordinate sets for this). C-terminally (amino acids 149–171)
a transmembrane helix is present. Taken together these
results suggest that this protein may switch on and off
transcription in response to a further signal, which may be
a membrane signal detected by the transmembrane
domain. There is no receiver domain detectable nor are
any two component systems detected as individual components in the Blochmannia genome using HMMER search
with SMART families on the complete genome.
Protein Bfl499 (gene yfcB) was described as a conserved
hypothetical protein. Sequence analysis with searches in
current non redundant sequence databases show now that
it is a predicted rRNA or tRNA methylase. These could be
further confirmed by data from the databanks Interpro
and TIGR. The N-methyltransferase activity, also apparent
by comparative genome analysis could either use DNA or
RNA as a substrate, both is possible for this HemK family
member (N-6 adenine specific DNA methylase or general
S-adenoslmethonine-dependent methyltransferase as in
the close relative E.coli). To further support this we find
that the sequence is an orthologue of the COG2890 group
of genes which have HemK family as functional annotation of the encoded protein. There is a HemK family member with experimentally solved protein structure in
Metanococcus jannaschii. This allowed us to obtain (see
Materials and Methods) a homology model for Bfl499.
The predicted structure is shown in Figure 5 (colour version in Additional file 7). The RMSD to its template structure 1NV8 is 0.59 Å.
Bfl547 protein (gene yfjG) was unknown (category S and
COG2867 family). Now it can be shown to be an oli-

the three dimensional structure is known. This allows to
establish the homology model shown here. Details of the

goketide cyclase and with this function it may be involved
as a lipid transport protein (prediction according to
COG). Pfam confirms that it belongs to Pfam family
PF03654, the Aromatic-Rich Protein Family. This family
may be related to polyketide synthases. The synthesis of
polyketides in Blochmannia shows a more complex lipid
metabolism. In Blochmannia, polyketides can furthermore
be involved supporting the lipid metabolism in the host,
in particular regarding insect hormones.
The phylogenetic distribution of the previously conserved hypothetical proteins is shown in Table 1. Interestingly, there are no Blochmannia specific proteins among
them, even the protein Bfl390 is found in Buchnera and
Wigglesworthia. On the other hand, the conserved hypothetical protein Bfl310 belongs to a wide-spread family
found in many non-proteobacteria. This is also true for
the following proteins with some functional assignment:
Bfl052, Bfl155, Bfl220, Bfl367 and Bfl423.

Predicted functional associations and interactions for the
previously conserved hypothetical proteins
The tool STRING [13,26] allows to predict potential functional associations (including cases with direct physical
interaction) for the new annotated proteins by comparison of conserved gene neighbourhood, gene fusion, common absence or presence as well as homology to proteins
with experimentally characterized interactions in different
bacterial and other genomes. One has to stress that these
are only potential associations, which need further experimental confirmation. However, these predictions have
been shown to be robust [13,26] for the delineated functional clusters, genes associated by a common physiological function, even if an individual interaction turns out to
be wrong in subsequent experiments. Only predicted partners present in the Blochmannia genome are considered in
the following.

No potential interactions were predicted for the genome
encoded proteins Bfl390 and Bfl341.
The periplasmic protein Bfl048 is associated and may
functionally interact with the putative exported proteins
Bfl090 and Bfl279 (the latter with the Pfam
Bac_surface_Arg signature) as supported by predictions
applying the STRING tool [13]. These conserved proteins
are all involved in membrane formation, and may perhaps in this sense also participate in cell division.
The septum initiation formation FtsB-like protein Bfl165
is tentatively functionally associated with the enzyme
Bfl303 (an UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine hydrolase with
metallophos-like regulation and suggested cellular function in membrane glycosilation) as well as with the Nmethyl-transferase activity for DNA and possibly also for
RNA substrates of Bfl499. Furthermore it is functionally
associated with Bfl248 protein, for which a function is difficult to assign (protein family is Pfam DUF495 with
unknown molecular function) and Bfl157, an enolase
(EC 4.2.1.11), most probable a 2-phosphoglycerate dehydratase).
Functional associations predicted from other genomes
suggest also for the Bfl248 protein a functional involvement in the synthesis of complex sugars and nucleotide
synthesis during DNA synthesis and cell wall septum initiation in cell division. The neighbouring gene bfl249
encodes a DNA binding purine specific glycosylase using
an iron-sulphur binding domain. This points to an endonuclase III-like DNA glycosidase and a cellular function as
a DNA repair protein. Further functional associations
using the STRING interaction database suggest a function
in nucleotide metabolism for Bfl248. There are two cellular functions predicted for Bfl248 protein: Bfl248 is predicted to be associated with Bfl311, the DNA polymerase

III delta subunit, the Bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase
of Bfl125, as well as with Bfl368 (Ribonuclease T-activity), the membrane-bound ATP synthase F0 sector subunit
A Bfl002, and the tRNA nucleotidyl-transferase acitivity of
Bfl062.
The Bfl316 gene has been considered essential based on its
presence in distant reduced genomes, such as proteobacteria and Mycoplasma [27]. The encoded metal dependent hydrolase Bfl316 is furthermore predicted to be
functionally associated with Bfl317, a cytoplasmatic protein and predicted ATPase that is induced by phosphate
starvation. Furthermore, as may be expected from the
molecular function of Bfl316, it is predicted to be functionally associated with the magnesium and cobalt efflux
CorC-like transporters Bfl315 and Bfl444. Further less
strong associations are found for ribosomal proteins L9
Bfl087, and L20 (Bfl354) and the RNA polymerase sigma
70 domain Bfl626 (a heat shock protein, RNA polymerase
sigma 32 factor) suggesting a role of the hydrolase in
translation.

Bfl499 protein is predicted to be associated with putative
cytoplasmic protein (hypothetical protein STY3216 with
Pfam DUF710) Bfl258.
Besides the previously identified polyketide cyclase
Bfl405 we identify now Bfl547 as an oligoketide cyclase.
Its trans-acetylation activity is predicted to be associated
with several Blochmannia genes for the ubiquinone pathway (3-demethylubiquinone-9 3-methyltransferase, Ubi
E-like Bfl622; 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase,
UbiA-like Bfl025; the monooxygenases Bfl318 and
Bfl259 (2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol hydroxylase) as well as the succinate dehydrogenase
cytochrome b-556 subunit Bfl327. This may suggest that
Bfl547 trans-acetylates succinyl-CoA or some of the lipids
involved in ubiquinone synthesis. We suggest further that
the protein may be involved in the exchange and transmembrane-transport of metabolites to or from the host.

Discussion
Reannotation of prokaryotic genomes
Our study combines a number of bioinformatics tools for
function predictions of previously not assigned proteins

Page 10 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Microbiology 2006, 6:1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/1

in an endosymbiont genome where currently direct data
on proteins are difficult to obtain. We have to stress that
besides sequence analysis with latest sensitive alignment
algorithms we combine here the latest versions of several
protein family databases, protein motifs, intrinsic features
from the amino acid sequence as well as pathway and
genome context methods. All these methods compare the
unknown reading frame to related sequences, genes or
motifs in proteins where direct experimental information
is available. For Blochmannia these involve primarily various gram negative species. Thus a direct link (by sequence
similarity for example) or indirect link (for example via
another species) to E.coli proteins with experimentally
verified protein function allows reliable protein function
predictions in Blochmannia.

Analysis strategy
In general, we would recommend a re-consideration of
the published genome sequence annotation after 3 to 5
years with a focus on the previously unknown proteins.
Further reannotation steps may then follow after longer
time spans. A methodological routine to re-analyze a
genome sequence of interest starts with sequence comparison and analysis first, querying and collating all major
sequence databases. After this there is a detailed search for
molecular function. This involves protein motif searches
and a study of the intrinsic features of the sequences. For
the proteins which remain badly characterized in their
function, genome and pathway context methods are
important to establish more reliable suggestions for their
function.

Efficiency considerations
The growth in databases has resulted in a wealth of information on validated proteins and protein functions. This
improves function prediction for previously not annotated (not well described) reading frames in proteobacteria. In an earlier study on the intracellular bacterium
Mycoplasma pneumoniae [28], we estimated that five years
after the original publication of the genome we could find
a more accurate prediction for about a third of the reading
frames. We still consider this value to be a good estimate
of the benefits by database growth and algorithm development and demonstrate this here for the Blochmannia
proteins classified as "unknown function" or "putative" in
the original Blochmannia genome publication in 2003
[11]. For 72% of previously putative proteins a more solid
function prediction could be given. This level of function
reassignment would be similar for other genomes. Endosymbionts have the particular challenge that direct experimental data on expressed proteins are difficult to obtain.
Conservation of a large part of their reading frames in
other proteobacteria is partially helpful. On the other
hand, it is well known that the conserved reading frames
in E.coli with unclear function remain a challenge which
can only be coped with by combining the most advanced
techniques of sequence analysis and the additional
knowledge from larger and larger data bases. Our new
analysis profits from the larger database size two years
later. However, this required reanalysis, all comparative
sequence searches for the Blochmannia floridanus proteins
had to be done again. Furthermore, it was important to
collect and collate data from several databases as each
stores other aspects of sequence function (for instance,
protein families are stored in the PFAM database, clusters
of orthologous groups are given in the COG database and
the functional gene onthology classification is found in
the GO database). We had to combine all of these different information sources to obtain the best information on
the analyzed protein sequences.

Blochmannia protein predictions
The study illustrates that additional function assignments
for proteins with previously unknown or only putative
function encoded in the Blochmannia genome is possible
combining the above techniques and ressources. In the
light of the challenges to cultivate Blochmannia or express
Blochmannia proteins in host cells such as E.coli, an analysis applying bioinformatics is an important first step to
further investigate the genome and functional capabilities
of this endosymbiont. Furthermore, we established links
to experimentally well characterized proteins in other
genomes (e.g. E.coli) using genome and metabolic context, the growth of databases, more powerful software and
extensive sequence analysis. These analyses involved
sequence similarities, however we included in addition
also several other methods: Confirmation of the specific
protein motifs and signatures needed for the molecular
function predicted (according to experimental data from
well characterized proteins of the protein family in question); functional predictions from a conserved genome
context exploiting tools such as STRING [13]; the metabolic pathway context and including confirmed other proteins from the pathway to further validate the prediction;
homology to structures available from structural genomics projects.
Implications for metabolism and regulation
Blochmannia could be shown to be more complete in several pathways including ubiquinone synthesis, inositol
and nitrogen metabolism. Furthermore, functional clusters for important cellular functions such as initiation of
septum formation, for cellular regulation and replication
control could be further elucidated.

From the previously 66 putative proteins 48 (72%) could
now be given a clearer functional assignment. This study
combines knowledge from a number of databases as well
as direct sequence analysis and phylogenetic comparisons
including prediction techniques for genome context [13]

Page 11 of 15

and pathway context [29] to establish a more complete
repertoire of the exact molecular and cellular function of
these Blochmannia proteins (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, 2, Additional
file 2).
The same is true for the proteins previously classified as
conserved hypothetical. The exponential growth of data,
notably in bacterial genomes, and further analysis
allowed specific functional prediction in 21 out of 27
cases. The present paper concisely summarizes all these
predictions including pathways and functional associations of protein clusters as a basis for further research and
experimental tests.
Remaining unclear reading frames
Genes encoding proteins with unknown function conserved in several species (conserved hypothetical proteins) are currently a topic of interest, in particular
regarding conserved functions contained in many bacteria, including the small endosymbiont or parasite
genomes. Unfortunately, six of the conserved hypothetical proteins and, after re-examination one of the previous
proteins with putative function assignment, remain
unclear in their function. However, many of the Blochmannia proteins are conserved within proteobacteria (Table
1). This includes all just mentioned functionally unclear
proteins. Among these, Bfl310 is so wide-spread that it
occurs also in non-proteobacteria. The good conservation
in several different genomes is an indicator that they
present important and frequently used cellular functionalities. The putative molecular function assignments given
for eleven previously conserved hypothetical proteins are
confirmed by data from several databases (Additional file
2 and results). The specific molecular and cellular functions suggested for ten further proteins previously considered conserved hypothetical proteins were only made
after extensive sequence analysis including comparative
genomics.

Conclusion
The data provided here by detailed sequence analysis,
links to experimental data on related protein sequences as
well as genome and pathway context extend the described
repertoire of Blochmannia capabilities. This includes
molecular functions for many previously conserved hypothetical or putative proteins, the nitrogen and inositol
metabolism, periplasmic proteins, cell division and DNA,
RNA as well as ubiquinone synthesis including some
structure predictions (Fig. 3, 4, 5, results). The predicted
additional functions for the studied Blochmannia proteins
can now be further tested and analyzed. Furthermore, this
study adds to the comparative characterization of the proteins considered to be the inventory of a "minimal cell"
[27] looking at a compact endosymbiont genome.

Methods
The original genome sequence and annotation [11] was
reanalyzed for all conserved hypothetical or putative protein predictions. Genome context [13,26] and metabolic
context [12,29] was considered and sequences and predicted pathways were extensively compared to available
completely sequenced genomes to better assign and identify the encoded proteins therein. Furthermore, iterative
sequence analysis compared sequences to other organisms and public databases (reviewed in [30]). The statistical expectancy value for reporting hits by chance was
generally set at a conservative threshold of an expected
value E of 10-6.
Specific sequence searches were done by applying
HMMER [31]. Intrinsic sequence feature predictions were
derived from the ExPASy suite of tools [32]. To independently check and test sequence analysis results, we applied
not only other programs with similar function such as
HMM or fasta searches, but also complementary tools and
methods such as domain analysis, phylogenetic analysis,
analysis of context and clusters of orthologous genes.
In addition, we applied the different tools for metabolic
reconstruction and pathway alignment using extensive
sequence analysis protocols as described previously [33].
Amongst other tests, this included verification of found
similarities by reciprocal searches from identified
sequences and determination of the exact region of
sequence similarity. To delineate enzymatic capabilities,
the multi-domain architecture of many proteins was taken
into account: Individual parts of the protein sequence
encode different domains with different functions.
Sequence analysis analyzed these regions separately to
identify these specific functions and the different domains
in the protein. Function assignments were tested and confirmed including sequence searches from the sequence
with experimentally determined function [34]. Significant
links to experimentally determined function were established. Proteins classified with a high confidence (Blast evalue below 10-6) and informative assignment were categorized as "good" (right column; see Additional file 1).
However, if there remained minor uncertainties in the
function, this assignment was categorized as "fair". A protein function was classified as "putative" (15 cases; see
Additional file 1), if its sequence had similarities to well
characterized protein sequences or protein domains with
an e-value less than or equal to 10-3 and there was only a
first indication on the protein function. All other cases
were classified as "unknown".
Phylogenetic analysis was applied to investigate the distribution of identified proteins at different taxonomic levels
(specific for Blochmannia, in Enterobacteriacea, in Proteobacteriae, spread among all bacteria). Further, this helped

Page 12 of 15

to analyze gene duplication events and to better clarify the
substrate specificity of the encoded enzymes.
Further information regarding the sequence and protein
family classification involved comparative genomics,
gene context methods and comparisons of domains and
sequences [35] including iterative searches and multiple
alignments exploiting the following databanks: Clusters
of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) [36], conserved domain server [37] as well as the different protein
family databases PFAM, SMART and Interpro [38].
Duplicated genes were examined further to determine
which of them was the real ortholog in gene sequence
comparisons [39]. Replacement by unrelated sequences
(non-orthologous displacement; [40]) hampers function
identification by sensitive sequence alignment procedures. In such cases, gene neighbourhood and operon
context helped to determine function of reading frames.
Besides this, more elaborate genome context methods
were used.
Genome context methods and searches for functional
associations exploited the STRING database [13,26].
Functional association as well as direct interaction on the
protein level is predicted in the database by looking at the
conservation of genome context in many different species.
A first observation [14] was that reading frames which are
conserved as neighbours in many genomes are a useful
predictor for direct interaction of the encoded proteins.
This was validated by considering proteins known to
interact and the position of their reading frames. This
approach allowed also to predict new interactions [14].
Subsequent studies refined genome context methods and
include now also observation of gene fusion of the reading frames in one or several genomes as an even stronger
predictor of interaction as well as common presence or
common absence of reading frames which are functionally associated or in common pathways [26]. Furthermore, data mining (co-occurrence of genes in articles) and
direct interaction data (yeast two hybrid, large scale taptag screens) were added as functional association indicators in the updated version of the database used for our
predictions [13]. To compare and collate these different
types of predictions, a prediction score is calculated, ranging from 1.0 (certain) to 0.0 (no functional association)
and using Bayesian probabilities [13,26]. Four categories
are distinguished [15]: Highest (0.9) and high confidence
(0.7), medium confidence (0.4) and low confidence
(0.15). Only the high and medium categories were used
for predictions here.
Pathway alignment [12] compared the reading frames
found to be present for a pathway of interest and a specific
organism to the version present in other organisms.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/1

Sequence searches established presence of reading frames
with orthologous function in better experimentally characterized prokaryotics species such as E.coli. These predictions were retested using biochemical data (to test for
enzymes with diverged sequences escaping detection)and calculating metabolic fluxes by elementary mode
analysis (in particular to test whether missing enzyme
activities are compensated by detours or alternative
paths). Thresholds in the pathway alignment for sequence
searches against databases were set at an expected value e
below 10-6 and accepted if passing the other two tests.
Homology modelling
For several of the Blochmannia sequences with previously
unknown function we identified homologous sequences
in other species with a solved three dimensional structure.
For some of these solved structures the function was not
yet known as structures were solved as part of a large scale
structural genomics project in that species (e.g. E.coli,
Aquifex aeolicus). If such homologous sequences with
known three dimensional structure had been identified
by us, then homology models were obtained using the
SWISS-MODEL server [41]. The server selects a template,
creates an alignment and builds a homology models
including energy minimization and WhatCheck [42]
reports. Specifically, the ProModII program was used for
modelling; energy minimization used Gromos96 (parameter set ifp43B1) applying steepest descent with 200 cycles
and conjugate gradient with 300 cycles. The template for
Bfl316 (the full Blochmannia sequence had 153 residues)
was pdb entry 1oz9 (protein 1354 from Aquifex aeolicus,
resolution 1.89 A). The template allowed modelling the
Blochmannia residues 33 till 130 in the homology model
shown. The template for Bfl499 (303 residues) was pdb
entry 1nv8 (transferase HemK from Methanococcus jannaschii, resolution 1.80 A). The template allowed prediction
of the residues 77 till 242 in the homology model. The
template for Bfl341 was pdb entry 1ri6 (putative isomerase from E.coli, resolution 2.00 A). The template and the
homology model obtained covered the whole Bfl341
sequence (338 residues) except the three most N-terminal
residues. The root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) for
each homology model to its template was calculated. All
homology model coordinates are available on request
from the authors.
