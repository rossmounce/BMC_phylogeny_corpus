Background: In animals, steroid hormones regulate gene expression by binding to nuclear
receptors. Plants lack genes for nuclear receptors, yet genetic evidence from Arabidopsis suggests
developmental roles for lipids/sterols analogous to those in animals. In contrast to nuclear
receptors, the lipid/sterol-binding StAR-related lipid transfer (START) protein domains are
conserved, making them candidates for involvement in both animal and plant lipid/sterol signal
transduction.

Results: We surveyed putative START domains from the genomes of Arabidopsis, rice, animals,
protists and bacteria. START domains are more common in plants than in animals and in plants are
primarily found within homeodomain (HD) transcription factors. The largest subfamily of HDSTART proteins is characterized by an HD amino-terminal to a plant-specific leucine zipper with
an internal loop, whereas in a smaller subfamily the HD precedes a classic leucine zipper. The
START domains in plant HD-START proteins are not closely related to those of animals, implying
collateral evolution to accommodate organism-specific lipids/sterols. Using crystal structures of
mammalian START proteins, we show structural conservation of the mammalian
phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PCTP) START domain in plants, consistent with a common
role in lipid transport and metabolism. We also describe putative START-domain proteins from
bacteria and unicellular protists.

Conclusions: The majority of START domains in plants belong to a novel class of putative lipid/
sterol-binding transcription factors, the HD-START family, which is conserved across the plant
kingdom. HD-START proteins are confined to plants, suggesting a mechanism by which lipid/sterol
ligands can directly modulate transcription in plants.

The StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain, named
after the mammalian 30 kDa steroidogenic acute regulatory

(StAR) protein that binds and transfers cholesterol to the
inner mitochondrial membrane [1], is defined as a motif of
around 200 amino acids implicated in lipid/sterol binding

[2]. Ligands have been demonstrated for a small number of
START-domain proteins from animals. The mammalian
StAR and metastatic lymph node 64 (MLN64) proteins both
bind cholesterol [3], the phosphatidylcholine transfer protein
(PCTP) binds phosphatidylcholine [4], and the carotenoidbinding protein (CBP1) from silkworm binds the carotenoid
lutein [5]. In addition, a splicing variant of the human Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (GPBP) called CERT was
recently shown to transport ceramide via its START domain
[6].
The structure of the START domain has been solved by X-ray
crystallography for three mammalian proteins: PCTP [4],
MLN64 [3] and StarD4 [7]. On the basis of the structural
data, START is classified as a member of the helix-grip fold
superfamily, also termed Birch Pollen Allergen v1 (Bet v1)like, which is ubiquitous among cellular organisms [8]. Iyer et
al. [8] used the term 'START superfamily' as synonymous
with the helix-grip fold superfamily. Here we use the nomenclature established in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [9] and
Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) [10] databases,
restricting the use of the acronym 'START' to members of the
family that are distinguished by significant amino-acid
sequence similarity to the mammalian cholesterol-binding
StAR protein. Members of the START family are predicted to
bind lipids or sterols [2,11], whereas other members of the
helix-grip fold superfamily are implicated in interactions with
a wide variety of metabolites and other molecules such as
polyketide antibiotics, RNA or antigens [8].
The presence of START domains in evolutionarily distant
species such as animals and plants suggests a conserved
mechanism for interaction of proteins with lipids/sterols [2].
In mammalian proteins such as StAR or PCTP, the START
domain functions in transport and metabolism of a sterol or
phospholipid, respectively. START domains are also found in
various multidomain proteins implicated in signal transduction [2], suggesting a regulatory role for START-domain proteins involving lipid/sterol binding.
To investigate the evolutionary distribution of the START
domains in plants in comparison to other cellular organisms
and to study their association with other functional domains,
we applied a BLASTP search to identify putative START-containing protein sequences (see Materials and methods). We
focused our study on proteins from the sequenced genomes of
Arabidopsis thaliana (Table 1), rice (Table 2), humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as
Dictyostelium discoideum (Table 3), in addition to sequences
from bacteria and unicellular protists (Table 4). CBP1 from
the silkworm Bombyx mori was also included in our analysis
(Table 3). Figure 1 presents a phylogenetic tree comparing the
START domains from the plant Arabidopsis to those from the
animal, bacterial and protist kingdoms.

Results and discussion
Evolution of START domains in multicellular
organisms
Our findings show that START domain-containing proteins
are amplified in plant genomes (Arabidopsis and rice) relative to animal genomes (Figures 1,2). Arabidopsis and rice
contain 35 and 29 START proteins each, whereas the human
and mouse genomes contain 15 each [11], and C. elegans and
D. melanogaster encode seven and four, respectively. In comparison, bacterial and protist genomes appear to encode a
maximum of two START proteins (see below).
START-domain minimal proteins comprising the START
domain only, as well as START proteins containing additional
sequence of unknown or known function appear to be conserved across plants, animals, bacteria and protists (Tables
1,2,3,4, Figure 1). However, only in plants, animals and multicellular protists (D. discoideum) are START domains found
in association with domains having established functions in
signal transduction or transcriptional control, consistent with
the idea that START evolved as a regulatory domain in multicellular eukaryotes. The cellular slime mold D. discoideum,
which progresses from unicellular to multicellular developmental stages, contains an unusual START-domain protein
[8] which has so far not been found in any other organism:
FbxA/CheaterA (ChtA), an F-Box/WD40 repeat-containing
protein [12,13]. FbxA/ChtA is thought to encode a component
of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in cyclic AMP metabolism and histidine kinase signaling during development [14].
Mutant analysis shows that FbxA/ChtA function is required
to generate the multicellular differentiated stalk fate [12].
Functional domains that were found associated with START
in animals include pleckstrin homology (PH), sterile alpha
motif (SAM), Rho-type GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP),
and 4-hydroxybenzoate thioesterase (4HBT) (Table 3), consistent with a previous report [11]. The RhoGAP-START
configuration is absent from plants, but is conserved across
the animal kingdom from mammals to insects and nematodes. The RhoGAP-START combination in addition to an
amino-terminal SAM domain is apparent only in proteins
from humans, mouse, and rat, indicating that SAM-RhoGAPSTART proteins are specific to mammals. Similarly, the
4HBT-START combination, also referred to as the acyl-CoA
thioesterase subfamily [11], is found exclusively in proteins
from humans, mouse and rat, and therefore seems to have
evolved in the mammalian lineage.
In humans, about half of the START domain-containing proteins (6/15) are multidomain proteins, whereas in Arabidopsis and rice approximately three-quarters (26/35; 22/29) of
START proteins contain an additional domain. The largest
proportion of Arabidopsis and rice multidomain START proteins (21/26; 17/22) contain a homeodomain (HD), while a
smaller group of proteins (4/26; 4/22) contain a PH domain
together with a recently identified domain of unknown

The position of the START domain in proteins larger than
300 amino acids varies between plant, animal and protist
kingdoms. For example, in human proteins, START is always
near the carboxy terminus (1-55 amino acids from the end)
(Table 3). In plant proteins, however, the START domain is
not strictly confined to the carboxy terminus. In both Arabidopsis and rice the START domain can be positioned as much
as approximately 470 amino acids from the carboxy terminus
(HD-ZIP START proteins: Tables 1,2). Moreover, in a subset

function 1336 (DUF1336) motif. In addition, a single STARTDUF1336 protein of about the same size, but lacking strong
sequence similarity to PH at its amino terminus, is present in
both Arabidopsis and rice. It is striking that the sequence of
the START domain correlates with the type of START protein,
an indication that evolutionary speciation through duplication and subsequent sequence evolution of START domains
took place after initial manifestation of novel protein architecture by domain shuffling.

Evolution of the START domain among cellular organisms
Evolution of the START domain among cellular organisms. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the Poisson correction model
and pairwise deletion algorithm (bootstrapped 2,000 replicates). START domains from multicellular eukaryotes are represented as follows: plant proteins
from Arabidopsis are depicted by green lettering. Animal and Dictyostelium proteins are illustrated by white lettering on colored boxes as indicated in the
key. START proteins from unicellular eukaryotic and prokaryotic species are classified according to genus and are shown by black lettering on colored
boxes. Shaded areas indicate proteins that contain additional domains in combination with START: gray, plant-specific; yellow, animal-specific; orange,

information

Screening for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) by BLASTN
was conducted to determine whether the types of START
sequences from Arabidopsis and rice are also present in other
plants (see Materials and methods). The screen detected 185
START domain-encoding sequences from a wide assortment
of plants representing 25 different species. Consistent with

interactions

our findings in Arabidopsis and rice (Tables 1,2), START
domains were found in the plant-specific combinations (HDSTART and PH-START) in both dicot and monocot members
of the angiosperm division. ESTs for HD-START transcription factors were also identified from the gymnosperm Picea
abies (AF328842 and AF172931), as well as from a
representative of the most primitive extant seed plant, the
cycad Cycas rumphii (CB093462). Furthermore, a HDSTART sequence is expressed in the moss Physcomitrella
patens (AB032182). Thus it appears that the HD-START
plant-specific configuration evolved in the earliest plant
ancestor, or alternatively has been retained in the complete
plant lineage.

refereed research

predicted genes in rice (ssp. indica: 53,398 [21]) versus Arabidopsis (~28,000), the number of START domains per
genome appears to be relatively constant: Arabidopsis and
rice contain 35 and 29 START genes, respectively. Thus,
START-domain genes belong to the subset of Arabidopsis
genes (estimated at two-thirds) that are present in rice [21].
However, one intriguing exception is the apparent absence of
rice proteins orthologous to two unusual Arabidopsis START
proteins (At4g26920 and At5g07260), which share sequence
similarity to each other and to members of the HD-ZLZ
START subfamily, but lack HD and zipper-loop-zipper (ZLZ)
domains (Figure 2b; Tables 1,2). Their absence from rice
makes them candidate dicot-specific START proteins.

information

The presence of the START domain in HD transcription factors suggests the possibility of lipid/sterol regulation of gene
transcription for HD-START proteins, as previously hypothesized [2]. One advantage of such a mechanism is that the metabolic state of the cell in terms of lipid/sterol synthesis could
be linked to developmental events such as regulation of transcription during differentiation. Changes in the activity of a
HD-START transcription factor could be controlled via a

interactions

Several HD-ZLZ START genes correspond to striking mutant
phenotypes in Arabidopsis, and for numerous HD-ZLZ
START genes, functions in the development of the epidermis
have been implicated. Proteins of the HD-ZLZ START subfamily share strong sequence similarity to each other along
their entire lengths, including the carboxy-terminal sequence
(approximately 250 amino acids) of unknown function that
follows the START domain. The HD-ZLZ transcription factors ATML1 and PDF2 appear to be functionally redundant:

refereed research

HD-START proteins are implicated in cell
differentiation during plant development

The HD-ZIP START genes characterized thus far are implicated in differentiation of the vasculature. Members of this
subfamily are typically large proteins (more than 830 amino
acids) that display strong sequence similarity to each other
along their entire lengths, including the carboxy-terminal 470
or so residues of unknown function that follow the START
domain. Mutations affecting PHABULOSA (PHB) and
PHAVOLUTA (PHV), which have redundant functions, abolish radial patterning from the vasculature in the developing
shoot, and perturb adaxial/abaxial (upper/lower) axis formation in the leaf [30]. Mutant analysis reveals that REV [31,32],
isolated independently as IFL1 [17,33], is also involved in vascular differentiation. Although a mutant phenotype for A.
thaliana HOMEOBOX-8 (ATHB-8) is not reported, its
expression is restricted to provascular cells [34] and promotes differentiation in vascular meristems [35].

Despite these differences, it is likely that both types of HDSTART transcription factors originated from a common
ancestral gene. They share a common structural organization
in their amino-terminal HD, leucine zipper (ZLZ or ZIP) and
START domains (Figure 2a). Moreover, the carboxy terminus
of HD-ZLZ START proteins (approximately 250 amino acids)
shares sequence similarity with the first 250 amino acids of
the approximately 470 amino acids at the carboxy terminus of
HD-ZIP START proteins. This is exemplified by a comparison
between the carboxy-terminal sequences of ATML1 (HD-ZLZ
START) and REV (HD-ZIP START), which are 20% identical
and 39% similar.

deposited research

The other HD-START proteins (5/21 in Arabidopsis; 5/17 in
rice) contain a classic leucine zipper DNA-binding motif
fused to the end of the HD, designated here as ZIP (Figure
3b). This leucine zipper shows strong sequence similarity to
the basic region leucine zipper domains (bZIP and BRLZ)
[25,26], which have overlapping consensus sequences and
are found in all eukaryotic organisms.

reports

Most HD-START proteins (16/21 in Arabidopsis; 12/17 in
rice) contain a leucine zipper with an internal loop (defined
here as zipper-loop-zipper, ZLZ; also termed 'truncated
leucine zipper motif' [23]) immediately following a conserved
HD domain (Figure 3a). The ZLZ motif appears to be less conserved than the classic basic region leucine zipper and seems
to be plant specific. It was shown to be functionally equivalent
to the HalZ leucine zipper domain for dimerization in an in
vitro DNA binding assay [24].

double-mutant analysis shows that the corresponding genes
are required for epidermal differentiation during embryogenesis [20]. The rice HD-ZLZ START protein RICE OUTERMOST CELL-SPECIFIC GENE1 (ROC1) seems to have an
analogous function to ATML1 in that its expression is
restricted to the outermost epidermal layer from the earliest
stages in embryogenesis [27]. Another HD-ZLZ gene from
rice, Oryza sativa TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (OSTF1),
appears to be developmentally regulated during early embryogenesis and is also expressed preferentially in the epidermis
[23]. Mutations in Arabidopsis ANTHOCYANINLESS2
(ANL2) affect anthocyanin accumulation and the cellular
organization in the root, indicating a role in subepidermal cell
identity [28]. The GL2 gene is expressed in specialized epidermal cells and mutant analysis reveals its function in trichome and non-root hair cell fate determination [24,29]. GL2
functions as a negative regulator of the phosopholipid signaling in the root [18], raising the possibility that the activity of
GL2 itself is regulated through a feedback mechanism of
phospholipid signaling through its START domain.

Figure 3
Two different types of leucine zippers are associated with the homeodomain (HD) in START proteins from plants
Two different types of leucine zippers are associated with the homeodomain (HD) in START proteins from plants. (a) Alignment of a region from 16
Arabidopsis proteins illustrating the carboxy-terminal end of the HD adjacent to a ZLZ motif. The leucine zipper region contains three repeats, separated
by a loop of around 10-20 amino acids, and followed by another three repeats. Consistent with the hypothesis of α helix formation, no helix-disrupting
proline or glycine residues are present in these heptad repeats. The loop region is partially conserved and contains a pair of invariant cysteine residues
(CXXC) (gray shading) with a propensity for disulfide linkage predicted to stabilize the structure. (b) Alignment of the basic region leucine zipper (BRLZ)
(SMART) and basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) (Pfam), against a similar region in five Arabidopsis proteins. The leucine zipper region contains five repeats
preceded by a basic region and the tail end of the HD. The leucines (yellow) and 'a' and 'd' positions of the leucine zippers are marked in both alignments.

lipid/sterol-binding induced conformational change. For
instance, a protein-lipid/sterol interaction involving the
START domain may regulate the activity of the transcription
factor directly by affecting its DNA-binding affinity or interaction with accessory proteins at the promoter. Alternatively,
or in addition, protein-lipid/sterol binding may positively or
negatively affect transport or sequestration of the transcription factor to the nucleus.

PH-START proteins differ in plants and animals
A subset of animal and plant START proteins contain an
amino-terminal PH domain, which is found in a wide variety
of eukaryotic proteins implicated in signaling. PH domains
are characterized by their ability to bind phosphoinositides,
thereby influencing membrane and/or protein interactions
[36]. In some cases, phosphoinositide interactions alone may
not be sufficient for membrane association, but may require
cooperation with other cis-acting anchoring motifs, such as
the START domain, to drive membrane attachment.

the sequences of the PH-START proteins are not conserved
between kingdoms (Figure 1; data not shown). In plants, the
START domain is adjacent to the PH domain, whereas in animals the PH and START domains are separated by two
serine-rich domains [11]. The PH-START protein from
humans, GPBP, has serine/threonine kinase activity and
Goodpasture (GP) antigen binding affinity, two functions that
involve the serine-rich domains. In contrast, the plant PHSTART proteins contain a plant-specific carboxy-terminal
domain (of around 230 amino acids) of unknown function,
DUF1336 (Protein families database (Pfam)) [37]. In addition, amino-terminal sequence analysis (TargetP; see Materials and methods) predicts that three PH-START proteins
from Arabidopsis (At3g54800, At4g19040 and At5g45560)
and two PH-START proteins from rice (BAD07818 and
BAC22213) localize to mitochondria. This suggests a common
lipid/sterol-regulated function of these proteins that is
related to their subcellular localization.

Membrane localization of START-domain proteins
Although both plant and animal genomes encode START
domains in association with an amino-terminal PH domain,

Transmembrane segments may act to tether START-domain
proteins to intracellular membranes. One START protein,

Homology modeling was used to generate three-dimensional
structures of the 10 PCTP-like START domains from Arabidopsis and rice, incorporating templates from PCTP and two
other mammalian START domain structures (MLN64 [3] and
StarD4 [7]). The models proved most accurate for the
At3g13062 and ID215312 START domains from Arabidopsis
and rice, respectively. Figure 4c-f depicts the model of the
212-amino-acid START domain from At3g13062. Overall, the
PCTP and At3g13062 START domain sequences are 24%
identical and 45% similar.

interactions

The backbone of the At3g13062 START domain overlaps with
the crystal structure of PCTP START [4]. The model exhibits
α helices at the amino and carboxy termini separated by nine
β strands and two shorter α helices (Figure 4c). The curved β
sheets form a deep pocket with the carboxy-terminal α helix
(α4) acting as a lid, resulting in an internal hydrophobic cavity (Figures 4e-g). The amino-terminal α helix (α1), which is
in a region of the START domain that is least conserved, is
peripheral to the hydrophobic cavity, and is not predicted to
contact the ligand. Lipid entry or egress would require a
major conformational change, most likely opening or unfolding of the carboxy-terminal α helix lid. In the case of PCTP,
the α4 helix has been implicated in membrane binding and
phosphatidylcholine extraction [41]. The overall conformation is distinct from other hydrophobic cavity lipid-binding
proteins, such as the intracellular sterol carrier protein 2
(SCP2) [42] from animals, and the orthologous nonspecific
lipid-transfer protein from plants [43]. It is not clear how specific START is for its particular ligand, as the START domain

refereed research

Although most START domains appear to have diverged in
the evolution of plants and animals, one notable exception is
the preservation of PCTP-like sequences (Figures 1,4a). The
major function of mammalian PCTP, a START-domain minimal protein, is to replenish the plasma membrane with phosphatidylcholine and to allow its efflux. Mammalian PCTP

To identify plant START domains that are most similar to
mammalian PCTP, we constructed a phylogeny with PCTP
against the complete set of 64 START domains from Arabidopsis and rice. Figure 4a shows the branch from this phylogeny grouping mammalian PCTP with START domains from
10 plant proteins. Unlike PCTP, a protein of 214 amino acids,
the plant PCTP-like proteins are larger (around 400 amino
acids) and contain divergent amino-terminal and carboxyterminal sequences in addition to the START domain. Most
(8/10) of these proteins are predicted to encode an aminoterminal transmembrane segment while a subset (3/8) also
encode a putative carboxy-terminal transmembrane segment
(Tables 1,2). A sequence alignment of PCTP against the
START domains from these 10 PCTP-like proteins is illustrated in Figure 4b. Among 27 amino-acid residues in PCTP
that contact the phosphatidylcholine ligand [4] (Figure 4b),
63% (17/27) are similar to residues in one or more of the plant
proteins.

deposited research

binds phosphatidylcholine and its crystal structure in the
ligand-bound form has recently been solved [4]. Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in animals and
plants. It is a key building block of membrane bilayers, comprising a high proportion of the outer leaflet of the plasma
membrane.

Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, carotenoid and ceramide
are examples of lipids that are known to bind START domains
from animals [3-6]. We explored the potential for predicting
lipid/sterol ligands for plant-specific START domains by
aligning plant START domains with related animal START
domains having defined ligands. However, the mammalian
MLN64 and StAR START domains, which have been shown
to bind cholesterol, do not share convincing sequence conservation with any particular subfamily of Arabidopsis or rice
START domains. Similarly, the START domains of CBP1,
which binds the carotenoid lutein, and CERT, which binds
ceramide, both show insufficient amino-acid conservation
when compared in alignment to the most closely related Arabidopsis proteins. Knowledge of the precise ligand contacts
within the cavity of these START domains is required to make
more accurate predictions about their specific binding
properties.

Schrick et al. R41.11

reports

MLN64 from humans, is anchored to late endosomes via four
putative transmembrane segments that are required for its
localization [38,39]. The carboxy-terminal START domain of
MLN64 faces the outside of this compartment, consistent
with a role in cholesterol trafficking to a cytoplasmic acceptor
[38]. Using sequence scanning and alignments with MLN64,
putative transmembrane segments in the MLN64-related
proteins from D. melanogaster (CG3522/Start1) [40] and C.
elegans (3F991) are predicted (Table 3). No other START
proteins from animals are predicted to contain transmembrane segments. A single putative amino-terminal transmembrane segment is predicted for one bacterial START
protein (Xanthomonas axonopodis XAC0537), while one
START protein from the unicellular protist Cryptosporidium
parvum (1Mx.08) contains seven putative transmembrane
segments amino-terminal to the START domain (Table 4).
Transmembrane segments are also predicted for several Arabidopsis and rice START proteins (Tables 1,2). Among Arabidopsis START-domain proteins, four (At1g55960,
At1g64720, At3g13062, and At3g23080) are predicted to
encode a single transmembrane segment at the amino-terminal end of the protein. Two START proteins of very similar
sequence (At4g14500 and At5g54170) contain two putative
transmembrane segments, one at the amino terminus of the
protein and the second very close to the carboxy terminus.
This feature is also found in one rice protein (ID215312), and
appears to be plant specific. Possible functions of these putative transmembrane proteins include lipid/sterol transport to
and from membrane-bound organelles and/or maintenance
of membrane integrity.

PCTP-like START domains are conserved in Arabidopsis and rice. (a) Branch of a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree that was constructed assuming the
Poisson correction model and a complete deletion algorithm (bootstrapped 2,000 replicates). Six START domains from Arabidopsis (green lettering), and
four from rice (white lettering in green boxes) are similar to human PCTP (white lettering in red box). (b) Alignment of the 10 PCTP-like START domains
from Arabidopsis and rice against the START domain of human PCTP (highlighted in red). Yellow highlighting indicates PCTP residues contacting the sn-1 or
sn-2 acyl chains or the glycerol-3-phosphorylcholine headgroup of phosphatidylcholine in any of the three crystallized structures of PCTP (PDB ID: 1LN1,
1LN2, 1LN3) [4], and also points to plant residues that are predicted to be involved in contact with bound ligand. Additional amino acids that are similarly
conserved in PCTP and plant PCTP-like START domains are indicated by gray shading. (c-f) RIBBONS drawing of the START domain from Arabidopsis
protein At3g13062 generated by homology modeling. Amino and carboxy termini and secondary structural elements (α helices, red; β sheets, gold) are
indicated. The START domain contains a hydrophobic tunnel that extends the length of the protein with openings at both ends. The backbone of the
structure shown overlaps with the X-ray crystal structure of PCTP [4]. (c) A nine-stranded antiparallel β sheet and two α helices (α2 and α3) form an
interior hydrophobic chamber that can accommodate a single ligand molecule. (d) Top of the hydrophobic tunnel with a clear view of α4, the carboxyterminal α helix comprising the lid. α4 contains a conserved kink at glycine 280. (e) Lateral view showing the basket structure formed by the antiparallel β
sheets β4, β5, and β6 on one end of the hydrophobic cavity while β1, β2, β3, β7, β8, and β9 form the other side. (f) View through the empty START
domain cavity, showing that the amino-terminal α1 helix is not predicted to contact the ligand within the hydrophobic interior.

interactions

PCTP, which specifically binds phosphatidylcholine and
exhibits sequence similarity to six Arabidopsis and four rice
START domains. Using three-dimensional molecular modeling we predict that the plant proteins will bind orthologous
lipids/sterols. Thus our finding provides a rationale for
experimentally testing potential lipid/sterol interactions with
PCTP-like START proteins. The majority of START domains
appear to have evolved divergently in animals and plants.
This is exemplified by RhoGAP START proteins, which are
found in animals but are absent from plants. Strikingly, plant
genomes contain two subfamilies of HD-START proteins that
are not found in animals. Our results illustrate that these
plant-specific START domains are amplified and conserved
in dicot and monocot plant genomes, and that they originated
in an ancient ancestor of the plant lineage. The modular
coupling detected raises the possibility of regulation of signal
transduction by lipids/sterols in plants. Although HD-START
proteins are unique to plants, the presence of the lipid/sterolbinding domain in a transcription factor has a parallel in the
animal kingdom (Figure 5). In animals, steroid-binding transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily control
numerous metabolic and developmental processes. The
structure of a classic nuclear receptor consists of amino-terminal transactivation and zinc-finger DNA-binding domains
and a carboxy-terminal steroid hormone receptor domain of
around 240 amino acids [45]. Steroid nuclear receptors are
complexed with the proteins Hsp90, Hsp70, immunophilins
or cyclophilins in the cytoplasm and upon steroid hormone
binding move into the nucleus to bind specific DNA response
elements for transcriptional control of target genes. The

refereed research

In this study we have explored putative START domains from
plants in comparison to animal, protist and bacterial START
domains. The function of START in binding lipid/sterol ligands has been demonstrated in only a few cases in the context
of mammalian cells. One START domain configuration
appears to be conserved from animals to plants: mammalian

Conclusions

START

reports

START domains appear to be absent from the Archaea. Moreover the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, as well as another fungal species,
Neurospora crassa, lack START domains. Perhaps STARTdomain genes are rarely found in prokaryotes and protists
because their function is not required for normal unicellular
proliferation. Their presence in a number of pathogenic species is consistent with the hypothesis of horizontal acquisition. This raises the possibility that in pathogens the STARTdomain proteins have a role in the interaction with host cells.
For example, pathogens may recognize, transport and utilize
lipids/sterols from the host organism via their START
domains.

START

reviews

Of about 100 bacterial genomes sequenced, only eight species
encode proteins with similarity to START, whereas one-half
(4/8) of unicellular protist genomes thus far sequenced
appear to contain a START domain (Figure 1, Table 4).
Expression data regarding the putative START-encoding
genes from bacteria and unicellular protists is lacking to date.
Most of the bacterial sequences represent START-domain
minimal proteins of less than 245 amino acids. A START gene
from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(PA1579) was previously hypothesized to have arisen by horizontal gene transfer [7,8]. Here we show that similar STARTdomain genes also occur in one other pathogenic Pseudomonas species as well as in two related nonpathogens. The
citrus-tree pathogen X. axonopodis and human pathogen
Vibrio vulnificus also contain START genes. Nonpathogenic
species that contain START genes include the anaerobic
green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum and the anaerobic dehalogenating bacterium Desulfitobacterium hafniense.
Among unicellular protists, the mammalian pathogens C.
parvum, Giardia lamblia, Plasmodium falciparum, and
Plasmodium yoelii yoelii contain START genes. By contrast,
the genome of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii lacks START domains (Shinhan Shiu, personal
communication).

comment

of human StAR has been shown in vitro to have affinity for
both cholesterol and sitosterol [44], the latter being the major
plant sterol. However, modeling of highly similar START
domains based on the crystal structure of PCTP implicates a
similar molecular ligand, and suggests that these proteins
have retained a common function in evolution.

Schrick et al.

presence of HD-START transcription factors in plants leads
us to postulate that these have an analogous role by binding
regulatory lipids/sterols. The next hurdle in elucidating the
role of the START domain in plant signal transduction will be
the identification of in vivo binding partners.

Materials and methods
Searching databases for putative START proteins and
transcribed sequences
Putative START proteins were identified by BLASTP against
databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [46], The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR)
[47], and the Munich Information Center for Protein
Sequences (MIPS) [48]. Putative START proteins from rice
Oryza sativa ssp. indica were identified by BLASTP of
sequences predicted on whole-genome shotgun deposited in
MIPS Oryza sativa database (MOsDB) [49] using STARTdomain proteins from Arabidopsis (GL2, ATML1), rice
(ROC1, AAP54082) and humans (PCTP) as query. STARTdomain proteins were verified using InterPro [50] and NCBI
Conserved Domain (CD)-Search [51,52], using cutoff E-values set to 1e-05. Arabidopsis proteins were checked against
Arabidopsis EST databases using WU-BLAST2 [53] to identify corresponding transcribed sequences. Supporting mRNA
expression data was obtained from the microarray elements
search tool [54] available through The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR). Rice ESTs and cDNAs were identified
using BLASTN at E-values of < 1e-60 (with most sequences
showing an E-value = 0) and other plant ESTs were analyzed
using TBLASTN at an E-value threshold of < 1e-80. Putative
START protein-encoding plant cDNAs were identified from
Sputnik EST database [55] and NCBI using Arabidopsis and
rice START proteins as query. START domains were
identified from the following plant species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Beta vulgaris, Capsicum annum, Cycas rumphii, Glycine max, Gossypium arboretum, Gossypium hirsutum,
Helianthus annuus, Hordeum vulgare, Lactuca sativa, Lotus
japonicus, Lycopersicon esculentum, Malus domesticus,
Medicago sativa, Medicago truncatula, Oryza sativa, Phalaenopsis sp., Physcomitrella patens, Picea abies, Prunus
persica, Solanum tuberosum, Sorghum bicolor, Triticum
aestivum, Zea mays and Zinnia elegans.
Signal peptide and transmembrane analysis of the predicted
START proteins was accomplished with TargetP [56] and
TMHMM [57] using default settings. For the human MLN64
protein, and the MLN64-like proteins from D. melanogaster
(CG3522/Start1) and C. elegans (3F991), sequence alignments were utilized to confirm the number and coordinates of
the transmembrane segments. Experimental data for MLN64
[38] was incorporated to predict the orientation of the transmembrane segments.

Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments
Alignments were made using ClustalW [58] with BLOSUM62
settings. Alignments of START domains were converted into
the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) format in MEGA2.1 [59,60]. For sequences originating from the
same species, alignments were made using PileUp from
Genetics Computer Group (GCG), screening for similarities
and identities manually. After eliminating redundancies,
datasets were realigned with ClustalW and a phylogenetic
tree was derived. Phylogenies containing sequences from different organisms were constructed by the neighbor-joining
method, assuming that sequences from different lineages
evolve at different rates, followed by bootstrapping with
2,000 replicates [60,61]. The Poisson correction was used to
account for multiple substitutions at the same site. Gaps were
handled using complete deletion, assuming that different
amino-acid sequences evolve differently. Alignments were
constructed by GCG's PileUp to examine trends seen in the
phylogenies. For analysis of proteins from different organisms, pairwise deletion was used instead of complete deletion.
Domain alignments and consensus sequences shown in Figures 3 and 4 were constructed using GCG's Pretty [62].

Tertiary structure analysis of START domains
Homology modeling of Arabidopsis and rice PCTP-like proteins was accomplished using the SWISS-MODEL web server
[63,64] and DeepView (Swiss-Pdb Viewer) [65]. PDB templates of structures used for homology modeling were PCTP
(PDB ID 1LN1A), MLN64 (1EM2A), and StarD4 (1JSSA). The
WhatCheck summary reports for the highest likelihood models for Arabidopsis and rice PCTP-like proteins, At3g13062
and ID215312, respectively, were as follows: structure Zscores: 1st generation packing quality: -1.779, -2.132; 2nd
generation packing quality: -4.818, -4.425; Ramachandran
plot appearance: -2.674, -2.393; chi-1/chi-2 rotamer normality: 0.138, 1.450; backbone conformation: -1.861, -1.446; and
root mean square (RMS) Z-scores: bond lengths: 0.785,
0.859; bond angles: 1.389, 1.243; omega angle restraints:
1.007, 0.960; side chain planarity: 2.374, 1.346; improper
dihedral distribution: 1.877, 1.544; inside/outside distribution: 1.324, 1.269. Coordinates and complete WhatCheck
Reports are available on request. Cartoon images of the models were produced in RasMol Version 2.7.2.1.
