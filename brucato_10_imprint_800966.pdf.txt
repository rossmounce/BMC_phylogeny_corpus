Abstract
Background: Retracing the genetic histories of the descendant populations of the Slave Trade (16th-19th centuries)
is particularly challenging due to the diversity of African ethnic groups involved and the different hybridisation
processes with Europeans and Amerindians, which have blurred their original genetic inheritances. The Noir Marron
in French Guiana are the direct descendants of maroons who escaped from Dutch plantations in the current day
Surinam. They represent an original ethnic group with a highly blended culture. Uniparental markers (mtDNA and
NRY) coupled with HTLV-1 sequences (env and LTR) were studied to establish the genetic relationships linking
them to African American and African populations.
Results: All genetic systems presented a high conservation of the African gene pool (African ancestry: mtDNA =
99.3%; NRY = 97.6%; HTLV-1 env = 20/23; HTLV-1 LTR = 6/8). Neither founder effect nor genetic drift was detected
and the genetic diversity is within a range commonly observed in Africa. Higher genetic similarities were observed
with the populations inhabiting the Bight of Benin (from Ivory Coast to Benin). Other ancestries were identified but
they presented an interesting sex-bias. Whilst male origins spread throughout the north of the bight (from Benin
to Senegal), female origins were spread throughout the south (from the Ivory Coast to Angola).
Conclusions: The Noir Marron are unique in having conserved their African genetic ancestry, despite major cultural
exchanges with Amerindians and Europeans through inhabiting the same region for four centuries. Their maroon
identity and the important number of slaves deported in this region have maintained the original African diversity.
All these characteristics permit to identify a major origin located in the former region of the Gold Coast and the
Bight of Benin; regions highly impacted by slavery, from which goes a sex-biased longitudinal gradient of ancestry.

Background
The genetic dispersal that occurred during the Slave
Trade remains complex, due to the large diversity of
populations involved. Modern African American populations show this genetic diversity, inherited from African,
European and Amerindian populations. Nine to ten million Africans were deported to the American colonies
during the 16th-19th centuries. In the Guianese regions
[1], between Brazil and Venezuela, approximately

400,000 slaves arrived to work in the plantations from
1604 to 1815 for mainly Dutch, but also English, French
and Portuguese Jew settlers. Although many of these
slaves were shipped by the Dutch West Indische
Compagnie (WIC, 1620-1674), which controlled several
African trading posts notably in the Bight of Benin, most
of them were sold by independent slavers who traded
along the Atlantic coast of Africa. Historical reports
show widespread origins of the enslaved working force in
Guiana, ranging over the Atlantic African coast from
Senegal to Angola: 12% of the slaves came from Senegambia (present-day Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea),
Sierra Leone and the Windward Coast (present-day

Liberia and a part of the Ivory Coast), 56% from the Gold
Coast (the remaining part of the Ivory Coast and Ghana)
and the Bight of Benin (present-day Togo, Benin and a
part of Nigeria), 5% from the Bight of Biafra (the remaining part of present-day Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial
Guinea and Gabon), and 28% from South West Africa
(present-day Angola) [2]. The slavers took advantage of
this high cultural diversity, by breaking all ethnic and
familial networks and by maintaining a sex-ratio (2/3
men and 1/3 women) to prevent rebellions during the
Middle Passage (the crossing of Atlantic Ocean) and in
the plantations.
Despite these precautions, many slaves managed to
escape from European oppression once on American
soil, a phenomenon known as marooning. In Dutch
Guiana, these maroons took refuge in the equatorial
Amazonian forest, and reconstructed entire communities known as the Noir Marron (or Bushinengué) [3].
These escapes were favoured by conflicts between the
Dutch and French, as was observed during the French
embargo of Dutch Guiana in 1712. They rapidly adapted
themselves to this new environment, to represent a real
threat for the colonial power, forcing the government to
sign peace treaties. Between 1760 and 1809, six Noir
Marron communities were officially recognized: Saramaka, Ndjuka, Aluku, Paramaka, Matawai and Kwinti
[3]. From the beginning of the 19th century to 1986 and
the Surinamese civil war, they were often evicted from
their territories and many of them were forced to take
refuge in French Guiana. Despite these fluctuating conditions of life, the Noir Marron communities have prospered and their culture has asserted itself. Although the
maroon identity is their cornerstone, cultural exchanges
with Europeans and Amerindians have been intense.
Large influences are detectable, for example, in their
languages composed of English, Dutch, Portuguese or
Arawak words, and in the structure of their villages,
which are inherited from Amerindian knowledge.
Today, living in Surinam and French Guiana, 50,000
individuals constitute one of the last known American
maroon society [3], and contribute to the large ethnic
diversity of African American populations.
The complex variety of African American communities
has been well-studied, notably with genetic data revealing
a high diversity among them. These populations can be
highly admixed, as an Afro-Brazilian group from the
State of Saõ Paulo whose origins are at: 26% African, 62%
European and 12% Amerindian [4]. They can have a
balanced admixed profile, as the Brazilian community of
Cameta: 53% African, 24% European and 23% Amerindian [5]. But some of them show a relatively preserved
African ancestry, as the Gullah/Geechee in United States:
96% African and 3% European and 1% Amerindian [6].
Furthermore, these studies have shown that gene-flow

Page 2 of 19

within each group is often sex-biased, adding another
level
of
complexity,
as
in
the
AfroVenezuelian community of Birongo which has a maternal
African inheritance of 100% and a paternal European
ancestry of 93% [5]. Concerning the Noir Marron population, a preliminary anthropological study on the Gm allotypic system showed a high degree of conservation of the
African genetic contribution (95.1%) and very low levels
of European (2.6%) and Amerindian (1.7%) contributions.
This contradicts expectations based on their cultural
exchanges and emphasises the importance of the maroon
identity which has shaped their profile of admixture [7].
Moreover, this seems to constitute an original genetic
characteristic in comparison with other African American populations inhabiting Latin America. Although the
Gm system has a high power of discrimination between
continental populations, it is limited for finer-scale analyses [8]. These original findings have to be confirmed by
more powerful tools. Consequently, three genetic markers have been analysed in the present study, to obtain a
better picture of the genetic structure of the Noir Marron. Uniparental lineages were determined through the
analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nonrecombinant Y chromosome (NRY) haplotypes. Through
the large number of African American and African populations typed for these systems, updated by original data
from the Ivory Coast and Benin, the data available are
informative to identify the ancestry of each haplotype
observed [9,10]. A third particular genetic system, the
HTLV-1 retrovirus, has been explored because of its
interest in human populations [11,12]. Due to its ability
to integrate itself in human genome, its low mutation
rate and its mode of transmission (mainly mother-tochild), it represents a relevant marker for infected groups.
For some genotypes and especially concerning the Long
Terminal Repeat (LTR) region, the phylo-geographical
tree is highly discriminative [12]. This study is the first to
combine these three genetic systems to study an African
American population. In obtaining a better understanding of the genetic structure of the Noir Marron in French
Guiana, the aim of this study is dual: (i) to confirm or not
the highly preserved African gene pool obtained from the
Gm allotypic system, which contradicts the cultural
exchanges between the Noir Marron, Amerindians and
Europeans, and (ii) to retrace the origin of this community by estimating the contribution of the historical African areas of slavery.

Marron populations in French Guiana have been collected previously, during former collaborative studies in
Saint-Laurent du Maroni, Maripasoula and Papaichton
in the Maroni river region [13-16]: 80 Ndjuka, 41 Saramaka, 10 Aluku and 11 Paramaka. Genealogical data has
been collected upon three generations to exclude related
individuals. The locations of these populations are
shown in Figure 1. Informed consent was obtained from
all participants and the study was performed after
authorisation from the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), the Comité Consultatif
de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale (Necker Hospital, Paris), l’Agence Française de
Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits de Santé (AFSSAPS) and
the Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-Ouest et
Outremer III. Because of the sampling heterogeneity
and the non-significant genetic differences observed for
the Gm system among the Noir Marron communities
[7], a Fst test on uniparental markers, using Arlequin
v.3.11 software [17], confirmed their genetic homogeneity (Fst < 0.05, p-value = 0.05, data not shown). Thus,
they are considered as a whole group in this study.
Benin

The Bight of Benin, also known as the “Slave Coast”, was
one of the African areas most impacted by slavery between
the 16th and 19th centuries, since more than 2,340,000
individuals were deported from its coast [2]. Thousands of
people were enslaved each year and sold to European slavers in trading posts, such as in Whydah. A large part of

Page 3 of 19

the wealth of the Dahomey and Oyo kingdoms was based
on this trade [1]. Present-day Benin is composed of more
than forty different ethnic groups, the most numerous
being the Fon. In an aim to enlarge the databases of this
crucial region, our sampling was composed of blood samples from 82 Fon and 68 Beninese, belonging to diverse
ethnic groups subjected to slavery, such as the Yoruba,
Tofin and Goun. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants and the study was authorised by the ethics
committee of the Faculté des Sciences de la Santé at the
Université d’Abomey-Calavi in Benin. The locations of
these populations are shown in Figure 2.
Ivory Coast

This region was extensively used for slaves after the 18th
century. Belonging to the historical areas of the Windward Coast and the Gold Coast, approximately 700,000
Africans living in this region were deported to the
Americas during the Triangular Trade [1]. Today, about
60 ethnic groups constitute the cultural diversity of the
Ivory Coast. Among them, blood samples from 128
Ahizi and 62 Yacouba were collected filling a lack in the
available databases. All samples were obtained with the
informed consent of the participants. The locations of
these two populations are shown on Figure 2.

intermediate region (positions 16401-72) and part of
HVS-II (positions 73-263) of the mtDNA control region
were sequenced following the protocol described previously [18]. A first alignment step with rCRS [19] was
made using BioEdit v.7.0.9.0, to determine a preliminary
haplogroup. Twenty-seven informative Single Nucleotid
Polymorphisms (SNPs) on the coding region (positions

2352, 750, 7851) were typed by minisequencing SNaPshot® (PE, Applied Biosystems). All data were obtained
on an ABI PRISM 3730 sequencer (PE, Applied Biosystems). The final haplogroup assignment was obtained by
the most recent mtDNA phylogeny [10].
Y-Chromosome

NRY were determined by two types of markers. Seventeen Short tandem repeats (STRs) were typed using the
AmpFLSTR Yfiler® kit (PE, Applied Biosystems). Twentyfour Unique Event polymorphisms (UEPs; SRY 10831,

M213, M9, M70, M22, Tat, 92R7, M173, P25, M96,
M35, M78, M81, M123, M34, M17, M18, M73, M37,
M63, M126, M153, M160, SRY 2627) were typed following the protocol published previously [20]. An additional
set of nine UEPs (M33, U174, M191, M75, U209, M2,
P2, M91, M60) has been designed to precise the haplogroup assignment. All data were read on an ABI
PRISM 3730 sequencer and analysed with Genemapper
v.4.0 (PE, Applied Biosystems). The YAP analysis has
been obtained following Hammer and Horai [21]. The
haplogroup assignment follows the most recently
updated NRY phylogeny [9].
HTLV-1

The overall HTLV-I seroprevalence in the Noir Marron
population in French Guiana is about 6% in women and
4% in men [13,22-25]. Determination of HTLV-1 genomic subtype in env and LTR regions, which are used as
markers of the migration of infected populations, was
performed for 23 samples of HTLV-1 infected Noir
Marron individuals representative of the main Noir

Marron communities: Saramaka (n = 6), Ndjuka (n = 6),
Aluku (n = 5) and Paramaka (n = 6) (Genbank accession
number: GU725032-GU725054) and compared with the
corresponding database available in Genbank.
High molecular-weight DNA was extracted from peripheral blood buffy-coats using the QIAamp DNA Blood
Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). All samples
were firstly determined to contain amplifiable DNA
after being amplified by PCR for human b-globin. Five
hundred nanograms, quantified by spectrophotometry,
of each DNA sample was then subjected to two series of
PCR to obtain the complete long terminal repeat (LTR)
(755-bp) and a 522-bp region of the env gene, as previously described [26,27]. To prevent false-positive reactions, all pre- and post-PCR operations were performed
in separate facilities. The complete LTR was obtained
for eight individuals while the 522-bp Env fragment was
obtained for the 23 samples tested. The amplified products of the appropriate size were cloned, sequenced
and phylogenetically analysed as described [28,29].
Data Analyses

All summary statistics for mtDNA and NRY haplotype
variation, Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs tests were calculated
using the ARLEQUIN 3.11 software package [17]. Four
databases were compiled from published studies,
updated with data from the African populations of
Benin and Ivory Coast analysed in the present study.
The African mtDNA database was composed of 170
populations representing 8727 HVS-I and 3500 HVS-II
haplotypes associated with their corresponding haplogroup assignment. The African NRY database was
composed of 145 populations representing 8909 individuals typed for UEP informative for the haplogroup
assignment and 1200 Y-STR profiles. As the Y- SNP
haplogroup information is lacking in some African
regions, it was statistically inferred from the Y-STR
data available, as previously explained [30]. For some
analyses, the African databases were divided into nine
groups according to their historical region of slavery
described by H.S. Klein [1], the genetic coherence and
published genetic studies [2,31]: North Africa (Algeria,
Canary Island, Egypt, Mauritania, Morocco), Windward
Coast, Senegambia and Sierra Leone (Cabo Verde, Guinee-Bissau, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone), Gold Coast
and Bight of Benin (Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast),
Bight of Biafra (Cameroon, Central African Republic,
Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, Niger, Sao
Tome), South West Africa (Angola, Cabinda, Democratic Republic of Congo), South Africa (Botswana,
Malawi, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe), South East
Africa (Mozambique), East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya,
Rwanda, Somalia, Uganda, Sudan, Tanzania), and Pygmies. The mtDNA and NRY databases of African

Page 5 of 19

American and urban hybridised populations were composed of 95 and 90 populations, respectively. Due to
the heterogeneous resolution of haplogroup assignment
among populations, forming a non-relevant database,
only the admixture rates of continental populations
(European, Amerindian and African), given in published studies, have been considered. Despite this bias,
as African ancestry is relatively common in all African
Americans [1,32], their discrimination is mostly due to
differential contribution of non-African gene pools. All
populations considered in the present study are located
on Figure 2 and complete references are available in
Additional file 1.
Haplotype networks were generated for mtDNA haplogroups L2a* and L1c*, and for the NRY haplogroup
E1b1a* via the median-joining algorithm of Network
v.4.5.1.6 http://www.fluxus-engineering.com from the
Noir Marron data and all African and African American
comparable data. To obtain the most parsimonious networks the reticulation permissivity was set to zero. Data
were pre-processed using the star contraction option in
Network v.4.5.1.6 [33]. For the mtDNA data, hypermutable sites were identified by post-processing using the
Steiner (MP) algorithm within Network 4.5.1.6, and
removed from the analysis [34]. Because of the high
level of reticulation in the E1b1a* sample, Y-STR loci
were subdivided into three mutation rate classes based
on observed STR allelic variance and weighted as follows: 4 (low) for DYS391, DYS392; 2 (intermediate) for
DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS19, DYS393, DYS390; or 1
(high) for DYS385a/b [35].
Cross-population comparisons of maternal and paternal lineages based on the frequency of haplogroups or
rates of continental ancestry common to all samples in
the database were performed using ARLEQUIN 3.11
[17]. The significance of Fst values is given for p-values
under a threshold of 0.05. All results obtained for the
comparison between the Noir Marron and each population of the database were graphically plotted on a map
using Surfer v.8.0, using the location of each population
given in the corresponding study. Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA) based on mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplogroup frequencies were performed using
XLstat v.7.5.2. Analyses of molecular variance
(AMOVA) were performed with ARLEQUIN 3.11 [17].
Admixture estimates were calculated by two different
methods. The first, based on haplotypic homology (up
to 99% of homology), was calculated by the percentage
of shared lineages (LS) between the Noir Marron and
each compared group [36]. Haplotype comparisons were
performed from HVS-I mtDNA sequences (1603016360) and NRY core haplotypes (DYS19, DYS389I,
DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393,
DYS385a/b) to obtain the most relevant results from the

Brucato et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:314
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/314

compiled databases. The second estimator, mY, was calculated with the ADMIX2.0 program [37]. Both
mtDNA-based and NRY-based estimates were calculated
from haplogroup frequencies without taking into
account molecular distances between haplogroups. The
parental populations were chosen among the groups
that presented a Fst value, obtained by the AMOVA for
the comparison with the Noir Marron, lower than an
threshold fixed at 0.1.
Concerning HTLV-1 Env and LTR phylogenetic analysis, the phylogenetic trees were generated using the
Neighbor-Joining method performed in the PAUP
v.4.0b10 program using representative HTLV-1
sequences available in Genbank, including four env
sequences and one LTR sequence typed in Noir Marron
individuals of French Guiana [13]. The strains were
aligned with the DAMBE v.4.2.13 program and the final
alignment was submitted to the Modeltest v. 3.6 program to select, according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the best model to apply to phylogenetic
analyses. Confidence levels were estimated with the distance NJBOOT program (1,000 replicates).

Results
mtDNA
Genetic diversity

A total of 78 different mtDNA haplotypes were characterised among the 142 Noir Marron individuals
(GenBank accession number: GU807605 - GU808086;
Additional file 2). Statistics estimating the sequence
diversity were relatively high (H = 0.988 ± 0.003 ; π =
0.019 ± 0.009; θk = 72.859; Table 1) and within the
range found in other African American groups and SubSaharan populations [32,38]. Although the Fu’s test is
not significant (Fs= -23.987 (0.001); Table 1), this diversity is correlated with a significant value obtained for
Tajima’s test, revealing a population expansion (D =
-0.549 (0.357); Table 1). Considering the differences
between the number of individuals in each Noir Marron
community, all results are relatively similar.
All mtDNA haplotypes were phylogenetically identified
following the latest classification [10]. 99.3% of them
belonged to the major African haplogroup L* (Additional file 2). The highest percentages were observed for
L2a* (22.5%) and L1c (19.0%), which are widely present
in Africa [31]. Phylogenetic trees of these sub-haplogroups show no Noir Marron founder haplotype, but
an integration of all haplotypes within the African and
African American diversity (Figure 3). The sub-divisions
L2a1 (14.1%) and L1c1 (12.7%) were found more in
West African populations [31]. This West African link
was also suggested by the presence of L1b (14.1%), L3e2
(7.0%), L3d (3.5%) and L3f1 (3.5%). Other L sub-haplogroups are more widely found in Africa but present

low frequencies in the Noir Marron sample. A unique
European haplogroup was observed through the characterization of U5b1c, which is present in the South of
Europe [39]. With the aim to evaluate the maternal contribution of Africans, Europeans and Amerindians, the
mtDNA admixture ratio was calculated following the
geographical origin of each haplogroup. It revealed an
African contribution of 99.3% and a European contribution of 0.7%, whereas no Amerindian contribution was
detectable.
Population cross-comparisons

The maternal genetic diversity of the Noir Marron was
compared to other American African and African communities using a population pairwise Fst comparison. All
Fst values obtained are plotted graphically on Figure 4.
Among the 95 African American and American urban
groups, only 24 presented low differentiations with the
Noir Marron (Fst < 0.05). The majority inhabit the United States, especially the East Coast [6,40-43]. The
remaining populations are the Garifunas in Belize [44],
some English-speaking Caribbean groups such as St
Kitts, St Vincent and St Lucia [45], Afro-Venezuelians in
Curiepe [5] and the black communities of Porto Alegre,
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil [46,47]. The 71 maternal lineages
of other African American or urban hybridised communities were highly different from the Noir Marron (Fst >
0.25), such as the neighbouring Afro-Brazilian groups,
notably due to their Amerindian ancestry [5,47-51].
Thus, the mtDNA pattern of the Noir Marron is closer to that of Africans than of most African Americans.
This maternal African ancestry showed a low divergence
with 41% of African groups (Fst < 0.05). Many of them
are located in West Africa and South West Africa, such
as Senegal [52], Cabo Verde [53], Sierra Leone [54],
Guinea-Bissau [55], Mali [41], Ivory Coast (present
study), Burkina Faso [56], Benin [57] (present study),
Niger [56], Cameroon [58-63], Chad [59], Gabon [62],
Equatorial Guinea [64], Angola [65] and Cabinda [66].
However, inside this large area, three clusters of high
genetic divergence from the mtDNA gene pool were
observed identifying the Pygmy communities of Cameroon [61,62], Gabon [62] and Central African Republic
[63,67], the Fang from Equatorial Guinea [68] and the
Mbuti from the Democratic Republic of Congo [69].
High divergences were also present in North African,
East African, South East African and South African
populations, even though some groups have low differences, as one Somalian population [56], one Sudanese
population [70], one Namibian population [63], one
Rwandan group [71] and three Bantu-speaking groups
located in the Democratic Republic of Congo [69],
Uganda [72] and Kenya [56].
A Factorial Correspondence Analysis (FCA) was realised to look at the mitochondrial relationships between

the Noir Marron and 170 African populations (Figure
5). 40.6% of the genetic variance is represented by Factors 1 and 2. The haplogroups M-N-R, L1c and L0a
contribute significantly (contribution>5%) to Axis 1 and
haplogroups L0a and L1c to Axis 2 (contribution>5%).
The Noir Marron are clustered in West African and
South West African populations historically enslaved,
whereas North Africans, South Africans, East Africans
and populations from South East Africa are peripheral
to this group. This result is consistent with the results
of the population pairwise Fst comparison.
An AMOVA based on the clustering of African populations by historical regions of slavery and genetic
coherence showed that 10.4% of the variance lies
between groups, 11.1% among populations within
groups and 78.6% within populations (p values < 0.01;
Additional file 3). Despite this low significance, high
values were found between the Noir Marron and the
East Africans, South Africans, North Africans and

Pygmies (0.13≤Fst≤0.26), whereas they seem to be
genetically closer to populations in the groups “Windward Coast, Senegambia and Sierra Leone”, “Gold Coast
and Bight of Benin”, “Bight of Biafra”, “South West
Africa” and “South East Africa” (Fst≤0.07, Table 2).
Admixture analysis

All mtDNA data of the five African groups presenting
Fst values lower than the chosen threshold (Fst < 0.1)
were used to evaluate the maternal African admixture
percentage of the Noir Marron community (Table 2).
Both estimators, LS and mY rates, identify a major origin in the “Gold Coast and Bight of Benin” (LS = 29%;
mY = 64%). Two other important ancestries are
detected in “South West Africa” (LS = 26%; mY =
23%) and in the “Bight of Biafra” (LS = 19%; mY =
13%). The two last regions present lower probabilities
of ancestry: “Windward Coast, Senegambia and Sierra
Leone” (LS = 13%; mY = 0%) and “South East Africa”
(LS = 14%; mY = 0%).

Y-Chromosome
Genetic diversity

Among the 42 Noir Marron typed for NRY, 36 different
haplotypes were detected (YHRD accession Number
YA003610-YA003615; Additional file 4). The genetic
diversity shows a high-level (H = 0.990 ± 0.008), similar
to that found in other African American groups and
Sub-Saharan populations [73]. All haplotypes were
grouped using the latest NRY phylogeny [9]. 90.5%
belong to the major African haplogroup E1b1* with
notably 88% of the sub-division E1b1a*, which is more
frequent in West Africa [74]. The phylogenetic tree of
this sub-haplogroup shows no Noir Marron founder
haplotype, but an integration of all haplotypes within
the African and African American diversity (Figure 6).
Three occurrences of African haplogroups A and B,
more frequent in South West Africa and South Africa,
especially in Pygmy and Khoisan populations, were

detected [9,75]. One individual was positively typed for
the R1b sub-haplogroup which is as frequent in Europe
as in Cameroon [76,77]. The probable continental paternal ancestry was estimated following the geographical
origin of each haplogroup. It shows an African contribution of 97.6%, a European contribution of 2.4% and no
Amerindian origin.
Population cross-comparisons

As for the maternal lineage, the paternal gene pool of
the Noir Marron was compared to those of other African Americans and Africans (Figure 7). Only three of
the 90 African Americans showed low Fst values (Fst <
0.05): a community from Illinois [78] and Baltimore in
United States [43], and one from Ribeirão Preto in
Brazil [5]. All others presented significant differentiation
from the Noir Marron. Moreover, Fst values exceeded
0.5 in 47 of them, due to their European inheritance, for
example the African Americans of North East Brazil

[5,48,79-81]. The preserved African ancestry of the Noir
Marron paternal lineage leads them to be genetically
closer to African groups.
The NRY gene pool of the Noir Marron showed low
Fst values with only 10% of the African groups; the

Ghana [82], Benin (present study) and in Cameroon

divergence (Fst>0.25). The paternal ancestry of the Noir
Marron is observed to be less widespread than the
maternal ancestry.
A FCA was computed to plot the Noir Marron and
African genetic NRY diversity (Figure 8). A total of
25.4% of the variance is represented on Axis 1 and 2.
The haplogroups G-H-K-R, E1b1b1b, E1b1b1a, E1b1a
and IJ contribute significantly to Axis 1 (contribution>5%) and haplogroups E*, E1b1a, E1b1, CF,
E1b1b1b and E1b1b1 to Axis 2 (contribution>5%). As
observed for mtDNA, the Noir Marron are clustered in
a group composed predominantly of West African and
South West African populations, while other African
populations are peripheral to this group.
The clustering of African populations by historical
regions of slavery showed no genetic significance, due to
the low genetic divergence between West African groups,
as suggested by previous studies on NRY data [76,77]. Ten
percent of the variance lies between groups, 25.7% among
populations within groups, and 64.3% within populations
(p values < 0.01; Additional file 3). However, confirming
the results of the population pairwise Fst comparison, the

lowest values were obtained between the Noir Marron and
“Gold Coast and Bight of Benin”, “Windward Coast, Senegambia and Sierra Leone”, “Bight of Biafra”, “South West
Africa” and “South Africa” (Fst≤0.08; Table 3).
Admixture analysis

All NRY data of the five African groups presenting Fst
values lower than the chosen threshold (Fst < 0.1) were
used to evaluate the paternal African admixture percentage of the Noir Marron community (Table 3). As for
mtDNA analysies, both estimators, LS and mY rates,
identify a major origin in the “Gold Coast and Bight of
Benin” (LS = 28%; mY = 74%). One other non negligible
ancestry is located in “Windward Coast, Senegambia
and Sierra Leone” (LS = 25%; mY = 26%). The remaining regions show lower probabilities of ancestry: “Bight
of Biafra” (LS = 19%; mY = 0%) “South West Africa”
(LS = 13%; mY = 0%).

nor insertion compared with the ATK-1 reference
strain. Comparison of the 23 strains indicated that four
sequences and two pairs were identical. All together, the
23 strains showed a nucleotidic interstrain difference
ranging from 0-1.5% and an amino acid divergence ranging from 0-1.7%. Nevertheless, 17 strains were closely
related with 0-0.8% of nucleotide differences on 522
nucleotides and 0-1.7% at the amino acid level.
In parallel, LTR sequences obtained from eight representative individuals of the four Noir Marron communities: Saramaka (2), Ndjuka (2), Aluku (2) and
Paramaka (2) were analysed and exhibited 0-2.4% divergence at the nucleotide level. Interestingly, six strains
were closely related with only 0-0.7% nucleotidic divergence for the 757-bp LTR fragment.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analyses were performed comparing these
23 new sequences with 70 representatives env gene
sequences available in GenBank of the HTLV-1

Cosmopolitan A subtype, as well as sequences obtained
from individuals originating from Melanesian C subtype,
used as an outgroup (Figure 9). Firstly, all sequences
belonged to the large cosmopolitan subtype and none
were related to other subtypes, especially other African
ones (B or D), which are mainly found in Central Africa
(data not shown). Secondly, among the 23 Noir Marron
HTLV-1 env strains, 17 clustered in the same large
“West Africa” subgroup, clustering strains from Senegal,
Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. Three strains (1602, 2002
and 4702) constitute a cluster related to strains originating from Mali, Burkina-Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal
and Mauritania, while the remaining three (4502, 7202
and 6101) were related to South American strains from
Peru, Surinam and Guyana. Worth noting is that most
of the LTR sequences (6/8) analysed belonged to the
“West Africa” subgroup, while the remaining two clustered in the “Transcontinental” subgroup (Additional
file 5).

Discussion
An original African American population

The African American community is composed of
highly diverse ethnic groups in terms of their historical,
cultural and biological inheritances. Each of them has
their specific identity. Being one of the last known

American maroon community, the Noir Marron are an
important part this diversity [3]. A previous analysis of
the Gm system showed their preserved African gene
pool (>95%), revealing a first insight into their genetic
originality in comparison with other neighbouring African American groups [7]. The present study, exploring

Figure 9 Env phylogenetic tree generated using the Neighbor-Joining method performed in the PAUP program (v4.0b10) on a 519-bp
fragment of the Env gene using 75 HTLV-1 available sequences available in Genbank. The new Noir Marron data are coded in red. The
Noir Marron data already published are coded “NM”. The Mel5 and VAN136 strains were used as out-group. The HTLV-1 strains were aligned
with the DAMBE program (version 4.2.13). The final alignment was submitted to the Modeltest program (version 3.6) to select, according to the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the best model to apply to phylogenetic analyses. The selected model was the GTR. Bootstrap support (1,000
replicates) is noted on the branch of the tree.

three different genetic systems, strengthens this conclusion. Although each parental lineage presents European
and/or Amerindian contribution, the bulk (>95%) of
their genetic diversity is inherited from African

ancestors. Indeed, 99.3% of the mtDNA genetic profile
of the Noir Marron comes from Africa, whereas the
paternal African ancestry increases to 97.6% and the
HTLV-1 strains, probably of African origin, represent 6/

Brucato et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:314

8 for the LTR and 20/23 for the env region. Thus,
despite four centuries in America, neighboured by European settlers and Amerindian ethnic groups with
whom the Noir Marron made cultural exchanges [3],
none or restricted gene flow has influenced their African
genetic identity. This emphasises the role of the maroon
identity in shaping their genetic profile. Although
exchanges were necessary for the survival of the community, the ethnic integrity of the maroon society is
characterised by a struggle against foreign threats, and
above all the struggles of former slavers. Thus, interethnic couples, which effectively exist as between the Aluku
and the Wayana [3], would contradict this cultural rule.
This does not mean that the Noir Marron have been
genetically isolated in the equatorial forest as revealed
by their genetic diversity (H mtDNA = 0.988; H NRY =
0.990). Comparable to the values of African populations,
these values reflect the mass arrival of slaves into the
Guianas over four centuries, an important proportion of
which increased the number of the Noir Marron.
Genetic diversities do not seem to have been impacted
by demographic crises or geographical isolations which
could have occurred during the history of Noir Marron
which was punctuated by many conflicts (D = -0.55
(0.357); Table 1). Although some communities were
briefly reduced to a hundred individuals, as the Aluku
were [3], the constant flow of new maroons balanced
the genetic lost (Figures 3 and 6). Forming sustainable
groups, still increasing in number, their adaptation to
the Guianese context has been facilitated. Their maroon
identity, their adaptation to the Amazonian environment
and the relatively important number of immigrants
explain why the Noir Marron, who today constitute
30,000 individuals in French Guiana, have conserved
their African genetic inheritance.
These characteristics are all the more interesting when
compared with other African American groups. The
composition of the uniparental haplogroups of this
African gene pool is close to observations in other African American populations, notably because of the high
frequencies of L2a (22,5%) and L1c (19%) for the maternal lineage and E1b1a (88%) for the paternal lineage
(Figures 3 and 6), such in African American in the United States (L1c = 11%; L2a = 19%; E1b1a = 62%) or in
Afro-Brazilian in Porto Alegre (L1c = 14%; L2a = 17%;
E1b1a = 44%) [40,46,84]. As most of the slavers traded
along the Atlantic coast of Africa, the average composition of each lineage is similar among the African American group. If this ancestral genetic pool was effectively
common, the evolution of each one has produced highly
divergent patterns. The population pairwise Fst comparisons of both uniparental systems showed that the
majority of African American groups presented significant genetic differences from the Noir Marron

Page 14 of 19

(Fst>0.25; Figures 4 and 7). The discrepancies are mainly
due to European and/or Amerindian contributions,
which are most often sex-biased [85]. This preferential
gene flow is partly due to the importance of European
male migration and an easier acceptance of Amerindian
women in tri-hybridised communities [86]. The African
inheritance of the Noir Marron, consequently not sexbiased, is peculiar in the African American landscape.
Even their neighbouring African American communities
are much more hybridised, as observed in North East
Brazil [5,47,48,50,79-81]. If this characteristic is mainly
shaped by their maroon identity, it is surprising to
notice that other maroon groups present an admixed
and sex-biased genetic profile, such as the Maroons in
Jamaica (African maternal lineage: 87%; African paternal
lineage: 58%) [45]. Even the Curiau quilombo, which
could have originated from the same plantations as the
Noir Marron, present a highly hybridised genetic profile
(African maternal lineage: 54%; African paternal lineage:
37%) [81]. Furthermore, most maroon groups have lost
a part of their genetic diversity after genetic drift due to
their relative isolation, as has occurred in the Garifuña
in Honduras (HmtDNA = 0.897) [87] and in the Angolares in the African island of São Tomé (H mtDNA =
0.919) [88,89]. Thus, the Noir Marron are also genetically original within the maroon populations cluster.
The reason for this difference can be enlightened by
examining the groups presenting similar patterns in
both lineages (Fst < 0.15). They are all located on the
East coast of the United States, such as the Gullah/Geechee in South Carolina [43,78]. Although these groups
never present an estimated African ancestry as high as
in the Noir Marron, they present a low sex-bias. A historical cultural phenomenon can be evoked to link this
common pattern. Although assimilation of Amerindian
and African women was encouraged as a strategy for
the occupation in Portuguese colonies [90], tolerated in
Spanish territories [1], it was not the case in French,
English and Dutch colonies [91,92]. Such cultural traits
have favoured inter-ethnic admixture in the first case
and separated communities in the second. The common
behaviours in these colonies have caused a low level of
sex-biased admixture, bringing the gene pools of the
Noir Marron and the African Americans of the East
coast of the United States closer. The combination of
the maroon identity in the former Dutch colony has
preserved the African genetic diversity of the Noir Marron ancestors.
Retracing the African origin

The exceptional conservation of the African genetic
diversity allows a relevant picture of the genetic inheritance of slaves that were deported to the Guianas to be
determined. If the African inheritance is genetically

Brucato et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:314
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/314

marked by the predominance of L* haplogroup in
maternal lineages, E1b1* in paternal lineages and
HTLV-1 A strains of African origin, the detailed examination of each of these components gives a more precise
location of their ancestries [31,76]. Indeed, a close link
with West African populations, also suggested by the
Gm system analysis [7], is identifiable through the relatively high frequencies of some mtDNA subhaplogroups as L2a1 (22.5%), L1b (14.1%), L3d (3.5%),
L3f1 (3.5%), NRY sub-haplogroups as E1b1a7* (33.3%)
and E1b1a8* (21.4%) [31,76]. Most of the HTLV-1 Noir
Marron strains analysed were clustered with West African strains originating from the Ivory Coast, Ghana,
Senegal and Burkina-Faso (Figure 9). Secondly, genetic
relationships between the Noir Marron and South West
African populations can be distinguished. Although no
HTLV-1 B and D subtypes (Central African genotypes)
were detected among the studied samples, the observed
frequencies of mtDNA sub-haplogroups L1c1 (12.7%)
and L3e2 (7.4%), and the NRY sub-haplogroup B (4.7%)
[9,31,62] sign the link between the Noir Marron and
South West Africa. These two genetic affinities were
confirmed by cross-comparisons between the gene pools
of the Noir Marron and each African population (Figures 4 and 7). The ethnic groups inhabiting West and
South West Africa presented the lowest genetic divergence (Fst < 0.15) compared with other African groups,
at the noticeable exception of the Pygmy communities,
the Fang and some groups from Senegal, Chad and
Niger. North Africans, East Africans and Khoisans
(Fst>0.25) have not contributed to the Noir Marron
gene pool, confirming that the presence of NRY haplogroups A and B are probably of South West African
inheritance. The West and South West African mixedancestry of the Noir Marron is attested by FCA
performed for each lineage, plotting the Noir Marron
diversity inside a cluster of these populations (Figures 5
and 8). As hypothesised, the populations located in the
historical regions of slavery are the most probable Noir
Marron ancestors.
Despite the fact that the relative genetic homogeneity
within these populations make any grouping non-significant, as reported in many studies [41,93], historical data
give a strong significance to the clustering because of
their importance during the Atlantic Slave Trade. All
estimators of ancestry, for both uniparental systems,
state the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin as the
major origin of the Noir Marron’s ancestors (mtDNA:
LS = 0.29; mY = 0.64; NRY: LS = 0.28; mY = 0.74;
Tables 2 and 3). A region also suggested by the phylogenetic analyses of the HTLV-1 strains (Figure 9 and
Additional file 5). These converging results are concordant with historical records showing that this region
was the port of departure of slaves who were deported

Page 15 of 19

to the Guianas [2]. Almost 224,000 individuals, natives
of the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin, were sold as
slaves to work in the Guianese plantations. Their relative importance has largely imprinted the genetic background of the Noir Marron but also their culture. For
example, Akan words are still present in their vocabulary; their pantheon is largely inherited from those present in populations in Ghana; funeral rites are common
with Fanti-Ashanti customs [3]. Thus, the Noir Marron
culture and genes have kept the traces of individuals
coming from the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin, a
region largely impacted by the Atlantic Slave Trade.
As highlighted by historical data, slaves never came
from a unique region and the Noir Marron gene pool
has also kept this characteristic. Indeed, other ancestries
are detected in uniparental systems, in a sex-biased
manner, contradictory to the Gold Coast and the Bight
of Benin origin. The majority of the remaining maternal
ancestry is located in the Bight of Biafra (LS = 0.19; mY
= 0.13; Tables 2) and in South West Africa (LS = 0.28;
mY = 0.23; Tables 2), while the largest part of the
remaining paternal ancestry is located in the region of
the Windward Coast, Senegambia and Sierra Leone (LS
= 0.25; mY = 0.26; Tables 3). Thus, a sex-biased ancestry is detected in the Noir Marron gene pool. From a
major origin in the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin,
a paternal gradient goes north, while a maternal gradient goes south. This divergent geographical gradient of
the uniparental ancestries may be explained by regionalspecific characteristics of trading during the Atlantic
Slave Trade. In the Windward Coast, Senegambia and
Sierra Leone, slave trade was also implied in the TransSaharan Slave Trade [94] in which women were more
sold than men, reducing the number of women sent to
the Americas. Men from these regions were judged by
European settlers to be more robust than Angolans to
work in the plantations, raising the demand of male
slaves in these trading posts, such as in the Gorée
Island. The maternal gradient, more surprisingly, may
be the consequence of these practices. The rising price
of male slaves from the Windward Coast, Senegambia
and Sierra Leone would have forced the slavers to balance the cost of buying slaves in the south, where slave
markets were created for the Atlantic Slave Trade, without competition from the Arab traders. Thus, in the
Bight of Biafra and South West Africa, slavers could
have bought more women to maintain a sex-ratio close
to 2/3 men and 1/3 women [1].

Conclusions
Belonging to the wide African American cultural area,
the Noir Marron in French Guiana is unique due to
their African gene pool. Despite four centuries neighboured by Europeans and Amerindians with whom

Brucato et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:314
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/314

intense cultural exchanges were made, their maroon
identity has limited gene flow. The conservation of the
African diversity in each genetic system studied revealed
a probable non-altered inheritance from their slave
ancestors. A major origin was located on the Gold
Coast and in the Bight of Benin; regions highly impacted
by slavery. From this region, uniparental genetic markers
showed a sex-biased origin, with the remaining male
ancestry located from Senegal to Benin, and the remaining female ancestry from the Ivory Coast to Angola. Different historical and cultural traits of the Slave Trade
have created a differential migration of the female and
male enslaved ancestors of the Noir Marron. Thus, this
sex-biased African ancestry is still genetically imprinted
in the Noir Marron gene pool, a characteristic that
deserves to be examined in other African American
groups, such as the Creoles, in order to gain a relevant
picture of the dynamics of the African gene flow that
occurred during the Slave Trade.

Additional material
Additional file 1: References of the populations compiled in the
databases used for the comparisons to Noir Marron data.
Additional file 2: MtDNA haplotypes and their respective
haplogroup classification found in Noir Marron, Beninese, Yacouba
and Ahizi sampling.
Additional file 3: AMOVA analyses performed with mtDNA and NRY
data to compare the Noir Marron gene pool with the ones of the
databases.
Additional file 4: NRY haplotypes and their respective haplogroup
classification found in Noir Marron, Beninese, Yacouba and Ahizi
sampling.
Additional file 5: LTR phylogenetic tree constructed by the
neighbour-joining method of HTLV-1 strains in 8 Noir Marron (in
red) and HTLV-1 sequences of the database. The Noir Marron data
already published are coded “NM”. The H24 strain was used as outgroup. The HTLV-1 strains were aligned with the DAMBE program
(version 4.2.13). The final alignment was submitted to the Modeltest
program (version 3.6) to select, according to the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), the best model to apply to phylogenetic analyses. The
selected model was the GTR. Bootstrap support (1,000 replicates) is
noted on the branch of the tree.
