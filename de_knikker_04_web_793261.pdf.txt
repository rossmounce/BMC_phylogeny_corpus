Abstract
Background: Very often genome-wide data analysis requires the interoperation of multiple databases and
analytic tools. A large number of genome databases and bioinformatics applications are available through the web,
but it is difficult to automate interoperation because: 1) the platforms on which the applications run are
heterogeneous, 2) their web interface is not machine-friendly, 3) they use a non-standard format for data input
and output, 4) they do not exploit standards to define application interface and message exchange, and 5) existing
protocols for remote messaging are often not firewall-friendly. To overcome these issues, web services have
emerged as a standard XML-based model for message exchange between heterogeneous applications. Web
services engines have been developed to manage the configuration and execution of a web services workflow.
Results: To demonstrate the benefit of using web services over traditional web interfaces, we compare the two
implementations of HAPI, a gene expression analysis utility developed by the University of California San Diego
(UCSD) that allows visual characterization of groups or clusters of genes based on the biomedical literature. This
utility takes a set of microarray spot IDs as input and outputs a hierarchy of MeSH Keywords that correlates to
the input and is grouped by Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) category. While the HTML output is easy for humans
to visualize, it is difficult for computer applications to interpret semantically. To facilitate the capability of machine
processing, we have created a workflow of three web services that replicates the HAPI functionality. These web
services use document-style messages, which means that messages are encoded in an XML-based format. We
compared three approaches to the implementation of an XML-based workflow: a hard coded Java application,
Collaxa BPEL Server and Taverna Workbench. The Java program functions as a web services engine and
interoperates with these web services using a web services choreography language (BPEL4WS).
Conclusion: While it is relatively straightforward to implement and publish web services, the use of web services
choreography engines is still in its infancy. However, industry-wide support and push for web services standards
is quickly increasing the chance of success in using web services to unify heterogeneous bioinformatics
applications. Due to the immaturity of currently available web services engines, it is still most practical to
implement a simple, ad-hoc XML-based workflow by hard coding the workflow as a Java application. For advanced
web service users the Collaxa BPEL engine facilitates a configuration and management environment that can fully
handle XML-based workflow.

Background
The nature of genome-wide data analysis often requires
the use of multiple databases and programs in some coordinated fashion. For example, microarray data analysis
typically involves a sequence of analysis steps, which may
include filtering, normalization, cluster analysis, access to
a variety of genome annotation sources, etc. To compound the problem of interoperation, there are different
ways of analyzing the same dataset. For example, some
microarray analyses such as clustering are exploratory in
nature while others are more specific to nature of the biological problem at hand (e.g., genetic network modeling
[1]). Also, there are different ways to perform the same
type of analysis (e.g., there are different clustering
approaches such as hierarchical methods vs. non-hierarchical methods).
Despite the fact that a large number of genome databases
and bioinformatics applications have been made available through the web, it is difficult to automate interoperation because:
1) the platforms on which applications reside are
heterogeneous,
2) their web interface is human-friendly but not machinefriendly,
3) they use a non-standard format for input and output
data,
4) they do not make use of standards to define the application interface and message exchange,
5) existing protocols for remote messaging are often not
firewall-friendly.
Web services now offer a single uniform method for application integration through the Internet. They provide a
model for accessing software systems over the web by
pointing to their web address (URI), while their public
interfaces and bindings are defined and described using
an XML standard format. The potential of web services in
bioinformatics database/tool unification has been recognized [2]. Examples of bioinformatics web service projects
include: BioMoby is a project involving biological data
hosts, biological data service providers, and coders whose
aim is to explore various methodologies for biological
data representation, distribution, and discovery [3];
myGrid aims to design, develop and demonstrate higher
level functionalities over an existing Grid infrastructure
that support scientists in making use of complex distributed resources [4,5]; DDBJ has published a number of
biological tools as web services like Blast, ClustalW,
DDBJ, Fasta, and others [6]; Soaplab developed at EBI

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/25

provides a web service interface to a variety of analysis
applications [7]; Soap-HT-BLAST is a BLAST web service
implementation by the Bio Informatics Institute (BII) of
the Agency for Science, Technology and Research in Singapore (A*STAR) [8]; and the IBM Life Sciences project
implemented web services for PubMed, GenBank, BLAST,
Phylogenic Tree and ClustalW [9].
Overview of the web service technology
Three standards have emerged that comprise the web services model. The Basic Profile of the Web Services Interoperability model (WS-I) [10] describes the web services
model as follows:

1) the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) [11] is
an XML language that describes a web service in an
abstract manner by defining the web service interface and
the exchange of messages between the provider and
requester.
2) the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) [12] is an
XML-based protocol for stateless message exchange. It is
not bound to any transport protocol, but is in general
built on top of HTTP, which makes it firewall friendly in
contrast to protocols used by CORBA for instance.
3) Universal Description, Discovery and Integration
(UDDI) [13] is a standard protocol designed to publish
details about an organization and the web services. It provides a description and definition of web services in a central repository, which functions as yellow pages for web
services.
WSDL and SOAP are W3C standards, while UDDI is an
OASIS standard. For a client to use a web service it only
needs WSDL with SOAP being commonly used as the
default protocol. SOAP implementations like Axis by the
Apache Software Foundation, The Mind Electric's (TME)
GLUE or Systinet's WASP Server for Java provide an easyto-use method for publication and management of web
services. These tools in general manage message exchange,
register web services, generate WSDL files and implement
functions like automatic error handling.
Web Services Choreography
While interlinking between web services is relatively simple, in reality applications need to work together in order
to offer more advanced functionality. Thus to make full
use of the advantages that the web services model offers,
like advanced automation and application integration to
group a set of applications together, we need more than a
simple point-to-point connection. That is, we need a language that allows us to create a more complex composition of interdependent web services that easily operate
together. This concept of interrelated web services that are

Page 2 of 11

BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5

linked together in a functionally coherent and repeatable
process is called "Web Services Choreography".
There are more than a dozen languages that coordinate
messaging and transaction for web services available but
currently there are mainly two dominant open standards:
1) the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) [14] was co-written by IBM, MicroSoft
and BEA, and is (royalty-free) submitted as a standard to
OASIS. SUN Microsystems and Oracle recently joined the
WS-BPEL Technical Committee [15],
2) the Business Process Markup Language (BPML) [16] is
defined by BPML.org and extends the Web Services Choreography Interface (WSCI) that was developed by SUN.
The W3C published in August 2003 a draft of its specification for Web Services Choreography language (WSCHOR) [17]. BPEL4WS and BPML are the leading emerging standards. They are compatible languages and both
offer a rich set of workflow options. BPEL4WS seems
most promising at this moment to emerge as a widely supported standard for web services choreography since it has
the broad industry support from companies like IBM,
MicroSoft and BEA, while SUN recently also joined the
Technical Committee. In addition, BPEL4WS is well documented and tools like editors and choreography engines
are already available. Both BPEL4WS and BPML allow
complex scenarios of choreography like concurrent processes, synchronous and asynchronous messaging, roll
back mechanisms, data manipulation and error handling.
These features benefit certain classes of biomedical informatics applications that involve sensitive data and the use
of parallel programming to speed the complex analyses of
large datasets.
Choreography engines
A choreography engine is the "smart center" of a web services choreography, which executes and manages workflow, process automation, data mapping, error handling
and security. These engines significantly improve the
management of the web services workflow. Currently
there are a few web services choreography engines available. IBM offers its Business Process Execution Language
for Web Services Java Run Time (BPWS4J), which implements a choreography as an RPC-style web service (for
Document vs. RPC style see next section). Another project
of interest is myGRID [3], which developed Taverna, a
tool that integrates Choreography into a graphical workbench, for creating, editing and browsing workflow. Taverna uses a simple non-standard choreography language,
called XScufl, and is an ongoing collaborative project
between EBI, IT Innovation and the Human Genome
Mapping Project (HGMP) of the Medical Resource Center

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/25

(MRC). The Collaxa BPEL Server [18] implements the
choreography as a document-oriented web service, is easyto-manage with an advanced graphical interface (which
works for IE6 only) but is available under a commercial
license. The Mind Electric (TME) is to release Gaia, and
other engines are being developed at the moment. Most of
these engines support either BPML or BPEL4WS.
Document vs. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) styles
There are two ways of exchanging data between web services: document-oriented vs. remote procedure call (RPC).
The document-style exchanges data as XML documents,
while the RPC-style web service describes the interface in
the format of a method-signature and takes input and output in a programming language specific data type. A data
type-mapping interface (called a proxy in dot Net or a
Serializer in Apache Axis) is used to converse data between
a client and a web service.

While some vendors (e.g., Microsoft) adopt the document-oriented method, others (e.g., IBM, Apache Axis and
SUN) use the RPC-oriented method. In practice, a mixture
of document-style and RPC-style web services will exist.
While it might be easier to wrap an RPC-style web service
interface around existing applications, newly developed
applications could be more inclined to use documentstyle web services. Currently however, most tools that are
available initially have focused on RPC-style web services.

Results and discussion
In our web services choreography scenario [19], a user
obtained a set of microarray spot IDs (GenBank accession
numbers, Affymetrix chip probe set IDs, and Unigene
Cluster IDs) corresponding to the genes (both known and
unknown) being studied. The user then wants to create a
hierarchy of Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
concepts formatted in XML and group the result per MeSH
root category.
Three web services have been created to execute this scenario: one that maps a set of microarray spot IDs to their
corresponding GenBank IDs, and if available their corresponding PubMed IDs and UMLS concept IDs (GetHAPI);
the second web service builds an XML formatted hierarchy
of UMLS concepts for a set of UMLS concept IDs
(GetUMLS), while a third web service generates an XMLbased report of UMLS concept ID occurrences per MeSH
root category from a hierarchy of UMLS concept IDs
(GetUMLSReport). A similar functionality as the choreography of GetHAPI, GetUMLS and GetUMLSReport is provided by the High-density Array Pattern Interpreter
(HAPI) [20,21] developed at the University of California,
San Diego through a web-based (HTML) interface.

When using the traditional web interface of HAPI [21],
the user has to engage in a three-step process. In step 1, the
user provides a name for the result set and uploads a file
containing a list of spot IDs.
Figure 1 shows step 2 of HAPI in which the user needs to
select a column that contains the GenBank IDs and can
enter a name for the HTML summary page. In step 3 the
result file is being generated and the user has to click the
link to view the HTML summary page.
The result, shown in figure 2, is an HTML table containing
a hierarchy of keywords from literature associated with
the genes that were provided. The HTML table displays the
occurrences per category and the split up for each category
of the keywords hierarchy. To retrieve information from
GenCard, Entrez or PubMed the user can click links to
these databases per UMLS keyword.
While the traditional web approach provides the user with
an easy-to-use interface and easy-to-read (HTML) output,
it lacks a flexible programmatic interface, making automatic tool linking and interoperation difficult. The WSDL
files of the choreography and of the web services used in
the choreography on the other hand describe the interfaces and message format that provide the equivalent
functionality of the HAPI application. This allows the client program to access and interpret the output data programmatically. In addition the user can choose to access
additional web services in his choreography, like XEMBL
[22] to retrieve GenBank information for genes of interest,
based upon the outcome of the GetUMLSReport or
choose to access only part of the web services choreography that comprises the HAPI functionality, for instance in
order to retrieve the complete hierarchy of UMLS concepts
associated with the submitted genes or to retrieve only the
PubMed IDs for the associated genes. The result is that the
remote functionality of the HAPI utility can easily be integrated in a local workflow, data can be programmatically
processed and the individual modules can be utilized
more dynamically and flexibly.
Hard coding the implementation of a BPEL workflow
through a Java application allows for the easy implementation of a workflow and the full use of the power of the
Java programming language with the ease of altering the
workflow by simply configuring the BPEL file. Extending
the BPEL workflow can be achieved by adding the invoke
tag of the new web service to the BPEL sequence as long as
the workflow consists of synchronous web services and a
straightforward sequence of web services. Mapping of data
can be achieved by XSL transformations implemented in
Java. While it is fairly simple to implement a Java application and execute the BPEL Workflow, implementing the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/5/25

XML-based scenario in either Collaxa or Taverna is more
arduous.
Taverna provides a user-friendly interface and RPC-style
web services can quickly and easily be implemented in
Taverna without advanced knowledge of web service technologies. It simply involves adding the URL location of
the WSDL to the available services and adding the chosen
operation or method of the web service to the model. By
creating variables and data links the model is completed.
It is very easy to quickly add services to the model, and
reroute the workflow by altering the data links. To execute
the workflow, switch to the Workflow Input Panel and
press the run-button while the result can be viewed in the
result tab (Figure 3). But as Taverna is an ongoing, open
source effort not all Document-style WSDL implementations appeared to be supported at this moment, while
mapping output to input options are still limited, restricting the applicability at this moment.
Collaxa is committed to Document-style web services and
it has created a BPEL designer called bpelz and a browserbased (IE6 only) workflow management console that
allows instance inspection amongst others (Figure 4). The
designer's interface may require still some hand coding of
the source files to make corrections, while most WSDL
files will need to be extended by a partnerLinkType definition. But Collaxa offers full support of BPEL with
advanced support for extensions to the model. Data
sources can be mapped using XPath and BPEL extension
for Java coding is supported.

Conclusions
Web services facilitate bioinformatics software interoperation based on a standard XML-based protocol. While the
development of web service technologies is as much
ongoing as rapid. Many bioinformatics applications have
been published as web services and more initiatives are
being developed. With more web services for bioinformatics becoming available, there will be an increasing need to
use metadata and ontologies to facilitate description,
tracking, classification, and constraining of web services
based upon UDDI or domain-specific standards as developed by BioMoby.
While it is relatively straightforward to implement and
publish web services, the interoperation of bioinformatics
web services through the use of choreography engines is in
the early stage. Documentation and examples for most
choreography engines are scarce. For example, IBM's choreography engine BPWS4J can only be deployed as an RPC
style web service. MyGrid's Taverna offers an advanced
GUI and can process most WSDL files, but support for
document-oriented web services is still limited. Collaxa's
orchestration engine offers full BPEL4WS support, fully

supports document-oriented web services and provides an
easy-to-use and advanced GUI, but it is only available
under a commercial license and its console runs only
under IE6. To sum up, there is a need for further development of user-friendly choreography engines that support
choreography standards like BPEL4WS and both document-style and RPC-style choreographies, as well as
broader manipulation of data. Of the two web service
engines, only Collaxa seemed to support our example
XML-based workflow, providing XPath and full BPEL support. Collaxa requires working knowledge of all web services technologies, whereas Taverna is transparent to use.
For an RPC-based web service and some XMLbased workflow that does not require complex mapping, Taverna can
be used. In addition, it offers advanced support for additional services, which we were not able to fully explore,
and is more than Collaxa focused on the scientific community. While transparent engines fully supporting BPEL
might be available soon, for most simple workflow implementations it is currently still most convenient and flexible to use hard coded implementations. For more
advanced workflow Collaxa can be used while workflow
requiring specific services or RPC based workflow Taverna
is available.

ography engine that is implemented as a documentoriented web service. For demonstration purposes the
choreography engine can be accessed through a web interface that calls the client engine. The user configures a
BPEL file describing the web services choreography and a
WSDL file that describes the choreography engine's web
service interface and message format. The client executes
the preferred workflow of web services as described in
these two files. Figure 5 illustrates the central elements of
the choreography code that integrates the GetHAPI,
GetUMLS, and GetUMLSReport web services.
This web services choreography returns an XML document
that represents a report of UMLS concept occurrences per
category from the hierarchy of UMLS keywords that correlate to the submitted set of microarray spot IDs.

Authors' contributions
KC initiated and directed the research project. RdK performed the technical research and documentation, and
the overall design and implementation of the project. YG
provided XSLT Transformations and assisted in implementation. JL assisted in the data analysis and database
optimization. AK, KY and DC collaborated with the YCMI
team on the web services interoperation. All authors read
and agreed with the final manuscript.

Although it is possible to invoke a web service using any
other protocol, we use WSDL and SOAP. Since we already
know the location of the target web service and its
functionality, publication and discovery with UDDI is not
our focus here, although it is part of the WS-I Basic Profile.
We refer to web services projects such as BioMoby that
extensively use UDDI for more information.
In exchanging messages between web services, we use the
document-oriented method since it has the following
advantages.
1) It uses a language independent and self-describing data
format.
2) It allows for validation based on DTD or XML Schema.
3) It provides a better separation of data and functional
logic.
It allows us to exploit the various bioinformatics-related
XML standards (including BSML[23], BIOML [24,25],
MAGE-ML
[26,27],
etc)
to
further
facilitate
interoperability.
Our web services choreography scenario involves the use
of BPEL4WS to define a workflow that consists of several
document-oriented web services. To execute the choreography, we have created a client that functions as a chore-
