Abstract
Background: The ionophoric coccidiostat salinomycin is widely used in chicken feed. In the near
future the use of ionophore coccidiostats may be banned as has been the case for other
antimicrobial growth promoters. This study was conducted to examine the effect of salinomycin
on Campylobacter jejuni infection and on the composition of the caecal microflora in broiler
chickens.
Methods: An experimental infection study was carried out in isolators and the intestinal
microflora was analyzed using quantitative cultivation, denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis
(DGGE), cloning and sequencing.
Results: We found no effect of salinomycin on C. jejuni but salinomycin significantly affected the
composition of the microflora. In addition, salinomycin significantly reduced the prevalence of
Clostridium perfringens and we observed a significant increase (62%) in the mean body weight of
salinomycin treated chickens compared to un-treated controls.
Conclusion: Termination of the use of ionophore coccidiostats will not affect food safety related
to campylobacter, but will increase the risk of necrotic enteritis in the broilers.

Background
Salinomycin is an ionophoric coccidiostat, which is
widely used as a supplement in poultry feed to control
infection with coccidia [1]. In addition, it is known that
salinomycin, has an inhibitory effect on Clostridium perfringens. Thus, the use of salinomycin leads to a decrease in
the incidence of necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens [27]. It has also been reported that salinomycin can reduce
the prevalence of salmonella in chickens [1]. However,
Scalzo et al. [8] found no reduction in the frequency or the
level of salmonella shedding by the use of salinomycin. In
fact, they observed an increase of one log unit on salmo-

nella colony forming units (cfu) between control and salinomycin treated chickens.
By 2006, the use of all antimicrobial growth promoters
was prohibited in the European Union. Also the use of
ionophore coccidiostats is expected to be banned in the
near future [6]. The consequences of such a ban on the
incidences of C. perfringens related diseases or the prevalence of salmonella and campylobacter is essentially
unknown. Likewise, the action and selective pressure of
salinomycin on the normal intestinal microflora of
broiler chickens is still not clearly elucidated.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of salinomycin on Campylobacter jejuni infection and on the
composition of the microflora of the caecum in broiler
chickens. This was completed using experimental infection and bacterial culturing. Additionally, the DNA fingerprinting
technique
Denaturant
Gradient
Gel
Electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning and sequencing of
16s rDNA was carried out.

Methods
Animals, experimental design, sampling and cultivation
The chickens used in this study were conventional broiler
chickens (Ross) of mixed sex, purchased as day-old from
a local hatchery (DanHatch A/S, Randers, Denmark). The
chickens were transferred directly from the hatchery to the
experimental unit, where they were housed in isolators
(Montair Andersen B.V. HM 1500, The Netherlands).

Initially, transport-boxes, feed and water samples from
each isolator, and cloacal swabs from 5 randomly selected
chickens from each isolator, were analyzed for the presence of campylobacter by cultivation.
The chickens were divided into 6 experimental groups
(Table 1). The 6 groups, each with an initial size of 37 dayold chickens, were kept in separate isolators. The chickens
had access to feed and water ad libitum. They were fed a
conventional wheat based broiler feed without antimicrobial additives (Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, University
of Aarhus, Denmark). However, the diet of group 1 and 2
was supplemented with salinomycin (75 mg/kg) from day
8 and onwards. At day 14, all chickens from group 1 to 4,
were orally inoculated with approximately 1 × 109 cfu of
C. jejuni strain DVI-sc181. The control groups (group 5
and 6) were given a 0.9% NaCl solution. The inoculation
was carried out inside the isolators by individual oral gavage of 500 µl of a bacterial suspension or a NaCl solution,
using a 1 ml syringe with an attached flexible tube.
Samples were taken at day 7, 13, 16, 23, 30 and 36, respectively. At each sampling 6 birds were removed from each

Four groups (1–4) of 14-day old broiler chickens (37 birds per group)
were infected orally with Campylobacter jejuni (109 colony forming
units). Groups 1 and 2 were given feed containing salinomycin from
day 8. Two additional groups (5 – 6) were kept as controls.

group and killed by decapitation. The gastrointestinal
tract was excised and the contents of the ileum and caecum were collected. The intestinal contents from 3 chickens were pooled by segment before further analysis.
Quantitative cultivation of C. jejuni, C. perfringens and
lactobacilli was carried out from caecal and ileal contents
of the chickens at each sampling. The samples were
diluted in 10-fold steps in buffered peptone water (BPW:
Merck 1.07228) and quantification was done by the
spread-plate method on mCCDA (Oxoid, Basingstoke,
UK), incubated microaerophilically at 42°C for 48 h.
Likewise, lactobacilli were enumerated on Rogosa agar
(Merck 5413) after anaerobic incubation at 37°C for 48 h.
C. perfringens were counted as black colonies surrounded
by a precipitation zone on Tryptose-sulphite-cycloserine
agar [9] containing egg-yolk after anaerobic incubation at
37°C for 24 h. Furthermore, samples from the caecum
and ileum were collected in Eppendorf tubes, for a 16S
rDNA-based study of the microbial community, and
stored in a 3 times volumen of ethanol at 4°C until further processing. The experiment was carried out in accordance with the guidelines from the Danish Ministry of
Justice with respect to animal experiments.
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from the caecal contents. An amount
of 1.6 ml of caecal material suspended in ethanol was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was discarded and the sample was washed with BPW and
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. The washing step
was repeated. Finally, the DNA was extracted using the
QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany). The extraction was carried out in accordance with
the instructions of the manufacturer, with an additional
step of lysozyme treatment, which was added to the procedure before the use of InhibitEX tablets. An amount of
140 µl of a 10 mg/ml solution of lysosyme (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in Tris-EDTA buffer (10:1
mM), pH 8, was added to each extraction tube and the
samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The DNA was
eluted in 200 µl buffer AE (Qiagen) and stabilised by adding 4 µl of a 40 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Ambion,
Cambridgeshire, UK) and 2 µl of Ribonuclease-A. All
DNA samples were stored at -20°C until further processing.
PCR amplification with HDA (universal 16S rDNA)primers
PCR amplifications of total bacterial community DNA
were performed using the primers HDA1-GC (5'-CGC
CCG GGG CGC GCC CCG GGC GGG GCG GGG GCA
CGG GGG GAC TCC TAC GGG AGG CAG CAG T-'3 ; GCclamp in boldface) and HDA2 (5'-GTA TTA CCG CGG
CTG CTG GCA C-3') (DNA-Technology, Aarhus, Denmark). The thermocycling programme was: 94°C for 4/12
min; 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 68°C

for 1 min; and finally 68°C for 7 min [10]. PCR was performed in 0.2 ml tubes with a Peltier Thermal Cycler
(PTC) 200 (MJ Research Inc, Watertown, MA, USA) and a
reaction mixture as previously described [11]. The PCR
products were confirmed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel containing 0.1 µg/ml ethidium bromide (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and viewed by UV transillumination.
DGGE analysis
DGGE was performed with the Dcode universal mutation
detection system (Bio-Rad) using 16 cm by 16 cm by 1
mm gels. The 8% polyacrylamide gels (ratio of acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) (Bio-Rad) contained a 30 to
55% gradient of urea and formamide (Fluka, SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) increasing in the direction of
electrophoresis, which was run at 130 V and 60°C for 4 h.
The gels were stained with SybrGold (1:10,000 dilution)
(Bie & Berntsen, Herlev, Denmark) and viewed by UV
transillumination [11].

The DGGE ladder used in this experiment was prepared
from individual pure cultures (Lactobacillus johnsonii,
Lactobacillus acidophilus, C. jejuni, Escherichia coli and C.
perfringens) as previously described [11].
The intestinal bacterial community profiles were compared using the BioNumerics software (Applied Maths
BVBA, Belgium). Initially, the DGGE gels were normalized by means of the DGGE markers used, and the software conducted a band search according to a 5%
minimum profiling and a 10% grey-zone interval. Subsequently, all bands were checked manually. The comparisons were based on the Dice similarity coefficient and the
un-weighted pair group method using arithmetic averages
(UPGMA) for clustering.
Cloning and sequencing
DNA samples from the caecum of three 7-day-old chickens and three caecum samples from the 30-day-old chickens were cloned using primer pair 26F (5'-AGA GTT TGA
TCC TGG CTC A-3') and 1390R (5'-GAC GGG CGG TGT
GTA CAA-3') (DNA Technology) and the following
amplification programme: 1 min at 93°C followed by 25
cycles of 30 s at 92°C, 60 s at 57°C, and 45 s at 72°C. In
the last cycle, the 72°C step was extended for 5 min, and
the samples were finally cooled down to 4°C. The PCR
product was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification
kit (Qiagen) and cloned into E. coli using the Topo XL
cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as specified
by the manufacturer. All clones were checked by DGGE
(using primer pair HDA1-GC and HDA2) and selected for
sequencing on the basis of their migration in the gel. In
total 100 clones (30 from the 7-day-old chickens and 70
from the 30-day old chickens) were screened. Plasmid

DNA of the selected clones was purified using the GenElute Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). For sequencing of clones the Dyenamic ET Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit from Amersham Biosciences and primer
341F (5'-CCC ACG GGA GGC AGC AG-3') (DNA Technology) were used and the sequencing was carried out on
an ABI 3100 capillary DNA analysing system. The
retrieved sequences were compared with the Genbank
database using BLAST algorithm [12].
Phylogenetic analysis
The clones were analyzed in order to visualize their similarities to known bacterial species. Multiple sequence
alignments of the nucleotide sequences were performed
using the CLUSTAL W program [13] and the alignment
editor GENEDOC [14]. The phylogenetic analysis was
made using the software PHYLIP [15] and TREEVIEW
[16]. A neighbour joining tree was generated on the basis
of 280 base pair sequences and the robustness of the tree
was evaluated by the bootstrapping-resembling method
with 1000 replicates.

Results
Bacterial counts
No campylobacter was detected in the transport boxes, the
feed and water samples or in the day-old chickens.

The results of the bacterial counts are shown in Tables 2
(ileum) and 3 (caecum). A persistent infection with C.
jejuni was established in both the ileum and the caecum of
the chickens from the day of infection and throughout the
experiment. The counts of C. jejuni were 1 to 2 orders of
magnitude higher in the caecal samples compared to the
ileal samples. There was no significant difference in C.
jejuni counts in infected birds treated with salinomycin
(groups 1 and 2) compared to infected but untreated
groups (3 and 4), with one exception at day 30, where the
C. jejuni counts were significantly higher in the salinomycin treated chickens, in both the ileum and the caecum.
In salinomycin treated chickens (groups 1 and 2),C. perfringens was detected in 6 out of 24 ileal samples examined
and in 5 out of 20 caecal samples examined. In the
remaining groups (3 to 6), which all received broiler feed
without salinomycin, C. perfringens was detected in
almost all samples, with an exception of group 6, where
only 7 of 12 and 6 of 11 samples were positive in the
ileum and the caecum, respectively. In the ileum, there
was a significant difference between the C. perfringens
counts in the C. jejuni infected, salinomycin treated chickens (groups 1 and 2) compared to the C. jejuni infected
chickens without salinomycin treatment (groups 3 and 4)
on day 16, 23, 30 and 36. In the caecum there was a significant difference between the C. perfringens counts in the
salinomycin treated chickens compared to untreated

BioNumerics. At day 7 the chickens did not cluster according to treatment, but samples originating from the same
isolator were often more related to each other than to
samples from other isolators, indicating a minor group
effect. However, already from day 13 and onwards salinomycin treated chickens and control chickens clustered
into two different groups, indicating an effect of salinomycin on the normal intestinal microflora. At all four
sampling days, salinomycin treated chickens had a lower
within-group similarity index than the control chickens
(data not shown).

The DGGE band patterns of samples from day 23 and 30
(Figure 2), clustered into two distinct groups comprising
the salinomycin + C. jejuni treated chickens (groups 1 and
2) and the C. jejuni infected chickens (groups 3 and 4).
The similarity index between the two groups was approximately 58%. The within-group-similarity index of the
salinomycin treated chickens was approximately 72% and
the within-group similarity value of the non-treated, C.
jejuni infected chickens was approximately 62%. At day
23, a 64% within-group-similarity of the salinomycin
treated chickens and a 70% within-group-similarity of the
non-treated, C. jejuni infected chickens was found. However one of the C. jejuni infected, non-treated samples represented the base of the dendrogram and showed only
50% similarity to the remaining samples.

Cloning and sequencing
A total of 49 clones were chosen for sequencing on basis
of their different migrations in the DGGE, giving 48 useful
sequences (Table 4). The caecal samples, from which the
clones originated, are shown in Table 4. Blasting the
sequences resulted in two clones being most closely
related to C. jejuni, 2 to Clostridium neonatale, 1 to Lactobacillus sp. and 3 were most closely related to Shigella boydii
and E. coli. Forty sequences were most closely related to an
uncultured bacterium. All sequences were aligned and
phylogenetically analyzed in order to identify, which
groups of well-known bacteria they were related to. A
neighbor joining distance tree (Figure 3) showed that 12
clones clustered with ruminococci. Seventy-five per cent
of these originated from non-treated caecal samples.
Another group of 7 clones clustered with Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii and related organisms. These clones all originated from caecal samples taken at 30 days of age (3 different treatments). The remaining clones clustered among
E. coli, C. jejuni and different clostridia or lactobacilli. Two

Discussion
In this study we found no effect of salinomycin on a C.
jejuni infection in chickens. This is in agreement with
Bolder et al [1] who found that salinomycin was unable to
affect both the incidence and the degree of campylobacter
shedding. However, by using the fingerprinting technique
DGGE, we found that salinomycin had an effect on the
intestinal microflora of the caecum after 5 days of treatment (Day 13) in control chickens and after 15 days of
treatment (Day 23) in C. jejuni infected chickens. Knarreborg et al. [17] found a similar effect of antimicrobial supplementation on the composition of the microflora in the
ileum of broilers. By using group specific primers these
authors showed that lactobacilli and C. perfringens were
most strongly affected by the antimicrobial treatment.
In the present study, we demonstrated no significant effect
of salinomycin on the counts of lactobacilli. We found
however a higher variation between lactobacilli counts in
the ileum, where counts varied between 104 and 109 cfu
compared to caecal counts, which varied between 107 and
109 cfu/g content. This could be explained by the fact, that
the caecum is a more stable environment than the ileum.
Additionally, one clone (chosen among 6 similar DGGE
bands) originating from the caecum of a salinomycin
treated chicken was closely related to lactobacilli, indicating conformity between the bacterial counts and the
molecular analysis.
The impact of salinomycin on C. perfringens was very pronounced. In our study salinomycin significantly reduced
the prevalence of C. perfringens, although C. perfringens
was found in low numbers in some chickens. In addition,
we observed a significant increase (62%) of the mean
body weight in salinomycin treated chickens compared to
non-treated chickens. An infection with C. jejuni on the
other hand, did not seem to affect weight gain or body
weight. This extremely high benefit from using salinomycin in the feed is difficult to explain and is more pronounced than reported for other antimicrobials [18].
Some of the important factors, associated with broiler

http://www.actavetscand.com/content/49/1/30

growth depression are nutrient competition, production
of metabolites or toxins and microbial deconjugation of
bile salts [3,17,19]. An inhibitory effect from C. perfringens
in untreated groups may be part of the explanation
[17,20], but by analyzing our DGGE gels it is obvious, that
numerous bacterial groups are involved and therefore it
seems more likely that other factors play a role, too.
In this study, clones originating from salinomycin treated
chickens were widely distributed among the phylogenetic
groups. Thus, cloning and sequencing gave no unambiguous result concerning specific groups being affected by
salinomycin. Future studies, with larger clone libraries are
a necessity to elucidate this. It is noteworthy that none of
the clones from 7-day-old chickens clustered with F. prausnitzii or lactobacilli and the phylogenetic analysis of the
clones showed that the initial flora of the caecum was
dominated by bacteria closely related to clostridia, ruminococci, E. coli and related organisms.
Analysis of DGGE fingerprints showed a lower withingroup-similarity in salinomycin treated chickens compared to control chickens. This indicates, that salinomycin
affects the dynamics of the gut microflora, causing the
salinomycin treated chickens to be more different from
each other, compared to control chickens. It also indicates
that salinomycin altered the microflora, but it did not
reduce the microbial diversity or number of genotypes.
This is in accordance with recent observations of the
effects of avilamycin, bacitracin and enramycin [18].

Conclusion
In conclusion, salinomycin did not affect the course of a
Campylobacter infection in broiler chickens. This observation is important and indicates that cessation of the use of
ionophore coccidiostats will not affect food safety related
to Campylobacter. However, salinomycin caused a pronounced increase in the body-weight of the chickens.
Also, an effect on C. perfringens and on the normal intestinal microflora was observed, and the numbers of C. perfringens were significantly reduced by salinomycin. C.
perfringens is normally present in the intestinal microflora
of 75% to 95% of broiler chickens [21,22,22]. Thus, a stop
in the use of ionophore coccidiostats will most likely lead
to an increase in the cases of necrotic enteritis, to a lower
performance and to an increased mortality in broiler
flocks unless other measures are installed to control C.
perfringens.
