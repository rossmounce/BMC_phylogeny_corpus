Abstract
Background: The origin and prevalence of the prehispanic settlers of the Canary Islands has
attracted great multidisciplinary interest. However, direct ancient DNA genetic studies on
indigenous and historical 17th–18th century remains, using mitochondrial DNA as a female marker,
have only recently been possible. In the present work, the analysis of Y-chromosome
polymorphisms in the same samples, has shed light on the way the European colonization affected
male and female Canary Island indigenous genetic pools, from the conquest to present-day times.
Results: Autochthonous (E-M81) and prominent (E-M78 and J-M267) Berber Y-chromosome
lineages were detected in the indigenous remains, confirming a North West African origin for their
ancestors which confirms previous mitochondrial DNA results. However, in contrast with their
female lineages, which have survived in the present-day population since the conquest with only a
moderate decline, the male indigenous lineages have dropped constantly being substituted by
European lineages. Male and female sub-Saharan African genetic inputs were also detected in the
Canary population, but their frequencies were higher during the 17th–18th centuries than today.
Conclusion: The European colonization of the Canary Islands introduced a strong sex-biased
change in the indigenous population in such a way that indigenous female lineages survived in the
extant population in a significantly higher proportion than their male counterparts.

Background
The Canary Islands are a volcanic archipelago consisting
of seven main islands situated in the Atlantic Ocean, facing the western Saharan coast of Africa. Fuerteventura and
Lanzarote are the easternmost islands, the former being
only a hundred km from the continent.

The Islands were already known to Mediterranean Classical cultures, but the Archipelago was rediscovered and visited by Genovese, Majorcan, Portuguese and French
sailors during the 13th and 14th centuries. Under the auspices of the Castilian crown, Europeans conquered the
Canary Islands during the 15th century, beginning with

Lanzarote in 1402 and finishing with Tenerife in 1496.
The conquest was rather violent because the Guanches
often fought fiercely against the invaders. Even islands
such as Lanzarote or Gomera, which pacifically received
the first Norman and Castilian expeditions, were the scene
of violent revolts because the natives were enslaved in
large numbers to defray the cost of the military expeditions. In retaliation, the rebels, mainly men, were killed
and massively deported by the conquerors [1].
There are several questions about the past and present of
the Guanches that have attracted the curiosity of scientists
since the 19th century. They refer to the time(s) and way(s)
they arrived on the islands, their geographic origin, and
whether their descendants persist in the present-day population [2]. The oldest human settlement seems to be no
earlier than the first millennium B.C., according to absolute C14 dating [3]. Coalescence age estimates obtained
from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [4] and Y-chromosome [5] putative founder lineages concord with archeological results.
As the islands were never connected with the African Continent, they had to be reached by sea. Their inhabitants
did not supposedly have seafaring skills and communication among islands was thus absent at the time of the
Spanish conquest. This poses the unresolved dilemma of
whether the first settlers reached the islands by themselves
and after that forgot their sailing skills or if they were
transported to the islands by another maritime people [6].
From the beginning of the conquest, Guanche dialects
and customs were found to be related to those of their N
African Berber neighbors. Since then, anthropological,
archeological and linguistic studies have provided further
support to the N African origin of the indigenous population [7]. Furthermore, the different human types discovered and the heterogeneity of their cultural remains again
points to the possibility of successive arrivals of N African
settlers [8-13].
In spite of the aggressive conquest and subsequent massive European immigration and North and sub-Saharan
African slave importation to the islands, historians estimated that approximately two-thirds of the Canary population were Africans and aborigines at the end of the 16th
century [14]. Moreover, osteological studies comparing
aboriginal remains and modern rural populations, support the persistence of indigenous traits in the current
population [10,15].
From the genetic perspective, strong evidence in support
of a N African origin of the indigenous ancestors and their
present-day persistence was only obtained when uniparental genetic markers were analyzed. Mitochondrial DNA

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/181

(mtDNA) lineages, belonging to the U6 haplogroup [16],
and Y-chromosome haplotypes of the E1b1b1b haplogroup, characterized by the M81 marker [17], both with a
clear Berber origin, were detected in the Canary islanders
at a significantly higher presence than in Iberians, their
main colonizers [4,5]. In addition, admixture analysis taking the Iberians, Northwest and sub-Saharan West African
populations as parental sources of the present-day Canary
population, showed that the indigenous contribution was
estimated to be 33% of maternal lineages [4] and only 7%
for paternal lineages [5]. This strong sexual asymmetry
was explained by a sociological bias favoring matings
between Iberian males and indigenous females, and the
greater indigenous male mortality during the Conquest
[2]. Accordingly, intermediate admixture estimates were
obtained when autosomal markers were used [18,19]. It is
also worth mentioning that the detection of significant
correlations between relative frequencies and/or diversity
values for mtDNA, CD4/Alu haplotypes and ABO gene
data, and geographical distances of the islands from Africa
were explained assuming only one main colonization
event [4,18,19]. On the contrary, using Y-chromosome
markers, two opposite correlations were found [5], which
was explained by at least two independent waves of colonists from NW Africa, still detectable today. These genetic
results, although congruent with previous anthropological, archeological and linguistic data, have not been free of
criticism. It is well known that admixture values strongly
depend on the appropriate choice of the parental populations. To extrapolate the unknown indigenous population
from a NW African sample pool seems unsuitable,
because although the mtDNA haplogrup U6 present in
the Canary Islanders and in North Africa originates in the
latter [20], the most abundant Canary sublineage, U6b1,
is absent in NW Africa, and the most abundant U6a sublineages on that continent are very scarce in the archipelago [4,16,21] pointing to different N African sources.
Moreover, the unquestionably N African lineages present
in the present-day Canary population may not be wholly
due to the indigenous heritage but to Iberian colonizers,
since these lineages, albeit in low frequencies, are also
present in Spain and Portugal [22,23]. Another possibility
is that those U6 lineages present in the islands may derive
from slaves brought from the NW African coast after the
conquest. However, all these concerns vanished when
mtDNA information was obtained directly from indigenous remains [24], and exhumed 17th–18th century
remains from Tenerife [25]. The presence of U6b1 lineages and other presumed founder lineages were detected
in both samples, confirming their prehispanic origin. In
addition, the direct incorporation of the indigenous sample as a parental source of the admixed Canary Islands
populations provided greater indigenous female component estimates (42–73%) than those based on the
present-day NW African maternal gene pool (33–43%).

Although most of the populational molecular genetic
studies carried out on skeletal remains have used mtDNA,
mainly because of its copy number per cell, sex-typing
based on the XY amelogenin test has also been frequently
and successfully used since the beginning of the ancient
DNA (aDNA) typing era [26-28]. Recent achievements in
Neanderthal whole nuclear genome [29,30] and gene specific [31,32] studies prompted us to undertake a Y-chromosome SNP analysis in the indigenous population of
the islands, which is crucial to determine the relative survival of the prehispanic male genetic pool in the presentday population. The goal was to directly type North-African geographically structured Y-chromosome binary
markers in samples from indigenous and 17th–18th century remains that were already successfully analyzed for
mtDNA [24,25] and proven to be males by an amelogenin-based sexing test [33]. The statistical null hypotheses of these analyses would be that male haplogroup
frequencies in the indigenous and historical samples
should not be significantly different from those found in
the modern Canary population.

Results and discussion
Sample typing and methods
First of all, contamination was not detected in extraction
or PCR negative controls, in any case of Y-chromosome
analysis, although sporadic contamination was observed
when the previous mtDNA analysis was performed. PCR
efficiency with the samples selected for the present Y-chromosome analysis was 58% in the indigenous material and
63% in La Concepción historical material. However, taking into account previous mtDNA and amelogenin analysis, only 30 (10%) of the total indigenous and 42 (21%)
of the historical samples produced Y-chromosome positive results. From the 30 successfully amplified indigenous samples, 24 were from Gran Canaria, 3 from
Fuerteventura, 2 from Tenerife and 2 from Gomera.

For the direct Y-chromosome markers amplification, a
mean of 366 ± 254 initial molecules was quantified by
real-time PCR. However, the limited amount of DNA substrate left after the mtDNA and amelogenin analysis, and
the frequent PCR inhibition problems due to the relatively large amount of extract necessary to directly amplify
each marker, required the inclusion of a prior preamplification step. At first, we unsuccessfully tried whole genome
amplification. Secondly, we turned to a specific multiplex
approach using the whole sixteen primer-pair set in one
reaction but, although some specific products were
obtained, the relative abundance of unspecific amplifications made this method difficult to apply. Only when the
sixteen markers were subdivided into three different multiplex assays (Additional file 1), clean specific products
were obtained in subsequent nested PCR reamplifica-

tions. Cloning and sequencing confirmed the PCR amplification specificity for all the markers used.
Although a hierarchical approach was followed in the
RFLP analysis in La Laguna (Additional file 2), all the samples were first typed for the phylogenetically basal M89
marker, the three most frequent North African markers
(M78, M81, M267) and M269, the most abundant European marker. The same five markers were also replicated
in the Porto lab using a first multiplex SNaPshot analysis
(Additional file 3). Samples derived for M78, M81, M267
and M269 were not included in further analyses; those
derived for M89 were subsequently analyzed for the M9,
M45, M170, M172, M173 and M201 multiplex set; and
ancestral ones for the M2, M33, M34, M60 and M96 multiplex set.
Authenticity of ancient DNA results
We are confident in the authenticity of our results for several reasons. First, only those samples that showed a relatively high initial copy number in the real-time PCR
quantification assay were successfully analyzed. Second,
we never detected contamination in any of the negative
controls performed in extraction and amplification.
Third, all the markers analyzed in the same individual
always gave genealogically congruent results for their
respective ancestral or derived status. Fourth, replication
of all the samples in two independent laboratories produced identical results. Fifth, haplogroup types and frequencies obtained for the indigenous and historical
samples were very different, but in accordance with the
predictions based on historical and archeological records.
Sixth, haplogroups crucial to the correct interpretation of
the results, such as E-M81, were not detected in the panel
of male researchers that handled the remains from each
excavation (Additional file 4).
Y-SNP haplogroups in indigenous and historical Canary
Island populations
Y-SNP haplogroups in indigenous and historical Canary
Island populations are shown in Table 1. The autochthonous N African E-M81 haplogroup was the most abundant type in the indigenous sample (26.7%). It is also the
most common in NW Africa (64%) with its highest frequency in the Western Sahara (76%) [17,34]. The E-M81
marker is rare outside N Africa and its presence in the Iberian Peninsula has mainly been considered a result of
Moorish influence [5,17]. In the historical sample, the EM81 frequency was 11.9%, more similar to that found in
the current Canary Islands (8.3%) than to the indigenous
sample (26.7%). Taking into account the low frequency of
this haplogroup in sub-Saharan Africa, its presence in the
historical sample could be better explained by indigenous
persistence than by later trade in sub-Saharan slaves.
However, it is also to be expected that some E-M81 line-

Comparison of Y-chromosome haplogroup frequencies (%) among the indigenous (ABO), historical (CON), and extant samples from the seven
Canary Islands (Lanzarote: LAN; Fuerteventura: FUE; Gran Canaria: GCA; Tenerife: TFE; Gomera: GOM; La Palma: PAL; Hierro: HIE), total
Canaries sample (CAN) and current Northwest African (NWA), North Central African (NCA), Saharan (SAH) and Iberian Peninsula (IBE)
populations.

ages reached the islands due to the minor NW African
slave-trade. The notable E-M81 frequency decrease in the
historical sample, relative to the indigenous one, is in
agreement with a strong European replacement of the
indigenous males at the beginning of the conquest [5].
Congruently, the European R-M269 haplogroup was
already the most frequent in the historical sample
(42.9%). R-M269 reaches 60% in the Iberian peninsula
[35] but is found at a low frequency in NW Africa (4–6%),
and seems to have been introduced there from Europe in
historical times [17]. Its frequency in the extant Canary

population (53.2%) is similar to that found in the Iberian
Peninsula, pointing to a mainly European origin for the
present-day male pool in the Canaries [5]. The fact that a
similar frequency has been found in the historical sample,
again points to a strong European replacement of the
male indigenous pool since the early conquest period.
Surprisingly, R-M269 was also found in the indigenous
sample in a moderate frequency (10%). Its presence in the
indigenous people could be explained in two ways: (a) RM269 was introduced into NW Africa in prehistoric not
historical times, or (b) the presence of this marker in the
aborigines was due to a prehispanic European gene flow

into the indigenous population. As NW African R-M269
chromosomes showed close STR-similarity to the Iberian
ones [17], pointing to recent contacts between both
regions, the second option appears more plausible.
A sub-Saharan component is detected in both indigenous
(3.3%) and historical (7.1%) samples. E-M33 was the
only sub-Saharan marker found in aborigines. In Africa,
its highest frequencies have been detected in Southern
(51%) and Central areas (57%) [17,36]. However, as its
frequencies in North-Central Moroccan Berbers (3.2%)
and in Saharan people (3.5%) [34] are similar to that
found in the indigenous sample, its prehispanic presence
in the islands could be due to the same NW African colonization that brought E-M81. E-M33 was also detected in
the historical population (2.4%) which, together with E-

M81, could indicate a moderate indigenous Y-lineage persistence in the 17th–18th centuries. Although its presence
could also be the result of the later sub-Saharan slave
trade, its limited frequency in the Gulf of Guinea [17], the
main source of slaves, makes this second option less probable. The E-M2 branch is another sub-Saharan haplogroup [37,38] present in the historical sample (4.76%). It
reaches its highest frequency in Mali and has been proposed as a marker of the Bantu expansion [38]. So, its
presence in the 17th–18th century population could indicate direct influence due to slavery. In fact, it is well documented that, for instance, in Gran Canaria more than
10,000 slaves were introduced during the 16th century.
The majority of these slaves came from regions of subSaharan Africa [39] where E-M2 is the most abundant Ychromosome haplogroup [17,36]. E-M2 is also present in

NW African populations [17,34] so, although this marker
was not detected in our small indigenous sample, a prehispanic NW African origin cannot be ruled out.

the indigenous pool is compatible with a direct Mediterranean input, or to a more ancient demic influx from
Europe to N Africa than has yet been proposed [17].

Some additional haplogroups detected in indigenous
and/or historical Canaries samples (M78, M172, M173,
M201 and M267), appear in the Iberian Peninsula as well
as in NW Africa [17,34-36,40-47]. Nevertheless, M78 and
M267, which are more abundant in the latter (Table 1),
have a higher frequency in the indigenous sample (23.3%
and 16.7%, respectively) than in the 17th–18th centuries
population (11.9% in both cases), which is again in
accordance with a NW African origin for the prehispanic
colonizers of the islands.

Genetic distances and AMOVA
In order to detect genetic differences between populations, pairwise FST comparisons (Table 2) were carried out.
It was found that the indigenous Canary Island population has its highest affinities with N Central Africa (p =
0.01) and with the historical population (p = 0.002),
compared to the rest of the samples (p < 0.0001). In turn,
the historical sample was more closely related to the
present-day Canary populations (from p = 0.43 to p =
0.02) than to the Iberian Peninsula (p = 0.003), being
highly divergent from Africa (p < 0.0001). These relative
relationships are graphically represented in the bidimensional plot of the multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis performed with the FST distance matrix (Figure 1a). The
indigenous sample is halfway between N Central Africa
and the 17th–18th century sample; the latter standing
closer to the present-day Canary populations and to the
Iberian Peninsula. Results from the principal component
analysis (PCA) are highly congruent with the MDS plot
(Figure 1b). The only discrepancy is that, in this case, the
indigenous sample is closer to NW Africa than to N Central Africa. The first principal component (accounting for
37% of the whole variance) clearly separates Canarian
aborigines and Africans from the present-day Canary and
Iberian samples, leaving the historical sample in an intermediate position. Haplogroups E-M81 and J-M267 on the
one hand, and R-M269, G-M201 and J-M172 on the
other, are mainly responsible for these positive and negative displacements. Additionally, in the second component (17% of the whole variance) the sub-Saharan
haplogroup E-M96 is the main source of the positive displacements of the Iberian peninsula and N Central Africa
from the present-day Canary Islanders and the group
composed by NW African, indigenous and Saharan populations, respectively. On the negative side, the sub-Saharan E-M2 and E-M33 haplogroups clearly make the
Eastern islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote closer to

Due to the low variance of J-M267 in N Africa compared
to that in the Middle East, its presence in the former has
been related to the Arab expansion in the 7th century A.D.
[36]. However, if the arrival of the indigenous people in
the islands was around 1,000 years B.C. [48], the presence
of J-M267 in NW Africa could be previous to the Arab
expansion. Alternatively, this marker might have reached
the islands with a second wave of colonists.
Similarly to E-M81, the frequencies of E-M78 and J-M267
decrease in the historical and present-day Canary populations, again highlighting the strong demic impact of the
European colonists before the 17th–18th centuries. On the
other hand, haplogroups with a comparatively higher
European presence such as M172, M201 and M173 (comprising SRY1532 and M17) were only detected in the historical sample, therefore, they most probably reached the
islands after the European conquest.
The presence of the I-M170 haplogroup in the indigenous
sample (6.7%) deserves special attention. This haplogroup is the only major clade of the Y-chromosome phylogeny that is widespread over Europe and almost absent
elsewhere, suggesting that it originated there [49]. It is
especially abundant in the eastern Mediterranean area,
with its highest frequencies in the Balkans [50]. Therefore,
the presence of this European Y-chromosome lineage in

the historical sample, and the aborigines to the Sahara
(Figure 1b).
AMOVA analyses were performed to assess the relative
amount of variance attributed to differences among and
within natural geographic areas. When the indigenous
and historical samples were included within the Canarian
group, 80% of the total variance was observed within populations (FST), 3% among populations within groups
(FSC) and 17% among groups (FCT). However, when the
indigenous sample was removed from the analysis or
grouped with N Africa, FCT increased to 18%, whereas FSC
decreases to 2.4%. When, in addition to the aborigines,
the historical sample was also removed, the variance partition values did not change. These results indicate, once
more, that the indigenous sample is comparatively more
similar to the N African than to the present-day Canary
population, while the C 17th–18th historical sample shows
more affinities with the modern Canary Island population.
Male vs. female contributions
To explain the current demographic composition of the
Canaries, in previous genetic approaches their present-day
inhabitants were considered as a hybrid population with
a NW African substrate, contributed most probably by
Berber indigenous founders, a substantial European input
and, to a lesser degree, a sub-Saharan African component,
introduced after the conquest as slaves. Consequently,
admixture estimates were calculated using present-day
Iberian, NW African and sub-Saharan W African populations as parental sources. Results based on uniparental
markers have provided contradictory evidence pointing to
a considerable sexually asymmetric contribution, with a
predominant (92%) male European contribution [5] and
a high (33–43%) NW African female component [4,51].
More recently, the maternal indigenous substrate has
been directly estimated from ancient remains [24] showing a higher indigenous contribution (42–73%) than that
estimated when the present-day NW African mtDNA gene
pool was used. Admixture proportions based on mtDNA
were also calculated for the 17th–18th century population
of Tenerife [25] and a higher sub-Saharan African influence was found (14%) than in the present-day population
(5%).

The Y-chromosome data obtained in the present study,
from the same indigenous and historical populations,
allowed a similar direct analysis of the male gene-pool
(Table 3). Iberian males appear as the main contributors
to the extant Canary population (83.0% ± 4.7%) but to a
lesser extent than the indirect estimation (92%). Accordingly, the indigenous component (16.1% ± 4.6%) is also
higher than before (7%), whereas the sub-Saharan input
was similar (1%). When these indigenous and sub-Saha-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/181

ran male contributions were compared to their respective
female contributions, a significant sex bias favoring indigenous (p < 0.01) and sub-Saharan (p < 0.05) female persistence was observed. As for the 17th–18th century
historical population, although the main contribution
was already Iberian (63.2 ± 14.5%), at that time the indigenous (31.1 ± 14.0) and sub-Saharan (5.8 ± 4.4) influences were greater than today but, in this case, male and
female contribution comparisons did not reach significant differences. Nevertheless, these results have to be
taken with caution because the historical sample has been
taken from a single burial in Tenerife, whereas the indigenous sample is made up of several archeological sites from
different islands.

Conclusion
The presence of autochthonous North African E-M81 lineages, and also other relatively abundant markers (E-M78
and J-M267) from the same region in the indigenous population, strongly points to that area as the most probable
origin of the Guanche ancestors. This is in accordance
with previous genetic studies performed on the same
material at mtDNA level [24], and in support of the cultural connections found between the Berbers and the
indigenous islanders people [9,15,52]. In addition to this
mainly NW African colonization, the detection in the
indigenous sample of markers like I-M170 and R-M269 of
clear European ascription might suggest that other secondary waves also reached the Archipelago, most likely
from the Mediterranean basin. This would again be in
agreement with the multiple settlement theory proposed
to explain the physical and cultural diversity found
between and within the different islands [3,52]. However,
as these markers are also present in N Africa, albeit in low
frequencies, it could be that they arrived in the islands
during the same African wave(s) that brought E-M81 and
reached relatively high frequencies there due to founder
and genetic-drift effects. If so, the presence of these markers in N Africa may be older than previously proposed
[17].
Compared to the original natives, the 17th–18th century
historical sample mainly differs by harboring lower frequencies of NW African haplogroups (p < 0.05), such as
E-M81 (11.9% vs 26.7%), E-M78 (11.9% vs 23.3%) and
J-M267 (11.9% vs 16.7%), and higher frequencies for
European haplogroups (p < 0.001) like R-M269 (42.9%
vs 10.0%) or R-M173, (9.5% vs 0.0%). A notable exception was I-M170 because it was not detected in the historical sample, despite being moderately frequent in the
aborigines (6.7%).
Different founder effects on different islands could be a
plausible explanation, since all the natives carrying IM170 were from Gran Canaria, whereas the historical

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/181

sample was taken from Tenerife. Another difference
between these two samples is the higher, albeit not significant, frequency of sub-Saharan lineages (7.1% vs 3.3%)
in this historical population. However, these differences
were not detected at mtDNA level [24,25], as the NW African haplogroup U6 (10.2% vs 10.0%) and the most abundant and widespread European haplogroup H (46.9% vs
52.1%) showed similar frequencies in both samples. The
sharp and swift change observed for the indigenous male
and female genetic pools can be satisfactorily explained if
it is accepted that indigenous females were reproductively
more successful after the conquest than males, who were
displaced by male European colonizers. Although sampling bias and drift effects could also explain these differences, the genetic data corroborate historical chronicles
that narrated frequent mass killings and deportations of
mainly males during the conquest [1,9]. Even after that
first violent period, the better social and economical position held by the Europeans continued to favor their mating with indigenous females.
The asymmetric sexual evolution of the mixed population
is also corroborated when quantitative admixture estimates are independently applied to their female and male
genetic pools at different times (Table 3). The Iberian contribution to the male genetic pool increases from 63% in
the 17th–18th centuries to 83% in the present-day population, which is accompanied by a parallel dropping of the
male indigenous (31% vs 17%) and sub-Saharan (6% vs
1%) contributions. However, relative proportions in the
female pool are strikingly constant for Iberians (48% vs
55%) and aborigines (40% vs 42%), from the 17th–18th
centuries to the present [53], and only the sub-Saharan
female contribution shows an important decrease (12%
vs 3%).
These results indicate that indigenous males were negatively discriminated, not only at the beginning of the conquest but also afterwards. In the case of the sub-Saharan
lineages, it seems that their mating disadvantage affected
both sexes, although more so in males.
It has been stated that the Canary Islands served as a laboratory for the later conquest and settlement of the American Continent by the Spaniards [54,55]. In fact, recent
genetic studies on Iberoamerican populations [56-58]
have also detected considerable sexual asymmetry, showing that the European male contribution to their presentday genetic pools is significantly greater than the female,
as happens in the Canary Islands. Ironically, autochthonous male M81 and female U6 lineages from the
Canaries have also been detected in Iberoamerica [57],
demonstrating that Canary Islanders with indigenous
ancestors actively participated in the American colonization.

Methods
Samples
Samples used in this study were excavated by different
authorized archeological teams. The material ceded to
perform molecular analyses consisted, in all cases, of teeth
without fractures. Whenever possible, teeth were directly
taken from their mandible alveolus. A total of 643 teeth
corresponding to 493 different individuals were analyzed.
This material belonged to different indigenous burials
sampled from six of the seven islands: Fuerteventura (13
teeth from 10 individuals), Gran Canaria (230 teeth from
115 individuals), Tenerife (45 teeth from 39 individuals),
Gomera (62 teeth from 52 individuals), Hierro (44 teeth
from 44 individuals) and La Palma (43 teeth from 38
individuals). Calibrated radiocarbon dating was performed in the Beta Analytic Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory (Miami). At least two samples for site were analyzed.
Aboriginal remains were clearly pre-conquest for all the
analyzed islands: Tenerife (2210 ± 60 to 1720 ± 60 BP),
Gomera (1743 ± 40 to 1493 ± 40 BP), Hierro (1740 ± 50
to 970 ± 50 BP) and Gran Canaria (1410 ± 60 to 750 ± 60

BP) [33]. Although the Fuerteventura and La Palma [59]
materials were not directly C-14 dated, ceramic types coexcavated with the remains indicate that they were also
prehispanic and not older than 1000 years BP. Historical
remains, from 17th–18th century, exhumed from La Concepción Church in Tenerife (206 teeth from 195 individuals), were also analyzed. In order to avoid sampling
repetitions, individuals from different graves were preferably chosen, and only one type of tooth was taken when
more than one individual was sampled in the same grave
[25].
Ancient DNA laboratory
To ensure the reliability of the results, strict measures were
taken to avoid contamination, as recommended for aDNA
work [60,61]. Analyses were performed in three independent aDNA-dedicated laboratories. In the first, the
excavated material was decontaminated and processed to
obtain powdered samples. In the second, DNA extraction
and pre-PCR procedures were carried out. PCR amplifications were performed in a third area. Finally, post-PCR
analyses were done in another physically isolated laboratory.

In each aDNA dedicated area, all personnel were required
to wear lab-coats, face-shields, hats and multiple pairs of
gloves. The equipment and work areas were constantly
irradiated with UV lamps and frequently cleaned with
bleach. All sample manipulations were performed in laminar flow cabinets, with dedicated pipettes and sterile filter tips (Tip One, Star Lab). Solutions were commercially
acquired whenever possible; otherwise, they were autoclaved and UV-treated. All metallic material was sterilized
in an oven at 200°C for at least 4 h.
Ancient DNA extraction
Initial decontamination steps were carried out on all samples prior to extraction. Teeth were thoroughly washed
with 15% HCl, rinsed with UV-treated ddH2O and
exposed to UV light for 10 min. In order to reconstruct
teeth after extractions, they were transversely cut through
the mid-line, using a dental electric saw, and the internal
pulp and dentine drilled out using a dental drill. The powder was collected in 1.5 ml sterile tubes and DNA
extracted according to a modified GuSCN-silica based
protocol [24,25,62].
Previous mtDNA and amelogenin analysis
As it there are estimated to be about 3,000 mtDNA molecules per cell [63], previous to the Y-chromosome study
all the teeth were analyzed for mtDNA [24]. Those individuals that could not be amplified for mtDNA (35%)
were not included in subsequent analysis. The successfully
amplified mtDNA samples were sexed using an amelogenin test as previously published [25,33]. For those sam-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/181

ples carrying the Y-chromosome specific band, two
additional amelogenin typings were performed to confirm the result. When only the female band was amplified,
4 to 5 additional repetitions were carried out, in order to
avoid false results due to allelic dropout during the first
few PCR cycles [33]. In the indigenous sample, only 49%
of the individuals were unequivocally sexed and 17%
proved to be male, so 89 teeth from 52 individuals
(14.6%) were analyzed for Y-chromosome binary markers. For the historical sample, 56% of the individuals gave
results for the amelogenin locus and 34% resulted male,
so 67 individuals were included in the Y-chromosome
analysis.
Y-SNP selection
Sixteen biallelic markers (M2, M9, M33, M34, M45, M60,
M78, M81, M89, M96, M170, M172, M173, M201, M267,
M269; see Figure 2), that characterize the most prevalent
lineages in NW Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe,
were chosen from the literature [5,17,34-36,38,40]. The YSNP haplogroup nomenclature and tree topology, represented in Figure 2, were established following the nomenclature of Karafet et al. 2008 [64].

To amplify the Y-SNPs, primers were designed to define
fragments with less than 100 base pairs (bp), as recommended for aDNA studies, using Primer3 software http://
primer3.sourceforge.net[65]. Different sets of primers
were used for: a) direct SNP amplification, b) primerextension preamplificaction (PEP), c) nested-PCR reamplification and d) SNaPshot multiplex SNP typing. Primer
sequences are shown in Additional files 1, 2 &3.
Real-time PCR quantification
To assess the number of molecules used as template for
PCR amplification [66], we used iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (BioRad) in an iCycler Thermal Cycler (BioRad).
Primers and thermal cycling conditions were as described
for Y-SNP amplifications. Tenfold serial dilutions of a
purified and quantified standard were included in the
experiments to determine the standard curve in order to
estimate the initial number of DNA molecules in each
sample.
Primer-Extension Preamplification (PEP)
Primer-extension preamplification of the whole genome
[67] was carried out using DOP PCR Master Mix Kit
(Roche) and following the manufacturer's protocol.
Multiplex preamplification
Multiplex amplification was performed in two different
ways. In the first approach, the thirty-two primers of the
sixteen markers, detailed in Additional file 1, were used in
a PCR multiplex. Subsequently, the sixteen markers were
amplified in three different multiplex assays (Additional

file 1). PCR was performed in 10 μl volume, containing 1
μl of 10× Tris-HCl buffer, 200 μM of each dNTP, 5 mM of
MgCl2, 1.5 ng of bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 unit of
Taq polymerase (Ecogen), the optimal concentration for
each pair of primers (Additional file 1) and 5 μl of DNA
extract. When no amplification product was obtained, the
DNA extract volume was increased to 7 μl in subsequent
PCRs. To overcome PCR inhibition, detectable by the lack
of primer-dimers, DNA was reduced to 3 μl and/or the Taq
and BSA amounts were doubled. Reactions were submitted to 40 amplification cycles with denaturation at 94°C
for 10 s, annealing at 55°C for 10 s and extension at 72°C
for 10 s. Extraction and PCR controls were included to
detect modern DNA contamination. Ancient female DNA
was used as an additional negative control.
Nested-PCR reamplification
Each marker was reamplified using a nested-PCR
approach. In these amplifications, one of the previous
PCR primers was used together with a newly designed
nested-primer (Additional file 2). The PCR was run in 40
μl, containing 4 μl of 10× Tris-HCl buffer, 200 μM of each
dNTP, 40 pmoles of each primer, 5 mM of MgCl2, 3 units
of Taq polymerase (Ecogen) and 8 μl of 1:200 diluted
multiplex PCR product. Reactions were submitted to 40
amplification cycles with denaturation at 94°C for 10 s,
annealing at 55°C for 10 s and extension at 72°C for 10
s. A 5 μl aliquot of the PCR product was loaded in 10%
acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (19:1) gels, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV to assess the amplification yield.
RFLP analysis
0.5–1 unit of the appropriate restriction enzyme (Additional file 2) was used to directly digest 10 μl of the
nested-PCR product under the manufacturers' recommendations. RFLP patterns were resolved on 8% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (19:1) in 1× TBE buffer and stained
with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) for 15 min.
Multiplex SNaPshot analysis
Products of each nested PCR were pooled in 0.5-ml sterile
eppendorf tubes at comparatively optimal amounts, and
ethanol precipitated in order to purify and concentrate the
samples in a 10 μl volume. In order to remove any primers
and dNTPs left by the previous ethanol precipitation, 1 μl
of the concentrated PCR products was treated with 0.5 μl
of Exo-SAP-it (USB) and incubated at 37°C for 15 min,
followed by heating at 85°C for 15 min to inactivate the
enzyme.

The multiplex minisequencing reactions were carried out
in a 5 μl final volume containing 1 μl of SNaPshot™ Multiplex Ready Mix (Applied Biosystem) and 1.5 μl of the
previously treated PCR products. Concentrations of prim-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/181

ers in the reaction mix are specified in Additional file 3.
Reactions were submitted to 25 cycles of denaturation at
96°C for 10 s, annealing at 50°C for 5 s, and extension at
60°C for 30 s. Final extension products were treated with
1 μl of SAP (USB) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, followed
by enzyme inactivation by heating at 85°C for 15 min.
For capillary electrophoresis, 0.5 μl purified extension
products were mixed with 9 μl Hi-Di™ formamide
(Applied Biosystems, (AB)) and 0.5 μl of internal size
standard GeneScan-120 LIZ™ (AB). Samples were run on
an ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer (AB) using POP-7®
(AB). Results were analyzed using GeneMapper 4.0 software (AB).
Cloning and sequencing
To check the specificity of the primers, PCR products of
each marker were ligated into pGEM-T vectors (Promega).
Colonies were plated on selective Amp/IPTG/X-gal plates,
and white colonies were selected. Clones were directly
sequenced using M13 universal primers. Sequencing reactions were prepared in 10 μl volumes using the BigDye 3.1
Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (AB) and the products
were run on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (AB).
Contamination prevention and authentication
To avoid modern contaminant DNA during the mtDNA
and amelogenin analyses, all the previously reported procedures were followed [24,25,33,62]. In addition, for the
Y-chromosome analysis, aDNA was exclusively manipulated by female researchers and all sample analyses were
duplicated, in La Laguna, using RFLP assays and in Porto,
using SNaPshot analysis.
RFLP analysis on modern populations
In order to make comparisons among populations feasible, after concluding the analysis of all the extant aDNA
samples from the Canary Islands [5], samples from the
Iberian peninsula [35] and North Africa [68] were additionally typed for M269 marker as previously described
[69].
Statistical analyses
The indigenous and historical samples were compared
between each other and with each present-day island population, with West Saharan (including Mauritanian samples), NW African (comprising Arabs and Berbers from
Morocco) and North Central African populations (including Algerian and Tunisian samples), and with an overall
sample from the Iberian Peninsula as detailed in Additional file 5. To make comparisons possible, frequencies
were calculated for haplogroups at the same level of SNP
resolution as the indigenous and historical samples. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and pairwise FST
genetic distances based on haplogroup frequencies [70]

were performed using ARLEQUIN 2000 package [71].
Principal component (PC) and multidimensional scaling
(MDS) analyses were carried out using the SPSS statistical
package 11.5 (SPSS, Inc). Admixture analysis, using Ychromosome SNPs (k = 18) as alleles of a single locus, was
performed using ADMIX 2.0 program [72]. Admixture
coefficients and their standard deviations were obtain
from 3000 bootstrap replicates. Contingency and Fisher
exact tests were used to assess the significance of haplogroup frequency differences. To test the significance of
admixture proportions between male and female lineages, we used a significance test of independent proportions [73].

Authors' contributions
The experiments were designed by all the authors. RF and
AMG carried out the RFLP analyses, VG and LG the SNaPshot analyses, while VMC and JML analyzed extant samples for M269. All the authors participated in data
analysis, discussion of results and drafting the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
