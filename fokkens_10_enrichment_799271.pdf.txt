Enrichment of homologs in insignificant BLAST
hits by co-complex network alignment
Like Fokkens1*†, Sandra MC Botelho1,2†, Jos Boekhorst1,3, Berend Snel1

Abstract
Background: Homology is a crucial concept in comparative genomics. The algorithm probably most widely used
for homology detection in comparative genomics, is BLAST. Usually a stringent score cutoff is applied to
distinguish putative homologs from possible false positive hits. As a consequence, some BLAST hits are discarded
that are in fact homologous.
Results: Analogous to the use of the genomics context in genome alignments, we test whether conserved
functional context can be used to select candidate homologs from insignificant BLAST hits. We make a co-complex
network alignment between complex subunits in yeast and human and find that proteins with an insignificant
BLAST hit that are part of homologous complexes, are likely to be homologous themselves. Further analysis of the
distant homologs we recovered using the co-complex network alignment, shows that a large majority of these
distant homologs are in fact ancient paralogs.
Conclusions: Our results show that, even though evolution takes place at the sequence and genome level, cocomplex networks can be used as circumstantial evidence to improve confidence in the homology of distantly
related sequences.

Background
Comparative genomics involves large scale investigations
to identify which parts of different genomes are of common descent in order to predict function or to study
genome evolution. A common first step towards detecting homology between genes or proteins within a genome or between different genomes, is to do a BLAST
search with a set of genes or proteins against a database
and regard each hit with an E-value below a certain cutoff to be homologous [1]. Additionally, several filters
and clustering algorithms can be applied to separate sets
of homologs into orthologous groups (e.g[2,3]). Usually,
a stringent score cutoff is used to ensure that the hits
that are included are indeed homologs. Naturally, homologs whose sequences have diverged strongly, are incorrectly excluded.
On a smaller scale, more sensitive searches based on
profiles of groups of related amino acid sequences

(such as PSI-BLAST or HMMer) or, if available, protein three dimensional structures are commonly used
to avoid False Negatives without losing confidence in
the putative homologs returned [4,5]. In these
searches, instead of using the same scores or probability for each position, a multiple sequence alignment is
used to define position specific substitution scores or
transition probabilities.
Besides improving sequence based homology searches,
one can also use information on the genomic context of
sequences to aid detection of a common descent of
sequences. Genome alignments can be very useful when
there are difficulties in determining homology between
sequences, for example between intergenic regions. Boekhorst and Snel showed that genome alignments can be
used to select candidates from a set of insignificant
BLAST hits in prokaryotes [6]. In eukaryotes, gene order
is less conserved across large phylogenomic distances such
as between fungi and animals and therefore less likely to
make a valuable contribution to the detection of homology
at these large evolutionary distances [7]. As a result, conserved synteny is mainly employed in eukaryotes for the

detection of orthologs, between closely related species, e.g.
within ascomycete fungi or within vertebrates [8,9].
The availability of protein interaction networks allows
for the comparison of genomes and the functional context simultaneously. Information on the functional context of proteins is already used in comparative genomics
of eukaryotes to select from a set of inparalogs, the protein that is functionally similar to the query sequence
(the ‘functional ortholog’) [10-12]. In the comparative
analysis of protein interaction networks, spurious protein
interactions can be separated from biologically relevant
interactions if the protein-protein interaction occurs in
different species. We here test if the reverse is also in
principle applicable: can the network alignment help to
separate spurious homology links from real ones? Analogously to genome alignment, we test the expectation that
the insignificant blast hit between protein a from species
A and protein b from species B is more likely to reflect
homology if protein a is functionally closely related to
proteins which are readily identifiable as orthologous to
proteins in species B that are functionally closely related
to b (Figure 1). To answer this question, we select candidate pairs from BLAST hits between human and yeast
proteins based on conserved functional context, in this
case homologous complexes, and determine whether this
selection contains relatively more homologs than a background of hits with similar BLAST scores.

BLAST hit. If two proteins with an insignificant BLAST hit are
subunits of homologous complexes, are these proteins more likely
to be homologous than would follow from the score returned by
BLAST?

Results and discussion
Are hits with conserved functional context more likely to
be homologous?

We perform an all-against-all BLAST search between
the human and yeast proteomes using a substantially
more inclusive threshold than normally is applied to
allow a comprehensive survey of insignificant BLAST
hits. For each query-hit pair BLAST returns an E-value.
We bin the E-values into 8 bins ranging from [E < =
10-5] to [10 < E < = 100]. We define co-complex networks for human and yeast based on two curated complex datasets per species, and use Inparanoid clusters
between human and yeast to align these networks (Figure 1 and Methods) [2,13-15]. If the query and the hit
contain a domain which belongs to the same Pfam clan,
we consider them to be True Positives. For each of our
8 bins, we calculate the fraction of query-hit pairs
which are True Positives, with and without co-complex
network alignment.
We find that the use of co-complex information
results in a considerable increase in the fraction of true
homologs among the returned hits, compared to BLAST
without co-complex information (Figure 2). This difference is most eminent in bins representing E-values normally considered to be insignificant (the ‘gray-zone’). At
E-values between 1 and 10 almost 90% of the returned
hits share a Pfam clan, which means a substantial, 8 fold
increase in the percentage of True Positives. This is not
due to a bias resulting from being a member of the cocomplex network or being in a conserved region of the
co-complex network, as only after alignment of the cocomplex network we see a big improvement in the fraction of True Positives (Figure 2).
Only a small subset of yeast and human proteins
(~12% of human and ~26% of yeast proteins) is part of
a co-complex network within each species. Moreover,
many of those are not functionally linked to proteins
that have readily identifiable orthologs in the other species. As a consequence, this method is applicable to
only a small fraction of query-hit pairs (Table 1). If we
include high-throughput co-complex datasets for yeast
and human, the coverage is increased a little at a cost of
a slightly inferior performance (see Additional file 1).
We show that alignment of co-complex networks can
facilitate the identification of true homologs among gray
zone BLAST hits. In a simple and completely automated
procedure, we obtain a subset of hits which, despite very
high E-values, is substantially enriched for homologs.
This allows us to infer homology for pairs with co-complex network alignment with an E-value ranging
between 0.1 and 1 with the similar confidence as for
pairs before co-complex network alignment and an
E-value of 0.01 (Figure 2). Our framework would likely

Inparanoid cluster) (’BLAST+network alignment’, green line).

be improved if we could use statistics on (locally) missing connections in both co-complex networks. To date,
protein complex datasets are too fragmentary to make
any sensible estimates of the number of missing
connections.
Detection of missing complex subunits

Previous large scale investigations towards presence and
absence of protein complex subunits in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes reveal that most complexes are only partially
present in other species [16-18]. In these studies, an
orthology definition based on BLAST is used to determine presence and absence of subunits in different species and part of the subunits regarded absent may be
missing due to detection problems. Hence the disrupted
co-evolution of protein complexes might partly be an
artefact.

The use of co-complex information is potentially useful in the detection of yeast homologs of subunits of
human protein complexes. Especially as the most important disadvantage, the lack of coverage of the co-complex networks, is less urgent because the queries are
subunits and hence are all part of the human co-complex network. We take the opportunity to test the
applicability of our method to a problem in comparative
genomics and assess the added value of co-complex network alignment in detecting homologs in yeast for subunits of human complexes. For the complexes in the
CORUM dataset, we initially find homologs for complex
components by running a BLAST search with all subunits against the yeast proteome, applying a commonly
used E-value cutoff of 0.001. Then, for the subunits we
did not find homologs for, we use a less stringent Evalue cutoff of 1, in combination with co-complex

network alignment, to see how many additional subunits
we pick up.
Using BLAST only with an E-value cutoff of 0.001, we
find yeast homologs for 1199 out of 1901 (63.07%) subunits. We find that 172 out of 710 complexes (24.23%)
have a homolog in yeast for all subunits, 427 (60.14%)
have homologs for some subunits and 111 (15.63%)
complexes are completely absent. Even when only comparing two species, we find that for most human complexes, only part of all subunits have a homolog in
yeast. However, as we have argued before, some subunits may be called absent due to detection problems.
For the 702 subunits for which we detected no homolog in yeast, we select, using the co-complex network
alignment, candidate homologs in yeast for 52 additional
subunits, belonging to 62 complexes (some subunits are
part of multiple complexes). Using Pfam, CDD and PSIBLAST, we confirm that the 49 out of 52 candidates
recovered with co-complex network alignment are in
fact homologous. With the 49 confirmed homologs we
retrieved, an additional 19 complexes are completely
present in yeast (see Additional file 2).
One striking observation when comparing individual
complexes in human to complexes in yeast, is that there
is very little congruence between human and yeast complex definitions (see Additional file 3). Factors such as
the incompleteness of data in both species, individual
decisions on what does belong to a complex and what

Page 4 of 9

does not, and proteins belonging to multiple complexes,
obscure a one-to-one relation between yeast and human
complexes, assuming such a correspondence exists.
Fortunately, because we align human and yeast complexes on a network level rather than as individual complexes, we are able to retrieve homologs with the cocomplex network alignment for complexes which do not
exist as such in yeast. A good example is the Multisynthetase complex (Figure 3). This complex is composed of 8 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and 3 auxiliary
proteins. The individual tRNA synthetases all have a
homolog in yeast found with the initial straightforward
BLAST search. The yeast homologs of the tRNA sythetases are not known to be organized in a complex, with
one important exception: methionyl and glutamyl
synthetases MES1 and GUS1 associate into a complex
with ARC1, an auxiliary protein (and homolog of the
human auxiliary protein p43, SCYE1) which increases
catalytic efficiency and ensures correct localization into
the cytoplasm. Via this complex, human JTV1, a scaffold
required for the assembly and stability of the multitRNA synthetase complex, is linked to a short N-terminal stretch of yeast GUS1, whose C-term is unambiguously homologous to the glutaminyl synthetase in
human, QARS (3). When we do a PSI-BLAST with
human JTV1 as a query protein, we retrieve GUS1,
aligned to the GST_C domain in JTV1 (E-value 1e-05)
after three iterations.

proteins which are together in an Inparanoid cluster, green dashed lines indicate a significant BLAST hit between the two proteins linked, gray

We recovered a homolog for another subunit of the
Multisynthetase complex via an unrelated complex: the
Ribosome. Human EEF1E1 has a hit with yeast EFB1
with an E-value of 0.015. EFB1 is located at the ribosome, as is YHR020W, which is the readily identifiable
yeast ortholog of the human bifunctional glutamyl-prolyl
tRNA synthetase EPRS. Both EFB1 and EEF1E1 are
translation elongation factors (EEF1E is a translation
elongation factor 1 epsilon and EFB1 a translation elongation factor 1 beta) and both contain a domain which
belongs to the GST_C_superfamily. The HSP lies in the
regions where the GST_C_superfamily domain lies in
both proteins and these regions in the protein sequences
are, albeit very distantly, evolutionary related. EFB1 has
a much more similar homolog in human (namely
EEF1B2, BLAST E-value 1e-33), suggesting that EEF1E1
and EFB are related through a very old duplication
event and the translation elongation factor 1 epsilon
EEF1E1 ortholog is lost in yeast.
Applying the co-complex network alignment to the set
of protein complex subunits in CORUM, we select candidate homologs in yeast for 52 proteins, out of which
we could confirm homology with Pfam, CDD or PSIBLAST for 49 pairs. The observation reported in both
large and small scale investigations [16-20], that most
complexes are ‘incomplete’ in many species, remains
unchallenged because we can only show for a few complexes that their incompleteness is a result of an undetected homology
Are the recovered distant homologs orthologs?

Exploiting the co-complex network alignment we find
yeast homologs for 52 subunits of human complexes
that are not revealed by standard BLAST. This is markedly less than the 405 human queries for which co-complex information is applicable (Table 1). The likely
crucial difference between our initial survey of all
BLAST hit pairs and the detection of missing complex
subunits is the fact that in the latter, we applied the cocomplex alignment only to those query proteins for
which we could not find a homolog with BLAST alone.
Therefore we expect that many query proteins for which
we recover a distant homolog with the co-complex network alignment in the initial survey, have an additional,
significant hit in yeast and are therefore not used as a
query when looking for additional homologs for complex subunits. Indeed, we find that this is the case for
no less than 85% (347 out of 405) of the query-hit pairs
with an E-value > 0.01.
There are a few possible evolutionary histories that can
explain the fact that for a certain query protein in
human, we find a close homolog and a distant homolog
with conserved functional context in yeast. First of all,
distant homologs recovered by co-complex network

alignment could be ancient paralogs (outparalogs with
respect to branching of fungi and metazoa), in which the
high degree of divergence is due to time rather than
rapid sequence evolution (Figure 4a). For instance,
EEF1E1 and EFB1 in the Multisynthetase example discussed above are ancient paralogs. Another possibility is
a more recent duplication in yeast followed by asymmetric divergence in the duplicates, in which case the
divergence is caused by accelerated evolution on one
branch (Figure 4b)[12,21]. Finally, the two yeast hits may
be homologous to different regions of the query protein
due to fusion, fission or domain recombination events
(Figure 4c), in which one domain/region has a markedly
higher rate of sequence evolution than the other.
In the fusion/fission/domain recombination scenario,
the two yeast hits of the human query protein in yeast
are not homologous. For 29 of our 347 trios the two
yeast hits are not a significant hit in BLAST, neither do
they share a homologous domain according to Pfam.
For 27 of these trios the best scoring BLAST HSP of the
two yeast proteins is in a different region in the human
protein. In the remaining two pairs, the distant homologs that we retrieve share only a short KOW motif
with the query protein, while the best hit shares both
the KOW motif (not recognized by Pfam, but part of
the HSP) and also the adjacent Ribosomal L27e domain.
If we consider only those 318 trios of proteins in which
the two yeast proteins are homologous according to
Pfam, we find that in 307 of them, the distant homolog
has a significant hit in human, suggesting it is in fact an
ancient paralog (Figure 4a). A recent study towards the
fate of duplicated protein complex subunits showed that
31% of duplicates resides in different complexes, 31%
stayed in the same complex and in 38% of the cases one
of the duplicates is not known to be part of any complex
[22]. We investigate the fate of the 307 yeast pairs that
are outparalogs according to our analysis. The yeast pairs
are not a random sample of ancient yeast duplicates, on
the contrary. Because one of the yeast paralogs is a close
homolog of a human protein which is part of a complex
which is homologous to the complex the other yeast
paralog is part of, we expect a bias towards duplicates
remaining in the same complex.
We find that for 139 pairs (45.3%), both duplicates are
in the same complex, for 25 pairs (8.14%) the duplicates
are in overlapping complexes (sharing more than half of
their subunits), for 108 pairs (35.2%) they are in a different complexes and for 35 pairs one of the duplicates (the
one most closely related to the human query protein) is
not known to be part of any complex in yeast. We expect
that the human homologs of the 108 pairs in which the
yeast ancient duplicates belong to distinct complexes, are
more often part of multiple complexes, indicating that
the yeast duplicates subfunctionalized. We do observe a

paralogs rather than orthologs. Duplications in general
are very important in the evolution of protein complexes
[22,23] and many structures are known to consist of
subunits resulting from very old duplications (e.g. the
proteasome). We find that in most cases both duplicates
are part of the same or overlapping complexes. This
suggests that the duplicates we detect have sub- or neofunctionalized within one complex, although some
might be the result of outparalogs that have been independently recruited to a biological process.

Figure 4 Evolutionary histories that explain why for a query
protein in human, we find both a close and a distant homolog
in yeast. Some proteins for which we recover a distant homolog in
yeast with our method, in fact have a better hit (a closer homolog)
in yeast. The three scenario’s depicted here could have this effect.
We test which scenario occurs more often by looking whether the
distant homolog in yeast (Yeast2 in this Figure) have a closer
homolog in human than Human1. Red square: gene duplication

significant overrepresentation of proteins that are part of
multiple complexes in ancient paralogs when compared
to all subunits in the CORUM complex dataset (P =
0.007), but not in ancient paralogs which are part of the
same complex when compared to those which have
ended up in distinct complexes (P = 0.58).
The lion’s share of distant homologs we recover using
the co-complex network alignment consists of ancient

Conclusions
We test whether contextual information from the functional network, in this case conserved co-complex relations, can aid homology detection. Functional context
information has been used before to help in choosing
functional orthologs from a set of inparalogs, but to our
best knowledge, this is the first time functional networks
are used to aid distant homology detection. Using an
aligned co-complex network, we can identify a subset
highly enriched for homologs of BLAST hits with an Evalue which would normally be regarded as insignificant.
This shows that, even though evolution takes place at
the sequence level, one can use co-complex networks as
circumstantial evidence to improve confidence in the
homology of distantly related sequences.
The interspecies co-complex network includes only a
small fraction of all proteins, which impedes applicability. As more high-throughput datasets become available
in more species, we expect that the proof of principle
we established here, can be applied and tested on a larger scale, between more distantly related species and
with other types of functional relations. We apply our
co-complex network alignment to a dataset of human
complexes in order to determine how many homologous
subunits we can detect that we missed in an initial
BLAST search. We thereby recovered homologs for only
a few additional subunits, despite the fact that coverage
is less a limiting factor in this context. We find that one
reason we retrieve less additional subunits than
expected, is that with the co-complex alignment, we
mainly detect outparalogs rather than orthologs.
It has been shown that subunits of a protein complex
diverge at similar rates, presumably because subunits of
a protein complex are functionally strongly interdependent and subject to very similar evolutionary constraints
[24]. In contrast, the co-complex network alignment
method is based on the fact that some subunits diverged
between human and yeast to such an extent that they
are not picked up in a regular BLAST search and other
subunits are conserved such that the human and yeast
orthologs are still detected by Inparanoid. In this light it
is not surprising that most homologs we recover with
our method are ancient paralogs rather than orthologs:

Fokkens et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:86
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/86

the difference in the extent of divergence is due to difference in time, as opposed to difference in evolutionary
rates between subunits of the same protein complex.
Researchers studying the evolution of individual protein complexes have used functional information to find
diverged homologs successfully despite absence of proof
from a large scale study [25,26]. Our results provide this
proof. Numerous predictions made in these small scale
studies were subsequently confirmed by profile vs profile
alignments or the comparison of protein three dimensional structures upon availability. Interestingly, many of
these predictions represent initial BLAST hits with Evalues even higher than 100 (the cutoff used in this
study). Hence it is possible that in our study still many
homologs have gone undetected, and the formal integration of functional context with more sensitive homology
detection methods might help in the development of
automatic bioinformatic methods to uncover these distant homologs and improve our insights into the ancient
evolution of the protein interaction network.

Methods
Co-complex network

To construct a human co-complex network, we download the set of CORUM Core complexes from http://
mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/corum and stored the complexes as sets of co-complex pairs [15]. We added
‘direct complex’ pairs downloaded from Reactome
http://www.reactome.org/download/current/homo_sapiens.interactions.txt.gz[13], which, in combination
with pairs from the CORUM dataset, results in a cocomplex network containing 32415 unique pairs in
total. For the yeast co-complex network, we stored
MIPS complexes from ftp://ftpmips.gsf.de/yeast/catalogues/complexcat as binary co-complex relationships
[14] and complexes from SGD GO cellular component
annotation [27] as in [22]. This resulted in 20075
unique pairs in total.
BLAST and Pfam

We downloaded 46704 human protein sequences from
Ensembl [28], (Homo_sapiens.NCBI36.50.pep.all.fa)
and yeast protein sequences from the Saccheromyces
Genome Database (orf_trans_all.fasta) in July 2008. We
run BLAST between human and yeast with the maximum returned E-value set to 100, maximum number
of hits and alignments set such there it is no limiting
factor [1]. We did not adjust the database size. If two
proteins have multiple HSPs (regions aligned by
BLAST), we keep only the HSP (High Scoring Sequence
Pair) with the lowest E-value. We downloaded Pfam
HMMs (version 23, July 2008) and data on homologous Pfam families (Pfam clans) from the Pfam website

Page 7 of 9

ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam, searched for
domains in human and yeast proteins using hmmpfam
in the HMMer package [29] with default cutoffs.
For each BLAST hit, for both the human query protein and the yeast hit, we determine the overlap between
the HSP and each Pfam domain and divide the number
of amino acids in the overlap with the length of the
shortest region (either Pfam domain or HSP) to get a
percentage of overlap. If a query and a hit have a Pfam
domain that belongs to the same clan and the overlap
of the domain and the HSP is greater than 50%, we call
this BLAST hit a True Positive. BLAST hits for which
this overlap is less than or equal to 50% in either the
human query or the yeast target protein are ignored as
the gold standard for homology (Pfam clans) can’t be
fully applied to these proteins.
Co-complex network alignment

To align the co-complex networks of yeast and human
we look for yeast orthologs for all proteins in the human
co-complex network using Inparanoid. We run Inparanoid 3.0 with default parameters, so for each bidirectional
best hit which forms a seed pair for an Inparanoid cluster, it is required that the minimum BLAST bitscore is 50
and the overlap of the alignment relative to the shortest
of the two proteins is at least 50% [2].
For each BLAST query-hit pair, if the human query
protein has at least one direct neighbour in the human
co-complex network that is orthologous (in one Inparanoid cluster) to the direct neighbour of the yeast hot
protein in the yeast co-complex network (Figure 1), we
assign this pair to the ‘co-complex network alignment’
category (Figure 2). We bin E-values in 8 bins ranging
from [E < = 10-5] to [10 < E < = 100] and calculate for
each bin the percentage of True Positives (hits that each
have a Pfam domain belonging to the same clan), also
known as the Positive Predictive Value. Each bin contains at least 60 pairs and at least 50 query proteins
(Table 1). Normalizing for family size gives similar
results (see Additional file 4).
Detection of missing complex subunits

To avoid biases due to overlapping complexes as much
as possible, we removed 803 complexes which are a subcomplex of another complex from the set of CORUM
Core complexes. If we remove all supercomplexes
instead of all subcomplexes, we get qualitatively the
same results. We first attempt to find a yeast homolog
with BLAST and an E-value cutoff of 0.001 for all subunits. Subsequently, on those subunits we did not find a
homolog for, we applied the co-complex network alignment with an adjusted E-value of 1 (expected percentage
of False Positives < 3% (Figure 2)).
