Abstract
Background: POU5F1 expression is required to maintain stem cell pluripotency and for
primordial germ cells to retain proliferative capability in embryonic development. Recent evidence
suggests that POU5F1 may also be a testicular germ cell carcinoma (TGCC) oncogene, and POU5F1
variation may influence TGCC risk. As an important first step to a genetic association study, we
sought to identify all common sequence variants in an 11.3 kb region containing POU5F1, and to
describe the linkage disequilibrium patterns, using DNA from individuals of African-descent (AD)
and European-descent (ED).
Results: A higher number of polymorphisms was observed in the AD (n = 102) versus ED (n =
82) population. Among the 41 observed haplotypes, 21 (51%) and 12 (29%) were unique to the AD
and ED populations, respectively, while 8 (20%) were observed in both. The number of tagging
polymorphisms necessary to explain at least 80% of common variation (minor allele frequency ≥
0.10) due to the remaining untyped polymorphisms was 17 for an AD and 10 for an ED population,
providing a 4.0- and 7.0-fold gain in genotyping efficiency for characterizing nucleotide variation,
respectively.
Conclusion: POU5F1 is highly polymorphic, however a smaller subset of polymorphisms can tag
the observed genetic variation with little loss of information.

Background
Mammalian totipotent cells, including the zygote and first
few cells of its cleavage, have two important characteristics, i. they are able to maintain a high rate of karyotypic
normal cell division, and ii. they can differentiate into
every cell and tissue type throughout the organism.
POU5F1 is a member of the POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) domain

transcription factor family that activates expression of target genes by binding to octameric consensus sequences
[1]. POU5F1 is highly expressed in these totipotent cells
but is down regulated during gastrulation and in the cells
that comprise the trilaminar embryo, with the exception
of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and the primordial germ cells [2]. POU5F1 is associated with stem cell

pluripotency in a somewhat quantitative manner, with
less than normal levels driving cells to differentiation [3].
Methylation of regulatory sequences appears to be a principal mechanism through which POU5F1 expression is
shut-down in non-germ cell embryonic tissue; primordial
germ cells have mechanisms (as yet undefined) that prevent POU5F1 methylation.
There is growing evidence that POU5F1 may be important
in testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC). POU5F1 is highly
expressed in nearly all adult seminomas, embryonal cell
carcinomas, and testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS), but
not childhood TGCC or spermatocytic carcinomas, or
non-germ cell testicular cancers [4,5]. Gidekel et al. found
that the induction of teratomas in mice, and anchorageindependent growth of NIH3T3 cells (a characteristic of
cells transformed by known oncogenes, such as RAS),
were both related to POU5F1 expression in a positive
dose-response fashion; [2,6] this feature is reminiscent of
the quantitative relationship between expression and
pluripotency maintenance [3]. Notably, the efficiency of
the POU5F1 effect on NIH3T3 cells was comparable to
that of the RAS oncogene in the same experimental setting. Additionally, the POU5F1 binding domain was
essential for this phenotype [6] Thus, POU5F1 appears
likely to be a TGCC oncogene.
The gene encoding POU5F1 (POU5F1) is located on chromosome 6, approximately 130 kbs telomeric of the HLAC locus and 0.6 kb centromeric of the TCF19 locus.
POU5F1 encodes two isoforms, isoform 1 (also known as
OCT-3A) and isoform 2 (also known as OCT-3B), which
share 225 of their COOH-termini amino acids, differing
only in their first exon [7]. One hundred and eight polymorphisms have been reported to the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SNP Database (as of
November 13, 2006) [8] mapping to the POU5F1 region,
however, less than half of these have been validated by
multiple independent submissions or were found on
more than one chromosome. The International HapMap
Project, data release 21, phase II [9] has also genotyped
several polymorphisms in the POU5F1 region in individuals from various populations, however, we do not know
to what extent these data represent the complete genetic
variation of the region. Given the important role of
POU5F1 in stem cell pluripotency, inherited variation in
POU5F1 conceivably could contribute to the risk of TGCC
and other complex phenotypes connected to stem cell
pluripotency, however, to date there have been no efforts
made to systematically re-sequence the entire gene region
to identify all common polymorphisms and describe their
linkage disequilibrium patterns.
We conducted this study to fill in several gaps in previous
knowledge concerning the genetic structure of POU5F1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/9/15

We have re-sequenced the region surrounding POU5F1
and identified all common polymorphic sites in a sample
of individuals of African- and European-decent, compared our findings to what has been reported previously
in the NCBI SNP Database, mapped polymorphic sites to
evolutionarily conserved regions, statistically inferred
gene-wide haplotypes, and identified tagging polymorphisms and compared them to results based on the International HapMap Project. This information will be useful
for future genetic association studies of POU5F1 and
TGCC or other relevant phenoytpes.

Results
Polymorphism identification
We identified 106 polymorphic loci in POU5F1 (Table 1).
In the following text, these loci are named according to
the number of bases from the first transcription start site,
with the major allele preceding the minor allele (major
allele > minor allele). Twenty-four of these loci were polymorphic in the AD population and monomorphic in the
ED population, and only four loci were polymorphic in
the ED population and monomorphic in the AD population. Sixty-seven percent of the AD polymorphic/ED monomorphic sites had a minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.10,
whereas this was observed in only 50% of the AD monomorphic/ED polymorphic sites. Ninety-three polymorphisms (88%) were diallelic single nucleotide
substitutions (SNPs) and 13 (12%) were insertion or deletion polymorphisms (indels). Most polymorphisms were
located in the introns and flanking regions (Figure 1). Polymorphisms were found on an average of 1 in 103 base
pairs (bp) in the AD population and 1 in 127 bp in the ED
population, and a higher number of polymorphisms were
observed in the AD (n = 102) versus ED (n = 82) population. No polymorphism deviated significantly (alpha <
0.05) from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Seven polymorphisms were located in coding regions, however, only one
was a non-synonymous SNP (4466 T > G, rs3130932).
This SNP codes for a methionine to arginine amino acid
substitution in the start codon of isoform 2 of POU5F1,
and had a MAF of 0.23 in the AD population and 0.33 in
the ED population. Within the re-sequenced region,
excluding the two unscanned intronic segments, the NCBI
SNP Database contained records for 108 polymorphisms.
We verified 68 of these previously reported polymorphisms, failed to verify 40 polymorphisms, and identified
38 novel polymorphisms.
Comparative genomics
There were 20 highly conserved elements among vertebrates identified in the re-sequenced region, with logodds scores ranging from 211 to 555 (Figure 1B.). Nine
polymorphisms were located in conserved regions in the
exons (67%) or 5' gene regions (33%): -2482 C > T
(rs17197241), -1611 G > A (rs3132520), -75 G > A

that contains a mix of haplotypes from AD and ED individuals (Figure 2). Although several clades have mixed AD
and ED haplotypes, often the nearest neighboring haplotypes are from the same population.

Linkage structure
Both populations displayed high haplotype diversity. In
total, there were 41 haplotypes inferred among the 94
chromosomes, or 47 individuals, represented. Twentyone (51%) of the haplotypes were unique to the AD population, 12 (29%) were unique to the ED population, and
8 (20%) of the haplotypes were shared across both populations (Table 2). A majority of the haplotypes carried
exclusively in either the AD or ED populations were only
observed once, 76% and 50%, respectively; the majority
(75%) of haplotypes carried in both populations had a
frequency ≥ 0.05. Three of the most common haplotypes
accounted for 28% of all haplotypes. The non-synonymous SNP in the start codon of POU5F1 isoform 2 was
carried in 18 haplotypes. Analysis of the recombination
rates revealed a potential recombination hotspot in the
ED population in intron 1 between loci -1755 T > G and 1694 G > T. Recombination between these two loci
exceeded the background rate of recombination by a factor of 11 (data not shown).

In the AD population there were 68 polymorphisms with
a MAF ≥ 0.10. With an r2 threshold of 0.80, these polymorphisms can be grouped into 17 clusters (9 of which
are singles) which can be tagged by an equal number of
tagging polymorphisms (Figure 3). In the ED population,
among the 70 polymorphisms with a MAF ≥ 0.10, 10 tagging polymorphisms can be selected to capture the clusters of correlated polymorphisms, of which 2 are
singletons. For a combined population of AD and ED
individuals, 24 tagging polymorphisms can tag the clusters of correlated loci, due to overlap in the correlation
patterns between the AD and ED populations.

The phylogenetic analysis of POU5F1 haplotypes shows
that the earliest division of the haplotype tree into two
large clades differentiate between one clade that mainly
consists of haplotypes from AD individuals, and another

The International HapMap Project genotyped 36 POU5F1
loci that were polymorphic in samples from either the
population of European-decent (CEU) or Yoruban-decent
from Nigeria (YRI), or both. With an r2 threshold of 0.80,
HapMap POU5F1 polymorphisms with a MAF ≥ 0.10 can
be clustered into 9 groups in the CEU population and 12
groups in the YRI population.

Discussion
POU5F1 has a critical role in regulating pluripotency in
embryonic development [1-3,10-12]. In non-diseased tissue and tissue from non-germ cell tumors, POU5F1
expression is virtually undetectable [4,5,7,13]. However,
the observation that POU5F1 is expressed in TGCC [1416], and may be somatically mutated in other cancers
[17], suggests that genetic variation in POU5F1 could conceivably alter protein expression or activity, thereby influencing risk of TGCC. In this paper, we have identified the
presence of 38 new polymorphisms, and verified the presence of 68 previously reported polymorphisms, in the
African-descent and European-decent populations in the
gene region encompassing POU5F1. A majority of the 40
polymorphisms contained in the NCBI SNP database that

Phylogenic tree of the 41 observed POU5F1 haplotypes. The tree was created using the neighbor-joining method in
MEGA (version 3.1). The branch line length is proportional to the number of nucleotide differences between haplotypes from
the root. The polymorphisms in each haplotype are ordered from 5' to 3', in the same order as the polymorphisms listed in
Table 2, and the first site in each triplet is listed as the column heading. The (.) indicates that the allele is the same as the first
haplotype in the tree. The (-) indicates a deletion, and the (+) indicated an insertion. Haplotypes unique to the African-descent
population are indicated by the white triangles, those unique to the European-descent population are indicated by white
squares, and those observed in both populations are indicated by black circles.

we did not detect were those associated with a low level of
internal validation (i.e. single submission or mutation on
a single chromosome), and thus most likely represent
genotyping errors or somatic mutations. Our observation
that the AD population was more polymorphic compared
to the ED population is consistent with prior reports [18],
however the observed SNP density (1 in 103 bp in the AD
population and 1 in 127 bp in the ED population) of
POU5F1 is higher than most genes [19-21].
We analyzed linkage disequilibrium patterns in POU5F1,
and identified clusters of correlated polymorphisms. The
NCBI SNP Database contains records for at least one possible tagging polymorphism for all but three of the 17 AD
clusters (A15–A17, Figure 3), and for all 10 ED clusters.
The HapMap Project genotyped approximately 1/3 the
number of polymorphisms as we identified in our resequencing of the POU5F1 region in populations with
similar ancestry. They also observed a lower number of
unique clusters of correlate polymorphisms, which suggests a less-than-complete coverage of POU5F1 LD patterns by the HapMap Project. Furthermore, our AD
population is an admixed population and likely exhibits

a more complex pattern of LD compared to the YRI HapMap population.
Within groups of correlated polymorphisms, selecting
tagging polymorphisms should not only consider the
level of correlation with other polymorphisms, but also
the extent to which a particular SNP may have functional
consequences. Several polymorphisms identified in
POU5F1 make them potentially interesting candidate polymorphisms. For example, we confirmed the existence of
a common SNP at position 4466 T > G (rs3130932) that
produces a non-synonymous change in the initiating
methionine (ATG → AGG) of POU5F1 isoform 2 [7]. Carriers of this variant cannot express POU5F1 isoform 2.
Alternative mRNA splicing is a process that is signaled by
the recognition of specific nucleotide sequences on either
the proximal or distal end of the splice junction, and
results in structural and functional diversity in proteins.
Few data exist on expression of the different POU5F1 isoforms in germ cells or germ cell tumor tissue, since most
expression studies to date have not discriminated between
the two isoforms. In human preimplantation embryos,
however, the two isoforms displayed temporal and spatial

differences in expression [22]. While isoform 1 is
expressed in the nucleus of compacted embryos and blastocysts, isoform 2 expression was only weakly detected in
the periphery, or cytoplasm, of zygotes suggesting that the
isoform 2 may have other functions beyond transcription
activation
[22].
Other potentially interesting regions of the gene are evolutionarily conserved elements. POU5F1 expression is
thought to be driven by a promoter lacking a typical TATA
box, and having at least one distal and one proximal
enhancer that are maintained in conserved regions [23].
Within this promoter region, there are four regions of
homology between species with 66% to 94% conservation of bases [24]. We observed 3 SNPs mapping to these
conserved regions, -2482 C > T, -1892 C > T, and -75 G >
A with minor allele frequencies of 0.08, 0.02, and 0.15 in
the AD population and no nucleotide variation in the ED
population. If the presence of these variant alleles disrupts
binding of regulatory elements, and therefore reduces
POU5F1 expression, these variants may help to explain
part of the lower risk of TGCC observed in the AD population [25].
One limitation of our study is that our population was too
small to identify rare polymorphisms reliably. However,
by studying 46 ED chromosomes and 48 AD chromosomes, we have 90% power to detect polymorphisms with
a minor allele frequency of at least 0.05 in each population [26]. Thus, we have excellent power to detect common variation, which is generally the most useful for
typical genetic association studies that involve hundreds,
as opposed to thousands, of cases. However, we did not
scan two intronic segments, totaling 1 kilobase pairs
(kbs), for genetic variants. NCBI contains records for 24
polymorphisms mapping to these intronic regions, so it is
possible that we have missed some common variants that
existed in our study population in these regions, and also
that these variants tag unique patterns of variation that we
did not identify. A second limitation is that we only studied two populations, and our observed variation and linkage disequilibrium patterns may not extend to individuals
in other populations, for example Asians. The HapMap
Project, which includes Japanese, Chinese, African, and
CEPH samples, shows that allele frequencies and linkage
disequilibrium patterns for POU5F1 polymorphisms vary
between populations, indicating that future resequencing
projects in other population may be needed.
Further studies are also needed to evaluate the functional
relevance of these polymorphisms, as well as investigations into whether these polymorphisms impact TGCC
risk or other phenotypes related to stem cell pluripotency.

Conclusion
This paper provides the first comprehensive report of
sequence variation in an 11.3 kbs region containing
POU5F1. We identified 106 polymorphisms, 36% of
which have not previously been reported. Several polymorphisms were identified in conserved regions, including a non-synonymous polymorphism occurring in onequarter and one-third of the AD and ED populations,
respectively, that causes a methionine to arginine amino
acid substitution in an alternative start codon of POU5F1.
Linkage disequilibrium patterns differed by population,
however, a much smaller subset of polymorphisms may
be used to tag the observed common genetic variation in
either population with little loss of information, amounting to a 4.0- and 7.0-fold gain in efficiency in the AD and
ED populations, respectively.

Methods
Samples
Twenty-four samples from unrelated individuals of African-descent (AD) and 23 Centre d'Etude de Polymorphism Humain (CEPH) samples from unrelated
individuals of European-descent (ED), were obtained
from the Coriell Repository (Camden, New Jersey, USA)
and used for gene re-sequencing (sample identification

Gene re-sequencing
Approximately 11.3 kpb of DNA containing the POU5F1
gene (3.0 kbp 5' of the gene, 6.0 kbp of the gene, and 2.3
kbp 3' of the gene) were amplified and scanned for variation using high-throughput methods. Primers were
designed for 25 amplicons of approximately 600 bp each
covering all exons, flanking regions, and most intronic
regions (Table 3). To ensure that POU5F1 was targeted
specifically, and not a pseudogene, extra care was taken to
design primers and amplicons using Agencourt's proprietary modeling software. During the modeling stage, an in
silico ePCR check was done on each amplicon to verify
that each amplicon only had one ePCR hit. A positive
ePCR hit is defined as having the forward and reverse
primers match the genomic sequence exactly without a
single mismatch. Two segments of the first intron totaling
approximately 1 kb were not scanned. Universal forward

specific amplification. PCR products were purified utilizing Agencourt's solid phase reversible immobilization
reagent, AMPure. Bi-directional (forward and reverse)

fluorescence peak, but ignores regions of poor sequence
quality, such as the ends of amplicons, to reduce the
number of miscalled sites. In addition to using PolyPhred,
all sequences were visually inspected in Consed [30] by a
data analyst for confirmation. The polymorphisms were
named according to distance in bases from the first translational start, according to our reference sequence [See
Additional file 1], 3,055 bases downstream of our resequencing start site.

Analysis
Polymorphism identification
Chromatograms of fluorescence-based sequences were
compared across all samples to identify polymorphic loci
and to determine which individuals were heterozygous or
homozygous for the common or variant alleles using
PolyPhred [27]. PolyPhred uses the base calls and peak
information provided by Phred [28,29] and the sequence
alignments provided by Phrap. PolyPhred detects a heterozygous locus by a significant drop in the height of a fluorescence peak along with the presence of a second

Comparative genomics
We analyzed the polymorphism data using the University
of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser
human assembly from March 2006 [31] to identify the
location of SNPs in relation to conserved elements within
and flanking POU5F1. We used the 'most conserved' track
setting which shows predictions of conserved regions
using sequences from 17 vertebrates produced by PhastCons software [32]. PhastCons uses a phylogenetic hidden Markov model and a maximum-likelihood approach
to produce conservation scores for each nucleotide of the

We accessed the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) SNP Database on November 13, 2006 [8],
and compared the polymorphisms identified from our resequencing to those contained in the database.

alignment, which can be interpreted as the probability
that the nucleotide is in a conserved element. Each predicted conserved element was assigned a log-odds score
indicating how much more likely it is under the conserved
phylogenetic model than the nonconserved model.
Linkage structure
Haplotypes were inferred separately for the AD and ED
populations using PHASE (version 2.1) software, which
uses a Bayesian statistical method [33]. Posterior recombination parameters, obtained from the general model for
varying recombination rate in PHASE, were used to determine the presence and location of any potential recombination hotspots defined by a substantial difference in
recombination between two neighboring loci and the
background recombination rate [34]. Ancestral relationships between inferred haplotypes from both populations
were examined using MEGA (version 3.1) software [35],
using the neighbor-joining method [36]. The square of
Pearson's correlation coefficient (r2) for pairwise comparisons of biallelic polymorphisms was used to determine
the extent to which polymorphic loci provide redundant
genotype information. Groups of correlated polymorphisms were identified through a binning algorithm using
a threshold value of r2 ≥ 0.80 between one polymorphism
and a maximum number of other polymorphisms, separately for the AD and ED populations, using the LDSelect
version 1.0 program [37]. LDSelect also identifies desirable tagging polymorphisms for each group of polymorphisms based on the r2 statistic between polymorphisms
within a group. In addition, the combined population of
AD and ED individuals was analyzed using the multiPopTagSelect version 1.1 program, which identifies the
smallest number of maximally informative tagging polymorphisms to capture correlation patterns in both populations [38].

Within the region we resequenced, the International HapMap Project, data release 21, phase II, [9] has genotyped
31 polymorphisms in several populations (including 90
Caucasian individuals from Utah, USA, in the CEPH collection). We compared the tagging polymorphisms identified from our genotype data to that of two populations
in the HapMap project.
