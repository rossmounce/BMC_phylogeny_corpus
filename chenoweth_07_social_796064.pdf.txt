Abstract
Background: The major lineages of eusocial insects, the ants, termites, stingless bees, honeybees
and vespid wasps, all have ancient origins (≥ 65 mya) with no reversions to solitary behaviour. This
has prompted the notion of a 'point of no return' whereby the evolutionary elaboration and
integration of behavioural, genetic and morphological traits over a very long period of time leads
to a situation where reversion to solitary living is no longer an evolutionary option.
Results: We show that in another group of social insects, the allodapine bees, there was a single
origin of sociality > 40 mya. We also provide data on the biology of a key allodapine species,
Halterapis nigrinervis, showing that it is truly social. H. nigrinervis was thought to be the only
allodapine that was not social, and our findings therefore indicate that there have been no losses
of sociality among extant allodapine clades. Allodapine colony sizes rarely exceed 10 females per
nest and all females in virtually all species are capable of nesting and reproducing independently, so
these bees clearly do not fit the 'point of no return' concept.
Conclusion: We argue that allodapine sociality has been maintained by ecological constraints and
the benefits of alloparental care, as opposed to behavioural, genetic or morphological constraints
to independent living. Allodapine brood are highly vulnerable to predation because they are
progressively reared in an open nest (not in sealed brood cells), which provides potentially large
benefits for alloparental care and incentives for reproductives to tolerate potential alloparents. We
argue that similar vulnerabilities may also help explain the lack of reversions to solitary living in
other taxa with ancient social origins.

Background
Highly social insect groups have had enormous ecological
success [1], yet eusociality has evolved very infrequently
[2], raising the question of what barriers there might be to

its origin. Furthermore, soldier castes have been lost in
some thrips [3] and aphids [4], resulting in the loss of
eusocial nesting strategies. In halictine bees there have
been three origins of sociality but as many as twelve

losses, suggesting that in an evolutionary sense complex
sociality may be difficult to gain, but easy to lose [5]. In
contrast, there have been no losses of sociality in the ants,
termites, vespid wasps and corbiculate bees, all of which
evolved sociality > 65 mya [6].
In both thrips and halictid bees, sociality has evolved
much more recently than the Cretaceous origins of sociality in ants, termites, corbiculate bees and vespid wasps.
McLeish et al. [7] showed that sociality in gall forming
thrips evolved less than 10 mya, and Brady et al. [6]
showed that the three origins of sociality in halictines are
also relatively recent (22 – 20 myBP). This raises the question of whether losses of sociality are more likely in lineages where sociality is relatively recent, compared to older
social lineages that may have reached a 'point of no
return'.
The notion of a 'point of no return' was first suggested in
the early 1970s by Wilson [1] and proposes that, given
suitable evolutionary time, the multiple and integrated
adaptations associated with highly complex social behavior may preclude reversions to less complex or non-social
life cycles. Wilson and Hölldobler ([8], p. 13368) refer to
this evolutionary point as one where it is either "impossible, or at least difficult and uncommon", for a eusocial
species to revert back to a more primitively social or nonsocial form of organization, and speculate that it coincides with the evolution of an anatomically distinct
worker caste. The conjecture is important because it proposes a degree of irreversibility in social evolution due to
integration among adaptations in multiple traits, a situation akin to the idea of phylogenetic inertia arising from
bauplan constraints [9].
Importantly, the 'point of no return' hypothesis seems to
be the only one proposed for the lack of reversions to solitary life-cycles in the major social insect groups and as
such is an almost default paradigm. This is surprising,
given the amount of debate on other aspects of social evolution. Yet the point of no return hypothesis lacks a clearly
stated underlying mechanism for why reversions are precluded and, as such, is not truly falsifiable. Nevertheless it
is open to indirect assessments: in particular, demonstrating that very long term maintenance of sociality does not
require social complexity or a distinct worker caste would
indicate the possibility of alternative explanations for
long term maintenance of sociality.
Indirectly assessing whether points of no return depend
on social complexity and distinct worker castes can be
achieved by examining patterns of origins and losses in
taxa where these two traits are absent or variable. Brady et
al.'s [6] study of origins and losses in halictine bees provides one such assessment. Halictine bees provide special

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/246

insights into social evolution because, unlike most other
eusocial groups, adult females in all species are totipotent
and capable of producing brood [10]. Thus, individual
females are not constrained to group nesting, so that evolution is able to 'explore' non-social options. Only one
other group of bees, tribe Allodapini (Apidae), is speciose,
exhibits diverse range in forms of sociality and, in virtually
all species, all females are totipotent [11].
Until recently it was thought that sociality in allodapines
had arisen comparatively recently among the extant lineages [11] from a subsocial ancestor (i.e. a solitary ancestor
displaying extended parental care), and this ancestral trait
had been retained in a phylogenetically basal African allodapine, Halterapis nigrinervis [12]. At the same time, nesting biology of the speciose Halterapis group from
Madagascar was unknown. Recent molecular analyses
[13] show that the African Halterapis is not basally situated
in the allodapine phylogeny, and that the African and
Malagasy members of this genus are in fact paraphyletic,
implying a need for future taxonomic revision. Using
both Bayesian and penalized likelihood approaches,
Schwarz et al. [14] indicated an origin of the allodapine
tribe as being >40 mya but pointed out that this is likely
to be a highly conservative estimate. Recent behavioral
studies also show that the Malagasy Halterapis display
complex social behavior [15,16]. These findings indicate
that sociality is plesiomorphic for the allodapines, and
despite the relatively ancient origin of the tribe, the African Halterapis is the only allodapine to have potentially
lost complex social behavior.

Results
The initial study of H. nigrinervis [12] was based on a sample size of only eleven nests and multifemale colonies
comprised a single inseminated female along with one to
several uninseminated females that were presumed to be
recently eclosed adults and soon to disperse.
Our sample comprised a total of 52 H. nigrinervis nests.
Seven nests were stored in ethanol and the remaining 45
in Kahle's solution for dissection. These samples (Table 1)
indicate that H. nigrinervis is indeed social because: (i)
approximately half (54%) of the nests collected were multifemale; (ii) multifemale nests were far more likely to
contain brood (Table A1, Additional File 1) and the
number of young brood (eggs and larvae) increased with
the number of adult females, indicating enhanced brood
production when multiple adult females are present
within a nest (Figure 1); (iii) sex ratios were strongly
female-biased, consistent with positive kin interactions
leading to local resource enhancement [17,10]; and (iv)
ovary sizes of nestmates were strongly influenced by intracolony body-size rank (Figure 2) indicating the existence
of reproductive hierarchies. These results mean that H.

nigrinervis is social and that there are consequently now
no known losses of sociality in allodapines.
Consensus phylogenies from three partitioned Bayesian
analyses of sequence data all had identical topologies and
almost identical branch lengths. The consensus cladogram with posterior support values is given in Figure A1
(Additional File 1). Ingroup generic-level bifurcations
were highly supported and consistent with other
sequence-based studies of allodapines [14]. We also analysed sequence data with a maximum parsimony
approach and that gave broadly consistent results to our
Bayesian analyses and previous phylogenetic studies [14]
(Figure A2, Additional File 1). The only inconsistencies
between our Bayesian, our MP results, and those of previous studies, involve nodes close to terminal taxa.

which also indicates the geographic distribution of the
major clades. When the basal node (divergence of corbiculate bees from the xylocopine bees) is conservatively set
at 90 myBP, the point estimate for the earliest divergence
of allodapine clades is 47 myBP, with a lower (most
recent) 95% limit of 40 myBP. Because sociality occurs in
all the extant allodapine lineages, it must be a plesiomorphic trait and must therefore have originated by at least 40
myBP, and probably much earlier given the very conservative nature of all three calibration points. This age-estimate is similar to that of Schwarz et al. [14] and suggests
that the age of the allodapine root node is approximately
twice the ages for estimated origins of sociality in halictine
bees [6].

We used penalized likelihood transformation of the Bayesian phylograms to produce a chronogram (Figure 3),

As an independent assessment of approximate divergence
ages, we compared pairwise maximum likelihood distances for allodapine species whose most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) was at the root allodapine node with
those for halictine species whose MRCA was at one of the
three origins of sociality in halictines [6], which were
dated at 20–22 mya [6], using a sequenced fragment of
EF-1α common to both groups. Substitutional parameters
for this gene fragment are almost identical for halictines
and allodapines (see supplementary material) indicating
that evolutionary dynamics for this gene fragment are very
similar for the two bee groups. If evolutionary rates are
also comparable in the two groups, the resulting distances
suggest that the root node of the allodapines is about
twice the age of the origins of sociality suggested for the
halictines (Figure A3, Additional File 1), which concords
very closely with our penalised likelihood analysis.

greatest when comparing single- with two-female colonies, because brood in the former colonies are unprotected when the sole adult is foraging [18]. This
vulnerability of brood is heightened by orphaning, since
not only will post-feeding brood be unprotected, but feeding-stage larvae will be unable to complete their development due to lack of food. In the event of orphaning,
potential alloparents could reap large indirect fitness
gains by simply protecting post-feeding brood or completing the feeding of partially reared larvae [19], as well as
direct benefits from inheriting a nest along with a subsequent cohort of potential alloparents. In fact, alloparental
rearing in the absence of possible mothers is recorded
from diverse species [20,21] indicating that it does not
require maternal coercion. At the same time, mothers
would gain benefits from permitting some daughters to
remain in the nest as insurance against orphaning [22].

Discussion

In contrast, the vulnerability of brood and the benefits of
alloparental care in cell-provisioning insects are quite different. Mass provisioning of brood in cells means that
mothers sequester their investments as completed units
over time, and these cells provide brood with some physical protection from enemies at the nest. In addition, if
orphaning does occur, immatures sealed in cells will have
sufficient food for their complete development, further
reducing the scope for benefits from alloparental care.

Our results are important because they suggest that, compared to halictine bees, allodapines have a much older
origin of sociality but show no losses of sociality. In this
respect, they are more similar to eusocial lineages such as
ants, corbiculate bees, vespid wasps and termites, which
also have ancient social origins with no losses. This raises
the question of what factors may prevent losses of sociality over very large time scales.
Lack of reversions to solitary living in allodapines cannot
be explained by arguments that they are restricted to habitats or climatic regimes that favour sociality. The ecological diversification of allodapines covers habitats such arid
gibber deserts, savannas, bushvelds, coastal heathlands,
equatorial and subtropical rainforests, and sub-alpine
regions [12,18]. Colony phenology ranges from highly
seasonal univoltine egg production schedules [18], all the
way through to asynchronous development patterns
where egg production, brood maturation, and foundress
dispersal occur year round [10]. The lack of reversions to
purely solitary living is even more notable because of the
near-ubiquity of female totipotency in allodapines [10],
which means that physiological factors do not preclude
independent living. We argue that the absence of reversions to solitary living is due to ecological consequences
of the way in which allodapines rear their brood, and this
may also help explain some broader trends found in ants,
termites and vespid wasps.
Unlike virtually all other bees, which rear their brood in
fully provisioned sealed cells, allodapines rear brood in
un-partitioned and unsealed tunnels. Because brood lack
the physical protection of an enclosed cell, they are highly
vulnerable to predation in the absence of an adult guard.
Indeed, the major benefit of group living in allodapines is
avoidance of total brood failure [18], and this benefit is

Whilst protecting the nest from both predation and parasitism is important for all bees [11,23], allodapine brood
are particularly vulnerable due to the lack of cells [10,11].
Continuous protection from predation is impossible for a
solitary nesting allodapine, as the nest is completely
unguarded during the female's foraging trips. We suggest
this vulnerability is a compelling explanation for why
there have been no reversions to purely solitary living in
allodapines but multiple losses in halictines.
It has been argued that the lack of reversions to solitary
nesting in ants and termites may reflect the evolution of
social complexity to a 'point of no return' [8], where a species is no longer able to live solitarily. However, there are
numerous ant groups where newly founded colonies
involve non-claustral queens rearing their first brood
cohort to maturity without help from workers [24], suggesting that competency for solitary brood rearing per se
exists in many taxa. For example, within many ant subfamilies (predominantly within in the poneroid clade but
also some formicoid subfamilies [24,25]), there are species where colony foundation almost exclusively involves
a single brood-rearing foundress and very small ultimate
colony sizes [24,26]. Queens must forage in order to feed
their first clutch of brood, indicating that solitary-founding females in these species are capable of foraging effectively enough to rear through their first generation of

Page 5 of 9

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:246

brood alone [26]. Many of the aforementioned subfamilies also contain multiple independent losses of the
queen caste, which has resulted in numerous species displaying ubiquitous female totipotency [26] but without
any transitions to purely solitary living.
In social taxa where females can successfully rear brood to
maturity in a non-claustral fashion without help of a
worker caste, explanations for a lack of reversions to solitary living must involve something other than incompetence for independent brood rearing. Ants share one key
life history trait with allodapines, namely that brood are
progressively reared in unsealed communal tunnels. In
social vespid wasps, larvae are also reared to pupation in
unsealed cells, and while termite young are not 'provisioned' by adults, they also develop in unsealed chambers
and are highly vulnerable in the absence of adults. In all
these taxa, protection of brood depends heavily on adults,
and this contrasts with halictines where nearly all species
sequester their fully provisioned brood in closed cells.
Losses of sociality would remove the brood protection
that group living confers in the former groups, but the
physical protection of cells in halictines would allow
some protection of brood in solitary nesting halictines to
be maintained.
Lastly, we have argued that the 'point of no return' paradigm has been framed in a way that does not readily allow
falsification. We believe that our conjecture provides two
predictions that permit empirical assessment: (i) that
reversions from social to solitary brood rearing are more
likely in clades where constraints to solitary living are low;
and (ii) that reversions from social to solitary can occur
even after specialised worker/soldier castes have evolved,
provided that ecological constraints for independent
reproduction are relaxed. Halictine bees and gall-forming
thrips comprise two groups where these predictions could
be tested, but there are likely to be many other taxa as
well.

Conclusion
Our findings suggest a very different framework for understanding social evolution from that argued in some recent
studies [27,28] that emphasize the importance of mechanistic approaches involving physiology, regulatory circuits
and genetic-networks. In particular, Hunt and Amdam
[29] suggest "...that social evolution in insects can be fully
– and finally – understood" by such mechanistic
approaches. Although such approaches may help explain
the ontogeny of worker-like behaviour, our results indicate that retention of such behaviour is likely to be due to
ecological and life-history factors, and these have the
potential to determine very long term patterns of social
evolution. The ecological dimensions of sociality cannot

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/246

be ignored when trying to understand its origins and longterm maintenance.

Methods
Sociality
Colonies of H. nigrinervis were collected from Grahamstown, South Africa in 2005 from 20 to 23 February, when
colonies were rearing brood. Colonies were preserved in
ethanol for molecular studies and Kahle's solution for dissections. Ovarian indices of females were calculated as the
summed lengths of the three largest oocytes divided by
wing length (used as an indication of body size), and used
when estimating ovarian enlargement to avoid body-size
scaling effects. Colony productivity was measured as the
number of eggs and larvae divided by the number of adult
females.
Benefits of social nesting
If multifemale colonies contain only a single mother and
other females are recently eclosed daughters who are soon
to disperse, we would expect that the latter daughters
would not have an effect on the number of brood being
actively reared (larvae) or soon to be reared (eggs). We
examined this statistically. Variation in the number of
eggs + larvae among different colony sizes was assessed
using Kruskal Wallis non-parametric test, rather than parametric ANOVA, because brood numbers were 1-truncated (colonies lacking any eggs or larvae were excluded).
This test indicated a significant effect (χ23 = 12.145, P =
0.007) and Figure 1 below indicates an increasing function.
Molecular phylogenetics
Using molecular data, Schwarz et al. [14] argued that the
Allodapini had an origin in the Eocene of at least 40 mya.
Here, we re-examine the time of this origin using penalised likelihood transformation of a molecular phylogeny
based on an expanded set of taxa that allows an additional
fossil calibration point and better resolution of some
internal nodes including the position of Halterapis. We
also explore the effects of varying the date of the basal
node, namely the divergence of lineages leading to the
allodapine and corbiculate bee clades.

We used two mitochondrial (COI and cyt b) gene regions
and an exon region of one nuclear gene (F2 copy of EF1α) comprising 1279, 428 and 772 nucleotides respectively. Our taxa comprised at least two species of each
non-parasitic allodapine genus except Exoneuridia and
Compsomelissa which are rare and for which we had only
one species each. Most of the ceratinine and allodapine
taxa used in our study have been used in previous phylogenetic analyses of allodapines by Schwarz et al.
[13,30,15,14] and Bull et al. [31] and GenBank accession
numbers are provided in these manuscripts. In addition to

Page 6 of 9

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:246

these taxa, we used a Malagasy Halterapis, Halterapis
isaloensis (EU254247, EU254248, EU254249) and an
additional African Halterapis, Halterapis nigrinervis with a
black metasoma (EU254250, EU254251). We used two
halictid bees, Lasioglossum lanarium and Agapostemon tyleri
[32] as the outgroup. Apis mellifera, as well as representatives of the genus Bombus (Bombus terrrestris and an unidentified Bombus sp. from Santiago, Chile (EU254244,
EU254245, EU254246)) and an unidentifiable species of
Liotrigona from Madagascar (EU254241, EU254242,
EU254243) were included to allow additional calibration
points for determining the age of the allodapine root node
(see below).
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing methods
used for the gene fragments used on our analyses have
already been published, see Schwarz et al. [14] and references cited therein.
Phylogeny was inferred using both Maximum parsimony
and Bayesian inference. We place greater reliance on Bayesian methods for allodapines because of greater ability of
this approach to deal with heterogeneity in substitutional
dynamics of different codon positions and gene fragments, as well as problems arising from signal degradation at third codon positions [32]. Bayesian inference was
implemented with MrBayes v3.0.4 [33], with codon positions separately partitioned for the nuclear and combined
mitochondrial genes, and all partitions unlinked for
model parameters and using default priors, as described
by Schwarz et al. [14]. Three Bayesian runs were undertaken in order to ensure runs were consistently converging
on similar patterns. MCMC chains were run for 3 ×
106generations, with a burnin of 1.5 million generations,
and post-burnin trees combined across runs. Trees were
sampled every 500th generation. All runs converged on
identical consensus topologies and posterior probability
values for nodes and branch lengths were based on a total
of 9000 post-burnin sampled trees. The resulting consensus phylogram was transformed into a chronogram using
Sanderson's [34] penalised likelihood method. Bayesian
methods using relaxed-clock models were not used
because the estimated transition matrix clearly contradicted the most complex (F84) model that can be implemented using Thorne and Kishino's [35] Multidivtime
software.
For our maximum parsimony (MP) analyses, we ran a
heuristic search with 50 random sequence stepwise additions, with 5 trees held at each step, and TBR branch swapping with 500 bootstrap pseudoreplicates to estimate
support. 3rd mitochondrial positions were removed from
the analysis to prevent long-branch attraction between
genera observed in previous studies [14,30,32].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/246

To estimate the age of the allodapine root node (earliest
divergence among extant clades) we employed three calibration points. We set a minimum divergence between
Ceratinini and Allodapini at 45 myBP because of the existence of fossil Boreallodapini species from Baltic amber
[36]. Boreallodapini is the extinct sister group to the
extant tribe Allodapini and Ceratinini is the next-most
basal tribe. This minimum age is therefore highly conservative [14] and the Allodapini+Boreallodapini is likely to
have diverged from the Ceratinini much earlier than this.
We also used the presence of the amber fossil stingless bee
Cretotrigona prisca, dated at 70–65 myBP [37] to set a minimum time of divergence of 70 myBP between the
Meliponini and Bombini, but as with the boreallodapine
calibration point this is likely to be highly conservative,
requiring that C. prisca had arisen as soon as the two
clades diverged. The last calibration point was the node
joining the xylocopine and the corbiculate lineages in our
sample. Fossils of the plant family Clusiaceae, whose floral morphology is closely linked to corbiculate bees, are
dated at 90 myBP [38] and so we fixed this node at 90
myBP. However, it is possible that corbiculates diverged
from the clade leading to xylocopines well before this, so
we also explored the effect of setting the date of this node
to 100, 110 and 120 myBP. Confidence intervals for node
ages were estimated as 95% central distribution limits
using the method of Schwarz et al. [14], where all postburnin Bayesian trees were filtered by the consensus Bayesian topology, then subjected to penalised likelihood
transformation. The resulting chronograms were sorted
for age of the allodapine root node and the resulting 2.5%
upper and lower node ages removed.
As a further check of the antiquity of the allodapine root
node we compared sequence divergences of EF-1α for species-pairs whose most recent common ancestor occurred
at that node, with equivalent species-pairs for the origins
of sociality in halictines (three origins, with estimated
ages of 22–20 mya) where internal fossil calibration
points are available [6,14], with an overlapping region of
exon 772 bp. For both data sets, gene fragments were
trimmed to the overlapping region and ModelTest 3.0.4
[39] was used to fit substitution models to both taxa.
These analyses returned highly similar models (Table A2,
Additional File 1), suggesting that this gene region evolves
with very similar dynamics in both halictines and allodapines. We then used these models to calculate maximum
likelihood pairwise distances for both data sets. For allodapines, this involved pairwise distances between the
Macrogalea species (forming the sister clade to all other
allodapines) and representatives of all other known allodapine non-parasitic genera. For halictines, this involved
all taxa pairs whose most recent common ancestor
(MRCA) was the inferred node of origin of sociality. These
pairwise distances are not independent of each other,

since most taxa are included in the calculation of more
than one pairwise distance in either bee group, so that
mean and median values cannot be statistically compared
between the two taxa.
