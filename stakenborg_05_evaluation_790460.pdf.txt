Abstract
Background: Mycoplasmas are present worldwide in a large number of animal hosts. Due to their
small genome and parasitic lifestyle, Mycoplasma spp. require complex isolation media.
Nevertheless, already over 100 different species have been identified and characterized and their
number increases as more hosts are sampled. We studied the applicability of amplified rDNA
restriction analysis (ARDRA) for the identification of all 116 acknowledged Mycoplasma species and
subspecies.
Methods: Based upon available 16S rDNA sequences, we calculated and compared theoretical
ARDRA profiles. To check the validity of these theoretically calculated profiles, we performed
ARDRA on 60 strains of 27 different species and subspecies of the genus Mycoplasma.
Results: In silico digestion with the restriction endonuclease AluI (AG^CT) was found to be most
discriminative and generated from 3 to 13 fragments depending on the Mycoplasma species.
Although 73 Mycoplasma species could be differentiated using AluI, other species gave
undistinguishable patterns. For these, an additional restriction digestion, typically with BfaI
(C^TAG) or HpyF10VI (GCNNNNN^NNGC), was needed for a final identification. All in vitro
obtained restriction profiles were in accordance with the calculated fragments based on only one
16S rDNA sequence, except for two isolates of M. columbinum and two isolates of the M. mycoides
cluster, for which correct ARDRA profiles were only obtained if the sequences of both rrn operons
were taken into account.
Conclusion: Theoretically, restriction digestion of the amplified rDNA was found to enable
differentiation of all described Mycoplasma species and this could be confirmed by application of
ARDRA on a total of 27 species and subspecies.

Background

Methods

Mycoplasmas are phylogenetically related to gram-positive bacteria with low GC-content and belong to the class
of the Mollicutes. They form a unique group of bacteria
that lack a cell-wall and that contain sterols in their cytoplasmatic membrane. They are of great importance, since
several species are pathogenic to animals or humans,
whereas species of other mollicute genera also infect
plants and insects [1]. In addition, a series of mycoplasmas cause trouble in the laboratory, because they infect
cell cultures. Already over 100 species have been
described, and their number, as well as the number of different hosts is still increasing.

Isolates
A total of 60 strains, belonging to 27 different Mycoplasma
species and subspecies, were used during this study (Table
1). The Mycoplasma spp. belonging to the mycoides-cluster
and the M. hyosynoviae strains, were kindly provided as
purified genomic DNA samples by Dr. L. Manso-Silivan
(CIRAD, France) and Dr. B. Kokotovic (DFVF, Denmark),
respectively. All other Mycoplasma spp. were cultivated
using F-medium [21], modified Hayflick medium [22],
SP-4-medium [22], SP-4-medium supplemented with Larginine, HS-medium [23], or Friis'-medium with ampicillin instead of methicillin [24].

A correct identification of mycoplasmas, mostly performed after a fastidious initial isolation, may be achieved
by various methods. Original tools to identify mycoplasmas were mainly based on biochemical and serological
differentiation, varying from simple precipitation tests
[2], to ELISA [3,4], immunofluorescence [5], or Western
blot analysis [6]. These techniques are being replaced by
faster DNA-based tools [7]. Many of these methods are
based on the 16S rDNA sequence for various reasons.
First, the 16S rDNA has been sequenced for all recognized
Mycoplasma spp. and is required when describing a new
species [8]. Secondly, the 16S rDNA sequences have lower
intraspecific variability than most protein encoding genes,
hence their use in the construction of phylogenetic topologies [9]. Recently, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of amplified 16S rDNA was shown to be useful to
differentiate most Mycoplasma spp. [10]. In another
approach, correct identification of related Mycoplasma
spp. was based on differences of the 16S-23S intergenic
spacer (ITS) region. Both size variation [11] as sequence
differences [11,12] of the ITS were successfully used to differentiate related species. Compared to the 16S rDNA
sequence, ITS sequences may vary more between strains of
the same species due to a lower selection pressure [13],
although reports of very highly conserved ITS regions are
known as well [14].

All isolates were previously identified using biochemical
tests and growth precipitation tests with absorbed rabbit
antisera [2]. Whenever discrepancies existed between the
obtained ARDRA-profiles and the serological results, the
16S rDNA was sequenced for an exact identification [25].

Amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) has already
been used for the identification of some avian species [1517] as well as for pathogenic mycoplasmas in cats [18].
Restriction analysis with PstI of an amplified 16S rDNA
fragment was also shown useful to differentiate M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae from the other species
belonging to the mycoides-cluster [19]. The potential and
power of ARDRA to identify members of the Mollicutes
was already put forward [20], but was never worked out in
detail for a large number of species. In this study, we
investigated the value of ARDRA to identify all (to date)
recognized Mycoplasma spp.

DNA extraction
DNA of growing cultures was extracted using a phenolchloroform extraction described previously [26] or using
alkaline lysis. For alkaline lysis, the cultures were centrifuged (2', 10000 g) and resuspended in 50 µl lysis buffer
(0.25% SDS in 0.05 N NaOH). After 5' at 95°C, 300 µl
water was added and the bacterial debris was centrifuged
(2', 10000 g). One µl of the supernatant was used as template for amplification of the 16S rDNA.
16S PCR amplification
The universal primers pA (5'AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and pH (5'AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA) were
used to amplify the 16S rRNA genes [25], yielding an
amplification product of approximately 1500 bp. Thirty
cycles (20" 94°C; 15" 57°C; and 30' 72°C) were run on a
GeneAmp 9600 Thermal Cycler (Perkin Elmer, USA)
using 3 U recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen,
UK), 1 × PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
and 50 mM KCl; pH 8.4), 10 pmol of each primer and 1
µl of the genomic DNA (~30 ng) as template. Reaction
volumes were 50 µl.
Restriction digestion
For all 60 strains, 10 µl of the 16S rDNA PCR product was
digested with 5 U of restriction enzyme AluI (Fermentas,
Lithuania; sequence: AG^CT) and the associated Y+/Tango
restriction buffer (Fermentas) in a total volume of 20 µl
for 2 hours at 37°C. For a final identification, the amplified 16S rDNA of some strains were digested in addition
with BfaI (New England Biolabs, USA; sequence: C^TAG)
or HpyF10VI (Fermentas; sequence: GCNNNNN^NNGC).
The restriction fragments were separated on a 3% Nusieve
3:1 agar (Tebu-Bio, France) for 2 hours at 130 V and visualized using a GeneGenius gel documentation system

a DNA marker (Fermentas).
Sequences &in silico ARDRA-profiles
ARDRA-profiles were calculated for all Mycoplasma spp. as
acknowledged by the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes (ICPS) to date. The 16S rDNA
sequences were downloaded from Genbank (accession
numbers are indicated in Figure 1). A consensus sequence
was constructed and used for species for which more than
one sequence was available. The M. orale 16S rDNA
sequence was determined and submitted [Genbank:AY796060], since the only available sequence contained numerous ambiguities. For the members of the M.
mycoides-cluster – for which differences between rrnA and
rrnB have been published [27] – both sequences were
used. For some Mycoplasma spp. only a partial sequence of
the 16S rDNA was available. For these sequences, nucleotides were added to the 5' and/or 3' ends to generate fragments of expected length. These lengths and the choice of
the nucleotides added were based on a 16S rDNA consensus sequence obtained by alignment of the complete Mycoplasma 16S rDNA sequences available in Genbank using
Clustal W. The restriction sites and the exact size of the

ARDRA fragments were calculated using Vector NTI
Advance V9.0 (Invitrogen) and BioNumerics V3.5
(Applied-Maths, Belgium).
By way of illustration, a dendrogram, based on ARDRA
patterns, was constructed using the Unweighted Pair
Group Method with Arithmetic Means (UPGMA) using
1% tolerance (i.e. bands that differ about 7 nucleotides or
less are considered identical) and taking only fragments
from 80 to 800 nucleotides into account.

Results
For all Mycoplasma spp., the theoretical AluI,BfaI and
HpyF10VI restriction patterns were calculated [see Additional file 1] and are represented in Figure 1, 2, 3. For a
number of species, ARDRA was carried out in the laboratory to confirm the in silico obtained results and to check
the validity of the technique for identification. ARDRA
profiles obtained with AluI and BfaI are shown in Figure 4
and Figure 5, respectively. For a further verification of the
technique and for the remaining 9 species that could not
be identified with AluI or BfaI alone, ARDRA was also performed with HpyF10VI (Figure 6, 7).

Calculated ARDRA profiles of Mycoplasma spp
Calculated ARDRA profiles of Mycoplasma spp. that can be differentiated using BfaI, but had undistinguishable AluI restriction
profiles.

Two of the four M. columbinum strains showed an unpredicted ARDRA pattern after restriction with AluI. Since the
sum of all bands was higher than the length of the 16S
sequence, a difference between the 2 rrn operons was
expected. This was verified by sequence analysis, which
revealed an ambiguity at position 997 (i.e. position 1007
in the E. coli numbering), pointing to the presence of
AGCT in one and AGTT in the other operon. As such, a
restriction site for AluI in one operon will lack in the other

operon and will lead to a mixture of ARDRA profiles. Also
for the strains of the M. mycoides-cluster the published
sequences of both rrn operons were taken into account
[27]. By superimposition of the restriction profiles of both
rrnA and rrnB, the correct, expected profiles were
obtained. However, a faint band of approximately 370
nucleotides was observed in the HpyF10VI restriction profile of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, indicating a
partial restriction at position 1082 of the rrnA gene (Fig-

ure 7). For all other samples, profiles were identical to the
calculated restriction profiles using only one consensus
sequence of the Genbank entries.
A few species could not be differentiated with the three
suggested enzymes and for these, other enzymes were
selected. M. cricetuli and M. collis, which have 16S rRNA
operons that are 99.8% identical, can be differentiated
using Hpy188III. This enzyme cuts the 16S rDNA of M. collis 7 times, while restriction takes place only 6 times in the
16S rRNA gene of M. cricetuli. Also the restriction enzyme
EarI can be used, since it only restricts the 16S rRNA gene
of M. cricetuli. The very related M. imitans and M. gallisep-

ticum could be differentiated using MseI or HindII. The
restriction enzyme BstUI could be used to differentiate the
otherwise indistinguishable M. haemocanis (2 restriction
sites) and M. haemofelis (3 restriction sites). The determined 16S rDNA sequence of M. orale was almost identical to the 16S rDNA of M. indiense and specific restriction
enzymes, like BsaJI or EcoHI, were necessary to differentiate these species. In case of the very related members of
the mycoides-cluster, the differentiation is more complicated and a whole series of restrictions are needed. Based
on the occurrence of different restriction sites, it is however theoretically possible to correctly identify these species as well, using only commercially available restriction
endonucleases (Table 2).

Discussion
Identification of mycoplasmas still largely relies on serological tests, but owing to the limited availability of quality-controlled sera, the high number of species, the
serological cross-reaction between related species and the
great variability in the surface antigens of different strains
[28], newer techniques are needed. Sequence analysis of
the 16S rRNA genes proved a useful tool to identify species, but the need for expensive equipment makes the

technique less favorable for routine diagnosis. In this
study, we showed that theoretically all Mycoplasma spp.
are distinguishable using ARDRA. The in silico determined
discriminative power was confirmed in the laboratory and
even closely related Mycoplasma spp. could be identified
correctly, as exemplified by the restriction with AluI and
BfaI of M. agalactiae and M. bovis.
We used universal primers to amplify the entire 16S rDNA
to obtain a maximum discriminatory power. Working
with universal primers implies that interference from
other bacteria is to be expected when starting from clinical
samples [29], especially when mycoplasmas are not abundantly present. The use of mycoplasma-specific primers
binding to internal regions of the 16S rRNA genes may be
helpful and result in a higher specificity as was already
proposed by others [20,30]. However, care must be taken
since the discriminatory power will decrease if primers are
chosen in such a way that less restriction sites are present
in the amplification products. Alternatively, McAuliffe et
al. [31] proposed a selective enrichment step for 24 hours
in Eaton's-medium before amplification of 16S sequences
to identify Mycoplasma spp. Also Kiss et al. [16] used
ARDRA to identify three avian Mycoplasma species after 48
hours of incubation in Frey media. These suggested
approaches may solve most problems, but may still be
insufficient for mixed Mycoplasma cultures. The presence
of more than one Mycoplasma species in clinical samples
will lead to complex patterns, which are not easily
resolved.
Differences between rrn operons have been reported in
several bacterial classes, but the level of sequence heterogeneity was recently shown to be lower than expected
[32]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that rrn operons
tend to evolve in concert [33]. For some bacterial species
a high level of 16S rDNA sequence heterogeneity has been
described [34,35], while for Mycoplasma species, which
possess no more than 2 rrn operons, only some micro-het-

erogeneity (i.e. scattered sequence variation between
highly related rRNA genes) has been reported [27,36,37].
Besides, most differences between the two operons will
not lead to altered restriction sites and will not influence
the ARDRA patterns. In case a mutation is located within
one of both restriction recognition sites, as was shown in
particular for M. columbinum, restriction will most likely
yield an unknown ARDRA profile, rather than lead to a
false identification. Moreover, this aberrant pattern can be
included in the identification scheme. The significance of
the C1007T transition (E. coli numbering) present in two
of the four M. columbinum strains is still unknown, but
was shown in some strains of E. coli as well [33]. Also, in
agreement with an earlier report [27], many differences
between the rrnA and rrnB sequences were observed for
members of the M. mycoides cluster. Nevertheless, the
combined restriction profiles of both rrn sequences
resulted in expected patterns with exception of a faint
band seen for M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae after
restriction with HpyF10VI. The reason for this partial
restriction is unknown since purifying the PCR product,
increasing the enzyme concentration, or lengthening the
incubation period made no difference (data not shown).
In any case, identification based on ARDRA was shown
complex for these very related species and other techniques – like serological tests independent of the 16S
rDNA sequences [8] – may be more suitable. However, the
extra band visible for M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC after
restriction with AluI was shown sufficiently stable to be
used for identification [38] and the value of ARDRA using
PstI was also reported for M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae [36]. Although the 16S rDNA sequences of these
species may be almost identical, ARDRA is able to emphasize the few differences present without the need of
extensive 16S rDNA sequence analysis or other tests
[19,38-40]. Also for other species with nearly identical
16S rDNA sequences (99.5% identity for M. haemocanis
and M. haemofelis; 99.7% for M. gallisepticum and M. imitans; 98.9% for M. orale and M. indiense, and 99.8% for M.

criteculi and M. collis), it was calculated that restriction
analysis with a single additional enzyme would result in
different restriction patterns and therefore to a correct
identification.

Conclusion
Restriction digestion with AluI of the amplified 16S rDNA
can be used to differentiate between 73 of the 116
described Mycoplasma species and subspecies. An additional restriction with BfaI or HpyF10VI enables the identification of another 31 species and subspecies. Also the
remaining 12 species can be differentiated, with the use of
additonal enzymes, although other techniques may be
preferred for some members of the M. mycoides-cluster.
The simplicity and the general applicability of ARDRA
make it possible to implement this technique in most laboratories with basic molecular biology equipment.
