Abstract
Background: The unique property of some avian H10 viruses, particularly the ability to cause severe disease in mink
without prior adaptation, enabled our study. Coupled with previous experimental data and genetic characterization
here we tried to investigate the possible influence of different genes on the virulence of these H10 avian influenza
viruses in mink.
Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between the viruses studied. Our study also showed that
there are no genetic differences in receptor specificity or the cleavability of the haemagglutinin proteins of these
viruses regardless of whether they are of low or high pathogenicity in mink.
In poly I:C stimulated mink lung cells the NS1 protein of influenza A virus showing high pathogenicity in mink down
regulated the type I interferon promoter activity to a greater extent than the NS1 protein of the virus showing low
pathogenicity in mink.
Conclusions: Differences in pathogenicity and virulence in mink between these strains could be related to clear amino
acid differences in the non structural 1 (NS1) protein. The NS gene of mink/84 appears to have contributed to the
virulence of the virus in mink by helping the virus evade the innate immune responses.

Background
The outbreak of severe respiratory disease in mink (Mustela vison) in 1984 was linked to an avian influenza virus
of subtype H10N4. At the time this was the first known
outbreak of avian influenza A virus infection in a terrestrial mammalian species [1,2]. The only possible explanation was that birds carrying the virus transmitted it via
their faeces to the mink. At the time, this was one of the
very first cases of direct transmission of avian influenza
virus to a terrestrial mammalian species [1].
Only a few months after the outbreak in Swedish mink,
some viruses of the H10N4 subtype were isolated from
domestic and wild birds in Great Britain [3]. Rather crude

ping [4] and sequence analysis of the HA [5] and NP
genes [6] were conducted. The ON mapping showed a
close genomic relationship between the mink isolate (A/
Mink/Sweden/3900/84) and the concomitant avian
H10N4 viruses from fowl (A/fowl/Hampshire/378/85)
and mallard (A/mallard/Gloucestershire/374/85) respectively, and a weaker genomic relationship with the H10
prototype [7] virus (A/chicken/Germany/N/49) [4].
Experimental infection of mink (Mustela vison) was initially used to link the isolated influenza virus to the clinical symptoms and pathological lesions observed in the
field outbreak. In a later study, mink were infected intranasally with mink/84, mallard/85, fowl/85, or chicken/49
to compare clinical symptoms, antibody response, and
possible in-contact transmission [4].
Experimental aerosol infections of mink, using mink/84
or chicken/49, were then used to compare in more detail
the pathogenesis of the two virus infections [8,9]. Follow-

ing intranasal infection of the mink, all three H10N4 isolates, i.e. mink/84, mallard/85 and fowl/85, showed
similar clinical symptoms, causing respiratory disease,
interstitial pneumonia and specific antibody production.
All three H10N4 isolates were transmitted via contact
infection. Chicken/49 did not cause clinical disease or
contact infection, but induced antibody production and
mild lung lesions [8].
Further comparison between mink/84 and chicken/49
revealed that the infections progressed with similar patterns over the first 24 hours post infection but from 48
hours post infection obvious differences were recorded.
In mink infected with chicken/49 no signs of disease were
observed, while the mink infected with mink/84 showed
severe signs of respiratory disease, with inflammatory
lesions spreading throughout the lung and viral antigen
present in substantial numbers of cells in the lung, nasal
mucosa, and trachea. The chicken/49 and mink/84 virus
have also been shown to differ in their ability to induce
interferon (IFN) production in mink lung cells [8-10].
In an effort to better understand the mechanism behind
the virulence of influenza A viruses we characterized the
complete genome of influenza A viruses that clearly
showed different pathogenicity for mink.

Results and discussion
The outcome of influenza A virus infection is influenced
both by the virus and the infected host [11,12]. The virulence of an influenza virus isolate for a given host reflects
its ability to enter a host cell, replicate within the cell and
then exit and spread to new cells. Several viral gene products can contribute to the pathogenicity and virulence of
the influenza A virus [13,14]. Although in most instances
virulence is a multigenic trait, a single gene can also
markedly affect the pathogenicity and virulence of the
virus [15-18].
Phylogenetic and sequence analysis

We sequenced the complete genome of five H10 viruses
and analysed them along with all H10 viruses available in
the GenBank database. Phylogenetic relationships were
determined for each of the eight gene segments. The
amino acid sequences of the entire genome were analysed
to identify important amino acid residues associated with
enhanced replication and virulence in mammalian species.

ship among H10 viruses is very difficult. Furthermore,
the HA gene of mink/84 clustered with mallard/85, fowl/
85 and whistlingswan/88 within the Eurasian avian lineage and was distinct from the HA of chicken/49, which
clusters with the early H10 Eurasian avian isolates. There
is a high degree of similarity at the amino acid level of the
haemagglutinin gene of the studied viruses. The HA
genes of mink/84 and the concomitant wild bird isolates
were 98% identical with each other and showed 95% similarity to the prototype H10 virus, chicken/49. The HA
gene of H10 viruses was analysed for potential N-glycosylation sites. Our analysis indicated that all the studied
H10 viruses possess five potential glycosylation sites
(positions 13, 29, 236, 406 and 447) except for fowl/85,
which displayed an additional glycosylation site at residue
123. Interestingly fowl/85 virus was originally isolated
from a flock of sick chickens with nephropathy and visceral gout [3]. Several studies indicate that the receptor
specificity of haemagglutinin plays an important role for
tissue tropism and the host range of the influenza virus
[19]. The amino acid composition of the receptor binding
pocket of the HA protein for the H10 isolates is typical of
avian influenza viruses. The H10 viruses have histidine
(H), glutamate (E) and glutamine (Q) at amino acid positions 177, 184, and 216, respectively, in H10 numbering at
the receptor-binding site [20], which favours binding of
sialic-acid α-2,3-galactose.
The haemagglutinin cleavability and the presence of
multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site play a
major role in influenza H5 and H7 virus transmission and
virulence [21-23]. All five H10 isolates presented in this
study contained the amino acid sequence PQG÷RGLF at
the cleavage site in the HA molecule, indicating their low
pathogenicity. Nevertheless four of these H10 viruses
were found to be highly pathogenic in mink. It is noteworthy that at least two H10 isolates (A/turkey/England/
384/79/H10N4 and A/mandarin duck/Singapore/8058F72/7/93/H10N5) that were reported previously by Wood
and co authors, would have fulfilled the definition for
highly pathogenic viruses with intravenous pathogenicity
index (IVPI) values > 1.2, without having multiple basic
amino acids at their haemagglutinin cleavage site [24].
This suggests that a factor other than the presence of
multiple basic amino acids in the cleavage site contributed to the severity of H10 viruses in mink.
Neuraminidase

Haemagglutinin

Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that all of
the H10 viruses examined in this study belong to the Eurasian avian lineage of the influenza A viruses (Figure 1).
Based on the limited sequence data from the Eurasian
avian lineage of H10 influenza viruses that are available in
GenBank, a clear determination of the genetic relation-

Two different NA subtypes (N4 and N7) were associated
with H10 viruses in this study. Phylogenetic analysis of
the NA gene showed that all viruses belonged to the Eurasian avian lineage and within each NA subtype, the
viruses clustered in the same branches. The NA protein
plays an important role during the entry of the virus into
the cells and in the release of viral progeny from infected

cells [25,26]. The active site of the NA protein consists of
15 charged amino acids that are conserved in all influenza
A viruses [27]. All of these amino acids that make up the
active site (R117, D150, R151, R224, E276, R292, R369
and Y403 in N4 numbering) and the framework site
(E119, R155, W178, S179, D/N198, I122, E227, H274,
E277, N294 and E425) of the NA are conserved in the
H10 viruses presented in this study. H10 influenza
viruses have a propensity to cause clinical symptoms in
humans; experimental and natural infections with H10N7
strains have clearly shown the zoonotic potential of some
H10 avian influenza viruses [28,29]. In the NA protein of
the analysed H10 isolates no substitutions associated
with resistance to neuraminidase inhibitor drugs (oseltamivir) were observed [30].
It has been suggested that the efficiency of viral replication in terrestrial domestic poultry correlates with the
length of the NA stalk and that stalk deletion has resulted
in adaptation of the virus to land-based poultry [26,31].
No deletions were found in the stalk regions of the
neuraminidase of the viruses sequenced in this study,
indicating no adaptation for growth in terrestrial domestic poultry, this despite the fact that two of the studied
viruses have been isolated from sick chickens [3,7].
Internal genes

The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of influenza virus
contains four proteins that are necessary for viral replication: PB1, PB2, PA and NP. Several substitutions in the
polymerase complex proteins are implicated in the virulence of the influenza viruses [32,33]. Previous studies
showed that most of the host-specific markers that discriminate between human and avian influenza viruses are
located in viral RNPs [34,35]. Our analysis indicates the
clear avian origin of the studied viruses with two exceptions; substitution E627K in PB2 has been shown to be
important for adaptation of avian viruses to replication in
mammalian hosts, and interestingly, our sequence analysis showed that viruses isolated in mink and concomitant
H10 viruses carry a glutamic acid (E) at position 627
which is typically found in avian viruses, while chicken/
49-like human viruses have a lysine (K) substitution at
position 627 of PB2. This substitution has been shown to
be the main determinant of the pathogenicity of avian
influenza viruses in mammalian hosts and results in
increased replication of viruses in the upper respiratory
tract of mice and ferrets [17,36-38]. Substitution D701N
in polymerase protein PB2 has been implicated in the
adaptation of H5N1 viruses to replication and high
pathogenicity in mammalian hosts [35], this being the
same substitution as seen in mink/84.
The recently discovered PB1-F2, a 90-amino-acid peptide translated from an alternative reading frame of the
PB1 gene, induces apoptosis in infected cells [39]. The

Page 4 of 11

substitution N66S resulted in a more severe infection
with higher virus titres and increased production of
inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of infected mice
[40]. None of the viruses presented in this study contained the N66S substitution. Similarity percentages for
the gene segments of the RNP complex varied from 88 to
95% for the PA gene to 90-100% for the PB1-F2 at the
nucleotide level.
Phylogenetic relationships were inferred for each of the
gene segments of the RNP complex. All virus genes
belong to the Eurasian avian lineage with the exception of
the PB1 gene of whistlingswan/88. With regards to the
PB1 gene, the whistlingswan/88 virus formed a sister
branch with the main American avian lineage of H10
viruses, indicating the reassortment with genes belonging
to the American avian gene pool (Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis showed that the M genes of the
H10 viruses presented in this study are closely related to
each other and all belong to the Eurasian avian lineage of
the influenza A viruses. Four amino acids substitutions
(L26F, V27A or T, A30T or V and S31N or R) at the M2
gene have been shown to be associated with resistance to
amantadine [41], an anti-influenza drug commonly used
in humans. Analysis of M2 protein amino acid sequences
showed that the H10 isolates are all sensitive to amantadine.
Two distinct gene pools of the non structural gene
(NS), corresponding to allele A and allele B [42,43], were
present among the studied H10 viruses. The NS gene of
mink/84 clustered together with mallard/85, fowl/85 and
whistlingswan/88 in allele A within the Eurasian avian
lineage and it was clearly distinct from the NS of chicken/
49, which formed a single branch as the only Eurasian
avian H10 isolate among the allele B viruses (Figure 3).
The NS1 genes of the H10 viruses reported in this study
consisted of 890 nucleotides; there were no deletions or
insertions. Nucleotide sequence identities of the NS1
gene in allele A were 95-100%, however there was 63%
nucleotide identity and 69% amino acid identity between
mink/84 in allele A and chicken/49 in allele B.
Several studies have identified significant amino acid
motifs associated with the increased virulence of avian
influenza viruses in human (D92E) and chickens (V149A)
[37,44]. All the H10 viruses in our study contained 92D
and 149A. Obenauer and colleagues (2006) proposed that
the four C-terminal amino acid residues of the NS1 act as
a PDZ binding motif that may represent a virulence
determinant. PDZ domains are protein-interacting
domains that are involved in a variety of cell signalling
pathways. In addition, Obenauer and colleagues (2006)
showed that there were typical human, avian, equine and
swine motifs [45]. All the H10 viruses possessed the typical avian ESEV amino acid sequence at the C-terminal
end of the NS1 protein.

investigate the possible influence of different genes on the
virulence of these H10 avian influenza viruses in mink.
Of those amino acid residues previously described as virulence factors influencing the outcome of the avian influenza virus infection in mammalian species only one was

present in the H10 viruses studied here. Although Hatta
et al. (2001) found that only a single amino acid substitution E627K of the PB2 contributes to efficient replication,
effective transmission and virulence of H5N1 influenza
virus in mammalian species [17], it seems that the existence of this mutation in PB2 of chicken/49 does not
influence the virulence of this virus in mink. There were
no differences in receptor specificity or the cleavability of
the haemagglutinin proteins between H10 viruses that

were shown to be of low or high pathogenicity in mink.
Differences in pathogenicity and virulence between
mink/84 and chicken/49 isolates could be related to clear
amino acid differences in the NS1 protein.
The multifunctional influenza A NS1 protein is the
most well studied of the IFN antagonistic proteins [4648]. Mutant influenza A virus with truncated NS1 proteins are unable to replicate efficiently in normal cell cul-

tures, and require either cells deficient in IFN-α/β
production, or mice with a dysfunctional STAT 1 gene to
replicate [49-52]. Several publications indicate that the
NS1 protein exerts its antagonistic activity by inhibiting
the dsRNA-mediated activation of protein kinase R and
the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and IRF-3
[53-57]. On the other hand, others claim the primary
function of NS1 RNA binding to be inhibition of the 2'-5'-

Zohari et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:145
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/145

oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway [58].
Recently, interactions between NS1A and the cytoplasmic RNA helicase RIG-1 have been demonstrated, leading to inhibition of the RIG-1 mediated induction of IFNβ [59,60]. NS1 has also been related directly to virulence
[37,44].
To determine whether some functional differences
between the NS1 protein of mink/84 and chicken/49 isolates could explain the diversity in pathogenicity and virulence of these viruses in mink, a luciferase-based
reporter system was used to test the effect of these proteins on IFN β promoter activity in poly I:C stimulated
mink lung cells.
Cell samples transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vector
produced the highest level of IFN promoter activity following poly I:C stimulation, and this activity level was
used as a reference (set to 100%) when comparing to the
rest of the samples. Samples transfected with the two NS1
proteins both exerted a negative effect on IFN promoter
activity (Figure 4). The downregulation was stronger for
pNS-mink/84 carrying the allele A NS gene of mink/48
virus, with an average 6.8-fold decrease (14.7%), while
pNS-chicken/49 on average produced a 1.4-fold decrease
(68.5%) in promoter activity compared to the reference
(i.e. poly I:C stimulated cells transfected with empty
pcDNA3.1 vector and reporter gene pISRE-TA-Luc).
Although both proteins downregulate the IFN β promoter, the effect of the pNS-chicken/49 proteins on IFN
β promoter activity was considerably weaker than that of
pNS-mink/84. Production of Type I interferons (interferons α/β) represents a crucial early event in the innate
immune response to viral infection [61-63].

Page 7 of 11

Putative amino acid sequence analysis indicated that
the sites previously been described important for the specific function of NS1 protein are similar between both
NS1 of mink/84 and Chicken/49. Interestingly, one difference was noticed in the site that is considered crucial for
the interaction of NS1 with the 30kDa subunit of cleavage
and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30). The
CPSF30 is responsible for the efficient 3'-end processing
of cellular pre-mRNA including IFN-b mRNA. This
interaction of NS1 with CPSF30 inhibits the 3'-end processing and thus results in inhibition of cellular premRNAs export from the nucleus [66,67]. Structural studies indicated that two distinct domains mediate this interaction: glutamic acid at the residue 186 (Glu186) [68] and
phenylalanine and methionine at the residues 103
(Phe103) and 106 (Met106), respectively [69]. The NS1
protein of mink/84 possessed the amino acid Glu186,
Phe103 and Met106, whereas the NS1 protein of
Chicken/49 caries Tyr103, instead of Phe103. It was proposed earlier by Kochs and colleagues [69] that mutations
at the NS1 protein and CPSF30 interaction sites dramatically changed the effect of the NS1 to control host gene
expression. Thus, the effects we demonstrated here might
be due to the difference in the ability of these NS1s to
interfere with the cleavage and polyadenylation of IFN-β
mRNA and hence suppressed IFN-β expression been
observed.

Conclusions
The NS gene of mink/84 appears to have contributed to
the virulence of the virus in mink by helping the virus
evade the innate immune responses. Thus, future studies
are required to elucidate the mechanisms by which the
NS1 protein evades innate immunity and promotes the
virulence of H10 viruses.

PCR

The conditions for the RT-PCRs for the different fragments were optimized to give a uniform protocol. For this
purpose, the QIAGEN One-Step RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN)
was applied in a 25 μl reaction volume that comprised 5
μl of 5×buffer, 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mix, 1 μl of each forward and reverse primer (10 pmol/μl), 1 μl of 40 U/μl
RNAguard (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1 μl of
enzyme, and 1 μl of template. The temperature profile
was as follows: 30 minutes at 50°C for reverse transcription, 15 min at 95°C for activation of the polymerase, and
then 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 52°C for 30 sec, and
72°C for 90 sec, followed by a 5 min final extension at
72°C.
Sequence analysis

The primers for RT-PCR were segment specific but subtype universal, targeting the highly conserved regions at

the 5'- and 3'-end of each segment (Table 1). PCR products were purified with the Wizard Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) prior to
sequencing. The sequencing reaction was performed by
an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminators v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions
were run on a 3100 DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Sequencing was performed at least twice in each direction.
Sequence assembly, multiple alignments and alignment
trimming, nucleotide sequence translation into protein
sequence and processing were performed with the BioEdit software v.7.0.4.1 [70] with an engine based on the
Clustal W algorithm [71]. The phylogenetic analysis,
based on complete gene nucleotide sequences, was conducted using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis

group consisted of six wells in which three were poly I:C

the cells with the poly I:C was performed 24 hours after
transfection of pcDNA3.1/NS1 plasmid, through the
addition of 5 μg/ml poly I:C mixed in 100 μl DMEM without serum. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were harvested according to the protocol for the luciferase assay
kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), using 300 μl lysis
buffer for each well. Samples were kept on ice and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g for removal of the cell debris
prior to measurement of the luciferase activity. Luciferase
activities were measured using 20 μl of each sample
according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Construction of expression plasmids

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The NS1 genes of influenza A virus strains A/mink/Sweden/3900/84 and A/chicken/Germany/N/49 were amplified by using the primers NS1Kpn 5' (5'-ATTCGGTACC
AGCAAAAGCAGGGTGACAAAG-3') and NS1XhoI 3'
(5'-TACCCTCGAGGCTATCAAACTTCTGACTCAATTGTTCTC-3'). The 690 bp PCR products were digested
with Kpn and XhoI and cloned between the Kpn and XhoI
sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1
(Invitrogen), creating pNS-mink/84 and pNS-chicken/49
plasmid respectively. The integrity of the PCR products
was confirmed by sequencing.

IFN β promoter luciferase assay

Cell culture and transfection experiments

The mink lung cells were obtained from the Swedish
National Veterinary Institute. The mink lung cells were
routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 5% FCS in a well humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
The transcriptional activity of the IFN-β promoter was
assayed in mink lung cells. Cells were co-transfected with
a plasmid containing either the NS gene of mink/84 or
chicken/49 together with a reporter plasmid driving
expression of Firefly luciferase (pISRE-TA-Luc) (Invitrogen) under control of the interferon-stimulated response
element (ISRE), the IFN-β promoter. The pRen-Luc plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene (Invitrogen)
was used as the luciferase control. The luciferase activities of the reporter gene were standardized by Renilla
luciferase activity. NS1 activity was expressed as folds of
luciferase activity.
Transfection of the plasmids was conducted with
FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA) in six-well plates
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Initial
experiments were conducted to increase the efficiency of
the transfection protocol. The day before transfection,
MiLu-cells were collected, and seeded into six-well plates
at 1×105 cells per well in order to achieve 70%-80% confluence on the day of transfection. Each transfection
