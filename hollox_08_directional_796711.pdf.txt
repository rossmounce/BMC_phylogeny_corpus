Abstract
Background: In primates, infection is an important force driving gene evolution, and this is
reflected in the importance of infectious disease in human morbidity today. The beta-defensins are
key components of the innate immune system, with antimicrobial and cell signalling roles, but also
reproductive functions. Here we examine evolution of beta-defensins in catarrhine primates and
variation within different human populations.
Results: We show that five beta-defensin genes that do not show copy number variation in
humans show evidence of positive selection in catarrhine primates, and identify specific codons that
have been under selective pressure. Direct haplotyping of DEFB127 in humans suggests long-term
balancing selection: there are two highly diverged haplotype clades carrying different variants of a
codon that, in primates, is positively selected. For DEFB132, we show that extensive diversity,
including a four-state amino acid polymorphism (valine, isoleucine, alanine and threonine at position
93), is present in hunter-gatherer populations, both African and non-African, but not found in
samples from agricultural populations.
Conclusion: Some, but not all, beta-defensin genes show positive selection in catarrhine primates.
There is suggestive evidence of different selective pressures on these genes in humans, but the
nature of the selective pressure remains unclear and is likely to differ between populations.

Background
A rapid response to counter and contain microbial infection is provided by the innate immune system in all multicellular organisms. A key component of the innate
immune response is the broad spectrum of antimicrobial
proteins that can either be constitutively expressed on epithelia or be induced during inflammation [1,2]. There is
evidence for extensive diversity of antimicrobial proteins,
with different genes arising by duplication followed by
positive adaptive selection [3-5]. Analysing the history of
duplication and sequence variation of these antimicrobial
genes will help us to understand how selection by infec-

tious diseases has led to functional adaptation at the
molecular level.
The beta-defensins are a family of genes which has key
roles in the innate immune response, such as antimicrobial activity, antiviral activity and signalling [1]. Some
members have also been shown to have an important role
in reproduction – for example the protein encoded by
DEFB126 coats the sperm surface and mediates attachment of the sperm to the oviduct [6,7]. Evolutionary analyses of the beta-defensins have produced evidence for
repeated rounds of duplication and divergence of the
mature peptide by positive selection. Most convincing are

studies which show rapid duplication and divergence of
beta-defensin genes since mouse and rat divergence, supporting a birth-and-death model for beta-defensin evolution in the rodents [8,9].
Infectious disease is likely to have been a major selective
agent in human evolution [10]. Changes of habitat and of
social system during evolution of hominids, and other
primates, alter the spectrum of infectious diseases encountered at different times and by different species. Aspects of
more recent human evolution are also likely to have been
driven by infectious disease: archaeological evidence suggests that individuals in agricultural populations would
have suffered more from "crowd diseases" compared to
hunter-gatherers, due to the proximity of domestic animals and of each other [11,12]. As well as an increase in
infectious disease, the transition from hunter-gatherer to
farmer is likely to have had an effect on the genes of the
different populations in other ways, such as changes in
diet and reproductive behaviour [13].
In order to understand the evolutionary pressures on betadefensins in primates, we determined putative orthologues of human beta-defensins from six other catarrhine
primate species: chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla
(Gorilla gorilla), orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), gibbon
(Hylobates lar), long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis)
and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). We used the
known branching order of the primate phylogeny,
together with a maximum-likelihood approach using different models of evolution, to test whether positive selection has acted on these genes. Analysing selection in the
catarrhine lineage allowed us to identify specific codons
in certain beta-defensins that showed a response to environmental change over the last 25 million years. By analysing the variation in these genes in a cohort of huntergatherer and agricultural human populations, we infer
their more recent evolution and discuss whether population-specific selection processes are responsible for the
patterns of variation.

Results
Comparative sequence analysis
The beta-defensin gene family is defined by a six-cysteine
core motif (C-X6-C-X4-C-X9-C-X6-C-C) which was previously used as a motif to search the genome for additional
beta-defensins [14]. Some of these were confirmed to
encode full-length mRNA transcripts and code for proteins whose amino acid sequence differed considerably
outside the shared core motif [14,15]. This coding
sequence difference between beta-defensin genes continues into intronic sequence, so that both coding sequence
and intronic sequence can define clear orthologues
between humans, chimpanzees and rhesus macaques. In
addition, according to the current genome assemblies

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/113

(panTro2 and rheMac2) the expected syntenic relationships are maintained across these three species. By designing primers in non-coding sequences that clearly
distinguish between beta-defensin genes, we identified
and sequenced putative orthologues in six primate species
of coding sequences for all 17 beta-defensin genes for
which full-length transcript evidence existed in humans at
the start of the project (supplementary figure 1; sequence
accession numbers given in supplementary table 1).
Using the information from the known phylogeny of the
primate species, we assessed the orthologous sequences
for evidence of positive selection. We analysed the ratio
(ω) between the non-synonymous substitution rate and
the synonymous substitution rate, using a maximum-likelihood technique implemented by the program PAML.
This uses models that allow rates of evolution to vary
between codons, so allowing the identification of specific
positions likely to have undergone positive selection
[16,17]. Five genes showed evidence of positive selection:
DEFB1, DEFB118, DEFB120, DEFB127 and DEFB132
(table 1). Codon 71 of DEFB127 has been positively
selected and is very variable between species (figure 1a),
and analysis of ancestral sequences suggests that this
codon has independently mutated five times during primate evolution (figure 1b).
Copy number analysis
We and others have previously shown a cluster of betadefensin genes (DEFB4, DEFB103, DEFB104, DEFB105,
DEFB106, DEFB107) to be copy number variable in
humans; the neighbouring DEFB1 gene is not involved in
this copy number variation [18-20]. It is essential to
understand whether a gene is copy number variable in
order to correctly interpret apparently heterozygous SNP
sites, and to be aware of the possibility of gene conversion
between closely related paralogues.

We used multiplex amplifiable probe hybridisation
(MAPH) to examine whether other members of the betadefensin family varied in copy number, in addition to
those previously described. MAPH is a method for gene
copy number analysis that relies on quantitative recovery
of amplifiable probes following hybridisation to genomic
DNA [21,22]. Using MAPH probes for the beta-defensin
gene regions analysed in this study, we asked whether
there was any evidence of copy number variation in the 37
DNA samples used for the population analyses described
in this paper, and in a further 153 individuals from the
UK. We reasoned that variation between duplicate tests of
individuals would be highly correlated where underlying
copy number variation was the main cause of the variation, but less correlated, if at all, when the main cause was
random experimental noise. The correlation between the
two sets of raw MAPH results for 190 samples was calcu-

lated, and the probes mapping to the copy number variable region at 8p23.1 showed high correlation coefficients
(0.70<r<0.96). All other beta-defensin probes showed
correlation coefficients less than 0.52 (supplementary
table 2), and there was no grouping of samples on scatterplots indicative of rarer deletion or duplication polymorphisms.
Population analyses
The second exon, which codes for the entire mature peptide, was resequenced from all five beta-defensins that
showed positive selection, in a panel of 37 individuals
from four human populations. Twenty polymorphic sites
were found, of which 16 are predicted to change an amino
acid, and only 5 are present in dbSNP release 126
(rs16995685, rs12624954, rs2738047, rs16995668,

rs1800957 - please see NCBI webpage in Availability and
requirements section).
The number of synonymous and non-synonymous polymorphic sites and fixed differences between the human
and macaque exon 2 sequence was determined (table 2).
A McDonald-Kreitman test was performed on each gene,
and on the pooled results, to test for an excess of non-synonymous fixed substitutions which suggests the influence
of positive selection of the gene [23]. None of the tests
showed significant evidence of selection (data not
shown), in contrast to the results obtained from the ωtests using PAML. This difference could be due to the
small number of changes and polymorphic sites in each
test, which is a reflection of the small size of the genes; but
pooling the data from all five genes also failed to show a

significant result. More plausibly, the discrepancy could
be due to the high numbers of non-synonymous polymorphisms identified in humans (16 in total, compared
with 4 synonymous polymorphisms). Five of these are
singletons, but eleven were identified in two or more samples, suggesting that they may be at appreciable frequencies in different populations.
We analysed the frequencies of the polymorphisms in
four different population samples: hunter-gatherers
Mbuti/Biaka (MB) and Indigenous Australian (IA), and
agriculturalists British (UK) and sub-Saharan African
(SSA) (table 2). A Fisher's exact test of independence
between Africans and non-Africans reveals significant differences in allele frequency for many polymorphisms, as
expected. The strongest differences in allele frequencies
were for the R71S and G31R polymorphic sites in
DEFB127. Two DNA polymorphisms, both affecting
codon site 93 in DEFB132, showed significantly different
frequencies between agricultural and hunter-gather populations.
Analysis of DEFB127 and DEFB132
We decided to study the haplotype structure of both
DEFB127 and DEFB132 genes by complete resequencing.
For DEFB132, resequencing 292 bases spanning exon 2
from 74 chromosomes revealed 10 polymorphic sites
associating to form 14 haplotypes, inferred from diplotype data by maximum-likelihood analysis (supplementary table 3). For DEFB127, resequencing 3208 bases
spanning exons 1 and 2 in 74 human chromosomes
revealed 36 polymorphic sites associated to form 30 haplotypes, determined unambiguously by allele-specific

PCR (supplementary table 4). We analysed the forces
affecting variation at different loci by calculating various
summary statistics from the haplotype data at both
DEFB127 and DEFB132 in each population (table 3).
Both genes show high values for gene diversity (π), indicating a high degree of heterozygosity in all populations.
There are four estimates of the population mutation
parameter (θ), derived from levels of homozygosity (θH),
number of segregating sites (θs), nucleotide diversity (θπ),
and the expected number of alleles (θk).
Tajima's D compares the distribution of rare frequency
alleles with intermediate frequency alleles by comparing
θs with θπ. DEFB127 gives a significantly negative value for
the MB and a significantly positive value for the UK population, which may indicate balancing selection. However, this statistic is known to be sensitive to demographic
changes: a negative value may result from a population
expansion and a positive value from population subdivision. Fay and Wu's H statistic compares the distribution of
common frequency alleles with intermediate frequency
alleles by comparing θH with θπ, and is more robust to
demographic changes [24]. For DEFB127, D, H, and Fu's
Fs are all significantly negative for the MB population,
which suggests directional selection in this population.
For DEFB127, Tajima's D is significantly positive in the
UK population reflection a signal of either balancing
selection or population subdivision.

A mismatch distribution is a histogram showing the
number of mismatches when all haplotypes are compared
with each other, and describes the haplotype structure of

DEFB127 and figure 2b shows the mismatch distributions
for DEFB132. On each graph the expected distribution
given neutrality with a constant population size is shown
(dashed line), and the expected distribution given a recent
population expansion is also shown (solid line).
For DEFB127, all distributions are characterised by a
strong bimodal pattern inconsistent with a model reflecting neutrality, constant population size or a population
expansion. In each distribution, the second peak is at
around 20 differences, with the exception of SSA, where
the second peak is at around 8 differences. The strongest
bimodal distribution is in the UK population, reflecting
two deep haplotype clades at similar frequency, and suggests balancing selection at this locus in this population.
This supports the result from the Tajima's D test. For
DEFB132, the SSA, UK and MB populations show a bimodal distribution also inconsistent with a model reflecting
neutrality, constant population size or a population
expansion. For the IA population, the distribution is more
consistent with neutrality, either with a constant population size or an expansion.

linked to other haplotypes that differ by one nucleotide
position. They also convey haplotype frequency and distribution information by the size and composition of the
pie chart at each node. Analysis of the haplotype network
for DEFB127 reveals that the bimodal mismatch distribution reflects haplotypes carrying a glycine at position 31
and an arginine at position 71 (G31R71) and a highly
diverged haplotype clade carrying an arginine at position
31 and a serine at position 71 (R31S71) (figure 3a).
The DEFB132 haplotypes are shown on a network diagram together with the root haplotype (figure 3b). There
are four coding alleles at codon 93: valine, which is ancestral and the most common; alanine, which is observed in
MB population and one SSA individual; threonine, seen
only in the IA and MB; and isoleucine, seen in one IA individual. This suggests that some ancient haplotypes carrying the coding variation at codon 93 have persisted in
geographically dispersed hunter-gatherer populations.
This could be due to absence of purifying selection that
has operated in agricultural populations [25]. The network shows a reticulation and several branches caused
either by recurrent mutation or recombination – only polymorphisms 4, 5, 6 and 7 occur on one branch of the network.

Genomic region analysis
Analysis using HapMap data [26] shows that both
diverged DEFB127 haplotypes are present in European,
Chinese and Japanese, extending as an essentially nonrecombining haplotype block for about 25 kb, but neither
the R31S71 haplotype nor its constituent alleles are found
in the Yoruba from Nigeria (data not shown). Using the
CEPH HapMap data, an EHH test was performed to analyse for signatures of recent selection [27]. No haplotype
has extended haplotype homozygosity with respect to the
other, suggesting that the observed frequencies were not
generated by recent positive selection for one or other
haplotype (data not shown). It is unclear why the R31S71
haplotype is not seen in the SSA population nor in the
Nigerian Yoruba HapMap population. There are three
possible explanations: that it has been carried across the
world in the out of Africa expansion, and has been lost in
certain populations by drift; that it has been maintained
in certain populations by balancing selection; or it is a
product of a relatively recent hybridisation event.

To exclude selection at another linked gene being responsible for this haplotype pattern, we first examined the
extent of linkage disequilibrium across this region in the
CEPH HapMap samples. The only other gene on the same
haplotype block, and therefore possibly associated with
DEFB127, was DEFB126, 15 kb away. Resequencing of
exon 2 of DEFB126 found two deletion polymorphisms
which substantially altered the C-terminal tail amino acid
sequence of DEFB126 (Hollox and Armour, unpublished
data). These were candidate functional polymorphisms
that could have caused a selective sweep affecting polymorphism frequencies and association at DEFB127. To
investigate this, we genotyped 141 Northern European
individuals for the two polymorphisms at DEFB127
(G31R and R71S) and the two deletion polymorphisms in
DEFB126. Maximum-likelihood estimation found no evidence of linkage disequilibrium between the markers at
DEFB127 and at DEFB126 (r2 = 0.05), although there was
very strong association (r2 = 0.98) between the two polymorphic sites within DEFB127 (data not shown). Therefore there is no evidence of a selective sweep driven by
these variant alleles at DEFB126.

Discussion
We have identified five beta-defensin genes that have
undergone positive selection in primates, including
DEFB118 and DEFB1, whose protein products show evidence of direct antimicrobial action in urogenital tissues
[28,29]. The selected position in DEFB1 has been shown
to be directly involved in antimicrobial activity and signalling [30], and natural selection has modulated its
charge and polarity in response to the microbial environment. The results broadly agree with a previous analysis of
the 8p23.1 cluster [31]: we agree that there is no support

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/113

for the previously suggested effect of selection on the
amino acid sequence of DEFB4 [32]. More generally, we
note that the genes on 8p23.1 that are variable in copy
number among humans show no evidence of positive
selection in the last 25 million years. This could be
because the copy number variable beta-defensins tend to
be shorter, and the analyses lack power when analysing
short coding sequences. Alternatively, there could be a
causal association between copy number variation and
the likelihood of coding sequence diversification by positive selection. In primates and the dog, the chromosome
8 cluster does not seem to have undergone as much duplication and rapid divergence since species divergence as
rodents [31,33]. In horses, there appears to have been a
rapid duplication and divergence of the DEFB4 orthologue [34], and a similar process may have occurred in
goats [35]. It also appears that the DEFB106 and DEFB107
orthologues have been positively selected in the Old
World Monkey Cercopithecus aethiops [31], so further
investigation in different catarrhine clades, as well as platyrrhines and other primates, is necessary. The question
remains whether, in copy number variable genes, extensive divergence is prevented by purifying selection and
gene conversion, or by balancing selection maintaining a
pool of similar variants that are shuffled by gene conversion. Determining whether the same loci are copy number
variable loci between different primates, and whether
copy number variation exists in other mammals, will help
to answer this question.
We have used a top-down evolutionary approach to identify variation in genes that is likely to be functional, and
has been driven by selection. In doing so, we have
revealed high levels of beta-defensin diversity in human
populations, but the forces driving this diversity are difficult to identify. DEFB127 diversity involves two positions
that distinguish two deep-rooting haplotypes, suggesting
that there are epistatic interactions between the two
amino acids and that both haplotypes have been preserved by balancing selection. Balancing selection has
been suggested to maintain variation at several other
innate immune genetic loci, such as CD209L cell-surface
receptor [36] and the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) [37], and at loci involved in reproduction, such
as zonadhesin [38]. By chemical synthesis, reconstruction
and folding of the core N-terminal sequence, DEFB127
was shown not to have antimicrobial activity [39]. However, DEFB127, like several other beta-defensins, is
expressed in the epidydimis and may be involved in
sperm maturation or reproduction. Evidence for directional selection in the Mbuti/Biaka population indicates
contrasting selection pressures in different populations
due the different environmental pressures that these populations have faced. Whether balancing selection has been
a major force in the human genome is disputed, and dis-

tinguishing signatures of balancing selection from neutral
variation is difficult without a clear prior hypothesis concerning the potential mechanism of balancing selection in
a given candidate gene [40].
DEFB132 has been positively selected in the catarrhine
lineage, and is highly variable in human populations.
However, in humans there is only evidence from mismatch distribution analysis of any statistical departure
from neutral evolution at this locus, though the power of
the analyses could be limited by the small region analysed. One codon is polymorphic in hunter gatherer populations, coding for four amino acids (V/A/T/I), but in
agricultural populations 39 out of 40 chromosomes carry
a valine at this position. Genetic differentiation tests
reveal a similar contrast between agricultural and huntergatherer populations; as expected African and non-African
populations are significantly differentiated for both
DEFB127 (Hst permutation test, p = 0.008) and DEFB132
(p < 0.0001), but for DEFB132 the agricultural and nonagricultural populations are also differentiated (p <
0.0001). The basis for any selective pressure is
unclear:DEFB132 is expressed in the testis, and possibly
elsewhere, is secreted and is likely to be antimicrobial
although that has not been directly tested [15].
We have shown that beta-defensins have different patterns of selection, and one of the selected amino acids has
been shown to be antimicrobial and involved in cell-cell
signalling. The challenge will be to relate evolutionary
changes in amino acid sequences to differences in antimicrobial, cell-signalling or sperm function. Both a comprehensive picture of the evolution of these genes by
identifying orthologues in other mammalian species, and
a concurrent effort into characterising the function of
these orthologues, is needed in order to fully understand
the role of this gene family in innate immunity and reproduction.

Conclusion
Several beta-defensin genes show positive selection in
catarrhine primates, including DEFB127, DEFB118 and
DEFB1, but not the beta-defensin genes involved in common copy number variation on chromosome 8p23.1.
There is suggestive evidence of different selective pressures
on these genes in humans, with DEFB127 showing evidence of balancing selection. Given the multifunctional
role of the beta-defensin family, however, the nature of
the selective pressure remains unclear and is likely to differ between populations.

Methods
DNA samples
Genomic DNA from five primates (Macaca fascicularis –
long-tailed macaque, Hylobates lar – gibbon, Pongo pyg-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/113

maeus – orangutan, Gorilla gorilla – lowland gorilla, Pan
troglodytes – common chimpanzee) was extracted from
lymphoblastoid cell lines at the European Collection of
Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, UK). DNA from
10 native British individuals (UK) was chosen randomly
from the ECACC control panel 1, DNA from 10 Indigenous Australian individuals (IA) and 7 sub-Saharan Africans (SSA, 5 Zulu, 1 Kikuyu, 1 Ghanaian) was obtained
from ECACC, and DNA from 10 Mbuti/Biaka "Pygmy"
individuals living in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(MB) was obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (New
Jersey, USA). DNA from 153 British individuals resident
in non-urban Nottinghamshire was used for copy number
analysis, and was from a cohort described previously [41].
PCR, sequencing, and copy number analysis
20 ng of genomic DNA was amplified using a standard
PCR mix: 0.2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 1 mM
MgCl2, 75 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25°C), 20 mM
(NH4)2SO4, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 in a final volume of 20
μl, with 10 pmol of each primer, 0.5 units Taq DNA
polymerase (ABgene), followed by thermal cycling for 35
cycles at 95°C 30 seconds, 58°C 1 minute 70°C 1 minute.
Amplification from human DNA successfully produced a
single band and lower annealing temperature (typically
5°C less than the calculated Tm at 50 mM salt) for the first
5 cycles was used to minimise the risk of unexpected
allele- or paralogue-specific amplification in non-human
samples. If, after repeated reduction in annealing temperature, amplification did not result in a single band, primers were redesigned. In a few cases, amplification products
could not be generated.

PCR products were prepared for sequencing either using a
Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen), eluted in water, or the
Ampure SPRI method (Agencourt Bioscience). 5 μl of the
solution (~100–250 ng) was then sequenced using
BigDye 3.1, following the manufacturer's instructions
(Applied Biosystems). Free dye was removed either by ethanol precipitation, or by the Cleanseq SPRI method
(Agencourt Bioscience). Sequencing reactions were electrophoresed on an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer by the
DNA Sequencing Service at the Biochemistry Department,
University of Oxford, and analysed manually using
FinchTV (Geospiza). Putative orthologue coding
sequences were assembled by alignment with human
sequences and submitted to EMBL sequence database
(accession numbers in supplementary table 1). In all
cases, human DNA was amplified and sequenced using
the same primers as for the other primates, and confirmed
to be from the correct gene using BLAT against the human
genome assembly build 34. M. mulatta orthologues were
identified from the genome assembly by BLAT searching
using the M. fascicularis DNA sequence. In all cases, one
unique match was identified.

Population resequencing was carried out essentially as
above. All polymorphic sites which were only seen as heterozygotes or singletons were sequenced off both strands
in those individuals.
Multiplex Amplifiable Probe Hybridisation (MAPH) and
Restriction Enzyme Digest Variant Ratios were performed
as previously described [22,42], with fluorescent detection of amplification products by an Applied Biosystems
3100 Genetic Analyzer. MAPH involves hybridisation of
short amplifiable probes to genomic DNA immobilised
on a nylon filter. Following stringent washing, the bound
probes are released and amplified using a pair of primer
sites common to all probes. One primer is fluorescently
labelled so that the resulting PCR product can be run on a
capillary electrophoresis machine and quantified. The
area under the probe peak is directly proportional to the
number of sites for that probe in the immobilised
genomic DNA.
We constructed a set of MAPH probes consisting of test
probes mapping to individual beta-defensin genes and
reference probes that have been shown to be non-variable
in copy number [43]. The values for each test probe were
normalised for lane intensity against the reference probes,
and duplicate values plotted on a scatterplot and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) calculated for each probe
across all tested samples. Scatterplots were also visually
inspected for outliers along the x = y diagonal axis. The
error rate was calculated by extrapolating the mean (μ = 1)
and standard deviation (σ = 0.08) of the duplicate samples of the reference probes to a predicted distribution of
measurements of duplication alleles with mean 1.5 μ and
standard deviation σ √ 1.5. Assuming a normal Gaussian
distribution, the probability of obtaining a value less than
1.3 (threshold for detecting duplications) from this distribution is 2%.
The MAPH probe for DEFB127 did not give reproducible
results, and copy number variation at this gene was
excluded by performing REDVR on both the G31R
(rs12624954) and R71S (rs16995685) polymorphic sites.
REDVR involves PCR amplification across a restriction
enzyme site that varies between copies with a pair of primers, one being fluorescently labelled. This is followed by
restriction enzyme digestion and quantification of the two
peaks produces a ratio of cut to uncut products.
Haplotype determination
In order to determine haplotypes at DEFB127 from individuals who were heterozygous at more than one site,
allele specific PCR (AS-PCR) was performed using primers
with a 3'LNA base (Sigma-Proligo), which enhances pyrimidine-purine mismatch determination [44]. Polymorphic sites used for AS-PCR are shown in supplementary

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/113

table 4. PCR products from both haplotypes were
sequenced.
For DEFB132, haplotypes were inferred from the diplotype data using the maximum-likelihood Bayesian
approach implemented by PHASE2 [45]. 13 samples were
heterozygous at two or more sites, and the phase probabilities of all inferred sites was >0.95, with the exception
of four sites where the probabilities were 0.93 and 0.94.
For comparison, inferring haplotypes at DEFB127 from
the diplotype data resulted in 19 inferred sites with phase
probabilities less than 0.90. This is likely to be due to the
high number of haplotypes in Africans that were observed
in only one individual, and that differ from each other by
more than one site (supplementary figure 4a).
Interspecific analyses
Putative orthologous DNA sequence of each betadefensin was aligned by ClustalW using the default
parameters except a low gap extension penalty (0.05),
using the computer server at the European Bioinformatics
Institute (see Availability and requirements section for
URL). Phylogenetic trees were constructed from alignments by maximum-likelihood using the program
DnaML, part of the Phylip 3.6 suite of programs [46]. Following assembly of the coding sequences of each gene, the
protein sequence was aligned using ClustalW with default
parameters. This protein alignment was used to inform
the codon-based alignment used by the maximum likelihood codon-based selection program PAML 3.14 [16].
Start and stop codons, and deletions, were removed from
the codon alignment.

An unrooted tree representing an accepted phylogeny of
the primates [47] was used in PAML – branch lengths were
not specified, and it was assumed that there was no difference in selective pressures across the branches (one ω
ratio). The proximity of nodes for human, chimpanzee
and gorilla raises the possibility that the phylogeny for
each gene is not the same as the phylogeny of the species,
where gorillas diverged first. In order to clarify the phylogeny at DEFB127, we resequenced the 3.2 kb spanning the
gene in chimpanzee and gorilla. There were no phylogenetically informative sites that allowed us to unambiguously
determine
the
human-chimpanzee-gorilla
branching pattern. Therefore the tree was described initially as a trifurcation in input files and the branching pattern allowed to vary as a free parameter so that results were
not dependant on constraining the tree to a specific
branch pattern at this node.
By fitting the data to two likelihood models in PAML, M1a
and M2a, we have a test of whether positive selection, as
defined by ω >1, has acted on a gene. M1a is the model
assuming a null hypothesis that all codons fall into two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/113

classes: either evolving neutrally (ω = 1) or with mild purifying selection (0< ω <1). M2a allows codons to fall into
another class: those showing positive selection (ω >1).
Therefore, by comparing the log likelihood of the data fitting model M1a with the log likelihood of the data fitting
model M2a, a significance level is obtained testing the
hypothesis that certain codons are under positive selection. The significance value is derived by calculating 2 ×
(log likelihood M1a – log likelihood M2a), and comparing the figure with a χ2 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. P < 0.05 is regarded as significant, with a Holm
correction for multiple tests [48].

mated using the equation τ = 2 ut, where u is the haplotype mutation parameter and t is time in generations. u
was estimated from the human-chimpanzee divergence at
each locus, K, given a divergence time of 6 million years
[57]. In African populations the expansion time was 1
Mya reflecting the expansion after the speciation of modern humans, and in non-African populations the time was
100 kya, reflecting the expansion out of Africa, and a generation time of 20 years was assumed.

Identification of codons that have experienced selection
were identified by a Bayes Empirical Bayes method implemented in PAML [49]. Briefly, the method calculates the
posterior probability that a given codon falls into the ω >1
class, as identified by the M2a model, accounting for the
maximum-likelihood estimate sampling errors of the
parameters in the model. Ancestral sequence reconstruction at each node, with probabilities at each codon site, is
also provided as output by PAML. Branch lengths on the
tree in figure 1 were generated by maximum likelihood
analysis of the coding sequence by baseml, part of PAML,
and the DEFB127 primate ancestral codon state was determined by a PAML codeml analysis of the primate
sequence, together with Canis familiaris and Bos taurus
orthologues.

Population genetic analyses
All estimates were performed using Arlequin 3.0 [50] or
DnaSP 4.0 [51], with haplotype reduced-median network
diagrams drawn using Network 4 (see Availability and
requirements section for URL)[52]. Significance for the
Tajima's D [53], Fu's Fs [54] and Fay and Wu's H [24] were
generated by comparing the observed distribution against
a simulated distribution generated by 1000 runs of a coalescent simulation algorithm, assuming population equilibrium and selective neutrality, with θ taking the value of
θs which is calculated from the observed data (table 3).

Genetic differentiation was analysed initially by 2 × 2 contingency tables of individual allele frequencies between
population groups, with significance assessed by Fisher's
Exact Test. A haplotype-based test, HST, was also used,
with significance assessed using a permutation test implemented by DnaSP 4.0 [55].
Mismatch distributions were calculated using DnaSP 4.0.
The expected distribution for an expanding population
was generated using the following population parameters
justified by published studies on human autosomal neutral loci [56]: pre-expansion population mutation parameter (θ0) = 1, post-expansion population mutation
parameter (θ1) = 10. The time from expansion (τ) was esti-
