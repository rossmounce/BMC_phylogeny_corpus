Abstract
Background: Exploiting genetic diversity requires previous knowledge of the extent and structure
of the variation occurring in a species. Such knowledge can in turn be used to build a corecollection, i.e. a subset of accessions that aim at representing the genetic diversity of this species
with a minimum of repetitiveness. We investigate the patterns of genetic diversity and population
structure in a collection of 346 inbred lines representing the breadth of naturally occurring diversity
in the Legume plant model Medicago truncatula using 13 microsatellite loci distributed throughout
the genome.
Results: We confirm the uniqueness of all these genotypes and reveal a large amount of genetic
diversity and allelic variation within this autogamous species. Spatial genetic correlation was found
only for individuals originating from the same population and between neighbouring populations.
Using a model-based clustering algorithm, we identified four main genetic clusters in the set of
individuals analyzed. This stratification matches broad geographic regions. We also identified a set
of "admixed" individuals that do not fit with this population structure scheme.
Conclusion: The stratification inferred is discussed considering potential historical events like
expansion, refuge history and admixture between neighbouring groups. Information on the allelic
richness and the inferred population structure are used to build a nested core-collection. The set
of inbred lines and the core collections are publicly available and will help coordinating efforts for
the study of naturally occurring variation in the growing Medicago truncatula community.

Background
In the last decade, model plants have been the subject of
rapid advances in genomics, including the completion of

the sequence of both Arabidopsis thaliana [1] and rice [2,3].
Knowledge gained from these studies and associated technological and methodological progresses create new pros-

pects in a variety of biological fields, including functional
and evolutionary genetics. This simultaneously renews
our interest in naturally occurring variation. Genomic
approaches to the study of natural variation should
increase our ability to understand gene function [4], while
the availability of sequence data from genome-wide
marker loci can provide new insights into the major historical and selective factors shaping the genetic diversity of
a species [5,6]. Such new prospects for plant natural variation will only be met if carefully constructed samples of
genotypes are used for characterizing patterns of naturally
occurring variation. This revives interest in analyzing
material currently available in germplasm collections.
Nearly a century has been spent collecting and preserving
genetic diversity in plants, resulting in worldwide collections, currently stored in international networks of seed
banks [7]. The large size of most of these collections however restricts the characterization of the material available,
and hinders their successful use.
To "unlock" the genetic potential of these large collections, a general proposal is to construct smaller "core-collections", i.e. sub-samples of accessions chosen to
represent the bulk of the genetic diversity contained in the
larger collection. Different sampling strategies have been
proposed. Genetic markers can be used to characterize the
genetic variation present in the collection. Such knowledge can lead to significant gains in the number of alleles
retained in a sample compared to random sampling. First,
the observed DNA profiles can be used to determine the
genetic uniqueness of each accession relative to all others
and to reduce redundancies in the collection. Second,
analysis of single or multilocus genotypes allows inference of genetic ancestry among accessions. A model-based
clustering algorithm that identifies groups with distinct
allele frequencies [8,9] can then be used to stratify the collection into a series of groups, even without prior information about the sampling locations of individuals.
Subsequently, core collections can be established by stratified sampling from the different groups [10]. An alternative way to use molecular information for sampling is to
use marker gene data as a way to score the allelic richness
of a sample. This approach, known as the Maximization
strategy, or hereafter M strategy, chooses the specific combination of accessions that maximizes the total allelic
richness at available marker loci [11]. Simulations
showed that the efficiency of this method is expected to
increase with increasing selfing rate and reduced gene
flow in the studied species [12]. These predictions were
recently validated using data from Arabidopsis thaliana
and, although the gain in diversity was rather modest
[13], the M strategy was used to build a set of nested core
collections that can be used as a "gateway" to explore naturally occurring diversity in this species.

Medicago truncatula recently emerged as a model species
for the analysis of development during microbial interactions and other aspects of legume genetics and genomics
[14]. Key attributes of this species include its small, diploid genome (~5*108 bp), its self-fertile nature and its
prolific seed production. Researchers are developing tools
and methods for molecular and genetic analysis [15], and
an international consortium is currently sequencing the
"gene space" of Medicago truncatula [16]. Through the use
of forward genetic strategies, these resources have already
enabled the identification of a number of new genes that
participate in the recognition of microbial and mycchorizal symbionts [17-21]. Until now, most studies in Medicago truncatula have focused on either a single reference
individual or a limited number of populations [22,23],
with the exception of one recent study of 192 accessions
[24]. In the present paper, we use a set of 13 microsatellite
markers to survey the genetic diversity occurring in a sample consisting of 346 inbred lines spanning the bulk of the
diversity that has been collected throughout the species
range to date (Table 1). First, we aimed to quantify the
neutral genetic diversity available in this collection and to
test for the presence of an underlying genetic structure in
this broad sample. In a second step, results from these
analyses are used to generate a set of nested core-collections for Medicago truncatula. This subset of inbred lines
represents the bulk of the diversity segregating in M. truncatula collected so far and is publicly available. These core
collections will help organize and coordinate current
efforts in the Medicago truncatula community to study patterns of variation at both the phenotypic and the molecular levels.

Results
Microsatellite diversity
A summary of the microsatellite polymorphism uncovered is presented in Table 3. The average number of alleles
per locus was NA = 20.7 but dropped to 5.8 when removing rare alleles (i.e. with a frequency lower than 0.05).
Averaged over loci, the gene diversity was HE = 0.75 with
large variation among loci (SD = 0.30; Table 3). Rare heterozygote genotypes were found for each of the studied
loci (HO > 0) but were dispersed across individuals [see
Additional file 5]. Among the 78 pairs of loci, 29 were
found to be in significant linkage disequilibrium (Table
4). These pairs involved all the loci studied except the two
less variable ones (MTIC126 and MTIC143) which were
in linkage equilibrium with all the other loci. Locus
MTPG85C contributed to 9 of the 29 statistically associated pairs of loci. Combining data from the 13 microsatellite loci, we found 346 different multilocus profiles,
thereby confirming the genetic uniqueness of each inbred
line in our sample.

Populations from the SARDI (AMGRC) collection were represented by a single individual.
1 among these 26 populations, 14 were collected in Corsica.
2 among these 15 populations 4 were collected in Crete.
3 the cultivated populations are: Borung, Caliph, Cyprus, Jemalong, Mogul, Paraggio and Sephi (we used 1 line per population except for Cyprus
which was represented by 2 lines).

Genetic structure of the collection
Spatial autocorrelation analyses conducted over the
whole sample revealed a weak signal of isolation by distance. Positive and significant associations between kinship coefficients and geographic proximities were found
only for individuals originating from the same location
(collected in the same natural population) and between
neighbouring populations. Similar analyses were conducted within two well-represented geographic regions:
Spain and Algeria. Kinship coefficients were of the same
order of magnitude and we did not find any clear evidence
for isolation by distance even at this restricted spatial scale
(data not shown).

We tested for the existence of a broad genetic stratification
in our sample, consisting in K underlying genetically
diverged groups (hereafter clusters), using microsatellite
data and the model based clustering algorithm implemented in the software Structure (see methods section for
details). To do so, we built a subsample of 266 accessions
representing each sampled location by a single (randomly
chosen) inbred line. Despite its smaller size compared to
the initial sample, this subset exhibited similar levels of
genetic diversity: mean NA = 19.8, mean HE = 0.75 (SD =

0.30). The pattern of linkage disequilibrium among loci
was also conserved, with 22 out of 66 possible pairs of loci
showing statistically significant associations (compared to
29 out of 78 pairs in the whole data set). Inspecting the
gain in likelihood of the data (n = 266) when modeling
the data using an increasing number of underlying clusters (from K = 1 to K = 8) yielded clear support for the
existence of a genetic structure in our sample. Consistent
estimates of Log Likelihood of the data across independent runs were obtained, with a slight variation between
runs for K = 5. Posterior probabilities of the data always
increased with increasing subdivision; the highest gain
occurred between K = 1 and K = 2 and we found an inconspicuous plateau between K = 4 and K = 5 [see Additional
file 2]. Independent runs produced highly consistent
results for all K values except for K = 3 and K = 8 which
yielded more than 30 inbred lines displaying inconsistent
assignation between runs (this was found in less than 10
cases for all the other investigated K values).
At K = 2, the inferred structure was totally stable across
runs and geographically consistent, isolating a set of 78
accessions originating from the South of Spain and from
Morocco (Figure 1a). This stratification accounted for

6.5% (FST = 0.065, p < 0.001) of the total genetic variance.
At K = 3, independent runs were less consistent, splitting
roughly the largest cluster obtained at K = 2 in two groups,
one being mainly represented by Algerian accessions. At K
= 4, approximately 65% of the accessions showed a proportion of membership higher than 0.6 into a group. Plotting these "well-assigned" accessions on a geographic map
showed that the clusters corresponded largely to major
geographic regions (Figure 1b). One cluster corresponded
to the cluster already observed at K = 2, i.e. grouping populations from Spain and Morocco (referred as cluster 2
hereafter). Another cluster consisted largely of individuals
collected in the South of France (hereafter cluster 4) while
the two last groups distinguished the North-Eastern (cluster 1) and the South-Eastern of the Mediterranean Basin
(cluster 3, see figure 1b). Plotting accessions with low partial membership (maximal proportion of membership
into a group lower than 0.6) blurred this geographic stratification (Figure 1c).
For K > 4, each increase in K split one of the clusters
obtained at previous K values. However, although the
posterior probability of the data slightly increased with
increasing K value, the mean proportion of membership
into the inferred clusters jointly decreased, with more and

more accessions showing a maximum membership into a
group lower than 0.6. This result combined with the plateau observed at K = 4 lead us to consider that the stratification observed at K = 4 was probably the most genuine
one. The highest probability run observed at K = 4 was
consequently used to define the different clusters. Finally,
re-running the clustering procedure on the 346 accessions
and using the predefined population structure as 'prior
information', we assigned the 80 supplementary accessions into these four clusters [see Additional file 3].
Although most of these accessions showed partial membership in multiple clusters, 50 out of the 80 accessions
were assigned to the same cluster as other accessions originating from the same population. After this last step, the
four clusters inferred were composed of respectively 83,
99, 114 and 50 accessions. The cultivars Cyprus, Caliph
and Paraggio were assigned to the North-Eastern group
(in red Figure 1c). Cultivars Borung, Mogul and Sephi
were assigned to the South-Eastern group (in yellow, Figure 1c) while Jemalong was assigned to the SpanishMoroccan group (in blue, Figure 1c).
Analyzing patterns of genetic diversity within this stratification showed that the levels of genetic diversity is relatively homogeneous across clusters, each group exhibiting

approximately the same level of genetic variation, as
measured by HE or NA (Table 4). Compared to the whole
sample, the four clusters showed lower proportions of significant pairwise linkage disequilibrium, with a maximum of 5 pairs of loci in LD for the smaller group (i.e.
cluster 4 mainly composed of French accessions).
Between clusters pairwise FST estimates varied between
0.05 and 0.10, the largest FST values were found in all pairwise comparisons involving cluster 2 (i.e. the SpainMorocco group); the lowest values being observed
between the Northern and the Southern clusters (Table 5).
Sampling of core-collections
We first studied the performance of two marker based
strategies; the M and the H strategies (see Methods for
details) to build core collections by sampling our total
data set of 346 genetically unique inbred lines. The performance of these two sampling strategies for assembling
core collection was studied over a range of putative core
collection (sample) sizes. For each sample size, the performance of each strategy (M, H) was compared to a pure
random strategy by comparing the average score of 30–

100 core collections sampled independently. When evaluating the M strategy, we used 6 loci as markers to implement the M strategy and we used the remaining 7 loci as
targets to cross validate the efficacy of the M strategy. Such
procedure allowed us to test whether the M strategy can
assemble core collection displaying high allelic diversity
not only at the set of markers used to implement it but
also throughout the genome. Not surprisingly the score of
core collections built using the M strategy was much better
than pure random sampling when considering marker
loci only (Figure 2a). However, when considering a set of
7 loci not used by the M strategy, the score of core collections built by the M strategy was only slightly better than
the score of core collections sampled purely at random
(Figure 2b). This finding suggests that relatively modest
gains in allelic diversity are to be expected when building
core collection using the M strategy relative to a pure random sampling of the collection. Similarly we compared
the score of core collections built using the H strategy with
purely random core collection of the same size. The average score of the H strategy was consistently better than a

"hybrid/mixed" strategy to assemble these collections. For
each core size, we gave equal weight to each of the four
clusters uncovered in the structure analysis. Within each
cluster, we used the M strategy to build a core collection
of c individuals. Given that a number of important inbred
lines (used as parents for mapping populations) were
found in all four clusters inferred when stratifying our collection in K = 4 groups, we chose to retain these 8 genotypes as our starting CC8 collection. For all subsequent
core collections (CC16, CC32, etc.), the M strategy was
implemented within each of the four groups and constrained to include the individuals comprising the "previous" core collections. This yielded a set of nested core
collections whose detailed composition is provided to
help design further studies [see Additional file 4]. The

Microsatellite variation in Medicago truncatula
Surveying a worldwide collection of individuals for a set
of 13 microsatellite loci distributed throughout the
genome, we revealed a large amount of genetic variability
in Medicago truncatula. This result was expected considering the sampling scale and the class of markers we used.
Microsatellite markers are known to display high mutation rates, and are thus expected to reveal fairly high
amounts of polymorphisms especially when used at the
species level [25]. We found however a large variation
among loci for both the gene diversity (He) and the allelic
numbers, with two loci exhibiting less than 6 alleles over
the whole sample. Comparisons with other annual selfing
plant species are not straightforward as we used a large
sample size spanning a wide geographic range. A survey of
Arabidopsis thaliana conducted at a broad geographic scale
over 71 individuals reported a similar range of values for
HE (9 loci, 0.79–0.96) [26]. This range is similar to the
range found here when excluding the three loci exhibiting
markedly reduced levels of polymorphism (MTIC126,
MTIC243 and MAL367466). MTIC126 and MTIC243
were based on EST sequences. This could explain their
lower polymorphism compared to other loci located in
less constrained intergenic regions

collections retained to represent the diversity of our Medicago truncatula collection (CC8 to CC96) are represented by
grey circles.

Multilocus level analyses revealed no redundancy within
the collection, so we used all the individuals for further
analyses. The sample we used spans different spatial
scales: the population level, different geographical regions
and the whole species. A hierarchical analysis would thus
appear appropriate to determine how genetic diversity is
organized within and between populations. Such an analysis was however not suitable because the within population sampling scheme was not random: sampling was
based on prior information on allozyme genotypes and
was performed to maximize the within population diversity. In Medicago truncatula, the fine-scale population
structure has already been documented. From these studies, we know that within population diversity in Medicago
truncatula is highly variable among populations (mean HE
ranging from 0.10 to 0.24 using RAPD markers [27] and
reaching values as high as HE = 0.48 when using microsatellite markers [23]).
Previous hierarchical population genetic analyses also
revealed that pairs of populations are highly differentiated
even at a small spatial scale (FST values as high as 0.39 are
observed between populations located 30 meters apart,
[23]). In accordance with these results, the present study

was able to demonstrate a spatial genetic correlation only
for individuals originating from the same population or
from very adjacent populations. The occurrence of spatial
correlation over short distances can be interpreted as the
result of current low distance migration/drift processes.
For a selfing species, most dispersion should occur
through seed dispersal. In Medicago truncatula, short distance seed dispersal can occur (JR, pers. observation) but
the fruits bear spikes which facilitate dispersal by animals
(grazing mammals) potentially over longer distances.
Moreover, M. truncatula is often confined to marginal agricultural habitats, and thus undergo rapid population
turnover. This type of so called metapopulation dynamics
is expected to increase genetic drift at the population level.
These factors are expected to generate highly differentiated
populations with neighbouring locations showing as
much differentiation as much more distant one as we
observed here. This configuration, combined with the
sampling scheme adopted in our survey, could also
explain the low level of linkage disequilibrium observed
in the whole sample [28,29]. Ostrowski and collaborators
[26] also recently reported a similar finding in a broad
sample of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions.
Inferred population structure in Medicago truncatula
Although we could not find isolation by distance over
large geographic distances, the model-based clustering
algorithm we used revealed patterns of population structure that were roughly consistent with the geographic origin of the accessions. This consistency was striking when
considering accessions with a high proportion of membership in one of the inferred clusters. Accessions with
partial membership (highest membership <0.6) shuffled
the tight correspondence between genetic ancestry and
regional affiliation. These accessions represented roughly
30% of the sample, and probably signed recent events of
gene-flow between neighbouring groups or a mixture of
large distance dispersal and recombination events. The
population structure inferred at K = 4 was retained as the
most consistent stratification because high proportions of
individuals with partial membership (<0.6) were found
for higher K values [see Additional file 3]. This stratification accounted for 8% of the microsatellite genetic variation observed over the whole sample, and, as expected
from the clustering algorithm we used, the within cluster
levels of linkage disequilibrium were low compared to the
whole sample. We note that caution must be exerted
when interpreting the biological significance of this stratification. In particular the number of inferred clusters
should not be taken at face value as it reflects the underlying true genetic structure, which may be discrete or continuous, its sampling and the amount of marker information
available for inference [30]. With that in mind, we discuss
below the most salient features of the structure we uncovered.

The cluster showing the highest geographic consistency
corresponded to a restricted geographic area: the Iberian
Peninsula and Morocco. Interestingly, this cluster was
already identified at K = 2 and subsequently displayed the
highest level of differentiation with the three other clusters (at K = 4). This cluster was also clearly differentiated
from both France and Algeria. Together, these results provide compelling support for the previous hypothesis of a
refuge during glacial cycles in this region [31]. Iberia has
been shown to be one of the three main European refugia
for most plant species along with Italy and the Balkans
[32-34]. For the remaining accessions, the stratification
uncovered at K = 4 clearly distinguished the North and the
South of the Mediterranean basin. This result suggests a
colonization of the Mediterranean via two routes from an
initial area located around the Middle East. The low level
of differentiation observed between these two groups
(Northern Mediterranean vs. Southern Mediterranean)
however can also be interpreted as the result of a recent
expansion of the species around the Mediterranean.
Performance of core collection sampling strategies
When benchmarking the H and M strategies against a pure
random strategy, we found very little gain when scoring
genetic diversity at loci not involved in the sampling (Figure 2b and Figure 3). This suggests that the H and M strategies are not very likely to perform better than a pure
random sampling. This finding may be surprising given
that the mating system of M. truncatula (high levels of selfing) and the patterns of regional subdivision uncovered in
our sample are factors that a priori favor marker assisted
sampling strategies over pure random sampling to capture
efficiently variation [12]. One particular property of our
sample may however explain this finding. The set of
inbred lines to which we applied these sampling strategies
were highly non redundant to start with. In fact, for all
populations coming from the INRA collection that make
up 2/3 of our sample, the strategy used to extract inbred
lines from populations did take into account the amount
of polymorphism detected within populations. This strategy ensured for instance that populations which displayed
relatively higher levels of variation were represented by
more inbred lines (up to 8 inbred lines were extracted per
population) than populations found to be monomorphic. Thus the initial absence of redundancy in our sample of 346 inbred lines (all being genetically unique)
together with overall low levels of linkage disequilibrium
may leave little room for the optimized sampling of variation and may explain the poor gains of marker-assisted
sampling strategies (H and M) over pure random sampling. Another possibility is that more markers or markers
with lower mutation rates may be needed to efficiently
"tag" the genome. McKhann et al [13], using only 10 gene
anchored fragments (of about 600 pb) and SNP variation
present within those fragments to guide sampling

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/28

observed some modest gain (~10%) of the M strategy over
a pure random strategy.

Conclusion
We have extracted 346 genetically unique inbred lines
from a large set of sampling locations representing the
extent of natural variation collected to date throughout
the species range of Medicago truncatula. These inbred
lines, a publicly available resource for the Medicago community, were genotyped at 13 microsatellite loci. We used
patterns of microsatellite diversity to uncover the presence
of a broad scale genetic structure in M. truncatula. This
stratification, the presence of 4 genetically diverged
groups which were inferred solely on the basis of marker
data, was found a posteriori to be consistent with the geographical origin of genotypes. Pattern of microsatellite
diversity and genetic structure in Medicago truncatula were
used to obtain some insight into the demographic history
of this species and to build a set of nested core collection
representing the breadth of naturally occurring genetic
variation. These, nested core collections can be used as a
standardized panel for coordinating efforts aimed at in
depth characterization of phenotypic variation and efficient SNPs discovery in Medicago truncatula. As such these
nested core collections will be a pivotal resource for functional and evolutionary genomics studies in the growing
Medicago truncatula community. Future work will document the extent of genetic divergence existing between
this genepool, the related sub species M. truncatula ssp tricycla and the sister species Medicago littoralis. This will
yield a clearer picture of the phylogenetic relationships
between these taxa and will allow identifying a set of
accessions complementing our nested core collections.

Methods
Plant material
Medicago truncatula is native to the Mediterranean and has
become naturalized in other regions of the world following European migrations. In Australia, it is used as a forage
crop and soil improver. M. truncatula has been split into
three subspecies mainly on the basis of pod characteristics: ssp truncatula, ssp tricycla and ssp longeaculata. Previous molecular analyses demonstrated that individuals
from the subspecies tricycla are genetically differentiated
from the two other subspecies [24,35]. To avoid genetic
stratification at the sub-species genetic subdivision conflicting with patterns of regional subdivision (see below),
we did not include M truncatula ssp tricycla accessions in
our sample.

We used the French Medicago truncatula collection maintained in Montpellier. For Medicago truncatula sensu lato
(i.e. including M. truncatula ssp tricycla), this collection
consists of a set of 350 natural populations collected by
the laboratory in different countries around the Mediter-

ranean basin (France, Spain, Portugal, Algeria, Greece,
Crete) and a set of 231 introductions provided by the Australian Medicago Genetic Resources Center (AMGRC)
maintained by the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI, Adelaide, Australia). The set of
natural populations collected by our laboratory was previously screened using isoenzymatic markers: for each population, 11 individuals were genotyped (J-M. Prosperi,
unpublished data). These data were used to sample different individuals from local populations, ensuring that
these individuals were genetically distinct and not mere
sibs. Following this procedure, 1 to 8 different individuals
were sampled in each population and selfed for two successive generations to obtain inbred lines. For the set of
populations obtained from the AMGRC, a single individual was randomly chosen for each accession number and
selfed for two consecutive generations. For the present
study, 338 inbred lines were chosen in this material in
order to span the range of eco-geographical distribution of
Medicago truncatula (excluding ssp tricycla) and to represent different units of spatial structure: population,
regions and the whole species. We only consider inbred
lines originating from accessions for which we knew at
least the precise geographical location. A set of 8 inbred
lines representing cultivated populations (hereafter cultivars) was added to the sample, bringing the sample size to
346 (Table 1). A detailed list of the 346 accessions and
eco-geographical data are available [see Additional file 1].
Taxonomically speaking, all these 346 accessions come
from two closely related subspecies: M. truncatula ssp
longeaculata and M. truncatula ssp truncatula.
Microsatellite genotyping
DNA was extracted from 100 mg of frozen leaves according to the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Thirteen microsatellite loci were used for genotyping (Table 2). Six of
them have been described previously (AY294632,
AY294633,
AY294635,
AY294640,
AY294642,
AF274878) [35]. Seven new loci were developed for this
study from published sequences (Huguet, pers. com. and
Santoni, unpublished results). To do so, Medicago truncatula sequences were retrieved from the GenBank database
and searched for SSR motifs (dinucleotide and trinucleotide) using the FINDPATTERNS program of the GCG
Wisconsin Package (Genetics Computer Group).

Amplification reactions were performed in a final volume
of 20 μl in the presence of 20 ng of template DNA, 4 pmol
of the reverse primer and 1 pmol of the forward primer,
0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide, 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.5
unit Taq polymerase (Sigma). The forward primer was 5'labeled with one of the three fluorophores (6FAM, NED
or HEX). PCR was carried out using a PTC 100 thermocycler (MJ Research). After 5 min at 94°, 30 cycles were performed with 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at either 50, 55 or 60°C

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/28

(depending on the locus), and 30 s at 72°C, followed by
final extension step of 5 min at 72°C. Amplified products
were detected on an ABI prism 3100 Genetic Analyser.
Samples were prepared by adding 3 μl of diluted PCR
products to 6.875 μl formamide and 0.125 μl GenSize
400 HD Rox. Analyses were performed using the GeneScan 3.1 and Genotyper 2.5 softwares (Applied Biosystems).
Analyses of microsatellite diversity were conducted at the
locus level. For each locus, we estimated the number of
alleles (NA), allelic frequencies, the observed (HO) and
expected (Nei's diversity, hereafter HE) heterozygosities
using Genetix version 4.04 [36]. Statistical associations
among loci (linkage disequilibrium) were tested through
Fisher's exact tests using the package GENEPOP version
3.3 [37], and corrected for multiple testing was done using
a sequential Bonferroni procedure. To determine the
genetic uniqueness of each accession and to quantify
redundancy, the multilocus DNA profile of all the inbred
lines were compared by pairs.
Inference of population structure
Spatial autocorrelation analyses were conducted using
SPAGeDI (version 1.1) [38] which calculates conditional
kinship coefficients for all pairs of individuals at various
geographical distances (each inbred line being assigned
the geographical coordinate of the original site of collection). To test whether the degree of relatedness between
individuals depends on the geographical distance, we
used a procedure implemented in SPAGeDI which performs permutations of individual locations to determine
the relationship between genetic ancestry and spatial distance expected under the null hypothesis of no isolation
by distance.

To infer population structure in this broad sample, we
used a model-based clustering algorithm implemented in
the computer program Structure version 2 [8,9]. This algorithm uses multilocus genotype to identify a predetermined number (K) of clusters that have distinctive allele
frequencies and assigns portions of individual genomes to
these clusters. Since Medicago truncatula is an autogamous
species (and thus largely homozygous), we used a haploid
setting. In the sample scored for microsatellite markers,
some populations were represented by more than one
inbred line. Because this sampling scheme appears inappropriate regarding the modeling assumptions of Structure [30] we investigated the population structure of our
sample in two successive steps. In a first step, we built a
new sample drawing at random a single individual in each
local population (which resulted in a sub-sample of 266
individuals, see result section). Following [9], we used the
"admixture model" assuming "no correlation among
allele frequencies". For each run, we used a burn-in period

Page 10 of 13

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:28

of 105 MCMC iterations and then 106 iterations for estimating the parameters. Five runs were considered for each
K value (K is the number of clusters to be inferred), for K
ranging from 1 to 8 [see Additional file 2]. For each run
output, individual accessions were assigned into a group
according to their highest proportion of membership into
this group.
The clusters thus defined were compared among runs for
each K value. The choice of the appropriate K value was
conducted as recommended by the authors of Structure[8]. For each K value, we first verified that individual
proportions of membership into a group were different
from 1/K. We also evaluated the stability of the groups'
composition between different runs at each K value.
When these conditions were met, we analysed the behaviour of the Log Likelihood of the data as a function of K,
looking for either a maximum value or a more or less plateau for increasing K. The lower value of K showing such
behaviour was considered as representative of the most
genuine stratification. For this K value, we chose the run
yielding the highest probability of the data and assigned
each individual into the cluster in which it has the highest
fraction of its genome. This stratification was used in a second step to assign the remaining individuals (those
removed from the first sample) to the K inferred groups.
To do this, we ran Structure on the whole data set (n =
346), using the 'prior information model'. Here, the clustering inferred in the previous stage was used as "prior
information"; Structure was then able to assign the
remaining individuals to the K previously defined groups,
on the basis of their microsatellite genotype.
To measure the fraction of the observed genetic variation
explained by the inferred clusters, we used the parameter
FST, widely used to estimate the between populations
component of variation [39] in population structure analyses. Pairwise FST were computed on the inferred stratification, using the software GENETIX. The statistical
significance of these FST values was tested through 1000
permutations of individuals across groups. Statistical
associations between loci were tested within each cluster
through Fisher's exact tests using Genepop version 3.3 [37].
Core collection sampling
We studied the performance of two different sampling
methods using marker information to generate core collections: the Maximization, hereafter M strategy [11] and
a stratified sampling, hereafter H, strategy (see below).
Both the M and the H strategies use information brought
by m marker loci. We define the score of a core collection
as the number of alleles summed over the m microsatellite
loci. The M strategy consists in searching through the
(vast) space of all potential core collections of a given size
(in number of individuals) that can be formed from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/28

collection of 346 genotypes included in that study and
retains the core collection(s) that exhibit the highest
score. To implement the M strategy, we used the heuristic
algorithm [40] implemented in the publicly available
MSTRAT software, version 4.1 [41].
As an alternative way of using molecular information, the
H strategy assumes that the collection has been previously
clustered in K groups (see section above for the description of the clustering method we used). Each group i (i =
1, .., K) is characterized by its mean genetic diversity qi.
Various parameters can be used to characterize the genetic
diversity of a group, but following Schoen and Brown
(1993) we used Nei's diversity (HE). Building a core collection of size c (in number of individuals) under the H
strategy consists in sampling at random ci = c qi/Q individuals (i = 1, ..., K), where Q = ∑i qi (i = 1, ..., K), in each
group. To implement the H strategy we partitioned the
entire collection in K = 4 groups composed respectively of
83, 99, 114 and 50 individuals. This partition corresponds
to the one proposed by the software Structure based on
the information brought by the 13 microsatellite loci.
Despite some variation in group size, all four groups displayed very similar levels of genetic diversity as measured
by either the mean number of alleles per loci or the mean
diversity of each loci (Table 3). We therefore sampled an
equal number of individuals in each groups, i.e. we used
qi = 1/4 (i = 1, ..., 4), to implement the H strategy. The H
strategy and all simulations described below were implemented using the language Mathematica version 4.0 [42]
(a Mathematica notebook is available upon request). The
sampling efficacy of both the M and the H strategies were
assessed by comparing the score of core collections built
of increasing sizes (in number of individuals) and we used
the score of core collections sampled randomly throughout the same collection as a benchmark for these markerbased sampling strategies.
