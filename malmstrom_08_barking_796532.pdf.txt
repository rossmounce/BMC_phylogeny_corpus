Abstract
Background: Geographic distribution of the genetic diversity in domestic animals, particularly
mitochondrial DNA, has often been used to infer centers of domestication. The underlying
presumption is that phylogeographic patterns among domesticates were established during, or
shortly after the domestication. Human activities are assumed not to have altered the haplogroup
frequencies to any great extent. We studied this hypothesis by analyzing 24 mtDNA sequences in
ancient Scandinavian dogs. Breeds originating in northern Europe are characterized by having a high
frequency of mtDNA sequences belonging to a haplogroup rare in other populations (HgD). This
has been suggested to indicate a possible origin of the haplogroup (perhaps even a separate
domestication) in central or northern Europe.
Results: The sequences observed in the ancient samples do not include the haplogroup indicative
for northern European breeds (HgD). Instead, several of them correspond to haplogroups that are
uncommon in the region today and that are supposed to have Asian origin.
Conclusion: We find no evidence for local domestication. We conclude that interpretation of the
processes responsible for current domestic haplogroup frequencies should be carried out with
caution if based only on contemporary data. They do not only tell their own story, but also that of
humans.

Background
Mitochondrial phylogeography is a useful tool for the
study of wild populations [1]. But applying phylogeography to domestic species is more complicated. For example, the arrival of dogs into the New World was not a
simple expansion of Asian dog populations, but a consequence of human migrations [2]. Humans have a history

of population movements and social changes over the last
ten thousand years [3-6], and this, together with the
human-mediated breeding history has affected the genetic
composition of livestock animals [7]. Therefore, human
influence cannot be neglected when studying patterns of
genetic diversity in domesticates.

A classic example of the use of mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA) diversity to infer the history of domestication
refers to dogs (Canis familiaris). Four to six mitochondrial
haplogroups (Hg) have been described in genetic studies
of modern dogs [8], indicating recurrent domestication or
backcrosses between domestic dogs and wild wolves
(Canis lupus). Three of the major Hgs are distributed
throughout the world, whereas one (D) is restricted to
Europe, especially in breeds originating in Scandinavia [811]. Similar patterns of fragmented genetic diversity have
been used to argue for local domestication in other species [12]. Such scenario could apply to dogs as they appear
as early as 9000 years ago in Scandinavia [13,14], and as
dogs and wolf remains have been found on the same sites
[15,16].
We have genetically typed mtDNA from ancient Scandinavian dog remains to investigate whether the high frequency of a rare dog Hg in northern Europe is evidence of
a local domestication event. We predict that an early
domestication event in Scandinavia would be visible in a
notable frequency of Hg D in ancient Scandinavian dog
remains.

Results and Discussion
Reproducible sequence data for the full 219 bp sequence
was recovered from 18 samples. The remaining six specimens only yielded reproducible sequence data for a
shorter 107 bp product (DQ860843-3 DQ860864,
AY673648–AY673672, Table 1). Phylogenetic reconstruction including the 18 prehistoric dogs that yielded complete sequences and 543 modern dog sequences [11]
revealed that all prehistoric dogs grouped within modern
Hgs (Figure 1). Seven of the 18 sequences belonged to Hg
A, the group that encompasses more than 70% of all
tested modern dogs around the world [11], while the
remaining eleven belonged to the now rare Hg C. Previously published data on 273 Swedish dogs indicated frequencies of the four major Hgs: A 69.2%, B 18.3%, C
7.0%, and D 5.5% [9]. When only native Scandinavian
breeds were considered (n = 54), the haplotype frequency
for Hg D increased to 33.3% [9]. A comparison of the 219
bp sequences obtained from the ancient dog specimens (n
= 18) and the contemporary native breeds indicates that
the frequency of Hg D is significantly reduced in the
ancient data set (0% in the ancient dataset, 33% in the
modern dataset, p < 0.001). The remaining six ancient
Scandinavian dogs that yielded only 107 bp of reproducible sequence data, also indicated an absence of Hg D
(Table 2). In total, eleven sequences had substitution patterns indicative for Hg A, while the remaining 13 had a
substitution indicative for Hg C (Table 1).
When the complete ancient dataset was compared to the
contemporary dataset, it proved equally improbable (p <

0.001) that Hg D was present in the oldest specimens in a
frequency similar to that observed in modern dogs. Using
a binomial distribution, we estimate that the frequency of
Hg D must have been lower than 0.118 in the original
population for us not to have noticed it in 24 samples (p
< 0.05), and lower than 0. 182 during the Neolithic for us
not to have noticed it in 15 samples (p < 0.05). Lastly, the
χ2 test between the Hg frequencies of the complete
ancient dataset with that of the complete Scandinavian
(not only considering native breeds) demonstrated a significant deviation between the modern and ancient frequencies (p < 0.0388, χ2 = 4.27, df = 1).
Our results indicate that Hg frequencies have been altered
in Scandinavian dogs since their first arrival. Interestingly,
while Hg C is overrepresented in our ancient material,
there is a complete lack of the Scandinavian group D in
our ancient dataset. Hg D is the one that could support a
Scandinavian origin whereas Hg C is suggested to be of
Asian origin [11]. Thus, we find no obvious evidence for
prehistoric canid domestication in Scandinavia. An external origin of Scandinavian dogs is supported by morphologic data, as even the oldest remains of dogs in

Samples were collected from eight different archaeological localities in southern Scandinavia, four Neolithic

Scandinavia were of smaller size than those of prehistoric
and extant wolves [15,17]. While canid domestication
may have occurred in other parts of Europe [18], Scandinavian dogs were likely imported and had experienced a
long period of morphological change under human control before they reached the Scandinavian peninsula.

Conclusion
In a wider context, our data calls for caution when using
modern sequences of domestic animals to interpret the

history of domestication. There is a profound difference
on selective forces on wild and domestic animals. Domesticates are subject to constant manipulation and follow
the same historic vicissitudes as the associated human
population. For example, genetic diversity may change
rapidly due to intense selective breeding, backcrossing
with the wild ancestor [19-22], migration of human
groups with genetically different domesticates [2], and
decimation of local populations by invaders [23]. Hg frequency could change over a short period of few genera-

tions. While diversity and branching pattern of
mitochondrial DNA may be used to study the number
and possible antiquity of domestication events, phylogeographical patterns in domestic species may indeed not be
suitable to base discussion on their geographical origin.
Close collaboration between zooarchaeologists and
molecular biologists, involving the study of ancient specimens, may be the only way to verify the continuity
through time of the species that have set the basis of our
culture.

We analysed sequences from 24 archaeological domestic
dogs. The skeletal material represents eight Scandinavian
sites: four Neolithic (≈5300–4500 BP) and four Medieval
(≈1000–500 BP) (Table 1, Figure 2). DNA was extracted,
PCR-amplified and sequenced according to previously
published protocols [24,25] (Table 1). A subset of the
sample sequences (n = 7) was replicated in an independent laboratory (Center for Ancient Genetics, University of
Copenhagen) confirming the original results in all cases.
The new data was combined with previously published
data [24,25] for analysis (see Table 1). Most of the Neolithic samples, those from Ajvide, Visby, and Korsnäs (Figure 2), were recovered as isolated findings in cultural
layers. One sample was from a complete skeleton found
in a burial in Central Sweden (Bergsgraven in Linköping).
The Medieval samples originated from isolated skeletal
remains recovered in urban (Skara and Stockholm) or
rural contexts (Eketorp, Sunnerby).

The Swedish Research Council provided financial support for the study.

We used polymorphisms found within a 219 bp fragment
of the dog D-loop region and comparison with previously
published sequences to determine Hgs. To portray the
relationship between sequences we constructed a reduced
median network, including all 219 bp, using Network 4.1
[26]; threshold was set to 1. The default parameters for
reduction were used, where parallel mutations are
assumed to be more frequent between existing sequences,
than between an existing sequence and a median vector.
As the reduction was intense, a NJ tree was constructed to
support the network using the Kimura 2-parameter model
of sequence evolution. Support for the nodes was assessed
with 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates.
The Hg frequencies within the ancient datasets were compared to those in modern Scandinavian dogs [9] using χ2
tests. To ensure a minimum sample of 5 for all cells in χ2
tests, we pooled Hgs A and D, and C and B (following the
best natural grouping according to the network, Figure 1).
Finally, we used the binomial distribution to estimate the
probability of observing as many sequences from Hg D as
found in the ancient samples assuming that the relative
frequency was the same as in modern native Scandinavian
dogs.
