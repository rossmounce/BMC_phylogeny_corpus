Biophysical and structural considerations for
protein sequence evolution
Johan A Grahnen1, Priyanka Nandakumar1,2, Jan Kubelka3 and David A Liberles1*

Abstract
Background: Protein sequence evolution is constrained by the biophysics of folding and function, causing
interdependence between interacting sites in the sequence. However, current site-independent models of
sequence evolutions do not take this into account. Recent attempts to integrate the influence of structure and
biophysics into phylogenetic models via statistical/informational approaches have not resulted in expected
improvements in model performance. This suggests that further innovations are needed for progress in this field.
Results: Here we develop a coarse-grained physics-based model of protein folding and binding function, and
compare it to a popular informational model. We find that both models violate the assumption of the native
sequence being close to a thermodynamic optimum, causing directional selection away from the native state.
Sampling and simulation show that the physics-based model is more specific for fold-defining interactions that
vary less among residue type. The informational model diffuses further in sequence space with fewer barriers and
tends to provide less support for an invariant sites model, although amino acid substitutions are generally
conservative. Both approaches produce sequences with natural features like dN/dS < 1 and gamma-distributed
rates across sites.
Conclusions: Simple coarse-grained models of protein folding can describe some natural features of evolving
proteins but are currently not accurate enough to use in evolutionary inference. This is partly due to improper
packing of the hydrophobic core. We suggest possible improvements on the representation of structure, folding
energy, and binding function, as regards both native and non-native conformations, and describe a large number
of possible applications for such a model.

Background
Protein-coding sequences play a central role in cellular
functions necessary to produce the vast variation in
organismal phenotypes observed in nature. To function,
most proteins must fold into a unique and stable structure [1]. The structure is responsible for orienting residues necessary for proper function, including binding
and catalysis. To maintain fitness, protein function and
the underlying structure must be preserved. Protein
structure and binding (for example, protein-ligand and
protein-protein interactions) are determined by the
interactions of individual amino acid residues. Therefore, to mechanistically model the evolution of protein
sequences, these residue-residue interactions must be

considered, relaxing the common assumption of independent evolution of each amino acid position [2].
Structural models for sequence evolution where function
is protein-protein intermolecular interaction will now be
considered.
To evaluate if a sequence will fold into a unique and
stable structure, it must be demonstrated that the
sequence prefers the folded state to both the unfolded
state (and folding intermediates) as well as to alternative
folded states [3]. From a practical perspective, it is
impossible to enumerate the enormous space of all possible alternative conformations [4]. Therefore, sets of
representative “decoy conformations” must be used to
approximate folding intermediates and/or other stable
or meta-stable states [5]. Alternatively, without explicitly
considering decoy structures, the inter-residue contacts
from different conformations can be randomly sampled
[6]. Additionally, a scoring function is needed to

quantify differences between the possible states. Strategies developed for generating such scoring functions
include those derived statistically from existing structures
(informational models, specifically coarse-grained pairwise statistical potentials)[7-9] and those derived from
physical first principles [10,11]. Both types of scoring
function assume that the native sequence lies close to
(within a neutral sequence network of) a thermodynamic
optimum, and that there is a gap in energy between the
native state and the closest non-native state [12].
Formally, the protein sequence evolution problem
relates to the inverse folding problem (whether a
sequence will preferentially adopt a particular confirmation) rather than the folding problem. Underlying both
problems are similar physical assumptions and similar
models [13].
Protein biological function depends not only on
proper folding, but also on the ability to bind the target
ligands. Therefore, to study sequence evolution, binding
must also be evaluated. From a physical perspective this
is easier, as the only states to consider are the bound
and the unbound states. However, it has recently been
suggested that selective pressures on proteins to avoid
non-specific binding are also an important aspect of
protein fitness, necessitating consideration of binding
“decoys” as well [14]. Identifying the actual selective
pressures against non-specific binding in a cell is a
daunting task, but the number and nature of binding
decoys is a major determinant of the ease of evolving
new binding interactions. The binding decoy characteristics also affect the level of selective constraint on the
binding interface.
Site and function independent models clearly do not
capture critical elements of protein evolution. For structure-based models, a good scoring function must produce sequences with similar properties to real proteins.
This includes a hydrophobic core that evolves slower
than the hydrophilic surface [15]. A dN/dS ratio (the
ratio of the nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rate
to the synonymous nucleotide substitution rate) much
smaller than unity, particularly for functional residues,
should also emerge [16]. More particularly, amino acid
substitution rates should show heterogeneity, expressed
by a gamma distribution across positions (rejecting an
equal rates model of evolution)[17], reflecting their relative importance to folding and function. While the
gamma function for rate heterogeneity was adopted for
model fit rather than mechanistic purposes, it is one of
the most common parameters in standard evolutionary
models and accounts for heterogeneity in the substitution rate driven by structural signals as well as other signals in evolutionary sequence data [18,19]. In addition
to rate heterogeneity, sequences must also have an
energy gap between the native and alternative

conformations to ensure rapid and stable folding [20],
although structurally disordered proteins represent a
distinct class of proteins that do not have this property
[21]. The model should place the native sequence near
an optimum so as not to provide a signal of directional
selection when function is not changing. Consequently,
most mutations should be deleterious or nearly neutral
rather than adaptive [22]. Lastly, proteins must retain
their binding function.
Population size dictates what fitness changes are neutral as well as what mutations become substitutions [23]
and must therefore be taken into account. To enable use
in forward (simulation) and backward (phylogenetic or
population genetic) studies of evolution, especially in a
population genetic context, in a complete genome context, or in studies of interactome evolution, the model
needs to be coarse grained at a level that allows for sufficient computational speed. In this context the computational cost makes state of the art models and methods
from the protein structure community [24] intractable.
Here a novel physics-based scoring function is developed and compared with a commonly used informational
approach on the criteria described above. The physicsbased model is more specific and predicts less drastic stability changes. Both types of models violate the assumption of high native sequence stability and produce many
adaptive mutations through directional selection towards
a scoring function optimum, even though the model
works with truncation selection. These properties are discussed in light of their effect on modeling accuracy and
improvements to the models are suggested.

Results
Protein folding and function cause interdependence
between sites in the protein sequence. For instance, a
mutation that removes a cysteine involved in a disulfide
bridge (interaction with another cysteine residue at a
different position in the protein) is likely to be deleterious, whereas mutation of other cysteines (not involved
in disulfide bridge formation) may be more neutral. Of
course, disulfide bridges can be lost and interconverted
to other types of stabilizing interactions over evolutionary time, albeit with a large transitional barrier due to
the strong site interdependence. Such selective pressures
can be modeled by scoring the thermodynamic effects
of mutations. Two approaches to calculating such scores
are the statistically motivated informational methods
(specifically, coarse-grained pairwise statistical potentials) and the first principles physics-based methods.
Informational models score the likelihood of observing
specific types of contacts in the folded protein based on
those seen in previously known structures [12]. Physicsbased approaches evaluate structures by measuring the
fit of residues to geometrical properties such as

Grahnen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:361
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/361

backbone torsion and residue-residue distances [10]. In
both cases the fit to both the native and the many possible non-native conformations must be measured to
ensure specificity.
This manuscript sets out to evaluate the ability to
replicate biological properties of proteins using both
approaches described above through evolutionary simulation. A new physics-based approach is described.
Native sequences were evaluated in both approaches to
evaluate if they fell within the neutral network of an
optimum or if they underwent directional selection initially. Similarly, sequences sampled from within the optimum were evolved to examine the evolutionary
properties of each model. With the physics-based
model, the relative importance of each term in the folding and the binding functions was evaluated. Together,
these analyses give a picture of the evolutionary performance of each model and the appropriateness for use in
addressing various questions in molecular evolution.
The Native State in Physics-based and Informational
Scoring Functions

In this study a novel physics-based scoring function for a
coarse-grained representation of protein structure (Figure
1) was developed. The model (the details of which are
described in Methods) includes terms for backbone bond
angles, helix and sheet propensities, a new disulfide
bridge term, a Lennard-Jones potential to account for
van der Waals interactions, a Coloumbic potential, and a
solvation potential. The last three terms were also
included as part of the binding score function. The newly
developed physics-based potential energy function
(described in Methods) for a coarse grained protein
representation (Figure 1), was evaluated on structure fit
to sequence (the fold recognition problem) and sequence
fit to structure (the inverse folding problem). A previously developed informational scoring function [9],
which is widely used for evolutionary studies was similarly tested. Both models produce an energy gap Zfold (eq.
14) between native and random conformations for the
native sequence for 100 proteins in a structurally diverse
test set. Also, both models produce larger energy gaps for
the native sequence than random sequences in the native
conformation from the same set of proteins: an average
native Zfold of 1.7 for the physics-based model and 4.4 for
the informational model. Hence, both model types solve
the fold recognition and inverse folding problems to
some degree. Binding function can be scored similarly
(but on a separate test set of protein complexes, see
Methods), and a gap Zbind (eq. 18) is produced for both
models with an average of 0.78 for the informational
model and 0.90 for the physics-based model. Not surprisingly, both models score folding (for which they were
designed) more specifically than binding.

Figure 1 The two-bead model of protein structure is
presented. Each residue consists of a Ca bead (grey) and a Cb
bead (white). Ca beads are placed at the position of the Ca atoms
and form the backbone through being connected by virtual
peptide bonds with a torsion angle . Each Ca bead (except Gly)
binds a Cb bead with a bond length b and bond angle θ. Cb
beads, whose centers reside at the geometric centroid of the
residue atoms, are separated by a distance rij and have a radius ri
(proportional to the radius of gyration of the side chain atoms).

Natural protein sequences are not near the modeled
thermodynamic minimum

However, evaluation of folding stability (in the sense of
Sgap, eq. 15) of near-native sequences for a representative protein SAP [25] shows that neither model is highly
specific for the native sequence (Figure 2). Within 15%
divergence from the native sequence, 42% of sequences
are more stable than the native under the physics-based
model, and for the informational model this rises to
73%. This is not consistent with biological protein
sequences, for which the vast majority of mutations are
destabilizing [26]. The sampling procedure also uncovers
sequences up to 2.8× more stable than the native within
30% divergence (4.8× for the informational model). The
landscapes for both models are qualitatively similar: the
native sequence sits on a steep slope and there are local
minima elsewhere (Figure 2). The physics-based function yields a somewhat funnel-like landscape, whereas
the informational model produces a surface with multiple similar minima. In both cases the overall slope and
large fraction of adaptive changes would be expected to
cause directional selection away from the native state.
Simulations corroborate this by showing rapid divergence from the native state for both models (Figure 3).
Sequences near the modeled thermodynamic minimum
have protein-like properties

As the native sequence of SAP is not near a stable equilibrium for folding stability on the landscape, stabilitybiased Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
(see Methods) was used to find such minima. As seen in

Figure 2 Folding scores for near-native sequences threaded through the conformation of the SAP protein are shown. The score
distribution is shown as a landscape, with the percentage of the negative native score (i.e -Sgapnative, see eq. 15) on the Z axis and coordinates
in high-dimensional sequence space projected onto the X and Y axes via Sammon mapping. Smaller scores denote more stable sequences (in
blue), with larger scores being less stable (becoming progressively more red). The native sequence is marked by a black dot. A) The score
distribution for the informational scoring function. B) The score distribution for the physics-based scoring function.

Figure 4 (left), these highly stable sequences are very
dissimilar to the native state, with only 5% and 11%
average identity for the physics-based and informational
models, respectively. However, both models show high
conservation at many positions and a marked signal for
hydrophobicity. The sequences show a rugged energy
landscape across sequence space and expectedly complex patterns of change relative to the native sequence
(Figure 2).
In the informational model the sequences are dominated by stretches of hydrophobic residues, interspersed
with charged residues and a few tyrosines (Figure 4A,
left). The remaining positions are highly randomized
and do not maintain a specific biochemical character.
When mapping the most informative positions onto the
structure (Figure 4A, right) a fairly simple pattern
emerges. The b-sheet core is dominated by small hydrophobic residues, surrounded by a shell of larger such
residues with the occasional tyrosine embedded. Clusters of charged residues maintain the stability of some
loops, although most of the highly exposed positions are
randomized.
The physics-based model produces qualitatively similar results, but differs in some aspects. Core residues are
prolines rather than leucines, and the larger hydrophobic residues surrounding the core tend to be tryptophans instead of phenylalanines (Figure 4B, left).
Tyrosines are again favored in semi-exposed positions.
However, in place of ionic interactions the physicsbased model prefers glycines. Mapping the informative
positions onto the structure (Figure 4B, right) reveals
that these conserved glycines are located in or near

portions of the backbone that are b-sheet-like and
highly exposed. Another notable difference is that the
physics-based model seems more residue-specific as it
conserves fewer positions overall (36 vs 54), but those
residues are typically more strongly conserved with larger co-evolutionary barriers to change. Both models
impart roughly the same selective pressure overall.
Evolutionary simulations near minima reproduce
biological sequence properties

Using the stable sequences as starting points for population-based simulations allows comparison of the models
with respect to other properties than folding stability.
As can be seen in Figure 5, evolutionary rate ratios in
both cases are comparable to those found in real orthologous proteins (dN/dS of 0.1-0.5) and indicative of the
negative selective pressure applied (dN/dS < 1)[16]. The
rates also vary as expected depending on the position of
each residue in the 3D structure. Exposed surface positions evolve up to three times faster than the buried and
highly constrained core residues. Residues in the binding
site, which are exposed but under functional selective
pressure, show an intermediate rate. Interestingly, under
both models the rates in the selectively important
regions (core and binding site) become very similar over
time. The physics-based model consistently shows lower
rates throughout the structure, with the exception of
initial changes in the binding site. Surface mutations are
noticeably more selected against compared to the information-based approach, which is consistent with the
explicit consideration of solvation in this model. The
physics-based model also restricts movement on the

sequence-stability landscape to one or a few well-defined
(but very large in sequence space) basins, whereas the
informational model appears to diffuse more neutrally
across a mostly flat surface (Figure 6).
Real protein sequences also show rate heterogeneity
across positions (which is modeled by a gamma distribution of rates of amino acid substitution per site in statistical comparison with equal rates across sites), such that

Page 5 of 18

most positions evolve slowly but some evolve quite
rapidly [17]. The fit of such a model to the simulated
sequences was found to be reasonable (Table 1). The
relative support for including gamma-distributed rates is
generally high using the informational model, and somewhat lower in the physics-based model. The latter
instead shows higher relative support for a model with
some invariant sites among common parameters in siteindependent substitution models. The drop in support
for rate heterogeneity toward the end of the simulations
may indicate emergence of rate heterotachy [27], caused
by migration to a non-native stable basin through intramolecular co-evolution. This is consistent with a view of
proteins where an initial equal rates across sites model
with a small number of substitutions gives rise to a
gamma distribution as substiutions accumulate, driven
by the three dimensional structure. With further substitution, intramolecular co-evolution gives rise to support
for a covarion process rather than for a gamma distribution [28]. When gamma is supported, the shape parameter of the gamma distribution (0.1-3.0) is consistent
with those found in biological sequences in general [29]
and with the shape parameter 1.83 obtained from the
Pfam SH2 domain seed alignment in particular.
The sequences and structures produced by each simulation (Figure 7) further highlight the differences
between the models. The sequence collection from the
informational model with truncation selection on folding and binding (Figure 7A) shows the same basic features as those found by sampling from stable structures
(Figure 4A, left) but with added emphasis on tyrosines
rather than ionic interactions. There is some indication
of increased conservation of the binding site (around
positions 52, 68, and 92). During the simulations core
hydrophobicity increased by ~25%, and surface hydrophobicity almost tripled (Table 1). This resulted in a
similar ratio of core and surface hydrophobicities as in
the native SAP sequence (1.63 and 1.80, respectively).
By mapping conserved positions onto the structure (Figure 7A, right) we recover the starting pattern (Figure
4A, right) of conserved b-sheet core, a shell of larger
hydrophobic residues around this, and tyrosines at medium exposure.
As noted above, the physics-based model sampled
with truncation selection for folding and binding is substantially more restrictive in how many non-synonymous substitutions it allows, and the simulated
sequences reflect this (Figure 7C, left). Nearly 1/3 of the
positions are effectively invariant over shorter evolutionary timeframes, compared to only a few residues in the
informational model. Structural mapping of highly conserved positions (Figure 7C, right) again recovers the
starting pattern (Figure 4B, right), although a few bsheet-associated glycines have been replaced by charges

on the most exposed loops. The binding site is very
highly conserved. Only very exposed positions (17-18,
59-62, etc.) have started to randomize, mostly containing polar and charged residues. Core and surface hydrophobicities started close to those of the native sequence
(83% and 50% vs 72% and 40%), and did not change
appreciably during the simulation (Table 1).
Comparing the simulated sequences to the Hidden
Markov Model of the Pfam [30] SH2 family (Figure 7B),
some similarities are noticeable. Both models reproduce
the overall conservation of the core residues, particularly
the very buried ones. The informational model is more
accurate in predicting the residue type within the core
(leucines and phenylalanines), whereas the physics-based
model correctly conserves some glycines. Neither model
captures the defining functional feature of the family (a
conserved arginine in the binding pocket), but this is
due to the SAP SH2 domain binding a non-phosphorylated ligand. Instead the models more generally preserve
residues within the binding interface. This type of conservation is absent in the HMM since SH2 domains
have unique specificity-determining binding site geometries. Similarly, since the HMM reflects several dozen
distinct structures and sequences it is less conserved
overall than simulated sequences derived from a single

The parameters of both models would be expected to
have an influence on the sequences produced. The
properties of the informational model have been

described elsewhere [9]. Here, the nature of the physicsbased model is examined in more detail. The term
weights are re-adjusted for each individual protein in
the test set, and the resulting distributions are shown in
Figure 8A. Solvation, side chain angles (bend) and pairwise interactions (LJ) are quite important, consistent
with a well-packed hydrophobic core with biological
side chain rotamers and no steric clashes. Buried salt
bridges (ion) and disulfide bonds (S-S) seem less influential, but are also comparatively rare in the investigated
protein structures. Of the secondary structure terms,
helix propensity is somewhat more specific than b-sheet
tendency. For binding, shape complementarity (bLJ) is
by far the most effective term. However, these parameter values are found in the context of the complete
scoring function and may have strong synergistic effects
in combination with other terms. An examination of the
contribution of each term in isolation to the total gap
between native and random states (Figure 8B) reveals
some additional trends. The LJ term is nearly uninformative on its own, indicating that it needs to be combined with at least one other term to be specific. The
difference between representations of the non-native
state is visible in the helix and beta terms. The helix
term is more informative when considering the gap to
decoy structures, whereas the beta term is more effective in discriminating against random sequences.
Repeating the parameterization step many times on
the SAP protein reveals further differences between the
terms. Although the algorithm converges on roughly the
same optimality score (it is numerically stable), there is
substantial variation in parameter values. The co-dependence of roughly equally likely solution sets for term
weights is shown in Figure 9. Some terms (bend and
solvation) have pronounced optima around which there
is little variation, but others (ionic, LJ, helix) produce a
relatively flat optimality landscape. Particularly the less
important terms have weights that vary over several
orders of magnitude. This can cause difficulty with finding realistic stable sequences for a particular fold, as
small changes in some terms (notably the ionic term)
can have large effects on the sequence composition. A
representative sample of parameter sets was used to
generate collections of stable sequences, and the most
protein-like set was selected (Figure 9, filled squares).
The parameter values fall close to the center of each
distribution, although charges are de-emphasized and
solvation has increased importance.

Discussion
In evaluating our ability to model the evolution of
sequences using structural and functional (binding) constraints, both informational and physical models show
protein-like properties, but also need further

improvement. Despite a stability gap between random
sequences (and structures) from the native for both
methods, the native sequence is not near enough to a
thermodynamic stability optimum to prevent directional
selection. Sequences near such an optimum are more
homopolymeric in composition. The evolution of such
sequences, however, does show many attributes of real
protein evolution.
The effect of negative (purifying) selection, a dN/dS
ratio smaller than 1, is well modeled by both
approaches, even reproducing the known correlation
between exposure and evolutionary rate [31]. The physics-based model produces the stronger selective pressure overall, particularly so on the protein surface (due
to the solvation term). Variation in this rate across positions is mimicked by the informational model, which
more consistently supports a gamma parameter
throughout the simulation. The physics-based model
instead conserves some positions completely over
shorter evolutionary distances, but ultimately supports a
covarion process rather than simply rate heterogeneity.
In particular, hydrophobic residue content is much closer to that of the native sequence. When it comes to the
exact identity of such hydrophobic residues (e.g. leucines
vs prolines) the informational model has higher correspondence to native residues, presumably due to being
derived from known sequence/structure combinations.
Overall the physics-based model appears more specific
for local but crucial contributions to free energy of folding, whereas the informational model produces

sequences with protein-like properties but without fold
specificity.
In the context of fold specificity, a major difference
between models is consideration of secondary structure.
The physics-based model is enriched in prolines in the
b-sheet core, and glycines in other sheet-like portions of
the backbone. In principle any small hydrophobic residue should suffice in the tightly packed and highly buried core positions, but prolines in particular score well
in the helical term (being helix breakers in the most
non-helical segment of the protein)[32] and are mostly
acceptable in the sheet term. The glycines in halfexposed positions with sheet-like geometry provide an
excellent compromise between the helix, sheet and solvation terms, and have little effect on the remainder of
the scoring function. Although somewhat unrealistic in
the context of the native sequence, this does demonstrate the strong impact of the particular backbone conformation under selection.
The physics-based model is also different in that its
parameters are adjusted for each protein. This is beneficial in adding specificity to the model [33], but also presents issues with parameter selection [34]. The LennardJones term in particular is surprisingly variable and
offers little benefit in isolation. When testing against
random sequences, this is mostly due to the side chain
replacement protocol. It minimizes a Lennard-Jones
function [35], thereby removing much of the signal a
priori. Side chain optimization with a complete scoring
function including other terms might remedy this

problem. The vastly larger utility in a binding context
(Figure 8A), where no such pre-minimization occurs,
further illustrates this point. The test against random
compact structures with constant sequence (Figure 8B)
is more illuminating. It shows that the L-J term needs
the restrictions imposed by other factors (for example,
solvation and secondary structure) to efficiently identify
a protein-like heteropolymer. In other words, it adds
information to the total function, but only when the
solution space is already somewhat restricted.
Generally, the parameterization of both folding and
binding scoring functions is fairly difficult. For instance,
the choice of the reference state (the unfolded or

unbound molecules) has a substantial impact on the calculations. The ruggedness of the optimality landscape in
parameter space makes it quite difficult to find the global optimum, and parameterizing folding and binding
functions separately may lead to inconsistencies between
the two. Future work will explore more sophisticated
approaches to solving these problems.
The specificity of either model is ultimately reflected
by the shape of its stability landscape. As seen both near
the native sequence (Figure 2) and non-native optima
(Figure 6), the physics-based model produces a landscape that is more rugged and has fewer equivalent
minima. This is consistent with theoretical expectations

of the real free energy landscape in both conformational
[3] and sequence [36] space. The result is that the simulated sequences tend to be more conserved, stay near
the starting ("native”) point during simulation, and show
mostly deleterious or neutral mutations. In contrast,
under the informational model populations simply diffuse across a relatively flat sequence landscape with less
co-evolutionary pressure between interacting sites,
rapidly moving away from the starting point. In this
aspect the physics-based model shows more protein-like
and fold-specific behavior overall, despite selecting
sequences with some compositional “quirks”, as discussed above. Informational methods, especially those
built only on pairwise contacts, necessarily lack specificity. For example, all Lys-Phe interactions are not
equivalent. Those oriented in a plane will be repulsive,
while those that are orthogonal will generate a cation-pi
effect and be attractive. This is but one example. Physical models, at the right level of granularity, will not suffer from this problem and are thereby inherently
attractive for this interaction specificity. Further, they
enable study of the forces driving evolutionary processes
at a physical level.
Why then are the native states so far from sequence
optima? The answer is found in the approximations
made by the models. Packing is perhaps the most
severely affected, as can be seen from the accumulation
of large hydrophobic residues in both models. These
substitutions fill up the empty space that results from
the coarse-graining procedure. Spherical Cb beads, for
instance, are a particularly poor approximation for elongated (Lys, Arg, etc.) or flattened (Trp, Phe, etc.) residues. A structural model with more than one bead per
side chain, such as that of Hills and co-workers [37],
could remedy this issue. The representation of ions as
spherical point charges is also problematic, and salt
bridge formation could be better addressed by using a
model of induced dipoles [38]. Many entropic contributions are not considered, although the physics-based
model includes some of them implicitly in the solvation
term. In addition to entropic considerations, explicit
hydrogen bonding [39], cation-pi interactions [40], and
other interactions are not considered, but would
increase model complexity. Finally, an overarching problem may be found in the effect of individual mutations.
A typical disadvantageous mutation under the informational model has a very small effect on the stability
score E(s, c) (eq. 12) (< 0.5 kT units out of tens of kT
units, where k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the
absolute temperature), and the physics-based model
generally predicts even smaller stability changes. In real
proteins the average mutation is strongly deleterious (3
kcal/mol out of a total ΔG of ~10 kcal/mol, where ΔG
is the free energy difference between the unfolded and

Grahnen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:361
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/361

folded protein structure)[41], indicating that the models
are much too lenient when it comes to the cost of
mutation. Appropriate weighting of contributing terms
or more precise modeling of packing would improve
this aspect, and make the energy landscape more realistically rugged.
Early attempts at considering alternative states in the
above models of folding used explicit decoys. Because of
the large number of potential alternative states for a
sequence, both kinetic traps and thermodynamic optima,
evaluating even a large finite number of such states
proved inadequate. Further, identifying the states that
were most informative near the native confirmation was
not clearly driven by fold sequence or geometry and it
may be that the relevant structures originate from smaller regions of diverse structures. The random contacts
model [6] proved powerful and efficient in sampling
many contacts from diverse structures as an implicit
solution.
For binding, there is a greater conundrum in that
while the real biological decoys are not known, a random contacts model has the potential to be too restrictive in selecting against binding interactions that are not
biologically deleterious. For an alternative binding interaction to be deleterious, the proteins need to have a
deleterious interaction (as defined by biological fitness)
and to have the potential to interact at the same time,
in the same cellular location, at the right concentration
[42]. However, the proper decoys are frequently not
known and this restricts the use of the alternative
approach of explicit binding decoys.
Further, when evaluating binding specificity as a function of affinity it is assumed that complex thermodynamic stability (and relatedly, life time) must be
maximized. While this is a relevant constraint for cellular structures such as the nuclear pore complex [43],
protein complexes involved in signaling or even in forming the cytoskeleton have transient associations that are
necessary for functional signaling [44-46]. A requirement of transient binding means that dissociation
kinetics are selected to be just fast enough, not as slow
(corresponding to very stable complexes) as possible.
Therefore, even in the limit of perfect predictions one
should not expect to recover the native binding site
sequence based on thermodynamics alone.
From the perspective of protein structural space [47],
the folding decoys all lie near the native conformation.
The total amount of secondary structure is conserved,
as are the relative percentages of helices and sheets.
This means that the decoys can be thought of as being
sampled from the same Superfamily, or at least Fold, in
the SCOP hierarchy [48]. Conservation of residue exposures and sequence length also guarantees that the conformations have roughly the same radius of gyration as

Page 11 of 18

the native state. This should cause selection against
subtle misfolds and accumulating pathway intermediates, but may be a poor representation of the diversity
of conformations a sequence may fold into and thus
may miss important local alternative conformations that
are close in energy. For example, an increase in residues
with high helical propensity could shift the lowestenergy conformation toward an all-a topology instead of
a+b. The current approach does not allow modeling
this type of event, but evaluation of the partition function of the Boltzmann probability of folding is a notoriously difficult (and currently unsolved) problem [49]. A
critical aspect of characterizing the energy landscape is
the role of decoy structures in restricting the funnel
shape as well as providing fold specificity, and this is a
challenging task.
Recently, the utility of site-interdependent structural
models of sequence evolution was evaluated in the context of phylogenetics [50-52]. Despite use of a variety of
scoring functions and probability measures, the utility of
such models was found to be generally low. Minimizing
a coarse-grained potential failed to recover much of the
native sequence and did not outperform site-independent models [51]. Simulating the effects of substitutions
on folding energy revealed a rapid divergence from the
native state even when modeling solvation in addition to
residue-residue contacts [50], and including the contribution of folding energy to transition path probability
can even decrease tree reconstruction accuracy [52].
These results are all consistent with the nature of the
coarse-grained energy landscape seen above. There is no
global minimum near the native sequence, and its position on a steep slope results in rapid divergence in
terms of sequence, energy or both. Models that accurately characterize the structural effects of substitutions
are urgently needed to make progress in this direction.
It is also worth noting that these approaches all relied
on informational potentials, which we have shown above
to be less structurally specific than physics-based
scoring.
With models that properly characterize the evolution
of proteins, many important evolutionary biological
questions can be addressed. What are the patterns of
sequence evolution associated with different mechanisms of duplicate gene retention? Relatedly, how easily
does orthologous neofunctionalization occur and how
dependent upon protein fold and binding interface size
is it? What are the roles of positive and negative pleiotropy in restricting neofunctionalization? How do structural transitions occur between neighboring folds? At
the contact level, how are different stabilizing interactions interconverted (for example, the transition
between Cys-Cys, cation-pi, and Coulombic interactions)? What is the interplay between population size,

these important evolutionary biology questions, continued progress on models such as described here is
needed.

iterative Markov Chain Monte Carlo refinement of the
replaced side chain geometry. Backbone coordinates
were not adjusted during the replacement procedure,
and c was assumed to be constant throughout.

Conclusions
Proteins evolve according to the laws of physical chemistry, biochemistry, and population genetics. Classic phenomenological site independent models, while
computationally simple to use, do not adequately
describe evolutionary processes for either phylogenetic
or functional evolutionary analysis (comparative genomic) purposes. Mechanistic models built upon the type
described here will be necessary. Biological (for example,
regulatory or metabolic) pathways dictate the level of
constraint on physical constants and such considerations
will also need to be taken. While the currently available
models remain inadequate, an understanding of the problems in physical chemistry associated with evolutionary
models will lead to future improvements, with many
downstream applications.

Scoring protein folding with the physics-based model

Methods
The two-bead model

The protein structure is represented by a reduced twobead model originally described by Levitt [53] and more
recently used by Mukherjee and Bagchi [54] as well as
Grahnen et al. [35]. Each residue is represented by one
backbone bead (Cai) and one side chain bead (Cbi) (Figure 1). The Ca bead is centered on the Ca atom in an
all-atom representation and has a radius of 1.8 Å. For a
residue i (except glycine), the Cbi bead center is placed
at a distance b i from Ca i, which is determined as the
centroid of all the side chain atoms (including the Cai
atom), and assigning a residue-dependent radius ri. Glycine is simply represented with a Ca bead with the
appropriate properties (hydrophobicity etc.). For residue
i, where 2 < = i < = N-2 in a protein with N residues,
we define θi as the angle between Cai-1 , Cai and Cbi,
and i as the torsion angle between Ca i-1 , Ca i , Ca i+1
and Cai+2. Residues within two bonds of the termini do
not have a defined i, and the residues at the N-terminus do not have a defined θi . Finally, rij describes the
distance between the center of any two beads i and j in
the model. In the informational representation of protein structure rij was measured by taking the minimum
distance between the Cb beads in residues i and j (Ca is
substituted for Cb for glycines).
Threading sequences into conformations

To thread a sequence s into a protein backbone conformation c, the side chain replacement algorithm SARA
[35] was used. SARA is a very fast approach based on

To evaluate the fit of a sequence s to a backbone conformation c, where the number of residues N is the
same for both s and c, s is threaded into c (see above)
and then a weighted scoring function V(s, c) is computed:

angle instead of a bead-bead distance:

type is constructed using the same linear scaling of helical propensities used by Mukherjee, but is based on Kim

and Scholtz’s helix propensity scale [32]. Cb is a scaling
constant (0.01) selected to scale the range of torsion
angles to a similar magnitude as the range of bead-bead

Cc is a scaling constant (1,000) selected to scale the

residue type), rij is the distance between beads i and j,
and ε is the dielectric constant of the protein interior
(3.0)[57], with the sum running over all pairs of charged
residues with a SASA (see below) of less than 0.25. This
roughly approximates the strong screening of charged
interactions due to the highly polarizable surrounding
water, and the nearly negligible effects of the largely
non-polarizable interior of the protein [58]. The whole
term is then scaled by a weighting term wion when used
in V(s, c) (eq. 1), so Cc has no effect on the parameterization, but is necessary computationally so as not to
introduce errors due to lack of floating point precision.

hi is the hydrophobicity-based interaction parameter

over all pairs of cysteine residues. This form of Vcys predicts disulfide bonds with a specificity of 0.98, sensitivity
of 0.91 and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.79 as
measured on the structural data set used to construct
SCWRL 3.0 [61].
Finally, wx are weights for each individual term in eq.

Scoring protein-protein interactions with the physicsbased model

When using protein-protein interaction as a measure of
protein function, it becomes necessary to evaluate the
strength of the interaction, a proxy for the free energy
change of binding or the dissociation constant. The
non-covalent terms from the folding scoring function
were adapted to compose an interaction score V(s1, c1,
s2, c2) between a sequence s1 in conformation c1 and a
sequence s2 in conformation c2:
V(s1, c1, s2, c2 ) = wLJ VLJ + wion , Vion − w

VLJ and Vion are the same as above but evaluated for
inter- rather than intra-molecular bead pairs.
VΔsolv is the change in solvation potential upon binding:
V

= Vsolv (s1, c1 ) + Vsolv (s2, c2 ) − Vsolv (complex) (11)

where complex is the bound state. The weights wx are
determined as described below.

features of the composition (the proportion of hydrophobic residues for example) should not change when
simulating biologically realistic protein sequences, this
enables the approximation Zfold ≈ Sgap.
The case of specific protein-protein interaction is simpler due to the lower number of states available. It was
previously shown that specific binding can be adequately
modeled as a combination of selection for the native
ligand and against a single non-specific decoy ligand
[14]. Here this approach is adopted during simulations,
which are described in more detail below.

Calculating folding and binding specificity

Parameterizing the physics-based scoring functions

Folding and binding specificity were evaluated with several considerations. For example, with folding, a given
sequence should have the specified backbone rather
than an alternative as its most stable state and also present a gap between this state and unfolded or misfolded
states. The size of this gap can be measured as a Zscore [62-64]:

It has previously been shown that no single parameterization of an energy function fits all proteins optimally
[34,33]. Therefore the individual weights in the scoring
function were changed for each protein under investigation to maximize Z fold (maximize the specificity of
sequence-structure fit in the context of alternative
states). The parameter space has many dimensions, is
expected to be rugged, and likely contains many local
maxima. In order to sample possible parameter values
efficiently, and avoid becoming trapped in the course of
the search procedure, the Metropolis-Hastings Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [66,67] was
used. Acceptance probability for a move in parameter
space was based on Zfold:

are closer than 4.5 Å, 0 otherwise) and the sum runs
over all residue pairs (i, j) that are separated by more
than four residues in primary sequence.
To evaluate a protein-protein interaction, a protein
complex score is calculated as
E(s1 , c1 , s2 , c2 ) =

Zf old =

i,j

Uab (i, j) C(i, j)

G − Gnat
σ (G)

(13)

(14)

where G is the distribution of free energies (ΔG) in
the alternative conformations, Gnat is the free energy of
folding into the native conformation, and <G> and s(G)
describe the location and dispersal of that distribution.
In other words, Zfold can be interpreted as measuring
the specificity of a protein sequence for its native structure, or equivalently a combination of unfolding and
misfolding stability as well as the preference for the specified fold over alternative folds.
During simulation and sequence sampling, G nat is
approximated by V(s, c) (eq. 1) or E(s, c) (eq. 12) for the
current sequence and a native conformation, and G by
calculation of the same measure for 100 random decoy
conformations. The decoy conformations were generated by independently randomizing each type of geometrical measurement in the native structure, in
accordance with the Random Energy Model (REM) of
Bryngelson and Wolynes [6]. For the informational
model this means randomizing the residue-residue contacts, whereas in the physics-based model the angles,
distances, etc. involved in each term are shuffled. The
fold score gap is then calculated as
Sgap = G − Gnat = σ (G).Zfold

(15)

where <G> is estimated by the median of G. The dispersal s(G) is assumed to be constant. This assumption
is computationally efficient, which is a major consideration when evaluating tens of millions of sequences. Also,
since the dispersal is purely dependent on the amino
acid composition under the REM [65], and the gross

where θk is the set of weights in V(s, c) (eq. 1) for step
k of the Markov chain, and T is the temperature of the
chain. θk is proposed by perturbing qk-1 in each dimension with values drawn from a Gaussian distribution
with mean 0.1 and variance 0.1. The search space was
restricted to (0,1) for all weights, and 100,000 moves
were attempted at T = 0.1. The parameter set with the
largest Zfold found during sampling was retained as the
best set of weights.
To obtain the distribution of non-native scores G
necessary to calculate Z fold in this procedure, a twopronged approach was taken. The goal was to find a set
of weights that makes the native sequence-structure
combination as specific as possible, both with respect to
the fold recognition problem (which conformation does
a fixed sequence fold into?) and the inverse folding problem (which sequence best fits a fixed conformation?).
Because random sequences may fold into alternative
structures, the random sequences also play a role in
parameterizing the fold recognition problem, where having a hydrophobic core and preferring a given backbone
to an alternative state is not enough. To address

specificity of conformation, 1,000 decoy conformations
were generated as described above to obtain the distribution of scores G struct . Specificity of sequence was
addressed by sampling 1,000 random sequences of the
same length as the native sequence (with equal probability of drawing any amino acid), threading each one
through the native conformation, and obtaining from
these the distribution of scores Gseq. For each score G,
composed of individual term scores from V(s, c) (eq. 1),
the value of each term score was re-scaled such that the
overall term-specific distributions of values were of
equal range. The full distribution G was formed by the
union of Gstruct and Gseq for each ϴk.
When threading random sequences, or randomly perturbing the native conformation, the resulting score distribution is noticeably skewed (data not shown). In
particular, the Lennard-Jones potential produces a long
tail of very large scores due to steric clashes. This is not
unexpected since not all structures can accommodate all
sequences [68], but it does make mean and variance
poor estimators of location and dispersal. Fortunately,
the probability of observing a sequence s in a particular
conformation c follows a Boltzmann distribution:
p( G(s, c), T) =

ΔG is the free energy of folding, k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the absolute temperature. It follows that
only those alternative conformations with large negative
ΔG contribute greatly to this probability, or equivalently
that only those decoys with very low scores V(s, c) (eq.
1) are important for folding specificity. Therefore the
median was used as a location estimator, and the difference between the first quartile and the median as the
estimator of dispersal.
To choose the term weights for a particular proteinprotein interaction, the same procedure was carried out,
but only with respect to sequence specificity in one
binding partner. The score distribution Gseq was generated by threading 1,000 random sequences through the
constant conformation of one binding partner (while the
other partner is kept constant in both sequence and
structure), and scoring the resulting complex using V(s1,
c1, s2, c2) (eq. 10) described above. In other words, s2 is
randomly sampled while s1, c1 and c2 remain constant.
It is then possible to calculate a gap score Zbind in the
same manner as Zfold:
Zbind =

Gbind − Gbind
nat
σ (Gbind)

(18)

where Gbind = Gseq. Weight parameters wx can then
be chosen using the MCMC algorithm described above
(eq. 16).
Sampling sequences

Once a set of weights for V(s, c) (eq. 1) are obtained
(the parameters Uab of E(s, c) in eq. 12 are fixed), the
folding score gap landscape and its minima in sequence
space were characterized for both scoring functions by
varying s. Sequences were sampled based on Sgap (eq.
15) both near to and far from the native state using a
typical [69] MCMC approach, with acceptance probability:
p(sk ) =

1
s (s )−s (s )
e gap k Tgap k−1

if Sgap (sk ) > Sgap (sk−1 )
(19)
otherwise

where each step k was a single substitution in the protein sequence.
For near-native sampling two temperatures were
employed: a very high temperature for nearly unbiased
sampling (T = 10 for the informational function E(s, c)
of eq. 12, T = 50 for the physics-based function V(s, c)
of eq. 1) and a lower temperature to find local minima
(T = 0.1 for E(s, c), T = 1.5 for V(s, c)). The low temperature was chosen to make the chain capable of passing the barrier in the energy landscape caused by an
average deleterious substitution under the informational
model (~0.1 units of E(s, c)) with a reasonably high
probability (~0.1). This was also calibrated with respect
to the expected fraction of sequences with better folding
stability for real proteins and indirectly on dN/dS. The
high temperature was chosen to make the sampling
nearly independent of Sgap (> 0.95 expected acceptance
probability). Temperatures for the physics-based function were then chosen such that the actual acceptance
frequencies obtained from sampling under the informational model were reproduced. Differences in the
observed dN/dS ratios between the physics-based and
informational models were due to differences in the ruggedness of the landscape and its sequence context
dependence (local ruggedness).
To increase sample density, divergence of the chains
from the starting state was restricted to 5%-30%, in
increments of 5%, and two chains were run at each temperature and divergence limit. The number of attempted
steps was adjusted to obtain ~8,500 unique samples for
each function. Samples were projected onto a twodimensional representation of sequence space using
Sammon mapping [70] and score surfaces were calculated using Gnuplot v 4.2.
To discover regions of the landscape where most
mutations are destabilizing (i.e Sgap is near a maximum),
an important feature of biological protein sequences

Grahnen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:361
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/361

leading to observed dN/dS ratios, ten replicate chains
attempting 100,000 steps were run for each function at
the lower sampling temperature without any divergence
restrictions. The chains were thinned by taking every
fourth unique sample and the final 100 such samples
were retained, resulting in 1,000 unique samples for
each scoring function. Samples were Sammon-mapped
and sequence logos [71] were calculated to assess convergence. Structural properties of the sampled equilibria
were further characterized by projecting the consensus
sequence at each position with > 2 bits of information
onto the protein conformation.

per generation at the DNA level, with transitions being
twice as probable as tranversions. To obtain a thermodynamically stable starting point, non-native optima of
Sgap (eq. 15) in protein sequence space were sampled as
described above and a starting DNA sequence was randomly selected from the reverse translation of those
samples.
In each generation, the mutated DNA sequence in
each organism was translated to protein, threaded
through the native SAP conformation cprotein , and the
fitness calculated as
w(s) =

Measuring scoring performance

To test the accuracy of the scoring functions, Zfold was
calculated for the native sequence and 1,000 random
sequences. The test was performed on the same diverse
set of structures used in the development of the side
chain replacement method employed [35].
The interaction score was tested by a similar scoring
procedure. In this case a subset of the structures from
the PepX database [72], which describes protein-peptide
interactions, was constructed. As for the folding score
test set, 100 structures (25 from each major SCOP
Class) were selected, each a centroid of a cluster of
binding interfaces at the 3 Å-75% level of PepX. For
each Class with more than 25 available centroids, the
structures were sorted by average B-factor across the
binding interface, and the 25 structures with the lowest
B-factor were selected. A list of these structures can be
found in Additional File 1. Z bind was calculated as
described above (eq 18) for the native peptide sequence
and a set of 1,000 random peptide sequences for each
complex.
In addition, the distribution of weights for each term
in V(s, c) (eq. 1) and V(s1, c1, s2, c2) (eq. 10) across the
structural data sets was generated to compare the relative importance of the terms. The effect on the gap
score of using each term individually was also examined.
Furthermore, the numerical stability of the MCMC algorithm for choosing weights and the characteristics of the
parameter-stability landscape were probed by producing
eight different sets of non-native scores G for the SAP
protein, and re-running the parameterization 100 times
for each set.
Simulating sequences

As a test of the utility of the methods in an evolutionary
context, simulations were performed under negative
selection for protein folding and binding. In a manner
similar to that of Rastogi et al. [11], a population of
1,000 virtual organisms containing a single copy of the
SAP protein [25] (PDB ID: 1D4T) was evolved for
200,000 generations at a rate of 10-5 mutations per bp

(20)

where Sgap(s) is the fold gap score (eq. 15) of the current sequence s, S gap start is the fold gap score of the
starting sequence, Vbind(s) is the binding score V(s, cprotein, sligand, cligand) (eq. 10), sligand and cligand correspond
to the SLAM peptide (the native ligand of SAP), Vbindstart
is the binding score of the starting protein sequence
to the same ligand, and Vdecoy(s) is the binding score V
(s, cprotein, sdecoy, cligand) for a decoy ligand. Simulations
under the informational model used E(s, c) (eq. 12) to
compute S gap and E(s1 , c1 , s2 , c2 ) (eq. 13) to compute
binding scores. In other words, mutations that make the
protein or the protein-ligand complex less stable than
the starting point are infinitely deleterious, mutations
that maintain those stabilities but enable binding of the
decoy ligand are somewhat deleterious, and all other
changes are neutral. Organisms were then propagated to
the next generation by random sampling weighted by
fitness w (eq. 20), with replacement, while maintaining a
constant population size.
The decoy ligand were constructed by threading a
sequence s decoy = IWMTIYMIIIT through the SLAM
peptide conformation cligand for the informational function, and sdecoy = RLPTIYICITG for the physics-based
function. Both sequences are variations on the experimentally determined XXXTIYXX(VI)XX SAP-binding
motif [25], and do not bind the protein at the starting
point of the simulation.
Finally, each simulation was replicated 10×, and the
resulting sequences analyzed. Structural patterns of evolutionary rates (dN/dS) were measured by comparing
sequences to the original sequence and calculating
according to the PBL method [73,16], and the distribution of position-specific residue preference was compared with that in the Pfam database [30] for the same
fold by constructing sequence logos [71] from the
evolved sequences. The sequences were also tested for
emergence of rate heterogeneity by assessing the superior fit of the data to the rates-across-sites model over an
equal-rates model using ProtTest [74]. To discern if the

hydrophobic core and hydrophilic surface the proportion of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in parts of
the protein were measured before and after simulation.
