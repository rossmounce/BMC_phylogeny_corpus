Abstract
Background: Blood feeding evolved independently in worms, arthropods and mammals. Among the adaptations
to this peculiar diet, these animals developed an armament of salivary molecules that disarm their host’s antibleeding defenses (hemostasis), inflammatory and immune reactions. Recent sialotranscriptome analyses (from the
Greek sialo = saliva) of blood feeding insects and ticks have revealed that the saliva contains hundreds of
polypeptides, many unique to their genus or family. Adult tsetse flies feed exclusively on vertebrate blood and are
important vectors of human and animal diseases. Thus far, only limited information exists regarding the Glossina
sialome, or any other fly belonging to the Hippoboscidae.
Results: As part of the effort to sequence the genome of Glossina morsitans morsitans, several organ specific, high
quality normalized cDNA libraries have been constructed, from which over 20,000 ESTs from an adult salivary gland
library were sequenced. These ESTs have been assembled using previously described ESTs from the fat body and
midgut libraries of the same fly, thus totaling 62,251 ESTs, which have been assembled into 16,743 clusters (8,506
of which had one or more EST from the salivary gland library). Coding sequences were obtained for 2,509 novel
proteins, 1,792 of which had at least one EST expressed in the salivary glands. Despite library normalization, 59
transcripts were overrepresented in the salivary library indicating high levels of expression. This work presents a
detailed analysis of the salivary protein families identified. Protein expression was confirmed by 2D gel
electrophoresis, enzymatic digestion and mass spectrometry. Concurrently, an initial attempt to determine the
immunogenic properties of selected salivary proteins was undertaken.
Conclusions: The sialome of G. m. morsitans contains over 250 proteins that are possibly associated with blood
feeding. This set includes alleles of previously described gene products, reveals new evidence that several salivary
proteins are multigenic and identifies at least seven new polypeptide families unique to Glossina. Most of these
proteins have no known function and thus, provide a discovery platform for the identification of novel
pharmacologically active compounds, innovative vector-based vaccine targets, and immunological markers of
vector exposure.

Background
The superfamily Hippoboscoidea comprises higher flies
(Suborder Brachycera Schizophora: Calyptrate), which
includes the tsetse, louse flies, and the bird and bat flies
[1]. These flies have in common the unusual ovoviviparous reproductive process. All adults are exclusively
blood feeders on mammals or other vertebrates, suggesting that hematophagy is a monophyletic trait in this

group [2]. The family Glossinidae has a single genus,
Glossina, which comprises 31 species and sub-species of
tsetse flies. Tsetse (which means fly in the south African
Tswana language) are today found exclusively in subSaharan Africa and are of both medical and veterinary
importance because they are vectors of African trypanosomes to humans and domesticated animals [3]. Surprisingly, blood is a very unbalanced meal, lacking many
vitamins for example, and perhaps for this reason, tsetse
flies have mutualistic endosymbionts that are required
for successful fly reproduction, digestion and nutrition
[4,5]. The intricate relationship between the parasites

and the mutualistic endosymbionts indicate that the origin of blood feeding in this genus is ancient, probably
during or before the mammal radiation of 60 million
years ago (MYA). Indeed Glossina fossils from 38 MYA
were found in the Florissant formation (Colorado), and
also in Germany, indicating these flies were probably
distributed worldwide 30-40 MYA [2].
Blood sucking arthropods must deal with their hosts’
defense against blood loss (hemostasis based on blood
clotting, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction), as
well as their defenses triggered by inflammation and
immunity mechanisms. These defences may cause death
to the insect or, at the least, interrupt bloodmeal acquistion. The saliva of haematophagous arthropods can counteract these barriers by using a complex mixture of
pharmacologically active components, which are injected
into the host skin during the probing and ingestion
phases of feeding [6,7]. Accordingly, at the site of skin
penetration, the hosts’ response is pharmacologically
modified by these salivary agents, which may inadvertently lead to enhanced transmission of pathogens. For
this reason, the salivary contents of these vectors are not
only a source of novel pharmaceuticals, but also can provide vaccine targets to interrupt disease transmission [8].
In the past 9 years, analysis of the salivary transcriptomes of bloodfeeding arthropods, including several genera within the ticks [9], triatomines [10-12], fleas [13],
sand flies [8,14], Culicoides [15,16] and mosquitoes
[17-21], have indicated that saliva contains a cocktail of
70 - 150 proteins (insects) to several hundreds of proteins (ticks, which feed for several days on their hosts).
Because the evolution of blood feeding among insects
occurred independently several times, the composition
of the sialome differs substantially among insects not
sharing a common blood feeding ancestor, thus representing a classical case of convergent evolution. However, variation among sialomes within the same family
and even within the same genus is also observed [22],
indicating the fast evolution of these proteins possibly
due to host immune pressure. Indeed almost every
genus of tick, mosquito or sand fly studied so far has
novel proteins or protein families without similarity to
any other known protein.
The non-redundant (NR) protein database of GenBank
currently (Oct/2009) contains 156 proteins derived from
the Glossina genus, 17 of which are annotated as found
in the insect’s salivary glands. These proteins were identified while characterizing a tsetse salivary anti-thrombin
peptide [23], which molecularly defined some of the biological anti-haemostatic activities described before
[24,25]. Salivary adenosine deaminases, antigen-5 related
proteins [26,27] and endonucleases of the TSAL family
have also been previously described. A limited transcriptome analysis of Glossina morsitans saliva identified

eight additional proteins, including a proline rich protein, glycine-glutamate rich proteins, and a novel member of the TSAL endonuclease family [28]. In the
present work, over 20,000 clones were sequenced from a
normalized cDNA library from G. morsitans morsitans
and analyzed in combination with previously described
ESTs from adult tsetse fat body [29] and midgut [30],
permitting a uniquely detailed analysis of the sialome of
a haematophagous Dipteran.

Results and Discussion
cDNA library characteristics

A total of 22,794 clones from the salivary gland (SG)
cDNA library of G. m. morsitans were assembled and
merged, using a combination BLAST and CAP3 pipeline
[31], with 19,998 previously reported ESTs from the fat
body (FB) [29] and 19,459 ESTs from the midgut (MG)
[30]. This EST assembly version dated 06/07/2007 was
used in all analyses reported in the present study and
comprises 62,251 ESTs assembled into 16,743 clusters
(including 9,686 singletons), of which 8,506 had one or
more sequences from the salivary gland cDNA library.
A subsequent assembly version dated 12/17/2008 was
produced by the International Glossina Genomics Initiative (IGGI) Consortium. Both versions are available
from http://www.genedb.org. (Throughout the manuscript we will use the name contig or cluster to indicate
both contigs and singletons).
Based on various BLAST sequence comparisons to
several databases (see methods and Additional file 1),
these clusters were functionally characterized in the following groups: Putative secreted (S), putative housekeeping (H), transposable element derived (TE), of viral
(V) and microbial (M) origins, and of unknown class
(U), because they could not be classified (some of which
may be derived from untranslated regions of mRNA’s
(Table 1)). While most sialotranscriptomes completed to
date have the larger set of ESTs attributed to the S
class, it is possible that library normalization allowed for
the H class to contain the larger number of ESTs (78.5%
of the 22,794 ESTs) as well as of contigs (92% of the
8,506 contigs) (Table 1). Nonetheless, the S group still
comprised 20% of the ESTs, and the ratio of ESTs per
contig was the highest of all, with an average of eight
ESTs per contig, biased by the high number of ESTs in
particular salivary families, as will be indicated further
below.
The H class was further characterized (again based on
similarities to various databases, in particular the KOG
and Gene Ontology databases) into 21 functional groups
(Table 2), the unknown conserved class being the most
prevalent [32].
Transposable element sequences are commonly found
in sialotranscriptome. The sialotranscriptome of G. m.

morsitans revealed both TE class I and class II transcripts, including mariner and piggyBac transposases
and retrovirus sequences. These sequences may represent active transposition, or, more likely, the expression
of regulatory sequences that might suppress the DNA
transposition phenomena [33].
The few M class of transcripts found in the salivary
glands were so classified due to their strong match to
predicted bacterial proteins, including the genera Neisseria and Rhizobium. These clearly do not derive from
the vector (E. coli), although they could be due to contamination or mislabeling of sequences, rather from
being of symbiotic origin. A few transcripts also
matched Trypanosoma brucei, as shown in additional

file 1. These trypanosome sequences were found in the
midgut EST library because parasite infected midgut
material was used for the EST construction [29]. Finally
the V class includes transcripts from the recently
described Glossina pallidipes salivary gland hypertrophy
virus [34-36], and also a polyprotein from a picorna-like
virus, never described before and possibly specific for
the salivary glands because all 17 transcripts were found
only in the SG library.
The assembly of this multiple tissue EST set allows
sequence frequency comparisons from different tissues
by a Chi-square test. Accordingly, we found a total of
401 clusters that were significantly over or under
expressed in one of the 3 libraries, 327 of which were

associated with increased or decreased salivary gland
transcript abundance. Of these 327 clusters, 59 were significantly over expressed, further implicating a specific
salivary gland function (See worksheet named Sg-Upregulated in additional file 1), as will be described in more
detail in the following sections.
The assembly of the three libraries also increased EST
coverage for the gene products expressed on multiple
tissues. We accordingly obtained 2,509 protein coding
sequences with no full matches on GenBank, 2,279 of
which are possibly full length proteins, the remaining
being fragments of coding sequences that are considered of relevance to further studies. Of these deduced
coding sequences, 1,792 were found expressed in the
salivary glands by 1 or more EST, and include several
that are mostly or solely found expressed in this secretory organ.

Analysis of the Glossina m. morsitans sialotranscriptome

Several clusters of sequences coding for housekeeping
and putative secreted polypeptides (indicated in additional file 1) are abundant and complete enough to
extract consensus sequences that are typically absent
from either GenBank or Swissprot. These sequences
were grouped together in additional file 2, which also
includes proteins previously described and deposited in
GenBank. These are identifiable by their accession number (gi|), where the novel proteins have a GM prefix.
The new coding sequences dicussed in this work were
submitted to GenBank and have the accessions
EZ421978-EZ424487. A detailed description of the sialotranscriptome of G. m. morsitans is provided to serve as
a guide to browsing the two additional files.

including familiar ubiquitous families of unknown function, such as antigen-5 and the yellow protein family.
Protease inhibitors of the Kunitz and serpin families
were also found, in addition to the previously described
Glossina salivary anti-thrombin, and these may be associated with anti-clotting or anti-complement activities.
Many of the transcripts reported are also linked to
insect immunity and include serine proteases associated
with prophenoloxidase activation cascades, as well as
proteins related to pathogen recognition. Several other

Enzymes acting on nucleotides

Several transcripts found in the sialotranscriptome of
G. m. morsitans encode proteins with sequence similarity to several secreted nucleotidases, ribonucleases,
including endonucleases, exonucleases, 5’-nucleotidase/
apyrases and adenosine deaminases, as follows:

Alves-Silva et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/213

Endonucleases Two putative proteins named Tsal 1 and
Tsal 2 (this latter with two forms, A and B) were
described in a previous sialotranscriptome of G. m. morsitans [27,28]. Not surprisingly, these genes were highly
expressed in the salivary gland transcriptomes when
compared to the two other tissue libraries. For example,
in the salivary gland library, 2,874 EST’s code for Tsal 1,
but only 21 ESTs coding for this protein are found in
the two other libraries. This library expression pattern is
in accordance with previous work that determined
Tsal 1 and Tsal 2 to be specifically expressed in the
adult salivary glands by RT-PCR experiments [27].
These proteins had sequence similarity to endonucleases, but their function in tsetse saliva is unknown.
These proteins were highly abundant (>40% of the total
protein content) in G. m. morsitans saliva [28] and
induced a strong humoral response in the mammalian
host [37]. Sialotranscriptomes of sand flies have also
revealed this family of proteins [14,38]. Recently, a salivary endonuclease of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus was cloned and the recombinant protein was
expressed and shown to have activity toward doublestranded DNA. Strong salivary activity against the same
substrate was also found [39]. It was postulated that this
activity may decrease host tissue viscosity to facilitate
diffusion of salivary pharmacological components
through the dermis, and/or to produce small DNA fragments that have been demonstrated to have anti-hemostatic activity [40]. Additional file 2 shows 19 sequences
with similarity to endonucleases (nine of which are full
length) and includes the previously described proteins as
well. Alignment of these sequences and phylogeny
reconstruction (Figure 1) together suggest that these
proteins resulted from gene duplication events leading
to at least eight genes or more if there are genes coding
for similar proteins. Accordingly, clade I in Figure 1 has
strong bootstrap support for at least two related gene
families, but includes in the same family individuals
with more than 10% amino acid divergence, making it
feasible that clade I is comprised of four genes. Clade II
shows a possible polymorphic gene, with GM-8 and
GM-9 being alleles of the previously described protein
coded by gi|8927464. Clade III has possibly two closely
related genes with two alleles each. Other genes may
code for GM-9 and possibly GM-13, thus adding up to
a minimum number of eight genes coding for this protein family. The abundance of these alleles may result
from host immune pressure creating a scenario of
balanced polymorphism and fast evolution. If this is the
case, these proteins should be quite divergent in flies
from the same genus and may represent good species
markers, as has been demonstrated with the expanded
family of triatomine lipocalins [41].

The active center region of Culex endonuclease aligns
well with bacterial and vertebrate endonucleases of the
same family, including the enzyme from Serratia marcescens which has been crystallized, and the ten amino
acids making substrate contact identified [42]. When
compared to S. marcescens endonuclease, the Culex
enzyme has conservation for all these amino acids (see
Figure 1 in [39]). However, three of these substrate contacting amino acids are mutated in the Glossina proteins
(Figure 2). Notably the substitutions are quite divergent
(R -> P/E, H->Q and N ->F/Y), raising the doubt
whether the tsetse proteins display endonuclease activity
or whether this protein family has evolved to perform a
different function. This anomaly has been detected previously in fleas, where an expansion of the acidic phosphatase protein family was identified in Xenopsylla
cheopis. Members of the phosphatase family account for
most of the salivary protein of this flea, but it has no
phosphatase activity and all amino acids that should
contact the substrate have been altered [13]. The role of
the endonuclease protein family in Glossina remains to
be identified.
Ribonucleases Ribonuclease-like gene products containing a signal peptide were previously identified in the sialotranscriptomes of Anopheles gambiae [18] and Aedes
aegypti [20], but neither their presence in saliva nor
their function have been elucidated. Similarly, the salivary transcriptome of G. m. morsitans reveals two ribonuclease transcripts, one with a clear signal indicative of
secretion (GM-1457), and the other with a borderline
indication of secretion (GM-1723). GM-1457 belongs to
the T2 family of ribonucleases, and is 60% identical to
the RNaseX25 of D. melanogaster that belongs to a ubiquitous protein family [43]. This enzyme type was also
reported in the sialotranscriptome of Ae. aegypti and the
Glossina homolog is about 41% identical to the mosquito enzyme. Transcripts for GM-1475 were also found
in the fat body and midgut, indicating ubiquitous tissue
expression of this enzyme. The second ribonuclease,
GM-1723 is similar to ribonucleases of Ceratitis capitata, which were shown to be a ubiquitous family [44]
and was also found in the sialotranscriptome of the tick
Ixodes scapularis [45]. Six transcripts were found for
this enzyme in the salivary gland transcriptome, but
none in the fat body or midgut libraries, suggesting an
increased expression of this gene product in the salivary
glands. Recently it was reported that a ribonuclease of
the T2 family is a major component of Schistosome eggs
responsible for conditioning dendritic cells for Th2
polarization [46].
Exonucleases Four transcripts coding for 3’-5’ exonucleases are shown in additional file 2, one of which has
a clear signal peptide indicative of secretion. To the

extent the salivary endonucleases are active, it is tempting to speculate that these transcripts could function in
the further degradation of the endonuclease products. It
is also possible that these exonucleases can hydrolyze
diadenosine nucleotides such as Ap4A or Ap5A, which
are pro-inflammatory purines released by platelets
[47,48].

5’-nucleotidases/apyrases Enzymes that hydrolyze ATP
or ADP to AMP and orthophosphate (ATP-diphosphohydrolase or apyrase) are ubiquitously found in the saliva and salivary gland homogenates of blood sucking
insects and ticks [7], and were detected in Glossina salivary homogenates almost 30 years ago [24]. These
enzymes are thought to increase the invertebrate fitness

during feeding in two ways: first by decreasing local host
hemostasis when ADP, released by damaged cells,
induces platelet aggregation and second by decreasing
neutrophil activation when ATP (also released by
damaged cells and platelets) leads to neutrophil degranulation [6]. Indeed Glossina salivary homogenates inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro [24].
At least three gene families have been proposed to fulfill the apyrase task among different arthropods. Bed
bugs and sand flies have opted for the Ca++ dependent
Cimex family of apyrases [49,50], mosquitoes and kissing
bugs of the genus Triatoma for the 5’-nucleotidase
family [51-53], and fleas may possibly use the CD-39
gene family [13]. The G. m. morsitans sialotranscriptome indicates the presence of at least four different
transcripts coming from possibly three different genes
that belong to the 5’ nucleotidase gene family. These
transcripts match NCBI deposited proteins from G. m.
morsitans annotated as salivary 5’ nucleotidase from an
unpublished work (gi|14488055 and gi|126143295). GM784 is 99% identical to gi|14488055 and is probably an
allele. GM-541 is a truncated transcript identical to gi|
126143295, but GM-541 is only 89% identical to gi|
126143295 and 68% identical to gi|14488055 and may
be derived from a different gene. The protein coded by
gi|14488055 has EST expression in all three libraries (38
ESTs), however it has increased representation in the
salivary gland library (25 ESTs). On the other hand,
GM-541 has ten ESTs in the salivary gland library and
none in the other two libraries, indicating a possible
increased salivary expression of this gene product. These
5’ nucleotidase sequences match the haematophagous
horse fly salivary protein named chrysoptin precursor,
which has been described as an inhibitor of collagen
induced platelet aggregation [54], a function that would
be performed by apyrases.
5’ Nucleotidases are typically extracellular proteins
bound to the membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI) anchors attached to their carboxyterminal domain.
However, secreted 5’nucleotidase/apyrases lack the

amino acids needed for anchor attachment [20,21,38,52],
either through mutation or truncation. Alignment of
bovine, rat, Drosophila, Glossina and tabanid sequences
(Figure 3) clearly shows that the sequences derived from
the bloodfeeding Diptera lack the GPI anchor attachment domain, thus inferring that these proteins are
secreted. Whether a member of the 5’ nucleotidase performs the apyrase function in Glossina remains to be
determined.
In relation to apyrase, a homolog for the Cimex apyrase was also found in the Glossina transcriptome, indicated by one EST each from the salivary gland and from
the midgut libraries. Although this enzyme was first
described in Cimex salivary glands [49], it was later
found to be part of a ubiquitous protein family including intracellular enzymes [55]. GM-8153 is truncated in
its 5’ region and accordingly it cannot be determined if
the protein would be secreted or not. However, the
D. melanogaster homolog does not have a signal peptide
indicative of secretion, nor do the homologs of Ae.
aegypti or An. gambiae, indicating that this apyrase is
an intracellular enzyme from a conserved apyrase subfamily. Because the Cimex type enzyme is strictly Ca++
dependent, evaluation of the divalent cation dependence
of the salivary apyrase of Glossina could help to sort out
the apyrase family. The work of Mant and Parker in
1981 demonstrated apyrase activity only in the presence
of calcium ions [24], thus not allowing distinction
between apyrase family types. If the salivary apyrase of
Glossina works with Mg++ in the presence of EGTA, the
Cimex type of apyrase could be excluded from contributing to the activity.
Adenosine deaminase Expression of genes coding for
salivary adenosine deaminases (ADA) have been
described previously in G. m. morsitans [27] and have
been a common finding in the sialotranscriptomes of
blood sucking Diptera, including sand flies [56,57] and
culicine (but not anopheline) mosquitoes [58]. Additional file 1 presents eight protein sequences that belong
to the ADA family, including the previously described

gi|5817644 and one possible allele coded by GM-1228.
This gene is abundantly expressed (27 ESTs) but not
exclusively in the salivary glands, where ten ESTs were
found. GM-536 codes for a novel adenosine deaminase
having 54% identity to the D. melanogaster homolog,
having 16 salivary ESTs from 21 total. GM-5870 and
GM-537 are putative full length, but shorter versions of
ADA enzymes with four ESTs each in the salivary
library and none in the others. Finally, GM-547 and
GM-2098 code for truncated transcripts of the ADA
family, with only one, and two ESTs exclusively found
in the salivary gland library. Combined, these results
indicate that at least seven genes code for salivary gland
ADA enzymes, some of which may be uniquely
expressed in this tissue. It has been proposed that the
function of this enzyme activity in haematophagous saliva may be to convert adenosine, a pain inducer and
mast cell degranulating agonist, into inosine, that has >
ten fold less degranulating activity [58].
Other enzymes
Hyaluronidase
Salivary hyaluronidase has been described before in the
sialotranscriptomes of Culex quinquefasciatus and sand
flies [21,38]. In addition, the activity has been demonstrated in the salivary glands of sand flies and black flies
[59,60], where it may be adaptive to the insect by
increasing the spread of pharmacological agents into the
host skin, analogous to the “spreading factor” of bacteria
that was later shown to be hyaluronidase [61]. Contigs
4069 and 4070 in additional file 1 represent partial
sequences of hyaluronidases that might assist in such a
salivary function if they are secreted in saliva.
Phospholipases
The sialotranscriptome of G. m. morsitans indicates
expression of several esterases and phospholipases possessing a signal peptide indicative of secretion. One of
these is similar to secreted phospholipase A2 (PLA2)
and the other two are similar to lysophospholipases. To
the extent that these enzymes are secreted in the saliva,
they might produce pharmacologically active lipids in
the site of the feeding, or help to hemolyse the erythrocytes after ingestion. Phospholipases have been found
before in haematophagous arthropod sialotranscriptomes. PLA2 activity was previously demonstrated in
tick saliva [62,63], and a phospholipase C activity found
in Culex quinquefasciatus saliva and salivary gland
homogenates destroys the lipid platelet aggregation agonist PAF (Platelet activating factor) [64].
Nitric Oxide synthase
A total of 22 ESTs were found exclusively in the salivary
gland library coding for different portions of nitric oxide
synthase (NOS). Three ESTs were also found encoding
NOS interacting protein, with this last cluster also having two ESTs discovered in the fat body library

Page 9 of 28

(additional file 1). These transcripts either indicate the
salivary glands utilize NOS as a signaling molecule, or
that NOS or a NOS-adduct may be secreted in the saliva to produce anti-platelet and vasodilatory activities, as
is the case with the hemipterans Rhodnius prolixus [65]
and Cimex lectularius [66]. Of the three EST clusters
coding for NOS, one codes for the amino terminal portion and the other two for overlapping regions of the
carboxy terminus (Figure 4). The reason these last two
clusters did not assemble together is due to differential
splicing of the NOS message (Figure 5). The NOS gene
in vertebrates is known to generate many alternative
splice variants with importance to differential tissue
expression, enzyme activity [67] and even, erection of
the penis [68]. Further investigation of the NOS isoforms in the salivary glands of Glossina is warranted.
GM-5084 represents the protein sequence of the Glossina homologue of the nitric oxide synthase interacting
protein (NOSIP), which is an endogenous inhibitor of
the enzyme important for the regulation of NO output
in neuronal cells [69].
Prostaglandin E2 synthase
Two ESTs from the salivary gland library, together with
three from the fat body library assembled to provide for
the protein sequence named GM-4956, which has the
CDD domains GST_C_mPGES and GST_N_mPGES2
indicative of the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase
Type 2 (mPGES2) subfamily. This enzyme may produce
an endogenous mediator of salivary gland function, or
may indicate that tsetse saliva may contain PGE2, which
is a potent skin vasodilator [70]. PGE2 and other lipid
mediators have been found in the saliva of ticks [71-75],
but so far never characterized in insect saliva.
Serine Proteases
Trypsin-like serine proteases play a role in digestion,
where relatively small enzymes (about 220 aa in length)
are found that lack substrate specificity. Larger enzymes
function in more specific ways, for example, in the activation of proteolytic cascades of immunity pathways
(such as activating the prophenoloxidase enzyme that
produces pathogen melanization) [76,77]. These larger
enzymes have additional domains that confer unique
specificity to substrate proteins that will fit into the catalytic groove of the enzyme, or associate the enzyme in
multimeric complexes [78,79]. Thirty three clusters,
with a total of 54 ESTs from the salivary gland library
code for proteins of the serine protease family with at
least one EST present in the salivary gland library
(Additional file 1). Additional file 2 provides for the full
as well truncated sequence of 25 such enzymes, which
includes two sequences previously described during the
analysis of the G. m. morsitans fat body library [29], as
well as the analysis of the proventriculus cDNA library
[80]. It is possible that the majority of these enzymes

function in insect immune pathways, which is indicated
by their size and ubiquitous library expression. However,
GM-5815 codes for a serine protease of 406 aa with 50%
identity to a Drosophila enzyme. Four ESTs were
detected in the salivary gland library but no other
library. Similarly, 11 other sequences coding for serine
proteases were found exclusively in the salivary gland
library. To the extent that some of these proteins are
secreted in saliva, they could act as plasminogen activators, on fibrinolysis or protein C activation. However,
previous work with G. m. morsitans salivary gland
homogenates failed to detect plasminogen activators or
fibrinolytic enzymes [25]. It remains to be verified
whether any trypsin-like activity is released into Glossina
saliva.
Phosphatases and collagenase
Additional file 2 provides for one full and one partial
sequence coding for a phosphatase of the acidic/lysosomal type as indicated by the KOG database. These
enzymes indeed may be lysosomal, but are highlighted
here because fleas have co- opted this gene family to be

abundantly expressed in their salivary glands. GM-6557
codes for a fragment matching a KOG entry indicative
of collagenase-related metalloprotease, which could play
a role in blood feeding, if secreted.
Protease inhibitors
Anti-thrombin peptide
The salivary anti-clotting of G. m. morsitans was previously identified as an anti-thrombin [25], and was later
molecularly characterized as a small (53 aa) and unique
peptide [23]. Only one EST for this peptide was found
in the salivary gland cDNA library, despite the abundance of this product in the salivary glands of adult
Glossina. This poor representation may be the result of
the library normalization protocol and the removal of
small transcripts, pointing to the possibility that small
transcripts coding for peptides may be lost when this
library design is used.
Serpins
Additional file 2 also presents sequence for five members of the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) family of
proteins that were found expressed in the salivary glands

Figure 5 Differential splicing of the nitric oxide synthase gene product in the salivary glands of Glossina morsitans morsitans. The blue
lines are above regions of differential splicing.

(all of which have been described in previous work analyzing the fat body transcriptome of G. m. morsitans
[29]). The ubiquitous tissue expression of these serpins
indicates they may function primarily in the control of
proteolytic cascades such as in prophenoloxidase activation [81]. Notwithstanding this, a serpin family member
contributes to the anti-clotting activity of Aedes aegypti
saliva, which specifically blocks Factor Xa of the blood
coagulation cascade [82].
Kunitz domain peptide
The Kunitz domain was first identified in serine protease inhibitors of vertebrates, such as the bovine pulmonary trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and found later to be
ubiquitously present in animals and plants. Potent inhibitors of the clotting cascade are found in proteins containing two or more such domains, each one interacting
with a different protease of the hydrolytic cascade, as

found in tick saliva [83,84]. Single Kunitz peptides also
exist, and these may display additional activities such as
antimicrobial [85], channel blocking, as recently characterized for a tick salivary protein [86], or inhibitors of
other enzymes [87]. The protein sequence named GM16650, derived from a single EST found in the SG
library, codes for a single Kunitz peptide with signal
sequence indicative of secretion, whose function remains
to be identified.
Small molecule binding families
The secreted small protein coded by GM-1704 is a
member of the insect pheromone binding family as indicated by its PFAM match. It is also similar to an ejaculatory bulb protein from Drosophila as indicated by a
SwissProt match. Similarly, GM-4458 codes for a member of the phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein.
ESTs from all three libraries are represented in both

Alves-Silva et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/213

assemblies, indicating these proteins are not salivary
gland specific. It should be remarked here that proteins
of the odorant binding family are abundantly expressed
in the salivary glands of haematophagous Nematocera
(the so called D7 protein family), and lipocalins in ticks
and triatomines bugs, where they can constitute a high
proportion of the ESTs in sialotranscriptomes [6]. No
transcripts coding for these protein families were found
in the Glossina salivary gland cDNA library.
Ubiquitous annotated protein families, function unknown
or unclear

Antigen 5 (AG5) family AG5-related proteins belong to
an ubiquitous group of secreted proteins within the
CAP family (cysteine-rich secretory proteins; AG5 proteins of insects; pathogenesis-related protein 1 of plants)
[88]. Most of these animal proteins have no known
function; in the few instances to the contrary, their
function diverges from proteolytic activity in Conus [89],
to smooth muscle-relaxing activity in snake venoms
[90,91], to salivary neurotoxin in the venomous lizard
Heloderma horridum [92]. Members of the AG5 family
are found expressed in the salivary glands of all bloodfeeding insects studied so far [14,16,93]. In mosquito
salivary glands, several genes of this family are
expressed, some of which are salivary gland specific
[17,18]. One member of this gene family (gi|8927462)
was previously described in a transcriptome analysis of
G. m. morsitans salivary glands [27]. This gene appears
to be ubiquitously expressed, with 11 ESTs from the fat
body, 25 from the salivary glands and 16 from the midgut libraries. We presently describe three additional protein sequences of this family, all of which are exclusively
found in the salivary gland library, including two which
had 18 ESTs each, and no ESTs in any of the other two
libraries, a significant departure from expected equal
distribution among the three libraries. GM-486 appears
to be a differentially spliced form of the previously
described protein, while GM-1862 and GM-485 are 80%
and 93% identical to gi|8927462, respectively. Recently,
the immunogenicity of members of this family in Glossina has been reported [94]. In the stable fly Stomoxys
calcitrans a member of the AG5 family was shown to be
abundantly expressed and to specifically bind immunoglobulins [95], perhaps having an anticomplement activity. Exceptionally, a tabanid salivary protein of this
family incorporated an RGD domain [96-98] and
became a potent platelet aggregation inhibitor [99].
Yellow protein family Disruption of the yellow gene in
Drosophila produced a yellow phenotype indicating it
could mediate a melanization function. It was later
shown that it coded for a dopachrome isomerase, which
is important in the melanin formation pathway. Several
genes of the yellow family exist in Drosophila, but not
all display the isomerase activity [100]. Sand flies (but

Page 12 of 28

not mosquitoes) have abundant salivary expression of
this class of genes [14,38], but no dopachrome isomerase activity was found in the gland (Ribeiro, unpublished). It is possible that this protein exercises binding
of biogenic amines such as displayed by histamine/serotonin/norepinephrin binding proteins found in the salivary glands of ticks [101], mosquitoes [102] and
triatomine bugs [103,104]. Incidentally, the major royal
jelly protein of bees is related to the yellow family of
proteins. The sequences of GM-4104 and GM-2745
code for two diverse members of this protein family that
are expressed in the salivary glands, fat body and midgut
of G. m. morsitans. Both have the PFAM domain MRJP
that indicates this protein family (Additional file 2).
They are 61 and 57% identical to the yellow-c and yellow-f2 proteins of Drosophila, respectively. The ubiquitous tissue expression of these two proteins is suggestive
of a housekeeping role for this protein in Glossina.
Mucins Under this class we include diverse serine +
threonine rich secreted proteins that have in common a
large number (> ten) of potential O-N-acetylgalactosylation sites as identified by the NetOGlyc server [105] and
can thus be categorized as mucins. Such proteins have
been regularly found in sialotranscriptomes of insects
and ticks where they are postulated to help maintain the
insect mouthparts, in addition to other possible functions. Nine such proteins are described in additional file
2, including a member of the ubiquitous hemomucin
family [106,107], which was previously described in the
fat body transcriptome of G. m. morsitans [29]. GM2799 is a truncated protein sequence homologous to a
D. melanogaster protein that contains a signal sequence,
but the function remains unknown. GM-3365 has a signal sequence indicative of secretion, 23 putative glycosylation sites, and is also homologous to a D.
melanogaster protein of unknown function. GM-1194
and GM-2819 are also similar to D. melanogaster proteins of unknown function. They have 12 and 15 glycosylation sites, respectively. GM-5570 represents a partial
sequence for a mucin containing at least 40 glycosylation sites. The pair GM-1014 and GMN-14512 are
related, this last sequence being a truncated relative.
Each has 40 predicted glycosylation sites. Finally, GMN15884 codes for a secreted protein with 15 glycosylation
sites and no great similarities to any know protein. Most
of these mucins are not represented in the Sanger
assembly possibly due to their masking of low complexity regions.
Pathogen recognition proteins and defense response It
has become apparent from previous sialotranscriptomes
that the saliva from haematophagous arthropods contains antimicrobial compounds, such as lysozyme, defensins and cecropins, as well as many peptides of
unknown function that may be novel antimicrobial

Alves-Silva et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/213

compounds. Some of these previously identified proteins
are initiators of innate immune response cascades such
as the phenol oxidase cascade described above in the
serine protease section. It is probable that such compounds are secreted in saliva, where they either kill or
opsonize the pathogens thus preventing the ingested
blood from becoming a microbial haemoculture.
Remarkably, the sialotranscriptome of G. m. morsitans
analyzed in this work lacks some of the smaller peptides
found in other sialotranscriptome, yet it abounds in
other protein families associated with pathogen recognition, as shown below. This is probably due to the loss of
small transcripts during the library normalisation
process.
Lectins
Lectins are proteins with carbohydrate recognition
domains associated with innate immunity [76] and intracellular Golgi protein transport [108]. C-type lectins
found in snake venoms can display anti-platelet and
anti-clotting activities [109,110]. The sialotranscriptome
of G. m. morsitans had many clusters of ESTs producing
matches to lectins, including several lectins previously
described from the analysis of the Glossina fat body
library. Specific to the salivary gland transcriptome,
however, 49 ESTs assembled into 11 contigs; two of
which are significantly up regulated in the salivary
glands and contain either 18 or 13 transcripts (and zero
transcripts in the other two libraries). The protein
sequence of one of these transcripts is represented by
GM-591, possibly coding for a galactose-specific C-type
lectin, and similar to salivary proteins found in Ae.
aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Contig 491, with 13 ESTs,
may represent a chimeric assembly. A protein sequence
was not deduced for this contig, but can be inspected in
additional file 1. The sequence GM-595 codes for a
short lectin that is not closely related to other family
members. The functions of these putative salivary specific proteins remain unresolved.
Peptidoglycan recognition protein Previous analysis of
the Glossina fat body transcriptome uncovered the
sequence of a pathogen recognition protein implicated
in the initiation of innate defense mechanisms [29].
Three ESTs for this protein are represented in the salivary gland library. Additional file 2 describes a second
member of this family, with 4 salivary ESTs and one
each in the other 2 libraries. GM-4559 is closely related
to a Drosophila protein and contains a KOG LysM
domain indicative of peptidoglycan recognition.
Fibrinogen-domain-containing/Ficolin proteins This
group of proteins has the PFAM fibrinogen C motif and
the KOG Ficolin motif seen in invertebrate proteins displaying lectin activity toward N-acetylglucosamine residues and implicated in immune function [111-113]. The
PFAM motif is promiscuous, appearing in many other

Page 13 of 28

proteins such as vertebrate fibrinogens, angiopoietins
and ficolins. Salivary glands of Aedes mosquitoes abundantly express this family of proteins, two of which were
selectively expressed in the salivary glands of Ae. aegypti
[20] and Ae. albopictus [17]. The sialotranscriptome of
Glossina revealed abundant transcription of this gene
family, producing 197 ESTs in nine clusters, with only
16 other ESTs deriving from the midgut but none from
the fat body library. Notably, two clusters had 93 and 83
transcripts and were significantly more expressed in the
salivary glands than other organs (additional file 1).
Additional file 2 provides sequence information for six
members of this family, four of which are full length,
including the two abundant salivary transcripts. Closer
inspection of this family of proteins indicates they
belong to the ficolin subfamily as indicated by their
KOG match. Notice that while the fibrinogen C motif is
to only a portion of the sequence, the ficolin match is
to the whole extent of these proteins that are usually
350 aa in length. Ficolins are lectins playing a role in
innate immunity in both vertebrates and invertebrates
[111,112]. These six protein sequences appear to derive
from at least three different genes. GM-312, GM-313,
GM-314 and GM-315 are related and could originate
from alleles or from closely related genes. The remaining two proteins are more than 10% different from each
other and may derive from two additional genes. These
proteins may have been co-opted to play a role in neutralizing host hemostasis or inflammation instead of performing an immune function.
Thioester containing protein Previous analysis of the
fat body transcriptome of G. m. morsitans uncovered a
protein containing similarity to alpha-2 macroglobulin,
which has a reactive cysteine that can form a thioester
bond to other, usually pathogen, molecules [114], in a
manner similar to the vertebrate complement system.
These thioester proteins (TEP) are known to be important in mosquito and Drosophila immunity [115,116]. In
addition to fat body expression, six transcripts coding
for this protein were also found in the salivary gland
library.
Defense response associated proteins Although of
unclear function or mode of action, three protein
sequences are presented in additional file 2 and are
similar to Drosophila proteins associated with defense
response. GM-431 and GM-434, probably allelic, code
for secreted proteins of 22 kDa. The Drosophila homolog named vir-1-PC is virus induced. Similarly, GM-936
is similar to a Cys rich protein from Drosophila, which
is annotated at Flybase as participating in the defense
response.
Secreted polypeptides of conserved proteins of nondescribed families Four full length and four carboxy
truncated polypeptides have significant matches to

Alves-Silva et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/213

Drosophila or other insect proteins of unknown function. All have a signal peptide indicative of secretion.
GMN-2518 matches the Drosophila lethal gene product
which is described in FlyBase as having unknown function. It has a PROSITE match to the Lipoyl pattern
(2-oxo acid dehydrogenases acyltransferase component
lipoyl binding site - [GDN]-x(2)- [LIVF]-x(3)-{VH}-{M}[LIVMFCA]-x(2)[LIVMFA]-{LDFY}-{KPE}-x-K[GSTAIVW]- [STAIVQDN]-x(2)- [LIVMFS]-x(5)[GCN]-x- [LIVMFY].) and may have a housekeeping
function. No other insights were obtained for the
remaining seven conserved polypeptides.
Possibly multi genic Glossina-specific salivary
secreted polypeptides Previous sialotranscriptomes of
mosquitoes, triatomine bugs, sand flies and ticks consistently revealed genus-specific proteins (e.g. proteins that
produce no similarity matches to known proteins) that
are, in many cases, represented by multi-gene families.
These novel families might have been derived from
known genes that were altered by rapid evolution, perhaps as a consequence of immune pressure exerted by
the vertebrate host. They may also represent unique natural experiments on exon shuffling resulting from the
organism’s genome scramble to obtain more blood from
their hosts.
GE rich salivary proteins Twenty six ESTs found
exclusively in the salivary gland library assembled into
five different contigs from which five protein sequences
were derived, four of which are full length having a signal peptide indicative of secretion. One of these five
proteins, GM-3689, is 100% identical to G. m. morsitans
proline rich protein (gi|126143293), while the remaining
proteins are 85-96% identical to G. m. morsitans glycine/glutamate-rich proteins (gi|126143291) [28].
Whereas GM-2815 and GMN-14464 may be alleles, the
remaining proteins probably originate from different
genes. These proteins are weakly similar to the 30 kDa
family of proteins found to be exclusively expressed in
the salivary gland of adult female mosquitoes, [17,18,20],
but only because some of the Glossina proteins have
multiple dipeptide (Gly-Glu) repeats that are part of a
domain in the 30 kDa mosquito family. The mosquito
proteins have a predicted molecular mass varying from
18-29 kDa, while the Glossina proteins are only half as
large, ranging from 7.5-14.3 kDa. These proteins may
have stemmed from a common ancestor and subsequently evolved to maintain only their scrambled GlyGlu repeats, or they may be the product of convergent
evolution. The role of any of these protein members in
Glossina remains to be elucidated; in mosquitoes, the 30
kDa family has been characterized as inhibitors of collagen-induced platelet aggregation [117,118].
Glycine-Proline rich family Nineteen ESTs derived
from the salivary gland library plus three ESTs derived

Page 14 of 28

from the other two libraries assembled into three contigs coding for one protein containing a signal peptide
and two other related protein fragments. The best similarity matches for this protein group are to hypothetical
protozoan and plant proteins from Paramecium, Trichomonas and Oriza, deduced primarily by the regularly
spaced residues, Pro, Asn and Tyr, which are also found
in some transcription factors. This protein family is not
available in GeneDB due to their masking of low complexity transcripts.
Fat body and salivary 20 kDa family Twenty two
ESTs derived from the fat body library plus 11 from the
salivary gland library assembled to produce five related
proteins that have no significant similarity matches to
other known proteins. While GM-2258 and GM-2259
may be alleles, the other three proteins are more distantly related, indicating that at least four genes exist for
this novel protein family. Members of this Glossina
family all have a signal peptide, a mature molecular
mass that varies from 18.9-20.2 kDa and a slightly acidic
pI varying from 5.6-6.0. They are named FB-SG-20 Kda
family. Because unique salivary protein families specific
to disrupting host hemostasis or inflammation tend to
be specifically expressed in the salivary glands, the discovery of this unique family expressed in the fat body
suggests an antimicrobial function (although it may simply play a housekeeping role).
Salivary acidic 8 kDa peptide family Additional file 2
contains the sequence information for three acidic (pI
3.8-3.9) polypeptides of predicted mature mass of 8.28.9 kDa that are likely to be the product of several gene
duplication events. GM-1774 and GM-1775 appear to
be splice variants, and GM-1937 a more distant relative.
No significant matches are found for any member of the
family when they are compared to the NR database.
These three polypeptides are represented by a total of
18 ESTs found exclusively in the salivary gland library,
with GM-1774 having statistically significant score, suggesting a specific function in this tissue. Notably, they
have a carboxy terminus rich in Asn and Gln.
Basic 6.5 kDa family Two distantly related basic peptides are coded by GMN-129 and GMN-4307. A total of
nine ESTs from the salivary (five) and midgut (four)
libraries were used to assemble these two peptides. They
have an unusual conserved Phe rich character determined by the pattern block F-x(5)-S-F-x(2)-F-x(11,12)L-S-x(4)-F-F-F- [FI]-I- [FY].
Basic 6 kDa family GMN-16121 and GMN-6827 code
for two related peptides that share a relatively conserved
signal peptide, and a predicted Phe-Tyr rich mature
polypeptide. They have no significant sequence similarities in available databases.
5.8 kDa histidine rich peptide family Two histidinerich related secreted peptides with a mature molecular

Alves-Silva et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/213

mass of 5.8-5.9 kDa correspond to two ESTs from the
salivary gland library. GMN-14221 has Thr- His- repeats
that produce matches to much larger hypothetical proteins found in the NR database, and may be related to
transposons. The repeated histidine pattern may indicate
metal binding domains that are common in Zn binding
peptides that have antimicrobial activity [119,120]. Histidine repeat peptides have been commonly found in sialotranscriptomes. Whether they derive from a common
ancestral gene that mutated fast is not known.
Basic 4 kDa family Another two related secreted peptides, sharing a basic pI and predicted mass near four
kDa, were deduced from three ESTs found in the salivary gland library.
Basic 3 kDa family Two distantly related basic peptides
are coded by GMN-122 and GMN-7766. A total of five
ESTs from the salivary and midgut libraries were used
to assemble these two peptides. They have a conserve
Leu-Asn-Asn-Asn tail.
Other glutamate rich proteins Four proteins rich in
glutamate, two of them possibly the result of alternative
splicing, have repeated glutamates and for this reason
gives relatively high scores to other repeat rich proteins.
Other possibly salivary secreted polypeptides Additional file 2 lists an additional 129 potentially secreted
polypeptides with no significant matches to other
known proteins, or matches to proteins of unknown
function. It is possible that some (or many) of these
hypothetical peptides are derived from truncated coding
sequences and are thus only the 3’ remnants that may
contain a spurious signal peptide after a Met codon is
found, as is the case in many transporters. Because we
want to avoid excluding possible novel peptides in our
analysis, we included them here despite the risk that we
may incorporate erroneously predicted secreted peptides
into our analyses. A few of the peptides in this category
appear to be salivary gland specific, as they contain six
or more ESTs found only in the salivary gland library.
These include GM-2233, which actually has a match to
a Drosophila protein, but this is predominantly due to
the conserved Cys framework that matches the PROSITE EGF_2 pattern (C-x-C-x(2)- [GP]- [FYW]-x(4,8)C.). Twelve transcripts coding for this protein were
found solely in the salivary gland library. Seven ESTs,
also exclusive of the salivary glands, code for GMN3996, a small (53 aa) secreted polypeptide with a mature
molecular mass of three kDa. Seven transcripts also
assembled to provide for the protein sequence of GM4306, which codes for a mature peptide of 7.8 kDa with
a very basic pI (11.6). Two other unique peptides are
coded by the sequences GM-1770 and GMN-2557, both
with six ESTs exclusive of the salivary glands. GM-1770
has a lysine rich basic tail that is similarly found in an
expanded protein family found in the salivary gland of

Page 15 of 28

ticks [45,121] and culicine mosquitoes [17,20]. These
polyK tails may lead the peptide to interact with charged
phospholipids such as those important for assembly of
clotting cascades [122]. Indeed, one tick salivary anticlotting protein named Salp14 is a member of the basic
tail family [123].
Housekeeping (H) genes

The 5,089 clusters (comprising 14,392 ESTs) recognized
as H genes were further characterized into 24 subgroups
according to function (Table 2). While previously
reported sialotranscriptomes, which use non-normalized
libraries, showed transcripts coding for protein synthesis
machinery and energy metabolism as the most abundant, the top three classes of transcripts in the G. m.
morsitans sialotranscriptome were for conserved proteins of unknown function, signal transduction and
cytoskeletal proteins. Proteins associated with energy
metabolism and protein synthesis followed these three
groups. This difference from previous transcriptomes
certainly relies on the library normalization protocol
used here but not in previous work, allowing an unprecedented coverage of lower abundance transcripts. The
complete list of all 5,089 gene clusters, along with
further information about each, is given in additional
file 1, and many of the annotated CDS are found in
additional file 2. Below we highlight some transcripts
from the H group that might be relevant to specific salivary gland function:
Nuclear regulation (mitosis, DNA repair and other nuclear
maintenance)

Two hundred and fifty three clusters contain one or
more EST expressed in the SG library under this class,
68 of these are shown in additional file 2 as CDS, mostly
full length. This includes a histone tail methylase, as
predicted by the KOG database, which has 20 ESTs
from the SG library and only one from the FB library.
This is a highly significant difference, indicating that
this enzyme may be important in chromatin organization associated with tissue specific expression in tsetse
SG [124].
Transcription factors and transcription machinery

Two hundred and thirty five clusters coding for putative
transcription factors (TF) were found in the salivary
gland transcriptome of G. m. morsitans, one of which is
significantly up regulated in the SG library, GM-1732,
and assembled from 13 ESTs originating exclusively
from the SG library. GM-1732 codes for a homolog of
the Drosophila product named salivary gland-expressed
bHLH gene, also known a sage, which is a salivary gland
specific transcript of the product which interacts with
Forkhead (Fkh) TF to block salivary gland apoptosis in
Drosophila. Abrams et al, 2006 indicated that some of
the salivary expressed genes of the Fkh family encode

Alves-Silva et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/213

subunits of resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
enzymes, which hydroxylate prolines in collagen and
other related proteins. The loss of these Fkh genes leads
to a reduced secretory content in Drosophila SG [125].
Interestingly, one member of the Forkhead family,
coded by GM-2687, is also found expressed in the salivary glands of Glossina. Among the salivary expressed
TF, we also highlight XBP-1, coded by GM-754 involved
in chaperone expression in the ER [126], and the GATA
transcription factor [127]; additionally, three transcripts
found exclusively in the SG transcriptome code for the
homologs of Drosophila pasilla isoform I and K. The
pasilla gene has been identified as expressed and
required in Drosophila salivary gland and are similar to
the human Nova-1 and Nova-2, which are nuclear
RNA-binding proteins and directly regulate mRNA splicing. In particular, the human homologs are required
for correct splicing of the inhibitory GABA(A) receptor
gamma 2 subunit, as well as a glycine receptor subunit
[128]. Pasilla Drosophila mutants have abnormal salivary glands and have defects in apical secretion [129].
Additional file 2 presents 43 full length and one truncated protein sequences that are putative transcription
factors. Transcripts coding for enzymes involved in
RNA interference (RNAi) were also found, such as
Argonaute and the Drosophila homolog of Aubergine,
which is another PIWI-motif-containing protein and
part of the RNAi Dicer machinery. Additional file 2 presents the sequence of 95 proteins, mostly full length,
that are putatively associated with the transcription
machinery.
Signal transduction

Several transcripts were found coding for a diversity of
G coupled protein receptors similar to those described
previously for binding N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
and glutamate, biogenic amines, including serotonin
(5-HT) and peptides, as well as the pre-synaptic latrophilin-like receptor. These receptors may be associated
with regulating salivary gland secretion. Receptor subunits for NMDA/glutamate were also found before in An.
gambiae salivary transcriptomes [18], but they were
never studied, to our knowledge, in the context of saliva
output regulation in insects, although NMDA affects ink
gland synthesis and release from cuttlefish [130]. Peptide
neurohormone innervation has been identified previously in the salivary glands of cockroaches [131] and
grasshoppers [132], and it may also regulate salivation in
tsetse. Serotonin is known to innervate and regulate salivary secretion in diverse insects such as the cockroach
[133] and anopheline mosquitoes [134], or to stimulate
salivation in calliphorid flies where they were shown
over 20 years ago by Michael Berridge to stimulate the
inositol phosphate pathway, found later to be widespread in animals [135,136]. The inositol phosphate

Page 16 of 28

pathway may be important also in tsetse, indicated by
the finding of transcripts associated with several specific
inositol kinases and phosphatases. Transcripts coding
for nitric oxide synthase (discussed above) and intracellular guanylate cyclase indicate an active NOS signaling
pathway in the salivary glands. Additional file 2
describes 194 protein sequences putatively associated
with signal transduction pathways, some of which are
involved in protein export or immune signaling. Several
agonist hormone receptors are also included, mostly as
protein fragments.
Transporters and channels

Transcripts coding for various vacuolar ATPase
(V-ATPases) subunits are shown in additional file 1.
V-ATPases are ubiquitous in eukaryotes where they
drive electromotive power across cellular membranes
that can be used to pump various ions and water depending on the ion selective channels in the particular membrane [137]. They were shown to be activated by 5-HT in
Calliphora salivary glands [138,139], thereby inducing a
K + rich salivary secretion. Many transcripts were also
found coding for various water channels of the aquaporin
family and the alpha-1 subunit of the Ca++ channel, the
voltage gated Ca++ channel, the rectifier potassium channel, the tandem pore K+ channel, Cl- and ligand gated
ion channels. Transcripts were also found coding for cell
membrane Na + + K + ATPase subunits and the Ca ++
dependent ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Sixty
four mostly full length protein sequences in this category
are included in additional file 2.
Cytoskeletal proteins

A somewhat odd result arising from the differential
abundance of transcripts among the 3 different libraries
is the finding of significantly increased transcription of
cytoskeletal proteins of the myosin and actin family in
the SG library, with seven clusters of these types of transcripts being significantly up regulated in the SG (additional file 1, worksheet Sg-Upregulated). This may
indicate the importance of secretory vesicle transport
machinery, or the existence of a subset of these genes
specifically associated with SG function.
Transposable elements (TE)

Transposable element-derived transcripts have been regularly found in salivary transcriptomes of insects and
ticks [17,18,45,140], where they may indicate either
active transposition, or more probably, suppression of
element transposition in the organism’s genome. Both
Class I and Class II transposable element products are
expressed, including type I polyproteins and reverse
transcriptases, and type II transposases similar to piggyBac and Mariner. Many of these transcripts show stop
codons and frame shifts, indicating they may function as
negative regulators of transposition. However, a

Alves-Silva et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/213

truncated transcript coding for 307 amino acids of a
piggyBac transposase indicates recent insertion in the G.
m. morsitans genome. Additional file 2 includes 11 TE
associated protein sequences.
Viral sequences (M)

Salivary glands of G. m. morsitans and G. pallidipes are
known to contain viruses [141-143]. Twenty nine ESTs
grouped in 12 clusters, found exclusively in the salivary
gland library, match viral proteins encoded by at least
two different viruses, one of which had its genome
recently sequenced [34,36]. Eleven of the clusters match
this viral genome, but the most abundant cluster with
17 transcripts, codes for a capsid protein of a picorna
like virus similar to deformed wing viruses of insects.
This transcript has no homology to the recently
described envelop protein of the Glossina pallidipes salivary gland hypertrophy virus [144]. The abundant
expression of this capsid protein in the salivary glands
(and not in fat body or midgut) of Glossina suggests
that this virus may actually be transmitted from fly to
fly via the salivary glands, and accordingly must involve
the vertebrate host in this life cycle. If this is the case,
either the vertebrate host may amplify this virus, or perhaps infection occurs by co-feeding flies in the absence
of a vertebrate host viremia. On the other hand, the
artificial co-feeding of large number of flies on a single
pool of blood may have created conditions for spread of
this virus in the colonized fly, as can occur with co-feeding ticks on a non-parasitemic host [145,146].
How divergent are salivary proteins?

It is apparent from the deducted CDS (additional file 2)
that the putative salivary gland proteins are often most
distantly related to other known proteins, when compared by BLASTp to the GenBank NR database, confirming previous suggestions that the salivary proteins of
blood sucking arthropods are rapidly evolving [9]. For
further comparisons we utilized the blast score ratio
approach [147] to compare the Glossina proteins to
those of other Diptera. A subset of the functionally
annotated CDS found expressed in the salivary glands
was blasted using BLASTp against the proteomes of
Drosophila melanogaster and the mosquitoes Anopheles
gambiae, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus
(This subset and analysis can be verified in worksheet
named 2Analyze-2 of Additional file 2, Table S2). Each
best matching score was divided by the score obtained
when the Glossina proteins was blasted against itself, to
obtain the normalized blast score (NBS), which accordingly can vary from 0 to 1. This set excluded Glossina
proteins that were related at equal or higher than 85%
similarity, to exclude bias of the SG group that contains
many alleles or closely related gene products. Results

Page 17 of 28

indicate that Drosophila proteins have overall the highest normalized scores when compared with tsetse proteins (as expected from the phylogeny) and that salivary
proteins have the lowest NBS of the whole group,
except for the exogenous transposable elements group
(Figure 6). When the NBS of the SG set is compared
with the combined non SG set shown in Figure 6, their
values are highly significantly different from each other
(P < 0.0001) for each of the four species (KruskallWallis Anova). This result supports the idea that salivary
gland genes of unrelated haematophagous arthropods
were acquired in a scenario of convergent evolution,
and the differences between proteins possibly magnified
by fast evolution due to the host immune pressure on
the protein products [9].
Preliminary characterization of the salivary proteome of
Glossina morsitans morsitans

To obtain information on protein expression in the salivary glands of G. m. morsitans, we performed a two
dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis separation of the
salivary gland homogenate followed by proteolytic digest
of the cored blue stained bands (Figure 7) and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on the tryptic peptides. Additional file 1 and S2 shows the
matching sequence hits obtained by MS/MS. In many
cases, due to the similarities between protein members
of the same family, it was not possible to assign a
unique hit to a particular protein, however, it did indicate the presence of a particular protein family in a gel
spot. A detailed description of the findings is given
below:
Endonuclease/Tsal family

Inspection of the gel (Figure 7A) shows a concentration
of major protein spots indicative of cationic to neutral
products situated between of 40-50 kDa. Nine such
spots were identified as diverse members of the endonuclease/Tsal family (Labeled Tsal in Figure 7B). In agreement with the location in the gel, the Tsal1 family has
predicted mature masses ranging from 42-43 kDa and
acidic isoelectric points varying from 4.8-6.6. Nine distinct spots for this protein are not suprising as we previously proposed that a minimum of eight genes likely
encoded this protein family in G. m. morsitans. However, it is highly probable that some of the bands also
represent post-translational modifications. The abundance of this protein family suggests a main function for
this family may reside not in an enzymatic capacity, but
rather in sequestration of inflammatory or hemostasis
agonists, including immunoglobulin binding. Indeed, the
most abundant secreted proteins found in mosquitoes,
ticks and triatomine bugs are involved in binding and
sequestration of biogenic amines such as histamine,

serotonin norepinephrine or adenosine nucleotides
[102,148-150]. The high protein concentrations are
needed because these proteins can bind one or two agonist molecules at most, and they need to produce at
least one μM protein concentration at the site of the
bite to neutralize these agonists (see discussion of this
subject in [102]).
Adenosine deaminase family

Eight gel spots with molecular weigh retention near
the 51 kDa marker had mass spectral hits with

members of the ADA family of enzymes, which
have predicted mature molecular masses between
40-54 kDa, and isoelectric points varying from
highly acidic (<4.0 - 5.5) to an extremely basic
(>9.0) group. These are marked ADA in Figure 7B.
Over 55% sequence coverage by MS/MS was
achieved for gi|5817644 and 63% coverage for GM1228. These eight gel spots are in agreement with
the proposed minimum of seven genes coding for
ADA enzymes expressed in the salivary glands of
G. m. morsitans.

5’ nucleotidase family

Four gel spots produced matches to gi|14488055 and its
allele GM-784, most abundantly at the basic end of the
gel, running as several spots at ~64 kDa and one much
higher spot at ~150 kDa. These spots are marked 5’-nuc
in Figure 7B. The protein sequences with MS hits have
predicted mature masses of 59.4 kDa in accordance with
the location on the gel, and pI of 7. The latter is not in

accordance with the protein location on the gel, thus
suggesting either a different gene, or an eroneous pI
prediction due to non-standard ionization of charged
amino acids, or post translational modifications that
would create a more basic protein. The higher molecular form may represent an insoluble dimer, as this has
previously been reported for the apyrase of Triatoma
infestans [151]. The relatively high expression of this

Alves-Silva et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:213
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/213

enzyme in Glossina salivary glands is paralleled by similarly high expression of apyrase members of the
5’nucleotidase in mosquito sialoproteomes [17,152-154],
and accounts for the highest apyrase specific activities
found in any other secretory organ thus far measured
[155]. It remains to be determined, however, whether
Glossina apyrase activity arises from a 5’ nucleotidase
family member.
Antigen 5 family

The intense basic spot, observed at 28 kDa, and gradually stretches across the entire gel, had peptide sequence
match to members of the antigen-5 family, which have
predicted mature molecular weight of 27.1-22.8 (labeled
as AG5 on Figure 7B). All four members of this family
described in additional file 2 have basic pI’s of 8.2-8.6,
which matches the location and intensity of the major
spot, but does not match the remaining acidic trail.
These bands could again be the produce of either different genes or from post-translation modifications (eg,
phosphate additions). Indeed, multiple phosphorylation
sites for protein kinase C, casein and tyrosine kinases
exist in all related proteins annotated in additional file
2. However, it could also be simply a result of protein
overloading, which would cause a comet effect as the
ISO gel reached the point of saturation.
GE family

An intense band is also observed at an acidic region of
the gel running at ~14 kDa. This band and a nearby,
less intense band of smaller molecular mass, correspond
to the Gly-Glu rich proteins uniquely found in Glossina,
annotated as GM-2815 (GE-1 on Figure 7B) and GM3689 (GE-2 on Figure 7B) in additional file 2.
C type lectin

A distinct acidic gel spot, running at ~18 kDa, was identified as a C-type lectin named GM-591 (three MS fragment hits) and GM-595 (two MS fragment hits) in
additional file 2. The spot is labeled as C-lectin in Figure
7B. This spot is probably represented by sequence GM591, which has a predicted pI of 4.9 and mass of 17.7
kDa, as opposed to GM-595 that has a predicted pI of
6.9 and mass of 12.5 kDa.
Housekeeping products

The putative housekeeping gene products for a heat
shock protein cognate (HSPC), the chaperone crystallin,
a thioredoxin peroxidase (ThRedox), the alpha and beta
subunits of the F0F1 ATPase, arginine kinase (ArgK),
two actin spots, tropomyosin (TrMy), calponin (Calp),
prohibitin (Prohib), and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase
(TrePs) were also unequivocally identified and labeled
accordingly in Figure 7B.

Toward the characterization of the sialoimmunome of
Glossina morsitans morsitans

Aiming to identify immunogenic secreted saliva proteins
in our tsetse salivary gland EST database, we targeted 20
proteins, including both predicted secreted and housekeeping (control) proteins (Table 4) for recombinant
expression. We then used a rabbit anti-Glossina morsitans morsitans-saliva antiserum to immunodetect these
recombinant proteins using standard Western blotting
(WB) techniques. This protein expression set included a
truncated variant of the previously characterized tsetse
TAg-5 protein [27,156], also expressed as a His-tagged
peptide (His6-TAg5) to be used as positive control.
His6-TAg5 was strongly recognized by the anti-saliva
antiserum (data not shown) and was used as positive
control in all subsequent WB experiments. All 19
recombinant proteins produced the projected molecular
weights (MW) when resolved with SDS-PAGE stained
with SeeBlue (data not shown). Out of the 20 peptides
expressed, only four were recognized by the anti-saliva
antiserum (Figure 8): His¬6-GMsg-15f12 (lane 3), His6GMsg-45 g06 (lane 4), and His6-GMsg-06 h03 (lane 2),
and the control, His6-TAg5 (lane 1). However, when
compared to the His6-TAg5 control, the other protein
bands were considerably weaker (data not shown).
These weaker immunoblot signals for the other three
proteins could simply be due to a lower protein-specific
antibody titre in the polyclonal antiserum, thus reflecting either the natural abundance of those proteins in
the saliva or the reduced protein immunogenicity of
these proteins when compared to Tag5 (in lieu of
accepting ineffective protein expression). Alternatively, it
was plausible that Glossina TAg5 could act as an immunoglobulin binder as recently described for the homologous salivary protein from Stomoxys calcitrans [95],
which would inadvertently amplify the signal and bias
results. Control experiments were done to assess
whether Glossina TAg5 could bind non-immune serum
or secondary antibody alone; the negative cross-reaction
with control antibodies confirmed that tsetse TAg5 does
not share this Ig-binding characteristic with the stable
fly homologue (results not shown). The three additional
polypeptides recognized by the anti-saliva antiserum
were two enzymes (a phopholipase A2 and a serine protease) and a mucin. This infers that these proteins (or
closely related family members) may be secreted in saliva, and may be epidemiological markers of tsetse exposure as observed with ticks [157-161], mosquitoes
[162-165] and sand flies [166-169].

Conclusions
The sialotranscriptome of tsetse reported here is made
unique among other haematophagous arthropods analyzed thus far by the sheer number of ESTs collated

distinct organisms not sharing a common

haematophagous saliva contains many proteins deriving
from multigenic families.
The G. m. morsitans salivary repertoire follows this
pattern, as detailed in additional file 2. The Glossina sialome reveals alleles of previously described gene products, that previously known salivary proteins are
multigenic, identifies at least 7 new multigenic polypeptide families unique to Glossina, and additionally lists
over one hundred possible secreted peptides. Most of
these proteins have no known function and provide a
discovery platform for identification of novel pharmacologically active compounds, novel vector-based vaccine
targets, and immunological markers of vector exposure.

obtained from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI). Trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). HPLC-grade acetonitrile was from EM Science (Darmstadt, Germany)
and water was purified by a Barnstead Nanopure system
(Dubuque, IA).
Biological material

The G. m. morsitans colony maintained in the insectary
at Yale University was originally established in Bristol
from puparia from fly populations in Zimbabwe. Flies
are maintained at 24 ± 1°C with 50-55% relative humidity, and receive defibrinated bovine blood every 48 h
using an artificial membrane system [171].
Normalized EST library construction and sequencing

For library preparation approximately 800 pairs of salivary glands were microscopically dissected from male
and female adult flies that were two weeks old, 48 hours
post their last blood meal. A quantity of more than two
μg of total RNA was extracted using TRIzol®Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. mRNA was selected using the PolyATtract® mRNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA). For library construction, first strand cDNA
synthesis was primed with a NotI-tag-oligo-(dT)18. The
tag is a sequence of ten nucleotides that is unique for
this library and thus serves as an identifier. The resulting DNA/RNA hybrid was treated with RNase H and
then used as a template for DNA Poll-catalysed secondstrand synthesis. After the addition of EcoRI adaptors,
the double-stranded cDNAs were digested with NotI
and size-selected. The resulting molecules were directionally cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the phagemid vector, pT7T3PAC. The library then went
through one round of normalization performed

Page 22 of 28

according to ‘method 4’ [172,173]. This procedure is
based on the hybridization of PCR-amplified cDNA
inserts of a library with the library itself in the form of
single-stranded circles. Following hybridization to a relatively low Cot of 5-10, the remaining single-stranded
circles (normalized library) are purified over hydroxyapatite (HAP), converted to double-stranded circles by
primer extension and electroporated into bacteria [172].
Each clone was sequenced using a T3 or T7 primer
using ABITM big dye terminator kits.
Bioinformatic tools and procedures used

Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were trimmed of primer
and vector sequences, clustered, and compared with other
databases as described [153]. The BLAST tool [174] and
the CAP3 assembler [175] were used to assemble the database, as well as to compare it to other databases and pipe
the results into a hyperlinked Excel spreadsheet, as
described in the dCAS software tool [31]. ClustalW [176]
and Treeview software [177] were used to align sequences
and visualise alignments. Phylogenetic analysis and statistical Neighbor Joining (NJ) bootstrap tests of the phylogenies were done with the Mega package [178]. For
functional annotation of the transcripts we used the tool
BlastX [179] to compare the nucleotide sequences to the
NR protein database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and to the Gene Ontology
(GO) database[180]. The tool RPSBlast [179] was used to
search for conserved protein domains in the Pfam [181],
SMART [182], Kog [183] and Conserved Domains Databases (CDD) [184]. We have also compared the transcripts
with other subsets of mitochondrial and rRNA nucleotide
sequences downloaded from NCBI, and to several organism proteomes downloaded from NCBI (yeast), Flybase
(Drosophila melanogaster), or ENSEMBL (An. gambiae).
Segments of the three-frame translations of the EST
(because the libraries were unidirectional we did not use
six-frame translations), starting with a methionine found
in the first 100 predicted AA, or to the predicted protein
translation in the case of complete coding sequences, were
submitted to the SignalP server [185] to help identify
translation products that could be secreted. O-glycosylation sites on the proteins were predicted with the program
NetOGlyc [105]. Functional annotation of the transcripts
was based on all the comparisons above. Mass spectrometry results were mapped to the excel spreadsheets using a
home made program. The following example illustrates
the convention for interpreting the data: The hit MS-31-3
-> TPTAELR 111| represents the result of the third peptide (MS-31-3) identified in the tryptic digest from spot
number 31 (MS-31-3), which produced the sequence
TPTAELR that start at position 111 of the protein to
which it is a hit, and is on the first cell of the particular
spreadsheet row.

Comparisons of deducted coding sequences with the
proteome of D. melanogaster, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles
gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus (Downloaded from
Flybase or VectorBase) where done by the normalized
score obtained from Blastp comparisons. The reference
score was created by obtaining the score of the Glossina
protein sequence blasted against itself, as proposed for
the Blast Score Ratio approach [147].
When attempting identification of multi gene families,
we attributed transcripts coding for proteins that were
more than 10% different in their primary amino acid
sequence to derive from different genes.

from GeneDB and GenBank (Table 4), which had a signal peptide indicative of secretion [185]. DNA minipreps
corresponding to their sequences were used as template
to amplify the coding sequence (excluding signal peptide
sequences) from each putative protein. A list of specific
primers sequences used can be provided upon request.
His-tagged proteins were expressed as His-6-peptides
from a pET28a vector (kindly provided by Prof. Peter A.
Williams from University of Wales, Bangor) in BL21
(DE3)pLysS strain, and purified using HisBind Quick
300 Cartridges (Novagen, Cambridge, UK) following the
manufactures’ instructions.

2D Gel Electrophoresis, tryptic digestion-MS/MS
experiment

Western Blot analysis using rabbit anti-Glossina morsitans
saliva polyclonal antiserum

2D gel electrophoresis was performed using the ZOOM
IPGRunner System (Invitrogen) under manufacturer’s
recommended running conditions. Briefly, approximately 130 μg of sample proteins were solubilized with
155 μl rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2%
CHAPS, 20 mM DTT, 0.5% carrier ampholytes, pH
3-10). The samples were absorbed by rehydration
ZOOM strips (7 cm; pH 3-10 NL) overnight at room
temperature and then focused under manufacturer’s
recommended conditions. The focused IPG strips were
reduced/alkylated/equilibrated with reducing and then
alkylation reagents dissolved in the sample buffer. The
strips were then applied onto NuPAGE 4-12% Bis Tris
ZOOM gels (Invitrogen). The gels were run under
MOPS buffer and stained with SeeBlue staining solution
(Bio Rad). A total of 60 spots were selected for tryptic
digestion, based on their staining intensity. Protein identification of 2D gel separated proteins was performed on
reduced and alkylated trypsin digested samples prepared
by standard mass spectrometry protocols. Tryptic
digests were analyzed by coupling the Nanomate
(Advion BioSciences)–an automated chip based nano
electrospray interface source–to a quadrupole time of
flight mass spectrometer, QStarXL MS/MS System
(Applied Biosystems/Sciex). Computer controlled data
dependent automated switching to MS/MS provided
peptide sequence information. AnalystQS software
(Applied Biosystems/Sciex) was used for data acquisition. Data processing and databank searching were performed with Mascot software (Matrix Science). The NR
protein database from the NCBI, National Library of
Medicine, NIH, was used for the search analysis, as was
a protein database generated during the course of this
work.

The polyclonal antiserum used was as reported before
[27]. Briefly, a total of 25 pairs of salivary glands were
dissected from 15-day-old male flies and collected in
ice-cold PBS. The outflow fluid (= tsetse saliva), containing approximately 100 μg saliva proteins, was emulsified
in Freund’s complete adjuvant and subcutaneously
injected in a New Zealand white rabbit. Two subsequent
boosters of the same antigen preparation in Freund’s
incomplete adjuvant were administered at 3-week intervals. The polyclonal anti-saliva serum was collected 2
weeks after the final booster. For the Western Blot
experiments, purified peptides were diluted 1:2 in 2×
loading buffer (4% SDS, 20% Glycerol, 0.2% Bromophenol Blue, 200 mM DTT, 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8) and
resolved using a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Peptides were
then transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited, Bucks, UK), at 90 V for 1
hour, blocked for 40 minutes in blocking solution (5%
fat-free milk in PBT) and probed overnight at 4°C with
the anti-tsetse saliva rabbit anti-serum [27] diluted
1:7,500. After incubation with primary antiserum, the
membranes were washed in PBT (3 × 10 minutes) and
probed at room temperature for one hour with a conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG- HRPO secondary antiserum
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, USA; dilution:
1:50,000). SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration
Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, USA) and
Kodak BioMax MR film were used for Western Blot
development.
