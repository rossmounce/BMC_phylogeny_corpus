Abstract
Background: Telomeric and subtelomeric regions are essential for genome stability and regular
chromosome replication. In this work, we have characterized the wheat BAC (bacterial artificial
chromosome) clones containing Spelt1 and Spelt52 sequences, which belong to the subtelomeric repeats
of the B/G genomes of wheats and Aegilops species from the section Sitopsis.
Results: The BAC library from Triticum aestivum cv. Renan was screened using Spelt1 and Spelt52 as
probes. Nine positive clones were isolated; of them, clone 2050O8 was localized mainly to the distal parts
of wheat chromosomes by in situ hybridization. The distribution of the other clones indicated the presence
of different types of repetitive sequences in BACs. Use of different approaches allowed us to prove that
seven of the nine isolated clones belonged to the subtelomeric chromosomal regions. Clone 2050O8 was
sequenced and its sequence of 119 737 bp was annotated. It is composed of 33% transposable elements
(TEs), 8.2% Spelt52 (namely, the subfamily Spelt52.2) and five non-TE-related genes. DNA transposons are
predominant, making up 24.6% of the entire BAC clone, whereas retroelements account for 8.4% of the
clone length. The full-length CACTA transposon Caspar covers 11 666 bp, encoding a transposase and
CTG-2 proteins, and this transposon accounts for 40% of the DNA transposons. The in situ hybridization
data for 2050O8 derived subclones in combination with the BLAST search against wheat mapped ESTs
(expressed sequence tags) suggest that clone 2050O8 is located in the terminal bin 4BL-10 (0.95-1.0).
Additionally, four of the predicted 2050O8 genes showed significant homology to four putative
orthologous rice genes in the distal part of rice chromosome 3S and confirm the synteny to wheat 4BL.
Conclusion: Satellite DNA sequences from the subtelomeric regions of diploid wheat progenitor can be
used for selecting the BAC clones from the corresponding regions of hexaploid wheat chromosomes. It
has been demonstrated for the first time that Spelt52 sequences were involved in the evolution of terminal
regions of common wheat chromosomes. Our research provides new insights into the microcollinearity
in the terminal regions of wheat chromosomes 4BL and rice chromosome 3S.

Background
Two regions are distinguished in the chromosomal end
structure: the telomeric region that caps the chromosome
tip and the adjacent subtelomeric region. Taken together,
the results of recent analyses of subtelomeric DNA and the
current views suggest that the subtelomeric region is
located in the distal chromosomal region between the telomeric and unique chromosome-specific DNA sequences
[1-3]. On the other hand, it should be taken into account
that not all species and not all chromosomes have unique
chromosome-specific DNA sequences in their distal
regions; this is especially true for the polyploid species.
There is a vast literature concerning the structure and function of telomeric DNA as a specialized end structure in a
wide range of eukaryotes. Briefly, this DNA consists of the
(TTAGGG)n-like sequences and is associated with specific
nucleosomal proteins, which provide the telomere protection function and regulation of telomere tract length
[4,5]. The first plant telomeric DNA was isolated and
cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana [6]. The Arabidopsis-type
telomere TTTAGGG is conserved and widely occurs
among plants; however, it has not been found in Alliaceae
as well as in many other Asparagales [7,8]. The isolation
and research of distinct repetitive DNA families located at
the chromosomal ends have been so far widely used in
analysis of subtelomeric plant DNA. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the subtelomeric regions of the
chromosomes in plant taxa are composed of various tandem repeat families, some of which are species- and/or
genome-specific [9-12]. In Secale cereale and Aegilops
speltoides, the species-specific subtelomeric families of tandem repeats constitute about 2% of the nuclear DNA
[13,14]. The measured lengths of various subtelomeric
tandem repeats, their variation patterns, and proximity to
telomeric repeats have been analyzed in detail in tomato,
barley, rye, and rice. In particular, it has been shown that
subtelomeric and telomeric repeats are co-localized on
DNA fragments longer than 300 kb in rice [10]. Based on
the distance between two FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) signals, the distance between subtelomeric and
telomeric repeats on some rice chromosomes was estimated as less than 100 kb [15]. The experiments with
stretched rye chromosome fibrils have clearly demonstrated that in certain case, the distance between a long telomeric repeat and the immediately adjacent copies of the
subtelomeric repeat pSc250 was less than 4 kb [16]. Variations in the distance between telomeric repeats and the
subtelomeric satellites following them have been also
observed in tomato [17,18]. It is of interest that the studies of subtelomeric regions in rye and Aegilops have
detected diverse combinations of tandemly arranged subtelomeric repeats with interspersed non-repetitive
sequences [[16], Salina et al. (unpublished data)]. It has
been shown that mutual arrangement of subtelomeric
repeats and the presence of interspersed unique or low

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/414

copy number sequences are chromosome-specific, providing Silene latifolia as an example [19]. Use of a degenerate
telomere primer and the Vectorette PCR approach has
made it possible to isolate and map the DNA sequences
adjacent to telomeric repeats. Cloning of telomere associated sequences in barley has demonstrated that in some
cases telomeric repeats are immediately adjacent to subtelomeric tandem repeats [20]. Large-scale sequencing of
the genomes of a number of organisms enabled to completely characterize the structural organization of the subtelomeric regions in almost all human chromosomes
[21,22] and certain rice [23] and Arabidopsis chromosomes [3]. The salient findings include multiple segmental duplications occurring in more than one subtelomeric
region, the presence of mobile elements, chromosomespecific tandem repeats, abundance of internal
(TTAGGG)n-like sequences, the presence of transcribed
regions, and the putative genes in subtelomeric regions.
The BAC libraries have been recently created and used
intensively for studying the genome of Triticum aestivum
[24]. This has offered unprecedented opportunities for
examining, in particular, the extensive subtelomeric DNA
regions of three homoeologous genomes (BB, AA, and
DD) to get the insights into their reshuffling during formation of the allopolyploid nucleus and evolution. Two
approaches can be used for selecting the subtelomeric
BAC clones, namely, (1) with the help of telomere-specific
probes, providing for choosing the clones that contain telomeric repeats and the associated sequences, and (2)
using as probes the DNA sequences localized by in situ
hybridization to the chromosome ends.
Spelt1 and Spelt52 are the satellite DNA sequences
detected by in situ hybridization on the chromosome ends
of several diploid and polyploid Triticum and Aegilops species. Spelt1 sequences are the genome-specific subtelomeric tandem repeats of Ae. speltoides (2n = 14), the putative
progenitor of the B and G genomes in polyploid wheats
[12]. The number of Spelt1 localization sites on the chromosome ends of this species is mainly 24-28 per genome,
although some accessions contain smaller number of
these sites. The copy number of Spelt1 is considerably
decreased in the genomes of polyploid species; the maximal number of hybridization sites, amounting to 12, is
detected on the chromosome ends of the tetraploid wheat
T. timopheevii (GGAtAt genome). In the tetraploid (BBAA)
and hexaploid (BBAADD) wheats of the Emmer group,
the number of the loci containing these repeats varies
from zero to six and Spelt1 is localized to the ends of predominantly B genome chromosomes [12].
Spelt52 is localized to the subtelomeric chromosome
regions of the three of five diploid species from the section
Sitopsis (Ae. speltoides, Ae. longissima, and Ae. sharonensis)

and is undetectable in the genomes of the remaining diploid species, progenitors of the A and D genomes of hexaploid wheat. In Ae. speltoides, Spelt52 is in the
subtelomeric regions of the majority of chromosomes;
however, the number of chromosomes containing this
repeat decreases to three in the tetraploid wheats of the
Timopheevi group. Neither Spelt52 nor homologous
sequences were detectable by in situ hybridization in the
Emmer wheats, including soft wheat [12,25].
Both subtelomeric sequences, Spelt1 and Spelt52, are
always detectable by PCR and Southern hybridization in
the genome of wheat even when in situ hybridization fails
to identify these repeats on the chromosomes [26].
The aim of this research was to analyze the organization
of subtelomeric genomic regions containing the Spelt1
and Spelt52 sequences in the B genome of hexaploid
wheat.

advantages enabling Spelt1 and Spelt52 to be used as
probes for selecting appropriate subtelomeric BAC clones.
We screened the T. aestivum (cv. Renan) BAC genomic
libraries, representing 8Ã genome equivalents, with 1 032
192 clones. The first step consisted in PCR screening of
pools of BAC clones. We used the universal Spelt1(F/R)
and Spelt52(F/R) primers (see Materials and Methods).
The PCR pattern corresponding to a multiband amplification, characteristic of tandemly organized DNA
sequences, was obtained for five BAC clones with
Spelt52(F/R) primers. These five BAC clones were used for
further characterization (Table 1). We failed to identify
Spelt1-containing BAC using this PCR screening strategy.
Therefore, we hybridized part of the library (290 000 BAC
clones) with Spelt1 probe and identified four BAC clones
for further analysis (Table 1).
Characterization of candidate subtelomeric clones
The BAC clones identified as containing Spelt1 and
Spelt52 repeats were further characterized as follows:

lowest, 25%. The results of in situ hybridization were consistent, confirming a high content of repeats (mainly of
mobile elements) in BAC clones. The hybridization signals covered the entire length of T. aestivum chromosomes

clones, two BAC clones (2383A24 and 112D20) hybridized to a limited set of chromosomes. Predominantly subtelomeric location on the common wheat chromosomes
was demonstrated for BAC_2050O8 only; in this clone,
the repeat content was lower then in other clones (Figure
1c, Table 1). The distribution pattern of BAC_2050O8 on
the chromosomes was different. Some of the chromosomes, such as 5A, gave a distinct hybridization signal
only at the chromosomal end, whereas in other chromosomes, such as 4AL, 5BL, and 7BL, hybridization signal
displayed multiple locations on their distal third. Weak
signals in the interstitial regions of chromosomes indicated that part of the sequences present in this BAC clone
were present not only in telomeres, but also in other chromosome regions. The Spelt1 and Spelt52 contents in the
selected BAC clones were estimated by dot hybridization.
The BAC clones isolated by PCR using Spelt52(F/R) primers contained 23-28 copies of Spelt52. No Spelt1 repeats
were found in these clones (Table 1). The BAC clones
selected by the hybridization to the Spelt1 probe contained up to seven copies of this repeat. Among them,
Spelt1 was detectable only in single copies in clone
112D20. The Spelt52 sequences were also identified in
clone BAC_112D20, which was originally selected using
the Spelt1 probe (Table 1). To confirm that Spelt1 and
Spelt52 were organized in tandem arrays in the corresponding BAC clones, we assayed the corresponding BAC
clones using two methods: PCR with the primers specific
to these two repeats and RFLP analysis of partially
digested BAC clones (HaeIII for Spelt1 and EcoRI for
Spelt52). The arrays of tandemly arranged Spelt1
sequence were found in BAC clones 2322J20, 2383A24,
and 2424P01 and arrays of Spelt52, in BAC clones
110B21, 2050O8, 478L20, 110O07, and 1487N20 (data
not shown). The BAC clones were also examined for the
presence of the tandem repeats pSc119.2 and pAs1, used
for identification of T. aestivum chromosomes. Part of
these repeats was located in the subtelomeric regions in
the common wheat chromosomes [29]. Southern hybridization showed that pSc119.2 repeats were absent in these
BAC clones, whereas pAs1 repeats were present in
BAC_478L20 only, giving a rather strong hybridization
signal (Table 1). No telomeric repeats (TTTAGGG)n were
identified in all BAC clones when using telomeric repeat
synthetic probe (see Materials and Methods).
In situ hybridization of BAC fragments
It is very difficult to accurately localize wheat BAC clones
on chromosomes using in situ hybridization, because they
are very rich in repetitive DNA sequences, mainly transposons, present everywhere on the chromosomes [30].
Thus, we attempted to localize these BAC clones through
their fragmentation and in situ hybridization of the
derived fragments on the chromosomes of common
wheat. The procedure consisted in (1) choosing and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/414

hybridization of BAC fragments covering more than 10 kb
and free of repeats or repeat-poor and (2) hybridization of
the fragments containing Spelt52 sequences. The repeatpoor BAC fragments were chosen based on hybridization
of BAC restriction fragments with total wheat DNA and
with the Spelt1 and Spelt52 probes. The DNA fragments
of 10 kb and longer were used as probes for in situ hybridization. Consequently, we succeeded in isolating fragments of about 30 kb (2322J20/30) and 40 kb (478L20/
40) from BAC clones 2322J20 and 478L20, respectively.
These two fragments were localized to the subtelomeric
chromosome regions; the result of in situ hybridization of
2322J20/30 is shown in Figure 1b. A fragment of about 21
kb was isolated from BAC_2050O8. In situ hybridization
of this fragment confirmed its subtelomeric localization;
however, this approach failed to identify precise chromosome localizations of BAC_2050O8. For the remaining
BAC clones, the attempts to identify repeat-poor fragments were unsuccessful, presumably, because of the
abundance of repetitive sequences (Table 1). The presence
of Spelt52 tandem repeats with the total length of 850010 000 bp (the monomeric unit of 380-390 bp) in the
BAC clones of cv. Renan made this repeat advantageous as
a probe for localizing BACs (Table 1). With this in mind,
we performed in situ hybridization of a PCR fragment of
BAC_2050O8 (Spelt52_2050O8), obtained using
Spelt52(F/R). Spelt52_2050O8 hybridized to the ends of
three chromosome arms: 1BS, 4BL, and 7BL (Figure 1d).
Analysis of nucleotide sequence of subtelomeric
BAC_2050O8
For a more detailed analysis of the structure of subtelomeric DNA, the BAC_2050O8 with a predominant subtelomeric in situ localization was completely sequenced
according to Chantret et al. [31]. The obtained sequence
was annotated according to the following strategy. First,
the repetitive sequences were identified in the Triticeae
Repetitive Sequence Database (TREP) [32] using the
BLASTN and BLASTX algorithms [33] and in the RepBase
[34] using the CENSOR program [35]. Then, we predicted
the genes using the GeneMark.hmm [36] and FGENESH
programs [37]. The structure of the ~120 kb BAC clone is
shown in Figure 2. The transposable elements identified
in 2050O8 were listed in Table 2. All the repetitive
sequences (including transposons and tandem repeats) in
this BAC clone constituted 48.9%. Interestingly, DNA
transposons were predominant, representing 24.6% of
the entire BAC clone length, whereas retrotransposons
constituted only 8.4%. The main DNA transposon subclass in subtelomeric BAC_2050O8 was CACTA, constituting 53.1% of all transposable elements and 17.5% of
the BAC clone length. CACTA was represented by Caspar
and Isaac elements with complete ends and partial Jorge
and Fergat elements (Table 2). Caspar_2050O8 was 11
666 bp in length; in addition, it was the only full-length

element, which contained two ORFs (open reading
frames) corresponding to the transposase and CTG-2
genes. The Spelt52 sequence represented 8.2% of the total
BAC clone length (Table 2). Sequence analysis confirmed
that aside from Spelt52, no other tandem repeats were
identified. Five hypothetical genes were identified and
accounted for 6.1% of the total BAC clone length. Analysis
of the predicted ORFs, which were not the parts of transposable elements, was detailed in Table 3. The first two
genes were homologous to the hypothetical rice genes and
contained conserved xyloglucan endotransglycosylase
and riboflavin deaminase-reductase domains; the third
was a putative gene for peroxisomal membrane protein
PEX11-1. The remaining two ORFs were hypothetical
genes: one contained the armadillo/beta-catenin-like
repeats, and the other was unknown, predicted by
FGENESH [37] and GeneMark.Hmm [36]. The genes were
separated by LINE retrotransposon insertion and unassigned DNA sequences. BLAST alignments of the
BAC_2050O8 sequence and the contigs containing
mapped wheat ESTs (expressed sequence tags) from
GrainGenes database [38] identified two contigs, 1802
and 11876, with a high homology to 2050O8 sequence.
EST contig 1802 was located on chromosomes 6AS and
6BL
[http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/westsql/con
tig.cgi, NSFT03P2_Contig1802]. The level of homology
between EST consensus 1802 (length 489 bp, location on
6AS and 6BL) and BAC 2050O8 sequence (length 501 bp,
position 98604-99104 bp) was 86%. The corresponding
region of 2050O8 was annotated as unassigned DNA
sequences. The homology of the other EST contig 11876
[http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/westsql/contig.cgi,
NSFT03P2_Contig11876] (length 826 bp, location on
5AL, 4BL, and 4DL) to BAC_2050O8 was higher (97%) in
a 805 bp stretch, and the region of homology was in the
region of the putative peroxisomal membrane protein
PEX11-1 (Table 3). It was of interest that comparison of

the exon-intron structure between PEX11-1_2050O8 and
EST contig revealed a complete correspondence of the EST
to the coding part of the gene. Comparison of restriction
sites in BAC_2050O8 with the mapping data for EST contig 11876 http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/westsql/
map_image.cgi suggested that BAC_2050O8 was localized to the telomeric part of chromosome 4BL (bin 4BL-5
0.86-1.0). BAC_2050O8 could be more precisely localized according to the homology with EST sequence
BE638121 from contig 11876, which was mapped to the
telomeric bin 4BL-10 0.95-1.0 [39].
We performed the BLAST search for the predicted genes in
BAC_2050O8 and their protein products in the Rice
Genome Annotation Project Database [40]. We found
that the four predicted wheat genes, displaying a significant homology to four putative rice genes, belonged to
clone OSJNBa0056G13 pseudomolecule (virtual contig),
located at the distal end of rice chromosome 3S [http://
rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/rice/
?name=OSJNBa0056G13, GenBank:AC134236] (Table
3). The rice genes were located close to each other, and
their order was the same as that of the corresponding
genes in BAC_2050O8; however, one of the genes,
namely, Os03g02610, was in the opposite orientation as
compared with BAC_2050O8. All wheat genes showed a
significant homology at the amino acid and nucleotide
levels to the putative expressed rice genes. At the amino
acid level, gene_2050O8-3 matched best to the rice putative protein Os03g02590 (peroxisomal membrane protein PEX11-1), displaying 87% homology over the entire
length. Both these genes (rice and wheat) had six introns
of about 100 bp. The identity of coding sequences is 81%;
71% of the nucleotide changes were synonymous. The
identity of introns is 37-47%.
Other genes also demonstrated significant homology to
rice (E < e-80 for protein): at the amino acid level,
gene_2050O8-1 was homologous to Os03g02610
(xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase protein 5
precursor), gene_2050O8-2 to Os03g02600 (riboflavin
biosynthesis protein ribD), and gene_2050O8-4 to
Os03g02580 (armadillo/beta-catenin-like repeat family
protein) (Table 3).
Analysis of Spelt52 nucleotide sequences in BAC_2050O8
The Spelt52 sequences in BAC_2050O8 were organized as
two arrays of repetitive units with a "head-to-tail" orientation. The first array consisted of seven complete units and
one truncated fragment at its 3' end. The second array was
located 1375 bp from the first and consisted of 18 complete and two outermost truncated units.

To estimate the degree of Spelt52 sequence conservation
in BAC_2050O8, we aligned the nucleotide sequences of

25 complete units using the Multalin program [41] and
calculated for each monomer the percentage of identity to
the consensus sequence obtained from the Multalin alignment [see Additional file 1]. The mean identity to the consensus was 93% (within the range of 88-96%). There were
no specific differences between the elements from the first
and second arrays.

To investigate the evolution of Spelt52 repeat in Triticeae
species, all the publicly available Spelt52 sequences were
used. Five Spelt52 sequences [GenBank: AY117400,
AY117401, AY082346, AY082347, Z21644] were found,
all derived from Ae. speltoides genome. It was earlier demonstrated that the Spelt52 repeat family consisted of two
types of monomeric units: Spelt52.1 and Spelt52.2, which

two major branches formed by Spelt52.1 and Spelt52.2

Discussion
Spelt1 and Spelt52 as probes for isolating subtelomeric
clones
The gaps remaining in the telomeric regions pose hindrances to complete sequencing of eukaryotic genomes
[22]. New genomic libraries were constructed using various plasmid vectors for closing gaps and capturing the telomeric sequences [23,43]. The diversity of DNA that
marks the telomeric/subtelomeric regions facilitates the
task of sequencing regions at the chromosomal ends. This
is quite timely in view of the wheat genome sequencing
initiative [44]. Our relevant finding was that Spelt1 and

sequences Spelt52.1 and Spelt52.2 were taken from GenBank. All Spelt52 sequences contained in T. aestivum BAC_2050O8
were represented by the consensus Spelt52_2050O8 sequence. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree with 500 bootstrap replicates was constructed using MEGA4 software package [42].

Spelt52 sequences were specific markers of the chromosome ends of Ae. speltoides and several polyploid wheat
species. Hybridization of Spelt52_2050O8 probe to the
wheat cv. Renan chromosomes detected three sites with a
weak signal per haploid genome at chromosome ends
(Figure 1d). Spelt1 was localized on two chromosome
ends per haploid genome of cv. Renan; one site gave a
rather strong hybridization signal (data not shown). Use
of Spelt1 and Spelt52 for screening the BAC library of cv.
Renan enabled us to choose nine clones presumably associated with the subtelomeric regions (Table 1).
BAC_2050O8 was localized by in situ hybridization (at
the levels of both the clone and subclones) predominantly to the subtelomeric chromosome regions (Figures
1c, d). Comparing the in situ hybridization data for the
Spelt52_2050O8 and the BLAST search against the wheat
mapped EST contigs [38], we localized 2050O8 to the end
of 4BL. A subtelomeric localization of two additional BAC
clones, 2322J20 and 478L20, was demonstrated by in situ
hybridization of their subclones 2322J20/30 and 478L20/
40, respectively (Figure 1b). Since the Spelt52 probe
hybridizes only with the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 1BS, 4BL, or 7BL, we can assume that the BAC
clones containing over 23 copies (8740 bp) of the Spelt52
repeats were from the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 1BS, 4BL, or 7BL (Table 1). Of the Spelt1-containing BAC clones, 2424P01, partly overlapping with clone
2322J20, can be also ascribed to subtelomeric regions
(Figure 1b). The in situ hybridization on the chromosomes of cv. Renan detected two terminal blocks per haploid genome. However, the screening of BAC library with
Spelt1 probe found no clones containing Spelt1 regions
with a length exceeding 5000 bp (the region of repeated
DNA detected by in situ hybridization) (Table 1). Two reasons can explain the absence of extended Spelt1 regions in
the selected clones, namely:
(1) The terminal chromosome regions, containing
longer Spelt1 repetitive sequences, escaped cloning
when obtaining the genomic BAC library of T. aestivum cv. Renan, as they could be cut off by the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, HindIII, and BamHI, used
for hydrolysis [24]; and
(2) A high recombination activity in the region of
Spelt1 repeats could result in discharge of part of these
repeats during construction of this library. Such effects
were observed earlier when we attempted to clone the
tandem Spelt1 repeats with a length of 2000 bp and
more (unpublished data). A high recombination level
leading to deletions of Spelt1 repeats in the progeny of
individual self-pollinated plants was also observed
[45].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/414

A subtelomeric localization of two clones, 2383A24 and
112D20, was questionable because of a low Spelt1 and
Spelt52 copy number and a failure of in situ hybridization
approach in determining their precise localization. Thus,
the example of Spelt1 and Spelt52 repeats demonstrated
that satellite DNA sequences from the subtelomeric
regions of diploid wheat progenitor can be used for selecting the BAC clones from the corresponding regions of
common wheat chromosomes.
Specific features in organization and evolution of Spelt52
repeats
The Spelt52 repeats were undetectable in polyploid
Emmer wheats (BBAA and BBAADD genomes) by in situ
hybridization [12,25]. On the other hand, both blot
hybridization and PCR indicated the presence of individual sequences belonging to this family in some studied
accessions of the polyploid wheats with the BBAA and
BBAADD genomes [46]. The failure of in situ hybridization in detecting these sequences can result not only from
that detection of the DNA sequences shorter than 5000 bp
by this method is hindered, but also with the divergence
between the probe used for hybridization and the homologous sequences within the studied species. In particular,
it has been shown that two probes with a homology of
87.3% give quite different hybridization patterns of the
tandem repeat family pAs1, found in the genomes of Ae.
tauschii and barley [47].

Use of the primers for Spelt52 repeat allowed us to detect
a tandem organization of several BAC clones already
when screening the BAC library. The amplification of
Spelt52 fragments using the same primers and
BAC_2050O8 as a template and produced probe for
hybridization allowed us for the first time to localize
Spelt52 repeats in the chromosomes of common wheat by
in situ hybridization to the ends of chromosome arms
1BS, 4BL, and 7BL of wheat cv. Renan. Note that the PCR
fragment of Spelt52 sequence was successfully mapped
earlier to the end of the genetic map of 4BL chromosomes
[39].
The 25 Spelt52 sequences detected in BAC_2050O8 displayed a high level of homology (on the average, 93%).
Although BAC_2050O8 contains two regions with
Spelt52 tandems, the clustering of repeated units into two
groups according to the primary structure was not
observed. It is impossible to compare it with extended
Spelt52 tandem regions of other accessions and species as
the corresponding tandem regions are absent in the relevant databases. Spelt52 family contained two types of
repeated units -- Spelt52.1 and Spelt52.2; note that these
monomers in the majority of the studied accessions Ae.
speltoides alternate [26]. The tandems formed by Spelt52.2
sequences have been found only in one Ae. speltoides

accession, TS01. In the hexaploid wheat genome, in
BAC_2050O8, we detected only Spelt52.2 tandem
sequences (Figure 3). Taking into account that Ae.
speltoides is the most likely donor of the B/G genomes of
polyploid wheats, it would be useful to include the presence of different variants of the tandem arrangement of
Spelt52 in the phylogenetic studies of Sitopsis and Triticum
species.
A characteristic feature of the tandem repeats is their ability to amplify during the evolution, thereby increasing
their copy numbers and creating a high level of intraspecies polymorphism in the copy number [48]. An illustrative example of such variation is the Spelt1 family with the
repetitive unit of 178 bp. The number of sites where this
repeat is localized varies in a wide range in both Ae.
speltoides, for which it is genome-specific, and in polyploid
species, to whose formation Ae. speltoides has contributed
[12]. Both individual plants of the same accession and the
progeny of the same plant can differ in the copy number
of this repeat [45]. The level of Spelt52 polymorphism is
also rather high [12].
The amplification of the same tandem subtelomeric repetitive DNA sequences in evolutionary remote cereal species
has been described, whereas such amplification is absent
in closely related species. For example, the repeat family
350 bp/pSc200/pSc74 is characteristic of Secale cereale, S.
montanum, Dasypyrum villosum, D. breviaristatum, and
Agropyron cristatum; however, it has not been detected by
hybridization in other rye species [49]. Spelt52 repeats
have been localized to chromosomes of Ae. speltoides and
other two from four Sitopsis species (Ae. longissima and Ae.
sharonensis) [12,25]. The diversity on the presence of tandem repeats in the subtelomeric chromosome regions of
various cereal species suggested the existence of a common pool of sequences able to amplify during evolution,
forming a subtelomeric repeat family. Cloning and PCR
analysis of the amplification product obtained from the
rice (belonging to other cereal tribe) genome using the
primers specific to Spelt1 and Spelt52, we detected no
homology to either Spelt1 or Spelt52 repeats except for
the primer sequences (EA Salina, unpublished data). We
have not also found any degenerate sequences or
sequences homologous to Spelt52 repeat when comparing
wheat
syntenic
BAC_2050O8
and
rice
OSJNBa0056G13 pseudomolecule. Presumably, the pool
of the common sequences involved in amplification
events during evolution exists yet is stringently confined
to the frame of a taxonomic unit. Most likely, such unit for
cereals is a tribe.

Microcollinearity in the region of BAC_2050O8 of wheat
chromosomes 4BL and rice chromosome 3S
According to the data on distribution of EST DNA
sequences, the wheat group 4 chromosomes display the
most pronounced similarity to the short arm of rice chromosome 3 [39,50,51]. Individual deviations from collinearity were observed in the centromeric regions and distal
part of the consensus chromosome 4BL map. The distal
region of wheat chromosome 4BL has been compared in
detail with rice pseudochromosome 3S [39]. The most
pronounced distinctions were recorded in the terminal
telomeric bin 4BL-10 (0.95-1.0), which displayed a higher
recombination level. BAC_2050O8, which contains a
sequence with a 90% homology to EST BE638121, is
located at a distance of 17 mapped ESTs from the 4BL
chromosome end (about two-thirds of the entire terminal
bin) [39]. The four putative rice genes, belonging to
OSJNBa0056G13 pseudomolecule and displaying a significant homology to four predicted wheat gene in
BAC_2050O8, are located at a distance of about 870 kb
from the end of rice chromosome 3S. The terminal
regions of wheat (BAC_2050O8, chromosome end) and
rice (OSJNBa0056G13, chromosome end) displayed the
following differences: (1) 10 of the 17 wheat ESTs located
in this region have no homologous sequences in rice, and
(2) the DNA sequences covering about 500 kbp from the
end of chromosome 3S have no homologs on chromosome 4BL (according to BLAST results on February 20,
2009). In addition, comparison of the order of wheat ESTs
and rice pseudomolecules suggested that at least two
inversion events have occurred in this chromosome
region besides duplications (data not shown). The
changes in orientation of the first of the four genes predicted in BAC_2050O8 (encoding a hypothetical protein
with xyloglucan endotransglycosylase domain) relative to
the corresponding rice genes can result from such inversions. Note that the rice region (in OSJNBa0056G13) containing these four genes is of 9556 bp versus 29 612 bp of
the corresponding wheat region in BAC_2050O8 (Table
3). This difference results from an enlarged intergenic
region in BAC_2050O8 (totally amounting to 23737 bp
versus 3641 bp in rice). The intergenic regions in
BAC_2050O8 contains two degenerated LINE elements
(2941 and 2815 bp), one MITE element (117 bp), and an
unassigned sequence. At the nucleotide level, the intergenic regions of rice and wheat showed no similarity to
each other, and the regions flanking this block of genes in
rice showed no similarity to the overall BAC_2050O8
sequence.

The wheat regions containing the four predicted genes in
BAC_2050O8 is more than threefold longer that the corresponding region from rice OSJNBa0056G13, whereas
the overall wheat genome exceeds the rice genome more
than 40-fold and the distal region of chromosome 4BL is

Page 10 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:414

30-fold longer than the corresponding homologous
region in rice [39]. Thus, it is most likely that the wheat
genome increased in the regions free of genes. In the case
of BAC_2050O8, these are the regions of retrotransposons, CACTA transposons, Spelt52 tandem repeats, and
unassigned sequences.

Conclusion
Analysis of the T. aestivum cv. Renan BAC clones tagged by
subtelomere-specific sequences Spelt1 and Spelt52
allowed us to demonstrate the utility of Spelt1 and
Spelt52 subtelomeric repeats for isolation of the BAC
clones carrying subtelomeric DNA from genomic libraries. Analysis of the entire 119 737 bp nucleotide sequence
of BAC_2050O8, the subtelomeric localization of which
was demonstrated by FISH, provided new data on the primary structure of one of the distal regions in the T. aestivum B genome. In BAC_2050O8, class II transposons are
predominant and constitute 24.6% of the entire clone
length, while class I transposons account only for 8.4%,
although the latter transposon class is prevalent in majority of the other published Triticeae BAC clones [52-54].
Among class II transposons, the most abundant is CACTA
Caspar_2050O8.
The profound analysis of BAC_2050O8 sequence together
with FISH of Spelt52 sequences derived from
BAC_2050O8 allowed us to localize it to the terminal bin
4BL-10 (0.95-1.0). A microcollinearity of the wheat
(BAC_2050O8, 4BL) and rice (OSJNBa0056G13, 3S)
gene regions, encoding three hypothetical proteins and
putative peroxisomal membrane protein PEX11-1, was
demonstrated. It was shown for the first time that Spelt52
sequences have been involved in the evolution of the terminal regions in hexaploid wheat chromosomes.

Methods
BAC library screening
The BAC clones carrying subtelomeric tandem repeats
Spelt1 and Spelt52 [26] were obtained from the genomic
BAC library of T. aestivum cv. Renan [24] by hybridization
with Spelt1 probe and PCR screening using the primers
specific to Spelt52.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
BAC DNA preparation was obtained with a modified alkaline lysis procedure [55]. To estimate the insert length of
BAC clones, BAC plasmid DNA (2 ï­g) were digested with
NotI to release the insert from the vector. Restriction fragments were separated in 1% (w/v) agarose gel (14Â°C, 15
h, 150 V, ramped from 1 to 15 seconds) using a contourclamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) [56]. The
electrophoresis buffer was 0.5 Ã TBE (45 mM Tris-borate
pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA). Lambda concatemer was used
as a molecular size standard. The lengths of restriction

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/414

fragments were measured using the Gel analysis v1.0 program (Lytech, Russia)
PCR analysis
The specific primers were used for Spelt1 (Sp1F, 5'-tccaaaccat-ccccg-tcaag-cg-3' and Sp1R, 5'-aagtt-cttct-ggccgtgcca-ta-3') and Spelt52 (Sp52F, 5'-gcaca-caaac-ccggagaaag-t-3'and Sp52R, 5'-tcccc-gtttc-ttctc-tagcc-t-3') [26]
repeats. PCR analysis of BAC clones was performed in an
Eppendorf Mastercycler according to the following mode:
30 cycles of 1 min at 94Â°C, 1 min at 55Â°C, and 2 min at
72Â°C followed by a final stage of 15 min at 72Â°C. PCR
products were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose
gel.
Southern blot hybridization
Plasmids with inserted telomere-associated tandem
sequences Spelt1 and Spelt52, isolated from Ae. speltoides;
pSc119.2 from S. cereale; and pAs1 from Ae. tauschii were
used as probes [14,26-28]. Telomeric repeat synthetic
probe was obtained by PCR according to the protocol
originally described by [57]. Spelt1, Spelt52, pSc119.2,
and pAs1 probes were labeled by the random hexamer
method with ï¡-32P-dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
United Kingdom) using Klenow fragment [58]. BAC DNA
(2 ï­g) were digested by HindIII, BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, or partially digested with HaeIII (for
Spelt1) and EcoRI (for Spelt52), separated in 1-1.2% agarose gel, and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, United Kingdom). Filters
were first moistened by floating in 2 Ã SSC. Pre-hybridization was carried out at 65Â°C for 4 h in 6 Ã SSC, 5 Ã Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and denatured salmon sperm
DNA (100 mg/ml). Hybridization was conducted at 65Â°C
for 16 h in the same solution with denatured labeled
probe (1 ng/ml). After hybridization, filters were washed
at a room temperature in 2 Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS; 0.5 Ã SSC,
0.1% SDS and 0.1 Ã SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each. The
membranes were exposed with Kodak X-ray film for a few
hours to 3-7 days at -70Â°C depending on signal intensity.
Dot blot hybridization
The copy number of Spelt1 and Spelt52 sequences in BAC
clones was estimated by dot blot assay [59]. The serial
dilutions (1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05 ï­g) of each BAC DNA were
spotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane. The plasmid DNA
with Spelt1 and Spelt52 inserts were used as a standard
with a copy number of 108 to 1011. BAC and plasmid DNA
concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry
and gel electrophoresis. The DNA samples were denatured
with 0.3 M NaOH for 20 min before spotting, neutralized
after spotting with 2 Ã SSC for 5 min, cross-linked to
membrane using UV light, dried, and used for dot blot
hybridization. The conditions of pre-hybridization and
hybridization were as described above for Southern blot

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:414

hybridization. The signal intensity was counted for each
spot by a MiniBeta (LKB). The mean number of counts of
the ï¡-32P-dATP-labeled Spelt1 and Spelt52 probes was
calculated for each BAC. The copy number of specific
sequences in BAC DNA was estimated by comparing the
hybridization intensity with the standard.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
For fluorescence in situ hybridization, we used BAC
clones, recombinant plasmids, synthetic telomeric
probes, or large specific DNA fragments. Large specific
DNA fragments (more than 10 kbp long and containing
no repetitive sequences) were isolated from agarose gel
according to [55]. BAC DNA was treated with restriction
endonucleases BamHI, HindIII, and EcoRI, ran through
agarose gel until fragments separated well, transferred to
Hybond N+ membrane, and hybridized with ï¡-32P-dATPlabeled total DNA of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. The
bands that showed no hybridization signals and were
longer than 10 kbp were isolated and labeled. DNA probe
(1 ï­g) was labeled by nick translation to incorporate
biotin-16-dATP (Life Technologies, Gibco BRL) or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the
manufacturers' protocol. Telomeric probe was labeled by
PCR to incorporate biotin-16-dATP (Life Technologies,
Gibco BRL). Metaphase chromosomes were prepared and
FISH was performed according to [12] with minor modifications. To identify chromosomes carrying signals, we
used the probe combinations pSc119.2 + BAC and pAs1 +
BAC. The chromosomes were identified according to
standard chromosome nomenclature [60,61].
BAC sequencing and sequence analysis
BAC shotgun sequencing and sequence assembly were
carried out at the National Center of Sequencing (Evry,
France) as described [31]. Sequence annotation was done
according to the Guidelines for Annotating Wheat
Genomic Sequences from the International Genome
Wheat Sequencing Consortium [44]. The procedure was
two-step, including identification of repetitive elements
and identification of gene structure. For identification of
DNA repetitive elements, we screened the Triticeae Repetitive Elements Database at GrainGenes (TREP) [32], Rice
Genome Annotation Project Database [40], NCBI nonredundant nucleotide databases [62] using the BLASTN
algorithm [33] with a cutoff value of 1e-5, and RepBase
[34] using CENSOR program [35]. Hypothetical transposable element proteins were identified by BLASTX algorithm against TREP hypothetical protein and NCBI nonredundant protein databases. Gene structures in
BAC_2050O8 were identified by integrating the results of
predictor programs GeneMark.hmm [36] and FGENESH
[37]. The putative functions were assigned through
BLASTN searches against NCBI EST database (dbEST),
BLASTP, and BLASTX searches against NCBI non-redun-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/414

dant protein and Rice Genome Annotation Project database [40] according to criteria described in the Guidelines
for Annotating Wheat Genomic Sequences [44]. The DNA
sequences that were not assigned to transposable elements or genes were considered as unassigned DNA. The
alignments of Spelt52 nucleotide sequences were performed by Multalin program [41]; phylogenetic trees were
constructed using a neighbor-joining method by MEGA4
software package [42]. The nucleotide sequence reported
in this paper is deposited in the GenBank database under
accession number GQ165812.
