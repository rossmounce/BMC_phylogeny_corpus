Abstract
Background: Structured noncoding RNAs perform many functions that are essential for protein synthesis, RNA
processing, and gene regulation. Structured RNAs can be detected by comparative genomics, in which
homologous sequences are identified and inspected for mutations that conserve RNA secondary structure.
Results: By applying a comparative genomics-based approach to genome and metagenome sequences from
bacteria and archaea, we identified 104 candidate structured RNAs and inferred putative functions for many of
these. Twelve candidate metabolite-binding RNAs were identified, three of which were validated, including one
reported herein that binds the coenzyme S-adenosylmethionine. Newly identified cis-regulatory RNAs are
implicated in photosynthesis or nitrogen regulation in cyanobacteria, purine and one-carbon metabolism, stomach
infection by Helicobacter, and many other physiological processes. A candidate riboswitch termed crcB is
represented in both bacteria and archaea. Another RNA motif may control gene expression from 3'-untranslated
regions of mRNAs, which is unusual for bacteria. Many noncoding RNAs that likely act in trans are also revealed,
and several of the noncoding RNA candidates are found mostly or exclusively in metagenome DNA sequences.
Conclusions: This work greatly expands the variety of highly structured noncoding RNAs known to exist in
bacteria and archaea and provides a starting point for biochemical and genetic studies needed to validate their
biologic functions. Given the sustained rate of RNA discovery over several similar projects, we expect that far more
structured RNAs remain to be discovered from bacterial and archaeal organisms.

Background
Ongoing efforts to identify and characterize various
structured noncoding RNAs from bacteria are revealing
the remarkable functions that structured RNAs can perform [1-3]. To detect novel RNA classes in bacteria and
archaea, a variety of bioinformatics strategies have been
used [4-12]. In our recent efforts to identify novel structured RNAs, we applied a scheme based on detecting
RNA secondary structures upstream of homologous protein-coding genes [13,14]. However, this strategy is best
suited to finding cis-regulatory RNAs, not noncoding
RNAs. Also, some cis-regulatory RNAs such as c-di-

GMP riboswitches [14,15] or ydaO motif RNAs [5] are
not often found upstream of homologous genes [13].
We therefore implemented a search system that is
independent of protein-coding genes. In brief, our system
clusters intergenic regions (IGRs) [16] by using a
BLAST-based method [17] and infers secondary structures by using CMfinder [18]. Then, as before [19,20],
the identified structures are used in homology searches
to find homologues that allow CMfinder to refine further
its structural alignment. The resulting alignments are
scored and then analyzed manually to identify the most
promising candidates and to infer possible biologic roles.
This method was applied to all available bacterial and
archaeal genome sequences, as well as metagenome (that
is, environmental) sequences, and identified 104 candidate RNA motifs described in this report. Some additional RNAs will be reported later (unpublished data)

that bind cyclic di-GMP or tetrahydrofolate, that represent diverse variants of hammerhead self-cleaving ribozymes, or that exhibit exceptional characteristics
suggesting a novel or unusual biochemical function [21].
In this report, we provide biochemical evidence that
members of one of the 104 RNA motifs bind S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
in vitro, and presumably regulate the downstream genes
coding for SAM synthetase. The rest of this report provides predicted structures of selected motifs and hypotheses regarding their biologic roles. The remaining motifs,
as well as additional information on the selected motifs,
are presented in Additional File 1. Discussions about
individual motifs are largely independent, but are
grouped into common putative functional roles. A list of
all 104 motifs is provided in Table 1 and Additional File
2. Multiple-sequence alignments of motifs, the organisms
in which their representatives appear, and predicted
flanking genes are available in printable format in Additional File 3, and alignments are provided in machinereadable format in Additional Files 4 and 5. Consensus
diagrams for all motifs are depicted in Additional File 6.
Selected motifs (Table 1) were submitted for inclusion in
the Rfam Database version 10.1 [22].

Results and discussion
Identification and analysis of RNA structures

Promising RNA motifs predicted by our automated
bioinformatics procedure were subsequently evaluated
manually (see Materials and Methods). As previously
reported [14], we identified promising motifs by seeking
RNAs that exhibit both regions of conserved nucleotide
sequence and evidence of secondary structure. Evidence
for the latter characteristic involved the identification of
nucleotide variation between representatives of a motif
that conserves a given structure. For example, one form
of covariation involves mutations to two nucleotides
that preserve a Watson-Crick base pair. Assessment of
covariation can be complicated, because, for example,
spurious evidence of covariation is sometimes a consequence of sequence misalignments. Therefore, final covariation assessments were performed manually.
Cis-regulatory RNAs in bacteria are typically located
in 5' UTRs. However, transcription start sites for most
genes have not been experimentally established. Therefore, when a motif commonly resides upstream of coding regions, we usually assume that it resides in 5' UTRs
and is a cis-regulatory RNA. Additional analysis of our
system and our scheme for naming motifs is described
in Additional File 1.
Riboswitch candidates

Riboswitches [1,2,23] are RNAs that sense metabolites
and regulate gene expression in response to changes in

Page 2 of 17

metabolite concentrations. Typically, they form domains
within 5' UTRs of mRNAs, and their ligand binding triggers a folding change that modulates expression of the
downstream gene. Therefore, good riboswitch candidates are consistently located in potential 5' UTRs. Most
known riboswitches require complex secondary and
tertiary structures to form tight and highly selective
binding pockets for metabolite ligands. Therefore, motifs
that comprise the strongest riboswitch candidates have
complex secondary structures and stretches of highly
conserved nucleotide positions. Motifs were analyzed
manually according to these criteria.
We identified a total of 12 RNA motifs that exhibited
these characteristics. Here we report the validation of a
new SAM/SAH-binding RNA class, and analysis of
other riboswitch candidates. Experimental validation of
cyclic di-GMP-II and tetrahydrofolate riboswitches will
be reported elsewhere. Details describing additional
experimental validation efforts and ligands tested with
other riboswitch candidates are presented in Additional
File 1.
SAM/SAH-binding RNA

The coenzyme SAM and its reaction by-product SAH
are frequently targeted ligands for riboswitches. Three
structurally unrelated superfamilies [24] of SAM-binding
riboswitches [25] and one SAH-binding riboswitch class
[26] have been validated previously. All discriminate
against SAM or SAH by orders of magnitude, despite
the fact that SAM differs from SAH only by a single
methyl group and associated positive charge.
Our current search produced a motif, termed SAM/
SAH (Figure 1a), that is found exclusively in the order
Rhodobacterales of a-proteobacteria. The RNA motif is
consistently found immediately upstream of metK genes,
which encode SAM synthetase. Because known SAMbinding riboswitches are frequently upstream of metK
genes [25], the element’s gene association suggests that
it may function as part of a novel SAM-sensing riboswitch class.
A SAM/SAH RNA from Roseobacter sp. SK209-2-6,
called “SK209-52 RNA,” was subjected to in-line probing
[27] in the presence of various concentrations of SAM
or SAH (Figure 1b,c). SK209-52 RNA appears to bind
SAH with a dissociation constant (KD) of ~4.3 μM and
SAM with a KD of ~8.6 μM (Figure 1d). Similar results
were obtained with SAM/SAH RNA constructs from
other species (data not shown). However, because SAM
undergoes spontaneous demethylation, SAM samples
contain at least some of the breakdown product SAH.
Thus, apparent affinity for SAM could result from binding only of contaminating SAH [26]. However, binding
assays based on equilibrium dialysis and molecularrecognition experiments indicate that SAM/SAH RNAs
do bind SAM (Additional File 1).

It is interesting to note that SAM/SAH aptamers, which
are the smallest of the SAM and SAH aptamer classes,
presumably cannot discriminate strongly against SAH.
This lack of discrimination may mean that genes associated with this RNA are purposefully regulated by either
SAM or SAH. However, SAM is more abundant in cells
than is SAH [28]. This fact, coupled with the frequent
association of the RNA motif with metK gene contexts of
SAM/SAH RNAs, suggests that their biologic role is to
function as part of a SAM-responsive riboswitch.

crcB motif

The crcB motif (Figure 2) is detected in a wide variety of
phyla in bacteria and archaea. Thus, crcB RNAs join
only one known riboswitch class (TPP) [29], and few
other classes of RNAs, that are present in more than
one domain of life. The crcB motif consistently resides
in the potential 5' UTRs of genes, including those
involved in DNA repair (mutS), K+, or Cl- transport, or
genes encoding formate hydrogen lyase. In many cases,
predicted transcription terminators overlap the

Figure 2 Riboswitch candidates crcB, yjdF, wcaG, manA, pfl, epsC, and ykkC-III. Annotations are as described in Figure 1a. The transcription
terminators that often overlap crcB or pfl RNAs are not depicted because they are not consistent in all representatives. They are annotated in
Additional File 3. Question marks signify base-paired regions ("P4?” in yjdF, “P2?” in pfl, and “pseudoknot?” in manA) with weaker covariation or
structural conservation. The pseudoknot in the epsC motif was predicted by others (Wade Winkler, personal communication, 2009). A portion of
this figure was adapted from the supplementary data of a previous publication [21].

Weinberg et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R31
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R31

conserved crcB motif. Therefore, if ligand binding of the
putative riboswitch stabilizes the conserved structure
predicted for these RNAs, higher ligand concentrations
are expected to inhibit terminator stem formation and
increase gene expression.
The crcB motif might regulate genes in response to
stress conditions that can damage DNA and be mitigated by increased expression of other genes controlled
by the RNAs (Additional File 1). If crcB RNAs are riboswitches, they presumably sense a metabolite present in
organisms that is indicative of a common cellular condition in two domains of life.
pfl motif

The pfl motif (Figure 2) is found in four bacterial phyla.
As with crcB RNAs, predicted transcription terminators
overlap the 3' region of many pfl RNAs; thus, gene
expression is likely increased in response to higher
ligand concentrations. The genes most commonly associated with pfl RNAs are related to purine biosynthesis,
or to synthesis of formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-THF),
which is used for purine biosynthesis. These genes
include purH, fhs, pfl, glyA, and folD. PurH formylates
AICAR by using formyl-THF as the donor. Formyl-THF
can be synthesized by the product of fhs by using formate and THF as substrates. Formate, in turn, is produced in the reaction catalyzed by Pfl. The upregulation
of Pfl to create formate for the synthesis of purines was
observed previously [30]. Formyl-THF can also be produced from THF and serine by the combined action of
GlyA and FolD. Thus, the five genes most commonly
predicted to be regulated by pfl RNAs have a role in the
synthesis of purines or formyl-THF. Most other genes
apparently regulated by pfl RNAs (Additional File 3)
encode enzymes that perform other steps in purine
synthesis, or convert between THF or its 1-carbon
adducts at least as a side effect (for example, metH)
(Additional File 1).
yjdF motif

The yjdF motif (Figure 2) is found in many Firmicutes,
including Bacillus subtilis. In most cases, it resides in
potential 5' UTRs of homologues of the yjdF gene
(Additional File 7), whose function is unknown. However, in Streptococcus thermophilus, a yjdF RNA motif is
associated with an operon whose protein products
synthesize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
(Additional File 3). Also, the S. thermophilus yjdF RNA
lacks typical yjdF motif consensus features downstream
of and including the P4 stem. Thus, if yjdF RNAs are
riboswitch aptamers, the S. thermophilus RNAs might
sense a distinct compound that structurally resembles
the ligand bound by other yjdF RNAs. Or perhaps these
RNAs have an alternate solution to form a similar binding site, as is observed with some SAM riboswitches
[24].

manA and wcaG motifs

The manA and wcaG motifs (Figure 2) are found almost
exclusively in marine metagenome sequences, but are
each detected in T4-like phages that infect cyanobacteria
(Additional File 3). Also, two manA RNAs are found in
g-proteobacteria. Remarkably, many phages of cyanobacteria have incorporated genes involved in metabolism,
including exopolysaccharide production and photosynthesis [31-33], and some of these cyanophages carry manA
or wcaG RNAs. RNA domains corresponding to the
manA motif are commonly located in potential 5' UTRs
of genes (Additional File 3) involved in mannose or
fructose metabolism, nucleotide synthesis, ibpA chaperones, and photosynthetic genes. Distinctively, wcaG
RNAs typically appear to regulate genes related to production of exopolysaccharides or genes that are induced
by high-light conditions. Perhaps manA and wcaG
RNAs are used by phages to modify their hosts’ metabolism [33], although they may also be exploited by uninfected bacteria.
epsC motif

RNA domains corresponding to the epsC motif (Figure
2) are found in potential 5' UTRs of genes related to
exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis, such as epsC [34], in
B. subtilis and related species. Different species use different chemical subunits in their EPS [35], which acts in
processes such as biofilm formation, capsule synthesis,
and sporulation [35-37]. If epsC RNAs are riboswitches,
they might sense an intermediate in EPS synthesis that
is common to all bacteria containing epsC RNAs. Signalling molecules also regulate EPS synthesis in some bacteria [36,38], and are therefore also candidate riboswitch
ligands.
The epsC motif was discovered independently by
another group and named EAR (W. Winkler, personal
communication, 2009). This candidate has been shown
to exhibit transcription antitermination activity, likely by
directly interacting with protein components of the
transcription elongation complex (W. Winkler, personal
communication, 2009), and therefore, this RNA motif
may not also function as a metabolite-binding RNA.
Intriguingly, the JUMPstart sequence motif [39] is found
in the 5' UTRs of genes related to polysaccharide synthesis and also is associated with modification of transcriptional elongation [40-43]. We detected a conserved
stem-loop structure among JUMPstart elements (Additional File 1).
ykkC-III motif

The previously identified ykkC [5] and mini-ykkC [14]
motifs are associated with genes related to those associated with ykkC-III, but these RNAs have distinct conserved sequence and structural features. The new-found
ykkC-III motif (Figure 2) is in potential 5' UTRs of emrE
and speB genes. emrE is the most common gene family

Weinberg et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R31
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R31

associated with mini-ykkC and the second most common to be associated with ykkC, and speB is also associated with ykkC RNAs in many cases (Additional File
8). Although a perfectly conserved ACGA sequence in
ykkC-III is similar to the less rigidly conserved ACGR
terminal loops of mini-ykkC RNAs, the structural contexts are different (Additional File 1). All three RNA
motifs have characteristics of gene-control elements that
regulate similar genes, and perhaps respond to changing
concentrations of the same metabolite. However, unlike
mini-ykkC, whose small and repetitive hairpin architecture is suggestive of protein binding, both ykkC and
ykkC-III exhibit more complex structural features that
are suggestive of direct metabolite binding.
glnA and Downstream-peptide motifs

The glnA and Downstream peptide motifs carry similar
sequence and structural features (Figure 3), although the
genes they are associated with are very different. Many
genes presumably regulated by glnA RNAs are clearly
involved in nitrogen metabolism, and include nitrogen
regulatory protein PII, glutamine synthetase, glutamate
synthase, and ammonium transporters. Another associated gene is PMT1479, which was the most repressed
gene when Prochlorococcus marinus was starved for
nitrogen [44]. Some glnA RNAs occur in tandem, which
is an arrangement previously associated with more-digital gene regulation [45,46].
The Downstream-peptide motif is found in potential 5'
UTRs of cyanobacterial ORFs whose products are typically 17 to 100 amino acids long and are predicted not
to belong to a known protein family. We observe a pattern of synonymous mutations and insertions or deletions in multiples of three nucleotides (data not shown),
supporting the prediction of a short conserved coding
sequence. A previously predicted noncoding RNA called
“yfr6” [47] is ~250 nucleotides in length and contains a
short ORF. The 5' UTRs of these ORFs correspond to
Downstream-peptide RNAs. Although only two full-

Page 8 of 17

length yfr6 RNAs were found, 634 Downstream-peptide
RNAs were detected, suggesting that only the 5' UTR is
conserved. Experiments on yfr6 showed that transcription starts ~20 nucleotides 5' to the proposed Downstream-peptide motif [47]. Also, a Downstream-peptide
RNA resides in the potential 5' UTR of a gene that
appears to be downregulated in response to nitrogen
starvation [47]. A conserved amino acid sequence in
predicted proteins associated with Downstream-peptide
RNAs hints at a possible regulatory mechanism (Additional File 1). The proposed structural resemblance
between glnA and Downstream-peptide RNAs suggests
they may bind to chemically similar ligands, and previously conducted experiments suggest that both elements downregulate genes in response to nitrogen
depletion.
Cyanobacterial photosystem regulatory motifs
psaA motif

Representatives of the psaA motif (Figure 4) occur in
the potential 5' UTRs of Photosystem-I psaAB operons
in certain cyanobacteria. The motif includes three hairpins that often include UNCG tetraloops [48]. Although
the regulation of psaAB genes in species with psaA
RNAs has not been studied, multiple psa genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 are regulated in response to light
through DNA elements that are presumably transcription factor-binding sites [49]. Photosynthetic organisms
upregulate photosystem-I (psa) genes under low-light
conditions to maximize energy output, but must reduce
their expression under sustained high-light conditions,
to avoid damage from free radicals [50]. psaA RNAs
could be involved in this regulation, although we have
not found this RNA element upstream of psa genes
other than psaAB.
PhotoRC-I, PhotoRC-II, and psbNH motifs

Two distinct RNA structures (Figure 4) are associated
with genes belonging to the photosynthetic reaction
center family of proteins that are probably psbA.
PhotoRC-I RNAs are present in known cyanobacteria
and in marine environmental samples, whereas
PhotoRC-II RNAs are detected only in marine samples
and a cyanophage. These motifs and psbNH are further
described in Additional File 1.
Other motifs
L17 downstream element

Figure 3 Riboswitch candidates glnA and Downstream-peptide.
Annotations are as described in Figure 1a. Purple lines and numbers
indicate conserved sequences or structures common to the two
motifs.

The L17 downstream element (Additional File 6) is
located downstream (within the potential 3' UTRs) of
genes that encode ribosomal protein L17. In many
cases, no annotated genes are located immediately
downstream of the element. Although the motif might
actually be transcribed in the opposite orientation, the
structure as shown is more stable because it carries

many G-U base pairs and GNRA tetraloops [48]. These
structures would be far less stable in the corresponding
RNA transcribed from the complementary DNA template. RNA molecules overlapping an L17 downstream
element were recently detected by microarrays and
designated SR79100 [51]. The expression of ribosomal
proteins is frequently regulated by a feedback mechanism in which the protein binds an RNA structure in the
5' UTR of its mRNA, called a ribosomal leader [52]. We
did not detect obvious similarity between the L17 downstream element and rRNA, although this situation is
typical of ribosomal leaders [53]. Thus, the L17 downstream element could function in the 3' UTR and be
part of a feedback-regulation system for L17 production.
Regulation of a gene by a structured RNA domain
located in the 3' UTR is highly unusual in bacteria.
However, precedents include an element in a ribosomal
protein operon that regulates both upstream and downstream genes [54], and regulation of upstream genes is
observed in a phage [55] and proposed in Listeria [56].
hopC motif

The hopC motif (Additional File 6) is found in Helicobacter species in the potential 5' UTRs of hopC/alpA
gene and co-transcribed hopB/alpB genes. Previous studies established that expression of the hopCB operon is
increased in response to low pH [57]. The

experimentally determined 5' UTRs of the hopCB
operon mRNA in H. pylori 60190 [57] contains a predicted hopC motif RNA. HopCB is needed for optimal
binding to human epithelial cells [58] and is presumably
involved in infection of the human stomach.
msiK motif

The msiK motif is always found in the potential 5' UTRs
of msiK genes [59,60], which encode the ATPase subunit for ABC-type transporters of at least two complex
sugars [61], and probably many more [62]. The motif
comprises an 11-nucleotide bulge within a long hairpin.
The 3' side of the basal pairing region includes a predicted ribosome binding site, which may be part of the
regulatory mechanism. Existing data indicate that msiK
genes are not regulated in response to changing levels
of glucose [59,61], so perhaps the RNA participates in a
feedback-inhibition loop by binding MsiK proteins
(Additional File 1).
pan motif

The pan motif (Additional File 6) is found in three
phyla and is present in the genetically tractable organism B. subtilis. Each pan RNA consists of a stem interrupted by two highly conserved bulged A residues. Most
pan RNAs occur in tandem, and their simple structure
and dimeric arrangement is suggestive of a dimeric protein-binding motif. The RNAs are located upstream of

Weinberg et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R31
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R31

operons containing panB, panC, or aspartate decarboxylase genes, which are involved in synthesizing pantothenate (vitamin B5).
rmf motif

The rmf motif is found in the potential 5' UTRs of rmf
genes in Pseudomonas species. These genes encode ribosome-modulation factor, which acts in the stringent
response to depletion of nutrients and other stressors
[63]. Because Rmf interacts with rRNA, the protein Rmf
might bind to the 5' UTR of its mRNA. Alternately,
because the RNA is relatively far from the rmf start
codon, rmf RNAs might be noncoding RNAs that are
expressed separate from the adjacent coding region.
SAM-Chlorobi motif

The SAM-Chlorobi motif is found in the potential 5'
UTRs of operons containing all predicted metK and
ahcY genes within the phylum Chlorobi. As noted earlier, metK encodes SAM synthetase, and in most other
organisms, metK homologues are controlled by changing
SAM concentrations that are detected by SAM-responsive riboswitches. In contrast, ahcY encodes S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, and this gene is known
to be controlled by SAH-responsive riboswitches in
some organisms [26]. Sequences conforming to a strong
promoter sequences [64,65] imply that SAM-Chlorobi
RNAs are transcribed (Additional File 1). However, preliminary analysis of several SAM-Chlorobi RNA constructs by using in-line probing did not reveal binding
to SAM or SAH (Additional File 1).
STAXI motif

The Ssbp, Topoisomerase, Antirestriction, XerDC Integrase (STAXI) motif is composed mainly of a pseudoknot structure repeated at least two and usually three
times (Figure 5). Tandem STAXI motifs are frequently
near to genes that encode proteins that bind or manipulate DNA, including single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (Ssbp), integrases and topoisomerases, or
antirestriction proteins. Also, they are occasionally
located near c4 antisense RNAs [66] (Additional File 1).
Because genes proximal to STAXI representatives
encode DNA-manipulation proteins, it is possible that
the STAXI motif represents a single-stranded DNA that
adopts a local structure when duplex DNA is separated,
as occurs during DNA replication, repair, or when
bound by some proteins. However, the UUCG tetraloops that frequently occur within the STAXI motif
repeats are known to stabilize RNA, whereas the corresponding TTCG are not particularly stabilizing for DNA
structures [67]. This suggests that the motif is more
likely to serve its function as an RNA structure.
Noncoding RNAs

Several motifs that are most likely expressed as noncoding RNAs unaffiliated with mRNAs also were identified
(Figure 5, Table 1). Gut-1 and whalefall-1 RNAs are

Page 10 of 17

found only in environmental sequences, and Bacteroides-2 is found in only one sequenced organism (Additional File 1). Thus, bacteria from multiple
environmental samples express noncoding RNAs that
are not represented in any cultivated organisms whose
genomes have been sequenced [68,21]. Similarly, Acido1 and Dictyoglomi-1 RNAs are found in phyla in which
few genome sequences are available. Further observations regarding all noncoding RNA candidates can be
found in Additional File 1.
Expansion of representatives of previously characterized
structured RNAs

Existing homology search methods for RNAs frequently
fail to detect representatives of known RNA classes
whose sequences have diverged extensively. However,
our computational pipeline occasionally reveals examples
of such RNAs. Details regarding RNA representatives
that expand the collection of 6S RNAs, AdoCbl riboswitches, SAM-II riboswitches, and SAM-I/SAM-IV
riboswitches are provided in Additional File 1. The RNAs
that expand the collection of the superfamily of SAM-I
[69] and SAM-IV [24] riboswitches (Additional File 6)
are typically found in metagenome sequences. These variant SAM-I/SAM-IV riboswitches share many of the
structural features of both families (Additional File 6),
but lack an internal loop in the P2 stem, which is present
in SAM-I/SAM-IV riboswitches (Additional File 1).

Conclusions
Numerous structured RNA candidates have been identified in the genomic and metagenomic DNA sequence data
from bacteria and archaea. The predicted RNAs exhibit a
great diversity of conserved sequences and structural features, and their genomic locations are indicative of a wide
variety of mechanisms of action (for example, cis vs. trans)
and putative biologic roles. Our findings suggest that the
bacterial and archaeal domains of life will continue to be a
rich source of novel structured RNAs.
Although some of the RNAs identified perform the
same function as previously validated RNA classes (for
example, 6S-Flavo RNA, SAM/SAH riboswitches), the
vast majority of the predicted RNA motifs are likely to
perform novel functions. Given that many of these
RNAs are specific to certain lineages or uncultivated
environmental samples, technologies that more rapidly
make available DNA sequence information from additional lineages of bacteria and archaea are likely to
accelerate the discovery of more classes of structured
RNAs. This discovery rate might also be increased by
improvements in computational analysis methods. These
findings should yield a diverse collection of structured
noncoding RNAs that will reveal a more complete
understanding of the roles that RNAs perform in microbial cells.

Materials and methods
DNA sequence sources and gene annotations

The microbial subsets of RefSeq [70] version 25 or 32
(Additional file 9) were searched, along with metagenome sequences from acid mine drainage [71], soil and
whale fall [72], human gut [73,74], mouse gut [75], gutless sea worms [76], sludge [77], Global Ocean Survey
scaffolds [78,79], other marine sequences [80], and termite hindgut [81]. Locations and identities of proteincoding genes were derived from RefSeq or IMG/M [82]
annotations, or from “predicted proteins” [83] in Global
Ocean Survey sequences. However, genes in some

sequences [74,80,81] were predicted by using MetaGene
(dated Oct. 12, 2006) with default parameters [84]. Conserved protein domains were annotated by using the
Conserved Domain Database version 2.08 [85].
Annotations for tRNAs and rRNAs were derived from
the sources noted earlier, or were predicted by using
tRNAscan-SE [86] run in bacterial mode. To detect
additional rRNAs, annotated rRNAs whose descriptions
read “ribosomal RNA” or “#S rRNA” (# represents any
number) were used in WU-BLAST queries with command-line flags -hspsepQmax = 4000 -E 1e-20 -W 8
[13]. Other RNAs were detected with Rfam [22] and

Weinberg et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R31
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R31

WU-BLAST, as described previously [13]. We also used
published alignments of riboswitches [87] as queries
with RAVENNA global-mode searches [19,20], selecting
hits manually based primarily on E-values.
Automated motif identification

To reduce false positives in sequence comparisons, the
pipeline was run separately on related taxa or metagenome sources (Additional File 9). For each run, InterGenic
Regions (IGRs) of at least 30 nucleotides were extracted
between protein-coding, tRNA and rRNA genes.
To generate clusters, an early version of a recently
described algorithm was used [16]. Specifically, IGRs were
compared by using nucleotide NCBI BLAST [17] version
2.2.17 and parameters -W 7 -G 2 -E 2 -q -2 -m 8. Selfmatches were ignored. BLAST scores below a parameter S
(see later) were considered insignificant and were ignored.
Each BLAST match defines two “nodes,” corresponding to
the matching sequences. Nodes that overlap by at least
five nucleotides are merged, along with their BLAST
homologies. A cluster consists of all nodes that have direct
or indirect (transitive) BLAST matches. Closely related
sequences that span multiple distinct elements in an entire
IGR can lead to spurious node merges. Therefore, homologies with BLAST scores >100 are ignored.
If a node’s length in nucleotides is L, and L < 500,
then the node is extended on either side by (500-L)/2
nucleotides, but is constrained to remain within the original IGR. CMfinder can easily tolerate nodes of 500
nucleotides. When L > 1,000, nodes are shrunk by (L 1,000)/2 nucleotides around the center. The L > 1,000
case is extremely rare. Only clusters with at least three
members were reported.
For each pipeline run, we tried a range of values for
the parameter S = 35, 40, ..., 85, and determined how
many known RNAs were detected with each value.
Based on these data, a set of S values was selected
manually, and the union of clusters arising from each S
was used as input to CMfinder [18]. CMfinder was used
to predict motifs exactly as before [13]. Automated
homology searches were then performed as described
[13], except that covariance model scores used the null3
model [88]. Motifs were scored by using a previously
established method [13], and by using tools comprising
Pfold [89] to infer a phylogenetic tree, and then running
pscore [90]. We also automatically eliminated motifs
that had no covarying base-pair positions, that had an
average G+C content <24%, that had representatives
whose nucleotide coordinates overlapped the reversecomplements of other representatives on average by
≥30% of their nucleotides, or that had fewer than six
positions that were ≥97% conserved (when sequences
were weighted with the GSC algorithm). Source code is
provided (Additional File 10).

Manual analysis of motifs

The manual analysis of each candidate RNA motif proceeded essentially as described previously [14]. For motifs
that were likely to be cis-regulatory, we routinely searched
for articles referencing the locus tags of apparently regulated genes, by using Google Scholar [91]. We also used
mutual information analysis [87] to predict additional
base-pairing interactions. Motifs less likely to represent
structured RNAs were rejected by using previously established criteria [14]. In motif consensus diagrams, covariation and levels of conservation were calculated using
earlier protocols [14], but ≤10% noncanonic pairs were tolerated in alignment columns that correspond to conserved
base pairs. RNAs were drawn with R2R (Z.W., R.R.B.,
unpublished software) and Adobe Illustrator.
Assessing the novelty of motifs

To determine whether the predicted RNA structures
were reported previously, we searched the Rfam database
[22], and various articles not yet incorporated into Rfam
that performed detailed analysis or experiments on newfound candidate RNAs [10,47,92-110]. Although some
raw predictions of a previous report [9] overlap some of
our RNA motifs (Additional File 11), these raw predictions have never been subjected to detailed evaluation.
Additionally, extensive Google searches [111] for genes
associated with crcB RNAs revealed that one of the 358
raw predictions of conserved elements on the RibEx web
server [112] overlaps several of the crcB RNAs we found.
This conserved element was called RLE0038 and was not
previously subjected to detailed evaluation. We have not
determined whether other coinciding predictions are present on this web server because its data are not available
in a machine-readable format.
In-line probing experiments

RNA constructs were prepared by in vitro RNA transcription by using T7 RNA polymerase and the appropriate
DNA templates that were created by overlap extension of
synthetic DNA oligonucleotides by using SuperScript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), as instructed by the
manufacturer. RNA transcripts were purified by using
denaturing (8 M urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE). RNAs were eluted from the gel, dephosphorylated by using alkaline phosphatase, and 5' radiolabeled
with [g-32P] by using methods reported previously [26]. 5'
32
P-labeled fragments resulting from in-line probing reactions were subjected to denaturing PAGE, and were
imaged and analyzed as previously described [26].
Equilibrium dialysis experiments

Equilibrium dialysis experiments were conducted in a
Dispo-Equilibrium Biodialyzer (The Nest Group, Inc.,
Southboro, MA, USA), which comprises two chambers

Weinberg et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R31
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/3/R31

(A and B) separated by a 5,000-kDa MW cut-off membrane. Chamber A was loaded with 20 μl solution of 500
nM 3H-SAM, and Chamber B was loaded with 20 μM specified RNA in a buffer containing 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.2
at 20°C), 20 mM MgCl2, and 500 mM KCl. The chambers
were equilibrated at 25°C for 10 h before a 3-μl aliquot
was removed from each chamber. Radioactivity of the aliquots was measured with a liquid scintillation counter.
Each experiment was repeated 3 times, and average B/A
values and standard deviations were calculated.
