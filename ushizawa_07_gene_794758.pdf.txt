Abstract
Background: This study reports the identification of a full-length cDNA sequence for two novel
caprine prolactin-related proteins (cPRP1 and cPRP6), and their localization and quantitative
expression in the placenta. Caprine PRPs are compared with known bovine PRPs. We examined
their evolution and role in the ruminant placenta.
Results: Full-length cPRP1 and cPRP6 cDNA were cloned with a 717- and 720- nucleotide openreading frame corresponding to proteins of 238 and 239 amino acids. The cPRP1 predicted amino
acid sequence shares a 72% homology with bovine PRP1 (bPRP1). The cPRP6 predicted amino acid
sequence shares a 74% homology with bovine PRP6 (bPRP6). The two cPRPs as well as bPRPs were
detected only in the placentome by RT-PCR. Analysis by in situ hybridization revealed the presence
of both cPRPs mRNA in the trophoblast binucleate cells. These mRNA were quantified by real-time
RT-PCR analysis of the placentome at 30, 50, 90 and 140 days of pregnancy. Both new cPRP genes
were able to translate a mature protein in a mammalian cell-expression system. Western blotting
established the molecular sizes of 33 kDa for cPRP1 with FLAG-tag and 45 kDa for cPRP6 with
FLAG-tag. The sequence properties and localized expression of cPRP1 and cPRP6 were similar to
those of bovine. However, their expression profiles differed from those in bovine placenta.
Although this study demonstrated possible roles of PRPs in caprine placenta, PRPs may regulate
binucleate-cell functions like those in bovine, but their crucial roles are still unclear.
Conclusion: We have identified the novel PRPs in caprine placenta. Localization and quantitative
expression of caprine PRPs were compared with bovine PRPs. The data indicate that PRP genes in
caprine placenta have coordination functions for gestation, as they do in bovine. This is the first
study of PRPs function in caprine placenta.

Background
In ruminant placenta, various kinds of functional molecules such as steroid hormones, peptides, and prostanoids
are expressed. These molecules contribute to a successful
pregnancy and to the establishment of placenta. It is
known that placental lactogen (PL) [1,2], pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) [3-5], and interferon-τ
(IFNT) [6-8] specifically appear in both caprine (goat)
and bovine trophoblast. Prolactin-related protein (PRP)
has been known as a placental-specific molecule that specifically expresses in trophoblastic binucleate cells in cattle. PRP is a gene of a non-classical member of the
prolactin (PRL)/growth hormone (GH) family [9,10]. At
least thirteen members are known to occur in cattle, and
their nucleotide sequences are significantly analogous to
PRL and PL in bovine species [11-13]. In rodents, diversity
of the PRL family has been reported as well as the fact that
they take on regulatory roles in pregnancy [14,15]. The
placental PRL families in mouse and rat may play similar
roles because of the evolutionary role of these genes in
establishing pregnancy [15]. In the ruminants, bovines
have some PRPs [12,13]; however there is no report on
this in caprine species. We investigated the PRPs mRNA in
caprine placenta. This paper introduces two novel types of
cPRP genes that emerged from the cloning of a complete
sequence of full-length cDNA and its expression. We
named these sequences caprine prolactin-related protein1 (cPRP1) and caprine prolactin-related protein-6
(cPRP6), based on their similarity to bovine PRPs.

Results
Sequences of cPRP1 and cPRP6 cDNA and deduced
amino acids
Sequences of 933 and 957 nucleotides were isolated from
caprine placentome and cloned as candidates of cPRP1
and cPRP6. The predicted protein sequence regions
(CDSs) were composed of 717 nucleotides in cPRP1 and
720 nucleotides in cPRP6. The amino acid sequences
deduced from full-length cPRP1 and cPRP6 cDNA are 238
and 239 amino acids (aa). The cPRP1 and cPRP6
sequences were submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan
(DDBJ), and the DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL accession numbers are AB231295 and AB231296. A homology search
can determine intermolecular similarity. It is also possible
to learn the stage of the molecular evolution with the
speed from the branching and distance in a phylogenetic
analysis. We analyzed the evolutionary interrelationships
using predicted amino acids (aa) sequences between the
cPRPs and bPRPs (Fig. 1). The cPRP6 aa sequence was
~74% homologous to bPRP6 (Fig. 2B), so it was named
cPRP6. In contrast, the sequence homology of cPRP1 is
closer to a cluster of bPRP1, bPRP2, bPRP4, bPRP9 and
bPRP12 (called the "bPRP1 cluster"). This aa sequence
was ~72% homologous to bPRP1, 61% homologous to
bPRP2, 72% homologous to bPRP4, 76% homologous to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/16

bPRP9, and 71% homologous to bPRP12 (Fig. 2A). The
predicted cPRP1 sequence was closest to bPRP9, but it was
located outside of the bPRP1 cluster according to the phylogenetic tree analysis. cPRP1 changed in the an earlier
stage which was earlier than the bPRP1 cluster when, the
amino acid evolution was decided from the phylogenetic
analysis. Therefore, this novel caprine sequence was
named cPRP1. The predicted 3D structures of cPRP1,
bPRP1, cPRP6 and bPRP6 mature regions are illustrated in
Fig. 3. The structural differences in the N-glycosylation
site, the disulfide bond (-S-S-), and each atomic configuration were confirmed.
Localized and quantitative mRNA expression
RT-PCR analysis confirmed cPRP1 and cPRP6 expression
in placenta such as bPRP1 and bPRP6 in bovine. No
amplification was found in other caprine tissue, i.e. heart,
liver, lung, kidney, spleen or endometrium (Fig. 4).

The mRNA localization was determined by in situ hybridization in the caprine or bovine placenta on day 50
(caprine) or 60 (bovine) of gestation (Fig. 5). Anti-sense
RNA probes specifically detected mRNA transcripts in the
placenta. All PRPs signals appeared in binucleate cells in
the cotyledonary villous (Figs. 5A, B, D, E, G and 5H). No
significant signals were detected with sense probes in any
genes (Figs. 5C, F and 5I).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the
cPRP1 and cPRP6 expression intensities increased from
Day 30 to Day 50 and then remained constant to Day 90
and thereafter decreased until Day 140 in placentome (the
cotyledonary and caruncular parts were not able to separate (PTM); see Fig. 6). In the caprine intercotyledon (the
area between the cotyledonary villous (ICOT)), the cPRP1
expression intensity held steady from Day 30 to Day 90
and thereafter decreased until Day 140, although the
intensity was low compared to that in PTM. The cPRP6
expression intensity increased from Day 30 to Day 50 and
thereafter decreased until Day 140 in PTM, but rather low
expressions were found in ICOT. The profile of cPRP1 was
weaker than bPRP1 through the pregnancy. Especially
bPRP1 intensively expressed in placentomal and interplacentomal tissues.
Translation of cPRP1 and cPRP6
Cloning sequences of cPRP1 and cPRP6 were effectively
translated in an HEK293 cell system, like bovine PRPs
(Fig. 7). Two different sizes of protein were translated of
~30 and 33 kDa with a FLAG-tag in cPRP1. Those translated-protein sizes were close to those in bPRP1 (Fig. 7A).
However, translated cPRP6 was larger than bPRP6, at ~45
kDa and 29 kDa. There was a difference of >15 kDa
between the bovine and caprine values. From the
sequence analysis, there were no differences between

them in predicted size (Fig. 7B). These PRPs were
migrated to ~26 kDa by N-deglycosylation treatment (Fig.
7).

Discussion
The diversity of the PRL gene family has been shown in
mouse, rat and cattle; however, there exists only limited
functional information except for PRL, PL and some
rodents PLPs [11,14-18]. In particular, ruminants commonly have various genes of this family, but there is no
information regarding goats, even though anatomical evidence shows a similarity to the placenta in ruminants. In
cattle, thirteen varieties of PRP paralogs have been
reported. In the present study, we identified novel PRPs in
caprine and compared the properties of goat and cattle.

Novel PRP1 and PRP6 genes were detected and cloned
from caprine placenta and their deduced amino acid
sequences were determined to have some specific properties. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that cPRP1 separated
from bovine PRP1 cluster in an early evolutionary stage
(Fig. 1). In contrast, cPRP6 and bPRP6 molecules were
phylogenetically adjacent (Fig. 1). This indicates that a
primitive PRP6 molecule existed before it evolved into
caprine and bovine.
The N-terminal regions of the bPRP1 and bPRP6 proteins
were rich in hydrophobic amino acid residues, which is
characteristic of the signal peptide [19,20]. The signal peptide sequence of cPRP1 and cPRP6, composed of 36
amino acids, is well conserved in bPRP1 and bPRP6. This

information suggests that the signal cleavage site
(between the Glu-36 and Arg-37) of cPRPs is the same as
that of bPRPs (Fig. 2).
The bPRP1 mature protein is predicted to have three S-S
bonds with six cysteines (Cys) at 39, 42, 97, 215, 232, and
238 (Figs. 2A, 3A, and 3B) [12,19]. The numbers and positions for these in the predicted cPRP1 exactly coincide
with those of bPRP1. The 3D structure of cPRP6 was also
similar to that of the mature bPRP6 protein (Fig. 3).
bPRP6 is predicted to have three S-S bonds with six
cysteines (Cys) in the sequence. However, cPRP6 mature
protein is predicted to have eight Cys, with six Cys in aa
positions at 39, 42, 43, 97, 174, and 215 corresponding
with those in bPRP6 and an extra two in positions 232
and 239 (Figs. 2B, 3C, and 3D) [12,20]. However, these
two last Cys were present in most other bPRPs, including
bPRP1 (Figs. 2 and 3). Therefore PRP6 may have a highly
homologous sequence in caprine and bovine, with a
slight difference in 3D structure.
cPRP1 has two consensus sequences for potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) at positions 70–72 and

92–94 (Figs. 2A and 3A), and an atypical N-glycosylation
site, Asn-X-Cys was found at position 95–97. Typically,
bPRP1 had three potential N-glycosylation sites at positions 70–72, 92–94 and 159–161 (Figs. 2A and 3B) [19].
So, the potential N-glycosylation sites are different in
bovine and caprine, but the number of sites is the same,
so they may translate a similar molecular size. This expectation was supported by the result of HEK 293 cell translation at 33 kDa (Fig. 7A).
cPRP6 had three consensus sequences for N-glycosylation
at positions 48 to 50, 60 to 62, and 70 to 72 (Figs. 2B and
3C) with the atypical N-glycosylation site (Asn-X-Cys) at
position 95–97 as in cPRP1. However, bovine PRP6 had
only one consensus sequence for a typical potential N-glycosylation, at position 60–62. (Figs. 2B and 3D) [12,20].
This is a unique N-glycosylation position in caprine and
bovine, which is not present in the cPRP1 and bPRP1 cluster genes (bPRP1, bPRP2, bPRP4, bPRP9 and bPRP12)
(Fig. 1). N-glycosylation positions of 92–94 were confirmed in all PRP aa sequences except for caprine and
bovine PRP6. In comparing the N-glycosylation sites in
cPRP6 and bPRP6, the caprine may have four sites and
bPRP, one site. Western blot analysis of an HEK293 cell
system showed that cPRP6 migrated to 45 kDa and bPRP6
migrated to 29 kDa (Fig. 7B). Both N-degrycosylated proteins were migrated to ~26 kDa (Fig. 7B). The difference
in the size of the proteins is related to the sugar-chain status.
Primary mRNA expression of cPRP1 and cPRP6 was
observed in trophoblast binucleate cells (Fig. 5), and
HEK293 cells translated these mRNA to each protein individually. Both cPRPs' mRNA were expressed in the extraembryonic membrane after the implantation period (Fig.
6). In the bovine, bPRP1 and bPRP6 expression were
found in the trophoblast binucleate cells (Fig. 5) and their
expressions were kept from the implantation to late pregnancy in the placentomal villi (Fig. 6). The trophoblast
binucleate cells are also primary expression cells for the
bPRPs [21-25] and may have specific roles for the implantation and placentation of the fetomaternal interface [2628]. The two caprine PRPs may also be related to implantation or placentation, like the bovine PRPs, since the
localization and stage of expression of both caprine PRP1
and PRP6 were similar to those of bovine PRPs. The functional roles may not coincide between cPRP1 and bPRP1
(or cPRP6 and bPRP6), since the PRP1 and PRP6 expression profiles are different from those for bovine (Fig. 6).
The bovine placental weight increases from the early to
late stage of gestation [29]. In contrast, small ruminant
placental weight increases to the middle stage of gestation
(Days 70 to 80) and decreases to the late stage of gestation
[30]. The change of the placental weight correlates with
the placentation. The bPRPs expression appears to relate to

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of (A) cPRP1 and bPRP1, (B) cPRP6 and bPRP6 mRNA in caprine or
bovine placenta. The total RNA of caprine was extracted from cotyledons containing extra-embryonic membrane (EEM),
placentome (PTM), and intercotyledonary fetal membrane (ICOT) on Day 30, Day 50, Day 90 and Day 140 of gestation. The
total RNA of bovine was extracted from cotyledons containing extra-embryonic membrane (EEM), cotyledonary placenta
(COT), and intercotyledonary fetal membrane (ICOT) on Day 27, Day 60, Day 150, and Day 250 of gestation. The expression
of these mRNAs was normalized to the expression of GAPDH measured in the corresponding RNA preparation. Values are
mean ± SD. Values with different letters are significantly different (P < 0.05).

the placentation in bovine ICOT. In contrast, the placentation decrease in the goat after the mid-pregnancy may be
related to the low cPRPs expression in the ICOT.
It is important to confirm the caprine PRPs in order to
understand the mechanism of implantation and placentation in small ruminant. Until now, the placental hormone
in a small ruminant has been considered without PRP
[31]. We suggest that PRP is also related to the placentalspecific endocrine activity in a small ruminant.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have found two PRPs in caprine placenta. These PRP sequences had a high homology with the
sequence of bovine PRPs. These PRPs were expressed in
trophoblast binucleate cells as are bovine PRPs. They
expressed from after the implantation period to late in
gestation. These genes could independently produce
mature recombinant proteins in a mammalian cellexpression system. We were able to specify the PRP genes,
which was alike between the ruminants. Finally, we suggest that the caprine may have many more PRPs, recalling
that thirteen PRPs or sixteen PLPs have been discovered in
bovine or rodents.

Methods
Animals and tissues
Caprine placental tissues intended for cDNA cloning and
mRNA expression were collected from Japanese Saanen
goats. Extra-embryonic tissues and placenta were collected
on days 26 to 30, 50 to 52, 86 to 92, and 135 to 139 after
artificial insemination or natural mating (designated as
day 1 of pregnancy). The tissues were obtained into two
portions; the PTM and ICOT. It was difficult to divide the
cotyledon (COT) and ICOT on days 26 to 30, and thus the
COT contained very few villi. Tissues from three different
goats on day 30 and one cow on day 26 of gestation (n =
4) were used as Day 30 extra-embryonic membrane (Day
30 EEM). Placentomal tissues were collected on days 50
(two samples), and 52 (two samples) (in total, n = 4) and
designated as Day 50 PTM and ICOT. Sample materials
from days 86 (one samples) and 92 (three sample) (in
total, n = 4) and days 135 (one sample) and 139 (one
samples) (in total, n = 2) were marked as Day 90 PTM,
ICOT, Day 140 PTM, and ICOT. The collected tissues were
stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. Some of the placentomes from day 50 were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde PBS
(pH 7.4), embedded in paraffin wax and stored at 4°C for
in situ hybridization. Details of bovine placental-tissue
collection have been provided in previous reports [21,22].
All procedures for these animal experiments were carried
out in accordance with guidelines and ethical standards
approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Laboratory Animals for Biomedical Research of the Graduate
School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/16

National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences for the use of
animals.
Cloning of full-length cPRP1 and cPRP6 cDNA
The new full-length cPRP1 and cPRP6 cDNA was isolated
from caprine cotyledonary tissue by the 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. In brief, a complete
RNA was isolated from a caprine placentome from day 50
of gestation using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Toyama,
Japan). We performed 3'-RACE using a 3'-full RACE core
set (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with a cPRP1-specific forward
primer (5'-CCACAGTCAACAGGAGTCCTC-3') and a
cPRP6-specific forward primer (5'-CCAACAGAGAGTCCTCACCCTGCGA-3'). Both cPRP primers were designed
from a bovine PRP sequence. The 3'-RACE products were
sequenced using an ABI Prism 370 automatic sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) after cloning
in a pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Phylogenetic analysis
The deduced cPRP1 and cPRP6 protein sequences were
aligned with bPRPs using the multiple-alignment software Clustal W 1.83 found on the DDBJ web site. Clustal
W was also employed to calculate trees using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [32]. TreeView was used to display the phylogenetic tree [33,34]. The values represent
bootstrap scores for 1,000 trials, indicating the credibility
of each branch. Except for the cPRP1 and cPRP6
sequences, the bPRPs and bPL protein sequences were
obtained from GenBank. Their GenBank accession numbers are: bPRP1 (J02944), bPRP2 (M27239), bPRP3
(M27240), bPRP4 (M33269), bPRP5 (X15975), bPRP6
(AB245482), bPRP7 (AB187564), bPRP8 (AB196438),
bPRP9 (AB204881), bPRP10 (AB255602), bPRP11
(BK005438), bPRP12 (BK005439), bPRP13 (BK005440),
bPL-Val
(M33268),
bPRL
bPL-Ala
(J02840),
(NM_173953) and cPRL (X76049). The cPL sequence was
obtained from Sakal et al. [1].
Three-dimensional structure prediction by FAMS
We predicted the three-dimensional (3D) structure of
cPRP1, bPRP1, cPRP6 and bPRP6 using the FAMS (Fully
Automated Homology Modeling System) [35,36]. FAMS
is a software program that predicts 3D models for target
proteins based on the structure of known proteins of high
homology. For cPRP1, bPRP1, cPRP6 and bPRP6, the 3D
structure was constructed based on the human prolactin
(hPRL) 3D structure (Protein Data Bank ID: 1N9D). The
FAMS program requires only an amino-acid sequence as
input, and constructs 3D model structures automatically.
Visualization of the 3D structure was performed using
RasMol 2.7.3 software [37,38].

RT-PCR
The tissue distribution of cPRP1, cPRP6, bPRP1, and
bPRP6 expression was studied using RT-PCR. Caprine or
bovine GAPDH was used as a positive control for the PCR.
Details of the RT-PCR method have been described in previous reports [21,22]. The total RNA in a total reaction
mixture was used for reverse transcription and template
cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primer and Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at
50°C for 50 min. Each PCR contained a cDNA template,
primers, deoxynucleotide triphosphate mixture (dNTP),
MgCl2, 10 × PCR buffer II, autoclaved milliQ water, and
AmpliTaq gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems).
Amplification conditions included denaturation at 95°C
for 30 sec and extension at 72°C for 1 min. Twenty six
cycles were performed for all samples. The annealing temperature was set at 60°C for 30 sec. A single denaturation
step at 95°C for 10 min before the first PCR cycle and a
final extension step at 72°C for 10 min after the last PCR
cycle were also performed. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis and visualized by
ethidium bromide staining. The primers encoding for the
cPRP1, cPRP6, bPRP1, and bPRP6 sequences were
designed using our obtained sequences (caprine) and
GenBank accession No. J02944 and AB245482 (bovine).
The designated primers are listed in Table 1. All the primers were commercially synthesized (Tsukuba Oligo Service, Tsukuba, Japan).
In situ hybridization
The full-length cDNA of cPRP1, cPRP6, bPRP1, and bPRP6
was used as a template for hybridization-probe synthesis.
Complementary digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense and
sense RNA probes were prepared as described in previous
studies [21,22]. The Day 50 caprine and Day 60 bovine
placentomes were sectioned into 7 μm-thick sections for
hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed using
the automated Ventana HX System Discovery with a
RiboMapKit and BlueMapKit (Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/7/16

[21,22]. Briefly, caprine and bovine sections were hybridized with DIG-labeled probes in a RiboHybe (Ventana)
hybridization solution at 60°C (cPRP1), 63°C (cPRP6),
65°C (bPRP1), or 67°C (bPRP6), for 6 h. The sections
were washed three times in RiboWash (Ventana) (at
60°C, 63°C, 65°C, or 67°C, for 6 min) after hybridization and were fixed in RiboFix (Ventana) (at 37°C, for 10
min). The hybridization signals were detected with monoclonal-anti-digoxin biotin conjugate (Sigma, Saint Louis,
MI, USA) and the biotin localized with the alkaline phosphatase system. The hybridized glasses were observed
after preparation with a Leica DMRE HC microscope
(Leica microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a Fujix digital camera HC2500 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).
Real-time RT-PCR
Gene expression of cPRP1, cPRP6, bPRP1, and bPRP6 was
confirmed quantitatively at each stage of gestation by realtime RT-PCR analysis using the SYBR Green assay. Fifty ng
of the total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA for 30
min at 48°C by MultiScribe™ reverse transcriptase with a
random primer, dNTP mixture, MgCl2 and RNase inhibitor. In the SYBR Green assay, primer pairs were designed
using the Primer Express 1.0 software program (Applied
Biosystems). The primers for each gene are listed in Table
2. Thermal-cycling conditions included initial-sample
incubation at 50°C for 2 min and at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and at 60°C for 1
min. The cycle-threshold values (CT) indicate the quantity
of the target gene in each sample and were determined in
real time using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector
(Applied Biosystems). The relative difference in the initial
amount of each mRNA species (or cDNA) was determined
by comparing the CT values. The standard curves for each
gene were generated by serial dilution of plasmid containing cPRP1, cPRP6, cGAPDH, bPRP1, bPRP6, or bGAPDH
cDNA to quantify the mRNA concentrations. The ratios of
cPRP1/cGAPGH, cPRP6/cGAPGH, bPRP1/bGAPGH and
bPRP6/bGAPGH mRNA were calculated to adjust for any

as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using
one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiplecomparison test. Differences were considered significant
at P < 0.05.
Production and purification of recombinant proteins
The cPRP1, cPRP6, bPRP1, and bPRP6 sequences encoding
the mature-protein region, which combined the FLAG
and 6 × His epitope tag sequences, were inserted into the
pFLAG-CMV-3 vector (Sigma). The constructed plasmid
was transfected into HEK 293 cells using FuGENE 6
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) for transient
transfection. Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were
adapted to the suspension culture in a spinner flask using
293 SFM II medium (Invitrogen, Gibco) and cultured in
an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37°C for 3 days. The
medium was separated by centrifugation.

Recombinant FLAG-tag and 6 × His-tag fusion proteins
were purified using the 6 × His-tag portion. Approximately 1 liter of conditioned medium was processed at a
time. A medium to which 1 ml Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow
(Amersham Bioscience, Buckinghamshire, UK) was added
was mixed and equilibrated with a 20 mM sodium-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl and 20
mM imidazole. Only the 6 × His-tag proteins bind to the
Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow carrier. The medium with carrier
was chromatographed on a PD-10 column (Amersham
Bioscience). The fractions with carrier were washed in the
20 mM imidazole. The fractions were eluted by 250 mM
imidazole. We also examined the cutting of the carbohydrate chain modified for the proteins using N-Glycosidase
F Deglycosylation kit (Roche).

ern blotting was performed using the method of Towbin
et al. [40]. Briefly, the membrane was blocked in 10%
skimmed milk overnight and incubated with mouse antiFLAG M2 (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed
by incubation with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) (diluted 1:3000) for 1 h at
room temperature. Immunopositive bands were stained
using NBT (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and BCIP (BioRad).
