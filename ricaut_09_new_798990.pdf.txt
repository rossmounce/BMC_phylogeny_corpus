Abstract
Background: Current models propose that mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroups M and N
evolved from haplogroup L3 soon after modern humans left Africa. Increasingly, however, analysis
of isolated populations is filling in the details of, and in some cases challenging, aspects of this general
model.
Results: Here, we present the first comprehensive study of three such isolated populations from
Madagascar: the Mikea hunter-gatherers, the neighbouring Vezo fishermen, and the Merina central
highlanders (n = 266). Complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequences reveal several unresolved
lineages, and a new, deep branch of the out-of-Africa founder clade M has been identified. This new
haplogroup, M23, has a limited global distribution, and is restricted to Madagascar and a limited
range of African and Southwest Asian groups.
Conclusions: The geographic distribution, phylogenetic placement and molecular age of M23
suggest that the colonization of Madagascar was more complex than previously thought.

Background
The dominant and widely accepted model of modern
human origins proposes that our species originated in
Africa ~150,000 years ago (kyr), and after environmental
and/or cultural changes, emerged into Eurasia ~85-55 kyr

along the Indian Ocean coast toward Australasia (i.e., the
Southern Dispersal Route). In terms of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) patterns, this dispersal apparently
occurred relatively soon after the appearance of macrohaplogroup L3 in Africa (~85 kyr). The two non-African

lineages (macrohaplogroups M and N) diverged shortly
afterwards, either just after modern humans left Africa [16], or perhaps within Africa slightly earlier, as suggested
by an ongoing debate surrounding the early geographical
origin of macrohaplogroup M [7-12]. However, beyond
this broad-scale view, the settlement patterns of many
individual regions are still poorly understood, although
some of them are key areas for investigating our species'
recent history - either because of their location (e.g.,
remote and/or close to major dispersal routes), or because
they contain isolated or relict populations (e.g., Australia,
India, Indonesia). This is the case for Madagascar. The
favoured settlement model suggests that the first human
groups to reach the island did so extremely recently,
around 1.5-2 kyr, when there is clear archaeological evidence of human occupation [13,14]. Furthermore, the
genetic, cultural, and linguistic characteristics of the Malagasy indicate that people from both Africa, and Island
Southeast Asia played a major role in the colonization of
the island, ultimately resulting in a population genetically
and linguistically admixed from African and Southeast
Asian sources [15-20]. Still, major issues remain unresolved regarding the origin and relative contributions of
each founder population to the extant Malagasy gene
pool.

called Malagasy, which is most closely related to a language spoken in the Barito River basin of Southeast Borneo, Indonesia [18,19,22]. Malagasy contains a number
of loan words of African Bantu origin, but these have
apparently been borrowed from the Swahili/Sabaki group
of languages, and thus form part of the cultural exchange
that took place during more recent Indian Ocean trade
[22,27]. However, oral tribal traditions suggest the earlier
presence of a people called Vazimba, who spoke a nonMalagasy language. Pockets of people still known as Vazimba exist among the island's fishermen, and their nonMalagasy lexicon has also been argued to be of Bantu origin [23,26]. Furthermore, two groups of hunter-gatherers
still live on the island - the Beosy and the Mikea, who
inhabit the forests of Southwestern Madagascar, and who
were recognised as having African affinity as early as the
16th century [24,26].
This paper presents the first comprehensive study of the
mtDNA diversity of three Malagasy speaking groups, the
Mikea hunter-gatherers, the neighbouring Vezo fishermen, and the Merina central highlanders, and reveals new
details regarding the early period of Madagascar's complex
history.

Results and Discussion
The earliest archaeological evidence on the island is controversial. Hippopotamus bones with cut-marks and evidence of human processing from iron tools have been
found in the Mikea Forest, in Madagascar's Southwest,
dating to ~2 kyr [21]. Later archaeological sites, now containing pottery, have been variously dated from the 4th to
the 8th centuries AD. Therefore, the island seems to have
been visited at least intermittently by Africans prior to the
arrival of Austronesian-speaking maritime travellers from
Island Southeast Asia sometime around the 7th or 8th centuries AD [18,19,22-25]. This settlement pattern is further
supported by dated faunal extinctions, as well as palaeoenvironmental evidence of deforestation indicated by
a decrease in tree pollen and an increase in small charcoal
pieces in soil sediments [14,24,26].
The ethnographic evidence is equally complex. All Malagasy today speak a Malayo-Polynesian language, also

Analysis of mtDNA from 266 Malagasy individuals (Table
1) is broadly consistent with previous genetic studies [1517,20]. We see a combination of Southeast Asian and African lineages that are likely to trace back to the initial settlement of the island around the 7th century AD. However,
our results based on complete mitochondrial genomes
also revealed the presence of five novel mtDNA lineages
that cluster into a previously uncharacterized clade whose
geographic distribution seems to be restricted to the
island of Madagascar (Additional files 1 and 2). The age
estimates for this clade and its main sub-branches are
shown in Table 2.
Of the five novel lineages one was found among the
Mikea hunter-gatherers (at a frequency <1%) and four
among the Vezo fishermen (at a frequency of ~4%) (table
1, highlighted). Comparative phylogenetic analysis of
worldwide mtDNA genomes confirmed the clustering of

these five lineages into a deep-rooted branch within macrohaplogroup M, which we name M23. This new branch
carries all the diagnostic polymorphisms of macrohaplogroup M as well as a substantial series of mutations that
separates it from the root of macrohaplogroup M (Figure
1). Haplogroup M23 is characterized by 11 coding region
mutations (viz. 2706-8360-9438-9545-10142-1029511569-11899-12279-12618-15025) and 8 control region
mutations (viz. 152-195-204-417-533-16263-1631116519) (Figure 1). The absence of a polymorphism at
2706 in the five M23 carriers indicates a back mutation,
and we consider this position another basal polymorphism of haplogroup M23. Haplogroup M23 splits into
two branches, M23a and M23b. The former is represented
by one individual from the Vezo group whilst the latter,
defined by a substitution at np 8188 encompasses all the
remaining Vezo lineages and is also present in the Mikea.
So far we found no convincing association of M23 with
any known M branches. None of the diagnostic coding
region mutations of M23 overlaps with the diagnostic
markers in other M haplogroups that emerge directly from
the root of macrohaplogroup M (see van Oven and Kayser
[28]). While some control region mutations (152, 195,
16311, 16263 and 16519) are shared by other deeprooted M haplogroups (e.g., M1, M28, M29 and M46),
these positions are known to be recurrent and cannot be
safely considered as linking M23 to other haplogroups
within macrohaplogroup M. This confirms the robustness
of our phylogenetic reconstruction, and the basal position
of M23 within M.
More detailed examination of the phylogeny, geographic
distribution, and molecular dating of the M23 lineage
reveals three further key points:
(1) As noted before, the position of M23 at the root of
macrohaplogroup M indicates that M23 is a deep branch

of the human mtDNA phylogeny. The length of the M23
branch suggests either strong genetic drift effects or that
this cluster may encompass further branches yet to be
identified. Indeed, a relatively small proportion of
mtDNA variation has been surveyed in the putative areas
of origin of M23. Therefore more extensive sampling is
needed to refine the overall geographic distribution and
branching structure of this clade, However, the fact that
this clade has no specific link to other known branches
within macrohaplogroup M suggests a deep-rooted ancestry, possibly tracing back to the Out of Africa event. Such
a deep root is also shared with many other lineages that
emerged independently from the root of macrohaplogroup M. These lineages are especially prevalent in South
Asia [2,29-31]. This general pattern has been interpreted
as supporting the view of a rapid dispersal of modern
humans at the time of the out-of-Africa exodus, followed
by a long period of isolation resulting in non-overlapping
distributions of derived M haplogroups in relict or isolated populations/regions along the dispersal route. Thus,
our results suggest that the Mikea hunter-gatherers and
Vezo fishermen of Madagascar descend, if only in very
small part (≤4%), from one such deep-rooted, isolated
population.
(2) M23 lineages have an extremely restricted geographic
distribution. A survey of all complete mtDNA sequences
reported in the literature (>6,700 sequences; http://
www.phylotree.org/) could not detect M23 sequences
anywhere outside Madagascar. Moreover, the screening of
control region polymorphisms that are diagnostic for
M23 against a larger global panel of mtDNA control
region variants confirmed that the M23 control region
motif is indeed rare, as only four individuals shared the 13
control region diagnostic mutations for M23 (Additional
file 1). Although comparative analysis based only on the
first hypervariable sequence (HVS1) reveals a few more
individuals that share the four HVS1 mutations of M23

(16223, 16263, 16311 and 16519), these nucleotide positions are known to be fast-mutating and recurrent, and
consequently cannot be considered diagnostic of haplogroup M23 (Additional files 1, 2 and 3). Interestingly,
three of the four individuals sharing the 13 control region
mutations for M23 are African Americans who are likely
to trace their ancestry to sub-Saharan Africans, although
no M23 carriers have been detected on mainland Africa
itself (Additional files 2 and 3). The fourth individual is
from the Arabian Peninsula (Dubai, United Arab Emirates), a region placed in Southwest Asia which has a long
history of interactions with Africa, probably dating back
to the dispersal of modern human along the southern dispersal route [3,4,6]. The modern population of Dubai has
a genetic composition strongly influenced by femalemediated gene flow from sub-Saharan Africa, as well as
migration from South Asian populations [32], which have
the highest observed levels of basal M lineages
[2,29,31,33]. Although we have only detected four individuals potentially affiliated to M23, they are likely to
descend from an African and/or Southwest Asian source,
again placing the origin of M23 somewhere between these
two regions. Unfortunately, lacking genealogical records
for these four individuals, we cannot confirm their maternal African origin, and without additional mtDNA coding
region information, the link with African populations
remains highly speculative. However, if confirmed, this
finding would suggest that the origin and dispersal of
M23 lineages is restricted to the circum-Arabia/northwestern Indian Ocean regions.
(3) Despite the limitations of molecular dating [34], the
estimated founder age of macrohaplogroup M using the
M23 branch considered alone is 62-73 kyr (95% confidence interval, 44-94 kyr) (Table 2). This conforms to the
revised age estimate of macrohaplogroup M [35], and is
slightly older than the proposed date for the dispersal of
anatomically modern humans from Africa, as well as the
population expansion accompanying it [2-4,33,36]. The
time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of
M23 has been estimated at 9.4 kyr (95% confidence interval: 1.9-17 kyr) using a recently improved control region
mutation rate [35] (Table 2), in broad agreement with
dates obtained using previous coding region mutation
rates (Table 2). Considering that a demographic expansion may predate a geographic one, it is worth noting that
the lower age estimates of M23, and especially of its subclade M23b, fall clearly within the Holocene (1.7-3.9 kyr;
95% confidence interval, 0-8.2 kyr). Although this is
broadly consistent with a late Holocene date for the initial
settlement of Madagascar [14,18,19,21-25] and the concomitant demographic/geographic expansions, the large
confidence intervals add uncertainty to the dispersal date
of M23 and leave open the possibility that this rare lineage
may represent an early pre-Austronesian expansion into
Madagascar.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/605

The presence of the M23 clade among the Malagasy Vezo
fishermen and Mikea hunter-gatherers provides additional mtDNA evidence upon which a better picture of the
colonization of Madagascar can be built. However, open
questions remain, including the geographic origin of
M23, and the time and mode of its spread into Madagascar. These outstanding issues can only be partially investigated with the currently available data. The M23 lineage is
not present in any of the putative parental populations of
the Malagasy (Africans and Island Southeast Asians), suggesting either its absence from these populations, or that
it is so exceedingly rare there that it has not yet been
detected [17,37-40] (Additional files 1 and 2). Indeed, relative to their genetic diversity, Africans and Southeast
Asians have not been widely sampled, although Borneo
(the likely source of the Austroensian expansion into
Madagascar) has been relatively well surveyed, and a high
number of published mtDNA sequences (n = 157) is currently available from this area [38]. Nonetheless, M23 lineages have not been identified in this region. Even if M23
is as rare in Borneo as it is in Madagascar (1.9%), the
probability of it being detected there is high: P(M23 | n,
freq) = 0.95. However, the extreme population structure
of Indonesia [41] may mean that M23 is restricted to populations that have not yet been sufficiently sampled, or at
all.
An alternative hypothesis is that the M23 motif developed
in situ in Madagascar, either completely or partially. If this
is the case, a pre-M23 lineage should have evolved more
or less in isolation within the founder population that
later participated in the colonization of Madagascar.
The identification of four individuals of African and
Southwest Asian origin who share the 13 diagnostic control region mutations for M23 pinpoints these regions as
potential sources for M23. Whilst, the data does not allow
us to make clear phylogeographic inferences regarding
M23 origin, our results may provide some evidence of
ancient contacts across the Indian Ocean involving Africa,
Madagascar and South Asia. The deep-rooted topology of
M23 and its age estimate coupled with its very restricted
distribution within Madagascar, makes unlikely its presence in the island as a result of recent contacts, and is
more in agreement with the patterns of human contacts
across the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, which predated the Austronesian expansion into Madagascar
[24,27].
Whilst more extensive screening of the putative parental
populations in Africa and South Asia will help to ascertain
the geographic origin and distribution of M23, our initial
examination of Malagasy mtDNA diversity suggests that
the origin of M23 lineages may be found in the circumArabia/northwestern Indian Ocean regions and that their
arrival to Madagascar may pre-date the Austronesian setPage 5 of 9

tlement of the island. This lends support to oral tribal traditions stressing the earlier presence of non-Malagasy
speakers (e.g. Vazimba; [23,24,26]) and re-emphasizes
the importance and complexity of the circum-Arabia and
Indian Ocean corridor since the late Pleistocene.

Conclusion
The finding of a new deep branch of the out-of-Africa
founder M, named as M23, in fishermen and hunter-gatherers from Southwestern Madagascar raises many questions regarding both the clade's origin and its role in the
settlement of Madagascar. Extant data cannot provide
unequivocal evidence for the origin of M23, although the
current distribution of macrohaplogroup M points to
Southeast Asia as the most likely source region. Additional
archaeological surveys, population sampling from South
Asia and East Africa/Madagascar, and further phylogeographic analyses are necessary to ascertain the exact time
and place of origin of this clade, as well as its geographic
dispersal. However, this novel mtDNA branch already
provides a new suite of diagnostic markers to expand the
search for its geographical and temporal origin.

Methods
Population samples
The samples analyzed in this study were taken from our
Malagasy assemblage, which was collected in field seasons
2007-2008. The samples were obtained with informed
consent, and were approved by Human Subjects' Ethics
Committees in Madagascar, and at the University of Toulouse, France. Buccal cells and peripheral blood were sampled from unrelated individuals, and stored in EDTA
Vaccutainer tubes. Subjects were surveyed for language
affiliation, current residence, familial birthplaces, and a
short genealogy of four generations to establish regional
ancestry. A total of 266 DNA samples were analyzed from
three ethnic groups: 127 Mikea (hunter-gatherers located
in the Southwest), 101 Vezo (semi-nomadic fishermen
also located in the Southwest), and 38 Merina (highlanders from central Madagascar).
DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
DNA was extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform
method, ethanol precipitated, and stored in Tris EDTA at
-20°C until further use. Analysis proceeded in three
phases.

First, we amplified and sequenced hypervariable segments
1 and 2 (HVS1 and HVS2) of the mitochondrial DNA control region using primers: L15973 (5'-AACTCCACCATTAGCACCCA-3'),
and
H296
(5'TCTGTAGTATTGTTTTTTAAAGG-3').
Samples
were
sequenced by the Genopole Toulouse Sequencing Service
http://www.genotoul.fr/ on an ABI PRISM 3730 Genetic
Analyzer. Sequences were edited and aligned against the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/605

revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) [42] using
BioEdit 7.0.9 [43]. Deviations from the rCRS were confirmed by checking electropherograms manually.
Second, for samples not definitively assigned to a known
haplogroup from HVS1 and HVS2 sequence variation
alone, we screened for mutations defining macrohaplogroups L3 (-10871 MnlII), M (+10397 AluI; +10394 DdeI),
and N (-10397 AluI; -10394 DdeI). Then, depending on
the presence or absence of these sites, additional RFLPs
were surveyed to identify other haplogroups common in
Southeast Asia: E (-7598 HhaI); E1 (+10834 MseI); D (5176 AluI); M7 (+9820 HinfI); M7c3 (+3606 Sau96 I);
M7c1 (+ 3882 BsaI), all within macrohaplogroup M; and
F (+10306 BspmI); F3 (+10319 Tsp509 I) and B4a1a
(+6719 NlaIII), all within macrohaplogroup N. To confirm affiliation of samples to haplogroup B, the 9-base
pair intergenic region V deletion [44] was amplified using
primers L8196 and H8297 [45].,
Third, 5 representative samples from the 17 samples
remaining with uncertain phylogenetic status (i.e., that
could not be assigned to currently recognized haplogroups) were selected for complete mtDNA sequencing by
the Genomic Analysis Technology Core (GATC) at the
University of Arizona http://uagc.arl.arizona.edu/ . The 12
remaining samples were not completely sequenced, and
consequently we do not know whether they belong to
M23. Using twenty-eight pairs of primers, overlapping
fragments of forward and reverse DNA strands were
amplified and sequenced. Sequences were edited and
aligned as described above. The five complete mtDNA
sequences have been deposited in the GenBank database
(Accession Numbers: FJ543101-FJ543105).
We utilized strict quality control to avoid errors and artefacts (e.g., base shift, reference bias, phantom mutations,
errors in base scoring, and artifactual recombination) as
proposed by Bandelt et al. [46]: (i) each base pair was
determined with both forward and reverse primers ensuring overlapping sequencing of both strands; (ii) we
rechecked all sequence variations by manual observation
of sequence electropherograms; (iii) as well as checking
for any incongruence with results obtained from PCR.
Moreover, we checked that all sequence variations
observed have previously been reported http://
www.mitomap.org/, and that haplogroup and sub-haplogroup motifs were fully represented.
Statistical analysis
Geographic distribution
To estimate the geographic distribution of M23 lineages,
we compared the five Malagasy M23 complete mtDNA
sequences with more than 6,700 complete mtDNA
sequences compiled by van Oven and Kayser http://

www.phylotree.org/; [28]), a dataset that contains all of
the complete mtDNA genomes available to date. However, as whole genome sequences are rare for some regions
and populations, especially those known to have high
genetic diversity (e.g., Eastern Africa, Southern India,
Indonesia), we also performed a comparative analysis
using partial or entire mtDNA control region sequences.
(Note that we discarded indels at position 309, 315, 573,
and 16193). This comparison was made by screening an
in-house database of 43,849 HVS1 sequences collated
from the literature, as well as several web-based mtDNA
databases: (1) DDBJ/EMBL/GENBANK international
nucleotide sequence database; (2) mtDNAmanager http:/
/mtmanager.yonsei.ac.kr/[47]; (3) The EMPOP database
http://www.empop.org/; [48]); (4) the Genographic
Project Open Resource Mitochondrial DNA database [49];
and (5) HvrBase++ http://www.hvrbase.org; [50]. This
comparative analysis allowed us to survey most of the
HVS sequences published thus far. However, although
providing larger numbers of samples for analysis, this
comparison is limited by higher rates of homoplasy and
back mutation in the mtDNA hypervariable sequences
compared to coding regions. This can lead to evolutionary
convergence, and therefore confound unrelated
sequences that are "identical by state" (IBS) as opposed to
"identical by descendent" (IBD) [49].
Phylogeny reconstruction
Sequence classification into mtDNA haplogroups was
based on accepted nomenclature (e.g., [1,9,2931,36,37,40,51-53]; http://www.phylotree.org/; http://
mtmanager.yonsei.ac.kr/). The phylogenetic tree was
reconstructed from median-joining networks rooted to L3
using Network 4.2.0.1 http://www.fluxus-engineer
ing.com/[54]. The tree was checked manually to resolve
homoplasies.
Molecular dating
TMRCA estimates were calculated using the rho (ρ) statistic and its standard deviation (SD) [55] with three previously described mutation rates based on coding region
mutations. Two mutation rates were calculated using estimated substitution rates; one of 3.5 × 10-8 mutations/site/
year for protein-coding synonymous changes, which
yields 6,764 years per synonymous transition [36], and
another of one synonymous mutation (including transitions and transversions) every 7,884 years from the
recently improved mitochondrial molecular clock published by Soares and colleagues [35]. Data from the MAMMAG website http://mammag.web.uci.edu/bin/view/
Main/WebHome was used to identify synonymous transitions. The third mutation rate was based on substitution
changes for the entire coding region (1.26 × 10-8 mutation/site/year), which is equivalent to 5,139 years per
mutation [56] between positions 577 and 16023 of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/605

rCRS [42]. All three rates were calibrated by comparison to
chimpanzee sequences using a divergence time between
human and chimpanzee mtDNAs of 6.5 million years.
Dates estimated from synonymous changes are likely to
be more robust, as these changes are mostly selectively
neutral [36]. It is worth noting that due to the ongoing
debate regarding the true mutation rate [36,57], and the
limitations of the rho (ρ) statistic method of molecular
dating [34], the conversion of age estimates in mutations
into ages in years and the estimation of associated error
values are to be considered approximations only. These
dates should be interpreted cautiously.
