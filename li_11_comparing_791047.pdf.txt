Abstract
Background: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) are two major etiological agents of Hand, Foot
and Mouth Disease (HFMD). EV71 is associated with severe cases but not CA16. The mechanisms contributed to
the different pathogenesis of these two viruses are unknown. VP1 and VP4 are two major structural proteins of
these viruses, and should be paid close attention to.
Results: The sequences of vp1s from 14 EV71 and 14 CA16, and vp4s from 10 EV71 and 1 CA16 isolated in this
study during 2007 to 2009 HFMD seasons were analyzed together with the corresponding sequences available in
GenBank using DNAStar and MEGA 4.0. Phylogenetic analysis of complete vp1s or vp4s showed that EV71 isolated
in Beijing belonged to C4 and CA16 belonged to lineage B2 (lineage C). VP1s and VP4s from 4 strains of viruses
expressed in E. coli BL21 cells were used to detect IgM and IgG in human sera by Western Blot. The detection of
IgM against VP1s of EV71 and CA16 showed consistent results with current infection, while none of the sera were
positive against VP4s of EV71 and CA16. There was significant difference in the positive rates between EV71 VP1
and CA16 VP1 (c2 = 5.02, P < 0.05) as well as EV71 VP4 and CA16 VP4 (c2 = 15.30, P < 0.01) in the detection of
IgG against recombinant proteins with same batch of serum samples. The sera-positive rate of IgG against VP1 was
higher than that against VP4 for both EV71 (c2 = 26.47, P < 0.01) and CA16 (c2 = 16.78, P < 0.01), which might be
because of different positions of VP1 and VP4 in the capsid of the viruses.
Conclusions: EV71 and CA16 were highly diverse in the nucleotide sequences of vp1s and vp4s. The sera positive
rates of VP1 and VP4 of EV71 were lower than those of CA16 respectively, which suggested a less exposure rate to
EV71 than CA16 in Beijing population. Human serum antibodies detected by Western blot using VP1s and VP4s as
antigen indicated that the immunological reaction to VP1 and VP4 of both EV71 and CA16 was different.

Background
Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a mild
exanthematous and febrile disease, which often poses a
persistent global public health problem. In recent years,
outbreaks of HFMD have been reported from many
parts of the world such as Malaysia [1,2], Taiwan [3-6],
Singapore [7], Mainland China [8], Brunei [9], Western
Australia [10], the Unites States [11] and Germany [12].

The two major etiological agents for HFMD are Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), which
belong to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae
family [13] and usually co-circulate during HFMD outbreaks [4,14,15]. In addition to HFMD, EV71 is also
associated with herpangina, myocarditis, encephalitis,
aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and pulmonary oedema or haemorrhage. EV71 usually infects children, while sometimes it can infect adults by intrafamilial transmission [16,17]. Generally, children and
adults infected present different symptoms. Data from a
recent study indicated that 21% of EV71-infected children experienced severe complications including central

nervous system (CNS) complications and cardiopulmonary failure. By contrast, 53% of infected adults were
asymptomatic, and all symptomatic adults recovered
completely from uncomplicated illness [16]. However,
there were several reports about adults infected with
severe complications. It was reported that in November
2006, a 37-year-old woman suffered from acute encephalitis due to intra-familial transmission of EV71 [17].
In 2000 a 19-year-old man even died from EV71 encephalitis in Singapore [18]. CA16 appeared to have been
attracting very little interest probably due to its association with often mild and benign clinical symptoms.
Therefore, there had been much less data about CA16
than EV71.
Both EV71 and CA16 were divided into several subtypes by vp1s (referred to nucleotide sequences, the
same below) or vp4s (referred to nucleotide sequences,
the same below). Data from molecular epidemiological
studies indicated that EV71 consisted of 3 genotypes A,
B (B0~B5) and C (C1~C5) [14,19-24]. However, C4 was
being proposed as genotype D recently [25,26]. Based on
phylogenetic analysis of vp4s, CA16 was classified into
three distinct genetic lineages A, B, and C. Lineage A
was represented by only one isolate of the prototype
G10 [27]. In a recent report, CA16 was divided into two
distinct genogroups A and B based on vp1s, which was
probably a more accurate description for vp1s containing more nucleotides and genetic information. The prototype G10 was the only member of genogroup A.
Genogroup B was divided into two separate lineages (1
and 2) [28]. In fact, lineage B and C viruses in the analysis based on vp4s represented lineage B1 and lineage B2
viruses, respectively, in genogroup B as determined
using complete vp1 sequences [28]. The capsids of both
EV71 and CA16 consisted of 4 proteins: VP1 (referred
to protein, the same below), VP2, VP3 and VP4
(referred to protein, the same below). VP1, VP2 and
VP3 were on the outer part of the caspid while VP4 is
on the inner part of it. It was believed that neutralization epitopes resided mainly on VP1, so most of
researches had been focused on VP1, but only few on
VP4.
Outbreaks of HFMD have occurred each year in Beijing recently [29] with various severity and outcomes of
the disease which is associated with the predominant
virus. The vp1s and vp4s of EV71 and CA16 isolated
from the specimens collected from patients of HFMD in
Beijing from 2007 to 2009 were sequenced and analyzed
together with some corresponding sequences obtained
from GenBank using DNAStar and MEGA 4.0 to analyze if the clinical manifestations of the children infected
were related to the variation of the genes of the viruses.
VP1 and VP4 encoding genes from field strains of EV71
and CA16 were cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21

cells. These expressed VP1s and VP4s were used as antigens to detect IgM and IgG antibodies in serum samples
from children by Western Blot to analyze and compare
their antigenicity and the prevalence of these two
viruses.

Results
The epidemiologic characteristics of HFMD in children
visiting our hospital from 2007 to 2009

From 2007 to 2009, no large epidemics of HFMD like
some other provinces in China were reported in Beijing,
but small local outbreaks with only a few cases with
severe complications did occur. During these years, 535
clinical specimens were collected from 361 patients who
visited the affiliated Children’s Hospital to our institute,
including 354 throat swabs and 181 vesicle fluids, and
the case number each year was 59 (in 2007), 197 (in
2008) and 105 (in 2009). These specimens were subject
to RT-PCR for EV71 and CA16 detection by using specific primers, followed by virus isolation with Vero cells.
Out of these 535 clinical specimens, 336 (62.8%) virus
strains were isolated. Co-infection by EV71 and CA16
was not found in these samples. Of the patients with
molecularly confirmed EV71 or CA16 infection, the age
ranged from 1 month to 15 years old, with 95% of the
patients being less than 5 years old. The positive rates
for EV71 in the cases from whom specimens were collected were 3.4% (2/59) in the year of 2007, 59.4% (117/
197) in 2008 and 11.4% (12/105) in 2009. The positive
rate for CA16 was 72.9% (43/59) in the year of 2007,
12.2% (24/197) in 2008 and 55.2% (58/105) in 2009.
Therefore, the predominant etiological agent of HFMD
in Beijing was CA16 in 2007 and 2009 but EV71 in
2008.
Comparison of vp1s and vp4s among EV71 and CA16

The vp1s from 14 strains of EV71 isolated from clinical
specimens in this study were sequenced and compared
with vp1s from 21 strains of EV71 obtained from GenBank (see Additional file 1). Pairwise nucleotide and
amino acid comparison of these sequences showed that
the variability among them was small. The nucleotide
identities among these sequences were 80.90%~99.70%
and the deduced amino acid identities among them
were 92.30%~100.00%, indicating that changes in amino
acids were fewer than those in nucleotides. The vp4s
from 10 out of these 14 field strains of EV71 were also
sequenced and analyzed with vp4s from other 22 strains
of EV71 obtained from GenBank (see Additional file 1).
The nucleotide identities in these vp4s were similar to
those in vp1s but the deduced amino acid sequences for
these vp4s were 98.60%~100.00%. In addition, nucleotide
sequence comparisons between sequences of EV71 isolated from mild cases and those of EV71 isolated from

severe cases in the present study showed that there were
no consistent divergences of nucleotides in vp1s or vp4s
(data not shown). The vp1s from 14 strains of CA16 isolated from clinical specimens in this study were
sequenced and analyzed with vp1s from 14 strains of
CA16 obtained from GenBank (see Additional file 1).
The nucleotide identities among them were 75.40%
~99.90% while the deduced amino acid identities of
them were 91.20%~100.00%. The nucleotide identities
among those CA16 VP4s were 80.20%~100.00% and the
deduced amino acids of them were identical (Table 1).
The nucleotide sequences of vp1s between EV71 and
CA16 were also compared using MegAlign of DNAStar.
Both vp1 encoding gene from EV71 and CA16 was 891
nucleotides in length and the deduced amino acids of
them were 297 in length. The identities of nucleotides
for them were 62.50%~66.80% and the deduced amino
acid identities for them were 70.00%~72.70%. The comparison between vp4s from EV71 and CA16 using
MegAlign of DNAStar showed that the number of
nucleotides was 207 in length and the deduced amino
acids of them were 69 in length. The identities of
nucleotides among them were 64.30%~73.90% and the
identities of the deduced amino acids were 78.30%
~79.70% (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analysis of complete vp1s and vp4s from
EV71 and CA16

Phylogenetic analysis of EV71 was based on the alignment of complete vp1 and vp4 gene sequences from
EV71. A total of 36 strains were included in the phylogenetic analysis of the EV71 vp1 genes. Among them,
vp1s from 14 EV71 field strains were sequenced in this
study, 8 strains available in GenBank were reported in
other studies in China, 13 strains obtained from GenBank were used as genotype reference and CA16 strain
G-10 was used as an outgroup. Phylogenetic analysis of
complete EV71 vp1s showed that these 14 EV71 strains
isolated in this study from 2007 to 2009 was closest to
C4 sub-genotype (Figure 1A). The phylogenetic analysis
tree of EV71 vp4s (Figure 1B) including 10 strains isolated in this study, 9 strains reported in other studies in
China and deposited in GenBank, 13 strains obtained
from GenBank and used as genotype references and

CA16 strain G-10 used as an outgroup, showed consistent result with that of phylogenetic analysis of complete
vp1s. In the same way, vp1s from 14 CA16 strains isolated in this study, 14 sequences obtained from GenBank and EV71 strain BrCr used as an outgroup for
phylogenetic tree analysis showed that lineage B2 of
CA16 circulated in Beijing during 2007 to 2009 (Figure
1C). The phylogenetic analysis of complete CA16 vp4s
including 1 sequences isolated in this study, 14
sequences obtained from GenBank and EV71 strain
BrCr used as an outgroup showed that the CA16 viruses
isolated in Beijing belonged to lineage C (Figure 1D),
which was consistent with results from vp1s.
Detection of IgM and IgG against EV71 and CA16 in
serum samples by Western blot using expressed VP1 and
VP4 as antigens

The VP4s of EV71 (amplified from specimen s67) and
CA16 (amplified from specimen s401) as well as VP1s
of EV71 (amplified from specimen s108) and CA16
(amplified from specimen s390) were expressed in E.
coli BL21 and used as antigen by Western Blot to detect
specific IgM antibodies in serum samples collected from
children with acute enterovirus (EV) infections (Figure
2). Out of 14 serum samples from children with acute
EV71 infection, 12 were positive for VP1 of s108 (EV71)
and 1 for VP1 of s390 (CA16). Out of 12 serum samples
from children with acute CA16 infections, the number
of positive serum samples for s108 VP1 and s390 VP1
were 3 and 7, respectively. This result suggested that
VP1s from EV71 and CA16 could be used for the detection of IgM specific antibodies in serum samples from
patients with acute infections (Table 2). When expressed
VP4s of s67 (EV71) and s401 (CA16) were used as antigen to detect specific IgM, all of these 26 serum samples
were negative, which raised the question about the antigenicity of the expressed VP4s from EV71 and CA16.
These 4 expressed proteins were then used to detect
specific IgG antibodies by Western Blot (Figure 3) in
189 serum samples, including 141 sera collected from
adults for regular health check up and 48 sera from children without acute EV infections. The serum positive
rate for IgG against EV71 VP1, CA16 VP1, EV71 VP4
and CA16 VP4 were 64.55% (122/189), 75.13% (142/

Figure 1 Phylogenetic analysis based on EV71 vp1s (A), EV71 vp4s (B), CA16 vp1s (C) and CA16 vp4s (D). The unrooted phylogenetic
trees were generated by the neighbor-joining method on the basis of a multiple alignment of the nucleotide sequences of EV71 vp1s, EV71
vp4s, CA16 vp1s and CA16 vp4s. The sequences in the dendrograms marked by red circle (○), green triangle (Δ) and blue square (□) were
isolated in this research (additional file 2) while other sequences were obtained from GenBank (additional file 1). CA16 strain G-10 was used as

EV71 and CA16 were of good antigenicity in the test of
IgG specific antibodies. There was significant difference
between the positive rates of IgG antibodies against
VP1s of EV71 and CA16 (c2 = 5.02, P < 0.05), implying
that these two proteins were not cross-reactive which
was similar to the results from the study conducted by
Shih et al [30]. The positive rates of IgG antibodies

against VP4s of EV71 and CA16 (c2 = 15.30, P < 0.01)
also suggested that there was no cross-reactivity
between them. The sera-positive rate of EV71 VP1 was
higher than that of EV71 VP4 (c2 = 26.47, P < 0.01) and
in the same way the sera-positive rate of CA16 VP1 was
higher than that of CA16 VP4 (c 2 = 16.78, P < 0.01)
(Table 3), which might be associated with the position
of the proteins in the capsid of the virus, that was VP1
was located on the outside of the capsid while VP4 was

those of CA16, suggesting that the exposure rate to
EV71 was lower than that to CA16 in the population.

Discussion
EV71 and CA16 were two of the members of the Picornaviridae family, whose genomes were characterized by
a single positive-stranded genomic RNA. Due to their
poor fidelity replication and frequent recombination, the
genomes of EV71 and CA16 mutated at a high rate. Different genotypes and sub-genotypes of these 2 viruses

about 130000 cases of HFMD, among whom 405
patients were severe and 78 died [3,4,31]. In 2000, there
was another report of outbreak, with 80677 cases of
HFMD and 41 deaths there [6]. From February to
August in 2006, Brunei with a population of about
370000 experienced its first reported major outbreak of
EV71. More than 1681 children were affected, with 3
deaths resulting from severe neurologic complications
[9]. In Mainland China, HFMD broke out repeatedly in
recent years. There were 83344, 488955 and 1155525
cases in the nationwide in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively, reported by the Ministry of Health, the People’s
Republic of China. The corresponding deaths for these
years were 17, 126 and 353, respectively. It suggested
that HFMD had been becoming a more and more serious public health problem in China.
In Beijing, no large HFMD epidemic has occurred so
far, but sporadic infections are common. In 2007 and

Li et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:246
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/246

2009, the predominant etiological agents of HFMD in
Beijing were CA16 while the main etiological agent was
EV71 in 2008. In general, comparison for nucleotides
among vp1s or vp4s of EV71 indicated that the nucleotide identity of these sequences from strains isolated in
the same year was higher than that of those sequences
from strains isolated in the different years, and the
nucleotide identity of these sequences isolated in this
study was higher than that of those sequences reported
in other parts of Mainland China and especially other
countries of the world. However, it was not necessarily
true. For example, the nucleotide identity of s374 vp4
isolated in 2009 and those isolated in 2008 in this
research was higher than that of s374 vp4 and s366 vp4
isolated in the same year of 2009. This suggested that
the transmission of EV71 was not strictly regional and
temporal restriction. In addition, the nucleotide comparison also indicated that the severity of patients’ illness
caused by EV71 infection seemed not to be correlated
with the sequence mutations in vp1 or vp4. The phylogenetic data in this study indicated that C4 of EV71 and
lineage B2 (C) of CA16 had been circulating in Beijing
in these 3 years and major mutations were not observed
in these virus strains, which was similar to the results
reported by other parts of Mainland China [14]. In
Mainland China there were no subgenotypes other than
C4 of EV71 reported which seemed to be regionally and
temporally restricted, but it was not true for the lineage
of CA16. In Shenzhen, lineage B1 and B2 co-circulated
in 1999 and 2000, but only lineage B2 was found from
2001 to 2004. In other parts of the world, the transmission of genotypes of EV71 and lineages of CA16 showed
a different trend. For example, in Malaysia EV71 outbreaks occurred in 1997 and 2000, mainly associated
with genotypes B3 and B4 alternating in the 2 years
[32,22], and lineage B1 and B2 of CA16 coexisted in
2000 and 2003[33]. In Taiwan region, EV71 epidemics
were associated with genotype C2 and B4.
The overall sero-positive rates of VP1 of EV71 and
CA16 in this research were 64.55% and 75.13%, respectively, which were higher than those reported by Rabenau et al, whose data showed 42.8% for EV71 and 62.9%
for CA16 for those individuals ≥ 1 years old [34]. The
difference of sero-positive rate in these two studies
might be caused by the variety of the detection method
used or age group of the participants. Nevertheless, both
results from our study and Rabenau’ suggested that the
exposure rate of CA16 was higher than that of EV71 in
the population.
EV71 other than CA16 was the cause of severe cases
of HFMD in young children. Generally the severity of
the patients infected by viruses was associated with 2
factors: host and virulence of the virus [4]. When
HFMD outbreaks were caused by EV71, there would be

Page 7 of 10

some severe cases and even deaths [3,6]. CA16 was
often associated with mild and benign clinical symptoms. Then the pathogenicity of EV71 should be stronger than that of CA16. EV71 and CA16 shared a lot in
some characteristics. For example, both of them
belonged to Enterovirus A and had a genome of about
7.4 k bp in length. The caspids of them consisted of 4
proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. Both of them could
cause HFMD. However, there were also many differences between them. In this study, we designed experiments to compare EV71 and CA16 in some aspects and
tried to find some of the differences. The nucleotide
identities of VP1 between them were less than 66.80%
and the identities of deduced amino acids were no more
than 72.70%. Although VP4s from them were much
conserved, there were still some differences in nucleotides and the deduced amino acids. The nucleotide identities of VP4s between them were 64.30%~73.90% and
the deduced amino acids identities were 78.30%~79.70%.
There were also some differences in inducing IgG in
host’s sera against VP1 and VP4 between EV71 and
CA16. The sera-positive rate of EV71 VP1 in the population was lower than that of CA16 VP1 and similarly
the sera-positive of EV71 VP4 was lower than that of
CA16 VP4, for which there might be 2 reasons. One
was that the exposure rate of EV71 might be lower than
that of CA16. Another was that it was more difficult to
induce IgG against EV71 than CA16 in hosts’ sera,
which might be associated with the different symptoms
caused by EV71 and CA16. When the specific IgM
against VP4s of these two viruses were tested in serum
specimens collected from children currently infected
with these two viruses, none of these sera showed positive reaction.

Conclusions
EV71 and CA16 were highly diverse in the nucleotide
sequences of vp1s and vp4s. The severity of illness of
EV71 infected was not associated with the sequence variation of vp1s or vp4s. The sera positive rates of VP1
and VP4 of EV71 were lower than that of CA16, suggesting less exposure rate to EV71 than CA16 in Beijing
population. The detection of serum antibodies by Western blot using VP1s and VP4s as antigens indicated
that the immunological reaction to VP1 and VP4 of
both EV71 and CA16 was different. IgM against VP1
but not VP4 was generated in children after acute infections, which needs to be clarified further.
Methods
Clinical specimens and isolation of viruses

Throat swabs and vesicle fluids were collected from
infants and children with clinical diagnosis of HFMD or
suspected EV infection who visited the Affiliated

Children’s Hospital to Capital Institute of Paediatrics
during the HFMD seasons of year 2007 to 2009. The
specimens were inoculated in Vero cells after being
delivered to the Laboratory of Virology, and CPE were
observed by microscopy everyday. When the CPE
reached ++++, the isolates were harvested and stored
at-80°C until use.

Table 4 Primers used for cloning and sequencing

Serum specimens for the detection of IgM antibodies
against the expressed VP1s and VP4s were collected
from infants and children with acute EV infection,
including 14 from children with acute EV71 infection
and 12 from children with acute CA16 infection identified by RT-PCR, virus isolation from throat swabs and
vesicle fluids, and immnofluorescence staining of IgM
against EV71 or CA16 in sera (data not shown).
Another batch of 189 sera were collected for the detection of IgG antibodies against the expressed proteins,
including 141 from adults for regular health check up
and 48 children without acute EV infections.
The study was performed according to the Declaration
of Helsinki II and approved by Ethics Committee of
Capital Institute of Paediatrics and written informed
consent was obtained from all patients or from their
caretakers.
Identification of EV71 and CA16 from clinical specimens
and isolated viruses by RT-PCR

RNAs were extracted from clinical specimens and isolated virus strains using Trizol (Invitrogen, USA) following the instructions provided by manufacture. RT-PCR
was carried out to identify EV71 and CA16 in the specimens and virus isolates. Viral cDNAs were generated
using random primer (Invitrogen, USA) and M-MLV
(Invitrogen, USA) by reverse transcription. EV consensus primers, EV71 and CA16 specific primers were
synthesized according to Perara D’s [33] and Singh S’
[35], and used to detect EV71 and CA16 by PCR as
described by our group previously [29]. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose
(GibcoBRL, US) gel and visualized by staining the gels
with ethedium bromide.
Cloning and sequencing of vp1s and vp4s

cDNA products from several virus isolates were selected
(see Additional file 2) and amplified by PCR with primers designed using primer premier 5.0 (Table 4). The
PCR cycling conditions for amplifying EV71 vp1s, EV71
vp4s and CA16 vp4s consisted of 4 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C 30 s, 52°C 30 s, 72°C 1 min,
and then 72°C for 7 min. The steps for amplifying EV71
vp4s were the same as those for amplifying the other 3
protein genes except for annealing temperatures at 55°C

for 30 s. Agarose gel electrophoresis and EasyPure
Quick Gel Extraction Kit (Trans Gen Biotech, China)
were used to purify those amplified products. The purified products were ligated to pGEM-T cloning vector
(Promega, USA) for transformation into competent
DH5a cells. Positive clones were identified by WhiteBlue colony selection and sequencing (Invitrogen Co).
Expression and Purification of VP1s and VP4s

The pET-30a vector with an N-terminal His·Tag/thrombin/S·Tag™/-enterokinase configuration plus an
optional C-terminal His·Tag sequence with endonuclease sites of BamHⅠand XhoⅠand the pGEX-4T-1 vector with an N-terminal GST (glutathione S-transferase)
·Tag/thrombin configuration with endonuclease sites of
EcoRⅠ and XhoⅠwere used for expressing VP1s and
VP4s, respectively. The virus isolates selected for expression were s67 (for VP4 of EV71), s108 (for VP1 of
EV71), s390 (for VP1 of CA16) and s401 (for VP4 of
CA16). The genes were purified with agarose gel electrophoresis and EasyPure Quick Gel Extraction Kit after
being amplified by PCR with corresponding primers
(Table 5). The cycling condition for amplifying VP1s of
EV71 and CA16 consists of 95°C for 4 min, followed by
35 cycles of 95°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s, 72°C 1 min, and then
72°C for 7 min. The steps for amplifying VP4 of EV71
and CA16 were the same as those for amplifying the
VP1s, except that the annealing temperatures were 50°C
and 57°C respectively.
These genes as well as plasmid DNAs of PET30a and
pGEX-4T-1 were digested with corresponding endonuclease (Promega, table 2) and ligated, followed by transformation into competent BL21 cells. After being
verified by sequencing, these recombinants were induced
with 1 mM isopropyl b-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
for 3 hours. The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min
and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g and 4°Cfor 5
min. The pellets containing VP1s were re-suspended in
Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCL PH 8.0, 150 mM Nacl, 2
mM Cacl2, 0.1% Triton-X-100), lysed by sonication for 5
min and centrifuged at 11,300 g and 4°C for 15 min.

The supernatants were removed and the pellets were
washed with Buffer B (50 mM Tris-Hcl PH 8.0, 1 mM
EDTA, 0.2% Triton-X-100, 4 M Urea) at 11,300 g and
4°C for 15 min for twice. The pellets were re-suspended
in Wash Buffer (0.1 M NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris-Hcl, 8 M
Urea) and incubated on ice for 2 hours. The supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 11,300 g and 4°
C for 15 min and loaded on columns for purification.
The pellets containing VP4s were re-suspended in PBS
(140 mM Nacl, 2.7 mM Kcl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.8
mM KH2 PO4 ) and sonicated for 5 min. The supernatants were separated from the pellets by centrifugation
at 10000 g and 4°C for 10 min and harvested, and the
pellets were re-suspended in PBS containing 8 M Urea
and mixed with the supernatants harvested. The mixtures were clarified by centrifugation at 10000 g and 4°C
for 10 min and the supernatants were loaded on columns for purification. VP1s were purified by nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA) and VP4s were purified by Glutathione Sepharose™ 4B (GE Healthcare, Sweden) following the
instructions of manufactures, respectively.
Detection of IgM/IgG against expressed VP1s and VP4s in
serum samples by Western Blot

The purified proteins of VP1s and VP4s were separated
by SDS-PAGE using 12% polyacrylamide gel and electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according
to standard procedures (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The
transferred membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat
milk in PBS, sliced into strips, and probed by sera. The
dilutions of sera were 1:10 and 1:200 for the detection
of IgM and IgG respectively. The secondary antibodies
were goat anti-human IgM conjugated with horseradishperoxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.,
USA) and goat anti-human IgG conjugated with horseradish-peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA), respectively. The membranes were
developed with 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB,
AMRESCO Inc., USA) colour developing reagent.

Data analysis

Sequence analyses were performed using DNAStar and
MEGA 4.0. The MagAlign of DNAStar was used to
compare nucleotides and deduced amino acids by
sequence distances and manual calculation. A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining
method after estimation of genetic distance using the pdistance method [36]. A bootstrapping test was performed 1,000 pseudo replicate data sets. The data about
the detection of IgG in sera by Western Blot were analyzed by chi-square method (c2 test). P < 0.05 is the
level for significant difference.
