Abstract
The genetic characterization of wild-type measles strains isolated during an epidemic cluster of
measles occurred in Puglia (South Italy), between November 2006 and January 2007, was
performed. Measles virus (MV) detection was carried out by a nested RT-PCR on 8 of 18 total
cases. The viruses were analyzed using the standard genotyping protocols. The N gene sequences
of the strains from outbreak were identical to each other, and sequence analysis revealed that the
viruses belonged to genotype B3, subgroup B3.1, never identified before in Italy. An importation of
measles B3.1 strains from Africa was hypothesized. Molecular surveillance will help to monitor the
progress in measles elimination.

Measles, a highly contagious exanthematic disease, is still
a threat for children both in developing and developed
countries despite the introduction of routine vaccination.
World Health Organization (WHO) has strengthened the
strategies for the control of measles and its related complications and mortality worldwide [1].

Measles virus (MV), a RNA virus belonging to Morbillivirus genus of the family of Paramixoviridae, is considered
monotypic although genetic heterogeneity has been evidenced among wild strains [4]. Actually, 23 genotypes (A,
B1–B3, C1–C2, D1–D10, E, F, G1–G3 and H1–H2) have
been recognized circulating in different parts of the world,
five of them (B1, D1, E, F, and G1) considered inactive
since they have not been detected in the past 15 years [5].

Active epidemiologic surveillance, laboratory confirmation of suspected cases and monitoring of measles virus
genotypes are also primary goals for countries of the
WHO European region involved in the process of eliminating measles [2]. Therefore, molecular epidemiology of
measles virus has proven a useful tool for epidemiologic
investigation and enables the identification of source of
infection and transmission pathways [3].

In Italy, a National Elimination Plan for Measles and Congenital Rubella was implemented in 2003 with the aim of
elimination of indigenous transmission of measles and of
reduction of congenital rubella cases to <1-case/100,000
live births according to WHO program for European
Region [6].

In order to reach the objective, laboratory surveillance of
cases and identification of contacts during outbreaks and
their prompt immunization was set up to limit the spread
of infection. In fact, based on the current coverage levels
for MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) in Italy (a
national average of 88% with the first dose within 24
months of age and 46% with the second dose in 2005)
and considering the scenario prospected by mathematical
models, periodical outbreaks of the diseases could occur
due to the presence of susceptibles [7,8].
Between November 2006 and January 2007 an epidemic
cluster of measles was identified in Barletta city, Puglia
region (South Italy), among children and teenagers <16
years. We investigated the outbreak by serological and
molecular methods and determined the measles genotype
involved by sequence-based methods.
At the beginning of January 2006 the Coordinating Center
of Notifiable Infectious Diseases (Osservatorio Epidemiologico Regione Puglia) received the notification of some
cases of measles in the city of Barletta, located about 50
km at North of Bari, Puglia region, South Italy. A case of
measles was defines as a case that met the clinical case definition (clinical picture compatible with measles, i.e., a
generalized rash lasting more than three days and a temperature >38°C), as well as one or more of the following
symptoms: cough, coryza, Koplik's spots, conjunctivitis. A
case of measles was also defined as a case that was laboratory confirmed (anti-measles virus IgM positive or RTPCR/nested-PCR positive) or as a case that met the clinical
case definition and was epidemiologically linked to a laboratory confirmed case. From 19 November 2006 to 9
January 2007, 18 cases of measles were reported, 17 in the
city of Barletta and 1 in the city of Monopoli, a city located
at South of Bari (about 100 Km distant from Barletta). The
case of Monopoli was epidemiologically linked to the
cluster of Barletta. The first reported case was a male sixyear old boy who had never been vaccinated and who was
admitted to hospital with fever >38°C, rhinitis, conjunctivitis and cough on 22 November and who developed
rash on 24 November. On 24 November a classmate of
the first case presented the same symptoms but was not
hospitalized. Two days before hospitalization, the first
reported case spent some time together with a male cousin
11 years old, not vaccinated, who developed symptoms
(fever, cough and rhinitis) starting from 27 November. He
revealed the solely case of measles in the city of Monopoli
and was not hospitalized. No clinical samples were available from these three cases for laboratory confirmation of
measles. In response to the first notification of measles, an
active surveillance was set up to trace all possible cases
and susceptible contacts.

Seven cases of the epidemic cluster were unvaccinated
schoolmates of the first reported case. The other 11 unvaccinated cases resided in the same neighborhood. The epidemic curve for the outbreak shows the number of total
and laboratory-confirmed measles cases (Figure 1). The
50% of cases were hospitalized. The mean age of children
was 6 years old (range: 9 months–15 years). Twenty-eight
percent of cases (5) were young children less than 24
months, 33% (6) children aged 3–6 years and 39% (7)
children aged 5–15 years. The 55% of subjects were males
and the 45 % were females.
After receiving the first notification of measles an extraordinary vaccination campaign for MMR was undertaken
and all contacts and susceptible children who attended
the school of the town were traced and vaccinated with a
first dose of MMR or a second dose if they had previously
received only one dose. As a result, 1251 children 2–10
years of age were vaccinated between 12 January and 1
March 2007.
Clinical samples were collected from 12 subjects. Pharyngeal swabs and acute serum samples were obtained from
8 patients and were collected within 2 week after clinical
symptoms onset. Convalescent serum samples were
obtained for 8 patients. Only for 4 patients both acute and
convalescent samples were available.
Sera were tested for the presence of MVs specific IgM by
using µ-chain capture Elisa and for specific IgG by indirect
Elisa (Measles virus IgM and Measles virus IgG, DiaSorin,
Saluggia, Italy).
For direct detection of measles virus, total nucleic acids
were extracted from throat swabs by the use of a commer-

The one step cMasterRTplusPCR System (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) was used for retrotranscription and
first round PCR. The primers used were Sar1F and Sar1R
[9]. A nested PCR was performed on first round negative
samples with the Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase High
Fidelity (Invitrogen, srl Milan, Italy) and with the primers
Sar2F e Sar2R [9]. RNA extracted by 200 µl of a reconstituted dose of MMR vaccine (Priorix, GlaxoSmithKline
S.p.A.) was used as positive control for measles detection.
Positive samples showed a 444 bp or 229 bp fragment
(nested PCR) after agarose gel electrophoresis and UV
light visualization.

The 456-bp segment of the N gene of these MV strains,
usually used for genotyping, was amplified with the
primer MV-N1 and MV-N2 [10].
PCR products were purified using the QIAquick Purification kit (Qiagen S.p.A, Italy) and subjected to sequencing
(ABI Prism 3100; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
The relatedness of 456-bp segments of the N gene of the 8
MV strains was assessed through multiple sequence alignment by using ClustalX program. The phylogenetic tree
was generated by neighbor-joining method. The output
graphics of the tree was produced with NJplot package.
Measles was laboratory confirmed in 8 patients of the outbreak. All these patients resulted positive by molecular
detection (3 after first round PCR and 5 after nested-PCR).
Seven acute serum samples resulted positive for measles
IgM antibodies. In one case measles was laboratory confirmed only by RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab since the
serum sample was negative for specific IgM and IgG. Of
the 7 IgM positives sera, 4 resulted negative for IgG
whereas in 3 cases a contemporary presence of measles
specific IgM and IgG antibodies was detected. Four
patients of the epidemic cluster clinically diagnosed as
measles cases and whose convalescent sera were available,
showed positivity solely for IgG antibodies.
Sequence analysis revealed a complete nucleotide identity
among strains in the N gene and genotyping showed a
genotype B3 (subgroup B3.1) (Figure 2). This is the first
report of the detection of genotype B3 in Italy. The strains
characterized showed the highest degree of identity (99%)
with the strain MVs/London.GBR/31.05 circulating in UK
in 2005 (GenBank accession number EF079129). The
molecular characterization of the strains revealed an
apparently imported MVs strains although the origin of
outbreak was not known despite an accurate epidemiologic investigation. Genotype B3 has been the most frequently detected measles genotype in western and central

Africa [10,11]. Several importations of B3 strains into
Europe and USA have recently been reported by Rota et al.
[12]. Nevertheless, the B3 strains characterized during the
current outbreak did not show strict relationships with the
strains reported in the latter study. On the other hand, the
geographical position of Italy in the Mediterranean basin
and the continuous influx of refugees also from sub-Saharan Africa could have enhanced the importation of such
measles strains.
In Italy, no specific reports on the molecular epidemiology of measles strains are available. Nevertheless, a review

genotypes indicated the presence, in Italy, during 1950s–
2004 of endemic genotypes C2 (1995), D6 (1996–1997),
D8 (1999), and D7 (2002–2003) [13].
More recently, in Italy, two outbreaks of measles have
been reported caused by D4 imported measles genotype
[14,15]. The first outbreak occurring in Grosseto (southern Tuscany) in 2006 it is likely that originated from an
imported case from India where D4 genotype is endemic
[7]. The second outbreak occurred in Rome and Lazio
region (central Italy), also due to D4 genotype, originated
from a nomadic gipsy population (Roma-Sinti) [15].
Importation of measles is now the main cause of possible
outbreaks in countries that have eliminated indigenous
measles. Therefore, in order to reach the goal set by WHO
to eliminate measles from the European region by 2010
[16-18], strengthened active surveillance and molecular
characterization of the strains is crucial for monitoring the
progress in measles elimination.
